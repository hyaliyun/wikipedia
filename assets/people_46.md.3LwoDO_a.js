Soldiers and police searched for arms and made arrests in Jerusalem, Tel Aviv, and Haifa, and in several dozen settlements; the Jewish Agency was raided. The total number of British security forces involved is variously reported as 10,000, 17,000, and 25,000. About 2,700 individuals were arrested, among them future Israeli Prime Minister Moshe Sharett. The officially given purpose of the operation was to end \\"the state of anarchy\\" then existing in Palestine. Other objectives included obtaining documentary proof of Jewish Agency approval of sabotage operations by the Palmach and of an alliance between the Haganah and the more violent Lehi (Stern Gang) and Irgun, destroying the Haganah's military power, boosting army morale and preventing a coup d'√©tat being mounted by the Lehi and Irgun.Clarke, Thurston, By Blood and Fire, Putnam, 1981, Ch.6. Background June 16, 1946, saw the \\"Night of the Bridges\\" when the Palmach blew up eight road and rail bridges linking Palestine to neighbouring countries. On June 17, the Lehi attacked railway workshops in Haifa. Shortly afterwards, the Irgun kidnapped six British officers. One officer subsequently escaped, and two were released. The Irgun announced that the remaining officers would be released only in exchange for the commutation of death sentences for two Irgun members.The Role of Jewish Defense Organizations in Palestine The British Army had, for months, wanted to take military action against the Zionist underground organizations, but had been blocked by High Commissioner Alan Cunningham, who was also particularly opposed to military action being taken against the Jewish Agency. Cunningham changed his mind after the \\"Night of the Bridges\\" and flew to London to meet the British Cabinet and army chief Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery in London. Montgomery formulated the plan for Operation Agatha. With reluctance, Cunningham accepted it, hoping that, with the more militant Zionists restrained, the way would be opened to reaching a political settlement with the more moderate (and pro-British) leaders such as Chaim Weizmann. During the operation, in a radio broadcast, Cunningham said: \\"[The arrests] are not directed against the Jewish community as a whole but solely against those few who are taking an active part in the present campaign of violence and those who are responsible for instigating and directing it ... .\\" Chief of the Secretariat, Sir John Shaw, outlined the official objective of the operation at a press conference in Jerusalem: \\"Large-scale operations have been authorized to end the state of anarchy existing in Palestine and to enable law-abiding citizens to pursue their normal occupations without fear of kidnapping, murder, or being blown-up.\\" Shaw believed that the British should end the existing situation by either partitioning Palestine into Jewish and Arab states and then leaving or dismantling the Jewish Agency, which claimed administrative authority yet secretly supported acts by the underground Zionist military organizations, and governing without it, approved of the operation. Underlying the official objective were several others. One was to obtain documentary proof of the Jewish Agency's approval of sabotage operations by the Palmach and an alliance between the Haganah and the more violent Lehi (Stern Gang) and Irgun in carrying out violent acts. Another was to forestall a coup d'etat. In June, members of the Jewish Agency's Executive and the Haganah High Command had met with delegates of the Irgun and Lehi at which the latter, according to intelligence, had stated their intention of asking the Yishuv to participate in a coup \\"for the proclamation of a future Jewish State and the interruption of all relations with the existing Palestine Administration.\\" In the wake of the \\"Night of the Bridges,\\" another was to break the military power of the Haganah. As the Haganah had appeared to be acting in cooperation with the Lehi and Irgun, the British authorities believed, mistakenly, that this was also necessary because the Haganah might co-operate with the prospective Irgun and Lehi coup. Lastly, Montgomery had stated that the operation was required to boost army morale. Operation A room in Kibbutz Yagur after a weapon search conducted during Operation Agatha. From the collections of the National Library of Israel. On June 29, Operation Agatha began, lasting until July 1. Curfews were imposed throughout Palestine, low-flying planes circled Jerusalem, roadblocks were put up, trains were flagged down, and passengers were evacuated and escorted home. Special licenses were required for the operations of emergency vehicles. British troops and police raided the Jewish Agency headquarters in Jerusalem, the Jewish Agency office in Tel Aviv, and other Jewish institutions such as the Women's International Zionist Organization and the Histadrut. A total of 27 Jewish settlements in Palestine were searched, and the residents of these settlements sometimes put up fierce resistance. Four Jews were killed resisting British searches. Mass arrests of Jewish leaders and Haganah members were carried out. A total of 2,718 people were arrested, including four members of the Jewish Agency Executive, seven Haganah officers, and nearly half of the Palmach's fighting force. However, due to a Haganah intelligence warning, most Haganah commanders were able to evade arrest. Searches of Jewish settlements uncovered 15 arms caches, including one of the Haganah's three central arsenals at Kibbutz Yagur, where more than 300 rifles, some 100 2-inch mortars, more than 400,000 bullets, some 5,000 grenades and 78 revolvers were confiscated. The arms were displayed at a press conference, and all the men of Yagur were arrested.Etzel.org Agatha triggered echoes of the Holocaust in the minds of many people. Women ripped their clothing to expose concentration camp tattoos. There were incidents of people in the settlements herded into cages while screaming that this was what the Nazis did. A minority among the British troops exacerbated the situation by shouting \\"Heil Hitler,\\" scrawling swastikas on walls, and referring to gas chambers while conducting searches.Clarke, ibid., pp.68-69. Aftermath and consequences Statement of Information regarding recent attacks, including a summary of information gained from Operation Agatha. After Agatha ended, the kidnapped British officers were released, and High Commissioner Alan Cunningham commuted the Irgun members' death sentences to life imprisonment. The Haganah and Palmach were dissuaded from continued anti-British operations.Alan Cunningham, \\"Palestine: The Last Days of the Mandate\\", International Affairs (Royal Institute of International Affairs 1944), Vol. 24, No. 4 Oct. 1948, pp. 485. However, the more extreme groups, the Lehi (Stern Gang) and the Irgun Tzvai Leumi, headed by future Prime Minister Menachem Begin, continued and even intensified their attacks.Jewish Virtual Library Specifically, the Irgun retaliated for Operation Agatha by bombing the south wing of the King David Hotel, which was the headquarters of the British government in Palestine. One reason for bombing the South wing was because that was the location where it was presumed that the British had taken the documents from the Jewish Agency.

The film was produced by Open Road Films Ltd. and Columbia Pictures. The screenplay, written by blacklisted Hollywood writer Lester Cole (under the pseudonym \\"Gerald L.C. Copley\\"), was based upon Joy Adamson's 1960 non-fiction book Born Free. The film was directed by James Hill and produced by Sam Jaffe and Paul Radin. Born Free, and its musical score by John Barry, won numerous awards. Plot In a village in the Northern Province of Kenya, a human is killed and eaten by a male lion. British senior game warden, George Adamson (Bill Travers) is sent in to kill the menacing lion and also his female, who charges him in defence of her three cubs. George brings the three cubs home to his wife Joy (Virginia McKenna) and raises them. They name the cubs Big One, Lastika and Elsa who is the youngest and the one which Joy and George become especially attached to. When the cubs get too old, the older two are sent to Rotterdam Zoo but the Adamsons choose to keep Elsa. Some years later, Joy and George soon have to travel to Kiunga as George has been told by his boss, John Kendall (Geoffrey Keen) about a lion who is killing goats in a local village. George successfully manages to kill the lion and he and Joy are able to share a special holiday with Elsa, where they introduce her to the Indian Ocean. On returning to the Northern Province, the Adamsons learn that Elsa has caused a massive elephant stampede. Kendall states that the Adamsons can no longer keep Elsa and must find a zoo to take her in. However, Joy instead wishes to teach Elsa how to survive in the wild, which Kendall reluctantly gives her and George three months to do. Joy and George travel to Meru National Park where they aim to release Elsa. Initially, they attempt to introduce Elsa to a male lion, which does not go to plan ‚Äì they leave her overnight with a fresh zebra kill but return in the morning to find her all by herself. Elsa is constantly taken out to the bush but fails to make a kill, getting attacked by a warthog on one of these outings. Eventually, Joy and George decide to leave Elsa in the bush for at least a week and change the location of their camp so that Elsa can become more independent. However, they find her severely injured (possibly by wild lions). Joy still believes that she can teach Elsa to survive as she opposes sending her to a zoo, where she will have no freedom. This proves to be a good decision as Elsa eventually starts leaving the Adamsons for days at a time and eventually makes several kills. The Adamsons thus take her out for her final test ‚Äì an attempt to join a wild pride. Elsa manages to fight a wild lioness and is accepted into the pride ‚Äì Joy and George are overjoyed at their success but promise to see their dear friend again when they return to Kenya. A year later, the Adamsons return to Kenya and are given a week to find Elsa. They are overjoyed to see that Elsa has succeeded as a wild lion and is now the mother of three cubs. However, Joy and George both agree that they will not interact with the cubs, allowing them to survive as wild lions.

George Adamson served as chief technical advisor on the film and discusses his involvement in his first autobiography, Bwana Game (UK title, 1968), known in the US as A Lifetime with Lions.Bibliography ‚Äì BooksFilmsMovies According to Ben Mankiewicz, who introduces the film on Turner Classic Movies, the production unit mainly used wild lions. The making of the film was a life-changing experience for actors Virginia McKenna and her husband Bill Travers, who became animal rights activists and were instrumental in creating the Born Free Foundation. One of the lions in the film was played by a former mascot of the Scots Guards, who had to leave him behind when they left Kenya. The producers also acknowledged the help received from Emperor Haile Selassie of Ethiopia and the Game Department of Uganda. Critical response and box-office Born Free received critical acclaim. Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reports that 92% of 12 film critics have given the film a positive review, with a rating average of 7 out of 10. Vincent Canby waxed enthusiastic about the film, writing in The New York Times, \\"Almost from the opening shot ‚Äì a vast expanse of corn-coloured African plain where lions feed on the carcass of a freshly killed zebra ‚Äì one knows that Joy Adamson's best-selling book Born Free has been entrusted to honest, intelligent filmmakers.

Kennedy in Dallas, Texas, on November 22, 1963. Tague received a minor wound to his right cheek, caused by tiny pieces of concrete debris from a street curb that was struck by fragments from a bullet that was fired at Kennedy. Besides Kennedy and Texas Governor John B. Connally, Tague was the only person known to have been wounded by gunfire in Dallas's Dealey Plaza that day. Life Tague was born on a farm near Plainfield, Indiana. He dropped out of Purdue University to join the United States Air Force where he graduated from the United States Air Force School of Aerospace Medicine. Tague subsequently became a car salesman in Dallas. Kennedy assassination Tague had been driving to downtown Dallas to have lunch with his girlfriend (and future wife) when he came upon a traffic jam due to the presidential motorcade which was traveling west on Elm Street. Tague testified to the Warren Commission that the traffic jam caused him to park his car on the north curb of Commerce Street, where he then \\"got out of his car and stood by the bridge abutment\\". Tague was a few feet north of the southern edge of the triple underpass railroad bridge, when he saw the presidential limousine and heard the first shot. Like many other witnesses, Tague remembered hearing this first shot and likened it to a firecracker. He later testified that the first shot he recalled hearing occurred after the presidential limousine had already completed the 120-degree slow turn from Houston Street onto Elm Street and then straightened out. The motorcade then proceeded towards him. Soon after the shots were fired, Tague was approached by Dallas Sheriff's detective Buddy Walthers, who had noticed that Tague had specks of blood on his right cheek. Tague also had a small left facial scab, caused by an unrelated event that occurred a week prior to the assassination. The detective asked Tague where he had been standing. The two men then examined the area and discovered ‚Äî on the upper, curved part of Main Street south curb - a \\"very fresh scar\\" impact that, to each of them, looked like a bullet had struck there and taken a small chip out of the curb's concrete. They came to the conclusion that one bullet ricocheted off the curb and the debris hit Tague. This curb surrounding the scar chip was not cut out until August 1964 after Tague repeatedly reminded authorities that he had also been wounded during the shots, and it is now in the National Archives. The scar chip was north of the south edge of the triple underpass railroad bridge, about from where Tague stood during the attack. The detective told Tague it looked like a bullet had been fired from either the Texas School Book Depository or the Dal-Tex Building. After the assassination =Warren Commission and FBI= Tague was called by the Warren Commission to testify on July 28, 1964. He initially stated that he was wounded on his cheek by either the second or third shot of the three shots that he remembered hearing. When the Commission counsel pressed him to be more specific, Tague testified that he was wounded by the second shot. When the Commission counsel asked Tague where he sensed was the source of the gunshots, Tague testified the shots were fired and \\"coming from my left,\\" \\"by the, whatever you call the monument,\\" which was the area of the North Pergola Monument that is located on the north grassy knoll, several hundreds of feet apart from and west of the Book Depository building. According to the Warren Commission's final report, forensic tests by the FBI revealed that the chipped bullet mark impact location contained no embedded copper metal residue, indicating that it was not created by \\"an unmutilated military full metal- jacketed bullet such as the bullet from Governor Connally's stretcher.\\" Tague, in his book Truth Withheld, published pictures of the wound taken on November 23, 1963,JFK - L. Fletcher Prouty; Chapter 19, Page 300, Paragraph 3 and as it sat in the National Archives in 1997. =Books and events= In 2003, the 40th anniversary year of the assassination, Tague published a book, Truth Withheld (), detailing his experiences during and after the assassination. He wrote that he was injured following the second shot. In 2011, Tague was used by Max Holland as a witness to support Holland's first shot miss theory for the show JFK: The Lost Bullet. In 2013, Tague published his second book, LBJ and the Kennedy Killing (), claiming that Vice-President Lyndon B. Johnson and his associates were involved in the assassination of President Kennedy. Later life and death Tague became a car salesman in Bonham, Texas, where he retired. He died there on February 28, 2014, at the age of 77.

Notable features The Endless Mountains are a major geographic feature of the eastern counties. Education The region is home to Mansfield University of Pennsylvania, located in Mansfield. Economy The Northern Tier region as a whole is notorious for its high unemployment and low per-capita incomes in comparison to the rest of Pennsylvania, though the discovery of the Marcellus Formation provided an economic boost in the 2000s and 2010s. The region's top two employers are government-funded services, specifically health care and education services. Agriculture is an important activity in the region despite the short growing season and hilly terrain. Small-scale beef and dairy farming is common, and there are many small-scale producers of maple syrup in the region. Production of crude oil and natural gas are important to the local economy. The characteristics of Pennsylvania Grade Crude Oil make it especially desirable for high-end uses. Logging, forest product industries and paper product industries are significant parts of the region's economy. Agriculture and light manufacturing are also important employers.

Production This film was created by a constituency of artists from Canada and the United Kingdom, along with academic and theological consultants from around the world. The cast was selected primarily from the Stratford Shakespeare Festival and Soulpepper Theatre Company, as well as Britain's Royal Shakespeare Company and Royal National Theatre. The musical score, composed by Jeff Danna and created for the film, is partially based on the music of the Biblical period. The film was produced by Visual Bible International.

The filming production was shot in Toronto, Ontario, and Almeria, Andalucia, Spain. Criticism While the film is largely a faithful depiction of the Gospel of John, some have commented that the inclusion of Mary Magdalene at the Last Supper has no Biblical citation. However, according to the Gospels, she was one of the women who accompanied Jesus and the disciples to Jerusalem, was present at the Crucifixion and burial of Jesus, was the first to whom Jesus appeared at the Resurrection, and was with the disciples in the upperroom after the Resurrection. Thus, like many modern movies about Jesus, the producers are faithfully attempting to help their audience see what the Gospel writers sometimes have not included.

He served as Premier of British Columbia from 1915 to 1916. The son of William Bowser and Margaret Gordon, Bowser was educated locally and at Mount Allison University and Dalhousie University. He moved to Vancouver to practice law in 1891, and was first elected to the provincial legislature in the 1903 election as a Conservative. Bowser served as Attorney-General in the cabinet of Sir Richard McBride from 1907 until 1915, when he succeeded McBride as Premier. The Conservative party was deeply divided and unpopular and the change in leadership did not improve matters. Accusations of corruption and \\"machine politics\\" were rife. The Conservatives also neglected to address popular demands for women's suffrage and prohibition. Bowser's government was defeated in the 1916 election, losing to Liberal leader Harlan Carey Brewster, who two years later was succeeded by the more memorable John Oliver. Bowser continued as leader of the opposition until he lost his seat in the 1924 election. He returned to politics in the 1933 election to lead the Non-Partisan Independent Group of candidates, but died during the election campaign. A river, a lake and the small community of Bowser on Vancouver Island, between Parksville and the Comox Valley, are named for Bowser.

Since 2012, Stephen Langridge has served as the theatre's Artistic Director.  History  The Gothenburg opera house is relatively new: construction started in September 1989 after significant local commitment in the late 1980s (with as many as 6,000 contributors to the new house) and it was completed with great speed. Ground breaking took place in June 1991, and the building was inaugurated in October 1994. It hosted Melodifestivalen 2000, the Swedish national selection for the Eurovision Song Contest.  Building and capacity  The result was an auditorium built in the classical style. With its stalls and balconies, it has 1,301 seats. The orchestra pit has room for about 100 musicians. The House is shared by opera, ballet, musicals and operettas so the architects had to meet a number of challenges. It is a large house ‚Äì 160 metres long and 85 metres wide at its widest ‚Äì and the building is 32 metres high. The floor area is 28,700 square metres. The main stage is 500 square metres, while the stage opening is 20 metres (66 ft) high and 9 metres (30 ft) wide. There are four movable platforms that each can carry a weight of 15 tons. The stage can be lit by 1000 spotlights with 250 automatic color scrollers and 900 dimmer lights.  Architecture  The G√∂teborg Opera house, northern facade The architect, Jan Izikowitz, shares his vision of the house: > The building should be possessed by an airiness that sends your mind soaring > across the meandering landscape like wings of seagulls. Its shape should be > inspired by its location, from the magnificent but elusive landscape with > its light and open spaces, to the harbor's more tangible technical > constructions; the bridges gracefully suspended across the water, the > transparent framework of the harbor cranes, the strength, softness and > elegance of the ships' hulls, the wings of seagulls and the flawless > aerodynamic shape of sails. He reflects on the operatic aspect of the design: \\"The world of opera should also be visible in the architecture: the rear stage wall as a large set piece, the colonnade as a series of symbolic gates and stage openings, the fly towers as gigantic lighting towers, the shape and color of the auditorium as an allusion to old traditions.\\" The overall size of the building is a reflection of the company's growth and its spread throughout the city. Therefore, the building attempts to encompass all the activities that were earlier spread out at six different locations are now housed in one building. Another reason is that the G√∂teborg Opera should be able to offer as wide a selection of productions as possible, with the possibility of changing performance and art form from one night to another. There can be five assembled stage sets stored in the house at the same time, in five different areas the same size as the main stage. With the help of advanced modern technology, whole stage sets can be moved around, exchanged and assembled for the next performance.

The ownership of NOP is divided between the Ume√• Municipality (40%) and the V√§sterbotten County Council (60%). NOP was established in 1974 as a regional opera ensemble. The NOP's first artistic director was Arnold √ñstman, from 1974 to 1979. NOP now has its own symphony orchestra and facilities for opera, dance, music and art as well as workshops and studios.  History  Norrlandsoperan was founded in 1974 as a direct result of Swedish cultural reform the same year. The musical theater group S√•ngens makt constituted the core of the newly formed opera ensemble. The ensemble initially had to use temporary premises but soon found a more permanent home at Ume√• Folkets hus (then housed in a building at the intersection J√§rnv√§gsall√©n/√ñstra kyrkogatan). Norrlandsoperan's first director was Arnold √ñstman, who also was the artistic director of the opera in the years 1974‚Äì1979. In 1984 Norrlandsoperan moved to the old fire station in Ume√•, which was built in 1937 in a functionalist style and designed by Wejke & √ñdeen. The fire station underwent extensive rebuilding and expansion, designed by Olle Qvarnstr√∂m. In 2002 the newly built theater and concert hall, which is incorporated with the old opera house, was inaugurated. The new building houses a hall with 480 seats, a large stage with side stages and orchestra pit, and a concert hall with 500 seats. Every year in May, since 2006, Norrlandsoperan has arranged the annual MADE festival on its premises, and outdoors on Operaplan. Past NOP artistic directors have included Magnus Aspegren. The current managing director and artistic director of NOP is Kjell Englund, since August 2009. Past chief conductors have included Roy Goodman (1995‚Äì2001), Kristjan J√§rvi (2000‚Äì2004), Andrea Quinn (2005‚Äì2009), and Rumon Gamba (2009‚Äì2015). In April 2016, the company announced the appointment of Elim Chan as its next chief conductor, effective in 2017, with an initial contract of 3 years. Notable recent productions and collaborations include: * Demons of the Opera (2005, with local hard rock groups) * Porgy and Bess (2006, Cape Town Opera) * Blog Opera (2007, a collaboration with local school children of different ages) NOP also assists with other arts organisations, such as the MADE performing arts festival and the Ume√• Jazz Festival. During the opening week of the European City of Culture festival in Ume√• in January 2014, Gamba conducted the NorrlandsOperan orchestra in the Konsertsalen in a complete Beethoven symphony cycle, where each of the nine symphonies was prefaced by the premiere of a new work by a contemporary composer.M√∂te mellan gammalt och nytt i \\"Beethoven & Beyond\\"; report on Beethoven cycle with new works accessed 5 February 2014.List of Beethoven & Beyond concerts with dates and composers; page at NorrlandsOperan accessed 5 February 2014.

Performance facilities There are four venues, with corresponding seating capacity: * Teatern (Theatre): 470 seats * Konsertsalen (Concert Hall): 569 seats * Black Box: up to 260 seats * B-salen (B-Hall): 64 seats (primarily for children's shows) The building also houses the Vita kuben (White Cube), an exhibition space for contemporary art. In 1984, NOP took over the space of the former fire station in Ume√•, which was originally built in 1937. After major renovations, the new venue opened in 2002, with a newly built theater and concert hall, combined with the old opera house. An assembly hall was subsequently constructed at the venue. During a concert with the band Mando Diao on 27 January 2007, parts of the floor collapsed and about 50 people fell about 2.5 meters to the underlying basement floor. 29 people were taken to hospital for treatment of varying degrees. In 2009 the former opera director was convicted in the District Court (Tingsr√§tt) for gross negligence, but was acquitted the following year by the Court of Appeals (Hovr√§tt). The opera's technical director who also was charged was acquitted in court.

Headquartered in Cambridge, MA the Lab is a unique joint research venture in artificial intelligence established by IBM and MIT, which brings together researchers in academia and industry to advance AI that has a real world impact for business, academic and society. The Lab funds approximately 50 projects per year that are co-led by principal investigators from MIT and IBM Research, with results published regularly at top peer-reviewed journals and conferences. Projects range from computer vision, natural language processing and reinforcement learning, to devising new ways to ensure that AI systems are fair, reliable and secure. =Australia= IBM Research ‚Äì Australia is a research and development laboratory established by IBM Research in 2009 in Melbourne. It is involved in social media, interactive content, healthcare analytics and services research, multimedia analytics, and genomics. The lab is headed by Vice President and Lab Director Joanna Batstone. It was to be the company‚Äôs first laboratory combining research and development in a single organisation. The opening of the Melbourne lab in 2011 received an injection of $22 million in Australian Federal Government funding and an undisclosed amount provided by the State Government. =Brazil= IBM Research ‚Äì Brazil is one of twelve research laboratories comprising IBM Research, its first in South America. It was established in June 2010, with locations in S√£o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro. Research focuses on Industrial Technology and Science, Systems of Engagement and Insight, Social Data Analytics and Natural Resources Solutions. The new lab, IBM's ninth at the time of opening and first in 12 years, underscores the growing importance of emerging markets and the globalization of innovation. In collaboration with Brazil's government, it will help IBM to develop technology systems around natural resource development and large-scale events such as the 2016 Summer Olympics. Engineer and associate lab director Ulisses Mello explains that IBM has four priority areas in Brazil: \\"The main area is related to natural resources management, involving oil and gas, mining and agricultural sectors. The second is the social data analytics segment that comprises the analysis of data generated from social networking sites [such as Twitter or Facebook], which can be applied, for example, to financial analysis. The third strategic area is nanotechnology applied to the development of the smarter devices for the intermittent production industry. This technology can be applied to, for example, blood testing or recovering oil from existing fields. And the last one is smarter cities.\\" =Japan= IBM Research ‚Äì Tokyo The IBM Research ‚Äì Tokyo, which was called IBM Tokyo Research Laboratory (TRL) before January 2009, is one of IBM's twelve major worldwide research laboratories. It is a branch of IBM Research, and about 200 researchers work for TRL. Established in 1982 as the Japan Science Institute (JSI) in Tokyo, it was renamed to IBM Tokyo Research Laboratory in 1986, and moved to Yamato in 1992 and back to Tokyo in 2012. IBM Tokyo Research Laboratory was established in 1982 as the Japan Science Institute (JSI) in Sanbanch≈ç, Tokyo. It was IBM's first research laboratory in Asia. Hisashi Kobayashi was appointed the founding director of TRL in 1982; he served as director until 1986. JSI was renamed to the IBM Tokyo Research Laboratory in 1986. In 1988, English-to-Japanese machine translation system called \\"System for Human-Assisted Language Translation\\" (SHALT) was developed at TRL. It was used to translate IBM manuals. =History= TRL was shifted from downtown Tokyo to the suburbs to share a building with IBM Yamato Facility in Yamato, Kanagawa Prefecture in 1992. In 1993, world record was accomplished for generation of continuous coherent Ultraviolet rays. In 1996, Java JIT compiler was developed at TRL, and it was released for major IBM platforms. Numerous other technological breakthroughs were made at TRL. The team led by Chieko Asakawa (:ja:ÊµÖÂ∑ùÊô∫ÊÅµÂ≠ê), IBM Fellow since 2009, provided basic technology for IBM's software programs for the visually handicapped, IBM Home Page Reader in 1997 and IBM aiBrowser (:ja:aiBrowser) in 2007. TRL moved back to Tokyo in 2012, this time at IBM Toyosu Facility. =Research= TRL researchers are responsible for numerous breakthroughs in sciences and engineering. The researchers have presented multiple papers at international conferences, and published numerous papers in international journals. They have also contributed to the products and services of IBM, and patent filings. TRL conducts research in microdevices, system software, security and privacy, analytics and optimization, human computer interaction, embedded systems, and services sciences. =Other activities= TRL collaborates with the Japanese universities, and support their research programs. IBM donates its equipment such as servers, storage systems, and so forth to the Japanese universities to support their research programs under the Shared University Research (SUR) program. In 1987, IBM Japan Science Prize was created to recognize researchers, who are not over 45 years old, working at Japanese universities or public research institutes. It is awarded in physics, chemistry, computer science, and electronics. =Switzerland= IBM Research ‚Äì Zurich (previously called IBM Zurich Research Laboratory, ZRL) is the European branch of IBM Research. It was opened in 1956 and is located in R√ºschlikon, near Zurich, Switzerland. In 1956, IBM opened their first European research laboratory in Adliswil, Switzerland, near Zurich. The lab moved to its own campus in neighboring R√ºschlikon in 1962. The Zurich lab is staffed by a multicultural and interdisciplinary team of a few hundred permanent research staff members, graduate students and post-doctoral fellows, representing about 45 nationalities. Collocated with the lab is a Client Center (formerly the Industry Solutions Lab), an executive briefing facility demonstrating technology prototypes and solutions. The Zurich lab is world-renowned for its scientific achievements‚Äîmost notably Nobel Prizes in physics in 1986 and 1987 for the invention of the scanning tunneling microscopeNobel Prize in Physics 1986 and the discovery of high-temperature superconductivity,Nobel Prize in Physics 1987 respectively. Other key inventions include trellis modulation, which revolutionized data transmission over telephone lines; Token Ring, which became a standard for local area networks and a highly successful IBM product; the Secure Electronic Transaction (SET) standard used for highly secure payments; and the Java Card OpenPlatform (JCOP), a smart card operating system. Most recently the lab was involved in the development of SuperMUC, a supercomputer that is cooled using hot water. The Zurich lab focus areas are future chip technologies; nanotechnology; fibre optics; supercomputing; data storage; security and privacy; risk and compliance; business optimization and transformation; server systems. The Zurich laboratory is involved in many joint projects with universities throughout Europe, in research programs established by the European Union and the Swiss government, and in cooperation agreements with research institutes of industrial partners. One of the lab's most high-profile projects is called DOME, which is based on developing an IT roadmap for the Square Kilometer Array. The research projects pursued at the IBM Zurich lab are organized into three scientific and technical departments: Science & Technology, Cloud and Computing Infrastructure and Cognitive Computing and Industry Solutions. The lab is currently managed by Alessandro Curioni. On 17 May 2011, IBM and the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH) Zurich opened the Binnig and Rohrer Nanotechnology Center, which is located on the same campus in R√ºschlikon.

It is one of the eastern suburbs of the city of Lausanne, located on the shores of Lake Geneva (Lac L√©man) and at the foot of the vineyards of Lavaux on the road to Vevey and Montreux. History Pully is first mentioned in 994 as Pulliacum. =Prehistory= In 1826 a neolithic cemetery with about 30 graves was uncovered at Pierra-Portray. However, the artifacts were not fully preserved and only one flint blade and a soapstone fragment still exist. Near Pierra-Portray, along the Chemin de Chamblandes, Albert Naef examined 23 tombs in 1901-10. These tombs belonging to a similar set of tombs which were sporadically excavated and recorded between 1880-1993. The local rectangular graves consisted of boxes assembled from four vertical slabs of about in length, with a fifth plate that served as a lid. The dead were lying on their left side with their legs drawn up to the chest and the head pointed to the east. The largest find of stone box graves in Pully was the cemetery at Chamblandes. Due to the number of finds at Chamblandes, all similar cist or stone box graves in the surrounding area came to be known as Chamblandes type graves. The cemetery of Chamblandes extends over a length of about a hundred meters (yards) and included 76 graves and over 100 skeletons. This Middle Neolithic (4300-3900 BC) graveyard included as grave goods; ocher, various commodities (polished stone ax) and jewelry (wild boar tusks, pendants made of shells, coral and lignite). Two collars, one needle, a dagger and a bronze knife-blade hatchet are attributed to an early Bronze Age grave. In 1992 a cremation grave was discovered that dated from the Late Bronze Age. =Roman villa= In the 1970s, while working on foundation of a terrace of the Le Prieur√© building, the corner of a large Roman era villa was discovered. The villa dates from the period between the second half of the 1st Century and 4th Century AD. The accompanying small thermal baths, a monumental pool and several walls were already known from earlier excavations. The heart of the east wing of the villa is a multi-level, semi-circular pavilion. The lower hall is decorated with, in situ preserved, wall paintings which represent a chariot race. The painting dates from the first quarter of the 2nd Century. Finds from the 4th and 5th Centuries show that the site was also, at least partially populated, during the late antiquity period. Between the 5th and 6th Century, the baths were converted into a Christian burial chapel with numerous burials. =Medieval Pully= During the Carolingian era the additional buildings were built around the burial chapel. During the Early Middle Ages (5th-7th century) a cemetery was operating at Les Deserts. In the 10th Century the royal family of Burgundy granted their vineyards at Pully to Payerne Priory. The priory retained this land in Pully until 1536. In 1079, Bishop Burkhard of Oltigen received some property from the Emperor in Pully. This land had previously belonged to Rudolf of Swabia. From then on, the Bishop of Lausanne possessed the jurisdiction right over the bailiwick of Pully. The Bishop first granted the bailiwick to the Lords of Faucigny, then in 1276 to the de Thoire-Villars family. Two officers, the Sautier or Weibel and the Seneschal, were responsible for the judiciary. The Counts of Geneva, the Geneva-Lullin family, were the Seneschals until 1536 and were practically the rulers of Pully. A number of other religious and secular leaders owned land or rights in the village. Until 1555, the Counts of Gruyere were one of the largest landowners in the area. In 1509, Bern and Fribourg mediated between the Count of Gruyere and the citizens of Pully. The market buildings in Pully were used until at least 1558. The municipality began to become a partly independent town in the 13th century and received its charter () in 1368. The town was administered by a twelve-member council until 1719, when it became an eleven-member group. The council was led by a knight banneret. =Early Modern and Modern Pully= In 1536, the town of Pully came under the administration of the cities of Bern and Lausanne. Lausanne renounced their rights in 1717. From 1536 until 1798 it belonged to the Bailiwick of Lausanne. Then, from 1798 until 2006, it was in the district of Lausanne. The Le Prieur√© building was originally the priory court of the Priory of Payerne. Under the Bernese it served as a wine cellar and vineyard house. The original parish church was probably dedicated to St. Maurice starting in the 9th Century. Between the 14th and 16th Century, it was rebuilt and consecrated to St. Germann. It burned down in 2001 and was rebuilt again in 2004. After the Reformation, the parish also included Paudex and Belmont, which became independent in 1897. The parsonage was built between 1594 and rebuilt in 1723. The church in Chamblandes dates from 1938, the one in La Rosiaz from 1953 and the Catholic Parish of St. Mauritius was created in 1954.

It was broadcast on Channel 4, running for three series from 2000 to 2004. Starring Moran, Bill Bailey and Tamsin Greig, the series is set in the eponymous London bookshop and follows the lives of its owner Bernard Black (Moran), his assistant Manny Bianco (Bailey) and their friend Fran Katzenjammer (Greig). The series was produced by Big Talk Productions, in association with Channel 4. The show was produced in a multiple-camera setup, and was primarily filmed at Teddington Studios in Teddington, London, with exterior scenes filmed on location on Leigh Street and the surrounding areas in Bloomsbury. The first episode was broadcast on 29 September 2000 and a total of three series were made, the final episode airing on 15 April 2004. Black Books was a critical success, winning a number of awards, including two BAFTAs for Best Situation Comedy in 2001 and 2005 and a Bronze Rose at the Festival Rose d'Or.  Synopsis  Bernard Black is the owner of Black Books, a small bookshop. The series revolves around the lives of Bernard, Manny and Fran. A central theme is Bernard's persona of a grouchy and misanthropic shopkeeper who has a hatred of the outside world and all the people who inhabit it, except for his best friend, Fran, who initially ran a trendy bric-a-brac shop, Nifty Gifty, next- door to the shop. Bernard displays little interest or knowledge in retail (or, indeed, anything outside drinking, smoking and reading) and actively avoids having to interact with anyone, even inside his shop, as he has a seething dislike towards his customers who treat his bookshop more like a personal library. It is suggested that Fran and Bernard once slept together, but now they remain content to be friends, sharing a love of smoking heavily and drinking to excess. Fran otherwise is a hopeless romantic. Manny is introduced in the first episode as an angst-ridden accountant who enters the bookshop seeking The Little Book of Calm. During a drunken night out, Bernard offers him a job as a shop assistant and a room above the shop if he will do Bernard's accounts for him. Sobering up, Bernard realises Manny's optimistic nature is not suited to this \\"kind of operation\\". Fran, however, seeing that Manny is good for Bernard, forces Bernard to let him stay. Many episodes are driven by Manny and Fran's attempts to force Bernard into a more socially acceptable lifestyle. Their efforts usually result in chaos, sucking them back into Bernard's cynical view of the world. The bookshop, which also doubles as Manny and Bernard's residence, is frequently depicted as being in an unlivable state of dirtiness and often inhabited by animals and other unidentified creatures, while disorder is a frequent aspect of the running of the shop. Manny's attempts to improve both the shop and the residence often fail.  Cast  The series revolves around the three main characters of Bernard Ludwig Black (Dylan Moran), Manny Bianco (Bill Bailey) and Fran Katzenjammer (Tamsin Greig), who all appeared in every episode. Supporting characters appear briefly in single episodes, while the show also featured several guest stars, such as actors Simon Pegg, Martin Freeman, and writer Graham Linehan.  Production  Collinge & Clark bookshop, used for exterior shots in the series A pilot for the show was featured in the 1998 Channel 4 sitcom festival in Riverside Studios. This early version was decidedly darker, revolving around Bernard's, and later Manny's, decision to commit suicide. It featured Manny (surname Zimmerman in reference to Bob Dylan) and the Fran character as Valerie, a philosophy lecturer. The pilot was an original creation of Moran's and the series was his first creation as a writer for a television series. Linehan, co-writer of the earlier Channel 4 sitcom Father Ted, joined at the outset to co-write the series with Moran at the suggestion of producer William Burdett-Coutts after Linehan saw the pilot and had seen Moran performing in Dublin. The characters were Moran's original creation, created over a month- long process he calls \\"spitballing\\", which is talking spontaneously to each other in character. The concept of Bernard owning a bookshop came about because of Moran's view of bookshops as doomed enterprises. Moran said \\"Running a second-hand bookshop is a guaranteed commercial failure. It's a whole philosophy. There were bookshops that I frequented and I was always struck by the loneliness and doggedness of these men who piloted this death ship\\", while Linehan said his belligerent personality reflected a sign he once saw in a bookshop stating \\"Please put the books anywhere you like because we've got nothing better to do than put them back\\". Moran said of the series, \\"We just wanted to cram as much elaborate stupidity into a half-hour that could make it be coherent and that you would believe\\". The fictional address for the bookshop is Black Books, 13 Little Bevan Street, Bloomsbury, London WC1. Manny also states the shop is located \\"just off Russell Square\\". The exterior scenes of the bookshop were filmed outside a real bookshop, albeit a smaller one, called Collinge & Clark, located at 13 Leigh Street, Bloomsbury. The audio commentary for Shaun of the Dead states that Black Books is considered by the producers to be a sister show of the 1999 Channel 4 sitcom Spaced, also produced by Nira Park. The show features several actors from Spaced, while in one episode Manny is heard speaking to Twist Morgan, a character from Spaced. Simon Pegg guest-starred as Bill Bailey's boss in another episode, an inversion of their roles in Spaced; Nick Frost appeared at the beginning of the episode \\"The Big Lockout\\" to install a new security system for the shop, though lost Manny's attention when he spotted a Subbuteo player in his hair; Kevin Cecil, one of the Black Books writers, appeared in Spaced playing the character of Harris; Jessica Stevenson made an appearance as a friend of Fran's, who was trying to help her live a healthier lifestyle with attempts to change her diet and get her to exercise more; Peter Serafinowicz played a radio broadcaster whose dulcet tones reading the shipping forecast drove Fran wild with desire; Omid Djalili appeared in \\"He's Leaving Home\\" as an opportunistic photographer; Rob Brydon appeared in Season 2's episode \\"The Fixer\\". Both Lucy Davis (The Office, Shaun of the Dead) and Olivia Colman (Peep Show, Hot Fuzz) appeared in Season 3's episode \\"Elephants and Hens\\".  Episodes  = Original unaired pilot = = Series 1 (2000) = = Series 2 (2002) = = Series 3 (2004) =  Awards and reception  Black Books won the BAFTA for Best Situation Comedy in 2001 and 2005, and won a Bronze Rose at the Festival Rose d'Or of Montreux in 2001. It also received nominations for British Comedy Awards and the Irish Film and Television Awards. According to Allan Brown, writing for The Times in August 2005, the show was \\"killed off after three hugely popular series\\". In Channel 4's \\"The World's Greatest Comedy Characters\\" poll, Bernard was voted 19th. The show ranked 58th out of 100 in the BBC's Britain's Best Sitcom poll in 2004. Legacy When asked by Digital Spy in 2015 about the show possibly returning, Moran replied saying \\"No, no, no, no! No! Does that answer the question, no!\\" and stated that he'd rather focus on new projects. He also said that he'd never do another studio sitcom again.  Notes   References  * *  External links   * * .

Note this is the Ned Christie posse Gunslinger and gunfighter are words used historically to refer to people in the American Old West who had gained a reputation of being dangerous with a gun and had participated in gunfights and shootouts. Gunman was a more common term used for these individuals in the 19th and early 20th century. Today, the term \\"gunslinger\\" is more or less used to denote someone who is quick on the draw with a pistol, but can also refer to riflemen and shotgun messengers. The gunfighter is also one of the most popular characters in the Western genre and has appeared in associated films, video games, and literature. The gunfighter could be a lawman, outlaw, cowboy, or shooting exhibitionist, but was more commonly a hired gun who made a living with his weapons in the Old West.  Origin of the term  The term \\"gun slinger\\" was used in the Western film Drag Harlan (1920).The terms \\"gunslinger\\" and \\"showdown\\" were unknown in the Wild West. Gunslinger (or Gun Slinger) The word was soon adopted by other Western writers, such as Zane Grey, and became common usage. In his introduction to The Shootist (1976), author Glendon Swarthout says \\"gunslinger\\" and \\"gunfighter\\" are modern terms, and the more authentic terms for the period would have been \\"gunman\\", \\"pistoleer\\", \\"shootist,\\" or \\"bad man\\" (sometimes written as \\"badman\\"). Swarthout seems to have been correct about \\"gunslinger\\", but the term \\"gunfighter\\" existed in several newspapers in the 1870s, and as such the term existed in the 19th century.Rosa (1969) vi. Bat Masterson used the term \\"gunfighter\\" in the newspaper articles which he wrote about the lawmen and outlaws whom he had known. However, Joseph Rosa noted that, even though Masterson used the term \\"gunfighter\\", he \\"preferred the term 'mankiller when discussing these individuals.Rosa (1969) vii. Clay Allison (1841‚Äì1887), a notorious New Mexico and Texas gunman and cattleman, originated the term \\"shootist\\".Chuck Parsons, Clay Allison: Portrait of a Shootist (Seagraves, Texas: Pioneer, 1983) = Usage = Often, the term has been applied to men who would hire out for contract killings or at a ranch embroiled in a range war where they would earn \\"fighting wages\\". Others, like Billy the Kid, were notorious bandits, and still others were lawmen like Pat Garrett and Wyatt Earp. A gunfighter could be an outlaw‚Äîa robber or murderer who took advantage of the wilderness of the frontier to hide from genteel society and to make periodic raids on it. The gunfighter could also be an agent of the state, archetypically a lone avenger, but more often a sheriff, whose duty was to face the outlaw and bring him to justice or to personally administer it. There were also a few historical cowboys who were actual gunfighters, such as the outlaw cowboy gang who participated in the bloody Skeleton Canyon Massacre.  Depiction in culture  The Great Train Robbery Gunslingers frequently appear as stock characters in Western movies and novels, along with cowboys. Often, the hero of a Western meets his opposite \\"double\\", a mirror of his own evil side that he has to destroy. Western gunslinger heroes are portrayed as local lawmen or enforcement officers, ranchers, army officers, cowboys, territorial marshals, nomadic loners, or skilled fast-draw artists. They are normally masculine persons of integrity and principle ‚Äì courageous, moral, tough, solid, and self-sufficient, maverick characters (often with trusty sidekicks), possessing an independent and honorable attitude (but often characterized as slow-talking). September 11, 2014 They are depicted as similar to a knight-errant, wandering from place to place with no particular direction, often facing curious and hostile enemies, while saving individuals or communities from those enemies in terms of chivalry. The Western hero usually stands alone and faces danger on his own, commonly against lawlessness, with an expert display of his physical skills (roping, gun-play, horse-handling, pioneering abilities, etc.). In films, the gunslinger often possesses a nearly superhuman speed and skill with the revolver. Twirling pistols, lightning draws, and trick shots are standard fare for the gunmen of the big screen. In the real world, however, gunmen who relied on flashy tricks and theatrics died quickly, and most gunslingers took a much more practical approach to their weapons. Real gunslingers did not shoot to disarm or to impress, but to kill. September 22, 2014 Another classic bit of cinema that is largely a myth is the showdown at high noon, where two well-matched gunslingers agree to meet for a climactic formal duel. These duels did occasionally happen, as in the case of the Luke Short ‚Äì Jim Courtright duel, but gunfights were typically more spontaneous, a fight that turned deadly when one side reached for a weapon, and no one knew who actually won the fight for several minutes until the air finally cleared of smoke. Gunfights could be won by simple distraction, or pistols could be emptied as gunmen fought from behind cover without injury. When a gunman did square off, it rarely was with another gunfighter. Gunslingers usually gave each other a wide berth, and it was uncommon for two well-known gunslingers to face off. The gunslinger's reputation often was as valuable as any skills possessed. In Western films and books, young toughs often challenge experienced gunmen with the hopes of building a reputation, but this rarely happened in real life. A strong reputation was enough to keep others civil and often would spare a gunfighter from conflict. Even other gunslingers were likely to avoid any unnecessary confrontation. In the days of the Old West, tales tended to grow with repeated telling, and a single fight might grow into a career-making reputation. For instance, the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral made legends of Wyatt Earp and the Outlaw Cowboy gang, but they were relatively minor figures before that conflict. Some gunslingers, such as Bat Masterson, actively engaged in self- promotion. Johnny Ringo built a reputation as a gunslinger while never taking part in a gunfight or killing unarmed civilians.  Fact and fiction  Gunfighters fighting off an Indian attack Most gunfights are portrayed in films or books as having two men square off, waiting for one to make the first move. This was rarely the case. Often, a gunfight was spur-of-the-moment, with one drawing his pistol, and the other reacting. Often it would develop into a shootout where both men bolted for cover.O'Neal (1979) p. 3 In popular folklore, men who held noteworthy reputations as a gunfighter were eager to match up against another gunman with the same reputation. On the contrary, in cases where two men held a similar reputation, both would avoid confrontation with one another whenever possible. They rarely took undue risks, and usually weighed their options before confronting another well-known gunman. This respect for one another is why most famous gunfights were rarely two or more well-known gunmen matched up against one another, but rather one notable gunman against a lesser-known opponent or opponents. These fights were usually close-up and personal, with a number of shots blasted from pistols, often resulting in innocent bystanders hit by bullets gone wild. Much of the time, it would be difficult to tell who had \\"won\\" the gunfight for several minutes, as the black powder smoke from the pistols cleared the air. How famous gunfighters died is as varied as each man. Many well-known gunfighters were so feared by the public because of their reputation that when they were killed, they died as a result of ambush rather than going down in a \\"blaze of glory\\". Others died secluded deaths either from old age or illness. Mythology and folklore often exaggerate the skills of famous gunfighters. Most of these historical figures were not known to be capable of trick shooting, nor did they necessarily have a reputation for precision sharpshooting. Such tropes that are frequently seen in Westerns include shooting the center of a coin, stylistic pistol twirling, glancing shots that intentionally only graze an opponent (the bullet through the hat being an example), shooting an opponent's belt buckle (thus dropping his pants), a bullet cutting the hangman's rope, or shooting the guns out of opponents' hands (typically as an alternative to killing). The last was debunked by Mythbusters as an impossibility, as unjacketed bullets tend to shatter into fragments that can hurt or even kill. Ed McGivern dispelled the myth of the inaccuracy of pistol fanning by shooting tight groups while fanning the revolver.Ed McGivern's Book of Fast and Fancy Revolver Shooting. Skyhorse Publishing Inc. .(2007) pp. 101‚Äì103 In Western movies, the characters' gun belts are often worn low on the hip and outer thigh, with the holster cut away around the pistol's trigger and grip for a smooth, fast draw. This type of holster is a Hollywood anachronism. Fast-draw artists can be distinguished from other movie cowboys because their guns will often be tied to their thigh. Long before holsters were steel-lined, they were soft and supple for comfortable all-day wear. A gunfighter would use tie-downs to keep his pistol from catching on the holster while drawing. Most of the time, gunfighters would just hide their pistols in their pockets and waistbands. June 7, 2012 Wild Bill Hickok popularized the butt-forward holster type, which worked better on horseback. Other gunfighters would use bridgeport rigs that gave a faster and easier draw. Revolvers were a popular weapon to gunfighters who were horsemen, cowboys, and lawmen because of their concealability and effectiveness on horseback. The Winchester rifle was also a popular weapon among gunfighters. Dubbed the \\"Gun that Won the West\\", it was widely used during the settlement of the American frontier. Shotguns were also a popular weapon for \\"express messengers\\" and guards, especially those on stagecoaches and trains who were in charge of overseeing and guarding a valuable private shipment. Quick draw and hip shooting was a rare skill in the West, September 20, 2011 and only a handful of historically known gunslingers were known to be fast, such as Luke Short, John Wesley Hardin, and Wild Bill Hickok. Shooting a pistol with one hand is normally associated with gunslingers, and is also a standard for them of the era to carry two guns and fire ambidextrously. Capt. Jonathan R. Davis carried two revolvers in his iconic gunfight, while Jesse James himself carried over half a dozen revolvers in many of his gunfights. Gunfighters King Fisher, John Wesley Hardin, Ben Thompson, Billy the Kid, Wild Bill Hickok and Pat Garrett all died as a result of ambush, killed by men who feared them because of their reputation. Gunmen Kid Curry, Jim Courtright, Dallas Stoudenmire and Dave Rudabaugh were killed in raging gun battles, much as portrayed in films about the era, and usually against more than one opponent. Bill Longley and Tom Horn were executed. Famed gunman Clay Allison died in a wagon accident. Gunmen Wyatt Earp, Bat Masterson, Bass Reeves, Commodore Perry Owens, and Luke Short all died of natural causes, living out their lives on reputation and avoiding conflict in secluded retirement. Gunfighter and lawman Frank Eaton, known as \\"Pistol Pete\\" lived into old age and gained further fame, before his death at age 97, by becoming the mascot for Oklahoma A&M; College (now Oklahoma State University). Rare are the gunfighters who, like William Sidney \\"Cap\\" Light, died accidentally by their own hand.  Famous gunfights  The image of a Wild West filled with countless gunfights was a myth generated primarily by dime- novel authors in the late 19th century. An estimate of 20,000 men in the American West were killed by gunshot between 1866 and 1900, and over 21,586 total casualties during the American Indian Wars from 1850 to 1890. The most notable and well-known took place in the states/territories of Arizona, New Mexico, Kansas, Oklahoma, and Texas. November 21, 2011 Actual gunfights in the Old West were very rare, very few and far between, but when gunfights did occur, the cause for each varied. Some were simply the result of the heat of the moment, while others were longstanding feuds, or between bandits and lawmen. Lawless violence such as range wars like the Lincoln County War and clashes with Indians were also a cause. Some of these shootouts became famous, while others faded into history with only a few accounts surviving. To prevent gunfights from happening, many cities in the American frontier, such as Dodge City and Tombstone, put up a local ordinance to prohibit firearms in the area. The Gunfight at the OK Corral is a famous example of a real-life western shootout, between the Earp Brothers together with Doc Holliday, and the Clanton-McLaury gang. It lasted only 30 seconds, contrary to many movie adaptations. The gunfight itself did not actually happen in the corral, but in a vacant lot outside of it. The shooting started when Billy Clanton and Frank McLaury cocked their pistols. Both parties simultaneously drew their guns, which added to the confusion of who fired first. It is not known who fired the first shot, but Wyatt's bullet was the first to hit, tearing through Frank McLaury's belly and sending McLaury's own shot wild through Wyatt's coattail. Billy Clanton fired at Virgil, but his shot also went astray when he was hit with Morgan's shot through his ribcage. Billy Claiborne ran as soon as shots were fired and was already out of sight. Ike Clanton panicked as well and ran towards Wyatt pleading for his life. \\"Go to fighting or get away!\\", Wyatt yelled and watched Ike desert his brother Billy and run. Doc instantly killed Tom with blasts from his shotgun. Frank was running to Fremont Street, and he challenged Holliday for killing his brother, but Doc dropped his shotgun, drew his pistol, and shot Frank in the right temple.Tombstone Nugget; October 27, 1881 article Wounded and dying, Billy Clanton fired blindly into the gun smoke encircling him, striking Virgil's leg. Wyatt responded by sending several rounds into Billy. On April 14, 1881, lawman Dallas Stoudenmire participated in a gunfight in El Paso, Texas which many dubbed the Four Dead in Five Seconds Gunfight, in which he killed three of the four fatalities with his twin .44 caliber Colt revolvers. One of those killed was an innocent Mexican bystander.El Paso Times article documenting the event Less than a year after these incidents, he would kill as many as six more men in gunfights while in the line of duty. Another well-documented gunfight resulted in the most kills by one person in a single event, when Capt. Jonathan R. Davis shot eleven bandits single-handedly on 19 December 1854.Fournier, Richard. \\"Mexican War Vet Wages Deadliest Gunfight in American History\\", VFW Magazine (January 2012), p. 30. Unknown to Davis and his companions, a band of robbers was lying in wait in the canyon brush near the trail. They were a typically diverse and motley group of Gold Rush bandits: two Americans, one Frenchman, two Britons, five Sydney Ducks, and four Mexicans. As Captain Davis and his companions trudged on foot, the bandit gang charged out of the brush, pistols flaming. James McDonald died instantly, without time to draw his revolver or react in any way. Dr. Bolivar managed to get his six-shooter out and fire twice at the highwaymen before he dropped, badly wounded. Captain Davis later described himself as being \\"in a fever of excitement at the time.\\" Unfazed, he stood his ground, pulling out both pistols and firing a barrage at the charging outlaws. He shot down his assailants, one after another. The outlaws' bullets tore at Davis's clothing, but caused only two slight flesh wounds. Within moments, seven of the bandits were dead or dying on the ground and Davis's pistols were empty. Four of the remaining robbers now closed in on the captain to finish him off. Davis whipped out his Bowie knife, and quickly warded off the thrusts from the two of the bandits. He stabbed one of them to death; the other he disarmed by knocking the knife from his grasp and slicing off his nose and a finger of his right hand. The two last attackers were the men who had been wounded in a previous bandit raid. Despite their weakened condition, they foolishly approached Davis with drawn knives. The captain reacted in an instant. Slashing with his heavy Bowie, he killed them both. On December 1, 1884, a town sheriff named Elfego Baca came face-to-face against 80 gunmen which became known as the Frisco shootout. The battle started when Baca arrested a cowboy who had shot him. In turn the cowboy called upon 80 of his associates to murder Baca. Baca took refuge in an adobe house, and over the course of a 36-hour siege, the gunmen put 400 bullet holes in the house (some accounts say a total of 4,000 shots) without touching Baca. He in turn killed 4 of them and wounded 8. When the shooting was over as the attackers finally ran out of ammo, Baca strolled out of the house unscathed. Baca went on to a distinguished career as a lawyer and legislator and died in his bed in 1945, age 80. In January 1887 Commodore Perry Owens took office as Sheriff of Apache County, Arizona. He sent two deputies to arrest Ike Clanton. Clanton had instigated the Gunfight at the OK Corral and was charged with the later ambush shooting of Virgil Earp. Wyatt Earp searched for Ike Clanton in his vendetta, but never found him ‚Äì Ike moved north to Apache County to continue rustling cattle and killing. Owens' two deputies killed Ike Clanton; Phin Clanton was arrested; three other gang members were killed; and the Clanton gang was done. Then Sheriff Owens turned his attention to the Blevins family, the other rustling gang in the county. In June 1887 Old Man Blevins disappeared, presumably killed by the Tewksbury faction of the Pleasant Valley War. The Blevins sons searched for their father and in August Hamp Blevins and another were killed by the Tewksbury side. So Andy Blevins (aka Cooper) ambushed and killed John Tewksbury and Bill Jacobs in revenge. Blevins returned to Holbrook and was heard bragging about his killings. Sheriff Owens had inherited a warrant for Andy Blevins' (Cooper) arrest for horse theft so he rode to Holbook on September 2, 1887. Sheriff Owens had hunted buffalo for the railroad and could shoot his Winchester from the hip with great accuracy. Cradling his Winchester rifle in his arm, Sheriff Owens knocked on the Blevins' door. Andy Blevins answered with a pistol in hand, the lawman told him to come out, that he had a warrant for arrest. Blevins refused and tried to close the door. Owens shot his rifle from his hip through the door, hitting Andy Blevins in the stomach. Andy's half-brother, John Blevins, pushed a pistol out the door to Owens' right and fired at the Sheriff. He missed and Owens shot John Blevins in the arm, putting him out of the fight. Owens saw Andy Blevins in the window moving to shoot back. Owens shot through the wall, striking Andy in the right hip ‚Äì he died that night. Mose Roberts, boarding with the family, jumped out of a side window with a pistol. Sheriff Owens shot him through his back and chest, killing him. Fifteen-year-old Samuel Houston Blevins ran out the front door, with his brother's revolver, and yelled \\"I'll get him.\\" His mother ran out after him. Owens shot and Sam fell backward, dying in his mother's arms. The shootout took less than one minute and made Owens a legend. In eight months Sheriff Owens had rid Apache County of two notorious gangs of rustlers and killers. In many early western films and literature, Native Americans were often portrayed as savages; having conflicts and battles against gunfighters and white settlements. According to the U.S. Bureau of the Census (1894), an estimate of 19,000 white men, women and children were killed while the Indians killed numbered between 30,000 and 45,000 casualties during the American Indian Wars. Gunfighters in history did fight Native Americans. Among them was civilian Billy Dixon, who made one of the longest recorded sniper kills, by shooting an Indian off his horse almost a mile away with his Sharps rifle, during a standoff in the Second Battle of Adobe Walls. General George S. Patton himself had a gunfight when he was a young second lieutenant chasing Pancho Villa all over northern Mexico in 1916. Patton and 10 enlisted men had been sent to San Miguelito Ranch to look for Villa, who had recently raided the city of Columbus, New Mexico. Patton positioned his men by the south gate and was making his way up to the north gate when a trio of Villa's men came into the ranch on horseback. Patton drew his obsolete single-action Colt Peacemaker revolver and shot two of the men. The first man had been fatally wounded in the exchange and tried to draw his pistol before Patton killed him with a single shot. After his troops took down the remaining outlaw, Patton tied the three dead men to the hood of his touring car and drove the bodies back to his commanding officer. = Real-life Wild West duels = Wild Bill Hickok after killing Davis Tutt in a duel. Harper's New Monthly Magazine, February 1867 The image of two gunslingers with violent reputation squaring off in a street is a Hollywood invention. However, face to face fast draw shootouts did occur in the real West. June 25, 2004 These duels were first recorded in the South, brought by emigrants to the American Frontier as a crude form of the \\"code duello,\\" a highly formalized means of solving disputes between gentlemen with swords or guns that had its origins in European chivalry. By the second half of the 19th century, few Americans still fought duels to solve their problems, and became a thing of the past in the United States by the start of the 20th century. Writer Wyatt- Brown in his book \\"Southern Honor: Ethics and Behavior in the Old South\\" described dueling in the American frontier as a \\"custom\\", and was primarily used for teenage disputes, rise in ranking, status and scapegoating.Wyatt- Brown, Bertram. 1982. Southern Honor: Ethics and Behavior in the Old South. New York: Oxford University Press. Pages 167 and 350‚Äì351. The most famous and well-recorded duel occurred on 21 July 1865, in Springfield, Missouri. Wild Bill Hickok and Davis Tutt quarreled over cards and decided to have a gunfight. They arranged to walk towards each other at 6 p.m. Wild Bill's armed presence caused the crowd to immediately scatter to the safety of nearby buildings, leaving Tutt alone in the northwestern corner of the square. When they were about 50 yards apart, both men drew their guns. The two fired at the same time, but Hickok's shot hit Tutt in the heart, while Tutt's shot missed. This was the first recorded example of two men taking part in a quick-draw duel. The following month Hickok was acquitted after pleading self-defense. The first story of the shootout was detailed in an article in Harper's Magazine in 1867, and became a staple of the gunslinger legend. The famous lawman Wyatt Earp gave an account of having participated a duel once during his vendetta. While in the South Pass of the Dragoon Mountains, Earp's posse found one of the outlaw cowboys named \\"Indian Charlie\\" Cruz. One account says that after the party recognized Cruz, they chased him down and a gunfight ensued. The party managed to capture Cruz and he confessed to have taken part in Morgan's murder, and that he identified Stilwell, Hank Swilling, Curly Bill and Johnny Ringo as other of Morgan's killers. During that time, Wyatt allowed Cruz to keep his revolver to \\"give him a chance to fight like a man.\\" After the confession, Wyatt told Cruz to draw, challenging him to a duel, and the posse counted to three before Wyatt gunned Cruz down. The Langford - Peel shootout occurred on July 22, 1867 between gunmen John Bull and Langford Peel.DeArment, Robert K. Deadly Dozen: Forgotten Gunfighters of the Old West, Volume 3. University of Oklahoma Press; First edition (March 15, 2010). p. 23-24. Doc Holliday himself had a duel in a saloon in Las Vegas, New Mexico. One of the women who worked there had an ex-boyfriend named Mike Gordon who had just been discharged from the Army. Gordon wanted her to stop working. When she told him to leave her alone, he became angry, went outside the saloon, and started shooting out the windows with his pistol. As bullets went through the saloon, Doc unflinching, holstered his Colt Peacemaker revolver, and walked outside. Gordon then started shooting at him but missed. Holliday then drew his pistol and shot Gordon at long range with one shot. He then went back to the saloon. Gordon died the next day and Holliday fled. Doc Holliday has also been credited with wounding and shooting a pistol out of saloon owner Milt Joyce's hand when he tried to brandish it at Holliday. Another well-known duel in the American West happened in Fort Worth, Texas, and was known as the Luke Short-Jim Courtright Duel. Timothy Isaiah \\"Longhair Jim\\" Courtright was running the T.I.C. Commercial agency in Fort Worth, which provided \\"protection\\" to gambling dens and saloons in return for a portion of their profits. At the same time, Luke Short, a former friend of Courtright's, was running the White Elephant Saloon and Jim was trying to get Short to utilize his services. But the Dodge City gunfighter told Courtright to \\"go to Hell,\\" that he could do anything that was necessary to take care of his business. On February 8, 1887, the two quarreled, and with Bat Masterson at Short's side, Courtright and Short dueled in the street. They drew their pistols at close range, and Short fired first, blowing off Courtright's thumb. Courtright attempted the \\"border shift\\", a move where a gunfighter switches his gun to his uninjured hand, but he was too slow. Short shot him in the chest, killing him. The Long Branch Saloon Shootout, involving Levi Richardson, a buffalo hunter, and \\"Cockeyed Frank\\" Loving, a professional gambler, happened on April 5, 1879. Richardson had developed some affection for Loving's wife Mattie, and the two began to argue about her. In the saloon, Frank sat down at a long table, Richardson turned around and took a seat at the same table. The two were then heard speaking in low voices. After the conversation, Richardson drew his pistol, and Loving drew his in response. The Long Branch Saloon was then filled with smoke. Dodge City Marshal Charlie Bassett, who was in Beatty & Kelley's Saloon, heard the shots and came running. Both men were still standing, although Richardson had fired five shots from his gun and Loving's Remington No. 44 was empty. Deputy Sheriff Duffey threw Richardson down in a chair and took his gun, while Bassett disarmed Loving. Richardson then got up and started toward the billiard table, when he fell to the floor with a fatal gunshot in the chest, as well as a shot through the side and another through the right arm. Frank Loving, who had only a slight scratch on the hand, was immediately taken to jail. Two days later, the coroner's inquest ruled that the killing had been in self-defense and Loving was immediately released. On March 9, 1877, gamblers Jim Levy and Charlie Harrison argued over a game of cards in a saloon in Cheyenne, Wyoming. They met in an alley following an argument about a card game. Harrison shot first, but missed. Levy aimed carefully and hit Harrison, who died a week later.Shoot-out (1877) Old West Gunfights - Page 2 Legends of America Not as well known today but famous in his time was the dapper, derby-wearing train robber Marion Hedgepeth, who despite his swell appearance, \\"was a deadly killer and one of the fastest guns in the Wild, Wild West\\". William Pinkerton, whose National Detective Agency had sought to capture Hedgepeth and his gang for years, noted that Hedgepeth once gunned down another outlaw who had already unholstered his pistol before Hedgepath had drawn his revolver. The infamous assassin Tom Horn was also said to have participated in a duel with a second lieutenant from the Mexican Army, due to a dispute with a prostitute when he was twenty-six years old.Desert Evening News November 20, 1903 Gunfighters Jim Levy and Tom Carberry became infamous for participating in at least two quick draw duels in their lifetimes.Jim Levy - The Jewish GunfighterMcGrath, Roger D. Gunfighters, Highwaymen & Vigilantes: Violence on the Frontier. University of California Press (March 23, 1987). pp. 99- 100. .  Living on reputation  Most Old West men who were labeled as being \\"gunfighters\\" did not kill nearly as many men in gunfights as they were given credit for, if any at all. They were often labeled as such due to one particular instance, which developed from rumors into them having been involved in many more events than they actually were. Often their reputation was as much \\"self-promotion\\" as anything else; such was the case of Bat Masterson. Wyatt Earp with his brothers Morgan and Virgil along with Doc Holliday killed three outlaw Cowboys in the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral in Tombstone, Arizona Territory. He has been said to have been involved in more than one hundred gunfights in his lifetime. But Prof. Bill O'Neal cites just five incidents in his Encyclopedia of Western Gunfighters. Earp expressed his dismay about the controversy that followed him his entire life. He wrote in a letter to John Hays Hammond on May 21, 1925, that \\"notoriety had been the bane of my life.\\" After his brother Virgil was maimed in an ambush and Morgan was assassinated by hidden assailants, the men suspected of involvement were provided alibis by fellow Cowboys and released without trial. Wyatt and his brother Warren set out on a vendetta ride to locate and kill those they felt were responsible. Wyatt has been portrayed in a number of films and books as a fearless Western hero. He is often viewed as the central character and hero of the Gunfight at the O.K. Corral, at least in part because he was the only one who was not wounded or killed. In fact, his brother, Tombstone Marshal and Deputy U.S. Marshal Virgil Earp had considerably more experience with weapons and combat as a Union soldier in the Civil War, and in law enforcement as a sheriff, constable, and marshal. As city marshal, Virgil made the decision to disarm the Cowboys in Tombstone and requested Wyatt's assistance. But because Wyatt outlived Virgil and due to a creative biography, Wyatt Earp: Frontier Marshal published two years after Wyatt's death, Wyatt became famous and the subject of various movies, television shows, biographies and works of fiction. There are no records to support the reputation that Johnny Ringo developed. Of the documented instances where Ringo killed men, they were unarmed, and there is no evidence to support his participation in a single gunfight. Others deserved the reputation associated with them. Jim Courtright and Dallas Stoudenmire both killed several men in gunfights both as lawmen and as civilians.Metz, Leon Claire. 1979. Dallas Stoudenmire: El Paso Marshal. Norman, University of Oklahoma Press. 162 p. Clay Allison and Ben Thompson had well-deserved reputations.Cunningham, Sharon. ‚Äì \\"The Allison Clan ‚Äì A Visit\\"' . ‚Äì Western Outlaw. ‚Äì (Adobe Acrobat *.PDF document). At the same time, gunmen like Scott Cooley are all but unknown, when they actually led a life reflective of what most would consider a gunfighter to be. In other cases, certain gunfighters were possibly confused, over time, with being someone else with a similar name. The most well known of Butch Cassidy's Wild Bunch gang, the Sundance Kid, was in reality only known to have been in one shootout during his lifetime, and no gunfights. Some historians have since stated that it is possible that over time he was confused with another Wild Bunch member, Kid Curry, who was without a doubt the most dangerous member of the gang, having killed many lawmen and civilians during his lifetime before being killed himself. Hence, it is the Sundance Kid who is better known.  Outlaw or lawman  It is often difficult to separate lawmen of the Old West from outlaws of the Old West. In many cases, the term gunfighter was applied to constables. Despite idealistic portrayals in television, movies, and even in history books, very few lawmen/gunfighters could claim their law enforcement role as their only source of employment. Unlike contemporary peace officers, these lawmen generally pursued other occupations, often earning money as gamblers, business owners, or outlaws‚Äîas was the case with \\"Curly\\" Bill Brocius, who, while always referred to as an outlaw, served as a deputy sheriff under sheriff Johnny Behan. Many shootouts involving lawmen were caused by disputes arising from these alternative occupations, rather than the lawman's attempts to enforce the law. p.117 Tom Horn, historically cited as an assassin, served both as a deputy sheriff and as a Pinkerton detective, a job in which he shot at least three people as a killer for hire. Ben Thompson, best known as a gunfighter and gambler, was a very successful chief of police in Austin, Texas. King Fisher had great success as a county sheriff in Texas. Doc Holliday and Billy the Kid both wore badges as lawmen at least once. p.31 \\"Big\\" Steve Long served as deputy marshal for Laramie, Wyoming, while the entire time committing murders and forced theft of land deeds. A town with a substantial violent crime rate would often turn to a known gunman as their town marshal, chief, or sheriff, in the hopes that the gunman could stem the violence and bring order. Known gunmen/lawmen were generally effective, and in time the violence would subside, usually after the gunman/lawman had been involved in several shooting incidents, eventually leading to a substantial and well earned fear that kept everyone in line.Rosa (1969) p.7-8 At times they were hired by cattlemen or other prominent figures to serve as henchmen or enforcers during cattle wars. Although sanctioned by law enforcement officials, the gunmen were not always actually deputized. Sometimes, however, just to make things \\"official\\", they would go through the formality of deputization. A case in point: the service of the Jesse Evans Gang, and outlaw Jesse Evans himself, as agents for the Murphy-Dolan faction during the Lincoln County War. While technically working as lawmen, they were little more than hired guns. Usually, when a gunman was hired by a town as town marshal, they received the full support of the townspeople until order was restored, at which point the town would tactfully indicate it was time for a change to a less dangerous lawman who relied more on respect than fear to enforce the law. A good example was the 1882 decision by the El Paso, Texas, town council to dismiss Town Marshal Dallas Stoudenmire. He entered the council hall and dared the councilors to try to take his guns or his job, at which point they immediately changed their mind, saying he could keep his job. He resigned on his own a couple of days later. Legacy = Modern gunslinger = A cowboy action shooter brandishing his revolver People relive the Wild West both historically and in popular culture by participating in cowboy action shooting events, where each gunslinger adopts his or her own look representing a character from Western life in the late 1800s, and as part of that character, chooses an alias to go by. The sport originated in Southern California, USA, in the early 1980s but is now practiced in many places with several sanctioning organizations including the Single Action Shooting Society (SASS), Western Action Shootists Association (WASA), and National Congress of Old West Shooters (NCOWS), as well as others in the US and in other countries. There are different categories shooters can compete in. There's the gunfighter, frontiersman, classic cowboy and duelist ‚Äì each with its own specifications. July 03, 2008 Alongside the iconic cowboy, gunfighters have become a cultural image of the American people abroad, and also as an idealized image of violence, frontier justice, and adventure. Introduction and p. 63Microsoft Encarta 2007 edition: Cowboy Even outside of the Western genre, the term 'gunslinger' has been used in modern times to describe someone who is fast and accurate with pistols, either in real life or in other fictional action genre. Chapter 1 The quick draw which gunfighters help popularize, is still an important skill in the American military and law enforcement communities. = In popular culture = Gunfighters have been featured in media even outside the Western genre, often combined with other elements and genres, mainly science-fiction Space Westerns, steampunk, and the contemporary setting. Abilities, clothing and attitude associated with gunfighters are seen in many other genres. An example of these is Han shot first, in which Han Solo, a gunfighter-like protagonist in Star Wars, kills his opponent with a subtle, under-the-table draw.Howell, Peter, \\"At last, Han shot first\\", Toronto Star, May 12, 2006 He also wore his holster low on, and tied to, the thigh with a cutaway for the trigger. Roland Deschain from the fantasy series The Dark Tower is a gunfighter pitted against fantasy-themed monsters and enemies. Inspired by the \\"Man with No Name\\" and other spaghetti-western characters, he himself is detached or unsympathetic, often reacting as uncaring or angry at signs of cowardice or self-pity, yet he possesses a strong sense of heroism, often attempting to help those in need, a morality much seen in Westerns. Jonah Hex, from DC Comics, is a ruthless bounty hunter bound by a personal code of honor to protect and avenge the innocent. IGN ranked Jonah Hex the 73rd greatest comic book hero of all time. Throughout the DC Universe, Hex has been, on many occasions, transported from the Old West to the contemporary setting and beyond. Even in an unfamiliar territory and time period, Hex managed to outgun his enemies with more advanced weaponry. Two-Gun Kid is another comic book gunfighter from Marvel Comics. Skilled with revolvers, he has aided many super-heroes in future timelines, most notably She-Hulk.She- Hulk vol. 2, #3 (Feb. 2006). Many Japanese manga and anime have also adopted the western genre. Yasuhiro Nightow is known for creating the space western Trigun. The story's protagonist, Vash the Stampede, is a wandering gunslinger with a dark past. Unlike other violence-themed gunslingers, Vash carries a Shane-like pacifist attitude, and avoids killing men, even dangerous enemies. Behind him is the gun-toting priest named Nicholas D. Wolfwood, who carries with him a heavy machine gun and rocket launcher shaped like a cross. Nicholas is more violent than Vash, and the two would often argue about killing opponents. Other western genre themed manga and anime include Cowboy Bebop and Kino's Journey, who both incorporate knight-errant gunslinger themes. Modern- day western gunslingers have also appeared in recent Neo-Westerns. Raylan Givens from the television series Justified shares the same ambiguous moral code of an Old West sheriff, even using a fast draw to dispatch his enemies. The hitman Anton Chigurh from No Country For Old Men shares many elements of a hunted outlaw. Additionally, the comic book character Vigilante is a self- proclaimed gunfighter born in the 1940s.Action Comics #42 (November 1941) Mort Weisinger Gunfighters have also been featured in many video games, both in traditional Old West, and in contemporary and future settings. Colton White, the protagonist of 2005's best-selling western video game Gun. Another well- known video game Western protagonist is John Marston from Red Dead Redemption, who was nominated for 2010 Spike's Video Game Awards, as well as his dear friend Arthur Morgan in Red Dead Redemption 2. The New York Times stated: \\"he and his creators conjure such a convincing, cohesive and enthralling re- imagination of the real world that it sets a new standard for sophistication and ambition in electronic gaming.\\" The main character Caleb in the video games Blood and Blood II: The Chosen is also a former Old West gunfighter. Gunfighter is also a callsign for a group of two Apache Helicopters in the video game Medal of Honor. They appear on mission named \\"Gunfighters\\", and the player will act as Captain Brad \\"Hawk\\" Hawkins from 1st Aviation Regiment. Former professional American football quarterback Brett Favre was nicknamed \\"The Gunslinger\\" due to his rural, Southern upbringing and his wild, risky, quick-throwing play-style that led him to great success in the National Football League.

It is around long, and flows in a south-eastern direction from its source, the lake √ñveruman by the Norwegian border within the Scandinavian mountain range. For large parts, the European route E12, also known as Bl√• V√§gen (Blue Route), follows its path. It passes through Vindelfj√§llen Nature Reserve and Lake Storuman and drains into the Gulf of Bothnia on Sweden's east coast at the small town of Holmsund, and adjacent to the city of Ume√•. Its chief tributary is the Vindel River. In the 1950s, hydroelectricity developments were building reservoirs and dams throughout the country (see also: energy in Sweden), but concerns were being raised against the environmental impact of these power plants. In particular, there were heated discussions about the developments on the Ume River and Vindel River. This led in 1961 an agreement called the Peace of Sarek (), which prevented development on some rivers of the Vindel River and in exchange gave freedom to develop the other rivers, including the Ume River. The Ume River has since been extensively cultivated for hydroelectric power. Timber industry The sawmill on the north bank Development of the river around Baggb√∂le started with the arrival of Scottish immigrants James and Robert Dickson in the 1830s. They had built their timber business in the V√§rmland province but in the 1820s they constructed two large water powered sawmills. The sawmill at Baggb√∂le was the largest in Sweden that was powered by water.Baggbole Mansion, Vasterbottens Museum, retrieved 18 May 2014 So infamous were their methods that a new word in Swedish was derived from the name of \\"Baggb√∂le\\". The Swedish word baggb√∂leri is a pejorative term for reckless deforestation. The sawmills worked from May to October each year employing 170 workers.Baggbole , Umea.SE, retrieved 18 May 2014 The River Ume water-powered sawmill was under threat when steam power was introduced further south at Tunadal in Sweden in 1849. Twenty more steam powered Swedish saw mills were started within a decade. These sawmills were usually placed near ports and the former saw mills which had been positioned near water power were closed. The water powered saw mill on the River Ume was one of the last to close in 1884 when Holmsund was given a steam powered mill. In 1914 a power plant was built where the sawmill was. This facility was eventually sold to the city of Ume√• in 1947. Today the land used by Baggb√∂le sawmill is Arboretum Norr.

Under many different names, it gradually broadened its politics from a focus on women's suffrage to eventually become a left communist grouping. East London Federation of the WSPU It originated as the East London Federation of the Women's Social and Political Union (WSPU, better known as the Suffragettes). The East London Federation was founded by Dr Richard Pankhurst and Emmeline Pankhurst in 1893,Elizabeth Crawford, ‚ÄòBull , Amy Maud (1877‚Äì1953)‚Äô, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 accessed 1 January 2017 and differed from its parent organisation in being democratic and including men, such as George Lansbury.Mary Davis, Sylvia Pankhurst (Pluto Press, 1999) By this point, Sylvia had many disagreements with the route the WSPU was taking. She wanted an explicitly socialist organisation tackling wider issues than women's suffrage, aligned with the Independent Labour Party, based among working class people in the East End of London. She also wanted to focus on collective workers' action, not individual attacks on property. East London Federation of Suffragettes These and other differences, including personal ones, led to Sylvia's expulsion, along with the East London Federation, from the WSPU. In early 1914, they renamed themselves the East London Federation of Suffragettes (ELFS) and launched a newspaper, the Women's Dreadnought. At first, the group campaigned for universal suffrage and agitated among parliamentarians, with the assistance of Keir Hardie. But with the outbreak of World War I, they began also to attack participation in the war, supporting the positions of the Zimmerwald Conference. This view initially lost the group support, but they began work to ameliorate suffering in the East End. The ELFS got a chain of cost price restaurants set up, and itself set up a toy factory, free clinic and Montessori nursery. They also agitated for widow's pensions and dependent's allowances. Workers' Suffrage Federation As public opinion turned against the war, the group gained new support, and its newspaper increased its circulation. To reflect its now broader political positions, in March 1916 it renamed itself the Workers' Suffrage Federation (WSF). Similarly, in July 1917, the newspaper was renamed the Workers' Dreadnought. From the start of 1917, it adopted a new aim: \\"to secure Human Suffrage, namely, a Vote, for every Woman and Man of full age, and to win Social and Economic Freedom for the People\\".M. A. S. Shipway, Anti-Parliamentary Communism in Britain 1917-1945, vol.1, p.26 The WSF supported the 1916 Irish Rising and became a leading proponent of improved social welfare while continuing agitation for a universal franchise. As such, it opposed the Franchise Bill which ultimately gave women in Britain the vote in general elections as the restrictions on women voting were much stricter than those on men. Despite its evolving position, during much of 1917, the party remained focused on campaigning for universal suffrage, and welcomed the February Revolution in Russia largely on the basis that it would introduce an Assembly on this basis.M. A. S. Shipway, Anti-Parliamentary Communism in Britain 1917-1945, vol.1, pp.27-28 The party enthusiastically supported the October Revolution of 1917. When, in January 1918, the new Bolshevik government in Russia dissolved the Assembly, the group now welcomed its replacement by the All-Russian Workers', Soldiers', Sailors' and Peasants' Council and now argued that Soviets were the most democratic form of government.M. A. S. Shipway, Anti-Parliamentary Communism in Britain 1917-1945, vol.1, p.30 In May 1918, the party's conference agreed to again rename the group, now as the Workers' Socialist Federation, reflecting its growing opposition to Parliamentarism. The group supported the Socialist Labour Party's (SLP) three candidates at the 1918 United Kingdom general election, along with independent socialists David Kirkwood and John Maclean, and permitted individual members to campaign for Labour Party candidates.M. A. S. Shipway, Anti-Parliamentary Communism in Britain 1917-1945, vol.1, pp.31-33 At the party's conference in June 1919, it voted to ignore all future elections, and also to follow the advice of the Third International by opening discussions with other socialist groups with the aim of forming a single communist party.M. A. S. Shipway, Anti- Parliamentary Communism in Britain 1917-1945, vol.1, p.35 As a result, it organised meetings in London later in the month, which were attended by the WSF, SLP, British Socialist Party and South Wales Socialist Society. Pankhurst wrote to Lenin, asking for his support for the party's opposition to standing in elections; to her disappointment, he argued that this reflected a \\"lack of revolutionary experience\\", although he also stated that the issue was a secondary one, and should not prevent the WSF from becoming part of a new communist party.M. A. S. Shipway, Anti-Parliamentary Communism in Britain 1917-1945, vol.1, pp.36-37 While not changing its views, the WSF accordingly deprioritised this policy in the hope of furthering the unity negotiations.M. A. S. Shipway, Anti-Parliamentary Communism in Britain 1917-1945, vol.1, p.42 During this period, the WSF led campaigns against the British government's anti-Bolshevik activities, with the slogan \\"Hands off Russia\\". It also began working with the London Workers' Committee. By June 1920, it had become apparent that the unity negotiations would not satisfy all the participants, as they were unable to agree whether the new communist party should attempt to affiliate to the Labour Party. The WSF instead called an \\"Emergency Conference\\", inviting all the socialist parties which opposed affiliation to Labour: the SLP, SWSS and various local organisations.M. A. S. Shipway, Anti- Parliamentary Communism in Britain 1917-1945, vol.1, pp.43-44 Communist Party (British Section of the Third International) The conference was held in June 1920 but was attended only by WSF members, some local groups and independents. It agreed to form the Communist Party (British Section of the Third International) (CP(BSTI)) and voted to boycott future unity meetings. Instead, it attempted to interest the SLP in a merger. They proposed opening discussions with the Socialist Party of Great Britain and the British Section of the International Socialist Labour Party, but then withdrew, leaving the exercise a failure. However, the CP(BSTI) did gain influence in the Scottish Communist Labour Party and the tiny Communist Party of South Wales and the West of England was formed on their platform. The BSP had meanwhile formed the Communist Party of Great Britain (CPGB). Lenin called on other communists to join the new party, and the CP(BSTI) was one of the groups covered in his work Left-Wing Communism: An Infantile Disorder. Although Workers Dreadnaught was openly critical of this pamphlet, Pankhurst attended the Second Congress of the Comintern, where Lenin personally persuaded Sylvia that her objections were less important than unity, and that it would be possible to maintain an anti-Parliamentary opposition within the CPGB. Pankhurst called a conference, inviting the English Shop Stewards' and Workers' Committee Movement, the Communist Labour Party, the Scottish Workers' Committee and the Glasgow Communist Group. She was arrested in September, but with the support of Willie Gallacher, all the groups at the conference bar Guy Aldred's Glasgow Communist Group agreed to merge with the Communist Party of Great Britain in January 1921. After a period, Pankhurst was instructed to place the Workers' Dreadnought under the control of the party, which she refused to do. In particular, she criticised the Communist Party members of the Poplar Board of Guardians for agreeing to reduce outdoor Poor Law relief, which was cited as the reason for her expulsion from the CPGB in September 1921. While the idea of democratic centralism, newly accepted as the governing principle for the CPGB, would seem to suggest that she was in breach of discipline, Labour Monthly continued as the personal organ of R. P. Dutt and even received subsidies. Communist Workers' Party Pankhurst reorganised her group of supporters around Workers Dreadnought, and began criticising the admittance of trade unions to the Red International of Labour Unions, and warning that they felt the Bolsheviks were beginning to \\"slip to the right\\". The group instead advocated grouping together Industrial Unions under the auspices of the \\"All- Workers Revolutionary Union\\": intended as \\"One Big Union\\" which would unite all workers in a struggle against capitalism.M. A. S. Shipway, Anti- Parliamentary Communism in Britain 1917-1945, vol.1, p.56 This achieved little, but in 1923 the party formed the Unemployed Workers' Organisation, modeled on the Industrial Workers of the World. Initially, this attracted numerous former members of the National Unemployed Workers' Movement, including its whole Edmonton and South West Ham branches. By the start of 1924, it claimed 3,000 members, mostly in London but also with a branch in Leeds.M. A. S.

The problem appeared in Martin Gardner's Mathematical Games column in the August 1977 issue of Scientific American. It was solved in 1993‚Äì94 by a large joint computer project co-ordinated by Derek Atkins, Michael Graff, Arjen Lenstra and Paul Leyland. More than 600 volunteers contributed CPU time from about 1,600 machines (two of which were fax machines) over six months. The coordination was done via the Internet and was one of the first such projects. Ossifrage ('bone-breaker', from Latin) is an older name for the bearded vulture, a scavenger famous for dropping animal bones and live tortoises on top of rocks to crack them open. The 1993‚Äì94 effort began the tradition of using the words \\"squeamish ossifrage\\" in cryptanalytic challenges. The difficulty of breaking the RSA cipher ‚Äî recovering a plaintext message given a ciphertext and the public key ‚Äî is connected to the difficulty of factoring large numbers. While it is not known whether the two problems are mathematically equivalent, factoring is currently the only publicly known method of directly breaking RSA. The decryption of the 1977 ciphertext involved the factoring of a 129-digit (426 bit) number, RSA-129, in order to recover the plaintext. Ron Rivest estimated in 1977 that factoring a 125-digit semiprime would require 40 quadrillion years, using the best algorithm known and the fastest computers of the day. In their original paper they recommended using 200-digit (663 bit) primes to provide a margin of safety against future developments, though it may have only delayed the solution as a 200-digit semiprime was factored in 2005.Thorsten Kleinjung (2005-05-09), We have factored RSA200 by GNFS . Retrieved on 2008-03-10.RSA Laboratories, RSA-200 is factored!. Retrieved on 2008-03-10. But efficient factoring algorithms had not been studied much at the time, and a lot of progress was made in the following decades. Atkins et al. used the quadratic sieve algorithm invented by Carl Pomerance in 1981. While the asymptotically faster number field sieve had just been invented, it was not clear at the time that it would be better than the quadratic sieve for 129-digit numbers. The memory requirements of the newer algorithm were also a concern., Supplementary Material to the 1995 edition of his Cryptography Theory and Practice, see web page. There was a US$100 prize associated with the challenge, which the winners donated to the Free Software Foundation. In 2015, the same RSA-129 number was factored in about one day, with the CADO-NFS open source implementation of number field sieve, using a commercial cloud computing service for about $30.

It comprised about 600 people. The emergency conference was called in preparation for the Communist Unity Convention scheduled for 1 August 1920 in London. Here binding decisions were to be made by majority vote, and the Left Communists wanted to organise themselves against the right at this conference. The initial call was sent out by the Workers Socialist Federation (WSF) and attracted communist groups from Aberdeen, Croydon and Holt, the Gorton Socialist Society, the Manchester Soviet, the Stepney Communist League and the Labour Abstentionist Party.M.

Shipway, Anti-Parliamentary Communism in Britain 1917-1945, vol.1, pp.45-46 and T. J. Watkins was elected as treasurer. Workers' Dreadnought, the WSF newspaper edited by Sylvia Pankhurst, was adopted as the official weekly organ of the party, and a provisional Organising Council of 25 members was elected to manage the affairs of the organisation pending a National Conference scheduled for September 1920.'Communist Party (British Section of the Third International)', Workers' Dreadnought, Vol VII No.14 26 June 1919 p Soon there was a dispute with Guy Aldred and the Glasgow Communist Group, who had suspended their support for the Third International on account of their avowed revolutionary parliamentarianism. In the end the CP (BSTI) withdrew from the Communist Unity Convention, just as Lenin's pamphlet Left- Wing Communism: An Infantile Disorder came out with extracts being quickly translated. Lenin also wrote to the convention urging participation in parliament, something which was agreed by 189 votes to 19. Meanwhile, the CP (BSTI) sent delegates to the Second Congress of the Third International, at which they were instructed to unite with the Communist Party of Great Britain as founded at that convention. Upon their return a further conference was held in Manchester 18‚Äì19 September. Here they voted to accept the conditions of the Second Congress with reservations about taking parliamentary action. Pankhurst argued that the tactic of revolutionary parliamentarianism would be dropped at the next congress. She had been impressed by the size of the abstentionist faction at the congress, and reported that Lenin has said the issue was not important during an informal discussion. At the third conference of CP (BSTI), Cardiff, 4 December, the Statutes and Theses of the Third International were accepted, although there was a consensus that they were not bound to parliamentary action. The four Manchester branches saw this as a sell out, and resigned, taking 200 members with them. Whitehead and Pankhurst maintained they still had the freedom to fight for abstentionism within the CPGB, and they formally fused with them at the second Communist Unity Conference in Leeds, January 1921. In response to this, the Manchester sections of the CP (BSTI) resigned, refusing to join the CPGB.M. A. S.

Having died at the age of only 16, he was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross, the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces. Cornwell is the third-youngest recipient of the VC after Andrew Fitzgibbon and Thomas Flinn. Early life John \\"Jack\\" Travers Cornwell was born as the third child of a working-class family at Clyde Place, Leyton, Essex (now in Greater London). His parents were Eli and Alice Cornwell. The family later moved to Alverstone Road, East Ham. He left Walton Road School at the standard age of 14, but was in the Boy Scouts. At the outbreak of the First World War, ex-soldier Eli Cornwell volunteered for service and was fighting in France under Lord Kitchener. His older brother Arthur also served in an infantry regiment on the Western Front. In October 1915, Jack Cornwell gave up his job as a delivery boy and enlisted in the Royal Navy, without his father's permission. He had references from his headmaster and employer. He carried out his basic training at HMS Vivid Keyham Naval Barracks in Plymouth, and received further training as a Sight Setter or Gun Layer and became Boy Seaman First Class. On Easter Monday 1916, Cornwell left for Rosyth, Scotland, to join his assignment in the navy. He was assigned to HMS Chester. Battle of Jutland Jack Cornwell's gun, HMS Chester On 31 May 1916, Chester was scouting ahead of the 3rd Battlecruiser Squadron at the Battle of Jutland when the ship turned to investigate gunfire in the distance. At 17:30 hours, Chester soon came under intense fire from four Kaiserliche Marine cruisers each her own size which had suddenly emerged from the haze and increasing funnel smoke of the battlefield. The shielded 5.5-inch gun mounting where Cornwell was serving as a sight-setter was affected by at least four nearby hits. Chesters gun mountings were open-backed shields and did not reach down to the deck. Splinters were thus able to pass under them or enter the open back when shells exploded nearby or behind. All the gun's crew were killed or mortally injured except Cornwell, who, although severely wounded, managed to stand up again and remain at his post for more than 15 minutes, until Chester retired from the action with only one main gun still working. Chester had received a total of 18 hits, but partial hull armour meant that the interior of the ship suffered little serious damage and the ship itself was never in peril. Nevertheless, the situation on deck was dire. Many of the gun crews had lost lower limbs due to splinters passing under the gun shields. British ships reported passing the Chester to cheers from limbless wounded gun crew laid out on her deck and smoking cigarettes, only to hear that the same crewmen had died a few hours later from blood-loss and shock. After the action, ship medics arrived on deck to find Cornwell the sole survivor at his gun, shards of steel penetrating his chest, looking at the gun sights and still waiting for orders. Being incapable of further action, Chester was ordered to the port of Immingham. There Cornwell was transferred to Grimsby General Hospital, although he was clearly dying. He died on the morning of 2 June 1916, before his mother could arrive at the hospital. Victoria Cross Three months later, Captain Robert Lawson of Chester described the events to the British Admiralty. Though at first reluctant, the Admiralty eventually decided to recommend Cornwell for a posthumous Victoria Cross and King George V endorsed it. The recommendation for citation, from Admiral David Beatty, reads: > The instance of devotion to duty by Boy (1st Class) John Travers Cornwell > who was mortally wounded early in the action, but nevertheless remained > standing alone at a most exposed post, quietly awaiting orders till the end > of the action, with the gun's crew dead and wounded around him. He was under > 16¬Ω years old. I regret that he has since died, but I recommend his case for > special recognition in justice to his memory and as an acknowledgement of > the high example set by him. The funeral procession of John Travers Cornwell VC at Manor Park on 29 July 1916 Jack Cornwell was initially buried in a common grave (Square 126 Grave 323) in Manor Park Cemetery, London, but his body was exhumed on 29 July 1916 and he was reburied with full military honours in the same cemetery (square 55 grave 13).cwgc.org CWGC Debt of Honour Register Cornwell's father Eli, who died on 25 October 1916 from bronchitis during home service with the Royal Defence Corps, was buried in the same grave on 31 October 1916.cwgc.org CWGC Debt of Honour Register. The epitaph to Jack Cornwell on his grave monument reads, \\"It is not wealth or ancestry but honourable conduct and a noble disposition that maketh men great.\\" In May 2016, the family grave and war memorial, erected in 1920, was given Grade II listed status, legally protecting it from unauthorised modification or removal. The award of the Victoria Cross appeared in The London Gazette on Friday 15 September 1916. The citation read: > The KING has been graciously pleased to approve the grant of the Victoria > Cross to Boy, First Class, John Travers Cornwell, O.N.J.42563 (died 2 June > 1916), for the conspicuous act of bravery specified below. Mortally wounded > early in the action, Boy, First Class, Jack Travers Cornwell remained > standing alone at a most exposed post, quietly awaiting orders, until the > end of the action, with the gun's crew dead and wounded all round him. His > age was under sixteen and a half years. On 16 November 1916, Cornwell's mother received the Victoria Cross from King George V at Buckingham Palace. Court painter Frank O. Salisbury made a portrait of Cornwell, using his brother Ernest as a model, depicting him standing in his post. Boy Cornwell Memorial Fund was also established. After that, the rest of the family was effectively forgotten. After Eli Cornwell's death on 25 October 1916, his half-brother Arthur Frederick Cornwell was killed in action in France on 29 August 1918. The impoverished Alice Cornwell died at the age of 48 on 31 October 1919, at 745 Commercial Road in Stepney, in rooms she was forced to take when her son's memorial fund refused financial aid. The two of her children remaining at home were granted ¬£60 a year in a pension from the fund after Alice's death, but this proved insufficient and they both emigrated to Canada in the early 1920s. Jack Cornwell's elder half- sister, also named Alice, loaned Jack's Victoria Cross to the Imperial War Museum on 27 November 1968. Salisbury's portrait of Cornwell hangs in the Anglican church within the Royal Navy's Initial Training Establishment HMS Raleigh, perhaps selected as an appropriate place also because the ship's chaplain, The Rev. Cyril Ambrose Walton, was also killed during the action. Remembrance The John Cornwell Victoria Cross National Memorial cottages in Hornchurch, for needy former sailors and marines The original furore caused by his very public re-burial led to over seven million of the Empire's children donating to his fund. ¬£18,000 was raised in his memory for the Jack Cornwell ward of the Royal Star and Garter Home, Richmond. The John Cornwell Victoria Cross National Memorial (JCVCNM) was established in 1928, when a plot of land was purchased at Hornchurch, then in Essex, with money raised by the Mayor of East Ham. There, a community of cottage homes was built for needy, disabled or infirm former sailors and Royal Marines, up to and including the rank of Warrant Officer and their families. The six semi-detached houses and pathways are laid out in the form of a Victoria Cross. Since 2008, the community has been under the trusteeship of The Royal Naval Benevolent Trust. =Scouting= The Cornwell Scout Badge may be awarded to members of many Commonwealth Scout associations for \\"pre-eminently high character and devotion to duty, together with great courage and endurance\\". Sir Robert Baden-Powell, the founder of the Scout movement, created an award in his honour, The Cornwell Scout Badge, which is still used by Scout associations throughout the Commonwealth. It is awarded to youth members in respect of pre-eminently high character and devotion to duty, together with great courage and endurance. Camp Cornwell, established in 1925 as the headquarters for Western Australian Sea Scouts is situated at Pelican Point on the Swan River near Perth. =Cadets= Jack Cornwell is also remembered by the Sea Cadet Corps, Army Cadet Force and Air Training Corps, who each have a unit based in the UK's first and only Tri- Service Cadet building, named The Cornwell VC Cadet Centre, on Vicarage Lane in East Ham. Newham (Cornwell VC) Sea Cadets have been honoured with 'J T Cornwell VC' on their cap ribbon (Cap Tally) instead of the customary TS (training ship). They are the only Sea Cadet Unit in the UK to have this honour. In 2003, the Cadets suggested commemorating him by renaming a school in Leyton after him; when Cornwell attended the school it was known as Farmer Road School, and it is now named George Mitchell School, after another former pupil, George Allan Mitchell, who won a VC in Italy during the Second World War. Jack Cornwell is also remembered by Royal Navy Combined Cadet Force divisions, such as the RN CCF section at Whitgift School, Croydon, which is named the \\"Cornwell\\" division in his honour. Cornwell's gun on display at the Imperial War Museum. In Canada, Royal Canadian Sea Cadet Corps John Travers Cornwell, VC, based on HMCS Chippawa in Winnipeg, MB is named after him. =Other memorials= In Little Ilford, Jack Cornwell Street and a nearby block of council flats called John Cornwell VC House are named in his memory. In Jack Cornwell Street there is a public house named The Victoria Cross to commemorate his medal. A blue plaque has been erected by the London Borough of Waltham Forest on the flats that now occupy the site of his birthplace in Clyde Place, Leyton. The 5.5-inch gun on which he served is still displayed in the Imperial War Museum, London. In September 2006, Jack Cornwell VC featured on one of a series of Royal Mail postage stamps marking the 150th anniversary of the Victoria Cross. In 2016, Jack Cornwell was featured on a ¬£5 coin (issued in silver and gold) in a six-coin set commemorating the Centenary of the First World War produced by the Royal Mint. Cornwell Close, on Grimsby's Nunsthorpe Estate and Cornwell Court in Haslemere Road, Portsmouth are named after him. Citadel High School of Halifax, Nova Scotia gives out the Jack Cornwell Award to a student in each graduating class to the student who most exemplifies the qualities of honour, loyalty and bravery. Mount Cornwell (2,972 metres) is a peak in the High Rock Range in British Columbia, part of the Canadian Rockies, which was named in his honour in 1918. There is also a Mount Chester (3,054 metres) in Alberta, named after HMS Chester in 1917.Birrell, Dave (2000), 50 Roadside Panoramas in the Canadian Rockies, Rocky Mountain Books, (pp. 135‚Äì6) References External links * Boy (1st Class) John ‚ÄòJack‚Äô Travers Cornwell VC - illustrated article from the Imperial War Museum * John Travers Cornwell (biography) * Location of grave and VC medal (E.

Biosemiotics attempts to integrate the findings of biology and semiotics and proposes a paradigmatic shift in the scientific view of life, in which semiosis (sign process, including meaning and interpretation) is one of its immanent and intrinsic features. The term biosemiotic was first used by Friedrich S. Rothschild in 1962, but Thomas Sebeok and Thure von Uexk√ºll have implemented the term and field.Kull, Kalevi 1999.

History Apart from Charles Sanders Peirce (1839‚Äì1914) and Charles W. Morris (1903‚Äì1979), early pioneers of biosemiotics were Jakob von Uexk√ºll (1864‚Äì1944), Heini Hediger (1908‚Äì1992), Giorgio Prodi (1928‚Äì1987), Marcel Florkin (1900‚Äì1979) and Friedrich S. Rothschild (1899‚Äì1995); the founding fathers of the contemporary interdiscipline were Thomas Sebeok (1920‚Äì2001) and Thure von Uexk√ºll (1908‚Äì2004).Favareau, D. (ed.) (2010).

Johnson has directly addressed the issues of black life in America in novels such as Dreamer and Middle Passage. Johnson was born in 1948 in Evanston, Illinois, and spent most of his career at the University of Washington in Seattle. The Cambridge Guide to Literature in English says that Johnson's works \\"combine historical accuracy, parable, and elements of the fantastic in rendering the experience of African Americans.\\" Career = Political Cartooning = He first came to prominence in the 1960s as a political cartoonist and illustrator. At the age of 15 he was a student of cartoonist/mystery writer Lawrence Lariar. After a two-year correspondence course with Lariar, Johnson began publishing his artwork professionally in 1965, drawing illustrations for the catalog of a magic company in Chicago, and publishing three stories in his high school's newspaper as well as panel cartoons and a comic strip that in 1966 took two second place awards in the sports and humor divisions of the Columbia Scholastic Press Association's cartoon contest. He continued drawing and publishing prolifically during his years as an undergraduate journalism major at Southern Illinois University, which in 1977 awarded him the Delta Award \\"for significant contribution to intellectual commerce of our time\\" (sponsored by Friends of Morris Library) and an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters in 1995. In his first career as a cartoonist (1965‚Äì72), Johnson churned out hundreds of drawings, comic strips, panel cartoons and illustrations for the student paper The Daily Egyptian, regular editorial cartoons for The Southern Illinoisan, illustrations for The Chicago Tribune, national African-American publications including Black World (formerly Negro Digest), Ebony, and Players, one-page comic book scripts for the now defunct Charlton Comics, and taught cartooning in SIU's \\"Free School.\\" One of his earliest published articles is \\"Creating the Political Cartoon,\\" published in Scholastic/Editor/Communications and Graphics (March 1973). Inspired by a lecture he heard in 1969 by Amiri Baraka (n√© Leroi Jones), Johnson drew the collection of racial satire titled Black Humor (Chicago: Johnson Publishing Company, 1970). A second collection of political satire appeared in 1972, Half-Past Nation-Time (Aware Press, California). In 1970, he created, hosted, and co-produced at WSIU-TV Charlie's Pad, an early PBS how-to-draw series broadcast nationally. It consisted of 52, 15-minute lessons in cartooning based on his earlier two years of lessons with Lawrence Lariar. Today only three episodes of this series have survived. = Higher education and early novels = Johnson received his B.S. in journalism and M.A. in philosophy from Southern Illinois University in 1971 and 1973 and his Ph.D. in philosophy from Stony Brook University in 1988. In 2013, Johnson was awarded by his old philosophy department the first \\"Don Ihde Distinguished Alumni Award\\", 78-year-old Ihde being one of America's preeminent phenomenologists, and the director for Johnson's dissertation, Being and Race: Black Writing Since 1970 (1988), a literary manifesto published by Indiana University Press that used the methods of Continental philosophy to examine African-American literature and create an aesthetic position. After writing six of what he calls \\"apprentice novels\\" between 1970 and 1972 (one of these was an early draft of Middle Passage), which were not published, Johnson wrote his seventh and first philosophical novel, Faith and the Good Thing, in nine months with his mentor, the late John Gardner, providing him with feedback. This novel was published in 1974 by Viking Press, and Johnson stated then, as he would over the years, that his goal was to contribute to and enrich the tradition of \\"African- American philosophical fiction\\". He identified early practitioners of this genre as being Jean Toomer, Richard Wright, and Ralph Ellison. Early in his writing career, Johnson's mentor was the novelist John Gardner. = University of Washington = In 1976, he was hired to teach at the University of Washington, Seattle (UW). He received early tenure in three years at UW, then early full professorship after another three years, following the publication of his second novel, Oxherding Tale (1982), a slave narrative steeped in Eastern thought, and referring to the classic 10 Oxherding Pictures of 16th- century artist Kakuan Shien. A student of Buddhism and Eastern thought all his life, as well as a student of Sanskrit since 1998, Johnson took formal vows on November 14, 2007, in the Soto Zen tradition (the 10 Precepts) with mendicant monk Claude AnShin Thomas, author of At Hell's Gate: A Soldier's Journey From War to Peace (2004). Johnson is a contributing writer for Tricycle: The Buddhist Review, and publishes regularly in Shambhala Sun, Buddhadharma: The Practitioner's Quarterly, and has contributed to Turning Wheel: The Journal of Socially Engaged Buddhism. A collection of these writings appeared in Turning the Wheel: Essays on Buddhism and Writing (Scribner, 2003), and was followed in 2014 by a sequel from Shambhala Publications, Taming the Ox: Buddhist Stories, and Reflections on Politics, Race, Culture, and Spiritual Practice. In 1986, Johnson's first story collection, The Sorcerer's Apprentice was short-listed for the PEN/Faulkner, and he was identified in a survey conducted at UCLA as one of the ten best short story writers in America. His other story collections include Soulcatcher and Other Stories (2001), which were 12 fictions written to dramatize the historical record in the companion book to the PBS series Africans in America, broadcast in 1998 (these are the only stories a writer has been commissioned to do for a history book). His second collection is Dr. King's Refrigerator and Other Bedtime Stories (half of the stories in this collection were written for Humanities Washington's yearly \\"Bedtime Stories\\" literary gala). His short stories have appeared in Best American Short Stories (1982, 1995), O. Henry Prize Stories (1993), Playboy Stories: The Best of Forty Years of Short Fiction (1994), Best Buddhist Writing (2006, 2007, 2008), Best Spiritual Writing (2010), and, like his novels, have been translated into several languages like Russian, Italian, Spanish, South Korean, and Chinese. Two of his stories, \\"Menagerie: A Child's Fable\\" and \\"A Soldier for the Crown\\" were dramatized by actors for National Public Radio's Symphony Space \\"Selected Shorts.\\" For the U.S. Information Agency (now the State Department) he has lectured in Germany, Czechoslovakia, Portugal, France, Indonesia, Japan, and Spain. For 20 years, and after his series Charlie's Pad, Johnson wrote approximately 20 screen and teleplays. The first was Charlie Smith and the Fritter Tree (1978), which was about the at the time the oldest living American, 136-year-old Charlie Smith. With John Allman he shares credit for Booker (1985), a story about the childhood of Booker T. Washington that received a Writers Guild Award for being the \\"outstanding script in 1985 in the category of Television Children's Shows, and many other awards. In 1981, he served as one of two writer-producers for the second season of the PBS series Up and Coming. As a book reviewer, he published over 50 book reviews in numerous publications, including The New York Times Book Review, The Wall Street Journal, Washington Post Book World, the Los Angeles Times, The Seattle Times, The Times (London), Tricycle: The Buddhist Review, and Shambhala Sun. For 20 years, between 1978 and 1998, he was fiction editor of the Seattle Review. He has served as a judge for many literary prizes, among them the Pulitzer Prize in fiction (1992, 1995, 2010) and National Book Award in fiction (1988, 1999, and 2009), twice chairing the fiction panel for the latter. He sponsors the for a writing student at Evanston Township High School, and the Charles Johnson Fiction Award at Southern Illinois University, a national competition open to all college students. Johnson has been a practicing martial artist since 1967 when he trained at Chi Tao Chuan of the Monastery in Chicago. Since 1981, he has been a practitioner and sometimes teacher in the Choy Li Fut kung-fu lineage of grandmaster Doc-Fai Wong in San Francisco. Until his retirement in 2009, Johnson was the S. Wilson and Grace M. Pollock Endowed Professor of English at the University of Washington.

(With essay by Sherrie Young from the Awards 60-year anniversary blog.) making him the second African-American man to receive this prize after Ralph Ellison in 1953. Johnson's acceptance speech was a tribute to Ellison. Johnson received a MacArthur Fellowship or \\"Genius Grant\\" in 1998. He is also the recipient of National Endowment For The Arts and Guggenheim Fellowships, and many other prizes such as a 2002 Academy Award in Literature from the American Academy of Arts and Letters. He was inducted into the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and his most recent award is The Humanities Washington Award 2013 for creating and contributing for 15 years a new, original short story to a literary event called \\"Bedtime Stories,\\" which since 1998 has raised a million dollars for the literacy programs of the non-profit organization Humanities Washington. In 2003, the Charles Johnson Society was inaugurated at the American Literature Association. This is a literary society devoted to scholarly papers and articles on Johnson's work and the genre of philosophical fiction in general. Several literary studies of his work have been published, among these are Charles Johnson's Spiritual Imagination by Jonathan Little (University of Missouri Press, 1997); Charles Johnson's Novels: Writing the American Palimpsest by the late Rudolph P. Byrd (Indiana University Press, 2005); Charles Johnson's Fiction by William R. Nash (University of Illinois Press, 2003); Understanding Charles Johnson, by the late Gary Storhoff (University of South Carolina Press, 2004); Charles Johnson: The Novelist as Philosopher, edited by Marc C. Conner and William R. Nash (University Press of Mississippi, 2007); and Charles Johnson in Context by Linda Furgerson Selzer (University of Massachusetts Press, 2009). After Johnson's retirement from teaching, a festschrift book celebrating the author's work was published in India, Charles Johnson: Embracing the World, edited by Nibir K. Ghosh and American poet E. Ethelbert Miller (Authorspress, 2011).

The broad meaning of the term, such as in the history of technology, economic history, and economic development, usually applies to a region or national economy. Broadly speaking, electrification was the build- out of the electricity generation and electric power distribution systems that occurred in Britain, the United States, and other now-developed countries from the mid-1880s until around 1950 and is still in progress in rural areas in some developing countries. This included the transition in manufacturing from line shaft and belt drive using steam engines and water power to electric motors.* The electrification of particular sectors of the economy is called by terms such as factory electrification, household electrification, rural electrification or railway electrification. It may also apply to changing industrial processes such as smelting, melting, separating or refining from coal or coke heating, or chemical processes to some type of electric process such as electric arc furnace, electric induction or resistance heating, or electrolysis or electrolytic separating. Electrification was called \\"the greatest engineering achievement of the 20th Century\\" by the National Academy of Engineering.  History of electrification  The earliest commercial uses of electricity were electroplating and the telegraph. =Development of magnetos, dynamos and generators= Faraday disk, the first electric generator. The horseshoe-shaped magnet (A) created a magnetic field through the disk (D). When the disk was turned, this induced an electric current radially outward from the center toward the rim. The current flowed out through the sliding spring contact m, through the external circuit, and back into the center of the disk through the axle. In the years 1831‚Äì1832, Michael Faraday discovered the operating principle of electromagnetic generators. The principle, later called Faraday's law, is that an electromotive force is generated in an electrical conductor that is subjected to a varying magnetic flux, as for example, a wire moving through a magnetic field. He also built the first electromagnetic generator, called the Faraday disk, a type of homopolar generator, using a copper disc rotating between the poles of a horseshoe magnet. It produced a small DC voltage. Around 1832, Hippolyte Pixii improved the magneto by using a wire wound horseshoe, with the extra coils of conductor generating more current, but it was AC. Andr√©-Marie Amp√®re suggested a means of converting current from Pixii's magneto to DC using a rocking switch. Later segmented commutators were used to produce direct current. William Fothergill Cooke and Charles Wheatstone developed a telegraph around 1838-40. In 1840 Wheatstone was using a magneto that he developed to power the telegraph. Wheatstone and Cooke made an important improvement in electrical generation by using a battery-powered electromagnet in place of a permanent magnet, which they patented in 1845. The self-excited magnetic field dynamo did away with the battery to power electromagnets. This type of dynamo was made by several people in 1866. The first practical generator, the Gramme machine, was made by Z. T. Gramme, who sold many of these machines in the 1870s. British engineer R. E. B. Crompton improved the generator to allow better air cooling and made other mechanical improvements. Compound winding, which gave more stable voltage with load, improved the operating characteristics of generators. The improvements in electrical generation technology in the 19th century increased its efficiency and reliability greatly. The first magnetos only converted a few percent of mechanical energy to electricity. By the end of the 19th century the highest efficiencies were over 90%. =Electric lighting= Arc lighting Yablochkov's demonstration of his brilliant arc lights at the 1878 Paris Exposition along the Avenue de l'Op√©ra triggered a steep sell off of gas utility stocks. Sir Humphry Davy invented the carbon arc lamp in 1802 upon discovering that electricity could produce a light arc with carbon electrodes. However, it was not used to any great extent until a practical means of generating electricity was developed. Carbon arc lamps were started by making contact between two carbon electrodes, which were then separated to within a narrow gap. Because the carbon burned away, the gap had to be constantly readjusted. Several mechanisms were developed to regulate the arc. A common approach was to feed a carbon electrode by gravity and maintain the gap with a pair of electromagnets, one of which retracted the upper carbon after the arc was started and the second controlled a brake on the gravity feed. Arc lamps of the time had very intense light output ‚Äì in the range of 4000 candlepower (candelas) ‚Äì and released a lot of heat, and they were a fire hazard, all of which made them inappropriate for lighting homes. In the 1850s, many of these problems were solved by the arc lamp invented by William Petrie and William Staite. The lamp used a magneto-electric generator and had a self-regulating mechanism to control the gap between the two carbon rods. Their light was used to light up the National Gallery in London and was a great novelty at the time. These arc lamps and designs similar to it, powered by large magnetos, were first installed on English lighthouses in the mid 1850s, but the power limitations prevented these models from being a proper success. The first successful arc lamp was developed by Russian engineer Pavel Yablochkov, and used the Gramme generator. Its advantage lay in the fact that it didn't require the use of a mechanical regulator like its predecessors. It was first exhibited at the Paris Exposition of 1878 and was heavily promoted by Gramme. The arc light was installed along the half mile length of Avenue de l'Op√©ra, Place du Theatre Francais and around the Place de l'Op√©ra in 1878. British engineer R. E. B. Crompton developed a more sophisticated design in 1878 which gave a much brighter and steadier light than the Yablochkov candle. In 1878, he formed Crompton & Co. and began to manufacture, sell and install the Crompton lamp. His concern was one of the first electrical engineering firms in the world. Incandescent light bulbs Various forms of incandescent light bulbs had numerous inventors; however, the most successful early bulbs were those that used a carbon filament sealed in a high vacuum. These were invented by Joseph Swan in 1878 in Britain and by Thomas Edison in 1879 in the US. Edison‚Äôs lamp was more successful than Swan‚Äôs because Edison used a thinner filament, giving it higher resistance and thus conducting much less current. Edison began commercial production of carbon filament bulbs in 1880. Swan's light began commercial production in 1881. Swan's house, in Low Fell, Gateshead, was the world's first to have working light bulbs installed. The Lit & Phil Library in Newcastle, was the first public room lit by electric light,History in pictures - The Lit & Phil BBC. Retrieved 8 August 2011 and the Savoy Theatre was the first public building in the world lit entirely by electricity.Burgess, Michael. \\"Richard D'Oyly Carte\\", The Savoyard, January 1975, pp. 7‚Äì11 =Central power stations and isolated systems= Electricity grid simple- North America The first central station providing public power is believed to be one at Godalming, Surrey, U.K. autumn 1881. The system was proposed after the town failed to reach an agreement on the rate charged by the gas company, so the town council decided to use electricity. The system lit up arc lamps on the main streets and incandescent lamps on a few side streets with hydroelectric power. By 1882 between 8 and 10 households were connected, with a total of 57 lights. The system was not a commercial success and the town reverted to gas. The first large scale central distribution supply plant was opened at Holborn Viaduct in London in 1882. Equipped with 1000 incandescent lightbulbs that replaced the older gas lighting, the station lit up Holborn Circus including the offices of the General Post Office and the famous City Temple church. The supply was a direct current at 110 V; due to power loss in the copper wires, this amounted to 100 V for the customer. Within weeks, a parliamentary committee recommended passage of the landmark 1882 Electric Lighting Act, which allowed the licensing of persons, companies or local authorities to supply electricity for any public or private purposes. The first large scale central power station in America was Edison's Pearl Street Station in New York, which began operating in September 1882. The station had six 200 horsepower Edison dynamos, each powered by a separate steam engine. It was located in a business and commercial district and supplied 110 volt direct current to 85 customers with 400 lamps. By 1884 Pearl Street was supplying 508 customers with 10,164 lamps. By the mid-1880s, other electric companies were establishing central power stations and distributing electricity, including Crompton & Co. and the Swan Electric Light Company in the UK, Thomson-Houston Electric Company and Westinghouse in the US and Siemens in Germany. By 1890 there were 1000 central stations in operation. The 1902 census listed 3,620 central stations. By 1925 half of power was provided by central stations. Load factor & isolated systems Electricity Grid Schematic English One of the biggest problems facing the early power companies was the hourly variable demand. When lighting was practically the only use of electricity, demand was high during the first hours before the workday and the evening hours when demand peaked. As a consequence, most early electric companies did not provide daytime service, with two-thirds providing no daytime service in 1897. The ratio of the average load to the peak load of a central station is called the load factor. For electric companies to increase profitability and lower rates, it was necessary to increase the load factor. The way this was eventually accomplished was through motor load. Motors are used more during daytime and many run continuously. (See: Continuous production.) Electric street railways were ideal for load balancing. Many electric railways generated their own power and also sold power and operated distribution systems. The load factor adjusted upward by the turn of the 20th century‚Äîat Pearl Street the load factor increased from 19.3% in 1884 to 29.4% in 1908. By 1929, the load factor around the world was greater than 50%, mainly due to motor load. Before widespread power distribution from central stations, many factories, large hotels, apartment and office buildings had their own power generation. Often this was economically attractive because the exhaust steam could be used for building and industrial process heat, which today is known as cogeneration or combined heat and power (CHP). Most self- generated power became uneconomical as power prices fell. As late as the early 20th century, isolated power systems greatly outnumbered central stations. Cogeneration is still commonly practiced in many industries that use large amounts of both steam and power, such as pulp and paper, chemicals and refining. The continued use of private electric generators is called microgeneration. =Direct current electric motors= The first commutator DC electric motor capable of turning machinery was invented by the British scientist William Sturgeon in 1832. The crucial advance that this represented over the motor demonstrated by Michael Faraday was the incorporation of a commutator. This allowed Sturgeon's motor to be the first capable of providing continuous rotary motion. Frank J. Sprague improved on the DC motor in 1884 by solving the problem of maintaining a constant speed with varying load and reducing sparking from the brushes. Sprague sold his motor through Edison Co. It is easy to vary speed with DC motors, which made them suited for a number of applications such as electric street railways, machine tools and certain other industrial applications where speed control was desirable. =Alternating current= Although the first power stations supplied direct current, the distribution of alternating current soon became the most favored option. The main advantages of AC were that it could be transformed to high voltage to reduce transmission losses and that AC motors could easily run at constant speeds. Alternating current technology was rooted in Michael Faraday's 1830‚Äì31 discovery that a changing magnetic field can induce an electric current in a circuit. The first person to conceive of a rotating magnetic field was Walter Baily who gave a workable demonstration of his battery-operated polyphase motor aided by a commutator on June 28, 1879 to the Physical Society of London. Nearly identical to Baily‚Äôs apparatus, French electrical engineer Marcel Deprez in 1880 published a paper that identified the rotating magnetic field principle and that of a two-phase AC system of currents to produce it. In 1886, English engineer Elihu Thomson built an AC motor by expanding upon the induction-repulsion principle and his wattmeter. It was in the 1880s that the technology was commercially developed for large scale electricity generation and transmission. In 1882 the British inventor and electrical engineer Sebastian de Ferranti, working for the company Siemens collaborated with the distinguished physicist Lord Kelvin to pioneer AC power technology including an early transformer. A power transformer developed by Lucien Gaulard and John Dixon Gibbs was demonstrated in London in 1881, and attracted the interest of Westinghouse. They also exhibited the invention in Turin in 1884, where it was adopted for an electric lighting system. Many of their designs were adapted to the particular laws governing electrical distribution in the UK. Sebastian Ziani de Ferranti went into this business in 1882 when he set up a shop in London designing various electrical devices. Ferranti believed in the success of alternating current power distribution early on, and was one of the few experts in this system in the UK. With the help of Lord Kelvin, Ferranti pioneered the first AC power generator and transformer in 1882. John Hopkinson, a British physicist, invented the three- wire (three-phase) system for the distribution of electrical power, for which he was granted a patent in 1882.Oxford Dictionary of National Biography: Hopkinson, John by T. H. Beare The Italian inventor Galileo Ferraris invented a polyphase AC induction motor in 1885. The idea was that two out-of-phase, but synchronized, currents might be used to produce two magnetic fields that could be combined to produce a rotating field without any need for switching or for moving parts. Other inventors were the American engineers Charles S. Bradley and Nikola Tesla, and the German technician Friedrich August Haselwander. They were able to overcome the problem of starting up the AC motor by using a rotating magnetic field produced by a poly-phase current. Mikhail Dolivo-Dobrovolsky introduced the first three-phase induction motor in 1890, a much more capable design that became the prototype used in Europe and the U.S.Arnold Heertje, Mark Perlman Evolving Technology and Market Structure: Studies in Schumpeterian Economics, page 138 By 1895 GE and Westinghouse both had AC motors on the market. With single phase current either a capacitor or coil (creating inductance) can be used on part of the circuit inside the motor to create a rotating magnetic field. Multi-speed AC motors that have separately wired poles have long been available, the most common being two speed. Speed of these motors is changed by switching sets of poles on or off, which was done with a special motor starter for larger motors, or a simple multiple speed switch for fractional horsepower motors. AC power stations The first AC power station was built by the English electrical engineer Sebastian de Ferranti. In 1887 the London Electric Supply Corporation hired Ferranti for the design of their power station at Deptford. He designed the building, the generating plant and the distribution system. It was built at the Stowage, a site to the west of the mouth of Deptford Creek once used by the East India Company. Built on an unprecedented scale and pioneering the use of high voltage (10,000 V) AC current, it generated 800 kilowatts and supplied central London. On its completion in 1891 it was the first truly modern power station, supplying high-voltage AC power that was then \\"stepped down\\" with transformers for consumer use on each street. This basic system remains in use today around the world. In America, George Westinghouse who had become interested in the power transformer developed by Gaulard and Gibbs, began to develop his AC lighting system, using a transmission system with a 20:1 step up voltage with step-down. In 1890 Westinghouse and Stanley built a system to transmit power several miles to a mine in Colorado. A decision was taken to use AC for power transmission from the Niagara Power Project to Buffalo, New York. Proposals submitted by vendors in 1890 included DC and compressed air systems. A combination DC and compressed air system remained under consideration until late in the schedule. Despite the protestations of the Niagara commissioner William Thomson (Lord Kelvin) the decision was taken to build an AC system, which had been proposed by both Westinghouse and General Electric. In October 1893 Westinghouse was awarded the contract to provide the first three 5,000 hp, 250 rpm, 25 Hz, two phase generators. The hydro power plant went online in 1895, and it was the largest one until that date. By the 1890s, single and poly-phase AC was undergoing rapid introduction. In the U.S. by 1902, 61% of generating capacity was AC, increasing to 95% in 1917. Despite the superiority of alternating current for most applications, a few existing DC systems continued to operate for several decades after AC became the standard for new systems.

Arrows show the resulting magnetic force vectors. Three phase current is used in commerce and industry. =Steam turbines= The efficiency of steam prime movers in converting the heat energy of fuel into mechanical work was a critical factor in the economic operation of steam central generating stations. Early projects used reciprocating steam engines, operating at relatively low speeds. The introduction of the steam turbine fundamentally changed the economics of central station operations. Steam turbines could be made in larger ratings than reciprocating engines, and generally had higher efficiency. The speed of steam turbines did not fluctuate cyclically during each revolution; making parallel operation of AC generators feasible, and improved the stability of rotary converters for production of direct current for traction and industrial uses. Steam turbines ran at higher speed than reciprocating engines, not being limited by the allowable speed of a piston in a cylinder. This made them more compatible with AC generators with only two or four poles; no gearbox or belted speed increaser was needed between the engine and the generator. It was costly and ultimately impossible to provide a belt-drive between a low-speed engine and a high-speed generator in the very large ratings required for central station service. The modern steam turbine was invented in 1884 by the British Sir Charles Parsons, whose first model was connected to a dynamo that generated 7.5 kW (10 hp) of electricity. The invention of Parson's steam turbine made cheap and plentiful electricity possible. Parsons turbines were widely introduced in English central stations by 1894; the first electric supply company in the world to generate electricity using turbo generators was Parsons' own electricity supply company Newcastle and District Electric Lighting Company, set up in 1894. Within Parson's lifetime, the generating capacity of a unit was scaled up by about 10,000 times. Parsons steam turbine linked directly to a dynamo The first U.S. turbines were two De Leval units at Edison Co. in New York in 1895. The first U.S. Parsons turbine was at Westinghouse Air Brake Co. near Pittsburgh. Steam turbines also had capital cost and operating advantages over reciprocating engines. The condensate from steam engines was contaminated with oil and could not be reused, while condensate from a turbine is clean and typically reused. Steam turbines were a fraction of the size and weight of comparably rated reciprocating steam engine. Steam turbines can operate for years with almost no wear. Reciprocating steam engines required high maintenance. Steam turbines can be manufactured with capacities far larger than any steam engines ever made, giving important economies of scale. Steam turbines could be built to operate on higher pressure and temperature steam. A fundamental principle of thermodynamics is that the higher the temperature of the steam entering an engine, the higher the efficiency. The introduction of steam turbines motivated a series of improvements in temperatures and pressures. The resulting increased conversion efficiency lowered electricity prices. The power density of boilers was increased by using forced combustion air and by using compressed air to feed pulverized coal. Also, coal handling was mechanized and automated. =Electrical grid= Construction workers raising power lines, 1920 With the realization of long distance power transmission it was possible to interconnect different central stations to balance loads and improve load factors. Interconnection became increasingly desirable as electrification grew rapidly in the early years of the 20th century. Charles Merz, of the Merz & McLellan consulting partnership, built the Neptune Bank Power Station near Newcastle upon Tyne in 1901, and by 1912 had developed into the largest integrated power system in Europe. In 1905 he tried to influence Parliament to unify the variety of voltages and frequencies in the country's electricity supply industry, but it was not until World War I that Parliament began to take this idea seriously, appointing him head of a Parliamentary Committee to address the problem. In 1916 Merz pointed out that the UK could use its small size to its advantage, by creating a dense distribution grid to feed its industries efficiently. His findings led to the Williamson Report of 1918, which in turn created the Electricity Supply Bill of 1919. The bill was the first step towards an integrated electricity system in the UK. The more significant Electricity (Supply) Act of 1926, led to the setting up of the National Grid. The Central Electricity Board standardised the nation's electricity supply and established the first synchronised AC grid, running at 132 kilovolts and 50 Hertz. This started operating as a national system, the National Grid, in 1938. In the United States it became a national objective after the power crisis during the summer of 1918 in the midst of World War I to consolidate supply. In 1934 the Public Utility Holding Company Act recognized electric utilities as public goods of importance along with gas, water, and telephone companies and thereby were given outlined restrictions and regulatory oversight of their operations.Mazer, A. (2007). Electric Power Planning for Regulated and Deregulated Markets. John, Wiley, and Sons, Inc., Hoboken, NJ. 313pgs. = Household electrification = The electrification of households in Europe and North America began in the early 20th century in major cities and in areas served by electric railways and increased rapidly until about 1930 when 70% of households were electrified in the U.S. Rural areas were electrified first in Europe, and in the US the Rural Electric Administration, established in 1935 brought electrification to rural areas.Fig 13. =Historical cost of electricity= Central station electric power generating provided power more efficiently and at lower cost than small generators. The capital and operating cost per unit of power were also cheaper with central stations. The cost of electricity fell dramatically in the first decades of the twentieth century due to the introduction of steam turbines and the improved load factor after the introduction of AC motors. As electricity prices fell, usage increased dramatically and central stations were scaled up to enormous sizes, creating significant economies of scale. For the historical cost see Ayres-Warr (2002) Fig. 7.Two Paradigms of Production and Growth Benefits of electrification =Benefits of electric lighting= Electric lighting was highly desirable. The light was much brighter than oil or gas lamps, and there was no soot. Although early electricity was very expensive compared to today, it was far cheaper and more convenient than oil or gas lighting. Electric lighting was so much safer than oil or gas that some companies were able to pay for the electricity with the insurance savings. =Pre-electric power= > \\"One of the inventions most important to a class of highly skilled workers > (engineers) would be a small motive power - ranging perhaps from the force > of from half a man to that of two horses, which might commence as well as > cease its action at a moment's notice, require no expense of time for its > management and be of modest cost both in original cost and in daily > expense.\\" Charles Babbage, 1851 To be efficient steam engines needed to be several hundred horsepower. Steam engines and boilers also required operators and maintenance. For these reasons the smallest commercial steam engines were about 2 horsepower. This was above the need for many small shops. Also, a small steam engine and boiler cost about $7,000 while an old blind horse that could develop 1/2 horsepower cost $20 or less.Unskilled labor made approximately $1.25 per 10- to 12-hour day. Hunter and Bryant cite a letter from Benjamin Latrobe to John Stevens ca. 1814 giving the cost of two old blind horses used to power a mill at $20 and $14. A good dray horse cost $165. Machinery to use horses for power cost $300 or less. upright=1.15rightthumb Threshing machine in 1881. Many power requirements were less than that of a horse. Shop machines, such as woodworking lathes, were often powered with a one- or two-man crank. Household sewing machines were powered with a foot treadle; however, factory sewing machines were steam-powered from a line shaft. Dogs were sometimes used on machines such as a treadmill, which could be adapted to churn butter. In the late 19th century specially designed power buildings leased space to small shops. These building supplied power to the tenants from a steam engine through line shafts. Electric motors were several times more efficient than small steam engines because central station generation was more efficient than small steam engines and because line shafts and belts had high friction losses. Electric motors were more efficient than human or animal power. The conversion efficiency for animal feed to work is between 4 and 5% compared to over 30% for electricity generated using coal. =Economic impact of electrification= Electrification and economic growth are highly correlated. In economics, the efficiency of electrical generation has been shown to correlate with technological progress. In the U.S. from 1870-80 each man-hour was provided with .55 hp. In 1950 each man-hour was provided with 5 hp, or a 2.8% annual increase, declining to 1.5% from 1930-50. The period of electrification of factories and households from 1900 to 1940, was one of high productivity and economic growth. Most studies of electrification and electric grids focused on industrial core countries in Europe and the United States. Elsewhere, wired electricity was often carried on and through the circuits of colonial rule. Some historians and sociologists considered the interplay of colonial politics and the development of electric grids: in India, Rao Rao, Y. Srinivasa (2010) ‚ÄúElectricity, Politics and Regional Economic Imbalance in Madras Presidency, 1900‚Äì1947.‚Äù Economic and Political Weekly 45(23), 59‚Äì66 showed that linguistics-based regional politics ‚Äî not techno-geographical considerations ‚Äî led to the creation of two separate grids; in colonial Zimbabwe (Rhodesia), Chikowero Chikowero, Moses (2007) ‚ÄúSubalternating Currents: Electrification and Power Politics in Bulawayo, Colonial Zimbabwe, 1894‚Äì1939.‚Äù Journal of Southern African Studies 33(2), 287‚Äì306 showed that electrification was racially based and served the white settler community while excluding Africans; and in Mandate Palestine, Shamir Shamir, Ronen (2013) Current Flow: The Electrification of Palestine. Stanford: Stanford University Press claimed that British electric concessions to a Zionist-owned company deepened the economic disparities between Arabs and Jews. Power sources for generation of electricity Most electricity is generated by thermal power stations or steam plants, the majority of which are fossil fuel power stations that burn coal, natural gas, fuel oil or bio-fuels, such as wood waste and black liquor from chemical pulping. The most efficient thermal system is combined cycle in which a combustion turbine powers a generator using the high temperature combustion gases and then exhausts the cooler combustion gases to generate low pressure steam for conventional steam cycle generation. =Hydroelectricity= 156x156px Hydroelectricity uses a water turbine to generate power. In 1878 the world's first hydroelectric power scheme was developed at Cragside in Northumberland, England by William George Armstrong. It was used to power a single arc lamp in his art gallery. The old Schoelkopf Power Station No. 1 near Niagara Falls in the U.S. side began to produce electricity in 1881. The first Edison hydroelectric power plant, the Vulcan Street Plant, began operating September 30, 1882, in Appleton, Wisconsin, with an output of about 12.5 kilowatts.Energy Timelines - Hydropower =Wind turbines= 146x146px The first electricity-generating wind turbine was a battery charging machine installed in July 1887 by Scottish academic James Blyth to light his holiday home in Marykirk, Scotland. Some months later American inventor Charles F Brush built the first automatically operated wind turbine for electricity production in Cleveland, Ohio. Advances in recent decades greatly lowered the cost of wind power making it one of the most competitive alternate energies and competitive with higher priced natural gas (before shale gas). Wind energy's main problem is that it is intermittent and therefore needs grid extensions and energy storage to be a reliable main energy source. =Geothermal energy= 144x144px Prince Piero Ginori Conti tested the first geothermal power generator on 4 July 1904 in Larderello, Italy. It successfully lit four light bulbs.Tiwari, G. N.; Ghosal, M. K. Renewable Energy Resources: Basic Principles and Applications. Alpha Science Int'l Ltd., 2005 Later, in 1911, the world's first commercial geothermal power plant was built there. Italy was the world's only industrial producer of geothermal electricity until 1958. Geothermal requires very hot underground temperatures near the surface to generate steam which is used in a low temperature steam plant. Geothermal power is only used in a few areas. Italy supplies all of the electrified rail network with geothermal power. =Solar energy= 137x137px Electricity production from solar energy either directly through photovoltaic cells or indirectly such as by producing steam to drive a steam turbine generator. Current extent of electrification World map showing the percentage of the population in each country with access to mains electricity, as of 2017. While electrification of cities and homes has existed since the late 19th century, about 840 million people (mostly in Africa) had no access to grid electricity in 2017, down from 1.2 billion in 2010.Closing Sub-Saharan Africa‚Äôs Electricity Access Gap: Why Cities Must Be Part of the Solution Most recent progress in electrification took place between the 1950s and 1980s. Vast gains were seen in the 1970s and 1980s - from 49 percent of the world's population in 1970 to 76 percent in 1990.http://iis- db.stanford.edu/pubs/22196/From_Acai_to_Access_(Published_Version).pdf Recent gains have been more modest - by the early 2010s 81 to 83 percent of the world's population had access to electricity. Energy resilience Electricity is a \\"sticky\\" form of energy, in that it tends to stay in the continent or island where it is produced. It is also multi-sourced; if one source suffers a shortage, electricity can be produced from other sources, including renewable sources. As a result, in the long term it is a relatively resilient means of energy transmission. In the short term, because electricity must be supplied at the same moment it is consumed, it is somewhat unstable, compared to fuels that can be delivered and stored on-site. However, that can be mitigated by grid energy storage and distributed generation.

Different variants of the software support the original Robotics Invention System, the NXT, and the EV3. It includes a Java virtual machine, which allows Lego Mindstorms robots to be programmed in the Java programming language. It also includes 'iCommand.jar' which allows you to communicate via bluetooth with the original firmware of the Mindstorm. It is often used for teaching Java to first-year computer science students . The leJOS-based robot Jitter flew around on the International Space Station in December 2001. Pronunciation According to the official website: : In English, the word is similar to Legos, except there is a J for Java, so the correct pronunciation would be Ley-J-oss. If you are brave and want to pronounce the name in Spanish, there is a word \\"lejos\\" which means far, and it is pronounced Lay- hoss. The name leJOS was conceived by Jos√© Sol√≥rzano, based on the acronym for Java Operating System (JOS), the name of another operating system for the RCX, legOS, and the Spanish word \\"lejos.\\" History leJOS was originally conceived as TinyVM and developed by Jos√© Sol√≥rzano in late 1999. It started out as a hobby open source project, which he later forked into what is known today as leJOS. Many contributors joined the project and provided important enhancements. Among them, Brian Bagnall, J√ºrgen Stuber and Paul Andrews, who later took over the project as Jos√© essentially retired from it. As of August 20, 2006, the original leJOS for the RCX has been discontinued with the 3.0 release. Soon afterwards, iCommand, a library to control the NXT from a Bluetooth-enabled computer via LCP, was released. This library made use of the standard Lego firmware. This library was later superseded by leJOS NXJ 0.8. In January 2007, a full port to the new Lego Mindstorms NXT was released as a firmware replacement. This is far faster (x15 or so) than the RCX version, has more memory available, a menu system, Bluetooth support using the Bluecove library, and allows access to many other NXT features. In 2008, versions 0.5, 0.6 and 0.7 were released. In addition to numerous improvements to the core classes, the Eclipse plugin was released along with a new version of the tutorial. In 2009, there were 2 more major releases: 0.8 and 0.85. In May 2011 0.9 was released. Broadly speaking, the releases have concentrated on improvements to navigation algorithms, as well as support for numerous 3rd party sensors and the Eclipse plug-in. In 2013, development began on a port to the Lego Mindstorms EV3 brick. In 2014, the 0.5 and 0.6 alpha versions were released. In 2015, beta versions 0.9 and 0.9.1 were released. Since November 2014 leJOS is used in a slightly adapted version also in the open-source project Open Roberta.  Architecture  leJOS NXJ provides support for access to the robot's I¬≤C ports. This allows access to the standard sensors and motors (ultrasonic distance sensor, touch sensor, sound sensor and light sensor). Other companies, such as MindSensors and HiTechnic have extended this basic set by providing advanced sensors, actuators and multiplexers. leJOS NXJ includes Java APIs for these products. By taking advantage of the object- oriented structure of Java, the developers of LeJOS NXJ have been able to hide the implementation details of sensors and actuators behind multiple interfaces. This allows the robotics developer to work with high-level abstractions without having to worry about details like the hexadecimal addresses of hardware components. The project includes implementations of the commonly used feedback controller, the PID controller and the Kalman filter noise reduction algorithm. leJOS NXJ also provides libraries that support more abstract functions such as navigation, mapping and behavior based robotics. Here is a simple leJOS program: import lejos.nxt.Motor; import lejos.nxt.Button; public class Example { public static void main(String[] args) { Motor.A.forward(); Button.waitForPress(); Motor.A.backward(); Button.waitForPress(); System.exit(1); } }  Community  Since the first alpha release of leJOS NXJ in 2007, the project has had a consistently active following. # Between January 2007 and October 2011 there were over 225,000 downloads # In 2011 the downloads averaged between 4000 and 6000 a month # In 2011 over 500 topics were discussed in the forums. Each topic often generated several hundred posts. # Between May 2012 and March 2013 there were over 36,000 download of release 0.91 The core development team has been a relatively small group. Contributions are accepted from other members of the community. Several of the interfaces to third party sensors and actuators have been contributed by members outside the core team. The platform has been used in university robotics courses, undergraduate research projects and as a platform for robotics research.  NXJ and the Java platform  As leJOS NXJ is a Java project, it builds on the wealth of functionality inherent in the Java platform. There are leJOS NXJ plugins for the two leading Java IDEs: Eclipse and NetBeans. Robotics developers can take advantage of the standard functionality of an IDE (code completion, refactoring and testing frameworks) as well as point-and-click implementation of NXJ functions: compiling, linking and uploading. A wealth of java open source projects (such as Apache Math) are likewise available to the NXJ robotics developer.

Early life  Born in St Botolph's parish, Colchester, Essex, the son of William Halsnoth, a baker, and his wife Agnes, Harsnett was probably educated at Colchester's free school, now Colchester Royal Grammar School. After leaving school, he was inducted into King's College, Cambridge on 8 September 1576 and removed into Pembroke College, Cambridge where he gained a BA in 1580/1 and was elected a Fellow on 27 November 1583. In 1583 he was ordained into the Church of England, where he was soon disciplined by Archbishop Whitgift for preaching against predestination at St Paul's Cross on 27 October 1584. As Hughson notes, \\"he was one of those divines who opposed the decrees of the synod of Dort and he wrote a very learned treatise against absolute predestination\\". In 1584 he proceeded Master of Arts by seniority. Academic career In March 1587 Harsnett became headmaster of Colchester Royal Grammar School. In recognition of his achievements, the school has had, since 1908, a school house bearing his name. Preferring his studies at Cambridge University to the position, he resigned his office in November 1588, disliking the \\"painful trade of teaching\\", and returned to Pembroke Hall where he studied divinity, gaining his BD c.1590. He re-entered himself into Pembroke Hall, where he was first a fellow and was elected master on 1 November 1605, remaining in that position until 1616, when he resigned because accusations totalling fifty-seven articles were made against him, by the Fellows of Pembroke to King James I. He was also Vice-Chancellor of Cambridge University for the years 1606, the same year he gained his Doctor of Divinity degree, and 1609. Ministerial career Chigwell School, which Harsnett founded, circa 1904 In 1592 he served the office of Junior Proctor and five years later became chaplain to Dr Bancroft, then Bishop of London and shortly to become Archbishop of Canterbury by whose favour he quickly rose through the ranks. On the authority of Bancroft, he obtained the rectory of St Margaret, New Fish Street, London which he resigned in 1604 and the vicarage of Chigwell in Essex on 14 June 1597 which he resigned in 1605. Whilst at Chigwell, his wife, Thomazine, died in 1601, having given birth in 1600 to a short-lived daughter. Even after 1605 he continued to reside at Chigwell, where he had purchased a house and estate. In 1619 he purchased land in the parish on which he founded both a Latin school (which survives as Chigwell School) and an English school in 1629. In 1598 he was promoted, becoming the prebendary of Mapesbury on 5 August and on 17 January 1602 the archdeacon of Essex ‚Äì both posts chosen for him by Bishop Bancroft. On 16 April 1604 Sir Thomas Lucas of Colchester, father of Charles Lucas, installed him in the rectory of Shenfield, Essex. Having been Bishop of Chichester since 13 November 1609, on 8 August 1619, he became Bishop of Norwich, resigning the living of Stisted he had held since 1609. He spent most of his time when absent from his city at Ludham, where he built a chapel and consecrated it for divine worship. In May 1624 he was charged before Parliament with high-handedness by the citizens of Norwich and in that same year he also persecuted the Puritans in Great Yarmouth, leading to a complaint by them to King Charles I in 1627. On 26 November 1628, he was elected Archbishop of York, and on 10 November 1629 he was sworn a Privy Councillor.  Death and commemoration  Towards the end of his life he fell ill, signing his will on 13 February 1631, to which he signed a codicil on 18 May, and taking the waters at Bath in April of that year. He died at Moreton- in-Marsh while returning from Bath on 25 May 1631 and his body took ten days to return to Chigwell. He was buried at St Mary's Church, Chigwell alongside his wife and daughter, both named Thomasine who had both died in 1601. A brass of Harsnett can be found in St Mary's Church, Chigwell, although it has been moved from its original position over his grave. The image on the brass is believed to be a true representation of him and he most likely sat for it shortly before his death. It has been suggested that it is of Flemish origin but, because of the similarities it bears to the brass of Sir John Filmer in East Sutton, Kent, it is now believed to be by Edward Marshall. His epitaph on the brass reads: > Hic iacet Samuell Harsnett quondam vicarius huius ecclesi√¶ primo indignus > episcopus Cicestrensis deindignior Norwicencis demum indignissim' > archiepiscop' Eborace√± qui obiit XXV die maii anno d√±i: 1631 > Here lies Samuel Harsnett once vicar of this church, first unworthy bishop > of Chichester, then more unworthy bishop of Norwich, finally most unworthy > archbishop of York; he died on the 25th day in May in the year of our Lord > 1631. There are two changes from the inscription he requested in his will ‚Äì his name is spelt as \\"Samuell\\", not \\"Samuel\\" and \\"deindignior\\" should have been \\"dein indignior\\". In his home town of Colchester he is commemorated by a statue on the town hall and a stained glass window in St. Botolph's Church. His library of theological works was bequeathed to the borough of Colchester for the use of local clergy; it can now be found in the library of the University of Essex.  Religious views  Harsnett is noted for his sceptical attitude towards demons and witchcraft. As the chaplain to Bishop Bancroft, Harsnett was commissioned to write a treatise condemning the 1590s exorcisms of John Darrell, having sat on the 1598 commissions which investigated his activities. Darrell, curate at St. Mary's Church, Nottingham was a puritan minister who performed a series of public exorcisms in the English Midlands. Eventually, the exorcisms caused such a disturbance that they attracted the attention of Anglican authorities in London. Harsnett's A Discovery of the Fraudulent Practises of John Darrel (1599) was a polemical piece intended to discredit Darrell's puritan agenda. It was drafted as a piece of political propaganda, but it also genuinely questioned the belief in demons. In this way, Harsnett sought natural explanations for supposedly supernatural phenomena. In 1603, he wrote another book, A Declaration of Egregious Popish Impostures, published by order of the Privy Council, which condemned exorcisms performed by Roman Catholic priests in the 1580s. Shakespeare used this book as a source, pulling words and phrases when writing the play King Lear, mainly spoken by Edgar while he feigns madness, and John Milton is said to have been influenced by it when writing L'Allegro. As a member of England's religious authority, Harsnett's sceptical attitudes, divided equally between puritanism and popery, set important precedents for English policy. For example, by coming close \\"to denying the reality of witchcraft\\" he may have contributed to the relative lack of witch hunts in England, compared to other countries. Harsnett was a strident anti-Calvinist. The extent of his Arminian theology has been discussed by historians.  Writings  Harsnett is known to have written eight works, which are as follows: *Nemo necessario damnatur, a treatise written against Calvinism, which may have been his BD thesis; *De Necessitate baptismi; *Sermon against predestination, on the text of Ezekiel chapter 33, verse 11; preached at St Paul's Cross in 1584; *A Discovery of the Fraudulent practises of Iohn Darrel, Bacheler of Artes, in his proceedings concerning the Pretended Possession and dispossession of William Somers at Nottingham; of Thomas Darling, the boy of Burton at Caldwell; and of Katherine Wright at Mansfield, & Whittlington; and of his dealings with one Mary Couper at Nottingham, detecting in some sort the deceitfull trade in these latter dayes of casting out Deuils, London, John Wolfe, 1599; *A Declaration of egregious Popish Impostures, to with-draw the harts of her Maiesties Subiects from their allegeance, and from the truth of Christian Religion professed in England, under the pretence of casting out deuils.

It was founded by Christabel and Emmeline Pankhurst when they dissolved the Women's Social and Political Union in November 1917. The party ran on the slogan ‚ÄòVictory, National Security and Progress‚Äô, in an effort to conflate winning of the war with the women's cause.  Policies  The party proclaimed the need for more stringent measures in support of Britain in World War I.Mary Davis, Sylvia Pankhurst (Pluto Press, 1999) Indeed, it gave out white feathers to all conscientious objectors. It changed the name of its paper from The Suffragette to Britannia, a paper which concentrated on enlisting women for the war effort. It claimed that this was far more important than the fight for women's suffrage, although it also had policies on equality for women and the abolition of trade unions. The Party campaigned for Naturalisation Laws to be changed to prevent Germans and their allies gaining British nationality and exploiting it after the war. The Party was firmly Unionist and supported strengthening the British Empire by bringing its natural resources and transport systems under British control. The Party advocated a number of feminist policies, including: equal pay for equal work, equal marriage and divorce laws, equality of parental rights and raising the age of consent. The Party campaigned for maternity and infant care, which would be subsidized by parents according to their income. Speaking in 1918, Christabel asserted that the Women's Party stands 'first for the defence of our frontiers, and then reforms inside our frontiers, to make life worth living and fighting for'.  Reception  The Women's Party was launched at a time of growing domestic support for the Labour Party and the international rise of Bolshevism in Russia. With this in mind, its anti-Bolshevik stance attracted the approval of the British Government along with industrialists, such as Lord Leverhulme. At the 1918 general election, following the passing of the Parliament (Qualification of Women) Act 1918, the party stood Christabel as a candidate in the Smethwick constituency in Staffordshire. She won 47.8% of the vote, losing by only 778 votes to her only opponent, the Labour Party's John Davison.* In 1919, Christabel was chosen as the Coalition's Prospective Parliamentary Candidate for Westminster Abbey, but in the event no by-election was held until 1921, when the Conservative Party chose their own candidate to represent the Coalition.Britain Unlimited: Dame Christabel Pankhurst The Women's Party wound itself up in June 1919.

Little and starring Brandon Lee, Powers Boothe and Nick Mancuso. The film was released in the United States on August 21, 1992. Lee was reportedly in talks with 20th Century Fox about making Rapid Fire 2, prior to his death.  Plot  The film opens in Thailand, with Antonio Serrano, a mafia drug distributor visiting long-time associate Kinman Tau, a drug kingpin. Serrano is having troubles and wants them to work together, but his request is not reciprocated. Turned off from politics after witnessing the death of his father at Tiananmen Square in China, Los Angeles art student Jake Lo is lured to a party of Chinese pro- democracy activists. While there, he witnesses Serrano killing party sponsor Carl Chang, who was an associate of Tau. When Serrano and his men attempt to kill Jake, he swiftly disarms them using martial arts techniques. Jake is placed under protective custody by federal agents, who coerce him into coming to Chicago and testifying against Serrano. When the agents at the safe house are revealed to be corrupt, Jake escapes through the window and encounters a young police detective named Karla Withers, with whom he develops an immediate bond. Withers' partner, Lieutenant Mace Ryan, helps Jake evade his pursuers and reveals that he had been pursuing Tau for 10 years. Jake is persuaded by Ryan to help him exploit Serrano's FBI ties and obtain information about Tau's next shipment. Though the sting operation is successful, Jake is nearly killed in a barrage of gunfire and assaults Ryan after he reveals his involvement wasn't necessary. Later that night, Jake and Karla begin a romance and have sex in her apartment, while Ryan and his team lead a raid at the revealed location of the next shipment: Tau's laundry factory. Both the lovemaking and the events of the raid are shown alternately as they occur in actual time, culminating with Serrano being murdered in his cell by one of Tau's henchman. Jake, Ryan and Withers subsequently team up to bring down Tau once more. Though Ryan and Withers are captured by Tau's men, Jake rescues them and eventually kills Tau at a train platform. He and Karla then evacuate Ryan from the burning factory and ride to the hospital together in an ambulance.

After Brandon Lee's death while filming The Crow, his films, such as Rapid Fire, saw a surge in video sales. 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment released the DVD in Region 2 in the United Kingdom on 16 July 2001, and Region 1 in the United States on May 21, 2002.  Production  Paul Attanasio was brought in as a script doctor to re-work the film's story before shooting. School scenes were filmed at Occidental College in Los Angeles. Many of the fight scenes were orchestrated by Lee, which contain elements of his father Bruce Lee's Jeet Kune Do fighting style.  Reception  Stephen Hunter of the Baltimore Sun wrote that the film's fast pace, which he compared to video games, leaves Lee unable to show his charisma. Although he called the film a \\"disaster\\", Chicago Tribune critic Gene Siskel called Lee likable and appealing. Writing in the Los Angeles Times, Kevin Thomas described the film as \\"better than Enter the Dragon\\" and a star-making role for Lee. Stephen Holden of The New York Times said the film exploits the death of Lee's father, martial arts actor Bruce Lee, to make his character seem more sympathetic. On Rotten Tomatoes, a review aggregator that includes both contemporary and modern reviews, it has an approval rating of 45% based on 22 reviews; the average rating is 4.86/10. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"B+\\" on an A+ to F scale.

During his earlier career he also covered the fall of Saigon, was the first black television correspondent to cover the White House, and anchored his own news broadcast, CBS Sunday Night News with Ed Bradley. He received several awards for his work including the Peabody, the National Association of Black Journalists Lifetime Achievement Award, Radio Television Digital News Association Paul White (journalist) Award and 19 Emmy Awards. Early life Bradley was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. His parents divorced when he was two years old, after which he was raised by his mother, Gladys, who worked two jobs to make ends meet. Bradley, who was referred to with the childhood name of \\"Butch Bradley,\\" was able to see his father in Detroit, in the summertime, who had a vending machine business and owned a restaurant. When he was nine, his mother enrolled him in the Holy Providence School, an all-black Catholic boarding school run by the Sisters of the Blessed Sacrament at Cornwells Heights, Pennsylvania. He attended Mount Saint Charles Academy, in Woonsocket, Rhode Island. He graduated in 1959 from Saint Thomas More Catholic Boys High School in West Philadelphia and then another historically black school, Cheyney State College (now Cheyney University of Pennsylvania) in Cheyney, Pennsylvania, graduating in 1964 with a degree in education. His first job was teaching sixth grade at the William B. Mann Elementary School in Philadelphia's Wynnefield community. While he was teaching, he moonlighted at the old WDAS studios on Edgley Drive in Philadelphia's Fairmount Park, working for free and, later, for minimum wage. He programmed music, read news, and covered basketball games and other sports. Career Bradley's introduction to news reporting came at WDAS-FM during the riots in Philadelphia in the 1960s. In 1967 he landed a full-time job at the CBS-owned New York City radio station WCBS. In 1971, he moved to Paris, France. Initially living off his savings, he eventually ran out of money and began working as a stringer for CBS News, covering the Paris Peace Talks. In 1972 he volunteered to be transferred to Saigon to cover the Vietnam War, as well as spending time in Phnom Penh covering the war in Cambodia. It was there that he was injured by a mortar round, receiving shrapnel wounds to his back and arm. Jimmy Carter and Bradley, 1978 In 1974, he moved to Washington, D.C., and was promoted to covering the Carter campaign in 1976. He then became CBS News White House correspondent (the first black White House television correspondent) until 1978, when he was invited to move to CBS Reports, where he served as principal correspondent until 1981. He also anchored the CBS Sunday Night News from 1976 until 1981. That year, Walter Cronkite departed as anchor of the CBS Evening News and was replaced by 60 Minutes correspondent Dan Rather, leaving an opening on the program that was filled by Bradley. Over the course of Bradley's 26 years on 60 Minutes, he did over 500 stories, covering nearly every possible type of news, from \\"heavy\\" segments on war, politics, poverty, and corruption, to lighter biographical pieces, or stories on sports, music, and cuisine. Among others, he interviewed Howard Stern, Laurence Olivier, Subcomandante Marcos, Timothy McVeigh, Neil Armstrong, Michael Jackson, Mick Jagger, Bill Bradley, the 92-year-old George Burns, and Michael Jordan, as well as conducting the first television interview of Bob Dylan in 20 years. Some of his quirkier moments included playing blackjack with the blind Ray Charles, interviewing a Soviet general in a Russian sauna, and having a practical joke played on him by Muhammad Ali. Bradley's favorite segment on 60 Minutes was when, as a 40-year-old correspondent, he interviewed 64-year-old singer Lena Horne. He said, \\"If I arrived at the pearly gates and Saint Peter said, 'What have you done to deserve entry?' I'd just say, 'Did you see my Lena Horne story?'\\" On the show, Bradley was known for his sense of style. He was the first male correspondent to regularly wear an earring on the air. He had his left ear pierced in 1986 and says he was inspired to do it after receiving encouragement from Liza Minnelli following an interview with the actress. He is also thus far the only male 60 Minutes anchor to do so, though male correspondents from other network programs, including Jim Vance, Jay Schadler, and Harold Dow, later wore earrings on camera. Besides 60 Minutes, Bradley also anchored the news magazine program \\"Street Stories\\" on CBS from 1992 to 1993. Personal life Although Bradley never had children, he was married to Haitian-born artist Patricia Blanchet, whom he had met at New York‚Äôs Museum for African Art where she was working as Director of Development. Despite the age difference (she was 24 years younger than he), Bradley pursued her, and they dated for 10 years before marrying in a private ceremony in Woody Creek, Colorado, where they had a home. Bradley also maintained two homes in New York: one in East Hampton, and the other in New York City. In the early 1970s, Bradley had a brief romantic relationship with Jessica Savitch, who at that time was an administrative assistant for CBS News and later became an NBC News anchor. After the relationship ended, Bradley and Savitch continued to have a non-romantic social and professional relationship until her death in 1983. Bradley was known for loving all kinds of music, but he was especially a jazz music enthusiast. He hosted the Peabody Award‚Äìwinning Jazz at Lincoln Center on National Public Radio for over a decade until just before his death. A big fan of the Neville Brothers, Bradley performed on stage with the bunch, and was known as \\"the fifth Neville brother\\". Bradley was also friends with Jimmy Buffett, and would often perform onstage with him, under the name \\"Teddy\\". Bradley had limited musical ability and did not have an extensive repertoire, but would usually draw smiles by singing the 1951 classic by Billy Ward and the Dominoes, \\"Sixty Minute Man\\". Death Bradley died on November 9, 2006, at Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan, of complications from lymphocytic leukemia. He was 65 years old. Legacy Bradley was honored in April 2007 with a traditional jazz funeral procession at the New Orleans Jazzfest, of which he was a large supporter. The parade, which took place on the first day of the six-day festival, circled the fairgrounds and included two brass bands. Columnist Clarence Page wrote: Bradley had been a season ticket holder to the New York Knicks for over 20 years. On November 13, 2006, they honored him with a moment of silence. On the 60 Minutes program after Bradley's death, his longtime friend Wynton Marsalis closed the show with a solo trumpet performance, playing some of the music Bradley loved best. In 1994, Bradley created the Ed Bradley Scholarship, which has since been offered annually by the Radio Television Digital News Association's Foundation (RTDNF)Ed Bradley Scholarship page at RTDNF. to outstanding aspiring journalists in recognition of Bradley's legacy and contributions to journalism. On June 16, 2018, a Philadelphia mural honoring Bradley was dedicated and celebrated. Awards * Emmy Award 19 times * Peabody Award for his African AIDS report, \\"Death By Denial\\" * Robert F.

He is signed to WWE, appearing on the SmackDown brand, where he currently serves as the on-screen \\"special counsel\\" of the current WWE Universal Champion Roman Reigns. Heyman owned and was the creative genius behind the Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) promotion from 1993 until its closure in 2001. Before running and owning ECW, he was a manager under the ring name Paul E. Dangerously in World Championship Wrestling (WCW) and other promotions. He is the co-owner of the Looking4Larry Agency in New York City, and was personally named one of Advertising Age Top 100 Global Marketers. In WWE, Heyman currently manages Roman Reigns and has managed a record six WWE Champions, including Brock Lesnar, Big Show, Kurt Angle, Rob Van Dam, and CM Punk. Critics have praised his abilities at managing and on the microphone. Heyman has also competed sporadically in matches, including the WWE Championship main event of the 2002 Rebellion pay- per-view. Early life Heyman was born on September 11, 1965, in Westchester County, New York, the son of Sulamita (n√©e Szarf; 1928‚Äì2009) and Richard S. Heyman (1926‚Äì2013), a prominent personal injury attorney and World War II veteran. He is Jewish; his mother was a Holocaust survivor who suffered through experiences in Auschwitz, Bergen-Belsen, and the ≈Å√≥d≈∫ Ghetto. By age 11, he was running a mail order business selling celebrity and sports memorabilia from his home.The rise & Fall of ECW: Extreme Championship Wrestling. Thom Loverro, Paul Heyman, Tommy Dreamer While still a teenager, he fast-talked his way backstage at a World Wide Wrestling Federation (WWWF) event at Madison Square Garden as a photojournalist. He was paid by the company for several of his photographs. He graduated from Edgemont High School. He attended SUNY Purchase and worked on-air as an opinionated, controversial host at SUNY's radio station and the WARY-FM New York radio station for Westchester Community College; in 1985, at the age of 19, he became a photographer, then a producer and promoter for the New York City nightclub Studio 54. Professional wrestling career =Early career (1987‚Äì1988)= Heyman decided he wanted to work in professional wrestling when he saw Vince McMahon interviewing Superstar Billy Graham. He began as a photographer when he was 13 and bought his own photo lab to take photos of pro wrestlers in New York. He published his own newsletter, The Wrestling Times Magazine, and wrote for third-party wrestling publications such as Pro Wrestling Illustrated.Slam! Sports ‚Äì Wrestling ‚Äì Paul Heyman, Slam.canoe.ca. Retrieved May 8, 2012. At the age of 14, he called Capitol Wrestling Corporation, the parent company of the World Wide Wrestling Federation, and obtained a backstage pass for Madison Square Garden, his first official work in pro wrestling. Heyman met Dusty Rhodes at a Jim Crockett Promotions taping, when he entered a production meeting. In 1985, Heyman was hired by New York Studio 54 as photographer. The same year, he became producer of Studio 54 and hosted the first Wrestle Party 85 show. He called Jim Crockett, who sent Ric Flair, Dusty Rhodes and Magnum TA. The show featured Bam Bam Bigelow's debut and an award to Flair. At the urging of Bigelow, Heyman made his managerial debut on January 2, 1987, initially appearing on the Northeast independent circuit before moving to a more high-profile stint with Championship Wrestling from Florida in February 1987. There, he joined forces with Kevin Sullivan and Oliver Humperdink, and acquired the name Paul E. Dangerously because of his resemblance to Michael Keaton's character in Johnny Dangerously. After CWF was absorbed by Jim Crockett Promotions, Bigelow brought him to Memphis and the Continental Wrestling Association (CWA) to manage Tommy Rich and Austin Idol in a heated feud with Jerry Lawler, a war which later carried over to the American Wrestling Association (AWA), with the Original Midnight Express (Dennis Condrey and Randy Rose) taking over for Idol and the face-turned Rich. The Paul E. Dangerously gimmick was an extension of Heyman's own personality: a brash New Yorker with a yuppie attitude, often seen holding a mobile phone, which was occasionally used as a \\"foreign object\\" (according to Heyman, he decided to use the mobile phone as a weapon when he watched Gordon Gekko in Wall Street). After departing the AWA, Heyman went to the Alabama-based Continental Wrestling Federation. Heyman joined with Eddie Gilbert's Hot Stuff Inc. stable. Behind the scenes, Gilbert was the head booker of the promotion, and Heyman became his assistant. Heyman was also the head booker for Windy City Wrestling in Chicago and started developing a reputation as being an innovative television writer and producer. =National Wrestling Alliance/World Championship Wrestling (1988‚Äì1993)= In 1988, Heyman jumped to Jim Crockett Promotions, where Dangerously again managed the Original Midnight Express in a feud with the new Midnight Express (Bobby Eaton and Stan Lane) and their manager, Jim Cornette, as well as managing \\"Mean\\" Mark Callous. He settled into the role of an announcer, joining Jim Ross to call the matches on WTBS' World Championship Wrestling and other programming. Heyman admitted he learned more working with Ross than from his previous mentors. While in- between stints in WCW, Heyman went to work for ICW as a writer, but was fired on his first day in the middle of his first TV taping.Wrestling Observer Newsletter (November 27, 1989). In 1991, WCW needed to re-structure its \\"heels\\", so Heyman returned to the role of spokesman and ringside manager as the manager of the Dangerous Alliance, with Rick Rude as the centerpiece of the stable. According to Heyman, he and Stone Cold Steve Austin learned their craft from Rude. Heyman led Rude to the United States title and the Anderson- Eaton tag team to the Tag Team titles. The Dangerous Alliance dominated WCW through most of 1992.The Wrestler, May 1992 issue article: Anderson and Eaton win the world belts-The Dangerous Alliance two steps away from a title monopoly!Pro Wrestling Illustrated, March 1993 issue, p. 45. =NWA Eastern/Extreme Championship Wrestling (1993‚Äì2001)= Heyman at an ECW show in 1998 Heyman addressing the crowd at an ECW television taping in 1999 After departing WCW, Heyman attempted to start a new promotion in Texas with Jim Crockett, Jr.. Disagreement arose, however, as Crockett wanted to build a traditional wrestling brand, while Heyman believed traditional wrestling was antiquated and a new take on the genre was needed.\\"Dangerously did work some ECW shows during the year but most of the year saw him trying to get a new promotion off the ground in Texas with Jim Crockett, Jr. The effort would not fly and, by October, Gordon wanted Dangerously brought into ECW\\", Eddiegilbert.com. Retrieved May 8, 2012. At this time, Eddie Gilbert was a booker for a Philadelphia-based promotion, National Wrestling Alliance (NWA)'s Eastern Championship Wrestling, which he did under the ownership of a local pawn shop owner named Tod Gordon. Heyman came in to help Gilbert teach the younger wrestlers how to perform on interviews, but Gilbert's erratic behavior became too much for Gordon, who had a major falling out with Gilbert right before the \\"Ultra Clash\\" event on September 18, 1993. From that point forward, Heyman was in charge of the creative direction of the company. As Paul E. Dangerously, he managed a few wrestlers, including Sabu and 911. A year later, the company was the flagship promotion of the struggling NWA. A tournament was scheduled to be held in August 1994 for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship, at an ECW-hosted event mostly featuring ECW wrestlers. The proposed outcome was the current ECW champion Shane Douglas becoming champion, but Heyman conspired with Douglas and Gordon without the knowledge of NWA president Dennis Coralluzzo to have Douglas (and by extension, ECW itself) publicly denounce the NWA and its \\"tradition\\" after winning the tournament. In his post-match speech, Douglas aggressively assaulted the title's lineage, throwing the belt itself down, proclaiming the NWA a \\"dead organization\\" and declaring his ECW title a world-level championship. The plan for this shoot screwjob was known only to those three.The New Online Home of The Interactive Interview, WrestlingEpicenter.com. Retrieved May 17, 2015. That same week, Heyman and Tod Gordon rechristened the promotion, eliminating the regional branding \\"Eastern\\" and declaring the promotion Extreme Championship Wrestling. They broke the company away from the NWA, and ECW became its own entity. Heyman encouraged wrestlers to express their true feelings about the WWF, the NWA, and WCW. Heyman bought out Gordon and became sole owner of ECW. During his time in ECW, Heyman found an ally in Vince McMahon's WWF. McMahon had sent some WWF wrestlers to ECW (under WWF payroll) to develop them and was interested in some ECW wrestlers, such as Terry Gordy and 2 Cold Scorpio. McMahon paid Heyman $1,000 per week to rent Scorpio. In the final days of ECW, Heyman did not appear on the show and was replaced as the leader of the backstage and creative by ECW wrestler Tommy Dreamer. Heyman could not get out of financial trouble and ECW closed on April 4, 2001. Heyman also supposedly had never told his wrestlers that the company was on its dying legs and was unable to pay them for a while. ECW entered into bankruptcy in 2001 (just weeks after WCW was sold to WWF for $2,000,000, after AOL Time Warner wrote off over $100 million in debt), with the company $7,000,000 in arrears, with over $3,000,000 owed to the company by InDemand pay per view.

During that time, he resumed his storyline rivalry with Jim Ross. In July, while retaining his commentator role, Heyman recreated ECW as a stable, which then immediately merged with Shane McMahon's WCW to form the Alliance during the Invasion angle. Heyman was \\"fired\\" following the 2001 Survivor Series when the Alliance lost a do or die match that marked the end of the invasion angle. Heyman was replaced on Raw commentary by the returning Jerry Lawler.it's good to be the king. Jerry Lawler pg. 372 Heyman was the lead writer for SmackDown! from July 2002 to February 2003. On Heyman's 2014 WWE documentary Ladies and Gentleman, My Name is Paul Heyman, Heyman stated that the SmackDown! brand he was writing was beating Raw in ratings, merchandise and live show attendance during a time McMahon wanted real-life competition between the Raw and SmackDown! brands. Managing Brock Lesnar (2002‚Äì2003) While he was in WWE, Tazz spoke to him about Brock Lesnar, a WWE developmental wrestler. Heyman began mentoring Lesnar, and McMahon decided to make Heyman Lesnar's manager. Heyman helped Lesnar capture the WWE Undisputed Championship 126 days after Lesnar's main roster debut when Lesnar beat The Rock at SummerSlam to also become the youngest WWE Undisputed Champion at the time. At the Survivor Series, Heyman turned on Lesnar and allied himself with Big Show, while helping him win the title from Lesnar in the process. SmackDown! general manager (2003‚Äì2004) After McMahon defeated his daughter Stephanie in October 2003 at the No Mercy pay-per-view, the storyline was that she was forced to resign from her position as general manager (GM) of SmackDown!. Heyman returned to television to assume Stephanie McMahon's on-camera role as General Manager. On March 22, 2004, he appeared on Raw to take part in the annual WWE draft lottery. During the show he was drafted to the Raw brand to work for Raw general manager Eric Bischoff. Instead, he decided to \\"quit\\" rather than work for Bischoff, the man he cited for the death of ECW by raiding its talent. Heyman was replaced as SmackDown! General Manager by his former client Kurt Angle on March 25. Ohio Valley Wrestling (2005‚Äì2006) On July 10, 2005, it was reported that Heyman took over the positions of head booker and writer in Ohio Valley Wrestling, a developmental territory maintained by WWE. It was during this time that he forged a real-life friendship with CM Punk. Return of ECW and departure (2005‚Äì2006) Heyman in the ring in 2006 On May 23, 2005, Heyman returned in a segment with Vince McMahon and Eric Bischoff announcing ECW One Night Stand, with Heyman in charge. On the May 22, 2006 episode of Raw, Heyman appeared as ECW Representative promoting ECW One Night Stand. On May 25, 2006 it was announced that ECW would relaunch, as a third WWE brand. Heyman was in charge of the new brand on-camera but had minimal creative input off-camera as well. On the May 29 episode of Raw, during a face-off with Mick Foley, Heyman announced that he was granted a draft pick from both Raw and SmackDown! by Vince McMahon. His Raw draft pick was former ECW wrestler (and Money in the Bank contract holder) Rob Van Dam, and his SmackDown! draft pick was Kurt Angle. Heyman predicted that Van Dam would defeat John Cena at ECW One Night Stand for the WWE Championship and then declare himself the new ECW World Heavyweight Champion. At ECW One Night Stand, Van Dam defeated Cena to win the WWE Championship. After Cena knocked an ECW referee unconscious, Edge (in a disguise) appeared and speared Cena through a table, before taking out SmackDown! referee Nick Patrick, allowing Van Dam to hit the Five-Star Frog Splash on Cena. With no referee available Heyman ran down the aisle to count the pinfall. The following night on Raw, Heyman confirmed that because the championship match was contested under \\"ECW rules\\" (which meant, essentially, there were no rules) that the decision stood and Van Dam was the \\"Undisputed\\" WWE Champion. As the WWE Champion, Van Dam was the number one man in the reformed ECW, so on the debut of ECW on Sci Fi the next night Heyman, announced as an \\"ECW Representative\\", presented him with the re-instated ECW World Heavyweight Championship. Van Dam elected to keep both title belts and was recognized as both the WWE and ECW Champion. On the July 4 episode of ECW, Heyman helped Big Show defeat Van Dam for the ECW title. At the Raw/ECW taping in South Carolina in December 2006, It was announced that Vince McMahon had sent Heyman home, citing \\"slumping television ratings and a disgruntled talent roster as causes for Mr. Heyman's dismissal\\". Heyman was escorted from the Coliseum and sent home. He was also immediately pulled from ECW's creative team after the altercation. McMahon was attempting to put the blame on Heyman for the poorly received pay-per-view, and after a meeting with Vince and Stephanie McMahon, Heyman legitimately left World Wrestling Entertainment but remained under contract. Heyman was against the decision of Lashley being booked to win the ECW World Championship, and instead wanted to have CM Punk win it, a decision McMahon disliked. this was the factor that was caused due to a behind-the-scenes dispute of creative disagreements between Heyman and Vince McMahon that led to the split, and that Heyman had been overruled on a number of decisions regarding the product over ECW's only pay-per-view under WWE, December to Dismember. Vince McMahon and Heyman clashed in front of several members of the writing team on McMahon's corporate jet the day after the pay-per-view. The argument with Vince McMahon was over a disagreement over the Elimination Chamber match at December to Dismember. Heyman thought that the Big Show should be eliminated in the Elimination Chamber match by CM Punk via submission, to push the rising star. Big Show agreed with this idea, wanting to help push Punk's career, but Vince McMahon disagreed, and Punk was ultimately eliminated first. After allegedly turning down an offer from Stephanie McMahon to return to his post writing TV for WWE Developmental television shows, Heyman officially parted ways quietly with WWE on December 17, 2006. =Return to WWE (2012‚Äìpresent)= Heyman brandishing the WWE Championship on behalf of champion CM Punk Advocate for Brock Lesnar and others (2012-present) In April 2012, Brock Lesnar returned to WWE. Heyman returned to WWE on the May 7, 2012 episode of Raw as Lesnar's legal advisor, announcing that Lesnar had quit the company. Behind the scenes, Heyman had no interest at first in returning to WWE, as he still felt he held bad blood with a lot of the staff, but reconsidered after Lesnar requested his presence after a lackluster promo with John Laurinaitis. The following week on Raw, Heyman confronted Triple H, handing him a lawsuit from Lesnar for breaching of contract. Triple H responded by shoving Heyman into the ropes, leading Heyman to announce that he would file a lawsuit against Triple H for assault and battery. On the June 18 Raw, Heyman declined Triple H's challenge for a match against Lesnar at SummerSlam on Lesnar's behalf. Later that month, Heyman stated that Brock Lesnar would answer Triple H's challenge himself at Raw 1000. Lesnar would go on to defeat Triple H at SummerSlam. On the September 3 episode of Raw, after CM Punk attacked John Cena, Heyman was seen driving the car Punk had entered. This began an alliance between CM Punk and Heyman. Heyman began accompanying Punk to the ring for his matches and promos. Because of the events of the previous weeks, on the February 11 episode of Raw, Heyman addressed the audience intending to resign from the company. CM Punk, however, convinced Heyman to not only stay with the company, but also to be in Punk's corner at the upcoming Elimination Chamber pay-per-view for his WWE Championship match. Around this time, Heyman quietly cut off his signature ponytail. Later, CM Punk earned the right to fight The Undertaker at WrestleMania 29 after winning a Fatal Four Way match at Old School Raw. In addition, Heyman's other client Brock Lesnar was booked for a No Holds Barred match against Triple H at WrestleMania, with Triple H's career on the line. At WrestleMania, both of Heyman's clients lost their matches. On the April 15 episode of Raw, Heyman announced Lesnar had challenged Triple H to a steel cage match at Extreme Rules. The following week, Triple H accepted the match and delivered a Pedigree to Heyman. As a response, Lesnar and Heyman invaded the headquarters of WWE and trashed Triple H's office. At Extreme Rules, Lesnar defeated Triple H with the help of Heyman. Heyman announced Michael McGillicutty as the newest \\"Paul Heyman guy\\" on the May 20 Raw and gave him the new name of Curtis Axel. On the May 27 episode of Raw, Heyman appeared on the Highlight Reel with Chris Jericho, where Jericho challenged CM Punk to a match at Payback which Heyman accepted on Punk's behalf. The next week, Heyman and Jericho signed the contract to make it official. The same week on SmackDown, Jericho faced off against Curtis Axel. As Jericho was closing in on the victory, Heyman stood on the announcers table and yelled: \\"It's clobbering time\\". Punk's music began to play, distracting Jericho long enough for Axel to pick up the victory. Brock Lesnar and Paul Heyman at WrestleMania 29 At Payback, Heyman coached Axel during his match with Wade Barrett and The Miz for the Intercontinental Championship with Axel winning the match and the title. Heyman accompanied Punk to the ring later in the show for his match with Chris Jericho. After Payback, a WWE.com exclusive video aired with Punk telling Heyman that he is his friend and not his client. On the June 17 episode of Raw, Punk challenged Alberto Del Rio, mentioning that he did not want Heyman managing him anymore. Following Punk's match, he was attacked by Lesnar. The next week on Raw, Punk demanded answers from Heyman, who swore he did not ask Lesnar to attack him. Punk forgave Heyman and then faced Darren Young and, following his win, was attacked by Titus O'Neil until Curtis Axel saved him, to Punk's chagrin. Heyman announced that he would team with Axel against The Prime Time Players the next week, again to Punk's disapproval. At Money in the Bank, Heyman betrayed CM Punk, costing him his chance at the Money in the Bank briefcase by hitting him three times with a ladder, knocking Punk off the ladder when he was ascending. On the August 5 episode of Raw, Punk retaliated by choking Heyman while Heyman was in Curtis Axel's corner during a match. This prompted Lesnar to enter the ring and attack Punk. Heyman later challenged Punk to a 1-on-1 match for the next week's Raw, which Punk accepted.CM Punk vs. Intercontinental Champion Curtis Axel went to a No Contest, wwe.com, August 5, 2013. Retrieved May 17, 2015. However, this was revealed to be a trap when Lesnar appeared prior to the match. The plan was foiled, however, when Heyman dared CM Punk to come into the ring and accept the challenge as CM Punk, who had anticipated the trap and hid under the ring, emerged and attacked Lesnar. However, Punk failed to get his hands on Heyman as Curtis Axel came to Heyman's aid.CM Punk surprised Paul Heyman and Brock Lesnar, wwe.com, August 12, 2013. Retrieved May 17, 2015. This led to a match between Lesnar and Punk at SummerSlam, which Lesnar won after interference from Heyman. Heyman and Axel delivered a brutal assault to Punk on Raw the following week, with Heyman breaking a kendo stick over Punk's back while Punk was handcuffed. Heyman was then booked to team with Axel against CM Punk in an elimination handicap match at Night of Champions. Heyman tried various times to get out of the match, which caused General Manager Brad Maddox to make the match into a no disqualification elimination handicap match. At Night of Champions, Punk eliminated Axel (who had been forced to defend his Intercontinental Championship against Kofi Kingston earlier in the night), leaving Heyman alone with Punk. After receiving a beating from Punk and being placed in handcuffs, just as Heyman did to Punk weeks before, Punk was about to attack Heyman with a kendo stick when Ryback interfered and cost Punk the match by putting Punk through a table. At Battleground, Punk pinned Ryback after a low blow. At Hell in a Cell, Punk defeated both Ryback and Heyman and after the match attacked Heyman on top of the cell, putting an end to their feud. On the November 11, 2013 episode of Raw, Heyman stated that he was no longer with Ryback as Ryback never officially accepted his proposal to become a \\"Paul Heyman Guy\\". After that, CM Punk came out to once again beat Heyman with a kendo stick. The following night on SmackDown, Heyman formally announced to Curtis Axel and Ryback that they were no longer Paul Heyman guys, therefore marking the end of Axel's association with Heyman as he continued to team with Ryback. Heyman returned on the December 30 episode of Raw alongside Brock Lesnar, who attacked Mark Henry. He stood by Lesnar as he feuded with Big Show and The Undertaker in the first four months of 2014. Lesnar ended The Undertaker's undefeated streak at WrestleMania XXX; this was Undertaker's first loss at a WrestleMania, as he previously had a record of 21 wins. Heyman in April 2014 On the Raw following WrestleMania, Cesaro revealed himself to be a \\"Paul Heyman Guy\\". Cesaro eventually declared himself no longer a \\"Paul Heyman Guy\\" on the July 21 episode of Raw. After Triple H announced that Randy Orton would challenge John Cena at SummerSlam, Roman Reigns came out and fought with Orton backstage. Heyman then came out and told Triple H to implement \\"Plan C\\" which was the return of Lesnar, who would have a match against Cena at SummerSlam. Lesnar defeated Cena at SummerSlam to win the WWE World Heavyweight Championship. At the Royal Rumble, Heyman was at ringside when Lesnar retained his WWE World Heavyweight Championship against Cena and Seth Rollins. At WrestleMania 31 Heyman was at ringside when Lesnar defended his WWE World Heavyweight Championship against the 2015 Royal Rumble winner Roman Reigns, but Lesnar was unsuccessful as Rollins cashed in his Money in the Bank briefcase and made the match a Triple Threat match. Rollins pinned Reigns for the win. The next night on Raw, Lesnar was suspended after he demanded a rematch for the title and attacked several innocent people. In June, Heyman and Lesnar returned to the WWE after Lesnar was named the No. 1 contender to the WWE World Heavyweight Championship, igniting a feud between Lesnar and Rollins. At Battleground, Lesnar defeated Rollins by disqualification, after The Undertaker returned and attacked Lesnar. The Undertaker further explained his actions as revenge not for defeating the streak but over Heyman's constant taunting. At SummerSlam, Heyman was at ringside when the match between Brock Lesnar and The Undertaker ended in controversy; the bell was rung as The Undertaker tapped out, but the referee did not see it. This allowed The Undertaker to defeat Lesnar after he passed out to the Hell's Gate. At Hell in a Cell, Heyman was present when Lesnar defeated Undertaker in the rematch, ending their feud. Heyman returned with Brock Lesnar on the January 11, 2016 Raw, and was ringside with Lesnar for the Royal Rumble. Lesnar was eliminated in the match by Bray Wyatt, after interference by the rest of The Wyatt Family. He accompanied Lesnar to the ring at WrestleMania 32 with Lesnar defeating Dean Ambrose in a No Holds Barred Street Fight. On July 19 at the 2016 WWE draft, Lesnar and Heyman were drafted to the Raw brand. Heyman returned alongside Lesnar on the August 1 episode of Raw hyping the Lesnar-Orton match at Summerslam while Lesnar took an RKO from Randy Orton. On the October 31 episode of Raw, Heyman and Rusev confronted Goldberg. Heyman was speared by Goldberg and later taken by ambulance to a hospital in Hartford, Connecticut. On the July 31 episode of Raw, Heyman appeared with Lesnar to announce to acting authority figure Kurt Angle that should Lesnar lose the championship at SummerSlam, they will both depart from the company. At Summerslam, Lesnar defeated Roman Reigns, Samoa Joe, and Braun Strowman in a Fatal 4-Way to retain the Universal Championship. At Extreme Rules, Kurt Angle said that if Universal Champion Brock Lesnar did not show up for Raw or agree to the terms of when Lesnar will defend the championship, then he would be stripped of the championship. On July 16, 2018 episode of Raw, Heyman interrupted Angle, who was about to strip Lesnar, and stated that Lesnar would hold on to the championship for however long he pleases. Angle then scheduled Lesnar to defend the championship at SummerSlam and if he did not, he would be indefinitely stripped. On the July 30 episode of Raw, Angle threatened Heyman's employment due to Lesnar's refusal to leave the backstage area and appear in the ring. After several failed attempts by Heyman to convince Lesnar to appear in the ring, Lesnar attacked Angle with an F-5 and choked Heyman. Two weeks later on the August 13, 2018 episode of Raw, Heyman revealed it was all a ruse as both Heyman (wielding pepper spray) and Lesnar ambushed Reigns. Heyman would accompany Lesnar going into SummerSlam, where Lesnar's 504 days reign as champion would come to an end after Lesnar was pinned by Reigns. Heyman would appear in a segment backstage the Raw after SummerSlam to invoke Lesnar's rematch clause against Roman Reigns for the Universal Championship at Hell in a Cell, but the rematch was denied by Kurt Angle. However, at Hell in a Cell, Heyman appeared as Lesnar interfered with the main event match between Roman Reigns and Braun Strowman. The next day, Heyman appeared on Raw, setting up a triple threat match at Crown Jewel between Brock Lesnar, Braun Strowman, and Roman Reigns for the Universal Championship. However, following Reigns' leukemia announcement, Heyman would instead set up a singles match between Lesnar and Strowman for the now-vacant title at Crown Jewel, a match Lesnar won. At WrestleMania 35, Heyman came out just after the opening segment, demanding that Seth Rollins fights his client to start off the main card. Lesnar and Rollins appeared thereafter. Lesnar then severely beat up Rollins, before the match started. When the match finally started, Rollins ultimately won the match in under 5 minutes, carrying out a low blow when a referee was knocked down, and executing his finisher three times. In June 2019, WWE announced that Paul Heyman would be the executive director of Raw. Heyman also appeared on SmackDown due to Lesnar being drafted to the brand in the 2019 WWE Draft in October, but shortly thereafter, Lesnar returned to Raw. On June 11, 2020, it was reported that Heyman had been removed from the executive director position of Raw, in an effort to streamline both the Raw and SmackDown writing teams into one group. However, Heyman was expected to maintain his on-screen role as the advocate for Brock Lesnar. Heyman continued to represent Lesnar up to WrestleMania 36, when Drew McIntyre defeated him for the WWE Championship in quick fashion, at a fan-less event, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Lesnar then opted not to sign a new contract, thus leaving his professional wrestling career in uncertainty due to him becoming a \\"free agent\\".https://www.sportskeeda.com/wwe/wwe-rumor- roundup-the-next-brock-lesnar-found-twist-the-undertaker-s-retirement-former- champion-returning-raw-21st-september-2020 Alliance with Roman Reigns (2020-present) On the August 28, 2020 episode of SmackDown, Heyman appeared in a backstage segment, allying himself with the returning Roman Reigns, which ultimately turned Reigns heel for the first time since 2014.  Legacy  Heyman's work as a promoter and booker has been praised by many wrestling fellows and critics. Former ECW World Heavyweight Champion Raven called him \\"the most creative genius the business has ever seen\\". Heyman is widely regarded as one of the best promo cutters of all time. Professional wrestling promoter Eric Bischoff, who was in charge of WCW, a company that was a rival and alternative to Heyman's ECW at the time in the 1990s, has been critical of Heyman in his book Controversy Creates Cash, where he stated \\"Heyman had been bad for business\\". Bischoff also claimed he could commit a whole chapter to pick Heyman apart but then didn't. Other media Heyman is the co-founder of the award-winning New York City firm The Looking4Larry Agency. The firm broke new ground with its initial campaign with EA, THQ video games, 2K Sports and the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino Las Vegas.

That taxon is no longer considered to represent a monophyletic grouping. Euopisthobranchia is a taxon containing a revised collection of opisthobranchs, and that taxon is considered monophyletic. Euopisthobranchia does not include some \\"traditional\\" opisthobranchs such as the Sacoglossa and the Acochlidiacea. The subclass Heterobranchia now contains all the species which used to be assigned to Opisthobranchia, plus all the species in the Pulmonata. The subclass Opisthobranchia included species in the order Cephalaspidea (bubble shells and headshield slugs), the sacoglossans, anaspidean sea hares, pelagic sea angels, sea butterflies, and many families of the Nudibranchia. Opisthobranch means \\"gills behind\\" (and to the right) of the heart. In contrast, Prosobranch means gills in front (of the heart). Opisthobranchs are characterized by two pairs of tentacles and a single gill behind and to the right of the heart. Opisthobranchia are known from as early as the Carboniferous.(in Czech) Pek I., Va≈°√≠ƒçek Z., Roƒçek Z., Hajn. V. & Mikul√°≈° R.: Z√°klady zoopaleontologie. ‚Äì Olomouc, 1996. 264 pp., . Bullina lineata  Taxonomy  Under the 1931 classification system drawn up by Johannes Thiele, the class Gastropoda was divided into three subclasses; Prosobranchia, Pulmonata and Opisthobranchia. The latter two were later combined into a single order. The current classification of the gastropods is more nuanced, with the following subclasses:Gofas, S. (2014). Gastropoda. Accessed through: World Register of Marine Species at http://www.marinespecies.org/aphia.php?p=taxdetails&id;=101 on 2015-02-12 * Subclass Caenogastropoda * Subclass Cocculiniformia * Subclass Heterobranchia * Subclass Neomphalina * Subclass Neritimorpha * Subclass Patellogastropoda * Subclass Vetigastropoda * Subclass Gastropoda incertae sedis =As a non- monophyletic taxon= Aplysia californica, a sea hare. It was speculated as far back as 1985 that the Opisthobranchia were paraphyletic, based on morphological evidence, and had given rise to the Pulmonata, a group also of subclass rank. Because the Pulmonata are a sibling group to an opisthobranch taxon, some authors argued that the Opisthobranchia are therefore not a monophyletic group and can no longer be accepted as a valid taxon. The opisthobranchs are now included within the subclass Heterobranchia, although many manuals and websites still use the old classification. A phylogenetic study published in November 2004, gave new definitions of the seven main lineages of the Opisthobranchia. However, in 2005, a study of rRNA gene sequences could not resolve monophyly versus paraphyly of the Opisthobranchia Subsequent taxonomic classification in 2005 overturned the Opisthobranchia as a valid clade, reclassifying it as an informal group within the Heterobranchia. Accordingly, articles no longer use the term Opisthobranchia, replacing it with Heterobranchia to emphasise a different concept. By 2011, the \\"Opisthobranchia\\" were declared artificial and obsolete and were replaced by new phylogenetic hypotheses. =Linnean taxonomy= Order Opisthobranchia Milne-Edwards, 1848 ‚Äì sea slugs *Suborder Cephalaspidea P.

Opisthobranchs have undergone detorsion, an evolutionary reversal of the half revolution torsion of their immediate ancestors. As a result of this detorsion, the visceral ganglia no longer overlap and are described as euthyneurous (as opposed to streptoneurous, the more common condition among gastropods, in which these ganglia form a distinct twist within the animal's body). There is no marked distinction between head and mantle. The tentacles, situated close to the mouth, are used for orientation. Behind them are the rhinophores, olfactory organs which often have complex forms. The middle part of the foot is the sole, used for locomotion. The sides of the foot have evolved into parapodia, fleshy winglike outgrowths. In several suborders, such as the Thecosomata and Gymnosomata, these parapodia are used to move in a swimming motion. Their eyes are simple pit-cup eyes with a lens and cornea capable of detecting light and the passage of shadows but not of producing a coherent image.  Ecology  Opisthobranchia represents a morphologically diverse group of gastropods occupying a great variety of ecological niches. Opisthobranchs have a global distribution, but are restricted almost exclusively to marine habitats with the only exception being few freshwater acochlidians. Defense Principally soft-bodied marine creatures with a reduced or absent shell and no operculum, opisthobranchs use other methods for protection. Due to a combination of outstanding camouflage and aggressive toxicity they have few predators. However, some use warning colouration. Animals that do predate opisthobranchs include other opisthobranchs and toxin-resistant predators like sea spiders. Opisthobranchs secrete irritants such as strong acids or accumulate toxins from their food. Aeolidioidea pirate the stinging cells from their cnidarian prey and use them for their own defense.Gosliner, Terrence (1987) Nudibranchs of Southern Africa p. 7 Diet Oxynoe olivacea Opisthobranchs may be herbivores, detritivores or carnivores. Being slow, the carnivores hunt sedentary prey. They may eat bryozoans, Cnidaria, or sponges, absorbing the sponge toxin for defensive purposes. Opisthobranchs may maintain the zooxanthellae of their coral prey and use their metabolic products for themselves. Some herbivorous slugs do the same with the chloroplasts of the algae they eat.Gosliner, Terrence (1987) Nudibranchs of Southern Africa p. 9 Communication Pleurobranchus mamillatus Like most lifeforms, they use chemical cues for much of their life cycle. The planktonic larvae float until a pheromone alerts them to a suitable settling site, sometimes delaying metamorphosis until favourable chemicals, such as prey pheromones, are detected. Some mating opisthobranchs release chemicals to attract conspecifics. Reproduction Winged snail Clione limacina, a sea angel. Opisthobranchs are hermaphrodites and have complex reproductive strategies, typically involving reciprocal sperm transfer and storage until the eggs are ready for fertilisation.Debelius, Helmut (2001) Nudibranchs and Sea Snails Indo-Pacific Field Guide p. 7 Ikan, Frankfurt Eggs are commonly laid in ribbons of varying structure. The egg ribbons are usually unique to each species and in some cases are the only means of differentiating them.Gosliner, Terrence (1987) Nudibranchs of Southern Africa p. 11 See also * Symposia and workshops on opisthobranchs *Taxonomy of the Gastropoda (Bouchet & Rocroi, 2005) *Changes in the taxonomy of gastropods since 2005 References This article incorporates CC-BY-2.0 text from reference  Further reading  * Bieler R.

The left sample is untreated; the right, treated. Photo taken in a lab operated by the United States Department of Agriculture. An air ioniser (or negative ion generator or Chizhevsky's chandelier) is a device that uses high voltage to ionise (electrically charge) air molecules. Negative ions, or anions, are particles with one or more extra electrons, conferring a net negative charge to the particle. Cations are positive ions missing one or more electrons, resulting in a net positive charge. Some commercial air purifiers are designed to generate negative ions. Another type of air ioniser is the electrostatic discharge (ESD) ioniser (balanced ion generator) used to neutralise static charge. In 2002, in an obituary in The Independent newspaper, Cecil Alfred 'Coppy' Laws was credited with being the inventor of the domestic air ioniser. Air ionisers coupled with electrostatically positively charged collector plates have been used to eliminate the occurrence of airborne bacterial infections, lower airborne viral infections \\"Most importantly, we demonstrate that this technology can be used to prevent airborne-transmitted influenza virus infections.\\" and to reduce static electricity build-up in electronics. Ionic air purifiers Air ioniser and purifier with its dust collection plates removed Air ionisers are used in air purifiers to remove particles from air. Airborne particles become charged as they attract charged ions from the ioniser by electrostatic attraction. The particles in turn are then attracted to any nearby earthed (grounded) conductors, either deliberate plates within an air cleaner, or simply the nearest walls and ceilings. The frequency of nosocomial infections in British hospitals prompted the National Health Service (NHS) to research the effectiveness of anions for air purification, finding that repeated airborne acinetobacter infections in a ward were eliminated by the installation of a negative air ioniser‚Äîthe infection rate fell to zero, an unexpected result. Positive and negative ions produced by air conditioning systems have also been found by a manufacturer to inactivate viruses including influenza. A 2013 comprehensive review of 80 years of research into air ions and respiratory function outcomes found that there was no clear support for any beneficial role in respiratory function, nor evidence for significant detrimental effect. In conclusion, \\"exposure to negative or positive air ions does not appear to play an appreciable role in respiratory function.\\" A 2018 review found that negative air ions are highly effective in removing particulate matter from air. The SARS epidemic fuelled the desire for personal ionisers in East Asia, including Japan (where many products have been specialised to contain negative ion generators, including toothbrushes, refrigerators, air conditioners, air cleaners, and washing machines). There are no specific standards for these devices. There are two types of ionic air purifiers, the fanless and fan base ionizers. The fan base ionizer uses its fan to circulate air around the room rapidly, but it is noisier and consumes more energy, while the fanless types distribute air slowly, taking a longer time to purify air, but are noiseless and more energy efficient.  California regulation of ozone produced by air cleaners and ionisers  The California Air Resources Board has a page listing air cleaners (many with ionisers) meeting their indoor ozone limit of 0.050 parts per million.California Certified Air Cleaning Devices. From California Air Resources Board. From that article: { class=wikitable All portable indoor air cleaning devices sold in California must be certified by the California Air Resources Board (CARB). To be certified, air cleaners must be tested for electrical safety and ozone emissions, and meet an ozone emission concentration limit of 0.050 parts per million. For more information about the regulation, visit the air cleaner regulation. } Ions versus ozone Ionisers are distinct from ozone generators, although both devices operate in a similar way. Ionisers use electrostatically charged plates to produce positively or negatively charged gas ions (for instance N2‚àí or O2‚àí) that particulate matter sticks to in an effect similar to static electricity. Even the best ionisers will also produce a small amount of ozone‚Äîtriatomic oxygen, O3‚Äîwhich is unwanted. Ozone generators are optimised to attract an extra oxygen ion to an O2 molecule, using either a corona discharge tube or UV light. At concentrations that do not exceed public health standards, ozone has been found to have little potential to remove indoor air contaminants. At high concentrations ozone can be toxic to air-borne bacteria, and may destroy or kill these sometimes infectious organisms. However, the required concentrations are sufficiently toxic to humans and animals that the US FDA declares that ozone has no place in medical treatment and has taken action against businesses that violate this regulation by offering therapeutic ozone generators or ozone therapy. Ozone is a highly toxic and extremely reactive gas. A higher daily average than 0.1 ppm (100 ppb, 0.2 mg/m3) is not recommended and can damage the lungs and olfactory bulb cells directly. Adverse health effects Studies have been carried out on negative ion generators. One study shows that the ozone generated can exceed guidelines in small, non ventilated areas. Another study showed that ozone can react with other constituents, namely cleaning agents to increase pollutants such as formaldehyde (this study had as its objective the testing of the use of cleaning products and air fresheners indoors and associated health risks as opposed to adverse health effects of air ionisers). Consumer Reports court case Consumer Reports, a non-profit U.S.-based product-testing magazine, reported in October 2003 that air ionisers do not perform to high enough standards compared to conventional HEPA filters. The exception was a combination unit that used a fan to move air while ionizing it. In response to this report, The Sharper Image, a manufacturer of air ionisers (among other products), sued Consumer's Union (the publishers of Consumer Reports) for product defamation. Consumer Reports gave the Ionic Breeze and other popular units a \\"fail\\" because they have a low Clean Air Delivery Rate (CADR). CADR measures the amount of filtered air circulated during a short period of time, and was originally designed to rate media-based air cleaners. The Sharper Image claimed that this test was a poor way to rate the Ionic Breeze, since it does not take into account other features, such as 24-hour-a-day continuous cleaning, ease of maintenance, and silent operation. The United States District Court for the Northern District of California dismissed the case, reasoning that The Sharper Image had failed to demonstrate that it could prove any of the statements made by Consumer Reports were false. The Court's final ruling in May 2005 ordered The Sharper Image to pay US$525,000 for Consumer Union's legal expenses. Electrostatic neutraliser in electronics Air ionisers are often used in places where work is done involving static- electricity-sensitive electronic components (like in microelectronics cleanrooms), to eliminate the build-up of static charges on non-conductors. As those elements are very sensitive to electricity, they cannot be grounded because the discharge will destroy them as well. Usually, the work is done over a special dissipative table mat, which allows a very slow discharge, and under the air gush of an ioniser.

Manning gained a high profile on British television during the 1970s, appearing on shows such as The Comedians and The Wheeltappers and Shunters Social Club. His act became controversial as attitudes changed, with the result that Manning was rarely seen on television in the last few decades of his career. However, he continued to perform at live venues until his death. Early life Manning was born in Harpurhey, Lancashire, and raised in Ancoats, both poor districts of Manchester, the second of three brothers and two sisters. He had Russian Jewish ancestry on his father's side, as well as roots in Ireland, and was brought up a \\"strict Catholic\\". He claimed, in an interview with The Daily Telegraphs Allison Pearson, that his paternal grandfather came from Sebastopol, and changed the family name from Blomberg. He named his house in Alkrington \\"Shalom\\", the Hebrew word for \\"peace\\". He left school aged 14, worked in a tobacco factory and joined his father's greengrocery business, before joining the British Army to do his National Service. Manning had little thought of entertainment as a career, until posted to Germany where, in his self written obituary has claimed to have guarded Nazi war criminals Rudolf Hess and Albert Speer in Spandau Prison, Berlin, just after the Second World War, he began to sing popular songs to entertain his fellow soldiers and pass the time. This ability led him to put on free shows at the weekends; when he began to charge admission and audiences did not decrease, he realised that there was a possibility of making money from show business. Career On returning to England Manning continued to sing professionally, and also worked as a comp√®re. He was an effective singer of popular ballads and fronted big bands in the 1950s, such as the Oscar Rabin Band, which included appearances at the Ritz Hotel. Over the years he began to introduce humour into his compering. This went down well, and Manning slowly moved from being a singer and comp√®re to a comedian. In 1959 Manning borrowed ¬£30,000 from his father and bought a dilapidated billiard hall on the A664 Rochdale Road, and turned it into the Embassy Club. Rather quickly Manning's income substantially increased. The club played host to many other acts, and Manning claimed that the Beatles performed there early in their career. After much work in comedy clubs and northern working men's clubs in the 1950s and 1960s, he made his television debut in 1971 on the Granada comedy show The Comedians. He comp√®red The Wheeltappers and Shunters Social Club, which began in 1974. In this period Manning's material was often accepted as being \\"harmless banter\\". By the 1980s Manning had fallen out of favour with television companies, either because of changing tastes or his failure to compromise with television companies. However his appearances on the northern Working Men's Club circuit continued, playing to packed audiences which he claimed sometimes included people from ethnic minorities. In 1994 two black waitresses at a charity dinner at a hotel in Derbyshire took exception to Manning's act and appealed to an industrial tribunal against the management of the hotel for racial discrimination. They lost, but later had the decision overturned at appeal; they were awarded an undisclosed sum. Manning felt that the word \\"wog\\" was \\"a horrible, insulting word I've never used in my life\\" but defended use of the words \\"nigger\\" and \\"coon\\" as historical terms with legitimate roots. Manning never toned down his act, but he had a minor television career revival towards the end of his life, including Channel 4 taking him to Mumbai to perform.Tasteless Bombay mix, Scotland on Sunday, 23 June 2003 In October 2002 he participated in a Great Lives programme for Radio 4. He chose to honour the Roman Catholic nun Mother Teresa. In 2003 Manning was initially reported to have been booked to play a BNP rally. He denied this, telling the Daily Mirror: \\"It's a lot of bollocks. I don't know where I'm working. Speak to my agent. I don't know about any BNP nonsense. I would not do it anyway. Do you think I'm fucking barmy?\\" In 2006 he appeared at the 45th birthday party of chef Marco Pierre White. From 1999 his son, Bernard Manning Jr, managed the club, shortly after his father had a mini stroke and became deaf in one ear. He considered his father's act inappropriate for bookings and sought to turn the club into an alternative comedy venue. Comedy style Race, sex, and religion were all part of the material for many of Manning's jokes. He considered tampons and disabled people unacceptable subjects, although he was challenged on Joan Rivers's show by guest Rupert Everett when he told a joke about a wheelchair user. Manning swiftly responded: \\"If your brains were dynamite, you wouldn't have enough to blow off your own hat.\\" This left Everett speechless.'Red Carpets and Other Banana Skins' Rupert Everett 2006 Manning's detractors criticised his style of humour, with television presenter Esther Rantzen commenting that \\"for me, he's always been the villain of comedy\\". Manning's family and friends said that his controversial ways were all an act. He lived next door to an Indian physician's family, who have appeared in many newspaper articles over the years to defend Manning as a \\"perfect gentleman\\". Satya Rudravajhala, the poet widow of Visveswara Rao Rudravajhala, wrote a eulogy that was published in the local paper, the Middleton Guardian, conveying the family's sentiments. In interviews with journalists, Manning would remind them of his appearance with Dean Martin in Las Vegas and meeting the Queen. He said he was a great believer in family values who never swore in front of his mother, stating: \\"I dragged myself up by my bootlaces. I don't drink or smoke, I don't take drugs. I have never been a womaniser. I was brought up right with good parents and I have never been in trouble or harmed no-one. And I love my family.\\" In March 2007, he was ranked 29th on the list of the 100 Greatest Stand Up comedians in a poll conducted by Channel 4. The writer and performer Barry Cryer said when Manning died: \\"The thing about Bernard was that he looked funny, he sounded funny and he had excellent timing. It was just what he actually said that could be worrying.\\" Personal life Manning's wife, Veronica Finneran, died of a heart attack on 11 November 1986, aged 57. His son Bernard Jr. had already moved out of the family home, so Manning moved back in with his mother. His brother John had died in 1944 at the Battle of Arnhem and in 1995, his elderly mother and two remaining brothers, Jackie and Frank, also died. Manning was a lifelong Manchester City supporter. He was the subject of This Is Your Life on 27 November 1991. For many of his later years, he was a teetotaler and a diabetic. Having been admitted two weeks earlier for a kidney complaint, Manning died in North Manchester General Hospital at 3:10 pm on 18 June 2007. He was 76. He wrote his own eulogy, which appeared as an obituary in the Daily Mail two days later. Legacy In 2010, BBC Four commissioned Alice Nutter to write a biographical drama based on Manning's life. The screenplay was completed but cuts to the channel's budget led to the piece never being filmed.Steve Bottoms, 'Struggling to be Human', in the programme for the 2013 West Yorkshire Playhouse production My Generation.

She lived in England, in the cities of Bristol and London; she also lived for a time in France and Germany. She enjoyed poetry from the age of seven and started working, first as a teacher and then as actress, from the age of fourteen. She wrote many plays, poems and novels. She was a celebrity, gossiped about in newspapers, famous for her acting and writing . During her lifetime she was known as \\"the English Sappho\\".Mary Robinson, Sappho and Phaon, About the BookJudith Pascoe, Romantic Theatricality, Cornell University Press, 1997, , p.13 She earned her nickname \\"Perdita\\" for her role as Perdita (heroine of Shakespeare's The Winter's Tale) in 1779. She was the first public mistress of King George IV while he was still Prince of Wales. Biography =Early life= Robinson was born in Bristol, England to Nicholas Darby, a naval captain, and his wife Hester (n√©e Vanacott) who had married at Donyatt, Somerset, in 1749, and was baptised 'Polle(y)' (\\"Spelt 'Polle' in the official register and 'Polly' in the Bishop's Transcript\\") at St Augustine's Church, Bristol, 19 July 1758, the entry noting that she was born 27 November 1756.Anthony Camp, Royal Mistresses and Bastards: Fact and Fiction: 1714-1936 (2007) 133-34. In her memoirs,Her daughter Mary Elizabeth, honoring her mother's request, published a draft of Robinson's memoirs in 1801 as Memoirs, with some Posthumous Pieces, Robinson gives her birth in 1758 but the year 1757 seems more likely according to recently published research (see appendix to Byrne, 2005). Her father deserted her mother and took on a mistress when Robinson was still a child. The family hoped for a reconciliation, but Captain Darby made it clear that this was not going to happen. Without the support of her husband, Hester Darby supported herself and the five children born of the marriage by starting a school for young girls in Little Chelsea, London, (where Robinson taught by her 14th birthday). However, during one of his brief returns to the family, Captain Darby had the school closedFeldman, p. 590 (which he was entitled to do by English law). Darby died in the Russian naval service in 1785. Robinson, who at one point attended a school run by the social reformer Hannah More, came to the attention of actor David Garrick. =Marriage= Hester Darby encouraged her daughter to accept the proposal of an articled clerk, Thomas Robinson, who claimed to have an inheritance. Mary was against this idea; however, after being stricken ill, and watching him take care of her and her younger brother, she felt that she owed him, and she did not want to disappoint her mother who was pushing for the engagement. After the early marriage, Robinson discovered that her husband did not have an inheritance. He continued to live an elaborate lifestyle, however, and had multiple affairs that he made no effort to hide. Subsequently, Mary supported their family. After her husband squandered their money, the couple fled to Talgarth, Breconshire (where Robinson's only daughter, Mary Elizabeth, was born in November). Here they lived in a fairly large estate, called Tregunter Park. Eventually her husband was imprisoned for debt in the Fleet Prison where she lived with him for many months. While it was common for the wives of prisoners to live with their husbands while indebted, children were usually sent to live with relatives to keep them away from the dangers of prison. However, Robinson was deeply devoted to her daughter Maria, and when her husband was imprisoned, Robinson brought the 6-month-old baby with her. It was in the Fleet Prison that Robinson's literary career really began, as she found that she could publish poetry to earn money, and to give her an escape from the harsh reality that had become her life. Her first book, Poems By Mrs. Robinson, was published in 1775 by C. Parker. Additionally, Darby was offered work in the form of copying legal documents so he could try to pay back some of his debts, but he refused to do anything. Robinson, in an effort to keep the family together and to get back to normal life outside of prison, took the job instead, collecting the pay that her husband neglected to earn. During this time, Mary Robinson found a patron in Georgiana Cavendish, Duchess of Devonshire, who sponsored the publication of Robinson's second volume of poems, Captivity. =Theatre= Caricature of the Prince of Wales as Florizel and Mary Robinson as Perdita, 1783 After her husband obtained his release from prison, Robinson decided to return to the theatre. She launched her acting career and took to the stage, playing Juliet, at Drury Lane Theatre in December 1776. Robinson was best known for her facility with the 'breeches parts', her performances as Viola in William Shakespeare'sTwelfth Night and Rosalind in As You Like It won her extensive praise. But she gained popularity with playing in Florizel and Perdita, an adaptation of Shakespeare, with the role of Perdita (heroine of The Winter's Tale) in 1779. It was during this performance that she attracted the notice of the young Prince of Wales, later King George IV of the United Kingdom. He offered her twenty thousand pounds to become his mistress. During this time, the very young Emma, Lady Hamilton sometimes worked as her maid and dresser at the theatre. With her new social prominence, Robinson became a trend-setter in London, introducing a loose, flowing muslin style of gown based upon Grecian statuary that became known as the Perdita. It took Robinson a considerable amount of time to decide to leave her husband for the Prince, as she did not want to be seen by the public as that type of woman. Throughout much of her life she struggled to live in the public eye and also to stay true to the values in which she believed. She eventually gave in to her desires to be with a man whom she thought would treat her better than Mr. Robinson. However, the Prince ended the affair in 1781, refusing to pay the promised sum.See Katharine Binhammer, 'Thinking Gender with Sexuality in 1790s Feminist Thought'. Feminist Studies28.3 (2002): 667‚Äì690. \\"Perdita\\" Robinson was left to support herself through an annuity promised by the Crown (but rarely paid), in return for some letters written by the Prince, and through her writings. After her affair with the young Prince of Wales she became famous for her rides in her extravagant carriages and her celebrity‚Äìlike perception by the public. = Later life and death = Lieutenant-Colonel Banastre Tarleton by Joshua Reynolds Mary Robinson, who now lived separately from her husband, went on to have several love affairs, most notably with Banastre Tarleton, a soldier who had recently distinguished himself fighting in the American War of Independence. Prior to their relationship beginning, Robinson had been having an affair with a man named Lord Malden. According to one account, Malden and Tarleton were betting men, and Malden was so confident in Robinson's loyalty to him, and believed that no man could ever take her from him. As such, he made a bet of a thousand guineas that none of the men in his circle could seduce her. Unfortunately for Malden, Tarleton accepted the bet and swooped in to not only seduce Robinson, but establish a relationship that would last the next 15 years. This relationship, though rumoured to have started on a bet, saw Tarleton's rise in military rank and his concomitant political successes, Mary's own various illnesses, financial vicissitudes and the efforts of Tarleton's own family to end the relationship. They had no children, although Robinson had a miscarriage. However, in the end, Tarleton married Susan Bertie, an heiress and an illegitimate daughter of the young 4th Duke of Ancaster, and niece of his sisters Lady Willoughby de Eresby and Lady Cholmondeley. In 1783, Robinson suffered a mysterious illness that left her partially paralysed. Biographer Paula Byrne speculates that a streptococcal infection resulting from a miscarriage led to a severe rheumatic fever that left her disabled for the rest of her life. From the late 1780s, Robinson became distinguished for her poetry and was called \\"the English Sappho\\". In addition to poems, she wrote eight novels, three plays, feminist treatises, and an autobiographical manuscript that was incomplete at the time of her death. Like her contemporary Mary Wollstonecraft, she championed the rights of women and was an ardent supporter of the French Revolution. She died in poverty at Englefield Cottage, Englefield Green, Surrey, 26 December 1800, aged 44, having survived several years of ill health, and was survived by her daughter, Maria Elizabeth (1774-1818), who was also a published novelist. Administration of her estate was granted to her husband Thomas Robinson from whom she had long been separated and who in 1803 inherited a substantial estate from his half-brother William.Anthony Camp, Royal Mistresses and Bastards: Fact and Fiction: 1714-1936 (2007) 134. One of Robinson's dying wishes was to see the rest of her works published. She tasked her daughter, Maria Robinson, with publishing most of these works. She also placed her Memoirs in the care of her daughter, insisting that she publish the work. Maria Robinson published Memoirs just a few months later. = Portraits = During her lifetime, Robinson also enjoyed the distinction of having her image captured by the most notable artists of the period. The earliest known, drawn by James Roberts II, depicts \\"Mrs. Robinson in the Character of Amanda\\" from Cibber's Love's Last Shift in 1777. In 1781, Thomas Gainsborough produced an oil sketch, Mrs. Mary Robinson 'Perdita', and an untitled study. That year, George Romney also painted Mrs. Mary Robinson and John Keyse Sherwin printed an untitled portrait. Joshua Reynolds sketched a study for what became Portrait of a Lady in 1782, and in 1784, he finished Mrs Robinson as Contemplation for which he also sketched a study. George Dance sketched a later portrait in 1793.  Literature  Mrs Robinson by Thomas Gainsborough, 1781 In 1792 Robinson published her most popular novel which was a Gothic novel titled, Vancenza; or The Dangers of Credulity. The books were \\"sold out by lunch time on the first day and five more editions quickly followed, making it one of the top-selling novels in the latter part of the eighteenth century.\\" It did not receive either critical or popular acclaim. In 1794 she wrote The Widow; or, A Picture of Modern Times which portrayed themes of manners in the fashionable world. Since Robinson was a fashion icon and very much involved in the fashion world the novel did not get a lot of favourable reception in 1794 as it might have now. In 1796 she wrote Angelina: A Novel. It cost more money than it brought in. Through this novel, she offers her thoughts on the afterlife of her literary career. After years of scholarly neglect, Robinson's literary afterlife continues apace. While most of the early literature written about Robinson focused on her sexuality, emphasising her affairs and fashions, she also spoke out about woman's place in the literary world, for which she began to receive the attention of feminists and literary scholars in the 1990s. Robinson recognised that, ‚Äùwomen writers were deeply ambivalent about the myths of authorship their male counterparts had created‚Äù and as a result she sought to elevate woman's place in the literary world by recognising women writers in her own work. In A Letter to the Women of England, Robinson includes an entire page dedicated to English women writers to support her notion that they were just as capable as men of being successful in the literary world. These ideas have continued to keep Mary Robinson relevant in literary discussions today. In addition to maintaining literary and cultural notability, she has re-attained a degree of celebrity in recent years when several biographies of her appeared, including one by Paula Byrne entitled Perdita: The Literary, Theatrical, and Scandalous Life of Mary Robinson that became a top-ten best- seller after being selected for the Richard & Judy Book Club. An eight-volume scholarly edition of Robinson's complete works was published in 2009‚Äì2010. In 2011, Daniel Robinson (no relation), editor of the poetry for the edition, published the first scholarly monograph to focus exclusively on her literary achievement--The Poetry of Mary Robinson: Form and Fame. A second monograph on Robinson's literary career, Mary Robinson and the Genesis of Romanticism: Literary Dialogues and Debts, 1784-1821, by Ashley Cross, appeared in 2016. Although, Robinson's novels were not as successful as she hoped, she had a talent for her poetry. Her ability to produce poetry can be seen furthermore in her poems titled \\"Sappho and Phaeon\\". Since the press had given her the name \\"The English Sappho\\", a clear relationship can be drawn between these poems and her literary name. The poems are love poems and many scholars have come to the conclusion that they represent her affairs with the Prince of Wales. Mary Darby Robinson was not only praised in literary circles for her poetry but also for her works written in prose. The two best known examples are \\"A Letter to the Women of England\\" (1798) and \\"The Natural Daughter\\" (1799). Both her works are dealing with the role of women during the Romantic Era. Mary Robinson as much as Mary Wollenstonecraft tried to put the focus on how inferior women were treated in comparison to men. The discrepancy can be seen in both of her works. \\"The Natural Daughter\\" can be seen as an autobiography of Mary Robinson. The characters are in many ways patterns of her own life and the stages of her life. All the characters are symbols of her own coming of age or people she met in her life. = Poetry = Perdita, portrait by Sir Joshua Reynolds, 1782. From the late 1780s, Robinson, striving to separate herself from her past scandals, and life as a theatre actress, turned to writing as a full-time career.Ty, Eleanor. ‚ÄúMary Robinson.‚Äù British Reform Writers, 1789-1832. Ed. Gary Kelly and Edd Applegate. Detroit: Gale Research, 1996. Dictionary of Literary Biography Vol. 158. Literature Resources from Gale. Web. 8 Oct. 2010 Robinson, disregarding her previous associations with the nickname ‚ÄúPerdita‚Äù, meaning ‚ÄúLost one‚Äù, soon became distinguished for her poetry and was reclassified as \\"the English Sappho\\" by the English public. During her 25-year writing career, from 1775 until her premature death in 1800, Robinson produced an immense body of work. In addition to eight collections of poems, Robinson wrote eight novels, three plays, feminist treatises, and an autobiographical manuscript that was incomplete at the time of her death. Poems by Mrs. Robinson, was published by C. Parker, in London, in 1775. \\"Poems\\" consisted of ‚Äútwenty-six ballads, odes, and elegies‚Äù that ‚Äúecho traditional values, praising values such as charity, sincerity, and innocence, particularly in a woman‚Äù.Ty, Eleanor. ‚ÄúMary Robinson.‚Äù British Reform Writers, 1789-1832. Ed. Gary Kelly and Edd Applegate. Detroit: Gale Research, 1996. Dictionary of Literary Biography Vol. 158. Literature Resources from Gale. Robinson's husband, Thomas Robinson was imprisoned at the King's Bench Prison for fifteen months for the gambling debts he acquired. Robinson originally intended for the profits made from this collection to help pay off his debts. But the publication of Poems could not prevent his imprisonment. Robinson lived for nine months and three weeks with Thomas and their baby within the squalor of prison. Motivated by the months she spent in prison, Robinson wrote Captivity; a Poem and Celadon and Lydia, a Tale, published by T. Becket, in London, in 1777. This collection ‚Äúdescribed the horrors of captivity and painted a sympathetic picture of the ‚Äòwretch‚Äô and the ‚Äòguiltless partners of his poignant woes‚Äô...The poem ends admonishing people to open their hearts and to pity the unfortunate...‚Äù Following the publication of Captivity, Robinson established a new poetic identity for herself. Robinson let go of her Della Cruscan style when she wrote Poems by Mary Robinson, published in 1791 by J. Bell in London, and Poems by Mrs. Robinson, published in 1793 by T. Spilsbury in London. A review was written by the Gentleman's Magazine and the reviewer stated that if Robinson had been less blessed with \\"beauty and captivating manners\\",\\"her poetical taste might have been confined in its influence\\". At the end of the review, \\"the Gentleman's Magazine describes her poetry as elegant and harmonious. In 1795, Robinson wrote a satirical poem titled London's Summer Morning, but it was published after her death in 1800. This poem showcased Robinson's critical perspective of the infrastructure and society of London. Robinson described the busy and loud sounds of the industrialised city in the morning. She employed characters such as the chimney-boy, and ruddy housemaid to make a heavy critique on the way English society treated children as both innocent and fragile creatures. In 1796, Robinson argued for women's rationality, their right to education and illustrated ideas of free will, suicide, rationalisation, empiricism and relationship to sensibility in Sappho and Phaon: In a Series of Legitimate Sonnets. George Romney, c. 1782 During the 1790s, Robinson was highly inspired by feminism and desired to spread her liberal sentiments through her writing.Robinson, Mary. A Letter to the Women of England and The Natural Daughter. Edited by Sharon M. Setzer, broadview literary texts, 2003 She was an ardent admirer of Mary Wollstonecraft, an established and influential feminist writer of the period. But to Robinson‚Äôs surprise, her intense feelings were not reciprocated by Wollstonecraft. While Robinson expected a strong friendship between the two of them to flourish, Wollstonecraft ‚Äúfound Robinson herself considerably less appealing than the title character of Angelina‚Äù. In 1796, Wollstonecraft wrote an extremely harsh review of Robinson's work in the Analytical Review. It was this critique that was not critical, or well thought out. Instead, Wollstonecraft's review of Robinson proved to be relatively shallow and pointed at her jealousy of Robinson's comparable freedom. Wollstonecraft had the potential to spend more of her own time writing, instead of having to entertain her husband, William Goodwin. Robinson's \\"Letter to the Women of England against Mental Subordination\\" is still powerful reading. Robinson reiterates the rights women have to live by sexual passion. Lastly, in 1800, after years of failing health and decline into financial ruin, Robinson wrote her last piece of literature during her lifetime: a series of poems titled the Lyrical Tales, published by Longman & Rees, in London. This poetry collection explored themes of domestic violence, misogyny, violence against destitute characters, and political oppression. ‚ÄúRobinson‚Äôs last work pleads for a recognition of the moral and rational worth of women: ‚ÄòLet me ask this plain and rational question-- is not woman a human being, gifted with all the feelings that inhabit the bosom of man?\\". Robinson's main objective was to respond to Lyrical Ballads written by authors Wordsworth and Coleridge; who were not as well known at the time. Although it was not as highly praised as May Wollstonecraft's \\"A Vindication of the Rights of Woman\\", published in 1792, Lyrical Tales provides a ‚Äúpowerful critique of the division of duties and privileges between the sexes. It places Robinson firmly on the side of the ‚Äòfeminist‚Äô thinkers or ‚Äòmodern‚Äô philosophers of the 1790s, as one of the strong defenders of her sex\\".  Criticism and Reception  Robinson was known as a sexualised celebrity, but she was a very talented writer. Robinson did not receive recognition for her work until much later because of \\"strict attitudes led to a rejection of the literary work of such a notorious woman.\\" She became a lesson to young girls about the dangers of promiscuity, and pleasure seeking. She was named by her friend Samuel Taylor Coleridge \\"as a woman of undoubted genius.\\" The collection of Poems published in 1791 had a \\"subscription list of 600 people was headed by His Royal Highness, George, Prince of Wales, and included many other members of the nobility. Some people subscribed because of her writing, some because of her notoriety, and some perhaps out of pity for the former actress, now crippled and ill. Reviews were generally kind, and noted traces in her poems of a sensibility that would later be termed Romanticism.\\" Twenty years after her death the Poetical Works of The Late Mrs. Robinson was published in 1824, which speaks to her ongoing popularity. Robinson's second novel The Widow, and in her controversial comedy Nobody: A Comedy in Two Acts both of which, according to newspaper reports, offended fashionable women. Needless to say, Robinson's playwright career was short-lived after all the bad reviews of her play. The upper class interpreted her satire as mockery on female gambling and it was an attack on moral legitimacy of the Whig elite. The upper class interpretation of Nobody reveals a great deal about the social and political anxieties during the revolutionary era. Robinson's poems were popular, especially after she produced a variety of poems, while working at the newspaper The Morning Post. The poetry columns had a double agenda of pleasing a substantial and diverse audience and shaping them into a select group of elite readers eager to buy and consume books. The public adored the novel Vancenza; or The Dangers of Credulity, but the critical reception was mixed. Furthermore, a biographer Paula Byrne recently dismissed it as a ‚Äúproduct of the vogue for Gothic fiction [that] now seems overblown to the point of absurdity.‚Äù Although, Robinson's poetry was more popular than her other works the most lucrative \\"was her prose. The money helped to support herself, her mother and daughter, and often Banastre Tarleton. Novels such as Vancenza (1792), The Widow (1794), Angelina (1796), and Walsingham (1797) went through multiple editions and were often translated into French and German. They owed part of their popularity to their suspected autobiographical elements. Even when her characters were placed in scenes of gothic horror, their views could be related to the experiences of their author.\\" Mary Robinson was one of the first female celebrities of the modern era. She was scandalous, but on the other hand educated and able to be partially independent from her husband. She was one of the first women to enter the sphere of writing, and to be successful there. Scholars often argue that she used her celebrity and fame status only in her own advantage, but it has to be noted how much she contributed to the awareness of early feminism. She tried to elaborate the ideas of equality for women in England during the late 18th century. Nevertheless, many contemporary women were not amused with how she exposed herself to the public and ostracised her. They did not want to be associated with her, since they feared to receive a bad reputation sympathising with Mary Robinson.

Early life Wark was born in Dumfries, Scotland, to Jimmy Wark, a solicitor, and Roberta Wark, a schoolteacher. Wark was educated at Kilmarnock Grammar Primary and subsequently Ayr's independent Wellington School. She studied history at the University of Edinburgh. Television and radio career Wark joined the BBC in 1976 as a graduate researcher for BBC Radio Scotland, before promotion a year later as producer of Good Morning Scotland and current affairs programmes. Wark switched to television in 1982, producing Reporting Scotland and the lunchtime political programme Agenda and current affairs series Current Account. She then moved into presenting, fronting Reporting Scotland, Seven Days, Left, Right and Centre and Scottish Questions coverage for BBC Scotland, before moving to network television as part of the Breakfast Time presenting team. In 1988, she was one of the first reporters to cover the Lockerbie disaster. In 1990, Wark demonstrated her distinctive line of questioning in an interview with Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. Wark was a presenter on BBC2 arts programme The Late Show (from 1990‚Äì3) and the heritage programme One Foot in the Past. In 1999, she presented The Kirsty Wark Show, her own interview programme. Wark has been a presenter on the BBC programme Newsnight since 1993. During the 1990s, she presented many programmes produced by her production company Wark Clements & Co, including Words With Wark, Restless Nation, Building A Nation and Lives Less Ordinary. In 2006, she presented a series of programmes on BBC television about countries on the continent entitled Tales from Old Europe. In June 2006 she interviewed Harold Pinter. Wark hosted the 10th annual Glenfiddich Spirit of Scotland Awards on 30 November 2007 for STV. She made a cameo appearance in the 2008 Doctor Who episode \\"The Poison Sky\\". She replaced David Baddiel as host of the BBC Four programme The Book Quiz in 2008 and hosts a BBC Two quiz show, A Question of Genius, which started in March 2009. In 2011 she was chosen to host a BBC food quiz show entitled A Question of Taste, pitting two teams of food fanatics against one another. Wark participated in the 2011 series of Celebrity MasterChef where she reached the final and narrowly lost out to Phil Vickery. On 1 January 2012, Wark appeared in a cameo role as herself in the revival of the BBC's Absolutely Fabulous. In January 2013 she appeared in a special series of The Great British Bake Off, where she was awarded Star Baker. Later that year, she made a cameo appearance in two episodes of The Politician's Husband which aired on BBC Two. In 2018, Margarita Simonyan, the Russia Today journalist who interviewed the two Russian suspects of the poisoning of Sergei and Yulia Skripal terminated an interview with Wark. It came after Work challenged \\"the manner of the interview\\" and asked if the interview didn't just reinforce the notion that RT was a 'propaganda tool of the Russian state.' Simonyan said Wark's questions seemed \\"like typical Western propaganda.\\" Since 2020, she has presented the BBC Radio 4 series \\"The Reunion\\". She has also, on occasion, presented \\"Start the Week\\" on BBC Radio 4. Honours and awards Wark was named journalist of the year by BAFTA Scotland in 1993 and Best Television Presenter in 1997. She was also nominated for the prestigious Richard Dimbleby Award for Best Television Presenter (Factual, Features and News) in the BAFTAS 2000. She was listed as one of the fifty best-dressed over 50s by The Guardian in March 2013. Wark was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh in March 2017. Public controversies Wark is regarded as being close to the Labour Party. Donald Dewar, Scottish Labour politician and former First Minister of Scotland, a close friend, appointed her to the Scottish Parliament Building Design Selection Panel, which chose Enric Miralles' design for the new parliament. Questioned by the Fraser Inquiry, set up to investigate the building's cost overruns, she said: \\"There was no way that we were making a decision on economically the most advantageous tender; you would have ended up with a shed . . . it was [about] getting a building which was the most exciting, innovative building . . .\\" In 2003, Wark-Clements produced a film on the building, with critics accusing Wark of a conflict of interest. In January 2005, she invited Labour MSP Jack McConnell, then Scotland's First Minister, and his family to stay at her Majorcan holiday home over the New Year period. McConnell, a long-time friend of Wark and husband Clements before holding office, was cleared of any improprieties when the Scottish Parliament's Standards Committee deemed he received no financial benefits from the holidays. Wark's editor on Newsnight offered his support, stating \\"Many people in the media have friends who have gone on to hold office. The important issue is your ability to ask tough questions and that is not a problem with Kirsty Wark or anybody else on the programme.\\" Wark and Clements were the subject of media coverage regarding his use of Wark's former PA to monitor emails covertly at RDF Media after he left following an acrimonious dispute about a non-compete deal. In June 2007, Wark clashed with Scottish First Minister Alex Salmond in an interview, over his response to a memorandum of understanding between the UK Government and Libya regarding prisoner exchanges. Salmond feared that this could include Abdelbaset al-Megrahi, who was convicted by a Scottish court in the Netherlands for the 1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie. The BBC received 120 formal complaints, andissued a public apology to Salmond regretting Wark's \\"rude and dismissive\\" tone; Salmond accepted the BBC's apology. According to the BBC, viewers questioned the premise of the interview and that Wark's line of questioning was too aggressive and therefore discourteous. According to Newsnight editor Peter Barron, time constraints forced Wark to end the questioning abruptly, leading him to perceive her behaviour as \\"rude and dismissive\\". In October 2013, Wark interviewed Guardian journalist Glenn Greenwald about his reporting of the NSA and GCHQ cyber-spying programs leaked by Edward Snowden. The interview was seen as openly hostile in which \\"Wark unabashedly made the case for the prosecution, interrogating Greenwald about his reporting and Edward Snowden.\\" Greenwald later wrote that Wark and other journalists have focused \\"almost entirely on the process questions surrounding the reporting rather than the substance of the revelations\\" about NSA surveillance and privacy invasions \\"and in the process made some quite dubious claims that come straight from the mouths of government officials\\". Wark attracted further controversy in relation to Alex Salmond in 2020. She presented a documentary on Salmond's trial where he stood accused of multiple sexual assault charges but was acquitted on all counts. The documentary aired several months after the end of the trial and featured both supporters and detractors of Alex Salmond reflecting on the case, including some of the women who accused Salmond speaking for the first time. The programme received over 900 complaints from those who believed it was biased against Salmond. However, the BBC noted that the outcome of the trial was 'fairly reflected in the programme', with the programme aiming to look at the wider political consequences of the case rather than rerunning Salmond's trial. The BBC also noted that Salmond had been asked to take part in the programme but had refused with the programme containing supporters of the former First Minister such as Jim Sillars and Kenny MacAskill. A later news story suggested that Salmond was considering taking legal action against the BBC, and in some reports, against Wark personally. Books Wark has written two novels, The Legacy Of Elizabeth Pringle and The House By The Loch. Personal life Wark married television producer Alan Clements (born 1961) in September 1989, after meeting on the BBC Scotland programme Left, Right, and Centre. They have a daughter (born 1990) and a son (born 1992). They founded independent TV production company Wark- Clements in 1990, which in May 2004 was merged with fellow Scots broadcaster Muriel Gray's Ideal World to form IWC Media. In December 2005, Wark and Gray severed their connections with IWC Media after RDF Media bought the company.

They have been held in the United Kingdom, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Malaysia, and Saudi Arabia. A royal commission is similar in function to a commission of inquiry (or, less commonly, enquiry) found in other countries such as Ireland, South Africa, and regions such as Hong Kong. It has considerable powers, generally greater even than those of a judge but restricted to the terms of reference of the commission. These powers include subpoenaing witnesses, taking evidence under oath and requesting documents. The commission is created by the head of state (the sovereign, or their representative in the form of a governor-general or governor) on the advice of the government and formally appointed by letters patent. In practice‚Äîunlike lesser forms of inquiry‚Äîonce a commission has started the government cannot stop it. Consequently, governments are usually very careful about framing the terms of reference and generally include in them a date by which the commission must finish. Royal commissions are called to look into matters of great importance and usually controversy. These can be matters such as government structure, the treatment of minorities, events of considerable public concern or economic questions. Many royal commissions last many years and, often, a different government is left to respond to the findings.  Notable royal commissions  = Australia = Royal commissions (sometimes called commissions of inquiry) have been held in Australia at a federal level since 1902. Royal commissions appointed by the Governor-General operate under the Royal Commissions Act 1902 passed by the Parliament of Australia in 1902. Royal Commissions are the highest form of inquiry on matters of public importance. A Royal Commission is formally established by the Governor-General on behalf of the Crown and on the advice of Government ministers. The government decides the terms of reference, provides the funding and appoints the commissioners, who are selected on the basis of their independence and qualifications. They are never serving politicians. Royal commissions are usually chaired by one or more notable figures. Because of their quasi- judicial powers the commissioners are often retired or serving judges. They usually involve research into an issue, consultations with experts both within and outside government and public consultations as well. The warrant may grant immense investigatory powers, including summoning witnesses under oath, offering of indemnities, seizing of documents and other evidence (sometimes including those normally protected, such as classified information), holding hearings in camera if necessary and‚Äîin a few cases‚Äîcompelling all government officials to aid in the execution of the Commission. The results of Royal Commissions are published in reports, often massive, of findings containing policy recommendations. (Due to the verbose nature of the titles of these formal documents ‚Äì for example, the Royal commission into whether there has been corrupt or criminal conduct by any Western Australian Police Officer ‚Äì they are commonly known by the name of the commission's chair.) While these reports are often quite influential, with the government enacting some or all recommendations into law, the work of some commissions have been almost completely ignored by the government. In other cases, where the commissioner has departed from the Warranted terms, the commission has been dissolved by a superior court.

Duties and functions Couriers are distinguished from ordinary mail services by features such as speed, security, tracking, signature, specialization and individualization of express services, and swift delivery times, which are optional for most everyday mail services. As a premium service, couriers are usually more expensive than standard mail services, and their use is normally limited to packages where one or more of these features are considered important enough to warrant the cost. Courier services operate on all scales, from within specific towns or cities, to regional, national and global services. Large courier companies include DHL, Postaplus, DTDC, FedEx, EMS International, TNT, UPS, India Post and Aramex. These offer services worldwide, typically via a hub and spoke model. Couriers services utilizing Courier Software provide electronic Proof of Delivery and electronic Tracking details. Before the industrial era A hikyaku (courier or postman), Japan, hand-coloured albumen print by Felice Beato, between 1863 and 1877 bike courier pursued by Cossacks (1904). On foot, military couriers are known as runners. In ancient history, messages were hand-delivered using a variety of methods, including runners, homing pigeons and riders on horseback. Before the introduction of mechanized courier services, foot messengers physically ran miles to their destinations. Xenophon attributed the first use of couriers to the Persian prince Cyrus the Younger. Famously, the Ancient Greek courier Pheidippides is said to have run 26 miles from Marathon to Athens to bring the news of the Greek victory over the Persians in 490 BCE. The long-distance race known as a marathon is named for this run. = Anabasii = Starting at the time of Augustus, the ancient Greeks and Romans made use of a class of horse and chariot-mounted couriers called anabasii to quickly bring messages and commands long distances. The word anabasii comes from the Greek Œ±ŒΩŒ±Œ≤Œ±œÉŒπœÇ (adscensus, \\"mounting\\"). They were contemporary with the Greek hemeredromi, who carried their messages by foot. In Roman Britain, Rufinus made use of anabasii, as documented in Saint Jerome's memoirs (adv. Ruffinum, l. 3. c. 1.): \\"Idcircone Cereales et Anabasii tui per diversas provincias cucurrerunt, ut laudes meas legerent?\\" (\\"Is it on that account that your Cereales and Anabasii circulated through many provinces, so that they might read my praises?\\") = Middle Ages = In the Middle Ages, royal courts maintained their own messengers who were paid little more than common labourers. Types In cities, there are often bicycle couriers or motorcycle couriers but for consignments requiring delivery over greater distance networks, this may often include Trucks, railroads and aircraft. Many companies who operate under a Just-In-Time or \\"JIT\\" inventory method often use on-board couriers (OBCs). On-board couriers are individuals who can travel at a moment's notice anywhere in the world, usually via commercial airlines. While this type of service is the second costliest‚Äîgeneral aviation charters are far more expensive‚Äîcompanies analyze the cost of service to engage an on-board courier versus the \\"cost\\" the company will realize should the product not arrive by a specified time (an assembly line stopping, untimely court filing, lost sales from product or components missing a delivery deadline, organ transplants). By country = Australia = The courier business in Australia is a very competitive industry and is mainly concentrated in the high population areas in and around the capital cities. With such a vast mass of land to cover the courier companies tend to transport either by air or by the main transport routes and national highways. The only large company that provides a country- wide service is Australia Post. = China = International courier services in China include TNT, EMS International, DHL, FedEx and UPS. These companies provide nominal worldwide service for both inbound and outbound shipments, connecting China to countries such as the US, Australia, United Kingdom, and New Zealand. Of the international courier services, the Dutch company TNT is considered to have the most capable local fluency and efficacy for third- and fourth- tiered cities. EMS International is a unit of China Post, and as such is not available for shipments originating outside of China. Domestic courier services include SF Express, YTO Express (ÂúÜÈÄö), E-EMS (EÈÇÆÂÆù) and many other operators of sometimes microscopic scales. E-EMS, is the special product of a co-operative arrangement between China Post and Alipay, which is the online payment unit of Alibaba Group. It is only available for the delivery of online purchases made using Alipay. Within the Municipality of Beijing, TongCheng KuaiDi (ÂêåÂüéÂø´ÈÄí), also a unit of China Post, provides intra-city service using cargo bicycles. = India = International courier services in India include DHL, FedEx, Blue Dart Express, Ekart, DTDC,VRL Courier Services, Delhivery, and Gati Ltd. Apart from these, several local couriers also operate across India. Almost all of these couriers can be tracked online. India Post is another major courier service with around 155 thousand branches (comprising 139 thousand (90%) in rural areas and 16 thousand (10%) in urban areas). = Ireland = The main courier services available in Ireland as alternatives to the national An Post system are Parcel Direct Ireland, SnapParcel (No longer in operation), DHL, UPS, TNT, DPD and FedEx. =Singapore= There are several international courier companies in Singapore including TNT, DHL and FedEx. Despite being a small country, demand is high for courier services. Many local courier companies have sprung up to meet this demand. Most courier companies in Singapore focus on local deliveries instead of international freight. = United Kingdom = The genus of the UK sameday courier market stems from the London Taxi companies but soon expanded into dedicated motorcycle despatch riders with the taxi companies setting up separate arms to their companies to cover the courier work. During the late 1970s small provincial and regional companies were popping up throughout the country. Today, there are many large companies offering next-day courier services, including DX Group, UKMail and UK divisions of worldwide couriers such as FedEx, DHL, Hermes Group, Global Express Courier, UPS and TNT City Sprint. There are many 'specialist' couriers usually for the transportation of items such as freight/pallets, sensitive documents and liquids. The 'Man & Van'/Freelance courier business model, is highly popular in the United Kingdom, with thousands upon thousands of independent couriers and localised companies, offering next-day and same day services. This is likely to be so popular because of the low business requirements (a vehicle) and the lucrative number of items sent within the UK every day. In fact, from 1988 to 2016, UK couriers were considered universally self employed, though the number of salaried couriers employed by firms has grown substantially since then. However, since the dawn of the electronic age the way in which businesses use couriers has changed dramatically. Prior to email and the ability to create PDFs, documents represented a significant proportion of the business. However, over the past five years, documentation revenues have decreased by 50 percent. Customers are also demanding more from their courier partners. Therefore, more organisations prefer to use the services of larger organisations who are able to provide more flexibility and levels of service, which has led to another level of courier company, regional couriers. This is usually a local company which has expanded to more than one office to cover an area. Some UK couriers offer next-day services to other European countries. FedEx offers next-day air delivery to many EU countries. Cheaper 'by-road' options are also available, varying from two days' delivery time (such as France), to up to a week (former USSR countries). Large couriers often require an account to be held (and this can include daily scheduled collections). Senders are therefore primarily in the commercial/industrial sector (and not the general public); some couriers such as DHL do however allow public sending (at higher cost than regular senders). In recent years, the increased popularity of Black Friday in the UK has placed some firms under operational stress. The process of booking a courier has changed, it is no longer a lengthy task of making numerous calls to different courier companies to request a quote. Booking a courier is predominantly carried out online. The courier industry has been quick to adapt to our ever-changing digital landscape, meeting the needs of mobile and desktop consumers as well as e-commerce and online retailers. Offering end users access to instant online payments, parcel tracking, delivery notifications, and the convenience of door to door collection and delivery to almost any destination in the world. =United States= The courier industry has long held an important place in United States commerce and has been involved in pivotal moments in the nation's history such as westward migration and the gold rush. Wells Fargo was founded in 1852 and rapidly became the preeminent package delivery company. The company specialised in shipping gold, packages and newspapers throughout the West, making a Wells Fargo office in every camp and settlement a necessity for commerce and connections to home. Shortly afterward, the Pony Express was established to move packages more quickly than the traditional stagecoach. It illustrated the demand for timely deliveries across the nation, a concept that continued to evolve with the railroads, automobiles and interstate highways and which has emerged into today's courier industry. The courier industry in United States is a $59 billion industry, with 90% of the business shared by DHL, FedEx, UPS and USA Couriers. On the other hand, regional and/or local courier and delivery services were highly diversified and tended to be smaller operations; the top 50 firms accounted for just a third of the sector's revenues. USPS is mail or packages delivered by the government and are the only ones who can legally ship to mailboxes. In a 2019 quarterly earnings call, the CEO of FedEx named Amazon as a direct competitor, cementing the e-commerce company's growth into the field of logistics.

An outlaw, gaucho and folk-hero, he is considered one of the most renowned Argentinian rural bandits. Early life Moreira was born in the administrative area of La Matanza, in the Province of Buenos Aires, Argentina. The first thirty years of his life were relatively uneventful, working in rural areas until he could buy his own ranch, some cattle, and land for farming. One characteristic that set him apart from others was that he rarely drank. Moreira devoted his free time to perfecting his skill on the guitar, which attracted the attention of Vicenta, the daughter of a local rancher. She fell in love with Moreira and eventually married him, with the full consent of her father. Shortly after Moreira married Vicenta, his troubles began. The Deputy Mayor of the area, known as Don Francisco, had also fallen in love with La Vicenta, so as a form of vengeance he began charging Moreira fines for everything he could think of, real or imaginary. The first thing he did was charge Moreira 500 pesos for having his wedding celebration without proper authorization. About that time, Moreira had lent Mr. Sardetti, a grocery-store owner, the sum of 10,000 pesos to buy merchandise. Fed up with asking for his money back, Moreira went to the Deputy Mayor, without any documentation, as was the custom at that time between men of their word, and reported what had happened in hopes that the Deputy Mayor would insist that Sardetti pay him back. It is unclear if Sardetti and Don Francisco were conspiring against Moreira, but Sardetti denied the story, and Moreira was thrown in jail for 48 hours for a form of attempted robbery. Point of no return This situation made Moreira so angry that he swore that he would stab Sardetti for every single peso he had lost. Moreira fulfilled his oath when he killed Mr. Sardetti in a facon duel at Sardetti's grocery store. Returning home after a night of wandering, he found Don Francisco and four other soldiers waiting to arrest him. He resisted, and during the fight, Don Francisco and two soldiers were killed. Extremely able in knifefights, Moreira won them all, even against more than one person. He gained such fame for this that men looked for him and picked fights with him to gain the glory of defeating him, but he never lost. He avoided fights whenever he could, and only killed after repeated provocation and in self-defense. Eventually, he served as a bodyguard for powerful politicians who promised to clean Moreira's reputation, but they never did so. It is said that Moreira never took the saddle off his horse, just in case he had to make a quick escape. He spent much of this part of his life wandering through different towns and cities of the Province of Buenos Aires, Argentina, including Navarro, Las Heras, Lobos, Veinticinco de Mayo and the lands of the Indian Cacique Coliqueo. Death In April, 1874, Casimiro Villamayor, the justice of the peace in Lobos, was ordered by Mariano Acosta, governor of the Province of Buenos Aires, to send a posse led by Commander Bosch from the police department in Buenos Aires to arrest Moreira. They surrounded the grocery and saloon (pulper√≠a) named La Estrella where Moreira was holed up. Moreira fought like a wild animal against the police, and he was at the point of leaping over the wall which separated him from his horse when he was bayoneted in the left lung by one of the officers, Sergeant Chirino. Moreira managed to shoot at Chirino, who lost an eye, as well as to injure one other officer before he died. He was survived by his wife and a child, also named Juan. He was buried at the Lobos cemetery. Legacy Juan Moreira is one of the most important figures in the popular history of Argentina. His life was laden with the violence and injustice which typified the unfair treatment received by the gauchos, treatment which led to his death. His skull and some personal belongings can be seen at Juan Domingo Per√≥n Museum. His life inspired a very popular novel by romantic author Eduardo Guti√©rrez, which in turn inspired at least four biographical films entitled Juan Moreira.Argentine films based on works by Eduardo Guti√©rrez (in Spanish) The most important of these films, Juan Moreira was directed by Leonardo Favio in 1973, starring Rodolfo Beb√°n as the title character. The night of his death was fictionalized by Jorge Luis Borges in a short story, La noche de los dones.

It was the scene of attacks by the guerilla group, the Kosovo Liberation Army, in the late 1990s as they fought the Serb military forces, accused of committing atrocities against the Albanian population. After the end of the Kosovo War in June 1999, many of its population of around 2,000 Serbs fled attacks by Albanian militants, though some later returned. The population today is said to be around 850 people.

In the early stages of Trio Niskalaukaus, Rautiainen was commonly represented in the main media as \\"The Grim Teacher\\", because of his strong and rather gloomy lyrics and his occupation. However, in later years he concentrated solely on his musical career, resigning from his educational activities. Despite his earlier and solemn representation in Finnish media, he is actually a man with good sense of humour, and on stage he is characterized by his laid back nature. In December 2004, Timo Rautiainen & Trio Niskalaukaus announced that they would be going on break for an indefinite period.Timo Rautiainen & Trio Niskalaukaus biography (in Finnish) While the band was on hiatus, Rautiainen starred on the Finnish talk-show K-Rappu, which concentrated on culture.

Like other atelines, they are found in tropical forests of Central and South America, from southern Mexico to Brazil. The genus contains seven species, all of which are under threat; the black-headed spider monkey and brown spider monkey are critically endangered. They are also notable for their ability to be easily bred in captivity. Disproportionately long limbs and long prehensile tails make them one of the largest New World monkeys and give rise to their common name. Spider monkeys live in the upper layers of the rainforest, and forage in the high canopy, from . They primarily eat fruits, but will also occasionally consume leaves, flowers, and insects. Due to their large size, spider monkeys require large tracts of moist evergreen forests, and prefer undisturbed primary rainforest. They are social animals and live in bands of up to 35 individuals but will split up to forage during the day. Recent meta-analyses on primate cognition studies indicated spider monkeys are the most intelligent New World monkeys. They can produce a wide range of sounds and will \\"bark\\" when threatened; other vocalisations include a whinny similar to a horse and prolonged screams. They are an important food source due to their large size, so are widely hunted by local human populations; they are also threatened by habitat destruction due to logging and land clearing. Spider monkeys are susceptible to malaria and are used in laboratory studies of the disease. The population trend for spider monkeys is decreasing; the IUCN Red List lists one species as vulnerable, four species as endangered and two species as critically endangered. Evolutionary history Theories abound about the evolution of the atelines; one theory is they are most closely related to the woolly spider monkeys (Brachyteles), and most likely split from such woolly monkeys as (Lagothrix and Oreonax) in the South American lowland forest, to evolve their unique locomotory system. This theory is not supported by fossil evidence. Other theories include Brachyteles, Lagothrix and Ateles in an unresolved trichotomy, and two clades, one composed of Ateles and Lagothrix and the other of Alouatta and Brachyteles. More recent molecular evidence suggests the Atelinae split in the middle to late Miocene (13 Ma), separating spider monkeys from the woolly spider monkeys and the woolly monkeys. =Taxonomic classification= The genus name Ateles derives from the ancient greek word (), meaning \\"incomplete, imperfect\\", in reference to the reduced or non-existent thumbs of spider monkeys. The genus contains seven species, and seven subspecies. *Family Atelidae **Subfamily Alouattinae: howler monkeys **Subfamily Atelinae ***Genus Ateles: spider monkeys ****Red-faced spider monkey, Ateles paniscus ****White- fronted spider monkey, Ateles belzebuth ****Peruvian spider monkey, Ateles chamek ****Brown spider monkey, Ateles hybridus ****White-cheeked spider monkey, Ateles marginatus ****Black-headed spider monkey, Ateles fusciceps *****Brown-headed spider monkey, Ateles fusciceps fusciceps *****Colombian spider monkey, Ateles fusciceps rufiventris ****Geoffroy's spider monkey, Ateles geoffroyi *****Hooded spider monkey Ateles geoffroyi grisescens *****Yucatan spider monkey, Ateles geoffroyi yucatanensis *****Mexican spider monkey, Ateles geoffroyi vellerosus *****Nicaraguan spider monkey, Ateles geoffroyi geoffroyi *****Ornate spider monkey, Ateles geoffroyi ornatus ***Genus Brachyteles: muriquis (woolly spider monkeys) ***Genus Lagothrix: woolly monkeys ***Genus Oreonax: the yellow-tailed woolly monkey Anatomy and physiology Geoffroy's spider monkey Spider monkey skeleton on display at The Museum of Osteology, Oklahoma City, Oklahoma Spider monkeys are among the largest New World monkeys; black-headed spider monkeys, the largest spider monkey, have an average weight of for males and for females. Disproportionately long, spindly limbs inspired the spider monkey's common name. Their deftly prehensile tails, which may be up to long, have very flexible, hairless tips and skin grooves similar to fingerprints. This adaptation to their strictly arboreal lifestyle serves as a fifth hand. When the monkey walks, its arms practically drag on the ground. Unlike many monkeys, they do not use their arms for balance when walking, instead relying on their tails. The hands are long, narrow and hook-like, and have reduced or non-existent thumbs. The fingers are elongated and recurved. Their hair is coarse, ranging in color from ruddy gold to brown and black, or white in a rare number of specimens.news.nationalgeographic.com 2015-04-17 Watch Incredibly Rare White Monkeys Ghost Through a Forest The hands and feet are usually black. Heads are small with hairless faces. The nostrils are very far apart, which is a distinguishing feature of spider monkeys. Spider monkeys are highly agile, and they are said to be second only to the gibbons in this respect. They have been seen in the wild jumping from tree to tree. Female spider monkeys have a clitoris that is especially developed; it may be referred to as a pseudo-penis because it has an interior passage, or urethra, that makes it almost identical to the penis, and retains and distributes urine droplets as the female moves around. This urine is emptied at the bases of the clitoris, and collects in skin folds on either side of a groove on the perineal. Researchers and observers of spider monkeys of South America look for a scrotum to determine the animal sex because these female spider monkeys have pendulous and erectile clitorises long enough to be mistaken for a penis; researchers may also determine the animal's sex by identifying scent-marking glands that may be present on the clitoris. Behavior As is the case with all species of spider monkeys, the brown spider monkey is threatened by hunting and habitat loss. Spider monkeys form loose groups, typically with 15 to 25 individuals, but sometimes up to 30 or 40. During the day, groups break up into subgroups. The size of subgroups and the degree to which they avoid each other during the day depends on food competition and the risk of predation. The average subgroup size is between 2 and 8 but can sometimes be up to 17 animals. Also less common in primates, females rather than males disperse at puberty to join new groups. Males tend to stick together for their whole lives. Hence, males in a group are more likely to be related and have closer bonds than females. The strongest social bonds are formed between females and their young offspring. Spider monkey standing at the edge of a boat Spider monkeys communicate their intentions and observations using postures and stances, such as postures of sexual receptivity and of attack. When a spider monkey sees a human approaching, it barks loudly similar to a dog. When a monkey is approached, it climbs to the end of the branch it is on and shakes it vigorously to scare away the possible threat. It shakes the branches with its feet, hands, or a combination while hanging from its tail. It may also scratch its limbs or body with various parts of its hands and feet. Seated monkeys may sway and make noise. Males and occasionally adult females growl menacingly at the approach of a human. If the pursuer continues to advance, the monkeys often break off live or dead tree limbs weighing up to and drop them towards the intruder. They do not actually throw the branches, but twist to cause the branch to fall closer to the threat. The monkeys also defecate and urinate toward the intruder. Spider monkeys are diurnal and spend the night sleeping in carefully selected trees. Groups are thought to be directed by a lead female, which is responsible for planning an efficient feeding route each day. Grooming is not as important to social interaction, owing perhaps to a lack of thumbs. Spider monkeys have been observed avoiding the upper canopy of the trees for locomotion. One researcher speculated this was because the thin branches at the tops of trees do not support the monkeys as well.Allen, William (English cardinal). \\"On standby for the new ark: if spider monkeys are chosen to ride out the 'demographic winter,' here is what latter-day Noahs will have to know.\\" The Sciences 34.n5 (Sept-Oct 1994): 15(3).

This requires the monkeys to remember when and where fruit can be found. The slow development may also play a role: the monkeys may live from 20 to 27 years or more, and females give birth once every 17 to 45 months. Gummy, presumably the oldest living spider monkey in captivity, is presumed to have been born wild in 1962 and currently resides at Fort Rickey Childrens Discovery Zoo located in Rome, NY. Diet Geoffroy's spider monkey (Ateles geoffroyi) browsing, showing the exceptionally long limbs that give them their name. The diets of spider monkeys consist of about 70 to 85 percent of fruits and nuts. They can live for long periods on only one or two kinds of fruits and nuts. They eat the fruits of many big forest trees, and because they swallow fruits whole, the seeds are eventually excreted and fertilized by the feces. Studies show the diet of spider monkeys changes their reproductive, social, and physical behavioral patterns. Most feeding happens from dawn to 10 am. Afterward, the adults rest while the young play. Through the rest of the day, they may feed infrequently until around 10 pm. If food is scarce, they may eat insects, leaves, bird eggs, bark and honey. Spider monkeys have a unique way of getting food: a lead female is generally responsible for finding food sources. If she cannot find enough food for the group, it splits into smaller groups that forage separately. The traveling groups have four to nine animals. Each group is closely associated with its territory. If the group is big, it spreads out. Reproduction The female chooses a male from her group for mating. Both males and females use \\"anogenital sniffing\\" to check their mates for readiness for copulation. The gestation period ranges from 226 to 232 days. Each female bears only one offspring on average, every three to four years. Until six to ten months of age, infants rely completely on their mothers. Males are not involved in raising the offspring. A mother carries her infant around her belly for the first month after birth. After this, she carries it on her lower back. The infant wraps its tail around its mother's and tightly grabs her midsection. Mothers are very protective of their young and are generally attentive mothers. They have been seen grabbing their young and putting them on their backs for protection and to help them navigate from tree to tree. They help the more independent young to cross by pulling branches closer together. Mothers also groom their young. Male spider monkeys are one of the few primates who do not have a baculum. In Mesoamerican cultures Spider monkeys are found in many aspects of the Mesoamerican cultures. In the Aztec 260-day calendar, Spider Monkey (Nahua Ozomatli) serves as the name for the 11th day. In the corresponding Maya calendar, Howler Monkey (Batz) is substituted for Spider Monkey. In present-day Maya religious feasts, spider monkey impersonators serve as a kind of demonic clowns. In Classical Maya art, they are ubiquitous, often shown carrying cacao pods.

Only paperback editions were published until the \\"King Penguin\\" series debuted in 1939,Baines, Penguin by Design, 2005, p. 76; edited by Pevsner they were \\"designed to appeal to the general liking for keepsakes\\" (Susie Harries, Nikolaus Pevsner: The Life, p. 321), and modelled after the Insel-Verlag art books. and latterly the Pelican History of Art was undertaken: these were unsuitable as paperbacks because of the length and copious illustrations on art paper so cloth bindings were chosen instead. Anecdotally, Lane recounted how it was his experience with the poor quality of reading material on offer at Exeter train station that inspired him to create cheap, well designed quality books for the mass market.Morpurgo, 1979, p. 80. However the question of how publishers could reach a larger public had been the subject of a conference at Rippon Hall, Oxford in 1934 which Lane had attended. Though the publication of literature in paperback was then associated mainly with poor quality lurid fiction, the Penguin brand owed something to the short-lived Albatross imprint of British and American reprints that briefly traded in 1932.Baines, Penguin by Design, p. 13. Albatross itself owed some credit to the English-language books published by Tauchnitz of Leipzig since the early 1840s. See also Wood, Dignified Flippancy, pp. 1‚Äì6. for a history of the paperback before Penguin. Inexpensive paperbacks did not initially appear viable to Bodley Head, since the deliberately low price of 6d. made profitability seem unlikely. This helped Allen Lane purchase publication rights for some works more cheaply than he otherwise might have done since other publishers were convinced of the short term prospects of the business. In the face of resistance from the traditional book tradeLewis, Penguin Special, 2005, Ch. 5, para. 30. it was the purchase of 63,000 books by Woolworths Group that paid for the project outright, confirmed its worth and allowed Lane to establish Penguin as a separate business in 1936. By March 1936, ten months after the company's launch on 30 July 1935, one million Penguin books had been printed. This early flush of success brought expansion and the appointment of Eunice Frost, first as a secretary then as editor and ultimately as a director, who was to have a pivotal influence in shaping the company.Obituary: Eunice Frost, Independent, 18 August 1998, . It was Frost who in 1945 was entrusted with the reconstruction of Penguin Inc after the departure of its first managing director Ian Ballantine.Lewis, Penguin Special, 2005, Ch. 11, para. 12. Penguin Inc had been incorporated in 1939 in order to satisfy US copyright law, and had enjoyed some success under its vice president Kurt Enoch with such titles as What Plane Is That and The New Soldier Handbook despite being a late entrant into an already well established paperback market. From the outset, design was essential to the success of the Penguin brand. Avoiding the illustrated gaudiness of other paperback publishers, Penguin opted for the simple appearance of three horizontal bands, the upper and lower of which were colour-coded according to which series the title belonged to; this is sometimes referred to as the horizontal grid. In the central white panel, the author and title were printed in Gill Sans and in the upper band was a cartouche with the legend \\"Penguin Books\\". The initial design was created by the then 21-year-old office junior Edward Young, who also drew the first version of the Penguin logo. Series such as Penguin Specials and The Penguin Shakespeare had individual designs (by 1937 only S1 and B1-B18 had been published). The colour schemes included: orange and white for general fiction, green and white for crime fiction, cerise and white for travel and adventure, dark blue and white for biographies, yellow and white for miscellaneous, red and white for drama; and the rarer purple and white for essays and belles lettres and grey and white for world affairs. Lane actively resisted the introduction of cover images for several years. Some recent publications of literature from that time have duplicated the original look. From 1937 onwards, the headquarters of Penguin Books was at Harmondsworth, close to Heathrow Airport, and so it remained until the 1990s when a merge with Viking involved the head office moving to central London. War years Penguin's English edition of Yuri Krimov‚Äôs novel The Tanker ‚ÄúDerbent\\" The Second World War saw the company established as a national institution, and though it had no formal role, Penguin was integral to the war effort thanks in no small part to the publication of such bestselling manuals as Keeping Poultry and Rabbits on Scraps and Aircraft Recognition and supplying books for the services and British POWs. Penguin printed some 600 titles and started nineteen new series in the six years of the warLewis, Penguin Special, 2005, Ch.8, para 1. and a time of enormous increase in the demand for books,Lewis, Penguin Special, 2005, Ch. 8, para. 8, quotes Orwell writing: \\"One phenomenon of the war has been the enormous sale of Penguin books, Pelican books, and other cheap titles, most of which would have been regarded as impossibly highbrow a few years back.\\" consequently Penguin enjoyed a privileged place among its peers. Paper rationing was the besetting problem of publishers during wartime, with the fall of France cutting off supply of esparto grass, one of the constituents of the pulp Penguin used. As such when rationing was introduced in March 1940 a quota was allocated by the Ministry of Supply to each publisher as a percentage of the amount used by that firm between August 1938 and August 1939.Lewis, Penguin Special, 2005, Ch. 8, para. 5. This was particularly advantageous to Penguin who as a volume printer had enjoyed a very successful year that year. Further in a deal with the Canadian Government, Penguin had agreed to exclusively publish editions for their armed forces for which they were paid in tons of paper.Wood, A Sort of Dignified Flippancy, 1983, p. 23. By January 1942 the Book Production War Economy Agreement regulations came into force which determined rules on paper quality, type size and margins, consequently Penguin eliminated dust jackets, trimmed margins and replaced sewn bindings with metal staples. Aside from the noticeable deterioration in the appearance of paperbacks it became a practical impossibility to publish books of more than 256 pages resulting in some titles falling out of print for want of material.Lewis, Penguin Special, 2005, Ch. 8, para. 7 In addition to their paper allocation Penguin secured a deal in late 1941, through Bill William's connections with ABCA and CEMA, with the War Office to supply the troops with books through what would be known as the Forces Book Club. Penguin would receive 60 tons a month from Paper Supply in return for 10 titles a month in runs of 75,000 at 5d.Wood, Dignified Flippancy, 1983, p. 23. Previously every paperback carried the message \\"FOR THE FORCES Leave this book at a Post Office when you have read it, so that men and women in the Services may enjoy it too\\" at the bottom of the back cover inviting the reader to take advantage of the free transmission of books to the forces by the Post Office. However demand was exceeding supply on the home front leading Lane to seek a monopoly on army books made specifically for overseas distribution. This dominance over the paper supply put Penguin in an especially strong position after the war as rationing continued. Many of its competitors were forced to concede paperback reprint rights to Penguin for this reason as well as the popular prestige the company enjoyed. Post-war history In 1945, Penguin began what would become one of its most important branches, the Penguin Classics, with a translation of Homer's Odyssey by E. V. Rieu. Between 1947 and 1949, the German typographer Jan Tschichold redesigned 500 Penguin books, and left Penguin with a set of influential rules of design principles brought together as the Penguin Composition Rules, a four-page booklet of typographic instructions for editors and compositors. Tschichold's work included the woodcut illustrated covers of the classics series (also known as the medallion series), and with Hans Schmoller, his eventual successor at Penguin, the vertical grid covers that became the standard for Penguin fiction throughout the 1950s. By this time the paperback industry in the UK had begun to grow, and Penguin found itself in competition with then fledgeling Pan Books. Many other series were published such as the Buildings of England, the Pelican History of Art and Penguin Education. By 1960, a number of forces were to shape the direction of the company, the publication list and its graphic design. On 20 April 1961, Penguin became a publicly listed company on the London Stock Exchange; consequently, Allen Lane had a diminished role at the firm though he was to continue as Managing Director. New techniques such as phototypesetting and offset-litho printing were to replace hot metal and letterpress printing, dramatically reducing cost and permitting the printing of images and text on the same paper stock, thus paving the way for the introduction of photography and novel approaches to graphic design on paperback covers. In May 1960, Tony Godwin was appointed as editorial adviser, rapidly rising to Chief Editor from which position he sought to broaden the range of Penguin's list and keep up with new developments in graphic design. To this end, he hired Germano Facetti in January 1961, who was to decisively alter the appearance of the Penguin brand. Beginning with the crime series, Facetti canvassed the opinion of a number of designers including Romek Marber for a new look to the Penguin cover. It was Marber's suggestion of what came to be called the Marber grid along with the retention of traditional Penguin colour-coding that was to replace the previous three horizontal bars design and set the pattern for the design of the company's paperbacks for the next twenty years. Facetti rolled out the new treatment across the Penguin line starting with crime, the orange fiction series, then Pelicans, Penguin Modern Classics, Penguin Specials, and Penguin Classics, giving an overall visual unity to the company's list. A somewhat different approach was taken to the Peregrine, Penguin Poets, Penguin Modern Poets, and Penguin Plays series. There were over a hundred different series published in total. Just as Lane well judged the public's appetite for paperbacks in the 1930s, his decision to publish Lady Chatterley's Lover by D. H. Lawrence in 1960 boosted Penguin's notoriety. The novel was at the time unpublished in the United Kingdom and the predicted obscenity trial, R v Penguin Books Ltd, not only marked Penguin as a fearless publisher, it also helped drive the sale of at least 3.5 million copies. Penguin's victory in the case heralded the end to the censorship of books in the UK, although censorship of the written word was only finally defeated after the Inside Linda Lovelace trial of 1978. =Pearson takeover= By the end of the 1960s Penguin was in financial trouble, and several proposals were made for a new operating structure. These included ownership by a consortium of universities, or joint ownership by the Cambridge University Press and Oxford University Press, but none of them came to anything.Lewis, Penguin Special, 2005, Ch. 21. para. 42. Sir Allen Lane died on 7 July, and six weeks later, Penguin was acquired by Pearson PLC on 21 August 1970. A new emphasis on profitability emerged and, with the departure of Facetti in 1972, the defining era of Penguin book design came to an end. Later changes included the disappearance of 'Harmondsworth' as the place of publication: this was replaced by a London office address. From 1937 the headquarters of Penguin Books was at Harmondsworth west of London and so it remained until the 1990s when a merger with Viking involved the head office moving into London (27 Wrights Lane, W8 5TZ). In 1985, Penguin purchased British hardback publisher Michael Joseph and in 1986, Hamish Hamilton. Also in 1986, Penguin purchased American publisher New American Library (NAL) and its hard-cover affiliate E. P. Dutton. New American Library had originally been Penguin U.S.A and had been spun off in 1948 because of the high complexity of import and export regulations. Penguin repurchased it in order to extend its reach into the US market, and NAL saw the move as a way to gain a hold in international markets. Penguin published Deborah Lipstadt's book Denying the Holocaust, which accused David Irving of Holocaust denial. Irving sued Lipstadt and Penguin for libel in 1998 but lost in a much publicised court case. Other titles published by Penguin which gained media attention, and controversy, include Massacre by Sin√©, Spycatcher, which was suppressed in the UK by the government for a time, and The Satanic Verses, leading to its author Salman Rushdie having to go into hiding for some years after Ayatollah Khomeini of Iran issued a FatwƒÅ, an edict amounting to a sentence of death against him. In 2006, Penguin attempted to involve the public in collaboratively writing a novel on a wiki platform. They named this project A Million Penguins. On 7 March 2007, the Penguin Books UK blog announced that the project had come to an end. In 2014, the Penguin Hotline was created by Madeline McIntosh. An orange commemorative plaque was unveiled at Exeter train station in May 2017 to mark Lane's significant contribution to the publishing industry. Imprints and series =Penguin Classics= Penguin Classics editions The 80 Little Black Classics published in 2015 marking the 80th anniversary Penguin Books Consonant with Penguin's corporate mission to bring canonical literature to the mass market the company first ventured into publishing the classics in May 1938 with the issue of Penguin Illustrated Classics.Penguin by Design, p. 24. The savings from the author's rights on these royalty free titles were instead invested in commissioning woodcut engravings from Robert Gibbings and his circle emanating from the Central School of Arts and Crafts. The books were distinct from the rest of the Penguin marque in their use of a vertical grid (anticipating Tschichold's innovation of 1951) and albertus typeface. The series was not a financial success and the list ceased after just ten volumes the same year it began. Penguin returned to classics with the printing of E. V. Rieu's translation of Homer's Odyssey in 1946, which went on to sell three million copies.Bristol Penguin Archive, April 2009 Book of the Month University of Bristol. Penguin's commercial motivation was, as ever, populist; rendering the classics in an approachable modern English was therefore a difficult task whose execution did not always satisfy the critics.See Carne-Ross, Kenner and Gould in Arion 7, 3, 1968, quoted in Penguin in Print, p. 63 ff. Dr Rieu said of his work that \\"I have done my best to make Homer easy reading for those who are unfamiliar with the Greek world.\\"Penguin in Print, p. 63. He was joined in 1959 by Betty Radice who was first his assistant then, after his retirement in 1964, she assumed the role of joint editor with Robert Baldick. As the publisher's focus changed from the needs of the marketplace to those of the classroom the criticism became more acute, Thomas Gould wrote of the series \\"most of the philosophical volumes in the Penguin series are bad ‚Äì some very bad indeed. Since Plato and Aristotle are the most read philosophers in the world today, and since some of these Penguin translations are favourites among professional philosophers in several countries, this amounts to a minor crisis in the history of philosophy.\\"Penguin in Print, p. 64. The imprint publishes hundreds of classics from the Greeks and Romans to Victorian Literature to modern classics. For nearly twenty years, variously coloured borders to the front and back covers indicated the original language. The second period of design meant largely black covers with a colour illustration on the front. In 2002, Penguin announced it was redesigning its entire catalogue, merging the original Classics list (known in the trade as \\"Black Classics\\") with what had been the old Penguin Twentieth-Century Classics list, though the silver covers for the latter have so far been retained for most of the titles. Previously this line had been called 'Penguin Modern Classics' with a pale green livery. The redesign‚Äîfeaturing a colourful painting on the cover, with black background and orange lettering‚Äîwas well received. However, the quality of the paperbacks themselves seemed to decrease: the spines were more likely to fold and bend. The paperbacks are also printed on non-acid-free pulp paper, which, by some accounts, tends to yellow and brown within a couple of years. The text page design was also overhauled to follow a more closely prescribed template, allowing for faster copyediting and typesetting, but reducing the options for individual design variations suggested by a text's structure or historical context (for example, in the choice of text typeface). Prior to 2002, the text page typography of each book in the Classics series had been overseen by a team of in-house designers; this department was drastically reduced in 2003 as part of the production costs. The in-house text design department still exists, albeit much smaller than formerly. Recent design work includes the Penguin Little Black Classic series, designed by Claire Mason. =Pelican Books= Four Pelican book covers, showing the gradual shift in the design. From left ‚Äì 1937 (three bands), 1955 (grid), 1969 (illustrated), and 2007 (a \\"Penguin Celebrations\\" throwback edition) Lane expanded the business in 1937 with the publication of George Bernard Shaw's The Intelligent Woman's Guide to Socialism and Capitalism under the Pelican Books imprint, an imprint designed to educate the reading public rather than entertain. Recognising his own limitations Lane appointed V. K. Krishna Menon as the first commissioning editor of the series, supported by an advisory panel consisting of Peter Chalmers Mitchell, H. L. Bales and W. E. Williams. Several thousand Pelicans were published over the next half-century and brought high quality accounts of the current state of knowledge in many fields, often written by authors of specialised academic books.Two random examples: (a) Nicholson, Norman, ed. (1942), An Anthology of Religious Verse; designed for the times (Pelican Books; A96), Harmondsworth: Penguin Books; (b) Parkes, Colin Murray (1975), Bereavement: Studies of Grief in Adult Life, Harmondsworth: Penguin Books. The work had been published by Tavistock Publications in 1975; in 1986 a second edition appeared: . (The Pelican series, in decline for several years, was finally discontinued in 1984.) Aircraft Recognition (S82) by R. A. Saville- Sneath, was a bestseller. In 1940, the children's imprint Puffin Books began with a series of non-fiction picture books; the first work of children's fiction published under the imprint was Barbara Euphan Todd's Worzel Gummidge the following year. Another series that began in wartime was the Penguin Poets: the first volume was a selection of Tennyson's poems (D1) in 1941. Later examples are The Penguin Book of Modern American Verse (D22), 1954, and The Penguin Book of Restoration Verse (D108), 1968. J. M. Cohen's Comic and Curious Verse appeared in three volumes over a number of years. Pelican Books was relaunched as a digital imprint in 2014, with four books published simultaneously on 1 May: Economics: A User's Guide by Ha-Joon Chang, The Domesticated Brain by the psychologist Bruce Hood, Revolutionary Russia by Orlando Figes and Human Evolution by the anthropologist Robin Dunbar. =Penguin Education= Covers of two Penguin Education titles In 1965 Penguin entered the field of educational publishing, Allen Lane's aim being to carry the radical and populist spirit of Pelicans into the schoolbook market. His final major initiative, the division was established as a separate publishing operation from Harmondsworth, and based in West Drayton in Middlesex. During its nine-year life it had a major impact on school books, breaking new ground in their concept and design and strongly influencing other publishers‚Äô lists. Among the most successful and influential series were Voices and Junior Voices, Connexions, and the Penguin English Project. Alongside these and other series, the imprint continued another Penguin tradition by producing Education Specials, titles which focussed on often controversial topics within education and beyond. They included highly topical books such as The Hornsey Affair and Warwick University Ltd, reflecting the student unrest of the late 1960s and contributing to the intense national debate about the purpose of higher education. Other titles featured the radical and influential ideas about schooling propounded by writers and teachers from America and elsewhere. Penguin Education also published an extensive range of Readers and introductory texts for students in higher education, notably in subjects such as psychology, economics, management, sociology and science, while for teachers it provided a series of key texts such as Language, the Learner and the School and The Language of Primary School Children. Following Allen Lane's death in 1970 and the takeover the same year by Pearson Longman, the division discontinued publishing school books and was closed in March 1974. More than 80 teachers, educational journalists and academics signed a letter to the Times Educational Supplement regretting the closure of the influential imprintTimes Education Supplement 1 March 1974 =Penguin Specials= In November 1937, Penguin inaugurated a new series of short, polemical books under the rubric of Penguin Specials with the publication of Edgar Mowrer's Germany Puts the Clock Back. Their purpose was to offer in-depth analysis of current affairs that would counter the perceived bias of the newspapers in addition to being the company's response to the popularity of Gollancz's Left Book Club. Whereas the Left Book Club was avowedly pro-Soviet, Penguin and Lane expressed no political preference as their editorial policy, though the widespread belief was that the series was left-leaning since the editor was the communist John Lehmann and its authors were, with a few exceptions,Joad, Ourselves and Germany. men of the left. Speed of publication and delivery (a turnaround of weeks rather than months) were essential to the topicality and therefore success of the Specials, Genevieve Tabouis's anti-appeasement tract Blackmail or War sold over 200,000 copies for example. However even this immediacy did not prevent them being overtaken by events: Shiela Grant Duff's Europe and the Czechs only made it onto the bookstands on the day of the Munich agreement, but nevertheless went on to be a bestseller. Thirty-five Penguin Specials were published before the outbreak of war, including two novels Ha≈°ek's Good Soldier Schweik and Bottome's The Mortal Storm; they collectively made a significant contribution to the public debate of the time, with many of the more controversial titles being the subject of leading articles in the press. After a hiatus between 1945 and 1949, the Penguin Specials continued after the war under the editorship of first Tom Maschler, then after 1961 Tony Godwin. The first title in the revived series was William Gallacher's The Case for Communism. Godwin initiated the \\"What's Wrong with Britain\\" series of Specials in the run up to the 1964 election, which constituted a platform for the New Left's brand of cultural analysis that characterised the leftist political radicalism of the 1960s. Indeed, Penguin Books contributed to the funds that set up Richard Hoggart and Stuart Hall's Centre for Contemporary Cultural Studies at Birmingham University in 1964.B. J. Moore-Gilbert, John Seed, Cultural Revolution?: The Challenge of the Arts in the 1960s, p. 65. This brief period of revival for Penguin Specials in contributing to the national dialogue was not sustained after the departure of Godwin in 1967, and with the rise in television journalism the Specials series declined in significance through the 1970s and 1980s. The last Special was published in 1988 with Keith Thompson's Under Siege: Racism and Violence in Britain Today. In December 2011, Penguin launched nine titles as 'Penguin Shorts' which featured the iconic tri-band covers. These books were novellla and short length works of fiction and/or memoirs. In 2012 they became known as Penguin Specials following an agreement with The Economist in March of that year which focused on the kind of topical journalism that was a feature of the original Penguin Specials. Subsequent Penguin Specials released in 2012 and 2013 continued to include both fiction, including the publication of the works shortlisted for the Monash Undergraduate Prize 2012, and topical journalism. As well as collected columns of cultural critics. =Puffin= Noel Carrington, an editor at Country Life magazine, first approached Lane with the idea of publishing low-cost, illustrated non-fiction children's books in 1938. Inspired by the Editions P√®re Castor books drawn by Rojan and the technique of autolithography used in the poster art of the time, Carrington's suggestion for what was to become the Puffin Picture Book series was adopted by Penguin in 1940 when, as Lane saw it, evacuated city children would need books on farming and natural history to help adjust to the country.Baines, Puffin by Design, 2005, p. 13. The first four titles appeared in December 1940; War on Land, War at Sea, War in the Air and On the Farm, and a further nine the following year. Despite Lane's intention to publish twelve a year paper and staff shortages meant only thirteen were issued in the first two years of the series. The Picture Books' 120 titles resulted in 260 variants altogether, the last number 116 Paxton Chadwick's Life Histories, was issued hors s√©rie in 1996 by the Penguin Collector's Society. Inexpensive paperback children's fiction did not exist at the time Penguin sought to expand their list into this new market. To this end Eleanor Graham was appointed in 1941 as the first editor of the Puffin Story Books series,Baines, Puffin by Design, 2005, p. 64. a venture made particularly difficult due to the resistance of publishers and librarians in releasing the rights of their children's books. The first five titles, Worzel Gummidge, Cornish Adventure,The Cuckoo Clock, Garram the Hunter and Smokey were published in the three horizontal stripes company livery of the rest of the Penguin output, a practice abandoned after the ninth volume when full-bleed colour illustrated covers were introduced, a fact that heralded the much greater design freedom of the Puffin series over the rest of Penguin's books. Graham retired in 1961 and was replaced by Kaye Webb who presided over the department for 18 years in a period that saw greatly increased competition in the children's market as well as a greater sophistication in production and marketing. One innovation of Webb's was the creation of the Puffin Club in 1967 and its quarterly magazine Puffin Post, which at its height had 200,000 members. The Puffin authors' list added Arthur Ransome, Roald Dahl and Ursula K. Le Guin during Webb's editorship and saw the creation of the Peacock series of teenage fiction. Tony Lacey took over Webb's editorial chair in 1979 at the invitation of Penguin managing director Peter MayerBaines, Puffin by Design, 2010, p. 146. when Puffin was one of the few profitable divisions of the beleaguered company. In line with Mayer's policy of more aggressive commercialisation of the Penguin brand Lacey reduced the number of Puffin imprints, consolidated popular titles under the Puffin Classics rubric and inaugurated the successful interactive gamebook series Fighting Fantasy.Baines, Puffin by Design, 2010, p. 147. Complementary to the Puffin Club the Puffin School Book Club, addressed specifically to schools and organisations, grew significantly in this period helping to confirm Puffin market position such that by 1983 one in three Penguin books sold was a Puffin. =The Buildings of England= Nikolaus Pevsner first proposed a series of volumes amounting to a county by county survey of the monuments of England in ten or more books to both the Cambridge University Press and Routledge before the war, however for various reason his plan came to nothing.Harries, Pevsner, p. 238. It was only through his involvement with Penguin that he was in a position to make a similar suggestion to Allen Lane and be accepted. Pevsner described the project of the Buildings of England as an attempt to fill the gap in English publishing for those multi-volume survey of national art familiar on the continent. In particular Georg Dehio's Handbuch der deutschen Kunstdenkmaler, a topographical inventory of Germany's important historic buildings that was published in five volumes between 1905 and 1912.Harries, Pevsner, p. 382. Though Pevsner's ambition for the series was to educate and inform the general public on the subtleties of English architectural history, the immediate commercial imperative was competition with the Shell Guides edited by John Betjeman of which 13 had been published by 1939.Penguin published their own, unsuccessful, county motoring guides, edited by L. Russell Muirhead. With Lane's agreement in 1945 Pevsner began work personally touring the county that was to be the subject of observation aided by notes drawn up by researchers. The first volume, Cornwall, appeared in 1951, and went on to produce 46 architectural guidebooks between then and 1974 of which he wrote 32 alone and ten with assistance. As early as 1954 the series was in commercial difficulty and required sponsorship to continue, a grant from the Leverhulme Trust amongst other sourcesBaines, Penguin by Design, p. 73. secured its completion. The series continued after Pevsner's death in 1983, financed in part by the Pevsner Books Trust and published by Yale University Press. Pevsner's approach was of Kunstgeschichte quite distinct from the antiquarian interest of local and family history typical of English county histories. Consequently, there is little mention of monumental brasses, bells, tracery, the relationship of the building to the landscape.Harries, Pevsner, p. 392. Nor is there much discussion on building techniques, nor industrial architecture, nor on Art Deco buildings, omissions that his critics hold have led to those subjects undervaluation and neglect.Harries, Pevsner, p. 393. Nevertheless, Pevsner's synoptic study brought rigorous architectural history to an appreciative mass audience, and in particular he enlarged the perception of the Victorian achievement in architecture. =Magazine publishing= Wartime paper rationing, which had resulted in a generous allocation to Penguin, also forced the reduction in space for book reviews and advertising in the newspapers and was partly the cause of the folding of several literary journals, consequently left a gap in the magazine market that Lane hoped to fill. In January 1941 the first issue of Penguin New Writing appeared and instantly dominated the market with 80,000 copies sold compared to its closest rival, Cyril Connolly's Horizon, which mustered 3,500 sales in its first edition. Penguin New Writing's editor John Lehmann was instrumental in introducing the British public to such new writers as Lawrence Durrell, Saul Bellow and James Michie. Yet despite popular and critical success further rationing and, after 1945 declining sales, led monthly publication to become quarterly until the journal finally closed in autumn 1950 after 40 issues. Though New Writing was the most durable of Penguin's periodicals it wasn't the publisher's only foray into journalism with Russian Review, Penguin Hansard and Transatlantic begun during the war, and Penguin Film Review, Penguin Music Magazine, New Biology, Penguin Parade, Penguin Science Survey and Penguin Science News having brief runs after. =Popular Penguins= Penguin's Australian subsidiary released the Popular Penguins series late in 2008. The series has its own website. It was intended to include 50 titles, many of which duplicate those on the Penguin Celebrations list but this was reduced to 49 titles as one of the 50, Hegemony or Survival by Noam Chomsky, had to be withdrawn after its initial release as Penguin discovered they no longer held the rights to it. Popular Penguins are presented as a return to Lane's original ethos good books at affordable prices. They have been published with a cover price of A$9.95, less than half of the average price of a paperback novel in Australia at the time of release. Popular Penguins are presented in a more \\"authentic\\" interpretation of the Penguin Grid than that of the Celebrations series. They are correct size, when compared to an original 'grid-era' Penguin, and they use Eric Gill's typefaces in a more or less exact match for Jan Tschichold's \\"tidying\\" of Edward Young's original three panel cover design. The covers are also printed on a card stock that mirrors the look and feel of 1940s and 50s Penguin covers. On the other hand, all of the Popular Penguins series are in Penguin Orange, and not colour-coded in the manner of the original designs and the \\"Celebrations\\" titles. In July 2009, another 50 Popular Penguins were released onto the Australian and New Zealand markets. A further 10 titles written by New Zealand authors were released in March 2010. Another 75 titles were released in Australia in July 2010 to mark Penguin's 75th anniversary. =King Penguin Books= King Penguin Books was a series of pocket-sized monographs published by Penguin Books between 1939 and 1959. They were in imitation of the Insel- B√ºcherei series published in Germany by Insel Verlag from 1912 onwards, and were pioneer volumes for Penguins in that they were their first volumes with hard covers and their first with colour printing. The books originally combined a classic series of colour plates with an authoritative text. The first two volumes featured sixteen plates from John Gould's The Birds of Great Britain (1873) with historical introduction and commentary on each plate by Phyllis Barclay-Smith, and sixteen plates from Redout√©'s Roses (1817‚Äì24) with historical introduction and commentary by John Ramsbottom. The third volume began the alternative practice of colour plates from a variety of sources. Some of the volumes, such as Nikolaus Pevsner's Leaves of Southwell (1945) or Wilfrid Blunt's Tulipomania (1950) were pioneering works of scholarship. Others such as The Bayeux Tapestry by Eric Maclagan (1943), Ur : The First Phases by Leonard Woolley (1946) or Russian Icons (1947) by David Talbot Rice were distillations by experts of their own pioneering works. Some volumes by experts went into revised editions, such as A Book of English Clocks (1947 and 1950) by R. W. Symonds. Elizabeth Senior edited the series until 1941, after which Nikolaus Pevsner took over and remained editor until the end of the series. The series ran to 76 volumes.For more detailed information compare the German wikipedia-site King Penguin Books. The King Penguin imprint was briefly revived in 1981 for a series of contemporary works, chiefly fiction.Fifty Penguin Years (1985), Exhibition catalogue , p. 132 =Pelican History of Art= Allen Lane approached Nikolaus Pevsner in 1945 for a series of illustrated books that would match the success of the King Penguins. Pevsner recalled his response: \\"Allen said, 'You have done the King Penguins now and we are going on with them, but if you had your way, what else would you do?' I had my answer ready‚Äîand the answer was very formidable, because I outlined both The Pelican History of Art and The Buildings of England on the spot, each about 40 to 50 volumes. Allen said, 'Yes, we can do both,' and that was the end of the meeting.\\"Peter Draper, Reassessing Nikolaus Pevsner, 2004, p. 73. Pevsner's industry quickly bore fruit with the first contracts signed by 1946 for John Summerson's Architecture in Britain, Anthony Blunt's Art and Architecture in France, and Rudolf Wittkower's Italian art and architecture, the first title Painting in Britain, 1530‚Äì1790 by Ellis Waterhouse was issued in 1953. By 1955, Pevsner produced a prospectus for the series announcing the publication of four new volumes and a plan for the rest of the series totalling 47 titles. The ambition of the series exceeded previously published multi-volume histories of art such as Andr√© Michel's Histoire de l'art (17 vols., 1905‚Äì28), the Propyl√§en Kunstgeschichte (25 vols., 1923‚Äì35). Forty-one volumes were published by the time Pevsner retired from editing in 1977. His work was continued by Judy Nairn (his editorial assistant on the Buildings of England) and the medievalist Peter Lasko. Yale University Press acquired the series in 1992 when 45 titles had been completed; by 2004 they had published 21 volumes, mostly revisions of existing editions.Draper, Reassessing Nikolaus Pevsner, p. 75. New volumes continue to produced in the 2010s, and new editions of older ones.Yale UP current list, newest first For Penguin the series was a departure from their commercial mainstay of paperbacks as the histories of art were the first large format, illustrated hardback books they had produced.Though paperback issues were begun in 1966, designed by Gerald Cinamon \\"Penguin paperback cover designs\\". Despite their relatively high price they were a financial success, yet for Pevsner they were intended primarily as graduate level texts in what was, for the English speaking world, the newly emerging academic discipline of art history.Harries, Pevsner, p. 562. Nevertheless, the series was criticised from within the academy for its evident biases. Many of its authors were German √©migr√©s, consequently there was a methodological preference for the kunstwissenschaft practiced in Vienna and Berlin between the wars; a formalism that ignored the social context of art.The point of view maintained at the Courtauld, for example: \\"After the war many older art historians took the view that the primary tasks of art history had already been accomplished, and that the time had come for summaries. This was the platform from which Pevsner launched his Pelican History of Art project, but it was not how the situation was perceived at the Institute.\\" \\"A History of the Courtauld\\". Moreover, the weight given to some subjects seemed disproportionate to some critics, with seven of its 47 volumes dedicated to English art, a \\"tributary of the main European current\\" as the Burlington Magazine observed.Harries, Pevsner, p. 566; Burlington Magazine, October 1953. Though the 1955 plan was never fully executed‚Äîthe volumes on Greek painting and sculpture, quattrocento painting and cinquecento sculpture were not written‚Äîthe Pelican History remains one of the most comprehensive surveys of world art published.John Shearman was commissioned early on for quattrocento painting, but though he did a large amount of work, he found he could not keep up with the torrent of new research, and never delivered his manuscript. =Penguin on Wheels= Mobile bookstore launched by Penguin Books India in collaboration with Ms. Satabdi Mishra and Mr. Akshaya Rautaray.

Early in his musical career he focused on hard rock, with his band Blackjack once opening for heavy metal artist Ozzy Osbourne on tour. It was rumored that in 1983 Bolton auditioned for, but was denied, the lead vocalist position with Osbourne's former band, Black Sabbath. Bolton later stated this was untrue, saying \\"That rumor about me auditioning for Black Sabbath was only a rumor, I don't know how on earth it started.\\" After anglicizing his family name to Bolton, he gained his first major hit as a songwriter, co-writing \\"How Am I Supposed to Live Without You\\" for Laura Branigan, previously best known for singing the pop hit \\"Gloria\\". Narrowly missing the Top 10 on the US pop chart, Branigan took the song to number one on the Adult Contemporary chart for three weeks in 1983. The two sought to work with each other again, and their next collaboration was when Bolton co- wrote \\"I Found Someone\\" for Branigan in 1985. Her version was only a minor hit, but two years later, Cher resurrected the song, and with it her own singing career. Bolton co-wrote several other songs for both singers. Bolton recorded his own rendition of \\"How Am I Supposed to Live Without You\\" in 1988, which reached number one on the Hot 100. Bolton at the 1990 Grammy Awards Bolton achieved his greatest success in the late 1980s and early 1990s as a singer on the adult contemporary/easy listening charts. One of his first major hits was his 1987 interpretation of the Otis Redding classic \\"(Sittin' On) the Dock of the Bay\\". Redding's widow, Zelma Redding, said she was so moved by Bolton's performance \\"that it brought tears to my eyes. It reminded me so much of my husband that I know if he heard it, he would feel the same.\\" Always interested in soul and Motown classics, Bolton's success with that song encouraged him to tackle the standard \\"Georgia on My Mind\\", with which he had another hit. In 1991, Bolton released the album Time, Love & Tenderness which featured his Grammy Award-winning cover version of \\"When a Man Loves a Woman\\". As a singer, he has performed with other artists such as: Lucia Aliberti, Patti LaBelle, Jos√© Carreras, Tony Cetinski, Ray Charles, Celine Dion, Pl√°cido Domingo, Ren√©e Fleming, Wynonna Judd, BB King, The Lonely Island, Luciano Pavarotti, Percy Sledge, and Zucchero. As a songwriter, he has written and collaborated on several songs for other artists as well. Bolton's last Top 40 single in the US in his own right was the 1997 hit \\"Go the Distance\\" (featured in the Disney animated motion picture Hercules), which peaked at No. 1 on the US adult contemporary chart. He hired conductor Larry Baird (orchestral musical director/conductor/arranger for The Moody Blues, Three Dog Night, Al Jarreau, etc.) for his 2001 tour. In 2006, Bolton and Nicollette Sheridan (his fianc√©e at the time) sang a duet, \\"The Second Time Around\\", for the album Bolton Swings Sinatra. In March 2007, Bolton toured South Africa for the first time. He was the headline act at Jacaranda 94.2 FM's two-day concert. For Over the Rainbow, an album which was recorded in five days, Bolton recorded the song \\"New York City\\", which was also on his Bolton Swings Sinatra album. This was for an episode of the TV series, Challenge Anneka. The proceeds from the album went to children's hospices across the UK. Bolton performed a duet entitled \\"Il Mio Amico\\" with the Italian singer Anna Tatangelo at the Sanremo Music Festival 2008. The song was originally sung by Tatangelo alone, but the duet version contained English lyrics as well. Bolton's album Only a Woman Like You was released in 2001. The title song was co-written by Shania Twain. Bolton released his album One World One Love in the UK on September 21, 2009. The first single, \\"Just One Love\\", was released one week earlier. Bolton in Barcelona, Spain, January 2010 In 2011, Bolton was featured as a guest vocalist in The Lonely Island's song \\"Jack Sparrow\\" on their Turtleneck & Chain album. His performance with the comedic hip-hop trio focused on his (intentionally) off-topic chorus and miscommunication with the group, and the video featured him dressed in costumes as Jack Sparrow from Pirates of the Caribbean, Forrest Gump, Erin Brockovich, and Tony Montana from Scarface. As of February 2015, Bolton was working on the recording of a new studio album. He has collaborated with Indian musician A. R. Rahman for a song which was recorded in February 2011 for Gems ‚Äì The Duets Collection. In 2013 Bolton released the album Ain't No Mountain High Enough: A Tribute to Hitsville U.S.A., which featured duets with Kelly Rowland, Melanie Fiona and Orianthi. In 2013 and 2014, Bolton appeared in Honda commercials in which he sings. In 2015 Bolton sang on John Oliver's Last Week Tonight episode concerning the IRS. In 2018, Bolton announced his intention to do a tour performance in Birmingham, England in November 2018, after two years since last time he visited the UK. =Acting= Bolton has made a number of cameo appearances in feature films and television, usually appearing as himself, such as in Meet Wally Sparks, Two and a Half Men, and The Nanny. Although he has been rumored to have appeared as an extra in Dune as a \\"spice-eyed\\" drummer, Bolton has stated in interviews that it is not him. In August 2006, Bolton was one of Lucy Lawless's duet partners on the Fox network's program Celebrity Duets, which Simon Cowell's Syco Productions Company produced for the network. Bolton was a contestant on the eleventh season of Dancing with the Stars. He and his dance partner Chelsie Hightower were the second couple to be eliminated, on September 28, 2010. In 2015, Bolton starred in a Pizza Hut commercial as himself singing Jingle Bells while the family opens up their pizza order. =Directing= On May 10, 2018, it was announced that American Dream: Detroit (Exclusive), Michael Bolton film, would premiere on Tuesday, May 15, 2018 in Redford Theater. Despite Bolton being born in Connecticut, he fell in love with the city of Detroit and wanted to highlight its recent economic comeback. This documentary features interviews with several famous Detroit natives to include business moguls, singers and luminaries, including Christopher Ilitch, Jerry Bruckheimer, Francis Ford Coppola, Aretha Franklin, Smokey Robinson, and Alice Cooper. This \\"Love-Letter to Detroit\\" film is reported by the Crain's (a local business publication) in an article titled \\"Michael Bolton to appear at Redford Theatre for Detroit documentary premiere\\", written by Annalise Frank. Copyright infringement lawsuit On February 24, 1992, the American R&B; group the Isley Brothers filed a lawsuit against Bolton, claiming his 1991 hit song \\"Love Is a Wonderful Thing\\" plagiarized their 1966 song of the same name. A Los Angeles jury ruled in favor of the Isley Brothers on April 25, 1994. The jury determined there were five instances in which Bolton's song plagiarized the Isleys' tune. Bolton, co-writer Andrew Goldmark and Sony Publishing were ordered to turn over more than $5 million in profits from the sales of Bolton's version of the song to the Isley Brothers. It was the largest award in history for plagiarism in the music industry. Bolton, Goldmark and Sony appealed the verdict, and the court fight continued for nearly seven more years. The case concluded on January 22, 2001, when the Supreme Court of the United States refused to hear the appeal of a May 2000 decision by the Ninth Circuit Court Of Appeals in San Francisco. Under the Ninth Circuit ruling, the Isleys were to be paid $4.2 million from Sony Music, $932,924 from Bolton, $220,785 from Goldmark, and the balance from Bolton and Goldmark's music publishing company.Three Boys Music v. Michael Bolton 212 F.3d 477 (9th Cir.2000) Mcir.usc.edu Personal life Bolton was married to Maureen McGuire from 1975 to 1990. They are the parents of three daughters, each born two years apart: Isa, Holly, and Taryn.Baker, K. C. Michael Bolton: Nicollette and I 'Remain Friends', People, September 23, 2008. He became a grandfather for the first time in October 2010, through his daughter Taryn. As of February 2019, he has six grandchildren, who range in age from 2 to 8. Bolton was introduced to actress Nicollette Sheridan in 1992 by adult contemporary/jazz saxophonist Kenny G.Michael Bolton : Celebrity : Biography, TV Guide.com. Bolton and Sheridan dated until 1995, stopped dating, then reunited in 2005 and became engaged in March 2006; however, it was confirmed in August 2008 that they had broken off their engagement. In January 2013, Bolton published an autobiography, The Soul of It All: My Music, My Life. Charity work = The Michael Bolton Foundation = In 1993, Bolton established The Michael Bolton Foundation, later renamed The Michael Bolton Charities, to assist women and children at risk from the effects of poverty as well as emotional, physical, and sexual abuse. In the late 1990s the group was heavily criticized for the incredibly low percentage of contributions that went towards charity work. In 1995 only 15% of the 2.6m USD the foundation raised went to charity with most of the funds paying for a concert headlined by Bolton himself. Bolton and the foundation have had a long running relationship with former Connecticut Governor John G. Rowland with Rowland steering state funding to the organization. In 1995 Bolton performed at a fundraiser for Rowland soon after the foundation received a grant of $300,000 from the state. In 2014 Michael Bolton wrote a letter to the Judge overseeing Rowland's sentencing in a campaign coverup trial in the name of the Foundation, stating \\"We, at The Michael Bolton Charities, believe John Rowland has much to contribute to our community and that given the opportunity, John will continue his work on behalf of women and children at risk.\\" The foundation accepts grant proposals by invitation only. = Other charity work = Bolton also serves as the honorary chairman of Prevent Child Abuse America, the national chairman for This Close for Cancer Research, and a board member for the National Mentoring Partnership and the Joe DiMaggio Children's Hospital. On July 25, 1993, Michael Bolton played against Michael Jordan in a televised charity softball game at the Chicago White Sox stadium, Comiskey Park. Michael Bolton's team, The Bolton Bombers, won the game 7‚Äì1 against Michael Jordan's team, Jordan's Air Force. The Bolton's Bombers were composed of Michael Bolton and his band while the Jordan's Air Force was composed of celebrities including Magic Johnson, Chris Chelios, Ahmad RashƒÅd, Mark Harmon, MC Hammer, Tom Selleck, Stacey King, and Bo Jackson as coach. In March 2003, Bolton joined with Lifetime Television, Verizon Wireless, and many others to lobby on behalf of the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence, urging legislation to provide more assistance for victims of domestic violence, such as affordable housing options. Bolton has received the Lewis Hine Award from the National Child Labor Committee, the Martin Luther King Award from the Congress of Racial Equality, and the Ellis Island Medal of Honor from the National Ethnic Coalition of Organizations. The Hollywood Chamber of Commerce also recognized Bolton with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for his musical and charitable contributions. Discography Since 1975, Bolton has released at least 17 studio albums and 35 singles. Nine of his singles have peaked at No. 1 on either the Billboard Hot 100 or the Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks charts in the US. He has also released numerous compilation albums and three Christmas albums. * Michael Bolotin (1975) * Everyday of My Life (1976) * Michael Bolton (1983) * Everybody's Crazy (1985) * The Hunger (1987) * Soul Provider (1989) * Time, Love & Tenderness (1991) * Timeless: The Classics (1992) * The One Thing (1993) * This Is the Time: The Christmas Album (1996) * All That Matters (1997) * My Secret Passion (1998) * Timeless: The Classics Vol. 2 (1999) * Only a Woman Like You (2002) * Vintage (2003) * 'Til the End of Forever (2005) * Bolton Swings Sinatra (2006) * One World One Love (2009) * Gems: The Duets Collection / Duette (2011) * Ain't No Mountain High Enough‚ÄìTribute to Hitsville (2013) * Songs of Cinema (2017) * A Symphony of Hits (2019) Awards and nominations Filmography =As actor= *1997: Meet Wally Sparks *2002: Snow Dogs (film also features four Michael Bolton songs) *2002: High Voltage *2008: The Onion Movie *2012/14: Two and a Half Men as himself (4 episodes) *2016: Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping *2017: Michael Bolton's Big, Sexy Valentine's Day Special *2017: Fresh Off the Boat as himself (3 episodes) *2018: Teen Titans Go! to the Movies as Tiger * 2018: Little Big Awesome as himself (1 episode) =As executive producer= *2001: Offside (short) *2001: Good Advice *2005: Terror at Home: Domestic Violence in America (TV) *2008: The Other Side of the Tracks *2018: American Dream: Detroit  See also  * List of best selling music artists * List of artists who reached number one on the Hot 100 (U.S.) References External links * * Michael Bolton Charities * Michael Bolton 2006 interview at I Like Music * Category:1953 births Category:American male singer-songwriters Category:American people of Russian-Jewish descent Category:American pop rock singers Category:American singer-songwriters Category:American soft rock musicians Category:American soul singers Category:American rock songwriters Category:Columbia Records artists Category:Concord Records artists Category:Grammy Award winners Category:Jewish singers Category:Jive Records artists Category:Living people Category:Musicians from New Haven, Connecticut Category:Participants in American reality television series Category:People involved in plagiarism controversies Category:20th-century American musicians Category:21st-century American composers Category:Jewish rock musicians Category:Songwriters from New York (state) Category:Songwriters from Connecticut Category:Ballad musicians ","title":"Michael Bolton"},{"id":"551976","text":"The Volkswagen Type 2, known officially (depending on body type) as the Transporter, Kombi or Microbus, or, informally, as the Bus (US) or Camper (UK), P√£o de Forma (Loaf of Bread) (Portugal) is a forward control light commercial vehicle introduced in 1950 by the German automaker Volkswagen as its second car model. Following ‚Äì and initially deriving from ‚Äì Volkswagen's first model, the Type 1 (Beetle), it was given the factory designation Type 2. As one of the forerunners of the modern cargo and passenger vans, the Type 2 gave rise to forward control competitors in the United States in the 1960s, including the Ford Econoline, the Dodge A100, and the Chevrolet Corvair 95 Corvan, the latter adapting the rear-engine configuration of the Corvair car in the same manner in which the VW Type 2 adapted the Type 1 layout. European competition included the 1947‚Äì1981 Citro√´n H Van, the 1959‚Äì1980 Renault Estafette (both FF layout), and the 1953‚Äì1965 FR layout Ford Transit. Japanese manufacturers also introduced similar vehicles, such as the Nissan Caravan, Toyota LiteAce and Subaru Sambar. Like the Beetle, the van has received numerous nicknames worldwide, including the \\"microbus\\", \\"minibus\\", and, because of its popularity during the counterculture movement of the 1960s, \\"Hippie van/bus\\" has become its most popular. Brazil contained the last factory in the world that produced the T2 series of Type 2, which ceased production on 31 December 2013, due to the introduction of more stringent safety regulations in the country. This (after the 2002 termination of its T3 successor in South Africa) marked the end of the era of rear-engine Volkswagens, which originated in 1935 with their Type 1 prototypes.  History  Plattenwagen The concept for the Type 2 is credited to Dutch Volkswagen importer Ben Pon. (It has similarities in concept to the 1920s Rumpler Tropfenwagen and 1930s Dymaxion car by Buckminster Fuller, neither of which reached production.) Pon visited Wolfsburg in 1946, intending to purchase Type 1s for import to the Netherlands, where he saw a Plattenwagen, an improvised parts-mover based on the Type 1 chassis, and realized something better was possible using the stock Type 1 pan.Walters, Jeff. \\"Type 2 Roots\\", in Hot VWs, 7/84, p.45. He first sketched the van in a doodle dated 23 April 1947,Walters, p.45. proposing a payload of and placing the driver at the very front.Walters, p.46. Production would have to wait, however, as the factory was at capacity producing the Type 1. When capacity freed up, a prototype known internally as the Type 29 was produced in a short three months. The stock Type 1 pan proved to be too weak so the prototype used a ladder chassis with unit body construction.Walters, p.46. Coincidentally the wheelbase was the same as the Type 1's. Engineers reused the reduction gear from the Type 82, enabling the 1.5 ton van to use a flat four engine. Although the aerodynamics of the first prototypes were poor (with an initial ), engineers used the wind tunnel at the Technical University of Braunschweig to optimize the design. Simple changes such as splitting the windshield and roofline into a \\"vee\\" helped the production Type 2 achieve , exceeding the Type 1's .Walters, p.47. Volkswagen's new chief executive officer Heinz Nordhoff (appointed 1 January 1948)Walter, p.46. approved the van for production on 19 May 1949 and the first production model, now designated Type 2, rolled off the assembly line to debut 12 November. Only two models were offered: the Kombi (with two side windows and middle and rear seats that were easily removable by one person), and the Commercial. The Microbus was added in May 1950, joined by the Deluxe Microbus in June 1951. In all 9,541 Type 2s were produced in their first year of production. An ambulance model was added in December 1951 which repositioned the fuel tank in front of the transaxle, put the spare tire behind the front seat, and added a \\"tailgate\\"-style rear door. These features became standard on the Type 2 from 1955 to 1967. 11,805 Type 2s were built in the 1951 model year.Walters, p.94. These were joined by a single-cab pickup in August 1952, and it changed the least of the Type 2s until all were heavily modified in 1968. 1959 Volkswagen Westfalia Camper at The Henry Ford Unlike other rear engine Volkswagens, which evolved constantly over time but never saw the introduction of all-new models, the Transporter not only evolved, but was completely revised periodically with variations retrospectively referred to as versions \\"T1\\" to \\"T5\\" (a nomenclature only invented after the introduction of the front-drive T4 which replaced the T3). However, only generations T1 to T3 can be seen as directly related to the Beetle (see below for details). The Type 2, along with the 1947 Citro√´n H Van, are among the first 'forward control' vans in which the driver was placed above the front roadwheels. They started a trend in Europe, where the 1952 GM Bedford CA, 1958 RAF-977, 1959 Renault Estafette, 1960 BMC Morris J4, and 1960 Commer FC also used the concept. In the United States, the Corvair-based Chevrolet Corvan cargo van and Greenbrier passenger van adopted the use of the rear-engine layout of the Corvair car in the same manner that the Type 2 had used the rear-engine layout of the Type 1, using the Corvair's horizontally opposed, 6 cylinder air-cooled engine for power. Except for the Greenbrier and various 1950s‚Äì70s Fiat minivans, the Type 2 remained unique in being rear-engined. This was a disadvantage for the early \\"barndoor\\" Panel Vans, which could not easily be loaded from the rear because the engine cover intruded on interior space, but generally advantageous in traction and interior noise. The Corvair pickup used a folding side panel that functioned as a ramp into the bed when opened, and was called the \\"Rampside\\". The VW \\"pickup\\" in both single and double cab versions had a bed/floor that was flat from front to back at the height of the engine compartment cover, which had the advantage of a flat load floor but at a greater height, while the Corvair \\"pickup\\" bed/floor stepped down in front of the engine compartment to a much lower load floor which worked well with the unique \\"Rampside\\" configuration for loading. Decades after production of the Type 2 ended, Volkswagen announced in 2017 that they would be bringing an electric VW microbus out based on the new MEB platform in 2022.  Variants  Rail-going draisine The Type 2 was available as a: * Panel van, a delivery van without side windows or rear seats. * Double-door Panel Van, a delivery van without side windows or rear seats and cargo doors on both sides. * High Roof Panel Van (), a delivery van with raised roof. * Kombi, from (combination motor vehicle), with side windows and removable rear seats, both a passenger and a cargo vehicle combined. * Bus, also called a Volkswagen Caravelle, a van with more comfortable interior reminiscent of passenger cars since the third generation. * Lota√ß√£o (share-taxi), a version exclusive to Brazil, with 6 front-hinged doors for the passenger area and 4 bench-seats, catering to the supplemental public transport segment. Available from 1960 to 1989, in both the split-window and \\"clipper\\" (fitted with the bay-window front panel) bodystyles. * Samba-Bus, a van with skylight windows and cloth sunroof, first generation only, also known as a Deluxe Microbus. They were marketed for touring the Alps. * Flatbed pickup truck, or Single Cab, also available with wider load bed. * Crew cab pick-up, a flatbed truck with extended cab and two rows of seats, also called a Doka, from . * Westfalia camping van, \\"Westy\\", with Westfalia roof and interior. Included optional \\"pop up\\" top. * Adventurewagen camping van, with high roof and camping units from Adventurewagen. * Semi-camping van that can also still be used as a passenger car and transporter, sacrificing some camping comforts. \\"Multivan\\" or \\"Weekender\\", available from the third generation on. Apart from these factory variants, there were a multitude of third-party conversions available, some of which were offered through Volkswagen dealers. They included, but were not limited to, refrigerated vans, hearses, ambulances, police vans, fire engines and ladder trucks, and camping van conversions by companies other than Westfalia. There were even 30 Klv 20 rail-going draisines built for Deutsche Bundesbahn in 1955. In South Africa, it is known as a well- loved variation of the ice cream van (first, second and third generations).  First generation (T1; 1950‚Äì1967)  Volkswagen T1 13 window \\"Kombi\\" microbus Volkswagen T1 Single-cab utility pickup The first generation of the Volkswagen Type 2 with the split windshield, informally called the Microbus, Splitscreen, or Splittie among modern fans, was produced from 8 March 1950 through the end of the 1967 model year. From 1950 to 1956, the T1 (not called that at the time) was built in Wolfsburg; from 1956, it was built at the completely new Transporter factory in Hanover. Like the Beetle, the first Transporters used the 1100 Volkswagen air-cooled engine, an , DIN-rated , air-cooled flat-four- cylinder 'boxer' engine mounted in the rear. This was upgraded to the 1200 ‚Äì an in 1953. A higher compression ratio became standard in 1955; while an unusual early version of the engine debuted exclusively on the Type 2 in 1959. Any 1959 models that retain that early engine today are true survivors. Since the engine was totally discontinued at the outset, no parts were ever made available. The early versions of the T1 until 1955 were often called the \\"Barndoor\\" (retrospectively called T1a since the 1990s), owing to the enormous rear engine cover, while the later versions with a slightly modified body (the roofline above the windshield is extended), smaller engine bay, and 15\\" roadwheels instead of the original 16\\" ones are nowadays called the T1b (again, only called this since the 1990s, based on VW's retrospective T1,2,3,4 etc. naming system.). From the 1964 model year, when the rear door was made wider (same as on the bay-window or T2), the vehicle could be referred to as the T1c. 1964 also saw the introduction of an optional sliding door for the passenger/cargo area instead of the outwardly hinged doors typical of cargo vans. In 1962, a heavy-duty Transporter was introduced as a factory option. It featured a cargo capacity of instead of the previous , smaller but wider 14\\" roadwheels, and a 1.5 L, DIN engine. This was so successful that only a year later, the 750 kg, 1.2 L Transporter was discontinued. The 1963 model year introduced the 1500 engine ‚Äì as standard equipment to the US market at DIN with an bore, stroke, and 7.8:1 compression ratio. When the Beetle received the 1.5 L engine for the 1967 model year, its power was increased to DIN. German production stopped after the 1967 model year; however, the T1 still was made in Brazil until 1975, when it was modified with a 1968‚Äì79 T2-style front end, and big 1972-vintage taillights into the so-called \\"T1.5\\" and produced until 1996. The Brazilian T1s were not identical to the last German models (the T1.5 was locally produced in Brazil using the 1950s and 1960s-era stamping dies to cut down on retooling, alongside the Beetle/Fusca, where the pre-1965 body style was retained), though they sported some characteristic features of the T1a, such as the cargo doors and five-stud Pitch Circle Diameter rims. Wheel tracks varied between German and Brazilian production and with 14-inch, 15-inch and 16-inch wheel variants but commonly front track varied from 1290 mm to 1310 mm and rear track from 1370 mm to 1390 mm. Among American enthusiasts, it is common to refer to the different models by the number of their windows. The basic Kombi or Bus is the 11-window (a.k.a. three-window bus because of three side windows) with a split windshield, two front cabin door windows, six rear side windows, and one rear window. The DeLuxe model featured eight rear side windows and two rear corner windows, making it the 15-window (not available in Europe). Meanwhile, the sunroof DeLuxe with its additional eight small skylight windows is, accordingly, the 23-window. From the 1964 model year, with its wider rear door, the rear corner windows were discontinued, making the latter two the 13-window and 21-window respectively. The 23- and later 21-window variants each carry the nickname \\"Samba\\" or in Australia, officially \\"Alpine\\". = Samba = A red Volkswagen Samba bus 23 windows A Volkswagen Transporter (T1) Samba model 21 window The Volkswagen Samba, in the United States also known as Sunroof Deluxe, was the most luxurious version of the T1. Volkswagen started producing Sambas in 1951. In the US Volkswagen vans were informally classified according to the number of windows they had. This particular model had 23 and later 21 windows including eight panoramic windows in the roof (the 23 window version had additional curved windows in the rear corners). To distinguish it from the normal Volkswagen van the name Samba was coined. Instead of a sliding door at the side the Samba had two pivot doors. In addition the Samba had a fabric sunroof. At that time Volkswagen advertised with the idea of using the Samba to make tourist trips through the Alps. Sambas were painted standard in two colors. Usually, the upper part was colored white. The two colored sections were separated by a decorative strip. Further the bus had a so-called \\"hat\\": at the front of the van the roof was just a little longer than the car itself to block the sun for the driver. The windows had chrome tables and the van had a more comprehensive dashboard than the normal T1. When Volkswagen started producing the successor of the T1 (the T2) the company also stopped producing the Samba so there are no Sambas in later versions of the Transporter. = US Chicken Tax = US sales of Volkswagen vans in pickup and commercial configurations were curtailed by the chicken tax Certain models of the Volkswagen Type 2 played a role in a historic episode during the early 1960s known as the Chicken War. France and West Germany had placed tariffs on imports of US chicken. Diplomacy failed, and in January 1964, two months after taking office, President Johnson imposed a 25% tax (almost ten times the average US tariff) on potato starch, dextrin, brandy, and light trucks. Officially, the tax targeted items imported from Europe as approximating the value of lost American chicken sales to Europe. In retrospect, audio tapes from the Johnson White House revealed a quid pro quo unrelated to chicken. In January 1964, President Johnson attempted to convince United Auto Workers' president Walter Reuther not to initiate a strike just before the 1964 election, and to support the president's civil rights platform. Reuther, in turn, wanted Johnson to respond to Volkswagen's increased shipments to the United States. The Chicken Tax directly curtailed importation of German-built Type 2s in configurations that qualified them as light trucks ‚Äì that is, commercial vans (panel vans) and pickups; vans imported in passenger configuration were not affected. In 1964, US imports of trucks from West Germany declined to a value of $5.7 million ‚Äì about one-third the value imported in the previous year. After 1971, Volkswagen cargo vans and pickup trucks, the intended targets, practically disappeared from the US market. While post-1971 Type 2 commercial vans and single-cab and double-cab pickups can be found in the United States today, they are exceedingly rare. Any post-1971 specimen found ostensibly has had its import tariff paid. The \\"Chicken tax\\" remains in effect today, even though it is now commonly curtailed by converting passenger vehicles to utility vehicles after they have entered the United States. This practice is ironically exercised by Ford and Chrysler, two of the companies the tax was meant to protect.  Second generation (T2; 1967‚Äì1979)  In late 1967, the second generation of the Volkswagen Type 2 (T2) was introduced. It was built in West Germany until 1979. In Mexico, the Volkswagen Kombi and Panel were produced from 1970 to 1994. Models before 1971 are often called the T2a (or \\"Early Bay\\"), while models after 1972 are called the T2b (or \\"Late Bay\\"). Volkswagen Transporter Pickup (The Netherlands) 1973‚Äì1980 Volkswagen Kombi (T2) van (Australia) This second-generation Type 2 lost its distinctive split front windshield, and was slightly larger and considerably heavier than its predecessor. Its common nicknames are Breadloaf and Bay-window, or Loaf and Bay for short.\\"Type II Volkswagen (thing)\\", section \\"Type 2/T2\\" (spells the term \\"Bread-Loaf\\") At 1.6 L and DIN, the engine was also slightly larger. The battery and electrical system was upgraded to 12 volts, making it incompatible with electric accessories from the previous generation. The new model also did away with the swing axle rear suspension and transfer boxes previously used to raise ride height. Instead, half-shaft axles fitted with constant velocity joints raised ride height without the wild changes in camber of the Beetle-based swing axle suspension. The updated Bus transaxle is usually sought after by off-road racers using air-cooled Volkswagen components. The T2b was introduced by way of gradual change over three years. The first models featured rounded bumpers incorporating a step for use when the door was open (replaced by indented bumpers without steps on later models), front doors that opened to 90¬∞ from the body, no lip on the front guards, unique engine hatches, and crescent air intakes in the D-pillars (later models after the Type 4 engine option was offered, have squared off intakes). The 1971 Type 2 featured a new, 1.6 L engine with dual intake ports on each cylinder head and was DIN-rated at . An important change came with the introduction of front disc brakes and new roadwheels with brake ventilation holes and flatter hubcaps. Up until 1972, front indicators are set low on the nose rather than high on either side of the fresh air grille ‚Äì giving rise to their being nicknamed \\"Low Lights\\". 1972's most prominent change was a bigger engine compartment to fit the larger 1.7- to 2.0-litre engines from the Volkswagen Type 4, and a redesigned rear end which eliminated the removable rear apron and introduced the larger late tail lights. The air inlets were also enlarged to accommodate the increased cooling air needs of the larger engines. In 1971 the 1600cc Type 1 engine as used in the Beetle, was supplemented with the 1700cc Type 4 engine ‚Äì as it was originally designed for the Type 4 (411 and 412) models. European vans kept the option of upright fan Type 1 1600 engine but the 1700 Type 4 became standard for US spec models. Pre-facelift (left) and facelifted (right) Volkswagen Kombi (T2) vans (Australia) In the Type 2, the Type 4 engine, or \\"pancake engine\\", was an option for the 1972 model year onward. This engine was standard in models destined for the US and Canada. Only with the Type 4 engine did an automatic transmission become available for the first time in the 1973 model year. Both engines were 1.7 L, DIN-rated at with the manual transmission and with the automatic. The Type 4 engine was enlarged to 1.8 L and DIN for the 1974 model year and again to 2.0 L and DIN for the 1976 model year. The two-litre option appeared in South African manufactured models during 1976, originally only in a comparably well-equipped \\"Executive\\" model. The 1978 2.0 L now featured hydraulic valve lifters, eliminating the need to periodically adjust the valve clearances as on earlier models. The 1975 and later US model years received Bosch L-Jetronic electronic fuel injection as standard equipment; 1978 was the first year for electronic ignition, utilizing a hall effect sensor and digital controller, eliminating maintenance-requiring contact-breaker points. As with all Transporter engines, the focus in development was not on power, but on low-end torque. The Type 4 engines were considerably more robust and durable than the Type 1 engines, particularly in Transporter service. In 1972, for the 1973 model year, exterior revisions included relocated front turn indicators, squared off and set higher in the valance, above the headlights. Also, square-profiled bumpers, which became standard until the end of the T2 in 1979, were introduced in 1973. Crash safety improved with this change because of a compressible structure behind the front bumper. This meant that the T2b was capable of meeting US safety standards for passenger cars of the time, though not required of vans. The \\"VW\\" emblem on the front valance became slightly smaller. Later model changes were primarily mechanical. By 1974, the T2 had gained its final shape. Very late in the T2's design life, during the late 1970s, the first prototypes of Type 2 vans with four-wheel drive (4WD) were built and tested.

Since 1991, the T2c has been built in M√©xico with the water-cooled 1.8 L inline four-cylinder carbureted engine‚Äîeasily identified by the large, black front-mounted radiator‚Äîand since 1995 with the 1.6 L air-cooled engines for the Brazilian market. Once production of the original Beetle ended in late 2003, the T2 was the only Volkswagen model with an air-cooled, rear-mounted boxer engine, but then the Brazilian model shifted to a water-cooled engine on 23 December 2005. There was a 1.6 L water-cooled diesel engine available from 1981 to 1985, which gave fuel economy of 15 km/l to 18 km/l‚Äîbut gave slow performance and its insufficient cooling system led to short engine life. The end of the Volkswagen air-cooled engine on a worldwide basis was marked by a Special Edition Kombi. An exclusive Silver paint job, and limited edition emblems were applied to only 200 units in late 2005, and were sold as 2006 models. An air- cooled and a water-cooled VW Kombi (T2), made in Brazil. Model years 2005 and 2006. Stricter emissions regulations introduced by the Brazilian government for 2006 forced a shift to a flexible-fuel water-cooled engine able to run on petrol or alcohol. Borrowed from the Volkswagen Gol, the engine is a rear- mounted EA-111 1.4 L 8v Total Flex , on petrol, and when run on ethanol, and torque. The production of the Brazilian Volkswagen Kombi ended in 2013 with a production run of 600 Last Edition vehicles. A short film entitled \\"Os √öltimos Desejos da Kombi\\" (English: The Kombi's Last Wishes) was made by Volkswagen Brazil to commemorate the end of production. Brazilian Air Force 2006 Kombi Total Flex is a flexible-fuel vehicle  Third generation (T3; 1979‚Äì1992)  VW Type 2 / T3 Transporter The Volkswagen Type 2 (T3), (and occasionally T25 within the UK, but technically incorrect) or Vanagon in the United States, the T3 platform was introduced in 1979, and was one of the last new Volkswagen platforms to use an air-cooled engine. The Volkswagen air-cooled engine was phased out for a water-cooled boxer engine (still rear-mounted) in 1983. Compared to its predecessor the T2, the T3 was larger and heavier, with square corners replacing the rounded edges of the older models. The T3 is sometimes called \\"the wedge\\" by enthusiasts to differentiate it from earlier Kombis.  Fourth generation (T4; 1990‚Äì2003)  Early 1990s Multivan Allstar T4 Since 1990, the Transporter in most world markets has been front-engined and water- cooled, similar to other contemporary Volkswagens, almost two decades later than it did for the passenger cars. T4s are marketed as Transporter in Europe. In the United States, Volkswagen Eurovan is the brand name.  Fifth generation (T5; 2003‚Äì2015)  2004 Volkswagen Multivan T5 The Volkswagen Transporter T5 range is the fifth generation of Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles medium-sized light commercial vehicle and people movers. Launched 6 January 2003, the T5 went into full production in April 2003, replacing the fourth generation range. Key markets for the T5 are Germany, the United Kingdom, Russia, France and Turkey. It is not sold in the US market because it is classed as a light truck, accruing the 25% chicken tax on importation. The T5 has a more aerodynamic design. The angle of the windshield and A-pillar is less; this makes for a large dashboard and small bonnet. In June 2009, Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles announced the one-millionth T5 rolled off the production line in Hanover. T5 GP introduced in 2010. Heavily facelifted with some new power plants including the 180 bi-turbo range topper. These new engines saw the demise of the now \\"dirty\\" 5 cylinder units. Late 2015 will see the arrival of the \\"Neu Sechs\\", the New 6. The T6 will offer further engine changes in early 2016, but will launch with the previous generation engines. The new engines will see the introduction of Ad-Blu to meet with euro 6 emission compliance. The new 6 was expected by many to be more than just a facelift. With the T6 now hitting the roads it is very clear it would appear to be just a facelift. New front, new tailgate and a new dash. There are quality improvements, sound deadening, new colours and improved consumption, but many believe VW have missed an opportunity to go back to the top  Sixth generation (T6; 2015‚Äìpresent)  right The new T6 launched with the old Euro 5 non-AdBlue power-plants, but is offered with a Euro 6 diesel engine with 204bhp and AdBlue. Three further Euro 6 Adblue diesel power-plants with 84ps, 102ps and 150ps are also offered. There is some debate in the community over whether the T6 is a new model, or simply a face-lift of the T5. There are obvious external changes to the nose and tailgate, while internally there is a new dash in 2 versions. Volkswagen claims refinement to ride, handling and noise levels.  Volkswagen Microbus Concept  Volkswagen Microbus Concept In 2001, a Volkswagen Microbus Concept was created, with design cues from the T1 generation in a spirit similar to the New Beetle nostalgia movement. Volkswagen planned to start selling it in the United States market in 2007, but it was scrapped in May 2004 and replaced with a more cost-effective design to be sold worldwide.  Names and nicknames  Like the Beetle, from the beginning, the Type 2 earned many nicknames from its fans. Among the most popular at least in Germany, are VW-Bus and Bulli (or Bully) or Hippie-van or the bus. The Type 2 was meant to be officially named the Bully, but Heinrich Lanz, producer of the Lanz Bulldog farm tractor, intervened. The model was then presented as the Volkswagen Transporter and Volkswagen Kleinbus, but the Bully nickname still caught on. The official German-language model names Transporter and Kombi (Kombinationskraftwagen, combined-use vehicle) have also caught on as nicknames. Kombi is not only the name of the passenger variant but also the Australasian and Brazilian term for the whole Type 2 family, in much the same way that they are all called VW-Bus in Germany, even the pickup truck variations. In Mexico, the German Kombi was translated as Combi and became a household word thanks to the vehicle's popularity in Mexico City's public transportation system. In Peru, where the term Combi was similarly adopted, the term Combi Asesina (Murderous Combi) is often used for buses of similar size, because of the notorious recklessness and competition of bus drivers in Lima to get passengers. In Portugal it is known as P√£o-de-Forma (Breadloaf) because its design resembles a bread baked in a mold. Similarly, in Denmark, the Type 2 is referred to as Rugbr√∏d (Rye bread). Finns dubbed it Kleinbus (mini-bus), as many taxicab companies adopted it for group transportation; the name Kleinbus has become an appellative for all passenger vans. The vehicle is also known as Kleinbus in Chile. In the US, however, it is a VW bus, minibus, hippie-mobile, hippie bus, hippie van, \\"combie\\", Microbus, or Transporter to aficionados. The early versions produced before 1967 used a split front windshield (giving rise to the nickname \\"Splitty\\"), and their comparative rarity has led to their becoming sought after by collectors and enthusiasts. The next version, sold in the US market from 1968 to 1979, is characterised by a large, curved windshield and is commonly called a \\"bay-window\\". It was replaced by the Vanagon, of which only the Westfalia camper version has a common nickname, \\"Westy\\". A popular nickname for the T3 was \\"2.6i\\" or \\"transi\\" in reference to the 2.6 liter Microbus/Caravelle sold South Africa and their robust design being a popular choice for transportation of children respectively . Kombi is also a generic nickname for vans and minibuses in South Africa, Swaziland, and Zimbabwe, often used as a means of public transportation. In Nigeria it is called Danfo. In the UK, it is known as a \\"Campervan\\". In France, it was called a \\"camping-car\\" (usually hyphenated) though this has been expanded to include other, often more specialized vehicles in more recent times. Among VW enthusiasts in countries of the former Yugoslavia, especially in Serbia and Croatia, VW T2 bus is commonly called a \\"Terrorist\\", probably due its cameo appearance in the Back to the Future film where it is driven by a group of Libyan terrorists.  Mexican production  A 1980 Volkswagen Combi in Mexico City T2 production began in 1970 at the Puebla assembly factory. Offered initially only as a nine-passenger version called the Volkswagen Combi (Kombi in Brazil), and from 1973 also its cargo van version called the Volkswagen Panel, both variants were fitted with the 1.5 L air-cooled boxer engine and four-speed manual gearbox. In 1974, the 1.6 L boxer engine replaced the 1.5 previous one, and production continued this way up to 1987. In 1987, the water-cooled 1.8 L inline four-cylinder engine replaced the air-cooled 1.6 L. This new model is recognisable by its black grille (for its engine coolant radiator), bumpers and moldings. In 1975, Volkswagen de M√©xico ordered two specially made pickups from Germany, one single cab and one double cab, for the Puebla plant. These were evaluated for the possibility of building pickups in Mexico, and were outfitted with every option except the Arctic package, including front and rear fog lights, intermittent wipers, trip odometer, clock, bumper rubber, PVC tilt, and dual doors on the single cab storage compartment. VW de Mexico was interested in having the lights, wiring, brake systems and other parts manufactured in Mexico. Ultimately, VW de Mexico declined to produce pickups, and the pickups were sold to an Autohaus, a Volkswagen dealer in San Antonio, Texas, since they could not be sold in Mexico. By law, no German-made Volkswagens were to be sold in Mexico. These were probably the only pickups that were produced in Germany for Mexican import, and have the \\"ME\\" export code on the M-code plate. The green double cab was sold to a new owner in New York, and has been lost track of. The light gray (L345, licht grau) single cab still exists. Pickups were not manufactured in Mexico, nor were they imported into Mexico from Germany, save for these two examples. In 1988, a luxury variant ‚Äì the Volkswagen Caravelle ‚Äì made its debut in the Mexican market to compete with the Nissan Ichi Van, which was available in cargo, passenger and luxury versions. The main differences between the two are that the Caravelle was sold as an eight-passenger version, while the Combi was available as a nine-passenger version, the Caravelle was only painted in metallic colors, while the Combi was only available in non-metallic colors, and the Caravelle was fitted with an AM/FM stereo cassette sound system, tinted windows, velour upholstery, reading lights, mid and rear headrests, and wheel covers from the European T3 model. In 1991, the higher roof made its debut in all variants, and the Combi began to be offered in eight- or nine-passenger variants. In 1991, since Mexican anti-pollution regulations required a three-way catalytic converter, a Digifant fuel injection system replaced the previous carburetor. The three variants continued without change until 1994. In 1994, production ended in Mexico, with models being imported from Brazil. The Caravelle was discontinued, and both the Combi and the Panel were only offered in white color and finally in 2002, replaced by the T4 EuroVan Pasajeros and EuroVan Carga, passenger and cargo van in long wheelbase version, inline five-cylinder 2.5 L 115 bhp and five-speed manual gearbox imported from Germany.  Hippie van  Colorful Volkswagen Type 2 The VW Type 2 became popular with the counterculture of the 1960s, thanks to its ability to transport a large group of people while being cheap and easy to maintain. Its design was simple yet spacious, thanks largely to the rear-mounted engine. The van became popular with young people because it allowed a group to travel comfortably and was big enough to live in, so it could be used for long-distance journeys, such as to music festivals or surfing locations. It contrasted starkly with the large, low sedans that were normal at the time, giving the van an alternative and rebellious image. Vans were often painted with extravagant designs in bright colors, making them stand out on the road even more. The \\"hippie van\\" remains iconic today, thanks to being featured of the cover of albums by musicians such as Bob Dylan and the Beach Boys, and being used by fans of the Grateful Dead while following the band on tour. But most iconic of all, the music festival Woodstock, which was held in the summer of 1969, saw plenty of brightly-painted vans transporting excited young crowds.

He has been called \\"the poet laureate of sports.\\" Iooss began his career shooting for Sports Illustrated and has contributed to the magazine for more than 50 years. He has also photographed for the magazine's Swimsuit Issue for four decades. He is represented by Stockland Martel. Birth and early life Born in Temple, Texas, Walter Iooss moved at the age of five from Temple to East Orange, New Jersey. In 1959, at the age of 16, he shot his first roll of film at a professional football game with a camera his father bought him. The following year he attended the German School of Photography in New York City during the summer. One year later, at the age of 17 years, Walter got his first assignment from Sports Illustrated‚Äî-the same year he graduated from East Orange High School. Two years later he shot his first cover for Sports Illustrated, but five more years would bring about a change of pace for Walter. Contrary to the sports images that he had been shooting, he then became an in-house photographer for Atlantic Records. In 2004 he was awarded with the LUCIE Lifetime Achievement Award for Sports Photography. Career 1968‚Äì From 1968 through 1972, Iooss was an in-house photographer for Atlantic Records in New York, where his subjects included performers like James Brown, Jimi Hendrix and Janis Joplin. In 1982, Iooss was recruited by Fujifilm to work on an extended study of athletes who were working their way to the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. The two-and-a-half-year project required him to leave his position on the staff of Sports Illustrated (though he continued to contribute) and resulted in the publication of the book Shooting for the Gold. In the late 1980s, Iooss was commissioned to photograph advertising campaigns for Camel cigarettes. In 1993, Iooss' work was featured on 27 baseball cards in an Upper Deck set dubbed \\"The Iooss Collection.\\" Though he has worked with athletes and models, Iooss has also photographed Cuban children playing ball in the streetChildren of Cuba, 1999 and captured the raw desire of Thai kickboxers.Kickboxers in Bangkok, Thailand, 1995 According to Iooss, \\"The real joy of photography is these moments.

The title is a reference to Alex Cox's movie Repo Man.The L-Space Web The Annotated Pratchett File v9.0 - Reaper Man Retrieved 2009-05-9 Plot The Auditors of Reality are beings who watch the Discworld to ensure everything obeys The Rules. As Death starts developing a personality the Auditors feel that he does not perform his Duty in the right way. They send him to live like everyone else. Assuming the name \\"Bill Door\\", he works as a farm hand for the elderly Miss Flitworth. She is a spinster whose fiance, Rufus, died on a last smuggling expedition many years ago. There are rumours that he'd had second thoughts about their marriage but she does not believe them. While every other species creates a new Death for themselves, humans need more time for their Death to be completed. As a result, the life force of dead humans starts to build up; this results in poltergeist activity, ghosts, and other paranormal phenomena. Most notable is the return of the recently deceased wizard Windle Poons, who was really looking forward to reincarnation. After several misadventures, including being accosted by his oldest friends, he finds himself attending the Fresh Start club, an undead-rights group led by Reg Shoe. The Fresh Start club and the wizards of Unseen University discover that the city of Ankh-Morpork is being invaded by a parasitic lifeform that feeds on cities and hatches from eggs that resemble snow globes. Tracking its middle form, shopping carts, the Fresh Start club and the wizards invade and destroy the third form, a shopping mall. When humankind finally thinks of a New Death, one with a crown and without any humanity or human face, it goes to take Bill Door. Death/Door, having planned for this moment for some time, outwits and destroys it. Having defeated the New Death, Death absorbs the other Deaths back into him, with the exception of the Death of Rats (and ultimately, the Death of Fleas). Death confronts Azrael, the Death of the Universe, and states that the Deaths have to care or they do not exist and there is nothing but Oblivion, which must also end some time. Death asks for and receives some time. He meets up with Miss Flitworth again and offers her unlimited dreams. She asks to go to the local Harvest Dance. They prepare and join the townspeople for a full night of dancing. As the sun is coming up, Miss Flitworth realizes she had died hours before the dance even started. Death escorts her through back history to her old fianc√©: as she had believed, he had died in an accident and not been unfaithful. The young couple enter the afterlife together. Returning to the city of Ankh Morpork, Death meets up with Windle Poons, finally taking him to his just reward, whatever it is. At the end there is also a discussion between Death and the Death of Rats over what the Death of Rats should \\"ride\\", Death suggests a dog while the Death of Rats suggests a cat.

Psychic surgery is a pseudoscientific medical fraud in which practitioners create the illusion of performing surgery with their bare hands and use sleight of hand, fake blood, and animal parts to convince the patient that diseased lesions have been removed and that the incision has spontaneously healed. The US Federal Trade Commission describes psychic surgery as a \\"total hoax\\". Psychic surgery may cause needless death by keeping the ill away from life-saving medical care. Medical professionals and skeptics classify it as sleight of hand and any positive results as a placebo effect.David Vernon in Skeptical - a Handbook of Pseudoscience and the Paranormal, ed Donald Laycock, David Vernon, Colin Groves, Simon Brown, Imagecraft, Canberra, 1989, , p47 Psychic surgery first appeared in the Spiritualist communities of the Philippines and Brazil in the middle of the 20th century; it has taken different paths in those two countries. Hines, Terence. (1988). Pseudoscience and the Paranormal: A Critical Examination of the Evidence. Prometheus Books. p. 245. Procedure Although psychic surgery varies by region and practitioner, it usually follows some common lines. Without the use of a surgical instrument, a practitioner will press the tips of his/her fingers against the patient's skin in the area to be treated. The practitioner's hands appear to penetrate into the patient's body painlessly and blood seems to flow. The practitioner will then show organic matter or foreign objects apparently removed from the patient's body, clean the area, and then end the procedure with the patient's skin showing no wounds or scars. Most cases do not involve actual surgery although some practitioners make real incisions. In regions of the world where belief in evil spirits is prevalent, practitioners will sometimes exhibit objects, such as glass, saying that the foreign bodies were placed in the patient's body by evil spirits. History Accounts of psychic surgery started to appear in the Spiritualist communities of the Philippines and Brazil in the mid-1900s.Drury, Nevill. (2002). The Dictionary of the Esoteric: Over 3000 Entries on the Mystical and Occult Traditions. Watkins Publishing. p. 259. The 16th-century explorer √Ålvar N√∫√±ez Cabeza de Vaca records an account, related to him by Native Americans, of a bearded figure known as \\"Mala Cosa\\" (Evil Thing), who would take hold of a person, cut into their abdomen with a flint knife, and remove a portion of their entrails, which he would then burn in a fire. When he was done the incision would close spontaneously.Narrative of the Narv√°ez Expedition (The Lakeside Press) pp. 107-108. =Philippines= In the Philippines, the procedure was first noticed in the 1940s, when performed routinely by Eleuterio Terte. Terte and his pupil Tony Agpaoa, who was apparently associated with the Union Espiritista Christiana de Filipinas (The Christian Spiritist Union of the Philippines), trained others in this procedure. In 1959, the procedure came to the attention of the U.S. public after the publication of Into the Strange Unknown by Ron Ormond and Ormond McGill. The authors called the practice \\"fourth dimensional surgery,\\" and wrote \\"[we] still don‚Äôt know what to think; but we have motion pictures to show it wasn‚Äôt the work of any normal magician, and could very well be just what the Filipinos said it was ‚Äî a miracle of God performed by a fourth dimensional surgeon.\\" In \\"...1973, a group of medical doctors, scientists, and parapsychologists visited the Philippine Islands to study a phenomenon that was causing increased furor amongst health professionals ... Filipino psychic surgeons, also known as spiritual/magnetic healers.\\" Alex Orbito, who became well known in the United States through his association with actress Shirley MacLaine was a practitioner of the procedure. On June 14, 2005, Orbito was arrested by Canadian authorities and indicted for fraud. On Jan 20, 2006, the charges were dropped as it then seemed unlikely that Orbito would be convicted. Psychic surgery made U.S. tabloid headlines in March 1984 when entertainer Andy Kaufman, diagnosed with large cell carcinoma (a rare lung cancer), traveled to the Philippines for a six-week course of psychic surgery. Practitioner Jun Labo claimed to have removed large cancerous tumors and Kaufman declared he believed this cancer had been removed.Gardner, Martin. (2000). From the Wandering Jew to William F. Buckley Jr: On Science, Literature, and Religion. Prometheus Books. pp. 32-33 Kaufman died from renal failure as consequence of a metastatic lung cancer, on May 16, 1984. =Brazil= The origins of the practice in Brazil are obscure; but by the late 1950s \\"spiritual healers\\" were practicing in the country. Many of them were associated with Spiritism, a major spiritualistic movement in Brazil and claimed to be performing their operations merely as channels for spirits of deceased medical doctors.Stemman, Roy. (1976). The Supernatural. Danbury Press. p. 118 A known Brazilian psychic healer who routinely practiced psychic surgery was Z√© Arig√≥, who claimed to be channeling for a deceased medical doctor of name Dr. Fritz. Unlike most other psychic healers, who work bare- handed, Arig√≥ used a non-surgical blade. Other psychic healers who claimed to channel for Dr. Fritz were Edson Queiroz and Rubens Farias Jr.. Popular today (especially abroad) is Jo√£o de Faria, also known as Jo√£o de Deus, a quack operating in Abadi√¢nia, state of Goi√°s. According to the descriptions of Yoshiaki Omura, Brazilian psychic surgery appears to be different from that practiced in the Philippines. Omura calls attention to the fact that practitioners in Brazil use techniques resembling Qigong, Shiatsu massage, and chiropractic manipulation. Some patients are also injected with a brown liquid, and alleged minor surgery was performed in about 20% of the cases observed. While Arig√≥ performed his procedures using kitchen knives in improvised settings, Omura reports that the clamping of blood vessels and the closing of the surgical wounds are now performed by licensed surgeons or licensed nurses. =North America= In the 1970s a specific form of surgery known as psychic dentistry emerged in America. Willard Fuller was the most well known proponent. It was alleged that Fuller could cause dental fillings to appear spontaneously, change silver into golden fillings, straighten crooked teeth or produce new teeth. However, magicians and skeptics have found these claims to be unsupported by solid evidence. One dentist examined some patients of Fuller. In one case miraculous gold fillings turned out to be tobacco stains. In another case a female patient who reported a miraculous new silver filling admitted she had forgotten that the filling was already there.Nickell, Joe. (1993). Looking for a Miracle: Weeping Icons, Relics, Stigmata, Visions & Healing Cures. Prometheus Books. pp. 141-142. Butler, Kurt. (1999). Lying for Fun and Profit: The Truth about the Media : Exposes the Corrupt Symbiosis Between Media Giants and the Health Fraud Industries. Health Wise Productions. pp. 100-101. Medical and legal criticism In 1975, the Federal Trade Commission declared that \\"'psychic surgery' \\"is nothing but a total hoax\\".\\" Judge Daniel H. Hanscom, when granting the FTC an injunction against travel agencies promoting psychic surgery tours, declared: \\"Psychic surgery is pure and unmitigated fakery. The 'surgical operations' of psychic surgeons ... with their bare hands are simply phony.\\"\\"F.T.C. Curbs Philippines Flights For Cures by 'Psychic Surgery'\\"; New York Times March 15, 1975, p. 11 (Judge Hanscom: \\"pure and unmitigated fakery... simply phony\\") In 1975 the FTC stated: > It has been found that \\"psychic surgery\\" is pure fakery. The body is not > opened, no \\"surgery\\" is performed with the bare hands or with anything else, > and nothing is removed from the body. The entire \\"operation\\" is an egregious > fraud perpetrated by sleight-of-hand and similar tricks and devices. In 1990, the American Cancer Society stated that it \\"found no evidence that \\"psychic surgery\\" results in objective benefit in the treatment of any medical condition,\\" and strongly urged individuals who are ill not to seek treatment by psychic surgery. The British Columbia Cancer Agency \\"strongly urges individuals who are ill not to seek treatment by psychic surgeon.\\" While not directly hazardous to the patient, the belief in the alleged benefits of psychic surgery may carry considerable risk for individuals with diagnosed medical conditions, as they may delay or forgo conventional medical help, sometimes with fatal consequences. Accusations of fraud The physician William Nolen investigated psychic surgery and his book Healing: A Doctor in Search of a Miracle (1974) uncovered many cases of fraud.Nolen, William. (1974). Healing: A Doctor in Search of a Miracle. New York: Random House. Tony Agpaoa a famous psychic surgeon was several times detected in trickery.Neher, Andrew. (2011). Paranormal and Transcendental Experience: A Psychological Examination. Dover Publications. p. 171. Stage magician James Randi says psychic surgery is a sleight of hand confidence trick. He has said that in personal observations of the procedure, and in movies showing the procedures, he can spot sleight-of-hand moves that are evident to experienced stage magicians, but might deceive a casual observer. Randi has replicated the appearance of psychic surgery himself through the use of sleight-of- hand.Randi, James. (1982). Flim-Flam! Psychics, ESP, Unicorns, and Other Delusions. Prometheus Books. James Randi Replicating Psychic Surgery Professional magician Milbourne Christopher also investigated psychic surgeons at work, and observed sleight of hand.Christopher, Milbourne. (1975). Mediums, Mystics & the Occult. Thomas Y. Crowell. On his A&E; show Mindfreak in the episode \\"Sucker,\\" illusionist Criss Angel performed \\"Psychic Surgery,\\" showing first-hand how it may be done (fake blood, plastic bags and chicken livers were used). Randi says the healer would slightly roll or pinch the skin over the area to be treated. When his flattened hand reaches under the roll of skin, it looks and feels as if the practitioner is actually entering into the patient's body. The healer would have prepared in advance small pellets or bags of animal entrails which would be palmed in his hand or hidden beneath the table within easy reach. This organic matter would simulate the \\"diseased\\" tissue that the healer would claim to be removing. If the healer wants to simulate bleeding, he might squeeze a bladder of animal blood or an impregnated sponge. If done properly, this procedure may deceive patients and observers. However, some \\"psychic surgery\\" procedures do not rely solely on the \\"sleight of hand\\" described, as at least one Brazilian \\"surgeon\\" also cuts his victims' skin with an unsterilized scalpel to heighten the illusion.Randi, James. (1995). Psychic surgery in An Encyclopedia of Claims, Frauds, and Hoaxes of the Occult and Supernatural. St. Martin's Press. John Taylor has written there is no real case for psychic surgery as the explanation of fraud is highly likely in all the operations.Taylor, John. (1980). Science and the Supernatural: An Investigation of Paranormal Phenomena Including Psychic Healing, Clairvoyance, Telepathy, and Precognition by a Distinguished Physicist and Mathematician. Temple Smith. pp. 31-36. The practitioners use sleight of hand techniques to produce blood or blood-like fluids, animal tissue or substitutes, and/or various foreign objects from folds of skin of the patient as part of a confidence trick for financial benefit. Science writer Terence Hines has written: > The \\"operation\\" starts as the hand appears to enter the patient‚Äôs belly. > This is accomplished by creating an impression in the belly by pushing down > and flexing the fingers slowly into a fist‚Äîthe fingers thus appear to be > moving into the belly, but are really simply hidden behind the hand. The > blood that further disguises the true movement of the fingers and adds drama > to the proceedings can come from two sources. One is a fake thumb, worn over > the real thumb and filled with a red liquid. Such a fake thumb is a common > magician‚Äôs implement. Blood can also be passed to the surgeon in red > balloons hidden in cotton the psychic surgeon is using, the cotton and its > hidden contents being passed to him by an \\"assistant.\\" The bits of ‚Äútumor‚Äù > can also be passed to the psychic surgeon this way, or hidden in the false > thumb... the \\"tumor\\" material turns out to be chicken intestines or similar > animal remains. The blood is either animal blood or red dye. Two \\"psychic surgeons\\" provided testimony in a Federal Trade Commission trial that, to their knowledge, the organic matter supposedly removed from the patients usually consists of animal tissue and clotted blood.

The policeman described himself going undercover to feign illness and pretended to desire psychic surgery, having the feeling of the practitioner using sleight of hand to supposedly dig into his tissue, as well as suspecting that the \\"cysts\\" and \\"tumors\\" being removed from his body were actually ready-made chicken parts. *\\"Milagro\\", a sixth season episode from The X-Files, features a killer accused of using psychic surgery on his victims, killing them in the process. *In the BBC TV series Full Circle with Michael Palin, Michael Palin witnesses two separate instances of psychic surgery in the Baguio district of the Philippines.

It is the second novel about the Ankh-Morpork City Watch on the Discworld. Lance-constable Angua von √úberwald, later in the series promoted to the rank of Sergeant, is introduced in this book. Lance-constable (in the course of the novel promoted to Acting- constable) Detritus is introduced as a new member of the watch as well, though he had already appeared in other Discworld novels, most notably in Moving Pictures. Also notable is the only appearance of Lance-constable Cuddy (also promoted to Acting-constable). Plot Edward d'Eath, an Assassin and son of a down-and-out noble family, becomes convinced that the restoration of the Ankh-Morpork monarchy will solve the social change in the city which he blames for his family's humbling. He researches the history of the royal family and determines that Carrot Ironfoundersson is in fact the rightful heir to the throne. Meanwhile, Captain Samuel Vimes, captain of the Ankh-Morpork City Watch, prepares for his imminent wedding to Sybil Ramkin, the richest woman in Ankh-Morpork. He also must deal with a new group of recruits that he has been required to take on for the sake of diversity: Cuddy (a dwarf), Detritus (a troll), and Angua (a werewolf‚Äîbut Carrot is unaware of this, and believes she is included because she is female). When a string of seemingly random murders occur among the Guilds of the city, Lord Vetinari forbids Vimes to investigate in a successful ploy to ensure Vimes does investigate. Cuddy and Detritus are forced to work together, resulting in them becoming friends as they overcome their deep-seated racial enmity. Angua works with the talking dog Gaspode, and also forms a romantic connection with Carrot, who loses his virginity to her but handles the discovery that she is a werewolf poorly. It turns out that d'Eath has stolen the gonne, the Disc's first and only handheld firearm, from the Assassins' Guild, with the intention of discrediting Vetinari's government through the murders. Any possessor of the gonne seems to become obsessed with the device. After d'Eath reveals his plan to Dr. Cruces, head of the Assassin's Guild, Cruces murders him and takes up the plan himself. The Watch prevent Cruces from killing Vetinari, but Cuddy and Angua are killed in the process. Vimes and Carrot confront and disarm Cruces, and Carrot helps Vimes resist the gonne's allure. Cruces gives Carrot the evidence that he is the royal heir, upon which Carrot kills Cruces with his sword and has both the evidence and the dismantled gonne buried with Cuddy. Angua gets shot 3 times by Cruces; as a werewolf can only be killed with a silver weapon, Angua is revived upon the moon's rising. Vimes and Ramkin are married. Recent events have raised the Night Watch's profile, bringing a slew of new recruits. Carrot visits Vetinari, who is expecting Carrot to make personal demands as he is now in a strong position to blackmail the Patrician. What Carrot actually brings is a request for Vetinari to implement a plan for reforming the City Watch into an effective, integrated, comprehensive police force with better working conditions. Vetinari accedes, making Carrot Captain of the Watch and elevating Vimes to the recreated position Commander of the Watch, and the rank of Knight.

It was first released in 1996 and published by Victor Gollancz. It came in 137th place in The Big Read, a BBC survey of the most loved British books of all time, making it one of fifteen books by Pratchett in the Top 200. The book focuses on the absence of the Hogfather, a mythical creature akin to Father Christmas, who grants children's wishes on Hogswatchnight (December 32) and brings them presents. While Death attempts to fill in for the Hogfather, his granddaughter Susan Sto Helit tries to find and rescue the Hogfather. Plot summary The Auditors of Reality, a group of \\"celestial bureaucrats\\" attempt to eliminate the Hogfather, a jolly god-like creature who brings children presents on December 32nd, similar to the figures of Santa Claus and Father Christmas in the US and UK. Forbidden to interfere directly by \\"The Rules\\", they pay the Assassin's Guild to kill the Hogfather instead. The task is given to Mr. Teatime who has a reputation for ruthlessness and creative solutions. Mr. Teatime enlists the help of some gangsters to find a delivery person working for the Tooth Fairy, using his magic to break into her kingdom and stealing all the collected teeth. With these teeth, he is able to control all the children on the Discworld, commanding them to no longer believe in the Hogfather. Knowing that the Hogfather is also responsible for the sun rising, Death attempts to maintain belief by dressing up as the Hogfather and fulfilling his role. Since he is unable himself to defeat Mr. Teatime, who resides in a realm created by children's belief where death (and thus Death) does not exist, he appears at his granddaughter's place of work dressed as the Hogfather. As he had planned, Susan Sto Helit is unable to resist her curiosity and tries to find the Hogfather. She visits the Hogfather's Castle of Bones, only to find the hung- over Bilious, the \\"Oh God\\" of Hangovers. In an attempt to cure Bilious from his hangovers, Susan visits the Unseen University, where it is discovered that several small gods and beings (including Bilious) are being created due to an abundance of excess belief in the world caused by the Hogfather's disappearance. Susan and Bilious travel to the Tooth Fairy's realm and discover Mr. Teatime's plot. Mr. Teatime attacks Susan using Death's sword, but since it does not work in this realm, Susan is able to overpower him and throw him off the tower, causing him to disappear. She then manages to rescue the Hogfather, who has reverted to his former self as a hog, from Auditors who hound him in the form of attack dogs. As Susan is returning to her place of work, Death explains what happened to Susan but she is attacked by Teatime whom she finally manages to kill using the kitchen poker. TV adaptation A two-part TV film version of Hogfather was screened on 17 and 18 December 2006 on Sky One in the UK, with Ian Richardson as the voice of Death and David Jason playing Death's manservant Albert. Marc Warren played Mr. Teatime, Michelle Dockery played Susan Sto Helit, Rhodri Meilir played Bilious, and Tony Robinson (who narrated several audiobook versions of the Discworld novels) played the shop keeper Vernon Crumley. Terry Pratchett himself had a brief cameo as the toy-maker. The US debut was on 25 November 2007 on ION Television, the Australian on 23 and 24 December 2007 on Channel Seven, and the German on 25 December 2007 on ProSieben.  Reception  The novel entered the UK Top 10 charts at #1 as hardback in October 1996 and as paperback in November 1997. According to Publishers Weekly, Pratchett used a darker than usual tone as well as edgier satire for Hogfather than usually and concludes that he has now moved beyond the realm of humorous fantasy and should be recognized instead as \\"one of the more significant contemporary English- language satirists\\".

Patchett served as Member of Parliament for Barnsley East from 1983 until his death, and was a member of the Labour Party.  Early life  Patchett was born in Darfield, South Yorkshire on 11 July 1940. He studied politics and economics at the University of Sheffield.  Career  Before becoming an MP, Patchett worked as a miner for seventeen years. A member of the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM), he became the branch delegate for Houghton Main in 1966, and from 1977 he was a member of the union's Yorkshire executive. From 1969 to 1973 he was also on Wombwell District Council. Though he wanted to be the miners' agent for Barnsley, in 1982 Arthur Scargill instead offered him the candidacy for the safe Labour seat of Dearne Valley, whose incumbent MP, Edwin Wainwright, was retiring. After boundary changes, he won the redrawn seat of Barnsley East in 1983 with a majority of 17,500 votes. = Member of Parliament = Patchett felt out of place in the House of Commons and rarely spoke in the chamber. However, he was on the Select Committee on Social Services and served as vice-chairman of the Parliamentary Labour Party's energy committee. Defending the interests of mining communities, he opposed the Petroleum Royalties (Relief) Act 1983, which exempted oil companies from royalties on new fields, denouncing it as an attempt to weaken the NUM. He also opposed the closure of rich collieries such as Barnburgh and plans to increase imports of foreign coal. He was strongly loyal to Scargill and politically was on the left wing of the Labour Party. Patchett's last appearance in Parliament was the vote on the Scott Report on 26 February 1996. Suffering from cancer, he risked his life to go to vote, against his doctor's advice and family's wishes, because of the opportunity of defeating the government. He made the journey from Darfield to Westminster by ambulance.  Personal life and death  In 1961 Patchett married Glenys Veal, with whom he had three children. He died of cancer on 11 October 1996 and the subsequent by-election was won by Jeff Ennis.

He was noted for his paintings depicting rural life in his home state, Kansas. Along with Thomas Hart Benton and Grant Wood, he was hailed as one of the three great painters of American Regionalism of the first half of the twentieth century. Curry's artistic production was varied, including paintings, book illustrations, prints, and posters. Curry was Kansas's best known painter, but his works were not popular with Kansans, who felt that he did not portray the state positively enough. Curry's paintings often depicted farm life and animals, tornadoes, prairie fires, and the violent Bleeding Kansas period (featuring abolitionist John Brown, who at the time was derided as a fanatical traitor) ‚Äì subjects that Kansans did not want to be representative of the state. Curry was commissioned to create murals for the Kansas State Capitol, and he completed two: Kansas Pastoral, and his most famous and controversial work, Tragic Prelude, which he considered his greatest. Reaction was so negative that the Kansas Legislature passed a measure to keep them, or future works of his, from being hung on the capitol walls. As a result, Curry did not sign the works, which were not hung during his lifetime. He left Topeka in disgust; his planned 8 smaller murals for the Capitol rotunda on the first floor never went beyond sketches, now held by the Kansas Museum of History. Curry's works were painted with movement, which was conveyed by the free brush work and energized forms that characterized his style. His control over brushstrokes created excited emotions such as fear and despair in his paintings. His fellow Regionalists, who also painted action and movement, influenced Curry's style. Biography Curry was born on a farm in Dunavant, Kansas, November 14, 1897; the house has been moved to Osawatomie and there are plans to make a museum of it. He was the eldest of five children to parents Thomas Smith Curry and Margaret Steuart Curry. Despite living on a Midwestern farm, both of Curry's parents were college educated and had even visited Europe for their honeymoon. Curry's early life consisted of caring for the animals on the farm, attending the nearby high school and excelling in athletics. His childhood home was filled with many reproductions of Peter Paul Rubens and Gustave Dor√©, and these artists' styles played a significant role in crafting Curry's own style. His family was very religious, as were most people in Dunavant. Curry was encouraged to paint animals around the farm, and at the age of twelve he had his first art lesson. In 1916 he entered the Kansas City Art Institute, but after only a month there he transferred to the Art Institute of Chicago, where he stayed for two years. In 1918 he attended Geneva College in Beaver Falls, Pennsylvania. After he graduated, Curry worked as an illustrator from 1921 to 1926. He worked for several magazines, including Boys' Life, St. Nicholas, County Gentleman, and The Saturday Evening Post.Wunderlich, Mongerson. John Steuart Curry: Rural America. New York: ACA Galleries, 1991 In 1926 Curry spent a year in Paris studying the works of Gustave Courbet and Honor√© Daumier, as well as the color techniques of Titian and Rubens. After his return to the United States he settled in New York City and married Clara Derrick; shortly thereafter, they moved to an artists' colony in Westport, Connecticut. Clara died in June 1932 and for the next two years Curry devoted his time to working in his studio. He traveled briefly with the Ringling Brothers Circus and during his time with them created his painting The Flying Cadonas. He remarried in 1934 to Kathleen Gould. In 1936, Curry was appointed as the first artist-in-residence at the College of Agriculture of the University of Wisconsin, which built him a small studio. He had no classes to teach nor any specific duties; he was free to travel throughout the state and promote art in farming communities by providing personal instruction to students. As seen later, the experience turned Curry into a conservationist, especially concerned with Kansas's man-made ecological disaster, the plowing that produced horrible erosion in Kansas, along with dust bowl storms. The same year he was commissioned to paint a mural for the Department of Justice Building and Main Interior Building in Washington.Dennis, James M. Renegade Regionalists: The Modern Independence of Grant Wood, Thomas Hart Benton, and John Steuart Curry. Wisconsin: University of Wisconsin Press, 1998. In 1937 he was elected into the National Academy of Design as an Associate Member, and became a full Academician in 1943. This was followed with what might have been the crown of his career, a commission to paint murals on Kansas topics for the Kansas State Capitol at Topeka, on which abortive project see below. Curry continued to work at the University of Wisconsin until he died of a heart attack in Madison in 1946, at the age of 48.Schmeckebier, Laurence. \\"John Steuart Curry Obituaries\\", College Art Journal. College Art Association v.6.1(1946): 59‚Äì60. Curry and regionalistic art Curry was one of the three great painters of American regionalistic art; the others were Thomas Hart Benton and Grant Wood. All three were from the Midwest, west of the Mississippi: Wood from Iowa, Benton from Missouri, and Curry from Kansas. Their art presents a nostalgic look at rural life in the American heartland. Regionalism was essentially a revolt against at least one major evil of the industrial revolution: centralization. Centralization of manufacturing permitted mass production, with efficient factories and assembly-line production. This reduced the cost of manufactured goods, but at the expense of regional or local variety and initiative. The Wall Street Crash of 1929 and the subsequent Great Depression demonstrated the limitations and failures of capitalism. Rugged depictions of regional, independent life in wide-open spaces provided an alternative. As put by Meyer Schapiro, \\"Regionalism obscured the crucial forces of history, as defined by Marx, and provided entertaining distractions from the realities facing oppressed people.\\" In contrast with Wood, who lived in Iowa, and Benton in Missouri, Curry did not live in Kansas as an adult. As seen by Curry, nostalgia for rural Kansan life ignored its shortcomings: tornados, prairie fires, dust storms, plagues of insects, and life-threatening floods. The depiction of the same in his paintings had as consequence the reservations some Kansans felt about seeing him, without qualification, as Kansas's great painter. In fact, as he well knew, his works did not sell in Kansas. The University of Wisconsin hired him in 1936 as artist-in-residence, something no Kansas university would do. At Wisconsin, based in the College of Agriculture, Curry became a conservationist. What some Kansans found particularly offensive was his stated plan to portray the tragedy of soil erosion in one of his planned murals for the Kansas Capitol, providing a \\"significant warning\\" to Kansas farmers that they had brought on an ecological disaster. He was surprised when these plans met with local resentment. Curry and Wisconsin Freeing of the Slaves, by John Steuart Curry. The Union Army, marching through, has just delivered the Emancipation Proclamation. Reading Room, Law Library, University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison. Curry was thought of in his day as the great Kansas painter, and it was no secret that he wanted to paint murals for Kansas; he confirmed this to a reporter. However, his relationship with Kansas was complicated. He lived in Connecticut and declined repeated suggestions that he move back to his home state; instead, he moved to Wisconsin when its University offered him in 1936 what no Kansas institution would: a position as artist-in-residence. He remained there until his death in 1946. While at Wisconsin he completed in 1942 a by mural on the Emancipation Proclamation, titled Freeing of the Slaves. It was originally intended, in 1936, for the new U.S. Department of Justice Building, but sketches were rejected by federal officials, who told Curry that they feared that ‚Äúserious difficulties...might arise as a result of the racial implications of the subject matter.‚Äù Curry painted two other murals in that building, Movement of the Population Westward and Law versus Mob Rule. However, the design caught the attention of Wisconsin Law School dean Lloyd K. Garrison, great-grandson of the famous abolitionist Wm. Lloyd Garrison, who had it installed in the Reading Room of the new Law School library. Curry and Kansas In his many Kansas-themed works, he wanted to present a \\"personal view\\" of Kansas history. \\"I want to picture what I feel about my native state.\\" In preparation for the crowning project of his career, the Kansas Capitol murals, he spent several days in the Kansas Historical Society and the Topeka Public Library studying Kansas history. As he put it, he wanted to \\"wreak good\\" upon Kansas. Curry painted Kansas as he saw it, warts and all. His planned pieces for the first-floor rotunda of the Kansas Capitol, which never got beyond preliminary sketches, included one on conservation and erosion. Curry expressed the view of the professors in the College of Agriculture, that Kansas farmers' poor soil management caused the erosion and dust storms of 1930s Kansas. This displeased many Kansans, who did not want soil erosion, or the alleged errors of Kansas farmers, in their Capitol. Furthermore, John Brown was a convicted traitor, and in the opinion of many, a kook. The opposition grew so bitter that Curry abandoned his great Kansas Capitol project in disgust. He refused to sign the two works completed or allow them to be hung, as he said they were intended to be seen as part of a group. They were hung in the Capitol after his death. =Baptism in Kansas= Baptism in Kansas In August 1928 Curry painted Baptism in Kansas, which was exhibited at the Corcoran Gallery in Washington, D.C., and met with almost instant success. The painting was praised in the New York Times and earned Curry the attention of Mrs. Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney. In 1931 Mrs. Vanderbilt Whitney purchased the painting for the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York City, thus establishing him as a major artist. Baptism in Kansas reflected the religious sects that held open-air baptisms. These popular religious groups were part of the scene of rural life that Curry saw in Kansas. He presents the scene with reverence. No well-known Baptismal representations by old world masters employ the unique compositional layout that Curry favors. Curry's painting was a shock to Easterners who would have never associated a baptism with full immersion or with a barnyard setting, but Curry painted what he was familiar with, as Lawrence Shmeckebrier said he \\"saw this scene as conceived and executed with sincere reverence and understanding of one who had lived it.\\" Curry's religious painting is therefore an observance rather than a satire on religious fundamentalism. =Tornado over Kansas= Under Mrs. Whitney's patronage Curry painted Tornado over Kansas, which depicts a farmer facing an approaching tornado while he and his wife help the family and animals into the tornado shelter. The painting was unveiled in 1929 just before the Wall Street Crash in October and provided those in the city with the romance of man versus nature themes. Typical of Curry's work of the 1930s, he depicted scenes of labor, family, and land, in order to demonstrate peace, struggle, and perseverance that he had come to believe was the essence of American life, the spirit of Kansas. =Kansas Pastoral= Kansas Pastoral is the first of two murals completed for the Kansas Capitol. It presents a fictional agrarian utopia. The farmer is at leisure; the farm, its crops, and its animals are marvels of order, and seem to run themselves. The manual labor of the farm woman is no longer needed, and she can devote herself to the home. =Tragic Prelude= Tragic Prelude presents a visual history of Kansas: the first Europeans, Juan de Padilla and Coronado, followed by a plainsman hunting buffalos, and finally the Bleeding Kansas period of 1854‚Äì1861. During this period, when Kansas was the focus of national attention like no time before or since, \\"old\\" John Brown, believing he was doing the Lord's work, and well armed, led anti-slavery settlers in resisting, with violence if unfortunately necessary, the attempts to make Kansas a slave state. Kansas' status was not resolved until the beginning of the Civil War, when six slave states had seceded, and it could come into the Union as a free state. Brown's role during the Bleeding Kansas period‚Äîhe was also an Underground Railroad conductor‚Äîwas not widely remembered outside of Kansas. However, his name was familiar to anyone who had had a course in American history, as he was widely believed to have helped cause the Civil War, and on purpose, with his raid on the federal arsenal in Harpers Ferry, Virginia (since 1863, West Virginia). He was quickly convicted of treason against the state of Virginia, murder, and fomenting a slave insurrection, and hung. \\"John Brown's Body\\" was the marching song of Union soldiers. Tragic Prelude puts Brown in front of the troops killing each other. In the background, approaching tornado and prairie fires suggest the calamity, the Civil War, that was fast approaching, and that Brown seemed to be calling for. The painting produced a negative reaction in advance of its being hung. (It was not hung until after Curry's death.) John Brown, convicted of treason against the state of Virginia, was not someone most Kansans felt proud of, nor was the Bleeding Kansas period as a whole. Adding to public consternation was Curry's plan to portray ruinous soil erosion, in Kansas a very controversial and political topic, in another mural. The Legislature could not fire Curry since he was being paid out of funds newspaper editors raised from the public. However, they withdrew permission for Curry's works to be hung in the Capitol. This was devastating to Curry. He left Kansas in disgust and refused to sign the two murals he did complete, saying that they could not be understood in isolation. Political art Curry's art in general was conservative in political content. He believed that art was for the common person. He did not believe in political propaganda, particularly the Marxist kind that Diego Rivera popularized in the 1930s. Curry avoided exploiting the controversial subjects in which Rivera became involved because, he did not believe they added any artistic quality to his work. However, Curry did create a few political sketches or studies, but these were never expanded on for larger projects. Rather, he enjoyed observing public events and capturing them on paper. Curry's few semi-political paintings evolved out of his personal experiences rather than created as a display of social commentary. The Return of Private Davis, completed in 1940, was first witnessed near his home in 1918, and a similar study was made in France during 1926. Schmeckenbier relates this painting to the ceremony of baptism: \\"a rural religious ceremony whose tragedy is intensified by the realization that this son of the fresh green Kansas prairies was sacrificed on a battlefield whose ideological remoteness was as dramatic as its geographical makeup.\\"Schmeckebier, Laurence E. John Steuart Curry's Pageant of America. New York: American Artists Group Inc., 1943. The painting does not express a political spectacle, rather Curry's personal feelings. Conversely, Parade to War depicts departing soldiers rather than the return of a victim of war. Along with war scenes Curry also produced manhunt and fugitive subjects. These ideas were inspired by remembrances from his own childhood, but were also observed from publicized events during the early 1930s. The Lindbergh kidnapping and John Dillinger's crime spree were well known and public deaths such as lynchings were often the result of such crimes. In addition, the plight of black male victims of lynching became a focus of attention. Curry's painting, The Fugitive, showing a black man hiding from a mob, appeared in a 1935 exhibition, \\"An Art Commentary on Lynching,\\" organized in support of national anti-lynching legislation (which never passed, then or later). These earlier political works would influence later Curry's mural work in the Department of Justice Building. Located \\"above the entrance to the Justice Department library\\" is Curry's painting, Law vs. Mob Rule in which a judge in black robes protects a man who has collapsed on the courthouse steps from a lynch mob. Reactions and legacy Despite popularity in the rest of the country, Curry's works did not find favor in Kansas. He was taken as ridiculing the worst aspects of the state. Kansans felt the inclusion of outdoor baptisms and tornadoes perpetuated negative stereotypes about the state. When these paintings were displayed in New York galleries many Kansans felt belittled. However, the New York public was fascinated by Curry's paintings. Curry's paintings were entertaining and easy to grasp, and allowed viewers to see a more primitive, isolated, non-commercial version of America. In 1992 the Kansas Legislature apologized for its treatment of Curry, and purchased the drawings related to his murals.

When looking at Table Mountain from the city centre, or when looking at the standard picture postcard view of the mountain, the skyline is from left to right: the spire of Devil's Peak, the flat mesa of Table Mountain, the dome of Lion's Head and Signal Hill. The central districts of Cape Town are nestled within this natural amphitheatre. The city grew out of a settlement founded on the shore below the mountains in 1652 by Jan van Riebeeck, for the Dutch East India Company. Some of the first farms in the Cape were established on the slopes of Devil's Peak, along the Liesbeek River. Devil's Peak stands high, less than Table Mountain's . One can walk to the top (western slopes provide the easiest approach) but the ascent is more pleasant and safer outside of the cold, wet, winter months of May to August.  Landmarks  Devil's Peak with the University of Cape Town's Upper Campus situated on its slopes. The Rhodes Memorial to Cecil Rhodes, and the University of Cape Town are situated on the eastern slopes of Devil's Peak. From these vantages one can gaze down upon the southern suburbs of Cape Town and over the sandy Cape Flats towards Stellenbosch, Somerset West, and the distant Boland mountains. Other landmarks on the eastern slopes are Mostert's Mill, Groote Schuur Hospital, and the Groote Schuur estate, including a number of presidential and ministerial residences. The King's Blockhouse, situated on Mowbray Ridge A number of historic military blockhouses are situated on Devil's Peak, along with a number of cannons intended to defend the city from attack from the south. There is an abandoned fire lookout high up on Mowbray Ridge. On 26 May 1971 a formation of three military aircraft, flying by sight along the N2 highway, banked to the right three seconds too late, narrowly missing the University and Rhodes Memorial but subsequently crashing into the side of the mountain. For many years a radar reflector beacon stood on Plumpudding Hill above Rhodes Memorial to prevent similar incidents. Hiking There are a lot of easy walks on the lower slopes of the mountain. A popular short hike is from Rhodes Memorial to the King's blockhouse. The only safe ascent of the peak is from the Saddle, between the peak and Table Mountain. There are three routes to reach the Saddle: from Tafelberg Road on the city side, up Newlands Ravine from Newlands Forest, or the upper contour path from Mowbray Ridge and Minor Peak. Once on the Saddle, a straightforward path climbs directly to the summit. The 360¬∞ view from the summit is well worth the slog. The peak is very exposed to wind and mist, so hikers must always take care. A number of the descents on the Southern Suburbs side are very steep and wet, and are highly dangerous (particularly Second Waterfall Ravine, Dark Gorge and Els Ravine). These routes should not be attempted, as many lives have been lost by hikers taking the wrong route. The general rule that applies is to stick to known and well-marked paths, and not to push on into the unknown. Vegetation Indigenous forest growing on the southern slopes of Devil's Peak The northern slopes overlooking the city centre are covered in typical Cape Peninsula Shale Fynbos. These slopes are hotter and prone to frequent fires, and as a result the vegetation is low. Here can also be found a small stretch of critically endangered Peninsula Shale Renosterveld vegetation, an endemic vegetation type that used to dominate the Cape Town City Bowl but is now mostly lost due to urban development. Peninsula Shale Fynbos growing on the northern slopes of Devil's Peak The slopes on the Southern Suburbs side however, are naturally wetter and more protected from fires, so these slopes were originally partially covered with deep indigenous forests. Some of these dense afro-montane forests still remain in the gorges, but most of them were cut down to make way for commercial pine plantations. Near Rhodes Memorial there are a few surviving natural stands of a famous native tree called the Silvertree. This is possibly the last place on earth where the tree still grows wild. During the second half of the 19th century and the first half of the 20th, Devil's Peak (and other adjacent heights) were commercially planted with plantations of cluster pines, a problematic invasive non-indigenous tree. Local authorities organized paid workers and volunteers to chop down the pines from the peak and most of them are now gone (although in Newlands Forest on the lower reaches, pine and gum forests are still maintained for recreational purposes). The original indigenous Afro-montane forest is also slowly re-growing on the southern slopes and above Newlands forest where the pines have been cleared. Stone pines (a non-invasive alien tree) still remain in the area around Rhodes Memorial.  Fauna  Tahr herd on Devil's Peak before culling began. Near Rhodes Memorial, some of the lower slopes of Devil's Peak are artificially maintained as savanna, and some herds of eland, wildebeest and zebra are kept there. In the 1930s, a few Himalayan Tahrs escaped from a zoo on the slopes of Devil's Peak and bred until their population on the Table Mountain range was over 700. A culling programme has eliminated most of them, although a few still remain. Some of the original local species of small antelope are being re-introduced to replace the tahrs. Around Rhodes Memorial there were also some feral deer of European origin, which can still be found on the lower slopes. Indigenous animals include porcupines, caracals, small grey mongoose, rock hyraxes (also known as dassies), and many species of bird.  Geology  Devil's Peak as viewed from the Summit of Table Mountain. The upper, rocky parts of Devil's Peak, Table Mountain and Lion's Head consist of a hard, uniform and resistant sandstone commonly known as the Table Mountain sandstone or TMS. (This is, however, no longer used as a formal geological name). The tough sandstone rests conformably upon a basal shale that in turn lies unconformably upon a basement of older (Late Precambrian) rocks (Malmesbury shale/slate and the Cape Granite). The basal shale and the older rocks below it weather much faster than the TMS and for this reason the lower slopes are smoother in all parts, with few outcrops and deeper soil. Millions of years of erosion have stripped all of the TMS from Signal Hill and that is why it looks very rounded compared to its sister peaks. There is a road that runs almost on the contour from the lower cable station on Table Mountain along the mountain to Devil's Peak. As it turns east around the bulk of Devil's Peak the road cuttings expose a few famous geological unconformities, which illustrate very clearly that the Malmesbury rocks were folded, baked, intruded by granite and planed down by millions of years of erosion before the area sank below the ocean and a new sequence of sediments, including the TMS, began to accumulate.  Origins of the name  Devil's Peak was originally known as Windberg or Charles Mountain. The English term Devil's Peak is a 19th-century translation from the Dutch Duivels Kop, and supposedly comes from the folk-tale about a Dutch man called Jan van Hunks, a prodigious pipe smoker who lived at the foot of the mountain circa 1700. He was forced by his wife to leave the house whenever he smoked his pipe. One day, while smoking on the slopes of the peak, he met a mysterious stranger who also smoked. They each bragged of how much they smoked and so they fell into a pipe-smoking contest. The stranger turned out to be the devil and Van Hunks eventually won the contest, but not before the smoke that they had made had covered the mountain, forming the table cloth cloud. The story was captured by the 19th century poet Dante Gabriel Rossetti in his poem Jan van Hunks (alternatively called The Dutchman's Wager). However, since Rosetti's poem was only published in 1909, it's unlikely that this was the true source of the name, rather an urban legend. It has also been claimed that the name is a corruption of Duifespiek (\\"Dove's Peak\\") to Duivelspiek (\\"Devil's Peak\\"), since the Dutch the words for devil and dove are relatively close in sound. The Dutch word \\"Duivelspiek\\" has been the common Afrikaans language name for the mountain and the suburb on the east side of the city bowl. The name is also thought to have been derived from the mountain's 'three pronged' spear shape, which is reminiscent of the spear held by the Devil in many images. A more likely explanation is provided by Devil's Peak Brewery. Forty years before Vasco de Gama rounded the Cape in 1497, the Venetian cartographer Fra Mauro created a map of the world for King Alfonso V of Portugal, based on knowledge drawn from the Arabians. On this map, which became the definitive view of the world for the early Portuguese explorers, he named the southernmost tip of Africa, Cabo di Diab ‚Äì the Devil's Cape. It is very likely the association with the devil simply migrated from the Cape to the mountain that flanks it. After all, sailors are a superstitious lot and Devil's Peak remains the path through which the Cape Southeaster howls, churning up the waves in the Cape of Storms. 1971 Plane Crash On 26 May 1971, three South African Air Force Hawker-Siddelley HS125 (Code named Mercurius) aircraft crashed into Devil's Peak, killing all 11 on board. The aircraft were flying in close formation, practicing for a fly past during the upcoming 10th anniversary Republic Day celebrations on 31 May. A low cloud base was cited as a contributory factor. The impact was heard throughout the surrounding suburbs and scars in the ground can still be seen today.Fields of Air, James Byrom, Ashanti Publishing, 1993  See also  * * References Category:Table Mountain Category:Aviation accidents and incidents in South Africa Category:Table Mountain National Park ","title":"Devil's Peak (Cape Town)"},{"id":"552216","text":"A-10 Thunderbolt II in a dive, conducting a strafing run A German vehicle column destroyed by ground-attack aircraft close to Arnhem, 23 September 1944 Strafing is the military practice of attacking ground targets from low-flying aircraft using aircraft-mounted automatic weapons. Less commonly, the term can be used‚Äîby extension‚Äîto describe high-speed firing runs by any land or naval craft (e.g. fast boats) using smaller-caliber weapons and targeting stationary or slow-moving targets.  Etymology  The word is an adaptation of German strafen, to punish, specifically from the humorous adaptation of the World War I German catchphrase \\"Gott strafe England\\" (May God punish England).Richard B.H. Lewis, The Art of Strafing, July 2007, airforce-magazine.com Description Messerschmitt Bf 109E strafing Australian positions in North Africa, 1941 Weapons used in strafing range from machine guns (5mm to 20mm) to autocannon or rotary cannon (typically 20mm to 37mm). This means that, although ground attack using automatic weapons fire is very often accompanied with bombing or rocket fire, the term \\"strafing\\" does not specifically include the last two. The term \\"strafing\\" can cover either fixed guns, or aimable (flexible) guns. Fixed guns firing directly ahead tend to be more predominant on fixed wing aircraft, while helicopters tend to use gimballed weapons which can be fired in many different directions independent of the direction the aircraft is pointing in (in most cases, flexible guns on a fixed wing aircraft are for defense purposes only, although they can sometimes be used to fire on ground targets to limited effect). Beaufighters strafing a Vorpostenboot, 1944 Some fixed wing aircraft, like fighter-bombers, are capable of flying either air-combat missions or ground attack missions (P-47 Thunderbolt), while others are dedicated ground-attack types (Il-2 Sturmovik). In cases where an aircraft is capable of both types of combat, when it is assigned to a ground attack role, and thus expected to be using the guns mostly for strafing, the fixed weapons are often mounted so that the convergence point is lower and at a greater range than would be used for air combat. This is helpful because it allows the pilot to aim at a target without having to dive towards the ground as steeply, decreasing the risk of collision with the ground and increasing the amount of firing time available before having to pull up, and it also increases the range from the target, helping avoid anti-aircraft fire and potential damage from exploding targets. Because of the low altitude and relatively low airspeed required for accurate strafing, it is very risky for the pilot, who is exposed not only to the risk of flight-into-terrain and obstacles such as power lines, but also to anti-aircraft weapons, including surface-to-air missiles (both vehicle mounted and hand-held), anti-aircraft artillery and small caliber weapons fire (such as machine guns and small arms). Planes purposely designed for ground attack may include additional armour around and underneath the cockpit and other vulnerable areas such as engines to protect the pilot and key flight components, while aircraft designed mostly for air combat tend to have most of their armor placed to protect directly ahead or to the rear, where fire from other aircraft is most likely, leaving them more vulnerable to fire from directly below or to the sides, where much ground fire often comes from.  History  =World War I= While the earliest use of military aircraft was for observation and directing of artillery, strafing was frequently practised in World War I. Trenches and supply columns were routinely attacked from the air in the second half of the war. Strafing with machine guns was used when precision was needed (facing small targets), but non-strafing attack methods (primarily small bombs) were preferred for larger targets, area targets, or when low-altitude flying was too risky. The German army was the first to introduce a class of aircraft specially designed for strafing, the ground-attack aircraft. Planes built specifically for strafing include the German World War I Junkers J.I, which was armored to protect it from ground-based gunfire. The Junkers J.I. had two downward-facing machine guns that were used for strafing. =World War II= These developments continued through World War II with dedicated aircraft including the concept of the heavily protected cockpit or \\"bathtub\\" to permit the pilot to survive counterfire from anti-aircraft batteries. Ju 87 G The Luftwaffe's best strafing plane was the Junkers Ju 87 Stuka. The Ju 87 G variant had two Rheinmetall-Borsig 37mm Flak 18 guns each mounted under the wing. For the RAF, the best ground attack plane was the Hawker Hurricane II. It was armed with four 20 mm (.79 in) wing-mounted cannon. The Hawker Typhoon was used in the later stages of the war. It had four \\"60 lb\\" RP-3 rockets. For the US, the Republic P-47 Thunderbolt was one of the key ground attack planes. It was armed with eight .50 calibre machine guns. Another aircraft that was important in that role was the North American B-25 Mitchell. It was used for low-altitude strafing runs in the Pacific War. The Russian Ilyushin IL-2 Sturmovik was one of the key Russian ground attack planes. It had heavy armour around the engine, underside and canopy. It was armed with 20mm, 23mm, or 37mm cannon, depending on the model. An RCAF Spitfire of 412 Squadron piloted by Charley Fox strafed the command car of Erwin Rommel on 17 July 1944 near Sainte-Foy-de-Montgommery, affecting his possible participation in the 20 July 1944 Operation Valkyrie coup. =Post-1945= In the Korean War in 1950‚Äì1953, USAF planes strafed targets deep behind the front line and had a perceptible impact on the progress of the ground war ‚Äì but the concept of strafing was already in decline. In 1960s, when precision-guided weapons became widespread, strafing temporarily fell out of favor as unnecessarily risky‚Äî some American fighter aircraft or attack aircraft of that time (such as the F-4 Phantom and A-6 Intruder) did not have built-in cannon or machine guns. In the Vietnam War, this was found to be a deficiency, and improvised \\"gunships\\" had to be used in strafing missions. Gunships like the AC-47 Spooky, AC-119 Specter, and early models of the AC-130 Spooky gunship proved to be devastating defenders of besieged US Special Forces camps. The A-10 Thunderbolt II is an American twin-engine, straight-wing jet aircraft developed by Fairchild-Republic in the early 1970s which is the only United States Air Force aircraft designed solely for close air support of ground forces. The A-10 was built to attack tanks, armored vehicles, and other ground targets with limited air defenses, often though strafing. A-10's 30 mm GAU-8 Avenger cannon is used for strafing tanks, armored vehicles and other ground targets. The A-10 was designed around the GAU-8 Avenger, a 30 mm rotary cannon that is the airplane's primary armament and the heaviest such automatic cannon mounted on an aircraft. The A-10's airframe was designed for survivability, with measures such as of armor for protection of the cockpit and aircraft systems that enables the aircraft to continue flying after taking significant damage. The A-10's official name comes from the Republic P-47 Thunderbolt of World War II, a fighter that was particularly effective at close air support. The A-10 is the main US plane designed to do strafing runs. Since 2001, Coalition pilots in Iraq and Afghanistan have used strafing runs to support ground forces in areas where explosive ordnance could cause unacceptable civilian casualties. Strafing runs done by F-16s are very risky for the pilot. The cities of Damascus and Aleppo were strafed by helicopter gunships in the Syrian civil war. In 2004, the United States Air Force accidentally strafed one of its own country's middle schools in the strafing of the Little Egg Harbor Intermediate School incident.

Mansfield is a small town in the foothills of the Victorian Alps in the Australian state of Victoria. It is approximately north- east of Melbourne by road. The population of Mansfield was as at the 2016 census. Mansfield is the seat of the Mansfield local government area. Mansfield was formerly heavily dependent on farming and logging, but is now a tourist-centre. It is the support town for the large Australia ski resort Mount Buller. It is associated with the high country tradition of alpine grazing, celebrated in the film made around Mansfield, near the now famous Craigs Hut, called The Man from Snowy River (based on a poem by Banjo Paterson). History The traditional owners of the Mansfield region are the Yowengillum clan of the Taungurung people. They also inhabited Alexandra, and the Upper Goulburn River. British colonisers began to enter the region in 1839 when Andrew Ewing (sometimes referred to as Andrew Ewan), a stockman representing the Scottish livestock company Watson & Hunter, scouted the area for a new sheep station. Ewing encountered Yowengillum people along a waterway he named Devils River as he considered these people were \\"black devils\\". The best land was to be found east of this river, adjacent to Mount Battery (known as Bayerlite to the Yowengillum), and Ewing established the Mount Battery sheep station there in 1840. The overseer's hut was built near to where the town of Mansfield now stands. Aboriginal encampments were also located near to Mount Battery and were noted for their large stone ovens. Bitteruc, a Yowengillum elder at this time, stated that the land around Bayerlite was \\"good country, my country.\\" Mansfield, originally known as Mount Battery, became a township that was surveyed in 1851 and named after Mansfield in Nottinghamshire, England. Settlement came after the discovery of gold nearby and the Post Office opened on 1 January 1858. The railway to Mansfield arrived in the town from Tallarook in 1891, being closed on 18 November 1978. The last passenger service was on 28 May 1977. The area round Mansfield named as Banbury was also the location of the novel The Far Country by Nevil Shute which featured logging on Mount Buller and previous forest fires, which having swept through Howqua obliterated almost all traces of a former settlement. Mansfield is famous as part of the Ned Kelly Trail. Significant memorials include the Memorial to Police erected in the centre of the town's roundabout. Mansfield Cemetery is the burial ground for police officers slain by Ned Kelly and his gang at Stringybark Creek. Dr. John Pearson Rowe (1810‚Äì1878) was a physician and squatter who owned the 'Loyola Run' (also known as Mount Battery) near Mansfield. Reputed as the first Roman Catholic resident of the district, it is recorded that nearby Rochester was named after J. P. Rowe as he owned land on the Campaspe River. Rowe was a principal founder of the University of Melbourne. He fired a shot at a 14-year-old Ned Kelly accompanied by bushranger Harry Power in 1869. Rowe stood for the Upper House seat of the Murray District in 1859 and was defeated. In October 1878 Rowe supplied information to police Sergeant Kennedy on the whereabouts of Ned Kelly. Acting on Rowe's verified advice, Kennedy and his police party rode into the Wombat Ranges, where three of them were killed; and the Kelly Gang legend was born. Recreation Mansfield is very close to two large lakes, Lake Eildon and Lake Nillahcootie. During the summer these sites are popular waterskiing destinations. The nearby Mount Buller and Mount Stirling offer attractions all year round. During winter they are visited for skiing, lifted and back country respectively. In the summer hiking and mountain biking are popular. Ski lifts operate year-round at Mount Buller allowing bikers to easily get to the top of downhill mountain biking runs. The bushland around Mansfield is used for horse riding, trail biking and four wheel driving on extensive tracks throughout the region. In past years, the \\"Mansfield Balloon Festival\\" celebrated hot air balloons, and drew crowds and enthusiasts from across the state. The balloon Festival hasn't been to Mansfield for several years. Mansfield is also the home to the Mansfield Eagles football club, an Australian Rules team competing in the Goulburn Valley Football League. Mansfield has a horse racing club, the Mansfield District Racing Club, which schedules two race meetings a year, including the Mansfield Cup meeting on 27 December). Golfers play at the Mansfield golf course on Kidston Parade. Mansfield is at one end of the Great Victorian Rail Trail, which officially opened in 2012. The rail trail is the second longest in Australia, and is used by push bike riders, horse riders, and walkers.

Given that a system obeys detailed balance, the theorem is a general proof that thermodynamic fluctuations in a physical variable predict the response quantified by the admittance or impedance of the same physical variable (like voltage, temperature difference, etc.), and vice versa. The fluctuation‚Äìdissipation theorem applies both to classical and quantum mechanical systems. The fluctuation‚Äìdissipation theorem was proven by Herbert Callen and Theodore Welton in 1951 and expanded by Ryogo Kubo. There are antecedents to the general theorem, including Einstein's explanation of Brownian motion during his annus mirabilis and Harry Nyquist's explanation in 1928 of Johnson noise in electrical resistors. Qualitative overview and examples The fluctuation‚Äìdissipation theorem says that when there is a process that dissipates energy, turning it into heat (e.g., friction), there is a reverse process related to thermal fluctuations. This is best understood by considering some examples: * Drag and Brownian motion ::If an object is moving through a fluid, it experiences drag (air resistance or fluid resistance). Drag dissipates kinetic energy, turning it into heat. The corresponding fluctuation is Brownian motion. An object in a fluid does not sit still, but rather moves around with a small and rapidly-changing velocity, as molecules in the fluid bump into it. Brownian motion converts heat energy into kinetic energy‚Äîthe reverse of drag. * Resistance and Johnson noise ::If electric current is running through a wire loop with a resistor in it, the current will rapidly go to zero because of the resistance. Resistance dissipates electrical energy, turning it into heat (Joule heating). The corresponding fluctuation is Johnson noise. A wire loop with a resistor in it does not actually have zero current, it has a small and rapidly-fluctuating current caused by the thermal fluctuations of the electrons and atoms in the resistor. Johnson noise converts heat energy into electrical energy‚Äîthe reverse of resistance. * Light absorption and thermal radiation ::When light impinges on an object, some fraction of the light is absorbed, making the object hotter. In this way, light absorption turns light energy into heat. The corresponding fluctuation is thermal radiation (e.g., the glow of a \\"red hot\\" object). Thermal radiation turns heat energy into light energy‚Äîthe reverse of light absorption. Indeed, Kirchhoff's law of thermal radiation confirms that the more effectively an object absorbs light, the more thermal radiation it emits. Examples in detail The fluctuation‚Äìdissipation theorem is a general result of statistical thermodynamics that quantifies the relation between the fluctuations in a system that obeys detailed balance and the response of the system to applied perturbations. =Brownian motion= For example, Albert Einstein noted in his 1905 paper on Brownian motion that the same random forces that cause the erratic motion of a particle in Brownian motion would also cause drag if the particle were pulled through the fluid. In other words, the fluctuation of the particle at rest has the same origin as the dissipative frictional force one must do work against, if one tries to perturb the system in a particular direction. From this observation Einstein was able to use statistical mechanics to derive the Einstein‚ÄìSmoluchowski relation : D = {\\\\mu \\\\, k_B T} which connects the diffusion constant D and the particle mobility Œº, the ratio of the particle's terminal drift velocity to an applied force. kB is the Boltzmann constant, and T is the absolute temperature. =Thermal noise in a resistor= In 1928, John B. Johnson discovered and Harry Nyquist explained Johnson‚ÄìNyquist noise. With no applied current, the mean-square voltage depends on the resistance R, k_BT, and the bandwidth \\\\Delta u over which the voltage is measured : : \\\\langle V^2 \\\\rangle \\\\approx 4Rk_BT\\\\,\\\\Delta u. A simple circuit for illustrating Johnson-Nyquist thermal noise in a resistor. This observation can be understood through the lens of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. Take, for example, a simple circuit consisting of a resistor with a resistance R and a capacitor with a small capacitance C. Kirchhoff's law yields :V=-R\\\\frac{dQ}{dt}+\\\\frac{Q}{C} and so the response function for this circuit is :\\\\chi(\\\\omega)\\\\equiv\\\\frac{Q(\\\\omega)}{V(\\\\omega)}=\\\\frac{1}{\\\\frac{1}{C}-i\\\\omega R} In the low-frequency limit \\\\omega\\\\ll (RC)^{-1}, its imaginary part is simply :\\\\text{Im}\\\\left[\\\\chi(\\\\omega)\\\\right]\\\\approx \\\\omega RC^2 which then can be linked to the auto-correlation function S_V(\\\\omega) of the voltage via the fluctuation-dissipation theorem :S_V(\\\\omega)=\\\\frac{S_Q(\\\\omega)}{C^2}\\\\approx \\\\frac{2k_{\\\\rm B}T}{C^2\\\\omega}\\\\text{Im}\\\\left[\\\\chi(\\\\omega)\\\\right]=2Rk_{\\\\rm B}T The Johnson-Nyquist voltage noise \\\\langle V^2 \\\\rangle was observed within a small frequency bandwidth \\\\Delta u=\\\\Delta\\\\omega/(2\\\\pi) centered around \\\\omega=\\\\pm \\\\omega_0. Hence :\\\\langle V^2 \\\\rangle\\\\approx S_V(\\\\omega)\\\\times 2\\\\Delta u\\\\approx 4Rk_{\\\\rm B}T\\\\Delta u General formulation The fluctuation‚Äìdissipation theorem can be formulated in many ways; one particularly useful form is the following: Let x(t) be an observable of a dynamical system with Hamiltonian H_0(x) subject to thermal fluctuations. The observable x(t) will fluctuate around its mean value \\\\langle x\\\\rangle_0 with fluctuations characterized by a power spectrum S_x(\\\\omega) = \\\\langle \\\\hat{x}(\\\\omega)\\\\hat{x}^*(\\\\omega) \\\\rangle. Suppose that we can switch on a time-varying, spatially constant field f(t) which alters the Hamiltonian to H(x)=H_0(x)-f(t)x. The response of the observable x(t) to a time-dependent field f(t) is characterized to first order by the susceptibility or linear response function \\\\chi(t) of the system : \\\\langle x(t) \\\\rangle = \\\\langle x \\\\rangle_0 + \\\\int\\\\limits_{-\\\\infty}^{t} \\\\\\\\! f(\\\\tau) \\\\chi(t-\\\\tau)\\\\,d\\\\tau, where the perturbation is adiabatically (very slowly) switched on at \\\\tau =-\\\\infty. The fluctuation‚Äìdissipation theorem relates the two-sided power spectrum (i.e. both positive and negative frequencies) of x to the imaginary part of the Fourier transform \\\\hat{\\\\chi}(\\\\omega) of the susceptibility \\\\chi(t): : S_x(\\\\omega) = \\\\frac{2 k_\\\\mathrm{B} T}{\\\\omega} \\\\mathrm{Im}\\\\,\\\\hat{\\\\chi}(\\\\omega). The left-hand side describes fluctuations in x, the right-hand side is closely related to the energy dissipated by the system when pumped by an oscillatory field f(t) = F \\\\sin(\\\\omega t + \\\\phi). This is the classical form of the theorem; quantum fluctuations are taken into account by replacing 2 k_\\\\mathrm{B} T/\\\\omega with {\\\\hbar}\\\\,\\\\coth(\\\\hbar\\\\omega/2k_\\\\mathrm{B}T) (whose limit for \\\\hbar\\\\to 0 is 2 k_\\\\mathrm{B} T/\\\\omega). A proof can be found by means of the LSZ reduction, an identity from quantum field theory. The fluctuation‚Äìdissipation theorem can be generalized in a straightforward way to the case of space-dependent fields, to the case of several variables or to a quantum-mechanics setting. Derivation =Classical version= We derive the fluctuation‚Äìdissipation theorem in the form given above, using the same notation. Consider the following test case: the field f has been on for infinite time and is switched off at t=0 : f(t)=f_0 \\\\theta(-t) , where \\\\theta(t) is the Heaviside function. We can express the expectation value of x by the probability distribution W(x,0) and the transition probability P(x',t  x,0) : \\\\langle x(t) \\\\rangle = \\\\int dx' \\\\int dx \\\\, x' P(x',tx,0) W(x,0) . The probability distribution function W(x,0) is an equilibrium distribution and hence given by the Boltzmann distribution for the Hamiltonian H(x)=H_0(x) - x f_0 : W(x,0)= \\\\frac{\\\\exp(-\\\\beta H(x))}{\\\\int dx' \\\\, \\\\exp(-\\\\beta H(x'))} \\\\;, where \\\\beta^{-1} = k_{\\\\rm B}T. For a weak field \\\\beta x f_0 \\\\ll 1 , we can expand the right-hand side : W(x,0) \\\\approx W_0(x) [1+\\\\beta f_0 (x(0)-\\\\langle x \\\\rangle_0)], here W_0(x) is the equilibrium distribution in the absence of a field. Plugging this approximation in the formula for \\\\langle x(t) \\\\rangle yields where A(t) is the auto-correlation function of x in the absence of a field: : A(t)=\\\\langle [x(t)-\\\\langle x \\\\rangle_0][ x(0)-\\\\langle x \\\\rangle_0] \\\\rangle_0. Note that in the absence of a field the system is invariant under time-shifts. We can rewrite \\\\langle x(t) \\\\rangle - \\\\langle x \\\\rangle_0 using the susceptibility of the system and hence find with the above equation (*) : f_0 \\\\int_0^{\\\\infty} d\\\\tau \\\\, \\\\chi(\\\\tau) \\\\theta(\\\\tau-t) = \\\\beta f_0 A(t) Consequently, To make a statement about frequency dependence, it is necessary to take the Fourier transform of equation (**). By integrating by parts, it is possible to show that : -\\\\hat\\\\chi(\\\\omega) = i\\\\omega\\\\beta \\\\int\\\\limits_0^\\\\infty \\\\mathrm{e}^{-i\\\\omega t} A(t)\\\\, dt -\\\\beta A(0). Since A(t) is real and symmetric, it follows that : 2\\\\,\\\\mathrm{Im}[\\\\hat\\\\chi(\\\\omega)] = \\\\omega\\\\beta \\\\hat A(\\\\omega). Finally, for stationary processes, the Wiener‚ÄìKhinchin theorem states that the two-sided spectral density is equal to the Fourier transform of the auto-correlation function: : S_x(\\\\omega) = \\\\hat{A}(\\\\omega). Therefore, it follows that : S_x(\\\\omega) = \\\\frac{2k_\\\\text{B} T}{\\\\omega} \\\\,\\\\mathrm{Im}[\\\\hat\\\\chi(\\\\omega)]. = Quantum version= The fluctuation-dissipation theorem relates the correlation function of the observable of interest \\\\langle \\\\hat{x}(t)\\\\hat{x}(0)\\\\rangle (a measure of fluctuation) to the imaginary part of the response function \\\\text{Im}\\\\left[\\\\chi(t)\\\\right]=\\\\frac{1}{2i}\\\\left[\\\\chi(t)-\\\\chi(-t)\\\\right] (a measure of dissipation), in the frequency domain. A link between these quantities can be found through the so-called Kubo formula :\\\\chi(t-t')=i\\\\theta(t-t')\\\\langle [\\\\hat{x}(t),\\\\hat{x}(t')] \\\\rangle which follows, under the assumptions of the linear response theory, from the time evolution of the ensemble average of the observable \\\\langle\\\\hat{x}(t)\\\\rangle in the presence of a perturbing source. The Kubo formula allows us to write the imaginary part of the response function as :\\\\text{Im}\\\\left[\\\\chi(t)\\\\right]=-\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\left[\\\\langle \\\\hat{x}(t) \\\\hat{x}(0)\\\\rangle - \\\\langle \\\\hat{x}(0) \\\\hat{x}(t)\\\\rangle\\\\right] In the canonical ensemble, the second term can be re-expressed as :\\\\langle \\\\hat{x}(0) \\\\hat{x}(t)\\\\rangle=\\\\text{Tr } e^{-\\\\beta \\\\hat{H}}\\\\hat{x}(0)\\\\hat{x}(t)=\\\\text{Tr } \\\\hat{x}(t) e^{-\\\\beta \\\\hat{H}}\\\\hat{x}(0)=\\\\text{Tr } e^{-\\\\beta \\\\hat{H}}\\\\underbrace{e^{\\\\beta \\\\hat{H}}\\\\hat{x}(t) e^{-\\\\beta \\\\hat{H}}}_{\\\\hat{x}(t-i\\\\hbar\\\\beta)}\\\\hat{x}(0)=\\\\langle \\\\hat{x}(t-i\\\\hbar\\\\beta) \\\\hat{x}(0)\\\\rangle where in the second equality we re-positioned \\\\hat{x}(t) using the cyclic property of trace (in this step we have also assumed that the operator \\\\hat{x} is bosonic, i.e. does not introduce a sign change under permutation). Next, in the third equality, we inserted e^{-\\\\beta \\\\hat{H}}e^{\\\\beta \\\\hat{H}} next to the trace and interpreted e^{-\\\\beta\\\\hat{H}} as a time evolution operator e^{-\\\\frac{i}{\\\\hbar}\\\\hat{H}\\\\Delta t} with imaginary time interval \\\\Delta t=-i\\\\hbar\\\\beta. We can then Fourier transform the imaginary part of the response function above to arrive at the quantum fluctuation-dissipation relation :S_{x}(\\\\omega)=2\\\\hbar\\\\left[n_{\\\\rm BE}(\\\\omega)+\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\right]\\\\text{Im}\\\\left[\\\\chi(\\\\omega)\\\\right] where S_{x}(\\\\omega) is the Fourier transform of \\\\langle \\\\hat{x}(t) \\\\hat{x}(0)\\\\rangle and n_{\\\\rm BE}(\\\\omega)=\\\\left(e^{\\\\beta\\\\hbar\\\\omega}-1\\\\right)^{-1} is the Bose- Einstein distribution function. The \\"+1/2\\" term can be thought of as due to quantum fluctuations. At high enough temperatures, n_{\\\\rm BE}\\\\approx (\\\\beta\\\\hbar\\\\omega)^{-1}\\\\gg 1, i.e. the quantum contribution is negligible, and we recover the classical version. Violations in glassy systems While the fluctuation‚Äìdissipation theorem provides a general relation between the response of systems obeying detailed balance, when detailed balance is violated comparison of fluctuations to dissipation is more complex. Below the so called glass temperature T_{\\\\rm g}, glassy systems are not equilibrated, and slowly approach their equilibrium state. This slow approach to equilibrium is synonymous with the violation of detailed balance. Thus these systems require large time-scales to be studied while they slowly move toward equilibrium. To study the violation of the fluctuation-dissipation relation in glassy systems, particularly spin glasses, Ref. performed numerical simulations of macroscopic systems (i.e. large compared to their correlation lengths) described by the three-dimensional Edwards-Anderson model using supercomputers. In their simulations, the system is initially prepared at a high temperature, rapidly cooled to a temperature T=0.64 T_{\\\\rm g} below the glass temperature T_g, and left to equilibrate for a very long time t_{\\\\rm w} under a magnetic field H. Then, at a later time t+t_{\\\\rm w}, two dynamical observables are probed, namely the response function :\\\\chi(t+t_{\\\\rm w},t_{\\\\rm w})\\\\equiv\\\\left.\\\\frac{\\\\partial m(t+t_{\\\\rm w})}{\\\\partial H}\\\\right_{H=0} and the spin-temporal correlation function :C(t+t_{\\\\rm w},t_{\\\\rm w})\\\\equiv \\\\frac{1}{V}\\\\left.\\\\sum_{x}\\\\langle S_x(t_{\\\\rm w}) S_x(t+t_{\\\\rm w})\\\\rangle\\\\right_{H=0} where S_x=\\\\pm 1 is the spin living on the node x of the cubic lattice of volume V, and m(t)\\\\equiv \\\\frac{1}{V}\\\\sum_{x} \\\\langle S_{x}(t)\\\\rangle is the magnetization density. The fluctuation-dissipation relation in this system can be written in terms of these observables as :T\\\\chi(t+t_{\\\\rm w}, t_{\\\\rm w})=1-C(t+t_{\\\\rm w}, t_{\\\\rm w}) Their results confirm the expectation that as the system is left to equilibrate for longer times, the fluctuation-dissipation relation is closer to be satisfied. In the mid-1990s, in the study of dynamics of spin glass models, a generalization of the fluctuation‚Äìdissipation theorem was discovered that holds for asymptotic non-stationary states, where the temperature appearing in the equilibrium relation is substituted by an effective temperature with a non-trivial dependence on the time scales. This relation is proposed to hold in glassy systems beyond the models for which it was initially found.  Quantum version  The R√©nyi entropy as well as von Neumann entropy in quantum physics are not observables since they depend nonlinearly on the density matrix. Recently, Ansari and Nazarov proved an exact correspondence that reveals the physical meaning of the R√©nyi entropy flow in time. This correspondence is similar to the fluctuation-dissipation theorem in spirit and allows the measurement of quantum entropy using the full counting statistics (FCS) of energy transfers.

This included anything disseminated to the SS, SA, Hitler Youth, and the German Labor Front.Hardy (1967), p. 51. The work done by Dietrich helped to secure the Nazis foothold in Germany. He aided party members to acquire positions of power and general acceptance within different communities and helped to spread Nazi ideology to the public.Hardy (1967), pp. 51-52. His job as Press Chief overlapped with Joseph Goebbels's Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda, and thus many anecdotes exist of their feuds. They were infamous for their disagreements, and both often felt obliged to \\"repair\\" the mistakes of the other. Dietrich believed himself to be the supreme commander over the German press and so sought to lessen Goebbels's influence within the Press Department.Hardy (1967), pp. 52-53 Dietrich had a close relationship with Hitler. In some testimony from Hans Fritzsche, the head of the German Press Division from December 1938 to November 1942, who worked under Dietrich, he noted that: \\"For years he (Dietrich) also summarized the press telegrams, which constituted one of the most important sources of information for Hitler. Finally I could see for myself that he elaborated Hitler's speeches for publication. Thus Dr. Dietrich also functioned as the transmitter of Hitler's current directives to Dr. Goebbels.\\"Affidavit of Hans Fritzsche. Document NG-4351, Prosecution Exhibit 867, Document Book 11, Cased No. 11, NWCT. However, in the secrecy mandated by war, Dietrich, who was not in Hitler's \\"inner circle,\\" often did not truly know of Hitler's whereabouts. Dietrich retained the confidence of the F√ºhrer throughout the regime until Hitler accused him of defeatism and placed him on indefinite leave after an argument on 30 March 1945.Gordon (2014), p. 583 After the war ended, he was arrested by the British. In 1949, he was tried at the Subsequent Nuremberg Trials, where he was convicted of crimes against humanity and being a member of a criminal organization, namely the SS, and was sentenced to seven years' imprisonment. He was released in 1950. At the age of 55 Dietrich died in November 1952 in D√ºsseldorf. Memoir: The Hitler I Knew Otto Dietrich is on the far right In captivity in Landsberg Prison, Dietrich wrote The Hitler I Knew. Memoirs of the Third Reich's Press Chief, a book sharply critical of Hitler personally and strongly denouncing the crimes committed in the name of Nazism. The first part of the book contains assessments by Dietrich about his character, his reflections on Hitler as a politician and as a soldier, and his critique of his leadership. The second part (Scenes from Hitler's Life) describes Dietrich's first-hand oberservations of Hitler's daily activities before and during the war. The book was republished in 2010 by Skyhorse Publishing, with a new introduction by historian Roger Moorhouse, who indicates that \\"his (Dietrich) insights are sound and sincere, but the obvious question which arises is: when did they occur to him?\\".

It was roughly based on the history of Greek city- states in the same period. The concept of \\"The Kyklos\\" is first elaborated by Plato, Aristotle, and most extensively Polybius. They all came up with their own interpretation of the cycle, and possible solutions to break the cycle, since they thought the cycle to be harmful. Later writers such as Cicero and Machiavelli commented on the Kyklos.  Plato  Plato describes his version of the Kyklos in his work Republic, Book VIII and IX. He distinguishes 5 forms of government: aristocracy, timocracy, oligarchy, democracy, and tyranny, and writes that governments devolve respectively in this order from aristocracy into tyranny. Plato's cycle of governments is linked with his anthropology of the rulers that come with each form of government. This philosophy is intertwined with the way the cycle of governments plays out. An aristocracy is ruled by aristocratic people whose rule is guided by their rationality. The decline of aristrocracy into timocracy happens when people who are less qualified to rule come to power. Their rule and decision-making is guided by honor. Timocracy devolves into oligarchy as soon as those rulers act in pursuit of wealth; oligarchy devolves into democracy when the rulers act on behalf of freedom; and lastly, democracy devolves into tyranny if rulers mainly seek power. Plato believes that having a philosopher king, and thus having an aristocratic form of government is the most desirable.  Aristotle  Aristotle writes about the cycle of governments in his Politics. He believes the cycle begins with monarchy and ends in anarchy, and that it does not start anew. He also refers to democracy as the degenerate form of rule by the many and calls the virtuous form politeia, which is often translated as constitutional democracy. All the philosophers believed that this cycling was harmful. The transitions would often be accompanied by violence and turmoil, and a good part of the cycle would be spent with the degenerate forms of government. Aristotle gave a number of options as to how the cycle could be halted or slowed: * Even the most minor changes to basic laws and constitutions must be opposed because over time the small changes will add up to a complete transformation. * In aristocracies and democracies the tenure of rulers must be kept very short to prevent them from becoming despots * External threats, real or imagined, preserve internal peace * The three government basic systems can be blended into one, taking the best elements of each * If any one individual gains too much power, be it political, monetary, or military he should be banished from the polis * Judges and magistrates must never accept money to make decisions * The middle class must be large * Most important to Aristotle in preserving a constitution is education: if all the citizens are aware of law, history, and the constitution they will endeavour to maintain a good government.  Polybius  According to Polybius, who has the most fully developed version of the Kyklos, it rotates through the three basic forms of government: democracy, aristocracy, and monarchy, and the three degenerate forms of each of these governments: ochlocracy, oligarchy, and tyranny. Originally society is in ochlocracy but the strongest figure emerges and sets up a monarchy. The monarch's descendants, who lack virtue because of their family's power, become despots and the monarchy degenerates into a tyranny. Because of the excesses of the ruler the tyranny is overthrown by the leading citizens of the state who set up an aristocracy. They too quickly forget about virtue and the state becomes an oligarchy. These oligarchs are overthrown by the people who set up a democracy. Democracy soon becomes corrupt and degenerates into ochlocracy, beginning the cycle anew. Polybius's concept of the cycle of governments is called anacyclosis. Polybius, in contrast to Aristotle, focuses on the idea of mixed government: the idea that the ideal government is one that blends elements of monarchy, aristocracy, and democracy. Aristotle mentions this notion but pays little attention to it. Polybius saw the Roman Republic as the embodiment of this mixed constitution, and this would explain why the Roman Republic was so powerful and why it would remain stable for a longer amount of time. Polybius' description of the anacyclosis can be found in Book VI of his Histories = Cicero = Cicero describes anacyclosis in his philosophical work De re publica. His version of the anacyclosis is heavily inspired by Polybius' writings. Cicero argues, contrary to Polybius, that the Roman state can prevail and will not succumb to the harmful cycle despite its mixed government, as long as the Roman Republic will return to its ancient virtues (mos maiorum). = Machiavelli = Machiavelli, writing during the Renaissance, appears to have adopted Polybius' version of the cycle. Machiavelli's adoption of anacyclosis can be seen in Book I, Chapter II of his Discourses on Livy. Although Machiavelli adopts the idea of the circular structure in which types of governments alternate, he does not accept Polybius' idea that the cycle naturally devolves through the exact same pattern of governments.

He won the 1927 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his research into the bile acids. Career In 1901 Wieland received his doctorate at the University of Munich while studying under Johannes Thiele. In 1904 he completed his habilitation, then continued to teach at the university and starting in 1907 was a consultant for Boehringer Ingelheim. In 1914 he became associate professor for special topics in organic chemistry, and director of the Organic Division of the State Laboratory in Munich. From 1917 to 1918 Wieland worked in the service of the (KWI) Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Physical Chemistry and Elektrochemistry in Dahlem then led by Fritz Haber as an alternative to regular military service. There he was involved in weapons research for instance finding new synthetic routes for mustard gas. He is also credited with the first synthesis of Adamsite. From 1913 to 1921, he was Professor at the Technical University of Munich. He then moved to the University of Freiburg as successor of Ludwig Gattermann (he also assumed responsibility for Gattermanns famous cookbook). In Freiburg he started working on toad poisons and bile acids. In association with Boehringer Ingelheim he worked on synthetic alkaloids such as morphine and strychnine. In 1925 Wieland succeeded Richard Willst√§tter as Chemistry Professor at the University of Munich. In 1941, Wieland isolated the toxin alpha-amanitin, the principal active agent of one of the world's most poisonous mushrooms Amanita phalloides. Wieland tried successfully to protect people, especially Jewish students, who were \\"racially burdened\\" after the Nuremberg Laws. Students who were expelled because they were \\"racially burdened\\" could stay in Heinrich Wieland's group as chemists or as \\"G√§ste des Geheimrats\\" (guests of the privy councillor). Hans Conrad Leipelt, a student of Wieland, was sentenced to death after collecting money for Kurt Huber's widow Clara Huber. Family Heinrich's father, Theodor Wieland (1846‚Äì1928) was a pharmacist with a doctorate in chemistry.

Ed. 2007, 46, 9154‚Äì9179 Heinrich Wieland was a cousin of Helene Boehringer, the wife of Albert Boehringer, who was the founder of Boehringer Ingelheim. From 1915 to the end of 1920, he was advisor at Boehringer Ingelheim and during this time he established the first scientific department of the company. Eva Wieland, Heinrich Wieland's daughter, was married to Feodor Lynen on 14 May 1937. Heinrich Wieland Prize Since 1964, the Heinrich Wieland Prize has been awarded annually. First to promote research on chemistry, biochemistry, physiology and clinical medicine of lipids and related substances, nowadays the prize is awarded for outstanding research on biologically active molecules and systems in the fields of chemistry, biochemistry, and physiology as well as on their clinical importance. The prize is among the most treasured international science awards and has a successful history of over 50 years. The Heinrich Wieland Prize has been sponsored by Boehringer Ingelheim from 2000 to 2010. From 2011, it has been awarded by the Boehringer Ingelheim Foundation. The awardees have always been selected by an independent Board of Trustees. Since 2014, it has been endowed with 100,000 euros.

It was formed in 1932 as Alderson‚ÄìBroaddus College by the union of two Baptist institutions: Alderson Academy (founded 1901) and Broaddus Institute (founded 1871; moved to Philippi, 1909). The school adopted its current name in 2013. Noted for its health science, natural science, education and music programs, the school offers a variety of majors in five academic divisions: Education and Special Programs, Health Sciences, Humanities, Natural Sciences and Social Sciences. It was the first college in West Virginia to offer a four-year degree in nursing and the first in the country to offer a four-year physician assistant degree. History The college's campus in the early 1930s. Alderson Broaddus University derives its name from the merging of two Baptist institutions in 1932. The older of the two, Broaddus Institute, was founded in Winchester, Virginia, in 1871 by Edward Jefferson Willis, a Baptist minister who named the new school after Rev. William Francis Ferguson Broaddus, a prominent Baptist minister at the time of the American Civil War. In response to economic hard times, Broaddus Institute was moved across the Allegheny Mountains to Clarksburg, West Virginia, in 1876. The college was moved again to the small town of Philippi in 1909. In 1917 it became Broaddus College and Academy. The other institution, Alderson Academy, was founded in Alderson, West Virginia, in 1901 by Emma C. Alderson, a committed Baptist laywoman. Designed as a home school, it provided academic work in classics, sciences and normal studies. Originally supported by the Greenbrier Baptist Church, control was assumed by the West Virginia Baptist Association in 1910. As the years passed, Broaddus became a junior college, then a senior college ‚Äî first granting baccalaureate degrees in 1926 ‚Äî and Alderson Academy also added junior college status. Financial hardship in the late 1920s led to a decision to merge the two colleges, which shared common missions and outlooks as Baptist and liberal arts institutions. Since its founding, Alderson Broaddus has been committed to a strong liberal arts education that seeks to imbue students with an appreciation of literature and the arts, Christian faith, music, and the sciences. In more recent times, the college has focused on developing programs in the natural and applied sciences as well. In 1945, Alderson Broaddus developed the first four-year nursing and the first radiologic technology programs in West Virginia. A portion of the physical assets of Storer College, a historically black Baptist college founded 1867 in Harpers Ferry, were transferred to Alderson Broaddus in 1964 and became the ‚ÄúStorer Scholarship‚Äù given annually to African-American students. In 1968, the college pioneered the nation's first four-year physician assistant (PA) program, an innovation that has had significant influence on the development of the PA profession nationwide. From this program emerged in 1991 the college's first graduate degree offering, the Physician Assistant Master's program. In 2011, the college hired Richard Creehan as president. Creehan embarked on a plan to expand the college and the institution has since increased enrollment by over 600 students, expanded the athletic department, and added many new academic programs. In 2013, the college's Board of Governors renamed the institution Alderson Broaddus University.College renamed to Alderson Broaddus University, affective July 1, 2013 That same year, the institution matriculated the largest incoming freshman class in school history. In June 2019, the Higher Learning Commission issued a public notice because it determined that the institution was at risk of becoming out of compliance with the Commission's standards for accreditation in five areas. The Commission will reevaluate the college in 2021 to determine if it meets accreditation standards.https://www.hlcommission.org/download/_PublicDisclosureNotices/20190708%20PDN%20Alderson%20Broaddus%20On%20Notice.pdf Campus The Alderson Stained Glass Window (1910), Burbick Hall, Alderson Broaddus University (Originally: Old Main Building, Alderson Academy and Junior College) The university is located on a campus with approximately 1100 students. The campus occupies a rolling hilltop overlooking the Tygart Valley River and the community of Philippi, with its county courthouse, church spires and the historic Philippi Covered Bridge, used by both Confederate and Union troops during the first land battle of the Civil War. The campus includes seven residence halls, the old Broaddus Hospital, a student center and cafeteria, an arena that houses the basketball, swimming, wrestling, and acrobatics and tumbling programs, tennis courts, a grass field used for intramural sports, a state of the art stadium that houses the football, lacrosse, and soccer teams, six academic buildings, a library, and a chapel. The oldest extant building on the campus, Whitescarver Hall (circa 1911), was named for George M. Whitescarver of Pruntytown, WV. The Classical Revival building was designed by the architectural firm of Holmboe and Lafferty and was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1990. Student life AB maintains a \\"dry campus\\" policy (students may not consume alcohol on site). AB is also home to a big Greek community, with three local fraternities (Sigma Delta Nu, Epsilon Tau Eta Sigma, and Lambda Omega Mu), three local sororities (Lambda Sigma Phi, Phi Kappa Delta, and Zeta Eta Theta), one national sorority (Sigma Alpha Iota), and one national fraternity (Kappa Alpha Psi).http://ab.edu/student-organizations/ =Residence life= The campus has seven different dorms for students to live in. All housing options are co-ed. The seven dorms are: Priestley Hall, Benedum Hall, Kincaid Hall, Battler Hall, and Blue, Gold and University (BGU) Halls. Kincaid, Priestley, Blue and Gold Halls are suite style residence halls, complete with bedrooms, bathrooms, and shared living space. Some of these suites have kitchens. Benedum is a true dorm with community bathrooms. Battler and University rooms are two dorm rooms connected by a bathroom. All dorms have a Residence Director and several Residence Assistants. = Athletics = Known as the \\"Battlers\\" (harkening back to the 1861 Battle of Philippi), Alderson Broaddus is a member of the Great Midwest Athletic Conference (G-MAC) and NCAA Division II. The team's colors are Navy Blue, Gray and Gold, and its mascot is named Skirmish. The university offers 24 sports, 22 at the Varsity level: Football (which became a full varsity program in 2013), Baseball, Softball, Men's and Women's Basketball, Men's and Women's Soccer, Men's and Women's Lacrosse, Men's (club level; to become full varsity in 2015‚Äì16) and Women's Volleyball, Men's and Women's Cross Country, Men's and Women's Track, Men and Women's Golf, Men and Women's Rugby, Men and Women's Swimming, Men's Wrestling, Women's Acrobatics and Tumbling, Women's Tennis and Cheerleading. AB and its predecessor institutions had been members of the West Virginia Intercollegiate Athletic Conference (WVIAC) since that league's formation in 1924. The WVIAC disbanded at the end of the 2012‚Äì13 school year, after the nine WVIAC members that then played football announced they would break away to form a new league that eventually became the Mountain East Conference. Shortly after the announcement of the Mountain East split, AB found a new conference home, accepting an invitation to join the G-MAC in the fall of 2013. AB and three other West Virginia schools‚Äîformer WVIAC members Davis & Elkins and Ohio Valley, plus independent Salem International‚Äîall entered the G-MAC. In 2012 AB started its football program, initially competing at the club level before moving up to Division 2 the following year. Alderson Broaddus originally competed as an independent football team without a conference. In 2016 the G-MAC conference decided to partially make football a competitive sport in the conference with the full competition to start in 2017.The Battlers first defeated Kentucky Wesleyan in the Founders Cup in 2015 to become the first ever G-MAC football Champion. The Battlers became the first G-MAC Conference football champions on 11/12/16 when they defeated Kentucky Wesleyan University 31-28. The G-MAC added another new team to the conference in 2017 of Malone University. Alderson-Broaddus Baseball won the G-MAC conference title for the first time on May 14, 2016 over Trevecca Nazarene 9-6. On June 9th, 2020, Alderson Broaddus announced that they're leaving the Great Midwest Athletic Conference and will join the Mountain East Conference.

S√°ndor had to leave the lyceum which he was attending in Selmecb√°nya (today Bansk√° Bystrica in Slovakia). He held small jobs in various theatres in Pest, worked as a teacher in Ostffyasszonyfa, and spent some months as a soldier in Sopron. After a restless period of travelling, Pet≈ëfi attended college at P√°pa, where he met M√≥r J√≥kai. A year later in 1842, his poem \\"A boroz√≥\\" (The Wine Drinker) was first published in the literary magazine Athenaeum under the name S√°ndor Petrovics. On 3 November the same year, he published the poem under the surname \\"Pet≈ëfi\\" for the first time. Pet≈ëfi was more interested in the theatre. In 1842 he joined a travelling theatre, but had to leave it to earn money. He wrote for a newspaper, but could not make enough money. Malnourished and sick, he went to Debrecen, where his friends helped him get back on his feet. In 1844 he walked from Debrecen to Pest to find a publisher for his poems and he succeeded. His poems were becoming increasingly popular. He relied on folkloric elements and popular, traditional song-like verses. Among his longer works is the epic \\"J√°nos Vit√©z\\" (John the Valiant; 1845). The poem is a fairy-tale notable for its length, 370 quatrains divided into 27 chapters, and for its clever wordplay. It has gained immense popularity in Hungary,It has several musical and film adaptations and is today considered a classic of Hungarian literature. however, Pet≈ëfi felt influenced by his editor, Imre Vahot, to continue writing folklore-style poems, while he wanted to use his Western- oriented education and write about growing revolutionary passions. (The government's censorship would have made such works difficult to publish.) Marriage and family J√∫lia Szendrey, Pet≈ëfi's wife In 1846, he met J√∫lia Szendrey in Transylvania. They married the next year, despite the opposition of her father, and spent their honeymoon at the castle of Count ), the only aristocrat among Pet≈ëfi's friends. Their only son Zolt√°n was born on 15 December 1848.Pet≈ëfi Zolt√°n. 40 felett. Retrieved 15 March 2012. Political career Pet≈ëfi became more possessed by thoughts of a global revolution. He and J√∫lia moved to Pest, where he joined a group of like-minded students and intellectuals who regularly met at . They worked on promoting Hungarian as the language of literature and theatre, formerly based on German.A PESTI MAGYAR SZ√çNH√ÅZ √âP√çT√âSE √âS MEGSZERVEZ√âSE Gy√∂rgy Sz√©kely ‚Äì Ferenc Ker√©nyi (eds.): MAGYAR SZ√çNH√ÅZT√ñRT√âNET 1790‚Äì1873.

Pet≈ëfi's daguerreotype, 1844 The Hungarian Revolution of 1848 Among the various young leaders of the revolution, called M√°rciusi Ifjak (Youths of March), Pet≈ëfi was the key in starting the revolution in Pest. He was co-author and author, respectively, of the two most important written documents: the 12 Pont (12 Points, demands to the Habsburg Governor-General) and the \\"Nemzeti Dal\\", his revolutionary poem. When the news of the revolution in Vienna reached them on the 15th, Pet≈ëfi and his friends decided to change the date of the \\"National Assembly\\" (a rally where a petition to the Hungarian noblemen's assembly would be approved by the people), from 19 March to the 15th. On the morning of the 15th, Pet≈ëfi and the revolutionaries began to march around the city of Pest, reading his poem and the \\"12 Points\\" to the growing crowd, which attracted thousands. Visiting printers, they declared an end to censorship and printed the poem and \\"12 Points\\". Crowds forced the mayor to sign the \\"12 Points\\" and later held a mass demonstration in front of the newly built National Museum, then crossed to Buda on the other bank of the Danube. When the crowd rallied in front of the Imperial governing council, the representatives of Emperor Ferdinand felt they had to sign the \\"12 Points\\". As one of the points was freedom for political prisoners, the crowd moved to greet the newly freed revolutionary poet Mih√°ly T√°ncsics. Pet≈ëfi's popularity waned as the memory of the glorious day faded, and the revolution went the way of high politics: to the leadership of the nobles. Those in the noblemen's Assembly in Pozsony, (today Bratislava) had been pushing for slower reforms at the same time, which they delivered to the Emperor on the 13th, but events had overtaken them briefly. Pet≈ëfi disagreed with the Assembly, and criticised their view of the goals and methods of the Revolution. (His colleague T√°ncsics was imprisoned again by the new government.) In the general election, Pet≈ëfi ran in his native area, but did not win a seat. At this time, he wrote his most serious poem, Az Apostol (The Apostle). It was an epic about a fictional revolutionary who, after much suffering, attempts, but fails, to assassinate a fictitious king. Pet≈ëfi joined the Hungarian Revolutionary Army and fought under the Polish Liberal General J√≥zef Bem, in the Transylvanian army. The army was initially successful against Habsburg troops, but after Tsar Nicholas I of Russia intervened to support the Habsburgs, they were defeated. Pet≈ëfi was last seen alive in the Battle of Segesv√°r on 31 July 1849. Death Pet≈ëfi is believed to have been killed in action during the battle of Segesv√°r by the Imperial Russian Army. A Russian military doctor recorded an account of Pet≈ëfi's death in his diary. As his body was never officially found, rumours of Pet≈ëfi's survival persisted. In his autobiographical roman a clef Political Fashions (Politikai divatok, 1862), M√≥r J√≥kai imagined his late friend's \\"resurrection\\". In the novel Pet≈ëfi (the character named Pusztafi) returns ten years later as a shabby, d√©class√© figure who has lost his faith in everything, including poetry. Although for many years his death at Segesv√°r had been assumed, in the late 1980s Soviet investigators found archives that revealed that after the battle about 1,800 Hungarian prisoners of war were marched to Siberia. Alternative theories suggest that he was one of them and died of tuberculosis in 1856.Sandor Petofi (Hungarian poet) ‚Äì Britannica Online Encyclopedia. Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. Retrieved 17 October 2011. In 1990, an expedition was organised to Barguzin, Buryatia, Siberia, where archaeologists claimed to have unearthed Pet≈ëfi's skeleton. Furthermore, in Hungary they have a saying after him: \\"Elt≈±nt, mint Pet≈ëfi a k√∂dben\\" (Disappeared, like Pet≈ëfi in the fog).  Poetry  Pet≈ëfi started his career as a poet with \\"popular situation songs\\", a genre to which his first published poem, A boroz√≥ (\\"The Wine Drinker\\", 1842), belongs. It is the song of a drinker praising the healing power of wine to drive away all troubles. This kind of pseudo-folk song was not unusual in Hungarian poetry of the 1840s, but Pet≈ëfi soon developed an original and fresh voice which made him stand out. He wrote many folk song-like poems on the subjects of wine, love, romantic robbers etc. Many of these early poems have become classics, for example the love poem A vir√°gnak megtiltani nem lehet (\\"You Cannot Forbid the Flower\\", 1843), or Befordultam a konyh√°ra (\\"I Turned into the Kitchen\\", 1843) which uses the ancient metaphor of love and fire in a playful and somewhat provocative way. The influence of folk poetry and 19th-century populism is very significant in Pet≈ëfi's work, but other influences are also present: Pet≈ëfi drew on sources such as topoi of contemporary almanac-poetry in an inventive way, and was familiar with the works of major literary figures of his day, including Percy Bysshe Shelley, Pierre-Jean de B√©ranger and Heinrich Heine. Pet≈ëfi's early poetry was often interpreted as some kind of role-playing, due to the broad range of situations and voices he created and used. Recent interpretations however call attention to the fact that in some sense all lyrical poetry can be understood as role-playing, which makes the category of \\"role-poems\\" (coined especially for Pet≈ëfi) superfluous. While using a variety of voices, Pet≈ëfi created a well-formed persona for himself: a jaunty, stubborn loner who loves wine, hates all kinds of limits and boundaries and is passionate in all he feels. In poems such as J√∂vend√∂l√©s (\\"Prophecy\\", 1843) he imagines himself as someone who will die young after doing great things. This motif recurs in the revolutionary poetry of his later years. The influence of contemporary almanac-poetry can be best seen in the poem cycle Cipruslombok Etelke s√≠rj√°ra (\\"Branches of Cypress for Etelke's Tomb\\", 1845). These sentimental poems, which are about death, grief, love, memory and loneliness were written after a love interest of Pet≈ëfi's, Etelke Csap√≥, died. In the years 1844‚Äì45 Pet≈ëfi's poetry became more and more subtle and mature. New subjects appeared, such as landscape. His most influential landscape poem is Az Alf√∂ld (\\"The Plains\\"), in which he says that his homeland, the Hungarian plains are more beautiful and much dearer than the Carpathian mountains; it was to become the foundation of a long-lived fashion: that of the plains as the typical Hungarian landscape. Pet≈ëfi's poetic skills solidified and broadened. He became a master of using different kinds of voices, for example his poem A r√©gi, j√≥ Gvad√°nyi (\\"The Good Old Gvad√°nyi\\") imitates the style of , a Hungarian poet who lived at the end of the 18th century. Pet≈ëfi maintained a lifelong friendship with J√°nos Arany, another significant poet of the time. Arany was the godfather of Pet≈ëfi's son .  Honours and memorials  Pet≈ëfi statue in Budapest After the Revolution was crushed, Pet≈ëfi's writing became immensely popular, while his rebelliousness served as a role model ever since for Hungarian revolutionaries and would-be revolutionaries of every political colour. Hungarian composer and contemporary Franz Liszt composed the piano piece Dem Andenken Pet≈ëfis (In Pet≈ëfi's Memory) in his honour. Liszt has also set several of Pet≈ëfi's poems to music. In 1911, a statue of S√°ndor Pet≈ëfi was erected in Pressburg (Pozsony, present-day Bratislava), on the Main Square. In 1918, after the army of the newly independent First Czechoslovak Republic occupied the city, the statue was dynamited.Ferenc Keszeli, \\"Pozsony... Anno...

During the late 1940s, Boris Pasternak produced acclaimed translations of Pet≈ëfi's poems into the Russian language. Today, schools, streets and squares are named after him throughout Hungary and Hungarian-speaking regions of neighbouring states; in Budapest alone, there are 11 Pet≈ëfi streets and 4 Pet≈ëfi squares, see: Public place names of Budapest. A national radio station (Radio Pet≈ëfi), a bridge in Budapest and a street in Sofia, Bulgaria also bear his name, as well as the asteroid 4483 Pet√∂fi, a member of the Hungaria family. Every Hungarian primary school child learns some of his poems by heart . The Hungarian 10 Forint banknote valid between 1947 and 1992 depicted S√°ndor Pet≈ëfi on the obverse.

It consists of a pre-prep (ages 4-7), Junior School (ages 7‚Äì11), Senior School (ages 11‚Äì16) and sixth form. A pre-preparatory department for children aged 4‚Äì7 was constructed starting for the 2013‚Äì14 academic year. The school is situated in 100 acres of land between Epping Forest and Hainault Forest, ten miles from London. It is a member of the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) and the Junior School is a member of the Independent Association of Prep Schools (IAPS). The school motto is aut viam inveniam aut faciam, a Latin phrase which translates literally as Either I shall find a way or I will make one\\". There are four day houses, named Caswalls', Lambourne, Penn's, and Swallow's after alumni. The school owns several artifacts which belonged to each of the alumni after which the houses are named. The boarding houses are Church House, Harsnett's, Sandon Lodge, and Hainault House, although all boarders are members of one of the day houses. In the Junior School there are another four houses, named Windsors, Hanovers, Stuarts, and Tudors.  History  Chigwell School dates back to 1619 when a schoolhouse was erected on the site. The first headmaster Peter Mease was appointed in 1623. It was formally founded in 1629 by Samuel Harsnett, Archbishop of York and Vice-Chancellor of Cambridge University, and began with 16 \\"poor, clever\\" scholars. In 1868, the school was split into two sections. The English section for local children studying arithmetic, reading and writing was housed in a building behind the King's Head public house, which was mentioned in Charles Dickens' novel Barnaby Rudge: A Tale of the Riots of 'Eighty. The Latin section (for Latin scholars only) remained in the original building. Rather unusually for a boys' school at that time, in 1873, it started a bursary programme for girls to attend other schools. Following a trend set by many HMC schools (which were mainly all-boys), the sixth form section became coeducational and its first girls were admitted in the summer term of 1974. In 1997 coeducation was extended to the rest of the school. =Chapel= Chigwell School Chapel -Pilgrim's Progress The War Memorial Chapel was dedicated by the Bishop of Chelmsford on 10 October 1924 to the 78 Old Boys and one Master who had lain down their lives in the Great War and on each side of the altar, plaques record the names of the dead.

The group was committed to restoring primitive Christianity. It merged with the Christians (Stone Movement) in 1832 to form what is now described as the American Restoration Movement (also known as the Stone-Campbell Restoration Movement). Other prominent individuals in the Restoration Movement included Barton W. Stone, Walter Scott and \\"Raccoon\\" John Smith. Historically associated groups Over time, strains grew within the Restoration Movement. In 1906, the U.S. Religious Census listed the Christian Churches and the Churches of Christ as separate and distinct groups for the first time.McAlister, Lester G. and Tucker, William E. (1975), Journey in Faith: A History of the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ) - St. Louis, Chalice Press, This, however, was simply the recognition of a division that had been growing for years, with published reports as early as 1883. The most obvious distinction between the two groups was the rejection of musical instruments in the Churches of Christ. The controversy over musical instruments began in 1860 with the introduction of organs in some churches. More basic were differences in the underlying approach to Biblical interpretation. For the Churches of Christ, any practices not present in accounts of New Testament worship were not permissible in the church, and they could find no New Testament documentation of the use of instrumental music in worship. For the Christian Churches, any practices not expressly forbidden could be considered.

Terminology The word \\"latrine\\" is derived from the Latin lavatrina, meaning bath. Today it is commonly used in the term \\"pit latrine\\". It has the connotation of something being less advanced and less hygienic than a standard toilet. It is typically used to describe communal facilities, such as the shallow-trench latrines used in emergency sanitation situations, e.g. after an earthquake, flood or other natural disaster.  Types  Latrines of Krak des Chevaliers in Syria Many forms of latrine technology have been used, from very simple to more complex. The more sophisticated the system, the more likely that the term \\"toilet\\" is used instead of \\"latrine\\". = Pit latrine = A pit latrine is a simple and inexpensive toilet, minimally defined as a hole (pit) in the ground. More sophisticated pit latrines may include a floor plate, or ventilation to reduce odor and fly and mosquito breeding (called ventilated improved pit latrine or \\"VIP latrine\\").Tilley, E., Ulrich, L., L√ºthi, C., Reymond, Ph. and Zurbr√ºgg, C. (2014). Compendium of Sanitation Systems and Technologies (2nd Revised Edition). Swiss Federal Institute of Aquatic Science and Technology (Eawag), Duebendorf, Switzerland Many military units, if intended for extended use, place basic shelters and seating over the pits. A pit is typically sited well away from any water sources to minimize possible contamination. After prolonged use, a pit is typically buried. Other types of pit latrines may include the Reed Odourless Earth Closet, the arborloo or treebog (very simple types of composting toilet), or the twin pit pour-flush pit latrine, popularized by Sulabh International. The shelter that covers such a pit latrine is known in some varieties of English as an outhouse. = Trench latrine = In a location without longer term sanitation infrastructure, such as for emergency sanitation, a trench latrine is a workable solution. It typically consists of a pit or a trench in the ground, to deep and to long. Slit-trench latrine A slit-trench latrine consists of a relatively shallow trench which is narrow enough to stand with one leg on either side (see defecation postures). This type is used either by squatting, with the users' legs straddling the pit, or by various arrangements for sitting or leaning against a support structure. Such support may be simply a log, plank, branch or similar arrangement placed at right angles to the long axis of the pit. This type of latrine is not commonly found in developing countries but can be used for emergency sanitation. Shallow-trench latrine The shallow-trench latrine is similar to the slit-trench latrine but is wider (200-300mm wide) than the latter. It is also shallow, with a depth of about 150 mm. This type of latrine is often used in the initial phases of emergencies and is a simple improvement on open defecation fields. A rule of thumb in emergency sanitation provision is to allow 0.25 m2 of land per person per day. This means 2,500m2 per 10,000 people per day, or nearly two hectares per week. Men's and women's areas should always be separated. = Aqua privy = An aqua privy is essentially a small septic tank located directly below a dry toilet squatting pan or bowl which has a drop pipe extending below the liquid level in the tank to form a simple water seal to minimise odors. =Most basic= Campers refer to a cathole ‚Äì a one-use, shallow scrape.

The opposite of strophic form, with new music written for every stanza, is called through-composed. The term is derived from the Greek word , strophƒì, meaning \\"turn\\". It is the simplest and most durable of musical forms, extending a piece of music by repetition of a single formal section. This may be analyzed as \\"A A A...\\". This additive method is the musical analogue of repeated stanzas in poetry or lyrics and, in fact, where the text repeats the same rhyme scheme from one stanza to the next, the song's structure also often uses either the same or very similar material from one stanza to the next. A modified strophic form varies the pattern in some stanzas (A A' A\\"...) somewhat like a rudimentary theme and variations. Contrasting verse-chorus form is a binary form that alternates between two sections of music (ABAB), although this may also be interpreted as constituting a larger strophic verse- refrain form. While the terms 'refrain' and 'chorus' are often used interchangeably, 'refrain' may indicate a recurring line of identical melody and lyrics as a part of the verse (as in Blowing In The Wind: \\"...the answer my friend...\\"), while 'chorus' means an independent form section (as in Yellow Submarine: \\"We all live in...\\").cf. von Appen/Frei-Hauenschild 2015.

Many classical art songs are also composed in strophic form, from the 17th century French air de cour to 19th century German lieder and beyond. Haydn used the strophic variation form in many of his string quartets and a few of his symphonies, employed almost always in the slow second movement. Franz Schubert composed many important strophic lieder, including settings of both narrative poems and simpler, folk-like texts, such as his \\"Heidenr√∂slein\\" and \\"Der Fischer\\".

They have released four albums and two live mini-albums, and had a top ten hit with \\"Nothing\\" in 2002. Shortly after releasing their fourth album, Teen Dance Ordinance, in 2005, the band briefly split. In 2007 A reunited for a one-off gig, and have been touring sporadically ever since, most recently playing the main stage at 2000 Trees 2019. They have yet to release an album since 2005. History = Formation, How Ace Are Buildings and A vs. Monkey Kong (1993‚Äì2000) = The band began in Suffolk in the early 90s as Grand Designs, named after the song by Rush. The founder members were twins Jason and Adam Perry and their friend Mark Chapman, with bassist Stevie Swindon and the twins' younger brother Giles Perry. They cited Rush, the Beach Boys, Van Halen and the Beastie Boys among their influences. After changing their name to A in 1993, and abandoning their early progressive rock-inspired sound for a more punk rock style, they signed a European recording contract with Warner Bros. Records UK in 1996 and released their debut LP How Ace Are Buildings in 1997. Also in 1997, the band briefly appeared in the music video for \\"Anthem\\" by the Wildhearts. A found a healthy underground reception and even had a couple of low-charting singles in the UK. Although A achieved some recognition with How Ace Are Buildings, bassist Stevie Swindon left the band. He was replaced by bassist and future BBC Radio 1 Rock Show DJ Daniel P Carter. Swindon went on to become a member of Flotation Toy Warning and established the award-winning community arts charity, TAPE Community Music and Film in 2008. A licensing agreement for the American music market was reached with the North Carolina-based Mammoth Records. Future releases would be distributed in the U.S. and Canada by Mammoth. A's second album A vs. Monkey Kong followed in 1999. The band then toured the world and enjoyed a small degree of success worldwide, especially in Germany. They released a live album, Exit Stage Right in 2000. =Hi-Fi Serious and commercial success (2002) = Hi-Fi Serious was their third album, released in 2002. It was preceded by their biggest single \\"Nothing\\", which became the band's first and only top ten hit when it reached number 9 in the UK singles chart. \\"Nothing\\" was followed by top 20 hit \\"Starbucks\\", named after the coffee chain. The tour following Hi-Fi Serious saw the band playing their largest venues to date, headlining the 5,000 capacity Brixton Academy as part of their Inner-City Sumo Tour. At the end of the year they won the Kerrang! award for Best British Band. In 2004, their single \\"Nothing\\" appeared on Beyblade's Let It Rip! official soundtrack. In 2007, \\"Something's Going On\\" and \\"The Distance\\" appeared on the Surf's Up video game soundtrack. =Teen Dance Ordinance and hiatus (2005) = Teen Dance Ordinance fan made promotional poster A released their fourth album, Teen Dance Ordinance (TDO), on 27 June 2005. The album had been recorded two years earlier, but was heavily delayed due to Jason Perry's illness and disputes with the record company. It featured a more straight rock sound and displayed an almost complete absence of the keyboards and sampling that marked the early sound of the band. Unlike their last two albums, Teen Dance Ordinance was not released in the US. Hollywood Records agreed early on to release it in the US, but ultimately did not. Following the release of Teen Dance Ordinance in 2005, the band worked on other projects. Jason Perry spent time writing, recording, and touring with Matt Willis, formerly of Busted, and has now become a successful producer, working with the likes of the Blackout, Kids in Glass Houses, and McFly. Adam Perry and Daniel P Carter briefly became full-time members of the Bloodhound Gang: Perry replaced drummer Willie the New Guy in 2005, and Carter replaced guitarist Lupus Thunder in 2009. Carter continued writing material with Jason Perry and artists such as McFly, as well as playing bass in Matt Willis' band for his first album. He also plays guitar and lead vocals in hardcore punk band, Hexes. He has hosted BBC Radio 1's Rock Show since 25 September 2006. Mark Chapman went into teaching, and has played in the bands Malpractice, alongside drum'n'bass producer Adam F, and 'MiLLS,' fronted by former Cable drummer Richie Mills. Giles Perry went on work for the BBC, and has also produced videos for Hundred Reasons and Biffy Clyro. =Reunion (2007‚Äì2008) = When questioned at the Download Festival in 2007, Daniel Carter said the band would be reuniting for a \\"few shows\\" at the end of the year. In a 2008 interview, Jason Perry explained the hiatus and expressed how much he had enjoyed being in the band, reiterating the desire to record and tour again in the future. In August 2008, Adam Perry revealed six tour dates supporting the Wildhearts on the band's forum, noting that: \\"This is going to be wicked and we are grateful to the Wildhearts for dragging us from our retirement! Plus there are now big plans afoot to start the new record for next year.\\" Bassist Daniel P Carter did not return to the band, however, and was replaced by John Mitchell, frontman of It Bites and producer of bands including Enter Shikari and Hexes. John Mitchell played his first show with the band on 3 December 2008 at the Sheffield Carling Academy supporting the Wildhearts. = Later work (2009 ‚Äì present) = A played a 10-date UK tour in December 2009, supported by This City. On 13 May 2010, Bowling For Soup singer Jaret Reddick announced A as support band for their Autumn tour. A then announced on their own Twitter on 26 May 2010 that Daniel P. Carter would be returning to the band for this tour. On 20 June 2011, A announced via their Twitter feed that they would be heading into the studio to record some new tracks. No further details have been released. Later that year, Perry and Carter were credited as co-writers of the Subways song \\"I Wanna Dance With You\\" from the album Money & Celebrity. A played a one-off show at the Kasbah nightclub in Coventry on 1 December 2012. In June 2015, they played warm-up concerts in St Albans and Royal Tunbridge Wells before headlining the 4th stage at that year's Download Festival. Andrew \\"Shay\\" Sheehy, formerly of Kids in Glass Houses, made his first appearance with A at these shows when he joined as bass player. In February 2018, A embarked on an 8 date UK tour in support of Hell Is for Heroes, joined by new bassist Dougie Poynter. In November, the band went on a 9 date tour playing the album Hi-Fi Serious in full, with support from Wheatus and InMe. In November 2019, the band played eight dates in the UK playing the album A vs. Monkey Kong in full. Support was provided by '68 and False-Heads.

System identification also includes the optimal design of experiments for efficiently generating informative data for fitting such models as well as model reduction. A common approach is to start from measurements of the behavior of the system and the external influences (inputs to the system) and try to determine a mathematical relation between them without going into many details of what is actually happening inside the system; this approach is called system identification.  Overview  A dynamical mathematical model in this context is a mathematical description of the dynamic behavior of a system or process in either the time or frequency domain. Examples include: * physical processes such as the movement of a falling body under the influence of gravity; * economic processes such as stock markets that react to external influences. One of the many possible applications of system identification is in control systems. For example, it is the basis for modern data-driven control systems, in which concepts of system identification are integrated into the controller design, and lay the foundations for formal controller optimality proofs. =Input-output vs output-only= System identification techniques can utilize both input and output data (e.g. eigensystem realization algorithm) or can include only the output data (e.g. frequency domain decomposition). Typically an input-output technique would be more accurate, but the input data is not always available. =Optimal design of experiments= The quality of system identification depends on the quality of the inputs, which are under the control of the systems engineer. Therefore, systems engineers have long used the principles of the design of experiments.Spall, J. C. (2010), ‚ÄúFactorial Design for Efficient Experimentation: Generating Informative Data for System Identification,‚Äù IEEE Control Systems Magazine, vol. 30(5), pp. 38‚Äì53. https://doi.org/10.1109/MCS.2010.937677 In recent decades, engineers have increasingly used the theory of optimal experimental design to specify inputs that yield maximally precise estimators. White- and black-box One could build a so-called white-box model based on first principles, e.g. a model for a physical process from the Newton equations, but in many cases such models will be overly complex and possibly even impossible to obtain in reasonable time due to the complex nature of many systems and processes. A much more common approach is therefore to start from measurements of the behavior of the system and the external influences (inputs to the system) and try to determine a mathematical relation between them without going into the details of what is actually happening inside the system. This approach is called system identification. Two types of models are common in the field of system identification: * grey box model: although the peculiarities of what is going on inside the system are not entirely known, a certain model based on both insight into the system and experimental data is constructed. This model does however still have a number of unknown free parameters which can be estimated using system identification. One example uses the Monod saturation model for microbial growth. The model contains a simple hyperbolic relationship between substrate concentration and growth rate, but this can be justified by molecules binding to a substrate without going into detail on the types of molecules or types of binding. Grey box modeling is also known as semi- physical modeling. * black box model: No prior model is available. Most system identification algorithms are of this type. In the context of nonlinear system identification Jin et al. describe greybox modeling by assuming a model structure a priori and then estimating the model parameters. Parameter estimation is relatively easy if the model form is known but this is rarely the case. Alternatively the structure or model terms for both linear and highly complex nonlinear models can be identified using NARMAX methods. This approach is completely flexible and can be used with grey box models where the algorithms are primed with the known terms, or with completely black box models where the model terms are selected as part of the identification procedure. Another advantage of this approach is that the algorithms will just select linear terms if the system under study is linear, and nonlinear terms if the system is nonlinear, which allows a great deal of flexibility in the identification.  Identification for control  In control systems applications, the objective of engineers is to obtain a good performance of the closed-loop system, which is the one comprising the physical system, the feedback loop and the controller. This performance is typically achieved by designing the control law relying on a model of the system, which needs to be identified starting from experimental data. If the model identification procedure is aimed at control purposes, what really matters is not to obtain the best possible model that fits the data, as in the classical system identification approach, but to obtain a model satisfying enough for the closed-loop performance. This more recent approach is called identification for control, or I4C in short. The idea behind I4C can be better understood by considering the following simple example. Consider a system with true transfer function G_0(s): :G_0(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s+1} and an identified model \\\\hat{G}(s): :\\\\hat{G}(s) = \\\\frac{1}{s}. From a classical system identification perspective, \\\\hat{G}(s) is not, in general, a good model for G_0(s). In fact, modulus and phase of \\\\hat{G}(s) are different from those of G_0(s) at low frequency. What is more, while G_0(s) is an asymptotically stable system, \\\\hat{G}(s) is a simply stable system. However, \\\\hat{G}(s) may still be a model good enough for control purposes. In fact, if one wants to apply a purely proportional negative feedback controller with high gain K, the closed-loop transfer function from the reference to the output is, for G_0(s) :\\\\frac{KG_0(s)}{1+KG_0(s)} = \\\\frac{K}{s+1+K} and for \\\\hat{G}(s) :\\\\frac{K\\\\hat{G}(s)}{1+K\\\\hat{G}(s)} = \\\\frac{K}{s+K}. Since K is very large, one has that 1+K \\\\approx K. Thus, the two closed-loop transfer functions are indistinguishable. In conclusion, \\\\hat{G}(s) is a perfectly acceptable identified model for the true system if such feedback control law has to be applied. Whether or not a model is appropriate for control design depends not only on the plant/model mismatch, but also on the controller that will be implemented. As such, in the I4C framework, given a control performance objective, the control engineer has to design the identification phase in such a way that the performance achieved by the model-based controller on the true system is as high as possible. Sometimes, it is even convenient to design a controller without explicitly identifying a model of the system, but directly working on experimental data. This is the case of direct data-driven control systems.  Forward model  A common understanding in Artificial Intelligence is that the controller has to generate the next move for a robot. For example, the robot starts in the maze and then the robots decides to move forward. Model predictive control determines the next action indirectly. The term ‚Äúmodel‚Äù is referencing to a forward model which doesn't provide the correct action but simulates a scenario. A forward model is equal to a physics engine used in game programming. The model takes an input and calculates the future state of the system. The reason why dedicated forward models are constructed, is because it allows to divide the overall control process. The first question is, how to predict future states of the system. That means, to simulate a plant over a timespan for different input values. And the second task is, to search for a sequence of input values which brings the plant into a goal state. This is called predictive control. The forward model is the most important aspect of a MPC-controller. It has to be created before the solver can be realized. If it's unclear, what the behavior of a system is, it's not possible to search for meaningful actions. The workflow for creating a forward model is called system identification. The idea is, to formalize a system in a set of equations which will behave like the original system. The error between the real system and the forward model can be measured. There are many techniques available to create a forward model: ordinary differential equations is the classical one which is used in physics engines like Box2d. A more recent technique is a neural network for creating the forward model.

History Before the Spanish arrived, this territory was inhabited by Chorotega Indians from the towns of Zapati, Nacaome, Paro, Cangel, Nicopasaya, Pocos√≠, Diri√°, Papagayo, Namiap√≠ and Oros√≠. The Corobicies lived on the eastern shore of the Gulf of Nicoya and the Nahuas or Aztecan in the zone of Bagaces. The first church was built out of grass in Nicoya in the 17th century. In the 18th century some neighbors of Rivas established their houses and cattle farms in the northern part of the Nicoya Peninsula at crossroads that connected the towns of Bagaces, Nicoya and Rivas. The place was baptized after a famous Guanacaste tree that grows in the neighborhood. After a plebiscite in 1824-25, the territory of Guanacaste was annexed to Costa Rica. In 1836 the town of Guanacaste was declared the capital of the Guanacaste province. In 1854 the town of Guanacaste was renamed Liberia. In 2013, Nicaraguan president Daniel Ortega claimed Guanacaste province belonged to Nicaragua. Taking over Guanacaste would greatly increase the continental shelf area available to Nicaragua for oil exploration concessions, and move the Nicaraguan border to within of Costa Rican capital San Jos√©. Geography A beach in the Guanacaste Province. Typical headdress of Costa Rican oxen The province is bounded on the east by a group of green-swathed volcanoes forming the Cordillera de Guanacaste (which features Orosi, Rinc√≥n de la Vieja, Miravalles and Tenorio volcanoes) and the Cordillera de Tilar√°n. The rivers that tumble out of these steep mountains flow down to rolling flatlands, forming a vast alluvial plain drained by the Rio Tempisque, which empties through swampy wetlands into de Golfo de Nicoya. The Rio Tempisque defines one side of the horsehead-shaped Pen√≠nsula de Nicoya enclosing the gulf to the west. =Climate= Guanacaste's climate and culture are unique among Costa Rican provinces. The province experiences little rain and consistent heat from November to April, resulting in ubiquitous tropical dry forests as a natural adaption to the dry season conditions. Tourists seek out this dry heat during the North American winter to enjoy the Guanacastecan beaches. Irrigation of the agricultural land is necessary during the long dry period. From May to October, the climate is similar to that of San Jos√©, consisting of showers daily and moderate temperatures. Guanacaste is, however, considerably warmer than other provinces in the country located in higher elevations. Tourism Tourism spreads across Guanacaste's and more than of coast line. Main attractions of tourists include water, land, mountains, volcanos, and coastal ecosystems. The two main commercial areas Santa Cruz and Liberia with six surrounding tourism development centers: Papagayo Peninsula, El Coco, Las Catalinas, Flamingo, Conchal, and Tamarindo. Liberia is central to the six locations and is complete with an airport. Animal rehab center, Centro de Rescate Las Pumas, is located in the heart of Area de Conservaci√≥n Guanacaste World Heritage Site. The Guanacaste province is home to the bulk of Costa Rica's all-inclusive resorts. Demography Most of the population descends from a mix of Chorotega natives and Spaniards, with a significant African admixture as a result of a large number of slaves working the land during the colonial period. As in Nicaragua and elsewhere in Costa Rica, Usted is the form of address used by Guanacastecans upon initial meetings and typically among adults. The vos verb-form is used mainly when adults address children, especially their own, and occasionally between adults who are family members or good friends. The Chorotega culture and the Spanish culture have successfully integrated; among the main cultural elements are their music, literature (folklore), musical instruments, bullfighting, and religious events. Typical Costa Rican ox-drawn carts carry wood during an annual festival in Nicoya, Guanacaste. Economy The province has an economic and cultural heritage based on beef cattle ranching. Most of the area is covered by small patches of forest, scattered trees and large pastures of coarse grasses where Brahman cattle and related breeds graze. Historically, the main source of income of Guanacaste was cattle ranching. Cattle ranching is declining in Guanacaste due to an international drop in the demand for beef. Many pastures are naturally reverting to dry forest or are being converted to tree plantations. The other agricultural products of relative importance in the province are sugar cane and cotton, and since the late 1980s, with the creation of a large-scale irrigation program (the water comes from Lake Arenal after passing through several power generating stations), rice has become a prominent crop. Since the late 20th century, tourism has emerged as the new and growing activity in the local economy. The combination of beaches like Playas del Coco, Playa Tamarindo, and the sunny dry season that coincides with the winter months in northern latitudes have made tourism a key economic activity. A lot of tourists are also attracted by the Province's seven national parks. These include the Santa Rosa, Guanacaste and Rincon de la Vieja National Parks. Political divisions Guanacaste is subdivided into eleven cantons. The cantons (with their capitals in parentheses) are: # Liberia (Liberia) # Nicoya (Nicoya) # Santa Cruz (Santa Cruz) # Bagaces (Bagaces) # Carrillo (Filadelfia) # Ca√±as (Ca√±as) # Abangares (Las Juntas) # Tilar√°n (Tilar√°n) # Nandayure (Carmona) # La Cruz (La Cruz) # Hojancha (Hojancha) A major portion of the peninsula of Nicoya is now under the jurisdiction of the province of Puntarenas. This may change in the future, as there is constant debate over the remapping of the area.

He is the author of Phoronomia, an early treatise on Mechanics in Latin, which has been translated by Ian Bruce in 2015-16. In 1729, he proclaimed that it was as easy to graph a locus on the polar coordinate system as it was to graph it on the Cartesian coordinate system. He appears to have been the first to show that the Laplace‚ÄìRunge‚ÄìLenz vector is a constant of motion for particles acted upon by an inverse-square central force. Hermann was born and died in Basel. He received his mathematical training from Jacob Bernoulli at the University of Basel and graduated with a degree in 1695. In 1696, he obtained a Master's Degree by defending a dissertation on infinite series. Jacob Bernoulli considered Hermann to be the best of his many students at the university and when Jacob Bernoulli died in 1705, Gottfried Leibniz asked Hermann to write an obituary for Bernoulli in Acta Eruditorum. He became a member of the Berlin Academy in 1701. He was appointed to a chair in mathematics in Padua in 1707, but moved to Frankfurt an der Oder in 1713, and thence to St. Petersburg in 1724. Finally, he returned to Basel in 1731 to take a chair in ethics and natural law. Hermann was elected to the Acad√©mie Royale des Sciences (Paris) in 1733, the year of his death. Hermann was a second cousin of Leonhard Euler's mother.

The station acted as a terminus of the Central line, with passengers transferring to a steam shuttle onwards towards Epping, where the LNER still had local freight services running between Epping and Loughton, and continued to Stratford (Liverpool Street on Sundays) until 5 October 1970. The extension was delayed by World War II and electric services commenced as far as Loughton (and around the 'loop' to Hainault) on 21 November 1948. As part of the electrification carried out for the transfer to the LPTB the original level crossing at the station, where Snakes Lane crossed the line, was closed and a bridge, to the south, was constructed. The original goods yard, which was closed in the late 1960s, now forms the car park.

He tried many forms of exercise initially, using weights, pulley-style resistance, and gymnastic-style calisthenics. Atlas claimed that they did not build his body. He was inspired by other fitness and health advocates who preceded him, including world-renowned strongman Eugen Sandow and Bernarr MacFadden (a major proponent of \\"Physical Culture\\"). He was too poor to join the local YMCA, so he watched how exercises were performed, then performed them at home. He attended the strongman shows at Coney Island, and would question the strongmen about their diets and exercise regimens after the show. He would read Physical Culture magazine for further information on health, strength, and physical development, and finally developed his own system of exercises which was later called 'Dynamic Tension', a phrase coined by Charles Roman.

In the illustration, Van Damme harasses a scrawny Schwarzenegger, claiming that Hard Target, unlike Schwarzenegger's movie, was well-received by both audiences and critics. Instead of ordering Atlas's program, Schwarzenegger calls his agent and orders Last Action Hero to be released on video immediately. Schwarzenegger, now with a film doing well as a video rental (despite its theatrical failure), returns to the beach and punches Van Damme out. = Comics = *In an issue of the DC Comics title Mystery in Space, the main character, Comet, referring to an army of super- powered clones, says, \\"Physically those clones may make me look like a 98-pound-weakling, but psychically I'm the Charles Atlas of this beach.\\" *The January 1974 issue of the satiric magazine National Lampoon was dedicated to animals: Pets, circus, wild beasts, evolution, law, etc. A fake advertisement in the article 'Popular Evolution', a parody of the magazine Popular Mechanics, presents in the three-stage comic strip manner a Charles Atlas- style commercial. A little skinny mouse suffers the humiliation of being kicked at the beach by a bully, some sort or medium-size carnivore. Little mouse, goes home, kicks a chair, fills the form and sends it to Mr. Charles Darwin, Galapagos Islands. \\"After a few millions years of evolutionary exercise\\" little mouse has developed fangs, and ugly scary face, wings, amongst other attributes; goes back to the beach, bites the bully predator in the neck, Count Dracula style and is declared the \\"heroe of the habitat\\" by the admiring females.

C. Wyeth, was an American artist and illustrator. He was the pupil of artist Howard Pyle and became one of America's greatest illustrators. During his lifetime, Wyeth created more than 3,000 paintings and illustrated 112 books, 25 of them for Scribner's, the Scribner Classics, which is the work for which he is best known. The first of these, Treasure Island, was one of his masterpieces and the proceeds paid for his studio. Wyeth was a realist painter at a time when the camera and photography began to compete with his craft. Sometimes seen as melodramatic, his illustrations were designed to be understood quickly. Wyeth, who was both a painter and an illustrator, understood the difference, and said in 1908, \\"Painting and illustration cannot be mixed‚Äîone cannot merge from one into the other.\\" He is the father of Andrew Wyeth and the grandfather of Jamie Wyeth, both well-known American painters. Early life  Wyeth in his studio, c. 1903 Wyeth was born in Needham, Massachusetts. An ancestor, Nicholas Wyeth, a stonemason, came to Massachusetts from England in 1645. Later ancestors were prominent participants in the French and Indian Wars, the Revolutionary War, the War of 1812, and the American Civil War, passing down rich oral histories and tradition to Wyeth and his family and providing subject matter for his art, which was deeply felt. His maternal ancestors came from Switzerland, and during her childhood, his mother was acquainted with literary giants Henry David Thoreau and Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. His literary appreciation and artistic talents appear to have come from her. He was the oldest of four brothers who spent much time hunting, fishing, and enjoying other outdoor pursuits, and doing chores on their farm. His varied youthful activities and his naturally astute sense of observation later aided the authenticity of his illustrations and obviated the need for models: \\"When I paint a figure on horseback, a man plowing, or a woman buffeted by the wind, I have an acute sense of the muscle strain.\\"An American Vision: Three Generations of Wyeth Art, Little Brown and Company, Boston, 1987, , p. 4 His mother encouraged his early inclination toward art. Wyeth was doing excellent watercolor paintings by the age of twelve.An American Vision, p. 78 He went to Mechanics Arts School to learn drafting, and then Massachusetts Normal Art School, now Massachusetts College of Art and Design, where painting instructor Richard Andrew advised him to become an illustrator, and then the Eric Pape School of Art to learn illustration, under George Loftus Noyes and Charles W. Reed.Kohler & Carson 1988, p. 204 Career One More Step, Mr. Hands, Treasure Island (1911) by Robert Louis Stevenson Title page, The Boy's King Arthur (1922), by Sidney Lanier Wyeth traveled to the Brandywine Valley to study with Howard Pyle, eventually settling in Chadds Ford, Pennsylvania. A bucking bronco for the cover of The Saturday Evening Post on February 21, 1903 was Wyeth's first commission as an illustrator. That year he described his work as \\"true, solid American subjects‚Äînothing foreign about them\\". It was a spectacular accomplishment for the 20-year-old Wyeth, after just a few months under Pyle's tutelage. In 1904, the same magazine commissioned him to illustrate a Western story, and Pyle urged Wyeth to go West to acquire direct knowledge, much as Zane Grey had done for his Western novels. In Colorado, he worked as a cowboy alongside the professional \\"punchers\\", moving cattle and doing ranch chores. He visited the Navajo in Arizona and gained an understanding of Native American culture. When his money was stolen, he worked as a mail carrier, riding between the Two Grey Hills trading post and Fort Defiance, to earn enough to get back home. He wrote home, \\"The life is wonderful, strange‚Äîthe fascination of it clutches me like some unseen animal‚Äîit seems to whisper, 'Come back, you belong here, this is your real home.'\\"An American Vision, p. 12 On a second trip two years later, he collected information on mining and brought home costumes and artifacts, including cowboy and Indian clothing. His early trips to the western United States inspired a period of images of cowboys and Native Americans that dramatized the Old West. Upon returning to Chadds Ford, he painted a series of farm scenes for Scribner's, finding the landscape less dramatic than that of the West but nonetheless a rich environment for his art: \\"Everything lies in its subtleties, everything is so gentle and simple, so unaffected.\\"An American Vision, p. 16 His painting Mowing (1907), not done for illustration, was among his most successful images of rural life. Wyeth created a stimulating household for his talented children Andrew Wyeth, Henriette Wyeth Hurd, Carolyn Wyeth, Ann Wyeth McCoy, and Nathaniel C. Wyeth. Wyeth was very sociable, and frequent visitors included F. Scott Fitzgerald, Joseph Hergesheimer, Hugh Walpole, Lillian Gish, and John Gilbert. According to Andrew, who spent the most time with his father due to his sickly childhood, Wyeth was a strict but patient father who did not talk down to his children.An American Vision, p. 78 His hard work as an illustrator gave his family the financial freedom to follow their own artistic and scientific pursuits. Andrew went on to become one of the foremost American artists of the second half of the 20th century, and both Henriette and Carolyn became artists also; Ann became an artist and composer. Nathaniel became an engineer for DuPont and worked on the team that invented the plastic soda bottle. Henriette and Ann married two of Wyeth's prot√©g√©s, Peter Hurd and John W. McCoy. Wyeth is the grandfather of artists Jamie Wyeth and Michael Hurd, and the musician Howard Wyeth. By 1911, Wyeth began to move away from Western subjects and on to illustrating classic literature. He painted a series for an edition of Treasure Island (1911), by Robert Louis Stevenson, thought by many to be his finest group of illustrations. The set made him famous, and the proceeds from this great success paid for his house and studio.An American Vision, p. 29 He also illustrated editions of Kidnapped (1913), Robin Hood (1917), The Last of the Mohicans (1919), Robinson Crusoe (1920), Rip Van Winkle (1921), The White Company (1922), and The Yearling (1939). He did work for prominent periodicals, including Century, Harper's Monthly, Ladies' Home Journal, McClure's, Outing, The Popular Magazine, and Scribner's. By 1914, Wyeth loathed the commercialism upon which he became dependent, and for the rest of his life he battled internally over his capitulation, accusing himself of having \\"bitched myself with the accursed success in skin-deep pictures and illustrations\\". He complained of money men \\"who want to buy me piecemeal\\" and that \\"an illustration must be made practical, not only in its dramatic statement, but it must be a thing that will adapt itself to the engravers' and printers' limitations. This fact alone kills that underlying inspiration to create thought. Instead of expressing that inner feeling, you express the outward thought‚Ä¶ or imitation of that feeling.\\"An American Vision, p. 18 Wyeth also did posters, calendars, and advertisements for clients such as Lucky Strike, Cream of Wheat, and Coca-Cola, as well as paintings of Beethoven, Wagner, and Liszt for Steinway & Sons. He painted murals of historical and allegorical subjects for the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston, the Westtown School, the First National Bank of Boston, the Hotel Roosevelt, the Franklin Savings Bank, the National Geographic Society, the Wilmington Savings Fund Society, and other public and private buildings. During both World Wars, he contributed patriotic images to government and private agencies.Chenoweth, H. Avery. Art of War: Eyewitness U.S. Combat Art from the Revolution Through the 20th Century. New York: Barnes & Noble Pub, 2003, pages 75, 106-108, and 360, . Wyeth was a member of The Franklin Inn Club in Philadelphia. Self-portrait by N. C. Wyeth, 1940 His nonillustrative portrait and landscape paintings changed dramatically in style throughout his life as he experimented first with impressionism in the 1910s (feeling an affinity with the nearby \\"New Hope Group\\"), the principles of the divisionist painter Giovanni Segantini, then by the 1930s veering to the realistic American regionalism of Thomas Hart Benton and Grant Wood, painting with thin oils and, occasionally, egg tempera. That was the medium favored by his son, Andrew, and introduced to both of them by his son-in-law Peter Hurd. Wyeth worked rapidly and experimented constantly, often working on a larger scale than necessary, befitting his energetic and grand vision, which often harked back to his ancestral past. He could conceive, sketch out, and paint a large painting in as little as three hours.An American Vision, p. 80 Death and legacy In June 1945, he had received the honorary degree of master of arts from Bowdoin College. Wyeth was a member of the National Academy, the Society of Illustrators, the Philadelphia Water Color Club, the Fellowship of the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, the Philadelphia Art Alliance, the Chester County Art Association, and the Wilmington Society of the Fine Arts. In October 1945, Wyeth and his grandson (Nathaniel C. Wyeth's son) were killed when the automobile they were riding in was struck by a freight train at a railway crossing (39.870747¬∞, -75.576979¬∞) near his Chadds Ford home.Kohler & Carson 1988, p. 205 At the time, Wyeth had been working on an ambitious series of murals for the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company depicting the Pilgrims at Plymouth, a series completed by Andrew Wyeth and John McCoy. Significant public collections of Wyeth's work are on display at the Brandywine River Museum in Chadds Ford, in Maine at the Portland Museum of Art, and at the Farnsworth Art Museum in Rockland, Maine. The Brandywine River Museum offers tours of the N. C. Wyeth House and Studio in Chadds Ford. The home and studio were designated as a National Historic Landmark in 1997. The home and studio are open to the public for tours. His studio is set up as if he has just left ‚Äî the palette he used on the day of his death sits by his last canvas.

The standard error (SE) of a statistic (usually an estimate of a parameter) is the standard deviation of its sampling distribution or an estimate of that standard deviation. If the statistic is the sample mean, it is called the standard error of the mean (SEM). The sampling distribution of a population mean is generated by repeated sampling and recording of the means obtained. This forms a distribution of different means, and this distribution has its own mean and variance. Mathematically, the variance of the sampling distribution obtained is equal to the variance of the population divided by the sample size. This is because as the sample size increases, sample means cluster more closely around the population mean. Therefore, the relationship between the standard error of the mean and the standard deviation is such that, for a given sample size, the standard error of the mean equals the standard deviation divided by the square root of the sample size. In other words, the standard error of the mean is a measure of the dispersion of sample means around the population mean. In regression analysis, the term \\"standard error\\" refers either to the square root of the reduced chi-squared statistic, or the standard error for a particular regression coefficient (as used in, say, confidence intervals). Standard error of the mean = Population = The standard error of the mean (SEM) can be expressed as: :{\\\\sigma}_\\\\bar{x}\\\\ = \\\\frac{\\\\sigma}{\\\\sqrt{n}} where :œÉ is the standard deviation of the population. :n is the size (number of observations) of the sample.  Estimate  Since the population standard deviation is seldom known, the standard error of the mean is usually estimated as the sample standard deviation divided by the square root of the sample size (assuming statistical independence of the values in the sample). :{\\\\sigma}_\\\\bar{x}\\\\ \\\\approx \\\\frac{s}{\\\\sqrt{n}} where :s is the sample standard deviation (i.e., the sample-based estimate of the standard deviation of the population), and :n is the size (number of observations) of the sample. = Sample = In those contexts where standard error of the mean is defined not as the standard deviation of the samples, but as its estimate, this is the estimate typically given as its value. Thus, it is common to see standard deviation of the mean alternatively defined as: :\\\\operatorname{s}_\\\\bar{x}\\\\ = \\\\frac{s}{\\\\sqrt{n}} Note: the standard error and the standard deviation of small samples tend to systematically underestimate the population standard error and standard deviation. In particular, the standard error of the mean is a biased estimator of the population standard error. With n = 2, the underestimate is about 25%, but for n = 6, the underestimate is only 5%. Gurland and Tripathi (1971) provide a correction and equation for this effect. Sokal and Rohlf (1981) give an equation of the correction factor for small samples of n < 20. See unbiased estimation of standard deviation for further discussion. A practical result: Decreasing the uncertainty in a mean value estimate by a factor of two requires acquiring four times as many observations in the sample; decreasing the standard error by a factor of ten requires a hundred times as many observations. = Derivations = The formula may be derived from the variance of a sum of independent random variables. * If x_1, x_2 , \\\\ldots, x_n are n independent observations from a population with mean \\\\mu and standard deviation \\\\sigma , then the variance of the total T = (x_1 + x_2 + \\\\cdots + x_n) is n\\\\sigma^2. * The variance of T/n (the mean \\\\bar{x}) must be n\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\sigma^2}{n^2}\\\\right)=\\\\frac{\\\\sigma^2}{n}. Alternatively, \\\\operatorname{Var}\\\\left(\\\\frac{T}{n}\\\\right) = \\\\frac{1}{n^2}\\\\operatorname{Var}(T) = \\\\frac{1}{n^2}n\\\\sigma^2 = \\\\frac{\\\\sigma^2}{n}. * Hence, the standard deviation of T/n must be \\\\sigma/{\\\\sqrt{n}} . I.i.d. with random sample size There are cases when a sample is taken without knowing, in advance, how many observations will be acceptable according to some criterion. In such cases, the sample size N is a random variable whose variation adds to the variation of X such that, :\\\\operatorname{Var}(T) = \\\\operatorname{E}(N)\\\\operatorname{Var}(X) + \\\\operatorname{Var}(N)\\\\big(\\\\operatorname{E}(X)\\\\big)^2Cornell, J R, and Benjamin, C A, Probability, Statistics, and Decisions for Civil Engineers, McGraw-Hill, NY, 1970, , pp. 178‚Äì9. If N has a Poisson distribution, then \\\\operatorname{E}(N)= \\\\operatorname{Var}(N) with estimator N = n. Hence the estimator of \\\\operatorname{Var}(T) becomes nS^2_X + n\\\\bar{X}^2, leading the following formula for standard error: :\\\\operatorname{Standard~Error}(\\\\bar{X})= \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{S^2_X + \\\\bar{X}^2}{n}} (since the standard deviation is the square root of the variance) Student approximation when œÉ value is unknown In many practical applications, the true value of œÉ is unknown. As a result, we need to use a distribution that takes into account that spread of possible œÉ's. When the true underlying distribution is known to be Gaussian, although with unknown œÉ, then the resulting estimated distribution follows the Student t-distribution. The standard error is the standard deviation of the Student t-distribution. T-distributions are slightly different from Gaussian, and vary depending on the size of the sample. Small samples are somewhat more likely to underestimate the population standard deviation and have a mean that differs from the true population mean, and the Student t-distribution accounts for the probability of these events with somewhat heavier tails compared to a Gaussian. To estimate the standard error of a Student t-distribution it is sufficient to use the sample standard deviation \\"s\\" instead of œÉ, and we could use this value to calculate confidence intervals. Note: The Student's probability distribution is approximated well by the Gaussian distribution when the sample size is over 100. For such samples one can use the latter distribution, which is much simpler. Assumptions and usage An example of how SE is used, is to make confidence intervals of the unknown population mean. If the sampling distribution is normally distributed, the sample mean, the standard error, and the quantiles of the normal distribution can be used to calculate confidence intervals for the true population mean. The following expressions can be used to calculate the upper and lower 95% confidence limits, where \\\\bar{x} is equal to the sample mean, SE is equal to the standard error for the sample mean, and 1.96 is the approximate value of the 97.5 percentile point of the normal distribution: :Upper 95% limit = \\\\bar{x} + (\\\\operatorname{SE}\\\\times 1.96) , and :Lower 95% limit = \\\\bar{x} - (\\\\operatorname{SE}\\\\times 1.96) . In particular, the standard error of a sample statistic (such as sample mean) is the actual or estimated standard deviation of the sample mean in the process by which it was generated. In other words, it is the actual or estimated standard deviation of the sampling distribution of the sample statistic. The notation for standard error can be any one of SE, SEM (for standard error of measurement or mean), or SE. Standard errors provide simple measures of uncertainty in a value and are often used because: *in many cases, if the standard error of several individual quantities is known then the standard error of some function of the quantities can be easily calculated; *when the probability distribution of the value is known, it can be used to calculate an exact confidence interval; *when the probability distribution is unknown, Chebyshev's or the Vysochanski√Ø‚ÄìPetunin inequalities can be used to calculate a conservative confidence interval; and * as the sample size tends to infinity the central limit theorem guarantees that the sampling distribution of the mean is asymptotically normal. =Standard error of mean versus standard deviation= In scientific and technical literature, experimental data are often summarized either using the mean and standard deviation of the sample data or the mean with the standard error. This often leads to confusion about their interchangeability. However, the mean and standard deviation are descriptive statistics, whereas the standard error of the mean is descriptive of the random sampling process. The standard deviation of the sample data is a description of the variation in measurements, while the standard error of the mean is a probabilistic statement about how the sample size will provide a better bound on estimates of the population mean, in light of the central limit theorem. Put simply, the standard error of the sample mean is an estimate of how far the sample mean is likely to be from the population mean, whereas the standard deviation of the sample is the degree to which individuals within the sample differ from the sample mean. If the population standard deviation is finite, the standard error of the mean of the sample will tend to zero with increasing sample size, because the estimate of the population mean will improve, while the standard deviation of the sample will tend to approximate the population standard deviation as the sample size increases. Extensions = Correction for finite population = The formula given above for the standard error assumes that the sample size is much smaller than the population size, so that the population can be considered to be effectively infinite in size. This is usually the case even with finite populations, because most of the time, people are primarily interested in managing the processes that created the existing finite population; this is called an analytic study, following W. Edwards Deming. If people are interested in managing an existing finite population that will not change over time, then it is necessary to adjust for the population size; this is called an enumerative study. When the sampling fraction is large (approximately at 5% or more) in an enumerative study, the estimate of the standard error must be corrected by multiplying by a finite population correction: (Equation 1) (Equation 2) : \\\\operatorname{FPC} = \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{N-n}{N-1}} which, for large N: : \\\\operatorname{FPC} \\\\approx \\\\sqrt{1-\\\\frac{n}{N}} to account for the added precision gained by sampling close to a larger percentage of the population. The effect of the FPC is that the error becomes zero when the sample size n is equal to the population size N. =Correction for correlation in the sample= Expected error in the mean of A for a sample of n data points with sample bias coefficient œÅ. The unbiased standard error plots as the œÅ = 0 diagonal line with log-log slope ‚àí¬Ω. If values of the measured quantity A are not statistically independent but have been obtained from known locations in parameter space x, an unbiased estimate of the true standard error of the mean (actually a correction on the standard deviation part) may be obtained by multiplying the calculated standard error of the sample by the factor f: :f= \\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{1+\\\\rho}{1-\\\\rho}} , where the sample bias coefficient œÅ is the widely used Prais‚ÄìWinsten estimate of the autocorrelation-coefficient (a quantity between ‚àí1 and +1) for all sample point pairs. This approximate formula is for moderate to large sample sizes; the reference gives the exact formulas for any sample size, and can be applied to heavily autocorrelated time series like Wall Street stock quotes. Moreover, this formula works for positive and negative œÅ alike. See also unbiased estimation of standard deviation for more discussion.

In Chinese, the name \\"Yiman\\" continues to be used. Geography The town is located on the left bank of the Bolshaya Ussurka River, near its mouth in the Ussuri River which here forms the border between Russia and China. The Chinese border is about from the town center. The town is also situated on the Malinovka River, which joins with the Bolshaya Ussurska within the town limits. One can see the spurs of the Sikhote-Alin ranges from any point of the town in clear weather. Salskaya Hill, an extinct volcano on the banks of the Bolshaya Ussurka, is also situated close to the town. Closeness of the taiga and the mineral springs, Lastochka and Shmakovka, numerous lakes and rivers, an abundance of sunny days, and a quiet measured life of the town make Dalnerechensk a local tourist attraction. History It was founded by the Cossacks in 1859 as the stanitsa of Grafskaya (). A railway station was built later in conjunction with the construction of the railway between Khabarovsk and Vladivostok; now the eastern section of the Trans-Siberian Railway. The railway station and settlement were later named after the Iman River. The settlement quickly became a timber center due to the large pine, fir, and spruce trees in the area, and was granted town status in 1917.–ü—Ä–∏–º–æ—Ä—Å–∫–∏–π –∫—Ä–∞–π–∏—Å–ø–æ–ª–∫–æ–º. \\"–ü—Ä–∏–º–æ—Ä—Å–∫–∏–π –∫—Ä–∞–π. –ê–¥–º–∏–Ω–∏—Å—Ç—Ä–∞—Ç–∏–≤–Ω–æ-—Ç–µ—Ä—Ä–∏—Ç–æ—Ä–∏–∞–ª—å–Ω–æ–µ –¥–µ–ª–µ–Ω–∏–µ –Ω–∞ 1 —è–Ω–≤–∞—Ä—è 1968 –≥.\\" –î–∞–ª—å–Ω–µ–≤–æ—Å—Ç–æ—á–Ω–æ–µ –∫–Ω–∏–∂–Ω–æ–µ –∏–∑–¥–∞—Ç–µ–ª—å—Å—Ç–≤–æ. –í–ª–∞–¥–∏–≤–æ—Å—Ç–æ–∫, 1968. –°—Ç—Ä. 22. The town was heavily damaged during the Russian Civil War. In May 1920, Sergey Lazo, Alexey Lutsky, and Vsevolod Sibirtsev‚Äîthree Bolsheviks taken prisoner by Japanese intervention troops after the Nikolayevsk Incident‚Äîwere murdered by the White Army Cossacks at the Muravyovo-Amurskaya railway station near the town. This event was greatly expanded by the Soviet propaganda of later years; allegedly the three were burned alive in the firebox of a steam locomotive. The village and station at Muravyovo were renamed Lazo, as were a number of other places and streets in the krai. The majority of the monuments in the town are devoted to the events of the Russian Civil War of 1918-1922 and World War II. There is a memorial in the town where frontier-guards who died in 1969 during the Sino- Soviet border conflict on Damansky Island are buried. Sino-Soviet tensions following this event led to a campaign of changing Chinese-derived place names in the region, with the town being renamed Dalnerechensk in 1972.

Initially he mostly helped his father, but from 1708 he worked independently and two years later, at the age of 22, he became known for his work on several statues on Charles Bridge in Prague, including the statuary of St. Adalbert, the statue of St. Gaetano, the sculpture group of Francis Borgia, the statues of St. Ignatius and Francis Xaverius, and the sculpture group of Saints John of Matha, Felix of Valois and Ivan which depicts in its lower section a dungeon in which emaciated Christians are guarded by a dog and a figure in Turkish costume. Around 1714 Ferdinand Brokoff began working with the Austrian architect Johann Bernhard Fischer von Erlach and moved to Vienna (while still taking commissions from Prague) where he worked on the church of St. Charles Borromei. He was also active in Silesia (Wroc≈Çaw), but had to return to Prague soon due to progressing tuberculosis. Nevertheless, he continued to sculpt in Prague and made some significant pieces during the 1720s, such as the monumental statuary and pillar at Hradƒçany Square () in 1726. In 1722 he was also commissioned to create 13 pieces of the Calvary to put in the niches of the New Castle Stairway, a project that was never realized. Towards the end of his life, the illness gradually prevented him from working alone, thus he only created the designs and models, and had them realized by his younger assistants. He died in Prague.

The most serious of these border clashes, which brought the world's two largest communist states to the brink of war, occurred in March 1969 in the vicinity of Zhenbao (Damansky) Island on the Ussuri (Wusuli) River, near Manchuria. The conflict resulted in a ceasefire, with a return to the status quo. Background =History= Under the governorship of Sheng Shicai (1933‚Äì1944) in northwest China's Xinjiang province, China's nationalist Kuomintang recognized for the first time the ethnic category of a Uyghur people, following Soviet ethnic policy. This ethnogenesis of a \\"national\\" people eligible for territorialized autonomy broadly benefited the Soviet Union, which organized conferences in Fergana and Semirechye (in Soviet Central Asia), in order to cause \\"revolution\\" in Altishahr (southern Xinjiang) and Dzungaria (northern Xinjiang). Both the Soviet Union and the White movement covertly allied with the Ili National Army to fight against the Kuomintang in the Three Districts Revolution. Although the mostly Muslim Uyghur rebels participated in pogroms against Han Chinese generally, the turmoil eventually resulted in the replacement of Kuomintang rule in Xinjiang with that of the Communist Party of China. Soviet historiography and more specifically Soviet \\"Uyghur Studies\\" were politicized in increasing measure to match the tenor of the Sino-Soviet split from the 1960s and 1970s. One Soviet Turkologist named Tursun Rakhminov, who worked for the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, argued that it was the modern Uyghurs who founded the ancient Toquz Oghuz Country (744‚Äì840), the Kara-Khanid Khanate (840‚Äì1212), and so forth. These premodern states' wars against Chinese dynasties were cast as struggles for national liberation by the Uyghur ethnic group. Soviet historiography was not consistent on these questions: when Sino-Soviet relations were warmer, for example, the Three Districts Revolution was portrayed by Soviet historians as part of anti-Kuomintangs during the Chinese Civil War, and not an anti-Chinese bid for national liberation. The Soviet Union also encouraged migration of Uyghurs to its territory in Kazakhstan along the 4,380 km (2,738 mi) border. In May 1962, 60,000 Uyghurs from Xinjiang Province crossed the frontier into the Soviet Union, fleeing the famine and economic chaos of the Great Leap Forward. Amid heightening tensions, the Soviet Union and China began border talks. Despite the Soviet Union having granted all of the territory of the Japanese puppet state of Manchukuo to Mao's communists in 1945, decisively assisting the communists in the Chinese Civil War, the Chinese now indirectly demanded territorial concessions on the basis that the 19th-century treaties transferring ownership of the sparsely populated Outer Manchuria, concluded by Qing dynasty China and the Russian Empire, were \\"Unequal Treaties\\", and amounted to annexation of rightful Chinese territory. Moscow would not accept this interpretation, but by 1964 the two sides did reach a preliminary agreement on the eastern section of the border, including Zhenbao Island, which would be handed over to China.Wang, Zhen ÁéãÊ•®.

Mao stated that China still had not presented a bill for this list. These comments were leaked to the public. Outraged, Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev then refused to approve the border agreement. =Geography= The border dispute in the west centered on of Soviet-controlled land in the Pamirs that lay on the border of Xinjiang and the Soviet Republic of Tajikistan. In 1892 the Russian Empire and the Qing Dynasty had agreed that the border would consist of the ridge of the Sarikol Range, but the exact border remained contentious throughout the 20th century. In the 1960s the Chinese began to insist that the Soviet Union should evacuate the region. From around 1900, after the Treaty of Peking (1860) had assigned Outer Manchuria (Primorskiy Kray) to Russia, the eastern part of the Sino-Soviet border had mainly been demarcated by three rivers, the Argun River from the tripartite junction with Mongolia to the north tip of China, running southwest to northeast, then the Amur River to Khabarovsk from northwest to southeast, where it was joined by Ussuri River running south to north. The Ussuri River was demarcated in a non- conventional manner: the demarcation line ran along the right (Chinese) side of the river, putting the river itself with all its islands in Russian possession. > \\"The modern method (used for the past 200 years) of demarcating a river > boundary between states today is to set the boundary at either the median > line (ligne m√©diane) of the river or around the area most suitable for > navigation under what is known as the 'thalweg principle.'\\" China claimed these islands, as they were located on the Chinese side of the river (if demarcated according to international rule using shipping lanes). The USSR wanted (and by then, already effectively controlled) almost every single island along the rivers. =Chinese and Soviet government views= The USSR had nuclear weapons for a longer time than China, so the Chinese adopted an asymmetric deterrence strategy that threatened a large conventional \\"People's War\\" in response to a Soviet counterforce first-strike. Chinese numerical superiority was the basis of its strategy to deter a Soviet nuclear attack. Since 1949, Chinese strategy as articulated by Mao Zedong emphasized the superiority of \\"man over weapons\\". While weapons were certainly an important component of warfare, Mao argued that they were \\"not the decisive factor; it is people, not things, that are decisive. The contest of strength is not only a contest of military and economic power, but also a contest of human power and morale\\". To Mao 'non-material' factors like 'creativity, flexibility and high morale' were also 'critical determinants in warfare'.Gerson, Michael S. (November 2010) The Sino-Soviet Border Conflict: Deterrence, Escalation, and the Threat of Nuclear War in 1969 . Center for Naval Analyses The Soviets were not confident they could win such a conflict. A large Chinese incursion could threaten strategic centers in Blagoveshchensk, Vladivostok, and Khabarovsk, as well as crucial nodes of the Trans-Siberian Railroad. According to Arkady Shevchenko, a high-ranking Russian defector to the United States, \\"The Politburo was terrified that the Chinese might make a mass intrusion into Soviet territory\\". A nightmare vision of invasion by millions of Chinese made the Soviet leaders almost frantic. \\"Despite our overwhelming superiority in weaponry, it would not be easy for the USSR to cope with an assault of this magnitude\\". Given China's \\"vast population and deep knowledge and experience in guerrilla warfare\\", if the Soviets launched an attack on China's nuclear program they would surely become \\"mired in an endless war\\". Concerns about Chinese manpower and its \\"people's war\\" strategy ran so deep that some bureaucrats in Moscow argued the only way to defend against a massive conventional onslaught was to use nuclear weapons. Some even advocated deploying nuclear mines along the Sino-Soviet border. By threatening to initiate a prolonged conventional conflict in retaliation for a nuclear strike, Beijing employed an asymmetric deterrence strategy intended to convince Moscow that the costs of an attack would outweigh the benefits. China had found its strategic rationale. While most Soviet military specialists did not fear a Chinese nuclear reprisal, believing that China's arsenal was so small, rudimentary and vulnerable that it could not survive a first strike and carry out a retaliatory attack, there was great concern about China's massive conventional army. Nikolai Ogarkov, a senior Soviet military officer, believed that a massive nuclear attack \\"would inevitably mean world war\\". Even a limited counterforce strike on China's nuclear facilities was dangerous, Ogarkov argued, because a few nuclear weapons would \\"hardly annihilate\\" a country the size of China and in response China would \\"fight unrelentingly\\". Eastern border: Heilongjiang (1969) The Soviet Border Service started to report intensifying Chinese military activity in the region during the early 1960s. The tensions were rising ‚Äì first, slowly, then, with the advent of the Cultural Revolution, much faster. The number of troops on both sides of the Sino-Soviet border increased dramatically after 1964. Militarily, in 1961, the USSR had 225,000 men and 200 aircraft at that border; in 1968, there were 375,000 men, 1,200 aircraft and 120 medium-range missiles. China had 1.5 million men stationed at the border and it had already tested its first nuclear weapon (the 596 Test in October 1964, at Lop Nur basin). Political rhetoric on both sides was getting increasingly hostile. The key moment in escalating Sino-Soviet tensions was the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia on 20‚Äì21 August 1968 and with it the proclamation of the Brezhnev Doctrine that the Soviet Union had the right to overthrow any Communist government that was diverging from Communism as defined by the Kremlin. Mao saw the Brezhnev doctrine as the ideological justification for a Soviet invasion of China to overthrow him and launched a massive propaganda campaign attacking the invasion of Czechoslovakia, despite the fact that he had earlier condemned the Prague Spring as \\"revisionism\\". On 21 August 1968, the Romanian leader Nicolae Ceau»ôescu gave a famous speech in Revolution Square in Bucharest denouncing the invasion of Czechoslovakia that was widely seen both in Romania and abroad as virtual declaration of independence from the Soviet Union. Romania started to move away from being in the Soviet sphere of influence to being in the Chinese sphere of influence. Speaking at a banquet held at the Romanian embassy in Beijing on 23 August 1968, the Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai denounced the Soviet Union for \\"fascist politics, great power chauvinism, national egoism and social imperialism\\", going on to compare the invasion of Czechoslovakia to the American war in Vietnam and more pointedly to the policies of Adolf Hitler towards Czechoslovakia in 1938‚Äì39. Zhou ended his speech with a barely veiled call for the people of Czechoslovakia to wage guerrilla war against the Red Army. The Chinese historian Li Danhui wrote in \\"Already in 1968, China began preparations to create a small war on the border\\". She noted that prior to March 1969 that the Chinese troops had twice attempted to provoke a clash along the border, \\"but the Soviets, feeling weak, did not accept the Chinese challenge and retreated.\\" Another Chinese historian, Yang Kuisong, wrote \\"There were already significant preparations in 1968, but the Russians did not come, so the planned ambush was not successful.\\" =Battle of Zhenbao Island= A Soviet ship using a water cannon against a Chinese fisherman on the Ussuri River on 6 May 1969 On 2 March 1969, a group of People's Liberation Army (PLA) troops ambushed Soviet border guards on Zhenbao Island. According to the Chinese sources, the Soviets suffered 58 dead, including a senior colonel, and 94 wounded. The Chinese losses were reported as 29 dead.\\"Zhƒìnb«éo d«éo z√¨w√®i f«énj√≠ zh√†n de q√≠ngku√†ng ji√®sh√†o\\" ÁèçÂÆùÂ≤õËá™Âç´ÂèçÂáªÊàòÁöÑÊÉÖÂÜµ‰ªãÁªç, Zh√†nb√®i ji√†oy√π c√°ili√†o ÊàòÂ§áÊïôËÇ≤ÊùêÊñô, p. 3‚Äì5, 7‚Äì9. According to the Soviet/Russian sources, no fewer than 248 Chinese troops were killed on the island and on the frozen river, while 32 Soviet border guards were killed, 14 wounded. To this day, each side blames the other for the start of the conflict. However, a scholarly consensus has emerged that the 1969 Sino-Soviet border crisis was a premeditated act of aggression orchestrated by the Chinese side. The American scholar Lyle J. Goldstein noted that Russian documents released since the glasnost era paint an unflattering picture of the Red Army command in the Far East with senior generals surprised by the outbreak of the fighting and of Red Army units haphazardly committed to action in a piecemeal style, but all of the documents speak of the Chinese as the aggressors. Even most Chinese historians now agree that on 2 March 1969, PLA forces planned and executed an ambush, which took the Soviets completely by surprise. Why the Chinese leadership opted for such an offensive measure against the Soviet Union remains a disputed question.Goldstein, p. 988, 990‚Äì995. On 2 March 1969, Damansky (Zhenbao) Island was under Soviet control, regularly patrolled by Soviet border guards. Occasional incursions of Chinese peasants and fishermen were blocked and repelled without use of deadly force. The Chinese attack on 2 March was led by 3 platoons of specially trained troops, supported by one artillery and two mortar units. It started unprovoked with the illegal crossing of the Sino-Soviet border by a group of 77 PLA soldiers, and took the Soviets by surprise. When a squad of seven men under the command of Sen Lt Ivan Strelnikov approached the Chinese with a verbal demand to leave the island, the Chinese troops opened fire, killing them all. This started a day of hostilities that saw a Chinese regular army detachment attacking two small groups of Soviet border guards comprising no more than 30 soldiers. The Chinese claim a different version of the conflict. The Chinese Cultural Revolution increased tensions between China and the USSR. This led to brawls between border patrols, and shooting broke out in March 1969. The USSR responded with tanks, armoured personnel carriers (APCs), and artillery bombardment. Over three days, the PLA successfully halted Soviet penetration and eventually evicted all Soviet troops from Zhenbao Island. During this skirmish the Chinese deployed two reinforced infantry platoons with artillery support. Chinese sources state the Soviets deployed some 60 soldiers and six BTR-60 amphibious APCs, and in a second attack some 100 troops backed up by 10 tanks and 14 APCs including artillery. The PLA had prepared for this confrontation for two to three months. From among the units, the PLA selected 900 soldiers commanded by army staff members with combat experience. They were provided with special training and special equipment. Then they were secretly dispatched to take position on Zhenbao Island in advance.Kuisong, pp. 28‚Äì29 Chinese General Chen Xilian stated the Chinese had won a clear victory on the battlefield. On 15 March the Soviets dispatched another 30 soldiers and six combat vehicles to Zhenbao Island. After an hour of fighting, the Chinese had destroyed two of the Soviet vehicles. A few hours later the Soviets sent a second wave with artillery support. The Chinese would destroy five more Soviet combat vehicles. A third wave would be repulsed by effective Chinese artillery which destroyed one Soviet tank and four APCs while damaging two other APCs. By the end of the day, with the Chinese in full control of the island, Soviet general O.A. Losik ordered to deploy then-secret BM-21 \\"Grad\\" multiple rocket launchers. The Soviets fired 10,000 artillery rounds in a nine-hour engagement with the Chinese along with 36 sorties.Gerson, Michael S. (2010) The Sino- Soviet Border Conflict Deterrence, Escalation, and the Threat of Nuclear War in 1969 . Center for Naval Analyses, U.S. The attack was devastating for the Chinese troops and materiel. Chinese troops left their positions on the island, following which the Soviets withdrew back to their positions on the Russian bank of the Ussuri river. On 16 March 1969, the Soviets entered the island to collect their dead; the Chinese held their fire. On 17 March 1969, the Soviets tried to recover a disabled T-62 tank from the island, but their effort was repelled by Chinese artillery. On 21 March, the Soviets sent a demolition team attempting to destroy the tank. The Chinese opened fire and thwarted the Soviets. With the help of divers of the Chinese navy, the PLA pulled the T-62 tank onshore. The tank was later given to the Chinese Military Museum. Until 1991, the island remained contested. The Soviet T-62 tank captured by the Chinese during the 1969 clash, now on display at the Military Museum of the Chinese People's Revolution =Soviet combat heroes= Five Soviet soldiers were awarded the top honour of the Hero of the Soviet Union for bravery and valor during the Damansky conflict. Col. Demokrat Leonov led the group of four T-62 tanks in a counter-attack on 15 March and was killed by a Chinese sniper when leaving the destroyed vehicle. Sen. Lt. Ivan Strelnikov tried to negotiate a peaceful withdrawal of the Chinese commandos from the island and was killed for his troubles while talking to the enemy. Sen. Lt. Vitaly Bubenin led a relief mission of 23 soldiers from the nearby border guards outpost and conducted a BTR-60 raid into the Chinese rear that allegedly left 248 attackers dead. Junior sergeant Yuri Babansky assumed command in a battle on 2 March, when the enemy had a 10:1 superiority, after the senior lieutenant Strelnikov was killed. He later led combat search and rescue teams that retrieved bodies of Sen. Lt Strelnikov and Col. Leonov. Junior sergeant Vladimir Orekhov took part in the 15 March battle. As a machine-gunner he was part of the first attacking line against the Chinese forces encamped on the island, he destroyed the enemy machine gun nest, and was wounded twice but continued fighting until he died of his wounds. High military orders of Lenin, The Red Banner, The Red Star and Glory were awarded to 54 soldiers and officers; medals \\"For Courage\\" and \\"For Battle Merit\\" ‚Äì to 94 border guards and servicemen. =Chinese combat heroes= During the Zhenbao Island clashes with the Soviet Army in March 1969 one Chinese RPG team, Hua Yujie and his assistant Yu Haichang destroyed four Soviet APCs and achieved more than ten kills. Hua and Yu received the accolade \\"Combat Hero\\" from the CMC, and their action was commemorated on a postage stamp. Diplomacy On 17 March 1969, an emergency meeting of the Warsaw Pact organisation was called in Budapest by Brezhnev with the aim of condemning China. The meeting turned acrimonious as Romania's Nicolae Ceau»ôescu refused, despite considerable Soviet pressure, to sign the statement condemning China. Ceau»ôescu's intransigence led to no statement being issued in what was widely seen as a Soviet diplomatic defeat. The next day saw a meeting of the delegations representing 66 Communist Parties in Moscow to discuss the preparations for a world summit of Communist Parties in Moscow on 5 June 1969. A Soviet motion to condemn China failed with the delegations representing the Communist Parties of Romania, India, Spain, Switzerland, and Austria all supporting the Chinese position that it was the Soviet Union that attacked China rather than vice versa. On 21 March 1969, the Soviet Premier, Alexei Kosygin, tried to phone Mao with the aim of discussing a ceasefire. The Chinese operator who took Kosygin's call rather rudely called him a \\"revisionist element\\" and hung up. Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai, who wanted to take up Kosygin's ceasefire offer, was shocked by what he regarded as Mao's recklessness, saying: \\"The two countries are at war, one cannot chop the messenger.\\" Diplomats from the Soviet Embassy in Beijing spent much of 22 March vainly attempting to get hold of Mao's private phone number, in order that Kosygin could call him to discuss peace. On 22 March 1969, Mao had a meeting with the four marshals who commanded the PLA troops in the border regions with the Soviet Union to begin preparations for a possible all-out war. Zhou repeatedly urged Mao to discuss a ceasefire though also agreed with Mao's refusal to take phone calls from Kosygin. In an effort to placate Zhou, Mao told him: \\"Immediately prepared to hold diplomatic negotiations\\". Between 1‚Äì24 April 1969, the 9th Congress of the Chinese Communist Party took place and Mao officially proclaimed the end of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution he had begun in May 1966. Despite the official end of the Cultural Revolution, the Congress elected to key positions followers of the ultra- leftwing factions associated with Mao's powerful wife, Jiang Qing, and the Defense Minister Lin Biao. Both Jiang and Lin favored a hard-line towards the Soviet Union. At the same time, Mao had ordered preparations for a \\"defense in depth\\" along the border as by this time there were real fears that the border crisis would escalate into all-out war. In a bid to repair China's image abroad, which had been badly damaged by the Cultural Revolution, on 1 May 1969, Mao invited diplomats from several Third World nations to attend the May Day celebrations in Beijing. To the assembled diplomats, Mao formally apologized for the attacks by the Red Guards against diplomats in China together with the smashing up of the embassies in Beijing in 1967. Mao claimed not to be aware of the fact that the xenophobic Red Guard had been beating up and sometimes killing foreigners living in China during the Cultural Revolution. At the same time, Mao announced that for the first time since the Cultural Revolution he would send out ambassadors to represent China abroad (most of the Chinese ambassadors had been recalled and executed during the Cultural Revolution with no replacements being sent out). By this time, Mao had felt that China's isolation caused by the Cultural Revolution had become a problem with his nation on the brink of a war with the Soviet Union. On 5 May 1969, Kosygin traveled to India, an archenemy of China's ever since it had been defeated in the 1962 war, to discuss with Prime Minister Indira Gandhi an anti-Chinese Soviet-Indian alliance. Between 14‚Äì19 May 1969, Nikolai Podgorny visited North Korea with the aim of making an offer to pull Kim Il-sung away from the Chinese orbit. Kim declined to move away from China, and in a show of support for Mao, North Korea sent no delegation to the world conference of Communist Parties that was held in Moscow in June 1969. On 17 June 1969, the Senate Majority Leader Mike Mansfield, who had long been an advocate of normalizing American relations with China, wrote a letter in consultation with the White House urging that he be allowed to visit China and to meet Mao to discuss measures to improve Sino-American relations. The letter was sent to King Norodom Sihanouk of Cambodia with the request to pass on to Mao, and by 26 July 1969 Mansfield's letter arrived in Beijing. The Chinese reply was harsh with Zhou giving a speech accusing the United States of \\"aggression\\" in Vietnam and of \\"occupation\\" of Taiwan, which Zhou asserted was rightfully a part of China. On 1 August 1969, United States President Richard Nixon visited Pakistan, a close ally of China owing to their shared hatred of India, to ask General Yahya Khan to pass a message to Mao saying he wanted to normalize relations with China, especially given the crisis with the Soviet Union. On 2‚Äì3 August 1969 Nixon visited Romania to meet with Ceau»ôescu and to ask him to pass along the same message to Mao. Ceau»ôescu agreed to do so, and on 7 September 1969 the Romanian Prime Minister Ion Gheorghe Maurer, who was in Hanoi to attend the funeral of Ho Chi Minh, took Zhou aside to tell him that Nixon wanted an opening to China. Western border: Xinjiang (1969) Further border clashes occurred in August 1969, this time along the western section of the Sino-Soviet border in Xinjiang. After the Tasiti incident and the Bacha Dao incident, the Tielieketi Incident finally broke out. Chinese troops suffered 28 losses. Heightened tensions raised the prospect of an all-out nuclear exchange between China and the Soviet Union.Kuisong The Funeral of Ho Chi Minh The decisive event that stopped the crisis from escalating into all-out war was the death of Ho Chi Minh on 3 September 1969. The funeral of Ho in Hanoi was attended by both Zhou and Kosygin, though at different times. Zhou flew out of Hanoi to avoid being in the same room as Kosygin. The possibility of North Vietnam's leading supporters going to war with one another alarmed the North Vietnamese. During the funeral of Ho, messages were exchanged between the Soviet and Chinese sides via the North Vietnamese. At the same time, Nixon's message via Maurer had reached the Chinese, and it was decided in Beijing to \\"whet the appetite of the Americans\\" by making China appear stronger. Zhou argued that a war with the Soviet Union would weaken China's hand vis-a-vis the United States. The Chinese were more interested in the possibility of a rapprochement with the United States as a way of re- acquiring Taiwan than in having the United States as an ally against the Soviet Union. After attending Ho's funeral, the airplane taking Kosygin back to Moscow was denied permission to use Chinese air space, forcing it to land for refuelling in Calcutta. While in India, Kosygin received the message via the Indian government that the Chinese were willing to discuss peace, causing him to fly back to Beijing instead.  Assessment  = Near-war state = In the early 1960s, the United States had \\"probed\\" the level of Soviet interest in joint action against Chinese nuclear weapons facilities; now the Soviets probed what the United States' reaction would be if the USSR attacked the facilities.Burr, William. \\"The Sino-Soviet Border Conflict, 1969 \\" National Security Archive, 12 June 2001. While noting that \\"neither side wishes the inflamed border situation to get out of hand\\", the Central Intelligence Agency in August 1969 described the conflict as having \\"explosive potential\\" in the President's Daily Briefing. The agency stated that \\"the potential for a war between them clearly exists\\", including a Soviet attack on Chinese nuclear facilities, while China \\"appears to view the USSR as its most immediate enemy\\". As war fever gripped China, Moscow and Beijing took steps to lower the danger of a large-scale conflict. On 11 September 1969, Soviet premier Alexei Kosygin, on his way back from the funeral of Ho Chi Minh, stopped over in Beijing for talks with his Chinese counterpart, Zhou Enlai. Symbolic of the frosty relations between the two communist countries, the talks were held at Beijing airport. The two premiers agreed to return ambassadors previously recalled and to begin border negotiations. = Possible reasons for attack = The view on the reasoning and consequences of the conflict differ. Western historians believe the events at Zhenbao Island and the subsequent border clashes in Xinjiang were mostly caused by Mao's using Chinese local military superiority to satisfy domestic political imperatives in 1969.Goldstein, p. 997. Yang Kuisong concludes that \\"the [Sino-Soviet] military clashes were primarily the result of Mao Zedong's domestic mobilization strategies, connected to his worries about the development of the Cultural Revolution.\\"Kuisong, p. 22. Russian historians point out that the consequences of the conflict stem directly from the desire of the PRC to take a leading role in the world and to strengthen ties with the US. According to the 2004 Russian documentary film, Damansky Island Year 1969, Chairman Mao sought to elevate his country from the world's periphery and to place it at the centre of world politics.The film features interviews with participants and leaders from both sides of the conflict. Other analysts say the Chinese intended their attack on Zhenbao to deter future Soviet invasions by demonstrating that China could not be 'bullied. = Aftermath = In the aftermath of the conflict, China gained newfound respect in the US, who began seeing it as a competent ally against the USSR during the Cold War. Seen against the background of the Brezhnev-Nixon d√©tente talks, the Damansky incident could serve the double purpose of undermining the Soviet image of a peace-loving country‚Äîif the USSR chose to respond with a massive military operation against the invaders‚Äîor demonstrating Soviet weakness, if the Chinese attack had been left without response. The killing of Soviet servicemen on the border signaled to the US that China had graduated into high politics and was ready for dialog. After the conflict, the US showed interest in strengthening ties with the Chinese government by secretly sending Henry Kissinger to China for a meeting with Prime Minister Zhou Enlai in 1971, during the so-called Ping Pong Diplomacy, paving the way for Richard Nixon to visit China and meet with Mao Zedong in 1972. China's relations with the USSR remained sour after the conflict, despite the border talks, which began in 1969 and continued inconclusively for a decade. Domestically, the threat of war caused by the border clashes inaugurated a new stage in the Cultural Revolution; that of China's thorough militarization. The 9th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, held in the aftermath of the Zhenbao Island incident, confirmed Defense Minister Lin Biao as Mao's heir apparent. Following the events of 1969, the Soviet Union further increased its forces along the Sino-Soviet border, and in the Mongolian People's Republic. Overall, the Sino-Soviet confrontation, which reached its peak in 1969, paved the way to a profound transformation in the international political system. Border negotiations 1990s‚Äìpresent Serious border demarcation negotiations did not occur until shortly before the end of the Soviet Union in 1991. In particular, both sides agreed that Zhenbao Island belonged to China. (Both sides claimed the island was under their control at the time of the agreement.) On 17 October 1995, an agreement over the last stretch of the border was reached, but the question of control over three islands in the Amur and Argun rivers was left to be settled later. In a border agreement between Russia and China signed on 14 October 2003, that dispute was finally resolved. China was granted control over Tarabarov Island (Yinlong Island), Zhenbao Island, and approximately 50% of Bolshoy Ussuriysky Island (Heixiazi Island), near Khabarovsk. China's Standing Committee of the National People's Congress ratified this agreement on 27 April 2005, with the Russian Duma following suit on 20 May. On 2 June, Chinese Foreign Minister Li Zhaoxing and Russian Minister of Foreign Affairs Sergei Lavrov exchanged the ratification documents from their respective governments. On 21 July 2008, Chinese Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi and his Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov, signed an additional Sino-Russian Border Line Agreement marking the acceptance of the demarcation of the eastern portion of the Chinese-Russian border in Beijing, China. An additional protocol with a map affiliated on the eastern part of the borders both countries share was signed. The agreement also includes the PRC gaining ownership of Yinlong / Tarabarov Island and half of Heixiazi / Bolshoi Ussuriysky Island. In the 21st century, the Chinese Communist Party's version of the conflict, present on many official websites, describes the events of March 1969 as a Soviet aggression against China.

The disorder is characterized by hypoglycemia and sudden death without timely intervention, most often brought on by periods of fasting or vomiting. Prior to expanded newborn screening, MCADD was an underdiagnosed cause of sudden death in infants. Individuals who have been identified prior to the onset of symptoms have an excellent prognosis. MCADD is most prevalent in individuals of Northern European Caucasian descent, with an incidence of 1:4000 to 1:17,000 depending on the population. Treatment of MCADD is mainly preventive, by avoiding fasting and other situations where the body relies on fatty acid oxidation to supply energy. Signs and symptoms MCAD is one of the enzymes responsible for dehydrogenation of fatty acids as they cycle through the beta-oxidation spiral. MCADD presents in early childhood with hypoketotic hypoglycemia and liver dysfunction, often preceded by extended periods of fasting or an infection with vomiting. Infants who are exclusively breast-fed may present in this manner shortly after birth, due to poor feeding. In some individuals the first manifestation of MCADD may be sudden death following a minor illness. A number of individuals with MCADD may remain completely asymptomatic, provided they never encounter a situation that sufficiently stresses their metabolism. With the advent of expanded newborn screening, some mothers have been identified with MCADD after their infants had positive newborn screens for low carnitine levels. The enzyme MCAD is responsible for the dehydrogenation step of fatty acids with chain lengths between 6 and 12 carbons as they undergo beta-oxidation in the mitochondria. Fatty acid beta-oxidation provides energy after the body has used up its stores of glucose and glycogen. This oxidation typically occurs during periods of extended fasting or illness when caloric intake is reduced, and energy needs are increased. Genetics MCADD is inherited in an autosomal recessive manner, meaning an affected individual must inherit a mutated allele from both of their parents. ACADM is the gene involved, located at 1p31, with 12 exons and coding for a protein of 421 amino acids. There is a common mutation among Northern European Caucasians, 985A>G, which results in a lysine being replaced by a glutamic acid at position 304 of the protein. Other mutations have been identified more commonly since newborn screening has expanded the mutation spectrum. The 985A>G common mutation is present in the homozygous state in 80% of Caucasian individuals who presented clinically with MCADD and in 60% of the population identified by screening. An individual's genotype does not correlate well with their clinical phenotype for MCADD. The clinical presentation of an individual with MCADD depends not only on the presence of the mutations in the ACADM gene, but also on the presence of environmental or physiological stressors that require the body to depend on fatty acid oxidation for energy. Some mutations, identified through newborn screening programs and associated with higher residual enzyme activity have not been seen in individuals with clinical symptoms of MCADD. Despite this, treatment with fasting avoidance remains the norm for all those diagnosed with MCADD. Diagnosis Clinically, MCADD or another fatty acid oxidation disorder is suspected in individuals who present with lethargy, seizures, coma and hypoketotic hypoglycemia, particularly if triggered by a minor illness. MCADD can also present with acute liver disease and hepatomegaly, which can lead to a misdiagnosis of Reye syndrome. In some individuals, the only manifestation of MCADD is sudden, unexplained death often preceded by a minor illness that would not usually be fatal. Acylcarnitine profile of an individual with MCADD, showing characteristic elevation of octanoylcarnitine (C8).In areas with expanded newborn screening using tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS), MCADD is usually detected shortly after birth, by the analysis of blood spots collected on filter paper. Acylcarnitine profiles with MS/MS will show a very characteristic pattern of elevated hexanoylcarnitine (C6), octanoylcarnitine (C8), decanoylcarnitine (C10) or decenoylcarnitine (C10:1), with C8 being greater than C6 and C10. Secondary carnitine deficiency is sometimes seen with MCADD, and in these cases, acylcarnitine profiles may not be informative. Urine organic acid analysis by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) will show a pattern of dicarboxylic aciduria with low levels of ketones. Traces of acylglycine species may also be detected. Asymptomatic individuals may have normal biochemical lab results. For these individuals, targeted analysis of acylglycine species by GC-MS, specifically hexanoylglycine and suberylglycine can be diagnostic. After biochemical suspicion of MCADD, molecular genetic analysis of ACADM can be used to confirm the diagnosis. The analysis of MCAD activity in cultured fibroblasts can also be used for diagnosis. In cases of sudden death where the preceding illness would not usually have been fatal, MCADD is often suspected. The autopsy will often show fatty deposits in the liver. In cases where MCADD is suspected, acylcarnitine analysis of bile and blood can be undertaken postmortem for diagnosis. Where samples are not available, residual blood from newborn screening may be helpful. Biochemical testing of asymptomatic siblings and parents may also be informative. MCADD and other fatty acid oxidation disorders have been recognized in recent years as undiagnosed causes of sudden infant death syndrome. Treatment As with most other fatty acid oxidation disorders, individuals with MCADD need to avoid fasting for prolonged periods of time. During illnesses, they require careful management to stave off metabolic decompensation, which can result in death. Supplementation of simple carbohydrates or glucose during illness is key to prevent catabolism. The duration of fasting for individuals with MCADD varies with age, infants typically require frequent feedings or a slow release source of carbohydrates, such as uncooked cornstarch. Illnesses and other stresses can significantly reduce the fasting tolerance of affected individuals. Individuals with MCADD should have an \\"emergency letter\\" that allows medical staff who are unfamiliar with the patient and the condition to administer correct treatment properly in the event of acute decompensation. This letter should outline the steps needed to intervene in a crisis and have contact information for specialists familiar with the individual's care. Misdiagnosis issues * The MCADD disorder is commonly mistaken for Reye Syndrome by pediatricians. Reye Syndrome is a severe disorder that may develop in children while they appear to be recovering from viral infections such as chicken pox or flu. * Most cases of Reye Syndrome are associated with the use of Aspirin during these viral infections.  Prognosis  A 1994 study of the entire population of New South Wales (Australia) found 20 patients. Of these, 5 (25%) had died at or before 30 months of age. Of the survivors, 1 (5%) was severely disabled and the remainder had either suffered mild disability or were making normal progress in school. A 2006 Dutch study followed 155 cases and found that 27 individuals (17%) had died at an early age. Of the survivors, 24 (19%) suffered from some degree of disability, of which most were mild. All the 18 patients diagnosed neonatally were alive at the time of the follow-up. Incidence MCADD is most prevalent in individuals of Northern European Caucasian descent. The incidence in Northern Germany is 1:4000, currently the highest in the world. Northern Europe is also the origin of the common mutation in MCADD. For populations without origins in Northern Europe, the incidence is significantly lower, 1:51,000 in Japan and 1:700,000 in Taiwan. The common mutation has not been identified in MCADD cases identified in Asian populations.

It was followed by multiple demos, including Trail of Life Decayed in 1991 and A Moonclad Reflection in 1992, which both showed a progression into the more melodic nuances of death metal that the band would explore on their later studio releases. In August 1993, the band released their debut album Skydancer. Soon after, vocalist Anders Frid√©n left the band and joined fellow Gothenburg band, In Flames. Guitarist Mikael Stanne then assumed the position of lead vocalist, and Fredrik Johansson was recruited to take over guitar duties. =The Gallery and Of Chaos and Eternal Night (1994‚Äì1995)= In 1994, Dark Tranquillity covered the song \\"My Friend of Misery\\" for the Metallica tribute album Metal Militia ‚àí A Tribute to Metallica. In 1995, the band released an EP, Of Chaos and Eternal Night, which was later followed by the release of their second studio album, The Gallery. The Gallery has been referred to as a masterpiece from the era. =The Mind's I (1996‚Äì1998)= Dark Tranquillity released their second EP, Enter Suicidal Angels, in November 1996. Their third album, The Mind's I, was released in April 1997, with the band continuing further with the sound conveyed on The Gallery. =Projector, lineup changes and a different sound (1999)= In January 1999, Fredrik Johansson and the band parted ways. Johansson's desire to focus on fatherhood and hold a day job, rather than dealing with the uncertainties of the music industry was incompatible with the band's need for a reliable guitarist. With that position now vacant, bassist Martin Henriksson, who was a little reluctant to do so, took over duties as guitarist, and the band brought in Michael Niklasson on bass. Projector saw the introduction of a lot of piano, keyboard, and electronic parts into Dark Tranquillity's sound, so the band also added another member, Martin Br√§ndstr√∂m, on keyboards. With this new lineup, the band played live bonus tracks of the reissue of this album and filmed a music video for \\"ThereIn\\". Projector was released in June 1999, and was later nominated for a Swedish Grammy Award. The album saw a major change in songwriting: while retaining growled vocals and their signature death metal sound, the band added pianos, baritone soft vocals, and verse-chorus fashion to their sound, reflecting the band's goal to strive for different musical expressions. Around the same time, Skydancer and Of Chaos and Eternal Night were reissued together as Skydancer/Of Chaos and Eternal Night. =Haven (2000)= A year later saw the release of Haven, which featured prominent electronics in comparison to previous releases. Like its predecessor, Haven was also received in a generally mixed manner by fans and critics alike. As the band toured in 2001, the band hired Robin Engstr√∂m to play live, due to Jivarp's commitments as a new father. =Damage Done and Exposures ‚àí In Retrospect and Denial (2001‚Äì2004)= Dark Tranquillity released Damage Done in 2002, was a return to a much heavier direction, adding thicker guitar distortion, deep atmospheric keyboards, and abandoning soft vocals altogether. They released the music video for the single \\"Monochromatic Stains\\", followed by their release of Live Damage, their first live DVD. In 2004, their compilation album Exposures ‚Äì In Retrospect and Denial, featuring one disc with rare and unreleased tracks and another with live tracks, was released.http://www.metalstorm.net/pub/review.php?review_id=606 =Character (2005)= Character was the seventh release from Dark Tranquillity, released in 2005, and was held in much critical praise. It featured the third music video released by Dark Tranquillity, with the successful single \\"Lost to Apathy\\". After releasing the album, the band played live in Canada for the first time. =Fiction (2006‚Äì2009)= Dark Tranquillity headlining the Agglutination Metal Festival, 2008 In 2007, Fiction was released, which in turn, saw a return of Stanne's clean vocals, and the first female guest vocalist since Projector. The album also saw writing style that combined the stylings of Projector and Haven, with the more aggressive traits of Character and Damage Done. At this time, Dark Tranquillity toured with The Haunted, Into Eternity, and Scar Symmetry for the North America Metal for the Masses Tour. They also toured the UK in early 2008 along with Omnium Gatherum. They returned to the US during spring 2008 with Arch Enemy. On the band's official website they announced that bass guitarist Niklasson left the band in August 2008 due to personal reasons with no hard feelings between him and the band. On 19 September 2008, the band found a new bassist in Dimension Zero guitarist Daniel Antonsson, who also was a guitarist for Soilwork. On 25 May 2009, reissues of Projector, Haven, and Damage Done were released. =We Are the Void (2010‚Äì2011)= On 14 October 2009, Dark Tranquillity finished work on their ninth studio album. On 26 October 2009, they released a DVD titled Where Death Is Most Alive. On 30 October 2009, at the release party of the DVD, 333 copies were given away for free of the rare live album The Dying Fragments. On 21 December 2009, Dark Tranquillity released the song \\"Dream Oblivion\\", and on 14 January 2010, they released the song \\"At the Point of Ignition\\", from their ninth album, exclusively on their MySpace page. Their ninth album, titled We Are the Void, was released on 1 March 2010 in Europe and 2 March in the US. They were also the opening act for a US winter tour that was headlined by Killswitch Engage and joined by The Devil Wears Prada. Dark Tranquillity headlined a North American tour in May‚ÄìJune 2010 with Threat Signal, Mutiny Within and The Absence. In February 2011, the band performed live at BITS Pilani Hyderabad Campus in Hyderabad, India. =Construct (2012‚Äì2013)= On 27 April 2012, Dark Tranquillity renewed their contract with Century Media. On 18 October 2012, the band began writing for the album. On 10 January 2013, the band announced the title of their tenth album would be Construct, and it was released in Europe on 27 May 2013 and in North America on 28 May 2013. The album was mixed by Jens Bogren at his Fascination Street studios in √ñrebro, Sweden. On 18 February 2013, Antonsson amicably left Dark Tranquillity, citing a desire to focus on playing guitar and being a recording engineer and producer. On 27 February 2013, the band announced that they completed recording the album. Although Antonsson remained during the recording of \\"Construct\\", he did not perform the bass. According to Niklas Sundin's Twitter, he hasn't been excited for a Dark Tranquillity release since Skydancer, due to the fact that the recording sessions for all their other releases were \\"way too long\\" compared to Construct. On 27 March 2013, a teaser campaign and track list for Construct were revealed. The band also commented on the style of the album, saying, \\"While still bearing the unmistakable mark of the Dark Tranquillity, the record is probably our most different and diverse offering since 1999's Projector\\". To promote the album, the band toured the world with dates in Finland and North America alongside Omnium Gatherum, Europe with Tristania, and Sweden with Darkane. On 10 July 2013, a B-side from Construct, titled \\"Sorrow's Architect\\", was released on a limited flexi 7\\" released with an issue of Decibel. On 14 January 2014, the band announced that the song would be released with another B-side, titled \\"A Memory Construct\\", on a limited tour 7\\" and digitally which also includes the \\"Sorrow's Architect\\". The 7\\" became available on 1 February 2014, and digitally in March 2014. =Atoma (2014‚Äì2018)= In March 2016, guitarist Martin Henriksson announced his departure from the band, admitting he had \\"lost the passion for playing music\\" after playing in the band for 26 years. On 22 May 2016, Dark Tranquillity began recording their eleventh full-length album Atoma, but did not officially announce it until 6 July. The album was finally released on 4 November 2016, via Century Media. In March 2017, the band released the song \\"The Absolute\\", which was recorded during the Atoma sessions, as a digital single. On 28 January 2018, Dark Tranquillity embarked on a European tour with main support band Equilibrium. =Moment and guitarist changes (2019‚Äìpresent)= On 29 June 2019, Mikael Stanne said in an interview that the band is \\"gathering material and starting the pre-production process\\" for their twelfth studio album. On 22 March 2020, Niklas Sundin released a statement on Dark Tranquillity's social media, announcing his departure from the band. A week later the band announced on that the recording of their new album had started, and that the two guitarists who had been touring with the band touring since 2017, Christopher Amott and Johan Reinholdz are now full members of the band. The release of the new album called Moment is scheduled for 20 November 2020. As a preview, they released the single \\"Phantom Days\\" on 11 September 2020.

In many programming languages (especially statically-typed programming languages such as C, C++, Java) the return type must be explicitly specified when declaring a function. In the Java example: public void setShuma(int n1, int n2) { Shuma = n1 + n2 } public int getShuma() { return Shuma; } the return type is int. The program can therefore rely on the method returning a value of type int. Various mechanisms are used for the case where a subroutine does not return any value, e.g., a return type of void is used in some programming languages: public void returnNothing() Returning a value from a method A method returns to the code that invoked it when it completes all the statements in the method, reaches a return statement, or throws an exception, whichever occurs first. You declare a method's return type in its method declaration. Within the body of the method, you use the return statement to return the value. Any method declared void doesn't return a value. It does not need to contain a return statement, but it may do so. In such a case, a return statement can be used to branch out of a control flow block and exit the method and is simply used like this: return; If you try to return a value from a method that is declared void, you will get a compiler error. Any method that is not declared void must contain a return statement with a corresponding return value, like this: return returnValue; The data type of the return value must match the method's declared return type; you can't return an integer value from a method declared to return a boolean. The getArea() method in the Rectangle Rectangle class that was discussed in the sections on objects returns an integer: // A method for computing the area of the rectangle public int getArea() { return width * height; } This method returns the integer that the expression evaluates to. The getArea method returns a primitive type. A method can also return a reference type. For example, in a program to manipulate Bicycle objects, we might have a method like this: public Bicycle seeWhosFastest(Bicycle myBike, Bicycle yourBike, Environment env) { Bicycle fastest; // Code to calculate which bike is // faster, given each bike's gear // and cadence and given the // environment (terrain and wind) return fastest; } References Category:Subroutines Category:Articles with example Java code ","title":"Return type"},{"id":"552582","text":"Joseph Gerald Gallagher (born 4 May 1964) is a British-born Swiss chess player and writer.

His publications include Problems of the Self (1973), Ethics and the Limits of Philosophy (1985), Shame and Necessity (1993), and Truth and Truthfulness (2002). He was knighted in 1999. As Knightbridge Professor of Philosophy at the University of Cambridge and Deutsch Professor of Philosophy at the University of California, Berkeley, Williams became known for his efforts to reorient the study of moral philosophy to psychology, history, and in particular to the Greeks.Mark P. Jenkins, Bernard Williams, Abingdon: Routledge, 2014 [2006], 3.Colin Koopman, \\"Bernard Williams on Philosophy's Need for History,\\" The Review of Metaphysics, 64(1), September 2010, 3‚Äì30. Described by Colin McGinn as an \\"analytical philosopher with the soul of a general humanist,\\" he was sceptical about attempts to create a foundation for moral philosophy. Martha Nussbaum wrote that he demanded of philosophy that it \\"come to terms with, and contain, the difficulty and complexity of human life.\\"Colin McGinn, \\"Isn't It the Truth?\\", The New York Review of Books, 10 April 2003.Martha C. Nussbaum, \\"Tragedies, hope, justice,\\" in Daniel Callcut (ed.), Reading Bernard Williams, Abingdon: Routledge, 2009, 213. Williams was a strong supporter of women in academia; according to Nussbaum, he was \\"as close to being a feminist as a powerful man of his generation could be.\\"Martha C. Nussbaum, \\"Tragedy and Justice\\" , Boston Review, October/November 2003. He was also famously sharp in conversation. Gilbert Ryle, one of Williams's mentors at Oxford, said that he \\"understands what you're going to say better than you understand it yourself, and sees all the possible objections to it, and all the possible answers to all the possible objections, before you've got to the end of your own sentence.\\"Bryan Magee, Confessions of a Philosopher, Modern Library, 1999, 83.

After Oxford, Williams spent his two-year national service flying Spitfires in Canada for the Royal Air Force. While on leave in New York, he became close to Shirley Brittain Catlin (born 1930), daughter of the novelist Vera Brittain and the political scientist George Catlin. They had already been friends at Oxford. Catlin had moved to New York to study economics at Columbia University on a Fulbright scholarship. Williams returned to England to take up his fellowship at All Souls and in 1954 became a fellow at New College, Oxford, a position he held until 1959. Alan Code, Samuel Scheffler, Barry Stroud, \\"In Memoriam: Bernard A. O. Williams\\" , University of California. He and Catlin continued seeing each other. She began working for the Daily Mirror and sought election as a Labour MP. Williams, also a member of the Labour Party, helped her with the 1954 by-election in Harwich in which she was an unsuccessful candidate.Shirley Williams 2009, 104, 114. =First marriage, London= Shirley Williams, 2011 Williams and Catlin were married in London in July 1955 at St James's, Spanish Place, near Marylebone High Street, followed by a honeymoon in Lesbos, Greece.Shirley Williams 2009, 116‚Äì117. The couple moved into a very basic ground-floor apartment in London, on Clarendon Road, Notting Hill. Given how hard it was to find decent housing, they decided instead to share with Helge Rubinstein and her husband, the literary agent Hilary Rubinstein, who at the time was working for his uncle, Victor Gollancz. In 1955 the four of them bought a four-storey, seven-bedroom house in Phillimore Place, Kensington, for ¬£6,800, a home they lived in together for 14 years.Shirley Williams 2009, 120, 136, 154. Williams described it as one of the happiest periods of his life. In 1958, Williams spent a term teaching at the University of Ghana in Legon. When he returned to England in 1959, he was appointed lecturer in philosophy at University College London.Shirley Williams 2009, 132. In 1961, after four miscarriages in four years, Shirley Williams gave birth to their daughter, Rebecca.Shirley Williams, God and Caesar: Personal Reflections on Politics and Religion, A&C; Black, 2004, 17; Shirley Williams 2009, 132, 139. Williams was a visiting professor at Princeton University in 1963, and was appointed Professor of Philosophy at Bedford College, London, in 1964. His wife was elected to parliament that year as the Labour member for Hitchin in Hertfordshire.Shirley Williams 2009, 143, 155. The Sunday Times described the couple two years later as \\"the New Left at its most able, most generous, and sometimes most eccentric.\\" Andy Beckett wrote that they \\"entertained refugees from eastern Europe and politicians from Africa, and drank sherry in noteworthy quantities.\\"Andy Beckett, \\"Centre forward\\", The Guardian, 2 April 2005. Shirley Williams became a junior minister and, in 1971, Shadow Home Secretary. Several newspapers saw her as a future prime minister.Maya Oppenheim, \\"Baroness Shirley Williams: The Lib Dem co-founder once predicted to become the first female prime minister of Britain\\", The Independent, 11 February 2016. She went on to co-found a new centrist party in 1981, the Social Democratic Party; Williams left the Labour Party to join the SDP, although he later returned to Labour. =Cambridge, second marriage= Williams spent over 20 years at King's College, Cambridge, eight of them as provost. In 1967, at the age of 38, Williams became the Knightbridge Professor of Philosophy at the University of Cambridge and a fellow of King's College. According to Jane O'Grady, Williams was central to the decision by King's in 1972 to admit women, one of the first three all-male Oxbridge undergraduate colleges to do so.Jane O'Grady, \\"Professor Sir Bernard Williams\\", The Guardian, 13 June 2003. In both his first and second marriages, he supported his wives in their careers and helped with the children more than was common for men at the time. In the 1970s, when Nussbaum's thesis supervisor, G. E. L. Owen, was harassing female students, and she decided nevertheless to support him, Williams told her, during a walk along the backs at Cambridge: \\"[Y]ou know, there is a price you are paying for this support and encouragement. Your dignity is being held hostage. You really don't have to put up with this.\\"Martha C. Nussbaum, \\"'Don't smile so much': Philosophy and Women in the 1970s,\\" in Linda Mart√≠n Alcoff (ed.), Singing in the Fire: Stories of Women in Philosophy, Lanham: Rowman & Littlefield Publishers, Inc., 2003 (93‚Äì108), 100. Shirley Williams's political career (the House of Commons regularly sat until 10 pm) meant that the couple spent a lot of time apart. They bought a house in Furneux Pelham, Hertfordshire, near the border with south Cambridgeshire, while she lived in Phillimore Place during the week to be close to the Houses of Parliament. Sunday was often the only day they were together.Shirley Williams 2009, 156‚Äì157.\\"Shirley Williams: Views from the peer\\", Hertfordshire Life, 13 January 2010. The differences in their personal values ‚Äì he was an atheist, she a Catholic ‚Äì placed a further strain on their relationship. It reached breaking point in 1970 when Williams formed a relationship with Patricia Law Skinner, a commissioning editor for Cambridge University Press and wife of the historian Quentin Skinner.Mike Peel, Shirley Williams: The Biography, London: Biteback Publishing, 2013, 157. She had approached Williams to write the opposing view of utilitarianism for Utilitarianism: For and Against with J. J. C. Smart (1973), and they had fallen in love. Williams and Skinner began living together in 1971. He obtained a divorce in 1974 (at Shirley Williams' request, the marriage was later annulled). Patricia Williams married him that year, and the couple went on to have two sons, Jacob in 1975 and Jonathan in 1980. Shirley Williams married the political scientist Richard Neustadt in 1987. =Berkeley, Oxford= University of California, Berkeley In 1979 Williams was elected Provost of King's, a position he held until 1987. He spent a semester in 1986 at the University of California, Berkeley as Mills Visiting Professor and in 1988 left England to become Monroe Deutsch Professor of Philosophy there, announcing to the media that he was leaving as part of the \\"brain drain\\" of British academics to America. He was also Sather Professor of Classical Literature at Berkeley in 1989; Shame and Necessity (1995) grew out of his six Sather lectures. Williams returned to England in 1990 as White's Professor of Moral Philosophy at Oxford and fellow of Corpus Christi. His sons had been \\"at sea\\" in California, he said, not knowing what was expected of them, and he had been unable to help. He regretted having made his departure from England so public; he had been persuaded to do so to highlight Britain's relatively low academic salaries. When he retired in 1996, he took up a fellowship again at All Souls. =Royal commissions, committees= All Souls College, Oxford Williams served on several royal commissions and government committees: the Public Schools Commission (1965‚Äì1970), drug abuse (1971), gambling (1976‚Äì1978), the Committee on Obscenity and Film Censorship (1979), and the Commission on Social Justice (1993‚Äì1994). \\"I did all the major vices,\\" he said.\\"Bernard Williams\\", The Economist, 26 June 2003. While on the gambling commission, one of his recommendations, ignored at the time, was for a national lottery. (John Major's government introduced one in 1994.) Mary Warnock described Williams's report on pornography in 1979, as chair of the Committee on Obscenity and Film Censorship, as \\"agreeable, actually compulsive to read.\\"Mary Warnock, \\"The Williams Report on Obscenity and Film Censorship\\", The Political Quarterly, 51(3), July 1980 (341‚Äì344), 341. It relied on a \\"harm condition\\" that \\"no conduct should be suppressed by law unless it can be shown to harm someone,\\" and concluded that so long as children were protected from pornography, adults should be free to read and watch it as they see fit.Bernard Williams (ed.), Obscenity and Film Censorship: An Abridgement of the Williams Report, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2015 [1981], 69.\\"Professor Sir Bernard Williams\\", The Daily Telegraph, 14 June 2003. The report rejected the view that pornography tends to cause sexual offences.Anthony Skillen, \\"Offences Ranked: The Williams Report on Obscenity,\\" Philosophy, 57(220), April 1982 (237‚Äì245), 237. Two cases in particular were highlighted, the Moors Murders and the Cambridge Rapist, where the influence of pornography had been discussed during the trials. The report argued that both cases appeared to be \\"more consistent with pre-existing traits being reflected both in a choice of reading matter and in the acts committed against others.\\"Williams report, 6.7, 85. =Opera= Williams enjoyed opera from an early age, particularly Mozart and Wagner. Patricia Williams writes that he attended performances of the Carl Rosa Company and Sadler's Wells as a teenager.Patricia Williams, \\"Editorial preface,\\" On Opera, New Haven, Yale University Press, 2006, 1. In an essay on Wagner, he described having been reduced to a \\"virtually uncontrollable state\\" during a performance by Jon Vickers as Tristan at Covent Garden.Williams, On Opera, 165; also see Bernard Williams, \\"Wagner & Politics\\", The New York Review of Books, 2 November 2000. He served on the board of the English National Opera from 1968 to 1986, and wrote an entry, \\"The Nature of Opera,\\" for The New Grove Dictionary of Opera.Kenneth Baker, \\"Bernard Williams: Carrying the torch for truth\\", San Francisco Chronicle, 22 September 2002. A collection of his essays, On Opera, was published posthumously in 2006, edited by Patricia Williams.Jerry Fodor, \\"Life in tune\\", The Times Literary Supplement, 17 January 2007. =Honours and death= Williams became a fellow of the British Academy in 1971 and an honorary member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1983. The following year he was made a syndic of the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge and later the chair. In 1993 he was elected to a fellowship of the Royal Society of Arts, and in 1999 he was knighted. Several universities awarded him honorary doctorates, including Yale and Harvard. Williams died of heart failure on 10 June 2003 while on holiday in Rome; he had been diagnosed in 1999 with multiple myeloma, a form of cancer.A. W. Moore, \\"Bernard Williams (1929-2003)\\", Philosophy Now, 2003. He was survived by his wife, their two sons, and his first child, Rebecca. He was cremated in Rome. Writing =Approach to ethics= A. W. Moore writes that Williams' work lies within the analytic tradition, although less typical of it \\"in its breadth, in its erudition, and above all in its profound humanity\\": > Although he was never a vigorous apologist for that tradition, he always > maintained the standards of clarity and rigour which it prizes, and his work > is a model of all that is best in the tradition. It is brilliant, deep, and > imaginative. It is also extraordinarily tight. There cannot be many critics > of his work who have not thought of some objection to what he says, only to > find, on looking for a relevant quotation to turn into a target, that > Williams carefully presents his views in a way that precisely anticipates > the objection. Williams did not produce any ethical theory or system; several commentators noted, unfairly in the view of his supporters, that he was largely a critic. Moore writes that Williams was unaffected by this criticism: \\"He simply refused to allow philosophical system-building to eclipse the subtlety and variety of human ethical experience.\\" He equated ethical theories with \\"a tidiness, a systematicity, and an economy of ideas,\\" writes Moore, that were not up to describing human lives and motives. Williams tried not to lose touch \\"with the real concerns that animate our ordinary ethical experience,\\" unlike much of the \\"arid, ahistorical, second-order\\" debates about ethics in philosophy departments.Larissa MacFarquhar, \\"How to be good\\", The New Yorker, 5 September 2011 (archived). In his first book, Morality: An Introduction to Ethics (1972), Williams wrote that whereas \\"most moral philosophy at most times has been empty and boring ... [c]ontemporary moral philosophy has found an original way of being boring, which is by not discussing moral issues at all.\\"Williams, Morality, 1972, xvii.Onora Nell, \\"Review: Morality: An Introduction to Ethics by Bernard Williams,\\" The Journal of Philosophy 72(12), 1975, 334‚Äì339. He argued that the study of ethics should be vital, compelling and difficult, and he sought an approach that was accountable to psychology and history.Bernard Williams, Ethics and the Limits of Philosophy, Abingdon: Routledge, 2011 [Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1985], 193. Williams was not an ethical realist; unlike scientific knowledge, which can approach an \\"absolute conception of reality,\\" an ethical judgment rests on a point of view.Williams, Ethics and the Limits of Philosophy, 139, 154.A. W. Moore, \\"Realism and the Absolute Conception,\\" in Alan Thomas (ed.), Bernard Williams, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2007, 24‚Äì26. He argued that the \\"thick\\" ethical concepts, such as kindness and cruelty, express a \\"union of fact and value.\\"Williams, Ethics and the Limits of Philosophy, 143‚Äì144.A. W. Moore, \\"Bernard Williams: Ethics and the Limits of Philosophy,\\" in John Shand (ed.), Central Works of Philosophy, Volume 5: The Twentieth Century: Quine and After, Montreal: McGill-Queen's Press, 2006, 217. The idea that our values are not \\"in the world\\" was liberating: \\"[A] radical form of freedom may be found in the fact that we cannot be forced by the world to accept one set of values rather than another.\\"Williams, Ethics and the Limits of Philosophy, 142.Carol Rovane, \\"Did Williams Find the Truth in Relativism?\\" in Daniel Callcut (ed.), Reading Bernard Williams, Abingdon: Routledge, 2009.Bernard Williams, \\"The Truth in Relativism,\\" in Moral Luck: Philosophical Papers 1973-1980, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1981. First published in Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society, LXXV, 1974‚Äì1975, 215‚Äì228. Williams frequently emphasised the ways in which luck pervades ethical life. He coined and developed the term moral luck, and illustrated the idea of moral luck via a number of enormously influential examples. One of Williams's famous examples of moral luck concerns the painter Paul Gauguin's decision to move to Tahiti. =Critique of Kant= Immanuel Kant (1724‚Äì1804) Williams's work throughout the 1970s and 1980s, in Morality: An Introduction to Ethics (1972), Problems of the Self (1973), Utilitarianism: For and Against with J. J. C. Smart (1973), Moral Luck (1981) and Ethics and the Limits of Philosophy (1985), outlined his attacks on the twin pillars of ethics: utilitarianism and the moral philosophy of the 18th-century German philosopher Immanuel Kant. Martha Nussbaum wrote that his work \\"denounced the trivial and evasive way in which moral philosophy was being practised in England under the aegis of those two dominant theories.\\" \\"Both theories simplified the moral life,\\" she wrote, \\"neglecting emotions and personal attachments and how sheer luck shapes our choices.\\"Nussbaum 2009, 213.Bernard Williams, \\"Moral Luck,\\" in Moral Luck, 1981, 20‚Äì39. First published in Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society, supplementary volume 1, 1976, 115‚Äì135. (Williams said in 1996: \\"Roughly, if it isn't about obligation or consequences, it doesn't count.\\") Kant's Grundlegung zur Metaphysik der Sitten (1785) expounded a moral system based on the categorical imperative, one formulation of which is: \\"Act only according to that maxim through which you can at the same time will that it become a universal law.\\" Rational agents must act on \\"principles of pure rational agency,\\" writes Moore; that is, principles that regulate all rational agents. But Williams distinguished between thinking and acting. To think rationally is to think in a way compatible with belief in the truth, and \\"what it takes for one to believe the truth is the same as what it takes for anyone else to believe the truth,\\" writes Moore. But one can act rationally by satisfying one's own desires (internal reasons for action), and what it takes to do that may not be what it takes for anyone else to satisfy theirs. Kant's approach to treating thinking and acting alike is wrong, according to Williams.Moore 2006, 213. Williams argued that Kant had given the \\"purest, deepest and most thorough representation of morality,\\"Williams, Ethics and the Limits of Philosophy, 194. but that the \\"honourable instincts of Kantianism to defend the individuality of individuals against the agglomerative indifference of Utilitarianism\\" may not be effective against the Kantian \\"abstract character of persons as moral agents.\\" We should not be expected to act as though we are not who we are in the circumstances in which we find ourselves.Bernard Williams, \\"Persons, character and morality,\\" in Am√©lie Oksenberg Rorty (ed.), The Identities of Persons, Berkeley: University of California Press, 1976 (197‚Äì216), 200‚Äì201, 215. =Critique of utilitarianism= Williams set out the case against utilitarianism ‚Äì a consequentialist position the simplest version of which is that actions are right only insofar as they promote the greatest happiness of the greatest number ‚Äì in Utilitarianism: For and Against (1973) with J. J. C. Smart. One of the book's thought experiments involves Jim, a botanist doing research in a South American country led by a brutal dictator. Jim finds himself in a small town facing 20 captured Indian rebels. The captain who has arrested them says that if Jim will kill one, the others will be released in honour of Jim's status as a guest, but if he does not, they will all be killed. Simple act utilitarianism would favour Jim killing one of the men.J. J. C. Smart, Bernard Williams, Utilitarianism: For and Against, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1973, 98‚Äì99. Williams argued that there is a crucial distinction between a person being killed by Jim, and being killed by the captain because of an act or omission of Jim's. The captain, if he chooses to kill, is not simply the medium of an effect Jim is having on the world. He is the moral actor, the person with the intentions and projects. The utilitarian loses that distinction, turning us into empty vessels by means of which consequences occur. Williams argued that moral decisions must preserve our psychological identity and integrity.Smart and Williams 1973, 109ff.Daniel Markovits, \\"The architecture of integrity,\\" in Daniel Callcut (ed.), Reading Bernard Williams, Abingdon: Routledge, 2009. We should reject any system that reduces moral decisions to a few algorithms.Williams, Ethics and the Limits of Philosophy, 117. =Reasons for action= Williams argued that there are only internal reasons for action: \\"A has a reason to œÜ if A has some desire the satisfaction of which will be served by his œÜ-ing.\\"Bernard Williams, \\"Internal and external reasons,\\" in Moral Luck, 1981 (101‚Äì113), 101. First published in Ross Harrison (ed.), Rational action, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1979, 17‚Äì28.John Skorupski, \\"Internal reasons and the scope of blame,\\" in Alan Thomas (ed.), Bernard Williams, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2007, 74. An external reason would be \\"A has reason to œÜ,\\" even if nothing in A's \\"subjective motivational set\\" would be furthered by her œÜ-ing. Williams argued that it is meaningless to say that there are external reasons; reason alone does not move people to action.Bernard Williams, \\"Internal Reasons and the Obscurity of Blame,\\" 1989, reprinted in Williams, Making Sense of Humanity, and Other Philosophical Papers 1982‚Äì1993, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1995, 35‚Äì45.Bernard Williams, \\"Replies,\\" in J. E. J. Altham, Ross Harrison (eds.), World, Mind and Ethics: Essays on the Ethical Philosophy of Bernard Williams, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1995.Bernard Williams, \\"Postscript: Some Further Notes on Internal and External Reasons,\\" in Elijah Millgram (ed.), Varieties of Practical Reasoning, Cambridge: MIT Press, 2001.Jenkins 2014, 89. Sophie-Grace Chappell argues that, without external reasons for action, it becomes impossible to maintain that the same set of moral reasons applies to all agents equally.Sophie Grace Chappell, \\"Bernard Williams\\", Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, 8 November 2013 [1 February 2006]. In cases where someone has no internal reason to do what others see as the right thing, they cannot be blamed for failing to do it, because internal reasons are the only reasons, and blame, Williams wrote, \\"involves treating the person who is blamed like someone who had a reason to do the right thing but did not do it.\\"Williams 1989, in Making Sense of Humanity, 42.Skorupski 2007, 93‚Äì94. =Truth= In his final completed book, Truth and Truthfulness: An Essay in Genealogy (2002), Williams identifies the two basic values of truth as accuracy and sincerity, and tries to address the gulf between the demand for truth and the doubt that any such thing exists.David E. Cooper, Truth and Truthfulness: An Essay in Genealogy by Bernard Williams,\\" Philosophy, 78(305), July 2003, 411‚Äì414. Jane O'Grady wrote in a Guardian obituary of Williams that the book is an examination of those who \\"sneer at any purported truth as ludicrously naive because it is, inevitably, distorted by power, class bias and ideology.\\" The debt to Friedrich Nietzsche is clear, most obviously in the adoption of a genealogical method as a tool of explanation and critique. Although part of Williams's intention was to attack those he felt denied the value of truth, the book cautions that, to understand it simply in that sense, would be to miss part of its purpose; rather, as Kenneth Baker wrote, it is \\"Williams' reflection on the moral cost of the intellectual vogue for dispensing with the concept of truth.\\" Legacy Williams did not propose any systematic philosophical theory; indeed, he was suspicious of any such attempt.Daniel Callcut, \\"Introduction,\\" in Callcut 2009, 1‚Äì2. He became known for his dialectical powers, although he was suspicious of them too. Alan Code wrote that Williams had never been \\"impressed by the display of mere dialectical cleverness, least of all in moral philosophy\\": > On the contrary, one of the most notable features of his philosophical > outlook was an unwavering insistence on a series of points that may seem > obvious but which are nevertheless all-too-frequently neglected: that moral > or ethical thought is part of human life; that in writing about it, > philosophers are writing about something of genuine importance; that it is > not easy to say anything worth saying about the subject; that what moral > philosophers write is answerable to the realities of human history, > psychology, and social affairs; and that mere cleverness is indeed not the > relevant measure of value.\\" In 1996 Martin Hollis said that Williams had \\"a good claim to be the leading British philosopher of his day,\\" but that, although he had a \\"lovely eye for the central questions,\\" he had none of the answers. Alan Thomas identified Williams's contribution to ethics as an overarching scepticism about attempts to create a foundation for moral philosophy, explicitly articulated in Ethics and the Limits of Philosophy (1985) and Shame and Necessity (1993), in which he argued that moral theories can never reflect the complexities of life, particularly given the radical pluralism of modern societies.Alan Thomas, \\"Williams, Bernard,\\" in Robert Audi (ed.), The Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy, Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1999 (2nd edition), 975. Learning to be yourself, to be authentic and to act with integrity, rather than conforming to any external moral system, is arguably the fundamental motif of Williams's work, according to Sophie Grace Chappell. \\"If there's one theme in all my work it's about authenticity and self-expression,\\" Williams said in 2002. \\"It's the idea that some things are in some real sense really you, or express what you and others aren't ... The whole thing has been about spelling out the notion of inner necessity.\\" He moved moral philosophy away from the Kantian question, \\"What is my duty?\\", and back to the issue that mattered to the Greeks: \\"How should we live?\\" Publications Books *(with Alan Montefiore, eds.)

Jean Ribault (also spelled Ribaut) (1520 ‚Äì October 12, 1565) was a French naval officer, navigator, and a colonizer of what would become the southeastern United States. He was a major figure in the French attempts to colonize Florida. A Huguenot and officer under Admiral Gaspard de Coligny, Ribault led an expedition to the New World in 1562 that founded the outpost of Charlesfort on Parris Island in present-day South Carolina. Timucuan King Saturiwa (North Florida). Mighty chief and friend of Jean Ribault and Ren√© Goulaine de Laudonni√®re Two years later, he took over command of the French colony of Fort Caroline in what is now Jacksonville, Florida. He and many of his followers were massacred by Spanish soldiers near St. Augustine.  Biography  =Early life and first colony= Ribault was born in the town of Dieppe in Normandy in 1520. He entered the French navy under the command of the great Huguenot admiral Gaspard de Coligny. In 1562 Coligny chose him to lead an expedition to the New World to found a colony. Leaving France on February 18 with a fleet of 150 colonists, he crossed the Atlantic Ocean and explored the mouth of the St. Johns River in modern-day Jacksonville, Florida. He named it the \\"River May\\", as this was the month when he found it, and erected a stone column claiming the territory for France. Ribault's fleet then proceeded north, charting more of the coastline and noting several rivers. Eventually, they came to the Port Royal Sound in present-day South Carolina, and Ribault elected to establish a settlement on Parris Island, one of the Sea Islands off the coast. Ribault oversaw the layout of a small fort, which was named Charlesfort in honor of the French king Charles IX. Ribault left 27 men under the command of Albert de la Pierria to man the fort and soon set sail for France. Ribault's intention was to collect supplies for Charlesfort and return by the end of the year. When he arrived at Le Havre, however, he discovered the French Wars of Religion had broken out between the Roman Catholic majority and the Protestant Huguenots. Ribault assisted the Huguenots at Dieppe but was forced to flee to England when the city fell. While in England, he managed to gain an audience with Queen Elizabeth I and organized some backers for a plan to settle in America. However, despite this cordial welcome, he was soon arrested and detained in the Tower of London as a spy. During his time in England, and probably while imprisoned, Ribault wrote an account of the voyage, which survives only in English translation. The 1563 Peace of Amboise finally allowed Coligny to devote attention for a new voyage to North America. He appointed Ribault's former lieutenant, Ren√© Goulaine de Laudonni√®re, to replace Ribault in the North American endeavors. During this time, however, Charlesfort had fallen into despair. Captain Albert de la Pierria's heavy discipline led the soldiers to a mutiny in which he was deposed and killed at Florida on October 12, 1565. Afterward, a fire destroyed most of the settlement's meager stores. The survivors elected to build a crude vessel and attempt to sail back to France. The trip was arduous, and most of the participants died before they finally reached the English coast, where they were rescued. News of this reached France just before Laudonni√®re had embarked on his voyage. File:Dieppe-France- Map-Birthplace-of-Jean-Ribault.jpgalt=Dieppe, France.

The plan for Ribault was to follow him in Spring 1565 with reinforcements and fresh supplies. As Charlesfort was now abandoned, the expedition decided to found a new colony on the banks of the St. Johns River in what is now Jacksonville, Florida, the same area Ribault and company had explored on the prior voyage. They christened the settlement Fort Caroline.

Historic Fort Caroline and St. Augustine 1565.jpgalt=Map showing location of Fort Caroline and St. Augustine Map showing location of Fort Caroline and St. Augustine Fort Caroline sustained itself for the next year, but Ribault found himself caught up in the fresh outbreak of war in France and was unable to set sail at the appointed time. As a result, the colony experienced food shortages and deteriorating conditions, and some soldiers mutinied and became pirates, attacking Spanish vessels in the Caribbean. The situation was exacerbated by a clash with the Utina, a Timucua Indian tribe up the river to the south. Ribault finally organized his fleet in the summer of 1565, ultimately departing from France with 800 new settlers and five ships. He arrived in Florida on August 28, just as the despairing Laudonni√®re was preparing to sail home. Ribault promptly relieved Laudonni√®re as governor and assumed command of Fort Caroline. In the meantime, the Spanish, who had long maintained a claim over Florida, had made preparations to find and oust the French from Fort Caroline. In early September Pedro Men√©ndez de Avil√©s, newly appointed adelantado of Florida, encountered Ribault's ships at anchor off the River of May. After a brief naval skirmish, the French ships cut their anchor lines and fled, and Men√©ndez retreated to the next inlet to the south, landing his men on 7 September and establishing the settlement of St. Augustine. =Disaster= Ribault is wrecked on the coast of Florida Marker at Fort Matanzas National Monument showing the location where Jean Ribault and his men were slaughtered by Pedro Men√©ndez de Avil√©s in September 1565. The Spanish hastily threw up palm-log and earthworks around an existing Timucua Indian village at their newly founded settlement and began unloading their ships. Before all of the equipment and supplies could be unloaded, Men√©ndez sent his flagship San Pelayo away to Hispaniola, as it was too big to enter the St. Augustine Inlet and Men√©ndez expected an attack from Ribault. Jean Ribault did attack only hours later, and almost captured Men√©ndez who was on a smaller vessel offshore, but the Spaniard risked crossing the sandbar at the mouth of the inlet and made it to the harbor. As the French galleons were also too large to cross the inlet, Ribault took his fleet south to pursue San Pelayo when the hurricane struck on September 11, driving his ships further south to their destruction on the Canaveral coast. Assuming that the majority of the French men at arms were on board Ribault's ships leaving Fort Caroline defenseless, Men√©ndez ordered his infantrymen to march 40 miles north to Fort Caroline, during the hurricane. On 20 September, the Spanish captured the now lightly defended French settlement; 140 men were immediately put to death. In the eyes of the king of Spain, the Protestant religion and acts of piracy committed from Fort Caroline made the entire settlement a dangerous nest of pirates, heretics, and trespassers on Spanish territory. Only about 60 women and children were spared. Ren√© Laudonni√®re and about 40 others escaped the wrath of the Spaniards, and eventually returned to Europe to tell their tales. The same hurricane that masked the approach of Men√©ndez's troops on Fort Caroline, utterly destroyed all of Ribault's fleet, driving them up on the beach many miles south of their intended target. Several hundred soldiers and sailors made it ashore barely alive and then walked from near present-day Daytona Beach to Matanzas Inlet, 14 miles south of St. Augustine. The marooned sailors were soon tracked down by Men√©ndez and a patrol force of Spanish troops, probably under a hundred men. Ribault, believing his hungry men would be fed and decently treated, allowed himself to be bluffed into surrender. In batches of ten, the Frenchmen were rowed across to the mainland, hands tied behind their backs. Following the explicit orders of King Philip II of Spain, the prisoners were asked if they were professing Catholics. Those who were not were marched behind a dune and put to the knife by Men√©ndez's Spanish soldiers. Only a handful of Catholics, young musicians and ship's boys were spared their lives. A similar surrender and mass execution of a smaller group of Frenchmen followed a few days later. This time, a few Frenchmen, suspicious of their enemies, preferred to take their chances with the Native Americans. Altogether, Ribault and about 350 of his officers and men lost their lives in the two massacres.

It was produced by The Kerner Entertainment Company and Avnet‚ÄìKerner Productions and distributed by Walt Disney Pictures. It was the first film in The Mighty Ducks film series. In some countries, the film was released with the title Champions, while home release copies were printed with the title as The Mighty Ducks Are the Champions to avoid confusion with the title of the sequel. The year after the film's release, Disney founded an NHL hockey team, named the \\"Mighty Ducks of Anaheim\\" after the film. Plot Gordon Bombay (Emilio Estevez) is an arrogant but successful Minneapolis defense attorney. After his 30th successful case, he celebrates by going out drinking, but is arrested for drunk driving and sentenced to 500 hours of community service by coaching the local \\"District 5\\" Pee-Wee hockey team. Bombay has an unpleasant history with the sport: in 1973, he was the Hawks‚Äô star player but, struggling with the loss of his father, he missed a penalty shot in the championship game, disappointing his hyper- competitive coach, Jack Reilly (Lane Smith). The Hawks went on to lose in overtime, becoming one of their only championship defeats. Bombay meets the District 5 team, and realizes the children have no practice facility, equipment, or ability. Their first game with Bombay at the helm is against the Hawks. Reilly is still the Hawks' head coach and, despite a nearly unbroken championship streak, remains bitter about Gordon's missed penalty shot. District 5 is soundly defeated as Reilly demands the Hawks run up the score. Bombay berates the team for not listening to him, and the players challenge his authority. For the next match, Bombay tries to teach his team how to dive and draw penalties, which results in another loss ‚Äì this time to the Jets ‚Äì angering the team further. Specifically one player Charlie Conway (Joshua Jackson), who refused to fake an injury like Bombay instructed him to. Bombay visits his old mentor Hans (Joss Ackland), who owns a nearby sporting goods store and was in attendance at the game against the Hawks. While there, Bombay recalls that he quit playing hockey after losing his father four months before the championship game, and because Reilly blamed him for the loss due to the missed penalty shot. Hans encourages him to rekindle his childhood passion for the sport by skating in a frozen pond like he did when he was a kid. Realizing the error of his ways, he apologizes to Charlie and his mother at their home. Bombay approaches his boss, Gerald Ducksworth (Josef Sommer), to sponsor the team, allowing them to purchase professional-grade equipment as opposed to the makeshift equipment they had, and give Bombay time to teach the players fundamentals. Renamed the Ducks ‚Äì after Ducksworth ‚Äì the team fights its next game against the Cardinals to a tie. They recruit three new players: Figure skating siblings Tommy (Danny Tamberelli) and Tammy Duncan (Jane Plank), and slap shot specialist and enforcer Fulton Reed (Elden Henson). The potential of Charlie catches Bombay's eye; he takes Charlie under his wing and teaches him some of the tactics he used playing with the Hawks. Bombay learns that, due to redistricting, the Hawks‚Äô star player Adam Banks (Vincent LaRusso) lives in District Five and should be playing for the Ducks, and threatens Reilly into transferring Banks to the Ducks. After overhearing an out-of-context quote about the team, most of the players walk out (except Charlie and Fulton who form a strong friendship), resulting in a loss on forfeit to the Flames. The Ducks lose faith in Bombay and revert to their old habits except Charlie and Fulton. Ducksworth makes a deal with Reilly for the Hawks to keep Banks, which Bombay, although initially tempted, refuses on the principles of fair play, which Ducksworth berated him about when he started his community service. Left with the choice of letting his team down or being fired from his job, he takes the latter. Bombay manages to regain his players‚Äô trust after they win a crucial match against the Huskies in order to qualify for the playoffs, and Banks ‚Äì who decided to play with the Ducks rather than not play hockey at all ‚Äì proves to be an asset though Jesse doesn‚Äôt trust him. The Ducks march through the playoffs with wins against the Hornets and the Cardinals, reaching the championship game against the Hawks. Reilly orders his team to injure Banks to force him out of the game; in spite of this, the Ducks manage to tie late in the final period, and Charlie is tripped by a Hawks player as time expires. In precisely the same situation Bombay faced at the film‚Äôs beginning, Charlie prepares for a game-deciding penalty shot. In stark contrast to Reilly ‚Äì who told Bombay that if he missed, he was letting everyone down ‚Äì Bombay tells Charlie to take his best shot and that he will believe in him no matter what. Inspired, Charlie fakes out the goalie with a \\"triple-deke\\" Bombay taught him and scores, winning the state championship. The Ducks players and their families race onto the ice in jubilation, where Bombay thanks Hans for his belief in him and Hans tells Bombay he is proud of him. Later, Bombay boards a bus to a minor-league tryout, secured for him by the NHL's Basil McRae of the Minnesota North Stars. Although daunted at the prospect of going up against younger players, he receives the same words of encouragement and advice from the Ducks he had given them, promising to return next season to defend their title. Cast Production The film was written by Steve Brill, who later sued for royalties for the film. Jake Gyllenhaal turned down the role of Charlie Conway. Emilio Estevez was cast in 1991, after Herek was impressed by his performances in Brat Pack films, The Outsiders (1983), The Breakfast Club (1985) and St. Elmo's Fire (1985). It was filmed in several locations in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Reception = Box office = The film grossed $50,752,337 in the United States and Canada, becoming a surprising success with audiences, which in turn inspired two sequels and an animated TV series (the latter taking on a science fiction angle with actual anthropomorphic ducks). While neither sequel's box-office total matched that of the first movie, they were still financially successful. The Mighty Ducks made $54 million in home video rentals according to Video Week magazine in 1992. = Critical reception = The film holds a 23% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, based on 30 reviews, with an average rating of 4/10. The site's consensus reads, \\"The Mighty Ducks has feel-good goals, but only scores a penalty shot for predictability\\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"A\\" on an A+ to F scale. Roger Ebert said the film was 'sweet and innocent, and that at a certain level it might appeal to younger kids. I doubt if its ambitions reach much beyond that', and gave it a 2 star rating. Rita Kempley of The Washington Post described the film as 'Steven Brill, who has a small role in the film, constructed the screenplay much as one would put together some of those particleboard bookcases from Ikea.' Emilio Estevez was surprised at the popularity of the movie series. Accolades The film is recognized by American Film Institute in these lists: * 2006: AFI's 100 Years...100 Cheers ‚Äì Nominated * 2008: AFI's 10 Top 10: ** Nominated Sports Film Home media The film was released on DVD on April 11, 2000, and on Blu-ray Disc on May 23, 2017.

The mountains cover an area of approximately 550,000 square km (212,000 square miles). Geography An oasis in the Hoggar Mountains thumb This mountainous region is located about south of the capital, Algiers. The area is largely rocky desert with an average elevation of more than above sea level. The highest peak, Mount Tahat, is at . The mountains are primarily composed of metamorphic rock approximately 2 billion years old, although there are areas where more recent volcanic activity has laid down much newer rock. Several of the more dramatic peaks, such as Ilamen, are the result of erosion wearing away extinct volcano domes, leaving behind the more resistant material that plugged the volcanic cores. Assekrem is a famous and often visited point where Charles de Foucauld built a hermitage in 1911. The main city near the Hoggar Mountains is Tamanrasset, built in a desert valley or wadi. Environment The Hoggar Mountain range typically experiences hot summers, with a cold winter climate. Temperatures fall below freezing in the winter. Rainfall is rare and sporadic year-round. However, since the climate is less extreme than in most other areas of the Sahara, the Hoggar Mountains are a major location for biodiversity, including number of relict species. The Hoggar Mountains are part of the West Saharan montane xeric woodlands ecoregion. The Hoggar mountains are home to the Ahaggar National Park, one of the national parks of the country. The tallest peak in the Hoggar range, Mount Tahat is located in the park area, which covers approximately . =Fauna and flora= Slightly to the west of the Hoggar range, a population of the endangered African wild dog (Lycaon pictus) remained viable into the 20th century, but is now thought to be extirpated within this entire region. Analysis of collected scat in 2006 showed the presence of the Northwest African cheetah in the region. Between August 2008 and November 2010, four individuals were recorded by camera traps. A single cheetah was filmed and photographed by Algerian naturalists in 2020 in the national park in the Atakor volcanic field whose peaks approach a height of . Relict populations of the West African crocodile persisted in the Hoggar Mountains until the early 20th century. The park also contains a population of herbivores such as the saharan subspecies of the barbary sheep and the Dorcas gazelle. Vegetation in this area includes trees such as Vachellia tortilis, Vachellia seyal, myrtle and Tamarix aphylla which are scattered throughout the area. Other plants may include Citrullus colocynthis and Calotropis procera. Cultural significance Prehistoric settlement is evident from extant rock paintings dating to 6000 BC. The Hoggar Massif is the land of the Kel Ahaggar Tuareg. The tomb of Tin Hinan, the woman believed to be the matriarch of the Tuareg, is located at Abalessa, an oasis near Tamanrasset.

The term is most often used for Latin, where it is one of the four principal parts of a verb. The word refers to a position of lying on one's back (as opposed to 'prone', lying face downward), but there exists no widely accepted etymology that explains why or how the term came to be used to also describe this form of a verb. Latin There are two supines, I (first) and II (second). They are originally the accusative and dative or ablative forms of a verbal noun in the fourth declension, respectively. =First supine= The first supine ends in -um. It has two uses. The first supine comes with verbs of motion. In one usage, it indicates purpose. For example, \\"mater pompam me spectatum duxit\\" is Latin for \\"Mother took me to watch the procession\\", and \\"legati ad Caesarem gratulatum convenerunt\\" is Latin for \\"Ambassadors came to Caesar to congratulate him\\". The translation of this first usage of the first supine is similar to, if not identical to, the Latin clause of purpose. A second usage is in combination with the future passive infinitive. In this second usage it indicates fate; for example \\"occisum iri\\" means \\"to be going to be killed\\". It mostly appears in indirect statements, for example \\"occisum iri a Milone video\\", meaning \\"I foresee that he is going to be killed by Milo\\". =Second supine= The second supine, which comes with adjectives, is rarely used; only a few verbs have been seen to commonly adopt the form. It is derived from the dative of purpose, which expresses the purpose of a thing or action, or the ablative of respect, which can translate as \\"with regard/respect to\\" and is used to indicate to what extent or in what way the main clause is true. It is the same as the first supine but replacing final -um by -≈´, with a lengthened u. Mirabile dict≈´, for example, translates as \\"amazing to say\\", where dict≈´ is the supine form. The sense is generally passive, even if usually not explicitly marked as such in idiomatic English translation; for example, difficile credit≈´, \\"hard to believe\\", is more literally \\"hard to be believed\\", or \\"hardly believable\\". Germanic languages In English grammar, the term \\"supine\\" is sometimes used to refer to the to-infinitive. The to-infinitive is seen in sentences like \\"To err is human; to forgive divine.\\" In Swedish, the supine is used with an auxiliary verb to produce some compound verb forms (perfect forms). See Swedish grammar. In Icelandic grammar, sagnb√≥t (usually translated as \\"supine\\") is a verbal form identical to the neuter participle, used to form certain verb tenses. Finnic languages In Estonian, the supine is called \\"ma-tegevusnimi\\" (lit. \\"ma-action name\\") because all the words in supine have \\"ma\\" in the end (as in \\"tegema\\", \\"jooksma\\", \\"k√µndima\\"), and they act similarly to the Latin example. The supine is also the common dictionary form for verbs. Romance languages In Romanian, the supine generally corresponds to an English construction like for doing: \\"AceastƒÉ carte este de citit\\" means \\"This book is for reading\\". Slavic languages The Slovene and the Lower Sorbian supine is used after verbs of movement; see Slovenian verbs. The supine was used in Proto-Slavic but it was replaced in most Slavic languages by the infinitive in later periods. Baltic languages In some dialects of Lithuanian, the supine is used with verbs of motion to indicate purpose: Moterys eina miestan duonos pirkt≈≥ , which means \\"The women are going to the town to buy some bread\\". The standard language uses the infinitive, pirkti, instead of the supine. In the past, the supine was much more widespread form than now.

Mattingly Code of the Lifemaker is a 1983 novel by British science fiction author James P. Hogan. NASA's Advanced Automation for Space Missions was the direct inspiration for this novel detailing first contact between Earth explorers and the Taloids, clanking replicators who have colonized Saturn's moon Titan. A sequel titled The Immortality Option was published in 1995. Plot summary About 1,000,000 B.C., an unidentified alien race sent out robotic factories to many worlds in their part of the galaxy to prepare for future settlement. One of those factory ships suffers severe radiation damage from a near-miss by a supernova and goes off course, drifting in space for a hundred thousand years before landing on the Saturnian moon Titan. Due to a malfunction in its database, it begins producing imperfect copies that begin to evolve on their own. (The description of this background is presented in a prologue that proved sufficiently popular among readers that it was later anthologized on its own in a collection of Hogan's short fiction.) The resulting machine ecosystem eventually gives rise to humanoid robots with human-like intellects, who develop a civilization similar to early civilization of Earth. Almost all of them have reverence for their mythical creator, a being they call the \\"Lifemaker\\". Early in the 21st century, the North Atlantic Space Organization (combining NASA and NATO) dispatched the Orion with a cover story of terraforming Mars for human habitation. Karl Zambendorf, a con artist who is present on this expedition to verify ESP over interplanetary distances, prematurely learns that the Orion and its crew of researchers is headed for Titan, where the discovery of the Taloids has been kept need-to-know on Earth. When the Orion arrives, the first landing party sets down in a freethinking state where Thirg, a Taloid who was cast out of his home state Kroaxia, has fled. They are mistaken for the Lifemaker because they have come from the sky, which the Taloids cannot see out of due to Titan's atmosphere. But Thirg becomes more discerning as he and the humans begin to understand more of each other's speech. Thirg's brother Groork has come from Kroaxia to apprehend him, but Zambendorf intercepts him and sends him back to Kroaxia as a prophet. Zambendorf learned that NASO plans to exploit Titan's natural resources and use the Taloids to build the factories they need, reducing them to slaves. The NASO business administrators on the Orion are already in agreement with the Kroaxian government to use human (the Taloids call humans \\"Lumians\\" because they glow brightly in their infrared vision) weapons to conquer Titan, believing the Kroaxian leadership buttressed by priests will be the easiest to control. Zambendorf, in his unanticipated role as Messenger for the Lifemaker, has given Groork guidelines akin to the Ten Commandments for his people to prevent a war from starting. \\"All Taloids are brothers\\" and \\"No Taloid is to enslave or be a slave\\" does not sit well with the ruling establishment of Kroaxia, and Groork is saved by the Orion crew not working for NASO. There will be use of Titan's resources, but the partnership between humans and Taloids will be one of equals.

The ACOG was originally designed to be used on the M16 rifle and M4 carbine, but Trijicon has also developed ACOG accessories for other firearms. Models provide fixed power magnification levels from 1.5√ó to 6√ó. ACOG reticles are illuminated at night by an internal phosphor. Some versions have an additional daytime reticle illumination via a passive external fiber optic light pipe or are LED- illuminated using a battery. The first ACOG model, known as the TA01, was released in 1987. History The first ACOG model, known as the TA01, was released in 1987. Design The ACOG is available in a variety of configurations from the manufacturer with different reticles, illumination, and other features. Most ACOGs do not use batteries for reticle illumination,thefirearmblog.com - Oct 2011, Trijicon came out with a conventional battery-powered illumination ACOG being designed to use internal phosphor illumination provided by the radioactive decay of tritium. The tritium illumination has a usable life of 10‚Äì15 years.Tritium has a half-life of 12.5 years Some versions of the ACOG have an additional daytime reticle illumination via a passive external fiber optic light pipe. Normally this allows the brightness of the reticle to match the field of view since it collects ambient light from around the sight, although this can lead to a mismatch in lighting - such as sunlight hitting the light pipe directly, or standing in a shadow - causing the reticle to be much brighter or darker than the target. Reticles have other features such as a bullet drop compensator and other different reticle shapes such as chevrons. Some ACOG models incorporate rudimentary ghost ring iron sights as a backup for targets that are within . Most ACOG models, when mounted to a carry handle, have an open space through the mount to allow the use of the rifle's iron sights without removing the scope. Others include Docter or Trijicon reflex sights mounted on top. The ACOG ECOS line features both of these secondary sighting systems on the same scope. Other features include Picatinny rails, flip caps, and the ability to be waterproof up to . Although the ACOG is designed for the Picatinny rail of the M16A4 and M4, it can be mounted on the carrying handles of previous models by using a special adapter. Trijicon later produced ACOG mounts and adapters for weapons besides the M16, including the Beretta AR70/90 series; SIG SG 550, Heckler & Koch HK416, Bushmaster ACR, Enfield L85A2, and FN SCAR weapon systems; and the Steyr AUG. Bindon aiming concept Several ACOG models are designed to be used with the \\"Bindon Aiming Concept\\", an aiming technique developed by Trijicon founder and optical designer Glyn Bindon. The technique is essentially using the illuminated part of the reticle and its focusing rear eyepiece as a collimator sight.Jane's international defense review: IDR., Volume 34, Issues 1-6 As in any other collimator sight, the user does not actually look through the sight but instead keeps the collimated (infinity) image of the illuminated part of the reticle in focus with the dominant eye while the other eye views the entire field of view to acquire the target. In this both-eyes-open technique the brain superimposes the aiming reticle on the target. An added part of the technique is to shift focus after acquisition to the dominant eye/telescopic image for more accurate shooting. This overcomes the problem of centering or acquiring fast traversing targets common with all telescopic sights. Only certain models of the ACOG are designed with bright enough daylight-lit fiber optic or battery-powered LED reticles that facilitate this technique. Controversy Trijicon has been the subject of some criticism for inscribing a reference to a Bible verse (JN8:12, referring to John 8:12, \\"I am the Light of the World\\") alongside the model numbers on their ACOG sights. Starting in late 2009, Trijicon began shipping sights to the U.S. military without the Bible verse.

Enterolobium cyclocarpum, commonly known as guanacaste, caro caro, monkey-ear tree or elephant-ear tree, is a species of flowering tree in the pea family, Fabaceae, that is native to tropical regions of the Americas, from central Mexico south to northern Brazil (Roraima) and Venezuela.USDA (1994), Niembro Rocas (2002) It is known for its large proportions, its expansive, often spherical crown, and its curiously shaped seedpods. The abundance of this tree, especially in Guanacaste Province, Costa Rica, where it is prized for the shady relief it provides from the intense sun, coupled with its immensity, have made it a widely recognized species. It is the national tree of Costa Rica. North America it is often called elephant- ear tree, due to the shape of the seedpods. Other common names include Devil's ear and earpod tree, parota and orej√≥n (Spanish) or huanacaxtle (Nahuatl). In El Salvador, it is known as conacaste.Witsberger et al. (1982) In the Yucatan peninsula, it is known by the Mayan name, pich. In Panama it is known as a corot√∫.  DescriptionNiembro Rocas (2002), Harmon (2008), PIER (2008)  The guanacaste is a medium-sized to large tree, growing to 25‚Äì35 m tall, with a trunk up to 3.5 m in diameter. Unusual in a tree of these proportions, buttresses are completely lacking. The bark is light gray, with prominent dark reddish-brown vertical fissures. In young trees these fissures are closer together. and their confluence lends a characteristic reddish hue to the bark of guanacaste saplings. Older specimens often present broken, chipped or scarred bark. The crown is broad and widely spreading. The height at which branches first occur along the trunk ‚Äì as well as the overall tree shape ‚Äì vary considerably among individuals and are habitat-dependent characteristics. Frequently, guanacaste trees grow as single specimens in a sunny pasture. Under these conditions, massive, extended, horizontal limbs emerge low on the boles, forming giant, hemispherical, widely spreading crowns. In the forest (where competition for light is intense) trees tend to become taller, and branching occurs at a higher level. Tree forms then become somewhat narrower, though crowns are still rounded, and hemispherical shapes are maintained by those that have reached the canopy. The alternate leaves are bipinnate compound, 15‚Äì40 cm long and 17 cm broad with a 2‚Äì6 cm petiole bearing 4‚Äì15 pairs of pinnae, each pinna with 40‚Äì70 leaflets; the leaflets are slender oblong, 8‚Äì15 mm long by 2‚Äì4 mm wide. Near its base, the twiggy petiole bares a small, raised, oval gland. The leaves are confined to the outer shell of the crown, yet they are plentiful enough to make it moderately dense and green. The guanacaste is evergreen, or briefly deciduous for 1‚Äì2 months during the dry season. Most foliage is shed in December, at the start of the dry season. In late February, a growth surge is initiated that re-establishes a fresh, thick crown by April. Concurrent with the leaves' renewal is the appearance of globular inflorescences (3 cm) in the axils of the new leaves. Supported by a long pedestal (4 cm), each spherical white head ‚Äì composed of about fifty individual flowers ‚Äì sports thousands of thin, filamentous stamens as its major feature. The blossoms themselves each consist of about twenty stamens and a single pistil, bound together at the base by a short, green, tubular corolla and an even shorter calyx, just 5 mm long altogether. Guanacaste flowers are very fragrant, and during intense flowering periods their odor permeates the air for many meters in all directions. In Manuel Antonio National Park near Quepos, Costa Rica, flowering lasts from late February to early April. Surprisingly, no obvious fruiting activity immediately follows the decline of the blossom. Rather, nine or ten months pass before small, green pods first appear high in the crown by December. They reach full size by February and finally begin to ripen in March ‚Äì a full year after flowering has ceased. Fruit ripening lasts from March to April, as the green pods turn brown in the guanacaste crown and are slowly shed. Vigorous trees will produce large crops on a nearly annual basis. In June, guanacaste seedlings can already be seen, germinating in the moist soil of the early rainy season. Guanacaste fruits are large (7‚Äì12 cm diameter), glossy dark brown indehiscent and spirally-organized pods, shaped like orbicular disks. Their shape suggests the usual Mimosoideae fruit ‚Äì a long, narrow, flattened pod ‚Äì taken and wound around an axis perpendicular to its plane. Made of thick, soft tissue with a leathery feel, the pods contain 8-20 radially arranged seeds, 14.5‚Äì17.5 mm long, 7.8‚Äì11.2 mm wide, and 6.2‚Äì7.2 mm thick and weighing about 1 g. Guanacaste seeds are brown and marked with a conspicuous light brown or orange ring. They are very hard, resembling small stones rather than tree seeds in their strength and durability. In order for germination to occur, the hard seed coat must be broken to enable water to reach the embryo. Otherwise, the seeds will lie dormant indefinitely. The ardillo (Cojoba arborea) and the iguano (Dilodendron costaricense) possess similar bipinnate leaves with extra- fine leaflets. Though of equally impressive stature, these two trees can be distinguished readily from the guanacaste: the ardillo has tan-colored, heavily wrinkled and rough bark ‚Äì nothing like the guanacaste's unmistakably gray and vertically cracked cortex. The iguano's leaflets are serrate (an unusual feature in a bipinnate tree), while those of the guanacaste are entire.  Ecology  Branches and foliage of a young Enterolobium cyclocarpum, about 3 years old, in Naiguata, Venezuela Guanacaste trees appear to delay the onset of fruit development‚Äîsome nine months‚Äîso that seed maturation will coincide with the start of the rainy season. This adaptive behavior presumably is an adaptation to give germinating seedlings as much time as possible to establish root systems before the start of the next dry season. Both the jatob√° (Hymenaea courbaril) and the cenizaro (Albizia saman) exhibit similar reproductive strategies. Of course, guanacaste trees‚Äîlike all deciduous and semi-deciduous species in this part of the world‚Äîshare in the water-conserving benefits of dry-season leaflessness. Guanacaste flowers are heavily visited by bees‚Äîinsects that probably are responsible for pollination as well. Guanacaste seed pods, however, are completely ignored by native fauna and they accumulate on the forest floor underneath parent trees. The seeds are not eaten by any animals currently native where the tree occurs,Harmon (2008) rendering the plant an evolutionary anachronism: it has been suggested that guanacaste pods were among the foods exploited by certain species of Pleistocene megafauna that became extinct some 10,000 years ago (e.g. giant ground sloths, giant bison).Janzen & Martin (1982) Within this scenario, the tree remains today without an effective seed-dispersing vector besides humans. As discussed above, the tough-coated guanacaste seeds do not begin to grow unless their protective covers are punctured in some way. This may be an adaptation designed to keep the seeds from germinating while still in the pods at the start of the rainy season‚Äîand very likely still underneath the parent tree after having fallen from its crown. With more time to find them, foraging ground sloths (and other extinct mammals) could eat the pods and transport the seeds to a new site. The resulting mastication and digestion of the fruits would induce seed coat abrasion, which would help seed germination. Nowadays this role of mastication and dispersal has been taken up primarily by horses and cattle. An insect pest, common to guanacaste trees of the Costa Rican Central Valley, produces spherical green galls of 1.5 cm diameter on new shoots in February and March. Similar parasitism seems to occur on guanacaste trees of the wet, southwestern lowlands (around Palmar Sur).Allen (1956)  Cultivation and uses  An anole lizard climbing a cultivated guanacaste seedling in southern Florida The guanacaste is among the most majestic and aesthetically pleasing of tree species in its native range. Tolerant of a wide range of rainfall levels, temperatures and soil conditions, they can thrive in most low-elevation, tropical habitats. Guanacaste trees are highly valued as ornamentals, and the shade they provide creates many an oasis on the searing and sun-baked plains in its Pacific slope habitat. It is widely grown as a shade tree to shelter coffee plantations and for shade and forage for cattle; it also improves soil fertility by nitrogen fixation.Niembro Rocas (2002) The guanacaste is found in USDA Growth Zones 10-12. The wood is reddish-brown, lightweight (density 0.34‚Äì0.6 g/cm3) and water-resistant; it is used to make items such as doors, windows, furniture, cabinets, and for shipbuilding.Allen (1956), Niembro Rocas (2002) It is considered a relatively sustainable resource for wooden furniture and design projects, largely due to the tree's ability to quickly reach large sizes, which also makes it easier to find large natural cuts up to several meters, which is rare for other slower-growing woods, such as oak or cedar. The town of La Cruz de Huanacaxtle in Nayarit (Mexico) derives its name from the fact that a cross used to stand there made of guanacaste wood. While the seed pods are still green, they are harvested and the seeds eaten boiled in Mexico. Healthy guanacaste trees generate massive, nearly annual crops of seeds. The attractive seeds are used in Costa Rica to make jewelry. In parts of Panama the ripe seeds are heated in a fire until they pop like pop-corn. These seeds demonstrate germination rates of nearly 100%. Guanacaste seedlings then grow rapidly, often reaching over one meter in height in their first year of life. These aggressive reproductive characteristics might be beneficially exploited in reforestation projects; on the other hand, the plant is considered an invasive species in some places.PIER (2008) Its roots are strong, and those of large trees may damage nearby structures. Guanacaste is commonly used to feed all kind of livestock: its foliage as well as its fruits and seeds are relished by cattle, pigs, goats, sheep and horses.Heuz√© V., Thiollet H., Tran G., Boval M., Lebas F., 2018. Guanacaste (Enterolobium cyclocarpum). Feedipedia, a programme by INRA, CIRAD, AFZ and FAO. https://www.feedipedia.org/node/296 The parota tree is believed to provide medical benefits. In Mexican folk medicine, the sap is thought to aid illnesses such as the flu and bronchitis, while the astringent properties of its green fruit is used for diarrhea. The fruit and bark also contain tannins, which are useful for leather curing and soap manufacturing, while the sap can be used as a natural adhesive or substitute for glue, or chewed as a type of gum.

Sir Nigel Shadbolt was President of BCS from 2006-2007 Dame Wendy Hall was President of BCS from 2003-2004 Prince Edward, Duke of Kent was President of BCS from 1982-1983 Louis Mountbatten was President of BCS from 1966-1967 Sir Maurice Wilkes served as first President of BCS in 1957. The British Computer Society (BCS) is a professional body and a learned society that represents those working in information technology (IT) and computer science, both in the United Kingdom and internationally. Founded in 1956, BCS has played an important role in educating and nurturing IT professionals, computer scientists, computer engineers, upholding the profession, accrediting chartered IT professional status, and creating a global community active in promoting and furthering the field and practice of computing.  Overview  With a worldwide membership of over 82,000 members in over 151 countries, BCS is a registered charity and was incorporated by Royal Charter in 1984. Its objectives are to promote the study and application of communications technology and computing technology and to advance knowledge of education in ICT for the benefit of professional practitioners and the general public. BCS is a member institution of Engineering Council, through which it is licensed to award the designation of Incorporated Engineer and Chartered Engineer and therefore is responsible for the regulation of ICT and computer science fields within the UK. The BCS is also a member of the Council of European Professional Informatics Societies (CEPIS) and the Seoul Accord for international tertiary degree recognition. BCS was previously a member organisation of the Science Council through which it was licensed to award the designation of Chartered Scientist. BCS has offices off the Strand in Southampton Street, south of Covent Garden in central London. The main administrative offices are in Swindon, Wiltshire, west of London. It also has two overseas offices in Sri Lanka and Mauritius. Members are sent the quarterly IT professional magazine ITNOW (formerly The Computer Bulletin). BCS is a member organization of the Federation of Enterprise Architecture Professional Organizations (FEAPO), a worldwide association of professional organizations which have come together to provide a forum to standardize, professionalize, and otherwise advance the discipline of Enterprise Architecture. History The forerunner of BCS was the \\"London Computer Group\\" (LCG), founded in 1956. BCS was formed a year later from the merger of the LCG and an unincorporated association of scientists into an unincorporated club. In October 1957, BCS was incorporated, by Articles of Association, as \\"The British Computer Society Ltd\\": the first President of BCS was Sir Maurice Wilkes (1913‚Äì2010), FRS. In 1966, the BCS was granted charitable status and in 1970, the BCS was given Armorial Bearings including the shield and crest. The major ethical responsibilities of BCS are emphasized by the leopard's face, surmounting the whole crest and depicting eternal vigilance over the integrity of the Society and its members. The BCS patron is The Duke of Kent, KG. He became patron in December 1976 and has been actively involved in BCS activities, particularly having been President in the Silver Jubilee Year in 1982‚Äì1983. In 2007, BCS launched BCSrecruit.com ‚Äì a job site specifically aimed at IT professionals. In 2008 the BCS was labelled \\"irrelevant\\" by an IT training company, in connection with claims it made that nine out of ten IT professionals were \\"unaware\\" of the BCS's Chartered accreditation scheme. On 21 September 2009, the British Computer Society went through a transformation and re-branded itself as \\"BCS ‚Äì The Chartered Institute for IT\\". In 2010, an Extraordinary General Meeting was called to discuss the direction of the BCS. The debate has been covered by the computing press. Governance BCS is governed by a Trustee Board comprising the President, the Deputy President, the immediate past President, up to nine Vice Presidents (including Vice-President Finance), and five Professional Members elected by the Advisory Council. Sir Maurice Wilkes, Professor of Computer Science at Cambridge University, served as its first president. Each president serves for a 2-year term. A list of presidents of the British Computer Society can be found at BCS web site. The BCS Advisory Council elects the Honorary Officers ‚Äì the President, the Deputy President and up to nine Vice-Presidents, together with the immediate past President and five members of Council. Lists of Trust Board and Advisory Council members are maintained online. The Advisory Council provides advice to the Trustee Board on the direction and operation of BCS; in particular, it is consulted on strategic plans and the annual budget. The Council is a representative body of the membership, with members elected directly by the professional membership, and by the Branches, Groups and Forums.  Fellow British Computer Society (FBCS)  The Fellow of BCS (FBCS) title is conferred to individuals to recognize their outstanding achievements and contributions to Information Technology. Fellows are expected to give something back to the profession, by promoting and evangelizing the profession to the public and society, and contributing to debates in conferences, panels, meetings, etc. Fellows are nominated to the society each year and have to be supported by one or more existing fellows. Criteria for election to fellow include: * Demonstrate leadership in the profession * Wide acknowledgement of specific IT expertise * Contribution to the advancement of knowledge * Eminent individual * Authority and seniority, including leading major projects and managing teams Current fellowshttps://wam.bcs.org/wam/memberdirectory.aspx include distinguished individuals from industries and universities. Some of the prominent fellows include: * Dame Wendy Hall, FBCS - ex-President of BCS * Andy Harter, FBCS - CEO of RealVNC * Tony Hey, FBCS - ex-VP of Microsoft Research * Hermann Hauser, Distinguished FBCS - founder of ARM Ltd. * Frank Zhigang Wang, FBCS - inventor of spin-tunneling random access memory Chartered IT Professional The BCS is the only professional body in the United Kingdom with the ability to grant chartered status to IT professionals under its Royal Charter, granted to them by the Privy Council. Thus having the ability to grant Chartered (Professional) status to both its Fellows and Professional members. Known as Chartered IT Professional, they are entitled to use the suffix CITP. The BCS keeps a register of current Chartered Members and Fellows. Other Professional membership bodies apply to the BCS for a licence that enables them to award CITP to their eligible members. Grades of Membership BCS has different grades of membership: ;Honorary grades * Distinguished Fellow (Only 24 awards since 1971) * Honorary Fellowship (Hon FBCS) (Only 104 awarded to date) ;Professional grades * Fellow (FBCS) * Member (MBCS) ;Ordinary grades * Associate Member (AMBCS) * Student Member ;Group, corporate and other membership categories * Affiliate: for those with an interest in IT but not yet employed in an IT role. * Group membership: nearly 200 organisations now encourage their IT professionals to join the Society through its Group Membership Scheme. * Education affiliates: education intuitions can also be accredited by BCS. ;Other Chartered designations * The Engineering Council UK has licensed the BCS to award Chartered Engineer status (CEng) and Incorporated Engineer status (IEng). * The Science Council formerly licensed the BCS to award Chartered Scientist status (CSci). However, the BCS no longer offers Chartered Scientist status (CSci) * Members may also apply through BCS to the European Federation of National Engineering Associations (FEANI) for European Engineer (Eur Ing) status. ;Designatory (post-nominal) letters Members are encouraged to display the designatory letters to which they are entitled whenever appropriate. The order of designatory (post-nominal) letters is complex and open to a certain amount of interpretation. The accepted authority on this subject is Debrett‚Äôs Correct Form. Normally these should appear after decorations, degrees and chartered letters. Members holding CEng should also display the designatory letters of the institution through which they are registered immediately after the CEng. Conventionally, members holding Chartered status (CITP) display this immediately after their membership letters (e.g., FBCS CITP or MBCS CITP). However, as CITP may now be awarded by other organisations it may also be displayed separately, following that of the awarding institution. Some examples of BCS-related post-nominals: * Mr Frank James MBE, FBCS. * Mr Frank James MBE, MSc, CEng, MBCS, MIET. * Mr Frank James MBE, BSc (Hons), MBCS, CITP. * Mr Frank James MBE, MSc, CSci, MIET, CITP. * Mr Frank James MBE, MSc, MCGI, CEng, MBCS, FEDIPAdvPra. Awards The society provides several awards to recognize outstanding computer scientists, engineers, experienced and young IT professionals. The awards include: * Lovelace Medal * Roger Needham Award * Early Career Award * John Perry Prize * Distinguished Dissertation Award * UK Industry Award Qualifications BCS provides a range of qualifications both for users of computers and IT professionals. =BCS IT User Qualifications= BCS offers qualifications that cover all areas of IT, including understanding Spreadsheets and Presentation Software, Animation, Video Editing and Social Networking safety.IT User Qualifications: http://www.bcs.org/category/14405 The current IT user qualifications are: right *European Computer Driving Licence (ECDL) - BCS is the only organisation licensed to offer ECDL qualifications in the UK. *Advanced ECDL - the advanced course of ECDL (\\"Advanced ECDL\\") has four sections, each a qualification in its own right.

It has three main goals. The RSS is a British learned society for statistics, a professional body for statisticians, and a charity which promotes statistics for the public good.  History  seal of the Statistical Society of London, a wheatsheaf with the motto Aliis exterendum seal The society was founded in 1834 as the Statistical Society of London, though a perhaps unrelated London Statistical Society was in existence at least as early as 1824.Statistical Illustrations ... of the British Empire, London Statistical Society, Third Edition, 1827 At that time there were many provincial statistics societies throughout Britain, but most have not survived. The Manchester Statistical Society (which is older than the LSS) is a notable exception. The associations were formed with the object of gathering information about society. The idea of statistics referred more to political knowledge rather than a series of methods. The members called themselves \\"statists\\" and the original aim was \\"...procuring, arranging and publishing facts to illustrate the condition and prospects of society\\" and the idea of interpreting data, or having opinions, was explicitly excluded. The original seal had the motto Aliis Exterendum (for others to thresh out, i.e. interpret) but this separation was found to be a hindrance and the motto was dropped in later logos. It was many decades before mathematics was regarded as part of the statistical project.Aldrich, J. (2010) \\"Mathematics in the London/Royal Statistical Society 1834-1934\\", Electronic Journ@l for History of Probability and Statistics, 6, (1). Fellows Fellowship of the Royal Statistical Society is open to anyone with an interest in statistics. It is not restricted to only those with high achievement within the discipline. This distinguishes it from other learned societies, where usually the fellow grade is the highest grade in that discipline. = Key figures = Instrumental in founding the LSS were Richard Jones, Charles Babbage, Adolphe Quetelet, William Whewell, and Thomas Malthus. Among its famous members was Florence Nightingale, who was the society's first female member in 1858. Stella Cunliffe was the first female president. Other notable RSS presidents have included William Beveridge, Ronald Fisher, Harold Wilson, and David Cox. Honorary Secretaries include Gerald Goodhardt (1982‚Äì88). = Royal Charter = The LSS became the RSS (Royal Statistical Society) by Royal Charter in 1887, and merged with the Institute of Statisticians in 1993. The merger enabled the society to take on the role of a professional body as well as that of a learned society. As of 2019 the society claims more than 10,000 members around the world, of whom some 1,500 are professionally qualified, with the status of Chartered Statistician (CStat). In January 2009, the RSS received Licensed Body status from the UK Science Council to award Chartered Scientist status. Since February 2009 the society has awarded Chartered Scientist status to suitably qualified members. Unusually among professional societies, all members of the RSS are known as \\"Fellows\\". Fellowship is nowadays not usually used by post- merger members as a post-nominal mark of distinction. However, before the 1993 merger with the Institute of Statisticians, Fellows did often use the post- nominal letters FSS. Before the merger, Fellows were required to have a statistical qualification. The alternative route was to be proposed by two Fellows. The nomination paper then had to be approved by the Council. After the merger these requirements were dropped and all the previous members of the Institute of Statisticians became Fellows as well. Since then, use by new members of their unearned post-nominal FSS qualification was viewed as inappropriateProfessional membership pages on the RSS website: and and strongly discouraged, and it became less common.  Structure  The RSS has premises (including offices and meeting rooms) in Errol Street, EC1, in the London Borough of Islington close to the boundary with the City of London, between Old Street and Barbican stations. The society has various local groups in the UK, together with a wide range of topic-related sections and special interest groups. Each of these sections and groups organises lectures and seminars on statistical topics.  Functions  The society was particularly engaged with the passage of the Statistics and Registration Service Act 2007, having long argued for legislation on statistics. = Events = The RSS organises an annual conference. Among the society's awards are the Guy Medals in gold, silver and bronze, in honour of William Guy. The RSS team reached the finals of University Challenge: The Professionals 2006, where they were beaten 230 to 125 by a team from the Bodleian Library, Oxford. = Publications = Significance magazine The society publishes the Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, which currently consists of three separate series of journals whose contents include papers presented at ordinary meetings of the society, namely Series A (Statistics in Society), Series B (Statistical Methodology) and Series C (Applied Statistics), as well as a general audience magazine called Significance published in conjunction with the American Statistical Association. In September 2013, the society established StatsLife, an online magazine website that features news, interviews and opinion from the world of statistics and data.

View over Lake Turkana The Rift Valley lakes are a series of lakes in the East African Rift valley that runs through eastern Africa from Ethiopia in the north to Malawi in the south, and includes the African Great Lakes in the south. These include some of the world's oldest lakes, deepest lakes, largest lakes by area, and largest lakes by volume. Many are freshwater ecoregions of great biodiversity, while others are alkaline \\"soda lakes\\" supporting highly specialised organisms. The Rift Valley lakes are well known for the evolution of at least 800 cichlid fish species that live in their waters. More species are expected to be discovered. The World Wide Fund for Nature has designated these lakes as one of its Global 200 priority ecoregions for conservation. In this article, the major lakes are listed, generally in order from north to south, and more detailed articles on each lake can be accessed through the linked names. Geology Lake Malawi and Lake Tanganyika have formed in the various valleys of the East African Rift zone, including the huge Lake Victoria. Ecology Lake Kivu's \\"still waters ... hide another face: dissolved within are billions of cubic meters of flammable methane and more still of carbon dioxide, the result of volcanic gases seeping in.\\"  Ethiopian Rift Valley lakes  thumb The Ethiopian Rift Valley lakes are the northernmost of the African Rift Valley lakes. In central Ethiopia, the Main Ethiopian Rift, also known as the Great Rift Valley, splits the Ethiopian highlands into northern and southern halves, and the Ethiopian Rift Valley lakes occupy the floor of the rift valley between the two highlands. Most of the Ethiopian Rift Valley lakes do not have an outlet, and most are alkaline. Although the Ethiopian Rift Valley lakes are of great importance to Ethiopia's economy, as well as being essential to the survival of the local people, there were no intensive and extensive limnological studies undertaken of these lakes until recently. The major ones are * Lake Abaya (areal extent , elevation , maximum depth ), the largest Ethiopian Rift Valley lake by surface area * Lake Chamo (areal extent , elevation , maximum depth ) * Lake Zway or Dambal (areal extent , elevation , maximum depth ) * Lake Shala (areal extent , elevation , maximum depth ), the deepest Ethiopian Rift Valley lake and the largest by water volume * Koka Reservoir (areal extent , elevation , maximum depth not listed) * Lake Langano (areal extent , elevation , maximum depth ) * Lake Abijatta (areal extent , elevation , maximum depth ) * Lake Awasa (areal extent , elevation , maximum depth ) Lake Tana, the source of the Blue Nile, lies in the Ethiopian highlands north of the Rift Valley; however, it is not a Rift Valley lake.  Eastern Rift Valley lakes  Lake Natron South of the Ethiopian highlands, the rift valley splits into two major troughs. The Eastern Rift is home to the Kenyan Rift Valley lakes, while most of the Central African Rift Valley lakes lie in the Western Rift. This area includes the Gregory Rift in Kenya and Tanzania. =Kenya = The Kenyan section of the Rift Valley is home to eight lakes, of which three are freshwater and the rest alkaline. Of the latter, the shallow soda lakes of the Eastern Rift Valley have crystallised salt turning the shores white and are famous for the large flocks of flamingo that feed on crustaceans. * Lake Baringo: second largest of the Kenyan Rift Valley lakes. ** , elevation , freshwater * Lake Bogoria: shallow soda lake, a national preserve. ** , elevation * Lake Elmenteita: shallow soda lake. * Lake Logipi: a shallow hot-spring fed soda lake in the Suguta Valley just south of Lake Turkana.

Western or Albertine Rift Valley lakes  thumb Some of the Rift Valley lakes. From left to right they are Lake Upemba, Lake Mweru, Lake Tanganyika (largest), and Lake Rukwa. This image spans the SE corner of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, NE Zambia, and southern Tanzania. The lakes of the Western or Albertine Rift, with Lake Victoria, include the largest, deepest, and oldest of the Rift Valley Lakes. They are also referred to as the Central African lakes. Lakes Albert, Victoria, and Edward are part of the Nile River basin. Lake Victoria (elevation ), with an area of , is the largest lake in Africa. It is not in the rift valley, instead occupying a depression between the eastern and western rifts formed by the uplift of the rifts to either side. Lakes Victoria, Tanganyika, and Malawi are sometimes collectively known as the African Great Lakes. The Western Rift Valley lakes are fresh water and home to an extraordinary number of species. Approximately 1,500 cichlid fish (Cichlidae) species live in the lakes. In addition to the cichlids, populations of Clariidae, Claroteidae, Mochokidae, Poeciliidae, Mastacembelidae, Centropomidae, Cyprinidae, Clupeidae and other fish families are found in these lakes. They are also important habitats for a number of amphibian species, including Amietophrynus kisoloensis, Bufo keringyagae, Cardioglossa cyaneospila, and Nectophryne batesii. * Lake Albert (, elevation ) is the northernmost lake in the western rift. * Lake Edward (, elevation ) drains north into Lake Albert * Lake Kivu (, elevation ) empties into Lake Tanganyika via the Ruzizi River. * Lake Tanganyika (, elevation ) is the largest and deepest of the Rift Valley lakes (more than ), and is the second deepest fresh water lake on the planet (after Lake Baikal). Below roughly 200 meters depth, its water is anoxic and devoid of life besides anoxic bacteria. It is very sensitive to climate. It is part of the Congo River basin, feeding into the River Congo via the Lukuga River.  Southern Rift Valley lakes (Tanzania and Malawi) The Southern Rift Valley lakes are like the Western Rift Valley lakes in that, with one exception, they are freshwater lakes. * Lake Rukwa (about but quite variable) in Tanzania is the alkaline exception, lying south-east of Tanganyika, and has no outlet. * Lake Malawi (, elevation ), the second largest and second deepest of the Rift Valley lakes at over , is drained by the Shire River, a tributary of the Zambezi River. Also known as Lake Nyasa. * Lake Malombe () is on the Shire River. * Lake Chilwa (, elevation ) has no outlet but extensive wetlands. It is the southernmost of the Rift Valley lakes.  Other lakes of the Great Rift Valley  * Lake Mweru ( elevation 922 m) lies in the Lake Mweru-Luapula graben, which is a branch off the Albertine rift. * Lake Mweru Wantipa (, elevation ) is a marshy lake between lakes Tanganyika and Mweru, and is endorheic but may overflow into Lake Mweru at times of very high flood.

Steatosis most often affects the liver ‚Äì the primary organ of lipid metabolism ‚Äì where the condition is commonly referred to as fatty liver disease. Steatosis can also occur in other organs, including the kidneys, heart, and muscle. When the term is not further specified (as, for example, in 'cardiac steatosis'), it is assumed to refer to the liver. Risk factors associated with steatosis are varied, and may include diabetes mellitus, protein malnutrition, hypertension, cell toxins, obesity, anoxia, and sleep apnea. Steatosis reflects an impairment of the normal processes of synthesis and elimination of triglyceride fat. Excess lipid accumulates in vesicles that displace the cytoplasm. When the vesicles are large enough to distort the nucleus, the condition is known as macrovesicular steatosis; otherwise, the condition is known as microvesicular steatosis. While not particularly detrimental to the cell in mild cases, large accumulations can disrupt cell constituents, and in severe cases the cell may even burst.  Pathogenesis  No single mechanism leading to steatosis exists; rather, a varied multitude of pathologies disrupt normal lipid movement through the cell and cause accumulation. These mechanisms can be separated on whether they ultimately cause an oversupply of lipid which can not be removed quickly enough (i.e., too much in), or whether they cause a failure in lipid breakdown (i.e., not enough used). Failure of lipid metabolism can also lead to the mechanisms which would normally utilise or remove lipids becoming impaired, resulting in the accumulation of unused lipids in the cell. Certain toxins, such as alcohols, carbon tetrachloride, aspirin, and diphtheria toxin, interfere with cellular machinery involved in lipid metabolism. In those with Gaucher's disease, the lysosomes fail to degrade lipids and steatosis arises from the accumulation of glycolipids. Protein malnutrition, such as that seen in kwashiorkor, results in a lack of precursor apoproteins within the cell, therefore unused lipids which would normally participate in lipoprotein synthesis begin to accumulate. = Macrovesicular steatosis = Macrovesicular steatosis is the more common form of fatty degeneration and may be caused by oversupply of lipids due to obesity, obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), insulin resistance, or alcoholism. Nutrient malnutrition may also cause the mobilisation of fat from adipocytes and create a local oversupply in the liver where lipid metabolism occurs. Excess alcohol over a long period of time can induce steatosis. The breakdown of large amounts of ethanol in alcoholic drinks produces large amounts of chemical energy in the form of NADH, signalling to the cell to inhibit the breakdown of fatty acids (which also produces energy) and simultaneously increase the synthesis of fatty acids. This \\"false sense of energy\\" results in more lipid being created than is needed. = Microvesicular steatosis = Microvesicular steatosis is characterized by small intracytoplasmic fat vacuoles (liposomes) which accumulate in the cell. Common causes are tetracyclines, acute fatty liver of pregnancy, Reye's syndrome, and hepatitis C.  Histology  Histologically, steatosis is physically apparent as lipid within membrane bound liposomes of parenchymal cells. When this tissue is fixed and stained to be better viewed under a microscope, the lipid is usually dissolved by the solvents used to prepare the sample. As such, samples prepared this way will appear to have empty holes (or vacuoles) within the cells where the lipid has been cleared. Special lipid stains, such as Sudan stains and osmium tetroxide are able to retain and show up lipid droplets, hence more conclusively indicating the presence of lipids. Other intracellular accumulations, such as water or glycogen, can also appear as clear vacuoles, therefore it becomes necessary to use stains to better decide what is accumulating. Grossly, steatosis causes organ enlargement and lightening in colour. This is due to the high lipid content increasing the organ's volume and becoming visible to the unaided eye. In severe cases, the organ may become vastly enlarged, greasy, and yellow in appearance. Image:Liver steatosis fatty change.jpgHistological section of a mouse's liver showing severe steatosis. The clear vacuoles contained lipid in life; however, histological fixation caused it to be dissolved and hence only empty/clear spaces are seen. File:Fatty change liver - Lipid steatosis 10X.jpgMicrograph of fatty liver showing lipid steatosis. H&E; stain.  Medical imaging  Liver steatosis (fatty liver disease) as seen on CT On X-ray computed tomography (CT), the increased fat component will decrease the density of the liver tissue, making the image less bright. Typically the density of the spleen and liver are roughly equivalent. In steatosis, there is a difference between the density and brightness of the two organs, with the liver appearing darker. On ultrasound, fat is more echogenic (capable of reflecting sound waves). The combination of liver steatosis being dark on CT and bright on ultrasound is sometimes known as the flip flop sign. On magnetic resonance imaging, multiecho gradient echo images can be used to determine the percent fat fraction of the liver. The different resonance frequencies between water and fat make this technique very sensitive and accurate. Acquisition of echoes in \\"in phase\\" and \\"out phase\\" conditions (pertaining to the relative phases of the fat and water proton contingents) enables to obtain a signal proportional to the water and fat contingent, or a signal proportional to the water minus the fat contingent. These signal intensities are then algebraically combined into a percent fat. More recent techniques take into account experimental noise, signal decay and spectroscopic properties of fat. Numerous validation studies have demonstrated excellent correlations between the steatosis level quantified at MRI and the steatosis levels semi- quantitavely and quantitatively determined on liver biopsies (reference methods). Several MRI vendors offer automated calculation of percent fat with acquisition sequences no longer than a single breath hold. On abdominal ultrasonography, steatosis is seen as a hyperechoic liver as compared to the normal kidney. File:MRI Liversteatosis.jpgLiver steatosis (fatty liver disease) as seen on MRI. Multiecho MR sequence in a healthy liver (top row) and a liver with severe steatosis (bottom row) are shown. In the healthy liver, the signal does not vary much in the different echoes. In the steatotic liver, the signal varies greatly between in and out phase echoes. Algebraic combination of these images can be used to accurately quantify liver steatosis. File:False impression of hyperechogenic liver.jpgAbdominal ultrasonography with the liver and kidney side by side (left image) may give a false impression of hyperechogenic liver, so it's preferably done with the organ borders facing the ultrasound probe (right image, of the same case). File:Ultrasonography of focal steatosis.jpgAbdominal ultrasonography of focal steatosis. It is distinguished from a tumor by not compressing the hepatic vein. Incidence In Bristol University's study Children of the 90s, 2.5% of 4,000 people born in 1991 and 1992 were found by ultrasound scanning at the age of 18 to have non-alcoholic fatty liver disease; five years later transient elastography (fibroscan) found over 20% to have the fatty deposits on the liver of steatosis, indicating non-alcoholic fatty liver disease; half of those were classified as severe. The scans also found that 2.4% had the liver scarring of fibrosis, which can lead to cirrhosis.

In national schools, most major policies, such as the curriculum and teacher salaries and conditions, are managed by the state through the Department of Education and Skills. Minor policies of the school are managed by local people, sometimes directed by a member of the clergy, as representative of the patron, through a local 'board of management'. Most primary schools in the Republic of Ireland fall into this category, which is a pre-independence concept. While there are other forms of primary school in Ireland, including a relatively small number of private denominational schools which do not receive state aid, there were just 34 such private primary schools in 2012, with a combined enrollment of 7,600 pupils. By comparison there were, as of 2019, over 3,200 national schools in Ireland with a combined enrollment of 567,000 pupils. History National schools, established by the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland government with the Stanley Letter in 1831, were originally multi-denominational. The schools were controlled by a state body, the National Board of Education, with a six- member board consisting of two Roman Catholics, two Church of Ireland, and two Presbyterians. In the national schools, there was strict delimitation between religious and non-religious education, where the teacher had to declare that religious education was beginning, hang a sign on the wall or door indicating that religious education was in process, and remove all religious symbols and objects from sight when religious education finished. Also, parents had the right to remove their children from this period of religious education if it conflicted with their religious beliefs. Lastly, schools who failed to abide by these rules or who refused admissions of different faiths to the patron were denied state funding. These rules largely remain in place today, but are not consistently recognised by the state, the patron bodies, or the general public. In the early nineteenth century, in a climate of animosity between the churches, the multi-denominational system was strongly opposed: the established church (Protestant Church of Ireland), though the church of the minority, held a special position and a right to government support in promoting Protestantism. Both the Catholic Church, which was emerging from a period of suppression in Ireland, and the Presbyterians, who had also suffered under the penal laws, had sought state support for schools of their own tradition. For example, James Doyle (Roman Catholic Bishop of Kildare and Leighlin) was an early proponent, seeking to improve on the informal hedge school system. Doyle spoke before a Parliamentary Committee as follows, \\"I do not see how any man wishing well to the public peace, and who looks to Ireland as his country, can think that peace can be permanently established, or the prosperity of the country ever well secured, if children are separated at the commencement of life on account of their religious opinions\\". From a political point of view, Doyle believed that separate schools would endanger the public peace, which was not yet permanent. He dealt with the effect of separation on the children themselves by saying \\"I do not know of any measures that would prepare the way for better feeling in Ireland than uniting children at an early age, and bringing them up in the same school, leading them to commune with one another and to form those little intimacies and friendships which subsist through life. Children thus united know and love each other as children brought up together always will and to separate them is I think, to destroy some of the finest feelings in the hearts of men\\". In 1831, Edward Stanley (who later became the 14th Earl of Derby), Chief Secretary for Ireland, in a letter to Augustus FitzGerald, 3rd Duke of Leinster, outlined the new state-supported system of primary education (this letter remains today the legal basis of the system). The two legal pillars of the national school system were to be (i) children of all religious denominations to be taught together in the same school, with (ii) separate religious instruction. There was to be no hint of proselytism in this new school system. The new system, initially well supported by the religious denominations, quickly lost support of the Churches. However, the population showed great enthusiasm and flocked to attend these new national schools. In the second half of the nineteenth century, first the Catholic Church, and later the Protestant churches conceded to the state, and accepted the \\"all religious denominations together\\" legal position. Where possible, parents sent their children of a national school under the local management of their particular Church. The result was that by the end of the nineteenth century the system had become increasingly denominational, with individuals choosing to attend schools primarily catering to children of their own religion. However, the legal position de jure, that all national schools are multi-denominational, remains to this day. Although, since the establishment of the Free State consistent pressure has been exerted by the Catholic Church to drop the multi-denominational legal position, this has never been conceded by the state. A report was submitted to government in 1953 showing more than 90% of the schools were attended by only one denomination ‚Äì that most national schools were de facto denominational. From 1965, changes in the 'Rules for National Schools' allowed for the integration of religious education into the curriculum. Today, following many years of immigration, a majority of national schools cater for more than one religion. Today national schools are both de jure and de facto multi-denominational. Terminology While there is no prescribed naming scheme for national schools, initials (within the name) are sometimes used to describe the type of school it is. For example, 'GNS' (as an abbreviation for Girls' National School) may denote a girl-only single gender school. Similarly, 'BNS' is used as an abbreviation for Boys' National School. 'SN', an abbreviation for the Irish language term Scoil Naisi√∫nta may sometimes appear before the name of the school (rather than after it). While national-school teachers would sometimes historically use the post-nominal letters 'N.T.', this is no longer common.

This includes the cases of finding the minimum, maximum, and median elements. There are O(n)-time (worst-case linear time) selection algorithms, and sublinear performance is possible for structured data; in the extreme, O(1) for an array of sorted data. Selection is a subproblem of more complex problems like the nearest neighbor and shortest path problems. Many selection algorithms are derived by generalizing a sorting algorithm, and conversely some sorting algorithms can be derived as repeated application of selection. The simplest case of a selection algorithm is finding the minimum (or maximum) element by iterating through the list, keeping track of the running minimum ‚Äì the minimum so far ‚Äì (or maximum) and can be seen as related to the selection sort. Conversely, the hardest case of a selection algorithm is finding the median. In fact, a specialized median-selection algorithm can be used to build a general selection algorithm, as in median of medians. The best-known selection algorithm is quickselect, which is related to quicksort; like quicksort, it has (asymptotically) optimal average performance, but poor worst-case performance, though it can be modified to give optimal worst-case performance as well.  Selection by sorting  By sorting the list or array then selecting the desired element, selection can be reduced to sorting. This method is inefficient for selecting a single element, but is efficient when many selections need to be made from an array, in which case only one initial, expensive sort is needed, followed by many cheap selection operations ‚Äì O(1) for an array, though selection is O(n) in a linked list, even if sorted, due to lack of random access. In general, sorting requires O(n log n) time, where n is the length of the list, although a lower bound is possible with non- comparative sorting algorithms like radix sort and counting sort. Rather than sorting the whole list or array, one can instead use partial sorting to select the k smallest or k largest elements. The kth smallest (resp., kth largest element) is then the largest (resp., smallest element) of the partially sorted list ‚Äì this then takes O(1) to access in an array and O(k) to access in a list. = Unordered partial sorting = If partial sorting is relaxed so that the k smallest elements are returned, but not in order, the factor of O(k log k) can be eliminated. An additional maximum selection (taking O(k) time) is required, but since k \\\\leq n, this still yields asymptotic complexity of O(n). In fact, partition-based selection algorithms yield both the kth smallest element itself and the k smallest elements (with other elements not in order). This can be done in O(n) time ‚Äì average complexity of quickselect, and worst- case complexity of refined partition-based selection algorithms. Conversely, given a selection algorithm, one can easily get an unordered partial sort (k smallest elements, not in order) in O(n) time by iterating through the list and recording all elements less than the kth element. If this results in fewer than k ‚àí 1 elements, any remaining elements equal the kth element. Care must be taken, due to the possibility of equality of elements: one must not include all elements less than or equal to the kth element, as elements greater than the kth element may also be equal to it. Thus unordered partial sorting (lowest k elements, but not ordered) and selection of the kth element are very similar problems. Not only do they have the same asymptotic complexity, O(n), but a solution to either one can be converted into a solution to the other by a straightforward algorithm (finding a max of k elements, or filtering elements of a list below a cutoff of the value of the kth element). = Partial selection sort = A simple example of selection by partial sorting is to use the partial selection sort. The obvious linear time algorithm to find the minimum (resp. maximum) ‚Äì iterating over the list and keeping track of the minimum (resp. maximum) element so far ‚Äì can be seen as a partial selection sort that selects the 1 smallest element. However, many other partial sorts also reduce to this algorithm for the case k = 1, such as a partial heap sort. More generally, a partial selection sort yields a simple selection algorithm which takes O(kn) time. This is asymptotically inefficient, but can be sufficiently efficient if k is small, and is easy to implement. Concretely, we simply find the minimum value and move it to the beginning, repeating on the remaining list until we have accumulated k elements, and then return the kth element. Here is partial selection sort-based algorithm: function select(list[1..n], k) for i from 1 to k minIndex = i minValue = list[i] for j from i+1 to n do if list[j] < minValue then minIndex = j minValue = list[j] swap list[i] and list[minIndex] return list[k]  Partition-based selection  Linear performance can be achieved by a partition-based selection algorithm, most basically quickselect. Quickselect is a variant of quicksort ‚Äì in both one chooses a pivot and then partitions the data by it, but while Quicksort recurses on both sides of the partition, Quickselect only recurses on one side, namely the side on which the desired kth element is. As with Quicksort, this has optimal average performance, in this case linear, but poor worst-case performance, in this case quadratic. This occurs for instance by taking the first element as the pivot and searching for the maximum element, if the data is already sorted. In practice this can be avoided by choosing a random element as pivot, which yields almost certain linear performance. Alternatively, a more careful deterministic pivot strategy can be used, such as median of medians. These are combined in the hybrid introselect algorithm (analogous to introsort), which starts with Quickselect but falls back to median of medians if progress is slow, resulting in both fast average performance and optimal worst-case performance of O(n). The partition-based algorithms are generally done in place, which thus results in partially sorting the data. They can be done out of place, not changing the original data, at the cost of O(n) additional space. = Median selection as pivot strategy = A median-selection algorithm can be used to yield a general selection algorithm or sorting algorithm, by applying it as the pivot strategy in Quickselect or Quicksort; if the median-selection algorithm is asymptotically optimal (linear-time), the resulting selection or sorting algorithm is as well. In fact, an exact median is not necessary ‚Äì an approximate median is sufficient. In the median of medians selection algorithm, the pivot strategy computes an approximate median and uses this as pivot, recursing on a smaller set to compute this pivot. In practice the overhead of pivot computation is significant, so these algorithms are generally not used, but this technique is of theoretical interest in relating selection and sorting algorithms. In detail, given a median-selection algorithm, one can use it as a pivot strategy in Quickselect, obtaining a selection algorithm. If the median-selection algorithm is optimal, meaning O(n), then the resulting general selection algorithm is also optimal, again meaning linear. This is because Quickselect is a divide and conquer algorithm, and using the median at each pivot means that at each step the search set decreases by half in size, so the overall complexity is a geometric series times the complexity of each step, and thus simply a constant times the complexity of a single step, in fact 2 = 1/(1-(1/2)) times (summing the series). Similarly, given a median-selection algorithm or general selection algorithm applied to find the median, one can use it as a pivot strategy in Quicksort, obtaining a sorting algorithm. If the selection algorithm is optimal, meaning O(n), then the resulting sorting algorithm is optimal, meaning O(n log n). The median is the best pivot for sorting, as it evenly divides the data, and thus guarantees optimal sorting, assuming the selection algorithm is optimal. A sorting analog to median of medians exists, using the pivot strategy (approximate median) in Quicksort, and similarly yields an optimal Quicksort.  Incremental sorting by selection  Converse to selection by sorting, one can incrementally sort by repeated selection. Abstractly, selection only yields a single element, the kth element. However, practical selection algorithms frequently involve partial sorting, or can be modified to do so. Selecting by partial sorting naturally does so, sorting the elements up to k, and selecting by partitioning also sorts some elements: the pivots are sorted to the correct positions, with the kth element being the final pivot, and the elements between the pivots have values between the pivot values. The difference between partition-based selection and partition-based sorting, as in quickselect versus quicksort, is that in selection one recurses on only one side of each pivot, sorting only the pivots (an average of log(n) pivots are used), rather than recursing on both sides of the pivot. This can be used to speed up subsequent selections on the same data; in the extreme, a fully sorted array allows O(1) selection. Further, compared with first doing a full sort, incrementally sorting by repeated selection amortizes the sorting cost over multiple selections. For partially sorted data (up to k), so long as the partially sorted data and the index k up to which the data is sorted are recorded, subsequent selections of j less than or equal to k can simply select the jth element, as it is already sorted, while selections of j greater than k only need to sort the elements above the kth position. For partitioned data, if the list of pivots is stored (for example, in a sorted list of the indices), then subsequent selections only need to select in the interval between two pivots (the nearest pivots below and above). The biggest gain is from the top-level pivots, which eliminate costly large partitions: a single pivot near the middle of the data cuts the time for future selections in half. The pivot list will grow over subsequent selections, as the data becomes more sorted, and can even be passed to a partition-based sort as the basis of a full sort.  Using data structures to select in sublinear time  Given an unorganized list of data, linear time (Œ©(n)) is required to find the minimum element, because we have to examine every element (otherwise, we might miss it). If we organize the list, for example by keeping it sorted at all times, then selecting the kth largest element is trivial, but then insertion requires linear time, as do other operations such as combining two lists. The strategy to find an order statistic in sublinear time is to store the data in an organized fashion using suitable data structures that facilitate the selection. Two such data structures are tree-based structures and frequency tables. When only the minimum (or maximum) is needed, a good approach is to use a heap, which is able to find the minimum (or maximum) element in constant time, while all other operations, including insertion, are O(log n) or better. More generally, a self-balancing binary search tree can easily be augmented to make it possible to both insert an element and find the kth largest element in O(log n) time; this is called an order statistic tree. We simply store in each node a count of how many descendants it has, and use this to determine which path to follow. The information can be updated efficiently since adding a node only affects the counts of its O(log n) ancestors, and tree rotations only affect the counts of the nodes involved in the rotation. Another simple strategy is based on some of the same concepts as the hash table. When we know the range of values beforehand, we can divide that range into h subintervals and assign these to h buckets. When we insert an element, we add it to the bucket corresponding to the interval it falls in. To find the minimum or maximum element, we scan from the beginning or end for the first nonempty bucket and find the minimum or maximum element in that bucket. In general, to find the kth element, we maintain a count of the number of elements in each bucket, then scan the buckets from left to right adding up counts until we find the bucket containing the desired element, then use the expected linear- time algorithm to find the correct element in that bucket. If we choose h of size roughly sqrt(n), and the input is close to uniformly distributed, this scheme can perform selections in expected O(sqrt(n)) time. Unfortunately, this strategy is also sensitive to clustering of elements in a narrow interval, which may result in buckets with large numbers of elements (clustering can be eliminated through a good hash function, but finding the element with the kth largest hash value isn't very useful). Additionally, like hash tables this structure requires table resizings to maintain efficiency as elements are added and n becomes much larger than h2. A useful case of this is finding an order statistic or extremum in a finite range of data. Using above table with bucket interval 1 and maintaining counts in each bucket is much superior to other methods. Such hash tables are like frequency tables used to classify the data in descriptive statistics.  Lower bounds  In The Art of Computer Programming, Donald E. Knuth discussed a number of lower bounds for the number of comparisons required to locate the t smallest entries of an unorganized list of n items (using only comparisons). There is a trivial lower bound of n ‚àí 1 for the minimum or maximum entry. To see this, consider a tournament where each game represents one comparison. Since every player except the winner of the tournament must lose a game before we know the winner, we have a lower bound of n ‚àí 1 comparisons. The story becomes more complex for other indexes. We define W_{t}(n) as the minimum number of comparisons required to find the t smallest values. Knuth references a paper published by S. S. Kislitsyn, which shows an upper bound on this value: :W_{t}(n) \\\\leq n - t + \\\\sum_{n+1-t < j \\\\leq n} \\\\lceil{\\\\log_2\\\\, j}\\\\rceil \\\\quad \\\\text{for}\\\\, n \\\\geq t This bound is achievable for t=2 but better, more complex bounds are known for larger t.  Space complexity  The required space complexity of selection is O(1) additional storage, in addition to storing the array in which selection is being performed. Such space complexity can be achieved while preserving optimal O(n) time complexity.Lai T.W., Wood D. (1988) Implicit selection. In: Karlsson R., Lingas A. (eds) SWAT 88. SWAT 1988. Lecture Notes in Computer Science, vol 318. Springer, Berlin, Heidelberg Online selection algorithm Online selection may refer narrowly to computing the kth smallest element of a stream, in which case partial sorting algorithms ‚Äî with k + O(1) space for the k smallest elements so far ‚Äî can be used, but partition-based algorithms cannot be. Alternatively, selection itself may be required to be online, that is, an element can only be selected from a sequential input at the instance of observation and each selection, respectively refusal, is irrevocable. The problem is to select, under these constraints, a specific element of the input sequence (as for example the largest or the smallest value) with largest probability. This problem can be tackled by the Odds algorithm, which yields the optimal under an independence condition; it is also optimal itself as an algorithm with the number of computations being linear in the length of input. The simplest example is the secretary problem of choosing the maximum with high probability, in which case optimal strategy (on random data) is to track the running maximum of the first n/e elements and reject them, and then select the first element that is higher than this maximum.  Related problems  One may generalize the selection problem to apply to ranges within a list, yielding the problem of range queries. The question of range median queries (computing the medians of multiple ranges) has been analyzed.  Language support  Very few languages have built-in support for general selection, although many provide facilities for finding the smallest or largest element of a list. A notable exception is C++, which provides a templated \`nth_element\` method with a guarantee of expected linear time, and also partitions the data, requiring that the nth element be sorted into its correct place, elements before the nth element are less than it, and elements after the nth element are greater than it. It is implied but not required that it is based on Hoare's algorithm (or some variant) by its requirement of expected linear time and partitioning of data.Section 25.3.2 of ISO/IEC 14882:2003(E) and 14882:1998(E)nth_element, SGI STL For Perl, the module Sort::Key::Top, available from CPAN, provides a set of functions to select the top n elements from a list using several orderings and custom key extraction procedures. Furthermore, the Statistics::CaseResampling module provides a function to calculate quantiles using quickselect. Python's standard library (since 2.4) includes \`heapq.nsmallest()\` and \`nlargest()\`, returning sorted lists, in O(n log k) time.https://stackoverflow.com/a/23038826 Matlab includes \`maxk()\` and \`mink()\` functions, which return the maximal (minimal) k values in a vector as well as their indices. Because language support for sorting is more ubiquitous, the simplistic approach of sorting followed by indexing is preferred in many environments despite its disadvantage in speed. Indeed, for lazy languages, this simplistic approach can even achieve the best complexity possible for the k smallest/greatest sorted (with maximum/minimum as a special case) if the sort is lazy enough.

The Workshops were also closely associated with the Hogarth Press and the artist and critic Roger Fry, who was the principal figure behind the project, believed that artists could design, produce and sell their own works, and that writers could also be their own printers and publishers.Porter, David H. (2008) The Omega Workshops and the Hogarth Press: an artful fugue. London: Cecil Woolf, p. 7. The Directors of the firm were Fry, Duncan Grant and Vanessa Bell. Beginnings Fry aimed to remove what he considered to be the false divisions between the decorative and fine arts, and to give his artist friends an additional income opportunity in designing furniture, textiles and other household accessories. Fry was keen to encourage a Post-Impressionist influence in designs produced for Omega. However, Cubist and Fauvist influences are also apparent, particularly in many of the textile designs. To ensure items were bought only for the quality of the work, and not the reputation of the artist, Fry insisted works be shown anonymously, marked only with the letter omega. The products were in general expensive, and aimed at an exclusive market. Designers and manufacturers Furniture created by Roger Fry for the Omega Workshops, on display in 2009. Nina Hamnett painted by Roger Fry, 1917, in a dress designed by Vanessa Bell and made at the Omega. The shoes may also be from Omega and the cushion on the chair is covered with 'Maud' linen, also by Bell. In addition to offering a wide range of individual products, such as painted furniture, painted murals, mosaics, stained glass, and textiles, Omega Workshops offered interior design themes for various living spaces. A commission was taken to decorate a room for the 1913 Ideal Home Exhibition, and an illustrated catalogue, including text written by Fry, was published in autumn 1914. Vanessa Bell and Duncan Grant produced designs for Omega, and Wyndham Lewis was initially part of the operation. Lewis, however, split off at an early stage, taking with him several other participants to start the rival decorative workshop Rebel Art Centre after accusing Fry of misappropriating a commission to decorate a room at the Ideal Home Exhibition in the autumn of 1913. In October 1913, Wyndham Lewis, Frederick Etchells, Edward Wadsworth and Cuthbert Hamilton announced their resignation from Omega in a letter, known as the 'Round Robin', to its shareholders and patrons. This letter contained accusations particularly against Fry, criticising the workshop's products and ideology. This split led to the formation not only of the Rebel Art Centre, but also of the Vorticist movement. Most manufacturing for Omega was outsourced to professional craftsmen, such as J. Kallenborn & Sons of Stanhope Street, London, for marquetry furniture and Dryad Limited of Leicester for tall cane-seat chairs.Shone, p. 139. A company in France was used to manufacture early printed linens. In the autumn of 1913 Fry, who also created the designs for Omega's tall cane-seat chairs, started designing and making pottery. After he considered book design and publishing in July 1915, the superintendent of printing at Central School of Arts and Crafts collaborated with Omega in designing four books that were later outsourced for printing. The management of the Omega Workshop was passed to Winifred Gill from 1914 as the men started to become involved in the First World War. One artist exhibitions included those of Edward McKnight Kauffer, Alvaro Guevara, Mikhail Larionov and Vanessa Bell's first solo exhibition in 1916. The range of products continued to increase throughout Omega Workshops' six-year existence, and in April 1915 Vanessa Bell began using Omega fabrics in dress design, after which dressmaking became a successful part of the business. Edward Wolfe worked at the Omega Workshops, hand-painting candle-shades and trays, and decorating furniture. Wolfe, who died in 1982, was one of the last of the Bloomsbury painters. In January 1918, Omega were commissioned to design sets and costumes in the Israel Zangwill play Too Much Money. Closure and legacy Omega closed in 1919, after a clearance sale, and was officially liquidated on 24 July 1920. A series of poor financial decisions and internal conflicts all contributed to its decline. At the time of its closure, Fry was the only remaining original member working regularly at the workshop. Despite this, Omega became influential in interior design in the 1920s. A revival of interest in Omega designs in the 1980s led to a reassessment of the place of the Bloomsbury Group in visual arts.

The group specialized in topical songs, mostly songs advocating an anti-war, anti-racism and pro-union philosophy. They were part of the Popular Front, an alliance of liberals and leftists, including the Communist Party USA (whose slogan, under their leader Earl Browder, was \\"Communism is twentieth century Americanism\\"), who had vowed to put aside their differences in order to fight fascism and promote racial and religious inclusiveness and workers' rights. The Almanac Singers felt strongly that songs could help achieve these goals. History Cultural historian Michael Denning writes, \\"The base of the Popular Front was labor movement, the organization of millions of industrial workers into the new unions of the CIO. For this was the age of the CIO, the years that one historian has called 'the largest sustained surge of worker organization in American history'\\".Michael Denning, The Cultural Front: The Laboring of American Culture in the Twentieth Century (London, New York: Verso, 1997) p. 6. \\"By the early 1940s,\\" he continues, \\"the CIO was dominated by new unions in the metalworking industries --the United Autoworkers, the United Steel Workers, and the United Electrical Workers--and 'industrial unionism' was not simply a kind of unionism but a kind of social reconstruction\\".(Denning, 1997, p. 7) It is in the context of this social movement that the story of the Almanac Singers, which formed in early 1941, ought to be seen. In late 1940 and early 1941 (before America entered World War II) rearmament was putting an end to a decade of unemployment; and labor was at its most militant. As the CIO fought racial discrimination in hiring, it had to confront deep racial divides in its own membership, particularly in the UAW plants in Detroit where white workers sometimes struck to protest the promotion of black workers to production jobs. It also worked on this issue in shipyards in Alabama, mass transit in Philadelphia, and steel plants in Baltimore. The CIO leadership, particularly those in more left unions such as the Packinghouse Workers, the UAW, the NMU and the Transport Workers, undertook serious efforts to suppress hate strikes and to educate their membership. Those unions contrasted their relatively bold attack on the problem with the timidity and racism of the AFL.(See \\"Growth During the Second World War\\" in wikipedia's entry on the CIO) Almanac members Millard Lampell, Lee Hays, Pete Seeger, and Woody Guthrie began playing together informally in 1940 or 1941. Pete Seeger and Guthrie had met at Will Geer's Grapes of Wrath Evening, a benefit for displaced migrant workers, in March 1940. That year, Seeger joined Guthrie on a trip to Texas and California to visit Guthrie's relatives. Hays and Lampell had rented a New York City apartment together in October 1940, and on his return Seeger moved in with them. They called their apartment Almanac House, and it became a center for leftist intellectuals as well as crash pad for folksingers, including (in 1942) Sonny Terry and Brownie McGhee. Ed Cray says that Hays and Seeger's first paying gig was in January 1941 at a fund-raising benefit for Spanish Civil War Loyalists at the Jade Mountain restaurant in New York City.Ed Cray, Ramblin' Man: A Life of Woody Guthrie (New York: W.W. Norton, 2004), pp. 218-219. David Dunaway, on the other hand, in The Ballad of Pete Seeger (New York: Villard Books), 2008, p. 82, gives a date of December, 1940. According to a 1965 interview with Lee Hays by Richard Reuss, Seeger, Hays, and Lampell sang at an American Youth Congress held at Turner's Arena in Washington, D.C., in February 1941, at which sponsors had requested songs constructed around the slogan \\"Don't Lend or Lease our Bases\\" and \\"Jim Crow must Go\\".Richard A. Reuss and Joanne C. Reuss, American Folk Music & Left Wing Politics 1927-1957 (Lanham, Maryland and London: Scarecrow Press, 2000), p. 150 and note, p. 175. The Youth Congress of the previous year, a rally for jobs, had been held on the grounds of the White House. On that occasion, President Franklin Roosevelt had chided members for condemning only fascist dictatorships rather than all dictators (meaning Stalin), angering its members, who were still upset over his and Churchill's arms embargo against Loyalist Spain. Shortly after this, they decided to call themselves the Almanacs. They chose the name because Lee Hays had said that back home in Arkansas farmers had only two books in their houses: the Bible, to guide and prepare them for life in the next world, and the Almanac, to tell them about conditions in this one.\\"\\"'Hold on', said Lee [Hays]. 'Back where I come from, a family had two books. The Bible to help 'em to the next world. The Almanac, to help 'em through the present world. We've got an Almanac. Of course, most Congressmen can't read it.' We became the Almanac Singers.\\" (Pete Seeger, Where Have All the Flowers Gone [1993, 1997], p. 19. Performers who sang with the group at various times included Sis Cunningham, (John) Peter Hawes and his brother Baldwin \\"Butch\\" Hawes, Bess Lomax Hawes (wife of Butch and sister of Alan Lomax), Cisco Houston, Arthur Stern, Josh White, Jackie (Gibson) Alper, Burl Ives, (Hiram) Jaime Lowden and Sam Gary. They invented a driving, energetic performing style, based on what they felt was the best of American country string band music, black and white. They wore street clothes, which was unheard of in an era when entertainers routinely wore formal, night-club attire, and they invited the audience to join in the singing. The Almanacs had many gigs playing at parties, rallies, benefits, unions meetings, and informal \\"hootenannies\\", a term Seeger and Guthrie learned on an Almanac tour of Portland and Washington.On the use of the term, Richard Reuss draws attention to Pete Seeger's article, \\"How Hootenanny Came to Be\\" in Sing Out! 5, no. 4 (Autumn 1955): 32-33\\\\. Cited in Reuss, 2000, p. 176. On May day of 1941, they entertained a rally of 20,000 striking transit workers in Madison Square Garden, where they introduced the song \\"Talking Union\\" and participated in a dramatic sketch with the young actress Carol Channing.Ronald Cohen and Dave Samuelson, Songs for Political Action (Hambergen, Germany: Bear Family Records, 1996), p. 17.  Recordings and Reds  The Almanacs' first record release, an album of three 78s called Songs for John Doe, written to protest the Selective Training and Service Act of 1940, the first peacetime draft in U.S. history. Recorded in February or March 1941 and issued in May, it comprised four songs written by Millard Lampell and two by Seeger and Hays (including \\"Plow Under\\") that followed the Communist Party line (after the 1939 Molotov-Ribbentrop non-aggression pact), urging non-intervention in World War II.Pacifism, inspired by repugnance at the brutality of World War I, was still strong, and there was widespread non- interventionist sentiment among labor, as well as among the predominantly right-wing members of the isolationist America First Committee, who included not only Charles Lindbergh and the future U.S. president Gerald Ford, but also the anti-Communist socialist Norman Thomas. It was produced by the founder of Keynote Records, Eric Bernay. Bernay, who owned a small record store, was the former business manager of the magazine New Masses, which in 1938 and 39 had sponsored John H. Hammond's landmark From Spirituals to Swing Concert.The Keynote label had debuted with the famous collection of Spanish Civil War songs, Six Songs for Democracy by Ernst Busch and chorus (1940). In addition to issuing records by Josh White and the Almanacs, Keynote drew on Cafe Society bands for a series of small group sessions, \\"nearly a third of which,\\" Whitney Balliett has argued, \\"are among the best of all jazz recordings\\"; see Michael Denning, The Cultural Front (London: Verso, 1997), p. 338. Perhaps because of its controversial content, Songs for John Doe came out under the imprint \\"Almanac Records\\", and Bernay insisted that the performers themselves (in this case Pete Seeger, Millard Lampell, Josh White, and Sam Gary, an interracial group) pay for the costs of production. Songs for John Doe attacked big American corporations (such as J.P. Morgan and DuPont), repeating the Party's line that they had supported German rearmament, and during the period of re-armament in 1941, were now vying for government contracts to build up the defenses of the U.S. Besides being anti-union, these corporations were a focus of progressive and black activist anger because they barred blacks from employment in defense work. The album also criticized President Roosevelt's unprecedented peacetime draft, insinuating that he was going to war for J.P. Morgan. Seeger later said that he believed the Communist argument at that time that the war was \\"phony\\" and that big business merely wanted to use Hitler as a proxy to attack Soviet Russia.See Pete Seeger, Where Have All the Flowers Gone: A Musical Autobiography, edited by Peter Blood (Bethlehem: PA [1993, 1997) pp. 19-22: > Those were the days of Hitler's aerial blitz of Britain and Stalin's > invasion of Finland. A large section of the American (and English and > French) public was still hoping to sic Hitler on Stalin, and let the two > rival dictatorships fight it out and leave the democracies alone. Harry > Truman, then in the Senate (later succeeding FDR as U.S. President), is > supposed to have said that we should try to get Hitler and Stalin fighting > each other and then help the one that's losing. Then they'd both finish each > other off. ‚ÄîWhere Have all the Flowers Gone [1993,1997], p. 19. When Pete was preparing to write his autobiography, Helen Travis, a friend of his from that era, showed how Party members justified the changing line to themselves when she wrote : > I remain convinced that it was a phony war at the outset. However we lefties > weren't hep enough to note how it changed when popular resistance to the > German onslaught began in Yugoslavia ... before the invasion of the USSR.\\" > (Where Have All the Flowers Gone [1993, 1997], p. 22) . Bess Lomax Hawes, who was twenty at the time and did not sing on the John Doe album, writes in her autobiography Sing It Pretty (2008), that for her part, she had taken the pacifist oath as a girl out of repugnance for what she thought was the senseless brutality of the First World War (a sentiment shared by many) and that she took the oath very seriously. However, she said that events were happening so fast, and such terrible news was coming out about German atrocities, that the Almanacs hardly knew what to believe from one day to the next, and they found themselves adjusting their topical repertoire on a daily basis. > Every day, it seemed, another once-stable European political reality would > fall to the rapidly expanding Nazi armies, and the agonies of the death > camps were beginning to reach our ears. The Almanacs, as self-defined > commentators, were inevitably affected by the intense national debate > between the \\"warmongers\\" and the \\"isolationists\\" (and the points between). > Before every booking we had to decide: were we going to sing some of our > hardest-hitting and most eloquent songs, all of which were antiwar, and if > we weren't, what would we sing anyway? ... We hoped the next headline would > not challenge our entire roster of poetic ideas. Woody Guthrie wrote a song > that mournfully stated: \\"I started out to write a song to the entire > population / But no sooner than I got the words down, here come a brand new > situation\\".Bess Lomax Hawes (2008), p. 43. According to Ronald D. Cohen in > Rainbow Quest (Boston: University of Massachusetts Press, 2002), p. 30, > Guthrie had joined the Almanacs in the summer of 1941, greatly enhancing its > repertoire. On June 22, 1941, Hitler broke the non-aggression pact and attacked Communist Russia, and Keynote promptly destroyed all its inventory of Songs for John Doe. The CIO now urged support for Roosevelt and the draft, and it forbade its members from participation in strikes for the duration (angering some in the movement). On June 25, 1941, Roosevelt, under pressure from black leaders, who were threatening a massive march on Washington against segregation in the army and the exclusion of blacks from factories doing defense work, signed Executive Order 8802 (The Fair Employment Act) banning racial discrimination by corporations receiving federal defense contracts. The racial situation, which had threatened black support for the peacetime draft, was now somewhat defused (even though the Army still declined to desegregate) and the march was canceled. The Almanac's second album, 'Talking Union', also produced by Bernay, was a collection of six labor songs: \\"Union Maid\\", \\"I Don't Want Your Millions Mister\\", \\"Get Thee Behind Me Satan\\", \\"Union Train\\", \\"Which Side Are You On?\\", and the eponymous \\"Talking Union\\". This album, issued in July 1941, was not anti-Roosevelt but was criticized in a review by Time magazine, nevertheless.The review, published Sept. 15, 1941 in a column entitled \\"September Records\\", recalled the Almanac's anti-war album earlier that year, noting tartly: \\"Their recorded collection Songs for John Doe, ably hewed to the then Moscow line, neatly phonograph-needled J. P. Morgan, E. I. du Pont de Nemours and, particularly, war (TIME, June 16). The three discs of Talking Union, on sale last week under the Keynote label, lay off the isolationist business now that the Russians are laying it on the Germans.\\" It was reissued by Folkways in 1955 with additional songs and is still available today. The Almanacs also issued two albums of traditional folk songs with no political content in 1941: an album of sea chanteys, Deep Sea Chanteys and Whaling Ballads (sea chanteys, as was well known, being Franklin Roosevelt's favorite kind of song) and Sod-Buster Ballads, which were songs of the pioneers. Both of these were produced by Alan Lomax on General, the label that had issued his Jelly Roll Morton recordings in 1940.General, a subsidiary of Commodore, had been founded by Milt Gabler, who in 1941 accepted a job at Decca. In 1939 Commodore had put out Billie Holiday's \\"Strange Fruit\\", when Columbia rejected it as too controversial. See Bob Koester, \\"Milt Gabler & Commodore Records\\" . In 1954, Gabler would issue the revolutionary rockabilly hit, \\"Rock Around the Clock.\\" When the USA entered the European war after Germany's post-Pearl Harbor declaration of war in December 1941, the Almanacs recorded a new topical album for Keynote in support of the war effort, Dear Mr. President, under the supervision of Earl Robinson, that included Woody Guthrie's \\"Reuben James\\" (1942).\\"When Decca backed away from its contract offer [because of bad publicity associated with Songs for John Doe], the Almanacs recorded Dear Mr. President. Earl Robinson supervised the January 1942 session, which featured six songs in support of the war effort\\" (Ronald D. Cohen & Dave Samuelson, Songs for Political Action, Bear Family Records BCD 15720 JL, 1996, p. 94). The title song, \\"Dear Mr. President\\", was a solo by Pete Seeger, and its lines expressed his lifelong credo: > Now, Mr. President, / We haven't always agreed in the past, I know, / But > that ain't at all important now. / What is important is what we got to do, / > We got to lick Mr. Hitler, and until we do, / Other things can wait.// > Now, as I think of our great land . . . / I know it ain't perfect, but it > will be someday, / Just give us a little time. // This is the reason that I > want to fight, / Not 'cause everything's perfect, or everything's right. / > No, it's just the opposite: I'm fightin' because / I want a better America, > and better laws, / And better homes, and jobs, and schools, / And no more > Jim Crow, and no more rules like / \\"You can't ride on this train 'cause > you're a Negro,\\" / \\"You can't live here 'cause you're a Jew,\\"/ \\"You can't > work here 'cause you're a union man.\\"// > So, Mr. President, / We got this one big job to do / That's lick Mr. Hitler > and when we're through, / Let no one else ever take his place / To trample > down the human race. / So what I want is you to give me a gun / So we can > hurry up and get the job done.On January 21, 1942, Alan Lomax wrote the > following to Woody Guthrie: ‚ÄúI played the Almanac songs the other day for > Mrs. Roosevelt, and she thought they were swell, and asked for copies of the > records. She is playing them for her OCD staff, and I think their fame will > be spread abroad. Besides, the News and Special Events man from BBC was > here, and took a copy of \\"Taking it Easy\\" with the intention of getting it > played on their network.

In > the same letter he urged that the group, if it was to change its name, > choose something more associated with folk music than \\"The Headline > Singers\\", which Guthrie was contemplating. The album was not released until > May of that year. In 1942, Army intelligence and the FBI determined that the Almanacs and their former anti-draft message were still a seditious threat to recruitment and the morale of the war effort among blacks and youth.According to an article in The Amsterdam News, the FBI also came after Billie Holiday, when she sang a pacifist song in the middle of the war, forcing her manager to make her change her repertoire. See Denning (1997), p. 343. and they were hounded by hostile reviews, exposure of their Communist ties and negative coverage in the New York press, like the headline \\"Commie Singers try to Infiltrate Radio\\",\\"We got to sing [the pro-war song, 'Round and Round Hitler's Grave'] on January '42, on a nationwide CBS broadcast, 'This is War'. But the next day a headline in a major New York newspaper said 'Commie Singers try to Infiltrate Radio,' and that was the last job we got\\" (Where Have All the Flowers Gone [1993, 1997], p. 28). They disbanded in late 1942 or early 1943. In 1945, after the end of the war, Millard Lampell went on to become a successful screenwriter, writing under a pseudonym while blacklisted. The other founding Almanac members Pete Seeger and Lee Hays became President and Executive Secretary, respectively, of People's Songs, an organization with the goal of providing protest music to union activists, repeal of the Taft-Hartley Act, and electing Henry A. Wallace on the third, Progressive Party, ticket. People's Songs disbanded in 1948, after the defeat of Wallace. Seeger and Hays, joined by two of Hays' young friends, Ronnie Gilbert and Fred Hellerman, then began singing together again at fund-raising folk dances, with a repertoire geared to international folk music. The new singing group, appearing for a while in 1949 under the rubric, \\"The Nameless Quartet\\", changed their name to The Weavers and went on to achieve great renown.Doris Willens, Lonesome Traveler: The Life of Lee Hays (Lincoln, Nebraska and London: University of Nebraska Press, 1988) pp. 118, 119, and passim.

This album was not credited to the Almanac Singers, but to several individuals who were members of the band (Pete Seeger, Bess Lomax, and Butch Hawes) along with Tom Glazer. In 1961, this record was reissued by Folkways Records as one side of an LP entitled Songs of the Spanish Civil War, Vol. 1 (FH5436). The flip side of the LP was a re-release of the 1938 album Six Songs for Democracy, by Ernst Busch and the chorus of the Th√§lmann Battalion, 11th International Brigade.Six Songs for Democracy was recorded in Barcelona (1938) with bombs falling in the background. It was issued by Keynote in either 1938 or 1940 (Keynote 101). According to Maurice Isserman, it was one of Eleanor Roosevelt's favorite albums. The Th√§lmann Battalion was named for German Communist leader Ernst Th√§lmann. See Maurice Isserman, Which Side Are You On?

It is a multirole fighter for all-weather, air-to-air and air-to-surface deep interdiction missions. The Su-30 started out as an internal development project in the Sukhoi Su-27 family by Sukhoi. The design plan was revamped and the name was made official by the Russian Defense Ministry in 1996. Of the Flanker family, the Su-27, Su-30, Su-33, Su-34 and Su-35 have been ordered into limited or serial production by the Russian Defense Ministry. The Su-30 has two distinct version branches, manufactured by competing organisations: KnAAPO and the Irkut Corporation, both of which come under the Sukhoi group's umbrella. KnAAPO manufactures the Su-30MKK and the Su-30MK2, which were designed for and sold to China, and later Indonesia, Uganda, Venezuela, and Vietnam. Due to KnAAPO's involvement from the early stages of developing the Su-35, these are basically a two-seat version of the mid-1990s Su-35. The Chinese chose an older but lighter radar so the canards could be omitted in return for increased payload. It is a fighter with both air supremacy and attack capabilities, generally similar to the U.S F-15E Strike Eagle. Irkut traditionally served the Soviet Air Defense and, in the early years of Flanker development, was given the responsibility of manufacturing the Su-27UB, the two-seat trainer version. When India showed interests in the Su-30, Irkut offered the multirole Su-30MKI, which originated as the Su-27UB modified with avionics appropriate for fighters. Along with its ground-attack capabilities, the series adds features for the air-superiority role, such as canards, thrust-vectoring, and a long-range phased-array radar. Its derivatives include the Su-30MKM, MKA, and SM for Malaysia, Algeria, and Russia respectively. The Russian Air Force operates several Su-30s and has ordered the Su-30SM variant as well. Development While the original Su-27 had good range, it still did not have enough range for the Soviet Air Defense Forces (PVO, as opposed to VVS ‚Äì the Soviet Air Force). The Air Defense Forces needed to cover the vast expanse of the Soviet Union. Hence, development began in 1986 on the Su-27PU, an improved-capability variant of the Su-27 capable of serving as a long-range interceptor or airborne command post. The two-seat Su-27UB combat trainer was selected as the basis for the Su-27PU, because it had the performance of a single-seat Su-27 with seating for two crew members. A \\"proof-of-concept\\" demonstrator flew 6 June 1987, and this success led to the kick-off of development work on two Su-27PU prototypes. The first Su-27PU flew at Irkutsk on 31 December 1989, and the first of three pre-production models flew on 14 April 1992. Design Russian Air Force Sukhoi Su-30LL flying along the runway at Zhangjiajie Hehua Airport extremely close to the ground piloted by Anatoly Kvochur The Su-30 is a multirole fighter. It has a two-seat cockpit with an airbrake behind the canopy. =Flight characteristics= The integrated aerodynamic configuration, combined with the thrust vectoring control ability, results in high manoeuvrability and unique takeoff and landing characteristics. Equipped with a digital fly-by-wire system, the Su-30 is able to perform some very advanced manoeuvres, including the Pugachev's Cobra and the tailslide. These manoeuvers quickly decelerate the aircraft, causing a pursuing fighter to overshoot, as well as breaking a Doppler radar- lock, as the relative speed of the aircraft drops below the threshold where the signal registers to the radar. =Powerplant= The aircraft's powerplant incorporates two Saturn AL-31F afterburning low-bypass turbofan engines, fed through intake ramps. Two AL-31Fs, each rated at of full afterburning thrust ensures Mach 2 in level flight, 1,350 km/h speed at low altitude, and a 230 m/s climbing rate. With a normal fuel reserve of 5,270 kg, the Su-30MK is capable of performing a 4.5-hour combat mission with a range of 3,000 km. An aerial refueling system increases the range to or flight duration up to 10 hours at cruise altitudes. =Avionics= The aircraft features autopilot ability at all flight stages including low-altitude flight in terrain- following radar mode, and individual and group combat employment against air and ground/sea-surface targets. Automatic control system interconnected with the navigation system ensures route flight, target approach, recovery to airfield and landing approach in automatic mode. Operational history =Russia= In 1994‚Äì1996, an initial batch of five original Su-30 (Su-27PU) fighters, contracted for the Russian Defence Ministry, were delivered to 54th Guards Fighter Aviation Regiment based at Savasleyka air base. After the regiment was disbanded in 2002, the aircraft became part of 4th Centre for Combat Employment and Retraining of Personnel in Lipetsk where they were flown mostly by Russian Falcons aerobatic team. No further orders of the variant were made. However, the Russian Defence Ministry was impressed with the export Su-30MKI's performance envelope and ordered a total of 60 Su-30SM fighters, under two contracts signed in March and December 2012, respectively. On 21 September 2012, the Su-30SM performed its maiden flight. The Russian Air Force has received first two serial aircraft on 22 November 2012. By end of 2015, 31st Fighter Aviation Regiment, the last aviation regiment of the Russian Aerospace Forces that operated Soviet-made MiG-29A/UBs (izdeliye 9.12/9.13) was fully rearmed with about twenty new Su-30SM fighters. All aircraft of the first two contracts were delivered by 2016. Another 36 aircraft were ordered in April 2016, six of which intended for the Russian Naval Aviation. This was to increase the total number to 116 (88 in the Air Force and 28 in the Navy). In October‚ÄìNovember 2016, eight new aircraft were handed to Russian Knights aerobatic team, replacing the team's six Su-27 fighters. The aircraft are stationed at Kubinka air base, Moscow Oblast. During the 2017 MAKS International Aviation and Space Salon, it was announced that the Russian Defence Ministry and Irkut Corporation are working on modernization of Russia's Su-30SM fighters to a new \\"Su-30SM1\\" standard. The modernization is aimed on improvements in aircraft's avionics and armament. The Su-30SM attained full operational capability (FOC) in January 2018, by a resolution of the Russian president. In August 2019, the Russian Defence Ministry first signed a contract for undisclosed number of modernized Su-30SM2 (then referred to it as Su-30SM1) fighters. First deliveries to the Russian Aerospace Forces are scheduled for late 2020 with serial deliveries to commence in 2021. The aircraft will receive the N035 Irbis radar and AL-41F1S engines of the Su-35S, what is to standardize and reduce operational costs of the two variants. The aircraft's armament will be also enhanced of the new KAB-250 aerial bombs and Kh-59MK2 stealth cruise missiles. It is planned to modernize all Russia's Su-30SMs to the SM2 standard. On 25 August 2020, a contract for 21 modernized Su-30SM2 aircraft for the Russian Naval Aviaton was signed at the ¬´ARMY-2020¬ª military-technical forum. 2015 Russian military intervention in Syria In September 2015, Russia has deployed for the first time Su-30SM fighters to the Bassel Al-Assad International Airport in Latakia, Syria. At least four Su-30SM fighters were spotted in a satellite photo. In late December 2015, there were 16 Su-30SMs at Khmeimim Air Base. As part of their combat deployment, they provided target illumination for bombers launching airstrikes against Islamist rebel groups. Su-30SMs were initially tasked with aerial escort of Russian attack jets and strategic bombers but conducted also air to ground duties. On 21 March 2017, rebel forces launched a new offensive in the Hama province; a few days later a video emerged showing a Russian Air Force Su-30SM striking ground targets with unguided air-to-ground rockets in a dive attack against the rebels. On 3 May 2018, a Russian Air Force Su-30 crashed shortly after take-off from the Khmeimim Air Base, killing both crew members. According to Yury Borisov, the reliability indicators of the Su-30SM and Su-35S deployed to Syria exceeded the projected levels by several times, citing \\"The achieved reliability indicators‚Ä¶ of the new Su-35 and Su-30SM aircraft in intensive combat operation were three-four times higher than the standard.\\" =India= First talks about acquiring of new fighter for the Indian Air Force began in 1994. A year later, Sukhoi Design Bureau has started working on the new fighter based on the original Su-30 design, which later evolved into Su-30MK (Modernizirovannyi Kommercheskiy - Modernised Commercial) and ultimately into Su-30MKI (Modernizirovannyi Kommercheskiy Indiski - Modernised Commercial Indian). On 30 November 1996, Russian state company Rosvooruzhenie (now Rosoboronexport) and Indian Defence Ministry has signed a contract for development and production of eight Su-30Ks and 32 Su-30MKIs for the Indian Air Force. In March‚ÄìJuly 1997, all eight Su-30Ks of the order were delivered at Lohegaon Air Force Base in India. On 28 December 2000, as part of the Russian-Indian cooperation, a contract worth more than $US3 billion was signed for license production of 140 Su-30MKI fighters at Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) production plant in Nashik. Between 2002‚Äì2004, in accordance with the 1996 contract, 32 Su-30MKIs were built by Irkutsk Aviation Plant for the Indian Air Force. From 2004 onwards, production is carried by HAL. In 2007, India cleared to buy another 40 Su-30MKIs for a total of $US1.6 billion. In March 2010, it was reported India and Russia are negotiating a contract for additional 42 aircraft. The contract worth $US1.6 billion was signed in December 2011, increasing the total number of ordered aircraft up to 272. In March 2020, India has completed the production of all 272 Su-30MKIs ordered under previous contracts. The country is also considering acquisition of 12 more fighters to compensate losses over nearly 20 years of operation. =China= A PLAAF Sukhoi Su-30MKK at Lipetsk To better counter USAF's expanding capabilities in the region, in 1996, an agreement worth US$1.8 billion was reached with Russia to purchase some 38 multirole combat aircraft based on the original Su-30 design. Taking into account China's requirements for its new fighter, the aircraft became known as Su-30MKK (Modernizirovannyi Kommercheskiy Kitayski - Modernised Commercial Chinese). In March 1999, first prototype took off from Gromov Flight Research Institute in Russia and a year later it appeared at Zhuhai Air Show in China. People's Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF) has received first batch of ten Su-30MKK fighters in December 2000, following by second and third batches of ten fighters in August and December 2001, respectively. In July 2001, China has ordered 38 more Su-30MKK fighters. A modified variant, known as Su-30MK2, was negotiated for the People's Liberation Army Naval Air Force (PLANAF) in 2002, with contract for 24 aircraft signed in 2003. All the aircraft were delivered to PLANAF in 2004. By 2011, about 73 Su-30MKKs were in service with the PLAAF. =Malaysia= Malaysia has ordered 18 Su-30MKMs in May 2003.

Compared with the Su-27, the Su-33 has a strengthened undercarriage and structure, folding wings and stabilators, all for carrier operations. The Su-33 has canards and its wings are larger than the Su-27 for increased lift. The Su-33 has upgraded engines and a twin nose wheel, and is air refuelable. First used in operations in 1995 aboard the aircraft carrier , the fighter officially entered service in August 1998, by which time the designation \\"Su-33\\" was used. Following the break-up of the Soviet Union and the subsequent downsizing of the Russian Navy, only 24 aircraft were produced. Attempted sales to China and India fell through. With plans to retire the Su-33 once they reach the end of their service life, the Russian Navy ordered the MiG-29K as a replacement in 2009.  Development  = Background and origins = During the 1970s, the Yakovlev Yak-38, then the Soviet Navy's only operational carrier-based fixed-wing combat aircraft, was found to be unable to undertake its role due to limited range and payload, which severely hampered the capability of the Soviet Navy's Project 1143 carriers. It was decided to develop a bigger and more potent carrier capable of operating STOL aircraft. During the assessment period, a number of aircraft carriers were studied; the Project 1160 carrier would have been able to operate the MiG-23s and Su-24s, but was abandoned due to budget constraints. Design efforts were then concentrated on the Project 1153 carrier, which would have accommodated the Su-25s and the proposed MiG-23Ks and Su-27Ks. Sufficient funding was not secured, and the Navy looked at the possibility of a fifth, and larger, Project 1143 carrier, modified to allow for Yak-141, MiG-29K and Su-27K operations.Williams 2002, p. 126. To prepare for the operations of the Su-27K and the rival MiG-29K on-board the new carrier, work proceeded on the development of the steam catapult, arresting gear, optical and radio landing systems. The pilots were trained at a new establishment in Crimea, named NITKA, for Aviation Research and Training Complex. In 1981, the Soviet government ordered the abandonment of the catapult system as part of an overall downsize of Project 1143.5 carriers, which also included cancelling the fifth Project 1143 carrier and Varyag. A takeoff ramp was installed at the complex, where takeoffs would be executed to ensure that the Su-27Ks and MiG-29Ks would be able to operate from carriers.Eden 2004, p. 462. Both Sukhoi and Mikoyan modified their prototypes to validate the takeoff ramp. Three Sukhoi T10s (‚àí3, ‚àí24 and ‚àí25), along with an Su-27UB, were used for takeoffs from the simulated ramp. The first of these tests were undertaken by Nikolai Sadovnikov on 28 August 1982. Flight tests indicated the need for a change in ramp design, and it was modified to a ski-jump profile. Conceptual designs of the Su-27K commenced in 1978. On 18 April 1984, the Soviet government instructed Sukhoi to develop an air defence fighter; Mikoyan was ordered to build a lighter multirole fighter.Williams 2002, p. 127. Full-scale design of the Su-27K soon started as the \\"T-10K\\" under the guidance of Konstantin Marbyshev. Nikolai Sadovnikov was appointed the design bureau's Chief Test Pilot for the programme. By November 1984, conceptual design had passed its critical design review, with the detailed design finalised in 1986. The two prototypes were constructed in conjunction with KnAAPO in 1986‚Äì1987. = Testing = Admiral Kuznetsov in the Barents Sea, during a visit by Russian President Dmitry Medvedevalt=Rear port view of aqua-and-white jet aircraft lining up on aircraft carrier's deck, preparing for takeoff. The jet blast deflector is erected behind the aircraft. Three men in bright orange fluorescent tops stand underneath the jet's right wing A Su-33 landing aboard the Admiral Kuznetsov aircraft carrier The first Su-27K prototype, piloted by Viktor Pugachyov, made its maiden flight on 17 August 1987 at the NITKA facility; the second followed on 22 December. Flight tests continued at NITKA, where Su-27Ks and MiG-29Ks demonstrated and validated the feasibility of ski-jump operations. The pilots also practised no-flare landings before making an actual landing on a carrier deck. It was another two years before Tbilisi, subsequently renamed Admiral Kuznetsov, left the shipyard.Williams 2002, p. 129. Viktor Pugachyov, piloting the second Su-27K, became the first Russian to conventionally land aboard an aircraft carrier on 1 November 1989.Gordon 1999, p. 80. It was found that the carrier's jet blast deflectors were too close to the engine nozzles when raised at an angle of 60¬∞; thus an improvised solution held the deflectors at 45¬∞. However, when the aircraft was in front of it for longer than the maximum six seconds, the shield's water pipes exploded. The pilot, Pugachyov, reduced engine throttle, accidentally causing the detents (blocks used to restrain aircraft from accelerating) to retract and the fighter to move forwards. The aircraft was quickly stopped; Pugachyov later took off without the use of blast deflectors or detents. Since then, a Kamov Ka-27PS search-and-rescue helicopter was flown close to the carrier in case of an accident.Gordon 1999, p. 66. During the following three- week period, 227 sorties were amassed, along with 35 deck landings. Flight testing continued afterwards, and on 26 September 1991, naval pilots began testing the Su-27K; by 1994, it had successfully passed the State Acceptance Trials. During 1990‚Äì1991, seven production aircraft were rolled out. = Further developments = The first of two known versions of the Su-33, the twin-seat Su-33UB, made its first flight in April 1999. The aircraft, piloted by Viktor Pugachyov and Sergey Melnikov, flew for 40 minutes near Ramenskoye Airport. The Su-33UB (Initially named as Su-27KUB, \\"Korabelny Uchebno-Boevo\\", or \\"carrier combat trainer\\") was planned to be a trainer, but with the potential to fill other roles. Notable improvements over the Su-33 included a revised forward fuselage and leading edge slats, bigger wings and stabilators.Williams 2002, p. 131. = Modernization = In 2010, Sukhoi developed an upgraded version of the Su-33; flight trials began in October 2010. This modernized Su-33 was to compete with a potential Chinese indigenous version of the original Su-33, the Shenyang J-15, and to encourage orders from the Russian Navy.Fisher 2008, pp. 190‚Äì191. Major upgrades to the aircraft included more powerful (132 kN, 29,800 lbf) AL-31-F-M1 engines and a larger weapons carriage; upgrades to the radar and weapons were not possible at the time due to funding constraints.Fisher 2008, p. 191. According to military author Richard Fisher, it has been speculated that further modifications to a new production batch would include a phased-array radar, thrust-vectoring nozzles, and long-range anti-ship missiles. In September 2016, it was announced the Su-33 will be outfitted with new sighting and computing system SVP-24 from the Russian company Gefest & T, that will allow the aircraft to use unguided bombs with a similar precision as guided ones, giving it an ability of a strike fighter. The SVP-24 takes into account data such as current plane's location together with flight parameters, target data and environmental parameters and determines the optimal trajectory for unguided ammunition. It is believed, the installation of modern targeting systems will increase the capability of the Su-33 fighters close to Su-30SM level. The second stage of the modernization is to include installation of more powerful engines and detection systems, according to Naval Aviation Chief Major-General Igor Kozhin.  Design  alt=Angled rear view of fighter aircraft, with the engines showing prominently. Above the engines are the two uncanted vertical stabilizers; the wings and horizontal stabilizers are folded To adapt the original Su-27 for naval operations, Sukhoi first incorporated a reinforced structure and undercarriage to withstand the great stress experienced upon landing, particularly quick descents and non-flare landings (landings where the aircraft does not 'float' and slow its descent rate just prior to touchdown). The leading edge slats, flaperons and other control surfaces are enlarged to provide increased lift and manoeuvrability at low speeds, although the wingspan remains unchanged. The wings feature double-slotted flaps and outboard drooping ailerons; in total, the refinements enlarge the wing area by 10‚Äì12%.Williams 2002, p. 128. The wings and stabilators are modified for folding to maximise the number of aircraft the carrier can accommodate and to allow ease of movement on deck. The aircraft is outfitted with more powerful turbofan engines to increase thrust-to-weight ratio, as well as an in-flight refuelling probe. The Su-33 sports canards that shorten the take-off distance and improve manoeuvrability, but have required reshaping of the leading edge root extensions (LERX). The rear radome is shortened and reshaped to prevent its striking the deck during high-Alpha (angle of attack) landings.Eden 2004, p. 463. Compared with the rival MiG-29K, the Su-33's maximum takeoff weight (MTOW) is 50% higher; fuel capacity is more than double, allowing it to fly 80% further at altitude (or 33% at sea level). The MiG-29K can spend as much time as the Su-33 on station by using external fuel tanks, but this limits its ordnance capacity.Williams 2002, pp. 126, 128. The Su-33 can fly at speeds as low as , in comparison the MiG-29K needs to maintain a minimum of for effective control. However, the MiG-29K carries more air-to-ground munitions than the Su-33. The Su-33 is more expensive and physically larger than the MiG-29K, limiting the numbers able to be deployed on an aircraft carrier. The Su-33 carries guided missiles such as the R-73 (four) and R-27E (six) on twelve hardpoints, supplemented by the 150-round 30 mm GSh-30-1. It can carry an assortment of unguided rockets, bombs and cluster bombs for secondary air- to-ground missions. The aircraft can be used in both night and day operations at sea. The radar used, \\"Slot Back\\", has been speculated to have poor multi- target tracking, making the Su-33 reliant on other radar platforms and airborne warning and control system (AWACS) aircraft like the Kamov Ka-31 early-warning helicopter. The R-27EM missiles have the capability to intercept anti-ship missiles. The infra-red search and track (IRST) system is placed to provide better downward visibility.  Operational history  = Soviet Union and Russia = alt=Aqua and blue jet aircraft on aircraft carrier deck, with a group of men standing close-by. Behind the jet is the ship's island With the break-up of the Soviet Union, the Russian Navy was dramatically downsized, with many shipbuilding programmes stopped. If the Varyag, Oryol and had been commissioned, a total of 72 production airframes would have been built; the early-airborne warning and MiG-29K would also have proceeded, instead of being abandoned. Only 24 examples were built at the time Varyag was sold to China. The Su-27K was introduced in the mid-1990s and from December 1995 to March 1996, Admiral Kuznetsov set sail in the Mediterranean Sea, carrying two Su-25UTGs, nine Ka-27s, and 13 Su-27Ks.Williams 2002, p. 130. The aircraft officially entered service on 31 August 1998 under new designation \\"Su-33\\". The 279th independent Shipborne Assault Aviation Regiment based at Severomorsk-3 air base became the first unit operating the variant. In 2009, it was announced the Russian Navy will procure 24 MiG-29Ks to replace its fleet of about 19 Su-33s in service, with deliveries to be completed by 2015. However, in 2015, Chief of the Naval Aviation General Major Igor Kozhin, announced that a second fighter regiment would be formed to augment the current force, with the MiG-29Ks to be used by the new unit. The existing Su-33s were to be refurbished for further use. In September 2016, at least six Su-33s were upgraded with the SVP-24 targeting system as the aircraft were preparing for their combat deployment to Syria. In 2017, the United Engine Corporation announced it has resumed the production of upgraded AL-31F series 3 engines for Su-33 fighters. The first batch of engines was delivered to the customer the same year. 2015 Russian military intervention in Syria Pilots of the Russian Naval Aviation returning to the Severomorsk-3 air base after the Syrian operations On 15 November 2016, in the course of Russia's large-scale military operations against terrorist groups in Syria, Su-33s operated from the Admiral Kuznetsov aircraft carrier in the type's first combat employment, striking ISIL and Al-Nusra terrorist facilities in Syria's Idlib and Homs provinces with 500 kg precision ammuniton. The main targets were ammunition warehouses, gathering and training centers and weapon production plants. According to the Russian Defence Ministry, at least 30 militants including three field commanders were killed due to the strikes. On 5 December 2016, a Su-33 crashed into the Mediterranean Sea after the arrestor cable broke up during the aircraft's second landing attempt on board the aircraft carrier. The pilot managed to eject and survived without injuries. All the aircraft deployed in the Mediterranean returned back to the Severomorsk-3 air base on 3 February 2017. = Failed bids = Internationally, the People‚Äôs Republic of China was identified as a possible export customer. Russia's state weapons exporter, Rosoboronexport, was previously negotiating an order of 50 aircraft totalling US$2.5 billion. China would have initially acquired two aircraft worth $100 million for testing and then have further options to acquire an additional 12‚Äì48 aircraft. The fighters were intended to be used with the fledgling Chinese aircraft carrier programme, with the former Soviet carrier Varyag as the centrepiece. At the sixth Zhuhai Airshow in late 2006, Lieutenant General Aleksander Denisov publicly confirmed at a news conference that China had approached Russia for the possible purchase of Su-33s, and negotiations were to start in 2007. On 1 November 2006, the Xinhua News Agency published the information on its military website that China planned to introduce the Su-33. China had previously obtained a manufacturing license for Su-27 production. Sukhoi is working on a more advanced version, the Su-33K, a development to integrate the advanced technologies of the Su-35 fighters into the older Su-33 airframe. However, worries over other Chinese intentions emerged when it was reported that China had acquired one of the T-10Ks, a Su-33 prototype, from Ukraine, potentially to study and reverse engineer a domestic version.Fisher 2008, p. 190. Various aircraft are alleged to have originated partially from the Su-33, such as the Shenyang J-15. Photos of Shenyang aircraft designers posing in front of a T-10K carrier based fighter prototype strongly suggest that the J-15 is directly related to T-10K. Negotiations stagnated as the Shenyang Aircraft company sought to reduce Russian content in the aircraft, while Sukhoi wanted to ensure a level of income from future upgrades and modifications made to the J-11. India was also viewed as another potential operator of the Su-33. The Indian Navy planned to acquire the Su-33 for its aircraft carrier, , the refurbished Soviet , which was sold to India in 2004. In the end, the rival MiG-29K was opted for, because of the Su-33's outdated avionics. The size of the Su-33 reportedly led to concerns over potential difficulties in operating it off the Indian carriers, a constraint not shared by the smaller MiG-29K.Conley 2001, p. 69.

The aircraft made its first flight in 1989. It was delivered to the Republic of China Air Force (Taiwan) in January 1994 and entered service in 1997. All 130 production aircraft were manufactured by 1999. Taiwan initiated the IDF program when the United States refused to sell them F-20 Tigershark and F-16 Fighting Falcon jet fighters following diplomatic pressure from China. Taiwan therefore decided to develop an advanced indigenous jet fighter. The Aerospace Industrial Development Corporation (AIDC), based in Taichung, Taiwan, designed and built the IDF jet fighter. Development =Background= The preliminary search for a replacement for the ROCAF's F-5s and F-104s began with the XF-6 indigenous fighter project, later renamed Yin Yang, in the late 1970s. After the US established formal relations with China and ended the Mutual Defense Treaty with Taiwan, President Chiang Ching-Kuo decided to expand the indigenous defense industry and on August 28, 1980, ordered AIDC to design an indigenous interceptor. Originally, the ROCAF listed the priority of the XF-6 behind the XA-3 Lei Ming single seat attack aircraft, due to the believed high risks of the XF-6 project. The signing of the 1982 US-China Joint Communiqu√© limited arms sales to Taiwan. The United States refused to sell the General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon and the Northrop F-20 Tigershark (which had been developed largely to meet Taiwanese national defense needs for an advanced jet fighter to replace their older F-5 jet fightersLake 1996, pp. 29‚Äì30.) thereby ensuring the continuation of the indigenous fighter project. Although US President Ronald Reagan reluctantly accepted his advisers' suggestion of building relations with China to counter the USSR, Reagan decided to balance the 1982 US-PRC Communiqu√© with the \\"Six Assurances\\" to Taiwan. This opened the door for US technology transfer and assistance to Taiwan's defense industry, including the IDF project.Lake 1996, p. 30. =Design phase= Pre- production F-CK-1A model The AIDC officially began the IDF development project in May 1982 following the ROCAF's failure to purchase new fighters from the United States as a result of Chinese diplomatic pressure. The project was named An Hsiang (ÂÆâÁøî):Safe Flight)Lake 1996, pp. 30‚Äì31. and divided into four sections in 1983: *Yin-Yang (È∑πÊèö): \\"Soaring Eagle\\". Development of the airframe. Some cooperation with General Dynamics. *Yun-Han (Èõ≤Êº¢): \\"Cloud Man\\". Development of the aircraft powerplant and propulsion. Cooperation with Garrett (Now Honeywell). *Tien-Lei (Â§©Èõ∑): \\"Sky Thunder\\". Development of the avionics systems. Some cooperation with Smiths Industries, with some components purchased directly from Lear Astronics (today a subsidiary of BAE), Litton (today a subsidiary of Northrop Grumman) and Martin-Baker. *Tien-Chien (Â§©Âäç): \\"Sky Sword\\". Development of air-to-air missiles. In April 1997 American company Litton's Applied Technology division was awarded a production contract and options totaling $116.2 million by the Aerospace Industrial Development Corporation for Improved Radar Warning Receivers (IRWR) to be installed aboard. Yun Han: engine research Exports of advanced engines such as the General Electric F404 or the Pratt & Whitney F100 were not available to Taiwan and both the General Electric J85 and General Electric J79 were considered unsuitable in their performance, and most European and American engine companies declined to cooperate with the project. Joint investment with Garrett became the only practical solution. In 1978, following the success of the TFE731 engine, U.S. engine company Garrett announced joint research of the TFE1042 afterburner with the Swedish company Volvo Flygmotor. The TFE731 Model 1042 was touted as a low bypass ratio \\"military derivative of the proven commercial TFE731 engine\\" and that it would provide \\"efficient, reliable, cost effective propulsion for the next generation of light strike and advanced trainer aircraft\\", with a thrust of 4260 lbf (18.9 kN) dry and 6790 lbf (30.2 kN) with afterburner. After the initial negotiation, the investment was going to be divided between Garrett, Volvo, AIDC, and the Italian company Piaggio. The development would consist of the non-afterburning TFE1042-6 for light attack aircraft and advanced trainers, and the TFE1042-7 for the AMX or the F-5 upgrade. AIDC also suggested upgrading the TFE1042-7 to thrust in a twin- engine installation, in order to compete with the GE F404. However, the JAS 39 Gripen project decided to continue with a single F404, and Piaggio asked to participate at a later date due to financial concerns. ITEC completely redesigned the TFE1042-7 into the TFE1042-70 ‚Äì for example, the bypass ratio was changed from 0.84 to 0.4, and the investment had increased from US$180 million to about US$320 million. However, to avoid pressures from China, the US government had asked all American companies cooperating with the Taiwan on the IDF project to remain low-key. Therefore, the perception that \\"the TFE1042 is merely the civilian engine TFE731 with an afterburner\\" was never completely dispelled. In 1985, the preliminary review of the IDF's design revealed some performance requirement shortfalls, and it was determined that an upgrade of engine thrust by 10% was the simplest solution. Due to American export license restrictions, ITEC used FADEC to artificially limit the thrust below a certain altitude (the restriction was not removed until 1990). Although the upgrade essentially used the TFE1088-11 configuration, to reduce political interference ITEC renamed the original, lower-thrust version as the TFE1042-X70 and retained the TFE1042-70 designation for the upgraded version. In 1988, ITEC decided to invest in the thrust TFE1088-12, which was re- designated as the TFE1042-70A for political reason as well. Preliminary studies had shown that the IDF could supercruise with the new engine. At the same time, General Electric Aviation decided to enter the market with the J101/SF, a smaller version of the F404. However, after the IDF order was cut in half due to budget concerns, the TFE1088-12 engine upgrade plan ended as well. Yin Yang: aerodynamic design Landing at Tainan Air Base AIDC F-CK-1 Ching-kuo The cooperation between AIDC and General Dynamics (GD) was divided into four phases: * GD analyzed the ROCAF's aircraft performance and force requirements. * Taiwan assessed GD's reports and chose between AIDC's original design and GD's new design. * AIDC sent personnel to GD for the preliminary design phase. * GD sent personnel to Taiwan to complete the project. GD's assistance was restricted by the US State Department's arms export control, which limited GD's work to initial design consulting but not further development, production, or marketing.IDF 20th year roll out recollection. Retrieved Sept 14, 2009. Many different airframe design concepts were explored (e.g. the 2D Thrust-Vectoring nozzle of XX-201, the double delta wings/twin tailed 401). After the General Electric J79 was officially abandoned as the potential engine solution in 1983, three configurations emerged from AIDC. * Configuration A was similar to the F-5E. * Configuration B was similar to the Eurofighter Typhoon and Saab Gripen. * Configuration C was similar to the F-15. At the same time, GD worked on the G configuration in parallel. Eventually the G-4 was selected, but with many features of the C-2 integrated. During this time, the project was named the \\"Light Weight Defense Fighter\\". In 1985, the configuration conceptual design had evolved into the SE-1 preliminary design. By the end of 1985, AIDC decided to skip the prototype stage and go into Full Scale Development (FSD) directly, in order to reduce time and save money. The project was again renamed into the \\"Indigenous Defense Fighter\\". Four FSD aircraft were made, with three single-seaters and one double-seater. Tien Lei: Avionics Integration AIDC F-CK-1A cockpit The IDF is equipped with a GD-53 Golden Dragon multi-mode monopulse pulse- Doppler radar, which is based on the General Electric AN/APG-67 X band radar developed for the F-20 while sharing some components and technologies of the AN/APG-66 radar of the F-16A, and using a larger antenna than used by the F-20. and this adaptation resulted in the look-down and shoot-down capability of GD-53 being greatly enhanced in comparison to that of the original AN/APG-67, reaching that of the AN/APG-66. The radar can simultaneously track 10 targets and engage two of the 10 targets tracked with TC-2 active radar seeker BVRAAMs. The design is inherently unstable in pitch, so the IDF incorporated a modern triple-redundant full authority fly-by-wire control system. The avionics suite was based on modular architecture with dual redundant MIL-STD-1553B digital databuses. The Honeywell H423 inertial navigation system, the TWS-95 RHAWS, and the Bendix-King head-up display were selected.Lake 1996, pp. 34‚Äì35. Some capabilities may have been delayed or dropped in order to meet the performance requirement, since the engine limitation has resulted in the necessity of strict weight control. Tien Chien: Missile R&D; The CSIST's Tien Chien (Sky Sword) project was slightly more independent, since it was considered to be a development for all the ROCAF's aircraft rather than only the IDF. The Tien Chien 1 (TC-1) is a short range infrared-seeking missile with an external configuration similar to that of the AIM-9 Sidewinder,Lake 1996, pp. 35‚Äì36. while the Tien Chien 2 (TC-2) is an active radar homing Beyond Visual Range missile. The first test firing of the TC-1 missile was performed by an F-5E in April 1986, with the Beech target drone successfully destroyed. Initial production of the TC-1 began in 1989, and it entered service in 1991. Both the AIM-9 and the TC-1 have been seen in use on operational IDFs. CSIST is believed to have cooperated with Motorola and Raytheon on the TC-2's active seeker, which is believed to be based on their seeker design which was proposed for the AIM-120. 40 pre-production TC-2 missiles were produced before 1995, and were the only BVR AAMs that the ROCAF had in its inventory during the 1995‚Äì96 Taiwan Strait Missile Crisis. Over 200 production TC-2s were originally planned. =Upgrades= During the F-CK-1‚Äôs development it was tapped as the secondary delivery vehicle for the Taiwanese nuclear weapons then in development. The primary delivery method was to be the Sky Horse missile. Weapons designers at CSIST were instructed to design the nuclear weapon to fit within the dimensions of the F-CK-1‚Äôs centerline drop tank (~50cm diameter). Modifications to the aircraft would have been required for it to obtain the desired 1,000km range (especially without the centerline drop tank available) and were envisioned to include more efficient non-afterburning engines. The F-CK-1 would not have been able to fulfill the nuclear strike mission until mid-1989 at the very earliest. Early designs called for an unpowered gravity bomb. The nuclear weapons program was shut down under US pressure before the F-CK-1 entered service and the dedicated nuclear strike variant was never produced. The first stage of upgrades to the fleet was originally planned to be completed by 2013, and was planned to include improved avionics, radar, electronics, weapons capabilities and lifespan extensions.\\"Taiwan to complete 1st upgrades to locally made fighters in 2013.\\" In May 2014, the ROC Air Force made photos of the fighters with enhanced Wan Chien long-range missile capabilities public. The upgrade program was finally completed in 2018. Variants =F-CK-1 A/B Ching-Kuo= ROCAF F-CK-1B 1607 Taxiing at Ching Chuang Kang Air Force Base The first successful test flight by FSD A1 was made on May 28, 1989.Lake 1996, p. 39. The first two-seater (and the fourth prototype), FSD B1, conducted its first flight on July 10, 1990. The first successful firing of the Tien-Chien II (Sky Sword II) air-to-air missile took place in 1992, with the ROCAF establishing its first F-CK-1 squadron the following year with a batch of 10 pre-production aircraft. The ROCAF's initial order for 256 aircraft was cut to 130 in 1991, following deals for the purchase of 150 F-16 Block 20 A/B and 60 Mirage 2000-5Ei/Di with the US and France.Lake 1996, pp. 40‚Äì41. The last IDF A/B rolled off the production line in 1999. Mid-life updates to the aircraft were initiated in 2011. =F-CK-1 C/D Hsiang Sheng= F-CK-1C&D Fighter Model Display at AIDC Booth The F-CK-1D prototype (\\"Brave Hawk\\"), with the accompanying F-CK-1C single-seater prototype in the background, at their public unveiling. F-CK-1C/D cockpit view The Ministry of National Defense (MND) announced that beginning in 2001, the government would include a new budget allocation for the IDF upgrade plan (as included in the five MND proposals to help AIDC). The five proposals were: * Upgrades of the AT-3, IDF, and F-5 would be assigned to AIDC in the future. * The Army Utility Helicopter, the Navy's long range ASW aircraft, a helicopter for the Marines, and an Air Force medium transport will all be produced and assembled by qualifying domestic firms in conjunction with the foreign firms that originally designed them. * NCSIST and AIDC will jointly assemble a team for the early planning of the ROCAF's next generation fighter, in order to assess procurement methods and suggest concepts. * AIDC's joint ventures with foreign firms or alliances with domestic firms will be given high priority in military aircraft service and maintenance. * In the future, the military will give responsibility for weapons system flight tests, electronic warfare exercises, air towing drones, avionics maintenance, and weapons procurement planning to AIDC, in situations where AIDC has the professional capacity that the military lack. This is part of the seven-year IDF C/D R&D; plan (FY2001~FY2007), which allocates 10 million New Taiwanese Dollars (NTD) annually for a total of 70 million NTD for both CSIST and AIDC. Initial media reports indicated that the upgraded IDF would be called the \\"Joint Countermeasure Platform\\". In 2001, it was reported that development of a new \\"stealth\\" variant with more powerful engines and improved fire-control system would commence that year. In a 2006 interview with Jane's Defence Weekly, former AIDC Chairman Sun Tao-Yu said that two new prototypes had been manufactured. The upgrade would allow the IDF to carry an additional 771 kg of fuel. In addition, it includes an improved avionics suite, retrofitted electronic warfare capabilities, and new weapons systems. The landing gear has been strengthened to accommodate the additional payload and fuel, but the plan for a dielectric radar-absorbing \\"stealth\\" fuselage was dropped due to concerns over weight. The project consists of three phases: * Increase the carrying capacity for the TC-2 beyond-visual range air-to-air missile from two to four. Integrate the TC-2A anti-radiation missile and the Wan Chien cluster bomb. In addition, two conformal fuel tanks were seen on the two newly built prototype aircraft, these are not seen on production upgrades. * Upgrade the mission computers, the electronic counter-countermeasures, the electronic warfare systems, the Active Identification Friend or Foe (AIFF) system and the terrain-following radar. * Ground and air testing. The development contract for the upgraded 32-bit IDF C/D flight control computer was awarded in 2002 to BAE Systems. AIDC said that the improvements of the flight computer will result in \\"a safer, higher-performing aircraft.‚Äù Other improvements made include enhanced electronic warfare capabilities, a strengthened landing gear and a digital anti-skid system. The upgrade also included new indigenous flight control software ending the reliance on US controlled source code. The first test flight of the upgraded IDF was reportedly successfully completed a few days ahead of schedule in early October. On March 27, 2007, President Chen Shui-Bian witnessed a test flight of F-CK-1D, and announced that the upgraded IDF will be named Hsiung Ying (Brave Hawk), which signifies that the new fighter would protect the homeland just like the Crested Goshawk. As of 12/2009, 71 F-CK-1 A/B are upgrading to F-CK-1 C/D over 4 years span for over US$500 million, according to AIDC CEO, under Project Hsiang Chan (ÁøîÂ±ï), as AIDC and ROCAF had signed a contract for the expected upgrade program. In 2018 AIDC delivered the last upgraded F-CK-1 C/D to the Republic of China Air Force. =IDF Lead-in Fighter Trainer= According to the media, the AIDC IDF trainer concept apparently involved the removal of the fire control radar and combat systems with the retention of rear-seat flight controls, so that the IDF could be used as a lead-in fighter trainer (LIFT). The ROCAF seemed to have reservations with the concept, however, as it would mean the IDF LIFT would not be usable in wartime. A MND letter said, \\"Regarding the newspaper report of AIDC's desire to use the IDF fighter as a basis for supersonic trainer development, it is only that company's operational planning concept. The Ministry of National Defense and the Air Force currently do not have such a plan\\". The letter then said that due to a tight budget allocation the ROCAF would instead ask AIDC to extend the life of the AT-3 and continue to use the F-5 in the LIFT role. In 2003, the former AIDC Chairman Huang Jung-Te said that AIDC still hoped the ROCAF would consider using a simplified version of the IDF for LIFT, and that such a concept could have a cost as low as US$16 million per unit, compared to the T-50's 19 million. However, the F-CK-1 LIFT modifications or new production concepts never received government funding or approval. In May 2006, Lt. General Cheng Shih-Yu testified that the MND indeed plans to retire the F-5E/F by 2010 and allow the in-service IDFs to take over training missions. It is unclear what modifications (if any) will be made to IDFs after they become trainers. Operators ; *Republic of China (Taiwan) Air Force ‚Äì 131 aircraft, including 6 pre-production aircraft.

It is intended for use both by air platforms as individual missiles as well as ground units and ships, which can be equipped with the rapid fire MICA Vertical Launch System. It is fitted with a thrust vector control (TVC) system. It was developed from 1982 onward by Matra. The first trials occurred in 1991, and the missile was commissioned in 1996 to equip the Rafale and Mirage 2000. It is a replacement for both the Super 530 in the interception role and the Magic II in the dogfighting role. On 11 June 2007, a MICA launched from a Rafale successfully demonstrated its over-the-shoulder capability by destroying a target behind the launch aircraft. The target was designated by another aircraft and coordinates were transmitted by Link 16. Characteristics There are two MICA variants; MICA RF has an active radar homing seeker and MICA IR has an imaging infra-red homing seeker. Both seekers are designed to filter out counter-measures such as chaff and decoy flares. A thrust vector control unit fitted to the rocket motor increases the missile's agility. The missile is capable of lock-on after launch (LOAL) which means it is capable of engaging targets outside its seeker's at-launch acquisition range. Mounted on the Rafale, the MICA IR can provide IR imagery to the central data processing system, thus acting as an extra sensor. Salon du Bourget 2015 MICA can also be employed as a short-range surface-to-air missile. It is available in a ground-based version, VL MICA, fired from a truck-mounted box launcher, and a naval version, VL MICA-M, fired from a ship- fitted vertical launch system. On October 23, 2008, 15:30, at CELM, Biscarosse (Landes), a VL MICA missile successfully performed the last of its 14 test firings meaning it is now ready for mass production. The target drone was flying at low level, over the sea, 12 km away; despite this distance, MICA, equipped with an active radar seeker, locked on the target and shot it down. Corvettes too small to have the big and costly Aster missile system are the most likely customers for the VL MICA-M, which offers similar capability as the Aster 15 but without its booster and PIF-PAF vectorial control.. While the VL MICA has an advertised range of 20 km, aerodynamic performance is significantly degraded at those ranges. From 0 to 7 km MICA has maneuverability of 50g, however by 12 km this is reduced to 30g as energy is lost..

Despite the media attention, he always remained loyal and discreet. Early life Terry Major-Ball was born in 1932, and grew up in Worcester Park, Surrey. His father, Tom Major-Ball (real name Abraham Thomas Ball), was a music hall performer and circus artiste under the name Tom Major, and combined the two surnames when he started a garden ornament business. His mother, Gwen, Tom's second wife, was a dancer. Unlike his elder sister Pat and younger brother John, Major-Ball failed his 11 plus exam and went to Stoneleigh East Secondary Modern School. During the Second World War, they were evacuated to Norfolk. After World War II, Major-Ball did National Service with the Royal Army Medical Corps in Germany. After being demobilised, Major-Ball tried, without success, to save his ailing father's business, Major's Garden Ornaments, which was finally taken over by a competitor in 1962. The family's reduced circumstances forced them to move into rented rooms in Coldharbour Lane in Brixton. To supplement the family's income, Terry Major-Ball took many menial jobs. While working at Woolworths in Brixton in 1958, he met Shirley Wilson, whom he married in 1960. Major-Ball later became a meter installer for South Eastern Electricity Board and a banker. Brother's premiership Terry Major-Ball first came to the spotlight in November 1990, when his brother John became Prime Minister after the Conservative leadership election. During Major's premiership his brother became a media favourite. In 1994 he published his autobiography Major Major: Memories of an Older Brother, which was ghost- written by the journalist James Hughes-Onslow. It received good reviews and Major-Ball became a regular at book launches. It was praised as \\"one of the great comic books of the year\\" by John Wells and \\"exquisitely funny\\" by Auberon Waugh. He always remained loyal to his brother and, amongst other things, kept secret his knowledge of the affair between Major and Edwina Currie and the details of a secret half-brother. In 1995 he appeared on Have I Got News for You and The Mrs Merton Show. In 1993, after noting that he had only been abroad once, to Germany while on National Service, and had never stayed in a hotel, The Evening Standard arranged for him to fly first-class to New York, where he met Liza Minnelli. Terry Major-Ball later went to Christchurch, New Zealand, to open a garden gnome festival. He had columns in The Daily Express, The Daily Mail and The Guardian. Major-Ball also made a BBC2 travel programme called A Postcard to my Brother, where he visited France, Germany and Poland. Later years Following John's departure from office after the 1997 general election, Terry Major-Ball's fame dwindled. In 2003, he moved to Somerset from Croydon, London, where he spent the remaining years of his life until his death from prostate cancer on 13 March 2007 in a hospice in Chard, Somerset. He had a private funeral, and his death was announced on 20 April 2007. He was survived by his wife and children.

Location: Three Arch Bay, Laguna Beach, CA. Photogrammetry is the science and technology of obtaining reliable information about physical objects and the environment through the process of recording, measuring and interpreting photographic images and patterns of electromagnetic radiant imagery and other phenomena.ASPRS online Photogrammetry appeared in the middle of the 19th century, almost simultaneously with the appearance of photography itself. The use of photographs to create topographic maps was first proposed by the French surveyor Dominique F. Arago in about 1840. The term photogrammetry was coined by the Prussian architect Albrecht Meydenbauer,https://www.cices.org/pdf/P&RSinformation.pdf; which appeared his 1867 article \\"Die Photometrographie.\\"Albrecht Meydenbauer: Die Photometrographie. In: Wochenblatt des Architektenvereins zu Berlin Jg. 1, 1867, Nr. 14, S. 125‚Äì126 (Digitalisat); Nr. 15, S. 139‚Äì140 (Digitalisat); Nr. 16, S. 149‚Äì150 (Digitalisat). There are many variants of photogrammetry. One example is the extraction of three-dimensional measurements from two- dimensional data (i.e. images); for example, the distance between two points that lie on a plane parallel to the photographic image plane can be determined by measuring their distance on the image, if the scale of the image is known. Another is the extraction of accurate color ranges and values representing such quantities as albedo, specular reflection, metallicity, or ambient occlusion from photographs of materials for the purposes of physically based rendering. Close-range photogrammetry refers to the collection of photography from a lesser distance than traditional aerial (or orbital) photogrammetry. Photogrammetric analysis may be applied to one photograph, or may use high- speed photography and remote sensing to detect, measure and record complex 2D and 3D motion fields by feeding measurements and imagery analysis into computational models in an attempt to successively estimate, with increasing accuracy, the actual, 3D relative motions. From its beginning with the stereoplotters used to plot contour lines on topographic maps, it now has a very wide range of uses such as sonar, radar, and lidar.  Methods  A data model of photogrammetry Photogrammetry uses methods from many disciplines, including optics and projective geometry. Digital image capturing and photogrammetric processing includes several well defined stages, which allow the generation of 2D or 3D digital models of the object as an end product. The data model on the right shows what type of information can go into and come out of photogrammetric methods. The 3D coordinates define the locations of object points in the 3D space. The image coordinates define the locations of the object points' images on the film or an electronic imaging device. The exterior orientation of a camera defines its location in space and its view direction. The inner orientation defines the geometric parameters of the imaging process. This is primarily the focal length of the lens, but can also include the description of lens distortions. Further additional observations play an important role: With scale bars, basically a known distance of two points in space, or known fix points, the connection to the basic measuring units is created. Each of the four main variables can be an input or an output of a photogrammetric method. Algorithms for photogrammetry typically attempt to minimize the sum of the squares of errors over the coordinates and relative displacements of the reference points. This minimization is known as bundle adjustment and is often performed using the Levenberg‚ÄìMarquardt algorithm. = Stereophotogrammetry = A special case, called stereophotogrammetry, involves estimating the three-dimensional coordinates of points on an object employing measurements made in two or more photographic images taken from different positions (see stereoscopy). Common points are identified on each image. A line of sight (or ray) can be constructed from the camera location to the point on the object. It is the intersection of these rays (triangulation) that determines the three-dimensional location of the point. More sophisticated algorithms can exploit other information about the scene that is known a priori, for example symmetries, in some cases allowing reconstructions of 3D coordinates from only one camera position. Stereophotogrammetry is emerging as a robust non-contacting measurement technique to determine dynamic characteristics and mode shapes of non-rotating and rotating structures.  Integration Photogrammetric data with a dense range data in which scanners complement each other. Photogrammetry is more accurate in the x and y direction while range data are generally more accurate in the z direction . This range data can be supplied by techniques like LiDAR, laser scanners (using time of flight, triangulation or interferometry), white-light digitizers and any other technique that scans an area and returns x, y, z coordinates for multiple discrete points (commonly called \\"point clouds\\"). Photos can clearly define the edges of buildings when the point cloud footprint can not. It is beneficial to incorporate the advantages of both systems and integrate them to create a better product. A 3D visualization can be created by georeferencing the aerial photosA. Sechin. Digital Photogrammetric Systems: Trends and Developments. GeoInformatics. #4, 2014, pp. 32-34. and LiDAR data in the same reference frame, orthorectifying the aerial photos, and then draping the orthorectified images on top of the LiDAR grid. It is also possible to create digital terrain models and thus 3D visualisations using pairs (or multiples) of aerial photographs or satellite (e.g. SPOT satellite imagery). Techniques such as adaptive least squares stereo matching are then used to produce a dense array of correspondences which are transformed through a camera model to produce a dense array of x, y, z data which can be used to produce digital terrain model and orthoimage products. Systems which use these techniques, e.g. the ITG system, were developed in the 1980s and 1990s but have since been supplanted by LiDAR and radar-based approaches, although these techniques may still be useful in deriving elevation models from old aerial photographs or satellite images.  Applications  Horatio Nelson bust in Monmouth Museum, produced using photogrammetry Gibraltar 1 Neanderthal skull 3D wireframe model, created with 123d Catch Photogrammetry is used in fields such as topographic mapping, architecture, engineering, manufacturing, quality control, police investigation, cultural heritage, and geology. Archaeologists use it to quickly produce plans of large or complex sites, and meteorologists use it to determine the wind speed of tornados when objective weather data cannot be obtained.

It is also used to combine live action with computer-generated imagery in movies post-production; The Matrix is a good example of the use of photogrammetry in film (details are given in the DVD extras). Photogrammetry was used extensively to create photorealistic environmental assets for video games including The Vanishing of Ethan Carter as well as EA DICE's Star Wars Battlefront. The main character of the game Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice was derived from photogrammetric motion- capture models taken of actress Melina Juergens. Photogrammetry is also commonly employed in collision engineering, especially with automobiles. When litigation for accidents occurs and engineers need to determine the exact deformation present in the vehicle, it is common for several years to have passed and the only evidence that remains is accident scene photographs taken by the police. Photogrammetry is used to determine how much the car in question was deformed, which relates to the amount of energy required to produce that deformation. The energy can then be used to determine important information about the crash (such as the velocity at time of impact). =Mapping= Photomapping is the process of making a map with \\"cartographic enhancements\\"Petrie (1977: 50) that have been drawn from a photomosaicPetrie (1977: 49) that is \\"a composite photographic image of the ground\\" or more precisely as a controlled photomosaic where \\"individual photographs are rectified for tilt and brought to a common scale (at least at certain control points).\\" Rectification of imagery is generally achieved by \\"fitting the projected images of each photograph to a set of four control points whose positions have been derived from an existing map or from ground measurements. When these rectified, scaled photographs are positioned on a grid of control points, a good correspondence can be achieved between them through skillful trimming and fitting and the use of the areas around the principal point where the relief displacements (which cannot be removed) are at a minimum.\\"Petrie (1977: 50) \\"It is quite reasonable to conclude that some form of photomap will become the standard general map of the future.\\"Robinson et al. (1977:10) go on to suggest that, \\"photomapping would appear to be the only way to take reasonable advantage\\" of future data sources like high altitude aircraft and satellite imagery. The highest resolution aerial photomaps on GoogleEarth are approximately spatial resolution images. The highest resolution photomap of ortho images was made in Hungary in 2012 with a spatial resolution. =Archaeology= Using a pentop computer to photomap an archaeological excavation in the field Demonstrating the link between orthophotomapping and archaeology,Estes et al.

She was living in Oxford, England, at the time. As an adult she worked as an accountant and a teacher. Biography Venetia Burney was the daughter of Rev. Charles Fox Burney, Oriel Professor of the Interpretation of Holy Scripture at Oxford, and his wife Ethel Wordsworth Burney (n√©e Madan). She was the granddaughter of Falconer Madan (1851‚Äì1935), Librarian of the Bodleian Library of the University of Oxford. Falconer Madan's brother, Henry Madan (1838‚Äì1901), Science Master of Eton, had in 1878 suggested the names Phobos and Deimos for the moons of Mars. On 14 March 1930, Falconer Madan read the story of the new planet's discovery in The Times, and mentioned it to his granddaughter Venetia. She suggested the name Pluto ‚Äì the Roman God of the Underworld who was able to make himself invisible ‚àí and Falconer Madan forwarded the suggestion to astronomer Herbert Hall Turner, who cabled his American colleagues at Lowell Observatory. Clyde Tombaugh liked the proposal because it started with the initials of Percival Lowell who had predicted the existence of Planet X, which they thought was Pluto because it was coincidentally in that position in space. On 1 May 1930, the name Pluto was formally adopted for the new celestial body. Whether she was really the first person to propose the name has been doubted on plausibility grounds,Geoff Nunberg. Another Plutonian casualty? Language Log. 27 August 2006. but the historical fact is that she was credited as such. Burney was educated at Downe House School in Berkshire and Newnham College, Cambridge, where she studied mathematics. After graduation she became a chartered accountant. Later she became a teacher of economics and mathematics at girls‚Äô schools in southwest London. She was married to Edward Maxwell Phair from 1947 until his death in 2006. Her husband, a classicist, later became housemaster and head of English at Epsom College. She died on 30 April 2009, aged 90, in Banstead in Surrey. She was buried at Randalls Park Crematorium in Leatherhead in Surrey. Only a few months before the reclassification of Pluto from a planet to a dwarf planet, with a debate going on about the issue, she said in an interview, \\"At my age, I've been largely indifferent [to the debate]; though I suppose I would prefer it to remain a planet.\\" Legacy The asteroid 6235 Burney and Burney Crater on Pluto were named in her honour. In July 2015 the New Horizons spacecraft was the first to visit Pluto and carried an instrument named Venetia Burney Student Dust Counter in her honour. Massachusetts rock band The Venetia Fair came up with their name after reading about Venetia Phair, shortly after Pluto was reclassified as a dwarf planet.

It calls upon humanity to help create a global partnership at a critical juncture in history. The Earth Charter's ethical vision proposes that environmental protection, human rights, equitable human development, and peace are interdependent and indivisible. The Charter attempts to provide a new framework for thinking about and addressing these issues. The Earth Charter Initiative organization exists to promote the Charter. History The idea of the Earth Charter originated in 1987, by Maurice Strong and Mikhail Gorbachev as members of The Club of Rome, when the United Nations World Commission on Environment and Development called for a new charter to guide the transition to sustainable development. In 1992, the need for a charter was urged by then-Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali at the Rio de Janeiro Earth Summit, but the time for such a declaration was not believed to be right. The Rio Declaration became the statement of the achievable consensus at that time. In 1994, Maurice Strong (Chairman of the Earth Summit) and Mikhail Gorbachev, working through organizations they each founded (the Earth Council and Green Cross International respectively), restarted the Earth Charter as a civil society initiative, with the help of the government of the Netherlands.Maurice Strong: \\"History of the Earth Charter\\" . Strong died in November 2015. \\"The Ark of Hope} was created for a celebration of the Earth Charter held at Shelburne Farms, Vermont on September 9, 2001.\\" Drafting The drafting of the text was done during a six-year worldwide consultation process (1994‚Äì2000), overseen by the independent Earth Charter Commission, which was convened by Strong and Gorbachev with the purpose of developing a global consensus on values and principles for a sustainable future. The Commission continues to serve as the steward of the Earth Charter text. One of the members of the Earth Charter Commission and Steering Committee was Steven Clark Rockefeller, who, among other things is professor emeritus of Religion at Middlebury College and an advisory trustee of the Rockefeller Brothers Fund. According to a 2001 interview with Rockefeller, he \\"chaired the Earth Charter international drafting committee\\". Other members included Amadou Toumani Tour√© (Mali), Princess Basma bint Talal (Jordan), Mohamed Sahnoun (Algeria), A. T. Ariyaratne (Sri Lanka), Wakako Hironaka (Japan), Erna Witoelar (Indonesia), Ruud Lubbers (The Netherlands), Federico Mayor (Spain), Mercedes Sosa (Argentina), Leonardo Boff (Brazil), Yolanda Kakabadse (Ecuador), Shridath Ramphal (Guyana), Elizabeth May (Canada), Severn Cullis-Suzuki (Canada), and others. The final text of the Earth Charter was approved at a meeting of the Earth Charter Commission at the UNESCO headquarters in Paris in March 2000. The official launch was on 29 June 2000 in a ceremony at The Peace Palace in The Hague, Netherlands. Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands attended the ceremony.  Contents  The approximately 2,400 word document is divided into sections (called pillars), which have sixteen main principles containing sixty-one supporting principles.Nigel Dower, University of Aberdeen (2004): \\"The Earth Charter as a Global Ethic\\", p. 4. The document opens with a preamble and ends with a conclusion entitled ‚ÄúThe Way Forward‚Äù. =Preamble= = Principles = The four pillars and sixteen principles of the Earth Charter are: I. Respect and Care for the Community of Life 1. Respect Earth and life in all its diversity. 2. Care for the community of life with understanding, compassion and love. 3. Build democratic societies that are just, participatory, sustainable and peaceful. 4. Secure Earth's bounty and beauty for present and future generations. II. Ecological Integrity 5. Protect and restore the integrity of Earth's ecological systems, with special concern for biological diversity and the natural processes that sustain life. 6. Prevent harm as the best method of environmental protection and, when knowledge is limited, apply a precautionary approach. 7. Adopt patterns of production, consumption and reproduction that safeguard Earth's regenerative capacities, human rights and community well-being. 8. Advance the study of ecological sustainability and promote the open exchange and wide application of the knowledge acquired. III. Social and Economic Justice 9. Eradicate poverty as an ethical, social and environmental imperative. 10. Ensure that economic activities and institutions at all levels promote human development in an equitable and sustainable manner. 11. Affirm gender equality and equity as prerequisites to sustainable development and ensure universal access to education, health care and economic opportunity. 12. Uphold the right of all, without discrimination, to a natural and social environment supportive of human dignity, bodily health and spiritual well-being, with special attention to the rights of indigenous peoples and minorities. IV. Democracy, Nonviolence, and Peace 13. Strengthen democratic institutions at all levels, and provide transparency and accountability in governance, inclusive participation in decision-making, and access to justice. 14. Integrate into formal education and lifelong learning the knowledge, values and skills needed for a sustainable way of life. 15. Treat all living beings with respect and consideration. 16. Promote a culture of tolerance, nonviolence and peace.

It is named after colonial settler Jonas Bronck. The Bronx River is the only fresh water river in New York City.; all the other rivers within the city are straits and tidal estuaries, and the tidal lower reach of the Hudson River. It originally rose in what is now the Kensico Reservoir, in Westchester County north of New York City. With the construction of the Kensico Dam in 1885, however, the river was cut off from its natural headwaters and today a small tributary stream serves as its source. The Bronx River flows south past White Plains, then south-southwest through the northern suburbs in New York, passing through Edgemont, Tuckahoe, Eastchester, and Bronxville. It forms the border between the large cities of Yonkers and Mount Vernon, and flows into the northern end of The Bronx, where it divides East Bronx from West Bronx, southward through Bronx Park, New York Botanical Garden, and the Bronx Zoo and continues through neighborhoods of the South Bronx. It empties into the East River, a tidal strait connected to Long Island Sound, between the Soundview and Hunts Point neighborhoods. In the 17th century, the river‚Äîcalled by the natives \\"Aquehung\\"‚Äîserved as a boundary between loosely associated bands under sachems of the informal confederacy of the Wecquaesgeek, Europeanized as the Wappinger; the east bank of the river was the boundary for the Siwanoy, clammers and fishermen.

Pollution Botanical Garden Lorillard Snuff Mill During the 19th and 20th centuries, the river became a natural sewer into which industrial waste was poured every day. An early mill on the industrialized river was the Lorillard Snuff Mill, preserved in the grounds of the New York Botanical Garden. With the decline of manufacturing in the area, the river continued to receive water pollution from the communities that lined its banks. In December 1948, flow of the Bronx River was changed to eliminate a curve in its course in Bronxville, to create land in the old riverbed on which to construct an addition to Lawrence Hospital. During the excavations a large sand bar was uncovered where sand had accumulated at the bend over hundreds of years and made a sandy beach. In the 21st century, environmental groups including the Bronx River Alliance proposed to return the river to its original state as a clean waterway.Bronx River Alliance. Bronx, NY. \\"What We Do.\\" Accessed 2009-02-26. The river became a favorite project of U.S. Representative Jos√© Serrano, who secured US$14.6 million in federal funding to support the rehabilitation of the waterway, into which some Westchester towns continued to discharge raw sewage intermittently, as sanitary sewer overflows, as late as 2006. Under a November 28, 2006 agreement, the municipalities of Scarsdale, White Plains, Mount Vernon and Greenburgh agreed to stop dumping sewage in the Bronx River by May 1, 2007. Urban runoff pollution continues to be a serious problem for the river. The Bronx River Watershed Coalition, a partnership of local and state agencies, citizen groups and non-profit organizations, have developed watershed management plans to reduce stormwater pollution and improve water quality.Westchester County Department of Planning, White Plains, NY. \\"Bronx River Watershed Coalition.\\" Accessed 2009-02-27.

Department of Parks & Recreation. \\"Herring return to the Bronx.\\" The Daily Plant (newsletter). March 28, 2006. The alewife were expected to spawn in the river's headwaters. Their offspring would spend the summer in the river, migrate out to sea in the fall, and in three to five years return, like all anadromous fishes, to their spawning grounds. Stocking was intended to be repeated annually for the following five years, to build up the new resident population. The fishes, among a group called \\"river herring,\\" feed low on the food-chain and help reduce eutrophication. And in fact, several adult alewife were found below the first dam on the river on April 7, 2009. As an analysis revealed they were 3 years old, the assumption of scientists is that these were in fact descendants of the alewife released 3 years before in March 2006. The next step will be to erect fish ladders over the 3 dams lowest on the river, allowing the alewife access to a portion of the river with more suitable spawning habitat. In February 2007 biologists with the Wildlife Conservation Society, which operates the Zoo, spotted a beaver (Castor canadensis) in the river. \\"There has not been a sighting of a beaver lodge or a beaver in New York City for over 200 years. It sounds fantastic, but one of the messages that comes out of this is if you give wildlife a chance it will come back,\\" said John Calvelli, a spokesman for the Society.Trotta, Daniel. \\"Beaver Returns to New York City After 200 Years.\\" World Environment News. Dec. 26, 2007. The beaver is named Jose Serrano, after the Congressman, and was sighted below the East Tremont bridge at Drew Gardens as recently as June, 2009. Beaver had not lived in New York City since the early 19th century when trappers extirpated them completely from the state. In the summer of 2010 a second beaver joined Jose, doubling the beaver population in New York City. Beaver were once important to the city's economy and pair of beaver appear on the city's official seal and flag. Recreational amenities and wildlife Along much of its length in Westchester County and the northern Bronx the river is paralleled by the Bronx River Parkway and its associated bicycle path from Bronxville to the Kensico Dam plaza. A project, the Bronx River Greenway, proposes a unified management plan for the narrow ribbon of riverside green spaces in the stretch of river that passes through Westchester County and the Bronx, as part of the East Coast Greenway. It includes Concrete Plant Park on the right bank, below Westchester AvenueConcrete Plant Park NYC Parks Dept. and Starlight Park above there. Construction on the Bronx River Greenway started in October 2016. In the southern Bronx, the river has become a popular destination for urban canoeing in New York City. It also bisects Bronx Park and the Bronx Zoo. A monorail built in the late 20th century takes Zoo customers over the river to an exhibit of Asian animals on the left bank, with a narration presenting the river as the Irrawaddy.

The PEM format was eventually formalized by the IETF in RFC 7468. Format Many cryptography standards use ASN.1 to define their data structures, and Distinguished Encoding Rules (DER) to serialize those structures. Because DER produces binary output, it can be challenging to transmit the resulting files through systems, like electronic mail, that only support ASCII. The PEM format solves this problem by encoding the binary data using base64. PEM also defines a one-line header, consisting of \\"-----BEGIN \\", a label, and \\"-----\\", and a one-line footer, consisting of \\" -----END \\", a label, and \\"-----\\". The label determines the type of message encoded. Common labels include \\"CERTIFICATE\\", \\"CERTIFICATE REQUEST\\", \\"PRIVATE KEY\\" and \\"X509 CRL\\". PEM data is commonly stored in files with a \\".pem\\" suffix, a \\".cer\\" or \\".crt\\" suffix (for certificates), or a \\".key\\" suffix (for public or private keys). The label inside a PEM file represents the type of the data more accurately than the file suffix, since many different types of data can be saved in a \\".pem\\" file. A PEM file may contain multiple instances. For instance, an operating system might provide a file containing a list of trusted CA certificates, or a web server might be configured with a \\"chain\\" file containing an end-entity certificate plus a list of intermediate certificates. = Examples = A PEM-encoded certificate: \\\\-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE----- MIICLDCCAdKgAwIBAgIBADAKBggqhkjOPQQDAjB9MQswCQYDVQQGEwJCRTEPMA0G A1UEChMGR251VExTMSUwIwYDVQQLExxHbnVUTFMgY2VydGlmaWNhdGUgYXV0aG9y aXR5MQ8wDQYDVQQIEwZMZXV2ZW4xJTAjBgNVBAMTHEdudVRMUyBjZXJ0aWZpY2F0 ZSBhdXRob3JpdHkwHhcNMTEwNTIzMjAzODIxWhcNMTIxMjIyMDc0MTUxWjB9MQsw CQYDVQQGEwJCRTEPMA0GA1UEChMGR251VExTMSUwIwYDVQQLExxHbnVUTFMgY2Vy dGlmaWNhdGUgYXV0aG9yaXR5MQ8wDQYDVQQIEwZMZXV2ZW4xJTAjBgNVBAMTHEdu dVRMUyBjZXJ0aWZpY2F0ZSBhdXRob3JpdHkwWTATBgcqhkjOPQIBBggqhkjOPQMB BwNCAARS2I0jiuNn14Y2sSALCX3IybqiIJUvxUpj+oNfzngvj/Niyv2394BWnW4X uQ4RTEiywK87WRcWMGgJB5kX/t2no0MwQTAPBgNVHRMBAf8EBTADAQH/MA8GA1Ud DwEB/wQFAwMHBgAwHQYDVR0OBBYEFPC0gf6YEr+1KLlkQAPLzB9mTigDMAoGCCqG SM49BAMCA0gAMEUCIDGuwD1KPyG+hRf88MeyMQcqOFZD0TbVleF+UsAGQ4enAiEA l4wOuDwKQa+upc8GftXE2C//4mKANBC6It01gUaTIpo= \\\\-----END CERTIFICATE----- A PEM- encoded certificate signing request: \\\\-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE REQUEST----- MIICXTCCAUUCAQAwGDEWMBQGA1UEAwwNaGkgd2lraXBlZGlhITCCASIwDQYJKoZI hvcNAQEBBQADggEPADCCAQoCggEBAMTwzCYD+iLlDwTu5Y43aQH9q1LF3kgot8I4 9ZgbFhDmCE4YlLhZKO4hieK6z8z+IfZjfapn01rzuzvTHESj5bSSU6AcEsKSOgTQ uB+KKn4mgngyBrJwWjr4IZ9XkGsCLAP2/wkyJC2ire6FuTSQ00YGhKf1B3WbIBbn 5i1rvZXnYxlheWlNSmxx54q4gTwcd/V4nS4BThYA/ypATjHS/gfQ650cOQzRK/Jh WfAbfnETYUpD6MCgZAIbaBuYvYpQEGqQ4niTvtSd07RHKnewcPFqJhMV86qN4HQY 4ZBNzQcF/2aCGHYyRniKznSDNijT2kaAz/L7ORqh+90qH/BLnKsCAwEAAaAAMA0G CSqGSIb3DQEBCwUAA4IBAQAqV5g9AZGXEbM97ouTGDJqFNP2QjO9ZK9J3BOUTrFO tMUrVWj+ixhC6vXD3o5uVL/fg6OlmK+13gsBpzg2mq72TBrZsNOK4+O0XvltIvSx 0H5tf1NYwuHxFgHDqgs/fQBOKFTadebJZHbPBtMrqlnenKYJiVb5YSWBZ7JKRCK7 VSgwNxxAMnSCNI0xF3EjZ1bjQkM8xGhnwe+n/RAd5Q2pMLIrquMoGMTUYLOq1xSB sGTp8iLWbbWPl6gC1hcSMpFsbdyjMCWs+a2R2F8QnahrRfvpgFEndvzA2EvqHIoR BHE1ChD7l691PxZP1eKA1I4AzZno5sb6SWyd8+pqY0oG \\\\-----END CERTIFICATE REQUEST-----  Privacy-enhanced mail  The PEM format was first developed in the privacy-enhanced mail series of RFCs: RFC 1421, RFC 1422, RFC 1423, and RFC 1424.

The Precambrian to Cenozoic A√Ør Mountains consist of peralkaline granite intrusions which appear dark in colour (unusual since most granitic masses are light-toned in the field). In the Sahara Desert such mountains often stand out in stark relief as topographic heights amidst lowlands covered by sand.[rst.gsfc.nasa.gov/Sect17/Sect17_3.html Use of Remote Sensing in Basic Science Studies], Section 17, NASA/Primary Author: Nicholas M. Short, Sr. (Site last updated: June 18, 2007). The terrain consists of high plateau, mountain ranges, and broad, sandy valleys and seasonal wadis which once contained rivers. Areas of these deep, often intersecting, valleys also contain waterborne clay and silt deposits. Underground watercourses in some of these valleys continue to provide year-round oasis and seasonal vegetation. Circular granite massifs (dark areas). A volcanic crater can be seen at the lower left. NASA image approximately across. The A√Ør mountains themselves consist of nine almost circular massifs rising from a rocky plateau, bordered by the sand dunes and plain of the T√©n√©r√© Desert to the east. The massif is a plateau consisting of a sub-Cambrian age erosion surface on Precambrian metamorphic rocks, punctuated by a series of flat-topped, granite intrusion peaks, which include Mont Idoukal-n-Tagh√®s (Niger's highest point at 2022 m),: incorrectly calls peak Mont Bagzane.

Climate The Guelta near the town of Timia in central A√Ør provides year- round water in an otherwise dry region. Because of its altitude (on average between 500 and 900 m) and despite its low rainfall (50 to 160 mm/year on the lower plateau), the A√Ør forms a green region in comparison with the surrounding deserts, especially after the August‚ÄìSeptember seasonal rains. The climate is classified as Sahel, like that of the regions well to its south. While the mountains are largely bare of vegetation, the dry wadi river valleys (known by the Hausa term \\"Kori\\") channel and hold rainwater in gueltas (stone pools, such as that near the town of Timia), creating oases which provide forage for animals, and in some areas, farming. The high Bagzane plateau of the central A√Ør in particular provides adequate rainfall for intensive agriculture. Other, vast, areas of the region are entirely devoid of plant life and with their volcanic protrusions and rock fields present an otherworldly appearance. Vegetation More than 430 vascular species have been recorded so far in the A√Ør mountains.Bruneau de Mir√©, P. & Gillet, H. 1956.

In the vicinity of temporary rivers named koris, species like Acacia nilotica, Faidherbia albida and the palm Hyphaene thebaica coexist with planted date palms Phoenix dactylifera. Severe droughts and high aridity have made the intermountain zone of the A√Ør a particularly harsh place for plants to develop.Poilecot in Giazzi, F., 1996. √âtude initiale ‚Äì la R√©serve Naturelle Nationale de l'A√Ør et du T√©n√©r√© (Niger) ‚Äì connaissance des √©l√©ments du milieu naturel et humain dans le cadre d'orientations pour un am√©nagement et une conservation durables ‚Äì analyse descriptive.

This positive interaction between plants represents a promising restoration tool to be used by local inhabitants. In comparison, mountainous areas are even less documented. Tropical tree species less resistant to drought have been described in the highlands, among which the Fabaceae Acacia laeta and Acacia seyal. Quezel Qu√©zel, P., 1965. La v√©g√©tation du Sahara, du Tchad √† la Mauritanie. Fischer Verlag, Stuttgart, Germany has observed the remnant presence of a rare endemic taxon related to the olive tree in the northern sector of the A√Ør range. Recently, this taxon, Olea europaea subsp. laperrinei, has been found in other mountains of the A√Ør: these very isolated, small populations represent the southern limit of the species distribution.Anthelme, F., Abdoulkader, A. & Besnard, G. 2008. https://doi.org/10.1007%2Fs11258-007-9386-6 A study led on the slopes of the highest summit in the A√Ør, Idoukal‚ÄôN‚ÄôTaghes (2022 m a.s.l.), identified plant species that had never been inventoried in Niger before. Among them, Pachycymbium decaisneanum, Cleome aculeata, Echinops mildbraedii and Indigofera nummularia are tropical species with relatively low resistance to water stress, whereas Silene lynesii, Tephrosia elegans, and Echinops mildbraedii have a Saharan-Mediterranean distribution. Three ferns were found for the first time in the A√Ør recently, Cheilanthes coriacea, Actiniopteris radiata, and Ophioglossum polyphyllum, suggesting that ferns may be more prone to develop in arid environments than commonly proposed. All these data evidence a marked mountain climatic specificity in the A√Ør, with a positive impact on species richness and species diversity. Because of their strong geographic isolation within a Saharan matrix, these species have a high conservation value. Population The town of Agadez in the heart of the Tuareg country is the capital of A√Ør. Much of the Tuareg population of A√Ør until recently led a nomadic life, relying essentially on camel and goats from which they take milk, meat and skins used in the production of local handicrafts. Most sedentary populations were either dependents of higher caste Tuareg pastoralists or the Ikelan ( Bouzou in Hausa / Bella in Songhai), former slaves and captives of the Tuareg from Hausa and other southern peoples. These peoples were settled in northern oases, to tend the date palm plantations held by the noble clans. Agriculture products from oases such as Timia, Aouderas and Tabelot are traditionally exchanged against clothes, or salt, brought by camel caravans (Azalai) from the remote Tenere oases of Bilma and Fachi to the east. History Map of the southern A√Ør Mountains. The A√Ør is known for its rock art, dating from 6000 BC to around AD 1000. During the Neolithic Subpluvial the region was a pastoral area, as is illustrated by images of cattle and large mammals. During the 3rd millennium BC, however, a process of desertification began and the Tuareg from further north migrated into the region. Later art indicated war, depicting horses and chariots. In particular, a five-meter-high carving of a giraffe at Dabous discovered in 1999 is internationally famous. Cave art in the region is predominantly stone carving, initially with sharp rock, and from around 1200 BC perhaps with metal.Trust for African Rock Art. ROCK ART OF SAHARA AND NORTH AFRICA:THEMATIC STUDY. David COULSON. Sub-Zone 3: Niger (June 2007). When the Tuareg tribes were pushed south by Arab invaders in the eighth and ninth centuries, there were Gobirwa Hausa in the southern A√Ør. Successive Tuareg Tels have controlled the area since at least the twelfth century. Agadez, as well as In-Gall to the east, were the farthest outposts of the Songhai Empire in the early 15th century. In the sixteenth century the area fell under the newly created Tuareg Sultanate of A√Ør, and remained so until the arrival of the French at the end of the 19th. The emergence of the French weakened the Tuareg Kels and provoked both infighting and resistance to colonialism. From the 1880s, Toubu raids increased, and when the Tuareg Ag Mohammed Wau Teguidda Kaocen rose against the French in 1917, many towns were destroyed on his way to the siege of Agadez. When the French retook Agadez, a brutal punitive expedition through the A√Ør left many formerly populous places abandoned, razed by Kaosen and the French successively.Jolijn Geels. Niger. Bradt London and Globe Pequot New York (2006). While the Kel Owey continued to dominate the settled oasis towns and pastoral herding, the sedentary farmers (Tuareg, Hausa, or Songhai) expanded farming and sedentary livestock cultivation in the mid-20th century. The famines of the 1970s and 1980s brought an end to this expansion, and as Agadez and Arlit grew, the towns of the A√Ør have shrunk. The Tuareg Rebellion of the 1990s saw brutal government reprisals which depopulated many villages in the A√Ør. Peace from the mid-1990s, as well as the uranium mines of Arlit brought unprecedented growth to the region, with many small towns gaining valuable tourism revenue. In 2004, a locust invasion ravaged many gardens, bringing scarcity and contributing to the Second Tuareg Rebellion (beginning in 2007) which continues to plague the region, effectively ending the nascent tourist industry.Geels (2006) View Annotated view Inset of the image See also *A√Ør and T√©n√©r√© National Nature Reserve *T√©n√©r√© *World Heritage Sites in Danger References Further reading  External links * Uranium Geology: NIGER, WEST AFRICA, NWT Uranium Corp.

Early life Rayner was born to Jewish parents in Stepney,Jane Reed, \\"Rayner [n√©e Berkovitch], Claire Berenice (1931‚Äì2010)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, Jan 2014 available online. Retrieved 26 August 2020. London, the eldest of four children. Her father was a tailor and her mother a housewife. Her father had adopted the surname Chetwynd, under which name she was educated at the City of London School for Girls. Her autobiography How Did I Get Here from There? was published in 2003, and revealed details of a childhood marred by physical and mental cruelty at the hands of her parents. After the family emigrated to Canada, in 1945 she was placed in a psychiatric hospital by her parents, and treated for 15 months for a thyroid defect. Career =Nursing= Returning to the UK in 1951, Rayner trained as a nurse at the Royal Northern Hospital and Guy's Hospital in London. She intended to become a physician; while training as a nurse, however, she met actor Desmond Rayner, whom she married in 1957. The couple lived in London and Claire worked as a midwife and later nursing sister. =Journalist and writer= Rayner wrote her first letter to Nursing Times in 1958, on nurses' pay and conditions. She then began regularly writing to The Daily Telegraph on themes of patient care or nurses' pay. She began writing novels soon after her marriage, and by 1968 had published more than 25 books. The birth of her first child in 1960Suzie Hayman, \\"Obituary: Claire Rayner\\", The Guardian, 12 October 2010. meant that she found full-time nursing difficult, and so she focused on a full-time writing career. Initially writing articles for various magazines and publications, in 1968 she published one of the earliest sex manuals, People in Love, which brought her to national attention. Despite the \\"explicit\\" content, the work was commended for its \\"down-to-earth\\" and \\"sensible\\" approach. By the 1970s, writing for Woman's Own Rayner had established herself as one of four new and direct \\"agony aunts\\", alongside Marjorie Proops, Peggy Makins (aka Evelyn Home) at Woman and J. Firbank of Forum. Her advice in the teenaged girls' magazine Petticoat caused controversy. In 1972 she was accused of \\"encouraging masturbation and promiscuity in prepubescent girls\\". Her direct and frank approach led the BBC to ask her to be the first person on British pre-watershed television to demonstrate how to put on a condom, and she was one of the first people used by advertisers to promote sanitary towels. The year after beginning to appear on Pebble Mill at One, Rayner started an agony column in The Sun in 1973, but left to join the Sunday Mirror in 1980, when she also made her second television series of Claire Rayner's Casebook. She left the Sunday Mirror shortly after the appointment of Eve Pollard as editor, and joined the Today newspaper for three years. Rayner was named medical journalist of the year in 1987. Rayner was probably best known as an agony aunt on TV-am in the late 1980s and early 1990s. She made it her personal aim to reply to every letter she received. This was an unfunded project by the station. She was the subject of This Is Your Life in 1989 when she was surprised by Michael Aspel. =Campaigner= Rayner became president of the Patients Association, and through her extensive charity work and writings was awarded an OBE in 1996 for services to women's health and wellbeing and to health matters. Rayner had a very personal reason for supporting Sense's Older Person campaign, wearing hearing aids in both ears, and also had age-related dry macular degeneration (AMD), a sight loss common in older people. Between 1993 and 2002, Rayner was one of the patrons of the Herpes Viruses Association and chaired a Press Briefing in June 1993 aimed at destigmatising genital herpes. When tendering her resignation, she cited the fact that she was patron of 60 organisations as the reason for trimming the list.SPHERE magazine. 1993;8(3):3‚Äì28. Rayner was appointed to various UK government committees on health, and resultantly was the author of a chapter in The Future of the NHS. Despite being president of the Patients Association, Rayner used private health care.Laura Donnelly, \\"NHS at 60: In the end I had to go private\\", Daily Telegraph, 21 June 2008. was a member of the Prime Minister's Commission on Nursing; the Labour government's Royal Commission on the Care of the Elderly. In 1999 Rayner was appointed to a committee responsible for reviewing the medical conditions at Holloway Prison, London, at the direction of Paul Boateng who was then the Minister for Prisons. The recommendations of this committee led to far reaching changes in the provision of medical care within Holloway. A lifelong Labour Party supporter, she resigned in 2001 and joined the Liberal Democrats in fear of the proposed changes to the NHS from the administration of Prime Minister Tony Blair. She was also a prominent supporter of the British republican movement, although admitted her dual standards on accepting her OBE in 1996.Cahal Milmo, \\"Obituary: \\"Claire Rayner's last words: 'Don't screw up my NHS'\\", The Independent, 13 October 2010.

About 14 genera and about 116 species of clariids are described. All the clariids are freshwater species. Note that other groups of catfish also breathe air, such as the Callichthyidae and Loricariidae. Distribution Although clariids occur in India, Syria, southern Turkey, and large parts of Southeast Asia, their diversity is the largest in Africa. Description Clariid catfish are characterized by an elongated body, the presence of four barbels, long dorsal and anal fins, and especially by the autapomorphic presence of a suprabranchial organ, formed by tree-like structures from the second and fourth gill arches. This suprabranchial organ, or labyrinth organ, allows some species the capability of traveling short distances on land (walking catfish). The dorsal fin base is very long and is not preceded by a fin spine. The dorsal fin may or may not be continuous with the caudal fin, which is rounded. Pectoral and pelvic fins are variously absent in some species. Some fish have small eyes and reduced or absent pectoral and pelvic fins for a burrowing lifestyle. A few species are blind. Within the family Clariidae, body forms range from fusiform (torpedo-like) to anguilliform (eel-like). As species become more eel-shaped, a whole set of morphological changes has been observed, such as decrease and loss of the adipose fin, continuous unpaired fins, reduction of paired fins, reduction of the eyes, reduction of the skull bones, and hypertrophied jaw muscles. Taxonomy The Heteropneustidae containing the genus Heteropneustes are considered by some to be a separate family and by others to be a subfamily. With the Heteropneustidae and Clariidae as separate families, a recent paper groups them into a superfamily called Clarioidea. Relationships of clarioids to other families remains uncertain. Relationship to humans Many clariids form a large part of artisanal fisheries. Clarias gariepinus is recognized as one of the most promising aquaculture species in Africa. The airbreathing capacity of these fish has allowed such fish as Clarias batrachus to be an invasive species in Florida.

Agad√®s,\\" is the 5th largest city in Niger, with a population of 110,497 (2012 census). The capital of Agadez Region, it lies in the Sahara desert, and is also the capital of A√Ør, one of the traditional Tuareg‚ÄìBerber federations. The historic centre of the town has been designated a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. History Agadez was founded before the 14th century, and, by growing around trans-Saharan trade, gradually became the most important city of the Tuareg people, supplanting Assod√©. The city still sees the arrival of caravans, bringing salt from Bilma. In 1449 Agadez became a sultanate, but was later conquered by the Songhai Empire in 1515, remaining a part of that empire until 1591.Geels, Jolijn, (2006) Bradt Travel Guide - Niger, pgs. 157-200 At this point, the city had a population of around 30,000 people and was a key passage for the medieval caravans trading between the West African cities of Kano (the source of the Hausa language which is the traditional lingua franca between different ethnic groups in the city, especially in the area of trade, religion and administration) and Timbuktu, and the North African oases of Ghat, Ghadames, and Tripoli, on the Mediterranean shore. Internal fighting led to the gradual decline of the sultanate, and by the mid 19th century the town was a shadow of its former self. Some contend that Agadez was the furthermost extent of the Ottoman Empire on the African continent until the 19th century, before being occupied by the French colonial empire, though this claim has not been verified by historians. The city was ruled by the French from 1906. A rebellion by Kaocen Ag Mohammed occurred in 1916, but was defeated by French forces. The French, unable to effectively administer this remote region, ruled semi-indirectly via a restored sultan. Later, Agadez became an important location in the Tuareg Rebellion of the 1990s in central and northern Niger. =2007 violence= As a result of the Second Tuareg Rebellion, sporadic violence and the displacement of thousands of people affected the Agadez area from late 2007 into 2009. All of northern Niger was placed on the United States State Department list of areas which are unsafe for travel by United States citizens, covering late 2007 to the end of 2008. Tourist flights to Agadez were suspended by European airlines for the 2007‚Äì2008 tourist season (September ‚Äì March). The burgeoning tourist industry, which prior to 2007 had surpassed that of Niamey and the rest of the nation, essentially came to an end. The entire region was placed under a Nigerien government State of Exception (limiting travel, gatherings, political activities, etc.) in October 2007, renewed through early 2009. Roads to and from Agadez were reported to have been mined, and the government closed the area to international journalists and aid organizations. An unknown number (reported as several thousands) of internally displaced people converged on the city as a result of the unrest. =Immigration towards Europe= In the 2010s Agadez became a major transit town for West African migrants heading to Libya and then on to Europe. https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2018/02/niger-europe- migrants-jihad-africa/553019/ Crackdowns in 2016 slowed the flow of migrants, but recent Displacement Tracking Matrix data showed a daily average of 1,212 individuals crossing at six monitored points in Niger, http://www.globaldtm.info/niger/ many of whom would have been coming through Agadez.  Demographics  Culture and tourism The Grand Mosque Today, Agadez flourishes as a market town and as a centre for the transportation of the uranium mined in the surrounding area. Notable buildings in the city include the Agadez Grand Mosque (originally dating from 1515 but rebuilt in the same style in 1844), the Kaocen Palace (now a hotel), and the Agadez Sultan's Palace. The city is also known for its camel market and its silver and leatherwork. Some well-known musicians from the town include Tuareg guitar player Bombino and his band Group Bombino, and Group Inerane. Mdou Moctar's film, Akounak Teggdalit Taha Tazoughai, is set and filmed on location in Agadez. Airport and military usage Mano Dayak International Airport Agadez's air transport hub, Mano Dayak International Airport, was named after Mano Dayak, the Tuareg leader who is native to the region. The United States is building Nigerien Air Base 201, a dedicated drone airbase in Agadez from which it can more easily monitor what it calls terrorist activities in West and North Africa, and the Sahel. It was revealed in 2016 that the military base in Niger cost the U.S. $100 million. Climate Agadez has a hot desert climate (K√∂ppen climate classification BWh).

Born in Lethbridge, Alberta,Pierre G. Normandin and A. L√©opold Normandin, Canadian Parliamentary Guide 1984. P.G. Normandin, 1984. Pearson moved to the Yukon in 1957 and worked for the government from 1960 until 1973 when he entered private business. Prior to 1978, the territory has a non-partisan legislature with no individual acting as leader of the government or Premier. Career Pearson was first elected to the Yukon Legislative Assembly in the 1978 election. He was not the party's leader going into the election campaign, but was chosen as government leader because of the defeat of leader Hilda Watson in her own riding. He became the leader of the Yukon Territory Progressive Conservative Party on December 8, 1978, when Watson resigned as leader. Pearson led the Yukon's first party government until his resignation in 1985. Pearson's government opposed transboundary native land claims and argued that the territory should be a party to the Yukon land claims negotiations. The government also fought for greater responsible government in the territory, for granting the territory more say over its natural resources, and for the territory to be a full participant in federal-provincial conferences rather than just an observer. The government successfully obtained the transfer of a number of powers from the federally appointed commissioner of the territory to the government. In 1982 the Pearson government was re-elected with a majority and attempted to deal with the effects of the economic recession on the territory which was exacerbated by the collapse of the hard mining industry and the closure of the Faro Mine. Pearson left politics in 1985 but his successor, Willard Phelps, was not able to turn the government's fortunes around. The Yukon New Democratic Party won that year's election and formed government. After politics Pearson served as deputy consul general at the Canadian Consulate in Dallas, Texas before moving to the New River Valley of Virginia in 1990. He died on February 14, 2014 in Claytor Lake.

The name of the galleon changed to reflect the city that the ship sailed from. The term Manila Galleons is also used to refer to the trade route itself between Acapulco and Manila, which lasted from 1565 to 1815. The Manila Galleons were also (inaccurately) known in New Spain as La Nao de la China (\\"The China Ships\\") on their return voyage from the Philippines because they carried mostly Chinese goods, shipped from Manila. The Manila Galleon trade route was inaugurated in 1565 after Augustinian friar and navigator Andr√©s de Urdaneta discovered the tornaviaje or return route from the Philippines to Mexico. The first successful round trips were made by Urdaneta and by Alonso de Arellano that year. The route lasted until 1815 when the Mexican War of Independence broke out. The Manila galleons sailed the Pacific for 250 years, bringing to the Americas cargoes of luxury goods such as spices and porcelain, in exchange for silver. The route also created a cultural exchange that shaped the identities and culture of the countries involved. In 2015, the Philippines and Mexico began preparations for the nomination of the Manila-Acapulco Galleon Trade Route in the UNESCO World Heritage List, with backing from Spain. Spain has also suggested the tri-national nomination of the Archives on the Manila-Acapulco Galleons in the UNESCO Memory of the World Register. Discovery of the route Explorer Andr√©s de Urdaneta Iberian mare clausum claims during the Age of Discovery. In 1521, a Spanish expedition led by Ferdinand Magellan sailed west across the Pacific using the westward trade winds. The expedition discovered the Mariana Islands and the Philippines and claimed them for Spain. Although Magellan died there, one of his ships, the Victoria, made it back to Spain by continuing westward. Acapulco in 1628, Mexican terminus of the Manila galleon Northerly trade route as used by eastbound Manila galleons In order to settle and trade with these islands from the Americas, an eastward maritime return path was necessary. The first ship to try this a few years later failed. In 1529, √Ålvaro de Saavedra Cer√≥n also tried sailing east from the Philippines, but could not find the eastward winds across the Pacific. In 1543, Bernardo de la Torre also failed. In 1542, however, Juan Rodr√≠guez Cabrillo helped pave the way by sailing north from Mexico to explore the Pacific coast, reaching as far north as the Russian River, just north of the 38th parallel. The Manila-Acapulco galleon trade finally began when Spanish navigators Alonso de Arellano and Andr√©s de Urdaneta discovered the eastward return route in 1565. Sailing as part of the expedition commanded by Miguel L√≥pez de Legazpi to conquer the Philippines in 1565, Arellano and Urdaneta were given the task of finding a return route. Reasoning that the trade winds of the Pacific might move in a gyre as the Atlantic winds did, they had to sail north to the 38th parallel north, off the east coast of Japan, before catching the eastward-blowing winds (\\"westerlies\\") that would take them back across the Pacific. Reaching the west coast of North America, Urdaneta's ship the San Pedro hit the coast near Cape Mendocino, California, then followed the coast south to San Blas and later to Acapulco, arriving on October 8, 1565. Most of his crew died on the long initial voyage, for which they had not sufficiently provisioned. Arellano, who had taken a more southerly route, had already arrived. The English privateer Francis Drake also reached the California coast, in 1579. After capturing a Spanish ship heading for Manila, Drake turned north, hoping to meet another Spanish treasure ship coming south on its return from Manila to Acapulco. He failed in that regard, but staked an English claim somewhere on the northern California coast. Although the ship's log and other records were lost, the officially accepted location is now called Drakes Bay, on Point Reyes south of Cape Mendocino. By the 18th century, it was understood that a less northerly track was sufficient when nearing the North American coast, and galleon navigators steered well clear of the rocky and often fogbound northern and central California coast. According to historian William Lytle Schurz, \\"They generally made their landfall well down the coast, somewhere between Point Conception and Cape San Lucas ... After all, these were preeminently merchant ships, and the business of exploration lay outside their field, though chance discoveries were welcomed\\".Schurz 1917, p.107-108 The first motivation for land exploration of present-day California was to scout out possible way-stations for the seaworn Manila galleons on the last leg of their journey. Early proposals came to little, but in 1769, the Portola expedition established ports at San Diego and Monterey (which became the administrative center of Alta California), providing safe harbors for returning Manila galleons. In Manila, the safety of ocean crossings was commended to the virgin Nuestra Se√±ora de la Soledad de Porta Vaga in masses held by the Archbishop of Manila. If the expedition was successful the voyagers would go to the La Ermita (church) to pay homage, and offer gold and other precious gems or jewelries from Hispanic countries, to the image of the virgin. So it came to be that the Virgin was named the \\"Queen of the Galleons\\". =The Manila Galleon and California= Monterey, California was about two months and three weeks out from Manila in the 18th century, and the galleon tended to stop there 40 days before arriving in Acapulco. Galleons stopped in Monterey prior to California's settlement by the Spanish in 1769; however visits become regular between 1777 and 1794 because the Crown ordered the galleon to stop in Monterey. Spice trade flota in the Atlantic. (Blue represents Portuguese routes.) Sample of goods brought via Manila Galleon in Acapulco Trade with Ming China via Manila served a major source of revenue for the Spanish Empire and as a fundamental source of income for Spanish colonists in the Philippine Islands. Galleons used for the trade between East and West were crafted by Filipino artisans.https://www.rappler.com/move-ph/ispeak/96830-forgotten- history-polistas-galleon-trade Until 1593, two or more ships would set sail annually from each port.Schurz, William Lytle. The Manila Galleon, 1939. P 193. The Manila trade became so lucrative that Seville merchants petitioned king Philip II of Spain to protect the monopoly of the Casa de Contrataci√≥n based in Seville. This led to the passing of a decree in 1593 that set a limit of two ships sailing each year from either port, with one kept in reserve in Acapulco and one in Manila. An \\"armada\\" or armed escort of galleons, was also approved. Due to official attempts at controlling the galleon trade, contraband and understating of ships' cargo became widespread. Between 1609 and 1616, 9 galleons and 6 galleys were constructed in Philippine shipyards. The average cost was 78,000 pesos per galleon and at least 2,000 trees. The galleons constructed included the San Juan Bautista, San Marcos, Nuestra Senora de Guadalupe, Angel de la Guardia, San Felipe, Santiago, Salbador, Espiritu Santo, and San Miguel. \\"From 1729 to 1739, the main purpose of the Cavite shipyard was the construction and outfitting of the galleons for the Manila to Acapulco trade run.\\" Spanish Galleon Due to the route's high profitability but long voyage time, it was essential to build the largest possible galleons, which were the largest class of European ships known to have been built until then.See Chinese treasure ship for Chinese vessels that might have been larger.Crown, trade, church and indigenous societies: The functioning of the Spanish shipbuilding industry in the Philippines, 1571-1816. By Ivan Valdez-Bubnov, Page 571 In the 16th century, they averaged from 1,700 to 2,000 tons, were built of Philippine hardwoods and could carry 300 - 500 passengers. The Concepci√≥n, wrecked in 1638, was long and displacing some 2,000 tons. The Sant√≠sima Trinidad was 51.5 m long. Most of the ships were built in the Philippines and only eight in Mexico. The Manila-Acapulco galleon trade ended in 1815, a few years before Mexico gained independence from Spain in 1821. After this, the Spanish Crown took direct control of the Philippines, and governed directly from Madrid. Sea transport became easier in the mid-19th century upon the invention of steam power ships and the opening of the Suez Canal, which reduced the travel time from Spain to the Philippines to 40 days. The galleon trade was supplied by merchants largely from port areas of Fujian who traveled to Manila to sell the Spaniards spices, porcelain, ivory, lacquerware, processed silk cloth and other valuable commodities. Cargoes varied from one voyage to another but often included goods from all over Asia - jade, wax, gunpowder and silk from China; amber, cotton and rugs from India; spices from Indonesia and Malaysia; and a variety of goods from Japan, including fans, chests, screens and porcelain. Galleons transported the goods to be sold in the Americas, namely in New Spain and Peru as well as in European markets. East Asia trading primarily functioned on a silver standard due to Ming China's use of silver ingots as a medium of exchange. As such, goods were mostly bought by silver mined from Mexico and Potos√≠. In addition, slaves from various origins were transported from Manila. The cargoes arrived in Acapulco and were transported by land across Mexico to the port of Veracruz on the Gulf of Mexico, where they were loaded onto the Spanish treasure fleet bound for Spain. Around 80% of the goods shipped back from Acapulco to Manila were from the Americas - silver, cochineal, seeds, sweet potato, tobacco, chickpea, chocolate and cocoa, watermelon, vine and fig trees. The remaining 20% were goods transhipped from Europe and North Africa such as wine and olive oil, and metal goods such as weapons, knobs and spurs. This Pacific route was the alternative to the trip west across the Indian Ocean, and around the Cape of Good Hope, which was reserved to Portugal according to the Treaty of Tordesillas. It also avoided stopping over at ports controlled by competing powers, such as Portugal and the Netherlands. From the early days of exploration, the Spanish knew that the American continent was much narrower across the Panamanian isthmus than across Mexico. They tried to establish a regular land crossing there, but the thick jungle and malaria made it impractical. It took at least four months to sail across the Pacific Ocean from Manila to Acapulco, and the galleons were the main link between the Philippines and the viceregal capital at Mexico City and thence to Spain itself. Many of the so-called \\"Kastilas\\" or Spaniards in the Philippines were actually of Mexican descent, and the Hispanic culture of the Philippines is somewhat close to Mexican culture.Guevarra, Rudy P. (2007). Mexipino: A History of Multiethnic Identity and the Formation of the Mexican and Filipino Communities of San Diego, 1900‚Äì1965. University of California, Santa Barbara. Soldiers and settlers recruited from Mexico and Peru were also gathered in Acapulco before they were sent to settle at the presidios of the Philippines.\\"Forced Migration in the Spanish Pacific World\\" By Eva Maria Mehl, page 235. Even after the galleon era, and at the time when Mexico finally gained its independence, the two nations still continued to trade, except for a brief lull during the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. The wrecks of the Manila galleons are legends second only to the wrecks of treasure ships in the Caribbean. In 1568, Miguel L√≥pez de Legazpi's own ship, the San Pablo (300 tons), was the first Manila galleon to be wrecked en route to Mexico. Between the years 1576 when the Espiritu Santo was lost and 1798 when the San Cristobal (2) was lost there were twenty Manila galleons wrecked within the Philippine archipelago. In 1596 the San Felipe was wrecked in Japan. The cargo was seized by the Japanese authorities and the behavior of the crew prompted persecution against the Christians. At least one galleon, probably the Santo Cristo de Burgos, is believed to have wrecked on the coast of Oregon in 1693. Known as the Beeswax wreck, the event is described in the oral histories of the Tillamook and Clatsop, which suggest that some of the crew survived. Between 1565 and 1815 Spain owned 108 galleons, of which 26 were lost at sea for various reasons. Significant galleon captures by the British occurred in 1587 when the Santa Anna was captured by Thomas Cavendish, in 1709 with the Encarnacion, in 1743 when the Nuestra Senora de la Covadonga was taken by George Anson on his voyage around the world, and in 1762 with the Nuestra Senora de la Santisima Trinidad. Until 1593, four galleons travelled at the same time, later only two. Crews Sailors averaged age 28 or 29 while the oldest were between 40 and 50. Ships pages were children who entered service mostly at age 8, many orphans or poor taken from the streets of Seville, Mexico and Manila. Apprentices were older than the pages and if successful would be certified a sailor at age 20. Because mortality rates were high with ships arriving in Manila with a majority of their crew often dead from starvation, disease and scurvy, especially in the early years, Spanish officials in Manila found it difficult to find men to crew their ships to return to Acapulco. Many indios of Filipino and Southeast Asian origin made up the majority of the crew. Other crew were made up of deportees and criminals from Spain and the colonies. Many criminals were sentenced to serve as crew on royal ships. Less than a third of the crew was Spanish and they usually held key positions on board the galleon. Possible contact with Hawaii For 250 years, hundreds of Manila galleons traveled from present-day Mexico to the Philippines, with their route taking them south of the Hawaiian Islands. And yet, no historical records of any contact between the two cultures exist. British historian Henry Kamen maintains that the Spanish did not have the ability to properly explore the Pacific Ocean, and were not capable of finding the islands which lay at a latitude 20¬∞ north of the westbound galleon route and its currents. However, Spanish activity in the Pacific was paramount until the late 18th century. Spanish expeditions discovered Guam, the Marianas, the Carolines and the Philippines in the North Pacific, as well as Tuvalu, the Marquesas, the Solomon Islands and New Guinea in the South Pacific. Spanish navigators also discovered the Pitcairn and Vanuatu archipelagos during their search for Terra Australis in the 17th century. Pacific Ocean with Mauna Kea highlighted This navigational activity poses questions as to whether Spanish explorers did arrive in the Hawaiian Islands two centuries before Captain James Cook's first visit in 1778. Ruy L√≥pez de Villalobos commanded a fleet of six ships that left Acapulco in 1542 with a Spanish sailor named Ivan Gaetan or Juan Gaetano aboard as pilot. Depending on the interpretation, Gaetano's reports seem to describe either the discovery of Hawaii or the Marshall Islands in 1555. If it was Hawaii, Gaetano would have been one of the first Europeans to find the islands. The Manila-Acapulco Galleon Memorial at Plaza Mexico in Intramuros, Manila. The westward route from Mexico passed south of Hawaii, making a short stopover in Guam before heading for Manila. The exact route was kept secret to protect the Spanish trade monopoly against competing powers, and to avoid Dutch and English pirates. Due to this policy of discretion, if the Spanish did find Hawaii during their voyages, they would not have published their findings and the discovery would have remained unknown. From Gaetano's account, the Hawaiian islands were not known to have any valuable resources, so the Spanish would not have made an effort to settle them. This happened in the case of the Marianas and the Carolines, which were not effectively settled until the second half of the 17th century. Spanish archives contain a chart that depicts islands in the latitude of Hawaii but with the longitude ten degrees east of the Islands (reliable methods of determining longitude were not developed until the mid-eighteenth century). In this manuscript, the Island of Maui is named \\"La Desgraciada\\" (the unhappy, or unfortunate), and what appears to be the Island of Hawaii is named \\"La Mesa\\" (the table). Islands resembling Kahoolawe, Lanai, and Molokai are named \\"Los Monjes\\" (the monks). The theory that the first European visitors to Hawaii were Spanish is reinforced by the findings of William Ellis, a writer and missionary who lived in early 19th century Hawaii, and recorded several folk stories about foreigners who had visited Hawaii prior to first contact with Cook. According to Hawaiian writer Herb Kawainui Kane, one of these stories: > concerned seven foreigners who landed eight generations earlier at > Kealakekua Bay in a painted boat with an awning or canopy over the stern. > They were dressed in clothing of white and yellow, and one wore a sword at > his side and a feather in his hat. On landing, they kneeled down in prayer. > The Hawaiians, most helpful to those who were most helpless, received them > kindly. The strangers ultimately married into the families of chiefs, but > their names could not be included in genealogies\\". Some scholars, particularly American, have dismissed these claims as lacking credibility.By Oliver, Douglas L. (1989). The Pacific Islands. University of Hawaii Press. p. 45. Coulter, John Wesley.

Preparations for UNESCO nominations In 2010, the Philippines foreign affairs secretary organized a diplomatic reception attended by at least 32 countries, for discussions about the historic galleon trade and the possible establishment of a galleon museum. Various Mexican and Filipino institutions and politicians also made discussions about the importance of the galleon trade in their shared history. In 2013, the Philippines released a documentary regarding the Manila Galleon trade route.https://globalnation.inquirer.net/88743/the-second-coming-of- filipinos-to-america In 2014, the idea to nominate the Manila-Acapulco Galleon Trade Route as a World Heritage Site was initiated by the Mexican and Filipino ambassadors to UNESCO. Spain has also backed the nomination and suggested that the archives related to the route under the possession of the Philippines, Mexico, and Spain be nominated as part of another UNESCO list, the Memory of the World Register. In 2015, the Unesco National Commission of the Philippines (Unacom) and the Department of Foreign Affairs organized an expert's meeting to discuss the trade route's nomination. Some of the topics presented include the Spanish colonial shipyards in Sorsogon, underwater archaeology in the Philippines, the route's influences on Filipino textile, the galleon's eastward trip from the Philippines to Mexico called tornaviaje, and the historical dimension of the galleon trade focusing on important and rare archival documentshttps://lifestyle.inquirer.net/191580/historic-manila- acapulco-galleon-trade-set-for-nomination-to-unesco-world-heritage- list/#ixzz6Rh1tdIP1 In 2017, the Philippines established the Manila-Acapulco Galleon Museum in Metro Manila, one of the necessary steps in nominating the trade route to UNESCO.

It is written from the viewpoint of the ship's chief engineer, Montgomery Scott. The manual was first printed and published by Pocket Books in 1987. The Guide opens with a brief introduction by Mr. Scott and a description of the Constitution class refit. Following this, a chapter on general information, containing such data as Starfleet uniforms of the era, fonts used in computer displays and hull markings, and various graphics used aboard the ship. It goes on to describe the Enterprise deck by deck from the top downward and concludes with a description of the Enterprise-A. Although Star Trek staffers such as Michael Okuda and Andrew Probert served as consultants for the book, it contains statements that were later contradicted. The book indicates that the Enterprise's original five-year mission ended on April 7, 2212, while later and more authoritative print (Star Trek: The Next Generation Technical Manual, The Star Trek Encyclopedia and on-screen references (such as Star Trek: Voyager episode \\"Q2\\") put the end of the mission around 2270. It also refers to the Enterprise as being an \\"Enterprise class\\" vessel after her refit, rather than the canonical Constitution class. The description of transwarp drive and other technologies are different from, if not outright incompatible with, later descriptions. Some of these contradictions stem from the book's use of some Star Trek role-playing game source materials, particularly the chronology, based on the earlier Star Trek Spaceflight Chronology. Due to interference from Roddenberry's assistant/gofer Richard Arnold, Paramount revoked FASA's license soon after the book was published and at Arnold's urging began to contradict FASA's material early in Star Trek: The Next Generation's run. However, Johnson also had access to set designs and production schematics that were used to create many places and devices that appear in the Star Trek films.

Electrons in such a vacancy tend to absorb light in the visible spectrum such that a material that is usually transparent becomes colored. This is used to identify many compounds, especially zinc oxide (yellow).  Occurrences  Color centers can occur naturally in compounds (particularly metallic oxides) because when heated to high temperature the ions become excited and are displaced from their normal crystallographic positions, leaving behind some electrons in the vacated spaces. This effect is also exhibited by ionic compounds containing metal-excess defects.  Properties  F-centers are often paramagnetic and can be studied by electron paramagnetic resonance techniques. The greater the number of F-centers, the more intense the color of the compound. One way of producing F-centers in a crystal artificially is to heat it in an atmosphere of the metal of which it is constituted, e.g., heating NaCl in a metallic Na atmosphere. Na0 ‚Üí Na+ \\\\+ e‚àí Na+ is incorporated into the NaCl crystal after giving up an electron. A Cl‚àí vacancy is generated to balance the excess Na+. The effective positive charge of the Cl‚àí vacancy traps the electron released by the Na atom. This trapping of the electrons by anion vacancies results in the formation of F-centers; that is, the electrons released in this process diffuse to the vacant sites where negatively charged ions (i.e., anions) normally reside. Ionizing radiation can also produce F-centers. An H-center (a halogen interstitial) is in a sense the opposite to an F-center, so that when the two come into contact in a crystal they combine and cancel out both defects. This process can be photoinduced, e.g., using a laser. The formation of F-centers is the reason that some crystals like lithium chloride, potassium chloride, and zinc oxide become pink, lilac and yellow, respectively, when heated.

For example, enabling acts often establish government agencies to carry out specific government policies in a modern nation. The effects of enabling acts from different times and places vary widely.  Germany  The German word for an enabling act is Erm√§chtigungsgesetz. It usually refers to the enabling act of 23 March 1933 which became a cornerstone of Adolf Hitler's seizure of power. = Acts of 1914‚Äì1927 = The first enabling act is dated from 4 August 1914 just after the outbreak of World War I. With the vote of the Social Democrats, the Reichstag (the parliament) agreed to give the government certain powers to take the necessary economic measures during the war. Such enabling acts were also common in other countries. The Reichstag had to be informed, and had the right to abolish a decree based on the enabling act. This ensured that the government used its rights with care and only in rare cases was a decree abolished. The parliament retained its right to make law.Ernst Rudolf Huber: Deutsche Verfassungsgeschichte seit 1789. Vol. V: Weltkrieg, Revolution und Reichserneuerung. Kohlhammer Verlag, Stuttgart et al. 1978, p. 37, 62‚Äì67. In the Weimar Republic (1919‚Äì1933), there were several enabling acts: three in 1919, one in 1920 and one in 1921, three in 1923, one in 1926 and one in 1927. The enabling act on 24 February 1923, originally limited until 1 June but extended until 31 October, empowered the cabinet to resist the Occupation of the Ruhr. There was an enabling act on 13 October 1923 and an enabling act on 8 December 1923 that would last until the dissolution of the Reichstag on 13 March 1924. Most of them had a temporal limit but only vague thematic limits. On the basis of these acts, a vast number of decrees were signed with enormous importance for social and economic life, the judicial system, and taxes. For example, the reform of German currency, the establishment of a single, national railway system and unemployment pay were settled via such decrees (Vollmacht-Verordnungen).Ernst Rudolf Huber: Deutsche Verfassungsgeschichte seit 1789. Vol. VI: Die Weimarer Reichsverfassung. Verlag W. Kohlhammer, Stuttgart et al. 1981, pp. 438‚Äì449. The Emminger Reform of 4 January 1924 abolished the jury as trier of fact and replaced it with a mixed system of judges and lay judges in Germany's judiciary which still exists today. These enabling acts were unconstitutional, as the Weimar constitution did not provide the possibility that one organ (parliament) would transfer its rights to another one (government). But constitutional experts accepted them because they came into existence with a two-thirds majority, the same majority as for constitutional changes. The government had success in gathering those majorities by threatening to call for presidential emergency dictatorial decrees (usually called Notverordnungen), otherwise. In March 1924, the Reichstag wanted to discuss an abolition of decrees (which was granted by the enabling act of February that year). President Friedrich Ebert dismissed parliament to avoid discussion and abolishments. In later years, governments failed to gather two-thirds majorities since the radicalization of the nationalist party (DNVP) in 1928 and the rise of the Nazi Party from 1930. Chancellor Heinrich Br√ºning (1930‚Äì1932) worked with presidential decrees which replaced most of ordinary legislature, eventually. The enabling acts had set a poor and dangerous example, but for the government they had the advantage that they appeared less unconstitutional and dictatorial compared to presidential decrees. Parliament could prefer those acts because they were valid only for a limited time and included mostly a kind of cooperation (e.g. via a special house committee). = Enabling Act of 1933 = The German word Erm√§chtigungsgesetz usually refers to the Enabling Act of 1933, officially Gesetz zur Behebung der Not von Volk und Reich (\\"Law to Remedy the Distress of the People and the State\\"). It became a cornerstone of Adolf Hitler's seizure of power. Unlike, for example, the Wilhelm Marx enabling act of December 1923, Hitler's Act: * was limited to four years, not several months; * enabled government not only to create decrees, but even laws and treaties with other countries; * these laws could deviate from the constitution; * there were no thematic limits; * neither any house committee nor the Reichsrat (the common organ of the German regional states) had the right to control, or to abolish these laws. In comparison to the situation of the 1920s, Hitler's Nazi Party and his coalition partner the German National People's Party did have a parliamentary majority since the general elections of 3 March 1933.Sylvia Eilers: Erm√§chtigungsgesetz und milit√§rischer Ausnahmezustand zur Zeit des ersten Kabinetts von Reichskanzler Wilhelm Marx 1923/1924, PhD thesis Cologne 1987, Cologne 1988, p. 163. Those elections and then the voting in the Reichstag were carried out in a climate of intimidation and violence carried out by Nazi paramilitary groups. On 23 March, the Communists were already banned and imprisoned, the Social Democrat delegates were the only ones present in the Reichstag to vote against, while the Centre and moderate-right parties voted yes in order to prevent \\"worse\\". The Enabling Act of 1933 was renewed by a purely Nazi Reichstag in 1937 and 1939. In 1941 and 1943, it was renewed by decree, though without temporal limit in 1943. Although it states that it is valid only for the duration of the current Hitler government of 1933, it remained in force even after major changes of ministers. In any case, Hitler called the cabinet together only very rarely after the first months of 1933. The last cabinet meeting happened in 1937. He preferred to govern via decrees and personal orders. = Federal Republic = With its 1949 constitution, there have been no enabling acts in the Federal Republic of Germany. The constitution states that it can be changed only by an explicit alteration of the phrasing.  United Kingdom  = Act of 1919 = The Church of England Assembly (Powers) Act 1919 gave a considerable degree of self-government to the Church of England while retaining overall parliamentary supervision. Before its passing, almost all adjustments to the legal structure of the Church of England had involved getting a specific bill through Parliament.Cross & Livingstone.The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church OUP:1971, art. Enabling Act, The It took nine sessions to approve the salary of the Archdeacon of Cornwall,Iremonger, F.A. William Temple, OUP:1948, p.223 and of the 217 bills introduced into the House of Commons between 1880 and 1913, only 33 passed into law for lack of parliamentary time, among the casualties being the bills to establish new dioceses.Garbett, Cyril. The Claims of the Church of England Hodder & Stoughton:1947, pp.192f The Act gave the newly established Church Assembly, predecessor of the General Synod, power to prepare and present to Parliament measures which could either be approved or rejected, but not modified by either House. Before being voted on, the proposals were examined by an Ecclesiastical Committee of both Houses which reported on their effects and implications. Once approved in Parliament, the measure became law on receiving the royal assent.Cross & Livingstone. The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church OUP:1971, art. Church Assembly The Act continues to apply today to the General Synod of the Church of England which, as a result of the Synodical Government Measure of 1969, replaced the Church Assembly with the aim of achieving full integration of the laity and eliminating the complications caused by the dual control of the Convocations of Canterbury and of York, and the Assembly. All the Assembly's powers passed to the new synod along with many of those of the Convocations.Cross & Livingstone. The Oxford Dictionary of the Christian Church OUP:1971, art. \\"Synodical Government\\" = Proposals = In the 1930s, both Sir Stafford Cripps and Clement Attlee advocated an enabling act to allow a future Labour government to pass socialist legislation which would not be amended by normal parliamentary procedures and the House of Lords. According to Cripps, his \\"Planning and Enabling Act\\" would not be able to be repealed, and the orders made by the government using the act would not be allowed discussion in Parliament. Cripps also suggested measures against the monarchy, but quickly dropped the idea. In 1966 Oswald Mosley advocated a government of national unity drawn from \\"the professions, from science, from the unions and the managers, from businessmen, the housewives, from the services, from the universities, and even from the best of the politicians\\". This coalition would be a \\"hard centre\\" oriented one which would also get Parliament to pass an Enabling Act in order to stop what Mosley described as \\"time-wasting obstructionism of present procedure\\". He also claimed that Parliament would always retain the power to dismiss his government by vote of censure if its policies failed or if it attempted to \\"override basic British freedoms\\". = Legislative and Regulatory Reform Act 2006 = In early 2006 the highly controversial yet little-publicised Legislative and Regulatory Reform Bill was introduced to Parliament. This Bill, if enacted as introduced, would have enabled Government ministers to amend or repeal any legislation (including the L&RR; Bill itself), subject to vague and highly subjective restraints, by decree and without recourse to Parliament. The Bill was variously described as the Abolition of Parliament BillWho wants the Abolition of Parliament Bill? The Times, 21 February 2006 and \\"of first-class constitutional significance ... [and would] markedly alter the respective and long standing roles of minister and Parliament in the legislative process\\". The Bill was, in essence, an Enabling Act in all but name. After some amendment by the government and Lords, the Legislative and Regulatory Reform Bill received Royal Assent on 8 November 2006.Legislative and Regulatory Reform Bill receives Royal Assent , Press release CAB066/06 from the Cabinet Office, 8 November 2006. Amendments included removing its ability to modify itself or the Human Rights Act 1998; most of the other modifications were much more subjectively defined. = Great Repeal Bill = The European Union (Withdrawal) Bill of 2017, also known as the Great Repeal Bill, has come under fire from critics because it envisions giving the UK Government unprecedented powers to rewrite any aspect of UK laws imported from EU law when Britain leaves the EU, without consulting Parliament. Such powers, effected by clauses called Henry VIII clauses, have been controversially used in the past, but usually only in respect of very limited areas of law.  United States  In the United States at the national level, an \\"enabling act\\" is a statute enacted by the United States Congress authorizing the people of a territory to frame a proposed state constitution as a step towards admission to the Union. Each act details the mechanism by which the territory will be admitted as a state following ratification of their constitution and election of state officers. Enabling acts can contain restrictions, such as the prohibition of polygamy in the Utah, Arizona, New Mexico, and Oklahoma acts. Nevada was required to abolish slavery and involuntary servitude, except as punishment for a crime; to guarantee freedom of religious practice to all inhabitants; and to agree that all public lands owned by the federal government at the time of statehood would be retained after admission. The applicant territory then submits its proposed constitution to Congress, which either accepts it or requires changes. For example, in 1866, Congress refused the proposed Nebraska constitution because it limited suffrage to white males. Enabling Acts approved by Congress include: * Enabling Act of 1802, for the formation of Ohio from the Northwest Territory * Enabling Act of 1864, for the formation of Nevada * Enabling Act of 1889, for the formation of North Dakota, South Dakota, Montana, and Washington * Enabling Act of 1894, for the formation of Utah * Enabling Act of 1906 for the formation of Oklahoma from Oklahoma Territory and Indian Territory * Enabling Act of 1910, for the admission of Arizona and New MexicoPiecemal Amendment of the Constitution of New Mexico 1911 to 2006 Seventeenth Revision, January 2007, New Mexico Legislative Council Service Although the use of an enabling act is a traditional historic practice, a number of territories have drafted constitutions for submission to Congress absent an enabling act and were subsequently admitted, and the act of Congress admitting Kentucky to the Union was passed before the constitution of Kentucky was drafted. = State Enabling Acts = At the state government level, state enabling acts allow local jurisdictions to make laws regarding certain issues on the state's behalf. For example, many states passed their own version of the Standard State Zoning Enabling Act, which enabled municipalities to regulate land use with local zoning laws.

The Great Miami River (also called the Miami River) (Shawnee: Msimiyamithiipi) is a tributary of the Ohio River, approximately long,U.S. Geological Survey. National Hydrography Dataset high-resolution flowline data. The National Map , accessed May 19, 2011 in southwestern Ohio and Indiana in the United States. The Great Miami flows through Dayton, Piqua, Troy, Hamilton, and Sidney. The river is named for the Miami, an Algonquian-speaking Native American people who lived in the region during the early days of European settlement. They were forced to relocate to the west to escape European-American settlement pressure. The region surrounding the Great Miami River is known as the Miami Valley. This term is used in the upper portions of the valley as a moniker for the economic-cultural region centered primarily on the Greater Dayton area. As the lower portions of the Miami Valley fall under the influence of Cincinnati and the Ohio River Valley, residents of the lower area do not identify with the Miami in the same way. Course The main course of the Great Miami River rises from the outflow of Indian Lake in Logan County, about southeast of the village of Russells Point, approximately southeast of Lima. Indian Lake is an artificial reservoir which receives the flow from the North and South forks of the Great Miami River. It flows south and southwest, past Sidney, and is joined by Loramie Creek in northern Miami County. It flows south past Piqua and Troy, and through Taylorsville Dam near Tipp City and Vandalia. It continues through Dayton, where it is joined by the Stillwater and the Mad rivers and Wolf Creek. From Dayton it flows southwest past Miamisburg, Franklin, Middletown and Hamilton in the southwest corner of Ohio. In southwestern Hamilton County, it is joined by the Whitewater River approximately upstream from its mouth on the Ohio River, just east of the Ohio-Indiana state line, approximately west of Cincinnati. The river meanders across the state line near Lawrenceburg, Indiana in the last two miles (3 km) before reaching its mouth approximately ¬º mile east of the border in Ohio. The border of Ohio and Indiana was based on where the confluence of the Ohio and Great Miami Rivers was in 1800. Natural and human history In the 1700s, the French called the river Riviere √† la Roche (\\"River of the Rocks\\"). The Miami and Erie Canal, which connected the Ohio River with Lake Erie, was built through the Great Miami watershed. The first portion of the canal, from Cincinnati to Middletown, was operational in 1828, and extended to Dayton in 1830. Water from the Great Miami fed into the canal. A later extension to the canal, the Sidney Feeder, drew water from the upper reaches of the Great Miami from near Port Jefferson and Sidney. The canal served as the principal north- south route of transportation from Toledo to Cincinnati for western Ohio until being supplanted in the 1850s by railroads. As was common in early industrial days, beginning in the 19th century the river served as a source of water and a method to dispose of wastes for a variety of major industrial firms, including Armco Steel, Champion International Paper, Black Clawson, Fernald and many others. Heightened attention to water pollution in the late 1950s and 1960s has led to significant improvements in waste disposal and water quality. Following a catastrophic flood in March 1913, the Miami Conservancy District was established in 1914 within Ohio to build dams, levees and storage areas, and to dredge and straighten channels to control flooding of the river.

This follows since one has 2d*(n) dividing the sum of the unitary divisors of an odd number (where d*(n) is the number of distinct prime divisors of n).

Therefore, an odd unitary perfect number must have only one distinct prime factor, and it is not hard to show that a power of prime cannot be a unitary perfect number, since there are not enough divisors.

Artists and writers drew on the traditions of Gaelic literature, Welsh-language literature, and so-called 'Celtic art'‚Äîwhat historians call Insular art (the Early Medieval style of Ireland and Britain). Although the revival was complex and multifaceted, occurring across many fields and in various countries in Northwest Europe, its best known incarnation is probably the Irish Literary Revival. Irish writers including William Butler Yeats, Lady Gregory, \\"AE\\" Russell, Edward Martyn, and Edward Plunkett (Lord Dunsany) stimulated a new appreciation of traditional Irish literature and Irish poetry in the late 19th and early 20th century.Foster (2003), pp. 486, 662. 'Bollelin' pewter plate designed by Archibald Knox, 1899 In aspects the revival came to represent a reaction to modernisation. This is particularly true in Ireland, where the relationship between the archaic and the modern was antagonistic, where history was fractured, and where, according to Terry Eagleton, \\"as a whole [the nation] had not leapt at a bound from tradition to modernity\\".Castle, 2‚Äì3. At times this romantic view of the past resulted in historically inaccurate portrayals, such as the promotion of noble savage stereotypes of the Irish people and Scottish Highlanders, as well as a racialized view that referred to the Irish, whether positively or negatively, as a separate race. A widespread and still visible result of the revival was the reintroduction of the High cross as the Celtic cross, which now forms a familiar part of monumental and funerary art over much of the Western world.Stephen Walker, \\"Celtic Revival Crosses\\", Celtic Arts Website, accessed 22 November 2008 History Research into the Gaelic and Brittonic cultures and histories of Britain and Ireland gathered pace from the late 17th century, by antiquaries and historians like Owen Jones in Wales and Charles O'Conor in Ireland. The key surviving manuscript sources were gradually located, edited and translated, monuments identified and published, and other essential groundwork in recording stories, music and language done. The Welsh antiquarian and author Iolo Morganwg fed the growing fascination in all things Brittonic by founding the Gorsedd, which would in turn spark the Neo-druidism movement. Interest in Scottish Gaelic culture greatly increased during the onset of the Romantic period in the late 18th century, with James Macpherson's Ossian achieving international fame, along with the novels of Sir Walter Scott and the poetry and lyrics of Thomas Moore. Throughout Europe, the Romantic movement inspired a great revival of interest in folklore, folk tales, and folk music; even BeethovenCastle, 239 was commissioned to produce a set of arrangements of Scottish folk-songs. A growing sense of Celtic identity encouraged and fed off a rise in nationalism throughout the United Kingdom, which was especially intense in Ireland. E. A. Hornel In the mid-19th century the revival continued, with Sir Samuel Ferguson, the Young Ireland movement, and others popularising folk tales and histories in countries and territories with Celtic roots. At the same time, archaeological and historical work was beginning to make progress in constructing a better understanding of regional history. Interest in ornamental 'Celtic' art developed, and 'Celtic' motifs began to be used in all sorts of contexts, including architecture, drawing on works like the Grammar of Ornament by the architect Owen Jones. Imitations of the ornate Insular penannular brooches of the 7‚Äì9th centuries were worn by figures such as Queen Victoria,Royal Collection , Brooch given in November 1849, and Christmas 1849 many produced in DublinVictorian penannular brooches from the V&A; Museum. by West & Son and other makers. In Scotland were John Francis Campbell's (1821-1885) works the bilingual Popular Tales of the West Highlands (4 vols., 1860‚Äì62) and The Celtic Dragon Myth, published posthumously in 1911. The formation of the Edinburgh Social Union in 1885, which included a number of significant figures in the Arts and Craft and Aesthetic movements, became part of an attempt to facilitate a revival in Scotland, similar to that taking place in contemporaneous Ireland, drawing on ancient myths and history to produce art in a modern idiom.Gardiner (2005), p. 170. Key figures were the philosopher, sociologist, town planner and writer Patrick Geddes (1854‚Äì1932), the architect and designer Robert Lorimer (1864‚Äì1929) and stained-glass artist Douglas Strachan (1875‚Äì1950). Geddes established an informal college of tenement flats for artists at Ramsay Garden on Castle Hill in Edinburgh in the 1890s. Among the figures involved with the movement were Anna Traquair (1852‚Äì1936), who was commissioned by the Union to paint murals in the Mortuary Chapel of the Hospital for Sick Children, Edinburgh, (1885‚Äì86 and 1896‚Äì98) and also worked in metal, illumination, illustration, embroidery, and book binding.MacDonald, (2000), pp. 155‚Äì6. The most significant exponent of the artistic revival in Scotland was Dundee-born John Duncan (1866‚Äì1945). Among his most influential works are his paintings of Celtic subjects Tristan and Iseult (1912) and St Bride (1913).MacDonald (2000), pp. 156‚Äì7. Duncan also helped to make Dundee a major centre for the Celtic Revival movement along with artists such as Stewart Carmichael and the publisher Malcolm C MacLeod. Vases with Celtic motifs, c. 1900, Caneware with raised gilding, by Wedgwood. The Irish Literary Revival encouraged the creation of works written in the spirit of Irish culture, as distinct from English culture. This style fed a growing Irish identity, which also found inspiration in Irish history, myths and folklore. There was an attempt to revitalize the native rhythm and music of Irish Gaelic. Figures such as Lady Gregory, WB Yeats, George Russell, J .M. Synge and Se√°n O'Casey wrote plays and articles about the political state of Ireland. Gaelic revival and Irish nationalism frequently overlapped in places such as An Stad, a tobacconist on Dublin‚Äôs North Frederick Street owned by the writer Cathal McGarvey and frequented by literary figures like James Joyce and Yeats, along with leaders of the Nationalist movement such as Douglas Hyde, Arthur Griffith and Michael Collins. These were connected with another great symbol of the literary revival, the Abbey Theatre, which served as the stage for many new Irish writers and playwrights of the time. In 1892, Sir Charles Gavan Duffy said, > \\"A group of young men, among the most generous and disinterested in our > annals, were busy digging up the buried relics of our history, to enlighten > the present by a knowledge of the past, setting up on their pedestals anew > the overthrown statues of Irish worthies, assailing wrongs which under long > impunity had become unquestioned and even venerable, and warming as with > strong wine the heart of the people, by songs of valour and hope; and > happily not standing isolated in their pious work, but encouraged and > sustained by just such an army of students and sympathizers as I see here > to-day\\". The Celtic Revival was an international movement. The Irish-American designer Thomas Augustus \\"Gus\\" O'Shaughnessy made a conscious choice to use Irish design roots in his artwork. Trained in stained glass and working in an Art Nouveau style, O'Shaughnessy designed a series of windows and interior stencils for Old Saint Patrick's Church in Chicago, a 10-year project begun in 1912. Louis Sullivan, the Chicago architect, incorporated dense Art Nouveau and Celtic-inspired interlace in the ornament of his buildings. Sullivan's father was a traditional Irish musician and they both were step-dancers. In England, the Watts Mortuary Chapel (1896‚Äì98) in Surrey was a thoroughgoing attempt to decorate a Romanesque Revival chapel framework with lavish Celtic reliefs designed by Mary Fraser Tytler. Celtic-style tattoo The \\"plastic style\\" of early Celtic art was one of the elements feeding into Art Nouveau decorative style, very consciously so in the work of designers like the Manxman Archibald Knox, who did much work for Liberty & Co., especially for the Tudric and Cymric ranges of metalwork, respectively in pewter and silver or gold. Many of the most extravagant examples of the plastic style come from the modern Czech Lands and influenced the Czech Art Nouveau designer and artist Alphonse Mucha (Mucha, in turn, influenced the Irish-American O'Shaughnessy, who had attended a series of Mucha's lectures in Chicago). The interlace design motif remains popular in Celtic countries, above all Ireland where it is a national style signature. In recent decades, it had a re-revival in 1960s designs (for example, in the Biba logo) and has been used worldwide in tattoos and in various contexts and media in fantasy works with a quasi- Dark Ages setting. The Secret of Kells is an animated feature film of 2009 set during the creation of the Book of Kells which makes much use of Insular design. In France, sublime descriptions of Celtic landscape were found in the works of Jacques Cambry. The Celtic Revival was strengthened by Napoleon's idea that the \\"French were a race of empire-building Celts,\\" and became institutionalized by the foundation of the Acad√©mie Celtique in 1805, by Cambry and others. John Duncan was one of the leading artists of the Celtic Revival and Symbolism. He was inspired by the early Italian Renaissance and made works in the medieval medium of tempera. He was a proflic artist working in a range of mediums including stained glass, illustrating and painting. Linguistic and cultural revivals, after 1920 Modern copper jar with a Celtic motif. =In the Celtic Nations=  Brittany  In 1925, Professor Roparz Hemon founded the Breton-language review Gwalarn. During its 19-year run, Gwalarn tried to raise the language to the level of a great international language. Its publication encouraged the creation of original literature in all genres, and proposed Breton translations of internationally recognized foreign works. In 1946, Al Liamm replaced Gwalarn. Other Breton- language periodicals have been published, which established a fairly large body of literature for a minority language. In 1977, Diwan schools were founded to teach Breton by immersion. They taught a few thousand young people from elementary school to high school. See the education section for more information. The Asterix comic series has been translated into Breton. According to the comic, the Gaulish village where Asterix lives is in the Armorica peninsula, which is now Brittany. Some other popular comics have also been translated into Breton, including The Adventures of Tintin, Spirou, Titeuf, H√§gar the Horrible, Peanuts and Yakari. Some original media are created in Breton. The sitcom, Ken Tuch, is in Breton. Radio Kerne, broadcasting from Finist√®re, has exclusively Breton programming. Some movies (Lancelot du Lac, Shakespeare in Love, Marion du Faouet, Sezneg) and TV series (Columbo, Perry Mason) have also been translated and broadcast in Breton. Poets, singers, linguists, and writers who have written in Breton, including Yann-Ber Kalloc'h, Roparz Hemon, Anjela Duval, Xavier de Langlais, P√™r-Jakez Helias, Youenn Gwernig, Glenmor and Alan Stivell are now known internationally. Today, Breton is the only living Celtic language that is not recognized by national government as an official or regional language. The first Breton dictionary, the Catholicon, was also the first French dictionary. Edited by Jehan Lagadec in 1464, it was a trilingual work containing Breton, French and Latin. Today bilingual dictionaries have been published for Breton and languages including English, Dutch, German, Spanish and Welsh. A new generation[clarification needed] is determined to gain international recognition for Breton. The monolingual dictionary, Geriadur Brezhoneg an Here (1995), defines Breton words in Breton. The first edition contained about 10,000 words, and the second edition of 2001 contains 20,000 words. In the early 21st century, the Ofis ar Brezhoneg (\\"Office of the Breton language\\") began a campaign to encourage daily use of Breton in the region by both businesses and local communes. Efforts include installing bilingual signs and posters for regional events, as well as encouraging the use of the Spilhennig to let speakers identify each other. The office also started an Internationalization and localization policy asking Google, Firefox and SPIP to develop their interfaces in Breton. In 2004, the Breton wikipedia started, which now counts more than 50,000 articles. In March 2007, the Ofis ar Brezhoneg signed a tripartite agreement with Regional Council of Brittany and Microsoft for the consideration of the Breton language in Microsoft products. In October 2014, Facebook added Breton as one of its 121 languages, after three years of talks between the Ofis and Facebook. Cornwall The Cornish cultural Celtic revival of the early twentieth century was characterised by an increased interest in the Cornish language started by Henry Jenner and Robert Morton Nance in 1904. The Federation of Old Cornwall Societies was formed in 1924 to \\"maintain the Celtic spirit of Cornwall\\", followed by the Gorseth Kernow in 1928 and the formation of the Cornish political party Mebyon Kernow in 1951. Ireland Due to the revival of Irish in educational settings and bilingual upbringing, there has been an increase in young Irish people speaking the language in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. It is said it is more common to hear it spoken in Irish cities. Additionally, there is a \\"modest\\" revived interest in North America in learning Irish. Isle of Man Scotland Wales The Welsh language has been spoken continuously in Wales throughout recorded history, and in recent centuries has been easily the most widely spoken Celtic language. But by 1911 it had become a minority language, spoken by 43.5% of the population. While this decline continued over the following decades, the language did not die out. By the start of the 21st century, numbers began to increase once more. The 2004 Welsh Language Use Survey showed that 21.7% of the population of Wales spoke Welsh, compared with 20.8% in the 2001 census, and 18.5% in 1991. The 2011 census, however, showed a slight decline to 562,000, or 19% of the population. The census also showed a \\"big drop\\" in the number of speakers in the Welsh-speaking heartlands, with the number dropping to under 50% in Ceredigion and Carmarthenshire for the first time. According to the Welsh Language Use Survey 2013-15, 24% of people aged three and over were able to speak Welsh. Historically, large numbers of Welsh people spoke only Welsh.Janet Davies, University of Wales Press, Bath (1993). The Welsh Language, page 34 Over the course of the 20th century this monolingual population \\"all but disappeared\\", but a small percentage remained at the time of the 1981 census. In Wales, 16% of state school pupils now receive a Welsh medium education, and Welsh is a compulsory subject in English medium schools, up to the age of 15-16. = Americas =  Welsh in Argentina  Welsh is spoken by over 5,000 people in Chubut province of Argentina.Ethnologue Some districts have recently incorporated it as an educational language.  Nova Scotia  Nova Scotia holds the largest population of Scots Gaelic speakers outside of Scotland. =France= The Gaulish language used to be widely spoken in France and beyond around the period of the Roman Empire. There have been attempts at revivals and reconstructions, despite very limited evidence for the exact original form of the language. Eluveitie is a folk metal band that writes songs in revived form of Gaulish.https://glosbe.com/en/mis_gal academic paper  Auvergne  In the Auvergne (province), chants are sung around bonfires remembering a Celtic god. There are also modern attempts to revive the polytheistic religion of the Gauls. Auvergne is also a hotpot for the Gaulish revival movement, being the location of numerous important Gaulish sites and the home of the legendary Gaulish warrior, Vercingetorix. = Elsewhere in Europe = The Celtic cultural revivals in Cornwall have spread towards Northern England, with the attempted reconstructions of numerous types of bagpipe (such as the Lancashire Great-pipe) and an increased interest in the Northumbrian smallpipes. There are also attempts to reconstruct the Cumbric language, the ancient Brythonic language of Northern (particularly Northwestern) England, a remnant of the Brittonic kingdoms of Hen Ogledd. There are small areas of Celtic revival in Portugal.

town in the south-eastern part of Bavaria, Germany, and is the administrative center of a much larger district of the same name. The town serves as a local government, retail, health services, transport and educational center for the wider district. The historic market square, Bavarian hospitality, local breweries, outdoor sports facilities, Easter Monday horse parade, and connections with Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI, contribute to the town's profile as a tourist destination. Geography The town is situated at the heart of a region called Chiemgau, approximately 11 km east of Lake Chiemsee between Munich and Salzburg, 15 km north of the Alps, and 30 km west of Salzburg. History =Early history= Although as early as 790 the church records list possessions \\"ad Trun\\" and some medieval defence constructions are known to have existed in the surroundings since the 10th century, Trauwenstein itself was first mentioned in a manuscript of the Baumburg monastery in the year 1245. The name means \\"castle on the Traun\\", and the domicile of the Lord of \\"de Truna\\", surrounded by a little settlement, was probably located there. The Wittelsbachs (a German/Bavarian dynastic and European royal family) were the first to expand and fortify the settlement. In that way they controlled the passage of the important commercial salt route over the Traun, from Bad Reichenhall to Munich at the border of the \\"Erzstift Salzburg\\" (the archbishopric of Salzburg). In the year 1120 the lords of \\"Truna\\" settled in the current urban area because of its favourable strategic position. They built the castle at the border of the city plateau, which is surrounded by the River Traun as well as its close proximity to the main route of commerce. Traunstein has been part of the state of Bavaria since 1275. It was previously a territory of Salzburg. At the beginning of the 14th century, Traunstein was granted the status of a town. By 1493 the town roads were already cobbled. The Church of St. Oswald was rebuilt in 1501. In 1526 the Lindlbrunnen (Lindl Fountain) was constructed as a completion of the town's water supply. In the 17th century, salt production, facilitated by the construction of a wooden brine pipeline from Bad Reichenhall brought new industry and significant wealth to the town. The pipeline was constructed between 1616 and 1619 by the master builder of the court, Hans Reiffenstuel. Traunstein was spared much of the damage experienced by nearby towns during the Thirty Years' War (1618‚Äì1648). [reason/s and citation/s needed] On the 25th and 26 July 1704, Austrian troops occupied the town in the course of the Spanish war of succession. A disastrous fire altered the medieval townscape. Despite the occupation by Austrian troops, it was possible for Traunstein to be reconstructed. The saltworks, finished in 1786/87, assured the survival of salt production in Traunstein. =Town fires= In its history, Traunstein was struck at least twice by significant town fires: In 1704, when Hungarian \\"Panduren\\" set the town on fire in the course of the Spanish War of Succession, and in 1851. However, the \\"first town fire\\", which is still familiar to all \\"real\\" citizens of Traunstein and is still taught in school today, has not been confirmed. Only archaeological excavations can show whether Traunstein had really suffered a fire disaster before 1400. Written documents provide no information about it. They merely report about a fire, which broke out later, in 1851. At any rate, only 10 houses fell victim to the early fire and in no case the whole town. Thereupon, in 1587, a fire arrangement was enacted for the first time in the town history. During the night of April 25 to April 26, 1851, a disastrous fire again destroyed almost the whole town. The reason for it has never been discovered. The great fires spread to almost 100 houses including the Town Hall, the County Court, the Main Salt Office, the Pension Office, the Church, and several gates and towers except the Upper Tower. Just as in 1704, Traunstein was again rebuilt within a few years. It was presumed the fire was an act of revenge by the angry Haslachers. There were feelings of rage because the parochial seat was taken away from Haslach and was given to Traunstein. Later rumours came up that the carelessness of a resident had caused the fire. However, there was no evidence to support that idea and therefore the person could not be sentenced. After the town fire 700 citizens were homeless but help immediately reached Traunstein. King Maximilian II visited Traunstein on the 27th of April, contributed consolations and gave several thousands of guilders from his cabinet cash. In return for the quick payment of the fire insurance the inhabitants could soon begin to rebuild their town from the ground up. The medieval plan of the town square was preserved to a great extent; merely the fa√ßades received a new face in the style of the current time. =1900 to present= Salt production in Traunstein was finally shut down in 1912. In 1914, the former independent community \\"Au\\" became part of Traunstein. During the First World War what had previously been the site of the salt production facilities became a camp for over 1000 civilian prisoners and prisoners of war. After the war, the 1923 hyperinflation crisis as in other towns lead to the use of token money denominated in billions. Traunstein in 1930. View of the town from the North. The Hochfelln and Hochgern mountains in the background. With the seizure of power of the National Socialists in 1933 began an active period of persecution for political dissidents and Jewish fellow citizens in Germany. By November 1938 all Jewish residents of the town had been forcibly removed. Open political resistance during the war years was limited; the town priest, Josef Stelze, was placed briefly in custody, Rupert Berger, Bavarian People's Party representative and the first post-war elected Mayor of Traunstein, was for a period incarcerated in the Dachau concentration camp. In 1939 Traunstein had an estimated population of 11,500. By the end of the war 523 of that number were registered as killed as a direct result of the conflict, a further 73 registered as missing. During the later stages of the Second World War Traunstein was four times the target of U.S. Army Air Force aerial bombardment: on November 11, 1944, on January 21, 1945, on April 18, 1945, and finally on April 25, 1945. In April 1945 the heavy air raids destroyed much of the Traunstein station area, an event in which over 100 people died. A short time later, a death march with a few SS guards accompanied by 61 prisoners from the already-liberated Buchenwald concentration camp arrived; and on May 5th a massacre was carried out, resulting in 60 deaths, and only one survivor. Currently in Surberg lies a memorial commemorating their deaths. On May 3, 1945, the town surrended without struggle. During World War II, a subcamp of Dachau concentration camp was located here. Whereas Traunstein was a district-free city from 1948‚Äì1972, it became capital of the district of the same name in 1972. Areas of Traunstein close to the River Traun have been subject to flooding on numerous occasions, most notably in 1899 and again in 2013.http://www.traunstein.de/Aktuelles/Presseberichte.aspx?rssid=BD2823F7-4FE9-4BF7-AB27-37A56F6F9077 Transport * Road: The Bundesautobahn 8 linking Munich and Salzburg, Austria crosses to the south of the town. * Rail: The rail link between Munich and Salzburg was established in 1860.

It is approximately southeast of Lima. It is fed by the north and south forks of the Upper Great Miami River, Cherokee Mans Run, Blackhawk Creek, and Van Horn Creek. The outlet of the lake, at the bulkhead or \\"spillway\\" (located at what is now State Route 366) built in the 1850s by Irish laborers, is the beginning of the Great Miami River. At , Indian Lake is the second largest inland lake in Ohio. Indian Lake, so named by European-American settlers because several tribes lived in the region and found the area to be ideal for fishing and hunting, was originally a group of small lakes and wetlands occupying about . In the 1850s it was adapted as the \\"Lewistown Reservoir,\\" in order to collect water for the Sidney Feeder to the Miami and Erie Canal, which extended from Toledo to Cincinnati. Within a few years after its construction, the canal system became an obsolete form of transportation compared to the new and growing railways. However, Indian Lake remained. It was well served by the railways, and has become a destination for leisure activities and recreation such as fishing and boating. In its early years, the lake had bass as a prize catch for fishermen, with bluegill and crappies being caught in great numbers. Since the mid-20th century, the lake has been stocked with fish including saugeye, for which it has been nationally recognized. Several major fishing tournaments are held each year, with local bass clubs holding weekly contests. Generally these follow \\"catch and return\\" rules. Indian Lake has numerous islands, including the \\"Indian Isles\\" chain that arcs through the center of the Lake, expansive wildlife areas accessible by a network of channels, numerous inlets and bays, and approximately of shoreline. The lake, and adjoining Old Field Beach (the end point of a several mile, lake-front biking/walking trail), Moundwood and Lakeview Harbor boat ramps, marinas at Moundwood and at Cherokee Campgrounds, and other greenspaces including Pew Island, are managed by the Ohio Department of Natural Resources as part of the Ohio state park system. Popular state walking trails are located, in addition to the one ending at Oldfield Beach, at Pew Island and at the Cherokee Campgrounds. A song by The Cowsills during the 1960s is claimed by Indian Lakers to be about their lake, but others contend it was actually about a lake by the same name in New York state. However, in the many years of the Cowsills being popular, they visited regularly and they (the Cowsills) say \\"the song is written about our favorite place.\\" The Cowsills used to camp in Indian Lake, NY and asked a local to write the song. The lake calendar begins with Jimmy Buffett weekend in the first week of February, followed by the annual Boat Show the first weekend in March. An ever-growing fireworks display, part of July 4 observances, is witnessed by people on hundreds of boats as well as crowds along the shores. The \\"Ring of Fire\\", on the Sunday evening of Labor Day weekend, by lore extends an Indian tradition in celebration of the harvest. Some event, whether a restored Chris-Craft boat show, a fishing tournament, or charity \\"poker runs\\" around the lake, is scheduled on almost every summer weekend. Local folklore refers to an abandoned lead mine under the lake, and use of the north side of the lake and the dancehall by Chicago mobsters in days gone by. In its early days extending into the middle of the 20th century, the lake was primarily a destination resort, with many waterfront cottages being lightly built primarily for summer use. Many knew of it as the location of the amusement park with its roller- coaster and other rides and a dancehall, discussed below. While still busiest in the summer, since the late 20th century the lakefront has become developed as an area of second or retirement homes, with many new permanent houses, and remodeling of numerous older cottages. Sandy Beach Park Ohio historical marker outlining the history of the amusement park A major part of the lake's history is the amusement park and dancehall once in Russells Point, advertised as the \\"Midwest's Million Dollar Playground\\". Pappy Wilgus, a Russells Point resident, built Sandy Beach Amusement Park, which opened to the public on May 29, 1924. It was promoted as the \\"Atlantic City of the West\\". They erected a \\"out and back\\" wooden roller coaster, built by the National Amusement Device Company, known variously as \\"Coaster\\", \\"Thriller\\", \\"Big Dipper\\" and \\"Silver Streak\\" through the years. The park offered a penny arcade, a carousel, a millrace ride, a Ferris wheel, a funhouse, boat excursions, and a boardwalk to Sandy Beach Island for swimming. A major attraction was the Minnewawa Dance Hall. With two bandstands and room for hundreds of couples, the park claimed it was the largest and best dance hall in Ohio. Famous orchestras such as those led by Paul Whiteman and Rudy Vall√©e packed in the crowds. Sandy Beach was a great success even during the Great Depression, and hosted many dance marathons in the 1920s and early 1930s. The 1931 National Endurance Dance Marathon, held in Minnewawa, lasted an incredible 80 days, 2 hours. When a fire destroyed much of the wooden structures of the park in 1935, the park was sold to new owners. They invested $100,000 in rebuilding, including replacing Minnewawa Dance Hall with the Moonlight Terrace Gardens. Crowds continued to come through the 1950s. Over 100,000 attended the 1953 Ohio Sesquicentennial celebration at Indian Lake. The park and dancehall began to deteriorate and decline in the 1950s, as attendance fell due to people having more choices and access by personal cars. The park was renamed \\"San Juan Amusement Park\\", inspired by a vintage neon sign \\"San Juan Hotel\\" located near the park's entrance. On the evening of July 4, 1961, rowdies at Russells Point bars across the street started fighting - and before the evening was over, there was a riot involving nearly 500 youths. For nearly a decade, there were repeats of the Independence Day weekend riots. Families chose to go to safer destinations, and motorcycle gangs were attracted to the disruption and came to be part of it. The park management fought back, increasing their security budget, and when it appeared that they had turned the corner on the violence, they renamed the park \\"Indian Lake Playland\\" in 1967. An illuminated slowly revolving statue of the Virgin Mary was erected at the park in 1964 adjacent to the lake in an effort to bring families back. The statue, still locally maintained, remains there to this day. But large, modern new parks at Cedar Point and Kings Island, each within about a two-hour drive, drew away customers. Seeing the success of Disneyland in Anaheim, California, investors in Sandusky, Ohio, made massive investments in Cedar Point in the 1960s. In 1972, the Taft family (Taft Broadcasting) relocated some rides from Coney Island Amusement Park on the banks of the Ohio River 10 miles east of downtown Cincinnati to Kings Mills, Ohio, where they provided the start for a major new theme park known as Kings Island. The Indian Lake park bought a second roller coaster, one of the popular Ben Schiff \\"Wild Mouse\\" coasters, but it was to no avail. The park sold the steel coaster, replacing it with a giant multicolored steel slide, before closing down in 1975. The wooden coaster and other rides continued to deteriorate and sit idle until the park was razed in 1982 after the property was purchased in 1981. Many of the dismantled kiddie rides and other park memorabilia were auctioned off prior to the park's demolition. Much of the property has been privately developed. The park was divided by a channel, the entrance to the Russells Point harbor, with a 1920s footbridge connecting the two sides. A lack of maintenance led to the bridge's closing decades later, though it remained standing. Private residential development has taken place on former parkland, and condos and apartments line the water. Local fundraising and grants allowed the bridge to be re-lighted in 2010, and in 2014 the bridge was renovated with brick walkways and reopened to the public in a ceremony on August 23, 2014. The area Aerial view of the lake in summer Two villages are located on the lake: Russells Point on the south end, and Lakeview about to the northwest along U.S. 33. Other parts of the lake area are within various other government areas: a large part of the lake area is within Stokes Township, while some of the south side is part of Washington Township and some of the east side is part of Richland Township. Its location in the northwestern corner of Logan County places it near Roundhead Township in Hardin County, Goshen Township and Clay Township in Auglaize County, and Jackson Township in Shelby County. Not surprisingly, mail directed to the lake area contains various zip codes. Many unincorporated but well-known areas are part of the lake community: Wolf and Orchard Islands, Artists' Isle, Waterbury, Dunn's Pond, O'Connor's Point, Lake Breeze, Long Island, Avondale, King's Landing, Turkeyfoot and Sassafras Points, Chippewa and Blackhawk, and the many islands and areas comprising the Indian Isles: Lake Ridge, Shawnee, Seminole, Cranberry Bay, Miami, Tecumseh, and Minnewauken. Local low-power FM station WRPO in Russells Point serves the lake area; it is operated by a community-minded citizen.

The screenplay by James Clavell was based on the 1957 short story of the same name by George Langelaan. The film tells the story of a scientist who is transformed into a grotesque creature after a common house fly enters unseen into a molecular transporter he is experimenting with, resulting in his atoms being combined with those of the insect, which produces a human‚Äìfly hybrid. The film was released in CinemaScope with Color by Deluxe by 20th Century Fox. It was followed by two black-and-white sequels, Return of the Fly (1959) and Curse of the Fly (1965). The original film was remade in 1986 by director David Cronenberg. Plot In Montreal, Quebec, Canada, scientist Andr√© Delambre (Al Hedison) is found dead with his head and arm crushed in a hydraulic press. Although his wife H√©l√®ne (Patricia Owens) confesses to the crime, she refuses to provide a motive, and begins acting strangely. In particular, she is obsessed with flies, including a supposedly white-headed fly. Andr√©'s brother, Fran√ßois (Vincent Price), lies and says he caught the white-headed fly; thinking he knows the truth, H√©l√®ne explains the circumstances surrounding Andr√©'s death. In flashback, Andr√©, H√©l√®ne, and their son Philippe (Charles Herbert) are a happy family. Andr√© has been working on a matter transporter device called the disintegrator-integrator. He initially tests it only on small inanimate objects, such as a newspaper, but he then proceeds to living creatures, including the family's pet cat (which fails to reintegrate, but can be heard meowing somewhere) and a guinea pig. After he is satisfied that these tests are succeeding, he builds a man-sized pair of chambers. One day, H√©l√®ne, worried because Andr√© has not come up from the basement lab for a couple of days, goes down to find Andr√© with a black cloth over his head and a strange deformity on his left hand. Communicating with typed notes only, Andr√© tells H√©l√®ne that he tried to transport himself but that a fly was caught in the chamber with him, which resulted in the mixing of their atoms. Now, he has the head and left arm of a fly; and the fly has his miniature head and left arm, though he keeps his mind. Andr√© needs H√©l√®ne to capture the fly so he can reverse the process. Although she expends great effort in her search, she cannot find it and Andr√©'s will begins to fade as the fly's instincts take over his brain. Time is running out, and while Andr√© can still think like a human, he smashes the equipment, burns his notes, and leads H√©l√®ne to the factory. When they arrive, he sets the hydraulic press, puts his head and arm under, and motions for H√©l√®ne to push the button. Andr√©'s arm falls free as the press descends and, trying not to look, she raises the press, replaces the arm, and activates the machine a second time. Upon hearing this confession, the chief detective on the case, Inspector Charas (Herbert Marshall), deems H√©l√®ne insane and guilty of murder. As they are about to haul her away, Philippe tells Fran√ßois he's seen the fly trapped in a web in the back garden. Fran√ßois convinces the inspector to come and see for himself. The two men see the fly, with both Andr√©'s head and arm, trapped in the web as Phillippe told them. It screams \\"Help me! Help me!\\" as a large brown spider advances on it. Just as the spider is about to devour the creature, Charas crushes them both with a rock. Knowing that nobody would believe the truth, he and Fran√ßois decide to declare Andr√©'s death a suicide so that H√©l√®ne is not convicted of murder. In the end, H√©l√®ne, Fran√ßois, and Philippe resume their daily lives. Sometime later, Philippe and H√©l√®ne are playing croquet in the yard. Fran√ßois arrives to take his nephew to the zoo. In reply to his nephew's query about his father's death, Fran√ßois tells Philippe, \\"He was searching for the truth. He almost found a great truth but for one instant, he was careless. The search for the truth is the most important work in the whole world and the most dangerous\\". The film closes with H√©l√®ne escorting her son and Fran√ßois out of the yard.

He showed it to Robert L. Lippert, head of 20th Century Fox's subsidiary B-movie studio Regal Pictures. The film would be made by Lippert's outfit but was released as an \\"official\\" Fox film, not under the less prestigious Regal banner. Lippert hired James Clavell to adapt Langelaan's story on the strength of a previous sci-fi spec script at RKO which had never been produced. It would become Clavell's first filmed screenplay. Harry Spalding recalled the script was \\"the best first draft I ever saw, it needed very little work.\\" The adaptation remained largely faithful to Langelaan's short story, apart from moving its setting from France to Canada, and crafting a happier ending by eliminating a suicide. =Casting= Lippert tried to cast Michael Rennie and Rick Jason in the role of Andr√© Delambre, before settling on then mostly- unknown David Hedison (billed as \\"Al Hedison\\" on-screen.) Hedison's \\"Fly\\" costume featured a twenty-pound fly's head, about which he said: \\"Trying to act in it was like trying to play the piano with boxing gloves on\\".Vieira, p. 172 Hedison was never happy with the makeup, but makeup artist Ben Nye remained very positive about his work, writing years later that despite doing many subsequent science fiction films, \\"I never did anything as sophisticated or original as The Fly\\". Years later, Vincent Price recalled the cast finding some levity during the filming: \\"We were playing this kind of philosophical scene, and every time that little voice [of the fly] would say ‚ÄòHelp me! Help me!‚Äô we would just scream with laughter. It was terrible. It took us about 20 takes to finally get it\\". =Shooting= Sources vary as to the budget, with one source giving it as $350,000, another as $325,000 and others as high as $495,000. The shoot lasted 18 days in total. Lippert said the budget was $480,000. Photographic effects were handled by L. B. Abbott, with makeup by Ben Nye. It was photographed in 20th Century Fox's trademarked CinemaScope with Color by Deluxe. A $28,000 laboratory set was constructed from army surplus equipment. =Release= The Fly was released in July 1958 by 20th Century Fox. Producer-director Kurt Neumann died only a few weeks after its premiere, never realizing he had made the biggest hit of his career. One source claims it was on a double bill with Space Master X-7.Warren, Bill (1986). \\"Keep Watching The Skies Volume 2\\". McFarland & Co., Inc. . Page 741 Reception The Fly received mixed-to-positive reviews upon its initial release, with critic Ivan Butler calling it \\"the most ludicrous, and certainly one of the most revolting science-horror films ever perpetrated\\", and Carlos Clarens offering some praise for the effects but concluding that the film \\"collapses under the weight of many... questions\\". The New York Times critic Howard Thompson was more positive, writing \\"It does indeed contain, briefly, two of the most sickening sights one casual swatter-wielder ever beheld on the screen... Otherwise, believe it or not, \\"The Fly\\" happens to be one of the better, more restrained entries of the \\"shock\\" school... Even with the laboratory absurdities, it holds an interesting philosophy about man's tampering with the unknown.\\" Variety was also fairly positive, writing, \\"One strong factor of the picture is its unusual believability. It is told, by Clavell and Neumann, as a mystery suspense story, so that it has a compelling interest aside from its macabre effects.\\" \\"A first rate science-fiction-horror melodrama\\", declared Harrison's Reports, adding, \\"the action grips one's attention from the opening to the closing scenes, and is filled with suspenseful, spine-chilling situations that will keep movie-goers on the edge of their seats.\\" Philip K. Scheuer of the Los Angeles Times called the film \\"frightening, which is naturally its primary purpose. It is also more skillful in concept and execution than the average science-fiction effort.\\" A mixed review in The Monthly Film Bulletin wrote, \\"The early sequences of this film have great mystery and tension, and the situation is ingeniously built up. But the film soon becomes as nauseating as its bare outline suggests; even the moments which in healthier pictures might provoke a laugh through sheer absurdity offer little relief.\\" Modern criticism has been more uniformly positive. Cinefantastique's Steve Biodrowski declared, \\"the film, though hardly a masterpiece, stands in many ways above the level of B-movie science fiction common in the 1950s.\\" Critic Steven H. Scheuer praised it as a \\"superior science-fiction thriller with a literate script for a change, plus good production effects and capable performances.\\" The Fly was nominated for the 1959 Hugo Award for Best SF or Fantasy Movie at the 17th World Science Fiction Convention. It holds a 95% \\"Fresh\\" rating on Rotten Tomatoes, The film has also received four out of five stars on AllMovie. =Box office= The film was a commercial success, grossing $3 million at the domestic box office against a budget of less than $500,000, and becoming one of the biggest hits of the year for Fox studios. It earned $1.7 million in theatrical rentals.Solomon, Aubrey. Twentieth Century Fox: A Corporate and Financial History (The Scarecrow Filmmakers Series). Lanham, Maryland: Scarecrow Press, 1989. . p227 Lippert claimed it earned $4 million. The film's financial success had the side-effect of boosting co-star Vincent Price (whose previous filmography featured only scattered forays into genre film) into a major horror star. Price himself was positive about the film, saying, decades later, \\"I thought THE FLY was a wonderful film ‚Äì entertaining and great fun.\\" American Film Institute Lists * AFI's 100 Years...100 Thrills ‚Äì Nominated * AFI's 100 Years...100 Movie Quotes: ** \\"Help me!

There was also a remake of the same name in 1986 directed by David Cronenberg, which itself had a sequel, 1989's The Fly II. The success of the film encouraged Lippert to hire Clavell to make his directorial debut with Five Gates to Hell (1959).

TATA box structural elements. The TATA box consensus sequence is TATAWAW, where W is either A or T. In molecular biology, the TATA box (also called the Goldberg-Hogness box) is a sequence of DNA found in the core promoter region of genes in archaea and eukaryotes. The bacterial homolog of the TATA box is called the Pribnow box which has a shorter consensus sequence. The TATA box is considered a non-coding DNA sequence (also known as a cis- regulatory element). It was termed the \\"TATA box\\" as it contains a consensus sequence characterized by repeating T and A base pairs. How the term \\"box\\" originated is unclear. In the 1980s, while investigating nucleotide sequences in mouse genome loci, the Hogness box sequence was found and \\"boxed in\\" at the -31 position. When consensus nucleotides and alternative ones were compared, homologous regions were \\"boxed\\" by the researchers. The boxing in of sequences sheds light on the origin of the term \\"box\\". The TATA box was first identified in 1978 as a component of eukaryotic promoters. Transcription is initiated at the TATA box in TATA-containing genes. The TATA box is the binding site of the TATA-binding protein (TBP) and other transcription factors in some eukaryotic genes. Gene transcription by RNA polymerase II depends on the regulation of the core promoter by long-range regulatory elements such as enhancers and silencers. Without proper regulation of transcription, eukaryotic organisms would not be able to properly respond to their environment. Based on the sequence and mechanism of TATA box initiation, mutations such as insertions, deletions, and point mutations to this consensus sequence can result in phenotypic changes. These phenotypic changes can then turn into a disease phenotype. Some diseases associated with mutations in the TATA box include gastric cancer, spinocerebellar ataxia, Huntington's disease, blindness, Œ≤-thalassemia, immunosuppression, Gilbert's syndrome, and HIV-1. The TATA- binding protein (TBP) could also be targeted by viruses as a means of viral transcription.  History  = Discovery = The TATA box was the first eukaryotic core promoter motif to be identified in 1978 by American biochemist David Hogness while he and his graduate student, Michael Goldberg were on sabbatical at the University of Basel in Switzerland. They first discovered the TATA sequence while analyzing 5' DNA promoter sequences in Drosophila, mammalian, and viral genes. The TATA box was found in protein coding genes transcribed by RNA polymerase II. = Evolutionary history = Most research on the TATA box has been conducted on yeast, human, and Drosophila genomes, however, similar elements have been found in archaea and ancient eukaryotes. In archaea species, the promoter contains an 8 bp AT-rich sequence located ~24 bp upstream of the transcription start site. This sequence was originally called Box A, which is now known to be the sequence that interacts with the homologue of the archaeal TATA-binding protein (TBP). Also, even though some studies have uncovered several similarities, there are others that have detected notable differences between archaeal and eukaryotic TBP. The archaea protein exhibits a greater symmetry in its primary sequence and in the distribution of electrostatic charge, which is important because the higher symmetry lowers the protein's ability to bind the TATA box in a polar manner. Even though the TATA box is present in many eukaryotic promoters, is important to note that is not contained in the majority of promoters. One study found less than 30% of 1031 potential promoter regions contain a putative TATA box motif in humans. In Drosophila, less than 40% of 205 core promoters contain a TATA box. When there is an absence of the TATA box and TBP is not present, the downstream promoter element (DPE) in cooperation with the initiator element (Inr) bind to the transcription factor II D (TFIID), initiating transcription in TATA-less promoters. The DPE has been identified in three Drosophila TATA- less promoters and in the TATA-less human IRF-1 promoter.  Features  = Location = Promoter sequences vary between bacteria and eukaryotes. In eukaryotes, the TATA box is located 25 base pairs upstream of the start site that Rpb4/Rbp7 use to initiate transcription. In metazoans, the TATA box is located 30 base pairs upstream of the transcription start site. While in yeast, S. cerevisiae, the TATA box has a variable position which can range from 40 to 100 bp upstream of the start site. The TATA box is also found in 40% of the core promoters of genes that code for the actin cytoskeleton and contractile apparatus in cells. The type of core promoter affects the level of transcription and expression of a gene. TATA-binding protein (TBP) can be recruited in two ways, by SAGA, a cofactor for RNA polymerase II, or by TFIID. When promoters use the SAGA/TATA box complex to recruit RNA polymerase II, they are more highly regulated and display higher expression levels than promoters using the TFIID/TBP mode of recruitment. = Analogous sequences = In bacteria, promoter regions may contain a Pribnow box, which serves an analogous purpose to the eukaryotic TATA box. The Pribnow box has a 6 bp region centered around the -10 position and an 8-12 bp sequence around the -35 region that are both conserved. A CAAT box (also CAT box) is a region of nucleotides with the following consensus sequence: 5‚Äô GGCCAATCT 3‚Äô. The CAAT box is located about 75-80 bases upstream of the transcription initiation site and about 150 bases upstream of the TATA box. It binds transcription factors (CAAT TF or CTFs) and thereby stabilizes the nearby preinitiation complex for easier binding of RNA polymerases. CAAT boxes are rarely found in genes that express proteins ubiquitous in all cell types.  Structure  = Sequence and prevalence = Figure 2. Mechanism for transcription initiation at the TATA box. Transcription factors, TATA binding protein (TBP), and RNA polymerase II are all recruited to begin transcription. The TATA box is a component of the eukaryotic core promoter and generally contains the consensus sequence 5'-TATA(A/T)A(A/T)-3'. In yeast, for example, one study found that various Saccharomyces genomes had the consensus sequence 5'-TATA(A/T)A(A/T)(A/G)-3', yet only about 20% of yeast genes even contained the TATA sequence. Similarly, in humans only 24% of genes have promoter regions containing the TATA box. Genes containing the TATA-box tend to be involved in stress-responses and certain types of metabolism and are more highly regulated when compared to TATA-less genes. Generally, TATA-containing genes are not involved in essential cellular functions such as cell growth, DNA replication, transcription, and translation because of their highly regulated nature. The TATA box is usually located 25-35 base pairs upstream of the transcription start site. Genes containing the TATA box usually require additional promoter elements, including an initiator site located just upstream of the transcription start site and a downstream core element (DCE). These additional promoter regions work in conjunction with the TATA box to regulate initiation of transcription in eukaryotes.  Function  = Role in transcription initiation = The TATA-box is the site of preinitiation complex formation, which is the first step in transcription initiation in eukaryotes. Formation of the preinitiation complex begins when the multi-subunit transcription factor II D (TFIID) binds to the TATA box at its TATA-binding protein (TBP) subunit. TBP binds to the minor groove of the TATA box via a region of antiparallel Œ≤ sheets in the protein. Three types of molecular interactions contribute to TBP binding to the TATA box: # Four phenylalanine residues(Phe57, Phe74, Phe148, Phe 165) on TBP bind to DNA and form kinks in the DNA, forcing the DNA minor groove open. # Four hydrogen bonds form between polar side chains on TBP amino acid (Asn27, Asn117, Thr82, Thr173)( and bases in the minor groove. # Numerous hydrophobic interactions(~15) form between TBP residues(notably Ile152 and Leu163) and DNA bases, including van der Waals forces. Additionally, binding of TBP is facilitated by stabilizing interactions with DNA flanking the TATA box, which consists of G-C rich sequences. These secondary interactions induce bending of the DNA and helical unwinding. The degree of DNA bending is species and sequence dependent. For example, one study used the adenovirus TATA promoter sequence (5'-CGCTATAAAAGGGC-3') as a model binding sequence and found that human TBP binding to the TATA box induced a 97¬∞ bend toward the major groove while the yeast TBP protein only induced an 82¬∞ bend. X-ray crystallography studies of TBP/TATA-box complexes generally agree that the DNA goes through an ~80¬∞ bend during the process of TBP-binding. The conformational changes induced by TBP binding to the TATA box allows for additional transcription factors and RNA polymerase II to bind to the promoter region. TFIID first binds to the TATA box, facilitated by TFIIA binding to the upstream part of the TFIID complex. TFIIB then binds to the TFIID-TFIIA-DNA complex through interactions both upstream and downstream of the TATA box. RNA polymerase II is then recruited to this multi-protein complex with the help of TFIIF. Additional transcription factors then bind, first TFIIE and then TFIIH. This completes the assembly of the preinitiation complex for eukaryotic transcription. Generally, the TATA box is found at RNA polymerase II promoter regions, although some in vitro studies have demonstrated that RNA polymerase III can recognize TATA sequences. This cluster of RNA polymerase II and various transcription factors is known as the basal transcriptional complex (BTC). In this state, it only gives a low level of transcription. Other factors must stimulate the BTC to increase transcription levels. One such example of a BTC stimulating region of DNA is the CAAT box. Additional factors, including the Mediator complex, transcriptional regulatory proteins, and nucleosome-modifying enzymes also enhance transcription in vivo. = Interactions = In specific cell types or on specific promoters TBP can be replaced by one of several TBP-related factors (TRF1 in Drosophila, TBPL1/TRF2 in metazoans, TBPL2/TRF3 in vertebrates), some of which interact with the TATA box similar to TBP. Interaction of TATA boxes with a variety of activators or repressors can influence the transcription of genes in many ways. Enhancers are long-range regulatory elements that increase promoter activity while silencers repress promoter activity.  Mutations  Figure 3. Effects on TBP binding to the TATA box from mutations. Wildtype shows transcription done normally. An insertion or deletion shifts the TATA box recognition site which results in a shifted transcription site. Point mutations risk the TBP being unable to bind for initiation. Mutations to the TATA box can range from a deletion or insertion to a point mutation with varying effects based on the gene that has been mutated. The mutations change the binding of the TATA-binding protein (TBP) for transcription initiation. Thus, there is a resulting change in phenotype based on the gene that is not being expressed (Figure 3). = Insertions or deletions = One of the first studies of TATA box mutations looked at a sequence of DNA from Agrobacterium tumefaciens for the octopine type cytokinin gene. This specific gene has three TATA boxes. A phenotype change was only observed when all three TATA boxes were deleted. An insertion of extra base pairs between the last TATA box and the transcription start site resulted in a shift in the start site; thus, resulting in a phenotypic change. From this original mutation study, a change in transcription can be seen when there is no TATA box to promote transcription, but transcription of a gene will occur when there is an insertion to the sequence. The nature of the resulting phenotype may be affected due to the insertion. Mutations in maize promoters affect the expression of the promoter genes in a plant-organ- specific manner. A duplication of the TATA box leads to a significant decrease in enzymatic activity in the scutellum and roots, leaving pollen enzymatic levels unaffected. A deletion of the TATA box leads to a small decrease in enzymatic activity in the scutellum and roots, but a large decrease in enzymatic levels in pollen. = Point mutations = Point mutations to the TATA box have similar varying phenotypic changes depending on the gene that is being affected. Studies also show that the placement of the mutation in the TATA box sequence hinders the binding of TBP. For example, a mutation from TATAAAA to CATAAAA does completely hinder the binding sufficiently to change transcription, the neighboring sequences can affect if there is a change or not. However, a change can be seen in HeLa cells with a TATAAAA to TATACAA which leads to a 20 fold decrease in transcription. Some diseases that can be caused due to this insufficiency by specific gene transcription are: Thalassemia, lung cancer, chronic hemolytic anemia, immunosuppression, hemophilia B Leyden, and thrombophlebitis and myocardial infarction. Savinkova et al. has written a simulation to predict the KD value for a selected TATA box sequence and TBP. This can be used to directly predict the phenotypic traits resulting from a selected mutation based on how tightly TBP is binding to the TATA box. = Diseases = Mutations in the TATA box region affects the binding of the TATA-binding protein (TBP) for transcription initiation, which may cause carriers to have a disease phenotype. Gastric cancer is correlated with TATA box polymorphism. The TATA box has a binding site for the transcription factor of the PG2 gene. This gene produces PG2 serum, which is used as a biomarker for tumours in gastric cancer. Longer TATA box sequences correlates with higher levels of PG2 serum indicating gastric cancer conditions. Carriers with shorter TATA box sequences may produce lower levels of PG2 serum. Several neurodegenerative disorders are associated TATA box mutations. Two disorders have been highlighted, spinocerebellar ataxia and Huntington's disease. In spinocerebellar ataxia, the disease phenotype is caused by expansion of the polyglutamine repeat in the TATA-binding protein (TBP). An accumulation of these polyglutamine-TBP cells will occur, as shown by protein aggregates in brain sections of patients, resulting in a loss of neuronal cells. Blindness can be caused by excessive cataract formation when the TATA box is targeted by microRNAs to increase the level of oxidative stress genes. MicroRNAs can target the 3'-untranslated region and bind to the TATA box to activate the transcription of oxidative stress related genes. SNPs in TATA boxes are associated with B-thalassemia, immunosuppression, and other neurological disorders. SNPs destabilize the TBP/TATA complex which significantly decreases the rate at which TATA-binding proteins (TBP) will bind to the TATA box. This leads to lower levels of transcription affecting the severity of the disease. Results from studies have shown the interaction in vitro so far, but results may be comparable to that in vivo. Gilbert's syndrome is correlated with UTG1A1 TATA box polymorphism. This poses a risk for developing jaundice in newborns. MicroRNAs also play a role in replicating viruses such as HIV-1. Novel HIV-1-encoded microRNA have been found to enhance the production of the virus as well as activating HIV-1 latency by targeting the TATA box region.  Clinical significance  = Technology = Many of the studies so far have been performed in vitro, providing only a prediction of what may happen not a real-time representation of what is happening in the cells. Recent studies in 2016 have been done to demonstrate TATA-binding activity in vivo. Core promoter-specific mechanisms for transcription initiation by the canonical TBP/TFIID-dependent basal transcription machinery has recently been documented in vivo showing the activation by SRF-dependent upstream activating sequence (UAS) of the human ACTB gene involved in TATA- binding. = Cancer therapy = Pharmaceutical companies have been designing cancer therapy drugs to target DNA in traditional methods over the years, and have proven to be successful. However, the toxicity of these drugs have pushed scientists to explore other processes related to DNA that could be targeted instead. In recent years, a collective effort has been made to find cancer- specific molecular targets, such as protein-DNA complexes, which include the TATA binding motif. Compounds that trap the protein-DNA intermediate could result in it being toxic to the cell once they encounter a DNA processing event. Example of drugs that contain such compounds include topotecan, SN-38 (topoisomerase I), doxorubicin, and mitoxantrone (topoisomerase II). Cisplatin is a compound that binds covalently to adjacent guanines in the major groove of DNA, which distorts DNA to allow access of DNA-binding proteins in the minor groove. This will destabilize the interaction between the TATA-binding protein (TBP) to the TATA box. The end result is to immobilize the TATA- binding protein (TBP) on DNA in order to down-regulate transcription initiation.  Genetic engineering  = TATA box modification = Evolutionary changes have pushed plants to adapt to the changing environmental conditions. In the history of Earth, the development of Earth's aerobic atmosphere resulted in an iron deficiency in plants. Compared to other members of the same species, Malus baccata var. xiaojinensis has a TATA box inserted in the promoter upstream of the iron-regulated transporter 1 (IRT1) promoter. As a result, the promoter activity levels are enhanced, increasing TFIID activity and subsequently transcription initiation, resulting in a more iron- efficient phenotype.

Sophisticated programs of gene expression are widely observed in biology, for example to trigger developmental pathways, respond to environmental stimuli, or adapt to new food sources. Virtually any step of gene expression can be modulated, from transcriptional initiation, to RNA processing, and to the post-translational modification of a protein. Often, one gene regulator controls another, and so on, in a gene regulatory network. Gene regulation is essential for viruses, prokaryotes and eukaryotes as it increases the versatility and adaptability of an organism by allowing the cell to express protein when needed. Although as early as 1951, Barbara McClintock showed interaction between two genetic loci, Activator (Ac) and Dissociator (Ds), in the color formation of maize seeds, the first discovery of a gene regulation system is widely considered to be the identification in 1961 of the lac operon, discovered by Fran√ßois Jacob and Jacques Monod, in which some enzymes involved in lactose metabolism are expressed by E. coli only in the presence of lactose and absence of glucose. In multicellular organisms, gene regulation drives cellular differentiation and morphogenesis in the embryo, leading to the creation of different cell types that possess different gene expression profiles from the same genome sequence. Although this does not explain how gene regulation originated, evolutionary biologists include it as a partial explanation of how evolution works at a molecular level, and it is central to the science of evolutionary developmental biology (\\"evo-devo\\").  Regulated stages of gene expression  Any step of gene expression may be modulated, from the DNA-RNA transcription step to post- translational modification of a protein. The following is a list of stages where gene expression is regulated, the most extensively utilised point is Transcription Initiation: * Chromatin domains * Transcription * Post- transcriptional modification * RNA transport * Translation * mRNA degradation  Modification of DNA  Histone tails and their function in chromatin formation In eukaryotes, the accessibility of large regions of DNA can depend on its chromatin structure, which can be altered as a result of histone modifications directed by DNA methylation, ncRNA, or DNA-binding protein. Hence these modifications may up or down regulate the expression of a gene. Some of these modifications that regulate gene expression are inheritable and are referred to as epigenetic regulation. = Structural = Transcription of DNA is dictated by its structure. In general, the density of its packing is indicative of the frequency of transcription. Octameric protein complexes called histones together with a segment of DNA wound around the eight histone proteins (together referred to as a nucleosome) are responsible for the amount of supercoiling of DNA, and these complexes can be temporarily modified by processes such as phosphorylation or more permanently modified by processes such as methylation. Such modifications are considered to be responsible for more or less permanent changes in gene expression levels. = Chemical = Methylation of DNA is a common method of gene silencing. DNA is typically methylated by methyltransferase enzymes on cytosine nucleotides in a CpG dinucleotide sequence (also called \\"CpG islands\\" when densely clustered). Analysis of the pattern of methylation in a given region of DNA (which can be a promoter) can be achieved through a method called bisulfite mapping. Methylated cytosine residues are unchanged by the treatment, whereas unmethylated ones are changed to uracil. The differences are analyzed by DNA sequencing or by methods developed to quantify SNPs, such as Pyrosequencing (Biotage) or MassArray (Sequenom), measuring the relative amounts of C/T at the CG dinucleotide. Abnormal methylation patterns are thought to be involved in oncogenesis. Histone acetylation is also an important process in transcription. Histone acetyltransferase enzymes (HATs) such as CREB-binding protein also dissociate the DNA from the histone complex, allowing transcription to proceed. Often, DNA methylation and histone deacetylation work together in gene silencing. The combination of the two seems to be a signal for DNA to be packed more densely, lowering gene expression.  Regulation of transcription  thumb250pxLac Operon1: RNA Polymerase, 2: Repressor, 3: Promoter, 4: Operator, 5: Lactose, 6: lacZ, 7: lacY, 8: lacA. Top: The gene is essentially turned off. There is no lactose to inhibit the repressor, so the repressor binds to the operator, which obstructs the RNA polymerase from binding to the promoter and making lactase. Bottom: The gene is turned on. Lactose is inhibiting the repressor, allowing the RNA polymerase to bind with the promoter, and express the genes, which synthesize lactase. Eventually, the lactase will digest all of the lactose, until there is none to bind to the repressor. The repressor will then bind to the operator, stopping the manufacture of lactase. Regulation of transcription thus controls when transcription occurs and how much RNA is created. Transcription of a gene by RNA polymerase can be regulated by several mechanisms. Specificity factors alter the specificity of RNA polymerase for a given promoter or set of promoters, making it more or less likely to bind to them (i.e., sigma factors used in prokaryotic transcription). Repressors bind to the Operator, coding sequences on the DNA strand that are close to or overlapping the promoter region, impeding RNA polymerase's progress along the strand, thus impeding the expression of the gene. The image to the right demonstrates regulation by a repressor in the lac operon. General transcription factors position RNA polymerase at the start of a protein-coding sequence and then release the polymerase to transcribe the mRNA. Activators enhance the interaction between RNA polymerase and a particular promoter, encouraging the expression of the gene. Activators do this by increasing the attraction of RNA polymerase for the promoter, through interactions with subunits of the RNA polymerase or indirectly by changing the structure of the DNA. Enhancers are sites on the DNA helix that are bound by activators in order to loop the DNA bringing a specific promoter to the initiation complex. Enhancers are much more common in eukaryotes than prokaryotes, where only a few examples exist (to date). Silencers are regions of DNA sequences that, when bound by particular transcription factors, can silence expression of the gene. Regulation of transcription in cancer In vertebrates, the majority of gene promoters contain a CpG island with numerous CpG sites. When many of a gene's promoter CpG sites are methylated the gene becomes silenced. Colorectal cancers typically have 3 to 6 driver mutations and 33 to 66 hitchhiker or passenger mutations. However, transcriptional silencing may be of more importance than mutation in causing progression to cancer. For example, in colorectal cancers about 600 to 800 genes are transcriptionally silenced by CpG island methylation (see regulation of transcription in cancer). Transcriptional repression in cancer can also occur by other epigenetic mechanisms, such as altered expression of microRNAs. In breast cancer, transcriptional repression of BRCA1 may occur more frequently by over-expressed microRNA-182 than by hypermethylation of the BRCA1 promoter (see Low expression of BRCA1 in breast and ovarian cancers). Regulation of transcription in addiction One of the cardinal features of addiction is its persistence. The persistent behavioral changes appear to be due to long-lasting changes, resulting from epigenetic alterations affecting gene expression, within particular regions of the brain. Drugs of abuse cause three types of epigenetic alteration in the brain. These are (1) histone acetylations and histone methylations, (2) DNA methylation at CpG sites, and (3) epigenetic downregulation or upregulation of microRNAs. (See Epigenetics of cocaine addiction for some details.) Chronic nicotine intake in mice alters brain cell epigenetic control of gene expression through acetylation of histones. This increases expression in the brain of the protein FosB, important in addiction. Cigarette addiction was also studied in about 16,000 humans, including never smokers, current smokers, and those who had quit smoking for up to 30 years. In blood cells, more than 18,000 CpG sites (of the roughly 450,000 analyzed CpG sites in the genome) had frequently altered methylation among current smokers. These CpG sites occurred in over 7,000 genes, or roughly a third of known human genes. The majority of the differentially methylated CpG sites returned to the level of never-smokers within five years of smoking cessation. However, 2,568 CpGs among 942 genes remained differentially methylated in former versus never smokers. Such remaining epigenetic changes can be viewed as ‚Äúmolecular scars‚Äù that may affect gene expression. In rodent models, drugs of abuse, including cocaine, methampheamine, alcohol and tobacco smoke products, all cause DNA damage in the brain. During repair of DNA damages some individual repair events can alter the methylation of DNA and/or the acetylations or methylations of histones at the sites of damage, and thus can contribute to leaving an epigenetic scar on chromatin. Such epigenetic scars likely contribute to the persistent epigenetic changes found in addiction. Regulation of transcription in learning and memory DNA methylation is the addition of a methyl group to the DNA that happens at cytosine. The image shows a cytosine single ring base and a methyl group added on to the 5 carbon. In mammals, DNA methylation occurs almost exclusively at a cytosine that is followed by a guanine. In mammals, methylation of cytosine (see Figure) in DNA is a major regulatory mediator. Methylated cytosines primarily occur in dinucleotide sequences where cytosine is followed by a guanine, a CpG site. The total number of CpG sites in the human genome is approximately 28 million. and generally about 70% of all CpG sites have a methylated cytosine. The identified areas of the human brain are involved in memory formation. In a rat, a painful learning experience, contextual fear conditioning, can result in a life-long fearful memory after a single training event. Cytosine methylation is altered in the promoter regions of about 9.17% of all genes in the hippocampus neuron DNA of a rat that has been subjected to a brief fear conditioning experience. The hippocampus is where new memories are initially stored. Methylation of CpGs in a promoter region of a gene represses transcription while methylation of CpGs in the body of a gene increases expression. TET enzymes play a central role in demethylation of methylated cytosines. Demethylation of CpGs in a gene promoter by TET enzyme activity increases transcription of the gene. When contextual fear conditioning is applied to a rat, more than 5,000 differentially methylated regions (DMRs) (of 500 nucleotides each) occur in the rat hippocampus neural genome both one hour and 24 hours after the conditioning in the hippocampus. This causes about 500 genes to be up-regulated (often due to demethylation of CpG sites in a promoter region) and about 1,000 genes to be down-regulated (often due to newly formed 5-methylcytosine at CpG sites in a promoter region). The pattern of induced and repressed genes within neurons appears to provide a molecular basis for forming the first transient memory of this training event in the hippocampus of the rat brain.  Post-transcriptional regulation  After the DNA is transcribed and mRNA is formed, there must be some sort of regulation on how much the mRNA is translated into proteins. Cells do this by modulating the capping, splicing, addition of a Poly(A) Tail, the sequence-specific nuclear export rates, and, in several contexts, sequestration of the RNA transcript. These processes occur in eukaryotes but not in prokaryotes. This modulation is a result of a protein or transcript that, in turn, is regulated and may have an affinity for certain sequences.  Three prime untranslated regions and microRNAs  Three prime untranslated regions (3'-UTRs) of messenger RNAs (mRNAs) often contain regulatory sequences that post- transcriptionally influence gene expression. Such 3'-UTRs often contain both binding sites for microRNAs (miRNAs) as well as for regulatory proteins. By binding to specific sites within the 3'-UTR, miRNAs can decrease gene expression of various mRNAs by either inhibiting translation or directly causing degradation of the transcript. The 3'-UTR also may have silencer regions that bind repressor proteins that inhibit the expression of a mRNA. The 3'-UTR often contains miRNA response elements (MREs). MREs are sequences to which miRNAs bind. These are prevalent motifs within 3'-UTRs. Among all regulatory motifs within the 3'-UTRs (e.g. including silencer regions), MREs make up about half of the motifs. As of 2014, the miRBase web site,miRBase.org an archive of miRNA sequences and annotations, listed 28,645 entries in 233 biologic species. Of these, 1,881 miRNAs were in annotated human miRNA loci. miRNAs were predicted to have an average of about four hundred target mRNAs (affecting expression of several hundred genes). Freidman et al. estimate that >45,000 miRNA target sites within human mRNA 3'-UTRs are conserved above background levels, and >60% of human protein-coding genes have been under selective pressure to maintain pairing to miRNAs. Direct experiments show that a single miRNA can reduce the stability of hundreds of unique mRNAs. Other experiments show that a single miRNA may repress the production of hundreds of proteins, but that this repression often is relatively mild (less than 2-fold). The effects of miRNA dysregulation of gene expression seem to be important in cancer. For instance, in gastrointestinal cancers, a 2015 paper identified nine miRNAs as epigenetically altered and effective in down- regulating DNA repair enzymes. The effects of miRNA dysregulation of gene expression also seem to be important in neuropsychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease and autism spectrum disorders.  Regulation of translation  The translation of mRNA can also be controlled by a number of mechanisms, mostly at the level of initiation. Recruitment of the small ribosomal subunit can indeed be modulated by mRNA secondary structure, antisense RNA binding, or protein binding. In both prokaryotes and eukaryotes, a large number of RNA binding proteins exist, which often are directed to their target sequence by the secondary structure of the transcript, which may change depending on certain conditions, such as temperature or presence of a ligand (aptamer). Some transcripts act as ribozymes and self-regulate their expression.  Examples of gene regulation  * Enzyme induction is a process in which a molecule (e.g., a drug) induces (i.e., initiates or enhances) the expression of an enzyme. * The induction of heat shock proteins in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. * The Lac operon is an interesting example of how gene expression can be regulated. * Viruses, despite having only a few genes, possess mechanisms to regulate their gene expression, typically into an early and late phase, using collinear systems regulated by anti-terminators (lambda phage) or splicing modulators (HIV). * Gal4 is a transcriptional activator that controls the expression of GAL1, GAL7, and GAL10 (all of which code for the metabolic of galactose in yeast). The GAL4/UAS system has been used in a variety of organisms across various phyla to study gene expression. = Developmental biology = A large number of studied regulatory systems come from developmental biology. Examples include: * The colinearity of the Hox gene cluster with their nested antero-posterior patterning * Pattern generation of the hand (digits - interdigits): the gradient of sonic hedgehog (secreted inducing factor) from the zone of polarizing activity in the limb, which creates a gradient of active Gli3, which activates Gremlin, which inhibits BMPs also secreted in the limb, results in the formation of an alternating pattern of activity as a result of this reaction-diffusion system. * Somitogenesis is the creation of segments (somites) from a uniform tissue (Pre-somitic Mesoderm). They are formed sequentially from anterior to posterior. This is achieved in amniotes possibly by means of two opposing gradients, Retinoic acid in the anterior (wavefront) and Wnt and Fgf in the posterior, coupled to an oscillating pattern (segmentation clock) composed of FGF + Notch and Wnt in antiphase. * Sex determination in the soma of a Drosophila requires the sensing of the ratio of autosomal genes to sex chromosome-encoded genes, which results in the production of sexless splicing factor in females, resulting in the female isoform of doublesex.Gilbert SF (2003). Developmental biology, 7th ed., Sunderland, Mass: Sinauer Associates, 65‚Äì6. .  Circuitry  = Up-regulation and down-regulation = Up- regulation is a process that occurs within a cell triggered by a signal (originating internal or external to the cell), which results in increased expression of one or more genes and as a result the protein(s) encoded by those genes. Conversely, down-regulation is a process resulting in decreased gene and corresponding protein expression. * Up-regulation occurs, for example, when a cell is deficient in some kind of receptor. In this case, more receptor protein is synthesized and transported to the membrane of the cell and, thus, the sensitivity of the cell is brought back to normal, reestablishing homeostasis. * Down-regulation occurs, for example, when a cell is overstimulated by a neurotransmitter, hormone, or drug for a prolonged period of time, and the expression of the receptor protein is decreased in order to protect the cell (see also tachyphylaxis). = Inducible vs. repressible systems = Gene Regulation can be summarized by the response of the respective system: * Inducible systems - An inducible system is off unless there is the presence of some molecule (called an inducer) that allows for gene expression. The molecule is said to \\"induce expression\\". The manner by which this happens is dependent on the control mechanisms as well as differences between prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. * Repressible systems - A repressible system is on except in the presence of some molecule (called a corepressor) that suppresses gene expression. The molecule is said to \\"repress expression\\". The manner by which this happens is dependent on the control mechanisms as well as differences between prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells. The GAL4/UAS system is an example of both an inducible and repressible system. Gal4 binds an upstream activation sequence (UAS) to activate the transcription of the GAL1/GAL7/GAL10 cassette. On the other hand, a MIG1 response to the presence of glucose can inhibit GAL4 and therefore stop the expression of the GAL1/GAL7/GAL10 cassette. = Theoretical circuits = * Repressor/Inducer: an activation of a sensor results in the change of expression of a gene * negative feedback: the gene product downregulates its own production directly or indirectly, which can result in ** keeping transcript levels constant/proportional to a factor ** inhibition of run-away reactions when coupled with a positive feedback loop ** creating an oscillator by taking advantage in the time delay of transcription and translation, given that the mRNA and protein half-life is shorter * positive feedback: the gene product upregulates its own production directly or indirectly, which can result in ** signal amplification ** bistable switches when two genes inhibit each other and both have positive feedback ** pattern generation  Study methods  In general, most experiments investigating differential expression used whole cell extracts of RNA, called steady-state levels, to determine which genes changed and by how much. These are, however, not informative of where the regulation has occurred and may mask conflicting regulatory processes (see post-transcriptional regulation), but it is still the most commonly analysed (quantitative PCR and DNA microarray). When studying gene expression, there are several methods to look at the various stages. In eukaryotes these include: * The local chromatin environment of the region can be determined by ChIP-chip analysis by pulling down RNA Polymerase II, Histone 3 modifications, Trithorax-group protein, Polycomb-group protein, or any other DNA-binding element to which a good antibody is available. * Epistatic interactions can be investigated by synthetic genetic array analysis * Due to post-transcriptional regulation, transcription rates and total RNA levels differ significantly. To measure the transcription rates nuclear run-on assays can be done and newer high-throughput methods are being developed, using thiol labelling instead of radioactivity. * Only 5% of the RNA polymerised in the nucleus exits, and not only introns, abortive products, and non-sense transcripts are degradated. Therefore, the differences in nuclear and cytoplasmic levels can be see by separating the two fractions by gentle lysis. * Alternative splicing can be analysed with a splicing array or with a tiling array (see DNA microarray). * All in vivo RNA is complexed as RNPs. The quantity of transcripts bound to specific protein can be also analysed by RIP-Chip. For example, DCP2 will give an indication of sequestered protein; ribosome-bound gives and indication of transcripts active in transcription (although a more dated method, called polysome fractionation, is still popular in some labs) * Protein levels can be analysed by Mass spectrometry, which can be compared only to quantitative PCR data, as microarray data is relative and not absolute. * RNA and protein degradation rates are measured by means of transcription inhibitors (actinomycin D or Œ±-amanitin) or translation inhibitors (Cycloheximide), respectively.

She has been a Member of the Scottish Parliament since its inception in 1999 and has since 2011 represented the Midlothian South, Tweeddale and Lauderdale constituency, having previously been a member for the South of Scotland region from 1999 until 2011. Early life Grahame was born on 9 September 1944 in Burton-on-Trent, Staffordshire, England, to a Scottish father and English mother. Her maternal grandfather was Welsh. Grahame was brought up in Edinburgh, attending Boroughmuir High School. She attained a Scottish Master of Arts degree from the University of Edinburgh in 1965 and subsequently gained her Diploma of Education from Moray House College of Education in 1966. After graduating, Grahame worked as a secondary teacher of English in a number of schools in Fife and Dumfries and Galloway. After a period as a housewife, she returned to Edinburgh University as a mature student where she earned a Bachelor of Laws degree in 1984 and a Diploma in Legal Practice in 1985, subsequently practising as a solicitor at a number of law firms until her election as an MSP in 1999. Political career Christine Grahame's office in Galashiels Grahame joined the Scottish National Party in 1970. Using her married name, Christine Creech, she was the SNP candidate at the 1992 General Election for Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale. In 1994 she stood for election to the European Parliament, again unsuccessfully. At the 1999 Scottish Parliament election she fought Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale again. Although she finished second, her position on the SNP regional list took her to Holyrood, after which she divorced and reverted to her maiden name. She contested Tweeddale, Ettrick and Lauderdale at both the 2003 and 2007 elections, coming within 1,000 votes of victory on both occasions and being subsequently elected on the regional South of Scotland list. From 2001 to 2003, she was Convener of the Justice Committee. In 2004, Grahame ran as a candidate for depute leadership of the SNP after depute leader Roseanna Cunningham entered the contest to replace leader John Swinney. She was defeated by Nicola Sturgeon. After the election, she was reshuffled from chair of the Scottish Parliament's Health committee to Shadow Minister for Social Justice, generally seen by media commentators as an upwards shift. In June 2005, she was elected Honorary President of the Federation of Student Nationalists. In the 2011 Scottish Parliament election, Grahame won the redrawn seat of Midlothian South, Tweeddale and Lauderdale, defeating former Liberal Democrat finance spokesman Jeremy Purvis. Following her election, she was again selected as Convener of the Justice Committee for the session. In the 2016 Scottish Parliament election, Grahame held the seat again, increasing her share of the vote to 45.1%. Following the 2016 election, she was elected as Deputy Presiding Officer of the Scottish Parliament, serving alongside Linda Fabiani MSP. Grahame was also re-elected as Convener of the Cross Party Group on Animal Welfare. During the COVID-19 pandemic, she went into self isolation as someone over 70 years old and therefore at more risk of developing severe COVID-19 symptoms. In April 2020, Scottish Labour's Lewis Macdonald was elected as interim Deputy Presiding Officer in her absence. Causes Since entering the Scottish Parliament in 1999 Grahame has picked up a number of causes, notably; Borders Railway For more information see: Borders Railway One of Grahame's first actions as an MSP in 1999 was to set up a Cross Party Group to support the work of public petitions on the re- establishment of the Borders Railway which had been closed in 1969 during the controversial Beeching cuts. She continued to campaign for this for a number of years, with the line eventually opening between Edinburgh and Tweedbank in 2015. Grahame has named her continued support of this as one of her biggest achievements and said on its opening ‚ÄúAs someone who has campaigned for the return of the Waverley Line since 1999, it was an absolute privilege to be have finally traveled the length of the journey by rail, and to appreciate our wonderful countryside from a new perspective. So far this project has been an overwhelming success... If my experience is anything to go by, this will undoubtedly bring many, many visitors to Midlothian and the Borders as well as encouraging people to stay and live in the area.‚Äù Great Tapestry of Scotland In late 2015 Grahame became involved in a public dispute with Scottish Borders Council over the siting of the Great Tapestry of Scotland in the constituency. Councillors had approved a ¬£6m purpose built visitor centre at Tweedbank Railway Station, however Grahame contested that the business case was flawed and persuaded Scottish Government ministers to investigate this further before releasing the funding required to create it. Grahame favoured siting the tapestry in a disused building in Galashiels arguing that that option had more potential to regenerate the area and encourage tourists to access transport links from Galashiels to the wider region. In June 2016 one councillor resigned from the SNP over Grahame's intervention, claiming it represented a \\"lack of support\\" for SNP councillors and that he had not voted for her in the 2016 Scottish Parliament elections. However, Grahame's position was eventually vindicated, with the council recommending Galashiels as the preferred site in December 2016 stating \\"Galashiels offers the greatest potential to provide a world class attraction which will make a significant contribution to the Borders economy.‚Äù Lockerbie Bombing Grahame has been outspoken in her view that the conviction of Abdelbaset al-Megrahi of the 1988 Lockerbie bombing is unsafe and represents a miscarriage of justice. In May 2009, Grahame visited Megrahi, in Greenock jail. After her visit, she told the press: \\"I found it quite upsetting. The man is obviously very ill and he is desperate to see his family - absolutely desperate to see his family - so, whatever it takes, that's the priority. He did tell me things I can't discuss with you. But I am absolutely more convinced than ever that there has been a miscarriage of justice.\\" A month later, Grahame arranged a second meeting with the prisoner, Megrahi. A few days after the dropping of Megrahi's appeal against conviction and his release on compassionate grounds on 20 August 2009, Grahame wrote an op-ed article for The Independent saying she is convinced of his innocence: \\"He is not a saint, of course ‚Äì he had a history with Libyan intelligence ‚Äì but his hands are clean over Lockerbie.\\" Grahame has lodged several questions and motions on this in the Scottish Parliament and continues to be involved with campaign groups on the matter. Republicanism Grahame is a supporter of the political organisation Republic, a campaign to replace the British Monarchy with an elected head of state. In July 2009, Grahame snubbed Elizabeth II by checking her e-mails rather than attending the royal speech at Holyrood to mark the tenth anniversary of Scottish devolution. The move drew some criticism from commentators and fellow MSPs, however on the BBC Radio Good Morning Scotland programme, Grahame stated: \\"I'm earning and working for my constituents far more than if I sit hypocritically in the chamber watching a monarch for an institution I do not support.\\" Personal life Grahame has two sons and is a grandmother. She has stated previously she has a harmless neurological tremor, which is hereditary and can cause visible shaking.

A patio (, from ; \\"courtyard\\", \\"forecourt\\", \\"yard\\") is an outdoor space generally used for dining or recreation that adjoins a residence and is typically paved. In Australia the term is expanded to include roofed structures such as a veranda, which provides protection from sun and rain. Construction Patios are most commonly paved with concrete or stone slabs (also known as paving flags). They can also be created using bricks, block paving, tiles, cobbles, or gravel. Other kinds of patio materials these days include alumawood, aluminum, acrylic, and glass. Patio options include concrete, stamped concrete, and aggregate concrete. Stamped concrete costs more, is known to be slippery, requires being resealed, and dyes typically fade in time. Aggregate concrete uses stones exposed giving its own style. Other common patio features include additional of reinforcement for hot tubs and additional steps from the home. Restaurant patio Patio is also a general term used for outdoor seating at restaurants, especially in Canadian English. While common in Europe even before 1900, eating outdoors at restaurants in North America was exotic until the 1940s. The Hotel St. Moritz in New York in the 1950s advertised itself as having the first true continental cafe with outdoor seating. The Toronto Star welcomed that city's first patio in the 1960s.

He was previously a member of the Scottish National Party (SNP), and he was elected to the Scottish Parliament to represent the West of Scotland at the 2003 election. Political career Martin previously worked for Kay Ullrich, a SNP MSP. When she indicated she would stand down at the 2003 election, Martin was selected to be the candidate for Cunninghame North as well as being placed at the top of the SNP's list. At the election he was unsuccessful in the constituency vote, however was elected as a regional member for the West of Scotland. He was a prominent backer of Dr Bill Wilson who stood against John Swinney in the SNP leadership contest in 2003. He has been critical of the direction of the SNP since becoming an MSP, believing they are being dragged into the political centre away from their traditional left-of-centre position. He also believes the party is not vociferous enough in its advocation of Scottish independence. He was suspended from the Scottish National Party on 25 April 2004 after making repeated public criticism of John Swinney, and was expelled from the SNP on 10 July 2004, soon after Swinney had resigned. After becoming an Independent MSP, Campbell Martin played a prominent role in fighting a number of decisions taken by Labour-led North Ayrshire Council. He has also continued his opposition to what he considers to be the centre-right re-positioning of the SNP and its advocacy of a 'culture of independence' rather than national independence. Campbell Martin stood as an Independent candidate in the Cunninghame North constituency at the May 2007 Scottish Parliament Election, securing 4,423 votes (14.6%), but was not re- elected. In August 2011 he joined the Scottish Socialist Party,Colin Fox's blog and on 1 October 2011 he spoke at an SSP fringe meeting in Glasgow following the STUC anti-cuts demonstration. He participated as a delegate at the SSP national conference in March 2012. He was the SSP candidate for the Ardrossan and Arran ward on North Ayrshire Council in May 2012, but he was not elected. Journalism Between 2007 and 2015, Campbell Martin edited the3towns com , an online local newspaper covering the three North Ayrshire towns of Ardrossan, Saltcoats and Stevenston. He is now the Creative Director of MacAulay Gibson Productions, an independent production company producing factual television programmes and business promos. He was involved in the production of The Only Game in Town, a documentary that looked at the procurement process for the North Ayrshire Schools Public Private Partnership project. While still producing pro-independence articles for mainly online publications, Campbell Martin is no longer a member of a political party.

Administrated from Agigea, it is an important part of the waterway link between the North Sea and the Black Sea via the Rhine‚ÄìMain‚ÄìDanube Canal. The main branch of the canal, with a length of , which connects the Port of CernavodƒÉ with the Port of Constan»õa, was built in two periods, 1949‚Äì1953 and 1973‚Äì1984, while the northern branch, known as the Poarta AlbƒÉ‚ÄìMidia NƒÉvodari Canal, with a length of , connecting Poarta AlbƒÉ and the Port of Midia, was built between 1983 and 1987. The canal was notorious as the site of labor camps in early 1950s Communist Romania, when at any given time, up to 20,000 political prisoners worked on its excavation. The total number of people used as a workforce for the entire period is unknown, with the total number of deaths estimated at several thousand. Geography The course of the canal follows mostly the course of the former river Carasu, originally a tributary of the Danube. Therefore, hydrographically it also has the function of conveying the runoff from a drainage basin to the Black Sea. The main branch extends from CernavodƒÉ on the Danube to Poarta AlbƒÉ. On this reach it goes near or through the settlements of CernavodƒÉ, Saligny, Mircea VodƒÉ, Medgidia, Castelu, and Poarta AlbƒÉ. On this reach the canal is joined on the north bank by tributaries (from west to east): Valea Ci»ômelei, Valea Planta»õiei, Agi Cabul, Castelu and Nisipari. On the south bank it is joined by tributaries (from west to east) Popa Nica and Medgidia. At Poarta AlbƒÉ the canal bifurcates into two branches. The main canal goes to the south, towards the Port of Constan»õa Sud Agigea. It passes near the settlements of Murfatlar, CumpƒÉna and Agigea. On its reach it is joined on the northeast bank by tributaries Valea SeacƒÉ and Lazu and on the southwest bank by the Siminoc, »òerplea, Pot√¢rnichea and Agigea. The northern branch, the Poarta AlbƒÉ‚ÄìMidia NƒÉvodari Canal, goes towards the Port of Midia. It passes near Nazarcea, Lumina, Ovidiu and NƒÉvodari. On its reach it is joined by tributaries Coco»ô, Nazarcea and Valea Ad√¢ncƒÉ. =Motivation= The main reasons for the building of the canal were to circumvent the Danube Delta, which is difficult to navigate, to shorten the distance to the Black Sea, and several issues related to the loading and unloading of ships.Nicolas Spulber, \\"The Danube ‚Äì Black Sea Canal and the Russian Control over the Danube\\", in Economic Geography, vol. 30, no.3 (July 1954), pp. 236‚Äì245 In its delta, the Danube is divided into three main branches, none of which is suited to optimal navigation: the Chilia branch is the deepest, but its mouths were not stable, which made navigation dangerous; the Sulina branch is not deep enough for maritime ships and it also used to be isolated from the railroad system; the Sf√¢ntu Gheorghe branch is shallow and sinuous. At the time when the decision to build the canal was taken, it was officially announced that these works would also serve a secondary purpose, that of land reclamation, with the drainage of marshes in the area. Also during the construction period, the Danube‚ÄìBlack Sea Canal was advertised as a fast and direct connection between the Soviet Volga‚ÄìDon Canal and Central Europe. =Dimensions= Danube ‚Äì Black Sea Canal The main branch reduces the distance by boat from Constan»õa to CernavodƒÉ by ca. .Tibor Iv√°n Berend, An Economic History of Twentieth-Century Europe, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 2006, pp. 155‚Äì156Adrian Cioroianu, Pe umerii lui Marx.

The structure is bound by four locks (in CernavodƒÉ and Agigea, and in Ovidiu and Midia, respectively). In its final phase, the canal took over nine years to construct; of soil were excavated (greater than the amount involved in building the Panama and Suez canals),David Turnock, \\"The Danube ‚Äì Black Sea Canal and its impact on Southern Romania\\", in Geo Journal 12:1 (1986), pp.65‚Äì79 and of concrete were used for the locks and support walls. History =Precedents= The earliest plans for building this canal were drawn in the late 1830s. The Treaty of Adrianopol (September 14, 1829) canceled the trade monopoly of the Ottoman Empire in the Danubian Principalities of Wallachia and Moldavia, allowing these countries to build their own fleets by 1834. Both Romanian and non-Romanian ships used mostly the Danube port cities of BrƒÉila and Gala»õi, which saw an economic boom. But there were a number of barriers to this trade: the Ottomans controlled the navigation regime on the Danube, while the Russian Empire controlled access to the Black Sea in the Danube Delta, and there was little the Danubian Principalities could do to rectify this situation. Both countries welcomed the Austrian Empire's 1834 decision, endorsed by Count Istv√°n Sz√©chenyi, to extend the route of the first pyroscaphe navigation company to the maritime Danube. The Austrian initiative was received unpleasantly by the Russians, who considered their trade through Odessa and ports in the Crimea threatened by the development of BrƒÉila and Gala»õi. Without resolving to direct measures, the Russian Empire, who controlled the Sulina branch, started to show rigidity, instituting on February 7, 1836 a compulsory quarantine on the island of Letea, collecting taxes to cover the Russian financial deficit, and by not performing maintenance for the navigation on the Sulina branch to remove the continuous deposits of sand.Petrescu, pp. 136‚Äì137 This gave the Austrians the idea to dig a canal to connect the Danube with the Black Sea at the shortest point before the Delta, between Rasova or CernavodƒÉ (Bogaz K√∂i) and Constan»õa (K√ºstendjie), and a parallel railway. The Austrian project, however, was rejected by the Ottoman Porte. Western diplomats and newspapers accused the Russian government that through bribing and intimidation, it determined the Ottoman officials to reject the proposal of Szechenyi's company. In 1839, Sz√©chenyi got the approval of his and Ottoman governments to ensure the transport of goods and people without getting to Sulina by a transshipment on dry land. Carts and coaches made a 7‚Äì8 hour trip from CernavodƒÉ to Constan»õa, where people and goods were boarding other ships for Istanbul. The enterprise was scrapped after 4 years due to non-profitability because of a low number of passengers, high cost of transport, and poor conditions of accosting in the unfit roadstead of the port of Constan»õa.Petrescu, p. 138 In its place, a new BrƒÉila‚ÄìIstanbul route was established. However, by 1844, the depth of the Sulina branch had decreased to 7‚Äì9 feet, from 13‚Äì14 feet in 1836, due to lack of dredging by the Russian authorities which controlled the passage. The Austrian government made a new attempt to cut a canal, sending the military engineer Colonel Baron Karl von Bigaro to prospect the land. But the idea had to be abandoned again due to technical problem, first of all due to the unfitness of the port of Constan»õa for large international trade.Petrescu, pp. 138‚Äì139 In 1850, the Moldavian scholar Ion Ionescu de la Brad proposed yet another project, supported by Ion Ghica and by the Scottish diplomat David Urquhart, the secretary of the United Kingdom's Embassy in the Ottoman Empire. Ghica lobbied Brad's project to Ahmed Vefik, who gave a negative response for fear of provoking Russia.Petrescu, p. 139 The Crimean War of 1854‚Äì1856, added a military and strategical dimension for this plan. The British and French allies landed at Varna in the summer of 1854, followed by the withdrawal of Russian troops from Wallachia and Moldavia and the advancement of Ottoman and Austrian ones. In 1855, the French government put forward an initiative, and the Ottomans approved it, for the cheapest solution: build a strategic road between CernavodƒÉ and Constan»õa. Engineer Charles Lalanne was put in charge of these works, that started in the summer of 1855 and were finished by the year's end. According to the newspaper Zimbrul of Ia»ôi, the work was performed by 300 physically strong men of moderate character selected in Moldavia and Wallachia.Petrescu, pp. 139‚Äì140 The building of the road did not eliminate, however, the need for a canal, and the Austrian government renewed its persuading efforts. According to Gazeta de Transilvania in July 1855, Baron Karl Ludwig von Bruck, the Austrian Finance Minister, founded a stock company to build the desired canal. According to an article in Zimbrul on July 23, 1855, the project was of interest to Britain, the French Empire and the Austrian Empire, who were asking the Ottoman government to allot the concession of the canal and the fitting of the port of Constan»õa to a consortium under the direction of the three countries. The Ottomans were to lease a league of land on each side of the canal for 99 years, where colonist could be settled. Goods were to travel freely, with ships having to pay only a per tone tax, significantly lower than the one on the Sulina branch. According to the newspaper Steaua DunƒÉrii from January 24, 1856, the Sultan issued a firman to the Anglo-French‚ÄìAustrian consortium Wilson‚ÄìMorny‚ÄìBreda, represented by Forbes Campbell, authorizing it to build the canal which was to be called Abdul Medjid. The 12 articles of the Concession Act were published in Bukurester Deutsche Zeitung. The construction plans for the canal took a different turn with the signing of the Treaty of Paris on March 30, 1856, ending the war. Russia ceded the Danube mouths to the Ottomans and southern Bessarabia (lately organised as the Cahul, Bolgrad and Ismail counties) to their vassal, Moldavia. The freedom of international navigation on the Danube was restored; passage taxes were canceled, police and quarantine rules were simplified; and the European Commission of the Danube was established, with representatives of seven powers: Britain, France, Austria, Russia, the Ottoman Empire, the Kingdom of Prussia, and the Kingdom of Sardinia. The commission was responsible for the clearing of the Danube mouths from deposits of the river, and when necessary with clearing natural barriers, with the goal of ensuring of good conditions for navigation. The effect was that Austria, Britain, and France changed their attitude to the project for a Danube‚ÄìBlack Sea canal. The newspaper Zimbrul announced on May 25, 1856 that the plan for building the canal was abandoned; instead a railroad line between CernavodƒÉ and Constan»õa was to be built. After two and a half years of construction, the line was inaugurated on October 4, 1860.Petrescu, p. 141 Following the opening of the line, goods were easily and inexpensively transported from Constan»õa by rail, so plans for a canal were again abandoned. As the United Principalities of Moldavia and Wallachia (1859) remained formally Ottoman vassals, and moreover Dobruja was directly administered by the Ottomans, the idea to build the canal was not of interest to Romanians then. But following the Russo-Turkish War of 1877‚Äì1878, Romania acquired formal independence, lost again southern Bessarabia to Russia, but gained Dobruja. The idea to build a canal became a national issue, which could promote Romania's international trade. However, in the following years the development of trade was concentrated mainly on the Sulina Canal. Another project was consequently rejected by King Carol I after consultations with Grigore Antipa. During World War I, Austro-Hungarian authorities taking part in the occupation of southern Romania proposed a canal from CernavodƒÉ to Constan»õa, passing through Murfatlar, of which 10 miles between CernavodƒÉ and Murfatlar would be in a tunnel and the rest of 27 miles would be in the open. In 1927, the Romanian engineer Jean Stoenescu-DunƒÉre drafted a new set of plans. Afterwards, because of the Great Depression, World War II, and political turmoil in Romania (see Romania during World War II), construction did not start until 1949, after the establishment of the Romanian Communist regime. =First phase of construction (1949‚Äì1953)= 1951 postage stamp (overprinted in 1952 following the monetary reform) announcing the canal would be ready in 1955 The idea of starting the construction of the Danube‚ÄìBlack Sea Canal seems to have been suggested to Romanian leader Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej by Soviet leader Joseph Stalin during a visit to the Moscow Kremlin in 1948. Gheorghiu-Dej's chief of staff stated that Stalin indicated the canal as a means of getting rid of the rich peasants and of the so-called \\"enemies of the people\\" and promised support to the authorities in identifying the people hostile to the regime and by providing construction equipment for the canal. He also stated that Gheorghiu-Dej was not convinced by Stalin's recommendations, suspecting that the canal was actually part of the Soviet Union's expansion strategy.Valentin Hossu-Longin, \\"Procesul Canalului Mor»õii\\" (\\"The Trial of the Death Canal\\") ‚Äì in Ziua, March 11, 2006 Archived from the original on January 21, 2008Adrian Bucurescu ‚Äì Tragicul Canal DunƒÉre ‚Äì Marea NeagrƒÉ ‚Äì Rom√¢nia LiberƒÉ, March 12, 2010 It has since been found out that Stalin's initiative was based on a secret study, commissioned in 1947‚Äì1948, which recommended building a Soviet submarine base at the Port of Midia, which was suitable due to its proximity to the Bosphorus and because of the rocky foundation. On May 25, 1949, the Politburo of the Central Committee of the Romanian Workers' Party was presented a report by Gheorghiu-Dej on the projected construction of a canal linking the Danube and the Black Sea and on the economic and cultural development of the neighboring area. Estimating that this important construction was an important component of the construction of socialism in Romania, the Politburo recommended that the project be submitted to the Council of Ministers for the approval of the immediate start of the preparatory work for the construction of the canal. On the same day Gheorghiu- Dej, at that time first vice-president of the Council of Ministers, presented his proposal to the council, presided by Petru Groza, which approved it immediately.Roxana Roseti ‚Äì Canalul DunƒÉre-Marea NeagrƒÉ.

Banners with this slogan were set up in all construction sites of the canal. In October 1949, the authorities established a General Directorate to oversee both the works and the penal facilities, answering directly to the national leadership. Its first head was Gheorghe Hossu a former mechanic and tractor driver who had been promoted first-secretary of the Romanian Worker's party in Tulcea County and administrator of the State Fisheries. He was replaced in 1951 by Meyer Gr√ºnberg, in turn replaced by Mihail Povstanschi under the name of Vasile PosteucƒÉ, who held the position from 1952 to 1953.Gabriel StegƒÉrescu ‚Äì Paradoxurile istoriei: √én Rom√¢nia stalinistƒÉ, un spion rus furƒÉ identitatea unui legionar ‚Äì Historia According to historian Adrian Cioroianu, all three were insufficiently trained for the task they were required to accomplish. By 1952, the Directorate came under the direct supervision of the Internal Affairs Ministry, and the Securitate was allowed direct intervention on the construction site. On July 18, 1953, the project came to a discreet haltTismƒÉneanu, pp. 139, 300 (according to some sources, the closure had been ordered by Stalin himself, as early as 1952). From 1959 he works built between 1949 and 1953 were used for irrigation as part of the Mircea VodƒÉ irrigation complex, later developed into the Carasu irrigation system. Forced labor and repression Map of forced labor camps along the Danube‚ÄìBlack Sea Canal building site Prison camps sprang up all along the projected canal route in the summer of 1949 and were quickly filled with political prisoners brought from jails from throughout the country. These first arrivals were soon joined by newly arrested people who were sent to the canal in ever increasing numbers. By 1950 the forced labor camps set up along the length of the planned canal were filled to capacity; that year alone, up to 15,000 prisoners were held in those camps. Comisia Preziden≈£ialƒÉ pentru Analiza Dictaturii Comuniste din Rom√¢nia: Raport Final / ed.: Vladimir TismƒÉneanu, Dorin Dobrincu, Cristian Vasile, Bucure»ôti: Humanitas, 2007, , pp. 253-261 By 1953, the number of prisoners had swelled to 20,193, though older estimates claimed figures as high as 60,000\\"Unfinished Canal\\", in Time, August 24, 1953 (other estimates asserted 100,000 or 40,000 for the entire period). British historian and New York University professor Tony Judt claimed in his book, Postwar: A History of Europe Since 1945, that, overall, one million Romanians had been imprisoned in various prisons and labor camps, including those on the path of the canal. The construction effort surpassed the resources available to the Romanian economy in the 1950s. The canal was assigned inferior machinery, part of which had already been used on the Soviet Volga‚ÄìDon Canal, and building had to rely on primitive techniques (most work appears to have been carried out using shovels and pickaxes, which was especially hard in the rocky terrain of Northern Dobruja). Detainees were allocated to brigades, usually run by common criminals, which were encouraged to use violence against their subordinates. In parallel, the region's industrialization, destined to assist in the building effort, was never accomplished. Sums allocated for prisoners' health, hygiene and nutrition declined dramatically over the years. Food rations were kept to a minimum, and prisoners would often resort to hunting mice and other small animals, or even consuming grass in an attempt to supplement their diet. The prisoners were dispossessed farmers who had attempted to resist collectivization, former activists of the National Peasants' Party, the National Liberal Party, the Romanian Social Democratic Party, and the fascist Iron Guard, Zionist Jews, as well as Orthodox and Catholic priests.Joseph Gordon, Eastern Europe: Romania (1954), pp. 299‚Äì301, at the American Jewish Committee The canal was referred to as the \\"graveyard of the Romanian bourgeoisie\\" by the Communist authorities,The Memorial of the Victims of Communism and of the Resistance , page for Room 17, Forced Labor and the physical elimination of undesirable social classes was one of its most significant goals.TismƒÉneanu, p. 36 The Presidential Commission for the Study of the Communist Dictatorship in Romania presented an estimate of several thousand deaths among the political prisoners used in the project, significantly higher than 656 officially recorded by an official report from 1968. Journalist Anne Applebaum had previously claimed that over 200,000 had died in its construction, as a result of exposure, unsafe equipment, malnutrition, accidents, tuberculosis and other diseases, over-work, etc., while political analyst Vladimir Socor had estimated the number of deaths to be \\"considerably in excess of 10,000\\". As such, the project became known as The Death Canal (Canalul Mor»õii). It has also been called \\"a cesspool of immense human suffering and mortality\\".Joseph Rothschild, Nancy Meriwether Wingfield, Return to diversity: A Political History of East Central Europe Since World War II, Oxford University Press, New York, 1999, p. 161 In parallel, authorities left aside sectors of employment for skilled workers, kept in strict isolation from all others, they were attracted to the site with exceptional salaries (over 5,000 lei per month), as well as for young people drafted into the Romanian Army and whose files indicated \\"unhealthy origins\\" (a middle-class family background). Their numbers fluctuated greatly (regular employees went from 13,200 in 1950 to 15,000 in 1951, to as little as 7,000 in early 1952, and again to 12,500 later in that year). At the same time, facilities meant to accommodate the projected influx of labor (including homes available on credit) were never actually completed. This was overlooked by the propaganda machine, which furnished Stakhanovite stories instead, according to which work quotas were surpassed by as much as 170%.Cristina Arvatu, Ilarion »öiu, \\"Basmele Canalului\\" (\\"Fairy Tales of the Canal\\") , in Jurnalul Na»õional, September 26, 2006 Authorities also made the claim that the construction site was offering training to previously unskilled workers (as many as 10,000 in one official communiqu√©). After the cessation of works, in 1953, the canal camps remained in existence for another year, and their prisoners progressively relocated, to similar conditions at other work sites in Northern Dobruja. Penal facilities on the canal site were shut down in mid-1954. Trial Blame for the debilitating and unsuccessful works was eventually placed on a group of alleged conspirators, who were indicted in a show trial in late 1952 on trumped-up charges of espionage, fraud, and sabotage. The inquiry was orchestrated by Iosif Chi»ôinevschi. Three people were executed (the engine driver Nichita Dumitrescu, and the engineers Aurel Rozei-Rozenberg and Nicolae Vasilescu-Colorado); others were imprisoned for various terms.

In official propaganda, where the 1950s precedent was no longer mentioned, the canal was referred to as the Blue Highway (Magistrala AlbastrƒÉ). New and large machinery, produced inside Romania, was introduced to the site. The southern arm was completed in May 1984, with the northern arm being inaugurated in October 1987. The cost of building the canal is estimated to be around 2 billion dollars, and was supposed to be recovered in 50 years. However, as of 2005, it has a yearly income of only a little over 3 million euros.Marian Cosor, \\"Canalul DunƒÉre-Marea NeagrƒÉ √Æ»ôi va scoate banii √Æn 633 de ani\\" (\\"The Danube ‚Äì Black Sea Canal Will Absorb Its Construction Cost in 633 Years\\") , on Radio Constan»õa, May 26, 2005 In art For much of the 1950s, the Danube‚ÄìBlack Sea Canal was celebrated in agitprop literature (notably, in Geo Bogza's 1950 reportage √énceputul epopeii, \\"The Beginning of the Epic\\", and in Petru Dumitriu's Drum fƒÉrƒÉ pulbere, \\"Dustless Road\\"), music (Leon Klepper's symphonic poem DunƒÉrea se varsƒÉ √Æn mare, \\"The Danube Flows to the Sea\\"), and film (Ion Bostan's 1951 Canalul DunƒÉre-Marea NeagrƒÉ, o construc»õie a pƒÉcii ‚Äì \\"The Danube‚ÄìBlack Sea Canal, a Construction of Peace\\"). During the 1980s, the song \\"Magistrala AlbastrƒÉ\\" (\\"The Blue Freeway\\"), performed by Dan SpƒÉtaru and Mirabela Dauer and using the Canal as its setting, was frequently broadcast in official and semi-official contexts. During the period of liberalization preceding the July Theses, literature was allowed to make several references to the Canal's penitentiary history. Examples include Marin Preda's Cel mai iubit dintre pƒÉm√¢nteni and, most likely, Eugen Barbu's Principele (by means of an allegory, set during the 18th century Phanariote rules).Dennis Deletant, Ceau»ôescu and the Securitate: Coercion and Dissent in Romania, 1965‚Äì1989, M.E.

Written, produced and directed by Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger, the film stars David Niven, Roger Livesey, Raymond Massey, Kim Hunter and Marius Goring. The film was originally released in the United States under the title Stairway to Heaven, which derived from the film's most prominent special effect: a broad escalator linking Earth to the afterlife. The decision to film the scenes of the Other World in black and white added to the complications. They were filmed in Three-strip Technicolor, but colour was not added during printing, giving a pearly hue to the black- and-white shots, a process cited in the screen credits as \\"Colour and Dye- Monochrome Processed in Technicolor\\". This reversed the effect in The Wizard of Oz. Photographic dissolves between \\"Technicolor Dye-Monochrome\\" (the Other World) and Three-Strip Technicolor (Earth) are used several times during the film. In 1999, A Matter of Life and Death was placed 20th on the British Film Institute's list of Best 100 British films. In 2004, a poll by the magazine Total Film of 25 film critics named A Matter of Life and Death the second greatest British film ever made, behind Get Carter.\\"Get Carter tops British film poll.\\" BBC News, 3 October 2004. Retrieved: 22 June 2012. It ranked 90th among critics, and 322nd among directors, in the 2012 Sight & Sound polls of the greatest films ever made. Plot On 2 May 1945, Squadron Leader Peter Carter, an RAF pilot, is flying a badly damaged and burning Lancaster bomber over the English Channel, after a mission over Germany. Carter is expecting to die, after ordering his crew to bail out, without revealing to them that his own parachute has been destroyed. The only radio operator receiving him is June, at a USAAF base on the coast of England. For a few minutes Carter converses with June, before jumping from the Lancaster without a parachute. Peter should have died at that point, but Conductor 71, the guide sent to escort him to the Other World, misses him in the thick fog over the English Channel. The airman wakes up on a beach near June's base. At first, he assumes he is in the afterlife but, when a de Havilland Mosquito flies low overhead, discovers to his bewilderment that he is still alive. Peter meets June cycling back to her quarters after her night shift, and they fall in love. Conductor 71 (a French aristocrat guillotined in the Revolution) stops time to explain the situation, urging Peter to accept his death and accompany him to the Other World, but Peter demands an appeal. While Conductor 71 consults his superiors, Peter continues to live. Conductor 71 returns and informs him that he has been granted his appeal and has three days to prepare his case. He can choose a defence counsel from among all the people who have ever died, but he has difficulty picking one. Peter's visions are diagnosed by June's fascinated friend Doctor Reeves as a symptom of a brain injury‚Äîchronic adhesive arachnoiditis from a slight concussion two years earlier‚Äîand he is scheduled for surgery. Reeves is killed in a motorcycle accident while trying to find the ambulance that is to take Peter to the hospital. Reeves' death allows him to act as Peter's counsel. Reeves argues that, through no fault of his own, his client was given additional time on Earth and that, during that time, he has fallen in love and now has an earthly commitment that should take precedence over the afterlife's claim on him. The matter comes to a head‚Äîin parallel with Peter's brain surgery‚Äîbefore a celestial court; the camera zooms out from an amphitheatre to reveal that it is as large as a spiral galaxy. The prosecutor is American Abraham Farlan, who hates the British for making him the first casualty of the American Revolutionary War. Reeves challenges the composition of the jury, which is made up of representatives who are prejudiced against the British. In fairness, the jury is replaced by a multicultural mixture of modern Americans whose origins are as varied as those they replace. Reeves and Farlan both make comparisons with the other's nationality to support their positions. In the end, Reeves has June take the stand (Conductor 71 makes her fall asleep in the real world so she can testify) and prove that she genuinely loves Peter by telling her that the only way to save his life is to take his place, whereupon she steps onto the stairway to the Other World without hesitation and is carried away, leaving Peter behind. The stairway comes to an abrupt halt and June rushes back to Peter's open arms. As Reeves triumphantly explains, \\"... nothing is stronger than the law in the universe, but on Earth, nothing is stronger than love.\\" The jury rules in Peter's favour. The Judge shows Reeves and Farlan the new lifespan granted to the defendant; Reeves calls it \\"very generous\\", and Farlan jokingly complains, then agrees to it. The two then engage in supportive banter with one another, and against the stern Chief Recorder, who protests against the breach of law. The scene then shifts to the operating room, where the surgeon declares the operation a success.

Cast notes: Goring was offered the role of the Conductor, but insisted that he wanted to play Peter instead; however, Powell and Pressburger were set on Niven playing the part, and eventually told Goring that the Conductor was his only choice: if he turned it down, they would approach Peter Ustinov to play the part.Powell 1986, p. 489 Powell and Pressburger went to Hollywood to cast the role of June with no possible actress in mind except, possibly, Betty Field, who was in a play in New York at the time. The suggestion of Kim Hunter came from Alfred Hitchcock, who had recently used her to read lines from behind the camera for Ingrid Bergman's screen test for Spellbound. Hunter had stage experience and had been under contract to David O. Selznick for two years. Powell and Pressburger decided that she was right for the part almost immediately on their first meeting, and arranged with Selznick to use her.Powell 1986, pp. 519-20, 524-25 Production A Matter of Life and Death was filmed at D&P; Studios and Denham Studios in Denham, Buckinghamshire, England, and on locations in Devon and Surrey. The beach scene was shot at Saunton Sands in Devon, and the village seen in the camera obscura was Shere in Surrey.

A Matter of Life and Death had an extensive pre-production period due to the complexity of the production: The huge escalator linking this world with the other, called \\"Operation Ethel\\" by the firm of engineers who constructed it under the aegis of the London Passenger Transport Board, took three months to make and cost ¬£3,000, . \\"Ethel\\" had 106 steps, each wide, and was driven by a 12 hp engine.

There was a nine-month wait for film stock and Technicolor cameras because they were being used by the US Army to make training films.Powell 1986 The decision to film the scenes of the \\"other world\\" in black and white added to the complications. Where the \\"other world\\" is seen, it was filmed in Three- Strip Technicolor, but no colour was added during the printing process, giving a pearly hue to the black and white shots, a process cited in the screen credits as \\"Colour and Dye-Monochrome Processed in Technicolor\\". (As Conductor 71 remarks during an early transition, \\"One is starved for Technicolor up there.\\") Other sequences also presented challenges, such as the stopped-action table-tennis game for which Hunter and Livesey were trained by champions Alan Brooke and Viktor Barna; the scene where Carter washes up on the beach, the first scene filmed, where cinematographer Jack Cardiff fogged up the camera lens with his breath to create the look he wanted; and the long, 25-minute trial sequence, which required a set with a long by high backcloth.Stafford, Jeff. \\"Article: 'A Matter of Life and Death' (1946).\\" TCM.com.

Analysis =The title= According to Powell in his A Life in Movies, the United States was the only market in which the film's name was changed, except that most European countries used \\"A Question of Life and Death\\" rather than \\"A Matter of Life and Death\\". The American title was the idea of Arthur Krim and Robert Benjamin, two lawyers just starting out in the film business, who would be marketing the film in the US, and insisted that no film had ever done well there with the word \\"death\\" in the title. When Pressburger countered with the hit film Death Takes a Holiday, their response was to point out that it succeeded because the very fact that Death was on holiday meant that there would be no death in the film.Powell 1986, pp. 486-87.Stein, Ruthe. \\"Michael Powell's 'Age of Consent' on DVD.\\" SFGate.com, 11 January 2009. Retrieved: 11 January 2009. = The question of Carter's visions = The film's narrative does not clarify whether Carter's visions are real, or hallucinatory. The fact that the same actor plays the celestial judge and the brain surgeon tends to indicate that they are a hallucination. To ensure that Carter's symptoms ‚Äì including his visions ‚Äì were consistent with the diagnosis and treatment depicted, the filmmakers read and integrated a significant amount of medical research, according to Diane Broadbent Friedman.Friedman, Diane Broadbent. \\"A Matter of Fried Onions.\\" Seizure. Retrieved: 1 October 2009. Interpretations of Carter's visions of the \\"other world\\" as supernatural, within the context of the film's narrative, may be supported by elements of the plot. A key question, which is alluded to in the film's dialogue, concerns the unlikehood of Carter surviving the fall from his aircraft. (Nevertheless, in a small number of historical cases, people have survived falling from a great height, without suffering serious injury or permanent disability.) Likewise, two scenes set in the other world take place without Carter, namely Trubshawe's arrival, and the prelude to the start of the trial. A third plot device, regarding a borrowed book, also seems to hint that the other world is real. However, these devices could all be explained as retrospective inventions of Carter's mind, while he is unconscious. =The other world= The producers took pains never to refer to \\"the other world\\" as Heaven, as they felt that was restrictive. However, in the first minutes of the film, a very young Richard Attenborough appears as a dead airman registering in the \\"other world\\" and asking: \\"It's heaven, isn't it?\\" This is followed by the \\"other world\\" female attendant commenting to Flying Officer Trubshawe that some people might think it would be \\"heaven to be a clerk\\". An introductory title screen ‚Äì repeated as the Foreword to the 1946 novelisation by Eric Warman ‚Äì contains an explicit statement, however: \\"This is the story of two worlds, the one we know and another which exists only in the mind of a young airman whose life and imagination have been violently shaped by war\\", but goes on to say \\"Any resemblance to any other world known or unknown is purely coincidental\\". The architecture of the other world is noticeably modernist. It features a vast and open plan, with huge circular observation holes, beneath which the clouds of Earth can be seen.

The film's amphitheatre court scene was rendered by BT in a TV advertisement c. 2002 as a metaphor for communication technology, especially the Internet. =The identities and significance of the statues= Lining the escalator are large statues (created by Eric Aumonier) of historically prominent men. A list of the names of the statues appears in Michael Powell's handwriting on pages 49 and 50 of the script.Friedman 2008, p. 206. They are: *Alexander the Great *Ludwig van Beethoven *Fr√©d√©ric Chopin *Confucius *Benjamin Franklin *Julius Caesar *Abraham Lincoln *Michelangelo *MuhammadOnly the base of the statue of Muhammad can be seen. *Moses *Bartolom√© Murillo *Plato *Rembrandt van Rijn *Cardinal Richelieu (mentioned) *William Shakespeare (mentioned) *King Solomon *Jonathan Swift Many of these have in common a characteristic beyond their prominence in politics, art and philosophy: in 1945 most were believed to have had epilepsy - as did John Bunyan, who is seen in the film serving as the conductor for Dr. Reeves.Friedman 2008, p. 209. =Anglo-American relations= The film was originally suggested by a British government department to improve relations between the Americans in the UK and the British public, following Powell and Pressburger's contributions to this sphere in A Canterbury Tale two years earlier, though neither film received any government funding nor input on plot or production. There was a degree of public hostility towards American servicemen stationed in the UK prior to the D-Day invasion of Europe. They were viewed by some as latecomers to the war and as \\"overpaid, oversexed and over here\\" by a public that had suffered three years of bombing and rationing, with many of their own men fighting abroad. The premise of the film is a simple inversion: the British pilot gets the pretty American woman rather than the other way round, and the only national bigotry ‚Äì against the British ‚Äì is voiced by the first American casualty of the Revolutionary War. Raymond Massey, portraying an American, was a Canadian national at the time the film was made, but became a naturalised American citizen afterward.Desowitz, Bill (31 October 1999) \\"Resurrecting a Cosmic Fantasy of Love and Death\\" The New York Times =Chess= David Niven was a fan of chess. Peter and June play chess while they await Dr Reeves. Then Conductor 71 \\"borrows\\" a chess book Peter has accidentally knocked off the table, Alekhine's My Best Games of Chess. After the trial is won, Conductor 71 throws the book from the stairway; June finds it in his jacket pocket \\"to serve the 'was it a hallucination or did it really happen?' motif of the film\\", according to Mig Greengard. He also noted, \\"Lots of chess in movies past and present, but I can't recall another prominent appearance of a real chess book\\". Ian Christie wrote, \\"the chess plot may also be of more significance than at first appears. The Conductor tries to tempt Peter by offering him the opportunity to pit his skill against the great chess masters; and he 'borrows' Alekhine's famous book, only to return it in an extraordinary transitional shot which introduces the final sequence of Peter waking up in hospital. As a token of Peter's life, the book tumbles from one photographic world to another within the same shot\\". A chess game as a metaphor for the struggle for life eleven years before Bergman's The Seventh Seal: to Powell and Pressburger the idea may have been suggested by the death of Alekhine in 1946, the very year in which they made this film. Conductor 71 continually reminds Peter Carter that he will soon meet the chess master Philidor.

Their song \\"Walking on Sunshine\\" was an international hit in 1985. In 1997 the band won the Eurovision Song Contest for the United Kingdom with the song \\"Love Shine a Light\\". Early life Leskanich was born in Topeka, Kansas. Her father was a colonel in the United States Air Force and Vietnam veteran, and Katrina and her five siblings (four sisters and one brother) moved frequently as children. The family arrived in the United Kingdom in 1976. Early career Mama's Cookin', a pop cover band hailing from Feltwell, Norfolk, England, was founded in 1978. It featured Leskanich on vocals and keyboards, her then-boyfriend (and fellow American) Vince de la Cruz on vocals and lead guitar, and Marcos de la Cruz (aka \\"Dr. Sod\\" of \\"Dr. Sod's Backyard Landscaping Services\\" in Orange County, California) on drums. By late 1980, Alex Cooper had joined the band on drums, with Bob Jakins on bass. Mama's Cookin' proceeded to gig steadily in England over the next two years, specialising in covers of songs by American acts. In 1981, singer/songwriter/guitarist Kimberley Rew joined Mama's Cookin', and the five- piece group was quickly renamed The Waves after a band Rew and Cooper had been in together in the mid-1970s. The Waves were initially fronted by Rew. However, over the first year of the Waves' existence, Rew began to write material for Leskanich to sing, and she was soon the primary vocalist. The Waves made their initial recorded appearances on a 1982 single (\\"Nightmare\\"/\\"Hey, War Pig!\\"); both tracks were included on the 1982 Rew solo album called The Bible of Bop. The Waves then issued their debut EP, Shock Horror, later in 1982. Around this time, bassist Jakins left the band. He was not replaced, as de la Cruz took over on bass and the band was rechristened Katrina and the Waves. Katrina and the Waves =Early Canadian success (1983‚Äì84)= In early 1983, the fledgling band recorded‚Äîat their own expense‚Äîan LP of their original material designed to be sold at gigs. Rew wrote all the songs on this LP, while Leskanich sang eight of the album's ten tracks. The LP was shopped around to various labels, but only Attic Records in Canada responded with an offer. Consequently, although they were based in England, Katrina and The Waves' first album Walking on Sunshine was released only in Canada. The album garnered enough critical attention and radio play to merit a Canadian tour. In 1984, the group released a follow-up album in Canada (Katrina and the Waves 2), with Leskanich now handling all the lead vocals. Also in 1984, their song \\"Going Down to Liverpool\\" was covered by The Bangles, which added to their profile. With the group building a fan base with their recordings and extensive touring, major label interest began to build, and Katrina and the Waves signed an international deal with Capitol Records in 1985. =\\"Walking on Sunshine\\" and international success (1985‚Äì89)= The band re-recorded, remixed, or overdubbed 10 songs from their earlier Canadian releases to create their self-titled international debut album in 1985. The Katrina and the Waves album was a substantial critical and commercial success, and the group had a worldwide hit with the song \\"Walking on Sunshine,\\" (No. 9 US, No. 8 UK, a completely re-recorded, and substantially rearranged version of the song when compared to its initial 1983 Canada-only release). A Grammy award nomination for \\"Best New Artist\\" followed, as did constant touring, both of which helped to spur sales of new releases. A follow-up single to \\"Walking on Sunshine\\" called \\"Do You Want Crying\\" (written by de la Cruz) also became a top 40 US hit, reaching No. 37 in the late summer of 1985. The band's follow- up album, entitled Waves, did not meet with the same measure of success as the first album. The album did spin off a minor UK and US hit in the form of the Rew-penned \\"Is That It?\\" (No. 70 US, No. 82 UK). \\"Sun Street\\" (a de la Cruz composition) was a UK Top 30 hit in 1986. However, Capitol dropped the band after the Waves album failed to meet expectations. The band subsequently recorded a 1989 album for Capitol-distributed SBK Records called Break of Hearts, a harder, more rock-oriented effort than their previous releases. The album included \\"That's the Way\\", which reached No. 16 in the US. =Downturn, comeback, and breakup (1990‚Äì97)= Throughout the 1990s, Katrina and the Waves recorded fairly steadily, though most releases were available only in continental Europe and/or Canada. They also recorded the song \\"We Gotta Get Out of This Place\\" with Eric Burdon for the TV series \\"China Beach\\" in 1990. In 1997, after having somewhat faded into obscurity, the band won the Eurovision Song Contest 1997 for the United Kingdom with \\"Love Shine a Light\\". Reacting to the win, Leskanich said it was the second landslide victory in a week; the song won by a record points margin, and Tony Blair had won the 1997 British general election two days previously. The song won by a then-record margin of 70 points over the Irish runner-up.O'Connor, John Kennedy. The Eurovision Song Contest ‚Äì The Official History. Carlton Books, UK. 2007 The song went to No. 3 in the UK Singles Chart (becoming the band's biggest-ever hit) and Katrina and The Waves performed an unprecedented four weeks running on the BBC One TV show Top of the Pops. Katrina and the Waves broke up in 1999. Solo career After the Waves broke up in 1999, Leskanich launched a solo career. She released her first solo CD, Katrina Leskanich, through Universal Records in Britain in 2005. In 2005, Leskanich reflected on sharing her name with a hurricane that devastated the U.S. Gulf Coast in late August and early September of that year, after the name \\"Katrina and the Waves\\" appeared on numerous news television shows, headlines, and blog postings that were covering her namesake hurricane. When a New York Times reporter contacted her about this, she said: \\"The first time I opened the paper and saw 'Katrina kills 9,' it was a bit of a shock. ... I hope that the true spirit of 'Walking on Sunshine' will prevail. I would hate for the title to be tinged with sadness, and I will have to do my own part to help turn that around.\\" She also stated that she hoped that \\"Walking on Sunshine\\" would become an anthem for the Gulf Coast's recovery. To celebrate the 25th Anniversary of \\"Walking on Sunshine\\", Leskanich released her first live album The Live Album, in July 2010. The album includes both a live version and a blues version of \\"Walking on Sunshine\\". \\"I have performed 'Walking on Sunshine' for so many years in so many different countries that it's become the one constant in my life and the one thing I can count on to bring happiness to myself and others,\\" said Leskanich. In September 2010, Katrina re-released her solo album Turn The Tide with a couple of bonus tracks ‚Äì the club mix of \\"They Don't Know\\" and the Espirito mix of \\"Walking on Sunshine\\". In May 2011, Leskanich released an EP entitled Spiritualize. \\"In 1999 I wrote, collected and compiled some songs I thought would come together for an uplifting and spiritual type of album. I thought I'd try to make this a bit more personal,\\" said Leskanich. In 2013, Leskanich and her new band performed at festivals in the UK and Europe, including the San Ferm√≠n festival in Pamplona in Spain on Plaza del Castillo, and the Steinegg Festival in Italy. In 2014, Leskanich, a firm believer in animal rights, supported Wildlife Rocks with an acoustic performance. Other performers included Queen lead guitarist and founder of the Save Me organisation, Brian May. The event raised awareness for vital wildlife projects, and was attended by several members of Parliament. Leskanich released her second solo album, Blisland, which was inspired by the genre of music from her formative years. \\"I wanted to record an album that reflected my love of all the genres of music I grew up listening to, from Peter Frampton Live (sic) to Neil Young's Harvest. I fell in love with the South West of England; the beautiful beaches reminded me of California, and a little village called Blisland not only had a fantastic little pub but also gave me the perfect name for my new album.\\" In May 2017, Leskanich released her first compilation album, The Very Best of Katrina. In 2018, Leskanich released her first Christmas single, \\"I Can't Give You Anything but Love\\".

Galactokinase catalyzes the second step of the Leloir pathway, a metabolic pathway found in most organisms for the catabolism of Œ≤-D-galactose to glucose 1-phosphate. First isolated from mammalian liver, galactokinase has been studied extensively in yeast, archaea, plants, and humans. Structure Galactokinase is composed of two domains separated by a large cleft. The two regions are known as the N- and C-terminal domains, and the adenine ring of ATP binds in a hydrophobic pocket located at their interface. The N-terminal domain is marked by five strands of mixed beta-sheet and five alpha-helices, and the C-terminal domain is characterized by two layers of anti-parallel beta-sheets and six alpha-helices. Galactokinase does not belong to the sugar kinase family, but rather to a class of ATP-dependent enzymes known as the GHMP superfamily. GHMP is an abbreviation referring to its original members: galactokinase, homoserine kinase, mevalonate kinase, and phosphomevalonate kinase. Members of the GHMP superfamily have great three- dimensional similarity despite only ten to 20% sequence identity. These enzymes contain three well-conserved motifs (I, II, and III), the second of which is involved in nucleotide binding and has the sequence Pro-X-X-X-Gly- Leu-X-Ser-Ser-Ala. =Sugar specificity= Galactokinases across different species display a great diversity of substrate specificities. E. coli galactokinase can also phosphorylate 2-deoxy-D-galactose, 2-amino-deoxy-D- galactose, 3-deoxy-D-galactose and D-fucose. The enzyme cannot tolerate any C-4 modifications, but changes at the C-2 position of D-galactose do not interfere with enzyme function. Both human and rat galactokinases are also able to successfully phosphorylate 2-deoxy-D-galactose. Galactokinase from S. cerevisiae, on the other hand, is highly specific for D-galactose and cannot phosphorylate glucose, mannose, arabinose, fucose, lactose, galactitol, or 2-deoxy-D-galactose. Moreover, the kinetic properties of galactokinase also differ across species. The sugar specificity of galactokinases from different sources has been dramatically expanded through directed evolution and structure-based protein engineering. The corresponding broadly permissive sugar anomeric kinases serve as a cornerstone for in vitro and in vivo glycorandomization. Mechanism Recently, the roles of active site residues in human galactokinase have become understood. Asp-186 abstracts a proton from C1-OH of Œ±-D-galactose, and the resulting alkoxide nucleophile attacks the Œ≥-phosphorus of ATP. A phosphate group is transferred to the sugar, and Asp-186 may be deprotonated by water. Nearby Arg-37 stabilizes Asp-186 in its anionic form and has also been proven to be essential to galactokinase function in point mutation experiments. Both the aspartic acid and arginine active site residues are highly conserved among galactokinases. The likely galactokinase mechanism. The aspartate residue is stabilized in its anionic form by a nearby arginine residue. Crystal structure of galactokinase active site from Lactococcus lactis. Galactokinase is shown in green, phosphate in orange, and the residues responsible for binding the sugar ligand are shown in magenta: Arg-36, Glu-42, Asp-45, Asp-183, and Tyr-233. Arg-36 and Asp-183 of Lactococcus lactis galactokinase are analogous to Arg-37 and Asp-186 in human galactokinase. (From ) Biological function The Leloir pathway catalyzes the conversion of galactose to glucose. Galactose is found in dairy products, as well as in fruits and vegetables, and can be produced endogenously in the breakdown of glycoproteins and glycolipids. Three enzymes are required in the Leloir pathway: galactokinase, galactose-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase, and UDP-galactose 4-epimerase. Galactokinase catalyzes the first committed step of galactose catabolism, forming galactose 1-phosphate. Disease relevance Galactosemia, a rare metabolic disorder characterized by decreased ability to metabolize galactose, can be caused by a mutation in any of the three enzymes in the Leloir pathway. Galactokinase deficiency, also known as galactosemia type II, is a recessive metabolic disorder caused by a mutation in human galactokinase. About 20 mutations have been identified that cause galactosemia type II, the main symptom of which is early onset cataracts. In lens cells of the human eye, aldose reductase converts galactose to galactitol. As galactose is not being catabolized to glucose due to a galactokinase mutation, galactitol accumulates. This galactitol gradient across the lens cell membrane triggers the osmotic uptake of water, and the swelling and eventual apoptosis of lens cells ensues.

Phosphotransferase system The phosphotransferase system (PTS) is a complex group translocation system present in many bacteria. The PTS transports sugars (such as glucose, mannose, and mannitol) into the cell. The first step of this reaction is phosphorylation of the substrate via phosphotransferase during transport. In the case of glucose, the product of this phosphorylation is glucose-6-phosphate (Glc-6P). Due to the negative charge of the phosphate, this Glc-6P can no longer freely leave the cell. This is the first reaction of glycolysis, which degrades the sugar to pyruvate.

One theory states that Granada was looking to buy Seven's core, through it eventually owning 100% of Red Heart. Red Heart may have also eventually controlled Seven's news and soaps. This was a time when \\"content is king\\" was a popular idea. Australia's Broadcasting Services Act 1992 disallows foreign entities owning more than 15% of any TV station licence holder, but owning a company that provides a station with 100% of its content for 99% of its income is fine. (CanWest found another way around the law to own a majority stake of Network Ten). However, Granada decided to pull out of Red Heart when it realised it could make more money selling Australian programs to other Australian broadcasters than it would just supplying Seven. It has been rare to see Australian-made Granada programs on the screen.

It lived during the middle Miocene Epoch in Africa, Asia and the Caucasus. Description Platybelodon was very similar to Amebelodon, another closely related gomphothere genus. Due to the shape of the two lower teeth, like many gomphothere genera (such as Platybelodon, Archaeobelodon, Konobelodon, and Amebelodon) they are popularly known as \\"shovel tuskers\\". Palaeobiology Platybelodon was previously believed to have fed in the swampy areas of grassy savannas, using its teeth to shovel up aquatic and semi-aquatic vegetation. However, wear patterns on the teeth suggest that it used its lower tusks to strip bark from trees, and may have used the sharp incisors that formed the edge of the \\"shovel\\" more like a modern-day scythe, grasping branches with its trunk and rubbing them against the lower teeth to cut it from a tree.

The nucleus accumbens and the olfactory tubercle collectively form the ventral striatum. The ventral striatum and dorsal striatum collectively form the striatum, which is the main component of the basal ganglia.Nucleus Accumbens The dopaminergic neurons of the mesolimbic pathway project onto the GABAergic medium spiny neurons of the nucleus accumbens and olfactory tubercle. Figure 3: The ventral striatum and self-administration of amphetamine Each cerebral hemisphere has its own nucleus accumbens, which can be divided into two structures: the nucleus accumbens core and the nucleus accumbens shell. These substructures have different morphology and functions. Different NAcc subregions (core vs shell) and neuron subpopulations within each region (D1-type vs D2-type medium spiny neurons) are responsible for different cognitive functions. As a whole, the nucleus accumbens has a significant role in the cognitive processing of motivation, aversion, reward (i.e., incentive salience, pleasure, and positive reinforcement), and reinforcement learning (e.g., Pavlovian-instrumental transfer); hence, it has a significant role in addiction. In addition, part of the nucleus accumbens core is centrally involved in the induction of slow-wave sleep. The nucleus accumbens plays a lesser role in processing fear (a form of aversion), impulsivity, and the placebo effect. It is involved in the encoding of new motor programs as well.  Structure  The nucleus accumbens is an aggregate of neurons which is described as having an outer shell and an inner core. =Input= Major glutamatergic inputs to the nucleus accumbens include the prefrontal cortex (particularly the prelimbic cortex and infralimbic cortex), basolateral amygdala, ventral hippocampus, thalamic nuclei (specifically the midline thalamic nuclei and intralaminar nuclei of the thalamus), and glutamatergic projections from the ventral tegmental area. Figure 1: Glutamatergic afferents to the nucleus accumbens involved in addictive behavior The nucleus accumbens receives dopaminergic inputs from the ventral tegmental area (VTA), which connect via the mesolimbic pathway. The nucleus accumbens is often described as one part of a cortico-basal ganglia- thalamo-cortical loop. Dopaminergic inputs from the VTA modulate the activity of GABAergic neurons within the nucleus accumbens. These neurons are activated directly or indirectly by euphoriant drugs (e.g., amphetamine, opiates, etc.) and by participating in rewarding experiences (e.g., sex, music, exercise, etc.). Another major source of input comes from the CA1 and ventral subiculum of the hippocampus to the dorsomedial area of the nucleus accumbens. Slight depolarizations of cells in the nucleus accumbens correlates with positivity of the neurons of the hippocampus, making them more excitable. The correlated cells of these excited states of the medium spiny neurons in the nucleus accumbens are shared equally between the subiculum and CA1. The subiculum neurons are found to hyperpolarize (increase negativity) while the CA1 neurons \\"ripple\\" (fire > 50 Hz) in order to accomplish this priming. The nucleus accumbens is one of the few regions that receive histaminergic projections from the tuberomammillary nucleus (the sole source of histamine neurons in the brain). =Output= The output neurons of the nucleus accumbens send axonal projections to the basal ganglia and the ventral analog of the globus pallidus, known as the ventral pallidum (VP). The VP, in turn, projects to the medial dorsal nucleus of the dorsal thalamus, which projects to the prefrontal cortex as well as the striatum. Other efferents from the nucleus accumbens include connections with the tail of the ventral tegmental area, substantia nigra, and the reticular formation of the pons. =Shell= The nucleus accumbens shell (NAcc shell) is a substructure of the nucleus accumbens. The shell and core together form the entire nucleus accumbens. Location: The shell is the outer region of the nucleus accumbens, and ‚Äì unlike the core ‚Äì is considered to be part of the extended amygdala, located at its rostral pole. Cell types: Neurons in the nucleus accumbens are mostly medium spiny neurons (MSNs) containing mainly D1-type (i.e., DRD1 and DRD5) or D2-type (i.e., DRD2, DRD3, and DRD4) dopamine receptors. A subpopulation of MSNs contain both D1-type and D2-type receptors, with approximately 40% of striatal MSNs expressing both DRD1 and DRD2 mRNA. These mixed-type NAcc MSNs with both D1-type and D2-type receptors are mostly confined to the NAcc shell. The neurons in the shell, as compared to the core, have a lower density of dendritic spines, less terminal segments, and less branch segments than those in the core. The shell neurons project to the subcommissural part of the ventral pallidum as well as the ventral tegmental area and to extensive areas in the hypothalamus and extended amygdala. Function: The shell of the nucleus accumbens is involved in the cognitive processing of reward, including subjective \\"liking\\" reactions to certain pleasurable stimuli, motivational salience, and positive reinforcement. That NAcc shell has also been shown to mediate specific Pavlovian-instrumental transfer, a phenomenon in which a classically conditioned stimulus modifies operant behavior. A \\"hedonic hotspot\\" or pleasure center which is responsible for the pleasurable or \\"liking\\" component of some intrinsic rewards is also located in a small compartment within the medial NAcc shell. Addictive drugs have a larger effect on dopamine release in the shell than in the core. =Core= The nucleus accumbens core (NAcc core) is the inner substructure of the nucleus accumbens. Location: The nucleus accumbens core is part of the ventral striatum, located within the basal ganglia. Cell types: The core of the NAcc is made up mainly of medium spiny neurons containing mainly D1-type or D2-type dopamine receptors. The D1-type medium spiny neurons mediate reward-related cognitive processes, whereas the D2-type medium spiny neurons mediate aversion-related cognition. The neurons in the core, as compared to the neurons in the shell, have an increased density of dendritic spines, branch segments, and terminal segments. From the core, the neurons project to other sub-cortical areas such as the globus pallidus and the substantia nigra. GABA is one of the main neurotransmitters in the NAcc, and GABA receptors are also abundant. Function: The nucleus accumbens core is involved in the cognitive processing of motor function related to reward and reinforcement and the regulation of slow-wave sleep. Specifically, the core encodes new motor programs which facilitate the acquisition of a given reward in the future. The indirect pathway (i.e., D2-type) neurons in the NAcc core which co-express adenosine A2A receptors activation-dependently promote slow-wave sleep. The NAcc core has also been shown to mediate general Pavlovian-instrumental transfer, a phenomenon in which a classically conditioned stimulus modifies operant behavior. Cell types Approximately 95% of neurons in the NAcc are GABAergic medium spiny neurons (MSNs) which primarily express either D1-type or D2-type receptors; about 1‚Äì2% of the remaining neuronal types are large aspiny cholinergic interneurons and another 1‚Äì2% are GABAergic interneurons. Compared to the GABAergic MSNs in the shell, those in the core have an increased density of dendritic spines, branch segments, and terminal segments. From the core, the neurons project to other sub-cortical areas such as the globus pallidus and the substantia nigra. GABA is one of the main neurotransmitters in the NAcc, and GABA receptors are also abundant. These neurons are also the main projection or output neurons of the nucleus accumbens. Neurochemistry Some of the neurotransmitters, neuromodulators, and hormones that signal through receptors within the nucleus accumbens include: Dopamine: Dopamine is released into the nucleus accumbens following exposure to rewarding stimuli, including recreational drugs like substituted amphetamines, cocaine, nicotine and morphine. Phenethylamine and tyramine: Phenethylamine and tyramine are trace amines which are synthesized in neurons that express the aromatic amino acid hydroxylase (AADC) enzyme, which includes all dopaminergic neurons. Both compounds function as dopaminergic neuromodulators which regulate the reuptake and release of dopamine into the Nacc via interactions with VMAT2 and TAAR1 in the axon terminal of mesolimbic dopamine neurons. Glucocorticoids and dopamine: Glucocorticoid receptors are the only corticosteroid receptors in the nucleus accumbens shell. L-DOPA, steroids, and specifically glucocorticoids are currently known to be the only known endogenous compounds that can induce psychotic problems, so understanding the hormonal control over dopaminergic projections with regard to glucocorticoid receptors could lead to new treatments for psychotic symptoms. A recent study demonstrated that suppression of the glucocorticoid receptors led to a decrease in the release of dopamine, which may lead to future research involving anti-glucocorticoid drugs to potentially relieve psychotic symptoms. GABA: A recent study on rats that used GABA agonists and antagonists indicated that GABAA receptors in the NAcc shell have inhibitory control on turning behavior influenced by dopamine, and GABAB receptors have inhibitory control over turning behavior mediated by acetylcholine. Glutamate: Studies have shown that local blockade of glutamatergic NMDA receptors in the NAcc core impaired spatial learning. Another study demonstrated that both NMDA and AMPA (both glutamate receptors) play important roles in regulating instrumental learning. Serotonin (5-HT): Overall, 5-HT synapses are more abundant and have a greater number of synaptic contacts in the NAcc shell than in the core. They are also larger and thicker, and contain more large dense core vesicles than their counterparts in the core.  Function  =Reward and reinforcement= The nucleus accumbens, being one part of the reward system, plays an important role in processing rewarding stimuli, reinforcing stimuli (e.g., food and water), and those which are both rewarding and reinforcing (addictive drugs, sex, and exercise). The predominant response of neurons in the nucleus accumbens to the reward sucrose is inhibition; the opposite is true in response to the administration of aversive quinine. Substantial evidence from pharmacological manipulation also suggests that reducing the excitability of neurons in the nucleus accumbens is rewarding, as, for example, would be true in the case of Œº-opioid receptor stimulation. The blood oxygen level dependent signal (BOLD) in the nucleus accumbens is selectively increased during the perception of pleasant, emotionally arousing pictures and during mental imagery of pleasant, emotional scenes. However, as BOLD is thought to be an indirect measure of regional net excitation to inhibition, the extent to which BOLD measures valence dependent processing is unknown. Because of the abundance of NAcc inputs from limbic regions and strong NAcc outputs to motor regions, the nucleus accumbens has been described by Gordon Mogensen as the interface between the limbic and motor system. Tuning of appetitive and defensive reactions in the nucleus accumbens shell. (Above) AMPA blockade requires D1 function in order to produce motivated behaviors, regardless of valence, and D2 function to produce defensive behaviors. GABA agonism, on the other hand, does not require dopamine receptor function.(Below)The expansion of the anatomical regions that produce defensive behaviors under stress, and appetitive behaviors in the home environment produced by AMPA antagonism. This flexibility is less evident with GABA agonism. The nucleus accumbens is causally related to the experience of pleasure. Microinjections of Œº-opioid agonists, Œ¥-opioid agonists or Œ∫-opioid agonists in the rostrodorsal quadrant of the medial shell enhance \\"liking\\", while more caudal injections can inhibit disgust reactions, liking reactions, or both. The regions of the nucleus accumbens that can be ascribed a causal role in the production of pleasure are limited both anatomically and chemically, as besides opioid agonists only endocannabinoids can enhance liking. In the nucleus accumbens as a whole, dopamine, GABA receptor agonist or AMPA antagonists solely modify motivation, while the same is true for opioid and endocannabinoids outside of the hotspot in the medial shell. A rostro-caudal gradient exists for the enhancement of appetitive versus fearful responses, the later of which is traditionally thought to require only D1 receptor function, and the former of which requires both D1 and D2 function. One interpretation of this finding, the disinhibition hypothesis, posits that inhibition of accumbens MSNs(which are GABAergic) disinhibits downstream structures, enabling the expression of appetitive or consummatory behaviors. The motivational effects of AMPA antagonists, and to a lesser extent GABA agonists, is anatomically flexible. Stressful conditions can expand the fear inducing regions, while a familiar environment can reduce the size of the fear inducing region. Furthermore, cortical input from the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) biases the response towards that of appetitive behavior, and infralimbic input, equivalent to the human subgenual cingulate cortex, suppresses the response regardless of valence. The nucleus accumbens is neither necessary nor sufficient for instrumental learning, although manipulations can affect performance on instrumental learning tasks. One task where the effect of NAcc lesions is evident is Pavlovian-instrumental transfer (PIT), where a cue paired with a specific or general reward can enhance instrumental responding. Lesions to the core of the NAcc impair performance after devaluation and inhibit the effect of general PIT. On the other hand, lesions to the shell only impair the effect of specific PIT. This distinction is thought to reflect consummatory and appetitive conditioned responses in the NAcc shell and the NAcc core, respectively. In the dorsal striatum, a dichotomy has been observed between D1-MSNs and D2-MSNs, with the former being reinforcing and enhancing locomotion, and the latter being aversive and reducing locomotion. Such a distinction has been traditionally assumed to apply to the nucleus accumbens as well, but evidence from pharmacological and optogenetics studies is conflicting. Furthermore, a subset of NAcc MSNs express both D1 and D2 MSNs, and pharmacological activation of D1 versus D2 receptors need not necessarily activate the neural populations exactly. While most studies show no effect of selective optogenetic stimulation of D1 or D2 MSNs on locomotor activity, one study has reported a decrease in basal locomotion with D2-MSN stimulation. While two studies have reported reduced reinforcing effects of cocaine with D2-MSN activation, one study has reported no effect. NAcc D2-MSN activation has also been reported to enhance motivation, as assessed by PIT, and D2 receptor activity is necessary for the reinforcing effects of VTA stimulation. A 2018 study reported that D2 MSN activation enhanced motivation via inhibiting the ventral pallidum, thereby disinhibiting the VTA. Maternal behavior An fMRI study conducted in 2005 found that when mother rats were in the presence of their pups the regions of the brain involved in reinforcement, including the nucleus accumbens, were highly active. Levels of dopamine increase in the nucleus accumbens during maternal behavior, while lesions in this area upset maternal behavior. When women are presented pictures of unrelated infants, fMRIs show increased brain activity in the nucleus accumbens and adjacent caudate nucleus, proportionate to the degree to which the women find these infants \\"cute\\". =Aversion= Activation of D1-type MSNs in the nucleus accumbens is involved in reward, whereas the activation of D2-type MSNs in the nucleus accumbens promotes aversion. =Slow-wave sleep= In late 2017, studies on rodents which utilized optogenetic and chemogenetic methods found that the indirect pathway (i.e., D2-type) medium spiny neurons in the nucleus accumbens core which co-express adenosine A2A receptors and project to the ventral pallidum are involved in the regulation of slow-wave sleep. In particular, optogenetic activation of these indirect pathway NAcc core neurons induces slow-wave sleep and chemogenetic activation of the same neurons increases the number and duration of slow-wave sleep episodes. Chemogenetic inhibition of these NAcc core neurons suppresses sleep. In contrast, the D2-type medium spiny neurons in the NAcc shell which express adenosine A2A receptors have no role in regulating slow-wave sleep. Clinical significance =Addiction= Current models of addiction from chronic drug use involve alterations in gene expression in the mesocorticolimbic projection. The most important transcription factors that produce these alterations are ŒîFosB, cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) response element binding protein (CREB), and nuclear factor kappa B (NFŒ∫B). ŒîFosB is the most significant gene transcription factor in addiction since its viral or genetic overexpression in the nucleus accumbens is necessary and sufficient for many of the neural adaptations and behavioral effects (e.g., expression-dependent increases in self-administration and reward sensitization) seen in drug addiction. ŒîFosB overexpression has been implicated in addictions to alcohol (ethanol), cannabinoids, cocaine, methylphenidate, nicotine, opioids, phencyclidine, propofol, and substituted amphetamines, among others. Increases in nucleus accumbens ŒîJunD expression can reduce or, with a large increase, even block most of the neural alterations seen in chronic drug abuse (i.e., the alterations mediated by ŒîFosB). ŒîFosB also plays an important role in regulating behavioral responses to natural rewards, such as palatable food, sex, and exercise. Natural rewards, like drugs of abuse, induce ŒîFosB in the nucleus accumbens, and chronic acquisition of these rewards can result in a similar pathological addictive state through ŒîFosB overexpression. Consequently, ŒîFosB is the key transcription factor involved in addictions to natural rewards as well; in particular, ŒîFosB in the nucleus accumbens is critical for the reinforcing effects of sexual reward. Research on the interaction between natural and drug rewards suggests that psychostimulants and sexual behavior act on similar biomolecular mechanisms to induce ŒîFosB in the nucleus accumbens and possess cross-sensitization effects that are mediated through ŒîFosB. Similar to drug rewards, non-drug rewards also increase the level of extracellular dopamine in the NAcc shell. Drug-induced dopamine release in the NAcc shell and NAcc core is usually not prone to habituation (i.e., the development of drug tolerance: a decrease in dopamine release from future drug exposure as a result of repeated drug exposure); on the contrary, repeated exposure to drugs that induce dopamine release in the NAcc shell and core typically results in sensitization (i.e., the amount of dopamine that is released in the NAcc from future drug exposure increases as a result of repeated drug exposure). Sensitization of dopamine release in the NAcc shell following repeated drug exposure serves to strengthen stimulus-drug associations (i.e., classical conditioning that occurs when drug use is repeatedly paired with environmental stimuli) and these associations become less prone to extinction (i.e., \\"unlearning\\" these classically conditioned associations between drug use and environmental stimuli becomes more difficult). After repeated pairing, these classically conditioned environmental stimuli (e.g., contexts and objects that are frequently paired with drug use) often become drug cues which function as secondary reinforcers of drug use (i.e., once these associations are established, exposure to a paired environmental stimulus triggers a craving or desire to use the drug which they've become associated with). In contrast to drugs, the release of dopamine in the NAcc shell by many types of rewarding non-drug stimuli typically undergoes habituation following repeated exposure (i.e., the amount of dopamine that is released from future exposure to a rewarding non-drug stimulus normally decreases as a result of repeated exposure to that stimulus). =Depression= In April 2007, two research teams reported on having inserted electrodes into the nucleus accumbens in order to use deep brain stimulation to treat severe depression.Brain Electrodes Help Treat Depression, Technology Review, 26 April 2007 In 2010, experiments reported that deep brain stimulation of the nucleus accumbens was successful in decreasing depression symptoms in 50% of patients who did not respond to other treatments such as electroconvulsive therapy. Nucleus accumbens has also been used as a target to treat small groups of patients with therapy- refractory obsessive-compulsive disorder. =Ablation= To treat addiction and in an attempt to treat mental illness radiofrequency ablation of the nucleus accumbens has been performed. The results are inconclusive and controversial.\\"Controversial Surgery for Addiction Burns Away Brain‚Äôs Pleasure Center\\" Author Maia Szalavitz.

The most striking attribute of this animal is its lower tusks, which are narrow, elongated, and distinctly flattened with the degree of flattening varying among the different species. Two valid species are currently placed within this genus, which was endemic to North America. Other species once assigned to Amebelodon are now assigned to the genus Konobelodon, which was once a subgenus. Taxonomy 1932 A. fricki restoration showing a possibly inaccurate short trunk Amebelodon first appeared in the Great Plains and Gulf Coast regions of North America during the late Miocene, roughly 9 million years ago, and apparently became extinct on this continent sometime around 6 million years ago. The youngest record of Amebelodon is from a 5-million-year-old site in North America.Lambert, W. D., 1990. Rediagnosis of the genus Amebelodon (Mammalia, Proboscidea, Gomphotheriidae) with a new subgenus and species, Amebelodon (Konobelodon) britti. Journal of Paleontology, 64 (6): 1032-1041.Lambert, W.

Cambridge University Press: Cambridge, UK. The species Amebelodon floridanus was relatively small, a little smaller than living elephants, and was common in fossil sites from 9 to 8 million years ago. Other larger but somewhat younger common North American species include Amebelodon fricki. One lineage of species once assigned to Amebelodon, including Amebelodon britti and North African Amebelodon cyrenaicus, is now placed in a separate genus called Konobelodon, formerly considered to be a subgenus.Konidaris, G. E., S. J. Roussiakis, G. E. Theodorou, and G. D. Koufos. 2014. The Eurasian occurrence of the shovel- tusker Konobelodon (Mammalia, Proboscidea) as illuminated by its presence in the late Miocene of Pikermi (Greece). Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology 34:1437‚Äì53. Paleobiology Like other typical gomphotheres, Amebelodon possessed two sets of tusks, one upper set, (much like those found on modern elephants), and one lower set that extended from the very front of the lower jaws. However, as mentioned above, the lower tusks of the Amebelodon were distinctive in that they were relatively long, slender, and flattened. Because of the resemblance of these lower tusks to shovels, Amebelodon is commonly referred to as a \\"shovel-tusked\\" gomphothere (another shovel-tusked gomphothere that may or may not be closely related to Amebelodon is Platybelodon). There has long been an assumption that these lower tusks were actually used as shovels by the animal during feeding, presumably to dig up water plants. However, an analysis of wear patterns has shown that these lower tusks were most likely used in a variety of ways in addition to shoveling, including scraping bark from trees.Lambert, W. D., 1992. The feeding habits of the shovel-tusked gomphotheres (Mammalia, Proboscidea, Gomphotheriidae): Evidence from tusk wear patterns. Paleobiology 18 (2): 132-147. Overall, the evidence indicates that this animal was a versatile browser (an animal that eats broad-leaved plants rather than grass), feeding in both wet and dry settings in a variety of ways. For reasons that are not clearly explained in the literature, Amebelodon is usually portrayed with a short, flap-like trunk (this is true of the associated picture). However, considerable evidence indicates that Amebelodon actually had a long, flexible trunk very much like that found in modern elephants, and that it probably was important for feeding, drinking, etc. Range Amebelodon was once thought to be widespread, but a study of Konobelodon in 2012 shortened the genus' range span, with the specimens found in China moved to the genus Protanancus.Wang S-Q, Wang D-Q, Shi Q-Q. 2012.

Organised by the British Army, starting in 1960, it brings together teams of six young people each, with the 2,400 young participants hiking to checkpoints on ten specified tors. The majority of entrants are schools, colleges, Scout groups and Cadet squadrons from South West England, though groups from across the UK have regularly taken part, as have teams from Australia and New Zealand. However, from 2012 only teams from the South West of England are eligible to take part, due to the large numbers of entrants. It is most commonly known as a step up from the Duke of Edinburgh's Award as the 55 Mile challenge is considered to be much more challenging.  Event format  Teams of six are required to visit ten specified tors; on the top of each tor is a checkpoint. Each team is required to visit all of the specified checkpoints in order. Up to two members per team may fall out during the Challenge; teams falling below this number could merge in earlier years, while later rules required a badly reduced team to forfeit. There are 26 different routes over three different distances, lettered from A to Z, using a total of 19 different manned tors: 12 Bronze (Junior) routes of for those aged 14 to 15 years; 10 Silver ( Intermediate) routes of for those aged 16 to 17 years; and 4 Gold ( Senior or Arduous) routes of for those aged 18 to 19 years, or 17-year-olds who completed a Silver or Bronze route previously. The organisers stress that the event is not a race - although teams often compete to see who can finish first - but a test of endurance, navigation and survival skills, because of not just the distances and the challenging terrain, but potentially also the weather; conditions on Dartmoor can vary considerably and change suddenly. In 1996, for example, the event was struck by a heavy snow storm, leading to some teams still being out on the moor a day after the event was due to have finished; while in 1998 temperatures reached 26 ¬∞C (79 ¬∞F). Participants arrive at Okehampton Camp on the Thursday or Friday before the hike, watch a safety briefing video and have their equipment checked, a thorough process known as scrutineering. Teams must carry all their food, clothing, tents, stoves, fuel, navigation equipment, maps, emergency rations and a first aid kit; they also collect drinking water from the moor and use water purification tablets. Each team has a nominated team leader, who is responsible for ensuring that the team's route card is stamped at each tor. All the teams start at 0700 on the Saturday from an area of flat land next to Anthony Stile, close to Okehampton Camp on the northern edge of Dartmoor. They stand in a semicircle and set off when a cannon fires. They have 34 hours to visit each of the ten tors on their route in the correct order. Teams must not pass through a checkpoint between 2200 on Saturday and 0600 on Sunday morning; nor may they pass the eighth tor until the Sunday. Those on 35 mile routes must camp at one of the manned tors on their route, while 45 and 55 mile teams may camp anywhere on the moor (minimum of 1km away from any checkpoints). Teams must arrive back at Anthony Stile by 1700 on the Sunday, having visited all ten tors on their route in order, to qualify for a medal and complimentary pasty. Teams that finish the challenge as a complete six also receive a certificate. History of the event The first Ten Tors Expedition took place in September 1960, with around 200 young people taking part. By 1980, the numbers had grown to more than 2,600. To protect the environment, the numbers are now limited to 2,400 individuals: 400 teams of four to six teenagers. The Army uses the event as a large scale logistics training exercise. Until 1967 the event was organised by the Junior Leaders Regiment, Royal Corps of Signals. This responsibility passed to Headquarters South West District, and in 1986 to 43 (Wessex) Brigade, the regional Headquarters of the Territorial Army in the South West. Since 1977 an additional event, The Jubilee Challenge, has been held for young people with physical or learning disabilities. This involves a selection of four routes of between , both on road and cross-country. Many military units and civilian groups provide support for this event and the Jubilee Challenge, including the Royal Wessex Yeomanry, Exeter UOTC, 243 Field Hospital RAMC, 6th Battalion The Rifles, two Sea King HC4 helicopters from 848 Naval Air Squadron, 39 (Skinners) Signal Regiment, two Gazelle helicopters from 7 Regiment Army Air Corps (Volunteers), Bristol UOTC and the Dartmoor Rescue Group. =1981= The first ever Junior Army Team from Junior Leaders Regiment Royal Armoured Corps JLR RAC finished the Gold Course with 24 minutes to spare, despite several of the six-strong team having severe foot injuries. They were cheered home by an honour guard of Royal Marines and Paratroopers who walked with the boys over the last mile. =1993= Tavistock Times reports \\"Hurricane Force\\" winds during the event. =1996= A cold northerly wind on the Saturday of the 1996 event turned to rain and snow overnight. This continued through Sunday, accompanied by fog and driving wind. Requests from Tor party commanders, two of whom had their tents destroyed, added to pressure to abandon the event, and there was a mass evacuation of the moor on the Sunday afternoon, the first time the event had been terminated early. Fifty-one teams completed their routes, but no record remains of their success. Ten Tors, A History =2001= Ten Tors was cancelled in 2001 due to the foot and mouth epidemic, but went ahead the next year. =2003= (69% finished Complete, + 21% with fall-outs) For the second year in succession the Plymouth DofE Award 45 team took the honour of leading the teams over the finish line, at 08:49 (Ten Tors Teams, 2003), improving on their time of 09:23 in 2002 (Ten Tors Teams, 2002) =2004= (75% finished Complete, + 17% with fall-outs) In 2004 the Ten Tors record for earliest complete team home was broken by R1809, Dartmoor Plodders, with a time of 08:19. This stood until 2009. =2005= (52% finished Complete, + 29% with fall-outs) In 2005, one of the original teams from the 1960 Ten Tors took part in the event, which was held on 14‚Äì15 May in particularly adverse weather conditions: constant rain on the Saturday, combined with a bitter wind, leading to an unusually high number of retirements. =2006= (76% finished Complete, + 17% with fall-outs) In 2006, the event was held over the weekend of 13‚Äì14 May, with high temperatures on the Sunday resulting in several cases of dehydration. =2007= On Sunday 4 March 2007, Charlotte Shaw was swept away by the rain-swollen Walla Brook near Watern Tor, while training for the event. The rest of her group raised the alarm using a mobile phone, but despite her being evacuated by a Royal Navy helicopter within 20 minutes, she died later that night in Derriford Hospital, Plymouth. In December 2009 an inquest into the death was halted for the case to be considered for criminal charges.BBC: Police watchdog will not investigate Tors death Several other groups were also evacuated by helicopter after weather conditions on Dartmoor deteriorated. The event itself was abandoned at 21:30 on Saturday 12 May 2007, halfway through, due to severe weather conditions; the decision was influenced by the high drop-out rate of 15% on Saturday. Participants spent the night camped at a manned Tor, before being escorted off the moor by the military the following day. =2008= (61% finished Complete, + 25% with fall-outs) From 2008 the event was much changed, with different routes and use of the moor to help bird conservation in the nesting season. Steeperton Tor and Hare Tor were dropped from the Tor list, and the pass from Dinger to Kitty Tor known as \\"Death Valley\\" was zoned off limits. Each team was permitted only four training walks on the north moor. A review of these changes . The 2008 event was a total contrast to the previous years, with temperatures in the low 20s Celsius, and participants dropping out because of dehydration rather than hypothermia. The first team across the line was the 20th Torbay Explorer Scouts, finishing at 09:10. =2009= (80% finished Complete, + 13% with fall-outs) In 2009 the Ten Tors' record for the earliest complete team home since the rule change was broken with a time of 08:17 by 20th Torbay Explorer Scouts. For the first time an all-girls team, from Torquay Grammar School for Girls also broke the record for successfully completing the 35-, 45- and 55-mile events consecutively and with the same team members (Tamsin Owen, Joyce Nie, Francesca Hill, Amelia Skerritt, Rebecca Stanley and Hannah Short). There were fewer dropouts than in other years in almost perfect weather conditions. =2010= (79% finished Complete, + 14% with fall-outs) 2010 saw the 50th anniversary of the Ten Tors event. To mark the occasion the Duke of Edinburgh visited the event on Sunday morning to speak to finishers and present some with the commemorative 50 years medals. It also marked the first year that teams carried a GPS tracker which enabled the organisers and team managers to track the participants' progress directly. The first finishers were 20th Torbay Explorer Scouts (Joshua Owen, Matthew Ryder, Luke Hayward, Jacob Shah, Paul Moroz and William Fordyce) and King Edward's School Bath (Robert Wilcox, James Plumstead, Benjamin Smith, Edmond Venables (son of Stephen Venables), Jonathan Tracy and Mark Humphreys) who walked over the line together at 7:37 to break the record for earliest finishers by 40 minutes, and also finishing four and a half hours ahead of any other team on their route. This also meant the scout group had crossed the line first for three consecutive years. Notable other finishers were the 'Denbury Boys' who, made up of men who completed the first ever Ten Tors, successfully completed the 35 mile event. =2011= (81% finished Complete, + 14% with fall-outs) The 2011 Challenge started under a clear blue sky, but cloud obscured the tops of *West Mill and *High Willhays even then. Cloud and a fresh breeze built up through the day, but by 17:50 a blue sky was breaking through. Sunday was very similar with the first finishers (M1306 - Downend Scouts, at 08:35 Route M listing, 2011) walking in under a blue sky, but again the cloud gathered through the day. Notes from the Event. The largely overcast and cool weekend was almost perfect walking weather - of the 390 teams which started 374 (95%) walked over the finish line, and of those finishing teams 316 (81%) walked in with all six team members. Over the last fifteen years of the event this is the highest percentage of both Finishing and Complete teams. Sixteen teams either retired (just 7, less than 2%) or were 'crashed out', but even here the statistics are impressive ‚Äì in the previous 15 years teams are noted as stopping at their second Tor onwards. In 2011 the first teams to stop reached their fifth Tor before doing so. It was also the 60th anniversary of Dartmoor as a National Park so everyone received a participant certificate. =2012= (75% finished Complete, + 17% with fall-outs) The first team to reach the finish line was the Torquay Boys' Grammar School 45-mile team, who reached camp at 8:56am. They were soon followed by both Torbay Explorer Scouts and Queen Elizabeth's Hospital School 45-mile team, who performed an excellent display of sportsmanship by finishing the last kilometre of the course side by side, despite a failure in the alarm of the QEH team, delaying the team by a full hour. The first 35-mile team to cross the finish was Churcher's College, Hampshire, getting back to cap with a record breaking time of 09:21 on the Sunday morning. This was also the first all-boy team to cross the finish, and second overall. The first all-girl team to reach the finish line, The Maynard 35-mile team, got back to camp at 10:20, setting a new time record for the school. The Maynard 45-mile team also completed the challenge in a respectable time, finishing at 13:59. The 2012 event was notable for the selfless efforts of one team, X2414 Kingsbridge Community College (55), who were on schedule to complete their route shortly after 16:00 when they diverted to answer the distress whistles of another team which had two of its members trapped chest deep in Raybarrow Pool. After calling in the Dartmoor Rescue Group and helping the other team, X2414 walked in at 17:19, almost twenty minutes after the close of the event - this would normally debar a team from receiving their awards. The Director Ten Tors, Brigadier Piers Hankinson, met the team at the finish and presented Kingsbridge with their gold medals. The event weather, following days of heavy rain, was cloudless, sunny and warm with 100% visibility. Notes from the Event, 2012 =2013= (23% of participants did not finish) The 2013 event went down in Ten Tors history as one of the most miserable. Organisers said that if the weather had come a day earlier then the event would have been cancelled. Swollen rivers from rain over the previous weeks meant that river crossings were hazardous; teams were offered advice on the best places to cross by Dartmoor Mountain Rescue. Some young people stayed at river crossings for a number of hours, selflessly helping others to cross whilst putting their own chances of finishing on hold. Especially on Saturday, navigation became extremely difficult as fog and mist reduced visibility to as low as 10 metres: a few less experienced 35 mile teams did not even make their first tor. The weather lifted overnight and gave teams a break from the rain, but this brought near-freezing temperatures across the whole moor. Throughout Sunday the weather worsened again. Queen Elizabeth's Hospital School 45 mile team S1915 were the first team to make it across the finish line on the Sunday morning at 9:20, over four hours ahead of any other team on their route. Teams often choose odd dress code for crossing the finishing line. School uniform, kilts, miniskirts and Chinese dragons have all featured in the past. However, this year, the Launceston College 45 mile team decided to cross the line in brightly coloured morphsuits. Whilst the rain was beginning to lash down and the traditional Dartmoor high winds persisted, the team sacrificed their finishing time (12:15) to show the spirit and good humour that makes Ten Tors. The finishing gate was left open for an extra 45 minutes. By 11:00 on Sunday morning, over 300 people had dropped out, and by the end of the day the number of people who would not complete had increased to over 500. =2014= (81% finished complete) The first team to finish was the 35 mile CCF team from Churcher's College, Petersfield, Hants. They came over the line at 8:24am and was a mixed team: Olivia Hart, Francesca Hussell, Jerome Greig, Ben Kelson, Edward Rodge and Owen Tutt, around 45 minutes ahead of all other teams. In the 55 mile event, Queen Elizabeth's Hospital School were the first to finish, followed a whole two minutes later by the slower King Edward's school. =2015= (73.7% complete 18.9% with fall- outs)http://www.tentors.org.uk/archive/2016/entry/ten-tors-2015-stats.html Second time in a row the first team to finish was the 35 mile CCF team from Churcher's College, Petersfield, Hants. They crossed the finish line at 9:10am on a foggy Sunday morning consisting of 14- to 15-year-old boys: Julian Greig, Dylan Joseph, Joe Keohane, Archie Moffat, Sam Mullender and Jack Stubbings. Second across was Kingswood School, Bath at 9:13. This was the 55th anniversary of Ten Tors, and to celebrate this, two teams of veterans were given special permission to take part. They did one of the 55 mile routes on the 55th anniversary, all aged over 55 (some considerably so). Most of them had completed Ten Tors as teenagers in the 1970s whilst at school in Exeter, but none had had the opportunity to do the 55 mile route. Apart from being too old, they followed all the rules, carrying all the same equipment as the young people. Both teams completed the challenge complete; fourteen veterans in all, albeit fairly late in the day on the Sunday. =2016= (73% complete 21 with fall-outs)http://www.tentors.org.uk/archive/2016/entry/ten-tors-statisics.html 2016 saw warmer weather, getting up to 20 ¬∞C across the moor. The first team to cross the finish line was Torbay Scouts who took part in the 35-mile (56 km) route at 8:51, followed by Monkton Combe CCF (8:59) The National Trust Dartmoor (9:03) (1 hr 50 ahead of anyone else on their route) KES Bath (9:08) and Exeter School's Blackdown Hikers A (9:10) (2 hrs 10 ahead of anyone else on their route). The first 55-mile team to cross the finish line was Colyton Grammar School. They crossed the finish line at 10:52, team consisting of: Matt Domhof, Frank Hartley, Charlie King, Zoe Kuyken, Ellie Marok and Jonny Surtees (C). At 13:25 a 45-mile team from Kingswood Explorer Scouts came across the line sporting very groovy Hawaiian outfits which was very fitting in the glorious sunshine. The event also generated a light-hearted news story when the downdraught from a low-flying Royal Navy Merlin Mk3 helicopter blew away a row of portable toilets. They were not occupied at the time and there were no injuries.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H1VCg5VdP0s Adults were awarded for long service to Ten Tors with 1 40+ Platinum award, 1 30+ Diamond award and 5 20+ gold awards, including Jack Barker, from the Erme and Yealm Hillwalking Club/Ivybridge Community College receiving the Platinum and Diamond; plus Paul Johnson & Peter Challiss from Tavistock & District Youth Forum, receiving Gold for 20yrs service. =2017= The event had the perfect weather conditions, with it not being too cold or too hot, leading to 84.9% of teams reaching the finish line complete. First to finish were 20th Torbay Scouts, arriving back at the base camp at 08:19 Sunday, followed by Torquay Boys' Grammar School B at 08:37, who finished almost an hour before anyone else on their route after walking for 2.5 hours. The first 55-mile team was that of Torquay Boys' Grammar School A, consisting of Joe Kingdon, Tom Snow, Matt Birdsall, Adam White, Harry Fox and Tom Gregory. They finished at 9:54, beating the previously held record for Route X, introduced in 2014, by 1hr35mins.

Originally based in Georgetown, Indiana, PIX was based out of Bloomington, Indiana following brief stints in Olympia, Washington, Gainesville, Florida, and Cairo, Illinois. The label released folk punk and pop punk music, including Against Me!'s Crime As Forgiven By, other releases include albums by This Bike Is a Pipe Bomb, Defiance, Ohio, Ghost Mice, Japanther, The Bananas, Operation: Cliff Clavin, and Antsy Pants and Fifteen.Retrieved on 2009-06-16 http://www.punknews.org/labels/planitx History Founded in 1994 by Samantha Jane Dorsett, Plan-It-X held a DIY punk ethic. The label sold all CDs for five dollars or less. PIX's slogan reads: \\"If it ain't cheap, it ain't punk\\". PIX attempted to demonstrate that the practices of major record labels do not need to be duplicated by independent record labels in order to be successful. They supported other small labels and encourage others to do so as well (and even go as far as to suggest starting your own label). The label was run by Chris Johnston, who goes by the name Chris Clavin (For the band name Operation: Cliff Clavin) and his friends. Johnston formerly played in the bands Ghost Mice and Imperial Can, as well as his solo acts Captain Chaos. Chris is a former band member of Operation: Cliff Clavin, The Devil Is Electric, The Ted Dancin' Machine, Peanucle, The Sissies, Tooth Soup and The Jammy Dodgers. Beyond the release of musical albums, Plan-It-X has released a book by author Greg Wells (Complete Control: An Anthology 1997-2005), the zine My Friend Bubby, as well as a DVD featuring live performances of bands filmed during Plan-It-X Fest 2004 (see below). A documentary was released in 2010, put together from footage shot across the week of the 2006 Plan-It-X Fest.Retrieved on 2009-06-16 http://microcosmpublishing.com/catalog/videos/2685/ Clavin closed the label in 2016, writing that since it was not financially possible to release music in a physical format, and since bands could now easily release their music on their own, the label had outlived its original purpose.http://www.nuvo.net/indianapolis/chris-clavin-shutters-plan-it-x- records/Content?oid=3713707 In August and September 2017, Clavin was accused of one act of non-consensual sexual contact and other incidents of interpersonal misconduct. Clavin said, \\"I no longer play in any bands. I no longer run a record label or publishing company. I will settle all affairs and orders of course, and pay all outstanding debts and invoices.\\" Many artists who worked with Plan-It-X made public statements condemning Clavin's alleged behavior and assured fans that their prior Plan-It-X releases, in most cases out of print, would not be re-released under the Plan-It-X name. Some of these artists include AJJ and Kimya Dawson. His bandmate in Ghost Mice, Hannah O'Connor, posted the following on Facebook, quoted by PunkNews in response to the allegations: \\"Since I have been Chris' friend for a long time, I know that he is being accused of things he has not done. I know there are a lot of false allegations, rumors, and lies spreading very fast about him.\\"https://www.punknews.org/article/64600/chris-clavin-accused-of-assault- clavin-responds-bands-react  Plan-It-X Fest  In 2004 Plan-It-X Records celebrated its 10-year anniversary with a three-day festival in Bloomington, Indiana. A large portion of the bands involved with the label performed throughout the three-day event. With the success of the 2004 fest, Plan-It-X decided to take the festival on the road the following year in 2005 with a number of their bands in a school bus. The school bus toured throughout the Eastern and Midwestern United States. 2006 saw the third Plan-It-X fest return to Bloomington as a six-day \\"Punk Rock Summer Camp,\\" with bands playing every night and workshops and other activities throughout the afternoon. Like the two previous fests, 2006's fest raised money for charity. This year a total of $8,200 was split amongst three different charities. 2011 saw the fourth Plan- It-X Fest. It took place on June 24, 25, and 26 in Bloomington, Indiana. Like previous fests, this one was a benefit for several grassroots organizations. It also marked the release of PIX99, a book based on founder Samantha Dorsett's life. The 5th Plan-It-X Fest happened in 2012.the webpage for the 5th Plan-It-X fest The 6th Plan-It-X Fest took place in 2014 in Spencer, IN. The 7th (and rumored to be the final) Plan-It-X Fest took place in Spencer, IN from July 22nd to the 24th, 2016. This festival was filmed for a short YouTube documentary by Punk With A Camera entitled \\"And One For Good Luck - The Last Plan-It-X Fest\\". Artists performing included Ramshackle Glory, Ghost Mice, Terror Pigeon, The Wild, Pioneers Press author Adam Gnade, Super Famicon, Erin Tobey, Your Heart Breaks and many more.

Plan-It-X carries all of the Plan-It-X South releases in their catalog. This arrangement benefits Chris Johnston, as Teddy operates and finances PIX South, so the burden is taken off of Johnston. And since the releases are distributed through the main PIX catalog, it allows Teddy the opportunity to take part in the production and release of more music, distributed through a channel already proven successful. PIX South shares the same DIY punk ethic of its mother label.Retrieved on 2009-06-16 http://www.plan-it-x.org/artist/future-virgins-the/ = PIX South Bands = * ADD/C * Friday Knight * The Future Virgins * The Hidden Spots * Landlord * PantyShanty * Rymodee * Sexy * Stressface * This Bike Is a Pipe Bomb Notes  See also  * List of record labels External links * Category:American independent record labels Category:Record labels established in 1994 Category:Punk record labels ","title":"Plan-It-X Records"},{"id":"553332","text":"Central European may mean: * A person of one of a Central European ethnic group * Relating to or characteristic of Central Europe or its inhabitants Culture * Central European cuisine, cuisine typical to Central Europe * Central European University, a graduate-level, English-language university promoting a distinctively Central European perspective * Central European University Press * Central European Free Trade Agreement, a free trade area established by central European countries * Central European Initiative, a forum of regional cooperation * Central European Media Enterprises, a Bermuda- based media and entertainment company * Serbian Orthodox Eparchy of Central Europe, former name of the Serbian Orthodox Eparchy of Frankfurt and all of Germany * Central European History, a peer-reviewed academic journal on history published quarterly by Cambridge University Press * Central European Time, time zone used in most parts of the European Union * Central European Jamboree, a Scouting jamboree * Central European Exchange Program for University Studies, an international exchange program History * Urnfield culture (c. 1300 BC ‚Äì 750 BC), a late Bronze Age culture of Central Europe * Lusatian culture (1300 BCE ‚Äì 500 BCE), a late Bronze Age and early Iron Age in Central Europe * Hallstatt culture, the predominant Central European culture from the 8th to 6th centuries BC * Central Europe Campaign, Western Allied invasion of Germany Sport * Central European Football League, a regional American football league * Central European Tour Budapest GP, a cycling race in Hungary * Central European Tour Miskolc GP, is a cycling race in Hungary * Central European International Cup, an international football competition held by certain national teams from Central Europe between 1927 and 1960 * Central Europe Rally, a rally raid endurance race held in Romania and Hungary * Ladies Central European Open, a women's professional golf tournament on the Ladies European Tour * Central European Australian Football League Championships, an Australian rules football tournament * Mitropa Cup, officially called the La Coupe de l'Europe Centrale, was one of the first international major European football cups for club sides See also * European Union, a European supranational entity (federation) * Europe (disambiguation) * EU (disambiguation) * Euro (disambiguation) ","title":"Central European"},{"id":"553337","text":"Allen County is the name of several counties in the United States: *Allen County, Indiana *Allen County, Kansas *Allen County, Kentucky *Allen County, Ohio *Allen Parish, Louisiana ","title":"Allen County"},{"id":"553347","text":"Alexander County is the name of two counties in the United States: *Alexander County, Illinois *Alexander County, North Carolina ","title":"Alexander County"},{"id":"553360","text":"Albany County is the name of two jurisdictions in the United States in different states: *Albany County, New York *Albany County, Wyoming ","title":"Albany County"},{"id":"553362","text":"Diana Charlton Muldaur (born August 19, 1938) is an American film and television actress. Muldaur's television roles include Rosalind Shays on L.A. Law and Dr. Katherine Pulaski in the second season of Star Trek: The Next Generation. She also appeared in two episodes of Star Trek: The Original Series in the late 1960s, playing two different roles. She has been nominated for an Emmy two times: twice as a supporting actress on L.A. Law in 1990 and 1991. She was also nominated twice for a Q Award from Viewers for Quality Television for L.A. Law. Born in Brooklyn, New York, and raised on the Massachusetts island of Martha's Vineyard, Muldaur started acting in high school and continued on through college, graduating from Sweet Briar College in Virginia in 1960. She studied acting under Stella Adler and made her name on the New York stage. She was at one point a board member of the Screen Actors Guild and was the first woman to serve as president of the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences (1983‚Äì1985). Early career In 1965, Muldaur landed the role of Ann Wicker in the CBS daytime soap opera The Secret Storm. She then did a five-episode arc as Jeannie Orloff in the final season of Richard Chamberlain's NBC medical drama, Dr. Kildare. Various roles as a guest star in episodes of numerous television shows followed, including Gunsmoke, Bonanza, I Spy, The Courtship of Eddie's Father, The Invaders, Mannix, Mod Squad, Hawaii Five-O, The F.B.I., The Virginian, and a two-episode arc on the Ben Gazzara drama Run for Your Life. Multiple collaborations between Muldaur and Burt Reynolds began when Muldaur appeared in an episode of Hawk (1966), a weekly procedural with Reynolds in the title role. Subsequently, they both guest-starred in a third-season episode of The F.B.I. (1968), and Muldaur turned in a memorable guest performance in an episode of Reynolds' series Dan August (1970). In 1967, Muldaur guest-starred on the Gunsmoke episode \\"Fandango\\" with James Arness. An excerpt of that episode's dialogue was sampled on the Pink Floyd album The Wall, after \\"Hey You\\" and before the brief song \\"Is There Anybody Out There?\\" In 1968, she appeared in the original Star Trek episodes \\"Return to Tomorrow\\" (as Science Officer Dr. Ann Mulhall), and in \\"Is There in Truth No Beauty?\\" as Dr. Miranda Jones. During this time, a friendship with creator Gene Roddenberry formed that led to him casting Muldaur as Marg in the television movie Planet Earth (1974) with John Saxon. Later she appeared as Dr. Katherine Pulaski in 20 episodes of the second season of Star Trek: The Next Generation (1988‚Äì1989). Harold Robbins' The Survivors afforded Muldaur her first big break, when in 1969, she landed the role of Belle in the high-profile new ABC primetime serial. Unfortunately, the soap, a comeback vehicle for Hollywood icon Lana Turner, was canceled early into the 1970 television season after 15 episodes. The cast also included Ralph Bellamy and George Hamilton. Film stardom After the cancellation of The Survivors, Muldaur accepted a bevy of critically acclaimed supporting roles in many high-profile motion pictures: She received critical acclaim for a pivotal supporting role in The Swimmer (1968) with Burt Lancaster, which she filmed prior to gaining renown in Star Trek and The Survivors; Number One, released in August 1969, was a crowd-pleasing football film starring Charlton Heston and Jessica Walter, and the moody psychological thriller The Other with Uta Hagen was released in 1972. In actuality, her more substantial film roles during this time were those that garnered the most commercial success: Sidney J. Furie's The Lawyer (1970), One More Train to Rob (1971) with George Peppard, and the John Wayne crime drama, McQ (1974). Muldaur appeared in the ensemble-apocalypse thriller Chosen Survivors (1974) with Jackie Cooper, Richard Jaeckel and Barbara Babcock. In 1977, she played Elaine Mati, the concerned wife of mentally unstable doctor Telly Savalas in the independent film Beyond Reason. Other television guest-starring roles In 1967 guest starred on Mannix episode ‚ÄúCoffin for a Clown‚Äù. In 1971 Muldaur appeared as Rachel Bonham in \\"The Men From Shiloh\\" (rebranded name for the TV western The Virginian) in the episode titled \\"The Politician.\\" Muldaur guest starred in a first-season episode of Alias Smith and Jones, \\"The Great Shell Game\\" in 1971. In the second season of Kung Fu in 1973, opposite David Carradine, she guest- starred in the episode \\"The Elixir\\" playing a traveling show-woman who yearned for freedom from men‚Äîtopical at the time‚Äîand starred in the pilot episode of Charlie's Angels. In a 1972 Hawaii Five-O episode, she was guest star along with Ricardo Montalb√°n. She had a recurring role as Judge Eleanor Hooper on The Tony Randall Show during the show's 1976‚Äì1978 run, and was a guest star in season 2 of Fantasy Island. Muldaur guest-starred on The Incredible Hulk, playing the part of Helen Banner, David Banner's sister, in the Season 3, episode \\"Homecoming\\" in November 1979. In 1981, she played a nun in the fifth- season episode \\"Sanctuary\\". In 1975, she made a guest appearance in an episode of The Rockford Files as \\"Mrs. Bannister\\", a married woman who has an affair with a former cellmate of the series' title character. During this time, Muldaur also appeared on Police Woman, Quincy M.E., The Streets of San Francisco, The Love Boat, The Hardy Boys/Nancy Drew Mysteries and Hart to Hart, among others. She appeared in the first season of Angela Lansbury's Murder, She Wrote. Recurring roles =McCloud= During the seven season course of the show, Muldaur had a recurring role on the Dennis Weaver mystery anthology McCloud as dependable fan-favorite Chris Couglin, McCloud's love interest. Her character is introduced in the pilot episode in 1970 and makes her last of 16 appearances in April 1977. She reprised her role as Chris for the 1989 reunion movie The Return of Sam McCloud. =Born Free= Muldaur was cast as conservationist Joy Adamson in the television drama Born Free about Elsa the Lioness. Filming for the ambitious project, which co-starred Gary Collins, took place in Kenya and the NBC series, which debuted in Fall of 1974, lasted one season. The series was released on DVD in 2012 by Sony Pictures Home Entertainment. Guest stars on Born Free included Peter Lawford and several of Muldaur's future co-stars, including: Alex Cord (Chosen Survivors) and Susan Dey (L.A. Law). =Hizzonner= In 1979, Muldaur starred with David Huddleston in the short-lived NBC sitcom Hizzonner, which lasted just seven episodes and co-starred Kathy Cronkite, daughter of news presenter Walter Cronkite. She played the Mayor's dependable secretary, Ginny. =A Year in the Life= First an Emmy-winning miniseries and then a weekly drama, A Year in the Life was a critical darling for NBC with a cast including Richard Kiley and Sarah Jessica Parker. As Dr. Alice Foley, Muldaur praised the show as an example of how television was becoming more realistic about women. =Star Trek: The Next Generation= Muldaur is known for playing \\"dignified, sophisticated characters\\". Consequently, for the second season of Star Trek: The Next Generation, Gene Roddenberry was already familiar with Muldaur from her second-season appearance in the Classic Trek's \\"Return to Tomorrow\\", and later in a third-season appearance in \\"Is There in Truth No Beauty?\\". He subsequently cast her in his 1973 TV movie Planet Earth. For Season 2 of Star Trek: The Next Generation, Roddenberry chose her specifically to replace the outgoing Gates McFadden, who was let go on the insistence of one of the show's first season producers. Muldaur was cast to play the role of Dr. Pulaski, the new chief medical officer. \\"We needed someone with a little more of an edge,\\" Rick Berman explained of the choice. \\"Kate's a strong, confident woman with an edge who can hold her own with Captain Picard. Their relationship is not all that unlike the one between Kirk and McCoy ... although from the onset we had no intention of trying to duplicate the original team.\\" Muldaur said after her casting: Of Pulaski's willingness to stand up to the captain, Muldaur said: Some television critics praised Muldaur's performance, with one noting her \\"wry, no-nonsense warmth that plays nicely off of some of the icier regulars\\". The addition of Muldaur, along with Whoopi Goldberg, also served to redress the absence of women from the principal cast, as the departure of McFadden and Denise Crosby had left only Marina Sirtis, a rapid attrition of women that recalled the imbalance of the original Star Trek series. Ultimately, however, Muldaur found working on the syndicated show an \\"unhappy\\" experience, saying, \\"The imagination and joy wasn't there.\\" \\"Everybody was out for themselves. I don't think they were happy to have me there.\\" \\"It wasn't what I hoped it would be. I thought it would be wonderfully inventive and wonderfully creative, and I found it was not any of those things. But it did give me Trekkies. I love Trekkies. I find them very dear.\\" The character also proved unpopular with some fans, who among other things found her treatment of the lovable android Data to be mean-spirited. Muldaur left the series after only one season. Show representatives denied that she had been fired, saying, \\"Technically, she's just not returning\\", while other sources said that her option had not been renewed. Roddenberry described Muldaur as \\"a most talented actress\\", and said that the decision \\"to let her go was made solely because the hoped-for chemistry between her and the rest of the starship cast did not develop.\\" Berman added, \\"The thought of bringing Gates back was a good idea to us. The feeling was that we had perhaps made a mistake, and the best way to remedy it was to bring her back.\\" The \\"revolving door\\" and the limited opportunities for female crew led critics to suggest that the mostly male series still had a problem featuring women. =L.A. Law= Muldaur subsequently earned two Emmy nominations for her role as pushy and power- hungry lawyer Rosalind Shays on L.A. Law. Of Roz's creation, by prolific television writer David E. Kelley, Muldaur said: In one episode of the Stephen Bochco-drama, Jill Eikenberry's character Ann Kelsey tells Shays: \\"If you were a man, you'd be applauded for your achievements.\\" Muldaur insisted her character \\"was just too strong for a lot of men\\". Muldaur described the L.A. Law actors as \\"the closest family\\", and said she was \\"thrilled\\" to play a villain like Shays after portraying \\"everybody's mistress for 20 years\\", and expressed fascination with the public reception for Shays: The surprise scene where Roz and Leland are seen in bed together was ranked as the 38th greatest moment in television in an issue of EGG magazine. Equally spectacular was Roz's fatal exit from the show, falling down an elevator shaft. Muldaur joked: \\"I was as shocked as everybody else. I thought maybe I had asked for too much money!\\" After L.A. Law, Muldaur retired from show business. At one point she contemplated a face-lift, noting in 2000 at the age of 61, \\"You don't see many people my age on television\\", but eventually decided against it, remarking, \\"Somebody has to look the right age.\\" Her stated ambition is \\"to play all the great women's roles... I'd love to play Lady Macbeth.\\" Jill Eikenberry, who played Ann Kelsey on L.A. Law, said on E! True Hollywood Story that the whole L.A. Law cast loved the dynamic between Muldaur and Richard Dysart, and that they were all very sad to see Muldaur leave the show. =Batman: The Animated Series= Muldaur provided the voice of Dr. Leslie Thompkins on Batman: The Animated Series from 1992 to 1994. =Other television series= In 1975 Muldaur appeared in one episode in the first season of The Rockford Files. In 1977, she guest-starred in the second episode (\\"Mirror Image\\") of the short- lived CBS espionage series Hunter. In the early 1990s, she also guest-starred on two episodes of Matlock as well as Empty Nest with Richard Mulligan and the pilot for Aaron Spelling's Hearts Are Wild. Television films In 1973, Muldaur was cast in the lead of Call to Danger as Carrie Donovon, a Justice Department investigator trying to free a kidnapped crime-syndicate informant from a west coast farm compound. The film aired as a CBS New Tuesday Night Movie and co-starred Peter Graves and Clu Gulager, who Diana worked with previously on the Lana Turner primetime soap The Survivors in 1969‚Äì1970 and would work with again in the John Wayne crime drama, McQ, (1974). In 1974, Muldaur starred in The Wonderful World of Disney movie presentation of Hog Wild! with John Ericson and Kim Richards for NBC. In 1979, she starred in the made-for-television film version of The Miracle Worker in which she played the role of Katie Keller, the mother of Helen Keller. The NBC film starred Melissa Gilbert and Patty Duke Astin. In an attempt to capitalize on Burt Reynolds's international superstardom, Muldaur's performance in the pilot episode of the Reynolds-Norman Fell crime series, Dan August, (1970‚Äì1971), was edited together with a subsequent episode and repackaged as a 1980 ABC Movie of the Week titled Dan August: The Jealousy Factor. In 1991, Muldaur played Lauren Jeffreys, the main guest-star client of Perry Mason (Raymond Burr) and lifelong friend of Della Street in the NBC television movie Perry Mason and the Case of the Fatal Fashion. Valerie Harper, Scott Baio and Ally Walker also appeared. Muldaur worked previously with Raymond Burr as a special guest star on both the detective series Ironside in 1971 and his short-lived 1977 series Kingston: Confidential. Other television films include: the Black Beauty mini- series (1977), Pine Canyon is Burning (1977), Maneaters Are Loose! (1978), The Word (1978), and Joseph Wambaugh's two-hour film Police Story: A Cry for Justice (1978) with Dennis Weaver and Larry Hagman. Muldaur teamed with The Smothers Brothers for Terror at Alcatraz (1982) and turned in strong dramatic performances in Murder in Three Acts (1986) opposite Peter Ustinov and Locked Up: A Mother's Rage (1991) with Jean Smart and Angela Bassett. Personal life Muldaur is a 1960 graduate of Sweet Briar College, a small private women's school in central Virginia. She is the older sister of singer- songwriter Geoff Muldaur, who is the former husband of singer Maria Muldaur. She is also the aunt of singer-songwriter Jenni Muldaur and singer-songwriter Clare Muldaur-Manchon. She lived in Los Angeles from 1970 to 1991.

Moorland, nowadays, generally means uncultivated hill land (such as Dartmoor in South West England), but also includes low-lying wetlands (such as Sedgemoor, also South West England). It is closely related to heath, although experts disagree on what precisely distinguishes both types of vegetation. Generally, moor refers to highland and high rainfall zones whereas heath refers to lowland zones which are more likely to be the result of human activity. Moorland habitats mostly occur in tropical Africa, northern and western Europe, and neotropical South America. Most of the world's moorlands are very diverse ecosystems. In the extensive moorlands of the tropics, biodiversity can be extremely high. Moorland also bears a relationship to tundra (where the subsoil is permafrost or permanently frozen soil), appearing as the tundra and the natural tree zone. The boundary between tundra and moorland constantly shifts with climatic change. Heather moorland Heather moorland on the North York Moors mainly consisting of Calluna vulgaris Heathland and moorland are the most extensive areas of semi- natural vegetation in the British Isles. The eastern British moorlands are similar to heaths but are differentiated by having a covering of peat. On western moors the peat layer may be several metres thick. Scottish \\"muirs\\" are generally heather moors, but also have extensive covering of grass, cotton- grass, mosses, bracken and under-shrubs such as crowberry, with the wetter moorland having sphagnum moss merging into bog-land. There is uncertainty about how many moors were created by human activity. Oliver Rackham writes that pollen analysis shows that some moorland, such as in the islands and extreme north of Scotland, are clearly natural, never having had trees,Birks and Madsen (1979). Journal of Ecology, 67. whereas much of the Pennine moorland area was forested in Mesolithic times.Turner and Hodgson (1979). Journal of Ecology, 67. How much the deforestation was caused by climatic changes and how much by human activity is uncertain. Ecology A variety of distinct habitat types are found in different world regions of moorland. The wildlife and vegetation forms often lead to high endemism because of the severe soil and microclimate characteristics. For example, in England's Exmoor, the Exmoor Pony, a rare horse breed which has adapted to the harsh conditions of that environment. In Europe, the associated fauna consists of bird species such as red grouse, hen harrier, merlin, golden plover, curlew, skylark, meadow pipit, whinchat, ring ouzel, and twite. Other species dominate in moorlands elsewhere. Reptiles are few due to the cooler conditions. In Europe, only the common viper is frequent, though in other regions moorlands are commonly home to dozens of reptile species. Amphibians such as frogs are well represented in moorlands. When moorland is overgrazed, woody vegetation is often lost, being replaced by coarse, unpalatable grasses and bracken, with a greatly reduced fauna. Moorland of Kilimanjaro Some hill sheep breeds, such as Scottish Blackface and the Lonk, thrive on the austere conditions of heather moors.Camilla Bonn (1998). 'That Jack Cunningham wants half of us out of farming', in Country Life, 15 January 1998, pp. 28‚Äì35. Management Burning of moorland has been practised for a number of reasons. For example, when grazing is insufficient to control growth. This is recorded in Britain in the fourteenth century. Uncontrolled burning frequently caused (and causes) problems, and was forbidden by statute in 1607. With the rise of sheep and grouse management in the nineteenth century it again became common practice. Heather is burnt at about 10 or 12 years old when it will regenerate easily. Left longer, the woodier stems will burn more aggressively and will hinder regrowth. Burning of moorland vegetation needs to be very carefully controlled as the peat itself can catch fire, and this can be difficult if not impossible to extinguish. In addition, uncontrolled burning of heather can promote alternative bracken and rough grass growth which ultimately produces poorer grazing. As a result, burning is now a controversial practice; Rackham calls it \\"second-best land management\\". Mechanical cutting of the heather has been used in Europe, but it is important for the material to be removed to avoid smothering regrowth. If heather and other vegetation are left for too long, a large volume of dry and combustible material builds up. This may result in a wildfire burning out a large area, although it has been found that heather seeds germinate better if subject to the brief heat of controlled burning. In terms of managing moorlands for wildlife, in the UK, vegetation characteristics are important for passerine abundance, whilst predator control benefits red grouse, golden plover, and curlew abundances. To benefit multiple species, many management options are required. However, management needs to be carried out in locations that are also suitable for species in terms of physical characteristics such as topography, climate and soil. Moorland in literature The development of a sensitivity to nature and one's physical surroundings grew with the rise of interest in landscape painting, and particularly the works of artists that favoured wide and deep prospects, and rugged scenery.Norton Anthology of English Literature; Romantic Literature. To the English Romantic imagination, moorlands fitted this image perfectly, enhancing the emotional impact of the story by placing it within a heightened and evocative landscape. Moorland forms the setting of various works of late Romantic English literature, ranging from the Yorkshire moorland in Emily Bront√´'s Wuthering Heights and The Secret Garden by Frances Hodgson Burnett to Dartmoor in Arthur Conan Doyle's Holmesian mystery The Hound of the Baskervilles. Enid Blyton's Famous Five series featured the young protagonists adventuring across various moorlands where they confronted criminals or other individuals of interest. Such a setting enhanced the plot as the drama unfolded away from the functioning world where the children could solve their own problems and face greater danger. Moorland in the Forest of Bowland in Lancashire is the setting for Walter Bennett's The Pendle Witches, the true story of some of England's most infamous witch trials. In Erin Hunter's Warriors series, one of the four Clans, WindClan, lives in the moorland alone. Michael Jecks, author of Knights Templar Mysteries, sets his books in and around Dartmoor, England. Paul Kingsnorth‚Äôs Beast is also set on a western English moor, using the barren landscape and fields of heather to communicate themes of timelessness and distance from civilization.

Plot summary Neil Gibson, the Gold King and former senator from \\"some Western state\\", approaches Holmes to investigate the murder of his wife Maria in order to clear his children's governess, Grace Dunbar, of the crime. It soon emerges that Mr. Gibson's marriage had been unhappy and he treated his wife very badly. He had fallen in love with her when he met her in Brazil, but soon realised they had nothing in common. He became attracted to Miss Dunbar; since he could not marry her, he had attempted to please her in other ways, such as trying to help people less fortunate than himself. Maria Gibson was found lying in a pool of blood on Thor Bridge with a bullet through the head and note from the governess, agreeing to a meeting at that location, in her hand. A recently discharged revolver with one shot fired is found in Miss Dunbar's wardrobe. Holmes agrees to look at the situation in spite of the damning evidence. From the outset, Holmes observes some rather odd things about the case. How could Miss Dunbar so coolly and rationally have planned and carried out the murder and then carelessly tossed the murder weapon into her wardrobe? What was the strange chip on the underside of the bridge's stone balustrade? Why was Mrs. Gibson clutching the note from Miss Dunbar when she died? If the murder weapon was one of a matched pair of pistols, why couldn't the other one be found in Mr. Gibson's collection? Holmes uses his powers of deduction to solve the crime, and demonstrates, using Watson's revolver, how it was perpetrated: Mrs Gibson, outraged and jealous of Miss Dunbar's relationship with her husband, resolved to end her own life and frame her rival for the crime. After arranging a meeting with Miss Dunbar, requesting her to leave her response in a note, Mrs Gibson tied a rock on a piece of string to the end of a revolver, and shot herself, the rock pulling the revolver over the side of the bridge; the revolver found in Miss Dunbar's wardrobe was the other pistol of the pair, which had been fired off in the woods earlier, and the chip in the bridge was caused by the pistol hitting the stonework as it was pulled off by the rock. Holmes's reconstruction reproduces the damage to the balustrade of the bridge. He asks the police to drag the lake for the revolvers of Watson and Gibson. Commentary The story is notable within the Sherlock Holmes canon for the initial reference to a tin dispatchbox, located within the vaults of the Cox and Co. Bank at Charing Cross in London, where Dr. Watson kept the papers concerning some of Holmes' unsolved or unfinished cases. According to Watson: \\"Among these unfinished tales is that of Mr. James Phillimore, who, stepping back into his own house to get his umbrella, was never more seen in this world\\". The unknown fate of Phillimore has been a subject for other stories, including: The Adventure of the Highgate Miracle by Adrian Conan Doyle and John Dickson Carr; \\"The Enigma of the Warwickshire Vortex\\" by F. Gwynplaine MacIntyre; The Problem of the Sore Bridge by Philip J. Farmer; one episode of the Italian comic book series Storie di Altrove (a spin-off from the more famous Martin Myst√®re); Bert Coules's BBC Radio adaptation The Singular Inheritance of Miss Gloria Wilson from The Further Adventures of Sherlock Holmes; and two books by Marvin Kaye, The Incredible Umbrella (Doubleday, 1979) and The Amorous Umbrella (Doubleday, 1981). Also mentioned is the case of Isadora Persano, \\"who was found stark staring mad with a match box in front of him which contained a remarkable worm said to be unknown to science\\" and that of the cutter Alicia. Publication history \\"The Problem of Thor Bridge\\" was first published in the UK in The Strand Magazine in February‚ÄìMarch 1922, and in the US in Hearst's International in the same months.Smith (2014), p. 184. The story was published with seven illustrations by A. Gilbert in the Strand, and with three illustrations by G. Patrick Nelson in Hearst's International.Cawthorne (2011), p. 160. It was included in the short story collection The Case-Book of Sherlock Holmes, which was published in the UK and the US in June 1927.Cawthorne (2011), p. 151. Adaptations =Film and television= \\"The Problem of Thor Bridge\\" was adapted as a short silent film titled The Mystery of Thor Bridge in 1923 as part of the Sherlock Holmes film series by Stoll Pictures. It starred Eille Norwood as Sherlock Holmes and Hubert Willis as Dr. Watson. The story was adapted for the Sherlock Holmes 1968 BBC series with Peter Cushing, but the episode is now lost. The story was also dramatised in 1991 in Granada TV's series Sherlock Holmes starring Jeremy Brett with Daniel Massey as Neil Gibson, Celia Gregory as Maria Gibson, and Catherine Russell as Grace Dunbar. A similar framing method is used in Murder, She Wrote, Season 8, Episode 17 (1992) \\"To the Last Will I Grapple with Thee\\". In the 2005 CSI: Crime Scene Investigation episode \\"Who Shot Sherlock?\\" (Season 5, Episode 11), the method of killing was mostly similar, with changes including the chip coming off the gun instead of the stonework (of a fireplace). But rather than a suicide staged to frame one of the suspects, it turned out another suspect had staged the death. The professor in Elementary, Season 1, Episode 9 (2012), has the same motive as Mrs Gibson and a similar framing method. The same cause of death deduced by Holmes in this story is used in the opening sequence of the same series, Season 2, Episode 9 (2013), with the same intent of throwing suspicion on to another party. =Radio= \\"The Problem of Thor Bridge\\" was adapted by Edith Meiser as an episode of the radio series The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes. The episode aired on 16 March 1931, with Richard Gordon as Sherlock Holmes and Leigh Lovell as Dr. Watson.Dickerson (2019), p. 28. Other radio dramatisations of the story aired on 13 June 1936 (with Gordon as Holmes and Harry West as Watson)Dickerson (2019), p. 75. and on the related radio series The New Adventures of Sherlock Holmes on 3 November 1940 and 1 October 1945 (with Basil Rathbone as Holmes and Nigel Bruce as Watson).Dickerson (2019), pp. 96, 180. A radio adaptation titled \\"Thor Bridge\\" aired in 1962 on the BBC Light Programme, with Carleton Hobbs as Sherlock Holmes and Norman Shelley as Dr. Watson. It was dramatised by Michael Hardwick. Robert Ayres played J. Neil Gibson. \\"The Problem of Thor Bridge\\" was dramatised for BBC Radio 4 in 1994 by Bert Coules as part of his complete radio adaptation of the canon, starring Clive Merrison as Holmes and Michael Williams as Watson, and featuring William Hootkins as J. Neil Gibson. In 2012, the story was adapted for radio as part of the Imagination Theatre radio series The Classic Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, with John Patrick Lowrie as Holmes and Lawrence Albert as Watson.

Poole remains at Reason serving as an officer on the organization's board of trustees and director of transportation. Poole founded Reason with Manny Klausner and Tibor Machan. Background Robert Poole founded Reason Foundation and served as its president from 1978 to 2001. Patricia Lynn Scarlett took over as president in 2001, but shortly thereafter resigned to join the Bush administration as assistant secretary for policy, management, and budget at the Department of the Interior.

Privatization Watch is another of the Foundation's privatization publications that is published three to four times per year. Innovators in Action is an annual publication that advocates shrinking the size and scope of government, usually through privatization. Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, former Colorado Gov. Bill Owens wrote columns for this publication in 2007. =Annual Highway Report= Reason Foundation's Annual Highway Report ranks each state's transportation system on cost-effectiveness and efficiency. =Reason magazine= Reason Foundation's primary publication is the magazine, Reason, which was first published in 1968 by Lanny Friedlander, and was originally an infrequently published mimeographed magazine. In 1970, Robert Poole purchased Reason with Manuel S. Klausner and Tibor R. Machan, who set the magazine on a more regular publication schedule. It covers politics, culture, and ideas through a mix of news, analysis, commentary, and reviews. Reason and Reason Online are editorially-independent publications of Reason Foundation. Reason magazine won three Los Angeles Press Club awards in 2008. Policy areas =Privatization= Reason Foundation cofounder Robert Poole \\"is credited as the first person to use the term \\"privatization\\" to refer to the contracting- out of public services and is the author of the first-ever book on municipal privatization, Cutting Back City Hall, published by Universe Books in 1980.\\" The book was very influential, notably, by providing the intellectual support for Margaret Thatcher's privatization efforts in the United Kingdom. Thatcher wrote in the foundation's Annual Privatization Report 2006, \\"State control is fundamentally bad because it denies people the power to choose and the opportunity to bear responsibility for their own actions. Conversely, privatisation shrinks the power of the state and free enterprise enlarges the power of the people.\\"Margaret Thatcher, \\"Rebuilding An Enterprise Society Through Privatisation\\", Annual Privatization Report 2006, p. 7 (http://reason.org/files/d767317fa4806296191436e95f68082a.pdf). The Reason Foundation supports the privatization of (or public-private partnerships for) almost all government functions. Leonard Gilroy, Reason Foundation's director of government reform, describes privatization as \\"a strategy to lower the costs of government and achieve higher performance and better outcomes for tax dollars spent.\\"Leonard Gilroy and Adrian Moore, \\"Ten Principles of Privatization\\" Gilroy also notes that \\"If badly executed, privatization like any other policy can fail. Taxpayers are no better off, and may be worse off, if a service is moved from a government agency to an incompetent or inefficient private business.\\" =Transportation= Reason is engaged in several transportation policy endeavors. Reason Foundation cofounder Robert Poole serves as the director of transportation policy. According to the New York Times, \\"[f]or 17 years, Mr. Poole has been the chief theorist for private solutions to gridlock. His ideas are now embraced by officials from Sacramento to Washington.\\" The Galvin Mobility Project has led to the production of studies on the causes of congestion, such as the book \\"Mobility First: A New Vision for Transportation in a Globally Competitive Twenty-First Century\\" by Reason Foundation's director of urban growth and land use policy, Sam Staley. =Education= Reason Foundation has strongly advocated for education reform ‚Äì namely through expanded school choice initiatives.

According to Reason, the predictions in its first report had proven true: \\"iProvo's total losses are likely to exceed $10 million by the end of this fiscal year ‚Äì and that figure doesn't include the $39.5 million borrowed to launch the project, most of which still needs to be paid back.\\"Reason Foundation Press Release: \\"iProvo Losses at $8 Million and Counting\\" http://www.reason.org/news/iprovo_municipal_wifi_broadband_update_041608.shtml Reason called for the city to \\"cut its losses\\" and sell the network to a private company. Shortly after the 2008 report was issued, the mayor of Provo, Lewis Billings, who had been highly critical of the Reason reports, announced that iProvo would in fact be sold to a private enterprise, Broadweave, for $40 million.Deseret News. \\"iProvo, Broadweave Nearly Close Deal\\" http://deseretnews.com/article/1,5143,700239528,00.html =Climate change= In 2005, Reason magazine's science writer Ronald Bailey wrote a column declaring that climate change is both real and anthropogenic. He wrote, \\"Anyone still holding onto the idea that there is no global warming ought to hang it up. All data sets ‚Äì satellite, surface, and balloon ‚Äì have been pointing to rising global temperatures.\\" In 2006, Bailey wrote an article entitled \\"Confessions of an Alleged ExxonMobil Whore: Actually no one paid me to be wrong about global warming. Or anything else.\\" In the article Bailey explains how increasing public rebuff changed his mind on climate change. =War in Iraq= The Reason Foundation has been critical of the cost of the war in Iraq. Reason magazine's May 2008 cover story, \\"Trillion Dollar War\\",\\"Trillion Dollar War\\" by Veronique de Rugy in Reason magazine http://www.reason.com/news/show/125438.html discussed what it viewed as the dubious ways in which the war in Iraq and Afghanistan have been funded by Congress, the military industrial complex, and the Bush administration. =Health care= On August 25, 2010, Reason TV published a video entitled, \\"Wheat, Weed and Obamacare: How the Commerce Clause Made Congress All- Powerful\\", as part of an effort to question the constitutionality of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA), also known as Obamacare. The video has been credited with popularizing the argument in conservative circles that PPACA's individual mandate to buy health insurance is constitutionally equivalent to requiring consumers to buy particular types of fruits or vegetables. This argument was ultimately articulated by Justice Antonin Scalia, who suggested during oral argument of the PPACA cases that if Congress has the power to require Americans to buy health insurance, then \\"Therefore, you can make people buy broccoli.\\" Bastiat Prize  Reason Foundation‚Äôs Bastiat Prize, which honors writing that ‚Äúbest demonstrates the importance of freedom with originality, wit and eloquence,‚Äù has been awarded to among others Bari Weiss, Radley Balko, Daniel Hannan, Robert Graboyes, Ross Clark, Virginia Postrel, Tom Easton, Bret Stephens, Amit Varma, Jamie Whyte, Tim Harford, Robert Guest, Brian Carney, and Amity Shlaes.

Oath of Presidential Transparency Reason Foundation and a bipartisan group of more than thirty other organizations asked all of the 2008 U.S. presidential candidates to sign a pledge promising that, if elected, they would deliver the most transparent presidency in history and guaranteeing the executive branch would adhere to the concepts of open government. The candidates who signed the oath were: Sen. Barack Obama (D‚ÄìIllinois), Rep. Ron Paul (R‚ÄìTexas), Sen. Sam Brownback (R‚ÄìKansas), former Sen. Mike Gravel (D‚ÄìAlaska), Rep. Dennis Kucinich (D‚ÄìOhio), Libertarian candidate Bob Barr, and John Cox. Reason Foundation's vice president of research Adrian Moore said unironically of the oath, \\"The next president should be committed to transparency and accountability. Redesigning the federal government, so that it is more accountable to taxpayers and businesses, is a nonpartisan issue. Transparency will help produce a government focused on results instead of our current system, which is plagued by secrecy, wasteful spending and pork projects.\\" Then-Senator Barack Obama echoed those sentiments saying, \\"Every American has the right to know how the government spends their tax dollars, but for too long that information has been largely hidden from public view. This historic law will lift the veil of secrecy in Washington and ensure that our government is transparent and accountable to the American people.\\" References External links * * Reason magazine * EDIRC listing (provided by RePEc) * Organizational Profile ‚Äì National Center for Charitable Statistics (Urban Institute) * Profile from Charity Navigator * Profile from Guidestar Category:Organizations established in 1978 Category:Political and economic think tanks in the United States Category:Libertarian think tanks Category:Libertarian organizations based in the United States Category:1978 establishments in California ","title":"Reason Foundation"},{"id":"553426","text":"Ballot Measure 30 of 2004 would have created a surcharge on Oregon's income tax, raised the minimum tax corporations pay in Oregon income taxes, and made other changes to the tax code to increase revenues. Similar to the previous year's defeated Measure 28, it was proposed as a way to avoid state budget cuts caused by a deficit. The measure was defeated in the February 3, 2004 special election, with 418,315 votes in favor, 691,462 votes against. The 2003‚Äì2004 biennium saw continued economic problems for the state of Oregon, including a continuation of high unemployment rates. The recession brought decreased revenues for state coffers, causing budget shortfalls and threatening budget cuts for education, health care, services to senior citizens, and law enforcement. To prevent these cuts, the Oregon Legislature passed a bill enacting several tax increases, and repealing some tax credits. The main tax increase was a tax surcharge, in which taxpayers would be charged an additional percentage of their income tax liability, based on their tax bracket. However, anti-tax activists, collaborating with the state Republican and Libertarian parties, collected enough signatures to require a referendum to approve the law. Especially surprising to some observers was the margin by which the measure was defeated in Multnomah County. Measure 28 had passed in that county, but Measure 30 was defeated there with 58 percent voting no. Some claimed that this was because county voters had passed their own temporary income tax in the wake of Measure 28's defeat and were not interested in bailing out the rest of the state.

In 2008, the museum had a staff of about 400 employees, 125 contractors, 650 volunteers, 91 Holocaust survivors, and 175,000 members. It had local offices in New York City, Boston, Boca Raton, Chicago, Los Angeles, and Dallas. Since its dedication on April 22, 1993, the Museum has had nearly 40 million visitors, including more than 10 million school children, 99 heads of state, and more than 3,500 foreign officials from over 211 countries. The Museum's visitors came from all over the world, and less than 10 percent of the Museum's visitors are Jewish. Its website had 25 million visits in 2008, from an average of 100 countries daily. Thirty-five percent of these visits were from outside the United States. The USHMM's collections contain more than 12,750 artifacts, 49 million pages of archival documents, 85,000 historical photographs, a list of over 200,000 registered survivors and their families, 1,000 hours of archival footage, 93,000 library items, and 9,000 oral history testimonies. It also has teacher fellows in every state in the United States and, since 1994, almost 400 university fellows from 26 countries. Researchers at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum have documented 42,500 ghettos and concentration camps erected by the Nazis throughout German-controlled areas of Europe from 1933 to 1945.Lichtblau, Eric. \\"The Holocaust Just Got More Shocking.\\" The New York Times. March 3, 2013. History =President's Commission on the Holocaust= 14th Street entrance of USHMM Exterior of the museum's entrance On November 1, 1978, President Jimmy Carter established the President's Commission on the Holocaust, chaired by Elie Wiesel, a prominent author, activist, and Holocaust survivor. Its mandate was to investigate the creation and maintenance of a memorial to victims of the Holocaust and an appropriate annual commemoration to them. The mandate was created in a joint effort by Wiesel and Richard Krieger (the original papers are on display at the Jimmy Carter Museum). On September 27, 1979, the Commission presented its report to the President, recommending the establishment of a national Holocaust memorial museum in Washington, D.C. with three main components: a national museum/memorial, an educational foundation, and a Committee on Conscience. After a unanimous vote by the United States Congress in 1980 to establish the museum, the federal government made available of land adjacent to the Washington Monument for construction. Under the original director Richard Krieger, and subsequent director Jeshajahu Weinberg and chairman Miles Lerman, nearly $190 million was raised from private sources for building design, artifact acquisition, and exhibition creation. In October 1988, President Ronald Reagan helped lay the cornerstone of the building, designed by architect James Ingo Freed. Dedication ceremonies on April 22, 1993 included speeches by American President Bill Clinton, Israeli President Chaim Herzog, Chairman Harvey Meyerhoff, and Elie Wiesel. On April 26, 1993, the Museum opened to the general public. Its first visitor was the 14th Dalai Lama of Tibet. = Attacks = The museum has been the target of a planned attack and a fatal shooting. In 2002, a federal jury convicted white supremacists Leo Felton and Erica Chase of planning to bomb a series of institutions associated with American black and Jewish communities, including the USHMM. On June 10, 2009, 88-year-old James von Brunn, an anti-Semite, shot Museum Special Police Officer Stephen Tyrone Johns. Special Police Officer Johns and von Brunn were both seriously wounded and transported by ambulance to the George Washington University Hospital. Special Police Officer Johns later died of his injuries; he is permanently honored in an official memorial at the USHMM. Von Brunn, who had a previous criminal record, died during his criminal trial in federal court, in Butner federal prison in North Carolina. Architecture Designed by the architect James Ingo Freed of Pei Cobb Freed & Partners, in association with Finegold Alexander + Associates Inc, the USHMM is created to be a \\"resonator of memory\\". (Born to a Jewish family in Germany, Freed came to the United States at the age of nine in 1939 with his parents, who fled the Nazi regime.) The outside of the building disappears into the neoclassical, Georgian, and modern architecture of Washington, D.C. Upon entering, each architectural feature becomes a new element of allusion to the Holocaust. In designing the building, Freed researched post-World War II German architecture and visited Holocaust sites throughout Europe. The Museum building and the exhibitions within are intended to evoke deception, fear, and solemnity, in contrast to the comfort and grandiosity usually associated with Washington, D.C. public buildings. Other partners in the construction of the USHMM included Weiskopf & Pickworth, Cosentini Associates LLP, Jules Fisher, and Paul Marantz, all from New York City. The structural engineering firm that was chosen for this project was Severud Associates. The Museum's Meyerhoff Theatre and Rubenstein Auditorium were constructed by Jules Fisher Associates of New York City. The Permanent Exhibition was designed by Ralph Appelbaum Associates.Pei, Cobb, Freed and Partners. Karl Kaufman was the Director of Architecture.

Exhibitions The USHMM contains two exhibitions that have been open continuously since 1993 and numerous rotating exhibitions that deal with various topics related to the Holocaust and human rights. =Hall of Remembrance= Panoramic view of the Hall of Remembrance The Hall of Remembrance is the USHMM's official memorial to the victims and survivors of the Holocaust. Visitors can memorialize the event by lighting candles, visiting an eternal flame, and reflecting in silence in the hexagonal hall. =Permanent Exhibition= Using more than 900 artifacts, 70 video monitors, and four theaters showing historic film footage and eyewitness testimonies, the USHMM's Permanent Exhibition is the most visited exhibit at the Museum. Upon entering large industrial elevators on the first floor, visitors are given identification cards, each of which tells the story of a person such as a random victim or survivor of the Holocaust. Upon exiting these elevators on the fourth floor, visitors walk through a chronological history of the Holocaust, starting with the Nazi rise to power led by Adolf Hitler, 1933‚Äì1939. Topics dealt with include Aryan ideology, Kristallnacht, Antisemitism, and the American response to Nazi Germany. Visitors continue walking to the third floor, where they learn about ghettos and the Final Solution, by which the Nazis tried to exterminate all the Jews of Europe, and they killed six million of them, many in gas chambers. The Permanent Exhibition ends on the second floor with the liberation of Nazi concentration camps by Allied forces; it includes a continuously looped film of Holocaust survivor testimony. First-time visitors spend an average of two to three hours in this self-guided exhibition. Due to certain images and subject matter, it is recommended for visitors 11 years of age and older. To enter the Permanent Exhibition between March and August, visitors must acquire free timed passes from the Museum on the day of the visit, or online for a service fee. =Remember the Children: Daniel's Story= Remember the Children: Daniel's Story is an exhibition designed to explain the Holocaust to elementary and middle school children. Opened in 1993, following true stories about children during the Holocaust. Daniel is named after the son of Isaiah Kuperstein who was the original curator of the exhibit. He worked together with Ann Lewin and Stan Woodward to create the exhibit. Because of its popularity with families, it is still open to the public today. =Stephen Tyrone Johns Memorial= In October 2009, the USHMM unveiled a memorial plaque in honor of Special Police Officer Stephen Tyrone Johns. In response to the outpouring of grief and support after the shooting on June 10, 2009, it has also established the Stephen Tyrone Johns Summer Youth Leadership Program. Each year, 50 outstanding young people from the Washington, D.C. area will be invited to the USHMM to learn about the Holocaust in honor of Johns' memory. =Special exhibitions= Notable special exhibitions have included A Dangerous Lie: The Protocols of the Elders of Zion (2006). Collections The Museum's holdings included art, books, pamphlets, advertisements, maps, film and video historical footage, audio and video oral testimonies, music and sound recordings, furnishings, architectural fragments, models, machinery, tools, microfilm and microfiche of government documents and other official records, personal effects, personal papers, photographs, photo albums, and textiles. This information can be accessed through online databases or by visiting the USHMM. Researchers from all over the world come to the USHMM Library and Archives and the Benjamin and Vladka Meed Registry of Holocaust Survivors. =Museum gallery= File:Special exposition, Holocaust Museum, D.C.

For the 2014-2015 fiscal year, the museum reported total revenues of $133.4 million; $81.9 million and $51.4 million from private and public sources, respectively. Nearly the entirety of private funds come from donations. Expenses totaled of $104.6 million, with a total of $53.5 million used to pay 421 employees. Net assets tallied $436.1 million as of September 30, 2015, of which $319.1 million is classified as long-term investments, including the museum's endowment. =Center for Advanced Holocaust Studies= In 1998, the USHMM established the Center for Advanced Holocaust Studies (CAHS). Working with the Academic Committee of the United States Holocaust Memorial Council, the CAHS supports research projects and publications about the Holocaust (including a partnership with Oxford University Press to publish the scholarly journal Holocaust and Genocide Studies), helps make accessible collections of Holocaust-related archival material, supports fellowship opportunities for pre- and post- doctoral researchers, and hosts seminars, summer research workshops for academics, conferences, lectures, and symposia. The CAHS's Visiting Scholars Program and other events have made the USHMM one of the world's principal venues for Holocaust scholarship. The slogan \\"Arbeit Macht Frei\\" displayed at the Holocaust Memorial Museum in D.C =Committee on Conscience= The Museum contains the offices of the Committee on Conscience (CoC), a joint United States government and privately funded think tank, which by presidential mandate engages in global human rights research. Using the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, approved by the United Nations in 1948 and ratified by the United States in 1988, the CoC has established itself as a leading non-partisan commenter on the Darfur Genocide, as well as the war-torn region of Chechnya in Russia, a zone that the CoC believes could produce genocidal atrocities. The CoC does not have policy- making powers and serves solely as an advisory institution to the American and other governments. =National Days of Remembrance of the Victims of the Holocaust (DRVH)= While standing inside The Hall of Remembrance, located within the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, a volunteer reads the names of Holocaust victims during the Days of Remembrance of the Victims of the Holocaust. In addition to coordinating the National Civic Commemoration, ceremonies and educational programs during the week of the DRVH were regularly held throughout the country, sponsored by Governors, Mayors, veterans groups, religious groups, and military ships and stations throughout the world. Each year, the USHMM designated a special theme for DRVH observances, and prepares materials available at no charge to support observances and programs throughout the nation, and in the United States military. Days of Remembrance themes have included: *2014 ‚Äì Confronting the Holocaust: American Responses *2013 ‚Äì Never Again: Heeding the Warning Signs *2012 ‚Äì Choosing to Act: Stories of Rescue *2011 ‚Äì Justice and Accountability in the Face of Genocide: What Have We Learned? *2010 ‚Äì Stories of Freedom: What You Do Matters *2009 ‚Äì Never Again: What You Do Matters *2008 ‚Äì Do Not Stand Alone: Remembering Kristallnacht *2007 ‚Äì Children in Crisis: Voices From the Holocaust *2006 ‚Äì Legacies of Justice *2005 ‚Äì From Liberation to the Pursuit of Justice *2004 ‚Äì For Justice and Humanity *2003 ‚Äì For Your Freedom and Ours *2002 ‚Äì Memories of Courage *2001 ‚Äì Remembering the Past for the Sake of the Future =National Institute for Holocaust Education= The USHMM conducted several programs devoted to improving Holocaust education. The Arthur and Rochelle Belfer Conference for Teachers, conducted in Washington, D.C., attracted around 200 middle school and secondary teachers from around the United States each year. The Education Division offered workshops around the United States for teachers to learn about the Holocaust, to participate in the Museum Teacher Fellowship Program (MTFP), and to join a national corps of educators who served as leaders in Holocaust education in their schools, communities, and professional organizations. Some MTFP participants also participated in the Regional Education Corps, an initiative to implement Holocaust education on a national level. Since 1999, the USHMM also provided public service professionals, including law enforcement officers, military personnel, civil servants, and federal judges with ethics lessons based in Holocaust history. In partnership with the Anti-Defamation League, more than 21,000 law enforcement officers from worldwide and local law enforcement agencies such as the FBI and local police departments have been trained to act in a professional and democratic manner. =Encyclopedia of Camps and Ghettos= Replica of Auschwitz sign \\"Arbeit Macht Frei\\" which means \\"work will set you free\\" The Encyclopedia of Camps and Ghettos, 1933‚Äì1945 is a seven-part encyclopedia series that explores the history of the concentration camps and the ghettos in German-occupied Europe during the Nazi era. The series is produced by the USHMM and published by the Indiana University Press. The work on the series began in 2000 by the researchers at the USHMM's Center for Advanced Holocaust Studies. Its general editor and project directory is the American historian Geoffrey P. Megargee. As of 2017, two volumes have been issued, with the third being planned for 2018. Volume I covers the early camps that the SA and SS set up in the first year of the Nazi regime, and the camps later run by the SS Economic Administration Main Office and their numerous sub-camps. The volume contains 1,100 entries written by 150 contributors. The bulk of the volume is dedicated to cataloguing the camps, including locations, duration of operation, purpose, perpetrators and victims. Volume II is dedicated to the ghettos in German- occupied Eastern Europe and was published in 2012. =Outreach technology= A dedication plaque outside the Museum A large component of the USHMM was directed towards its website and associated accounts. With a majority of interest coming from the virtual world, the USHMM provided a variety of research tools online. On its website, online exhibitions, the Museum published the Holocaust Encyclopedia‚Äîan online, multilingual encyclopedia detailing the events surrounding the Holocaust. It was published in all six of the official languages of the United Nations‚ÄîArabic, Mandarin, English, French, Russian, and Spanish; as well as in Greek, Portuguese, Persian, Turkish, and Urdu. It contained thousands of entries and includes copies of the identification card profiles that visitors receive at the Permanent Exhibition. The USHMM had partnered with Apple Inc. to publish free podcasts on iTunes about the Holocaust, anti-semitism, and genocide prevention. It also had its own channel on YouTube, an official account on Facebook, a Twitter page, and an e-mail newsletter service. The Genocide Prevention Mapping Initiative was a collaboration between the USHMM and Google Earth. It sought to collect, share, and visually present to the world critical information on emerging crises that may lead to genocide or related crimes against humanity. While this initiative focused on the Darfur Conflict, the Museum wishes to broaden its scope to all human rights violations. The USHMM wanted to build an interactive \\"global crisis map\\" to share and understand information quickly, to \\"see the situation\\" when dealing with human rights abuses, enabling more effective prevention and response by the world. =Traveling exhibitions= Since 1991, the USHMM had created traveling exhibitions to travel all over the United States and the world. These exhibitions have been to over one hundred cities in more than 35 states. It is possible to request and host various subject matters including: \\"The Nazi Olympics: Berlin 1936\\", \\"Nazi Persecution of Homosexuals\\", and others depending on what a community desires. =Elie Wiesel Award= The United States Holocaust Memorial Museum Award was established in 2011 and it \\"recognizes internationally prominent individuals whose actions have advanced the Museum‚Äôs vision of a world where people confront hatred, prevent genocide, and promote human dignity.\\" It has been renamed the Elie Wiesel Award in honor of its first recipient. Winners include: * 2011: Elie Wiesel * 2012: Aung San Suu Kyi (rescinded in 2018 due to the ongoing Rohingya genocide) * 2013: W≈Çadys≈Çaw Bartoszewski and the Veterans of World War II * 2014: Lieutenant-General Rom√©o Dallaire * 2015: Judge Thomas Buergenthal and Benjamin Ferencz * 2016: US Representative John Lewis * 2017: German Chancellor Angela Merkel * 2018: All Holocaust survivors * 2019: Serge and Beate Klarsfeld and Syria Civil Defense =The 2018 survey= In 2018 a survey organized by the Claims Conference, USHMM, and others found that 41% of 1,350 American adults surveyed, and 66% of millennials, did not know what Auschwitz was. 41% of millennials incorrectly claimed that 2 million Jews or less were killed during the Holocaust, while 22% said they had never heard of the Holocaust. Over 95% of all Americans surveyed were unaware that the Holocaust occurred in the Baltic states of Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia. 45% of adults and 49% of millennials weren't able to name a single Nazi concentration camp or ghetto in German-occupied Europe during the Holocaust. Governance The museum is overseen by the United States Holocaust Memorial Council, which includes 55 private citizens appointed by the President of the United States, five members of the United States Senate, and five members of the House of Representatives, and three ex- officio members from the Departments of State, the Education, and the Interior.\\"United States Holocaust Memorial Museum\\".

The result was a victory for the opposition United Progressive Party (UPP), which defeated the incumbent Antigua Labour Party. Baldwin Spencer, leader of the UPP, replaced Lester Bird as Prime Minister of Antigua and Barbuda, with Bird being one of eight Labour MPs to lose his seat. Spencer became only the second Prime Minister from outside the Bird family or the Labour Party. Bird had been Prime Minister since 1994, when he succeeded his father, Vere Bird, who had been Prime Minister from independence in 1981, having previously served as Chief Minister or Premier of Antigua since 1960 with the exception of the 1971‚Äì1976 period. Campaign The Bird family was widely accused of corruption and nepotism. The Jamaica Observer noted that \\"Bird's government had been badly damaged by scandals that in recent years have centred on allegations of bribery, misuse of funds in the national health insurance plan, and a 13-year-old girl's charges that he and his brother used her for sex and to procure cocaine. Bird, 72, denied the last charges and organised an inquiry that found no evidence.\\" Bird's brother, Vere Bird, Jr., was accused of involvement with the Medellin drug cartel in 1989. He lost his Cabinet post, but was not prosecuted. Conduct An observer team from the Caribbean Community praised the peaceful vote and said the results \\"clearly reflect the will of the people\\". Among recommendations, it urged the Electoral Commission to strengthen its independence. Previous elections in Antigua and Barbuda had been followed by allegations of electoral irregularities favouring the government. Results The vote in the seat of Barbuda ended in a draw between the Barbuda People's Movement, an ally of the UPP, and the Barbuda People's Movement for Change, an ally of the ALP, with each candidate receiving 400 votes. A by-election was held on 20 April, which saw Trevor Walker of the BPM elected, with 408 votes against 394 for the BPMC candidate, Arthur Nibbs.Antigua and Barbuda: 2004 election results Caribbean Elections References Category:Elections in Antigua and Barbuda Antigua General election ","title":"2004 Antiguan general election"},{"id":"553438","text":"Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (, ), commonly known as BUET (; ), is a public university in Bangladesh, which focuses on the study of engineering and architecture. Founded in 1912, it is the oldest institution for the study of engineering (initially it was a diploma school), architecture and urban planning in Bangladesh. The university campus is located at the Palashi area of Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh. With the construction of new academic buildings, an auditorium complex, a cafeteria and halls of residence, the university has continued to expand over the last three decades. History Dacca Survey School was established in 1876 as a survey school at Nalgola, west of the current Sir Salimullah Medical College campus, in Old Dhaka by the then Government of Bengal under British Raj. It offered a survey course of two years to train land surveyors, at the end of which students competed at the Sub-Overseer's examination. According to a report on public instruction in Bengal, on 31 March 1903, Dacca Survey School had 117 students of which 103 were Hindus and 14 were Muslims. In 1908, the school started to offer diploma degrees. Nawab Sir Khwaja Ahsanullah Bahadur, a philanthropist and Nawab of Dhaka, endowed donations for developing the survey school. After his death in 1901, his son, the then Nawab of Dhaka, Sir Khwaja Salimullah Bahadur released the grant in 1902 in accordance with his late fathers wish. As an acknowledgement of this contribution, the school was renamed to Ahsanullah School of Engineering in 1908. The school offered three-year long diploma courses in civil engineering, electrical engineering and mechanical engineering in 1908. In 1912, the university was moved to its present premises. In 1938, A. K. Fazlul Huq, the then Prime Minister of Bengal, appointed Hakim Ali as the principal of the school. After the partition of India in 1947, Chief Minister of East Bengal Sir Khwaja Nazimuddin approved the school to be upgraded to Ahsanullah Engineering College, as a Faculty of Engineering under the University of Dhaka, offering four-year bachelor's course in civil, electrical, mechanical, chemical and metallurgical engineering. In 1948, the Government of East Bengal granted recognition to the engineering college. Ali became the first principal of the college. In 1951, TH Mathewman was appointed the next principal. M. A. Rashid succeeded him in 1954 as the first Bengali principal of the college and held the post until 1960. In 1956, a new course curriculum and the semester system were introduced at the college. On 1 June 1962, in order to create facilities for postgraduate studies and research, the college was upgraded to East Pakistan University of Engineering and Technology (EPUET), becoming the fourth university of the then East Pakistan. Rashid was appointed the first vice-chancellor of the university. A partnership with the Agricultural and Mechanical College of Texas (renamed Texas A&M; University) was forged, and professors from A&M; came to teach and formulate the curriculum. During this period, EPUET offered courses in mechanical, electrical, civil, metallurgical, and chemical engineering, and architecture. After the liberation war of 1971, and Bangladesh's independence, EPUET was renamed to Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET). Several other departments offer graduate and undergraduate courses in different subjects: Water resources engineering, Urban and regional planning, Naval architecture and marine engineering, Industrial and production engineering, Petroleum and mineral resources engineering, Computer science and engineering, Glass and ceramic engineering, and Biomedical engineering. These courses were all added to the university at different times. In 2007, BUET celebrated 60 years (1947‚Äì2007) of engineering education in Bangladesh by arranging a 6-month-long series of programs and events. Academics =Faculties and departments= Academic activities are undertaken by 18 departments under five faculties. Twelve departments offer undergraduate courses.

After completion of higher secondary level (HSC) education, a student can submit her or his application for undergraduate admission if he/she fulfills the minimum requirements. The students with the best grades in Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, English & Bengali on their Higher Secondary School Certificate (HSC) examination are allowed to take the admission test. The screening process allows 12,161 students to sit for the admission test based on the cumulative sum of their GPA in those five subjects. After the competitive admission test, only about 1060 students get selected on the basis of merit and are offered admission. However, for admission to the M.S. and PhD programs, candidates are required to appear in interviews and/or written tests. The admission test is of 600 marks, with 60 questions carrying 10 marks each. 20 questions are from Physics, 20 from Chemistry and 20 from Mathematics. There are 26 seats for foreign students at the undergraduate level. The pre-requisite qualification for admission is HSC or GCE A-level or its equivalent with high grades in Mathematics, Physics, and Chemistry. The admission fee is $200; the course registration fee is US$50 per credit hour and the approximate cost of food, lodging etc. is US$100 per month. A maximum of 10 students from a single country are allowed for admission. =Postgraduate= Every year, around 1060 students get accepted to undergraduate programs in Engineering, Architecture, and Urban Planning. From an initial application pool of over 112,500 applicants, 12,161 candidates are selected to appear in the undergraduate admission test. Only about the top 1060 are then selected on the basis of merit and are offered admission (Engineering & Urban Planning=1005 seats and Architecture=55 seats). In Masters and PhD programs, around 1000 graduate students are accepted on an annual basis. Postgraduate degrees offered by departments and institutes are MSc (Master of Science), MSc Engg. (Master of Science in Engineering), M. Engg (Master of Engineering), MURP (Master of Urban and Regional Planning), MArch (Master of Architecture), M.Phil. (Master of Philosophy) and PhD (Doctor of Philosophy). Postgraduate diplomas (PG. Dip.) are also offered in IT and Water resources development. Research programs For consultation and research the expertise at the university, its teachers and the laboratory facilities are available to other organizations of the country. A separate institution ‚Äì Bureau of Research, Testing and Consultation (BRTC) has been formed to oversee these activities. The university undertakes research programs sponsored by outside organizations like United Nations Organizations, Commonwealth Foundation, European Union, University Grants Commission (Bangladesh), World Bank, Asian Development Bank, DfID, JICA etc. =Conferences and workshops= BUET regularly organizes national and international conferences and workshops in its campus to enhance the research capabilities of its students and faculties. Among the conferences organized by BUET, following are notable. Student life =Halls of residence= Sabekunnahar Sony Memorial Sculpture, beside Titumir Hall BUET Auditorium Complex Titumir Hall, one of the eight dormitories of the university There are eight residence halls to provide housing for BUET students. The Shahid Smriti Hall is reserved for young teachers who do not have an official quarter in the campus and for the male graduate students. The Chatri Hall is for female students, and the remaining six halls are for male students studying at the undergraduate level. These halls were built in different periods of time, and their designs bear the history and architecture of different times.. The administrative head of a residence hall is its provost, usually chosen from the senior teachers of different faculties. 3 Assistant Provosts are also appointed in the hall administration. Most of the halls are named after several eminent figures in the history of Bangladesh. These are listed below: * Ahsanullah Hall (named after Nawab of Dhaka, Nawab Bahadur Sir Khwaja Ahsanullah) * Titumir Hall (named after Bengali Muslim revolutionary Syed Mir Nisar Ali Titumir) * Chatri Hall * Dr. M. A. Rashid Hall (named after M. A. Rashid, the first vice-chancellor of the university) * Kazi Nazrul Islam Hall (named after the National Poet of Bangladesh Kazi Nazrul Islam) * Sher-e-Bangla Hall (named after the 1st Prime Minister of Bengal- Sher-e-Bangla A. K. Fazlul Huq) * Suhrawardy Hall (named after the Bengali-nationalist leader and 5th Prime-minister of Pakistan Huseyn Shaheed Suhrawardy) * Shahid Smriti Hall (named in memory of martyrs of the Bangladesh Liberation War) Students who do not stay at halls of residence are facilitated by the university's own commuter buses which cover major routes of Dhaka city. =Sports facilities= Playground of BUET BUET has a large playground at the eastern periphery of main academic campus. It is used as venue of annual athletics competition of the university as well as cricket, football, hockey competitions. Students can access the facility all year round. Besides, visiting foreign national football teams as well as few top football clubs of Bangladesh sometimes use this ground for practice sessions. BUET has tennis court in the main academic area. It also has a gymnasium near halls of residence where students can do gymnastics and play basketball during leisure Safety In 2002, a first year student in the chemical engineering department, Sony, was killed during a factional clash between two feuding groups of the Jatiyatabadi Chhatra Dal (JCD) at BUET. The two factions exchanged gunfire and she was caught in the line of fire.https://bdnews24.com/politics/2005/06/07/sony-s-death-anniversary- observedtitle=Sony's death anniversary observeddate=7 June 2005access-date= 21 April 2020publisher=BDNEWS}} Abrar Fahad, a second year student of Electrical and Electronic Engineering (EEE) department, was tortured and killed by Bangladesh Chhatra League leaders in Sher-e-Bangla Hall in 2019. 26 students from various departments were expelled for life by the university authority for allegedly being involved in the killing.

It was first published in the UK by G. Newnes Ltd., and was published in the US by Harper & Brothers in February 1894. It was the second collection featuring the consulting detective Sherlock Holmes, following The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes. Like the first it was illustrated by Sidney Paget. The twelve stories were originally published in The Strand Magazine from December 1892 to December 1893 as The Adventures number 13 to 24. For instance, \\"The Final Problem\\" was published under the subheading \\"XXIV.‚ÄîThe Adventure of the Final Problem.\\"\\" _The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes_. XXIV.‚ÄîThe Adventure of the Final Problem\\". The Strand Magazine, vol. 6, pp. 559‚Äì70. Bound volume 6 viewed at HathiTrust Digital Library. Retrieved 25 July 2019. Unnumbered page 558 is the December 1893 frontispiece, which illustrates this story. Artist Sidney Paget is credited in the volume Index. Doyle determined that these would be the last Holmes stories, and intended to kill off the character in \\"The Final Problem\\". Reader demand stimulated him to write another Holmes novel in 1901‚Äì1902, The Hound of the Baskervilles, set before \\"The Final Problem\\". Next year a new series, The Return of Sherlock Holmes, begins with the aftermath of \\"The Final Problem\\", in which it is revealed that Holmes actually survived. Contents The sequence of stories matches that of the magazine series, December 1892 to December 1893, when \\"The Adventure of the Naval Treaty\\" was published in two parts, October and November. # \\"The Adventure of Silver Blaze\\" # \\"The Adventure of the Cardboard Box\\" ‚Äì not in the first edition, nor many other eds. # \\"The Adventure of the Yellow Face\\" # \\"The Adventure of the Stockbroker's Clerk\\" # \\"The Adventure of the Gloria Scott\\" # \\"The Adventure of the Musgrave Ritual\\" # \\"The Adventure of the Reigate Squire\\" # \\"The Adventure of the Crooked Man\\" # \\"The Adventure of the Resident Patient\\" # \\"The Adventure of the Greek Interpreter\\" # \\"The Adventure of the Naval Treaty\\" # \\"The Final Problem\\" =Omissions of \\"The Adventure of the Cardboard Box\\"= The first London edition of the Memoirs in 1894 did not include \\"The Adventure of the Cardboard Box\\", although all twelve stories had appeared in the Strand Magazine. The first U.S. edition included the story, but it was very quickly replaced with a revised edition that omitted it. The reasoning behind the suppression is unclear. In Britain the story was apparently removed at Doyle's request as it included adultery and so was unsuitable for younger readers. This may have also been the cause for the rapid removal of the story from the U.S. edition, and some sources state that the publishers believed the story was too scandalous for the American public. As a result, this story was not republished in the U.S. until many years later, when it was added to His Last Bow. Even today, most American editions of the canon include it with His Last Bow, while most British editions keep the story in its original place in The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes. Additionally, when the story was removed from the Memoirs, its opening pages, where Holmes emulates Dupin, were transferred to the beginning of \\"The Adventure of the Resident Patient\\". In some later U.S. editions of the Memoirs, which still omit \\"The Adventure of the Cardboard Box\\", this transfer still appears. Adaptations The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes (apart from \\"The Cardboard Box\\") were adapted for BBC Radio 4 in 1991‚Äì1992 as part of Bert Coules' complete radio adaptation of the canon, starring Clive Merrison as Holmes and Michael Williams as Watson. Notable guest stars included Peter Davison as Inspector Forrester in \\"The Reigate Squires\\", and Brian Blessed as Henry Wood in \\"The Crooked Man\\". Episodes were written by Bert Coules, Gerry Jones, Denys Hawthorne, Vincent McInerney, Peter Mackie, Robert Forrest, Peter Ling, and David Ashton, and directed by Enyd Williams and Patrick Rayner. Six of the stories were adapted into The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes (including \\"The Cardboard Box\\") for Granada Television in 1994, starring Jeremy Brett as Holmes and Edward Hardwicke as Watson.https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0108855/ References External links  * * Sherlock Holmes Cases A compilation of some of the most famous Sherlock Holmes cases.

This white solid is a trimer of cyanamide, with a 1,3,5-triazine skeleton. Like cyanamide, it contains 67% nitrogen by mass, and its derivatives have fire retardant properties due to its release of nitrogen gas when burned or charred. Melamine can be combined with formaldehyde and other agents to produce melamine resins. Such resins are characteristically durable thermosetting plastic used in high pressure decorative laminates such as Formica, melamine dinnerware, laminate flooring, and dry erase boards. Melamine foam is used as insulation, soundproofing material and in polymeric cleaning products, such as Magic Eraser. Melamine is sometimes illegally added to food products in order to increase the apparent protein content. Ingestion of melamine may lead to reproductive damage, or bladder or kidney stones, and bladder cancer. It is also an irritant when inhaled or in contact with the skin or eyes. The United Nations' food standards body, the Codex Alimentarius Commission, has set the maximum amount of melamine allowed in powdered infant formula to 1 mg/kg and the amount of the chemical allowed in other foods and animal feed to 2.5 mg/kg. While not legally binding, the levels allow countries to ban importation of products with excessive levels of melamine.  Etymology  The German word Melamin was coined by combining the words Melam (a derivative of ammonium thiocyanate) and amine. Melamine is, therefore, unrelated etymologically to the root melas (ŒºŒµŒªŒ±œÇ, meaning \\"black\\" in Greek), from which the words melanin, a pigment, and melatonin, a hormone, are formed.  Uses  In one large scale application, melamine is combined with formaldehyde and other agents to produce melamine resins. Such resins are characteristically durable thermosetting plastic used in high pressure decorative laminates such as Formica, melamine dinnerware, laminate flooring, and dry erase boards. Melamine foam is used as insulation, soundproofing material and in polymeric cleaning products, such as Magic Eraser. Melamine is one of the major components in Pigment Yellow 150, a colorant in inks and plastics. Melamine also enters the fabrication of melamine poly-sulfonate used as superplasticizer for making high-resistance concrete. Sulfonated melamine formaldehyde (SMF) is a polymer used as cement admixture to reduce the water content in concrete while increasing the fluidity and the workability of the mix during its handling and pouring. It results in concrete with a lower porosity and a higher mechanical strength, exhibiting an improved resistance to aggressive environments and a longer lifetime. The use of melamine as fertilizer for crops had been envisioned during the 1950s and 1960s because of its high nitrogen content (2/3). However, melamine is much more expensive to produce than are other common nitrogen fertilizers, such as urea. The mineralization (degradation to ammonia) for melamine is slow, making this product both economically and scientifically impractical for use as a fertilizer. Melamine dinnerware Melamine and its salts are used as fire- retardant additives in paints, plastics, and paper.Ashford, Robert D. (2011) Ashford's Dictionary of Industrial Chemicals, 3rd ed. Wavelength. p. 5713. . A melamine fibre, Basofil, has low thermal conductivity, excellent flame resistance and is self-extinguishing; this makes it useful for flame-resistant protective clothing, either alone or as a blend with other fibres. Melamine derivatives of arsenical drugs are potentially important in the treatment of African trypanosomiasis. Melamine use as non-protein nitrogen (NPN) for cattle was described in a 1958 patent.Colby, Robert W. and Mesler, Robert J. Jr. (1958) \\"Ruminant feed compositions\\". In 1978, however, a study concluded that melamine \\"may not be an acceptable non-protein N source for ruminants\\" because its hydrolysis in cattle is slower and less complete than other nitrogen sources such as cottonseed meal and urea. Melamine is sometimes illegally added to food products in order to increase the apparent protein content. Standard tests, such as the Kjeldahl and Dumas tests, estimate protein levels by measuring the nitrogen content, so they can be misled by adding nitrogen- rich compounds such as melamine. There are instruments available today which can differentiate melamine nitrogen from protein nitrogen.  Toxicity  The short-term lethal dose of melamine is on a par with common table salt with an LD50 of more than 3 grams per kilogram of bodyweight. U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) scientists explained that when melamine and cyanuric acid are absorbed into the bloodstream, they concentrate and interact in the urine- filled renal tubules, then crystallize and form large numbers of round, yellow crystals, which in turn block and damage the renal cells that line the tubes, causing the kidneys to malfunction. The European Union set a standard for acceptable human consumption (tolerable daily intake or TDI) of melamine at 0.2 mg per kg of body mass, (previously 0.5 milligrams), Canada declared a limit of 0.35 mg and the US FDA's limit was put at 0.063 mg daily (previously 0.63 mg). The World Health Organization's food safety director estimated that the amount of melamine a person could stand per day without incurring a bigger health risk, the TDI, was 0.2 mg per kg of body mass. Toxicity of melamine can be mediated by intestinal microbiota. In culture, Klebsiella terrigena, which rarely colonizes mammalian intestines, was shown to convert melamine to cyanuric acid directly. Rats colonized by K. terrigena showed greater melamine-induced kidney damage compared to those not colonized. = Acute toxicity = Melamine is reported to have an oral median lethal dose (LD50) of 3248 mg/kg based on rat data. It is also an irritant when inhaled or in contact with the skin or eyes. The reported dermal LD50 is >1000 mg/kg for rabbits. A study by Soviet researchers in the 1980s suggested that melamine cyanurate, commonly used as a fire retardant, could be more toxic than either melamine or cyanuric acid alone. For rats and mice, the reported LD50 for melamine cyanurate was 4.1 g/kg (given inside the stomach) and 3.5 g/kg (via inhalation), compared to 6.0 and 4.3 g/kg for melamine and 7.7 and 3.4 g/kg for cyanuric acid, respectively. A toxicology study in animals conducted after recalls of contaminated pet food concluded that the combination of melamine and cyanuric acid in diet does lead to acute kidney injury in cats. A 2008 study produced similar experimental results in rats and characterized the melamine and cyanuric acid in contaminated pet food from the 2007 outbreak. A 2010 study from Lanzhou University attributed kidney failure in humans to uric acid stone accumulation after ingestion of melamine resulting in a rapid aggregation of metabolites such as cyanuric acid diamide (ammeline) and cyanuric acid. A 2013 study demonstrated that melamine can be metabolized to cyanuric acid by gut bacteria. In particular, Klebsiella terrigena was determined to be a factor in melamine toxicity. In culture, K. terrigena was shown to convert melamine to cyanuric acid directly. Cyanuric acid was detected in the kidneys of rats administered melamine alone, and the concentration after Klebsiella colonization was increased. = Chronic toxicity = Ingestion of melamine may lead to reproductive damage, or bladder or kidney stones, which can lead to bladder cancer.OSHA ‚Äì Chemical sampling informationWHO ‚Äì Some Chemicals that Cause Tumors of the Kidney or Urinary Bladder in Rodents and Some Other Substances A study in 1953 reported that dogs fed 3% melamine for a year had the following changes in their urine: (1) reduced specific gravity, (2) increased output, (3) melamine crystalluria, and (4) protein and occult blood.Tusing, T.W. \\"Chronic Feeding ‚Äì Dogs\\", cited by \\"Summary of toxicity data ‚Äì trichloromelamine\\" by California Environmental Protection Agency, last revised on February 4, 2002, URL Retrieved September 5, 2007 A survey commissioned by the American Association of Veterinary Laboratory Diagnosticians suggested that crystals formed in the kidneys when melamine combined with cyanuric acid, \\"don't dissolve easily. They go away slowly, if at all, so there is the potential for chronic toxicity.\\" =Metabolism= Melamine is a metabolite of cyromazine, a pesticide. It has been reported that cyromazine can also be converted to melamine in plants. = Treatment of urolithiasis = Fast diagnosis and treatment of acute obstructive urolithiasis may prevent the development of acute kidney failure. Urine alkalinization and stone liberalization have been reported to be the most effective treatments in humans.  Regulation in food and feed  The United Nations' food standards body, Codex Alimentarius Commission, has set the maximum amount of melamine allowed in powdered infant formula to 1 mg/kg and the amount of the chemical allowed in other foods and animal feed to 2.5 mg/kg. While not legally binding, the levels allow countries to ban importation of products with excessive levels of melamine.  Synthesis and reactions Melamine was first synthesized by the German chemist Justus von Liebig in 1834. In early production, first calcium cyanamide was converted into dicyandiamide, which was heated above its melting temperature to produce melamine. Today most industrial manufacturers use urea in the following reaction to produce melamine: : 6 (NH2)2CO ‚Üí C3H6N6 \\\\+ 6 NH3 \\\\+ 3 CO2 In the first step, urea decomposes into cyanic acid and ammonia: : (NH2)2CO ‚Üí HNCO + NH3 Cyanic acid polymerizes to cyanuric acid, which condenses with the liberated ammonia forming melamine. The released water reacts with cyanic acid, which helps to drive the reaction: : 6 HNCO + 3 NH3 ‚Üí C3H6N6 \\\\+ 3 CO2 \\\\+ 3NH3 The above reaction can be carried out by either of two methods: catalyzed gas-phase production or high pressure liquid-phase production. In one method, molten urea is introduced onto a fluidized bed with catalyst for reaction. Hot ammonia gas is also present to fluidize the bed and inhibit deammonization. The effluent then is cooled. Ammonia and carbon dioxide in the off-gas are separated from the melamine-containing slurry. The slurry is further concentrated and crystallized to yield melamine. Major manufacturers and licensors such as Orascom Construction Industries, BASF, and Eurotecnica have developed some proprietary methods. The off-gas contains large amounts of ammonia. Therefore, melamine production is often integrated into urea production, which uses ammonia as feedstock. Crystallization and washing of melamine generates a considerable amount of waste water, which may be concentrated into a solid (1.5‚Äì5% of the weight) for easier disposal. The solid may contain approximately 70% melamine, 23% oxytriazines (ammeline, ammelide, and cyanuric acid), 0.7% polycondensates (melem, melam, and melon). In the Eurotecnica process, however, there is no solid waste and the contaminants are decomposed to ammonia and carbon dioxide and sent as off gas to the upstream urea plant; accordingly, the waste water can be recycled to the melamine plant itself or used as clean cooling water make-up.\\"How a golden chemical became greeneer\\", Nitrogen+Syngas, Issue 293, May‚ÄìJune 2008. Melamine reacts with acid and related compounds to form melamine cyanurate and related crystal structures, which have been implicated as contaminants or biomarkers in Chinese protein adulterations. Drug derivatives Melamine is part of the core structure for a number of drugs including almitrine, altretamine, cyromazine, ethylhexyl triazone, iscotrizinol, meladrazine, melarsomine, melarsoprol, tretamine, trinitrotriazine, and others.  Production in mainland China  Between the late 1990s and early 2000s, both consumption and production of melamine grew considerably in mainland China. By early 2006, melamine production in mainland China is reported to be in \\"serious surplus\\". Between 2002 and 2007, while the global melamine price remained stable, a steep increase in the price of urea (feedstock for melamine) has reduced the profitability of melamine manufacturing. Currently, China is the world's largest exporter of melamine, while its domestic consumption still grows by 10% per year. However, reduced profit has already caused other joint melamine ventures to be postponed there. Surplus melamine has been an adulterant for feedstock and milk in mainland China for several years now because it can make diluted or poor quality material appear to be higher in protein content by elevating the total nitrogen content detected by some simple protein tests. Actions taken in 2008 by the Government of China have reduced the practice of adulteration, with the goal of eliminating it. Court trials began in December 2008 for six people linked to the scandal and ended in January 2009 with two of the convicts being sentenced to death and executed.  Melamine poisoning by tainted food  Melamine has been involved in several food recalls after the discovery of severe kidney damage to children and pets poisoned by melamine-adulterated food. = 2007 Animal feed recalls = In 2007, a pet food recall was initiated by Menu Foods and other pet food manufacturers who had found their products had been contaminated and caused serious illnesses or deaths in some of the animals that had eaten them.Dry food added to pet food recall list. CNN. March 30, 2007Press release by Natural Balance Pet Foods In March 2007, the US Food and Drug Administration reported finding white granular melamine in the pet food, in samples of white granular wheat gluten imported from a single source in China, Xuzhou Anying Biologic TechnologyMelamine Pet Food Recall ‚Äì Frequently Asked Questions. FDA.gov (Updated October 7, 2009) as well as in crystalline form in the kidneys and in urine of affected animals. Further vegetable protein imported from China was later implicated. In April 2007, The New York Times reported that the addition of \\"melamine scrap\\" into fish and livestock feed to give the false appearance of a higher level of protein was an \\"open secret\\" in many parts of mainland China, reporting that this melamine scrap was being produced by at least one plant processing coal into melamine. Four days later, the New York Times reported that, despite the widely reported ban on melamine use in vegetable proteins in mainland China, at least some chemical manufacturers continued to report selling it for use in animal feed and in products for human consumption. Li Xiuping, a manager at Henan Xinxiang Huaxing Chemical in Henan Province, stated, \\"Our chemical products are mostly used for additives, not for animal feed. Melamine is mainly used in the chemical industry, but it can also be used in making cakes.\\" Shandong Mingshui Great Chemical Group, the company reported by the New York Times as producing melamine from coal, produces and sells both urea and melamine but does not list melamine resin as a product. Another recall incident in 2007 involved melamine which had been purposely added as a binder to fish and livestock feed manufactured in the United States. This was traced to suppliers in Ohio and Colorado. = 2008 Chinese outbreak = In September 2008, several companies, including Nestl√©, were implicated in a scandal involving milk and infant formula which had been adulterated with melamine, leading to kidney stones and other kidney failure, especially among young children. By December 2008, nearly 300,000 people had become ill, with more than 50,000 infant hospitalizations and six infant deaths.Scott McDonald, \\"Nearly 53,000 Chinese children sick from milk\\", Associated Press (September 22, 2008) Jane Macartney, China baby milk scandal spreads as sick toll rises to 13,000, The Times (September 22, 2008) In a study published in the New England Journal of Medicine, it was reported that melamine exposure increased the incidence of urinary tract stones by seven times in children. Melamine may have been added to fool government protein content tests after water was added to fraudulently dilute the milk. Because of melamine's high nitrogen content (66% by mass versus approximately 10‚Äì12% for typical protein), it can cause the protein content of food to appear higher than the true value. Officials estimate that about 20% of the dairy companies tested in China sell products tainted with melamine. On January 22, 2009, three of those involved in the scandal (including one conditional sentence) were sentenced to death in a Chinese court. In October 2008, \\"Select Fresh Brown Eggs\\" exported to Hong Kong from the Hanwei Group in Dalian in northeastern China were found to be contaminated with nearly twice the legal limit of melamine. York Chow, the health secretary of Hong Kong, said he thought animal feeds might be the source of the contamination and announced that the Hong Kong Centre for Food Safety would henceforward be testing all mainland Chinese pork, farmed fish, animal feed, chicken meat, eggs, and offal products for melamine. As of July 2010, Chinese authorities were still reporting some seizures of melamine-contaminated dairy product in some provinces, though it was unclear whether these new contaminations constituted wholly new adulterations or were the result of illegal reuse of material from the 2008 adulterations. On characterization and treatment of urinary stones in affected infants, The New England Journal of Medicine printed an editorial in March 2009, along with reports on cases from Beijing, Hong Kong and Taipei. Urinary calculi specimens were collected from 15 cases treated in Beijing and were analyzed as unknown objects for their components at Beijing Institute of Microchemistry using infrared spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance, and high performance liquid chromatography. The result of the analysis showed that the calculus was composed of melamine and uric acid, and the molecular ratio of uric acid to melamine was around 2:1. In a 2009 study of 683 children diagnosed in Beijing in 2008 with nephrolithiasis and 6,498 children without nephrolithiasis aged < 3 years, investigators found that in children exposed to melamine levels < 0.2 mg/kg per day, the risk for nephrolithiasis was 1.7 times higher than in those without melamine exposure, suggesting that the risk of melamine-induced nephrolithiasis in young children starts at a lower intake level than the levels recommended by the World Health Organization. In a study published in 2010, researchers from Beijing University studying ultrasound images of infants who fell ill in the 2008 contamination found that while most children in a rural Chinese area recovered, 12 per cent still showed kidney abnormalities six months later. \\"The potential for long-term complications after exposure to melamine remains a serious concern,\\" the report said. \\"Our results suggest a need for further follow-up of affected children to evaluate the possible long-term impact on health, including renal function.\\" Another 2010 follow-up study from Lanzhou University attributed the uric acid stone accumulation after ingestion of melamine to a rapid aggradation of metabolites such as cyanuric acid diamide (ammeline) and cyanuric acid and reported that urine alkalinization and stone liberalization were the most effective treatments. Until the 2007 pet food recalls, melamine had not routinely been monitored in food, except in the context of plastic safety or insecticide residue. Following the deaths of children in China from powdered milk in 2008, the Joint Research Centre (JRC) of the European in Belgium set up a website about methods to detect melamine. In May 2009, the JRC published the results of a study that benchmarked the ability of labs around the world to accurately measure melamine in food. The study concluded that the majority of labs can effectively detect melamine in food.Breidbach, A., Bouten, K., Kroger, K., Ulberth, F. \\"Melamine Proficiency Test 2009\\". ec.europa.eu In October 2008, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued new methods for the analysis of melamine and cyanuric acid in infant formulations in the Laboratory Information Bulletin No 4421.U.S. FDA Laboratory Information Bulletin No 4421 ‚Äì Similar recommendations have been issued by other authorities, like the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare,Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare. forth.go.jp both based on liquid chromatography ‚Äì mass spectrometry (LC/MS) detection after hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) separation.Zwitterionic HILIC separation of melamine and cyanuric acid ‚Äì The existing methods for melamine determination using a triple quadrupole liquid chromatography ‚Äì mass spectrometry (LC/MS) after solid phase extraction (SPE) are often complex and time-consuming. However, electrospray ionization methods coupled with mass spectrometry allow a rapid and direct analysis of samples with complex matrices: the native liquid samples are directly ionized under ambient conditions in their original solution. In December 2008, two new fast and inexpensive methods for detecting melamine in liquids have been published. Ultrasound-assisted extractive electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (EESI-MS) has been developed at ETH Zurich (Switzerland) by Zhu, Chingin et al., (2008) for a rapid detection of melamine in untreated food samples. Ultrasounds are used to nebulize the melamine-containing liquids into a fine spray. The spray is then ionised by extractive electrospray ionisation (EESI) and analysed using tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). An analysis requires 30 seconds per sample. The limit of detection of melamine is a few nanograms of melamine per gram of milk. Huang et al. (2008) have also developed at Purdue University (US) a simpler instrumentation and a faster method by using a low- temperature plasma probe to ionize the samples. The major obstacles being solved, the ESI-MS technique allows now high-throughput analysis of melamine traces in complex mixtures. The MelaminometerMelaminometer was a hypothetical design for a synthetic biology circuit, to be used for detecting melamine and related chemical analogues such as cyanuric acid. The conceptual project is hosted at OpenWetWare as open source biology in collaboration with DIYbio and has been discussed in various newspapers in the context of homebrew biotechnology. As of October 2009, the design has not been verified. Because melamine resin is often used in food packaging and tableware, melamine at ppm level (1 part per million) in food and beverage has been reported due to migration from melamine-containing resins. Small amounts of melamine have also been reported in foodstuff as a metabolite product of cyromazine, an insecticide used on animals and crops. The Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) provides a test method for analyzing cyromazine and melamine in animal tissues. In 2007, the FDA began using a high performance liquid chromatography test to determine the melamine, ammeline, ammelide, and cyanuric acid contamination in food. Another procedure is based on surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS). Member states of the European Union are required under Commission Decision 2008/757/ECEuropean Commission decision (2008/798/EC) imposing special conditions governing the import of products containing milk or milk products originating from China to ensure that all composite products containing at least 15% of milk product, originating from China, are systematically tested before import into the Community and that all such products which are shown to contain melamine in excess of 2.5 mg/kg are immediately destroyed. Detection in biological specimens The presence of melamine in urine specimens from children who consumed adulterated milk products has been determined by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry.  Melamine on metal surfaces  It is reported that melamine molecules adsorbed on gold or silver surface tend to arrange into honeycomb or closed-packed structures. Such a self-assembly occurs due to the inter-molecular hydrogen bond interaction. This ordering was further investigated using classical Monte Carlo and DFT methods.

Based on Grumman's earlier F9F Panther, the Cougar replaced the Panther's straight wing with a more modern swept wing. Thrust was also increased. The Navy considered the Cougar an updated version of the Panther, despite having a different official name, and thus Cougars started off from F9F-6. Design and development =Early development= A swept-wing F9F-6 Cougar (foreground) and a straight-wing F9F-5 Panther in flight Rumors that the Soviet Union had produced a swept-wing fighter had circulated a year before the Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-15 first appeared at air shows in 1949. Despite the level of activity taking place with swept-wing aircraft, the Navy was not initially focused on the development of such aircraft. This was largely because the Navy's focus at the time was defending the battle group against high speed, high altitude bombers with interceptors, as well as escorting medium-range carrier-based bombers in all weather conditions. Air-to-air combat was of less interest. Nonetheless, the Navy appreciated the importance of getting a capable carrier-based swept-wing jet fighter. Grumman was awarded a contract for the development of a swept- wing fighter jet in 1951. The arrival of the MiG-15, which easily outclassed straight-wing fighters in the air war over North Korea was a major factor.Kinzey 1983, p. 4.Elward 2010, p. 112.Elward 2010, p. 113. Prototypes were quickly produced by modifying Panthers, and the first (XF9F-6) flew on 20 September 1951. The aircraft was still subsonic, but the critical Mach number was increased from 0.79 to 0.86 at sea level and to 0.895 at 35,000 ft (10,000 m), improving performance markedly over the Panther. Instead of using conventional ailerons for roll control, the F9F-6 uses spoilers on the upper surfaces of the wing. Wing fences were soon added and the spoilers extended from the fences to the tips of the wing. The rudder pedals controlled the part of the rudder below the horizontal tail surface, while the upper portion of the rudder was controlled by a yaw damper. This allowed the Cougar to fly safely and easily without the upper portion of the tail.Kinzey 1983, p. 5. =F9F-6= VF-24 on in 1955 Initial production (646 airframes) was the F9F-6, delivered from mid-1952 through July 1954. The F9F-6 first flew on September 20, 1951, seven months after Grumman signed a contract with the Navy for swept-wing fighter.Kinzey 1983, p. 8. The first 30 production aircraft used the same J42 P-6 engine used in the F9F-5, but was then replaced by the more powerful J42 P-8 with 7,250 pounds of thrust.Elward 2010, p. 115. The J42 was a licensed version of the Rolls-Royce Nene. Armament was four 20 mm (.79 in) AN/M3 cannons in the nose and provisions for two bombs or drop tanks under the wings. Most were fitted with a UHF homing antenna under the nose, and some were fitted with probes for inflight refuelling. The F9F-6 used an Aero 5D-1 weapons sight with an APG-30A gun-ranging radar. The F9F-6 was later designated F-9F in 1962. Sixty were built as F9F-6P reconnaissance aircraft with cameras instead of the nose cannon.Elward 2010, p. 128. After withdrawal from active service, many F9F-6s were used as unmanned drones for combat training, designated F9F-6D, or as drone controllers, designated F9F-6K.Kinzey 1983, p. 8. The F9F-6K and the F9F-6D were redesignated the QF-9F and DF-9F, respectively. =F9F-7= The F9F-7 referred to the next batch of Cougars that were given the Allison J33 also found in the F9F-4, instead of the Pratt & Whitney J48. A total of 168 were built, but the J33 proved both less powerful and less reliable than the J48. Almost all were retrofitted with the J48 engine, and were thus indistinguishable from F9F-6s. These were redesignated F-9H in 1962.Elward 2010, p. 118. Flexible deck testing The Navy used two modified F9F-7s to conduct experiments landing on British-inspired flexible decks which did not require the use of landing gear. The reasoning was that since an airplane's landing gear comprises some 33% of the total weight, a plane without landing gear would gain a greater range and would be able to carry more ordnance.Elward 2010, p. 118. The aircraft were fitted with a 3-inch-deep false bottom under the center fuselage to help balance the plane during landings on the flex-deck made up of a lubricated rubberized fabric. The deck, built by Goodyear was 1/2 inch thick and featured several arresting cables.Elward 2010, p. 120. The planes were launched using a ramp and a handling dolly which served as temporary landing gear.Elward 2010, p. 119. The two F9F-7 aircraft in the test were equipped with the powerful J48-P8 engine instead of the Allison J33 engine originally used with the F9F-7. While the landing tests yielded positive results and proved that landing was clearly possible, the project was terminated in 1955 as it would have been difficult to move the aircraft around the carrier deck once they landed. It also required a highly skilled pilot to perform the landings and would have made it impossible to divert to a land base if necessary.Elward 2010, p. 120.Elward 2010, p. 122. =F9F-8= Work on the F9F-8 began in April, 1953 with three goals: lower the airplane's stall speed, improve aircraft control at high angles of attack, and increase range. It featured an 8 in (20 cm) stretch in the fuselage and modified wings with a greater chord, an increased area (from 300 to 337 square feet), and a dogtooth. The airframe changes improved low- speed and high angle of attack flying, and gave more room for fuel tanks. The top speed was 704 mph and minimum catapult speed was lowered to 127 knots (146 mph). It also was now capable of breaking the sound barrier in a steep dive. All four ammunition boxes were mounted above the guns, in contrast to the split location of most previous F9Fs including the Panther. Visibility, which was already very good was improved with the F9F-8.Elward 2010, p. 128.Elward 2010, p. 114.Elward 2010, p. 129.Winchester 2005, p. 4-5. 601 aircraft were delivered between April 1954 and March 1957. Late production F9F-8 aircraft were given the ability to carry four AIM-9 Sidewinder air-to-air missiles under the wings (the first Navy aircraft to deploy with the missiles). Most earlier aircraft were later modified to carry Sidewinders. A number were given also nuclear bombing equipment.Elward 2010, p. 128.Elward 2010, p. 72. The F9F-9 was redesignated F-9J in 1962. The F9F-8B aircraft were F9F-8s converted into single-seat attack fighters, later redesignated AF-9J. The Navy acquired 377 two-seat F9F-8T trainers between 1956 and 1960. They were used for advanced training, weapons training, and carrier training, and served until 1974. They were armed with twin 20 mm (.79 in) cannon and could carry a full bombs or missiles load. In the 1962 redesignation, these were later called TF-9J.Swanborough and Bowers 1990, pp. 249‚Äì251. Sidewinder missiles. Aerial reconnaissance A total of 110 F9F-8Ps (photo-reconnaissance) were produced with an extensively modified nose carrying cameras. They were withdrawn after 1960 to reserve squadrons. In 1962, surviving F9F-6P and F9F-8P aircraft were re-designated RF-9F and RF-9J respectively. Modifications of F9F-8 to convert to F9F-8P: *The modification to eliminate the guns and related equipment and incorporate the photographic equipment and automatic pilot and their controls and instruments has resulted in the following changes: *Rearrangement of electronics equipment installed in the area enclosed by the fuselage nose section, lengthening of this section by 12 inches, and shortening of the sliding nose section. *Rearrangement of the left and right consoles and the main instrument panel to provide space for the controls associated with the additional equipment. *Some minor changes of the fuselage structure and equipment installations to provide for the necessary ducting control for hot air from the engine compressor, which is used for defrosting the camera windows and heating the camera compartment. *Removal of all armament, the Armament Control System, and the AN/APG-30 radar system, and installation of an additional armor plate bulkhead.USN Flight Handbook, F9F-8 =Flight characteristics and deployment= The F9F was known to be highly maneuverable and easy to fly. Corky Meyer, who flew both the F9F Cougar and North American FJ-3 Fury, noted that compared to the latter the Cougar had a higher dive speed limit (Mach 1.2 vs Mach 1), a higher maneuvering limit of 7.5-g (compared to 6-g), and greater endurance. \\"[The] Combat Air patrol mission was for two hours on station at 150 nm from the carrier. This required 2+30 takeoff, cruise, and landing endurance plus reserves. The F9F-6 could perform a three-hour CAP mission on internal fuel. The FJ-2 and -3 with external tanks had less that 1+30 mission time and the FJ-4 just met the mission requirement.\\"Elward 2010, p. 138. The F9F Cougar was also a capable multi-role aircraft, which may explain why it was deployed less often than dedicated fighters.Elward 2010, p. 138. In spite of engine problems that plagued the FJ-3, it was deployed for a longer period than the F9F Cougar. This was more likely attributable to the fact the F9F had an attack role that was being superseded by new jets such as A4D-1 Skyhawk, rather than any deficiency as a fighter. \\"The reason the FJ-3 was deployed a little longer and a little more often (19 times vs 16) in fighter squadrons than the F9F-8 probably wasn't because it was the better fighter. More likely it was because it has a minimal capability as an attack aircraft, whereas the F9F-8 was good for that too, including nuclear weapon delivery. In effect the F9F-8 was a jet attack placeholder along with the F7U-3M, while the pipeline was being filled with the FJ-4Bs and A4Ds. As a result, the FJ-3 was the designated day fighter by default on most deployments.\\"Elward 2010, p. 138. Operational history H&MS-13; at Chu Lai, Vietnam 1967 Blue Angel F9F-8's performing a \\"fleur-de- lis\\" maneuver in 1955 =United States= The first F9F-6s were assigned to fleet squadron VF-32 at the end of 1952. The First F9F Cougar squadron to actually deploy was VF-24, assigned to in August 1953 but arrived too late to the Korean theater to participate in the air war.Elward 2010, p. 114. F9F-8s were withdrawn from front-line service in 1958‚Äì59, replaced by F11F Tigers and F8U Crusaders. The Naval Reserves used them until the mid-1960s, but none of the single-seat versions were used in the Vietnam War. The only version of the Cougar to see combat was the TF-9J trainer (known as F9F-8T until 1962) during the Vietnam War. Detachments of four Cougars served with US Marines Headquarters and Maintenance Squadron 11 (H&MS-11;) at Da Nang and H&MS-13; at Chu Lai, where they were used for fast-Forward Air Control and the airborne command role, directing airstrikes against enemy positions in South Vietnam between 1966 and 1968.Mersky Aviation News 17‚Äì31 August 1989, pp. 320‚Äì322.Baugher, Joe. \\"Grumman F9F-8T/TF-9J Cougar.\\" US Navy Fighters, 29 January 2000. Retrieved: 19 July 2011. The TF-9J two-seat trainer had a long service with the U.S. Navy. It served as the Navy's advanced flight trainer for more than two decades. The proposed Cougar modification (reengined with a J52 engine) was rejected, and the Navy selected the TA-4F Skyhawk. The last Cougar was phased out when Training Squadron 4 (VT-4) re-equipped in February 1974. A F9F-8T, BuNo 14276, is displayed at the National Naval Aviation Museum at NAS Pensacola, Florida. Transcontinental speed record The US Navy used the F9F Cougar to set the transcontinental crossing record on April 1, 1954. Three pilots from fleet fighter squadron VF-21 completed the 2,438-mile flight in under four hours with LCDR F.X. Brady setting the quickest time of 3 hours, 45 minutes and 30 seconds. This was the first time the distance had been covered in under four hours. The three F9F-6 aircraft refueled over Kansas from a North American AJ Savage, using an experimental refueling probe mounted on the nose.Kinzey 1983, p. 8.Elward 2010, p. 116. Blue Angels The U.S. Navy's flight demonstration team, the Blue Angels flew four different variants of F9Fs from the F9F-2 Panther to the F9F-8. The Blue Angels replaced their six F9F-5 Panthers with six F9F-6s in 1953. This was short lived however and the Navy subsequently took them for fleet use without using the planes in an air show. The F9F-6s were then replaced with overhauled F9F-5s until 1954 when the Blue Angels switched to the F9F-8. The Blue Angels used the F9F-8 until 1957 they were replaced by the Grumman F11F-1 Tiger, although one two- seat F9F-8T was retained for press and VIP flights.Elward 2010, p. 142. =Argentina= The only foreign air arm to use the F9F Cougar was the Argentine Naval Aviation, who also used the F9F Panther as well. Two F9F-8T trainers were acquired in 1962, and served until 1971. The Cougar was the first jet to break the sound barrier in Argentina.\\"TR=AT Cougar\\". www.histarmar.com.ar.

Originally used to replace mica in electrical applications, it has since been manufactured for a variety of applications. Today, the product is produced by New Zealand‚Äìbased Formica Group, and has been since 2007. The word Formica refers to the company's classic product: a heat-resistant, wipe-clean laminate of paper or textile with melamine resin. Formica Group, a division of the Dutch company Broadview Holdings, consists of Formica Canada, Inc., Formica Corporation, Formica de Mexico S.A. de C.V., Formica IKI Oy, Formica Limited, Formica S.A., Formica S.A.S., Formica Taiwan Corporation, Formica (Thailand) Co., Ltd., Formica (Asia) Ltd., and others.  Etymology of the name The mineral mica was commonly used at that time for electrical insulation. Because the new product acted as a substitute \\"for mica\\", Faber used the name Formica as a trademark (the word already existed as the scientific name for wood ants, from which formic acid and the derivative formaldehyde compound used in the resin were first isolated).  History  Assorted samples of Formica = Founding and initial product development = Formica laminate was invented in 1912 by Daniel J. O'Conor and Herbert A. Faber, while they were working at Westinghouse, resulting in a patent filing on 1 February 1913.Northeast finds Formica in top condition at 100, Financial Times, Chris Tighe, 31 January 2013 U.S. Patent No. 1,284,432 was granted on 12 November 1918.U.S. Patent No. 1,284,432 O'Conor and Faber originally conceived it as a substitute for mica used as electrical insulation, made of wrapped woven fabric coated with Bakelite thermosetting resin, then slit lengthwise, flattened, and cured in a press. Immediately afterwards, O'Conor and Faber left Westinghouse to start a business based on the product, enlisting lawyer and banker John G. Tomlin as an investor. Tomlin provided $7,500 capital as a silent business partner. The company began operations on 2 May 1913, and was immediately successful: by September, Formica Products Company employed eighteen people trying to fill the demand for electrical parts for Bell Electric Motor, Ideal Electric, and Northwest Electric. After the General Bakelite Company decided to sell resin for sheet insulation only to Westinghouse, allowing the Formica company other shapes with smaller markets, they switched to a similar competitive phenolic resin, Redmanol. After patent litigation favorable to Baekeland in 1922, the Redmanol Chemical Products Company, was merged with the General Bakelite Company (founded by Baekeland in 1910) and the Condensite Company (founded by J. W. Aylesworth) to form The Bakelite Corporation. An important application devised in the 1920s was the use of phenolic laminate fabric for gears; cut on conventional hobbing machines, the gears were tough and quiet, which was important for automotive timing gears. By 1932, Formica Insulation Company was producing 6,000 gear blanks per day for Chevrolet and other car makers. In 1927, Formica Insulation Company obtained a patent on an opaque barrier sheet that allowed the use of rotogravure printing to make wood-grained or marble- surfaced laminate, the first of many innovations that were to associate the name \\"Formica\\" with decorative interior products. In 1938 melamine thermosetting resin was developed by American Cyanamid Company. It resisted heat, abrasion and moisture better than phenolic or urea resins and could be used to make more colors; soon after, the Formica Corporation was buying the entire output of melamine from American Cyanamid. During World War II it manufactured \\"Pregwood\\" plastic-impregnated wooden aeroplane propellers and bomb parts. Post-war, engineering uses declined, ceasing in 1970 in favor of decorative laminates. The company was headquartered in Cincinnati, Ohio, for many years. After WWII, it entered the European market through a license agreement. = Acquisition by American Cyanamid = In 1956 American Cyanamid acquired Formica Corp. The principal reason was to have a captive buyer for melamine, as Cyanamid was one of the largest producers. However, this was soon thwarted due to an anti-trust action by the US Department of Justice. Through a settlement agreement, Formica Corp. was required to buy a significant share of its melamine needs from competing producers. Cyanamid operated Formica Corp. as a fully consolidated subsidiary, rather than as an operating division, allowing it to retain the term \\"Formica\\" as a corporate name. This gave added protection to the trademark, helping to protect the word from becoming generic‚Äîwhich had been tried by many competitors, against whom Cyanamid gained legal injunctions‚Äîto protect this valuable trademark name. (Historically, trademarks owned by other corporations which had become generic words, such as \\"shredded wheat\\", were no longer the exclusive property of their originators. Cyanamid resolutely defended the Formica brand name.) Dan O'Conor, son of the inventor, continued as president of Formica Corp. after the acquisition, and was widely regarded as the next chairman of American Cyanamid. However, he was thrown from his horse during a steeplechase event, suffering a broken neck and becoming quadriplegic, ending his business career and, many executives felt, preventing Cyanamid from achieving the growth and profitability it might have. After a 1984 management buyout from American Cyanamid, Formica diversified with products such as solid surfacing, metal laminates and flooring materials. = Recent history = From 2007 to 2019 Formica Corp. was a subsidiary of the Fletcher Building group,History of the Fletcher Building group which purchased it from private equity investors Cerberus Capital Management, L.P. and Oaktree Capital Management, LLC. In 2018, Fletcher Building announced plans to sell Formica to Broadview Holdings (parent of Trespa) for NZD $1.226 billion (US$840 m), with the sale finalised the following year.

A nomarch was the government official responsible for a nome. Etymology The term nome is derived from nom√≥s \\"province, district\\". Nomarch is derived from nom√°rkhƒìs: \\"province\\" + \\"ruler\\". Egyptian history The division of the Egyptian kingdom into nomes can be documented as far back as the reign of Djoser of the 3rd Dynasty in the early Old Kingdom, c. 2670 BCE, and probably dates even further back to the Predynastic kingdoms of the Nile valley. The earliest topographical lists of the nomes of Upper and Lower Egypt date back to the reign of Nyuserre Ini, of the mid 5th Dynasty, from which time the nomarchs no longer lived at royal capital but stayed in their nomes. The power of the nomarchs grew with the reforms of Nyuserre's second successor, Djedkare Isesi, which effectively decentralized the Egyptian state. The post of nomarch then quickly became hereditary, thereby creating a virtual feudal system where local allegiances slowly superseded obedience to the pharaoh. Less than 200 years after Djedkare's reign, the nomarchs had become the all-powerful heads of the provinces. At the dawn of the First Intermediate Period, the power of the Pharaohs of the 8th Dynasty had diminished to the extent that they owed their position to the most powerful nomarchs, upon whom they could only bestow titles and honours. The power of the nomarchs remained important during the later royal revival under the impulse of the 11th Dynasty, originally a family of Theban nomarchs. Their power diminished during the subsequent 12th Dynasty, setting the stage for the apex of royal power during the Middle Kingdom. Later re-use of the term The title nomarch continued to be used even into the Roman period. The title is also in use in modern Greece for the heads of the prefectures of Greece, which were also titled nomos (pl.

Colosseum to right North side, from the Colosseum West side Relief panels, round reliefs and frieze over left (west) arch, from south Round reliefs and frieze over right (east) arch, from south Arch of Constantino 2013 The Arch of Constantine () is a triumphal arch in Rome dedicated to the emperor Constantine the Great. The arch was commissioned by the Roman Senate to commemorate Constantine‚Äôs victory over Maxentius at the Battle of Milvian Bridge in AD 312. Situated between the Colosseum and the Palatine Hill, the arch spans the Via triumphalis, the route taken by victorious military leaders when they entered the city in a triumphal procession. Dedicated in 315, it is the largest Roman triumphal arch, with overall dimensions of.21 m high, 25.9 m wide and 7.4 m deep. It has three bays, the central one being 11.5 m high and 6.5 m wide and the laterals 7.4 m by 3.4 m each. The arch is constructed of brick-faced concrete reveted in marble. The three bay design with detached columns was first used for the Arch of Septimius Severus in the Roman Forum (which stands at the end of the triumph route) and repeated in several other arches now lost. Though dedicated to Constantine, much of the sculptural decoration consists of reliefs and statues removed from earlier triumphal monuments dedicated to Trajan (98‚Äì117), Hadrian (117‚Äì138) and Marcus Aurelius (161‚Äì180).  History  The arch, which was constructed between 312 and 315 AD, was dedicated by the Senate to commemorate ten years (decennalia) of Constantine's reign (306‚Äì337) and his victory over the then reigning emperor Maxentius (306‚Äì312) at the Battle of Milvian Bridge on 28 October 312, as described on its attic inscription, and officially opened on 25 July 315. Not only did the Roman senate give the arch for Constantine's victory, they also were celebrating decennia, a series of games that happens every decade for the Romans. On this occasion they also said many prayers. However, Constantine had actually entered Rome on 29 October 312, amidst great rejoicing, and the Senate then commissioned the monument. Constantine then left Rome within two months and did not return till 326. The location, between the Palatine Hill and the Caelian Hill, spanned the ancient route of Roman triumphs (Via triumphalis) at its origin, where it diverged from the Via sacra. This route was that taken by the emperors when they entered the city in triumph. This route started at the Campus Martius, led through the Circus Maximus, and around the Palatine Hill; immediately after the Arch of Constantine, the procession would turn left at the Meta Sudans and march along the Via sacra to the Forum Romanum and on to the Capitoline Hill, passing through both the Arches of Titus and Septimius Severus. During the Middle Ages, the Arch of Constantine was incorporated into one of the family strongholds of ancient Rome, as shown in the painting by Herman van Swanevelt, here. Works of restoration were first carried out in the 18th century, the last excavations have taken place in the late 1990s, just before the Great Jubilee of 2000. The arch served as the finish line for the marathon athletic event for the 1960 Summer Olympics. = Controversy = There has been much controversy over the origins of the arch, with some scholars claiming that it should no longer be referred to as Constantine's arch, but is in fact an earlier work from the time of Hadrian, reworked during Constantine's reign, or at least the lower part. Another theory holds that it was erected, or at least started, by Maxentius, and one scholar believed it was as early as the time of Domitian (81‚Äì96). = Symbolism = Whatever the faults of Maxentius, his reputation in Rome was influenced by his contributions to public building. By the time of his accession in 306 Rome was becoming increasingly irrelevant to the governance of the empire, most emperors choosing to live elsewhere and focusing on defending the fragile boundaries, where they frequently founded new cities. This factor contributed to his ability to seize power. By contrast Maxentius concentrated on restoring the capital, his epithet being conservator urbis suae (preserver of his city). Thus Constantine was perceived amongst other things as the deposer of one of the city's greatest benefactors, and needed to acquire legitimacy. Much controversy has surrounded the patronage of the public works of this period. Issuing a damnatio memoriae Constantine set out to systematically erase the memory of Maxentius. Consequently, there remains considerable uncertainty regarding the patronage of early fourth century public buildings, including the Arch of Constantine, which may originally have been an Arch of Maxentius. Sculptural style Constantine's Arch is an important example, frequently cited in surveys of art history, of the stylistic changes of the 4th century, and the \\"collapse of the classical Greek canon of forms during the late Roman period\\", a sign the city was in decline, and would soon be eclipsed by Constantine's founding of a new capital at Constantinople in 324. The contrast between the styles of the re-used Imperial reliefs of Trajan, Hadrian and Marcus Aurelius and those newly made for the arch is dramatic and, according to Ernst Kitzinger, \\"violent\\", that where the head of an earlier emperor was replaced by that of Constantine the artist was still able to achieve a \\"soft, delicate rendering of the face of Constantine\\" that was \\"a far cry from the dominant style of the workshop\\". It remains the most impressive surviving civic monument from Rome in Late Antiquity, but is also one of the most controversial with regards to its origins and meanings. Kitzinger compares a roundel of Hadrian lion-hunting, which is \\"still rooted firmly in the tradition of late Hellenistic art\\", and there is \\"an illusion of open, airy space in which figures move freely and with relaxed self-assurance\\" with the later frieze where the figures are \\"pressed, trapped, as it were, between two imaginary planes and so tightly packed within the frame as to lack all freedom of movement in any direction\\", with \\"gestures that are \\"jerky, overemphatic and uncoordinated with the rest of the body\\". In the 4th century reliefs, the figures are disposed geometrically in a pattern that \\"makes sense only in relation to the spectator\\", in the largesse scene (below) centred on the emperor who looks directly out to the viewer. Kitzinger continues: \\"Gone too is the classical canon of proportions. Heads are disproportionately large, trunks square, legs stubby ... \\"Differences in the physical size of figures drastically underline differences of rank and importance which the second- century artist had indicated by subtle compositional means within a seemingly casual grouping. Gone, finally are elaboration of detail and differentiation of surface texture. Faces are cut rather than modelled, hair takes the form of a cap with some superficial stippling, drapery folds are summarily indicated by deeply drilled lines.\\" The commission was clearly highly important, if hurried, and the work must be considered as reflecting the best available craftsmanship in Rome at the time; the same workshop was probably responsible for a number of surviving sarcophagi. The question of how to account for what may seem a decline in both style and execution has generated a vast amount of discussion. Factors introduced into the discussion include: a breakdown of the transmission in artistic skills due to the political and economic disruption of the Crisis of the Third Century,influence from Eastern and other pre- classical regional styles from around the Empire (a view promoted by Josef Strzygowski (1862-1941), and now mostly discounted), the emergence into high- status public art of a simpler \\"popular\\" or \\"Italic\\" style that had been used by the less wealthy throughout the reign of Greek models, an active ideological turning against what classical styles had come to represent, and a deliberate preference for seeing the world simply and exploiting the expressive possibilities that a simpler style gave. The sculptors of Constantine's time were more interested in symbolism: both symbolism for religion as well as symbolism for history. One factor that cannot be responsible, as the date and origin of the Venice Portrait of the Four Tetrarchs show, is the rise of Christianity to official support, as the changes predated that. The stylistic references to the earlier arches of Titus and Septimius Severus, together with the incorporation of spolia from the times of other earlier emperors may be considered a deliberate tribute to Roman history. Iconography The arch is heavily decorated with parts of older monuments, which assume a new meaning in the context of the Constantinian building. As it celebrates the victory of Constantine, the new \\"historic\\" friezes illustrating his campaign in Italy convey the central meaning: the praise of the emperor, both in battle and in his civilian duties. The other imagery supports this purpose: decoration taken from the \\"golden times\\" of the Empire under the 2nd century emperors whose reliefs were re-used places Constantine next to these \\"good emperors\\", and the content of the pieces evokes images of the victorious and pious ruler. Another explanation given for the re-use is the short time between the start of construction (late 312 at the earliest) and the dedication (summer 315), so the architects used existing artwork to make up for the lack of time to create new art. It could be that so many old parts were used because the builders themselves did not feel the artists of their time could do better than what had already been done by different people. As yet another possible reason, it has often been suggested that the Romans of the 4th century truly did lack the artistic skill to produce acceptable artwork, and were aware of it, and therefore plundered the ancient buildings to adorn their contemporary monuments. This interpretation has become less prominent in more recent times, as the art of Late Antiquity has been appreciated in its own right. It is possible that a combination of those explanations is correct. =Attic= On the top of each column, large sculptures representing Dacians can be seen, which date from Trajan. Above the central archway is the inscription, forming the most prominent portion of the attic and is identical on both sides of the arch. Flanking the inscription on both sides are four pairs of relief panels above the minor archways, eight in total. These were taken from an unknown monument erected in honour of Marcus Aurelius. On the north side, from left to right, the panels depict the emperor's return to Rome after the campaign (adventus), the emperor leaving the city and saluted by a personification of the Via Flaminia, the emperor distributing money among the people (largitio), and the emperor interrogating a German prisoner. On the south side, from left to right, are depicted a captured enemy chieftain led before the emperor, a similar scene with other prisoners (illustrated below), the emperor speaking to the troops (adlocutio), and the emperor sacrificing a pig, sheep and bull (suovetaurilia). Together with three panels now in the Capitoline Museum, the reliefs were probably taken from a triumphal monument commemorating Marcus Aurelius' war against the Marcomanni and the Sarmatians from 169 ‚Äì 175, which ended with Marcus Aurelius' triumphant return in 176. On the largitio panel, the figure of Marcus Aurelius' son Commodus has been eradicated following the latter's damnatio memoriae. From the same time period the two large (3 m high) panels decorating the attic on the east and west sides of the arch show scenes from Trajan's Dacian Wars. Together with the two reliefs on the inside of the central archway, these came from a large frieze celebrating the Dacian victory. The original place of this frieze was either the Forum of Trajan, or the barracks of the emperor's horse guard on the Caelius. =Main section= The general layout of the main facade is identical on both sides of the arch, consisting of four columns on bases, dividing the structure into a central arch and two lateral arches, the latter being surmounted by two round reliefs over a horizontal frieze. The four columns are of Corinthian order made of Numidian yellow marble (giallo antico), one of which has been transferred into the Basilica di San Giovanni in Laterano and was replaced by a white marble column. The columns stand on bases (plinths or socles), decorated on three sides. The reliefs on the front show Victoria, either inscribing a shield or holding palm branches, while those to the side show captured barbarians alone or with Roman soldiers. Though Constantinian, they are modelled on those of the Arch of Septimius Severus (and the destroyed Arcus novus), and may be considered as a \\"standard\\" item. The pairs of round reliefs above each lateral archway date to the times of Emperor Hadrian. They display scenes of hunting and sacrificing: (north side, left to right) hunt of a boar, sacrifice to Apollo, hunt of a lion, sacrifice to Hercules. On the south side, the left pair show the departure for the hunt (see below) and sacrifice to Silvanus, while those on the right (illustrated on the right) show the hunt of a bear and sacrifice to Diana. The head of the emperor (originally Hadrian) has been reworked in all medallions: on the north side, into Constantine in the hunting scenes and into Licinius or Constantius I in the sacrifice scenes; on the south side, vice versa. The reliefs, c. 2 m in diameter, were framed in porphyry; this framing is only extant on the right side of the northern facade. Similar medallions, of Constantinian origin, are located on the small sides of the arch; the eastern side shows the Sun rising, on the western side, the Moon. Both are on chariots. The spandrels of the main archway are decorated with reliefs depicting victory figures with trophies (illustrated below), those of the smaller archways show river gods. Column bases and spandrel reliefs are from the time of Constantine.  Constantinian frieze  Obsidio (detail) Liberalitas (detail) The horizontal frieze below the round reliefs are the main parts from the time of Constantine, running around the monument, one strip above each lateral archway and including the west and east sides of the arch. These \\"historical\\" reliefs depict scenes from the Italian campaign of Constantine against Maxentius which was the reason for the construction of the monument. The frieze starts at the western side with the Departure from Milan (Profectio). It continues on the southern, face, with the Siege of Verona (Obsidio) on the left (South west), an event which was of great importance to the war in Northern Italy. On the right (South east) is depicted the Battle of Milvian Bridge (Proelium) with Constantine's army victorious and the enemy drowning in the river Tiber. On the eastern side, Constantine and his army enter Rome (Ingressus); the artist seems to have avoided using imagery of the triumph, as Constantine probably did not want to be shown triumphant over the Eternal City. On the northern face, looking towards the city, are two strips with the emperor's actions after taking possession of Rome. On the left (North east) is Constantine speaking to the citizens on the Forum Romanum (Oratio), while to the right (North west) is the final panel with Constantine distributing money to the people (Liberalitas). =Inner sides of the archways= In the central archway, there is one large panel of Trajan's Dacian War on each wall. Inside the lateral archways are eight portraits busts (two on each wall), destroyed to such an extent that it is no longer possible to identify them. Inscriptions The main inscription on the attic would originally have been of bronze letters. It can still be read easily; only the recesses in which the letters sat, and their attachment holes, remain. It reads thus, identically on both sides (with abbreviations completed in parentheses): : :To the Emperor Caesar Flavius Constantinus, the greatest, pious, and blessed Augustus: because he, inspired by the divine, and by the greatness of his mind, has delivered the state from the tyrant and all of his followers at the same time, with his army and just force of arms, the Senate and People of Rome have dedicated this arch, decorated with triumphs. The words instinctu divinitatis (\\"inspired by the divine\\") have been greatly commented on. They are usually read as sign of Constantine's shifting religious affiliation: The Christian tradition, most notably Lactantius and Eusebius of Caesarea, relate the story of a vision of God to Constantine during the campaign, and that he was victorious in the sign of the cross at the Milvian Bridge. The official documents (esp. coins) still prominently display the Sun god until 324, while Constantine started to support the Christian church from 312 on. In this situation, the vague wording of the inscription can be seen as the attempt to please all possible readers, being deliberately ambiguous, and acceptable to both pagans and Christians. As was customary, the vanquished enemy is not mentioned by name, but only referred to as \\"the tyrant\\", drawing on the notion of the rightful killing of a tyrannical ruler; together with the image of the \\"just war\\", it serves as justification of Constantine's civil war against Maxentius. Two short inscriptions on the inside of the central archway transport a similar message: Constantine came not as conqueror, but freed Rome from occupation: : (liberator of the city) -- (founder of peace) Over each of the small archways, inscriptions read: : : They give a hint on the date of the arch: \\"Solemn vows for the 10th anniversary ‚Äì for the 20th anniversary\\" and \\"as for the 10th, so for the 20th anniversary\\". Both refer to Constantine's decennalia, i.e. the 10th anniversary of his reign (counted from 306), which he celebrated in Rome in the summer of 315. It can be assumed that the arch honouring his victory was inaugurated during his stay in the city.

During the Middle Ages the chiefs of Cen√©l √Åeda na hEchtge, the O'Shaughnessys (√ì Seachnasaigh, a clan descended from Guaire Aidhneach) had their principal stronghold in Gort, on a site which later became a cavalry barracks. At the end of the seventeenth century the O'Shaughnessy lands were confiscated and granted to Sir Thomas Prendergast, 1st Baronet, whose grandson was John Prendergast Smyth, 1st Viscount Gort. In 1831, the town had a population of 3,627 and 563 houses. The Great Hunger of the mid-1840s devastated the population. A number of historic sites around Gort are included in the Sites and Monuments Record. Kilmacduagh monastery and round tower are situated approximately 3 km (1.9 mi) west of Gort. Rahaly Castle lies approximately 4.8 km (3 mi) east of Gort. Kiltartan Castle is 3 km to the north.  Transport  = Road = Gort is accessible from the M18 Motorway from Shannon to Galway, at Junction 16. The motorway M18 ends at junction 18 of the M6. The road continues northbound as the M17 towards Tuam. The segment from Ennis to Gort of the M18 Motorway bypass of the town was officially opened on 12 November 2010. Followed by the Gort to Tuam section which opened on 27 September 2017. = Rail = Gort railway station opened on 15 September 1869 and was closed for goods traffic on 3 November 1975 and for passenger traffic on 5 April 1976. It was reopened in 2010 as part of the Western Railway Corridor project. Gort rail services are on the Galway to Limerick route with connections to Cork and Tralee from Limerick station and to Dublin via Galway.http://www.irishrail.ie/train-timetables/timetables-by- station#ghttp://www.irishrail.ie/media/galway_- _limerickcorktralee_valid_from_20.11.2016.pdf = Bus = Gort is served by Bus Eireann hourly from the market square.

These people originally came to work in the meat processing plants in Gort where the pay is generally much higher than in similar plants in Brazil. According to Claire Healy \\"a large community of Brazilians now live, work and attend school in Gort, gradually altering the appearance and the character of the town\\".Carnaval do Galway: The Brazilian Community in Gort, 1999‚Äì2006 ‚Äì Claire Healy, in \\"Irish Migration Studies in Latin America\\" 4:3 July 2006 (www.irlandeses.org), accessed 14 August 2007 The Roman Catholic Church caters to the Brazilian community with a mass in Portuguese every Saturday held in Gort Catholic Church. By the time of the 2011 Census, non-Irish nationals accounted for 27.2% of the population. The largest group (417 people) were still Brazilians, followed by UK nationals (81).http://census.cso.ie/areaprofiles/areaprofile.aspx?Geog_Type=ST&Geog;_Code=27010  Education  The town has its own secondary school, Gort Community School which was founded in 1995, and serves a large area of south County Galway. The school facilities include a GAA pitch, rugby union pitch, football pitch, and canteen. The school's sports teams include hurling, rugby, soccer, basketball, athletics, golf and equestrian teams.

He received the 1937 Nobel Prize in Chemistry \\"for his investigations on carbohydrates and vitamin C\\". The prize was shared with Swiss chemist Paul Karrer for his work on other vitamins. Haworth worked out the correct structure of a number of sugars, and is known among organic chemists for his development of the Haworth projection that translates three-dimensional sugar structures into convenient two- dimensional graphical form. Academic career Having worked for some time from the age of fourteen in the local Ryland's linoleum factory managed by his father, he studied for and successfully passed the entrance examination to the University of Manchester in 1903 to study chemistry. He made this pursuit in spite of active discouragement by his parents. He gained his first-class honours degree in 1906. After gaining his master's degree under William Henry Perkin, Jr., he was awarded an 1851 Research Fellowship from the Royal Commission for the Exhibition of 18511851 Royal Commission Archives and studied at the University of G√∂ttingen earning his PhD in Otto Wallach's laboratory after only one year of study. A DSc from the University of Manchester followed in 1911, after which he served a short time at the Imperial College of Science and Technology as Senior Demonstrator in Chemistry. In 1912 Haworth became a lecturer at United College of University of St Andrews in Scotland and became interested in carbohydrate chemistry, which was being investigated at St Andrews by Thomas Purdie (1843‚Äì1916) and James Irvine (1877‚Äì1952). Haworth began his work on simple sugars in 1915 and developed a new method for the preparation of the methyl ethers of sugars using methyl sulfate and alkali (now called Haworth methylation). He then began studies on the structural features of the disaccharides. Haworth organised the laboratories at St Andrews University for the production of chemicals and drugs for the British government during World War I (1914‚Äì1918). He was appointed Professor of Organic Chemistry at the Armstrong College (Newcastle upon Tyne) of Durham University in 1920. The next year Haworth was appointed Head of the Chemistry Department at the college. It was during his time in the North East of England that he married Violet Chilton Dobbie. Birmingham University In 1925 he was appointed Mason Professor of Chemistry at the University of Birmingham (a position he held until 1948). Among his lasting contributions to science was the confirmation of a number of structures of optically active sugars: by 1928, he had deduced and confirmed, among others, the structures of maltose, cellobiose, lactose, gentiobiose, melibiose, gentianose, raffinose, as well as the glucoside ring tautomeric structure of aldose sugars. He published a classic text in 1929, \\"The Constitution of Sugars.\\" In 1933, working with the then Assistant Director of Research (later Sir) Edmund Hirst and a team led by post-doctoral student Maurice Stacey (who in 1956 rose to the same Mason Chair), having properly deduced the correct structure and optical-isomeric nature of vitamin C, Haworth reported the synthesis of the vitamin. Haworth had been given his initial reference sample of \\"water-soluble vitamin C\\" or \\"hexuronic acid\\" (the previous name for the compound as extracted from natural products) by Hungarian physiologist Albert Szent-Gy√∂rgyi, who had codiscovered its vitamin properties along with Charles Glen King, and had more recently discovered that it could be extracted in bulk from Hungarian paprika. In honour of the compound's antiscorbutic properties, Haworth and Szent-Gy√∂rgyi now proposed the new name of \\"a-scorbic acid\\" for the molecule, with L-ascorbic acid as its formal chemical name. During World War II, he was a member of the MAUD Committee which oversaw research on the British atomic bomb project.  Recognition  Haworth is commemorated at the University of Birmingham in the Haworth Building, which houses most of the University of Birmingham School of Chemistry. The School has a Haworth Chair of Chemistry, from 2007 held by Professor Nigel Simpkins.www.chem.bham.ac.uk/staff/Simpkins.shtml. Retrieved 2 October 2010 In 1977 the Royal Mail issued a postage stamp (one of a series of four) featuring Haworth's achievement in synthesising vitamin C and his Nobel prize.Mayo Clin Proc. (2002)77:108 Stamp Vignette on Medical Science He also developed a simple method of representing on paper the three-dimensional structure of sugars. The representation, using perspective, now known as a Haworth projection, is still widely used in biochemistry. Personal life In 1922 he married Violet Chilton Dobbie, daughter of Sir James Johnston Dobbie. They had two sons, James and David. He was knighted in 1947. He died suddenly from a heart attack on 19 March 1950, his 67th birthday.

Wilson is probably best known as the co-author with Mick Dodson of the 1997 Bringing Them Home report into the Stolen Generation which led to the creation of a National Sorry Day and a walk for reconciliation across the Sydney Harbour Bridge in 2000 with an estimated people participating. Wilson was also one of three judges sitting on The WA Inc Royal Commission in the early 1990s which eventually led to former Premier Brian Burke being jailed in March 1997. Early life and academic background Wilson was born in Geraldton, in Western Australia (WA) on 23 August 1922. His early life was marked by sorrow and hardship. When he was four years old his mother died. At the age of seven his father, also a lawyer, suffered a stroke and spent the next five years in a hospice. His older brother became a father figure to him and for years the family faced financial struggles. At the age of 14, Wilson left formal schooling and took his first job as a messenger with the Geraldton Local Court. In September 1941, following the outbreak of World War II, Wilson enlisted in the army reserve, which was known at the time as the Militia (service no. W46518) and was posted to the 44th Battalion. World War II Nominal Roll, \\"WILSON, RONALD DARLING\\" The battalion was part of a Special Mobile Force stationed in coastal areas between Perth and Geraldton, to respond in the event of an attack by Japanese forces. Transferring to the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) in July 1942, Wilson (service no. 427404) received pilot training under the Empire Air Training Scheme, and was posted to the UK, for operations with Royal Air Force (RAF) formations. At the end of the war he was serving with No. 287 Squadron RAF, an anti-aircraft cooperation unit (i.e. it assisted in the training of anti-aircraft gunners). Wilson flew Spitfires, among other types of aircraft. He was discharged from the RAAF on 14 February 1946, with the rank of Flying Officer. After returning to Australia, Wilson enrolled in the University of Western Australia finishing with a law degree in 1949. He later completed a Master of Laws degree at the University of Pennsylvania in 1957, as a Fulbright scholar. Early legal career Wilson was admitted as a barrister and solicitor in 1951. He had a rapid rise in his legal career, becoming Crown Prosecutor for Western Australia in 1959, only eight years after starting work as a lawyer. In 1963, he was admitted as a Queen's Counsel, at the time, the youngest ever in Western Australia. As a prosecutor, Wilson earned the nickname of the \\"Avenging Angel\\". In 2002 and 2005 two men he had prosecuted for murder have had their convictions overturned: John Button, who was convicted in 1963 of the manslaughter of his girlfriend Rosemary Anderson had his conviction overturned by the Western Australian Court of Appeal.. Darryl Beamish who had been convicted of the 1959 murder of Jillian Brewer had his conviction overturned in 2005.Beamish v The Queen . Perth serial killer, Eric Edgar Cooke, confessed to both offences before he was hanged for other murders, but was not believed by authorities. The convictions were eventually overturned in 2002. In 1969, Wilson became the Solicitor-General of Western Australia. He served in that position for ten years working under both Labor and Liberal governments. High Court Justice, 1979-1989 The Fraser Government appointed Wilson to the High Court of Australia in 1979 and was the first member of the Court from Western Australia. Wilson adopted a federalist position on the court; and was frequently in the minority on issues relating to the scope of the Commonwealth's external affairs legislative power. In Koowarta v Bjelke-Petersen,. Wilson was in the minority in holding that the external affairs power in the Australian constitution applied only to relationships outside Australia. The majority of the High Court found that the treaty need only apply to issues of clear international concern. The majority held the Federal Parliament had the power to pass the Racial Discrimination Act 1975 as a result of Australia being a signatory to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. In Commonwealth v Tasmania, the external affairs power was again the central issue. The new Hawke Government had used the external affairs power as the basis for passing legislation preventing the Tasmanian Government from building a hydro-electric dam on the Franklin River. Wilson considered that the external affairs power did not give the Federal Parliament authority to pass such legislation as it could obtain power to pass any form of legislation it wished by simply entering into a treaty with another power. Chief Justice Harry Gibbs and Daryl Dawson were the other judges joining Wilson in the dissenting judgement. Wilson dissented on the first Mabo case of 1988, with the majority finding that the , which attempted to retrospectively abolish native title rights, was not valid according to the . Wilson retired from the High Court in 1989, aged 67 years. Commissioner, 1990-1997 In 1990 the Hawke Government appointed Wilson as the President of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, where he served until his retirement in 1997. During his term as Human Right Commissioner, Wilson also served as Deputy Chairperson of the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation from 1991 to 1994. Wilson was Chancellor of Murdoch University between 1980 and 1995. The \\"Ronald Wilson Prize in Law\\" was first awarded by Murdoch University in 1993 to the graduate who best combines distinguished academic performance in law units with qualities of character, leadership and all-round contribution to the life of the university. =Bringing Them Home report= Wilson and Mick Dodson, the Aboriginal Social Justice Commissioner, jointly led the National Inquiry into the forced removal of Aboriginal children from their families and communities. Wilson and Dodson visited every state in Australia over the 17-month duration of the Inquiry and heard testimony from 535 aboriginals with 600 more making submissions. Wilson wrote after the completion of the report: \\"In chairing the National Inquiry (...) I had to relate to hundreds of stories of personal devastation, pain and loss. It was a life-changing experience.\\" The Inquiry produced a report called Bringing Them Home: Report of the National Inquiry into the Separation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Children from their Families which was tabled in Federal Parliament. \\"Between 1910 and 1970, up to 100,000 Aboriginal children were taken from their parents and put in white foster homes\\".Australia accused of genocide against aborigines It found that Australia was in breach of international law, called for a national compensation fund and recommended a national \\"sorry day\\". The report was welcomed by Aboriginal Australians but widely criticised by conservatives. Anthropologist Ron Brunton said the claims of genocide were an \\"embellishment\\"; with social commentator Robert Manne and academic Hal Wootten disputing Brunton's claims. (1998) 4(12) Indigenous Law Bulletin 4. Retrieved 7 July 2013. The Prime Minister at the time, John Howard, refused to issue an apology instead stating his regret. The Parliaments of NSW, Northern Territory, South Australia and Victoria passed motions apologising for the maltreatment. The first National Sorry Day was held in 1998 and attracted widespread participation while, in 2000, an estimated people walked across the Sydney Harbour Bridge in support of reconciliation. In 2008, Kevin Rudd as Prime Minister issued an apology to the Stolen Generation on behalf of the Australian people. =The WA Inc Royal Commission= Carmen Lawrence appointed Wilson as one of the three eminent jurists conducting The WA Inc Royal Commission. The Royal Commission was chaired by Geoffrey Kennedy and the third member was Peter Brinsden with a brief \\"to inquire into and report\\" whether there had been \\"corruption, illegal conduct, improper conduct, or bribery\\" on the part of any person or corporation in the \\"affairs, investment decisions and business dealings of the Government of Western Australia or its agencies\\". In its 1992 report, the Royal Commission said \\"The commission has found conduct and practices on the part of certain persons involved in government in the period 1983 to 1989 such as to place our government system at risk.\\" It was particularly critical of the behaviour of former Premier Brian Burke who was subsequently convicted for two years on charges of fraudulent behavior in 1994. Church and social leadership Throughout his life, Wilson was an active participant in first the Presbyterian Church of Australia and then the Uniting Church in Australia. He held a range of senior positions in the Church including Moderator of Assembly, Presbyterian Church in Western Australia (1965); Moderator, Synod of Western Australia, Uniting Church in Australia (1977-1979); President of the Assembly, Uniting Church in Australia (1988-1991), the first layperson to hold that post; and President of the Australian Chapter of the World Conference on Religion and Peace (1991-1996). He was particularly concerned with encouraging the broad Australian community to gain an understanding of Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander history. In retirement, he travelled widely to Aboriginal and church events, and was an active member of a refugee education scheme near his home. Honours In 1978 Wilson was appointed a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George (CMG) for services to the community in Western Australia. The following year he was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE) for services as a Justice of the High Court of Australia. On 26 January 1988, Wilson was appointed a Companion of the Order of Australia (AC) for services to the law. In addition, Wilson was awarded the Centenary Medal on 1 January 2001 for service as a Justice of the High Court of Australia and to human rights. He has been conferred with honorary degrees from the University of Western Australia (Doctor of Laws), Keimyung University (Doctor of Education), and Murdoch University (Doctor of the University).

The work is usually performed in a waiting area such as a lobby or front office desk of an organization or business. The title receptionist is attributed to the person who is employed by an organization to receive or greet any visitors, patients, or clients and answer telephone calls. The term front desk is used in many hotels for an administrative department where a receptionist's duties also may include room reservations and assignment, guest registration, cashier work, credit checks, key control as well as mail and message service. Such receptionists are often called front desk clerks. Receptionists cover many areas of work to assist the businesses they work for, including setting appointments, filing, record keeping, and other office tasks. Responsibilities  White House receptionist William Simmons at his desk in 1946, conversing with a visitor The business duties of a receptionist may include answering visitors' enquiries about a company and its products or services, directing visitors to their destinations, sorting and handing out mail, answering incoming calls on multi-line telephones or, earlier in the 20th century, a switchboard, setting appointments, filing, records keeping, keyboarding/data entry and performing a variety of other office tasks, such as faxing or emailing. Some receptionists may also perform bookkeeping or cashiering duties. Some, but not all, offices may expect the receptionist to serve coffee or tea to guests, and to keep the lobby area tidy. A receptionist may also assume some security guard access control functions for an organization by verifying employee identification, issuing visitor passes, and observing and reporting any unusual or suspicious persons or activities. A receptionist is often the first business contact a person will meet at any organization. It is an expectation of most organizations that the receptionist maintains a calm, courteous and professional demeanor at all times, regardless of the visitor's behavior. Some personal qualities that a receptionist is expected to possess in order to do the job successfully include attentiveness, a well-groomed appearance, initiative, loyalty, maturity, respect for confidentiality and discretion, a positive attitude and dependability. At times, the job may be stressful due to interaction with many different people with different types of personalities, and being expected to perform multiple tasks quickly. Opportunities for advancement Hampton Inn hotel in New York, USA Depending on the industry a receptionist position can have opportunities for networking in order to advance to other positions within a specific field. Some people may use this type of job as a way to familiarize themselves with office work, or to learn of other functions or positions within a corporation. Some people use receptionist work as a way to earn money while pursuing further educational opportunities or other career interests such as in the performing arts or as writers. While many persons working as receptionists continue in that position throughout their careers, some receptionists may advance to other administrative jobs, such as a customer service representative, dispatcher, interviewers, secretary, production assistant, personal assistant, or executive assistant. In smaller businesses, such as a doctor's or a lawyer's office, a receptionist may also be the office manager who is charged with a diversity of middle management level business operations. For example, in the hotel industry, the night-time receptionist's role is almost always combined with performing daily account consolidation and reporting, more particularly known as night auditing. When receptionists leave the job, they often enter other career fields such as sales and marketing, public relations or other media occupations. A few famous people were receptionists in the beginning, such as Betty Williams, a co-recipient of the 1976 Nobel Peace Prize. A number of celebrities had worked as receptionists before they became famous, such as singer/songwriter Naomi Judd and the late Linda McCartney, photographer, entrepreneur and wife of Beatle Paul McCartney.Funeral held for Linda McCartney, CNN.com 20 April 1998, retrieved from Archive.org on 24 July 2012 Other famous people who began their careers as receptionists or worked in the field include civil rights activist Rosa Parks and former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina. Evolution and new technology Some small-to-medium-sized business owners hire a live remote receptionist in lieu of a full-time, in- house receptionist, thanks to advances in communications technology. As the phrase itself suggests, a live remote receptionist deals with phone calls for a company in another location using telephony private branch exchange (PBX) servers. Most modern receptionist services can take messages, screen and forward calls, answer basic FAQs, and fill out web forms. Many services can also schedule appointments and take credit card orders. Some of the older receptionist services have been around for decades, but these often operate very differently from modern services. Advances in touch screen and 2-way video technology is changing the way some receptionist work. New types of virtual video receptionist systems now allows for live, in-house or remote receptionists to manage office lobby areas from remote locations. These virtual receptionists not only answer phones but also greet walk-in visitors by utilizing a motion detection camera to \\"see\\" visitors as they enter the building. The remote receptionist is then displayed in a video window on a wall-mounted LCD, kiosk or desktop all-in-one computer. The video receptionist and visitors can then communicate via 2-way video, allowing the receptionist to manage one or many office lobby areas from a central location. The advancement of office automation has eliminated some receptionists' jobs. For example, a telephone call could be answered by an automated attendant. However, a receptionist who possesses strong office/technical skills and who is also adept in courtesy, tact and diplomacy is still considered an asset to a company's business image, and is still very much in demand in the business world.

It charted well, hitting the Top 20 in six European countries and reaching number 1 in Norway and Sweden. Alphaville followed up with their second album in 1986 with the release of Afternoons in Utopia. The album was re-released in a \\"super deluxe\\" edition in March 2019. Background The band released the single \\"Big in Japan\\" before the album had finished recording, and its success surprised the band and label. Said the band, \\"'[Big in Japan]' beamed us up into showbiz heaven, half of the album was still be to written. So, while we were in the middle of composing and arranging the residual songs, we were sort of overtaken by our future selves. ‚Ä¶ Once we wore tattered jeans and sweaty leather jacks ‚Ä¶ now we were homeless millionaires living in hotel suites and airports.\\" Their sudden and unexpected success affected the rest of the album. In 1986, Gold recalled that he \\"bought an album of an unknown British band named Big in Japan. As you know, there's a considerable musical market in Japan. If you wanted to become famous, what you should do was to form a hard rock group and then release an album over there; it would definitely sell well... so the story went ... The statement fitted well to my storyline about a couple of drug addicted lovers and moreover provided the title for the prospective song.\\" The first three tracks the band recorded were \\"Big in Japan\\", \\"Seeds\\", which was released as the b-side to \\"Big in Japan\\", and \\"Forever Young\\", which was originally recorded as an up-tempo track. The band wasn't happy with the fast version of \\"Forever Young\\", and recording of the track had come to a halt while the band figured out what to do with the song. It was producer Budde who suggested turning the track into a ballad, which is how the song was released. The band had planned to release \\"Forever Young\\" as their second single, to follow the success of \\"Big in Japan\\". However, record studio executives requested that the band release an additional song between the two singles, and as a result \\"Sounds Like a Melody\\" was written and arranged in just two days. Of the experience, singer Marian Gold said \\"the whole affair felt like an insult to our naive hippie instincts. Writing music exclusively for the sake of commercial success seemed like the sell-out of our virtual beliefs. On the other hand, did this not open up possibilities for wonderful games to play in the brave new world of pop music?\\" This corporate pressure caused Gold to dislike the song and he refused to play it live for over 15 years. Some songs they wrote for the album were sung in German (\\"Blauer Engel\\", \\"Traumtanzer\\", and \\"Leben Ohne Ende\\"), but none of the songs ended up making it on the actual release, instead being released as b-sides or on later retrospective albums. Colin Pearson, who co-produced the album, said that Marian Gold would occasionally have problems with lyrics, and then he would remember that Gold was writing in a foreign language. Band member Bernhard Lloyd said the album was recorded using equipment such as Roland TR-808 and Linn LM-1 drum machines, a Roland System-100M, an ARP String Ensemble and a Roland SDE 200 Digital Delay machine. The album was recorded on Tascam 8-track tapes, and they used a Friendchip SRC machine to synchronize all the tracks. Songs The song \\"Summer in Berlin\\" contains references to the East German uprising of 1953, which occurred on 17 June 1953. When the compilation album Alphaville Amiga Compilation was assembled for release in East Germany in 1988, the song \\"Summer in Berlin\\" was submitted for inclusion, but rejected \\"for political reasons.\\" \\"Fallen Angel\\" was written after \\"Big in Japan\\" was released, and the band said \\"everything changes when you're Number One. The world becomes a big shopping mall where all is for free, people, objects, what-ever. There is something vulgar about all this.\\" In 1988, Gold said that \\"In The Mood\\" is very likely about us, about how we felt in 1984, though we did'nt [sic?] realize that when we wrote it. The rocket-like success of \\"Big In Japan\\" was mind-blowing and irritating at the same time and we were scandalized by a horror of losing our artistic innocence ever since we had signed that record- deal.‚Äù On the song \\"The Jet Set\\", Gold said of the song, \\"We didn't intend to write a proper song; it was supposed to be some kind of jingle that advertises things money can't buy: anarchy, freedom, love, fun and a piece of the end of the world.\\" Chart performance Reviews were generally positive, with one reviewer calling it \\"a classic synth pop album\\" and \\"a wonderfully fun ride from start to finish.\\" The album fared well in parts of Europe, but it failed to make an impact on the UK charts or in the US, faring no better than number 180. The single \\"Big in Japan\\" made a surprise entry onto the US Billboard Hot 100 at number 66, where it stayed on the chart for several weeks. Although the title track \\"Forever Young\\" was re-released several times as a single by the band's label in the hope of it becoming a hit in the United States, it did not reach any higher than number 65 on the Hot 100. Although it reached one position higher than \\"Big in Japan\\", it quickly fell into obscurity and \\"Big in Japan\\" remains their biggest-selling single in the US. \\"Big in Japan\\" also managed to peak at number 8 on the UK Singles Chart, while \\"Forever Young\\" was also considered a commercial failure there, reaching number 98. Re-release On March 15, 2019, the album was remastered for the first time for its 35th anniversary.

She was laid down 21 July 1975, launched 28 December 1976 and commissioned 3 June 1978. The ship operated from Norfolk, Virginia during her entire 25-year career. When decommissioned, she was part of Destroyer Squadron 22. History Briscoe conducted firing trials in 1981-1982 in support of the SALGP (Semi-Active Laser Guided Projectile) off the coast of Vieques, Puerto Rico. These projectiles were fired from the 5 inch (127 mm) gun at a range in excess of . While in flight, an optical sensor would detect the signature of a laser-painted target on shore and convert the shell to an actively homing rocket for pinpoint destruction of moving and stationary targets on shore. Participated in Operation Urgent Fury, the liberation of Grenada, and in the Multi-National Peacekeeping Forces off the coast of Lebanon, and in Baltic Operations 1990. Briscoe also participated as a member of Middle East Forces deploying twice to the North Red Sea conducting Maritime Interception Operations in support of U.N. sanctions against Iraq. Briscoe established a U.S. record of 275 merchant vessel boardings in the North Red Sea during the first of her two deployments to the area. In her second North Red Sea deployment in March 1994, Briscoe responded to a distress call in 19 May 1994 from an Egyptian passenger ferry, the Al-Qamar Al-Saudi Al-Misri. Briscoe acted as the On-Scene Commander for the ensuing rescue efforts for the over 500 passengers, coordinating the actions of the numerous vessels in the area. In 1996, Briscoe deployed to the Mediterranean and Black Sea for a six-month period. Deployed with Helicopter Antisubmarine Squadron Light 44 (Detachment 5), Briscoe in Exercise Atlas Hinge with the Tunisian navy and Exercise Shark Hunt and Jaws, an undersea warfare exercise against U.S. submarines in the Central and Eastern Mediterranean Sea. Briscoe took part in Exercise Classica 96, from 31 August through 9 September, in the spirit of Partnership for Peace. Ships from the U.S. 6th Fleet, Black Sea and Mediterranean littoral nations (including Italy, Ukraine, Greece. In 1999, at President Bill Clinton's orders, warships of the U.S. Navy assisted in the search for the crashed plane of John F. Kennedy Jr.. With the permission of Secretary of Defense William Cohen, a public memorial service for Kennedy was held aboard the Briscoe. Kennedy's ashes were later scattered from this ship and into the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Martha's Vineyard.Kennedy, Bessettes Given Shipboard Rites, WashingtonPost.com, 23 July 1999, retrieved 23 September 2010 Routine deployment workups were interrupted in 2001, as Briscoe responded to help provide aerial defense of the U.S. East Coast after the terrorist attacks, Sept. 11, 2001. In December 2002, Briscoe deployed as part of the Harry S. Truman Battle Group in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom. Briscoe was one of the first ships to fire Tomahawk cruise missiles on targets in Iraq, firing in total 25 missiles. Briscoe was decommissioned 2 October 2003. She was disposed of in support of a fleet training exercise on 25 August 2005. She lies at 34¬∞49‚ÄôN ‚Äì 72¬∞31‚ÄôW at a depth of 2,252 fathoms. =Awards= * Navy Unit Commendation - (Oct 1997-Apr 1998, Jan-May 2003) * Navy Meritorious Unit Commendation - (1 Aug 1998) * Battle \\"E\\" - (1980, 1992, 1995) * Navy Expeditionary Medal - (Jul-Sep 1980) * Southwest Asia Service Medal - (Aug-Oct 1992) * Humanitarian Service Medal - (18-20 may 1994) Ship's crest The ship's coat of arms is a reflection of the naval career of Admiral Robert Pearce Briscoe. Standing boldly at the base of the shield is the Lion of St. Mark, which refers to the Admiral's leadership as Commander in Chief of Allied Southern Forces Europe. The fess and wavy bar, immediately above the Lion of St. Mark, suggest flowing water passing warships and small land areas. This is reminiscent of the Northern Solomon Islands where Admiral Briscoe commanded the in World War II several important engagements. The shield is completed by four stars, symbolic of Admiral Briscoe's leadership achievement and rank. Atop the shield is a crest symbolic of further achievement in a long and successful career. The trident, symbol of Triton, ruler of the seas, refers to the United States Naval Academy where the Admiral served as a student, instructor and department head. The flash represents Prometheus' gift of science to mankind and alludes to Admiral Briscoe as one of the pioneers of modern electronics development in the Navy. The cross refers to the Navy Cross Admiral Briscoe received for his actions in the North Solomon Campaign. The crest is completed by the Taegeuk which denotes the Admiral's Far East Naval Command. The coat of arms is summed up by the ship's motto \\"Efficiency and Valor\\", given to the ship by former Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral Robert Carney, as a tribute to his close friend.

The USS Stump was decommissioned and stricken on 22 October 2004. History Stump was laid down 25 August 1975, launched 29 January 1977, and commissioned on 19 August 1978. The ship was named after Admiral Felix Stump, Commander of the U.S. Pacific Command from 1953 to 1958.U.S. Pacific Command  Official Military Website Stump's 1980 maiden deployment was to the Mediterranean, serving as flagship for Destroyer Squadron 14. Stump conducted Black Sea operations, port visits and extensive undersea warfare (USW) operations. As a result of her outstanding performance, Stump was awarded the \\"Hookem Award\\" for USW excellence by the commander of the U.S. 6th Fleet. A year later, Stump deployed as south Atlantic flagship for UNITAS XXII. It was on this cruise that Stump obtained its mascot Felix, a bluefronted Amazon parrot, during a port visit to Brazil. Stump was the first Spruance class ship to traverse the inland waterway of Chile. In October 1982, Stump deployed to the Persian Gulf as a part of the Middle East Force to conduct radar picket operations. Returning home in March 1983, she participated in Solid Shield '83, a complex exercise involving U.S. NATO ships and the U.S. Air Force. The ship went through a ten-month major overhaul at the Brooklyn Navy Yard. She was the first Spruance class ship to go outside Mississippi for a major overhaul. March 1984 was highlighted by Stump's adoption as state flagship of West Virginia. Stump then traveled to New Orleans as the U.S. Navy's host ship for the 1984 World's Fair. Also in 1984, Stump won the James F. Chezek Memorial Gunnery Award by shooting a 496 out of 500 during naval gunfire support qualifications. Admiral W. L. McDonald, Commander in Chief U.S. Atlantic Fleet, embarked in March 1985 for CARIBOPS '85. While in the Caribbean, Stump again shot naval gunfire support qualifications and scored 495 out of 500, winning the Atlantic Fleet \\"Top Gun\\" award for an unprecedented second year in a row. Stump then deployed for UNITAS XXVI/WATC '85. During the deployment, Stump showed the flag in port visits to eight South American nations and six West African nations. 1986 was significant for two reasons. First, Stump was chosen to become the test platform for the U.S. Navy's newest hull-mounted sonar, the AN/SQS-53C. Using advanced technology, the \\"53C\\" would be the sonar for the U.S. Navy combatants well into the twenty-first century. Secondly, Stump was awarded the COMDESRON TEN Battle \\"E\\" Efficiency award for overall excellence. In 1988, Stump deployed to the Mediterranean as part of the carrier battle group (MED 3‚Äì88). In April, and on 48-hour notice, Stump was directed to detach and proceed to the Persian Gulf to replace the which had suffered extensive damage from a naval mine explosion. 'Stump' returned to Norfolk, Virginia, in August. Stump was underway again in October for six weeks of Caribbean law enforcement operations. In December, 'Stump' was presented her second consecutive Battle \\"E\\" award by Rear Admiral Donnell, commander of the Naval Surface Force U.S. Atlantic Fleet. In October 1989, Stump again deployed to the Mediterranean as part of the carrier battle group (MED 1‚Äì90). During this deployment, Stump was extremely successful in conducting anti-submarine warfare exercises and was once again presented the \\"Hookem\\" award for excellence in undersea warfare. =1990s= In August 1990, Stump transited to Avondale Shipyard in New Orleans, Louisiana, for overhaul and major combat systems upgrade. She received the Vertical Launch System (VLS) for the BGM-109 Tomahawk missile. Stump also received the integrated AN/SQQ-89 USW system. In November 1992, Stump deployed to the Persian Gulf and Northern Red Sea as part of MEF (1‚Äì93) to serve as a ready strike platform. The highlights of the deployment was the Tomahawk missile strike launched against Iraq in support of Operation Southern Watch on 17 January 1993. In July 1994, Stump again deployed to South America for UNITAS XXXV serving as the flagship for the commander of the U.S. South Atlantic Force. Stump re-visited eight South American nations, as well as completing another transit of the Chilean inland waterway. In February 1995, Stump deployed to the Caribbean Sea in support of counter drug operations, transiting the Panama Canal. During this period Stump participated in a search and rescue mission in the Pacific. In cooperation with a Colombian Coast Guard cutter, Stump located and recovered a survivor of a wrecked Colombian vessel. Stump returned in April 1995. As part of a reorganization announced in mid-1995 of the Atlantic Fleet's surface combatant ships into six battle groups, nine destroyer squadrons and a new Western Hemisphere Group, Stump was reassigned to Destroyer Squadron Two. The reorganization was to be phased in over the summer and take effect on 31 August, with homeport shifts to occur through 1998. Stump deployed in August 1996 for a Middle Eastern Force cruise to conduct maritime interception operations and act as ready strike destroyer in the Persian Gulf. Stump relieved on 28 September as the maritime interception operations/strike platform in the northern Persian Gulf. While in the Persian Gulf, Stump completed over 40 boardings in support of maritime interdiction operations and participated in 11 Persian Gulf Tomahawk exercises, including one as launch area coordinator. A mainstay during this deployment, Stump remained underway for over eighty percent of the time she was in the Persian Gulf. Following the return from her Middle Eastern Force deployment in February 1997, Stump conducted an extensive dry-docking selected restricted availability and immediately commenced a training cycle which culminated in a final evaluation period. In January 1998 Stump commenced work- ups for its upcoming Sixth Fleet deployment by participating in COMPTUEX and JTFEX as part of the Eisenhower carrier battle group. In March 1998 the Sara Ann (a fishing trawler) was operating off the Virginia Capes when the seas became too much and she started taking on water. Stump, while conducting routine operations on 17 April 1998, was informed by United States Coast Guard Station Portsmouth that the Sara Ann was in distress. Stump subsequently rescued four civilians about 65 nautical miles off Cape Hatteras, North Carolina. Stump provided safe passage back to Norfolk, Virginia. Stump deployed to the Mediterranean as part of Sixth Fleet in June 1998. Stump, as part of Destroyer Squadron Two, joined five other nations and other U.S. Navy warships in the central Mediterranean for the execution of SHAREM 125, from 9 to 15 July 1998. SHAREM 125 was the latest in a series of SHAREM exercises designed to test and evaluate undersea warfare tactics, weapons, sensors and procedures. SHAREM is an established in 1969 to continuously improve the quality of undersea warfare. =2000s= Stump took part in the Fleet Battle Experiment Hotel (FBE-H) which was conducted by units of the U.S. 2nd Fleet and personnel of the Navy Warfare Development Command (NWDC) from 28 August to 12 September 2000 off the Virginia Capes and in the Gulf of Mexico. This was the eighth in a series of fleet battle experiments designed to evaluate new naval warfare concepts and technological capabilities. Under U.S. Joint Forces Command's overarching experiment, \\"Millennium Challenge 00\\", FBE-H ran concurrently with the U.S. Army's Joint Contingency Force Advanced Warfighting Experiment, the U.S. Air Force Joint Contingency Force Experiment 2000 and the U.S. Marine Corps' Millennium Dragon. The focus of FBE-H was the application of network-centric operations in gaining and sustaining access in support of follow-on joint operations. Access denial was expected to be the focus of any potential adversary's strategy. Specifically, FBE-H further developed NWDC's draft Access Concept entitled \\"Poseidon's Presence\\". In addition, the NATO exercise \\"Unified Spirit\\" ran concurrently with the JTFEX, with forces from Canada, Denmark, France, Germany and the United Kingdom playing major roles. Stump deployed in late November 2000 with the carrier battle group. Prior to that, Stump took part in Joint Task Force Exercise (JTFEX) 01-1, to certify the carrier battle group for deployment. This was the first deployment for Truman, which had been commissioned in 1998. The deployment included extensive operations in the Mediterranean Sea, Indian Ocean and primarily the Persian Gulf. While operating in the Persian Gulf, the Truman battle group enforced United Nations sanctions against Iraq by diverting 22 vessels with more than $5 million of suspected contraband cargo. Throughout the deployment, the battle group also participated in numerous international exercises, including Arabian Gauntlet, an 11-nation exercise that involved more than 20 ships. Additionally, U.S. sailors worked with military forces from Oman, Jordan, Tunisia, Kuwait, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates, improving interoperability and strengthening relationships with those countries. Stump, along with the rest of the battle group ships returned home on 24 May 2001. In mid October 2003 Stump operated off the coast of Argentina with the frigate as part of the annual UNITAS exercise which involved naval forces from Argentina, Brazil, Peru, Spain and Uruguay. = Deployments and ports of call = MED-MEF 3‚Äì88: Rota Spain, Ibiza Spain, Marseilles France, Cavaliere France, Genoa Italy, ASU Bahrain, with a brief stop for Suez Canal traffic in Port Said Egypt and a brief stop for fuel in Djibouti. Fate Stump was decommissioned 22 October 2004. Admiral Stump's great grandson, John Stump III served on the decommissioning crew in 2004. She was laid up at the inactive ships maintenance facility in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and sunk as a target along with her sister, off the coast of North Carolina on 7 June 2006. Ship's crest Ship's crest The distinguished naval career of Admiral Felix Stump is reflected in the ship's coat of arms. The many decorations received by Admiral Stump for his exemplary service in the Pacific Theater during World War II are represented in the shield. The blue silhouette cross refers to the Navy Cross twice awarded him while in command of Carrier Division 24; the white central star denotes the Silver Star Medal awarded \\"for conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity in action\\" against enemy-held islands. The Legion of Merit (which he was awarded three times) is indicated by the crossed arrows in scarlet and white. The U.S. Army Distinguished Service Medal, received for exceptionally meritorious services as commander of a combined operations center during the early part of the war, is represented by the colors scarlet, white and blue, the colors of the suspension ribbon of the medal. The four smaller stars in gold are in recognition of the attainment of the rank of admiral. The gold shield is symbolic of knowledge and achievement. Admiral Stump's navy career, his noted boldness, and his service aboard six aircraft carriers are presented by the griffin holding an anchor.

History Conolly was laid down 29 September 1975, launched 19 February 1977, and commissioned 14 October 1978. =1980s= From August to December 1980, Conolly deployed as part of the Middle East Force. She deployed as part of this force again from October 1981 to February 1982. In September 1982, she deployed to the Mediterranean including operations off the coast of Lebanon. In June 1983 Conolly deployed again participating in UNITAS XXIV, an annual exercise working with partner navies in South America. Conolly made multiple port visits and worked with a variety of South American navies before returning home in December of the same year. Conolly was the flagship for the cruise, with the staff of Commander, South Atlantic (COMSOLANT), Rear Admiral Clint Taylor, USN, embarked. Due to equipment casualties in the engineering plant while on the east coast of Chile, the crew had to repair in place the pneumatic clutch-brake assemblies on the two forward gas turbine engines, the second repair having to be completed at sea en route Montevideo, Uruguay. Once in port, the damaged LM-2500 Gas Turbine Main Engine was replaced in 82 hours, using a large floating crane in the port facility. In addition to the UNITAS cruise, Conolly left Brazil in November and sailed, initially in company with , east to conduct a West African Training Cruise (WATC). Conolly visited Liberville, Gabon; Lagos, Nigeria; Monrovia, Liberia and finally Dakar, Senegal, before transiting west to Roosevelt Roads, PR for a refueling stop before returning to her homeport of Norfolk, VA in mid-December, 1983. While sailing from Brazil, Conolly was required to conduct a transfer of fuel, while underway, to the Jesse L. Brown, so that ship would have sufficient fuel to make her port call in Equatorial Guinea. Conolly was the first Spruance-class vessel to complete such a task, which was not an assigned capability for the ships. Approximately 30,000 gallons were sent to the Brown using 2¬Ω\\" fire hoses to deliver the fuel, taking about 4 hours. In February, 1984, Conolly sailed to Portland, ME, to enter a regular overhaul (ROH) at the newly opened Bath Iron Works facility. The overhaul lasted 10 months, during which Conolly was fitted with the Tomahawk Weapons System. Also installed was the MK 15 Close in Weapons System and the Mk 23 Target Acquisition System. During the yard period, Commander Harry Maixner was relieved by Commander Gary Voorheis as Captain of the ship. In October 1985 Conolly once again deployed as part of the Middle East Force. During this deployment \\"Conolly\\" was involved in the boarding of an American flagged ship by the Iranian Navy. She returned from this deployment in April 1986. In June 1987 she made another deployment to the Mediterranean and followed this up with two more deployments in 1989 as part of the Middle East Force, and 1992 MIF (Maritime Interception Force)during Iraq war. =1990s= Conolly spent January 1991 at Metro Machine (now General Dynamics NASSCO) in Norfolk, Virginia for a regular overhaul (ROH).STG2 Arnesen (Crew Member) In 1993, Conolly was deployed in support of Operation Uphold Democracy, enforcing United Nations sanctions against Haiti. From 6 June to 10 June 1994, Conolly participated in World War II commemoration activities at Cavalaire-sur-Mer, France. That same year, Conolly deployed to the Arabian Peninsula, conducting maritime interception operations in the Red Sea in support of United Nations sanctions against Iraq. During that deployment, on 12 July 1994, Conolly came to the rescue of sixty-two crewmembers of the Panamanian-registered ferry Al Loloa following a fire on board the ferry. Conolly answered the vessel's distress call and proceeded to the scene of the fire. Sixty-one of the ferry's all Egyptian crew had already abandoned ship and were found safe in five life rafts. A survey team from Conolly boarded the Al Loloa and found the fire out of control. Before returning to Conolly, the survey team found the missing crewmember unharmed. As part of a reorganization announced in July 1995 of the U.S. Atlantic Fleet's surface combatant ships into six core battle groups, nine destroyer squadrons and a new Western Hemisphere Group, Conolly's homeport was changed from Norfolk, Virginia, to Mayport, Florida, with the shift to occur in 1996-1997\\\\. Conolly deployed with the carrier battle group, on 26 January 1996 for a regularly scheduled deployment. The previous December, the battle group and ARG participated in Joint Task Force Exercise 96-1, their \\"final examination\\" before deployment, and the culmination of a year of intense preparation. While deployed, Conolly took part in the Ships Anti-Submarine Warfare Readiness Effectiveness Measuring 114 (SHAREM) Invitational Exercise 1-96 (INVITEX), held 23 February ‚Äì 29 February. SHAREM 114 was a U.S. 6th Fleet naval exercise conducted in the Gulf of Valencia off the east coast of Spain. Following the completion of Operation Destined Glory 96, a NATO amphibious exercise, Conolly paid a visit to Augusta Bay, Sicily. Operation Destined Glory 96, lasted 16 days and was a NATO forces combined amphibious exercise which began 13 March and continued through 26 March. It tested forces in the air and at sea in the Central Mediterranean near Sardinia and in the Tyrrhenian Sea and also trained ashore at Capo Teulada, Sardinia. Military units from the NATO countries of Greece, Italy, Netherlands, Spain, Turkey and United States took part in the exercise which focused on undersea, surface, electronic and air warfare, and included communications and shiphandling skills. On 11 April, Conolly was tasked with escorting , and to Liberia from the Adriatic Sea in support of JTF Assured Response. Guam, Trenton, Portland and Conolly were conducting routine training when they were directed to the coastal waters off Liberia. Conolly also assisted in search and rescue efforts when the airplane carrying United States Commerce Department Secretary Ron Brown crashed. It participated in Operation Sharp Guard, enforcing United Nations Security Council resolutions in the former republics of Yugoslavia. While on station, Conolly queried 121 merchant vessels, ensuring no contraband cargo entered the troubled region. In June 1996, Conolly took part in Exercise TAPON 96, an allied exercise held in the Alboran Sea, Gulf of Cadiz and the eastern Atlantic Ocean. Conolly conducted combined warfare exercises with the Spanish aircraft carrier Principe de Asturias, and other surface ships including the Spanish frigates Baleares, Santa Maria, Numancia, the Greek destroyer Formion, the Spanish submarine Delf√≠n and the US submarine . Conolly participated in the nine-day exercise which emphasized procedures and tactics for effective maritime choke-point control. Conolly also completed live-firing exercises in the Central Mediterranean Sea at Avgo Nisi gun-firing range, a small island north of Crete, Greece. She then traveled toward Sicily and conducted a torpedo-firing exercise. In March 1997, Conolly moved its homeport from Norfolk, Virginia to Mayport, Florida.

Biography He was born in Berlin, the son of Prince Albert of Prussia (1809‚Äì1872) and his wife Princess Marianne (1810‚Äì1883), daughter of King William I of the Netherlands. His father was a brother of King Frederick William IV of Prussia and of William I, German Emperor. Albrecht entered the Prussian army in 1847, serving in the First Schleswig War and participating in the battles of Skalitz, Schweinsch√§del and K√∂niggr√§tz in the Austro-Prussian War in 1866. In the Franco-Prussian War in 1870 he commanded a guard cavalry brigade at Gravelotte and Sedan. After the fall of the Second Empire, he was subordinated to Edwin von Manteuffel in the fighting around Bapaume and St. Quentin. In 1874 he became commander of the X Corps stationed in Hannover. In 1883 he succeeded his uncle prince Charles as Herrenmeister of the Order of Saint John (Bailiwick of Brandenburg). In 1885, Albert was chosen as Regent for the Duchy of Brunswick, as German Chancellor Otto von Bismarck had removed Ernest Augustus, Crown Prince of Hanover, from office. In 1913 Ernst August's son Ernest Augustus, Duke of Brunswick became Duke of Brunswick who only reigned for 5 years and 6 days. After accepting the regency, Albert and Marie resided chiefly in Brunswick, Berlin, and Kamenz. Prince Albrecht died at Schloss Kamenz in 1906. He was buried in the Mausoleum auf dem Hutberge in the park of Schloss Kamenz. After World War II, the mausoleum was plundered and the bodies of Albert and his wife were reburied in the park. =Marriage and issue= On 9 April 1873 in Berlin he married Princess Marie of Saxe-Altenburg (1854‚Äì1898), daughter of Ernst I, Duke of Saxe-Altenburg (1826‚Äì1908) and his wife Agnes of Anhalt-Dessau (1824‚Äì1897). Albert's parents had been unhappily married to each other and were later divorced. His decision to wait until he was 36 before marrying is thought to have been a reflection of his parents' marital situation.

Affectionately nicknamed the \\"Moose\\" by her crews, she was named in honor of Vice Admiral Frederick Moosbrugger who is best known for his service in World War II as a highly successful commander of destroyer squadrons.  History  USS Moosbrugger was laid down 3 November 1975, launched 23 July 1977 and commissioned 16 December 1978. She arrived at her new home port at Charleston, South Carolina just prior to Christmas 1978 becoming the first of her class at that base. She conducted shakedown operations at Fleet Training Center, Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. She visited Port- au-Prince, Haiti, and Saint Thomas, United States Virgin Islands during this time. Following shakedown, USS Moosbrugger returned to her builders for post- commissioning refits and upgrades. While at Pascagoula, she was ordered to conduct an emergency sortie in order to avoid the worst effects of Hurricane Frederic, spending several days in the Gulf of Mexico while the storm system passed. Following her return to port, Moosbrugger supplied electrical power to portions of the shipyard to allow her refit to complete. It was in this refit that a pair of moose antlers were installed on the ship, just below the bridge windows. Moosbrugger deployed to the Mediterranean Sea on 14 July 1980, acting as flagship for Commander, Destroyer Squadron 20 for the entire deployment. She conducted anti-submarine warfare (ASW) and amphibious support operations during the deployment. Port visits included Rota, Spain, Naples, Italy, Cagliari, Italy, La Spezia, Italy, Marseilles, France, Benidorm, Spain, Cartagena, Spain, and Palma de Mallorca. She returned from this deployment on 11 December 1980. She was the test platform for the AN/SQR 19(V) tactical towed array sonar (TACTAS) in 1982. The USS Moosbrugger received the Meritorious Unit Commendation (MUC) for service as set forth in the following citation: In 1989, Moosbrugger made the final \\"Cold War\\" deployment to the Sixth Fleet as the primary ASW element of the USS Theodore Roosevelt Battle Group. =1990s= In August 1990, USS Moosbrugger was part of the initial United States response to Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait. She deployed on six days notice for Operation Desert Shield to join the rapidly formed USS John F Kennedy Battle Group. She deployed from Charleston SC and joined Kennedy en route to the Red Sea via the Mediterranean Sixth Fleet. In the months of coalition build-up prior to the beginning of hostilities, the Moosbrugger performed several important tasks. She was first tasked to delay her Suez transit by several weeks in order to be the US contribution to the standing up of NATO's Standing Naval Force Mediterranean making port calls in Italy and Balearic Islands. Completing her short stay with NATO, Moosbrugger transited the Suez in early September to rejoin Kennedy and immediately took a station in the North Red Sea entrance to the Gulf of Aqaba tasked with Visit, Board, Search and Seizure (VBSS) to support enforcement of UN Iraq Sanctions. In September and early October she stopped and boarded nearly 30 merchant ships bound for Jordan. Following a short maintenance period in Jidda, Saudi Arabia, she took onboard small contingents of U.S. Coast Guard personnel and Navy SEALS, both trained in VBSS and continued search and seizure operations until transiting back North through the Suez. Moosbrugger spent Christmas 1990 in Haifa, Israel, departing the following day back to the Suez Canal and Red Sea. When Operation Desert Storm began in January 1991, Moosbrugger was again assigned maritime interdiction patrol at the entrance to the Gulf of Aqaba. Her assignment was to stop, board, and search merchant vessels flagged by nations sympathetic to Iraq; and to prevent any war materials found onboard from reaching Jordan and ultimately Iraq. When hostilities ceased, Moosbrugger made ports-of-call in Egypt, Crete, and Gibraltar before crossing the Atlantic for the United States. Moosbrugger was awarded the Navy Unit Commendation for service during the Persian Gulf War. Moosbrugger performed an extensive update in Charleston shipyard which removed its forward anti-submarine missile launcher of the ASROC family and upgraded to the RUM-139 VL-ASROC vertical launching system (VLS). This allowed the ship the ability to fire Tomahawk missiles in addition to vertically launched ASROC. Moosbrugger relocated to Mayport, Florida, on 11 March 1995, from its previous home port of Charleston, South Carolina. The Spruance-class ship was the sixth of eleven ships scheduled for relocation to Mayport as a result of the 1993 Base Realignment and Closure Commission decision. Moosbrugger went into drydock to install women's living quarters and restrooms. She was one of the first surface warships to have women on it. The yard period in Mayport Florida was also to repair extensive issues encountered during the overhaul and upgrades performed at the Earl Shipyard in Charleston just a few years prior to. Following these extensive overhaul periods, Moosbrugger deployed in 1996, along with La Moure County (LST-1194), John L. Hall (FFG-32) and Narwhal (SSN-671), to take part in UNITAS 96, a series of combined tactical at-sea operations, amphibious operations and in-port exercises with participating South American naval forces. During that deployment, Moosbrugger spent almost two weeks in Venezuelan waters conducting anti-submarine warfare, electronic warfare and anti-air gunnery exercises in the Caribbean Sea. She then departed for Brazil for the next phase of UNITAS. Moosbrugger deployed in 1998, along with La Moure County, Doyle (FFG-39) and Boston (SSN-703), to take part in UNITAS 39‚Äì98, serving as the USCOMSOLANT flagship with COMDESRON 32 as the Operational Commander. UNITAS, Latin for unity, consists of at-sea operations, amphibious operations, riverine operations and in port exercises conducted with nine South American navies over a four-month period. The U.S. task group circumnavigated South America in a clockwise direction, returning to Naval Station Roosevelt Roads in November. The 40-year-old operation promotes a cooperative maritime strategy in the region while supporting the U.S. policy of continued engagement in South America through forward presence. The navies of Canada, United Kingdom, the Netherlands and South Africa joined the United States and South American navies for the first phase of UNITAS. This phase was led by the United States and conducted in the vicinity of Puerto Rico. The U.S. Navy's longest-running annual deployment began at Naval Station Roosevelt Roads, Puerto Rico, as seven ships from four foreign navies joined a five ship U.S. task group. While in Puerto Rico, on 20 April 1998, Moosbrugger took part in Independent Deployer Exercise (INDEX) 98-2, off the coast of Puerto Rico. During the exercise, Moosbrugger fired two Sea Sparrows from her deck at guided target drones launched from the Atlantic Fleet Weapons Training Facility at Naval Station Roosevelt Roads. The exercise also included target drones fired from A-4 Skyhawk aircraft. Following this, the task force then headed for Venezuela on 18 July as Venezuela, Brazil, Uruguay, Argentina, Chile, Paraguay, Peru, Ecuador, and Colombia each directed, in turn, their own phase of UNITAS. Overall, U.S. forces worked with host navies from Venezuela, Brazil, Uruguay, Argentina, Paraguay, Chile, Peru, Ecuador and Colombia. The specific exercises conducted in each phase are determined by the host navy, making each phase unique. Exercises included all areas of modern naval warfare including anti-air, amphibious, anti-surface and anti-submarine warfare. Fate Moosbrugger was placed in commission, in reserve on 16 October 2000 at Mayport, Florida to prepare for decommissioning. On 15 December 2000, she was decommissioned and subsequently brought to Philadelphia Naval Intermediate Ship Maintenance Facility. She was maintained there in Maintenance Category B for activation in time of national emergency until 2006, when she was towed to Brownsville, Texas, for dismantling.  Ship's crest  Ship's crestThe official crest of USS Moosbrugger symbolizes the dedication and courage displayed by her namesake, Vice Admiral Frederick Moosbrugger, during World War II. The trident, an attribute of Neptune, god of the seas, represents the awesome strength and dominance of the modern destroyer. It also resembles the letter \\"M,\\" an allusion to the initial letter of Moosbrugger, the ship's namesake. The ship's motto is \\"More than Required\\". Through the heraldic fountain for water, the grappling iron (a device used for close range, early naval encounters), and the torpedo, the crest commemorates the Battle of Vella Gulf in the South Pacific during World War II. The then-Commander Moosbrugger led his ships into exceedingly close range against Japanese naval forces; took the enemy by surprise, and delivered a devastating torpedo attack, thereby annihilating the hostile force. For this action, he was awarded the Navy Cross. The gold laurel wreath is symbolic of Vice Admiral Frederick Moosbrugger's long and distinguished career.

The detector itself is hidden behind the dark red concrete wall behind the electronics trailer. H1 was a particle detector that operated at HERA (Hadron Elektron Ring Anlage) in DESY, Hamburg. The first studies for the H1 experiment have proposed in 1981 and the H1 detector began operating together with HERA in 1992 and took data until 2007. The detector consisted of several different detector components and was about 12 x 15 x 10 meters big and weighs 2800 tons. It was accompanied by further detectors in both directions of the HERA accelerator and by an electronics trailer three stories high. The main physics goals of the H1 experiment were the investigation of the internal structure of the proton through measurements of deep inelastic scattering, the measurements of further cross sections to study fundamental interactions between particles in order to test the Standard Model of particle physics, as well as searching for particles beyond the Standard Model. The name H1 is used for both, the detector itself and the collaboration of physicists and technicians who operated the experiment. History The construction of an lepton-proton collider was recommended strongly by ECFA on May 9, 1980 . The first proposals for the H1 detector have been made in 1981 and the letter of intent for the H1 experiment was published on June 28, 1985 . The technical proposal for the H1 detector was finalized on March 25, 1986 . The H1 detector was operational with the first collisions of HERA in 1992. It was upgraded during the HERA luminosity upgrade for the HERA-II running period from 2000 to 2003. The H1 detector then took data until the shutdown of HERA in June 2007 and was mostly dismantled afterwards. Several subdetector components are now exhibited in the HERA Hall West at DESY. The HERA North Hall, where the H1 detector was located, is now used for other particle physics and gravitational experiments by DESY. The data taken with the H1 detector are preserved for future analyses within the DPHEP (Data Preservation and Long Term Analysis in High Energy Physics) initiative . The \\"sister experiment\\" of H1 at the HERA accelerator is the ZEUS experiment, which is also a multi-purpose detector with similar physics goals as H1. The H1 Collaboration The H1 experiment was designed and operated by an international collaboration of about 400 physicists and technicians from 43 institutes in 18 countries (List of currently participating institutes). The H1 Detector Leptons (electrons or positrons) are collided with protons by HERA in the interaction point of H1 and the particles produced in these collisions were detected by the H1 detector components. The reaction products, often including the proton remnant and the scattered lepton, are detected by several subdetectors. Combination of their information allows the identification of particles from the reaction, or at least the reconstruction of the overall reaction kinematics. This in turn allows the classification of the reaction. From the center outwards, H1's most important systems are: * Silicon trackers for the determination of primary and secondary vertices. * Jet chambers for the measurement of charged particle tracks. * Liquid Argon (LAr) calorimeter for the measurement of electromagnetic and hadronic showers. * Lead/scintillating fibre calorimeter (SpaCal) in the backward direction for the measurement of the scattered lepton. * The superconducting solenoidal magnet to bend the charged particles trajectories. * Muon detectors in the iron magnet yoke surrounding H1 and in the forward direction. In addition to these systems, H1 has several helper systems, such as a luminosity system, ToF (time of flight) detectors and radiation monitors. Also in the course of time additional detector systems have been added as the focus on special physics processes has become bigger. For example, forward instrumentation for diffractive physics has been added far down the HERA tunnel. While H1 is a general purpose detector its main design feature is an asymmetric construction to cope with the boosted center of mass in the laboratory frame due to the large energy imbalance of the colliding beams. In the forward (incident proton) direction the instrumentation has higher granularity to give a better resolution for refined measurement of the proton remnant left after the collision with the incident lepton. In the backward direction, where the lepton is mostly scattered into the detectors were optimized for the reconstruction of the scattered lepton trajectory. Physics addressed by H1 The most interesting physics topics treated at H1 include * Cross section measurements of reactions with charged and neutral electroweak currents * Studies of proton structure and determination of quark and gluon parton distribution functions * Tests of QCD in jet and particle production * Production of heavy quarks (charm and bottom) * Tests of Electroweak theory * Diffraction (physics with the exchange of a pomeron) * Search for physics beyond the Standard Model (For example, the substructure of quarks / contact interactions, Leptoquarks, magnetic monopole)  External links  * H1 public homepage * H1 public and collaboration homepage * List of Publications Category:Particle experiments Category:Buildings and structures in Altona, Hamburg de:Deutsches Elektronen- Synchrotron#H1 ","title":"H1 (particle detector)"},{"id":"553575","text":"USS Leftwich (DD-984) was a Spruance-class destroyer built by the Ingalls Shipbuilding Division of Litton Industries at Pascagoula, Mississippi. She was named for Lieutenant Colonel William G. Leftwich, Jr.,USMC biography of LtCol William Leftwich USMC (1931‚Äì1970), commander of the 1st Reconnaissance Battalion who was killed in action during Operation Imperial Lake in Qu·∫£ng Nam Province South Vietnam on 18 November 1970 in a helicopter crash during the extraction of one of his reconnaissance teams. For this action, Lieutenant Colonel Leftwich received the Silver Star. Lieutenant Colonel Leftwich's medals and awards include: the Navy Cross, the Silver Star (posthumous), the Legion of Merit with Combat \\"V\\" and two gold stars, the Meritorious Service Medal, the Air Medal with one gold star, the Purple Heart with two gold stars, and various personal awards from the Republic of Vietnam. Leftwich was laid down on 12 November 1976; and launched 8 April 1978; and commissioned 25 August 1979 under the command of Commander Al Carney. The Commissioning speaker was the Chief of Naval Operations, Admiral Thomas B. Hayward, USN, who was a classmate of Bill Leftwich at the United States Naval Academy. Also in attendance at the Commissioning was H. Ross Perot, also a classmate of Lieutenant Colonel Leftwich. Both of Colonel Leftwich's sons and his widow attended the commissioning as well.  1979‚Äì1985  Leftwich sailed from Pascagoula, MS the morning following the commissioning on 26 August 1979, en route via the Panama Canal for her homeport, Naval Station San Diego, from which she operated until March 1985. On sailing, Hurricane David was threatening to make its way into the Gulf of Mexico, so shipping traffic on the transit to the Panama Canal was unusually light. Hurricane David did strike the Gulf coast, and was followed shortly after by Hurricane Frederic, which caused many ships at Ingalls Shipbuilding and Drydock to sortie into the hurricane. The Leftwich made one of the fastest transits on record of the Panama Canal, making the passage without having to anchor. On sailing north in the Pacific Ocean, Leftwich found herself behind Hurricane Guillermo, which tracked along the western coast of Mexico, and then turned westward out into the Pacific, allowing the ship to arrive at her new homeport on schedule. While following the storm, Leftwich experienced waves. In the few months after arrival in San Diego, CA, Leftwich conducted \\"Shakedown\\" training under the guidance of Fleet Training Group, Pacific, in the San Diego Operations Area (OPAREA). In January 1980, Leftwich returned to Litton Industries at Pascagoula, MS for Warranty repairs and a Post-Shakedown Availability, which included the installation of the NATO Sea Sparrow and Harpoon missile system. On 29 November 1982 she collided with the submarine USS Thomas A. Edison (SSBN-610) approximately east of Subic Bay, Philippines. Both ships were conducting war games. Thomas A. Edison was at periscope depth when the collision occurred. Both ships suffered damage and returned to Subic Bay. Edison suffered damage to her sail, sail planes, and sonar dome. Leftwich suffered damage to her sonar dome, sonar dome \\"banjo\\" strut, and forward fuel storage tanks located in the forward hull. Two months later, Thomas A. Edison made a surface transit to Puget Sound Naval Shipyard for decommissioning without the damage having been repaired. In 1984, Leftwich suffered hull and sonar window damage due to high-speed operations in heavy seas during fleet exercises on her deployment to Indian Ocean/Western Pacific (WESTPAC 1984).  1985‚Äì1998  On 1 April 1985 Leftwich arrived at her new homeport of Naval Station Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. This remained her homeport for the rest of her career. Leftwich, under the command of RADM (then Commander) Daniel Bowler, participated in Operation Nimble Archer on 19 October 1987. This was a response to Iran's 16 October 1987 attack on the MV Sea Isle City, a reflagged Kuwaiti oil tanker at anchor off Kuwait, with a Silkworm missile. Leftwich with Helicopter Anti-Submarine Squadron 3 Detachment 5 embarked, arrived at Naval Station Pearl Harbor homeport. In 1990‚Äì91, under the command of Commander Patrick Garrett in support of Operation Desert Shield/Desert Storm, the destroyer conducted more than 200 merchant ship interceptions and one boarding. She was one of the first ships to fire BGM-109 Tomahawk cruise missiles during the conflict, and was the first combatant to conduct a wartime reload of Tomahawks for continued operations. With embarked helicopters and SEALs, she captured the first Iraqi territory repatriated in the war (an island off the coast of the al-Faw waterway), multiple enemy prisoners of war, and conducted 16 combat search and rescue cases. For her efforts in the Persian Gulf, The Leftwich and her crew were awarded the Navy Unit Commendation Ribbon and the Combat Action Ribbon. During her career, Leftwich made eight deployments in the Western Pacific Ocean, Indian Ocean and Persian Gulf. She participated in Operation Nimble Archer, Desert Shield, and Desert Storm as well as operations in support of UN sanctions against Iraq. Leftwich was decommissioned and stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 27 March 1998. She was sunk as a target on 1 August 2003 at in the Pacific Ocean.

Cushing was a built by the Ingalls Shipbuilding Division of Litton Industries at Pascagoula, Mississippi. Cushing operated out of Yokosuka, Japan for the last several years of her career. Cushing was the last Spruance-class destroyer to remain in active service, until decommissioned on 21 September 2005. History USS Cushing sailing through the South China Sea in April 2001. USS Cushing enters Guam's Apra Harbor in October 2001. Cushing being towed to the mothball fleet Cushing was laid down 27 December 1976 by Ingalls Shipbuilding in Pascagoula, Mississippi. She was launched on 17 June 1978 and commissioned on 21 September 1979. Cushing was the last U.S. warship to transit the Panama Canal prior to control of the canal being handed over to Panama in 1979. Prior to its formal commissioning, Cushing departed her builders in Mississippi in order to avoid the oncoming Hurricane Frederic. She remained in the Gulf of Mexico with a crew of U.S. Navy sailors and ship builder personnel. After the passage of the storm, she returned to her builders yard for final outfitting and was quickly commissioned with her crew in dungarees in the helo hangar and deck prior to departure for her first homeport of San Diego, California where she was formally commissioned on 21 September 1979 in its home port. During the mid- to-late 1980s Cushing was a member of the Pacific Fleet Anti-Submarine Warfare Squadron--Destroyer Squadron 31. She was specially modified to support the DESRON staff operations and served as the primary flagship. She was also one of the few of the class that carried the AN/SQR-15 Towed Array Sonar System. In the early 1990s Cushing served to demonstrate the effectiveness of rudder roll stabilization (RRS). Engineers from the Carderock Division of the Naval Surface Warfare Center installed the developmental RRS system and monitored its operations. The successful demonstration led to RRS being implemented in Arleigh Burke-class (DDG-51) destroyers. While home ported in Pearl Harbor HI, Cushing conducted cruises in the North Pacific in 1991 and 1992 with visits to the west coast and Canada. In 1992 Cushing deployed to Central and South America as the flagship for UNITAS 33, 92. Cushing passed through the Panama Canal from Pacific to Atlantic side in 1992 embarked the Admiral at Puerto Rico. Cushing circumnavigated South America and passed through the Panama Canal again from the Pacific to the Atlantic side in less than 6 months. After disembarking the Admiral in Puerto Rico the Cushing passed through the Panama Canal again on her return voyage to San Diego then home port Pearl Harbor HI in late 1992. 1993 was spent conducting short cruieses at sea around HI and in 1994 Cushing entered dry dock at Pearl Harbor for, among other things, the addition of the VLS (vertical launch system) missile package. As part of a 1995 reorganization of the Pacific Fleet's surface ships into six core battle groups and eight destroyer squadrons, with the reorganization scheduled to be completed by 1 October, and homeport changes to be completed within the following year, Cushing was reassigned to Destroyer Squadron 5. A prototype Remote Minehunting System (RMS) was installed onboard Cushing in time for the Fall 1996 deployment to provide the battle group with a mine reconnaissance capability. This was an upgrade of the system successfully used in 1995 with the additional capability for shipboard launch and recovery and direct interface to the shipboard system. In fiscal year 1997, the RMS concept was successfully demonstrated by employment of a prototype system from Cushing during a Persian Gulf exercise. In early 1997, Cushing was conducting Maritime Interception Operations in the Persian Gulf. Cushing departed Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, on 16 March 1998, for its new home port of Yokosuka, Japan. The destroyer had been homeported in Pearl Harbor since 1991 and was set to replace which was changing homeports to Everett, Washington. During her time in Pearl Harbor, Cushing made four Western Pacific deployments and one to the South Atlantic. Upon arrival in Japan, Cushing was assigned to Commander, Destroyer Squadron 15, and deployed in May to participate in CARAT '98, a multi-national exercise with navies of Southeast Asian nations. CARAT '98 was the fourth annual Cooperation Afloat Readiness and Training (CARAT) exercise held between the United States and six Southeast Asia countries from 12 May to 5 August 1998. As part of a series of bilateral training exercises, CARAT 98 had U.S. forces training with military forces of Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, Singapore, and the Philippines. CARAT '98 demonstrated U.S. commitment to security and stability in Southeast Asia while increasing the operational readiness and capabilities of U.S. forces. The exercise also promoted interoperability and cooperation with U.S. regional friends and allies by offering a broad spectrum of mutually beneficial training opportunities. From 22 March to 25 March 1999 Cushing operated along with Battle Force 7th Fleet and took part in a multi-national live-fire missile exercise (MTX 99) in waters near the Marianas Islands. Also involved in the MTX 99 were naval units from Australia, Canada, Singapore, and South Korea. Fired during MTX 99 were live weapons which included Harpoon, Penguin and Maverick missiles, torpedoes and various shipboard weapons systems. The former was used as the target vessel. Cushing took part in the 38th Foal Eagle exercise held in the fall of 1999. A regularly scheduled exercise, Foal Eagle combined forces from South Korea and the United States. In August 2000, Cushing took part in SHAREM 138. Cushing and various units in the Forward Deployed Naval Force (FDNF), participated in SHAREM (Ship ASW Readiness Effectiveness Measuring) 138 along with units from the host, Japan Maritime Self Defense Force near Okinawa, Japan. Although weather conditions curtailed SHAREM events, valuable training was accomplished in the art of Undersea Warfare (USW). Cushing took part in Missile Exercise (MISSILEX) 01-1 which was held 17 November to 18 November 2000 as part of a coordinated task group operation. During a Naval Surface Fire Support exercise held near Guam on 4‚Äì5 December 2000, the Cushing posted a better-than-perfect score during a gun shoot. The exercise was designed to test the accuracy and effectiveness of Cushing‚Äôs guns and the proficiency of its watch teams. When the grade sheets were tallied, with bonus points for superior communications performance, Cushing was awarded 101.5 points out of 100. Cushing was honored by Commander, Destroyer Squadron 15, when she received the Silver Enlisted Surface Warfare Excellence Pennant on 25 January 2001. As a result, Cushing was now authorized to fly the pennant as all enlisted personnel E5 and senior have qualified as enlisted surface warfare specialists within the required time standard set forth by the Chief of Naval Operations. Cushing was the first ship of Destroyer Squadron 15 to qualify for this award. On 5 July 2002, a U.S. Navy Sikorsky UH-3H Sea King, Desert Duck 744, operated by HC-2, Detachment 2, suffered a tail rotor failure while landing aboard Cushing. It spun out of control and went over the starboard side. The seven on board got out safely. On 7 November 2003, Cushing began joint exercise Annualex 15G, which included maneuvers with the Japanese Navy. =Fate= Cushing operated out of Yokosuka, Japan for the last several years of her career. Cushing was the last Spruance- class ship to remain in active service, until decommissioned and stricken from the Navy list on 21 September 2005. GlobalSecurity.org showed the ship listed for grant transfer to Turkey.Ship Transfers / Transfer of Naval Vessels according to Public Law 109-134 109th Congress . Ex-Cushing was sunk as a target on 14 July 2008navsource.org USS CUSHING (DD-985) during RIMPAC 2008 along with , and . Ship's crest Cushings coat of arms symbolizes the spirit and endeavors of William Barker Cushing, as well as the tradition of destroyers named in honor of this naval officer. The predominant colors of dark blue and gold are traditionally associated with the Navy and symbolize the sea and excellence. The indented division of the shield represents a log boom and pile and is suggestive of the manner in which Commander Cushing accomplished the sinking of CSS Albemarle. The upper area of the pile is red, alluding to the danger of this famous action and that Commander Cushing was under enemy fire more than any other Union Navy officer. The lion's head is a symbol of courage and strength and signifies the character of Commander Cushing. His spirit is also reflected in the ship's motto, \\"Non Sibi Sed Patriae\\", a statement attributed to the ancient Roman Cicero that translates to \\"Not for Self but for Country\\". The trident is a traditional maritime symbol and its sharp points suggest offensive action. The spar torpedo is dark blue alluding to the dark night and the covert nature of the sinking of Albemarle. The dark blue also recalls the fact that Commander Cushing took the torpedo, at that time a Confederate weapon, and successfully used it to sink an enemy vessel. The five stars refer to the fact that Cushing is the fifth ship in the U.S. Navy to carry the name. =Awards= * Navy Unit Commendation - (Jan-May 2003) * Navy Meritorious Unit Commendation - (Jun-Sep 1984, Jan-Dec 2001) * Battle \\"E\\" - (1982, 1984, 1987, 1997) * Navy Expeditionary Medal - (Jul-Sep 1981) * Humanitarian Service Medal - (2 Oct 1981) See also *List of United States Navy destroyers References External links * *Article on decommissioning * *navsource.org: USS Cushing *navysite.de: USS Cushing *USS Cushing Association Facebook Page Category:Spruance-class destroyers Category:Cold War destroyers of the United States Category:United States Navy Wisconsin-related ships Category:1978 ships Category:Ships sunk as targets ","title":"USS Cushing (DD-985)"},{"id":"553585","text":"USS Harry W.

He was a pioneer in television commercials with his oddball \\"Madman\\" persona ‚Äì an alter ego who generated publicity with his unusual costumes, stunts, and outrageous claims. Muntz also pioneered car stereos by creating the Muntz Stereo-Pak, better known as the 4-track cartridge, a predecessor to the 8-track cartridge developed by Lear Industries. He invented the practice that came to be known as Muntzing, which involved simplifying otherwise complicated electronic devices. Muntz produced and marketed the first black-and-white television receivers to sell for less than $100, and created one of the earliest functional widescreen projection TVs. He was credited with coining the abbreviation \\"TV\\" for television, although the term had earlier been in use in call letters for stations such as WCBS-TV. A high school dropout, Muntz made fortunes by selling automobiles, TV receivers, and car stereos and tapes. A 1968 Los Angeles Times article noted that in one year he sold $72 million worth of cars, that five years later he sold $55 million worth of TV receivers, and that in 1967 he sold $30 million worth of car stereos and tapes. After his success as a used car salesman and with Kaiser-Frazer dealerships in Los Angeles and New York City, Muntz founded the Muntz Car Company, which made the \\"Muntz Jet\\", a sports car with jet-like contours. The car was manufactured between 1951 and 1953, although fewer than 400 were produced. Muntz married seven times. His wives included actress Joan Barton (who appeared in Angel and the Badman with John Wayne) and Patricia Stevens of the Patricia Stevens Finishing schools. Phyllis Diller was among his many girlfriends. He was friends with celebrities such as singer Rudy Vallee, comedian Jerry Colonna, actor Bert Lahr, television presenter Dick Clark, and cowboy actor Gene Autry. Early career: 1922‚Äì1953 Muntz was fascinated by electronics from an early age. He built his first radio at age 8 and built another for his parents' car at age 14. During the Great Depression, at age 15, he dropped out of Elgin High School to work in his parents' hardware store in Elgin, Illinois. =Car sales= An example of a matchbook ad for Muntz car lots in the 1950s In 1934, Muntz opened his first used car lot, in Elgin, with a $500 ($ in ) line of credit. He was only 20 years old, and his mother had to sign the car-sale papers because legally he was too young to close his own deals. During a vacation in California, Muntz discovered that used cars sold there for far higher prices; so he moved to California in 1940 at age 26 to open a used car lot in Glendale. On a hunch, he purchased 13 brand-new right- hand-drive vehicles to resell. These vehicles had been built for customers in Asia, but could not be delivered due to World War II. One vehicle was a custom-made Lincoln built for Chiang Kai-shek. Local newspapers ran stories about the unusual cars, and Muntz sold them all within two weeks, still in their original shipping crates. Muntz soon opened a second lot in Los Angeles and closed his lot in Elgin. Muntz rejected the then common opinion that used car salesmen should project a staid image. He realized the possibilities of generating publicity with odd stunts, and developed a \\"Madman\\" persona as a result. His flamboyant billboards and oddball television and radio commercials soon made him famous. In his used auto commercials, he marketed one model as the \\"daily special\\"; Muntz claimed that if the car did not sell that day, he would smash it to pieces on camera with a sledgehammer. Another notorious Muntz used-car TV pitch was \\"I buy 'em retail and sell 'em wholesale ... it's more fun that way!\\" His commercials generated so much publicity that comedians such as Bob Hope, Jack Benny, and Steve Allen often tried to outdo each other during television appearances by telling \\"Madman\\" Muntz jokes. University of Southern California fans would spell out Muntz's name during halftime as a prank. During the war, the Office of Price Administration sought to suspend Muntz' license to sell automobiles subject to price control. On August 1, 1945, Muntz was acquitted of an O.P.A. charge of violating used car regulations by Superior Judge Reuben H. Schmidt in Los Angeles.Associated Press, \\"'Mad Man' Muntz Foils O.P.A. Charge\\", The San Bernardino Daily Sun, San Bernardino, California, Thursday August 2, 1945, Volume 51, page 2. Muntz's car lots became tourist attractions due to the widespread publicity from his television commercial appearances. A 1946 survey by Panner Motor Tours revealed that they ranked seventh among tourist attractions in Southern California. Muntz was willing to take large risks in his attempts to generate publicity. During the era of McCarthyism, he asked one of his advisers, \\"Do you think I'd make the front pages if I joined the Communist Party?\\" =Muntz Jet= A mint-condition 1953 Muntz Jet at a Monterey, California, classic car auction In 1948, race car designer and Kurtis-Kraft founder Frank Kurtis attempted to market a new sports car, the two-seater Kurtis Kraft Sport. Only 36 units had been sold by 1950. In 1951, for just $200,000 ($ in ) Kurtis sold the cars' manufacturing license to Muntz, who quickly rebadged them as the \\"Muntz Jet\\". Initial production of the Jet took place in Glendale, where Muntz extended the two-seater Kurtis Kraft Sport's body by , making it a four- seater, and exchanged the Ford V8 engine for a larger Cadillac V8. Later, after making just 28 Jets in California, Muntz moved production to a new factory in Evanston, Illinois, extended the body further by , and replaced the Cadillac V8 with a less expensive Lincoln sidevalve V8. The Jet was featured on the cover of the September 1951 issue of Popular Science along with a Jaguar and an MG. It featured its own design, with aluminum body panels and a removable fiberglass top. Paint schemes were extravagant, with names like \\"Mars Red\\", \\"Stratosphere Blue\\", and \\"Lime Mist\\", and interior options included alligator or Spanish leatherette. The backseat armrests contained a full cocktail bar. The Jet was capable of a top speed of and acceleration of 0‚Äì50 mph (0‚Äì80 km/h) in 6 seconds, a significant achievement for a road car at the time. The fastest production car in 1953 was the Pegaso Z-102 Supercharged sports car at . Jet owners included then-CEO of CBS Frank Stanton, and actors Mickey Rooney and Lash La Rue. The labor and materials required to produce the Jet resulted in a high price for the end product and, in 1954, after selling about 400 cars and losing about $1,000 ($ in ) on each, Muntz closed the company. Today, Muntz Jets are prized collector cars and are recognized as predecessors to the Chevrolet Corvette and Ford Thunderbird. =Muntz TV= Muntz started plans to sell television receivers in 1946, and sales began in 1947. Muntz played the madman in his unorthodox television commercials, but in fact he was a shrewd businessman and a self-taught electrical engineer. By trial and error, taking apart and studying Philco, RCA, and DuMont televisions, he figured out how to reduce the devices' electrical components to their minimum functional number. This practice became known as \\"Muntzing\\". In the 1940s and 1950s, most brands of television receivers were complicated pieces of equipment, commonly containing about 30 vacuum tubes, as well as rheostats, transformers, and other heavy components. As a result, they were usually very expensive: the cheapest U.S.-manufactured receiver made before World War II used a screen and cost $125 ($ in ); the cheapest model with a screen cost $445 ($ in ). By 1954, although broadcast television in the United States had existed in various forms since 1928, only 55 percent of U.S. households owned a receiver. By contrast, eight years later, 90 percent of U.S. households had one. A 1951 Muntz TV model 17A3A Muntz developed a television chassis that produced an acceptable monochrome picture with 17 tubes. He often carried a pair of wire clippers, and when he thought that one of his employees was \\"overengineering\\" a circuit, he would begin snipping components out until the picture or sound stopped working. At that point, he would tell the engineer \\"Well, I guess you have to put that last part back in\\" and walk away. Marketed under the name \\"Muntz\\" by his company Muntz TV, Inc., the simplified units were the first black and white TV receivers to retail in the U.S. for less than $100. Muntz was also the first retailer to measure his screens from corner to corner rather than by width. The receivers sold well and were reliable partly because fewer tubes created less heat. The sets worked well in metropolitan areas that were close to television transmission towers where signals were strong. They worked poorly with weaker signals, as most of the components that Muntz had removed were intended to boost performance in fringe areas. This was a calculated decision: Muntz preferred to leave the low-volume, high-performance television receiver market to firms such as RCA and Zenith Electronics, as his intended customers were primarily urban dwellers with limited funds. Additionally, many urban apartment buildings had rules prohibiting external television antennas, and installation of an antenna, even if allowed, cost as much as $150. Muntz solved this problem by adding a built-in antenna to his receivers. In 1952, Muntz TV Inc. grossed $49.9 million ($ in ). Muntz continued with his \\"Madman\\" persona in many of his advertisements. In one TV commercial that normally aired after The Ed Sullivan Show, Muntz, dressed in red long johns and a Napoleon hat, promoted his new televisions by saying, \\"I wanna give 'em away, but Mrs. Muntz won't let me. She's crazy!\\" Another TV commercial presented a marching-band song with lyrics about Muntz TVs and incorporated animations by Oskar Fischinger. His radio commercials, which Muntz ran up to 170 times a day, initially followed a classical music theme built around the spelling of Muntz's name. However, he soon convinced radio stations to run ads more in line with his persona. In one spot, Muntz screamed \\"Stop staring at your radio!\\" He followed up his radio ads with a direct mail campaign, collecting thousands of TV knobs and mailing them to prospective customers with a note saying, \\"Call us and we'll show up with the rest of the set!\\" Some sources credit Muntz with inventing the abbreviation \\"TV\\". Muntz used skywriting as one of his marketing tactics, but, after watching one of his ads being created, he noted that the letters began to blur and dissipate before the pilot could finish spelling out \\"Muntz Televisions\\". So Muntz came up with the abbreviation \\"TV\\". However, \\"TV\\" had earlier been used in the call letters of television stations, such as WCBS-TV, which adopted those call letters in 1946.Fred R. Shapiro, Antedating of TV (quoting New York Times, August 31, 1946) (accessed August 27, 2008). Muntz also named his daughter \\"Tee Vee\\", although she normally went by \\"Teena\\" and, later, \\"Tee\\". Audio and video: 1954‚Äì1985 Despite his early success, sales later declined and Muntz's creditors refused to provide further financing in 1954. Muntz admitted his business lost $1,457,000 from April to August 1953, and although he tried to reorganize, Muntz TV filed bankruptcy and went out of business in 1959. (The company would be reorganized and last through the 1960s, but without its namesake at the helm.) However, Muntz's success continued in the sales of cars and general consumer electronics. =4-track cartridge= Attempting to combine his two main product lines, cars and stereos, Muntz invented the Muntz Stereo-Pak 4-track tape cartridge. 4-track was the direct predecessor of the Stereo 8 cartridge, also known as the 8-track, later developed by American inventor Bill Lear. The Stereo-Pak cartridge was based on the endless-loop Fidelipac cartridge, which was being used by radio stations, designed by inventor George Eash. Muntz chose stereo recording as a standard feature because of its wide availability. Before Muntz developed the Stereo-Pak, the only in-car units capable of recorded playback were phonograph-based players, such as the Highway Hi-Fi invented by Peter Goldmark. These units played special 16 rpm records or 45 rpm records, however they tended to skip whenever the vehicle hit a bump in the road, and attempts to alleviate this by increasing the pressure on the arm caused discs to wear out prematurely. Muntz designed a stereo tape player called the Autostereo for cars and had it inexpensively manufactured in Japan. The Autostereo could play a complete album without changing tracks or turning the tape over, did not suffer from skipping or premature wear as the phonograph-based players did, and its number of knobs and controls were minimized to allow the driver to concentrate on the road. The tape player gave customers greater control over their listening experiences, because the tapes never ran advertisements or public service announcements, unlike radio broadcasts. Muntz sold the players and cartridges from his own stores and through franchises in Florida and Texas. Muntz audio products were so profitable by 1962 that he cancelled his agreements with tape-duplicating companies and founded his own company to manufacture prerecorded Stereo-Pak cartridges. Most record companies did not manufacture Stereo-Pak cartridges themselves; however, the Muntz Electronics Corporation licensed music from all the major record labels and issued hundreds of different tapes in the mid to late 1960s. Muntz exhibited his Autostereo players and Stereo-Pak cartridges under the trade name Stereo-Pak at the 1967 Consumer Electronics Show. Muntz Stereo-Pak ads tended to feature attractive young models and suggestive tag lines. The Autostereo player, which retailed from $129 in 1963 ($ in ) was a popular aftermarket addition to cars among the Beverly Hills rich and famous. Frank Sinatra used one in his Buick Riviera, Dean Martin in his Corvette, and Peter Lawford in his Ghia. James Garner, Red Skelton, and Lawrence Welk also used Autostereo players in their cars. Barry Goldwater purchased one for his son, and Jerry Lewis recorded his scripts onto Stereo-Pak cartridges to learn his lines while driving. Muntz attempted to establish a modern, trendy image for his players and cartridges. His print advertisements often showed the player installed in an appealing sports car and usually incorporated a young, attractive model with a suggestive tagline. Most of his employees in his California shops were attractive young women dressed in overbright clothing. Bill Lear distributed the Stereo-Pak in 1963, intending to install units in his Learjet aircraft. However, he soon decided to re-engineer and customize the units to suit his own wishes, the result of which became the Stereo 8 system. The market for Muntz's 4-track system had faded by 1970 due to competition from Stereo 8, which reduced costs by using less magnetic tape and a less-complex cartridge mechanism. Although the 4-track system had higher fidelity since the tape speed was double the speed of the Stereo 8 system (and the 4-track had wider heads for better bandwidth), the Stereo 8 quickly became the dominant format for car stereo systems during the late 1960s. Ford Motor Company began featuring Stereo 8 players in their 1965 automobiles, and it became a standard option by 1966. In a 1979 interview in The Videophile newsletter, Muntz revealed the biggest problem for the Stereo-Pak business was returned merchandise. He explained that when reproducing the work of major artists like The Beatles, the Stereo-Pak plant had to make hundreds of thousands of cartridges. But once a popular album became less popular, retailers would return the unsold cartridges, expecting credit towards new titles. Muntz was unprepared for the returns and said the huge cost of unsold merchandise eventually made his Stereo-Pak business unprofitable. =Home video= In late 1970, Muntz closed his Stereo-Pak audio business after a fire severely damaged his main offices. He then entered the growing home-video market. During the mid-1970s, Muntz thought of taking a Sony color cathode ray tube (CRT) television receiver, fitting it with a special lens and reflecting mirror, then projecting the magnified image onto a larger screen. He housed these primitive units in a large wooden console, making it one of the first successful widescreen projection TV receivers marketed for home use. The receivers were built in Muntz's headquarters in Van Nuys, California. Sony's U.S. sales division was unaware that Muntz was dealing directly with Sony's Tokyo original equipment manufacturer (OEM) department, which shipped him the TV chassis directly. Thanks to Muntz's talent for mass-market advertising and self-promotion, by 1977 the projection receivers were a multimillion-dollar business. Muntz was quick to feature Sony's Betamax as well as JVC's and RCA's VHS recorders in his store, setting up a showroom to demonstrate the potential for a \\"theater experience in the home\\". Later years In 1979, Muntz decided to sell blank tapes and VCRs as loss leaders to attract customers to his showroom, where he would then try to sell them his projection TV systems. His success as a home entertainment retailer continued through the early 1980s when he began offering cellular phones and home satellite dishes to customers. He made headlines in February 1985 as the first retailer to offer a Hitachi cellular phone for less than $1,000 ($ in ), when just two years earlier most cellular phones had cost about $3,000 ($ in ). At the time of his death from lung cancer in 1987, he was the leading retailer of cellular phones in Los Angeles. During his final years, Muntz drove a customized Lincoln Continental with a television installed in the dashboard: Muntz claimed it helped him \\"drive better\\". After he died, his children, Jim and Teena, continued to operate two Muntz stores in Van Nuys and Newhall; the remainder of the stores were franchised businesses. Jim employed his father's advertising techniques to create splashy ads featuring prices that annoyed his competitors so much that they referred to them as \\"cutthroat\\". Legacy The \\"Madman\\" method pioneered by Muntz was later copied by other retailers, including California car salesman Cal Worthington and New York area electronics chain Crazy Eddie. In Crazy Eddie TV commercials, radio personality Jerry Carroll leapt at the camera and jumped around while jabbering at high speed, always ending with the line, \\"Crazy Eddie: Our prices are insaaaaaane!\\" As a result of his Crazy Eddie commercials, Carroll became a significant 80s icon, even appearing in the film Splash. Muntz's cultural impact was such that he was mentioned in novels, including children's book The Neddiad: How Neddie Took The Train, Went To Hollywood, And Saved Civilization by Daniel Manus Pinkwater, The Lost Get-Back Boogie by James Lee Burke, and Franklin Mason's Four Roses in Three Acts. A production called Madman Muntz: American Maverick was screened at film festivals through 2007. Directed by Dan Bunker and Judy ver Mehr, it was produced by Jim Castoro, an owner of an original Muntz Jet. The film was an official 2005 selection at the San Fernando Valley International Film Festival and the Ole Muddy Film Festival. The film documents Muntz's life, paying particular attention to his colorful career, and includes interviews with people who knew him and home movie footage contributed by his children. The KCET 1997 documentary More Things That Aren't Here Anymore has a segment on Muntz and is broadcast by the station regularly during pledge periods. In 2001, Madman Muntz was posthumously inducted into the Consumer Electronics Hall of Fame.

On the pedestal of the tablet are huge bas-reliefs depicting eight major revolutionary episodes, which can be read in chronological order in a clockwise direction from the east: # Destruction of opium at Humen (1839), in the run-up to the First Opium War # Jintian Uprising, the catalyst for the Taiping Revolution (1851) # Wuchang Uprising, the catalyst for the Xinhai Revolution (1911) # May 4th Movement (1919) # May 30 Movement (1925) # Nanchang Uprising (1927) # War of Resistance Against Japan (1931-1945) # Yangtze River Crossing Campaign of the Chinese Civil War (1949) On the front of the monument is an inscription in Mao Zedong's handwriting, which reads, \\"Eternal glory to the people's heroes!\\" (). 400x400px On the back of the monument is an epitaph, composed by Mao Zedong and written by Zhou Enlai: Commemoration The Monument to the People's Heroes with the Great Hall of the People in the background, illuminated at night The conduct of commemoration activities at the Monument to the People's Heroes is regulated by the Major Events Administration Office of the Tiananmen Area Administrative Committee. Strict rules apply to conduct within the vicinity of the monument. Since the protests of 1989 (during which the Monument was a rallying point for the protestors), the government has prohibited climbing the monument beyond the protective barrier without prior approval, as well as photography and filming. Today, those intending to lay wreaths at the monument must apply five days in advance.Major Events Administration Office of the Tiananmen Area Administrative Committee, \\"Matters to note when paying respects or laying wreaths at the Monument to the People's Heroes\\" Since 1980, it has been customary for visiting foreign dignitaries, especially from historical allies of the People's Republic of China, such as post-Soviet states, to lay wreaths at the monument when visiting Beijing. Certain domestic groups, such as police and military units, would also sometimes lay wreaths at the monument.

The Virginia Military District was an approximately 4.2 million acre (17,000 km¬≤) area of land in what is now the state of Ohio that was reserved by Virginia to use as payment in lieu of cash for its veterans of the American Revolutionary War. Virginia had historic claims to much of the Northwest Territory, which included Ohio, dating from its colonial charter. Virginia and the other states ceded their claims over western lands to overcome other states' objections to ratifying the Articles of Confederation. In return for ceding its claims in 1784, Virginia was granted this area to provide military bounty land grants. The Ohio district was a surplus reserve, in that military land grants were first made in an area southeast of the Ohio River, in what is now Kentucky. The Ohio land was to be used only after the land southeast of the river was exhausted. Location The land was located in southern Ohio, bordered by the Ohio River on the south, the Little Miami River on the west, and the Scioto River on the east and the north. The District encompassed all of the following Ohio counties: Adams, Brown, Clinton, Clermont, Highland, Fayette, Madison, and Union, and portions of these counties: Scioto, Pike, Ross, Pickaway, Franklin, Delaware, Marion, Hardin, Logan, Clark, Greene, Champaign. Warren, Hamilton, and Auglaize. Settlement Map of the Virginia Military District with modern counties shown. The District was opened for settlement in 1794, although surveys had begun in the 1780s. Surveys were done using the metes and bounds method used in Virginia, rather than the Public Land Survey System established by the Land Ordinance of 1785 used for most of the Northwest Territory. The precise boundaries of the district was a subject of contention for many years, involving multiple acts of Congress and a Supreme Court decision (Doddridge vs. Thompson et al., 9 Wheaton, 469). Further complicating the matter was the ambiguous location of the line established with the Treaty of Greenville, which separated Native American lands from lands open to white settlers and which ran through the northern portion of the District. Virginia issued bounty land grants in this District until Ohio became a state in 1803. However, rampant land speculation and outright frauds produced a contentious muddle in land titles for many years afterward. Congress extended the time allowed for claims to be made several times. The last extension act was passed on March 3, 1855, allowing two years for claims made prior to January 1, 1852 to be surveyed and patented. After two years, unsurveyed lands became property of the United States. On February 18, 1871, this unsurveyed and unsold land was ceded by the federal government to the state of Ohio. In 1872, the Ohio legislature gave this land to the Ohio Agricultural and Mechanical College (now the Ohio State University). The college trustees aggressively claimed lands where there was not clear title, sometimes uprooting families who had been farming the land for 75 years. This caused such an uproar that Congress was forced to act and on May 27, 1880, passed legislation limiting the rights of the college to unappropriated lands. Some provisions of this legislation opened the doors to a new round of legal wrangling. Massie's Station (now Manchester, Ohio), founded in 1791, was the first permanent settlement in the District, named after Nathaniel Massie, a surveyor and land speculator. He also founded Chillicothe, Ohio in 1796. Many Virginians who settled in the area never owned slaves, although numerous settlers freed or sold their slaves before departing for Ohio, due to the provisions of the Northwest Ordinance of 1787. Process of claiming land Virginia soldiers of the Continental line, who served in the Revolutionary War, were eligible to procure a bounty award in the form of land, according to a formula based on rank and time of service. The first step was to secure a proper certificate of service and then to acquire a printed warrant from the land office in Virginia specifying the quantity of land. This warrant empowered the person to whom it was given, or heirs and assignees, to select the specified area from anywhere within the military reserve district. After the location was chosen and boundaries surveyed, the owner of the warrant exchanged it for a patent, which was equivalent to a deed in fee simple and passed all title of the government to the holder. The land was never divided into regular townships, as in the Public Lands Survey System. Instead, land was divided based on the Virginia custom of \\"metes and bounds.\\" Land boundaries were defined by natural features --trees, boulders, and bodies of water. This resulted in irregularly-shaped land claims, as claimants vied to get the best land. As a result there were frequently competing and overlapping claims.

It is used for legislative and ceremonial activities by the government of the People's Republic of China (PRC) and the ruling Communist Party of China. The People's Great Hall functions as the meeting place for the full sessions of the National People's Congress (NPC), the Chinese legislature, which occurs every year during March along with the national session of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), a political advisory body. It is also the meeting place of the National Congress of the Communist Party of China, which, since 1982, has occurred once every five years and the party's Central Committee which meets approximately once a year. The Hall is also used for many special events, including national level meetings of various social and political organisations, large anniversary celebrations, as well as the memorial services for former leaders. The Great Hall of the People is also a popular attraction in the city frequented by tourists visiting the capital. History The Great Hall of the People was opened in September 1959 as one of the \\"Ten Great Constructions\\" completed for the 10th Anniversary of the PRC. After design proposals were submitted a group of architects from across the country chose the winning design by Zhao Dongri and Shen Qi. Zhang Bo was appointed as the chief architect. The construction took 10 months, 7,785 workers and was fashioned with military-like strategies that emulated the Great Leap Forward. Description Designed to symbolize the national unity and ethnic equality of the nation, the Great Hall embodied the new Chinese character of time in its features, proportion and details. The building covers 171,801 square metres (1,849,239 sq ft) of floor space, it is 356 metres in length and 206.5 metres in width. The centre's highest point reaches 46.5 metres. At the eaves of the main gate hangs the national emblem of the PRC. The Great Hall of the People consists of three sections. #The central section principally includes the Great Auditorium, the Main Auditorium, the Congress Hall (Standing Committee of SCPCC meets in conference), the Central Hall, the Golden Hall and other main halls. #The northern section consists of the State Banquet Hall, the Salute State Guest Hall, the North Hall, the East Hall, the West Hall and other large halls. #The southern part is the office building of the Standing Committee of the People's Congress of China. Each province, special administrative region, autonomous region of China has its own hall in the Great Hall, such as Beijing Hall, Hong Kong Hall and Hainan Hall. Each hall has the unique characteristics of the province and is furnished according to the local style.Julia F. Andrews. Painters and Politics in the People's Republic of China, 1949-1979. University of California Press. 1995. Upon its completion, the Great Hall became China's largest auditorium which had previously been the Sun Yat-sen Auditorium. The Great Auditorium, with volume of 90,000 cubic metres, seats 3,693 in the lower auditorium, 3,515 in the balcony, 2,518 in the gallery and 300 to 500 on the dais. Government leaders make their speeches; and the representatives do much of their business. It can simultaneously seat 10,000 representatives. The ceiling is decorated with a galaxy of lights, with a large red star is at the centre of the ceiling, and a pattern of a water waves nearby represents the people. Its facilities equipped with audio-visual and other systems adaptable to a variety of meeting types and sizes. A simultaneous interpretation system is also provided with a language booth. The State Banquet Hall with an area of 7,000 square meters can entertain 7,000 guests, and up to 5,000 people can dine at one time (as was done on the occasion of Richard Nixon's 1972 visit to China). Smaller gatherings can be held in the Main Auditorium, with larger groups having the use of one or more of the conference halls, such as Golden Hall and North Hall, and the smallest assemblies accommodated in one or more of the over 30 conference halls that are named after provinces and regions in China. Usage Fa√ßade of the Great Hall of the People at night. The Great Hall of the People is the political hub of Beijing and home of the National People's Congress. Every year, in March, the Great Hall of the People plays host to the liang hui (literally means \\"two meetings\\") event, where both the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) and the National People's Congress (NPC) meet in sessions lasting for two to three weeks at the Great Auditorium. The Communist Party of China (CPC) also holds its National Congress every five years in the Great Hall of the People. The Great Hall has been used for meetings with foreign dignitaries on state or working visits, as well as large anniversary celebrations attended by top leaders. Ceiling of The Auditorium of Ten Thousand People. The Central Military Band of the People's Liberation Army of China at the Great Hall of the People. The band plays an important role in the ceremonial protocol that occurs in the hall. The Great Hall has been used for the state funerals and memorial services for several top leaders. Former President Liu Shaoqi was purged during the Cultural Revolution and died in the ensuing struggles. He was posthumously rehabilitated after 1978. In 1982 Liu was granted a state funeral held at the Great Hall. The Great Hall also held the funerals of General Secretary Hu Yaobang in 1989 during the Tiananmen Square protests, as well as the memorial service for paramount leader Deng Xiaoping in 1997. Mao Zedong's funeral ceremony was not held at the Great Hall; it was held at Tiananmen Square. The building and its main \\"Great Auditorium\\" is open to the public as a tourist attraction when it is not in use. Some non-political conventions and concerts have also been held in the Great Hall. In October 2003, Riverdance, the Irish music and dance entertainment phenomenon, was the first show from the West to perform in the Great Hall of the People, Beijing, with eleven sold-out performances. The Riverdance performances recorded a spontaneous reaction with standing ovations at each show which was uncharacteristic for a Chinese audience. Riverdance was officially invited to perform in the Great Hall of the People by former premier of the People's Republic of China, Zhu Rongji during his state visit to Ireland in September 2001. In January 2009, American country music trio Lucy Angel became the first American group to be invited to perform at the Great Hall of the People, doing so before an audience of dignitaries and government officials.

The skin is from a patient with Henoch‚ÄìSch√∂nlein purpura: IgA deposits are found in the walls of small superficial capillaries (yellow arrows). The pale wavy green area on top is the epidermis, the bottom fibrous area is the dermis. These figures demonstrates the basic mechanism of immunofluorescence. Primary immunofluorescence is depicted on the left, which shows an antibody with a fluorophore group bound to it directly binding to the epitope of the antigen for which it is specific. Once the antibody binds to the epitope, the sample can be viewed under fluorescent microscope to confirm the presence of the antigen in the sample. Conversely, secondary immunofluorescence is depicted to the right, which shows that first an untagged primary antibody binds to the epitope of the antigen in a mechanism similar to the one described above. However, after the primary antibodies have bound to their target, a secondary antibody (tagged with a fluorophore) comes along. This secondary antibody's binding sites are specific for the primary antibody that's already bound to the antigen, and therefore the secondary antibody binds to the primary antibody. This method allows for more fluorophore-tagged antibodies to attach to their target, thus increasing the fluorescent signal during microscopy. Immunofluorescence is a technique used for light microscopy with a fluorescence microscope and is used primarily on microbiological samples. This technique uses the specificity of antibodies to their antigen to target fluorescent dyes to specific biomolecule targets within a cell, and therefore allows visualization of the distribution of the target molecule through the sample. The specific region an antibody recognizes on an antigen is called an epitope. There have been efforts in epitope mapping since many antibodies can bind the same epitope and levels of binding between antibodies that recognize the same epitope can vary. Additionally, the binding of the fluorophore to the antibody itself cannot interfere with the immunological specificity of the antibody or the binding capacity of its antigen. Immunofluorescence is a widely used example of immunostaining (using antibodies to stain proteins) and is a specific example of immunohistochemistry (the use of the antibody-antigen relationship in tissues). This technique primarily makes use of fluorophores to visualise the location of the antibodies. Immunofluorescence can be used on tissue sections, cultured cell lines, or individual cells, and may be used to analyze the distribution of proteins, glycans, and small biological and non-biological molecules. This technique can even be used to visualize structures such as intermediate-sized filaments. If the topology of a cell membrane has yet to be determined, epitope insertion into proteins can be used in conjunction with immunofluorescence to determine structures. Immunofluorescence can also be used as a \\"semi-quantitative\\" method to gain insight into the levels and localization patterns of DNA methylation since it is a more time-consuming method than true quantitative methods and there is some subjectivity in the analysis of the levels of methylation. Immunofluorescence can be used in combination with other, non-antibody methods of fluorescent staining, for example, use of DAPI to label DNA. Several microscope designs can be used for analysis of immunofluorescence samples; the simplest is the epifluorescence microscope, and the confocal microscope is also widely used. Various super- resolution microscope designs that are capable of much higher resolution can also be used. Types histological section of human skin prepared for direct immunofluorescence using an anti-IgG antibody. The skin is from a patient with systemic lupus erythematosus and shows IgG deposit at two different places: The first is a band-like deposit along the epidermal basement membrane (\\"lupus band test\\" is positive). The second is within the nuclei of the epidermal cells (anti-nuclear antibodies). = Preparation of fluorescence = To make fluorochrome-labeled antibodies, a fluorochrome must be conjugated (\\"tagged\\") to the antibody. Likewise, an antigen can also be conjugated to the antibody with a fluorescent probe in a technique called fluorescent antigen technique. Staining procedures can apply to both fixed antigen in the cytoplasm or to cell surface antigens on living cells, called \\"membrane immunofluorescence\\". It is also possible to label the complement of the antibody-antigen complex with a fluorescent probe. In addition to the element to which fluorescence probes are attached, there are two general classes of immunofluorescence techniques: primary and secondary. The following descriptions will focus primarily on these classes in terms of conjugated antibodies. There are two classes of immunofluorescence techniques, primary (or direct) and secondary (or indirect). =Primary (direct)= Primary (direct) immunofluorescence uses a single, primary antibody, chemically linked to a fluorophore. The primary antibody recognizes the target molecule (antigen) and binds to a specific region called the epitope. This is accomplished by a process which manipulates the immune response of organism with adaptive immunity. The attached fluorophore can be detected via fluorescent microscopy, which, depending on the messenger used, will emit a specific wavelength of light once excited. Direct immunofluorescence, although somewhat less common, has notable advantages over the secondary (indirect) procedure. The direct attachment of the messenger to the antibody reduces the number of steps in the procedure, saving time and reducing non-specific background signal. This also limits the possibility of antibody cross-reactivity and possible mistakes throughout the process. However, some disadvantages do exist in this method. Since the number of fluorescent molecules that can be bound to the primary antibody is limited, direct immunofluorescence is substantially less sensitive than indirect immunofluorescence and may result in false negatives. Direct immunofluorescence also requires the use of much more primary antibody, which is extremely expensive, sometimes running up to $400.00/mL. =Secondary (indirect)= A fluorescent stain for actin in the smooth muscle of the skin. Secondary (indirect) immunofluorescence uses two antibodies; the unlabeled first (primary) antibody specifically binds the target molecule, and the secondary antibody, which carries the fluorophore, recognizes the primary antibody and binds to it. Multiple secondary antibodies can bind a single primary antibody. This provides signal amplification by increasing the number of fluorophore molecules per antigen. This protocol is more complex and time- consuming than the primary (or direct) protocol above, but allows more flexibility because a variety of different secondary antibodies and detection techniques can be used for a given primary antibody. This protocol is possible because an antibody consists of two parts, a variable region (which recognizes the antigen) and constant region (which makes up the structure of the antibody molecule). It is important to realize that this division is artificial and in reality the antibody molecule is four polypeptide chains: two heavy chains and two light chains. A researcher can generate several primary antibodies that recognize various antigens (have different variable regions), but all share the same constant region. All these antibodies may therefore be recognized by a single secondary antibody. This saves the cost of modifying the primary antibodies to directly carry a fluorophore. Different primary antibodies with different constant regions are typically generated by raising the antibody in different species. For example, a researcher might create primary antibodies in a goat that recognize several antigens, and then employ dye-coupled rabbit secondary antibodies that recognize the goat antibody constant region (\\"rabbit anti-goat\\" antibodies). The researcher may then create a second set of primary antibodies in a mouse that could be recognized by a separate \\"donkey anti- mouse\\" secondary antibody. This allows re-use of the difficult-to-make dye- coupled antibodies in multiple experiments. Limitations As with most fluorescence techniques, a significant problem with immunofluorescence is photobleaching. Loss of activity caused by photobleaching can be controlled by reducing or limiting the intensity or time-span of light exposure, by increasing the concentration of fluorophores, or by employing more robust fluorophores that are less prone to bleaching (e.g., Alexa Fluors, Seta Fluors, or DyLight Fluors). Some problems that may arise from this technique include autofluorescence, extraneous undesired specific fluorescence, and nonspecific fluorescence. Autofluorescence includes fluorescence emitted from the sample tissue or cell itself. Extraneous undesired specific fluorescence occurs when a targeted antigen is impure and contains antigenic contaminants. Nonspecific fluorescence involves the loss of a probe's specificity due to fluorophore, from improper fixation, or from a dried out specimen. Immunofluorescence is only limited to fixed (i.e., dead) cells when structures within the cell are to be visualized because antibodies do not penetrate the cell membrane when reacting with fluorescent labels. Antigenic material must be fixed firmly on the site of its natural localization inside the cell. Intact antibodies can also be too large to dye cancer cells in vivo. Their size results in slow tumor penetration and long circulating half-life. Research has been done investigating the use of diabodies to get around this limitation. Proteins in the supernatant or on the outside of the cell membrane can be bound by the antibodies; this allows for living cells to be stained. Depending on the fixative that is being used, proteins of interest might become cross-linked and this could result in either false positive or false negative signals due to non-specific binding. An alternative approach is using recombinant proteins containing fluorescent protein domains, e.g., green fluorescent protein (GFP). Use of such \\"tagged\\" proteins allows determination of their localization in live cells. Even though this seems to be an elegant alternative to immunofluorescence, the cells have to be transfected or transduced with the GFP-tag, and as a consequence they become at least S1 or above organisms that require stricter security standards in a laboratory. This technique involves altering the genetic information of cells.  Advances  Many improvements to this method lie in the improvement of fluorescent microscopes and fluorophores. Super-resolution methods generally refer to a microscope's ability to produce resolution below the Abbe limit (a limit placed on light due to its wavelength). This diffraction limit is about 200-300 nm in the lateral direction and 500-700 nm in the axial direction. This limit is comparable or larger than some structures in the cell, and consequently, this limit prevented scientists from determining details in their structure. Super-resolution in fluorescence, more specifically, refers to the ability of a microscope to prevent the simultaneous fluorescence of adjacent spectrally identical fluorophores. This process effectively sharpens the point-spread function of the microscope. Examples of recently developed super-resolution fluorescent microscope methods include stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscopy, saturated structured-illumination microscopy (SSIM), fluorescence photoactivation localization microscopy (FPALM), and stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (STORM).

From 1923 to 1931 he was Poet Laureate of Oregon. Life Edwin Markham was born in Oregon City, Oregon, and was the youngest of 10 children; his parents divorced shortly after his birth. At the age of four, he moved to Lagoon Valley, a at Christian College in Santa Rosa. He went by \\"Charles\\" until about 1895, when he was about 43, when he started using \\"Edwin.\\"Biographical History from the Edwin Markham Collection Finding Aid at San Jose State University In 1898, Markham married his third wife, Anna Catherine Murphy (1859‚Äì1938), and in 1899 their son Virgil Markham was born. They moved to Rio de Janeiro in 1900 to study natives and their appeasement, then to New York City, where they lived in Brooklyn and then Staten Island. Edwin Markham had, by the time of his death, amassed a huge library of 15000+ books. This collection was bequeathed to Wagner College's Horrmann Library, located on Staten Island. Markham also willed his personal papers to the library. Edwin's correspondents included Franklin D. Roosevelt, Ambrose Bierce, Aleister Crowley, Jack and Charmian London, Carl Sandburg, Florence Earle Coates and Amy Lowell. Career L'homme √† la houe by Jean-Fran√ßois Millet Markham taught literature in El Dorado County until 1879, when he became education superintendent of the county. While residing in El Dorado County, Markham became a member of Placerville Masonic Lodge. He also accepted a job as principal of Tompkins Observation School in Oakland, California, in 1890. While in Oakland, he became well acquainted with many other famous contemporary writers and poets, such as Joaquin Miller, Ina Coolbrith, Charles Warren Stoddard, and Edmund Clarence Stedman. Edwin Markham's most famous poem, \\"The Man with the Hoe,\\" which accented laborers' hardships, was first presented at a public poetry reading in 1898. His main inspiration was a French painting of the same name (in French, L'homme √† la houe) by Jean- Fran√ßois Millet. Markham's poem was published, and it became quite popular very soon. In New York, he gave many lectures to labor groups. These happened as often as his poetry readings. A photograph of Markham in his later years In 1922, Markham's poem \\"Lincoln, the Man of the People\\" was selected from 250 entries to be presented at the dedication of the Lincoln Memorial. The author himself read the poem. Dr. Henry Van Dyke of Princeton said of the poem, \\"Edwin Markham's Lincoln is the greatest poem ever written on the immortal martyr, and the greatest that ever will be written.\\" Later that year, Markham was filmed reciting the poem by Lee De Forest in his Phonofilm sound-on-film process. As recounted by literary biographer William R. Nash, \\"'['b]etween publications, Markham lectured and wrote in other genres, including essays and nonfiction prose. He also gave much of his time to organizations such as the Poetry Society of America, which he established in 1910. In 1922, at the conclusion to the dedication of the Lincoln Memorial, Markham read a revised version of his poem, \\"Lincoln the Man of the People.\\"The New York Times, May 30, 1922 Markham also wrote a number of epigrams, of which the best known is Outwitted. Throughout Markham's later life, many readers viewed him as an important voice in American poetry, a position signified by honors such as his election in 1908 to the National Institute of Arts and Letters. Despite his numerous accolades, however, none of his later books achieved the success of the first two. Legacy Six schools in California were named in honor of Markham. Three schools, all named Edwin Markham Elementary School, are in Oakland, Vacaville and Hayward, and three more are Markham Middle School in the Los Angeles neighborhood of Watts, Edwin Markham Middle School in Placerville, and Edwin Markham Junior High School in San Jose, the last since renamed Willow Glen Middle School. Schools in other states named in his honor include Edwin Markham Intermediate School 51 in Staten Island, Edwin Markham Elementary north of Pasco, Washington, Edwin Markham Elementary School in Mt. Lebanon, Pennsylvania, and Markham Elementary in Portland, Oregon. The Liberty Ship Edwin Markham was launched on May 5, 1942. A street in the Palomares Hills neighborhood of Castro Valley, CA bears his name (Edwin Markham Drive). The Markham Houses is a complex on Staten Island, as is a street there.

Life Aspdin (or Aspden) was the eldest of the six children of Thomas Aspdin, a bricklayer living in the Hunslet district of Leeds, Yorkshire. He was baptised on Christmas Day, 1778. He entered his father's trade, and married Mary Fotherby at Leeds Parish Church (the Parish Church of St Peter at Leeds) on 21 May 1811.Leeds Parish Church, Marriage register, Page No 208, for 21 May 1811 By 1817, he had set up in business on his own in central Leeds. He must have experimented with cement manufacture during the next few years, because on 21 October 1824 he was granted the British Patent BP 5022 entitled An Improvement in the Mode of Producing an Artificial Stone, in which he coined the term \\"Portland cement\\" by analogy with the Portland stone, an oolitic limestone that is quarried on the channel coast of England, on the Isle of Portland in Dorset. See below for the text of the patent. Almost immediately after this, in 1825, in partnership with a Leeds neighbour, William Beverley, he set up a production plant for this product in Kirkgate, Wakefield. Beverley stayed in Leeds, but Aspdin and his family moved to Wakefield (about nine miles away) at this point. He obtained a second patent, for a method of making lime, in 1825. The Kirkgate plant was closed in 1838 after compulsory purchase of the land by the Manchester and Leeds Railway Company, and the site was cleared. He moved his equipment to a second site nearby in Kirkgate. At this time his eldest son James was working as an accountant in Leeds, and his younger son, William, was running the plant. However, in 1841, Joseph went into partnership with James, and posted a notice that William had left, and that the company would not be responsible for his debts, stating \\"I think it right to give notice that my late agent, William Aspdin, is not now in my employment, and that he is not authorised to receive any money, nor contract any debts on my behalf or on behalf of the new firm.\\" In 1843, William established his own plant at Rotherhithe, near London. There he introduced a new and substantially stronger cement, using a modified recipe for cement-making, the first \\"modern\\" Portland cement. In 1844 Joseph retired, transferring his share of the business to James. James moved to a third site at Ings Road in 1848, and this plant continued in operation until 1900. Joseph Aspdin died on 20 March 1855, at home in Wakefield. Patent Patent nr.

And > also the Specification aforesaid was stamped according to the tenor of the > statute made for that purpose. > Inrolled the Eighteenth day of December, in the year of our Lord One > thousand eight hundred and twenty-four. Implications of the patent Aspdin called the product Portland cement because set mortar made from it resembled ‚Äúthe best Portland stone\\". Portland stone was the most prestigious building stone in use in England at the time. The patent clearly does not describe the product recognised as Portland cement today. The product was aimed at the market for stuccos and architectural pre- cast mouldings, for which a fast-setting, low-strength cement was required (see cement). It was fired at low temperature (below 1250 ¬∞C) and therefore contained no alite (C3S: , tricalcium silicate). The product belongs to the category of \\"artificial cements\\" that were developed to compete with Parker's Roman cement, and was similar to that developed much earlier by James Frost. The process described is a \\"double burning\\" process in which the limestone is burned on its own first, then slaked, mixed with clay, and burned again. This was a common practice for manufacturers of both Artificial and Portland cements when only hard limestones were available. The grinding technology of the time consisted only of flat millstones, and it was more economic to comminute the limestone by burning and slaking than by grinding. The limestone he used was the Pennines Carboniferous limestone of the area, which was used for paving in the towns and on the turnpike roads. The characteristic practise of the patent (and of his lime patent) is the use of \\"road sweepings\\" as a raw material. He says that if the sweepings are not available he obtains 'the limestone itself\\". It is significant that Joseph Aspdin was twice prosecuted for digging up whole paving blocks from the local roads. Limestone supply was clearly a major headache for Aspdin in the days before stone could be brought in by rail. His son William's innovation was to make a mix with a higher limestone content, to burn it at a higher temperature using more fuel, and to grind the hitherto-discarded hard clinkered material, hence increasing wear- and-tear in the grinding process. However, William did not file for a patent on his modified process, and sometimes claimed his father's patent. In 1848, William moved south to Northfleet, in Kent, where inexhaustible supplies of soft chalk were available. A history of \\"financial missteps\\" and questionable business arrangements suggests that William may have been both inept and dishonest. Nonetheless, he is credited with launching the \\"modern\\" Portland cement industry.

Founded in 1900 as the Montana State School of Mines, the university became affiliated with the University of Montana in 1994. After undergoing several names changes, in 2017 the Montana University System Board of Regents voted to designate Montana Tech as a Special Focus Four-Year Universities, the only such designation in the Montana University System. To recognize this new designation and the greater independence with it, the name of was officially changed in 2018 from Montana Tech of the University of Montana to Montana Technological University. Montana Tech's focus is on engineering, applied and health science. In fall 2017, Montana Tech had nearly 2,700 students, 13 campus buildings and offers 45 undergraduate degrees along with 15 minors, 11 certification degrees, and 10 pre-professional career programs. Montana Tech also offers 21 graduate degrees and has Ph.D. programs in Materials Science and Engineering and Earth Science and Engineering. History The Enabling Act of 1889 which brought Montana into the Union, allotted land for the creation of a school of mines as one of the four original Montana University System universities. In 1893 the Montana Legislature provided funding to establish the school in Butte. The cornerstone of Main Hall was laid in 1896, and the university opened its doors in 1900 as the Montana State School of Mines. The first student was a woman, Clara Clark of Butte, and Nathan R. Leonard acted as the first president. Despite enthusiastic local support, even offers of free land for construction, the early history of the school was fraught with poor funding and accusations of fraud, but with the help of former governor John E. Rickards, the school was opened. In 1919 the Montana Legislature established the Montana State Bureau of Mines and Metallurgy on the campus in keeping with Montana Tech as a school focusing on the development of minerals and industry. Charles H. Clapp of the mining department served as the first president of the Bureau. The school was renamed the Montana College of Mineral Science and Technology in 1965. The school begins moving beyond purely engineering and applied sciences, adding social science and liberal arts options. Alumni Coliseum opens on campus. The university became affiliated with the University of Montana in 1994 with a reorganization of the Montana University System. The name was changed to Montana Tech of the University of Montana. The Butte Vocational-Technical Center was put under Montana Tech administration as the College of Technology. In 1998 Frank Gilmore becomes chancellor. In 2010 the Natural Resource Building (NRB) opened which now accommodates the Bureau of Mines and the Petroleum Engineering Department. In 2011 Don Blackketter becomes chancellor. In 2012 the College of Technology becomes Highlands College, and Frank and Ann Gilmore University Relations Center (URC) building is opened on campus. The first Ph.D. program in Materials Science and Engineering began in 2014 in partnership with University of Montana and Montana State University. The Nursing Department began offering a full bachelor's degree in 2015. In 2016 a full Bachelor's of Mechanical Engineering program was added, and the Natural Resource Research Center opens on campus including a new nano research lab, and additional lab space for existing departments. In 2017 the Montana Board of Regents designated Montana Tech as a Special Focus Four-Year Universities, the only such designation in the Montana University System, in recognition of Tech's focus on engineering, applied science and health science. This change gives greater independence by reporting directly to the Board of Regents and handling its own finances instead of through the University of Montana. To recognize this, in the summer of 2018, the school's name was changed to Montana Technological University. Les Cook becomes chancellor in 2019. = Presidents (1900-1994) and Chancellors (1994-Present) = # Nathan R. Leonard, 1900 - 1909 # Charles H. Bowman, 1909 - 1919 # Charles H.

The area is a remnant of the Pleistocene Lake Bonneville and is the largest of many salt flats located west of the Great Salt Lake. The property is public land managed by the Bureau of Land Management and is known for land speed records at the \\"Bonneville Speedway\\". Access to the flats is open to the public. History Bonneville Salt Flats during the winter has about 1 inch of water on it Geologist Grove Karl Gilbert named the area after Benjamin Bonneville, a U.S. Army officer who explored the Intermountain West in the 1830s. In 1907 Bill Rishel and two local businessmen tested the suitability of the salt for driving on by taking a Pierce-Arrow onto the surface of the flats. A railway line across the Bonneville Salt Flats was completed in 1910, marking the first permanent crossing. The first land speed record was set there in 1914 by Teddy Tetzlaff. Entertainment filmed at the salt flats include portions of Knight Rider, Warlock, Independence Day (1996) and its sequel, SLC Punk, Cremaster 2 from Cremaster Cycle, The Brown Bunny, The World's Fastest Indian, Gerry, The Tree of Life, Top Gear, and Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End. Furthermore, the Pontiac Bonneville (former flagship sedan of the Pontiac motor division), the Triumph Bonneville motorcycle, and the Bonneville International media company are all named for the salt flats. The Bonneville Salt Flats hosts the annual US Flight Archery Championships. The goal of flight archery is to shoot arrows from bows at the greatest distance possible without regard to hitting a target, and so the vast flat plane of the flats serves as an ideal location to measure the linear distance traveled by arrows without geographic interference. Both the 1977 (archer Don Brown) and 1982 (archer Alan Webster) world records were set at the Bonneville Salt Flats, while the current world record, achieved in 1987 (archer Don Brown), was set at the salt flats near Smith Creek, Nevada. Environmental concerns Campers at the Bonneville Salt Flats The thickness of salt crust is a critical factor in racing use of the salt flats. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) has undertaken multiple studies on the topic; while a 2007 study determined that there was little change in the salt crust thickness from 1988 to 2003, more recent studies have shown a reduction in thickness, especially in the northwest area where racing occurs. Overall area of the salt flats has reduced significantly over the past several decades. The cause or causes of this remain unclear, but many believe adjacent evaporative potash mining is the primary factor. Collaboration between racing organizations, the potash mine, and the BLM lead to a pilot program begun in 1998 to release excess brine onto the salt flats during winter. Plans to increase the volume of brine returned to the salt flats are hoped to halt loss of crust thickness, or possibly restore it in places where it has become too thin to sustain human use. Land speed events Michael Sturtz setting world motorcycle land speed record using 100% biodiesel, 2007 Motorcar racing has taken place at the salt flats since 1914. Racing takes place at part of the Bonneville Salt Flats known as the Bonneville Speedway. There are five major land speed events that take place at the Bonneville Salt Flats. Bonneville \\"Speed Week\\" takes place mid-August followed by \\"World of Speed\\" in September and the \\"World Finals\\" take place early October. These three events welcome cars, trucks, and motorcycles. The \\"Bub Motorcycle Speed Trials\\" are for motorcycles only. World records are contested at the Mike Cook ShootOut in September. The Southern California Timing Association and the Utah Salt Flats Racing Association organizes and plans the multi-vehicle events, but all event promoters contribute to prepping and maintaining the salt. \\"Speed Week\\" events in August were canceled for the second year in a row in 2015, due to poor conditions of the salt in certain parts of the flats. The salt flats had been swamped by heavy rains earlier in the year, which usually happens, but the rains also triggered mudslides from surrounding mountains and onto a section of the flats used for the land-speed racing courses. Stardust In 2004, the Stardust spacecraft released its sample-return capsule for a landing in the Bonneville Salt Flats after its flybys of asteroid 5535 Annefrank in 2002 and comet Wild 2 in 2004.

He patented the reflective road stud or \\"cat's eye\\" in 1934, and set up a company to manufacture his invention in 1935. An early poster and catalogue image Biography Percy Shaw was born in Halifax in the West Riding of Yorkshire, the fourth child and second son of James Shaw, a dyehouse labourer who worked at a local mill, and his second wife Esther Hannah Morrell. Shaw's father also had seven children by his first wife, Jane Brearley, who died in 1883. In 1892, his parents moved their large family to Boothtown in Halifax, where Shaw lived for the rest of his life. Shaw was educated at Boothtown Board School, and started work as a labourer in a cloth mill at the age of 13. He became apprenticed to a wire drawer, but the low wages on offer were not attractive and he soon took a series of unskilled jobs in local engineering works. He was thus well placed to join his father in a new business repairing small machine tools used in munitions production during the First World War. After his father's death in 1929, he started his own small business as a road contractor, repairing roads until his death in the 1970s. He received an OBE in 1965. Invention The reflective spheres shown set into a cat's eye in the United Kingdom. Shaw was inventive, even at an early age, but his most famous invention was the cat's eye for lighting the way along roads in the dark. There are several stories about how he came up with the idea. The most famous involves him driving down the difficult road (Queensbury Road, part of the A647 with a very steep drop to one side) from the Old Dolphin public house in Clayton Heights to his home in Halifax, when a cat on a fence along the edge of the road looked at the car, reflected his headlights back to him, allowing him to take corrective action and remain on the road. In an interview with Alan Whicker, however, he told a different story of being inspired on a foggy night to think of a way of moving the reflective studs on a road sign to the road surface. Further, local school children who were taken on visits to the factory in the late 1970s were told that the idea came from Shaw seeing light reflected from his car headlamps by tram tracks in the road on a foggy night. The tram tracks were polished by the passing of trams and by following the advancing reflection, it was possible to maintain the correct position in the road. In 1934, he patented his invention (patents Nos. 436,290 and 457,536), based on the 1927 reflecting lens patent of Richard Hollins Murray. A year later, Reflecting Roadstuds Ltd was formed to manufacture the devices. Sales were initially slow, but approval from the Ministry of Transport and the blackout in the Second World War gave a huge boost to production and the firm, located near Shaw's home in Boothtown, grew in size making more than a million roadstuds a year, which were exported all over the world. A later patent added a rainwater reservoir to the rubber shoe, which could be used to wash the glass \\"eyes\\" when a car drove over the stud. Such a success was the invention of the \\"cat's eye\\" that he was rewarded with an OBE for services to exports in the birthday honours list in 1965. He became eccentric in later life, removing the carpets, curtains and much of the furniture from his isolated home, and keeping four televisions running constantly (respectively tuned to BBC1, BBC2 and ITV, all with the sound turned down) with a fourth showing BBC2 in colour. On each Friday a few friends would come to the house and Percy would supply crates of bottled ale and boxes of potato crisps. He told Alan Whicker that the reason for keeping the TVs on simultaneously was so that his friends could watch whichever of the then existing channels they chose to, and there would be no arguments. One luxury was his Rolls-Royce Phantom. He never married and he died from cancer and heart disease at Boothtown Mansion, Halifax, where he had lived for all but two of his 86 years. Despite rumours of a personal fortune, his personal estate was admitted to probate in December 1976 at a value of ¬£193,500. He was an agnostic, but his funeral was held at Boothtown Methodist Church, and he was cremated in Elland. In 2005, he was listed as one of the 50 greatest Yorkshire people in a book by Bernard Ingham. Commemoration A pub in Broad Street, Halifax, is named for Shaw. A blue plaque was erected by the Halifax Civic Trust. References * John A.

Abdiel is mentioned a single time in the Bible, in 1 Chronicles 5:15: People Notable people with the name include: * Abdiel Arroyo (born 1993), Panamanian footballer * Abdiel Colberg (born 1957), Puerto Rican film director and television producer * Abdiel Crossman (1804‚Äì1859), mayor of New Orleans, Louisiana, from 1846‚Äì1854 * Abdiel Vazquez (born 1984), Mexican pianist * Abdiel Villa (born 1983), Mexican footballer Fictional characters =Paradise Lost= Chief among fictional characters bearing the name Abdiel is the seraph Abdiel appearing in Milton's Paradise Lost (1667), specifically in Book V and Book VI. Two passages from Book V serve to establish Abdiel's character: Abdiel denounces Satan after hearing him incite revolt among the angels, and abandons Lucifer to bring the news of his defection to God. However, when he arrives, he finds that preparations are already underway for battle. In the ensuing fight, Abdiel smites Satan, Ariel, Ramiel, and Arioch, presumably among others. In Asimov's Annotated Paradise Lost, Isaac Asimov theorized that Abdiel was in fact a representation of Milton himself. Likewise, in Cyder, Ambrose Philips refers to Milton as \\"that other bard\\" and contrasts Milton to his character Abdiel. In the film Paradise Lost, which was to be released in 2012, Abdiel was set to be played by Djimon Hounsou. However, pre-production of the project was ceased not long after, citing budgetary concerns of the production company. =Other uses= The character name Abdiel has also been used: * by Madeleine L'Engle in Many Waters as one among the seraphim * by Margaret Weis in the Star of the Guardians trilogy as a villain * by Anatole France in The Revolt of the Angels as the \\"angelic name\\" of the character Arcade, the guardian angel bent on causing the revolt that gives the novel its title * by Steven Brust in To Reign in Hell as the ambitious angel who catalyzes the dispute between Yaweh and Satan which would eventually result in the revolt in Heaven * by Kage Baker in The Graveyard Game as an immortal who maintains certain secret machinery References Category:Hebrew-language names Category:Individual angels ","title":"Abdiel"},{"id":"553683","text":"A drug holiday (sometimes also called a drug vacation, medication vacation, structured treatment interruption, tolerance break, treatment break or strategic treatment interruption) is when a patient stops taking a medication(s) for a period of time; anywhere from a few days to many months or even years if they feel it is in their best interests. Planned drug holidays are used in numerous fields of medicine. They are perhaps best known in HIV therapy, after a study showed that stopping medication may stimulate the immune system to attack the virus. As a treatment for HIV HIV selectively targets activated helper T-cells. Thus, over time, HIV will tend to selectively destroy those helper T-cells most capable of fighting the HIV infection off, effectively desensitizing the immune system to the infection. The purpose of a structured treatment interruption is to create a short interval in which the virus becomes common enough to stimulate reproduction of T-cells capable of fighting the virus. A 2006 HIV literature review noted that \\"two studies suggested that so-called drug holidays were of no benefit and might actually harm patients, while a third study suggested that the idea might still have value and should be revisited.\\" Other uses Another reason for drug holidays is to permit a drug to regain effectiveness after a period of continuous use, and to reduce the tolerance effect that may require increased dosages. In addition to drug holidays that are intended for therapeutic effect, they are sometimes used to reduce drug side effects so that patients may enjoy a more normal life for a period of time such as a weekend or holiday, or engage in a particular activity. For example, it is common for patients using SSRI anti-depressant therapies to take a drug holiday to reduce or avoid side effects associated with sexual dysfunction. In the treatment of mental illness, a drug holiday may be part of a progression toward treatment cessation. The holiday is also a tool to assess a drug's benefits against unwanted side effects, assuming that both will dissipate after an extended vacation.

She is known for humor in her writing which focuses on difficult cleaning problems and cleaning solutions which use everyday or inexpensive items like tea bags and Tang. She is also a featured guest on radio and television shows in the United States.  Biography  Cobb was raised in Grosse Pointe, Michigan. When she was young, she wanted to be a chemical engineer, but didn't feel there were many opportunities for women in that occupation. Cobb met her first husband, Bruce Dusette, in 1967. They later moved to Marysville and in 1981, her husband was diagnosed with leukemia and shortly after, Cobb gave birth to their stillborn baby. In 1982, she began to work at a large cleaning company, Moretz Cleaning. She also had a foster child, David, come to live with her in the same year. While she worked at the cleaning company, she learned many tricks and tips on how to clean almost anything. Many of the jobs her company specialized in included smoke and water damage. In 1991, she bought out the Moretz Cleaning company. In 1994, she married John Cobb and moved to Phoenix, Arizona, in 1995. Cobb felt that there was a gap in housecleaning information being passed from one generation to the next. At the suggestion of a friend, she began a newsletter focusing on cleaning tips which led to her appearances on Arizona television and radio. She began to make regular appearances on the television show, \\"Good Morning Arizona.\\" In her first appearance on \\"Good Morning Arizona\\" in 1997, she started her segment with the double entendre, \\"I'm the Queen of Clean and we're going to talk dirty today.\\" Her segment on the show led to a Phoenix publisher offering her a book deal. Cobb made national attention in the United States through the release of her first book, Talking Dirty With the Queen of Clean. This book was a bestseller in 2000 and two other books, Talking Dirty Laundry With the Queen of Clean and A Queen For All Seasons, were also on the New York Times Best Seller List. Talking Dirty also made the number one spot on the Publishers Weekly List during October, 2000. In 2002, she appeared on the Oprah Winfrey Show. Her editor, Brenda Copeland, says that Cobb's success is due to her personality which adds a twist of fun to the \\"drudgery\\" of cleaning.

Finer and more expensive straw hats have a tighter and more consistent weave. Since it takes much more time to weave a larger hat than a smaller one, larger hats are more expensive.  History  Straw hats have been worn in Europe and Asia since after the Middle Ages during the summer months, and have changed little between the medieval times and today. Many are to be seen in the famous calendar miniatures of the Tr√®s Riches Heures du Duc de Berry, worn by all classes, but mostly by men. Lesothoan license plate, featuring a mokorotlo The mokorotlo, a local design of a straw hat, is the national symbol of the Basotho and Lesotho peoples, and of the nation of Lesotho. It is also displayed on the license plates of that country. President Theodore Roosevelt helped popularize the straw Panama hat during his visit to the Panama Canal. Roosevelt used his natural ability to drum up publicity by posing for a series of photos at the Panama Canal construction site in 1906. Photos of his visit showed a strong, rugged leader dressed crisply in light-colored suits and stylish straw fedoras.

Although some housekeeping genes are expressed at relatively constant rates in most non-pathological situations, the expression of other housekeeping genes may vary depending on experimental conditions. The origin of the term \\"housekeeping gene\\" remains obscure. Literature from 1976 used the term to describe specifically tRNA and rRNA. For experimental purposes, the expression of one or multiple housekeeping genes is used as a reference point for the analysis of expression levels of other genes. The key criterion for the use of a housekeeping gene in this manner is that the chosen housekeeping gene is uniformly expressed with low variance under both control and experimental conditions. Validation of housekeeping genes should be performed before their use in gene expression experiments such as RT-PCR.  Housekeeping gene regulation  Housekeeping genes account for majority of the active genes in the genome, and their expression is obviously vital to survival. The housekeeping gene expression levels are fine-tuned to meet the metabolic requirements in various tissues. Biochemical studies on transcription initiation of the housekeeping gene promoters have been difficult, partly due to the less-characterized promoter motifs and transcription initiation process. Human housekeeping gene promoters are generally depleted of TATA-box, have high GC content and high incidence of CpG Islands . In Drosophila, where promoter specific CpG Islands are absent, housekeeping gene promoters contain DNA elements like DRE, E-box or DPE . Transcription start sites of housekeeping genes can span over a region of around 100 bp whereas transcription start sites of developmentally regulated genes are usually focused in a narrow region . Little is known about how the dispersed transcription initiation of housekeeping gene is established. There are transcription factors that are specifically enriched on and regulate housekeeping gene promoters . Furthermore, housekeeping promoters are regulated by housekeeping enhancers but not developmentally regulated enhancers .

Aireys Inlet is located between Anglesea and Lorne, and joined with Fairhaven to the west. Many surfers holiday in Aireys Inlet to take advantage of the popular Fairhaven beach. As the inclination of the beach can change dramatically between years, the surf is regarded as unpredictable. Swimmers should take note there is a strong rip current. Painkalac Creek, which separates Aireys Inlet from Fairhaven, forms a salt lake or inlet behind the sand dunes before it cuts through to the ocean. Due to low water levels in the inlet it is not often that the inlet breaks through. There is also a horseshoe-shaped reef at Step Beach which forms an excellent swimming hole at low tide. The towns main attraction, the Split Point Lighthouse overlooks the inlet. The lighthouse has made Aireys Inlet an icon along the Great Ocean Road. History In the early 19th century, before British settlement, the escaped convict William Buckley lived here in a primitive hut eating fish, shellfish, wild raspberries and sugar ants. Aireys Inlet was known to the Aboriginals of the time as Managwhawz. The town takes its current name from John Moore Cole Airey, who settled in the area in 1842.Kennedy, B: Australian Place Names, page 2. ABC Books, 2006 The Post Office opened on 1 April 1893. Population At the , Aireys Inlet had a population of 802. 83.4% of people were born in Australia and 88.3% of people only spoke English at home. The most common responses for religion were No Religion 53.9% and Catholic 16.1%.  Areas of Aireys Inlet  Fairhaven, Moggs Creek, and Eastern View are in the same postal area as Aireys Inlet.  School  Aireys Inlet has one school, Aireys Inlet Primary School (P-6), which until the end of 2016 was a campus of the then Lorne- Aireys Inlet P-12 College.  Sport  * Australian football: The Aireys Inlet Eels Football Club competes in the AFL Barwon junior competition. * Tennis: The Aireys Inlet and District Tennis Club competes in the Geelong Tennis Association. Literature and media Great Ocean Road During the early 1950s the Australian crime author Arthur Upfield lived at Aireys Inlet. His novel The New Shoe (1951) is based on the township and the lighthouse. Some of the novel's characters drew on local identities. Many scenes from the children's television series Round the Twist were filmed at or around the area of the Split Point Lighthouse. In 2005 the Bollywood movie Salaam Namaste was produced in Melbourne with many scenes being shot around Aireys Inlet, Fairhaven and Anglesea. Beaches and coastline Split Point Lighthouse While the coastline at adjacent Fairhaven is a long uninterrupted sand beach, the coast at Aireys Inlet is a series of rock shelves, interrupted by sandy swimming beaches, most of which are relatively secluded. Each beach has its own character, a result of differing lengths, orientation and nearby rock formations. Beaches include Sandy Gully, Steppy Beach and Sunnymeade. At low tide it is possible to walk (or scramble) around all these rocks and beaches, making it possible to walk along the beach, all the way from Eastern View - the historical start of the Great Ocean Road, all the way to Anglesea. 1983 Ash Wednesday bushfires Aireys Inlet was devastated by the infamous 1983 Ash Wednesday bushfires in which a large number of houses were burnt down. However, after a brief lull, interest in the area resumed and has been steadily climbing since. Properties, especially those with an ocean view, are becoming increasingly sought after, some going for greater than A$1 million.

Jiggery-Pokery, A Compendium of Double Dactyls (New York: Atheneum, 1967)  Form Like the limerick, the double dactyl has a fixed structure, is usually humorous, and is rigid in its prosodic structure. The double dactyl's prosodic requirements are more strenuous due to its increased length, and its specific requirements as to subject matter and word choice much more rigid, making it significantly more difficult to write. There must be two stanzas, each comprising three lines of dactylic dimeter ( ¬Ø Àò Àò ¬Ø Àò Àò ) followed by a line consisting of just a choriamb ( ¬Ø Àò Àò ¬Ø ). The last lines of these two stanzas must rhyme. Further, the first line of the first stanza is repetitive nonsense, and the second line of the first stanza is the subject of the poem, which in the purest instances of the form is a double-dactylic proper noun. (Hecht and other poets sometimes bent or ignored this rule, as in the Robison poem below.) There is also a requirement for at least one line, preferably the second line of the second stanza, to be entirely one double dactyl word. Some purists still follow Hecht and Pascal's original rule that no single six-syllable word, once used in a double dactyl, should ever be knowingly used again. An example by John Hollander: Higgledy piggledy, Benjamin Harrison, Twenty-third president Was, and, as such, Served between Clevelands and Save for this trivial Idiosyncrasy, Didn't do much. A self-referential example by Roger L. Robison: Long-short-short, long-short-short Dactyls in dimeter, Verse form with choriambs (Masculine rhyme): One sentence (two stanzas) Hexasyllabically Challenges poets who Don't have the time. The Dutch version, called ' after a children's verse, was introduced in the Dutch language by Drs. P. A similar verse form called a McWhirtle was invented in 1989 by American poet Bruce Newling. Another related form is the double amphibrach, similar to the McWhirtle but with stricter rules more closely resembling the double dactyl.  In literature  * The first published collection of double dactyls was Jiggery-Pokery: A Compendium of Double Dactyls, edited by Anthony Hecht and John Hollander. Many of the poems had previously appeared in Esquire starting in 1966. * John Bellairs' classic fantasy novel The Face in the Frost (1969) contains several double dactyls, used as nonsense magic spells. * The first published collection of double dactyls by a single author was Centicore Poems, [Series] I; being, A Non-canonical Collection of Entirely Prejudiced Double Dactyls \\"perpetrated by Jay Dillon\\" (Ann Arbor, Michigan: Dactylomaniac Press, 1972), OCLC (Worldcat) no. 498258515.

When he was an art student, Aoyama had a part-time job working at Tokyo Disneyland, where he painted backgrounds for Pirates of the Caribbean. Career Aoyama made his debut as a manga artist with Chotto Mattete, which was published in the magazine Weekly Sh≈çnen Sunday in winter of 1987. Shortly after that, he began Magic Kaito in the same magazine. Magic Kaito protagonist Kaito Kuroba later appeared in Case Closed. In the early 1990s, he began the series Yaiba, which ran for 24 volumes. Later, he would release other manga series in single volumes, such as Third Baseman No.4 and Gosho Aoyama's Collection of Short Stories. Aoyama began serializing Detective Conan in Weekly Sh≈çnen Sunday on January 19, 1994. When the series was first released in English, it was given the title Case Closed. Awards and recognition alt=Gosho Aoyama Manga Factory Aoyama has won two awards for his work as a manga artist. In 1992, he won the Shogakukan Manga Award for sh≈çnen for Yaiba. He would go on to win the same award for a second time in 2001, this time for Detective Conan. Additionally, his hometown Hokuei has undertaken several machi okoshi (town revitalization) projects in honor of his contribution as a manga artist and resident. The first projects were the Conan Bridge across the Yura River and Detective Conan statues. On March 18, 2007, the Gosho Aoyama Manga Factory, a museum that celebrates Aoyama's career as a manga artist, was opened. Personal life On May 5, 2005 Aoyama married Minami Takayama, the singer of Two-Mix and voice actress for Conan in the anime adaptation of Detective Conan. On December 10, 2007, the two divorced.

The Thief, Burglar, Scoundrel, Ninja, or Rogue is a character class found in many role-playing games, including Dungeons & Dragons, Final Fantasy, World of Warcraft and many MMORPGs. Thieves are usually stealthy and dexterous or speedy characters able to disarm traps, pick locks, spy on foes, avoid enemy detection and perform backstabs from hiding. Thieves are usually nimble melee or ranged combatants, and tend to be focused on dodging attacks rather than withstanding damage. They often attack by dual-wielding daggers or with other small one-handed and/or concealable weapons, relying on speed and rapid strikes rather than sheer damage output. Thieves usually work in small groups or guilds. Thieves usually have a stealth ability, allowing them to disappear from sight, often this is combined with attacking an unaware or flanked opponent to inflict high damage. Although thieves may be of any moral alignment (Good, Neutral, or Evil), they are usually either required or pressured by game design to maintain a Chaotic or at least non-Lawful (i.e., Chaotic or Neutral) ethical alignment, with game design pressures including the diminution or loss of their class-specific abilities should their actions render them Lawful or on the Lawful side of a certain point within the Neutral range. Thieves are usually restricted to the lighter armors that are easier to move in, leather and the like. While thieves typically cannot practice magic, they might use scrolls or magic items in some games; if neither options are available, then technical gadgets are used. In most fantasy settings, smaller and more agile fantasy races (like elves, gnomes and hobbits) are particularly suited for the thief class.  Dungeons & Dragons  Although the thief as an archetype in role-playing games achieved popularity through Dungeons & Dragons, ‚ÄúThief‚Äù in the Dungeons & Dragons game was renamed to ‚ÄúRogue‚Äù in the game's Third Edition, to broaden the class to any highly skilled character, with \\"Thief\\" as a subclass option in the current edition. Rogues in all editions are capable of doing much damage with ‚Äúsneak attacks‚Äù, especially from behind their enemies.  Fire Emblem  In the Fire Emblem games, the thief is the main class able to unlock doors and chests. Their weapon of choice is usually a sword, but in Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance and Fire Emblem: Radiant Dawn, they use knives. In addition to opening doors and chests, they may also steal items from enemy units or lower drawbridges, depending on the game. Thieves were not able to steal items until Fire Emblem: Genealogy of the Holy War, and were only limited to stealing all of the target's gold on hand by striking them. In Fire Emblem: Thracia 776, thieves were able to steal any item from the enemy, as long as their Speed was greater and their Build was higher than the Weight of the item stolen. Similarly, in Path of Radiance, thieves may steal weapons and items in the same manner as Thracia 776, but only items that are unequipped. Thieves were limited to only being able to steal normal items in the GBA Fire Emblem series. Thieves may promote to Thief Fighters, Assassins, Tricksters or Rogues, depending on the game, or not promote at all. They are generally offensively weaker than most other classes, but their high speed and skill helps them evade attacks with ease.  Ragnarok Online  In the Ragnarok Online MMORPG, the Thief is one of the basic character classes available to the player. In combat, Thieves rely primarily on their agility - they have moderate hit points and their attacks don't deal a lot of damage; however, thanks to their speed & agility, they are able to dodge most enemy attacks and deliver a lot of blows at the same time. While they are able to use some ranged weapons, this is rather rare; a typical Thief will be seen utilising some sort of dagger in combat, as one of the skills available only to this class greatly increases their efficiency with them. Other abilities of the Thief include stealing items from non-player enemies, becoming invisible for a certain time (although they cannot move while in such a state), throwing rocks and/or sand at enemies, performing a basic poison attack and curing themselves (or other players) of poison. The weapons a thief may equip are bow, one-handed sword, or dagger. A Thief who has acquired enough experience can become either an Assassin or a Rogue.  MapleStory  In MapleStory, thieves are one of five choices of characters. Like bowmen, they have ranged weapons, a requirement of luck and dexterity, an accuracy increasing skill, and a good balance of HP and MP. Like pirates, they have the option of a ranged weapon or melee weapon, as well as a moderate amount of HP and MP. Like the warrior they can both be equipped with daggers. And like the Magician, they rely greatly on MP, which is consumed quickly. Rather than stealing, thieves are more based on Ninjas since very few of their attacks are theft related. They are however able to do great amounts of damage rivaling and even surpassing that of Bowmen. This does not go so much for the Bandit choice who must go close up to enemies to attack. Assassins can be a powerful class, as long as they are able to be funded with the right equipment.  Guild Wars 2  A master of stealth and surprise, the Thief in Guild Wars 2 is deadly in single combat‚Äîparticularly when catching enemies off guard. Thieves compensate for their medium armor and low health by being quick and evasive. They can move through the shadows, vanish into thin air, or steal items from their opponents and use them as weapons.

ACMA was formed on 1 July 2005 with the merger of the Australian Broadcasting Authority and the Australian Communications Authority. ACMA is responsible for ensuring media and communications works for all Australians. It does this through various legislation, regulations, standards and codes of practice. ACMA is a converged regulator, created to oversee the convergence of telecommunications, broadcasting, radio communications and the internet. Organisation ACMA is an independent agency composed of a Chair, Deputy Chair, five Full-time Members (which includes the Chair and Deputy Chair), and three Associate Members. It is managed by an executive team comprising the Chair (who is also the Agency Head), Deputy Chair (who is also the Chief Executive Officer), four general managers and ten executive managers. The corporate structure comprises four divisions ‚Äì Communications Infrastructure, Content, Consumer and Citizen, Corporate and Research, and Legal Services. ACMA has responsibilities under four principal Acts ‚Äì the Broadcasting Services Act 1992, the Telecommunications Act 1997, the Telecommunications (Consumer Protection and Service Standards) Act 1999 and the Radiocommunications Act 1992. There are another 22 Acts to which the agency responds in such areas as spam, the Do Not Call Register and interactive gambling. The ACMA also creates and administers more than 523 legislative instruments including radiocommunications, spam and telecommunications regulations; and licence area plans for free-to-air broadcasters. ACMA collects revenue on behalf of the Australian Government through broadcasting, radiocommunications and telecommunications taxes, charges and licence fees. It also collects revenue from price-based allocation of spectrum. ACMA's main offices are located in Canberra, Melbourne and Sydney. Convergence and change Communications convergence is the merging of the previously distinct services by which information is communicated ‚Äì telephone, television (free-to-air and subscription) radio and newspapers ‚Äì over digital platforms. ACMA also works with industry and citizens to solve new concerns and mitigate risks arising in the evolving networked society and information economy, recognising that Australians are interacting with digital communications and content in changing ways. Not only does ACMA address a wide and disparate range of responsibilities, it does so against a backdrop of rapid and disruptive change. Many of the controls on the production and distribution of content and the provision of telecommunications services through licensing or other subsidiary arrangements, or by standards and codes (whether co-regulatory or self-regulatory) are subject to revision and adaptation to the networked society and information economy. Moreover, there are new platforms, applications, business models, value chains and forms of social interaction available with more to come in what is a dynamic, innovative environment. Other challenges for regulators include cross- jurisdictional issues and the need for engagement and collaboration with stakeholders locally, regionally and internationally. The ACMA's response to these pressures is to remain constantly relevant by delivering on its mandated outcomes and its statutory obligations, and by transforming itself into a resilient, e-facing, learning organisation, responsive to the numerous pressures for change that confront it. ACMA has developed a 'converged communications regulator' framework which seeks to bring to the global discussion a 'common ground' which can capture the fundamental tasks any regulator in a convergent environment will engage with to deliver outcomes in the public interest. The four cornerstone parts to the framework, each divided into two sub-streams, are outlined below along with the main functions of ACMA under each task. Bridging to the future ‚Äì active engagement with the currents of change and proactive development of responses through thought leadership and regulatory development: * reviewing industry standards and codes of practice * developing more flexible licensing * updating spectrum management tools for spectrum sharing technologies * research and analysis to examine the effectiveness of current regulation and to provide evidence-informed regulatory development Transforming the agency ‚Äì adapting the organisation to the changing world of convergence by ensuring a structural fit with convergence and a focus on agency innovation: * creating resilience through transformational capacity/capability training * evidence-based reporting on industry performance, service offerings, consumer benefits, levels of adoption and use * development and administration of spam intelligence database * developing and implementing an evidence-based approach to tracking industry performance during digital TV transition Major program delivery ‚Äì undertaking major development work or program implementation through resource and program management with fully effective corporate governance: * development and implementation of a national cybersafety education program * administering the Do Not Call Register * administering contracts for phone services for people who are deaf or have a hearing or speech impediment * developing and implementing a corporate governance framework and ICT strategic plan Effective regulation ‚Äì doing the 'day job' of the regulatory agency with effective and efficient regulatory administration and operations coupled with extensive stakeholder engagement: * regulating telecommunications and broadcasting services, internet content and datacasting services * managing access to the radiofrequency spectrum bands through radiocommunications licensing, including amateur radio licensing * resolving competing demands for spectrum through broadcasting licence arrangements and price-based allocation methods * regulating use of the radio-frequency spectrum and helping in minimising radio communications interference * regulating compliance with the relevant legislation, licence conditions, codes of practice, standards, service guarantees and other safeguards * promoting and facilitating industry self- regulatory and co-regulatory solutions * representing Australia's interests internationally (see International Telecommunications Union) * informing industry and consumers about communications regulation. The Convergence Review Committee set up by the Government in 2011 was independent of the ACMA and its final report in 2012 suggested the ACMA be replaced with a new regulator to implement a different approach to regulation. These changes were not enacted by the Labour Government and the new Coalition Government has not made major decisions on the future of the ACMA. The ACMA Hotline for reporting offensive or illegal online content The ACMA administers a complaints mechanism for Australian residents and law enforcement agencies to report prohibited online content, including child sexual abuse material. Within the scheme, which operates under Schedules 5 and 7 of the Broadcasting Services Act 1992, content is assessed with reference to the same criteria within the National Classification Scheme that applies to films and computer games in Australia. The ACMA Hotline is one of a global network of international bodies within INHOPE ‚Äì the International Association of Internet Hotlines that exchange information on child abuse images, pinpointing the hosting countries to help eradicate them from the web. INHOPE consists of 44 members in 38 countries, with members including the Internet Watch Foundation (UK), the National Centre for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC), Cybertip (Canada), Friendly Runet Foundation (Russian Federation) and the Internet Hotline Center Japan. If prohibited online content is found in Australia, it is issued with a take-down notice after being formally classified; if it is hosted overseas it is notified to optional end-user Family Friendly Filters that are accredited by industry through the Internet Industry Association (these are available at cost from ISPs). All potentially illegal content is reported by the ACMA to law enforcement in Australia, or, in the case of child sexual abuse material hosted overseas, through INHOPE for rapid police notification and take-down in the host country. The ACMA publishes comprehensive statistics and information about the ACMA Hotline on its website. The majority of investigations the ACMA conducts concern online child sexual abuse material. Complaints to the ACMA Hotline are usually made via a webform on the ACMA's website. Popularly held misconceptions about the ACMA's regulatory role include that it investigates and takes action on whole websites (it investigates specific URLs, images or files) and that the ACMA causes blocking of content at an ISP level (it notifies overseas hosted content to optional end-user filters). In February 2013, the ACMA and Australian Federal Police announced a new agreement for sharing of information about serious child abuse material, including an arrangement whereby the ACMA can report content through INHOPE based on where content may be produced, as well as where it is hosted During National Child Protection Week 2013, the ACMA Hotline conducted 418 investigations involving over 4,700 images of abused children to Australian police agencies or through the INHOPE international network for action overseas During the week, the ACMA announced it is now working more closely with CrimeStoppers in Australia to make it easier to report illegal online content. The ACMA's online role is not connected to ISP blocking 'worst of the worst' child abuse material, which was operated by ISPs and the Australian Federal Police. In July 2015, this function moved to the Office of the Children's eSafety Commissioner. Do Not Call Register ACMA operates Australia's Do Not Call Register, which is a scheme to reduce unsolicited telemarketing calls and marketing faxes to individuals who have indicated they do not want to receive such calls by registering their private and domestic telephone (including mobile) and fax numbers on the Register. The scheme has been in operation since May 2007. Since mid-2013, Salmat has managed the Register on behalf of ACMA. Spam Act ACMA is responsible for enforcing the Spam Act 2003Spam Act 2003 which prohibits the sending of unsolicited commercial electronic messagesunsolicited commercial electronic messages with an Australian link. A message has an Australian link if it originates, or was authorised, in Australia, or if the message was accessed in Australia. Anyone who sends commercial email, SMS, or instant messages must ensure that the message is sent with consent, contains sender identification and contact information and includes a functional unsubscribe facility. Some exemptions apply. Members of the public are able to make complaints and reports about commercial electronic messages to ACMA which may conduct formal investigations and take enforcement actions. The Australian Internet Security Initiative and malware The ACMA developed the Australian Internet Security Initiative (AISI) to help address the problem of computers being compromised by the surreptitious installation of malicious software. 'Malware' enables a computer to be controlled remotely for illegal and harmful activities without the owner's knowledge. Malware can: * access sensitive personal information stored on the computer such as resumes, sensitive documents, photographs/videos, and banking and other login or password details * gain remote access to the computer's camera and microphone * form part of a larger group of computers known as 'botnets'. Among other things, botnets are used to help with the mass distribution of spam and other malware, the hosting of phishing sites and distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks on websites. The AISI collects data from various sources on computers exhibiting 'bot' behaviour in the Australian internet space. Using this data, the ACMA provides daily reports to internet service providers (ISPs) identifying IP addresses on their networks that have generally been supplied to the ACMA in the previous 24-hour period. ISPs can then inform the customer associated with that IP address that their computer appears to be compromised and provide advice on how they can fix it. The ACMA does not know who the user of an IP address is, so the ISP is a critical link in the process of customer notification. In July 2017, this function moved to the Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT).  Telecommunications Sector Security Reform (TSSR)  The Telecommunications Sector Security Reform (TSSR) commenced on September 18, 2018. TSSR introduces four new measures: * a security obligation, which requires carriers and carriage service providers to protect their networks and facilities against threats to national security from unauthorized access or interference * a notification requirement, which requires carriers and nominated carriage service providers to tell Government of any proposed changes to their telecommunications systems or services that are likely to have a material adverse effect on their capacity to comply with their security obligation * the ability for Government to obtain more detailed information from carriers and carriage service providers in certain circumstances to support the work of the Critical Infrastructure Centre, and * the ability for Government to intervene and issue directions in cases in cases where there are significant national security concerns that cannot be addressed through other means. 50px Material was copied from this source, which is available under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License. Internet censorship and criticisms Since January 2000, internet content considered offensive or illegal has been subject to a statutory scheme administered by the ACMA. Established under Schedule 5 to the Broadcasting Services Act 1992, the online content scheme evolved from a tradition of Australian content regulation in broadcasting and other entertainment media. This tradition embodies the principle that ‚Äì while adults should be free to see, hear and read what they want ‚Äì children should be protected from material that may be unsuitable for (or harmful to) them, and everyone should be protected from material that is highly offensive. The online content scheme seeks to achieve these objectives by a number of means such as complaint investigation processes, government and industry collaboration, and community awareness and empowerment. While administration of the scheme is the responsibility of the ACMA, the principle of 'co-regulation' underpinning the scheme reflects parliament's intention that government, industry and the community each plays a role in managing internet safety issues in Australia. The ACMA has a significant cyber safety education program called CyberSmart which provides resources for youth, parents and teachers. Some people strongly disagree with this approach. They say the Australian constitution does not clearly provide either the states or the Federal Government power to censor online content, so internet censorship in Australia is typically an amalgam of various plans, laws, acts and policies. The regulator has been criticised for its role in examining internet censorship in Australia and how it is enabled and might further be enabled. Particular criticism has been leveled at the regulator's technical understanding of what is involved overall in internet regulation and censorship. On 10 March 2009, the ACMA issued the Australian web-hosting company, Bulletproof Networks, with an \\"interim link-deletion notice\\" due to its customer, the Whirlpool internet community website, not deleting a link to a page on an anti-abortion web site. The web page, which is the 6th of a series of pages featuring images of aborted babies, had been submitted to the ACMA, who determined it was potential prohibited content, by the user whose post on Whirlpool containing the ACMA's reply was later subject to the link-deletion notice. This came with an A$11,000 per day fine if the take down was not actioned after 24 hours. In order for other URLs contained on the same website to be 'prohibited', a separate complaint would need to be submitted and reviewed by the ACMA. As indicated above (the issuance) of an \\"interim link-deletion notice\\" is a consumer and business protection mechanism that ACMA has the authority to issue to a media or telecommunications provider, as required by the Telecommunications Act 1997, section 110 despite providers adopting it voluntarily or not ‚Äì through the Communications Alliance process. This gives ACMA access to consumer personal details such as name, phone number, address and other details. It is not known thoroughly for which purpose this information is required, protected and used (Citation needed) by other governmental departments and law enforcement agencies. =ACMA blacklist leaked= On 19 March 2009 it was reported that the ACMA's blacklist of banned sites had been leaked online, and had been published by WikiLeaks. Julian Assange, founder of WikiLeaks, obtained the blacklist after the ACMA blocked several WikiLeaks pages following their publication of the Danish blacklist. Assange said that \\"This week saw Australia joining China and the United Arab Emirates as the only countries censoring WikiLeaks.\\" Three lists purporting to be from the ACMA were published online over a seven-day period. The leaked list, which was reported to have been obtained from a manufacturer of internet filtering software, contained 2395 sites. Approximately half of the sites on the list were not related to child pornography, and included online gambling sites, YouTube pages, gay, straight, and fetish pornography sites, wikipedia entries, euthanasia sites, websites of fringe religions, Christian sites, and even the websites of a tour operator and a Queensland dentist. Colin Jacobs, spokesman for lobby group Electronic Frontiers Australia, said that there was no mechanism for a site operator to know they got onto the list or to request to be removed from it. Australia's Communications Minister, Stephen Conroy later blamed the addition of the dentist's website to the blacklist on the \\"Russian mob\\". Associate professor Bjorn Landfeldt of the University of Sydney said that the leaked list \\"constitutes a condensed encyclopedia of depravity and potentially very dangerous material\\". Stephen Conroy said the list was not the real blacklist and described its leak and publication as \\"grossly irresponsible\\" and that it undermined efforts to improve \\"cyber safety\\". He said that ACMA was investigating the incident and considering a range of possible actions including referral to the Australian Federal Police, and that Australians involved in making the content available would be at \\"serious risk of criminal prosecution\\". Conroy initially denied that the list published on WikiLeaks and the ACMA blacklist were the same, saying \\"This is not the ACMA blacklist.\\" He stated that the leaked list was alleged to be current on 6 August 2008 and contained 2,400 URLs, where the ACMA blacklist for the same date contained 1,061 URLs. He added that the ACMA advised that there were URLs on the leaked list that had never been the subject of a complaint or ACMA investigation, and had never been included on the ACMA blacklist. He was backed up by ISP Tech 2U, one of six ISPs involved in filtering technology trials. Conroy's denial was called into doubt by the Internet Industry Association (IIA), who publicly condemned the publishing of the list, chief executive Peter Coroneos saying, \\"No reasonable person could countenance the publication of links which promote access to child abuse images, irrespective of their motivation, which in this case appears to be political.\\" Conroy later claimed the leaked blacklist published on WikiLeaks closely resembled the official blacklist, admitting that the latest list (dated 18 March) \\"seemed to be close\\" to ACMA's current blacklist. In an estimates hearing of the Australian Federal Government on 25 May 2009 it was revealed that the leak was taken so seriously that it was referred to the Australian Federal Police for investigation. It was further stated that distribution of further updates to the list have been withheld until recipients can improve their security. Ms Nerida O'Laughlin of the ACMA confirmed that the list has been reviewed and as of 30 April consists of 997 URLs.

This is different from a post-entry closed shop (US: union shop), which is an agreement requiring all employees to join the union if they are not already members. In a union shop, the union must accept as a member any person hired by the employer.Pynes, Joan. Human Resources Management for Public and Nonprofit Organizations. 2d ed. Hoboken, N.J.: John Wiley and Sons, 2004. International Labour Organization covenants do not address the legality of closed shop provisions, leaving the question up to each individual nation.\\"Case(s) No(s). 188, Report No. 34 (Denmark): Complaints against the Government of Denmark presented by Swiss Printing Workers' Union and the Swiss Federation of National Christian Trade Unions.\\" Document No. 031960034188. Cases of the Committee on Freedom of Association. International Labor Organization. March 4, 1959. The legal status of closed shop agreements varies widely from country to country, ranging from bans on the agreement, to extensive regulation of the agreement to not mentioning it at all. Legal status =Council of Europe= The European Court of Human Rights held that Article 11 of the European Convention on Human Rights provides for a \\"negative right of association or, put in other words, a right not to be forced to join an association\\", in S√∏rensen and Rasmussen v. Denmark (2006). Therefore, closed shops are illegal under Article 11 of the Convention. United Kingdom Dunn and Gennard found 111 UK cases of dismissals on the introduction of a closed shop, involving 325 individuals, and they stated, \\"While proponents of the closed shop may argue that an estimated minimum 325 dismissals is a relatively small number compared with the total population covered by closed shops, critics would see the figure as substantial arguing that one dismissal is one too many\\". In relation to the pre-entry closed shop, they stated, \\"Its raison d'√™tre is to exclude people from jobs by denying them union membership\\". All forms of closed shops in the UK are illegal following the introduction of the Employment Act 1990. They were further curtailed under section 137(1)(a) of the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992 (c. 52)http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1992/ukpga_19920052_en_9#pt3-pb1-l1g137 passed by the Conservative government at the time. The Labour Party, then in opposition, had supported closed shops until December 1989, when it abandoned the policy in accordance with European legislation. Equity was one of the last trade unions in the United Kingdom to offer a pre-entry closed shop until the 1990 act. The famous English tort law case of Rookes v Barnard concerned a closed shop agreement.[1964] AC 1129. =United States= The Taft‚ÄìHartley Act outlawed the closed shop in the United States in 1947. The union shop was ruled illegal by the Supreme Court. States with right-to-work laws go further by not allowing employers to require employees to pay a form of union dues, called an agency fee. An employer may not lawfully agree with a union to hire only union members, but it may agree to require employees to join the union or pay the equivalent of union dues to it within a set period after starting employment. Similarly, a union could require an employer that had agreed to a closed shop contract prior to 1947 to fire an employee who had been expelled from the union for any reason, but it cannot demand an employer to fire an employee under a union shop contract for any reason other than failure to pay dues that are required by all employees. The US government does not permit the union shop in any federal agency, regardless of state law allowing for such. Construction unions and unions in other industries with similar employment patterns have coped with the prohibition of closed shops by using exclusive hiring halls as a means of controlling the supply of labor. Such exclusive hiring halls do not, strictly and formally require union membership as a condition of employment, but they do so in practical terms since an employee seeking to be dispatched to work through the union's hiring hall must pay union dues or a roughly-equivalent hiring hall fee. If the hiring hall is run on a non-discriminatory basis and adheres to clearly-stated eligibility and dispatch standards, it is lawful. The Taft‚ÄìHartley Act also bars unions from requiring unreasonably-high initiation fees as a condition of membership to prevent unions from using initiation fees as a device to keep non-union employees out of a particular industry. Also, the National Labor Relations Act permits construction employers to enter pre-hire agreements in which they agree to draw their workforces from a pool of employees dispatched by the union. The NLRA prohibits pre-hire agreements outside the construction industry.29 USCA 158. For the entertainment industry, unions representing performers have as their most important rule banning any represented performer from working on any non-union production. Penalties are imposed on the union member, not the employer, and can lead to loss of union membership. Most major productions are union productions, and nonmembers join the Screen Actors Guild by performing as extras and earning three union vouchers or by being given a speaking line and entering that way. The other performance unions do not have minimum membership standards, but those who join them are barred one from working on non-union productions. All four major sports leagues are union shops even though a franchise may be located in a state that has a right-to- work law or constitutional provision. =Canada= The status of closed shops varies from province to province within Canada. The Supreme Court has ruled that Section Two of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms guaranteed both the freedom to associate and the freedom not to associate, but employees in a work-environment largely dominated by a union were beneficiaries of union policies and so should pay union fees, regardless of membership status. However, religious and conscientious objectors were allowed the option of paying the amount to a registered charity instead. =Australia= All forms of closed shops in the Commonwealth are illegal under Workplace Relations Act 1996. There was an attempt by the Howard Government to change the definition of what constituted a closed shop under the Workplace Relations Legislation Amendment (More Jobs, More Pay) Bill 1999.

Measure 50 was a revised version of the law, which also passed, after being referred to the voters by the 1997 state legislature. Measure 47, sometimes referred to as a \\"cut and cap\\" law, reduced property taxes to the lesser of the 1994‚Äì95 tax or the 1995‚Äì96 tax minus 10 percent and limited future increases in assessed property values, except for new construction or additions, to 3 percent per year. It also instituted a \\"double majority\\" rule requiring at least a 50-percent voter turnout for all local tax measures in most elections (partially repealed in 2008 by Measure 56). It strengthened state constitutional limits, first imposed by Measure 5, on property taxes on real estate. Measure 47 was placed on the ballot by initiative petition by anti-tax activist Bill Sizemore and approved by voters in the November 1996 general election, with 704,554 votes in favor and 642,613 votes against. The law enacted by Measure 47 was amended in 1997, when the Oregon Legislative Assembly referred Measure 50 to voters to clarify that Measure 47 was intended to limit increases in real-estate assessments to 3 percent per year. The measure passed.  Measure 47  The measure was sponsored by Bill Sizemore and his Oregon Taxpayers United anti- tax group, as part of the Oregon tax revolt. Proponents were upset by rising property taxes, largely caused by increasing real-estate values in the Portland area. Proponents were concerned about levy elections when there was little awareness of issues and turnout was expected to be low. Under Oregon law, two regularly scheduled statewide elections, the primary election in May and the general election in November, are held in every even-numbered year. In addition, four regularly scheduled elections can be held at the local level every year. Beyond this, the legislature may call a special election at any time. Opponents feared that reducing taxes would cause cuts to schools beyond those they blamed on Measure 5. Furthermore, they opposed the double majority rule, arguing it gave non-voters more political power than those willing to vote. Confusion existed about the possible effects of Measure 47\\\\. Petitioners claimed that Measure 47 would cap the assessment of properties--the value of the property as determined by the county--to prevent taxes from being raised more than three percent annually. Others claimed that Measure 47 did not prevent such an action. Sizemore placed an argument in the Oregon voters' guide in an attempt to clarify the measure's provisions. Nonetheless, the legislature sent Measure 50 to voters the next year to clarify that the cap applied to the assessed value of the property as well. = Double majority rule = Measure 47 enacted Oregon's \\"double majority\\" rule, which placed an additional requirement on state and local tax levies. The rule applies to all elections besides general elections held in even-numbered years. For a levy initiative or referral to pass in other elections, not only do more voters have to vote \\"yes\\" than \\"no\\", but at least 50 percent of registered voters must vote in the election. The double majority is a type of supermajority similar to an absolute majority. In the U.S., general elections include presidential elections, held in even-numbered years once every four years on Election Day, the Tuesday after the first Monday in November. General elections also include midterm elections in which members of Congress, state legislators, and some state governors are chosen on Election Day in the years midway between presidential elections. Since the passage of Measure 47, the double majority requirement has caused the defeat of many proposed local tax levies. According to the League of Oregon Cities, between 1997 and 2007 of the 1,358 total tax measures on ballots in the state, 616 passed and 742 failed, and 169 of those failures resulted from the double majority rule. In response, local governments generally prefer placing such measures on general-election ballots. The measure also led to attempts to clean up the voter registration rolls. Registered voters who had died or moved away were being counted as \\"No\\" votes with the double majority requirement. (By law, Oregon ballot measures are worded so that \\"No\\" means \\"no change\\" and \\"Yes\\" means \\"adopt the measure.\\") In 1998, Measure 53 sought to reverse the double majority provision but won only 49 percent of the vote. In 2007, activists representing schools, the public employee union, and business interests lobbied the Oregon Legislative Assembly to scale back the requirement, and by June 2007 both houses of the legislature had approved House Joint Resolution 15, putting a measure before the voters on the November 2008 ballot. This measure appeared as Measure 56, and would exempt elections held in May and November of any year from the double majority requirement. It was later passed by voters on November 4, 2008. Proponents of the measure called the double majority rule undemocratic because, in their view, the rule gave non-voters unfair influence in the democratic process by allowing them to make measures fail that otherwise won support among the majority of those who actually voted. They also argued that because of Oregon's exclusive vote-by-mail voting system, which makes it more convenient to vote, there is no reason for people not to vote. Opponents considered unfair the idea that a small percentage of people could impose new taxes on others. They argued that the double majority rule was necessary to keep this from happening, and claimed that if it were repealed, taxes would rise too much.  Measure 50  Measure 50 was sent to the voters by the Oregon Legislature in 1997. Once passed by the voters, the measure replaced Measure 47. The problems with Measure 47 that Measure 50 aimed to address included a lack of precision about the assessment of property taxes, unintended consequences, and vulnerability to legal challenges.Voters' Pamphlet Special Election May 20, 1997 Measure 50 was approved by voters in the May 20, 1997 special election, with 429,943 votes in favor, and 341,781 votes against.election results for Measure 50 After the passage of Measure 47, as part of the ongoing anti-tax movement in Oregon, there was some confusion as to how the measure would be interpreted by the courts. One interpretation had the ballot measure reducing property tax revenues by $458 million in the fiscal year 1997‚Äì1998, while another interpretation, provided by the Oregon Attorney General,Department of Justice, State of Oregon - Attorney General Opinion Summaries had it providing a reduction of only $270 million. Much of this disagreement had to do with what limitations Measure 47 would place on increases in the assessment of a property's value. Measure 50 limited the adjustments in property tax assessments. Proponents argued that Measure 50 was necessary to avoid a lengthy legal battle as well as budget uncertainty about the possible effects of Measure 47. Opponents argued that Measure 50, rather than being a re-write of 47, was an attempt to water down the limitations imposed by Measure 47. Indeed, the estimated financial impact of Measure 50 was a $361 million reduction, rather than Measure 47's intended $458 million reduction.

It consists of two copies of each of the four core histone proteins (H2A, H2B, H3 and H4). The octamer assembles when a tetramer, containing two copies of both H3 and H4, complexes with two H2A/H2B dimers. Each histone has both an N-terminal tail and a C-terminal histone-fold. Both of these key components interact with DNA in their own way through a series of weak interactions, including hydrogen bonds and salt bridges. These interactions keep the DNA and histone octamer loosely associated and ultimately allow the two to re-position or separate entirely.  History of research Histone post-translational modifications were first identified and listed as having a potential regulatory role on the synthesis of RNA in 1964. Since then, over several decades, chromatin theory has evolved. Chromatin subunit models as well as the notion of the nucleosome were established in 1973 and 1974, respectively. Richmond and his research group has been able to elucidate the crystal structure of the histone octamer with DNA wrapped up around it at a resolution of 7 √Ö in 1984. The structure of the octameric core complex was revisited seven years later and a resolution of 3.1 √Ö was elucidated for its crystal at a high salt concentration. Though sequence similarity is low between the core histones, each of the four have a repeated element consisting of a helix-loop-helix called the histone fold motif. Furthermore, the details of protein-protein and protein-DNA interactions were fine-tuned by X-ray crystallography studies at 2.8 and 1.9 √Ö, respectively, in the 2000s. The histone octamer in molecular detail Core histones are four proteins called H2A, H2B, H3 and H4 and they are all found in equal parts in the cell. All four of the core histone amino acid sequences contain between 20 and 24% of lysine and arginine and the size or the protein ranges between 11400 and 15400 Daltons, making them relatively small, yet highly positively charged proteins. High content of positively charged amino acids allow them to closely associate with negatively charged DNA. Heterodimers, or histone-only intermediates are formed from histone-fold domains. The formation of histone only-intermediates proceeds when core histones are paired into the interlocked crescent shape quasi-symmetric heterodimer. Each histone fold domain is composed of 3 Œ±-helix regions that are separated by disordered loops. The histone fold domain is responsible for formation of head-to-tail heterodimers of two histones: H2A-H2B and H3-H4. However, H3 and H4 histones first form a heterodimer and then in turn the heterodimer dimerizes to form a tetramer H32-H42. The heterodimer formation is based on the interaction of hydrophobic amino acid residue interactions between the two proteins. Quasi symmetry allows the heterodimer to be superimposed on itself by a 180 degree rotation around this symmetry axis. As a result of the rotation, two ends of histones involved in DNA binding of the crescent shape H3-H4 are equivalent, yet they organize different stretches of DNA. The H2A-H2B dimer also folds similarly. The H32-H42 tetramer is wrapped with DNA around it as a first step of nucleosome formation. Then two H2A-H2B dimers are connected to the DNA- H32-H42 complex to form a nucleosome. Each of the four core histones, in addition to their histone-fold domains, also contain flexible, unstructured extensions called histone ‚Äútails‚Äù. Treatment of nucleosomes with protease trypsin indicates that after histone tails are removed, DNA is able to stay tightly bound to the nucleosome. Histone tails are subject to a wide array of modifications which includes phosphorylation, acetylation, and methylation of serine, lysine and arginine residues. The histone octamer in the nucleosome The nucleosome assembles when DNA wraps around the histone octamer, two H2A-H2B dimers bound to an H3-H4 tetramer. The nucleosome core particle is the most basic form of DNA compaction in eukaryotes. Nucleosomes consist of a histone octamer surrounded by 146 base pairs of DNA wrapped in a superhelical manner. In addition to compacting the DNA, the histone octamer plays a key role in the transcription of the DNA surrounding it. The histone octamer interacts with the DNA through both its core histone folds and N-terminal tails. The histone fold interacts chemically and physically with the DNA's minor groove. Studies have found that the histones interact more favorably with A:T enriched regions than G:C enriched regions in the minor grooves. The N-terminal tails do not interact with a specific region of DNA but rather stabilize and guide the DNA wrapped around the octamer. The interactions between the histone octamer and DNA, however, are not permanent. The two can be separated quite easily and often are during replication and transcription. Specific remodeling proteins are constantly altering the chromatin structure by breaking the bonds between the DNA and nucleosome. =Histone/DNA interactions= Histones are composed of mostly positively charged amino acid residues such as lysine and arginine. The positive charges allow them to closely associate with the negatively charged DNA through electrostatic interactions. Neutralizing the charges in the DNA allows it to become more tightly packed. Interactions with the minor groove The histone-fold domains‚Äô interaction with the minor groove accounts for the majority of the interactions in the nucleosome. As the DNA wraps around the histone octamer, it exposes its minor groove to the histone octamer at 14 distinct locations. At these sites, the two interact through a series of weak, non-covalent bonds. The main source of bonds comes from hydrogen bonds, both direct and water-mediated. The histone-fold hydrogen bonds with both phosphodiester backbone and the A:T rich bases. In these interactions, the histone fold binds to the oxygen atoms and hydroxyl side chains, respectively. Together these sites have a total of about 40 hydrogen bonds, most of which are from the backbone interactions. Additionially, 10 out of the 14 times that the minor groove faces the histone fold, an arginine side chain from the histone fold is inserted into the minor groove. The other four times, the arginine comes from a tail region of the histone. Tail interactions and modifications As mentioned above the histone tails have been shown to directly interact with the DNA of the nucleosome. Each histone in the octamer has an N-terminal tail that protrudes from the histone core. The tails play roles both in inter and intra nucleosomal interactions that ultimately influence gene access. Histones are positively charged molecules which allow a tighter bonding to the negatively charged DNA molecule. Reducing the positive charge of histone proteins reduces the strength of binding between the histone and DNA, making it more open to gene transcription (expression). Moreover, these flexible units direct DNA wrapping in a left- handed manner around the histone octamer during nucleosome formation. Once the DNA is bound the tails continue to interact with the DNA. The parts of the tail closest to the DNA hydrogen bond and strengthen the DNA's association with the octamer; the parts of the tail furthest away from the DNA, however, work in a very different manner. Cellular enzymes modify the amino acids in the distal sections of the tail to influence the accessibility of the DNA. The tails have also been implicated in the stabilization of 30-nm fibers. Research has shown removing certain tails prevents the nucleosomes from forming properly and a general failure to produce chromatin fiber. In all, these associations protect the nucleosomal DNA from the external environment but also lower their accessibility to cellular replication and transcriptional machinery. =Nucleosome remodeling and disassembly= In order to access the nucleosomal DNA, the bonds between it and the histone octamer must be broken. This change takes place periodically in the cell as specific regions are transcribed, and it happens genome-wide during replication. Remodeling proteins work in three distinct ways: they can slide the DNA along the surface of the octamer, replace the one histone dimer with a variant, or remove the histone octamer entirely. No matter the method, in order to modify the nucleosomes, the remodeling complexes require energy from ATP hydrolysis to drive their actions. Of the three techniques, sliding is the most common and least extreme. The basic premise of the technique is to free up a region of DNA that the histone octamer would normally tightly bind. While the technique is not well defined, the most prominent hypothesis is that the sliding is done in an ‚Äúinchworm‚Äù fashion. In this method, using ATP as an energy source, the translocase domain of the nucleosome-remodeling complex detaches a small region of DNA from the histone octamer. This ‚Äúwave‚Äù of DNA, spontaneously breaking and remaking the hydrogen bonds as it goes, then propagates down the nucleosomal DNA until it reaches the last binding site with the histone octamer. Once the wave reaches the end of the histone octamer the excess that was once at the edge is extended into the region of linker DNA. In total, one round of this method moves the histone octamer several base pairs in a particular direction‚Äîaway from the direction the ‚Äúwave‚Äù propagated. Clinical relevance Numerous reports show a link between age-related diseases, birth defects, and several types of cancer with disruption of certain histone post translational modifications. Studies have identified that N- and C-terminal tails are main targets for acetylation, methylation, ubiquitination and phosphorylation. New evidence is pointing to several modifications within the histone core. Research is turning towards deciphering the role of these histone core modifications at the histone-DNA interface in the chromatin. p300 and cAMP response element-binding protein (CBP) possess histone acetyltransferase activity. p300 and CBP are the most promiscuous histone acetyltransferase enzymes acetylating all four core histones on multiple residues. Lysine 18 and Lysine 27 on H3 were the only histone acetylation sites reduced upon CBP and p300 depletion in mouse embryonic fibroblasts. Also, CBP and p300 knockout mice have an open neural tube defect and therefore die before birth. p300‚àí/‚àí embryos exhibit defective development of the heart. CBP+/‚àí mice display growth retardation, craniofacial abnormalities, hematological malignancies, which are not observed in mice with p300+/‚àí. Mutations of both p300 have been reported in human tumors such as colorectal, gastric, breast, ovarian, lung, and pancreatic carcinomas. Also, activation or localization of two histone acetyltransferases can be oncogenic.

Biography When Drew joined 3M in St. Paul, Minnesota in 1921, it was a modest manufacturer of sandpaper. While testing their new Wetordry sandpaper at auto shops, Drew was intrigued to learn that the two-tone auto paintjobs so popular in the Roaring Twenties were difficult to manage at the border between the two colors. In response, after two years of work in 3M's labs, Drew invented the first masking tape (1925), a two-inch-wide tan paper strip backed with a light, pressure-sensitive adhesive. The first tape had adhesive along its edges but not in the middle. In its first trial run, it fell off the car and the frustrated auto painter growled at Drew, \\"take this tape back to those Scotch bosses of yours and tell them to put more adhesive on it!\\"3M Century of Highlights (1902 - 2002) - 3M New Zealand (By \\"Scotch,\\" he meant \\"cheap\\".)

In 1930 he came up with the world's first transparent cellophane adhesive tape (called sellotape in the UK and Scotch tape in the United States). During the Great Depression, people began using Scotch tape to repair items rather than replace them. This was the beginning of 3M‚Äôs diversification into all manner of marketplaces and helped them to flourish in spite of the Great Depression. Drew died in 1980 in Santa Barbara, California.

The histone fold averages about 70 amino acids and consists of three alpha helices connected by two short, unstructured loops. When not in the presence of DNA, the core histones assemble into head- to-tail intermediates (H3 and H4 first assemble into heterodimers then fuse two heterodimers to form a tetramer, while H2A and H2B form heterodimers) via extensive hydrophobic interactions between each histone fold domain in a \\"handshake motif\\". Also the histone fold was first found in TATA box-binding protein-associated factors, which is a main component in transcription. The histone fold‚Äôs evolution can be found by different combinations of ancestral sets of peptides that make up helix-strand-helix motif that come from the three folds from the ancestral fragments. These peptide chains can be found in the archaeal histones, which could have come from eukaryotic H3-H4 tetramer. The archaeal single-chain histones are also found in the bacterium Aquifex aeolicus. Which helps the diverse bacteria phylogeny coming from the ancestry of eukaryotes and archaea with lateral gene transfers to get to the bacteria. These lead into the octamer articulated protein endoskeleton for DNA compaction. From this endoskeleton it has a central segment that folds for the histone dimerization. This then leads into the end segments of the fold to make properties of dimer-dimer contacts that also cap the protein super helix at the octamer. One species that looked at is Drosophila, and in the subunits of the Drosophila transcription initiation factor has specific amino acid sequences that have different characteristics of the histone folds that make up the two proteins make up the subunits. When just looking at the histone fold motif in the Drosophila the protein-protein and the protein DNA interaction of the core histone proteins can be found by looking at the non- histone proteins. This can then be used in ‚ÄúStructural studies on the TAFII42/TAFII62 complex from Drosophila and HMfB from Methanococcus fervidus, proteins identified as containing the histone fold in the aforementioned searches, confirmed that a histone-like substructure exists in these proteins, with the individual proteins folding into the canonical histone fold motif‚Äù. The evolutionary structure and range of the histone protein-protein and DNA- protein interactions of the histone fold proteins has a very wide range of evolutionary traits that form the structures and other proteins. Histone folds play a role in the nucleosomal core particle by conserving histone interactions when looking at interface surfaces. These contain more than one histone fold. The structure of the nucleosome core particle has two modes that have the largest interaction surfaces with are in groups H3-H4 and H2A-H2B heterotypic dimer interactions. When looking at the H2A-H2A structure it has a modification of the loop at the interface that excludes it from clustering with the same interface of other structures. Which makes it have a different function in the transcriptional activation. Also the two modes are distinct due to having the longest helix chains. These use the handshake interactions between the two histone folds, while they also use it to make themselves unique comparted to the rest of the modes. Similarly modes 5 and 7 of the core nucleosome particle use two types of histone fold dimers which show that all histone domains share a similar structural motif to be able to be able to interact with one another and to interact in different ways. Showing how flexible and adaptive the structure of histones are. H4 and H2A can form an internucleosomal contacts that can be acetylated to be able to perform ionic interactions between two peptides, which in turn could change the surrounding internucleosomal contacts that can make a way to opening the chromatin.

He served Baldwin I of Jerusalem for many years, and wrote a chronicle of the Crusade, writing in Latin. Life Fulcher was born in 1059. His appointment as chaplain of Baldwin of Boulogne in 1097 suggests that he had been trained as a priest, most likely at the school of Chartres. However, he was probably not a member of the cathedral chapter, since he is not named in the listing of the Dignitaries of the Church of Our Lady of Chartres. The details of the Council of Clermont in his history suggest he attended the council personally, or knew someone who did, perhaps bishop Ivo of Chartres, who also influenced Fulcher's opinions on Roman Catholic Church reform and the investiture controversy with the Holy Roman Empire. Fulcher was part of the entourage of Count Stephen of Blois and Robert of Normandy which made its way through southern France and Italy in 1096, crossing into the Eastern Roman Empire from Bari and arriving in Constantinople in 1097, where they joined with the other armies of the First Crusade. He travelled through Asia Minor to Marash, shortly before the army's arrival at Antioch in 1097, where he was appointed chaplain to Baldwin of Boulogne. He followed his new lord after Baldwin split off from the main army, to Edessa, where Baldwin founded the county of Edessa. After the conquest of Jerusalem in 1099 Fulcher and Baldwin travelled to the city to complete their vow of pilgrimage. When Baldwin became king of Jerusalem in 1100, Fulcher came with him to Jerusalem and continued to act as his chaplain until Baldwin died in 1118. At that time, Fulcher may have been serving as Prior at the Mount of Olives. After 1115 he was the canon of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, possibly attached to the Canons of the Holy Sepulchre, and was probably responsible for the relics and treasures in the church. Fulcher was a resident of Jerusalem until 1127. After that date, nothing further is known about him. Any details about his death are unknown. Chronicle Fulcher wrote his chronicle of the Crusade Gesta Francorum Iherusalem Perefrinantium (A history of the expedition to Jerusalem) in three books. He started writing it in 1101 and finished around 1128. The chronicle is considered among the best records of the crusade. Included in the chronicle is his account of Pope Urban II's November 1095 speech at the Council of Clermont where Urban calls for the First Crusade: > [Your] brethren who live in the east are in urgent need of your help, and > you must hasten to give them the aid which has often been promised them. > For, as the most of you have heard, the Turks and Arabs have attacked them > and have conquered the territory of Romania [the Greek empire] as far west > as the shore of the Mediterranean and the Hellespont, which is called the > Arm of St. George. They have occupied more and more of the lands of those > Christians, and have overcome them in seven battles. They have killed and > captured many, and have destroyed the churches and devastated the empire. If > you permit them to continue thus for awhile with impurity, the faithful of > God will be much more widely attacked by them. At the earliest, Fulcher began his chronicle in the late autumn of 1100, or at the latest in the spring of 1101, in a version that has not survived but which was transmitted to Europe during his lifetime. This version was completed around 1106 and was used as a source by Guibert of Nogent, a contemporary of Fulcher in Europe. He began his work at the urging of his travelling companions, who probably included Baldwin I. He had at least one library in Jerusalem at his disposal, from which he had access to letters and other documents of the crusade. In this library the Historia Francorum of Raymond of Aguilers and the Gesta Francorum must also have been available, which served as sources for much of the specific information in Fulcher's work that he did not personally witness. Fulcher divided his chronicle into three books. Book I described the preparations for the First Crusade in Clermont in 1095 up to the conquest of Jerusalem and the establishment of the Kingdom of Jerusalem by Godfrey of Bouillon. It included an enthusiastic description of Constantinople. The second book described the deeds of Baldwin I, who succeeded Godfrey and was king of Jerusalem from 1100 to 1118. The third and final book reported on the life of king Baldwin II, until 1127 when there was a plague in Jerusalem, during which Fulcher apparently died. The second and third books were written from around 1109 to 1115, and from 1118 to 1127, compiled into a second edition by Fulcher himself. Fulcher's work was used by many other chroniclers who lived after him. William of Tyre and William of Malmesbury used part of the chronicle as a source. His chronicle is generally accurate, though not entirely so. It was published in the Recueil des historiens des croisades and the Patrologia Latina, and a critical edition of the Latin version was published by Heinrich Hagenmeyer in 1913.

He stated: \\"When I was 9 years old I used to scam quarters from my parents and sneak out to this local bowling alley that was so seedy Hubert Selby Jr. would get the creeps there. It smelled like personal abandonment. That's what I think of when I play my favorite game\\". Sessler has a younger brother, Jonathan, who appeared as Adam 2.0 in X-Play's 2005 April Fool's Day Episode, a \\"clone\\" of Adam who claims he's much better-looking than the original Adam with a \\"special USB port\\" (a reference to the Game Boy Advance SP succeeding the original Game Boy Advance).IMDB ‚Äì Jonathan Oliver Sessler  Career  Sessler was the last remaining personality from the ZDTV network, surviving the network's progression from ZDTV (1998‚Äì2000) to TechTV (2000‚Äì2004), and subsequent transition to G4. Sessler was one of seven TechTV personalities, with Morgan Webb, Sarah Lane, Kevin Rose, Chi-Lan Lieu, Blair Butler and Brendan Moran, to survive the massive layoffs resulting from the May 2004 merger of G4 and TechTV. In addition to co-hosting X-Play, Sessler also appeared semi-regularly on Attack of the Show! as a video game correspondent. On April 1, 2005, Sessler confused many by announcing he was leaving X-Play to host a late night talk show on G4 entitled Meet the Sess. A trailer of the new show aired on X-Play, showing Sessler verbally and physically abusing his guests until they released information about upcoming video games. Despite being extremely over-the-top and obviously fake, many viewers began flooding the G4 forums asking when the show would air, and if Sessler was really leaving X-Play. On several occasions, Sessler has since publicly announced that the show was in fact an April Fool's Day joke. However, he had a podcast called Sessler's Soapbox as well as Feedback, where he discussed various gaming topics with other G4 correspondents and guests until late 2011, when he was replaced by Blair Herter. On April 25, 2012, Sessler's employment contract was terminated by G4TV. No reason was given for his termination. As of October 2012, he is listed as a judge on Syfy's reality competition Viral Video Showdown. On November 12, 2012, Sessler announced that he was joining Revision3. He remained with the network as Editor-in-Chief and Executive Producer of games content at Rev3Games until April 2014, when he announced his departure to \\"explore new opportunities\\" within \\"gaming that help further the medium\\". On April 2, 2014, Adam Sessler announced he was leaving Revision3 and would pursue a career outside video game journalism. On June 9, 2014, Sessler appeared as a panelist on Spike TV's coverage of E3 2014. On June 19, 2015, he was featured as pre-show and post-show host of the Bethesda Game Studios E3 event alongside his past co-worker Morgan Webb.

In the United Kingdom, postal addresses with a number followed by a letter may indicate a separate address within a larger, often residential building. Baker Street in the late 19th century was a high-class residential district, and Holmes' apartment would probably have been part of a Georgian terrace. The residence was introduced in the novel A Study in Scarlet (1887). At the time the Holmes stories were published, addresses in Baker Street did not go as high as 221. Baker Street was later extended, and in 1932 the Abbey National Building Society moved into premises at 219‚Äì229 Baker Street. For many years, Abbey National employed a full-time secretary to answer mail addressed to Sherlock Holmes. In 1990, a blue plaque signifying 221B Baker Street was installed at the Sherlock Holmes Museum, situated elsewhere on the same block, and there followed a 15-year dispute between Abbey National and the Holmes Museum for the right to receive mail addressed to 221B Baker Street. Since the closure of Abbey House in 2005, ownership of the address by the Holmes Museum has not been challenged, despite its location between 237 and 241 Baker Street. Conan Doyle's intentions When the \\"Sherlock Holmes\\" stories were first published, street numbers in Baker Street did not go as high as 221. The section north of Marylebone Road near Regent's Park ‚Äì now including 221 Baker Street ‚Äì was known in Conan Doyle's lifetime as Upper Baker Street. In his first manuscript, Conan Doyle put Holmes' house in Upper Baker Street. However, a British crime novelist named Nigel Morland claimed that, late in Conan Doyle's life, he identified the junction of Baker Street and George Street, about 500 metres south of the Marylebone Road, as the location of 221B. Sherlockian experts have also held to alternative theories as to where the original 221B was located and have maintained that it was further down Baker Street. Real 221B Baker Street addresses =Abbey National= The plaque on the former Abbey House HQ When street numbers were reallocated in the 1930s, the block of odd numbers from 215 to 229 was assigned to an Art Deco building known as Abbey House, constructed in 1932 for the Abbey Road Building Society, which the society and its successor (which subsequently became Abbey National plc) occupied until 2002. Almost immediately, the building society started receiving correspondence from Sherlock Holmes fans all over the world, in such volumes that it appointed a permanent \\"secretary to Sherlock Holmes\\" to deal with it. A bronze plaque on the front of Abbey House carried a picture of Holmes and a quotation, but was removed from the building several years ago. Its present whereabouts are unknown. In 1999, Abbey National sponsored the creation of a bronze statue of Sherlock Holmes that now stands at the entrance to Baker Street Underground station. =Sherlock Holmes Museum= 221B Baker Street, London 221B Baker Street from inside The Sherlock Holmes Museum is situated within an 1815 townhouse very similar to the 221B described in the stories and is located between 237 and 241 Baker Street. It displays exhibits in period rooms, wax figures and Holmes memorabilia, with the famous study overlooking Baker Street the highlight of the museum. The description of the house can be found throughout the stories, including the 17 steps leading from the ground-floor hallway to the first- floor study. (). According to the published stories, \\"221B Baker Street\\" was a suite of rooms on the first floor of a lodging house above a flight of 17 steps. The main study overlooked Baker Street, and Holmes' bedroom was adjacent to this room at the rear of the house, with Dr. Watson's bedroom being on the floor above, overlooking a rear yard that had a plane tree in it.. =Address controversy= The street number 221B was assigned to the Sherlock Holmes Museum on 27 March 1990 (replacing the logical address 239 Baker Street) when the Leader of Westminster City Council, Shirley Porter, unveiled a blue plaque signifying the address of 221B Baker Street. She was invited to renumber the museum's building to coincide with its official opening (and because the number 221B had not been included in the original planning consent for the museum granted in October 1989). A long-running dispute over the number arose between the Sherlock Holmes Museum, the building society Abbey National (which had previously answered the mail addressed to Sherlock Holmes) and subsequently the local Westminster City Council. The main objection to the Museum's role in answering the letters was that the number 221B bestowed on the Museum by the Council was out of sequence with the other numbers in the street: an issue that has since vexed local bureaucrats, who have striven for years to keep street numbers in sequence. In 2005, Abbey National vacated their headquarters in Baker Street, which left the museum to battle with Westminster City Council to end the dispute over the number, which had created negative publicity. Eventually the museum was granted special permission by the City of Westminster to bear the address of 221B Baker Street. In 2018 Quartz revealed that, according to court documents and the Panama Papers, the property was owned at least partially by relatives of Nursultan Nazarbayev, then Kazakhstani president. In other media The sitting room of 221B Baker Street displayed at The Sherlock Holmes public house Shooting the \\"221B Baker Street\\" exterior in North Gower Street The fictional address has been portrayed in the following pastiches of Sherlock Holmes: *In the animated film The Great Mouse Detective (1986), based on the Basil of Baker Street book series, Basil resides in 221¬Ω Baker Street, a mouse-hole beneath 221B Baker Street. *Private detective Louie Knight moves into an office at 22/1B Stryd-y-Popty (which translates as Baker Street in Welsh) in Malcolm Pryce's Welsh Noir parody The Unbearable Lightness of Being in Aberystwyth. *The 1987 CBS movie The Return of Sherlock Holmes (not to be confused with the 1986 British television series of the same name) features Holmes, cryogenically frozen in 1899 and awakened in modern times, trying to adapt with the aid of Watson's granddaughter, Jane. He seeks out his old residence and finds the spot occupied by a McDonald's franchise. *Dr. Gregory House, the protagonist of House, M.D., lives at 221 Baker Street, Apartment B, Princeton, New Jersey. *Danger Mouse, in the cartoon show of the same name, lives in a pillar box near 221b Baker Street. However, Danger Mouse is a loose parody of Danger Man and James Bond, rather than Sherlock Holmes. The pillar box is a stone's throw away from 221B Baker Street and Dr. Watson throws stones at them in apparent jealousy that he only works for the world's greatest detective, not the world's greatest secret agent in the episode \\"Where There's a Well, There's a Way\\". *In the Phryne Fisher series by Kerry Greenwood, the detective Hon. Phryne Fisher resides at 221 The Esplanade, St Kilda (Melbourne, Australia), which she renumbers to 221B in homage to Holmes. *In Star Trek: The Next Generation, Data tells another crew member that Geordi La Forge can be found at 221b Baker St, episode 29 \\"Elementary, Dear Data\\" (1988), and 221b Baker St. is again referenced in episode 137 \\"Ship in a Bottle\\" (1993). *In the 2013 Season 2, Episode 1 of Elementary, Sherlock Holmes and Joan Watson visit London and stay in a second floor residence numbered 221B. Sherlock indicates he had happily resided there before his move to New York City. * In the 2015 film Mr. Holmes, a long-retired Holmes (Ian McKellen) remarks that the Baker Street address is one of several fictitious details created by Watson, who wrote the cases up as sensationalist stories for publication. In a flashback, as curious onlookers gather outside 221B, Holmes watches from a window of his actual residence nearby and congratulates a client for finding the right address. *The BBC Television series Sherlock has used 187 North Gower Street to represent 221B Baker Street for shooting the exterior scenes of Sherlock Holmes' flat. The location is near Euston railway station, and roughly a mile away from the real Baker Street. * In the 2012‚Äì2015 Australian television series Miss Fisher's Murder Mysteries, the title character of The Honourable Phryne Fisher (Essie Davis) lives at 221B Baker Street in Melbourne, Victoria.

Publication history The All-Star Squadron debuted in a special insert in Justice League of America #193 (August 1981). The new team was launched in its own series the following month and was created by Roy Thomas, Rich Buckler and Jerry Ordway. The eponymous comic book series was published for 67 issues from September 1981 to March 1987 and three annuals were published as well. When Rich Buckler left the series after the fifth issue, editor Len Wein hired Adrian Gonzales as a replacement and notified Roy Thomas with a note stating \\"You're going to like Adrian Gonzales\\". He drew the series for 13 issues which included a crossover with the Justice League of AmericaManning \\"1980s\\" in Dolan, p. 198: \\"The Justice League of America teamed up with the Justice Society of America on a large- scale with 'Crisis on Earth-Prime', a five-part saga that crossed from the pages of Justice League of America into All-Star Squadron...A collaboration between writers Gerry Conway and Roy Thomas, and artists Don Heck and Adrian Gonzales, the saga also featured cover artwork by DC luminaries George P√©rez and Joe Kubert.\\" Justice League of America #207- 209 (Oct.-Dec. 1982) and All- Star Squadron #14-15 (Oct.-Nov. 1982) Jerry Ordway, who had inked the series since its start, became the penciler as of issue #19 (March 1983). He and Thomas co-created the Infinity, Inc. team in issue #25 (Sept. 1983).Manning \\"1980s\\" in Dolan, p. 203: \\"The children of the original Justice Society of America made their smash debut in this issue by writer Roy Thomas and penciler Jerry Ordway...All-Star Squadron #25 marked the first appearances of future cult-favorite heroes Jade, Obsidian, Fury, Brainwave Jr., the Silver Scarab, Northwind, and Nuklon.\\" All-Star Squadron #32 (April 1984) and #33 (May 1984) detailed how the Freedom Fighters traveled from Earth-Two to Earth-X. Several issues of the series detailed origins of various characters including Amazing- Man, Starman, Doctor Fate, Liberty Belle, the Shining Knight, Robotman, Johnny Quick, and the Tarantula. The concept All-Star Squadron #1 contains \\"An Open Letter to the Readers\\" written by Roy Thomas. In it he describes the impetus for the series, namely, DC wanted a comic book telling tales of the Justice Society of America. The last series to do so was All Star Comics, which lasted only seventeen issues, ending in 1979. As Roy Thomas put it, DC management gave him \\"a chance to write a return of the JSA\\". Instead of writing stories in the modern era, Roy Thomas decided to place the tales during World War II. The setting would be DC's fictional world of Earth-Two, a parallel universe to the mainstream DC continuity established during the 1960s, to explain how DC characters who were well established having adventures in the 1940s could still be in their 30s in contemporary comics. The cast of characters would include a large ensemble of heroes from both the DC stable and the Quality Comics Group (which had been purchased by DC). With so many characters to choose from, the creative team decided to concentrate on \\"quite promising characters who have been ignored or underplayed for years\\", instead of those Earth-Two characters who had counterparts on Earth-One. Roy Thomas writes: \\"If we lost the original GL, we gained the Earth-Two Robotman; if we dropped Jay (Flash) Garrick, we picked up on Johnny Quick; Liberty Belle could stand in for Wonder Woman till more super-powered ladies came along. We even tossed in an Earth-Two version of the venerable Plastic Man, whose series in Adventure was just folding‚Ä¶\\" The All-Star Squadron was an example of \\"retroactive continuity\\" or \\"retcon\\", as it rewrote the already-established history of DC superheroes that had been published during the 1940s. The first known use of the term \\"retcon\\" was by Roy Thomas in the letter column of All- Star Squadron #20 (April 1983). Several story lines ironed out continuity errors, fleshed out characters' origins and rewrote earlier stories to explain inconsistencies in character development, resolve lingering questions or fill in missing details. The Trylon and Perisphere, actual structures constructed in Flushing Meadows, Queens, New York for the 1939 New York World's Fair, housed the Squadron's headquarters. The Perisphere contained the Squadron meeting hall, while the Trylon was retrofitted as an aircraft hangar/vertical launch platform. The All-Star Squadron had a robotic butler named Gernsback, who was based on the Elektro robots from the fair and was named after science fiction publisher Hugo Gernsback. After the 1985 DC Comics storyline Crisis on Infinite Earths merged the various parallel worlds DC had established over the decades into a single universe, the older, \\"Golden Age\\" versions of DC's mainstream heroes were largely eliminated from continuity. The All-Star Squadron was left only with the characters unique to that time period. Superman, Batman, Robin, Wonder Woman, Aquaman, Green Arrow, Plastic Man and several other heroes were no longer extant at that point in history, and had thus never been Squadron members. In part to clear the slate after the events of Crisis on Infinite Earths and to re-launch the franchise, All Star Squadron was canceled with issue #67 and replaced with a successor series, Young All- Stars. The principal characters featured in Young All-Stars were considered spiritual and contextual analogs for the missing characters: Iron Munro for Superman, Fury for Wonder Woman, Flying Fox for Batman, Dan the Dyna-Mite for Robin, and Neptune Perkins for Aquaman. Evil analogs were also created for the missing characters at the same time: √úbermensch, Der Grosshorn Eule, Fledermaus, Usil, and Sea Wolf. Young All-Stars was published for 31 issues and one annual. In a nod to the original JSA adventures in All Star Comics, writer Roy Thomas tried to include at least a cameo appearance by the Golden Age Hawkman in every issue, since Hawkman was the one hero to appear in every Golden Age issue of All Star Comics, including the two pre-JSA issues. Unfortunately, the artwork for issue #49 was printed without Hawkman's cameo included, so it became the only issue to break the streak. The string of appearances had already been broken several issues into a mid-1970s revival of All Star Comics. When writer Gerry Conway revived the Justice Society in their own regular series in 1976, he initially intended to have the younger members of the group, including Power Girl and the Star-Spangled Kid, spun off into their own team and potential series of their own, to be called the All-Star Squadron. The group's name was subsequently changed to the Super Squad, after management at DC worried that the team's original name would be abbreviated as A.S.S. Fictional history Captain Marvel. Art by Rich Buckler. On the day of the bombing of Pearl Harbor, President Franklin Roosevelt gathered available superheroes‚Äîincluding members of the Justice Society of America, Freedom Fighters, Seven Soldiers of Victory and solo heroes‚Äîat the White House. He asked them to band together for the war as the All-Star Squadron to battle sabotage and keep the peace on the home front during World War II. The rationale for not using the Squadron in combat situations in the European or Pacific Theaters of War was that Adolf Hitler had possession of the Spear of Destiny, a mystical object that gave him control of any superheroes with magic-based powers or a vulnerability to magic (including Superman, Green Lantern, Doctor Fate and others) who crossed into territory held by the Axis Powers. At the time, many of the Justice Society members had been captured by the time-travelling villain Per Degaton with the help of JSA foes he had pulled back in time, but the available heroes were asked to first guard against a potential attack on the West Coast of the United States. Degaton himself used some stolen Japanese planes with hypnotized troopers to launch such an attack on San Francisco, hoping to change history by making the United States fight to a stalemate against Japan, enabling him to take over the world, so the new Squadron's first major mission was to stop the attack and rescue the captured heroes, who also became part of the new group. Due to Per Degaton going back in time after the JSA were freed they forgot his involvement, though the events were not wiped. America's entry into the war caused several of the members of the JSA to enlist, or be drafted in their civilian identities. These included Alan Scott, Starman, Hawkman, The Atom and Johnny Thunder.

Wine is grown and produced in a triangular area of about 60 km sides bordered by Canberra, Yass, and Bungendore, taking in the important localities of Murrumbateman and Lake George. The district is noted as a cool-climate wine area, but encompasses a substantial climatic range, with the lower altitude and more inland regions near Yass substantially warmer than the higher altitude areas near Bungendore. History The industry dates from the 1970s, although wines were produced in the settlement near Yass in the 1860s. Climate and geography The region is part of the Southern Tablelands about inland from the Pacific Ocean. The region receives moderate, but variable rainfall, and vineyards require supplemental irrigation in most years. Typical vineyard elevations range between , and the inland location result in relatively high continentality, possibly explaining the affinity for leading varieties Shiraz and Riesling. Promising recent results from Tempranillo may be explained by the strong homoclime to Ribera del Duero.Smart, R.

The character was created by writer John Albano and artist Tony DeZuniga. Hex is a surly and cynical bounty hunter whose face is horribly scarred on the right side. Despite his poor reputation and personality, Hex is bound by a personal code of honor to protect and avenge the innocent. The character was portrayed by Josh Brolin in the 2010 film adaptation of the same name. Thomas Jane provided his voice in a DC Animated short film. He is portrayed by Johnathon Schaech in DC's Legends of Tomorrow and appeared in the Arrowverse crossover \\"Crisis on Infinite Earths\\". Publication history =Debut= The character first appeared in a full- page in-house ad for All-Star Western No. 10 which was published in various November/December 1971-dated DC comics, including a few of DC's war comics line, as well as a half-page version of the same house ad in Batman No. 237. This house ad contains the first published images of Jonah Hex, as well as two dialogue-filled comic strip panels not used in his first full-story appearance. His first full-story appearance was published a few weeks later in volume two of All-Star Western No. 10 (February‚ÄìMarch 1972), which was renamed Weird Western Tales with its twelfth issue. Jonah Hex headlined the new title right up until issue #38, at which point Scalphunter took over the spotlight while Jonah Hex moved into his own self-titled series in 1977. The series lasted for 92 issues with Michael Fleisher as the main writer and Tony DeZuniga providing much of the art. In a 2010 interview with Filipino journalist Anna Valmero, DeZuniga described the moment he first conceived the image that would become Jonah Hex: \\"When I went to my doctor, I saw this beautiful chart of the human anatomy. And I saw the anatomy of the figure was split in half, straight from head to toe. Half his skeleton was there, half his nerves and muscles. That's where I got the idea it won't be too bad if his distortion would be half.\\" =Hex= Jonah Hex was canceled during Crisis on Infinite Earths in which Jonah also appeared along with Scalphunter and other western heroes in issue No. 3, but in the same year Jonah moved to a new eighteen-issue series titled Hex, also penned by Michael Fleisher. In a bizarre turn of events, Hex found that he had been transported to the 21st century and became somewhat of a post-apocalyptic warrior,Manning, Matthew K. \\"1980s\\" in Dolan, p. 214: \\"Transported from the Wild West of the past to a dystopic future society, Jonah Hex had to adapt to the times in this brave new world and series crafted by writer Michael Fleisher and artist Mark Texeira.\\" reminiscent of Mad Max. The series had mediocre success in the United States but was critically acclaimed and well received in Great Britain, Italy, Spain and Japan. =Limited series= Three Jonah Hex miniseries have been published under DC's Vertigo imprint. These series, written by Joe R. Lansdale and drawn by Tim Truman, fit more into the western-horror genre, as Hex interacts with zombies (\\"Two-Gun Mojo\\" #1‚Äì5, 1993), a Cthulhoid monster (\\"Riders of the Worm and Such\\" #1‚Äì5, 1995) and spirit people (\\"Shadows West\\" #1‚Äì3, 1999). =Jonah Hex vol. 2= A new monthly Jonah Hex series debuted in November 2005Jonah Hex Vol 3 No. 1 (cover date January 2006), written by Justin Gray and Jimmy Palmiotti with interior art by varying (and occasionally recurring) artists. In assorted postings on their message board, Gray and Palmiotti have stated their intent was to depict various adventures from across the full length of Hex's life and career. The main artistic difference is that the series is published without the external restraints of the Comics Code Authority which allows for harder edged stories without having to keep with the Vertigo imprint's dark fantasy themes. Tony DeZuniga, the original Hex artist, returned to pencil two issues of the book (#5 and #9). John Higgins drew issue No. 28Riding With Jonah Hex: John Higgins , Newsarama, February 6, 2008 and J. H. Williams III provided the art for Jonah Hex No. 35,JH Williams: On Drawing Jonah Hex, Newsarama, September 4, 2008 expressing an interest in doing more: \\"I certainly want to do more issues myself or even a graphic novel if the opportunity and schedule presented itself.\\"Jonah Hex's Good Luck Eye on Comics, August 21, 2008 To coincide with the release of the film Gray and Palmiotti wrote an original graphic novel, No Way Back (), that was illustrated by Tony DeZuniga. =All-Star Western vol. 3= In September 2011, The New 52 rebooted DC's continuity. With this change, Jonah Hex volume 2 was canceled and Jonah transitioned as the lead story in All-Star Western volume 3 (November 2011). While Jonah Hex vol. 2 consisted of standalone stories, All- Star Western features an ongoing story arc that finds Jonah in Gotham City during the 1880s, teamed up with Amadeus Arkham. Fictional character biography =Origins= Born November 1, 1838 in northwestern Missouri, to Woodson and Virginia Hex, Jonah was a regular victim of physical abuse as a child at the hands of his father. In 1851 his father sold him into slavery to an Apache tribe. They worked him constantly until one day when he saved their chieftain from a puma and he was welcomed as a full-fledged member of the tribe. The chief took Jonah as his own son, but his adopted brother, Noh- Tante, grew jealous. Noh-Tante shared Jonah's affections for a young girl named White Fawn, so he betrayed his brother during their manhood rite at the age of 16 and left Jonah for dead with their enemies, the Kiowa.Jonah Hex No. 7 He was rescued by a Cavalry patrol, although they shot him in the gut when he tried to stop their slaughter. Left for dead a second time, he was nursed back to health by an old trapper in the woods. Returning to his tribe's camp, he found them long since gone.Jonah Hex No. 8 =American Civil War= As Jonah grew into adulthood, he joined the United States Army as a cavalry scout. By 1861, the country was radically divided. When war erupted between the Northern states and the Southern states, Jonah shifted his loyalties to the newly formed Confederate States Army and earned a commission as a lieutenant in the 4th CS Cavalry. During this time, Jonah met a fellow soldier named Jeb Turnbull and the two became close friends. As time went on, Hex found himself increasingly torn between his loyalties to the South and his feelings towards the treatment of slaves. In September 1862, President Abraham Lincoln announced his Emancipation Proclamation ‚Äì a proposed bill that would outlaw slavery in most slave-holding states. Jonah realized that he could no longer support a system that elected to hold his fellow man in bondage, however, he had no intention of betraying his comrades by cooperating with the Union. Therefore, he felt that the best option available to him was to surrender and wait out the war. He abandoned his post and went to the Union camp at Fort Charlotte, sneaking into the Camp captain's quarters to surrender directly.Jonah Hex No. 36 The camp's captain pressured Hex to reveal the location of his Confederate unit, but Jonah refused to yield the information. However, an orderly examined samples of clay from the iron shoes on Hex's horse, and determined where the Confederate soldiers were stationed. The Union soldiers tracked the enemy back to their camp and took them by surprise. As the Confederate soldiers were arrested, the Union captain, smarting from the fact that Hex was able to penetrate the fort's security, publicly thanked Jonah for his assistance, marking him as a traitor in the eyes of his former unit. Hex responded by brutally punching him and was sentenced to solitary confinement. Jonah found a shaft beneath his cell and used it to access the compound where Jeb Turnbull and the other prisoners were being held. He aided them in trying to escape, but the fort's soldiers were prepared for them. Unbeknownst to Hex, the Captain had deliberately had the \\"escape tunnel\\" dug. The fort did not have enough food to support its soldiers, let alone prisoners, so he had manipulated Hex into staging a breakout so that he could legitimately claim that the prisoners were shot trying to escape. In an event that history would know as the \\"Fort Charlotte Massacre,\\" the Union soldiers shot down nearly every escapee in cold blood, including Jeb Turnbull. Jonah found himself a victim of a Union bullet as well but managed to survive long enough to kill the camp's captain. The handful of survivors, unaware of the captain's treachery, blamed Jonah and spread the word of his apparent betrayal. Following the Fort Charlotte Massacre, Jonah patched himself up and moved out toward the Western territories. =Mark of the Demon= Eventually returning to his village in 1866, Jonah found that Noh-Tante had married White Fawn. He declared Noh-Tante's betrayal to the chieftain, but the accusations were denied and it was decided that they would deliberate through trial by combat. Noh-Tante sabotaged Jonah's tomahawk, forcing him to cheat and end the fight with his knife. For breaking the rules of combat and killing his son, the chieftain declared that Jonah would be branded with the mark of the demon and exiled under penalty of death. The mark of the demon punishment consists of pushing a scorching tomahawk against the branded one's cheek; thus Hex received his distinctive feature. Years later when he returned again to rescue a kidnapped white woman, he was captured and White Fawn was shot dead by the chieftain for trying to help him escape. Jonah killed his adopted father in return and gunned down half the tribe who went after him, with the help of Henri d'Aubergnon. =Bounty hunter= Jonah Hex was inspired to become a bounty hunter after murdering his first criminal, the outlaw Lucas \\"Mad Dog\\" McGill. He gunned down Mad Dog while the man was beating his wife outside of a saloon; in his inebriated stupor, Hex believed him to be his own father, Woodson Hex, abusing his mother, Virginia Hex. The local deputy insisted that, even drunk, it was the fastest draw he had ever seen and gave him the massive bounty on McGill's head. Hex accepted the money and scattered it on the streets as he rode out of town.Secret Origins Vol.3 No. 21 (December 1987) His first bounty poster was in 1866 on an old army buddy named Eddie Cantwell.Jonah Hex No. 30 The manhunter Arbee Stoneham stole Hex's reward by murdering Cantwell and then humiliated him by taking his guns.Jonah Hex No. 31 Eight years later they met again while Hex was bringing down the Jason Crowley gang.

This team included Jonah Hex alongside Black Pirate, Enemy Ace, Miss Liberty, and the Viking Prince; to make them powerful enough to become a threat, they were each energized with a special force. Their purpose was to fight the Justice League and Justice Society to strengthen their resolve through defeat, which they succeeded in doing.Justice League of America No. 159 Eventually, the Five Warriors rebelled against their master and assaulted the Palace of Eternity. Hex got into a gun-fight with a T-Rex, but they were defeated and eventually returned to their own times using the Cosmic Treadmill.Justice League of America No. 160 He later encountered the Justice League separately, with several other Western heroes including Bat Lash, Cinnamon, and Scalphunter.

His intention was to use the time-traveling gunfighter as a warrior, but instead Jonah escaped and met a motorcycle gang named the Road Reapers. They immediately took him in after he rescued their warrior Stiletta, and he obtained a zonesuit to protect himself from radiation by killing their cowardly leader, Falcon, in self- defense.Hex No. 1 His next companions were a group of soldiers from the Vietnam War, although they were betrayed by a robotic duplicate of Stiletta and none survived except for a Cpt. Stanley Harris.Hex No. 2 Briefly, he became shotgun man for a drug dealer named Barnaby Blossom. When he discovered that Barnaby was getting kids hooked, he killed the man.Hex No. 3 The real Stiletta tracked him down, and they became stranded in the desert together without water after a roadside ambush.

His life story was documented by Michael Wheeler. The entertainer L.B. Farnham approached him to become part of a Wild West Revue show in his old age, but Hex angrily refused to let them turn him into a sideshow. Hex's last bounty was a gang run by bank robber George Barrow; he succeeded in wiping them out, but Barrow returned for revenge several days later.

Farnham had Wheeler shot and the widow left unconscious to die in a house fire while he stole Hex's corpse for his Wild West Revue. Jonah Hex was taxidermized to be put on display permanently in a gaudy outfit, although the two evil men met their ends through the \\"accidental\\" discharge (at point-blank range) of Jonah's hair-trigger guns and a gang robbing the body for their own gain. Hex's body was thereafter transported from location to location. His final resting place was as a dummy at a Westworld theme park. Eventually he was discovered by historians, but Tall Bird was revealed to have survived the fire and she claimed his body. She did an interview with a young scholar to fill in the missing details in her husband's life, but they were assaulted by a Western memorabilia collector who demanded to have the corpse at any cost. The evil collector was shot in the back before he could murder them, and it is implied that Jonah Hex's vengeful spirit returned to protect his wife from beyond the grave. =Post-Mortem= Many years later, a supermodel and actress named Hex seemed to become possessed when her right eye was cut out by members of the Agenda. She assisted Superboy and displayed psionic powers when she repeatedly fired an unloaded energy weapon, but this change in consciousness seems to have been temporary.Superboy Vol 4 No. 55 Eventually she decided to become a bounty hunter like her predecessor, riding Grokk the Living Gargoyle as her trusty steed.Superboy Vol 4 No. 75 Jonah Hex was reanimated during Blackest Night as a zombie member of the Black Lantern Corps, wielding a power ring.

The young man pleaded for his life to zombie versions of Jonah Hex and Quentin Turnbull, but his ancestor gunned him down in cold blood.Weird Western Tales No. 71 Every zombie was restored to normal when Hal Jordan defeated Nekron.Blackest Night No. 8 =The New 52= During the 1880s in The New 52, Amadeus Arkham is recruited by Detective Lofton of the Gotham City Police Department to help solve the case of the Gotham Butcher. Police Chief John Cromwell did not take kindly to Arkham's theories, nor to the eventual recruitment of bounty hunter Jonah Hex, who had recently caused a stir by coming to town. Even so, recognizing Hex's street smarts, Arkham suggests that the two of them join forces in performing a separate investigation into the case. Together, they uncovered Gotham City's sect of the Religion of Crime, and its relation to the Butcher case. The solution of the Butcher case (revealed to be a conspiracy by several prominent Gotham citizens belonging to the Religion Of Crime) was simply the first of many dangerous cases. During his time in Gotham, Hex runs afoul of the Court Of Owls, Vandal Savage and Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. He also rekindles his love affair with Tallulah Black, a fellow bounty hunter. After leaving Gotham to return to the western territories, Hex encounters a semi-amnesiac Booster Gold and is accidentally thrown into the 21st century where he is initially put in Arkham Asylum, believed to be a delusional imposter who has adopted the identity of the historical Jonah Hex. After taking Dr Jeremiah Arkham hostage to escape the asylum, he convinces Jeremiah that he is indeed the same Jonah Hex who knew his great-grandfather, and after helping to take down a crazed gunman attacking a crowd of people, secures the legal assistance of Bruce Wayne to get released from custody. He also meets and forms a relationship with a young woman named Gina. After several adventures where Hex encounters, among others, John Constantine, Swamp Thing and Superman during his mission to find a way back to the past, Hex is horrified when he and Gina find his own preserved corpse in a Wild West exhibition at the Metropolis Museum. Despodent and depressed, Hex is involved in a severe DUI accident that leaves him in a coma for over a month. Upon awakening, he finds that the doctors used 21st century medical technology to repair his ruined face and eye along with his accident injuries. Discharged from the hospital, Hex and Gina encounter Booster Gold, who has arrived to send Hex back to his own time. Although Hex tries to dissuade her, Gina insists on coming with him, but dies soon after they arrive in the 19th century while they are crossing the desert without water. Alone once again, Hex buries her and moves on. Soon after, Hex once again meets Tellulah Black, and discovers that he has been missing for about a year, during which time another man with similar injuries to his own has taken on Hex's identity and has been using his notoriety to commit crimes and form his own gang. Realizing that it was this man whose preserved body he saw in the future, Hex adopts the identity of \\"George Barrow\\", the man who has been on record as Hex's killer, and kills the impostor, whose body is then stolen by a pair of carnival showmen. Hex and Tellulah ride off into the sunset together. =DC Rebirth= A robotic/alien version of Jonah Hex appears on a planet called Leone-5, modeled after the Wild West. He is introduced in the mini- series, Adventures of the Super Sons issue 9.Adventures of the Super Sons No. 9 Jonah Hex made a brief appearance in the Batman Universe series. He also is mentioned a few times by his great great granddaughter, Jinny Hex, who appears in Batman Universe and Young Justice. Powers and abilities In most of his stories, Jonah Hex displays no supernatural or superhuman powers; however, he does possess some exceptional abilities, acquired through a combination of talent and training. Despite being blind in his right eye, Hex is an outstanding marksman who rarely misses his target. He is extremely fast on the draw and can be seen in many stories gunning down multiple foes before any of them can get off a shot. He can wield two guns, one in each hand, with equal proficiency. He is also a resourceful combatant, often relying on stealth, tricks, and improvised weapons and traps to defeat enemies akin to fellow DC Comics character Deathstroke (who is also blind in his right eye). Hex was taught to shoot by the legendary gunslinger Windy Taylor. His reflexes are strong enough that he has proven to be faster on the draw than both Wild Bill Hickok and Batman.Batman: The Return of Bruce Wayne #4 Hex became an expert at driving various motor vehicles during his time in the 21st Century.Who's Who (Volume 1)#11 In the DC Universe, he is known as having almost superhuman ability and marksmanship with 19th-century weapons, mostly revolvers. After Jonah Hex is transported to the future in Hex, he acquires a pair of Ruger Blackhawk .357 Magnums. He chooses these because they are single action revolvers like the ones he used in the Wild West, but he still manages to outshoot everybody armed with more modern weaponry. Hex is an exceptional tracker, able to follow trails several days old through rain and mud in spite of his quarry's best efforts to cover their tracks. Hex often displays a keen danger sense which warns him of ambushes and traps. This is not a supernatural ability: it is simply an instinct honed through years of experience in battle and hunting dangerous foes. Hex is also extremely tough and has been known to continue fighting even after suffering torture or severe injury. Jonah Hex has a reputation throughout the West as a ruthless and prolific killer, but like Batman, he is bound by a personal code of honor to protect and avenge the innocent. On many occasions, his reputation by itself has proven enough to deter potential foes. Knowing that the infamous Jonah Hex is pursuing them often unnerves Hex's targets so badly that they make fatal mistakes, such as wasting ammunition, falling into traps, or turning and engaging Hex in a desperate stand-off. In Superman/Batman No. 16 when the timeline of the DC Universe was changed by the Legion of Super-Villains, Batman & Superman ended up being catapulted to multiple alternate timelines to restore everything back in order. In one timeline, they end up in a modern-day Gotham City in which Western-themed superheroes act as law-enforcement. During the shootout as Superman attended to Batman's wounds, Jonah Hex ambushed and manages to kill him using Kryptonite bullets. Although Superman wasn't really killed, it was heavily implied because in that story arc, the only way for Superman and Batman to be transported to another timeline is for them to die.Hex Defeats Superman Jonah Hex has, in many timelines, met and fought Batman. In Superman/Batman No. 16, Hex overpowered Batman in hand-to-hand combat (albeit Batman had been heavily wounded). In Batman: The Return of Bruce Wayne, Hex and Batman face off in a showdown. Even though being skilled in throwing batarangs and disarming gunmen, Batman was still outdrawn by Hex, and Hex shoots him in the stomach. However Batman at the time was suffering from amnesia and lacked most of his skills.Hex defeats Batman In the live-action movie, due to him being brought back from the brink of death after being hung on a cross and tortured by Quentin Turnbull, he was able to raise the dead for a few moments and force them to speak truthfully, a power he never possessed in the comics. Supporting cast Being a \\"non-superhero\\", Jonah did not have a \\"Rogues gallery\\" comparable to costumed comic-book heroes, though he had a few adversaries who returned from time to time. The first and most notable of these to date was Quentin Turnbull, known at first as simply the man with the eagle-topped cane. Turnbull was the father of Hex's best friend in the Confederate army, Jeb Turnbull. During the American Civil War, Jonah surrendered himself to the Union forces after the passage of the Emancipation Proclamation, but he refused to betray where his fellow soldiers were camped. A Union soldier was able to determine the location of that camp by examining the dirt in the hooves of Jonah's horse. The Union soldiers captured all of Jonah's fellow soldiers and then later massacred most of them; Jonah's former allies mistakingly believed him to be a turncoat. Turnbull's son was one of those slaughtered, and Turnbull vowed his vengeance upon Jonah. At one point, Turnbull hired an unnamed stage actor to impersonate Hex and help \\"destroy\\" him and his reputation. This actor, naming himself \\"the Chameleon\\", was eventually hideously scarred in a fire started by Hex, and he vowed vengeance. El Papagayo was a Mexican bandit running guns. Hex was hired by the United States Secret Service (actually a man hired by Turnbull to pose as a Secret Service agent) to infiltrate El Papagayo's band and bring him to justice. Hex was unsuccessful, and he and Papagayo met several more times over the years. Tallulah Black is a character introduced in 2007. As a young woman she was savagely raped and mutilated by the men who murdered her family. She was saved by Hex, who helped her gain vengeance. She would go on to become a bounty hunter herself and eventually Hex's lover.Goguen, Rachelle. Wednesday Interview: Jimmy Palmiotti, Living Between Wednesdays, April 1, 2009. Tallulah eventually became pregnant by Hex. However the child, a girl, was killed before being born. (Jonah Hex vol. 2, #50).

He is among the many images throughout time, space and the multiverse that can be seen by Barry, Harry and Cisco as they pass through the dimensional barrier to Earth-2. * Schaech's Hex is a recurring character on the live action CW series DC's Legends of Tomorrow. He debuted in the first season episode \\"The Magnificent Eight,\\" and returned in the season 2 episode \\"Outlaw Country\\" and season 3 episode \\"The Good, the Bad, and the Cuddly\\". This version is an old friend of Rip Hunter, who gave the Time Traveler one of his jackets. * The Earth-18 version of Hex (also portrayed by Schaech), makes a cameo appearance in \\"Crisis on Infinite Earths\\". While he initially didn't have a scar, he was seen guarding a Lazarus Pit in a North Dakota mine before getting into a fight with Sara Lance, who scars his face prior to him allowing them to use the Lazarus Pit for their own use. Animation Jonah Hex as depicted in Batman: The Animated Series * Jonah Hex appeared in the DCAU. ** In the Batman: The Animated Series episode \\"Showdown\\", voiced by William McKinney, Ra's al Ghul tells Batman the story of Jonah Hex hunting for Arkady Duvall (voiced by Malcolm McDowell), the son of Ra's al Ghul in the late 19th century. ** Jonah Hex makes an appearance in the Justice League Unlimited episode, \\"The Once and Future Thing Part 1: Weird Western Tales\\" voiced by Adam Baldwin. Jonah makes reference to his Hex-era adventures by guessing that Batman, Wonder Woman, and John Stewart are time travelers; when Batman asks why Hex thinks that, Jonah replies \\"Experience. I've had an interesting life.\\" Hex's appearance in \\"Showdown\\" took place in 1883, while in \\"The Once and Future Thing Part 1: Weird Western Tales\\", the year was 1879. The Jonah Hex of \\"Showdown\\" looked considerably older than his later appearance despite only four years difference, although this may have been the result of the corruption of the timestream. * Jonah Hex appears in the teaser of Batman: The Brave and the Bold episode \\"Return of the Fearsome Fangs\\" voiced by Phil Morris. He was caught by a western version of the Royal Flush Gang, who plan to pull him apart. Batman frees him, and they take out the gang. He gives Batman a gold coin for his efforts, telling him to get himself \\"a proper cowboy hat\\". He next appears in \\"Duel of the Double Crossers\\". In this episode, Jonah is kidnapped by Mongul to hunt down Batman for Mongul's Warworld while riding a robot horse. Jonah & Batman join forces to battle Mongul, but Mongul's time machine is destroyed and Jonah stays in the present day for now. He later rides off with Lashina riding behind him. He also appears in \\"The Siege of Starro! Part One\\". He and Cinnamon stop the Western Royal Flush Gang from robbing a bank in the flashback. Finally, he appears in a brief non-speaking cameo on a cinema screen in the episode \\"Revenge of the Reach!\\" Worthy of mention is the fact that he appears briefly in the opening sequence of the series, among other well-known heroes. * Jonah Hex appears in the Justice League Action episode \\"All Aboard the Space Train,\\" voiced by Trevor Devall. In the series, Jonah was depicted being frozen in a block of ice somewhere in the Rocky Mountains and is recovered by the Justice League. After the space train he was in was hijacked by Kanjar Ro, Space Cabbie freed Hex under Batman's orders and Cyborg's payment. The two of them managed to defeat Kanjar Ro and his minions. After landing the space train on a desert planet, Hex decided to live on it and explores the planet on a horse-like alien. =Film= Live-action * The 1994 HBO TV-movie Blind Justice is claimed to have been partially inspired by the Jonah Hex comic book character.

According to Frazier, the inspiration for the song came from reading Jimmy Palmiotti and Justin Gray's take on the character in Jonah Hex vol. 2 and his own love for Sergio Leone's Man With No Name films. The song, which features Frazier on acoustic guitar and vocals, is in narrative form and contains a verse that relates Jonah's origin story as told by Palmiotti and Gray in their three part \\"Retribution\\" storyline that ran from issues #13‚Äì15. Frazier and fellow Long Beach musician Robert Conrad performed the song live on two guitars for Jimmy Palmiotti at the Inaugural Long Beach Comic Con in 2009. Due to copyright concerns Frazier removed the song from iTunes in 2011, however an early demo version can heard on YouTube * The Texas band Ghoultown have a song titled \\"Death of Jonah Hex\\" on their \\"Tales from the Dead West\\" album. * In 2012, the French-Canadian electro-rock band Judge Rock released Westerner, a nine-minutes song about the alien abduction of Jonah Hex, Johnny Thunder, Scalphunter, Bat Lash and Nighthawk, during issue three of Crisis on Infinite Earths. The track describes Hex as \\"the rider with the gash : the bounty hunter Jonah Hex whose guns shot two-by-two\\". * In 2012, Nerdcore artist Dr. Awkward released an EP called New 52, which featured \\"By The Gun\\" a song about Jonah Hex. =Novels= Jonah Hex is one of several DC Comics western characters who appear in the novel \\"DC Universe: Trail of Time\\" by Jeff Mariotte, published by Warner Books in 2007. Lawsuit Timothy Truman In 1996, musicians Johnny and Edgar Winter filed suit against DC and the creators of the Jonah Hex: Riders of the Worm and Such limited series, claiming, amongst other things, defamation: two characters named the Autumn Brothers in the series strongly resemble the Winters. Writer Joe Lansdale said on the Comic Book Legal Defense Fund site: The judge agreed and ruled in favor of the defendants, saying parody was covered by the First Amendment. The briefs were refiled in June 2002 through the National Organization for Albinism and Hypopigmentation and while the decision was upheld, the comic was deemed not to be \\"transformative\\" raising possible future problems for parody. In 2003, the Supreme Court of California sided with DC. Reception IGN ranked Jonah Hex as the 73rd Greatest Comic Book Hero of All Time stating that \\"his distinctive appearance and engrossing adventures set Hex apart from the rest of the cowboy crowd\\".

The campaign was announced in January 1987 and drew substantial support from Queensland businessmen and some conservative politicians. The campaign succeeded in causing a split in the federal Coalition. It did not attract widespread support and collapsed in June 1987. The Australian Labor Party under Bob Hawke went on to win by an increased majority in the 1987 federal election, gaining its highest-ever number of seats. Bjelke-Petersen came under increasing scrutiny as the Fitzgerald Inquiry gained traction, and was forced out of politics altogether in December 1987. The lead-up to the campaign Bjelke-Petersen became Premier of Queensland in 1968. Although he came close to being ousted from office in 1970, he went on to become the longest-serving premier in Queensland history, and was returned to office convincingly in several elections in the early 1980s. In 1983 and 1984, he had communicated his interest in challenging what he saw as a dangerous push towards socialism within the Hawke Labor Government. Labor won power at the federal level under Bob Hawke at the 1983 election. Bjelke-Petersen and Queensland National Party president Sir Robert Sparkes spearheaded a conservative backlash against Hawke based in Queensland. The aim of this conservative movement was to \\"dismantle Labor's 'socialist' legislation, including Medicare, to support Queensland-style free enterprise and to introduce a flat-tax system\\". After the state Liberal Party walked out of the Coalition a few months before the 1983 Queensland state election (the National Party was traditionally the senior partner in the non-Labor Coalition in Queensland), Bjelke-Petersen played up fears of a Labor-Liberal coalition and led the Nationals to 41 seats in the 82-seat Legislative Assembly of Queensland‚Äîone short of a majority. He then persuaded two Liberals to cross the floor and join the Nationals, allowing them to govern in their own right for the first time. At the next election in 1986, the Nationals won an outright majority for the only time, winning a record 55% of the seats in Queensland parliament. The idea of Bjelke-Petersen becoming prime minister was first explicitly discussed with him by Gold Coast businessmen Brian Ray and Mike Gore, in autumn 1986‚Äînot long after his comprehensive state election victory. Gore would later claim that Bjelke-Petersen was reluctant to pursue a position in federal politics. However, according to Ray, Bjelke-Petersen expressed enthusiasm for the idea and had to convince Ray and Gore of its merit. The base of the \\"Joh for Canberra\\" campaign was made up of a group of Queensland businessmen nicknamed the \\"white shoe brigade\\" who had enjoyed substantial patronage from the Bjelke-Petersen government. Despite Bjelke- Petersen's insistence that his campaign was driven by popular enthusiasm, the base of support for the \\"Joh for Canberra\\" campaign was always quite narrow. In the 1984 federal election, the National Party had polled only 10.63% of the vote and won 21 seats, compared to 45 for the Liberal Party and 82 for Labor. In 1987, John Howard and Ian Sinclair were poised to lead the Liberal and National parties respectively into the 1987 election against Bob Hawke. Bjelke-Petersen believed that Howard and Sinclair had drifted too far from their conservative principles and stood no chance of defeating the Labor government in the election. After his decisive victory in the 1986 state election, Bjelke-Petersen became the \\"superstar of non-Labor politics in Australia\\", though his support was concentrated in rural areas and on the far right of the political spectrum. This momentum gave Bjelke-Petersen a feeling of invulnerability and the mistaken belief that the dynamics of Queensland politics could be replicated at a federal level. The campaign platform A \\"Joh for PM\\" bumper sticker. They were a common sight in Queensland during Bjelke-Petersen's campaign. Bjelke-Petersen's candidacy rested on his promotion of a 25% flat tax rate for all Australians irrespective of income, a proposal that drew the support of Queensland businessmen and those on the right of politics. At one point, members of the \\"white shoe brigade\\" who were sympathetic to Bjelke-Petersen pledged millions of dollars to help his campaign, though the money never materialised. Although the 25% flat tax rate was the basis of Bjelke-Petersen's campaign for prime minister, it was subsequently argued that he had \\"no idea of how such a tax would operate [and] still less of what was needed for responsible introduction\\". Bjelke-Petersen identified restricting the power of unions, reversing Aboriginal land rights decisions and promoting states' rights as other goals of his campaign. The Nationals had a limited base of support and were unlikely to become Australia's major non-Labor party. The belief that Bjelke-Petersen could have defeated Bob Hawke in the 1987 election has been called \\"one of the greatest delusions ever entertained in Australian politics\\". Ironically, before Bjelke- Petersen began his ill-fated run for the office of prime minister, Bob Hawke and Labor stood a very serious chance of losing government, deflated by the ill-fated attempt to introduce the unpopular Australia Card, the failed 'tax summit' (designed to gain support for federal treasurer Paul Keating's proposed consumption tax), and declining terms of trade. Joh for PM Bjelke-Petersen made his intention to run for prime minister explicit on 1 January 1987, generating a flurry of media activity. It was speculated that Bjelke-Petersen would run for a federal seat in Queensland, with Wide Bay and Fairfax being singled out as possibilities.Courier Mail (Brisbane) 8 January 1987, 4. The campaign identified thirteen marginal Labor seats and eight marginal Liberal seats that it believed were viable targets for Bjelke- Petersen and The Nationals.Courier Mail (Brisbane) 12 January 1987, 1. Despite generating a great deal of media coverage, the campaign drew criticism from the outset. The leader of the federal Liberal Party, John Howard, said that Bjelke-Petersen was \\"strong on incentive but short on reality\\".Courier Mail (Brisbane) 9 January 1987, 1. Melbourne's Arena magazine described Bjelke- Petersen as a \\"populist leader... without institutional backing\\" who would inevitably be defeated by the established federal parties of Labor, the Nationals and the Liberals. Prime Minister Hawke could barely contain his \\"delight\\" at the conservative infighting and welcomed a potential challenge by Bjelke-Petersen. A peculiar irony of Bjelke-Petersen's run for federal office was that his appeal had always rested on his claim to represent Queensland's interests in the face of a hostile federal political system. The pro- Queensland and anti-Commonwealth \\"Canberra bashing\\" line pursued by Joh Bjelke-Petersen was the most consistent aspect of his tenure as Queensland premier. Despite the challenges he faced, Bjelke-Petersen remained outspoken about his chances of becoming prime minister, declaring that nobody else in Australian politics possessed \\"my experience in politics, my policies for Australia, and my determination to make them work\\". Although he was outwardly confident, Bjelke-Petersen had few political allies in his campaign, even on the conservative side of politics. The most significant political figure to openly back Bjelke-Petersen's campaign was Tasmanian premier Robin Gray, who enjoyed a strong personal rapport with Bjelke-Petersen. Key Liberal Party figures like Andrew Peacock also sympathised with Bjelke-Petersen's run for office, but failed to sever their ties with the federal Coalition. Joseph Siracusa, who served as Bjelke-Petersen's national security advisor in the campaign, later claimed that Peacock and fellow Liberal powerbroker Ian McLachlan played \\"important behind the scenes roles in the affair\\". Siracusa recalled a conversation with prominent Queensland National Party minister Russ Hinze, in which Hinze claimed that Andrew Peacock had secretly backed the \\"Joh for PM\\" campaign to destabilise John Howard's leadership of the Liberal Party. According to Siracusa, Bjelke-Petersen had intended on a partnership whereby Bjelke-Petersen would become prime minister with Peacock as his deputy, though the fine details and practical considerations of this plan were never considered. Brisbane's Courier Mail threw its support behind the campaign and insisted that a Bjelke-Petersen victory was possible, while acknowledging that any such victory would depend on the ability of Bjelke-Petersen to carry at least twenty of Queensland twenty-four seats in the House of Representatives.Courier Mail (Brisbane) 10 January 1987, 1. Bjelke-Petersen held a rally in Wagga Wagga, New South Wales, on 31 January 1987, warning that the Coalition could not win government in the upcoming election and establishing himself as the \\"folksy alternative\\" to John Howard and the Liberal Party. A Newspoll recorded from 6‚Äì8 February 1987 found that 60% of voters believed a Bjelke-Petersen-Peacock ticket would be best placed to win the upcoming federal election, against only 22% in favour of Howard and Sinclair. Split from Coalition At the end of February 1987, the Queensland National Party decided to withdraw its twelve federal members of parliament from the Coalition, and demanded that federal National Party leader Ian Sinclair also withdraw because of \\"basic differences in taxation and other philosophies and policies\\" between the Liberal and National parties. Within the Queensland National Party, the party president Sir Robert Sparkes enforced support for Bjelke-Petersen, making practical opposition within the Queensland ranks unlikely. However, tensions persisted even amongst Bjelke-Petersen's closest followers. Although Sparkes had agreed to run the campaign, now known as \\"Joh for PM\\", he took the post only reluctantly and had tried to dissuade Bjelke-Petersen from running for federal office. Privately, Bjelke-Petersen and Sparkes had come to detest one another, with \\"their hatred for each other overwhelming the courtly setting and polite manners\\". Bjelke-Petersen would later claim that Sparkes was responsible for the subsequent failure of the \\"Joh for PM\\" campaign. The formal notice approving Bjelke-Petersen's run for the prime ministership was passed by a Queensland National Party Central Council in February 1987. It read: : That the National Party of Australia (Qld) fully supports the move by Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen to attain the Prime Ministership so that he can put in place an anti-socialist federal government equipped with appropriate policies and the will to implement those policies.... Despite their success in the Queensland branch, Bjelke-Petersen and his newly independent Nationals faction received a humiliating setback in the Northern Territory election on 2 March, with the National Party failing to achieve much success despite Bjelke-Petersen's patronage and the Country Liberals continuing to dominate the territory. On 10 April, the Queensland MPs withdrew from the Coalition, leaving them in \\"the ridiculous position of being half in and half out of the federal National Party\\".Sydney Morning Herald (Sydney) 11 April 1987, 1. The perceived obstinacy of the Queensland National Party drew the ire of many senior Coalition members. Ian Sinclair refused to join Bjelke-Petersen's campaign and attempted to preserve the federal Coalition. On 29 April, as Hawke continued to capitalise on the Coalition's disunity, John Howard slammed the \\"real wreckers... Bjelke-Petersen and Sparkes, and the unilateral action of the Queensland branch [of the National Party] which set itself on a course of destruction with the Coalition\\".Canberra Times, 29 July 1987. Although Howard was publicly critical of the \\"Joh for PM\\" campaign, it has been alleged that he was actually desperate to appease Bjelke-Petersen, at one point flying to Queensland to seek a compromise agreement. The Coalition split in early May, with Ian Sinclair looking increasingly impotent and unable to ensure the loyalty of National Party members. At this point, Bob Sparkes reneged on his loyalty to Bjelke-Petersen and withdrew from the campaign. With his pool of supporters steadily decreasing, an effective challenge to the federal Coalition from Bjelke-Petersen began to look more and more unlikely. Media Newspapers owned by Rupert Murdoch, particularly The Australian, offered enthusiastic early support for the \\"Joh for Canberra\\" and \\"Joh for PM\\" campaigns. The Australian was edited by the pro Bjelke-Petersen editor Lee Hollings and vigorously advocated for Bjelke-Petersen's campaign, providing it with \\"much- needed momentum\\" in early January 1987. The stance taken by Murdoch, combined with sympathetic coverage in the Courier Mail, meant that the campaign received a great deal of positive media attention. Some commentators have argued that The Australian did much to contribute to the defeat of the conservatives in the 1987 federal election. Liberal politician Ian Macphee has argued that the promotion of the \\"Joh for Canberra\\" and \\"Joh for PM\\" campaigns in The Australian was a case of the paper going \\"out of its way to fan the flames of disunity\\", contributing to the Hawke government's eventual victory. Local dissent against the Bjelke-Petersen media narrative came from smaller publications. The University of Queensland's Semper Floreat and the independent magazine The Cane Toad Times provided authentic voices of Queensland opposition to Joh Bjelke-Petersen's campaign. The Cane Toad Times only addressed the campaign in reference to the Fitzgerald Inquiry that ousted Bjelke-Petersen in late 1987, stating that issues like the \\"Joh for Canberra\\" campaign, as with the Bjelke-Petersen government's aggressive support of the Springboks rugby tour of 1971 and the industrial disputes of 1984, had served to \\"keep the spotlight off the only real problem the National Party government had in Queensland [which was] corruption\\".Cane Toad Times, \\"Fear and Clothing Issue\\" (Brisbane), Issue 9, Summer 1988, 4. Semper Floreat was a persistent critic of the \\"Joh for Canberra\\" campaign. In its regular column \\"Letters from Kingaroy\\", the publication repeatedly mocked Bjelke-Petersen and his attempt to be elected to federal office. What both Semper Floreat and The Cane Toad Times shared was a view of Bjelke-Petersen as a repressive and autocratic figure trying to replicate a tradition of misgovernment on the federal stage. The Cane Toad Times satirically referred to Queensland as a \\"new Reich\\", while Semper claimed that \\"a lot of Queensland journalists have a sense of futility because of the immense control Joh Bjelke-Petersen holds in this state\\".Semper Floreat (Brisbane) Issue 7, September 1987, 7. In Brisbane, the media had a degree of diversity that was largely absent from the rest of the state. Brisbane was also the area of Queensland where Bjelke-Petersen enjoyed the least amount of support. Outside the cosmopolitan south-east of Queensland, Bjelke-Petersen and the Nationals \\"benefited from a less diverse and competitive mass media\\", which helped to ensure their continuing electoral success. End of campaign A political cartoon compares Bjelke-Petersen to Napoleon in his march on Moscow. For all its fanfare, the \\"Joh for Canberra\\" campaign ended with a whimper rather than a bang. In May 1987, the expectations of Bjelke-Petersen's campaign were revised downwards to promoting Senate candidates like John Stone, who ran under the New Nationals banner, and the slogan \\"Joh for PM\\" was scrapped in favour of \\"Joh for Canberra\\", When prime minister Bob Hawke called a double dissolution election on 27 May 1987, Bjelke-Petersen was in the United States, visiting Disneyland, and had not yet nominated for a federal seat. His supporters at home rushed to find candidates for a pro-Bjelke-Petersen party, but were largely unsuccessful. Despite the media furore created by the campaign, Bjelke-Petersen's bid for federal government lacked a \\"solid organisational basis and significant nationwide support\\". The bid collapsed and Bjelke-Petersen withdrew from his attempt to win a seat in federal parliament. Nonetheless, the effects of Bjelke- Petersen's grab for power were felt nationwide. With the National Party fractured, different campaigns, including \\"the Joh campaign, the Sinclair campaign [and] independent Joh campaigns\\" all ran simultaneously, leading to confusion and consternation among voters. In the federal election, Labor performed exceptionally well in Queensland, gaining four seats to bring their Queensland tally to 13 of 24 seats. Although Bjelke-Petersen had withdrawn from the nationwide contest, the National Party still ran against the Liberals in many seats, and ran independent Senate tickets in every state except New South Wales. The federal National Party suffered a net loss of two seats, failing to expand upon its traditional rural base and hampered by disunity within its ranks. In addition to a large number of three-cornered contests, many of the practices that had worked so well for Bjelke-Petersen over the last 19 years backfired on him. Many swing voters outside of Queensland, alarmed at the prospect of Bjelke-Petersen holding the balance of power, opted to vote Labor in order to ensure that the Coalition would be defeated. Queensland ALP secretary Peter Beattie remarked that \\"we couldn't have done it without Joh\\". However, Bjelke-Petersen remained unrepentant. In an interview recorded in the aftermath of the election loss, Bjelke-Petersen insisted that he did not bear any of the blame for the result, and that the only thing he had to apologise for was withdrawing from the contest.Joh Bjelke-Petersen, Audio commentary on the election result, 11 July, http://australianpolitics.com/voting/elections/1987-federal. He would later try to shift the blame to Robert Sparkes' attitude to the campaign, saying that \\"if Sparkes hadn't gummed it up, then it would've worked\\". Nonetheless, Sparkes' profile continued to grow in Queensland, and he was comfortably re- elected as head of the Queensland National Party in late 1987. Bjelke-Petersen went on to state that his internal polling suggested that, had he remained in the race, he would have been very competitive. Bjelke-Petersen always remained unapologetic about his bid for federal leadership, repeatedly characterising it in his memoir as the \\"Joh Crusade,\\" and insisting that he \\"did not want to be prime minister.... I only wanted to go to Canberra to clean up a mess and put government there back on the right path\\". Bjelke-Petersen's downfall As it turned out, the \\"Joh for Canberra\\" campaign was the last hurrah for Bjelke-Petersen and the Queensland Nationals. The campaign unnerved many even with the Queensland National Party, with Bjelke-Petersen's actions \\"perceived by many senior people without his party [as those] of a person who was convinced he was greater than his party\\". The Fitzgerald Inquiry into corruption in Queensland began on 26 May 1987 and quickly implicated several high-ranking members of the National Party. The charges moved steadily up the ranks of the National Party and soon came to implicate Bjelke-Petersen, who was accused of systemic corruption and, later, narrowly avoided a conviction for perjury. Bjelke-Petersen's attempts to maintain his stranglehold on the National Party came to nothing, with senior ministers soon manoeuvring to remove him from office. On 27 November, the culmination of the revolt saw the deposing of Bjelke-Petersen as National Party leader in favour of Mike Ahern. Bjelke-Petersen tried to stay on as premier for four more days before announcing his resignation on 1 December. A Morgan Gallup poll released three days later put Bjelke-Petersen's approval rating at a record low of 22%.The Bulletin (Sydney) Morgan Gallup Poll No. 1663, December 1987. In less than a year, he had gone from the apex of his political success to ruin‚Äîa surprisingly rapid decline given his long dominance of Queensland politics. The Queensland Nationals never recovered from the revelations of rampant corruption in the Bjelke-Petersen government, and were resoundingly defeated by the ALP in the 1989 state election, suffering the worst defeat of a sitting government in Queensland history up to that time. The appeal of Sir Joh Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen successfully cultivated an image as a hard-working, Queensland 'everyman'. Many commentators have written about Sir Joh Bjelke- Petersen and the \\"Joh for Canberra\\" campaign in scathing terms. Historian Raymond Evans has claimed that it was waged \\"somewhat like Napoleon's ill- fated march on Moscow\\" while Rae Wear has likened Bjelke-Petersen to Mao Zedong. Much has been made of the sense of grandeur and self-delusion that seemed to pervade Bjelke-Petersen's attempt to run for federal office, and the role that Bjelke-Petersen's personality played in shaping the campaign. Rae Wear has cited the \\"Joh for Canberra\\" campaign as an example of \\"the old-age immortality project, whereby narcissistic and self-made politicians defy death by erecting lasting monuments to themselves\\".Rae Wear, \\"Johannes Bjelke- Petersen,\\" 186. At the time of the campaign, Bjelke-Petersen was 75 and was eager to make a permanent mark on Australian politics before his retirement from public life. Journalist Paul Kelly concurs that hubris was an important factor in Bjelke-Petersen's campaign. He quotes Bjelke-Petersen as saying \\"even if [the Nationals] don't win more seats than the Liberals I'll be prime minister\\", a statement that appears to confirm Bjelke-Petersen's self-delusion and ignorance of political realities. The widespread popularity that Bjelke- Petersen enjoyed in Queensland could not be transposed to the political atmosphere of federal politics. While many historians have been damning about Joh Bjelke-Petersen and his legacy, they have also acknowledged the appeal he held in his home state. Bjelke-Petersen's popularity essentially rested on a belief in Queensland exceptionalism. As premier, Bjelke-Petersen cultivated his identification with the \\"ordinary, decent Queenslander and traded on small business and rural fears of rapid social change\\". Queensland premiers have often gained support by emphasising \\"rural agrarianism and mobilisation of the 'common people' against a vilifed elite,\\" a tactic that Bjelke-Petersen mastered in his nineteen years as premier. In Queensland, Bjelke-Petersen had successfully built a coalition of religious conservatives, rural voters and business interests that could be relied upon for support. However, during the \\"Joh for Canberra\\" push, Bjelke-Petersen found that his appeal did not extend nationwide and that the dynamics of Queensland politics did not apply to the nation as a whole.

The reader typically chooses links to move from one node of text to the next, and in this fashion arranges a story from a deeper pool of potential stories. Its spirit can also be seen in interactive fiction. The term can also be used to describe traditionally-published books in which a nonlinear narrative and interactive narrative is achieved through internal references. James Joyce's Ulysses (1922), Enrique Jardiel Poncela's La Tourn√©e de Dios (1932), Jorge Luis Borges' The Garden of Forking Paths (1941), Vladimir Nabokov's Pale Fire (1962), Julio Cort√°zar's Rayuela (1963; translated as Hopscotch), and Italo Calvino's The Castle of Crossed Destinies (1973) are early examples predating the word \\"hypertext\\", while a common pop- culture example is the Choose Your Own Adventure series in young adult fiction and other similar gamebooks. The Garden of Forking Paths (1941) is both a hypertext story and is sometimes used as a description of having different possible paths.  Definitions  There is little consensus on the definition of hypertext literature. The similar term cybertext is often used interchangeably with hypertext.Aarseth, Espen.1997. ergodic Literature. Baltimore, Maryland: The Johns Hopkins University Press. http://www.hf.uib.no/cybertext/Ergodic.html In hypertext fiction, the reader assumes a significant role in the creation of the narrative. Each user obtains a different outcome based on the choices they make. Cybertexts may be equated to the transition between a linear piece of literature, such as a novel, and a game. In a novel the reader has no choice, the plot and the characters are all chosen by the author, there is no 'user,' just a 'reader,' this is important because it entails that the person working their way through the novel is not an active participant. In a game, the person makes decisions and decides what actions to take, what punches to punch, or when to jump. To Espen Aarseth, cybertext is not a genre in itself; in order to classify traditions, literary genres and aesthetic value, texts should be examined at a more local level.Bolter, Jay David, Degrees of Freedom, retrieved from http://www.uv.es/~fores/programa/bolter_freedom.html To Aarseth, hypertext fiction is a kind of ergodic literature: > In ergodic literature, nontrivial effort is required to allow the reader to > traverse the text. If ergodic literature is to make sense as a concept, > there must also be nonergodic literature, where the effort to traverse the > text is trivial, with no extranoematic responsibilities placed on the reader > except (for example) eye movement and the periodic or arbitrary turning of > pages. To Aarseth, the process of reading immersive narrative, in contrast, involves \\"trivial\\" effort, that is, merely moving one's eyes along lines of text and turning pages; the text does not resist the reader.  History  The first hypertext fictions were published prior to the development of the World Wide Web, using software such as Storyspace and HyperCard. Noted pioneers in the field are Judy Malloy and Michael Joyce. Douglas Cooper's Delirium (1994) was the first novel serialized on the World Wide Web; it permitted navigation between four parallel story strands. On June 21, 1996, Bobby Rabyd (aka Robert Arellano) published the World Wide Web's first interactive novel,Ciccarello, Lisa. \\"Swiveling My Hips through the Interbunk (And Having a Great Time, Too)\\". Pif Magazine: January, 2000. Sunshine 69, with navigable maps of settings, a nonlinear calendar of scenes, and a character \\"suitcase\\" enabling readers to try on nine different points of view. Shortly thereafter, in 1997, Mark Amerika released GRAMMATRON, a multi-linear work that was eventually exhibited in art galleries. In 2000, it was included in the Whitney Biennial of American Art.Artists Selected for the 2000 Whitney Biennial In the 1990s, women and feminist artists took advantage of hypertext and produced dozens of works. Linda Dement‚Äôs Cyberflesh Girlmonster a hypertext CD-ROM that incorporates images of women‚Äôs body parts and remixes them to create new shapes. Dr. Caitlin Fisher‚Äôs hypertext novella ‚Äú‚ÄòThese Waves of Girls‚Äú is set in three time periods of the protagonist exploring polymorphous perversity enacted in her queer identity through memory. The story is written as a reflection diary of the interconnected memories of childhood, adolescence, and adulthood. It consists of an associated multi-modal collection of nodes includes linked text, still and moving images, manipulable images, animations, and sound clips.

The internationally oriented, but US based, Electronic Literature Organization (ELO) was founded in 1999 to promote the creation and enjoyment of electronic literature. Other organisations for the promotion of electronic literature include trAce Online Writing Community, a British organisation, started in 1995, that has fostered electronic literature in the UK, Dichtung Digital, a journal of criticism of electronic literature in English and German, and ELINOR, a network for electronic literature in the Nordic countries, which provides a directory of Nordic electronic literature. The Electronic Literature Directory lists many works of electronic literature in English and other languages.  Characteristics  Hypertext fiction is characterized by networked nodes of text making up a fictional story. There are often several options in each node that directs where the reader can go next. Unlike traditional fiction, the reader is not constrained by reading the fiction from start to end, depending on the choices they make. In this sense, it is similar to an encyclopaedia, with the reader reading a node and then choosing a link to follow. While this can be done more easily on paper, it is quite a different experience on a screen. The reader can be thrown into unpredictable loops because not all of the links are explained by their title. The fiction can contain text, quotes, and images. There are different forms that hypertext fiction can take. These forms are axial, arborescent, and networked. Axial hypertext fictions have a central story line with links that branch off and return to the central storyline. Arborescent fictions branch into mutually exclusive story lines, and networked fictions have multiple starting points and do not always have a set ending. A single work of hypertext fiction can have a mixture of these three forms.  Criticism  In 2013, Wired published an article to describe why hypertext fiction did not become popular; it was because the non-linear stories are difficult to write, since each section of the work would need to introduce characters or concepts.Why No One Clicked on the Great Hypertext Story March 16, 2013 However, hypertext is widely used to tell linear stories on the Internet by using hypertext links to other articles or arguments that are written by different people.

Like other nuthatches, it feeds on insects in the bark of trees, foraging on the trunks and branches and their strongly clawed toes allow them to climb down tree trunks or move on the undersides of horizontal branches. They are found in forests with good tree cover and are often found along with other species in mixed-species foraging flocks. Adult males can be told apart by the black stripe that runs behind and above the eyes. They have a rapid chipping call note. They breed in tree cavities and holes, often created by woodpeckers or barbets.  Description  The velvet-fronted nuthatch has the typical nuthatch shape, short tail and powerful bill and feet. It is 12.5 cm long. It is violet-blue above, with lavender cheeks, beige underparts, yellow eyes, and a whitish throat. The iris is distinctly pale and yellow. The bill is red, and there is a black patch on the forehead and lores which is well developed in adults and less so in younger birds. Young birds have a dark beak and dark tips to the undertail coverts. Adult males can be told apart by the black superciliary stripe that runs above the eye and over the head, towards the nape. Females lack the supercilium and have a warmer underpart colour. Juveniles are duller versions of the adult lacking the black frontal band. There populations differ in shade and size and the distribution of white on the throat.  Taxonomy and systematics  Swainson's 1820 illustration Velvet-fronted nuthatches are closely related to Sitta solangiae, Sitta azurea and Sitta oenochlamys and some authors have placed them in a separate genus Oenositta (proposed by H.E. Wolters in 1979) which would be inappropriate as the clade, although distinct in morphology, is nested within other Sitta species. The complex includes numerous forms which have had a confusing history, for instance oenochlamys has been treated as a subspecies of frontalis in the past. The species was first described validly by Swainson who also created the genus Dendrophila in which he initially placed the species. Hodgson had however used the name Dendrophila for a species of partridge. Swainson used the species name given by Horsfield who had named the bird as Orthorynchus frontalis but Horsfield published only in 1821 giving priority to Swainson as the author. About five populations are widely recognized as subspecies but some may be treated as phylogenetic species: *S. f. frontalis - the nominate form is from the hill forests of southern India, they occur in the Western Ghats, the Eastern Ghats, the central Indian forests and in Sri Lanka. The population along the Himalayas is also included in this although the name corallina might be more appropriate for this population with individuals being slightly smaller (contrary to Bergmann's rule). The name simplex proposed by Koelz in 1939 for birds from the south of Bombay is considered as a synonym. The Himalayan population extends from Uttarakhand east to Bangladesh and into Thailand, Myanmar, the Isthmus of Kra and possibly into Hong Kong where it may be an introduced species. The name chienfengensis was proposed by Tso-Hsin Cheng, 1964 for the birds of Hainan, China. *S. f. saturatior ‚Äì this is distributed in the Malay Peninsula south of the Isthmus of Kra which includes Penang, Singapore, the, Lingga Archipelago and Sumatra. *S. f. corallipes ‚Äì is found in Borneo extending into the Maratua Island *S. f. palawana ‚Äì Palawan and Balabac in the western Philippines. *S. f. velata ‚Äì Java. The use of ectoparasites such as Brueelia as a proxy to unravel the phylogeny of the species is unreliable as the nuthatch shares the same Brueelia species with flycatchers (Rhipidura and Ficedula), possibly because these parasites are phoretic, travelling across hosts via blowflies.  Habitat and ecology  A female S. f. frontalis with insect prey (Coorg) The velvet-fronted nuthatch is a resident breeder of all types of forests from deciduous to evergreen forest. In the Sunderbans, they are found in Sonneratia mangrove forests. They also live within secondary forest and make use of the shade trees in south Indian coffee plantations. Like other nuthatches they have strongly curved claws that allow them to climb down vertical tree trunks, unlike species such as woodpeckers that only work their way upwards. It moves jerkily up and down or around tree branches and trunks. It is an active feeder on insects and spiders, gleaned on the bark of the trunk and branches, and may be found in mixed feeding flocks with other passerines. The insects they disturb are sometimes taken by the racket-tailed drongo in Sri Lanka. This is a noisy bird, often located by its repeated ‚Äúsit-sit-sit‚Äù call. Adults go through a complete postnuptial moult that begins at the end of June in northern India. Plasmodium parasites including Haemoproteus have been detected in their blood. Feather mites of the genus Neodectes are found on the species. Breeding Nests are in tree holes or crevices, lined with moss, fur and feathers, or grass. The breeding season on northern India is in summer, April to June and January to May in southern India and Sri Lanka. Unlike other nuthatches, it is said not to employ mud to narrow the entrance of the hole. Three to six eggs are laid, white speckled with red. The female spends more time incubating but both take turns in feeding the young.  In culture  Being a small forest bird, only a few forest-dwelling tribes are aware of the species. The Lotha Naga people will hunt many birds for food but the velvet-fronted nuthatch is generally proscribed due to the belief that killing them would bring misfortune to the hunter. The birds forage in flocks and members are believed to stay on nearby if one is killed, and according to the Lothas, they will wait to be killed and the hunter would soon see people around him die in quick succession one after another. The Soliga people call it the maratotta or \\"tree hopper\\".

He also authored more than a dozen books, including a biography of Che Guevara, and he regularly contributes to newspapers such as Reforma (Mexico), El Pa√≠s (Spain), Los Angeles Times (USA) and Newsweek magazine.  Early life and education  Casta√±eda was born in Mexico City. His father was Jorge Casta√±eda y √Ålvarez de la Rosa who served as Secretary of Foreign Affairs (1979‚Äì1982), during the administration of Jos√© L√≥pez Portillo. He received the French Baccalaur√©at from the Lyc√©e Franco-Mexicain in Mexico City. He graduated with an A.B. in history from Princeton University in 1973 after completing a 241-page long senior thesis titled \\"The Movement of the Revolutionary Left in Chile: 1965-1972.\\" Then after receiving his Ph.D. in Economic History from the University of Paris (Panth√©on-La Sorbonne) he worked as a professor at several universities, including the National Autonomous University of Mexico, the University of California, Berkeley, Princeton University, New York University, and the University of Cambridge. He was a Bernard Schwartz fellow at The New America Foundation. He was married to Miriam Morales (a Chilean citizen) and he has one son, Jorge Andr√©s.  Academic books  Among his books is Utopia Unarmed: The Latin American Left After the Cold War (Vintage Books, 1993), an assessment of leftist politics in Latin America. The book has had a wide readership for its sometimes controversial overview of left-leaning politics in the region post-1990. Its main theme is a shift from politics based on the Cuban Revolution to politics based on broad-based new social movements, from armed revolutions to elections. Another of Casta√±eda's well-known works is Compa√±ero: The Life and Death of Che Guevara, which analyzes the Argentine Marxist revolutionary.  Political career  Casta√±eda's political career began as a member of the Mexican Communist Party but he has since moved to the political center. He served as an advisor to Cuauht√©moc C√°rdenas during his (failed) presidential campaign in 1988 and advised Vicente Fox during his (successful) presidential campaign in 2000. After winning the election, Fox appointed Casta√±eda as his Secretary of Foreign Affairs. Following a number of disagreements with other cabinet members Casta√±eda left the post in January 2003 and began traveling around the country, giving lectures and promoting his ideas. In July 2003, United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan appointed him to the United Nations Commission on the Private Sector and Development, which was co-chaired by Prime Minister Paul Martin of Canada and former President Ernesto Zedillo of Mexico.Felicity Barringer (July 27, 2003), U.N. Will Back Entrepreneurs In Bid to Lift Poor Nations New York Times. =Presidential candidacy= On March 25, 2004, Casta√±eda officially announced his presidential campaign by means of a prime-time campaign advertisement carried in all major Mexican television stations. He presented himself as an independent \\"citizens' candidate\\", a move contrary to Mexico's electoral law that gives registered parties alone the right to nominate candidates for election. In 2004, Casta√±eda started to seek Court authorization to run in the country's 2006 presidential election without the endorsement of any of the registered political parties. In August 2005 the Supreme Court ruled against Casta√±eda's appeal. The ruling essentially put an end to Casta√±eda's bid to run as an independent candidate; however, soon after this ruling he took his case to the Inter-American Court of Human Rights in order to defend his political rights; as of 2008, the case is pending before the IACHR. =Later career= In 2014, UN Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon appointed Casta√±eda as co- chair of a commission of inquiry to investigate human rights abuses in the Central African Republic, alongside Fatimata M'Baye and Bernard Acho Muna; within two months, however, Casta√±eda resigned from the position.Michelle Nichols (January 23, 2014), Central African Republic children forced to commit atrocities: U.N. Reuters.  Articles  He has published articles in Newsweek.

Footage of him crashing featured on ABC's Wide World of Sports represented the Agony of Defeat.. Retrieved on 2011-04-11. Agony of Defeat jump Bogataj competed as a Yugoslav entrant at the ski flying event in Oberstdorf, West Germany on 7 March 1970. A light snow had begun falling at the start of the competition, and by the time Bogataj was ready for his third jump on the Heini Klopfer hill, the snow had become quite heavy. Midway down the inrun for his jump, Bogataj realised that the conditions had made the ramp too fast. He attempted to lower his center of gravity and stop his jump, but instead lost his balance completely and rocketed out of control off the end of the inrun, tumbling and flipping wildly, and crashing through a light retaining fence near a crowd of spectators before coming to a halt. Bogataj suffered a mild concussion and a broken ankle. A film crew from Wide World of Sports was recording the event in which Bogataj crashed. The show featured an opening narration by host Jim McKay over a montage of sports clips, and co-ordinating producer Dennis Lewin inserted the footage of the crash to coincide with the words \\"...and the agony of defeat.\\" Throughout the show's long history, various images were used for the other parts of the narration, including for \\"the thrill of victory...\\", which directly preceded the above phrase and was often accompanied by images of the celebrating team at the most recent Super Bowl or World Cup, but after that point, the \\"agony of defeat\\" was always illustrated by Bogataj's failed jump. Later on, other clips were added to the \\"agony of defeat\\", but Bogataj's crash was always featured and always the first played. The melodrama of the narration‚Äîwhich became a catchphrase in the US‚Äîtransformed the uncredited ski jumper into an American icon of bad luck and misfortune. Meanwhile, having retired to his quiet, private life in Slovenia, Bogataj was unaware of his celebrity, and so was surprised to be asked to attend the 20th anniversary celebration for Wide World of Sports in 1981. He received the loudest ovation of any athlete introduced at the gala, and attendees such as Muhammad Ali asked him for his autograph. Later life Bogataj returned to ski jumping in 1971 but never duplicated the success he had before the crash and retired from the sport competitively, save for occasional senior competitions thereafter. During his career, his best career finish was 57th in the individual normal hill competition in Bischofshofen in 1969 during that year's Four Hills Tournament. Bogataj became a ski instructor, coaching the 1991 World Champion Slovenian ski jumper Franci Petek. He supplements his income by painting and has also worked as a forklift operator at a factory, Veriga Lesce. His paintings have won awards and been exhibited in both Europe and the U.S. He also enjoys wood carving. Bogataj resides in his hometown of Lesce, Slovenia. He is married and has two daughters.

It uses woodpecker or barbet holes for nesting, and will also excavate its own hole or use man-made sites. The Himalayan black-lored tit was formerly one of the many species in the genus Parus but was moved to Machlolophus after a molecular phylogenetic analysis published in 2013 showed that the members of the new genus formed a distinct clade.

He was elected an IEEE Fellow in 1968, a member of the National Academy of Engineering (NAE) in 1979, a member of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) in 1992, a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (AAAS) in 1999. He received the Claude E. Shannon Award from the IEEE Information Theory Society in 1983. He also received the IEEE Centennial Medal in 1984, the IEEE Medal of Honor in 1990 \\"For fundamental contributions to communications coding techniques\\", the Marconi Prize in 2003, and a Dijkstra Prize in 2004, among other honors. For most of his career he was a professor of electrical engineering and computer science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Biography Gallager received the B.S.E.E. degree from the University of Pennsylvania in 1953. He was a member of the technical staff at the Bell Telephone Laboratories in 1953‚Äì1954 and then served in the U.S. Signal Corps 1954‚Äì1956. He returned to graduate school at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), and received the S.M. degree in 1957 and Sc.D. in 1960 in electrical engineering. He has been a faculty member at MIT since 1960 where he was co-director of the Laboratory for Information and Decision Systems from 1986 to 1998, was named Fujitsu Professor in 1988, and became Professor Emeritus in 2001. He was a visiting associate professor at the University of California, Berkeley, in 1965 and a visiting professor at the √âcole Nationale Sup√©rieure des T√©l√©communications, Paris, in 1978. Gallager's 1960 Sc.D. thesis, on low-density parity-check codes, was published by the MIT Press as a monograph in 1963. The codes, which remained useful over 50 years, are sometimes called \\"Gallager codes\\". An abbreviated version appeared in January 1962 in the IRE Transactions on Information Theory and was republished in the 1974 IEEE Press volume, Key Papers in The Development of Information Theory, edited by Elwyn Berlekamp. This paper won an IEEE Information Theory Society Golden-Jubilee Paper Award in 1998 and its subject matter is a very active area of research today. Gallager's January 1965 paper in the IEEE Transactions on Information Theory, \\"A Simple Derivation of the Coding Theorem and some Applications\\", won the 1966 IEEE W.R.G. Baker Award \\"for the most outstanding paper, reporting original work, in the Transactions, Journals and Magazines of the IEEE Societies, or in the Proceedings of the IEEE\\" and also won another IEEE Information Theory Society Golden-Jubilee Paper Award in 1998. His book, Information Theory and Reliable Communication, Wiley 1968, placed Information Theory on a sound mathematical foundation and is still considered by many as the standard textbook on information theory. Gallager consulted for Melpar as a graduate student, and for Codex Corporation when since was founded in 1962. He served Codex as acting vice president for research in 1971‚Äì1972. His work (along with fellow-MIT faculty member Dave Forney) on quadrature amplitude modulation led to the 9600 bit/s modems that provided Codex's commercial success. He has also consulted for the MIT Lincoln Laboratory and a number of other companies. He has been granted five patents on his inventions. In the mid-1970s, Gallager's research focus shifted to data networks, focusing on distributed algorithms, routing, congestion control, and random access techniques. Data Networks, Prentice Hall, published in 1988, with second edition 1992, co-authored with Dimitri Bertsekas, helped provide a conceptual foundation for this field. In the 1990s, Gallager's interests shifted back to information theory and to stochastic processes. He wrote the 1996 textbook, Discrete Stochastic Processes. Gallager's current interests are in information theory, wireless communication, all optical networks, data networks, and stochastic processes. Over the years, Gallager has taught and mentored many graduate students, many of whom are now themselves leading researchers in their fields. He received the MIT Graduate Student Council Teaching Award for 1993. In 1999 he received the Harvey Prize from the American Society for the Technion ‚Äì Israel Institute of Technology. In 2020 he was awarded the Japan Prize.Japan Prize 2020 Gallager's textbook, Principles of Digital Communication was published by Cambridge University Press in 2008. Gallager was President of the IEEE Information Theory Society in 1971, a member of its board of governors from 1965 to 1972 and again from 1979 to 1988. He served the IEEE Transactions on Information Theory as associate editor for coding 1963‚Äì1964 and as associate editor for computer communications from 1977 to 1980. He was chairman of the advisory committee to the National Science Foundation Division on Networking and Communication Research and Infrastructure from 1989 to 1992, and has been on numerous visiting committees for electrical engineering and computer science departments. Personal life Gallager has 3 children, 4 stepchildren, 7 grandchildren, 10 step grandchildren and 2 great step children. He is married to Marie Gallager.

The most recent of the companies to own rights to the Blue Beetle is DC Comics who bought the rights to the character in 1983, using the name for three distinct characters over the years. The original Blue Beetle was created by Fox Comics and later owned by Charlton Comics. The first Beetle was Dan Garret (later spelled Dan Garrett), who initially gained super powers from a special vitamin, which was later changed to gaining powers from a \\"sacred scarab\\". The original Blue Beetle was featured not only in his own comic but also a weekly radio serial. The second Blue Beetle was created by Charlton and later taken over by DC Comics, the successor to Dan Garrett known as Ted Kord. Kord \\"jumped\\" to the DC Comics universe during the Crisis on Infinite Earths alongside a number of other Charlton Comics characters. The second Blue Beetle later starred in his own 24 issue comic. Kord never had any super powers but used science to create various devices to help him fight crime. He became a member of the Justice League of America and was later killed during DC Comics' Infinite Crisis cross over. The third Blue Beetle, created by DC Comics, is Jaime Reyes, a teenager who discovered that the original Blue Beetle scarab morphed into a battle suit allowing him to fight crime and travel in space. Over the years Reyes became a member of the Teen Titans and starred in two Blue Beetle comic series. In DC Comics' 2011 \\"New 52\\" reboot, Jaime Reyes was the primary Blue Beetle character, only occasionally referring to past versions. However, with the subsequent continuity revision \\"DC Rebirth\\", the previous versions were restored. Publication history The original Blue Beetle, Dan Garret, first appeared in Fox Comics' Mystery Men Comics #1 (cover-dated August 1939), with art by Charles Nicholas Wojtkoski (as Charles Nicholas); though the Grand Comics Database tentatively credits Will Eisner as the scripter.Wojtkoski's family has supplied the online comics encyclopedia \\"The Lambiek Comiclopedia\\" with documentation to support the overall Wojtkoski credit. Another artist, Charles Nicholas Cuidera, also drew Blue YEEtle stories later, and has claimed to have been the creator, but comics historians credit Wojtkoski. * * A rookie police officer, he wore a special bulletproof costume and took \\"Vitamin 2X\\" which endowed him with super-energy, and he was assisted by a neighborhood pharmacist in his fight against crime. Blue Beetle starred in a comic book series, comic strip and radio serial, but like most Golden Age superheroes, he fell into obscurity in the 1950s. The comic book series saw a number of anomalies in publication: 19 issues, #12 through #30, were published through Holyoke Publishing; no issue #43 was published; publication frequency varied throughout the run; and there were gaps where issues were not published, with large ones occurring in early 1947 and between mid-1948 and early 1950. In the mid-1950s, Fox Comics went out of business and sold the rights to the Blue Beetle to Charlton Comics. That company published a few sporadic adventures of the Golden Age character before revamping the hero in 1964.The two initial Charlton runs were: * * Charlton tried three times to use the character to carry a self-titled series. Two of the attempts retained the numbering of a previous title. These also were eventually replaced with new titles that carried on the numbering. The new series was short-lived, and in the pages of Captain Atom #83 (cover-dated November 1966) through #86, Charlton introduced Ted Kord, a student of Dan Garrett's (note the changed spelling) who took on the role when Garrett died. Kord was an inventor hero, using a variety of gadgets. This Beetle received his own series in 1967, but the entire Charlton \\"Action Heroes\\" line of comic books ceased publication in 1968. With the rest of the Charlton line-up, he was sold to DC Comics in 1983 and appeared with several incarnations of the Justice League. In 2006, DC introduced a new Blue Beetle, teenager Jaime Reyes, whose powers are derived from the scarab, now revealed as a piece of advanced alien technology. The series was initially written by Keith Giffen and John Rogers, with artist Cully Hamner. \\"Cully Hamner talks about the BLUE BEETLE\\" by Rik Offenberger, First Comics News, December 7, 2005 Giffen left in issue #10 and Rogers took over full writing duties, joined by a new artist, Rafael Albuquerque. Rogers left the title with issue #25 in order to concentrate on his television series Leverage. After three fill-in issues, Matt Sturges became the main writer in issue #29, but the series was cancelled with issue #36. Editor Dan DiDio put the cancellation down to poor sales and said that Blue Beetle was \\"a book that we started with very high expectations, but it lost its audience along the way.\\" In June 2009, Blue Beetle was brought back as a \\"co-feature\\" of the more popular Booster Gold comic. In September 2011, a new Blue Beetle comic was launched as part of The New 52 initiative, with Jaime Reyes' history being rebooted with a new origin and without any apparent history of Kord or Garrett as prior Blue Beetles. The new book was written by Tony Bedard and drawn by Ig Guara. Both Blue Beetles reappeared in the third issue of Americomics, a title published by AC Comics in 1983/1984. In the first story in this issue, Ted Kord fought a bogus Dan Garrett, but the second story was more significant. It revealed that the original 1940s Dan was reincarnated as the Silver Age version (minus his memories of his earlier existence) by some unspecified \\"gods\\", presumably the ones responsible for his mystic scarab. The gods subsequently resurrected Dan again and sent him off to save Ted Kord's life (leaving him a note saying simply, \\"Try not to get killed this time\\") After this adventure, Kord turned the Blue Beetle name back over to Dan. Americomics was canceled after issue #6, and so far this story has never been referenced by any other publisher. Another Blue Beetle crossover story depiction revolving around the Blue Beetles is depicted in Booster Gold (vol. 2)#6 by DC Comics. Blue Beetles =Dan Garret / Dan Garrett = The original Golden Age Blue Beetle is Dan Garret,In the earliest Golden Age appearances and during the mid-1960s run by writer-artist Steve Ditko, the original Blue Beetle was referred to as Dan \\"Garret\\", spelled with one \\"t\\". son of a police officer killed by a criminal. This Fox Feature Syndicate version of the character debuted in Mystery Men Comics #1 (August 1939), and began appearing in his own 60-issue series shortly thereafter. Fox Feature Syndicate sponsored a \\"Blue Beetle Day\\" at the 1939 New York World's Fair on August 7, 1940, beginning at 10:30 a.m. and including 300 children in relay- race finals at the Field of Special Events, following preliminaries in New York City parks. The race was broadcast over radio station WMCA. Abstract; full article requires fee or subscription Charlton Comics obtained the rights to the Blue Beetle and reprinted some stories in its anthology titles and in a four-issue Blue Beetle reprint series numbered 18‚Äì21. In 1964, during the Silver Age of comics, Charlton revised the character for a new Blue Beetle series. Charlton's new Blue Beetle retained the original's name (adding a second \\"t\\"), but none of his powers or origin, making him a different character. This Beetle was archaeologist Dan Garrett, who obtained a number of superhuman powers (including super strength and vision, flight, and the ability to generate energy blasts) from a mystical scarab he found during a dig in Egypt, where it had been used to imprison an evil mummified Pharaoh. He would transform into the Blue Beetle by saying the words \\"Kaji Dha!\\" This version, by writer Joe Gill and artist Tony Tallarico, was played at least initially for camp, with stories like \\"The Giant Mummy Who was Not Dead\\". The Charlton Dan Garrett version of the Blue Beetle ran only until 1966 before his replacement debuted. The Charlton version of Dan Garrett was spotlighted in the second issue of DC's 1980s Secret Origins series, in which his origin was retold along with that of Ted Kord. Subsequent appearances by Dan Garrett (in flashback stories) include guest spots or cameos in Infinity, Inc., Captain Atom, JLA: Year One, and Legends of the DC Universe. The character briefly returned in DC Comics' first run of Blue Beetle, resurrected by his mystical scarab to battle against his successor. He can also be seen in various flashback stories. His 1940s incarnation is briefly glimpsed in DC's 1993 limited series The Golden Age. In issue #0 of the Project Superpowers miniseries, the Fox Feature Syndicate version of the Blue Beetle appeared in flashbacks (as by now the character/spelling \\"Dan Garret\\" was in the public domain). To avoid trademark conflicts with DC Comics, he is referred to in this series by the nickname \\"Big Blue\\". =Ted Kord= The replacement Blue Beetle created by Charlton Comics, and later published by Americomics and DC Comics, is Ted Kord, a former student of Dan Garrett, a genius-level inventor and a gifted athlete. Kord and Garrett were investigating Kord's Uncle Jarvis when they learned Jarvis was working to create an army of androids to take over Earth. Garrett changed into Blue Beetle, but was killed in battle. As he died, he passed on to Kord the responsibility of being Blue Beetle, but was unable to pass on the mystical scarab.Blue Beetle vol. 5, #2 (Charlton Comics, Aug. 1967). Ted had the scarab for some time, but never used it. He carried it during the Crisis on Infinite Earths when he was chosen by the Monitor to protect the multiple Earths, but it only reacted when he was attacked; it did not give him superpowers. During the \\"Death of Superman\\" saga, the Blue Beetle and the other JLA members tried to stop Doomsday's path of destruction. Doomsday displayed his near-invulnerability and, while brutally defeating the League, put the Blue Beetle into a coma.Justice League America #69 Upon recovery, he continued his tenure with the JLA as well as its offshoot, Extreme Justice. Blue Beetle discovered a renewed Checkmate organization led by Maxwell Lord, with a database containing information on every metahuman on Earth. He was captured and executed with a single gunshot to the head. Before dying, he had used the scarab in an attempt to contact Shazam, but was forced to leave it with the wizard Shazam in the Rock of Eternity when the wizard sent him back to Earth.Countdown to Infinite Crisis one-shot (May 2005) Some time later, Booster Gold, along with Jaime, Dan, and the Black Beetle in the guise of a Blue Beetle from the future, travels back in time to rescue Kord moments before his death. =Jaime Reyes= Jaime Reyes is a teenager who lives in El Paso, Texas, with his father, mother, and little sister; his father owns a garage and his mother is a nurse. Jaime has offered to help his father out at the garage, but his father has turned him down. He feels Jaime should enjoy his childhood for as long as he can, and should attempt to further his education. He finds the scarab in a vacant lot and it fuses with him while he sleeps.Blue Beetle #1 (2006) After Booster Gold revealed Jaime's new powers to him, Jaime was swept up in the climactic battle with Brother Eye during Infinite Crisis. He later becomes a member of the Teen Titans, and is good friends with Rose Wilson (Ravager), Robin, Static, and others. In Teen Titans vol. 3, #83, he takes a break from the team to be with his mother. Jaime has a girlfriend, the young sorceress Traci 13, who gets along well with Jaime's family. His large and loving family is a major source of strength and guidance for Jaime. Christopher Smith aka the Peacemaker also became a mentor for the young Blue Beetle. Jaime co-starred along with the rest of the former Justice League International in Justice League: Generation Lost. Following DC's \\"Flashpoint\\" storyline Blue Beetle was one of 52 monthly titles launched in September 2011, again starring Jaime Reyes. The series was cancelled after 17 issues in January 2013. The Scarab - Khaji Da The Blue Beetle scarab, previously shown as an artifact of magic, is later retconned as a tool of war of the Reach, an ancient race of cosmic marauders. After being defeated by the Guardians of the Universe thousands of years ago and forced into a truce, the Reach poses as benevolent aliens lending their advanced technology to budding civilizations. The scarab is a gift for that world's champion, giving him amazing powers and the knowledge of the Reach to protect his or her peers. Secretly, the scarab is part of an advanced hive mind, with its own artificial intelligence covertly supplanting the wearer's own. The wearer is turned into the \\"ultimate infiltrator\\", a covert agent intended to take over its own world. However, the Blue Beetle Scarab is damaged and so instead of it controlling the host, it forms a symbiotic relationship with them. The Blue Beetle scarab uses its serial number, Khaji Da, as its name.'Blue Beetle' (2006) #25 In The New 52, the Reach forgoes the secrecy, and each wearer immediately becomes possessed by the scarab. It then uses its host's knowledge to decimate the world and prepare it for a full invasion by Reach forces.Blue Beetle vol 2 #0 (September 2012) In DC Universe: Rebirth, Ted Kord and Jaime Reyes believe the scarab is an alien device that bonded to Jaime's spine. Kord is fascinated by this scarab and wants to investigate the potential of it while Jaime fears it. When Jaime leaves Kord's lab to get to school, Dr. Fate appears in the lab to warn Kord that the scarab is not an alien device, but it is instead magic. This further sparks Kord's interest in the potential of the scarab. Enemies Other versions =Kingdom Come= Blue Beetle (Ted Kord) was seen in Alex Ross and Mark Waid's limited series Kingdom Come. He is shown with the rest of the Charlton \\"Action Heroes\\" not as a member of Magog's Justice Battalion, but as part of Batman's group and later of the MLF (Mankind Liberation Front). He would be shown later in the title in a suit of armor powered by the then-mystic scarab, working with Batman's team. In the novelization of the series, Batman thinks of Blue Beetle, along with Green Arrow and Black Canary, as his closest (at the time) friends. Blue Beetle is killed with most of the other heroes by a nuclear explosion. =52 Multiverse= Earth-19 Blue Beetle. The final issue, #52, of DC Comics' 2006/2007 year-long weekly series 52 revealed that a \\"Multiverse\\" system of 52 parallel universes, with each Earth being a different take on established DC Comics characters as featured in the mainstream continuity (designated as \\"New Earth\\") had come into existence. The Multiverse acts as a storytelling device that allows writers to introduce alternate versions of fictional characters, hypothesize \\"What if?\\" scenarios, revisit popular Elseworlds stories and allow these characters to interact with the mainstream continuity. For example, the Ted Kord of the Kingdom Come limited series is said to reside on Earth-22. Spin-offs from the series Countdown to Final Crisis would introduce more alternate Blue Beetles in 2007. Earth-19 (the Gotham by Gaslight universe), set in a Victorian-like era, has its own version of Dan Garrett who in his secret identity is the leading Egyptologist at the Gotham Museum of Natural History and wears a monocle, appearing in The Search for Ray Palmer: Gotham by Gaslight. The limited series Countdown: Arena depicted three more: Earth-26 Blue Beetle, a swarm of sentient insects that form a man-shaped body (calling themselves \\"The Scarab\\"), Ted of Earth-33, an anthropomorphic beetle, the pet of Mr. and Mrs. Kord, and Earth-39 Blue Beetle, a younger version of Dan Garrett, who has bonded with his scarab in the same way as Jaime Reyes.Countdown: Arena #1‚Äì4 (December 2007) A new version of the Blue Beetle known as \\"Blue Scarab\\" was shown as a member of the Justice League in the apocalyptic future depicted in Justice League: Generation Lost. He is stated as being the \\"descendant of the Blue Beetle\\", and has a very alien-looking appearance.Justice League: Generation Lost #14 (Late January 2011) An evil version has appeared in the antimatter universe of Qward, the universe of the Crime Syndicate of America, known as the Scarab. =DC Animated Universe comics= Blue Beetle has appeared in the Justice League Unlimited spin-off comic book, in issues #5 and #8. In other media =Radio= The Blue Beetle had a short career on the radio, between May and September 1940. Motion picture and radio actor Frank Lovejoy was the Blue Beetle for the first 13 episodes, while for the rest of the shows, the voice was provided by a different, uncredited actor. =Audio drama= The Kingdom Come story, in which the Blue Beetle took part, has been adapted as an audio drama by John Whitman, based on the story by Mark Waid and Alex Ross and the novelization by Elliot S. Maggin (Time Warner Audio Books, 1998). =Films= * The Dan Garret Blue Beetle appears on the cover of a comic book in the Watchmen film tie-in Under the Hood. * In Justice League: Crisis on Two Earths, a evil version of Blue Beetle appeared on a computer page of the lesser members of the Crime Syndicate. * The Ted Kord Blue Beetle is portrayed by Luke Barats in the 2011 short film The Death and Return of Superman. * The Jamie Reyes Blue Beetle is a main character in Justice League vs. Teen Titans, where he is a member of the Teen Titans.

He is never referred to as Blue Beetle in the film, possibly to avoid copyright issues. =Television= Live action * Jaime Reyes appears in the episode \\"Booster\\" in the final season of Smallville, where the scarab bonds with Jaime who is saved by Booster Gold. Ted Kord also makes an appearance as well, searching for the lost, and apparently extremely dangerous Blue Beetle scarab. Dan Garrett is also mentioned, with Clark Kent stating he was a Kord Industries scientist who was killed after the Scarab bonded with him. * Kord Industries is referenced in the second and fourth season of The CW show Arrow. The producers planned for Ted Kord to join the show in the third season, however, when DC told them that they had \\"other plans for him\\", he was replaced by Ray Palmer. * Blue Beetle was referenced in the 7th episode of Legends of Tomorrow when Kendra asks Ray about his favorite color, blue, and his favorite Beatle, he does not have one. Animation * Several incarnations of the Blue Beetle appear on Batman: The Brave and the Bold: ** The Jaime Reyes incarnation is a featured character, with Jaime Reyes voiced by Will Friedle and the Blue Beetle Scarab voiced by Ioan Gruffudd. He appeared in the episodes \\"The Rise of the Blue Beetle!\\", \\"Invasion of the Secret Santas!\\", \\"Fall of the Blue Beetle!\\", \\"Game Over for Owlman!\\", \\"Night of the Huntress!\\", \\"The Fate of Equinox!\\", \\"Revenge of the Reach!\\", \\"Aquaman's Outrageous Adventure!\\", \\"The Power of Shazam!\\", \\"The Siege of Starro!

Dan Garrett makes a brief, non-voiced appearance in \\"Fall of the Blue Beetle!\\" as Batman narrates about the Blue Beetles to Jaime Reyes and \\"Menace of the Madniks!\\" displayed his Blue Beetle suit next to Ted Kord's suit. * The Jaime Reyes version of Blue Beetle appears in season 2 of Young Justice, voiced by actor Eric Lopez. In a running gag, Jaime can often be seen rejecting the Blue Beetle Scarab's (also voiced by Lopez) more violent and bloodthirsty suggestions (\\"No, it would not have been easier to just vaporize him back in the diner!\\"), which confuses those around him as it looks like he's talking to himself. Much of season 2's main story arc also revolves around Jaime's main antagonists, the Reach. Dan Garrett, the original Blue Beetle, appears in a non-speaking cameo in the episode \\"Failsafe\\", in which several scenes depict the members of the Justice Society of America, in 1939. Dan appears among several of the most prominent members of the team, such as Green Lantern, Doctor Fate, and Flash. The episode \\"Intervention\\" later tells the full story of the scarab: ancient Bialyan mystics deactivated its Reach control centuries ago, and it lay dormant until it was discovered by Dan Garrett, who fused with it to become the first Blue Beetle. His successor and protege, the technological genius Ted Kord, was able to recognize the Scarab as a potentially dangerous piece of alien technology, and thus made use of his own inventions as a hero. Kord later lost his life in a battle with Deathstroke and Sportsmaster upon discovering The Light planned to steal and reactivate the Scarab. Jaime came across the Scarab just after Ted Kord's death, and became the third Blue Beetle while believing the Scarab was Kord's own invention. He was recruited into the Justice League's teenage strike team, where subsequent conflicts with the Reach led him to discover the Scarab's true origin and purpose, but his attempts to remove it were unable to keep his body from being completely controlled by it. Some of the Team made a separate discovery of a ritual that could remove the Reach's control over the Scarab, and kept the knowledge quiet while Doctor Fate taught Zatanna the ritual, so the Team could once again deactivate the Scarab to allow Jaime to resume control. The Scarab then cooperates with Jaime without much resistance, preferring their partnership over enslavement. *Jaime Reyes appears in the animated series, Justice League Action, voiced again by Jake T. Austin. Unreleased screen test Geoff Johns announced on his Twitter account that there is a live action screen test of Jaime Reyes as the Blue Beetle. This screen test was used to trial the concept of a Blue Beetle television series. =Video games= In the game Infinite Crisis, a multiplayer online battle arena developed by Turbine, the Jaime Reyes is playable character. All three Blue Beetles appear as playable characters in the Wii U version of Scribblenauts Unmasked: A DC Comics Adventure. Jaime Reyes also appears in Lego Batman 3: Beyond Gotham and Lego DC Super-Villains as a playable character. Jaime Reyes is also a playable fighter in Injustice 2. =The Electric Company = On the PBS children's educational series The Electric Company, the Blue Beetle was a bumbling superhero (played by Jim Boyd) who would often make matters worse instead of better. He wore a mask, a hood with antennae, wings, tennis shoes, boxer shorts, and a T-shirt bearing the name \\"Blue Beetle\\". Outside of the name, the character is unrelated to any of the comic book characters.

The narrative text structures are the plot and the setting.  Definition  Narrative structure is about story and plot: the content of a story and the form used to tell the story. Story refers to the dramatic action as it might be described in chronological order. Plot refers to how the story is told. Story is about trying to determine the key conflicts, main characters, setting and events. Plot is about how, and at what stages, the key conflicts are set up and resolved.Visual Storytelling and Narrative Structure, In Point  Description  The setup (act one) is where all of the main characters and their basic situations are introduced, and contains the primary level of characterization (exploring the character's backgrounds and personalities). A problem is also introduced, which is what drives the story forward. The second act, the conflict, is the bulk of the story, and begins when the inciting incident (or catalyst) sets things into motion. This is the part of the story where the characters go through major changes in their lives as a result of what is happening; this can be referred to as the character arc, or character development. The third act, or resolution, is when the problem in the story boils over, forcing the characters to confront it, allowing all the elements of the story to come together and inevitably leading to the ending.  History  First described in ancient times by Greek philosophers (such as Aristotle and Plato), the notion of narrative structure saw renewed popularity as a critical concept in the mid-to-late-20th century, when structuralist literary theorists including Roland Barthes, Vladimir Propp, Joseph Campbell, and Northrop Frye attempted to argue that all human narratives have certain universal, deep structural elements in common. This argument fell out of fashion when advocates of poststructuralism such as Michel Foucault and Jacques Derrida asserted that such universally shared, deep structures were logically impossible. In Northrup Frye's Anatomy of Criticism, he deals extensively with what he calls myths of spring, summer, fall, and winter: * Spring myths are comedies, that is, stories that lead from bad situations to happy endings. Shakespeare's Twelfth Night is such a story. * Summer myths are similarly utopian fantasies such as Dante's Paradiso. * Fall myths are tragedies that lead from ideal situations to disaster. Compare Hamlet, Othello, and King Lear and the movie Legends of the Fall. * Winter myths are dystopias; for example, George Orwell's 1984, Aldous Huxley's Brave New World, and Ayn Rand's novella Anthem. In Frye‚Äôs Great Code, he offers two narrative structures for plots:Northrop Frye, The Great Code (New York: Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, 1982, 1981). * A U-shaped structure, that is, a story that begins with a state of equilibrium that descends to disaster and then upward to a new stable condition. This is the shape of a comedy. * An inverted U-shape structure, that is, a story in which the protagonist rises to prominence and descends to disaster. This is the shape of tragedy.  Categories  Most forms of narrative fall under four main categories: linear narratives, nonlinear narrative, interactive narration, and interactive narrative. *Linear narrative is the most common form of narration, where events are largely portrayed in a chronological order, that is, telling the events in the order in which they occurred. *Nonlinear narratives, disjointed narrative or disrupted narrative is a narrative technique, where events are portrayed, out of chronological order or in other ways where the narrative does not follow the direct causality pattern. *Interactive narration refers to works where the linear narrative is driven by, rather than influenced by, the user's interaction. *Interactive narrative is a form of fiction in which users are able to make choices that influence the narrative (for example, through alternative plots or resulting in alternative endings) through their actions. = Linear narrative = Flashbacks are often confused with true narratives which are not linear, but the concept is fundamentally linear. An example would be Citizen Kane by Orson Welles. Although some films appear to open (very briefly) with the ending, flashback movies almost immediately jump back to the very beginning of the story to proceed linearly from there, and usually proceed past the supposed \\"ending\\" shown at the beginning of the movie. = Nonlinear narrative = Cinema can only provide the illusion through broken narrative, a famous example of this being the 1994 film Pulp Fiction. The film is ostensibly three short stories, which, upon closer inspection, are actually three sections of one story with the chronology broken up; Quentin Tarantino constructs the narrative without resorting to classic \\"flashback\\" techniques. An even more ambitious attempt at constructing a film based on non-linear narrative is Alain Resnais's 1993 French film Smoking/No Smoking. The plot contains parallel developments, playing on the idea of what might have happened had the characters made different choices. Outside of film, some novels also present their narrative in a non-linear fashion. Creative writing professor Jane Alison describes nonlinear narrative \\"patterns\\" such as spirals, waves, and meanders in her 2019 book Meander, Spiral, Explode: Design and Pattern in Narrative. The chapters of Chitra Banerjee Divakaruni's novel Before We Visit the Goddess are not arranged based on the linear sequence of events, but rather in a way that fulfills certain literary techniques. This allows the characters in the novel to have a believable life timeline while still employing the techniques that make a story enjoyable. = Interactive narration = In works of interactive narration there is only one narrative but the method of delivery requires the user to actively work to gain the next piece of the narrative, or have to piece the parts of narrative that they have together in order to form a coherent narrative. This is the narrative approach of some modern video games. A player will be required to reach an objective, complete a task, solve a puzzle, or finish a level before the narrative continues. = Interactive narrative = An interactive narrative is one which is composed with a branching structure where a single starting point may lead to multiple developments and outcomes. The principle of all such games is that, at each step of the narrative, the user makes choices that advance the story, leading to new series of choices. Authoring non-linear narrative or dialogue thus implies imagining an indefinite number of parallel stories. In a gamebook, readers are told to turn to a certain page according to the choice they wish to make to continue the story. Typically, the choice will be an action rather than dialogue. For example, the hero hears a noise in another room and must decide to open the door and investigate, run away, or call for help. This kind of interactive experience of a story is possible with video games and books (where the reader is free to turn the pages) but less adapted to other forms of entertainment. Improvisational theatre is similarly open- ended, but of course cannot be said to be authored.  Graphic narrative  A simple graphic narrative, such as in comics, has four stages: an introduction of the characters and a description of a situation, the introduction of a problem, unexpected opportunity, or other complication into the situation, a resolution in the form of a partial or complete response to the problem by one or more of the characters, and the denouement, the aftermath of the response that makes clear the success, partial success, non-success, or uncertain success of the response. This fourth stage may also show how the original situation has changed due to what has taken place in the Complication and Resolution stages of the narrative.Baraou, Anne. \\"Facing Faces\\", Drawn and Quarterly 10 (1992) In a simple narrative, the four stages appear in order. That is, the sequence of the telling or presentation follows the chronology of the told. In a more complex story, the order of the telling may vary. For instance, such a story may begin with the Denouement and then present the Situation, Complication, and Resolution in a flashback. But this is not the case with a simple narrative.\\"Composing Graphic Narratives\\", Rutgers University  See also  *Dramatic structure *Narratology *Narreme as the basic unit of narrative structure *Non-narrative film *Rising action *Suspense *Three-act structure  References  Category:Fiction Category:Literary theory Category:Narratology Category:Parts of the narrative structure ","title":"Narrative structure"},{"id":"553891","text":"Donald C.

In 1975, with Russell Hitchcock, he formed Air Supply in Australia. The duo have been singing and performing romantic songs and ballads, such as \\"Lost in Love\\", \\"All Out of Love\\", \\"Every Woman in the World\\", \\"The One That You Love\\", \\"Even the Nights Are Better\\", \\"Goodbye\\" and \\"Making Love Out of Nothing at All\\", for more than forty years. Early life Russell was born in Arnold, Nottingham, England. He had a strong interest in poetry, music and books since his childhood. At the age of 11, he started writing poems and in the same year of 1961, he composed his first song, called \\"That Rockin' Feeling\\". Self-taught, he learned to play guitar and percussion alone and, after the loss of his mother in childhood, he became a loner and thereby found in music and poems a way to express his loss and his emotions. He attended the Carlton-Le-Willows, a technical school in Gedling, Nottingham, where his love for literature and the great English poets only grew further, fueled by study and also an interest that developed on the arts of the paranormal and occult sciences, highlighted by the works of writers Shelley, Keats, and Lord Byron. In 1963, the music of the Beatles was a strong influence that marked his life that year, and after watching a live show in 1964, Russell decided that he wanted to be a musician. Russell joined a band called Union Blues in 1965, where he played percussion, but really wanted to play his own songs in front of the stage. Career In 1968, he moved to Australia and formed a second band in Melbourne, and began to also play solo in cafes and dance clubs, gaining ground on the Australian circuit. In 1973, after reading spiritual and mystical content in search of knowledge and answers for several questions about life, Russell joined the rock opera Jesus Christ Superstar in 1975 and met Russell Hitchcock on the first day and became instant friends. They would sing Beatles songs together during and after shows and this would eventually lead them to form the band Air Supply. Russell performing in Napa, California in 2015 with Air Supply After 18 months in Jesus Christ Superstar, Graham Russell and Russell Hitchcock formed the band under the name which Graham Russell had seen in a dream, a giant bright lights plate in which could be read \\"Air Supply\\". Their first single, \\"Love and Other Bruises\\", became a success. In 1976, after opening for Rod Stewart in Australia and also in the United States in 1977, Air Supply went on tour and two more hit records ensued, \\"Lost in Love\\" and \\"All Out of Love\\". In 1979, Clive Davis heard the song \\"Lost in Love\\" by accident, and the band signed to the label Arista Records. The first single on the Hot 100, \\"Lost in Love\\", reached the top 3 in May 1980, and Graham Russell's \\"The One That You Love\\" reached the top in July 1981. After several successful albums such as The Vanishing Race, News from Nowhere, The Book of Love, and others with reinterpretations of old hits, Graham Russell lived with his wife Jodi in the mountains of Utah, where nature and the animals that they rehabilitate transmit to him a better quality of life and inspiration for compositions and his music. Personal life In 1967, Russell married a high school sweetheart, Linda, and had a son with her the following year, Simon. Simon is currently working with his father, organising concerts and the fan club. Graham and Linda also had a daughter, Samantha, born in March 1972. Graham Russell's marriage to Linda ended in 1978. In 1981, Russell met Jodi Vable on a show, and after two years in which they exchanged correspondence, decided to get together and married in 1986, when Jodi was 21 and Russell was 36.

Their historical influence throughout the Indian subcontinent and the Himalayas was vast and they reached mythic proportions as codified in their songs of realization and hagiographies, or namtars, many of which have been preserved in the Tibetan Buddhist canon. The Mahasiddhas are the founders of Vajrayana traditions and lineages such as Dzogchen and Mahamudra. Robert Thurman explains the symbiotic relationship between Tantric Buddhist communities and the Buddhist universities such as Nalanda which flourished at the same time: Genealogy and historical dates The exact genealogy and historical dates of the Mahasiddhas are contentious. Dowman (1986) holds that they all lived between 750 and 1150 CE. Primary tradition Abhayadatta Sri is an Indian scholar of the 12th century who is claimed to have recorded the hagiographies of the eighty-four siddhas in a text known as The History of the Eighty-four Mahasiddhas (Sanskrit: Caturasitisiddha pravrtti; ). Dowman holds that the eighty-four Mahasiddha are spiritual archetypes: Reynolds (2007) states that the mahasiddha tradition \\"evolved in North India in the early Medieval Period (3‚Äì13 cen. CE). Philosophically this movement was based on the insights revealed in the Mahayana Sutras and as systematized in the Madhyamaka and Chittamatrin schools of philosophy, but the methods of meditation and practice were radically different than anything seen in the monasteries. He proffers that the mahasiddha tradition \\"broke with the conventions of Buddhist monastic life of the time, and abandoning the monastery they practiced in the caves, the forests, and the country villages of Northern India. In complete contrast to the settled monastic establishment of their day, which concentrated the Buddhist intelligenzia [sic.] in a limited number of large monastic universities, they adopted the life-style of itinerant mendicants, much as the wandering Sadhus of modern India.\\" The charnel ground conveys how great mahasiddhas in the Nath and Vajrayana traditions such as Tilopa (988‚Äì1069) and Gorakshanath (fl. 11th ‚Äì 12th century) yoked adversity to till the soil of the path and accomplish the fruit, the \\"ground\\" (Sanskrit: ƒÅ≈õraya; ) of realization:Dudjom Rinpoche (2002), p. 535 In his study of the Hevajra Tantra, David Snellgrove outlines the typical tantric siddha or yogi. After experiencing the consummation of enlightenment in the embrace of a female consort: > Thereafter the pupil is free to pursue the practice of strenuous meditation > and physical self-control, and after five years or more he will perhaps > succeed. He receives the five symbolic adornments, crown, ear-rings, > necklace, bracelets, girdle, signs of his success.

He is free from > all conventions and wanders as he pleases, knowing no distinction between > friend or foe, clean or unclean, good or evil.Snellgrove, David; The Hevajra > Tantra: A Critical Study, page 11 Other traditions According to Ulrich von Schroeder, Tibet has different traditions relating to the mahasiddhas. Among these traditions, two were particularly popular, namely the Abhayadatta Sri list and the so-called Vajrasana list. The number of mahasiddhas varies between eighty-four and eighty-eight, and only about thirty-six of the names occur in both lists. In many instances more than one siddha with the same name exists, so it must be assumed that fewer than thirty siddhas of the two traditions actually relate to the same historical persons. In the days when the siddhas of the later Tibetan traditions flourished in India (i.e., between the 9th and 11th centuries), it was not uncommon for initiates to assume the names of famous adepts of the past. Sometimes a disciple would have the same name as his guru, while still other names were based on caste or tribe. In such a context the distinction between siddhas of the same name becomes blurred. The entire process of distinguishing between siddhas with the same name of different texts and lineages is therefore to large extent guesswork. The great variation in phonetic transcription of Indian words into Tibetan may partly be the result of various Tibetan dialects. In the process of copying the Tibetan transcriptions in later times, the spelling often became corrupted to such an extent that the recognition or reconstitution of the original names became all but impossible. Whatever the reasons might be, the Tibetan transcription of Indian names of mahasiddhas clearly becomes more and more corrupt as time passes. Geographical sites Local folk tradition refers to a number of icons and sacred sites to the eighty-four Mahasiddha at Bharmour (formerly known as Brahmapura) in the Chaurasi complex.HƒÅ·πá·∏çƒÅ (1994), p. 85 The word chaurasi means \\"eighty-four\\". A number of archaeological sacred sites require iconographic analysis in the Chaurasi complex in Chamba, Himachal Pradesh. Although it might be hagiographical accretion and folk lore, it is said that in the reign of Sahil Varman: CaturƒÅsiti-siddha-pravrtti The Caturasiti- siddha-pravrtti (CSP), ‚ÄúThe Lives of the Eighty-four Siddhas‚Äù, compiled by Abhayadatta Sri, a Northern Indian Sanskrit text dating from the 11th or 12th century, comes from a tradition prevalent in the ancient city-state of Campa in the modern state of Bihar. Only Tibetan translations of this Sanskrit text seem to have survived. This text was translated into Tibetan by sMon grub Shes rab and is known as the Grub thob brgyad cu rtsa bzhi‚Äôi lo rgyus or ‚ÄúThe Legends of the Eighty-four Siddhas‚Äù. It has been suggested that Abhayadatta Sri is identical with the great Indian scholar Mahapandita Abhayakaragupta (late 11th‚Äìearly 12th century), the compiler of the iconographic compendiums Vajravali, Nispannayogavali, and Jyotirmanjari. The other major Tibetan tradition is based on the list contained in the Caturasiti-siddhabhyarthana (CSA) by Ratnakaragupta of Vajrasana, identical with Bodhgaya (Tib.: rDo rje gdan) located in Bihar, Northern India. The Tibetan translation is known as Grub thob brgyad cu rtsa bzhi‚Äôi gsol ‚Äôdebs by rDo rje gdan pa. There exist several Tibetan versions of the list of mahasiddhas based on the Vajrasana text. However, these Tibetan texts differ in many cases with regard to the Tibetan transcriptions of the Indian mahasiddhas names.von Schroeder (2006) Eighty-four Mahasiddhas Vajradhara Buddha with mahasiddhas By convention there are eighty-four Mahasiddhas in both Hindu and Tibetan Buddhist traditions, with some overlap between the two lists. The number is congruent with the number of siddhi or occult powers held in the Indian Religions. In Tibetan Buddhist art they are often depicted together as a matched set in works such as thangka paintings where they may be used collectively as border decorations around a central figure. Each Mahasiddha has come to be known for certain characteristics and teachings, which facilitates their pedagogical use. One of the most beloved Mahasiddhas is Vir≈´pa, who may be taken as the patron saint of the Sakyapa sect and instituted the Lamdr√© (Tibetan: lam 'bras) teachings. Virupa (alternate orthographies: Birwapa/Birupa) lived in 9th century India and was known for his great attainments. Some of the methods and practices of the Mahasiddha were codified in Buddhist scriptures known as Tantras. Traditionally the ultimate source of these methods and practices is held to be the historical Buddha Shakyamuni, but often it is a transhistorical aspect of the Buddha or deity Vajradhara or Samantabhadra who reveals the Tantra in question directly to the Mahasiddha in a vision or whilst they dream or are in a trance. This form of the deity is known as a sambhogakaya manifestation. The sadhana of Dream Yoga as practiced in Dzogchen traditions such as the Kham, entered the Himalayan tantric tradition from the Mahasiddha, Ngagpa and Bonpo. Dream Yoga or \\"Milam\\" (T:rmi-lam; S:svapnadar≈õana), is one of the Six Yogas of Naropa. Four of the eighty-four Mahasiddhas are women. They are: *Manibhadra, the Perfect Wife *Lakshmincara, The Princess of Crazy wisdom *Mekhala, the elder of the 2 Headless Sisters *Kanakhala, the younger of the 2 Headless Sisters Von Schroeder (2006) states: =List of the Mahasiddhas= Nagarjuna with 84 Mahasiddhas, Rubin Museum of Art, About 1750 In Vajrayana Buddhism there are eighty-four Mahasiddhas. The list (in alphabetical order) below includes their name and their epithet. An asterisk after their name denotes a female Mahasiddha. Many Mahasiddhas practiced specific tantras, for example Brahman Kukkuripa (34th in Abhyadatta's list) of Kapila≈õakru practiced Cakrasa·πÉvara Tantra, Monk Vir≈´pa (3) of Somapuri practiced Hevajra for 12 years, Monk Kar·πáaripa (Aryadeva) (18) of NƒÅlandƒÅ practiced GuhyasamƒÅja. #Acinta, the \\"Avaricious Hermit\\"; #Ajogi, the \\"Rejected Wastrel\\"; #Anangapa, the \\"Handsome Fool\\"; #Aryadeva (Karnaripa), the \\"One- Eyed\\",(fl. 3rd century CE), Nalanda ; #Babhaha, the \\"Free Lover\\"; #Bhadrapa, the \\"Exclusive Brahmin\\"; #Bhandepa, the \\"Envious God\\"; #Bhiksanapa, \\"Siddha Two-Teeth\\"; #Bhusuku (Shantideva), the \\"Idle Monk\\"; #Camaripa, the \\"Divine Cobbler\\"; #Champaka, the \\"Flower King\\"; #Carbaripa (Carpati) \\"the Petrifyer\\"; #Catrapa, the \\"Lucky Beggar\\"; #Caurangipa, \\"the Dismembered Stepson\\"; #Celukapa, the \\"Revitalized Drone\\"; #Darikapa, the \\"Slave-King of the Temple Whore\\"; #Dengipa, the \\"Courtesan's Brahmin Slave\\"; #Dhahulipa, the \\"Blistered Rope-Maker\\"; #Dharmapa, the \\"Eternal Student\\" (c.900 CE); #Dhilipa, the \\"Epicurean Merchant\\"; #Dhobipa, the \\"Wise Washerman\\"; #Dhokaripa, the \\"Bowl- Bearer\\"; #Dombipa Heruka, the \\"Tiger Rider\\"; #Dukhandi, the \\"Scavenger\\"; #Ghantapa, the \\"Celibate Bell-Ringer\\"; #Gharbari or Gharbaripa, the \\"Contrite Scholar\\" (Skt., pandita); #Godhuripa, the \\"Bird Catcher\\"; #Goraksha, the \\"Immortal Cowherd\\"; #Indrabhuti, the \\"Enlightened Siddha-King\\"; #Jalandhara, the \\"Dakini's Chosen One\\"; #Jayananda, the \\"Crow Master\\"; #Jogipa, the \\"Siddha-Pilgrim\\"; #Kalapa, the \\"Handsome Madman\\"; #Kamparipa, the \\"Blacksmith\\"; #Kambala (Lavapa), the \\"Black-Blanket-Clad Yogin\\"; #Kanakhala*, the younger Severed-Headed Sister; #Kanhapa (Krishnacharya), the \\"Dark Siddha\\"; #Kankana, the \\"Siddha-King\\"; #Kankaripa, the \\"Lovelorn Widower\\"; #Kantalipa, the \\"Ragman-Tailor\\"; #Kapalapa, the \\"Skull Bearer\\"; #Khadgapa, the \\"Fearless Thief\\"; #Kilakilapa, the \\"Exiled Loud-Mouth\\"; #Kirapalapa (Kilapa), the \\"Repentant Conqueror\\"; #Kokilipa, the \\"Complacent Aesthete\\"; #Kotalipa (or Tog tse pa, the \\"Peasant Guru\\"; #Kucipa, the \\"Goitre-Necked Yogin\\"; #Kukkuripa, (late 9th/10th Century), the \\"Dog Lover\\"; #Kumbharipa, \\"the Potter\\"; #Laksminkara*, \\"The Mad Princess\\"; #Lilapa, the \\"Royal Hedonist\\"; #Lucikapa, the \\"Escapist\\"; #Luipa, the \\"Fish-Gut Eater\\"; #Mahipa, the \\"Greatest\\"; #Manibhadra*, the \\"Happy Housewife\\"; #Medhini, the \\"Tired Farmer\\"; #Mekhala*, the Elder Severed-Headed Sister; #Mekopa, the \\"Guru Dread-Stare\\"; #Minapa, the \\"Fisherman\\"; #Nagabodhi, the \\"Red-Horned Thief'\\"; #Nagarjuna, \\"Philosopher and Alchemist\\", a Brahmin, (c. 150 ‚Äì c. 250 CE); #Nalinapa, the \\"Self-Reliant Prince\\"; #Nirgunapa, the \\"Enlightened Moron\\"; #Naropa, the \\"Dauntless\\"; #Pacaripa, the \\"Pastrycook\\"; #Pankajapa, the \\"Lotus-Born Brahmin\\"; #Putalipa, the \\"Mendicant Icon-Bearer\\"; #Rahula, the \\"Rejuvenated Dotard\\"; #Saraha, the \\"Great Brahmin\\", the teacher of Nagarjuna, eastern India; #Sakara or Saroruha; #Samudra, the \\"Pearl Diver\\"; #≈öƒÅntipa (or RatnƒÅkara≈õƒÅnti), the \\"Complacent Missionary\\"; #Sarvabhaksa, the \\"Glutton\\"; #Savaripa, the \\"Hunter\\", held to have incarnated in Drukpa K√ºnleg; #Syalipa, the \\"Jackal Yogin\\"; #Tantepa, the \\"Gambler\\"; #Tantipa, the \\"Senile Weaver\\"; #Thaganapa, the \\"Compulsive Liar\\"; #Tilopa, the \\"Great Renunciate\\" #Udhilipa, the \\"Bird-Man\\"; #Upanaha, the \\"Bootmaker\\"; #Vinapa, the \\"Musician\\"; #Virupa, the \\"Dakini Master\\"; #Vyalipa, the \\"Courtesan's Alchemist\\". =Names according to the Abhayadatta Sri tradition= According to Ulrich von Schroeder, Tibet has different traditions relating to the mahasiddhas. Among these traditions, two were particularly popular, namely the Abhayadatta Sri list and the so- called Vajrasana list. The number of mahasiddhas varies between eighty-four and eighty-eight, and only about thirty-six of the names occur in both lists. It is therefore also wrong to state that in Buddhism are 84 Mahasiddhas. The correct title should therefore be Names of the 84 Mahasiddhas according to the Abhayadatta Sri Tradition. It should also be clearly stated that only Tibetan translations of this Sanskrit text Caturasiti-siddha-pravrtti (CSP) or The Lives of the Eighty-four Siddhas seem to have survived. This means that many Sanskrit names of the Abhayadatta Sri tradition had to be reconstructed and perhaps not always correctly. =Identification= According to Ulrich von Schroeder for the identification of Mahasiddhas inscribed with Tibetan names it is necessary to reconstruct the Indian names. This is a very difficult task because the Tibetans are very inconsistent with the transcription or translation of Indian personal names and therefore many different spellings do exist. When comparing the different Tibetan texts on mahasiddhas, we can see that the transcription or translation of the names of the Indian masters into the Tibetan language was inconsistent and confused. The most unsettling example is an illustrated Tibetan block print from Mongolia about the mahasiddhas, where the spellings in the text vary greatly from the captions of the xylographs.Egyed (1984) To quote a few examples: Kankaripa [Skt.] is named Kam ka li/Kangga la pa; Goraksa [Skt.]: Go ra kha/Gau raksi; Tilopa [Skt.]: Ti la blo ba/Ti lla pa; Dukhandi [Skt.]: Dha khan dhi pa/Dwa kanti; Dhobipa [Skt.]: Tom bhi pa/Dhu pi ra; Dengipa (CSP 31): Deng gi pa / Tinggi pa; Dhokaripa [Skt.]: Dho ka ra / Dhe ki ri pa; Carbaripa (Carpati) [Skt.]: Tsa ba ri pa/Tsa rwa ti pa; Sakara [Skt.]: Phu rtsas ga‚Äô/Ka ra pa; Putalipa [Skt.]: Pu ta la/Bu ta li, etc. In the same illustrated Tibetan text we find another inconsistency: the alternate use of transcription and translation. Examples are Nagarjuna [Skt.]: Na ga‚Äôi dzu na/Klu sgrub; Aryadeva (Karnaripa) [Skt.]: Ka na ri pa/‚ÄôPhags pa lha; and Ghantapa [Skt.]: Ghanda pa/rDo rje dril bu pa, to name a few. =Concordance lists= For the identification of individual mahasiddhas the concordance lists published by Ulrich von Schroeder are useful tools for every scholar. The purpose of the concordance lists published in the appendices of his book is primarily for the reconstitution of the Indian names, regardless of whether they actually represent the same historical person or not. The index of his book contains more than 1000 different Tibetan spellings of mahasiddha names. Tibetan mahasiddhas Milarepa on Mount Kailash Tibetan Buddhist masters of various lineages are often referred to as mahasiddhas (grub thob chen po or tul shug). There is a long tradition of hagiographies of these Tibetan adepts, called namtar. Important Tibetan mahasiddhas include: * Padmasambhava, who is said to have brought Buddhism to Tibet and tamed the harmful spirits of Tibet, converting them to Buddhism. * Yeshe Tsogyal, Padmasambhava's consort * Marpa the translator (1012‚Äì1097), a lay scholar-yogi who is a key figure in the Kagyu lineage * Machig Labdr√∂n (1055-1149), a female mahasiddha, the founding figure of the Ch√∂d (Wylie: gcod) lineage. * Milarepa (c. 11th - 12th century), a wilderness yogi, one of the most revered figures in Tibetan Buddhism * Longchenpa, a key figure of the Nyingma school * Je Tsongkhapa, is considered a mahasiddha in the Gelug school * Thangtong Gyalpo * Drukpa Kunley * Tsangny√∂n Heruka \\"The Madman Heruka from Tsang\\", (1452-1507) * Shabkar Tsokdruk Rangdrol (1781-1851) * Jigme Lingpa, an important terton (treasure revealer) See also *Charyapada *Gorakshanath *Matsyendranath *Twilight language Notes References   * * Further reading * Also in Dowman (1986).  * External links *The 84 Indian Adepts of Abhayadatta System *Mahasiddha: Buddhist Tantric Teachers of India Category:Buddhist titles Category:Buddhist yogis Category:Religious leadership roles Category:Spiritual teachers Category:Tibetan Buddhism Category:Vajrayana Category:Buddhist religious occupations ","title":"Mahasiddha"},{"id":"553916","text":"Alfred McCoy Tyner (December 11, 1938 ‚Äì March 6, 2020) was an American jazz pianist known for his work with the John Coltrane Quartet and a long solo career. He was an NEA Jazz Master and a five-time Grammy winner. Not a player of electric keyboards and synthesizers, he was committed to acoustic instrumentation. Tyner, who was widely imitated, was one of the most recognizable and most influential pianists in jazz history.  Early life and family  Tyner was born in Philadelphia, as the oldest of three children of Jarvis and Beatrice (Stevenson) Tyner. He was encouraged to study piano by his mother. He began studying the piano at age 13 and within two years music had become the focal point in his life. He studied at West Philadelphia Music School and later at the Granoff School of Music. During his teens he led his own group, the Houserockers. When he was 17, he converted to Islam through the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community and changed his name to Sulieman Saud. Tyner played professionally in Philadelphia becoming part of its modern jazz scene. His neighbors in the city included musicians Richie Powell and Bud Powell.  Career  In 1960, Tyner joined The Jazztet led by Benny Golson and Art Farmer. Six months later, he joined the quartet of John Coltrane that included Elvin Jones and Steve Davis (later replaced by Art Davis, Reggie Workman, and, finally, Jimmy Garrison). He worked with the band during its extended run at the Jazz Gallery, replacing Steve Kuhn. Coltrane had known Tyner for a while growing up in Philadelphia. He recorded the pianist's composition \\"The Believer\\" on January 10, 1958; it became the title track of Prestige's 1964 album The Believer issued as a John Coltrane record. He played on Coltrane's My Favorite Things (1961) for Atlantic. The band toured almost non-stop between 1961 and 1965, recording the albums Coltrane \\"Live\\" at the Village Vanguard (1962), Ballads (1963), John Coltrane and Johnny Hartman (1963), Live at Birdland (1964), Crescent (1964), A Love Supreme (1964), and The John Coltrane Quartet Plays (1965), all for Impulse!. While in Coltrane's group, he recorded albums in a piano trio. In late 1962 and the first half of 1963, Tyner was asked by producer Bob Thiele to record more straightforward jazz albums as a leader. These albums included Reaching Fourth (1963), Today and Tomorrow (1964), and McCoy Tyner Plays Ellington (1965). Reviewing the album in 2017, Marc Myers of JazzWax said, \\"...the finest of these straightforward piano recordings was Nights of Ballads & Blues. Tyner's playing is exciting and exceptional on all of the tracks... On the album, he exhibits a reserved elegance and tenderness that reveals the other side of his personality‚Äîa lover of melody and standards. In this regard, there are traces of Oscar Peterson in his playing. Perhaps Thiele was using Tyner to take a bite out of Peterson's vast and successful early-'60s share of the jazz market.\\" He also appeared as a sideman on many Blue Note albums of the 1960s, although he was often credited as \\"etc.\\" on the cover of these albums to respect his contract with Impulse!. Tyner's playing style developed in close contact with Coltrane. His style of piano is comparable to Coltrane's maximalist style on saxophone. Writing in 2019, Sami Linna at the University of the Arts Helsinki, noted that Coltrane described the two different directions in his playing as: \\"playing chordally (vertically) or melodically (horizontally)\\". Linna suggests: \\"Tyner would eventually find a way of dealing with the two directions simultaneously, in a manner that was supportive and complementary yet original and slightly different from Coltrane's approach.\\" After 1960 Coltrane did not hire anyone at the piano if Tyner was not available; between Tyner joining the group (around the end of May 1960) and leaving (in December 1965), there was nobody else at the piano accompanying Coltrane. = Post-Coltrane = Tyner at Keystone Korner, San Francisco, California, March 1981 Tyner's involvement with Coltrane came to an end in 1965. Coltrane's music was becoming much more atonal and free; he had also augmented his quartet with percussion players who threatened to drown out both Tyner and Jones: \\"I didn't see myself making any contribution to that music... All I could hear was a lot of noise. I didn't have any feeling for the music, and when I don't have feelings, I don't play\\".Lewis Porter, John Coltrane: His Life and Music, p. 266. In 1966, Tyner rehearsed with a new trio and embarked on a career as a bandleader.Lewis Porter, John Coltrane: His Life and Music, p. 268. After leaving Coltrane's group, Tyner produced a series of post-bop albums released by Blue Note from 1967 to 1970. These included The Real McCoy (1967), Tender Moments (1967), Time for Tyner (1968), Expansions (1968) and Extensions (1970). He signed with Milestone and recorded such albums as Sahara and Echoes of a Friend (1972), Enlightenment (1973), and Fly with the Wind (1976), which included flautist Hubert Laws, drummer Billy Cobham, and a string orchestra. His music for Blue Note and Milestone often took the music of the Coltrane quartet as a starting point. Tyner also incorporated African and East Asian elements in his music. On Sahara he played koto in addition to piano, flute, and percussion. These albums have been cited as examples of innovative jazz from the 1970s that was neither fusion nor free jazz. On Trident (1975) Tyner played the harpsichord and celeste, instruments heard rarely in jazz. Tyner with Ravi Coltrane, Newport Jazz Festival, Newport, Rhode Island, 2005 During the 1980s and 1990s, Tyner worked in a trio that included Avery Sharpe on bass and Louis Hayes, then Aaron Scott, on drums. He made solo albums for Blue Note, starting with Revelations (1988) and culminating in Soliloquy (1991). After signing with Telarc, he recorded with several trios that included Charnett Moffett on bass and Al Foster on drums. In 2008, he toured with a quartet of Gary Bartz, Gerald L. Cannon, and Eric Gravatt. On June 25, 2019, The New York Times Magazine listed McCoy Tyner among hundreds of artists whose material was reportedly destroyed in the 2008 Universal fire. Tyner is considered to be one of the most influential jazz pianists of the late 20th century, an honor he earned during and after his time with Coltrane. Tyner with his quartet at Jazz Alley, Seattle, Washington, 2012 Tyner, who was left-handed, played with a low bass left hand in which he raised his arm high above the keyboard for an emphatic attack. His right-hand soloing was detached and staccato. His melodic vocabulary was rich, ranging from raw blues to complexly superimposed pentatonic scales; his approach to chord voicing (most characteristically by fourths) influenced contemporary jazz pianists, such as Chick Corea.  Awards and honors  Tyner was named a 2002 NEA Jazz Master by the National Endowment for the Arts. He won five Grammy Awards, for The Turning Point and Journey and best instrumental jazz album for Illuminations, Infinity, and Blues for Coltrane: A Tribute to John Coltrane. Tyner was awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Music from Berklee College of Music at the Sala dei Notari during the Umbria Jazz Festival.\\"Hank Jones, Mccoy Tyner, Enrico Rava Honored by Berklee College of Music at Umbria Jazz\\", Jazz News, 2005.

Death  On March 6, 2020, Tyner died at his home in northern New Jersey, at the age of 81. His family released a statement on Twitter. He is survived by his ex-wife, Aisha Tyner, their son Nurudeen, known as Deen, his brother and sister, Jarvis Tyner and Gwendolyn-Yvette Tyner, and three grandchildren.

The Russian word for \\"seaman\\" or \\"sailor\\" (; matros) was borrowed from the German \\"matrose\\". In Imperial Russia the most junior naval rank was \\"seaman 2nd class\\" (–º–∞—Ç—Ä–æ—Å 2-–π —Å—Ç–∞—Ç—å–∏; matros vtoroi stati). Estonia () and Latvia () use closely related loanwords. The 1917 Revolution led to the term \\"Red Fleet man\\" (–∫—Ä–∞—Å–Ω–æ—Ñ–ª–æ—Ç–µ—Ü; krasnoflotets) until 1943, when the Soviet Navy reintroduced the term \\"seaman\\" (–º–∞—Ç—Ä–æ—Å; matros), along with badges of rank. The Russian Federation inherited the term in 1991, as did several other former Soviet republics, including Ukraine, Azerbaijan and Belarus, with Bulgaria using the same word and the same Cyrillic orthography. United Kingdom In the Royal Navy the rate is split into two divisions: AB1 and AB2. The AB2 rating is used for those who have not yet completed their professional taskbooks. The rate of ordinary seaman has been discontinued. United States E-3 insignia Constructionman variation E-3 insignia (fireman) Fireman variation E-3 insignia (airman) Airman variation E-3 insignia Seaman insignia A US Navy seaman at work aboard USS Nimitz Seaman is the third enlisted rank from the bottom in the U.S. Navy and U.S. Coast Guard, ranking above seaman apprentice and below petty officer third class. This naval rank was formerly called \\"seaman first class\\". The rank is also used in United States Naval Sea Cadet Corps, a naval-themed uniformed youth program under the sponsorship of the Navy League of the United States. The actual title and insignia for an E-3 varies based on the job rating to which the member will ultimately be assigned. * Those in the general deck, technical, weapons and administrative groups (with the exception of the aviation administration men) are called \\"seamen\\" and they represent the largest group of Navy and Coast Guard personnel in pay grades E-3 and below. They wear white stripes on their blue uniforms (USN and USCG), and navy blue (black) stripes on their white uniforms (USN only). * Those in the medical group are now called \\"hospitalmen.\\" In October 2005, the USN dental technician (DT) rating was merged into the hospital corpsman (HM) rating, eliminating the \\"dentalman\\" title for E-3 and below. Those who once held the rank of \\"dentalman\\" have become \\"hospitalmen\\". They wear white stripes on their blue uniforms, and navy blue stripes on their white uniforms. After the completion of their \\"A\\" school, they wear a caduceus of the same color as the stripes on their uniforms. On their combat uniforms, a hospitalman wears their caduceus on the tab of their left collar tab. This rating was previously called pharmacist's mate (PHM) and HMs are colloquially referred to as \\"corpsman\\" in the naval service. Hospitalmen exist only in the U.S. Navy; their equivalent in the U.S. Coast Guard is the health services technician (HS), which is sourced from seamen in that service's administrative and scientific group. * Those in the shipboard engineering and hull group, comprising conventional (USN + USCG) and nuclear (USN only) powerplants and propulsion, as well as the hull maintenance area, are called \\"firemen.\\" They wear red stripes on both their USN and USCG blue uniforms and, in the case of the Navy, white uniforms. * Those in the aviation group of the Navy and Coast Guard are called \\"airmen\\", and they wear green stripes on blue uniforms (USN + USCG) and white uniforms (USN only). * Enlisted personnel in the construction group, which primarily populates the U.S. Navy's civil engineering construction battalions (i.e., Seabees), are called \\"constructionmen\\" and they wear light blue stripes on both their blue and white uniforms. Constructionmen are unique to the U.S. Navy; there is no U.S. Coast Guard equivalent. No such stripes for E-1, E-2 or E-3 are authorized to be worn on working uniforms, e.g., navy work uniform, USCG operational dress uniform, coveralls, utility wear, flight suits, hospital and clinic garb, diving suits, etc. However, sailors with the pay grade of E-2 or E-3 are permitted to wear silver-anodized collar devices on their service uniforms. Some sailors and Coast Guardsmen receive a rating following completion of a military technical training course for that particular rating known as an \\"A\\" school. Other sailors and Coast Guardsmen who have completed the requirements to be assigned a rating and have been accepted by the Navy Personnel Command/Bureau of Naval Personnel (USN) or the Coast Guard Personnel Service Center Command (USCG) as holding that rating (a process called \\"striking\\") are called \\"designated strikers\\", and are referred to by their full rate and rating in formal communications (i.e., machinist's mate fireman (MMFN), as opposed to simply fireman (FN)), though the rating is often left off in informal communications. Those who have not officially been assigned to a rating are officially referred to as \\"undesignated\\" or \\"non-rates.\\" Once selected for a particular rating of their choice they become eligible for advancement in that community.

Ludwig, P. Bretchko, RF Circuit Design, Theory and Applications, Prentice Hall NJ, 2000. i.e. wavelengths from slightly over one centimeter down to 7.5 millimeters. The band is called Ka, short for \\"K-above\\" because it is the upper part of the original NATO K band, which was split into three bands because of the presence of the atmospheric water vapor resonance peak at 22.24 GHz (1.35 cm), which made the center unusable for long range transmission. The 30/20 GHz band is used in communications satellite uplinks in either the 27.5 GHz and 31 GHz bands, and high-resolution, close-range targeting radars aboard military airplanes. Some frequencies in this radio band are used for vehicle speed detection by law enforcement. The Kepler Mission used this frequency range to downlink the scientific data collected by the space telescope. The designation \\"Ka-band\\" is from Kurz-above, which stems from the German word kurz meaning \\"short\\".http://www.itwissen.info/definition/lexikon/K-Band-K-band.html (german) In satellite communications, the Ka band allows higher bandwidth communication. It was first used in the experimental ACTS Gigabit Satellite Network, and is currently used in the Inmarsat I-5 system and the SpaceX Starlink system and will be used in the Iridium Next satellite series, Kacific K-1 satellite, as well as the James Webb Space Telescope. The Ka band is more susceptible to rain attenuation than is the , which in turn is more susceptible than the C band. The frequency is commonly used by cosmic microwave background experiments. The 5th generation mobile networks will also partially overlap with Ka band (28, 38, and 60 GHz).

Applications  = Mobile service = In Europe, the Electronic Communications Committee (ECC) of the European Conference of Postal and Telecommunications Administrations (CEPT) has harmonized part of the L band (1452‚Äì1492 MHz), allowing individual countries to adopt this spectrum for terrestrial mobile/fixed communications networks supplemental downlink (MFCN SDL). By means of carrier aggregation, an LTE-Advanced or UMTS/HSDPA base station could use this spectrum to provide additional bandwidth for communications from the base station to the mobile device; i.e., in the downlink direction. = Satellite navigation = The Global Positioning System carriers are in the L band, centered at 1176.45 MHz (L5), 1227.60 MHz (L2), 1381.05 MHz (L3), and 1575.42 MHz (L1) frequencies. L band waves are used for GPS units because they are able to penetrate clouds, fog, rain, storms, and vegetation. Only dense environments such as heavy forest canopies or concrete buildings can cause GPS units to receive data inaccurately. The Galileo Navigation System, the GLONASS System, and the BeiDou system uses the L band similar to GPS, although the frequency ranges are named differently. Modern receivers, such as those found in smartphones, are able to take advantage of multiple systems (usually only around the oldest L1 band) at the same time. = Telecommunications use = Mobile phones operate at 800‚Äì900 and 1700‚Äì2100 MHz. Iridium Communications satellite phones use frequencies between 1616 and 1626.5 MHzhttp://www.fcc.gov/Bureaus/International/Orders/1995/da950131.txt to communicate with the satellites. Inmarsat and LightSquared terminals use frequencies between 1525 and 1646.5 MHz. Thuraya satellite phones use frequencies between 1525 and 1661 MHz. = Aircraft surveillance = The aircraft L-band ranges from 960‚Äì1215MHz. Aircraft can use Automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast (ADS-B) equipment at 1090 MHz to communicate position information to the ground as well as between them for traffic information and avoidance. The 1090 MHz frequency (paired with 1030 MHz) is also used by Mode S transponders, which ADS-B augments when operated at this frequency. The TCAS system also utilizes the 1030/1090MHz paired frequencies. ADS-B information can also be broadcast on the L band frequency of 978 MHz. DME and TACAN systems are also in this frequency band. = Amateur radio = The Radio Regulations of the International Telecommunication Union allow amateur radio operations in the frequency range 1,240‚Äì1,300 MHz, and amateur satellite up- links are allowed in the range 1,260‚Äì1,270 MHz. This is known as the 23-centimeter band by radio amateurs and as the L-band by AMSAT. = Digital Audio Broadcasting = In the United States and overseas territories, the L band is held by the military for telemetry, thereby forcing digital radio to in-band on-channel (IBOC) solutions. Digital Audio Broadcasting (DAB) in Europe primarily uses Band III, but may also be carried in the 1452‚Äì1492MHz range in some countries. WorldSpace satellite radio used to broadcast in the 1467‚Äì1492 MHz L sub-band. = Digital Video Broadcasting = DVB-H, DVB-SH, and DVB-T2 can operate in the L band. = Digital Multimedia Broadcasting = T-DMB can operate in the L band. = Astronomy = The band also contains the hyperfine transition of neutral hydrogen (the hydrogen line, 1420 MHz), which is of great astronomical interest as a means of imaging the normally invisible neutral atomic hydrogen in interstellar space.

Influenced by the pioneers of the industrial genre, such as Throbbing Gristle, Chemlab mixed experimental sounds with rock and metal within an electronic framework. They released their first EP 10 Ton Pressure (1990), parted ways with Frank and moved to New York City, their base for the duration of their career. Chemlab released their debut album Burn Out at the Hydrogen Bar in 1993 and toured with acts such as White Zombie, KMFDM, Nine Inch Nails, 16volt, and GWAR. History = Initial releases (1990-2004) = Chemlab's first release was the EP 10 Ton Pressure, in 1990. Chemlab toured as opening acts for Nine Inch Nails from 1990 to 1991 for the Sin tour, which was a part of the greater Pretty Hate Machine Tour . After releasing the albums Burn Out at the Hydrogen Bar (1993) and East Side Militia (1996) on Fifth Colvmn Records, Chemlab broke up in 1997 and then later reformed in 2004 to release an album entitled Oxidizer (album) with Jared as the only original member. = Intermittent touring (2004-2012) = After a seven-year hiatus from the stage, Jared recreated Chemlab and, with a backing band composed of the members of electro-industrial group mindFIELD performed a one-off show in Boston, Massachusetts in August 2005. The band played another one-off show, this time in New York City on January 7, 2006. A third show in San Francisco on March 17, 2006, saw the band joined by fellow coldwave bands Babyland and Deathline International. The band has recently played at the Detroit Electronic Music Festival and the Blacksun Festival. In late 2007, the band toured the US for the first time in eight years, with the supporting line-up of multi- instrumentalist/programmer Gabriel Shaw (mindFIELD), Wade Alin (Christ Analogue) and Jason Bazinet (SMP). During the spring of 2010, Chemlab toured North America with 16volt and Left Spine Down. Jared Louche announced on stage during a performance on September 7, 2012 in Chicago, that it would be the band's final show. = Later years (2012-Present) = In the spring of 2018, it was announced that Chemlab would return for Coldwaves VII in Chicago, New York and Los Angeles to perform Burn Out at the Hydrogen Bar in its entirety to commemorate the 25th anniversary of the album's release. The band also performed a number of other standalone shows. The band later released the compilation Tape Decay in 2019. This release includes unreleased tracks from the East Side Militia, Burn Out at the Hydrogen Bar and ten ton pressure cassette demos as well as new songs.

A member of two critically acclaimed music groups, Uncle Tupelo and Son Volt, he began his solo music career in 2001. Beyond his established talents as a songwriter, he is a guitarist, pianist, harmonicist, and a vocalist. Uncle Tupelo Farrar formed Uncle Tupelo with Jeff Tweedy and Mike Heidorn in 1987 after the lead singer of their previous band, The Primatives, left to attend college. The trio recorded three albums for Rockville Records, before signing with Sire Records and expanding to a five-piece. Shortly after the release of the band's major label debut album Anodyne, Farrar announced his decision to leave the band owing to a soured relationship with his co-songwriter Tweedy. Son Volt After the dissolution of Uncle Tupelo in 1994, Farrar formed the rock group Son Volt, whose original lineup released three albums in the late 1990s, before undergoing a hiatus in 1999. In 1999, Farrar was invited to participate in the tribute album for Moby Grape co-founder Skip Spence, who was terminally ill with cancer. The album, More Oar: A Tribute to the Skip Spence Album (Birdman, 1999), was an album of cover versions of the songs on Spence's only solo album, Oar (Columbia, 1999). In 2005, the band re-formed with a different lineup and has since (March 29, 2019) released six additional albums. Other In 1995, Farrar collaborated with Kelly Willis on the song \\"Rex's Blues\\", which appeared on the AIDS benefit album Red Hot + Bothered produced by the Red Hot Organization. As a solo artist, Farrar has released two full-length albums, two EPs, one film score, and various live recordings. His full-length albums are Sebastopol (2001) and Terroir Blues (2003), the first released on the independent record label Artemis Records and the second released on his own label, Transmit Sound. An EP of songs from the Sebastopol sessions, entitled ThirdShiftGrottoSlack was released in 2002. His score for the independent film The Slaughter Rule (2002, directors Alex and Andrew Smith) was released in 2003 on the independent record label Bloodshot Records. Farrar formed his own independent record label in 2003, Transmit Sound (formerly called \\"Act/Resist Records\\"). In 2004, Farrar released a six-song live acoustic EP entitled Live EP. Also 2004 marked the release of the live CD/DVD Stone, Steel & Bright Lights. Farrar worked closely with keyboardist Steven Drozd of The Flaming Lips during the recording of Sebastopol. Eric Heywood, Mark Spencer from the Blood Oranges, and the rock group Canyon have often accompanied Farrar in his solo recordings and performances. Spencer is now a full-time member of Son Volt. In 2006, Farrar announced the formation of a new band, Gob Iron, with Varnaline's Anders Parker. The songs which would make up their debut album were recorded in autumn 2004, while Farrar was in the process of recording a new Son Volt album. Farrar collaborated with Ben Gibbard (of the indie rock band Death Cab for Cutie) to create all of the music for the soundtrack for the 2009 documentary film One Fast Move or I'm Gone, about Jack Kerouac's time spent at Big Sur. The soundtrack was released on October 20, 2009. In 2012, Farrar, along with Will Johnson, Yim Yames, and Anders Parker collaborated on the Woody Guthrie archive project, New Multitudes. Style His musical style ranges from sparse, unaccompanied folk music to full rock and roll band arrangements comparable to Neil Young or Dinosaur Jr.. His solo recordings also often include sound experiments, reminiscent of psychedelia, with a distinct Eastern bent. One of the hallmarks of his sound is the use of alternate tunings on the guitar. His love for Woody Guthrie inspired a custom guitar made by Creston Lea of Vermont. The guitar was made from artifacts Jay gathered from the site of Guthrie's childhood home.

The Independent London, Gazette Section, p. 18. who served as the First Secretary of the Commmunist Party of Kazakhstan. Early life Kunaev, the son of a Kazakh clerk, was born at Verny, now Almaty, and grew up in a middle-income family. He graduated from the Institute of Non- Ferrous and Fine Metallurgy in Moscow in 1936, which enabled him to become a machine operator. By 1939 he had become engineer-in-chief of the Pribalkhashatroi mine, and joined the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU), a condition of the position.  Rise to Power  Kunaev was deputy chairman of the Council of People's Commissars of the Kazakh SSR from April 1942 to 1946. In this post, during the years of World War II, he conducted significant work on the deployment and commissioning of enterprises and factories evacuated to Kazakhstan from the front-line areas of the USSR, as well as mobilising and training the republic's human reserves and soldiers for the Red Army. From 1946 to 1952, he was deputy chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Kazakh SSR. In 1952, he was elected President of the Academy of Sciences of the Kazakh SSR, which under his leadership conducted scientific research with the aim of developing and improving industry and agriculture, and the more efficient use of Kazakhstan's natural resources. He served in this post until 1955, when he became Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Kazakh SSR. Kunaev's rise in Communist Party ranks had been closely tied to that of Leonid Brezhnev's. In February 1954, Khrushchev appointed Panteleymon Ponomarenko as the first secretary of the Communist Party of Kazakhstan, and Leonid Brezhnev as the second secretary.Dornberg, John (1991) Brezhnev: the Masks of Power, London: Andre Deutsch, , p. 133. Soon, Kunaev and Brezhnev developed a close friendship which lasted until the death of Brezhnev. Brezhnev soon became the first secretary of the Communist Party of Kazakhstan in 1955 and a member of CPSU Politburo in 1956. When Brezhnev left Kazakhstan in 1956, Ivan Iakovlev became the First Secretary of the Kazakh Communist Party (and was succeeded by Nikolai Belyaev). On January 19, 1960, Kunaev was elected 1st Secretary of the Communist Party of Kazakhstan. First Secretary As First Secretary, Kunaev was an ardent supporter of the Virgin Lands campaign, which opened millions of hectares of lands in central Kazakhstan to agricultural development and caused a large influx of Russian immigrants into Kazakhstan. However, in 1962 he was dismissed from his position as he disagreed with Khrushchev's plans to incorporate some lands in Southern Kazakhstan into Uzbekistan. Ismail Yusupov, a supporter of the plan, replaced Kunaev. After his dismissal as First Secretary, he was Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Kazakh SSR until 1964, when he became first secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Kazakhstan again in 1964 when Khrushchev was ousted and replaced by Brezhnev.Kunaev, Dinmukhammed (1992) O Moem Vremeni, Almaty: Dauir.

Kunaev awarding a Soviet Army unit's battle flag, 1986. During Kunaev's long rule, Kazakhs occupied prominent positions in the bureaucracy, economy and educational institutions. In 1984, Kunaev made Nursultan Nazarbayev the Chairman of the Council of Ministers. However, at the sixteenth session of the Communist Party of Kazakhstan in January 1986, Nazarbayev criticized Askar Kunayev, President of the Academy of Sciences for not reforming his department. Dinmukhamed Kunayev, Nazarbayev's boss and Askar's brother, felt deeply angered and betrayed. Kunayev went to Moscow and demanded Nazarbayev's dismissal while Nazarbayev's supporters campaigned for Kunayev's dismissal and Nazarbayev's promotion. However, this did not go well for Kunaev, who saw his brother dismissed as President of the Academy of Sciences (and succeeded by Murat Aitkhozhin), as well as seeing Nazarbaev keep his position as Chairman of the Council of Ministers. Soon D. A. Kunaev himself was dismissed, as he was removed from office under pressure from Mikhail Gorbachev, who accused him of corruption.\\"Memorial plaque put up in Alma-Ata for ex-communist boss\\" ITAR-TASS news agency: BBC Summary of World Broadcasts British Broadcasting Company (16 January 1995) On 16 December 1986 the Politburo replaced him with Gennady Kolbin, who had never lived in the Kazakh SSR before. The decision set off three days of street rioting in Almaty, between 16 and 18 December, 1986 - which were the first signs of ethnic strife during Gorbachev's tenure.\\"Kazakh Reformist Party for Renaming Town after Soviet-era Leader\\" Global News Wire ‚Äì Asia Africa Intelligence Wire British Broadcasting Company (23 August 2004) In modern Kazakhstan, this revolt is called Jeltoqsan (meaning December in Kazakh). In January 1987, D. A. Kunaev was removed from the Politburo of the Central Committee of the CPSU, and in June 1987 from the Central Committee of the CPSU. After the resignation, he lived in his hometown of Alma-Ata. He died in the evening of August 22, 1993 in the village of Akshi, Alakol district of Almaty region as a result of a heart attack.

A. Kunaev, a significant economic upswing in Kazakh SSR was achieved, the industrial potential of the republic increased significantly (mainly due to the mining, raw materials industries and the energy sector serving them) and agriculture (the annual famous ‚Äúbillion pounds‚Äù of grain was produced many times). In his book \\"From Stalin to Gorbachev\\" (1994), Kunaev himself referred to the data of the USSR State Statistics Committee, and he describes in detail his contribution to the development of living standards and the rise of the economy of the Kazakh SSR. By the end of Kunaev's time in power, compared with 1955, the economic potential of the Kazakh SSR increased by seven times, the standard of living, industry, production rose to a historic maximum, and the Kazakh SSR became the third largest economy in the Soviet Union (after the Russian SFSR and Ukrainian SSR).

Criticisms  The Kazakhstan leader‚Äôs name was associated with corruption and economic problems for which national newspapers criticized the republic. The Communist Party of Kazakhstan, which Kunaev headed for 22 years, criticised him for \\"establishing a personality cult, distorting personnel policy, manifestations of an 'anything goes' mentality.\\" The violations \\"led to the development . . . of protectionism, abuse of office, bribe-taking, corruption, nationalist and other negative phenomena.\\"  Awards  = Soviet = * Thrice Hero of Socialist Labour (1972, 1976, 1982) * 8 times Order of Lenin (1957, 1962, 1971, 1972, 11973, 1976, 1979, 1982) * Order of the Patriotic War of the 1st degree (1985) * Order of the Red Banner of Labour (1945) * Medal \\"For Labor Valor\\" (1959) * Medal \\"For Labor Distinction\\" (1939) = Foreign = * Order of George Dimitrov (1982, Bulgaria) * Order of Sukhbaatar (1974, Mongolia) * Order of February Victory (1982, Czechoslovakia)  Legacy  alt=Kunaev spent the last years of his life in charitable activity, establishing the 'Dinmukhamed Kunaev Foundation', one of whose purposes was the support of political reform in Kazakhstan.Ardayev, Vladimir (Izvestia staff) (24 August 1993) \\"Dinmukhamed Kunayev Dies\\" The Current Digest of the Soviet Press 45(34): p. 28 * In Almaty, a bust is installed in the square of his name.

Thus it crosses the conventional boundary between the UHF and SHF bands at 3.0 GHz. The S band is used by airport surveillance radar for air traffic control, weather radar, surface ship radar, and some communications satellites, especially those used by NASA to communicate with the Space Shuttle and the International Space Station. The 10 cm radar short-band ranges roughly from 1.55 to 5.2 GHz. The S band also contains the 2.4‚Äì2.483 GHz ISM band, widely used for low power unlicensed microwave devices such as cordless phones, wireless headphones (Bluetooth), wireless networking (WiFi), garage door openers, keyless vehicle locks, baby monitors as well as for medical diathermy machines and microwave ovens (typically at 2.495 GHz). India's regional satellite navigation network (IRNSS) broadcasts on 2.483778 to 2.500278 GHz.https://www.isro.gov.in/sites/default/files/irnss_sps_icd_version1.1-2017.pdf Satellite communications In the U.S., the FCC approved satellite-based Digital Audio Radio Service (DARS) broadcasting in the S band from 2.31 to 2.36 GHz in 1995 , currently used by Sirius XM Radio. More recently, it has approved portions of the S band between 2.0 and 2.2 GHz for the creation of Mobile Satellite Service (MSS) networks in connection with Ancillary Terrestrial Components (ATC). There have been a number of companies attempting to deploy such networks, including ICO Satellite Management (now Pendrell Corporation) and TerreStar (defunct). The 2.6 GHz range is used for China Multimedia Mobile Broadcasting, a satellite radio and mobile TV standard which, as with proprietary systems in the U.S., is incompatible with the open standards used in the rest of the world. In May 2009, Inmarsat and Solaris Mobile (a joint venture between Eutelsat and SES, now EchoStar Mobile) were awarded each a 2√ó15 MHz portion of the S band by the European Commission. The two companies are allowed two years to start providing pan-European MSS services for 18 years. Allocated frequencies are 1.98 to 2.01 GHz for Earth to space communications, and from 2.17 to 2.2 GHz for space to Earth communications. Eutelsat W2A satellite launched in April, 2009 and located at 10¬∞ East is currently the unique satellite in Europe operating on S band frequencies. In some countries, S band is used for Direct-to-Home satellite television (unlike similar services in most countries, which use Ku band). The frequency typically allocated for this service is 2.5 to 2.7 GHz (LOF 1.570 GHz). IndoStar-1 was the world's first commercial communications satellite to use S-band frequencies for broadcast (pioneered by van der Heyden), which efficiently penetrate the atmosphere and provide high-quality transmissions to small-diameter 80 cm antennas in regions that experience heavy rainfall such as Indonesia. Similar performance is not economically feasible with comparable Ku- or C-band DTH satellite systems since more power is required in these bands to penetrate the moist atmosphere. Other uses Wireless network equipment compatible with IEEE 802.11b and 802.11g standards use the 2.4 GHz section of the S band. Some digital cordless telephones operate in this band too. Microwave ovens operate at 2495 or 2450 MHz. IEEE 802.16a and 802.16e standards use a part of the frequency range of S band; under WiMAX standards most vendors are now manufacturing equipment in the range of 3.5 GHz. The exact frequency range allocated for this type of use varies between countries. In North America, is an ISM band used for unlicensed spectrum devices such as cordless phones, wireless headphones, and video senders, among other consumer electronics uses, including Bluetooth which operates between 2.402 GHz and 2.480 GHz. Amateur radio and amateur satellite operators have two S-band allocations, 13 cm (2.4 GHz) and 9 cm (3.4 GHz). Amateur television repeaters also operate in these bands. Airport surveillance radars typically operate in the 2700-2900 MHz range. Particle accelerators may be powered by S-band RF sources. The frequencies are then standardized at 2.998 GHz (Europe) or 2.856 GHz (US).https://www.jlab.org/conferences/FLS2012/talks/Thur/isu_jlab39_fls2012_57_final.PDF The National NEXRAD Radar network operates with S-band frequencies. Before implementation of this system, C-band frequencies were commonly used for weather surveillance. In the United States, the 3.55 to 3.7 GHz band is becoming shared spectrum under rules adopted by the Federal Communications Commission in April 2015 as a result of the National Broadband Plan (United States). The biggest user of CBRS (Citizens Broadband Radio service) spectrum is the United States Navy. Cable companies are planning to use the band for wireless broadband in rural areas, with Charter Communications beginning tests of the service in January 2018. Used as a transmit intermediate frequency in satellite communications as a replacement for L band where a single/shared coaxial connection is used between the modem/IDU and antenna/ODU for both the transmit and receive signals. This is to prevent interference between the transmit and receive signals which would otherwise not occur on a dual coaxial setup where the transmit and receive signals are separate and both can use the whole L-band frequency range. In a single coaxial connection using S-Band to \\"frequency shift\\" the transmit signal away from L band, a multiplier such as 10, is usually applied to form the SHF frequency. For example, the modem would transmit at 2.815 GHz IF (S Band) to the ODU and then the ODU up-converts this signal to 28.15 GHz SHF (Ka Band) towards the satellite. page=28 Optical communications S band S band is also used in optical communications to refer to the wavelength range 1460 nm to 1530 nm.

The V band is not heavily used, except for millimeter wave radar research and other kinds of scientific research. It should not be confused with the 600-1000 MHz range of Band V (Band Five) of the UHF frequency range. The V band is also used for high capacity terrestrial millimeter wave communications systems. In the United States, the Federal Communications Commission has allocated the frequency band from 57 to 71 GHz for unlicensed wireless systems.FCC Rules, Part 15.255 These systems are primarily used for high capacity, short distance (less than 1 mile) communications. In addition, frequencies at 70, 80, and 90 GHz have been allocated as \\"lightly licensed\\" bands for multi-gigabit wireless communications. All communications links in the V band require unobstructed line of sight between the transmit and receive point, and rain fade must be taken into account when performing link budget analysis.  Uses  On Dec. 15, 1995 the V band at 60 GHz was used by the world's first crosslink communication between satellites in a constellation. This communication was between the U.S. Milstar 1 and Milstar 2 military satellites. 60 GHz is attractive for secure satellite crosslinks because it allows for high data rates, narrow beams and, lying in a strong absorption band of oxygen, provides protection against intercept by ground-based adversaries. = Very short range Wi-Fi = The WiGig standard IEEE 802.11ad and IEEE 802.11ay utilize the 60 GHz (EHF microwave) spectrum with data transfer rates of up to 7 Gbit/s for very short ranges of up to = Wireless broadband = CableFree V-band High Gain Radio for Wireless Broadband applications Internet service providers are looking for ways to expand gigabit high-speed services to their customers.

It is one of the five members of the Universitaria Consortium (the group of elite Romanian universities).Consor»õiul Universitaria s-a √Æntrunit la Tulcea The University of Bucharest offers study programmes in Romanian and English and is classified as an advanced research and education university by the Ministry of Education. In the 2012 QS World University Rankings, it was included in the top 700 universities of the world, together with three other Romanian universities.Institutii de invatamant superior clasificate ca universitati de cercetare avansata si educatie History The University of Bucharest was founded by the Decree no. 765 of July 4, 1864 by Prince Alexandru Ioan Cuza and is a leading academic centre and a significant point of reference in society. The University of Bucharest is rich in history and has been actively contributing to the development and modernization of Romanian education, science, and culture since 1694. In 1694 Constantin Br√¢ncoveanu, ruler of Wallachia, had founded the Princely Academy in Bucharest with lectures delivered in Greek. In 1776, Alexander Ypsilantis, ruler of Wallachia, reformed the curriculum of the Princely Academy, where courses of French, Italian, and Latin were now taught. In 1859, the Faculty of Law was created. In 1857, Carol Davila created the University of Medicine and Pharmacy. In 1869, the Faculty of Medicine is created through the transformation of the National School of Medicine and Pharmacy. In 1857, the foundation stone of the University Palace in Bucharest was laid. The original 1857 project of the University main building, by Alexandru OrƒÉscu On July 4/16 1864, Prince Alexander John Cuza created the University of Bucharest, bringing together the Faculties of Law, Sciences and Letters as one single body. In the following years, new faculties were created: 1884 ‚Äì the Faculty of Theology; 1906 ‚Äì the Institute of Geology; 1913 ‚Äì the Academic Institute for Electrotechnology; 1921 ‚Äì the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine; 1923 ‚Äì the Faculty of Pharmacy, 1924 ‚Äì the Mina Minovici Institute of Forensic Medicine. In 1956, student leaders, mainly from this university, planned a peaceful protest against Romania's Communist regime but were forcibly prevented from carrying it out. (See Bucharest student movement of 1956) For a while (1950s‚Äìearly 1960s?), it was called the \\"C. I. Parhon University\\", after C. I. Parhon. Most of the building is still intact, however during the bombardments of Bucharest in 1944, the central corpus of the building was heavily damaged and demolished due to Luftwaffe bombs, and was only re-constructed in 1969‚Äì1971. Other sections were also completed by 1980. The area around the old University building (the University Square), adjacent to the C. A. Rosetti, Roman, KogƒÉlniceanu, and Union Squares was the scene of many riots, protests and clashes with the security forces during the Romanian Revolution of 1989. During the months of April‚ÄìJune 1990, the University of Bucharest was the centre of anti-communist protests. In 1996, Emil Constantinescu, the then rector of the University of Bucharest, was elected President of Romania, after defeating Ion Iliescu in the 1996 Romanian presidential election.

She was laid down as Auguilla Bay (AVG-58), was reclassified ACV-58 on 20 August 1942 and launched as Corregidor on 12 May 1943 by the Kaiser Shipbuilding Company, of Vancouver, Washington, under a Maritime Commission contract; sponsored by Mrs. J. Hallett. She was reclassified CVE-58 on 15 July 1943, acquired by the Navy on 31 August 1943; and commissioned the same day, Captain R. L. Bowman in command. Service history =World War II= Clearing San Diego, California on 26 October 1943, Corregidor joined Carrier Division 24 (CarDiv 24) at Pearl Harbor for air strikes in the Gilbert Islands invasion from 10 November-6 December. She returned to San Diego to undergo repairs and load aircraft and men, then resumed operations out of Pearl Harbor with her division. From 22 January-3 March 1944, she sailed in the Marshall Islands operation, providing air cover for the invasion of Kwajalein. Corregidor put to sea on 11 March 1944 for Guadalcanal, arriving there on 21 March. With the 3rd Fleet, she sortied on 30 March to provide air cover for the landings on Emirau Island, returning to Port Purvis on Florida Island on 14 April. Two days later, she sailed to join the 7th Fleet for air operations at Hollandia (currently known as Jayapura) between 22‚Äì26 April, then put into Manus Island for replenishment and antisubmarine patrols until 4 May. Embarking Commander, Carrier Division 24 for the Marianas operation, Corregidor provided combat air patrols and anti-aircraft support for the invasion of Saipan from 15‚Äì25 June, with her aircraft accounting for at least eight enemy planes. She covered the logistics force off Eniwetok from 1‚Äì3 July, then aided in the softening up bombardment of Guam and provided air cover for the invasion until 28 July, when she returned to San Diego for overhaul. She worked on qualifying pilots in carrier operations at Pearl Harbor from 12 October-21 November 1944. On 26 October, she formed as a hunter-killer group with EscDiv 64, around to check out reported enemy submarine movements between Pearl Harbor and California. On 2 January 1945, this group moved to patrol the area between Pearl Harbor and Eniwetok to protect heavy Allied shipping, returning to Pearl Harbor on 13 February. Corregidor sailed from Pearl Harbor on 27 February to search for an overdue plane carrying Lieutenant General M. F. Harmon, USA, arriving at Majuro on 20 March. From 21 March-27 April, she conducted an anti-submarine patrol in the vicinity of Japanese-held Wotje and Maloelap in the Marshalls, then off Eniwetok. Future U.S. Congressman Ralph Hall flew off the Corregidor during this time. =Post-War= Returning to Pearl Harbor on 4 May 1945, Corregidor was assigned duty as a training ship in Hawaii, conducting carrier pilot qualifications until the end of the war. From 2 October 1945 ‚Äì 10 January 1946, she alternated this duty with three voyages from Pearl Harbor to San Diego to return homeward-bound servicemen. Corregidor cleared San Diego on 18 January 1946 for Norfolk, Virginia, arriving there on 4 February. Here she was placed out of commission in reserve on 30 July 1946. =Korea= U.S. Army aircraft lift off Corregidor off Lebanon, 1958. H-34 helicopters to Bremerhaven in 1956. Recommissioned on 19 May 1951, Corregidor was assigned to operate with the Military Sea Transport Service, (later Military Sealift Command). She ferried men, aircraft, and aviation cargo to NATO nations under the Mutual Defense Assistance Plan, but also made five voyages through the Panama Canal to bring men and cargo to the United Nations forces in Korea in 1952-1954. Corregidor was reclassified T-CVU-58 on 12 June 1955. When the Lebanon crisis broke in the summer of 1958, Corregidor was at Brindisi, Italy, and immediately lifted two reconnaissance planes of the 24th Infantry Division, and 10 helicopters to support the landings in Lebanon. Returning to the United States, the ship suffered hull damage in the Atlantic Ocean due to high seas on the night of 2 April 1958.

It is based upon the BSc (Hons) Business Economics course delivered in the UK by the Westminster Business School of the University of Westminster, adapted to suit the local context. The BSc (Hons) in Economics is not intended as a purely theoretical study of economics. The underlying philosophy of the course and its presentation emphasise the application of the relevant theory underpinning the Economics and Business fields.''' *BSc (Hons) in Finance is a rigorous programme of study which will equip you with a strong financial foundation and key quantitative skills, as well as an understanding of the logic behind the use of specific finance techniques and financial decision- making at financial organisations and functions. * Bachelor of Science (Honours) in Business Information Systems (BSc Business Information Systems) :The BSc (Hons) Business Information Systems is a three-year full-time course. It is based upon the BSc (Hons) Business Computing course delivered in the UK jointly by the Harrow Business School and the Harrow School of Computer Science of the University of Westminster. The BSc (Hons) Business Information Systems aims to develop students with skills in the areas of systems analysis and database development as well as finance and marketing with an awareness of a wide range of managerial and organizational issues. The underlying philosophy of the course is to emphasise the close relationship between information technology and business with the application of the relevant theory underpinning IT enabled business practices. * Bachelor of Arts (Honours) in Commercial Law (BA Commercial Law) :The BA (Hons)Commercial Law is a three-year full-time course. The BA Commercial Law, programme consists of subject areas found on an English law degree such as that taught at the University of Westminster in London. However, at WIUT the focus in many modules is primarily Uzbek law with some English (or other legal jurisdiction) content to enable a comparison between two different legal systems. The course balances the need to provide a basic understanding of Uzbek law, with a commercial and international focus, within a broadly liberal legal curriculum. The course has been designed by the Law School of the University of Westminster; it is currently undergoing further refinements and will be focused on International and Business Law.

Originally classified as an auxiliary aircraft carrier ACV-57, the vessel was laid down in 1942, in Vancouver, Washington, by the Kaiser Shipbuilding Company. The vessel was initially named Alikula Bay, but was renamed Coral Sea and redesignated CVE-57 in 1943. Coral Sea took part in naval operations supporting attacks on the Gilbert and Marshall Islands, New Guinea and the Marianas Islands. In September 1944, the vessel was renamed Anzio. As Anzio, the escort carrier took part in assaults on the Bonin Islands and Okinawa. Following the cessation of hostilities in 1945, Anzio was among the escort carriers used in Operation Magic Carpet, returning US soldiers to the United States. Following this service, Anzio was laid up in reserve at Norfolk, Virginia, in 1946. The escort carrier was redesignated CVHE-57 on 15 June 1955, before being sold for scrap in 1959. Construction and service Originally classified as the auxiliary aircraft carrier ACV-57, the vessel's keel was laid down on 12 December 1942, by the Kaiser Shipbuilding Company at their yard in Vancouver, Washington, under a Maritime Commission (MARCOM) contract, MC hull 1094. The vessel was initially named Alikula Bay on 22 January 1943, before being renamed Coral Sea on 3 April 1943. The ship was launched on 1 May 1943, sponsored by Martha Fletcher, wife of Admiral Frank J. Fletcher. Coral Sea was redesignated CVE-57 on 15 July 1943, and commissioned at Astoria, Oregon, on 27 August 1943, Captain Herbert W. Taylor, in command. =Gilbert and Marshall Islands= On 24 September, Coral Sea departed Astoria, for shakedown in Puget Sound. The vessel arrived at San Diego, California, on 8 October, to load aircraft and hold flight operations off the California coast. The carrier sailed for Hawaii on 25 October, and upon arrival at Pearl Harbor, joined by sister ship for exercises off Oahu. On 10 November, Coral Sea steamed southwest to join the American forces about to invade the Gilbert Islands. She launched strikes on Makin Island from 20‚Äì28 November. When Tarawa Atoll had been captured, Coral Sea headed for Pearl Harbor, and arrived there on 5 December. She paused to embark passengers and load aircraft for transport to the US and departed on 8 December. She arrived at Alameda, California, on 14 December, to take on new planes. She put to sea on 22 December, and steamed back to Hawaii. On 28 December, Coral Sea anchored at Pearl Harbor, and began preparations for the impending assault on Kwajalein. Coral Sea was underway on 3 January 1944, for a series of exercises in Hawaiian waters. After final fitting out, she sailed on 22 January, in Task Group 52.9 (TG 52.9) and arrived in the vicinity of Kwajalein, on 31 January, two days after aircraft of the Fast Carrier Task Force began pounding airfields on the atoll. She provided direct and indirect air support for the amphibious landings. On 24 February, the escort carrier set course for Eniwetok, but was recalled to Hawaii, and arrived at Pearl Harbor, on 3 March. =Solomon Islands and New Guinea= After a brief respite, Coral Sea got underway again on 11 March, and proceeded to the Solomon Islands. She anchored at Tulagi, on 21 March, and resupplied before sailing again on 30 March, for Emirau Island. From 1‚Äì11 April, she launched aircraft in support of forces occupying Emirau and returned to Port Purvis on Florida Island in the Solomons on 15 April. The next day, Coral Sea left Tulagi, to assist in the reconquest of New Guinea. On 19 April, she joined TG 78.2, which was formed to support Allied footholds at Hollandia (currently known as Jayapura) and Aitape. Her aircraft joined in strikes on 22 April, and on 26 April, the escort carrier sailed to Seeadler Harbor, for replenishment, and on 7 May, headed for Espiritu Santo, for availability. =Marianas Islands and Bonin Islands operations= Following the completion of repairs, Coral Sea sailed on 8 June, for Kwajalein, the staging point for the invasion of the Marianas Islands. The American forces sortied on 10 June, and Coral Sea was among the carriers providing air support for the landings by the 2nd Marine Division on Saipan. Coral Sea endured numerous Japanese air attacks during the next few days but received only minor damage. The carrier moved south to Guam, on 17 June, to begin softening-up operations against that island but returned to Saipan, the next day to assist the bogged-down American forces. Coral Sea and her escorts retired to Eniwetok, on 28 June, but returned to Saipan, on 4 July. Her planes made further air strikes before she put into Eniwetok, on 15 July, for repairs to her engines. Ultimately, Coral Sea was ordered back to the United States, for a much needed overhaul, and the carrier sailed on 23 July. Two days later, she paused at Kwajalein, to unload most of her aircraft and ammunition and then continued via Pearl Harbor, for the naval base at San Diego. Coral Sea arrived in California, on 9 August, and entered drydock at San Diego, on 31 August. While she was still undergoing overhaul, Coral Sea received word that her name was being changed to Anzio as of 15 September. Anzio rolling in heavy seas during Typhoon Cobra Anzio held sea trials off the California coast and was ready to sail for the western Pacific on 16 September. She reached Hawaii, on 23 September, and entered Pearl Harbor, for a tender availability. On 8 October, the carrier began a series of training exercises, and on 16 October, she set out for Eniwetok. There, Anzio joined a hunter/killer group and carried out an antisubmarine warfare (ASW) mission while she was en route to Ulithi. On 4 November, she was ordered to assist the light cruiser which had been torpedoed in the Philippine Sea. When Anzio was relieved by , she resumed her ASW patrols and worked at that task through mid-February 1945, when she steamed to Iwo Jima. Anzio resumed combat support operations on 16 February. Three days later, she launched a strike to the north on Chichi Jima, in the Bonin Islands. From 19 February-4 March, she followed a schedule of launching her first flight just before sunset and recovering her last just after dawn. During these nocturnal operations, she completed 106 sorties without a single accident. She departed the Iwo Jima area on 8 March, and entered San Pedro Bay, at Leyte, on 12 March. After 10 days of upkeep and being joined by a newly redeployed VC-13 from , she sailed to join the invasion of Okinawa. =Okinawa and post war= After providing air cover for an Okinawa-bound amphibious group, Anzio joined other forces in the vicinity of Kerama Retto, in seizing that island group to provide an advanced base for the Fleet. The Okinawa attack began on 1 April, and she remained on line until she retired to Ulithi, on 30 April, for repairs to her rudder bearings. On 21 May, the carrier resumed ASW operations in the Okinawa area. This role ended on 17 June, when she sailed to San Pedro Bay, Leyte, for upkeep. Anzio left the Philippines, on 6 July, to begin what proved to be her last stint of combat duty. She joined TG 30.8 and positioned herself about east of Tokyo. She made ASW patrols in support of Admiral William Halsey's attacks on the Japanese home islands. She received word of the Japanese capitulation on 15 August, and sailed for Guam, on 19 August. After refitting and training new flight crews, the escort carrier headed for Okinawa. From that point, she was to provide air cover and ASW patrol services for transports carrying occupation troops to Korea. On 8 September, she anchored at Jinsen, Korea, whence she provided air support for the landings of the occupation force. She left Korea, on 13 September, and returned to Okinawa. On 19 September, she broke her homeward- bound pennant, became a member of a Magic Carpet group, and reached San Francisco, on 30 September. While at San Francisco, Anzio was modified to provide maximum passenger accommodations. The carrier made two trips to the western Pacific and back, one to Pearl Harbor, and one to Shanghai, China, to shuttle American troops home as part of Operation Magic Carpet. She arrived at Seattle, Washington, on 23 December, and ended the year at that port. On 18 January 1946, Anzio sailed for Norfolk, Virginia. She paused at San Francisco, then continued southward to transit the Panama Canal before finally reaching the east coast. Anzio was placed out of commission on 5 August, and became a unit of the Atlantic Reserve Fleet berthed at Norfolk. The ship was redesignated CVHE-57 on 15 June 1955. Anzio was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 1 March 1959, and sold to Master Metals Co., on 24 November, for scrapping. Awards Coral Sea/Anzio received eleven Navy Unit Commendations and nine battle stars for service in World War II. The Secretary of the Navy commended the men of Anzio \\"For outstanding heroism in action against enemy Japanese forces in the air, ashore and afloat. Operating in the most advanced areas\\" References  Bibliography   * * External links * Category:Casablanca-class escort carriers Category:World War II escort aircraft carriers of the United States Category:Ships built in Vancouver, Washington Category:1943 ships ","title":"USS Anzio (CVE-57)"},{"id":"553995","text":"USS Cape Esperance (CVE-88) was a of the United States Navy. She was named after the Battle of Cape Esperance, an inconclusive naval engagement in support of the Guadalcanal campaign. Built for service during World War II, the ship was launched in March 1944, and commissioned in April, and served as a replenishment carrier. Postwar, she participated in Operation Magic Carpet. She was decommissioned in August 1946, when she was mothballed in the Pacific Reserve Fleet. However, she was recommissioned in August 1950, and assigned to become an auxiliary vessel as a part of Military Sealift Command. She was decommissioned again in January 1959, and ultimately, she was sold for scrapping in May 1959. Design and description A profile of the design of , which was shared with all Casablanca-class escort carriers. Cape Esperance was a Casablanca-class escort carrier, the most numerous type of aircraft carriers ever built, and designed specifically to be mass-produced using prefabricated sections, in order to replace heavy war losses sustained in the early engagements of the Pacific War. Standardized with her sister ships, she was long overall, had a beam of , and a draft of . She displaced standard, with a full load. She had a long hangar deck and a long flight deck. She was powered with two Skinner Unaflow reciprocating steam engines, which drove two shafts, providing , thus enabling her to make . The ship had a cruising range of at a speed of . Her compact size necessitated the installment of an aircraft catapult at her bow, and there were two aircraft elevators to facilitate movement of aircraft between the flight and hangar deck: one each fore and aft. One /38 caliber dual-purpose gun was mounted on the stern. Anti-aircraft defense was provided by 8 Bofors anti-aircraft guns in single mounts, as well as 12 Oerlikon cannons, which were mounted around the perimeter of the deck. By the end of the war, Casablanca-class carriers had been modified to carry thirty 20-mm cannons, and the amount of 40-mm guns had been doubled to sixteen, by putting them into twin mounts. These modifications were in response to increasing casualties due to kamikaze attacks. Casablanca-class escort carriers were designed to carry 27 aircraft, but the hangar deck could accommodate more. Due to Cape Esperance serving as a replenishment of transport carrier throughout most of her time in service, it frequently carried up to sixty aircraft during these missions, around the maximum amount at which the flight deck would still be functional. She was designed to accommodate 764 crew, but in wartime, her complement inevitably crept over that number. A reasonable estimate puts the number of crew typically onboard a Casablanca-class escort carrier at around 910 to 916 men. Construction Her construction was awarded to Kaiser Shipbuilding Company, Vancouver, Washington under a Maritime Commission contract, on 18 June 1942, under the name Tananek Bay (a misspelling of \\"Tonowek Bay\\"), as part of a tradition which named escort carriers after bays or sounds in Alaska. The escort carrier was laid down on 11 December 1943, MC hull 1125, the thirty-fourth of a series of fifty Casablanca-class escort carriers. She therefore received the classification symbol CVE-88. On 6 November 1943, she was renamed Cape Esperance, as part of a new naval policy which named subsequent Casablanca-class carriers after naval or land engagements. She was named after the Battle of Cape Esperance, an early and inconclusive naval battle fought in support of the Guadalcanal campaign. She was launched on 3 March 1944; sponsored by Mrs. W. M. McDade; transferred to the United States Navy and commissioned on 9 April 1944, with Captain Robert Wurts Bockius in command. Service history =World War II= The sailing log of Cape Esperance, published in May 1946. Upon being commissioned, Cape Esperance underwent a shakedown cruise down the West Coast to San Diego. She then underwent two transport missions, ferrying new aircraft to bases in the South and West Pacific, and returning to the West Coast with damaged aircraft. After returning from her second transport run, she was assigned to Task Group 30.8, the replenishment escort carrier group. She was loaded with replacement aircraft at San Francisco, and departed on 5 October 1944. She rendezvoused with the other replenishment carriers on 2 November, and provided replacement aircraft to the Fast Carrier Task Force operating against Japanese positions on Leyte and Luzon. The replenishment carriers would meet with the frontline carriers at designated rendezvous days, during which supplies and aircraft would be transferred. She was based from and received additional replacement aircraft at Ulithi and Guam. The Third Fleet had been operating against positions on Luzon since 14 December, but its escorting destroyers ran low on fuel. As a result, the fleet retired to the east to refuel, and to receive replacement aircraft from Task Group 30.8. As a part of Task Unit 30.8.14, she rendezvoused with the Third Fleet about east of Luzon early on 17 December. Cape Esperance was carrying thirty-nine planes on her flight deck, along with another twelve stored in her hangar deck. The location had been chosen because it lay out of range of Japanese fighters, but it also happened to lie within Typhoon Alley, where many Pacific tropical cyclones transited. As the escort carriers and the Third Fleet met, Typhoon Cobra began to bear down. At 01:00 in the night, fueling operations were attempted with the destroyers, although heavy winds and listing seas complicated the matter. At the same time, barometers on-board the ships began to drop, and tropical storm force winds were recorded. A radar image of Typhoon Cobra, 18 December 1944. As the weather continued to deteriorate, Admiral William Halsey Jr. ordered fueling operations suspended at 13:10, just after noon. He ordered his fleet to move to the next morning's planned rendezvous spot, approximately northwest, and comfortably safe from the typhoon's impacts. Two hours later, he instead ordered his fleet to proceed due southwards, from where the fleet was located. This brought the fleet directly into the typhoon's core. To make matters worse for the Third Fleet, Halsey ordered the fleet to proceed northwards at 22:20, putting the fleet in the quadrant of the typhoon with the highest winds. Blurry data and observations meant that command had little idea of where the typhoon actually was, with some weather maps pinning the typhoon's center some away, even whilst the fleet sailed directly into the eye. Attached to the Third Fleet, Cape Esperance followed, although Captain Bockius had begun preparations on 17 December. The aircraft on the flight deck had been tied down, weight had been transferred downwards to lower the ship's center of gravity, the hatches had been battened down, and the crew had been informed to stay on the port side of the carrier to counteract any list in the ship. The ship's aircraft elevators had also been lowered, in the hopes that this transferred weight would negate the lists generated from the wind. At 07:00, on the morning of 18 December, the fleet was inescapably trapped in the typhoon's path. Conflicting orders meant that some of the destroyers attempted to do some fueling during the morning, even as waves with an estimated height of pounded the task force. At 09:52, Cape Esperance began maneuvering independently of the task force. Multiple rolls of 36¬∞ were recorded, and the occasional roll of 39¬∞ frightened the ship's command. The ship's officers began discussing the possibility of jettisoning the aircraft on the flight deck to make the ship less top-heavy, before discarding the idea. The typhoon's winds solved the weight problem, by ripping the aircraft on the flight deck from their restraints, and carrying them into the ocean. However, at 12:28, an aircraft ended up stuck on the forward starboard stack, and caught on fire, forcing an evacuation of the bridge. Fortunately for the crew, as the carrier rocked and yawed, the plane was dislodged and carried overboard. The fire sparked by the aircraft, which had threatened to become a conflagration because of the aircraft's fuel tanks, ended up being extinguished by the rain. The loss of most of the planes on the flight deck meant that Cape Esperance no longer threatened to keel over. At 16:00, another plane on the flight deck broke loose, and plummeted through the open forward aircraft elevator, landing on another plane. Fortunately for the crew, a fire did not result from this collision. As the carrier emerged from the typhoon, of the thirty-nine aircraft fastened to the flight deck, only seven remained. Although all of the planes in the hangar deck survived, eight planes were struck due to damage. As a result, she only had eleven replacement planes which she could deliver to the battered Third Fleet. Although 790 crewmen perished in the typhoon, none were from Cape Esperance. Her flight deck, damaged by the blaze, required major repairs. She continued her duties as a replenishment carrier through the New Year, although repairs were made at bases in Guam and Ulithi. She retired from the replenishment carrier fleet in February 1945, heading back to the West Coast. There, she loaded aircraft, which she ferried to Guam. Until news of the surrender of Japan broke, she acted as a transport carrier, transporting newly minted aircraft from the United States to the West Pacific, in order to replace heavy war losses over Okinawa and the Japanese home islands. Whilst she was transporting aircraft, Captain Patrick Henry, Jr. took over command of the vessel on 3 May. =Post- war and Cold War= F-86 Sabre fighters arrive in Korea onboard Cape Esperance, November 1950. Cape Esperance transporting aircraft to Korea, 1951. Following the end of the war, she joined the Operation Magic Carpet fleet, which repatriated U.S. servicemen from around the Pacific. She first made a run from San Diego to Pearl Harbor, ferrying aircraft and veterans to San Francisco, where she arrived on 11 September 1945. Until mid-1946, she made several such Magic Carpet runs, touching stops throughout the Pacific. After being released from the Magic Carpet fleet, she proceeded to Bremerton, Washington, where she was decommissioned on 22 August 1946, and subsequently mothballed in the Pacific Reserve Fleet. Cape Esperance was recommissioned on 5 August 1950 under the identification T-CVE-88, as an aircraft transport carrier serving under the Military Sealift Command. Most of her weapons were stripped from her hull, and she was operated by a mostly civilian crew. Immediately after being recommissioned, she began delivering aircraft to Japan, where they would participant in the Korean War. For the next nine years, Cape Esperance fulfilled a variety of duties, including supporting nuclear tests at Eniwetok, and ferrying aircraft to the Royal Thai Air Force. She engaged in an average of nine transpacific voyages per year, reinforcing forces of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization, as well as U.S. assets in the Pacific. In 1952, she steamed for Hong Kong, where she evacuated planes of the Republic of China Air Force which were in danger of being seized by advancing PLA forces. She was reclassified as a utility aircraft transport carrier, T-CVU-55, on 12 June 1955, and began conducting transatlantic voyages, ferrying aircraft to bases in Western Europe. She then returned to the Pacific, and proceeded to transport aircraft to Pakistan in 1956. She was decommissioned a second time on 15 January 1959, as the operation of Casablanca-class escort carriers became less and less economical. She was abandoned in favor of s, who served for another decade as transport carriers, before they too became obsolete and uneconomical. She was sold for scrapping on 14 May 1959, and ultimately broken up in Japan throughout January 1961.

She was laid down under a Maritime Commission contract (MC hull 1102) on 6 February 1943 at Vancouver, Washington, by the Kaiser Shipyards; launched on 15 September 1943, sponsored by Mrs. Frederick Carl Sherman, the wife of Rear Admiral Frederick Sherman; and commissioned on 7 November 1943, with Captain Hames R. Tague in command. Service history =World War II= Atlantic Following commissioning, Wake Island received supplies, ammunition, and gasoline at Astoria, Oregon, and got underway on 27 November 1943 for Puget Sound and anchored the following day at Bremerton, Washington, where she continued to load supplies and ammunition. The carrier operated in the Puget Sound area conducting structural firing tests and making stops at Port Townsend, Sinclair Inlet, and Seattle before sailing south on 6 December. She arrived at San Francisco, California on 10 December, took on fuel, and, two days later, headed for San Diego, arriving there on 14 December for shakedown and availability. Before departing, the carrier took on board the personnel and planes of Composite Squadron 69 (VC-69). On 11 January 1944, Wake Island got underway and steamed, via the Panama Canal, to Hampton Roads, Virginia, arriving at Norfolk, Virginia on 26 January. Following availability, the carrier sailed on 14 February for New York City in company with , , and . On 16 February, after loading supplies and embarking Army and Navy officers for transportation, Wake Island set course for Recife, Brazil, the first stop on her voyage to Karachi, India. She arrived at Recife on 1 March and made stops at Cape Town, South Africa, and Diego Suarez Harbor, Madagascar, before arriving at Karachi on 29 March. The carrier began her return trip on 3 April and arrived back at Norfolk on 12 May. She spent the remainder of May and part of June undergoing alterations and an overhaul. She then took on board the planes and personnel of VC-58 and, on 15 June, set course toward Bermuda for duty as the nucleus of Task Group 22.6 (TG 22.6), a combined, air-and-surface, anti-submarine, hunter-killer group. The highlight of her cruise came on 2 July, when one of her Grumman TBM Avengers intercepted the off the coast of Africa between the Canary and Cape Verde Islands, making its way home after an unsuccessful patrol in the Gulf of Guinea. The pilot, Ensign Frederick L. Moore, braved heavy anti-aircraft fire from U-543, while making two bombing attacks which sank the U-boat. However, no evidence appeared to confirm the kill, so the carrier and her escorts spent the next two weeks hunting the already-destroyed submarine. TG 22.6 began her next serious encounter with the enemy two minutes before noon on 2 August, when sighted a U-boat's conning tower some eight miles (13 km) away. She and were detached to investigate, while all planes in the area were recalled. An Avenger, armed with depth bombs, was catapulted at 1209. At 1235, a torpedo, apparently fired by a second submarine, hit Fiske midships and broke her in two. The ships of the group managed to maneuver clear of two more torpedoes which were fired at the force. The first report of casualties listed 4 dead, 26 missing, and 55 seriously injured. was detached to support Howard and later to pick up survivors. As the group was preparing to avenge the loss of Fiske, heavy fog and rain stopped all operations. Wake Island underway in Hampton Roads, 9 November 1944 On 4 August, TG 22.6 was dissolved, and four days later, Wake Island made rendezvous with Convoy UC-32 as it steamed westward. She left the convoy on the 11th and headed for Hampton Roads. She arrived at Norfolk on the 15th for alterations and repairs which lasted through the 25th. Following post-repair trials and a brief availability, the escort carrier sailed on 29 August for Quonset Point, Rhode Island, to relieve on carrier aircraft qualification operation duty which lasted until 30 October. The next day, the carrier sailed for Norfolk with and as escorts, and arrived on 1 November for a period of availability. Pacific =Philippines= On the 11th, she stood out of Norfolk in company with and escorts bound via the Panama Canal for the west coast. The carrier entered San Francisco Bay on 28 November, and moored at the Naval Air Station Alameda, California, where she embarked two new aircraft squadrons before heading for Hawaii the following day. She moored at Ford Island, Pearl Harbor on 5 December, detached squadrons VC-9 and VPB-149, and disembarked personnel, planes, and equipment. Ten days later, Wake Island, her flight deck laden with cargo and unable to launch or receive planes, got underway for the Admiralty Islands with escorts and . She arrived at Manus Island on 27 December, discharged all cargo and passengers, sailed for the Palau Islands, and arrived at Kossol Roads on New Year's Day 1945. Late that evening, she loaded ammunition from a barge and got underway at 0642, bound for the Philippines and the forthcoming invasion of Luzon, in company with a tremendous fleet which had gathered for the operation. Two days later, Wake Island passed through Surigao Strait and launched both SNAP (anti- snooper air patrol) and LCAP (local combat air patrol) aircraft. On 4 January 1945, she was operating in the Sulu Sea and launched a three-hour SNAP. The American planes sighted a single-engine Japanese float plane on the water off the southeastern tip of Panay Island. It appeared to be in the hands of a salvage crew. Two of the scout planes made two strafing runs each and left the plane riddled and the salvage crew dispersed. The Fleet entered Panay Gulf about 100 miles (160 km) southeast of Manila. Wake Island's surface search radar was jammed by enemy transmission, and the escort carrier went to general quarters at 1714. One minute later, a Japanese single-engine plane appeared overhead in a steep diving attack on , some away. Fire immediately flared from that carrier's flight and hangar decks, and after 20 minutes, her crew abandoned Ommaney Bay under a dense cloud of black smoke. She burned with explosions of ammunition and was finally scuttled astern of the fleet by a torpedo from an American destroyer. On 5 January, Wake Island received 19 survivors of Ommaney Bay who had been rescued by . The ship went to general quarters with bogies on the radar screen, but three threatened raids failed to develop. At 1502, eight LCAP fighters from Wake Island pounced upon a division of Japanese Army fighters. When the melee was over, the Americans claimed three certain kills and a probable without suffering any loss themselves. In all, Wake Island launched three LCAP's during daylight. At 1655, the ship again went to general quarters to repel an air attack and for the next hour was under severe attack. At one time, six single-engine planes were simultaneously diving on carriers off Wake Islands port side. Five were knocked down by anti-aircraft fire, narrowly missing their targets, but one managed a hit on . She caught fire and dropped behind, but her efficient damage control efforts enabled her to resume her position in the formation in only 51 minutes, with her flight deck out of commission. During the attack, at least 10 enemy planes splashed within of Wake Island, and her own anti- aircraft gunners claimed three. On 13 January, two enemy planes attacked , cruising about eight miles (13 km) astern of Wake Island. One of the attackers was shot down, but the other scored a hit which briefly slowed that carrier. She soon regained speed and controlled a fire on her hangar deck without losing her position in the formation. Four days later, Wake Island was detached and left Lingayen Gulf in TG 77.14, a force consisting of eight escort carriers and their screen to retire to Ulithi, Caroline Islands. She anchored at Ulithi's southern anchorage from 23‚Äì31 January, undergoing availability and preparing for further operations. During this period, her home port was changed from Norfolk to Puget Sound, Bremerton, Washington. =Iwo Jima= On 10 February 1945, the carrier got underway to join TG 52.2, which had been established to provide air cover and support while escorting major units to the Volcano Islands and then to furnish naval gunfire, spotting, and direct air support for landing forces. The following day, she steamed to an area off Saipan-Tinian where rehearsals for the invasion took place. On 13 February, Wake Islands commanding officer was designated OTC of Task Unit 52.2.1 (TU 52.2.1). On 14 February, the carrier set course for Iwo Jima and, two days later, arrived at her operating area 49 miles (79 km) from the southwestern tip of Iwo Jima. Shortly after daylight, the heavy bombardment group began shelling shore installations on the island. Planes from Wake Island flew spotting sorties, attacked defensive works with rocket fire, and flew local antisubmarine patrols and hydrographic observation flights over the beaches. D-day for the invasion of Iwo Jima was 19 February; and on that day, Wake Island operated as before, flying 56 spotting sorties and firing 87 rockets. , a carrier in her group, was sunk by a kamikaze attack on 21 February. The next day, Wake Island was detached and ordered to proceed to a rendezvous point east of Iwo Jima. There, she refueled on 23 February and set course to return to the operating area east of Iwo Jima. The following day, she took station some 35 miles (56 km) from the southern tip of Iwo Jima and flew 55 spotting sorties, expending 205 rockets. In the ensuing weeks, Wake Island continued her operations supporting the Marines. On 5 March, she received a message of special interest from Commander, TU 52.2.1, Rear Admiral Clifton Sprague: \\"If your ship is as good as your Air Department and Squadron, it is a standout. I have seen nearly all the combat CVEs' work and I must say the Wake tops them all for efficiency, smoothness and good judgement. I hope we are together again.\\" After 24 consecutive days of operations, Wake Island retired on 8 March from her station off Iwo Jima and rendezvoused with west of the island. The next day, they headed for Ulithi and arrived there on 14 March. =Okinawa= The carrier spent the next five days at anchor, preparing for another operation. She got underway on 21 March to supply air support for forces about to invade Okinawa. On 25 March, she arrived in the operating area roughly 60 miles (100 km) south of Okinawa Jima and began sending flights over Kerama Retto beaches and Okinawa. Wake Island continued her support of the campaign through the initial landings at Okinawa on 1 April. On the 3rd, the carrier was operating southeast of Okinawa. At 1722, she completed the landing of her fifth spotting sortie, and all her planes were back on board. Eight minutes later, she went to general quarters, and enemy bogies were reported. At 1742, a violent wave hit the ship while planes were being moved for spotting on the flight deck. Two General Motors FM-2 Wildcats were thrown off the flight deck into the water. Two fighters were flipped over on their backs, and two others received severe damage when tossed about. At the same instant, two Wildcats broke loose from their lashings on the hangar deck and collided, with major damage to both. At 1744, a Japanese single-engine aircraft plunged at the ship from a high angle and missed the port forward corner of the flight deck, exploding in the water abreast the forecastle. Thirty seconds later, a second similar aircraft whistled down on the starboard side at tremendous speed, narrowly missing the bridge structure and plunging into the water about 10 feet (3 m) from the hull. The aircraft exploded after impact, ripping a hole in the ship's side below the waterline, about 45 feet (14 m) long and about 18 feet (5.5 m) from top to bottom, and making many shrapnel holes. Parts of the aircraft were thrown onto the forecastle and into the gun sponsons. Various compartments were flooded, and the shell plating cracked between the first and second decks. Other shell plating buckled, and the main condensers were flooded with salt water, contaminating some 30,000 US gallons (110 m¬≥) of fresh water and 70,000 US gallons (260 m¬≥) of fuel oil. At 1824, salting made it necessary to secure the forward engine, and the ship proceeded on one propeller. Remarkably, there were no injuries; and, by 2140, corrective measures had been taken, and the ship was again steaming on both engines. The next day, Wake Island steamed to Kerama Retto anchorage with and . While she remained there undergoing inspection by the fleet salvage officer, special precautions were taken to guard against possible Japanese suicide swimmers from islands of the cluster not yet secured. The carrier set course for Guam on 6 April 1945, and, four days later arrived at Apra Harbor for repairs in drydock which lasted through 20 May. The next day, the ship, in company with , headed for Okinawa where she resumed her mission of supporting the troops on the island. Wake Island was then detached on 2 June, and escorted by , proceeded to Kerama Retto for replenishment. At Kaika Harbor, Kerama Retto, she loaded bombs, rockets, and dry and fresh provisions, despite many enemy aircraft in the vicinity. The carrier made rendezvous with for refueling, and once her tanks were full, returned to the operating area off Okinawa on 6 June 1945. The following day, Wake Island, as part of the task unit, engaged in strikes on Sakashima Gunto. was hit by a kamikaze, and was attacked by a second. Wake Island continued on support operations until 15 June when Rear Admiral Durgin landed on the carrier for an official visit. In a ceremony held on the flight deck, he presented citations and awards to 16 pilots of VOC-1. The following day, Wake Island and Dennis were detached, proceeded independently for Kerama Retto, and arrived there on 17 June. She was replenished and then returned to the area southwest of Okinawa to resume flight operations. Two days later, Wake Island received a message detaching her from TG 32.1 due to battle damage received on 3 April and a subsequent finding by the Bureau of Ships that \\"pending yardwork, this vessel is considered unsafe for operations in a forward area.\\" She headed for Guam and conducted firing practices and launched LASP sorties en route. Upon her arrival at Port Apra on 24 June, all personnel of squadron VOC-1 were transferred to Naval Air Base Agana. From 25 June-3 July, Wake Island, loaded with nine Grumman F6F Hellcats, 24 Vought F4U Corsairs, 11 Avengers, and two Piper L-4s, made a round-trip to Okinawa and delivered aircraft with 46 ferry pilots to Tactical Air Force, Yontan Field, Okinawa. Arriving back at Guam, the carrier unloaded ammunition and aviation spares and took on board 300 sacks of United States mail along with 10 Corsair and 20 Curtiss SB2C Helldiver duds for transportation, then sailed for Pearl Harbor in company with and . On 10 July, she detached Bull and Cape Esperance and proceeded independently to Hawaii. A week later, the ship arrived at Ford Island, Pearl Harbor, where she unloaded her cargo and took on board 138 enlisted men and 49 officers as passengers to the continental United States. On 18 July, Wake Island cleared the channel at Pearl Harbor, bound for southern California. She arrived at San Diego, California on 25 July, and discharged her passengers and planes. =Post-War= While moored at North Island, San Diego, the carrier took on board six Avengers, 10 Wildcats, 53 officers, and 13 men of VC-75 for training and carrier aircraft landing qualifications off San Nicholas Island. She continued to conduct flight qualifications through December 1945. This period was distinguished on 6 November when the first jet-propelled landing on an aircraft carrier was made on Wake Island. Personnel of VF-41 and representatives of Ryan Aeronautical came on board during the morning of 5 November, and the escort carrier got underway from the Naval Air Station, San Diego, in company with . For two days, she conducted tests and landing qualifications for the FR Fireball. Ensign J. C. West took off from the USS Wake Island in a Ryan FR-1 Fireball, a combination prop-jet design, and soon experienced problems with the Wright R-1820-72W Cyclone radial piston engine. Before the reciprocating powerplant failed completely, he started the General Electric I-16 jet engine and returned to the ship, thus making the first ever landing by jet power alone on a carrier.Jones, Lloyd S., \\"U. S. Naval Fighters: Navy/Marine Corps 1922 to 1980s\\", Aero Publishers, Inc., Fallbrook, California, 1977, Library of Congress card number 77-20693, , page 218. In 1946, Wake Island prepared for inactivation. She was decommissioned on 5 April; struck from the Naval Vessel Register on the 17th; and subsequently sold for scrap to the Boston Metals Company, Baltimore, Maryland, on 19 April 1946.

She was laid down on 11 February 1943 at Vancouver, Washington, by the Kaiser Shipbuilding Company, Inc., under a Maritime Commission contract (MC hull 1103) as Elbour Bay (ACV-66); renamed White Plains on 3 April 1943; redesignated CVE-66 on 15 July 1943; launched on 27 September 1943; sponsored by Mrs. Marc A. Mitscher; delivered to the Navy on 15 November 1943 at Astoria, Oregon; and commissioned that same day, Captain Oscar A. Weller in command. Service history =World War II= The USS White Plains completed her outfitting at Astoria, Oregon, on 4 December 1943, and then she began shakedown training on 8 December. At the conclusion of her initial cruise, the warship entered San Diego on 21 December. On 30 December, she returned to sea, bound for the Gilbert Islands. She arrived at Tarawa Atoll on 11 January 1944 and unloaded the aircraft she had transported. On 17 January, the ship headed back to Oahu, arriving in Pearl Harbor six days later. Following a four-day turnaround period, the White Plains again set course for the Central Pacific to provide aircraft logistics support for the Marshall Islands operation. By the time she reached Tarawa on 3 February, the undefended Majuro Atoll had been occupied, and the Japanese garrison at Kwajalein Atoll had been all but subdued. On the next day, she got underway for Majuro where she arrived on 5 February. From there, the escort carrier moved on to Kwajalein for a brief visit before heading back to Hawaii. The White Plains stopped briefly at Oahu before continuing on toward the West Coast on 23 February. She arrived at Alameda, California, on San Francisco Bay on 3 March. While off the West Coast, the White Plains conducted operational training for her own ship's company and carrier qualifications for three air squadrons. In April, she embarked her own permanently assigned air unit, Composite Squadron 4 (VC-4), composed of 16 Grumman F4F Wildcat fighters and 12 Grumman TBM Avenger torpedo planes. She departed the West Coast from the San Diego Naval Base on 24 April, and she arrived at Pearl Harbor on 1 May. During the next month, the White Plains conducted air operations and amphibious support training out of Pearl Harbor. At the end of May, the White Plains steamed out of port in company with units of the Task Forces assembled to invade the Mariana Islands. The portion of the Fleet containing the White Plains sortied from Eniwetok Atoll, and during the voyage from there to the Marianas, her aircraft provided antisubmarine warfare patrols and part of the combat air patrol. During the assault on Saipan, her planes continued to cover the Fleet against submarine and air attack, strafed the beaches, and spotted shellfire for gunfire support ships. They helped repulse at least three major enemy air attacks. On 17 June, while helping to fight off those raids, her antiaircraft gunners earned their first definite kill. Later, VC-4 Avengers successfully torpedoed an enemy transport during a sweep of the island of Rota. The USS White Plains departed the combat zone on 2 July but, after a week at Eniwetok, returned to the Marianas with her air squadron upgraded to a total of 28 aircraft. During her second tour of duty in the Marianas, the escort carrier supported the Tinian assault late in July. Her planes carried out sortie after sortie in support of the troops ashore and over the ships assembled, but the White Plains herself suffered no enemy attacks. Her heavy flight schedule proved grueling to air squadron and ship's company alike. She completed her participation during the first week in August and departed the Marianas and headed for Espiritu Santo in the New Hebrides. She arrived in Segond Channel on 16 August and began preparations for the invasion of the Palau Islands. Those preparations included amphibious support training in the Solomon Islands. The White Plains and ten other aircraft carriers moved into the vicinity of the Palaus during the second week of September. Their planes provided a portion of the prelanding bombardment and support for the troops after the assault on 15 September. In contrast to the Marianas campaign and later operations, the Palaus, though extremely difficult on the troops ashore, brought little opposition to the ships in the waters surrounding the islands. No enemy air attacks developed because the Japanese were husbanding their aircraft for the defense of the Philippines, and as a result of Japan's new strategic concept of defense in depth at some distance from the beaches, few shore batteries were sited near enough to the coast to fire upon ships. On 21 September, the White Plains joined the forces detached from the Palau operation for the occupation of Ulithi Atoll, which to everyone's relief, was undefended. Battle of Leyte Gulf Tokkotai unit 25 October 1944. The aircraft in the photograph missed the carrier and struck the water. In October 1944, after repairs at the naval base at Manus Island in the Admiralty Islands, USS White Plains headed for the invasion of the Philippines at Leyte. The initial assault went forward on 20 October. Aircraft from White Plains provided air support for the troops and ASW and combat air patrols for the ships assembled in Leyte Gulf. However, because of the strategic importance of the Philippines which lay athwart their lines of communication with the East Indies, the Japanese chose to oppose the landings with their surface fleet. They launched their surface counterattack in three distinct phases. While a decoy force of carriers under Admiral Jisabur≈ç Ozawa moved south from Japan in an attempt to draw off Halsey's Third Fleet and the large carriers, the forces under Vice Admirals Sh≈çji Nishimura and Kiyohide Shima attempted to force the Surigao Strait from the south, and Vice Admiral Takeo Kurita's Center Force tried to sneak through the Central Philippines and transit the hopefully unguarded San Bernardino Strait. The Center Force, by far the strongest of the enemy fleets involved, consisted of five battleships - including the huge superbattleships and - 11 heavy cruisers, two light cruisers, and 19 destroyers. By the time Kurita's Center Force cleared the San Bernardino Strait on 25 October, it had been reduced by four heavy cruisers and the battleship Musashi. Three heavy cruisers had fallen prey to American submarine attacks in Palawan Passage on 23 October, and Musashi and succumbed to Task Force 38's air attacks in the Sibuyan Sea on the following day. Musashi sank there, and My≈çk≈ç headed back to Brunei Bay, heavily damaged. In addition, on the night of 24 October and 25 October, Vice Admiral Oldendorf's old battleships in Leyte Gulf obliterated Nishimura's force and sent Shima's packing. In the meantime, after Admiral Halsey received information indicating that a battered Center Force had begun retirement, Ozawa's decoy force finally managed to draw the American carriers off to the north. However, Kurita's retrograde movement proved to be only temporary, and he once again reversed course and headed back toward San Bernardino Strait. With Oldendorf regrouping his warships in Leyte Gulf and Halsey off chasing the Japanese Navy's aircraft carriers, only three Task Groups‚Äîcomposed of escort carriers, destroyers, and destroyer escorts‚Äîremained off Samar island between Kurita and Leyte Gulf. USS White Plains was an element of \\"Taffy 3,\\" the northmost of the three Task Groups, and the one which bore the brunt of Kurita's surface onslaught. \\"Taffy 3\\", commanded by Rear Admiral Clifton Sprague, first learned of Kurita's presence when, at 0637, a pilot on routine air patrol spotted Kurita's task force and attacked it with depth charges. Rear Admiral Sprague was incredulous about the presence of the Japanese Navy, and he demanded identification verification‚Äîwhich came, disconcertingly enough, when the enemy battleships' pagoda-style masts loomed over the horizon. Yamato opened fire at 0659 at an estimated range of 34,544 yards, targeting White Plains with her first four salvoes. Yamato's third salvo was a close straddle landing at 07:04. One shell from this salvo exploded beneath the turn of White Plains port bilge near frame 142, near her aft (starboard) engine room. While the ship was not struck directly, the mining effect of the under-keel explosion severely damaged her hull, deranged her starboard machinery and tripped all of the circuit breakers in her electrical network. Prompt and effective damage control restored power and communications within three minutes and she was able to remain in formation by overspeeding her port engine to compensate. The black smoke resulting from the sudden loss of boiler intake air pressure convinced Yamato and Nagato (which was also firing her main battery at White Plains at the time) that they had scored a direct hit and they shifted fire to other targets. For the next two and one-half hours, the Japanese force chased \\"Taffy 3\\" southward and subjected the escort carriers and their counterattacking screen to a heavy-caliber cannonade. The aircraft carriers' warplanes fought back, even making dummy runs on the Japanese ships to slow the ships' speed of advance after expending all their bombs, torpedoes, and ammunition. During their counterattacks, the USS , , and were sunk by gunfire. Later, USS was sunk by gunfire as well, while USS , USS , , and suffered heavy damage. During the surface phase of the action White Plainss 5-inch gun crew claimed six hits on heavy cruiser , causing its eight deck-mounted Type 93 \\"Long Lance\\" torpedoes to explode. The explosion crippled Ch≈çkai, making it vulnerable to air attack. Ch≈çkai was later sunk by planes from , an escort carrier of Taffy 2. However, 's detailed action report states that Chokai's immobilizing damage resulted from a bomb hit at 0851,Lundgren  p. 184 so while this claim is plausible it is not verified by Japanese sources. The Japanese surface force broke off its pursuit from 0912‚Äì0917 hours, and after milling around in apparent confusion for a time, retired northward to San Bernardino Strait. The retreat by Kurita's surface force, however, did not end the ordeal for White Plains and her fellow warships. After a 90-minute respite, they suffered harassment from a different quarter. At 1050 hours, a formation of nine Japanese Navy Zeke fighters appeared and began simultaneous kamikaze attacks. Two of them singled out White Plains as their victim. Her antiaircraft gunners responded, hitting one of the intruders, which immediately changed course and crashed into USS , which eventually sank. The other aircraft continued on toward White Plains, but her antiaircraft guns finally brought him down yards astern, scattering debris all over the ship's deck and sides, but causing only 11 relatively minor casualties. In the meantime, USS and USS Kalinin Bay also suffered from kamikaze crashes, but neither of these proved to be fatal to the carriers. That attack proved to be the final combat action of USS White Plains. She steamed to the naval base at Manus with the other surviving carriers, arriving on 31 October. After an inspection of the damage, it was decided that the battered escort carrier should return to the United States for complete repairs. Accordingly, she departed from Manus on 6 November and headed to the West Coast, arriving at San Diego Harbor on 27 November; repairs began immediately. Ready for action once more, USS White Plains steamed out of San Diego on 19 January 1945. However, concern about the lingering effects of the hull and machinery damage suffered at Samar kept her off the front lines and she was assigned to ferrying replacement aircraft from their factories in the United States to bases in the western Pacific for the remainder of the war. During the last months of the war, White Plains visited Kwajalein, Hollandia (currently known as Jayapura), Ulithi, Saipan, Guam, Leyte, and Pearl Harbor. All had been scenes of major combat actions in the past, but by this time they had become rear areas. The closest approach to the fighting by White Plains after the Battle off Samar came just after the amphibious landings on Okinawa in April 1945, when she steamed to within 100 miles of the island to launch two squadrons of Marine Corps F4U Corsair fighter planes for duty from air bases on that large island. =Post-War= The end of hostilities in mid-August found the USS White Plains en route from Pearl Harbor to the West Coast. She arrived at San Pedro, California, on 22 August but soon moved to San Diego. From there, she headed back to the Western Pacific on 6 September to begin Operation Magic Carpet duty bringing American fighting men home from the Pacific Theater. Twenty days later, she arrived in Buckner Bay, Okinawa, where she embarked more than 800 passengers for the voyage to the United States. On 28 September, she pointed her bow eastward and set a course, via Pearl Harbor, for San Diego. The White Plains entered San Diego Harbor on 16 October and disembarked her passengers. After nine days in port, she got underway for Pearl Harbor and stopped there only briefly on 1 November before setting out on the return voyage to the West Coast. The warship visited San Francisco for five days from 7 to 12 November and then headed across the Pacific once more. She entered port at Guam in the Marianas on 27 November, embarked passengers, and then began the return voyage on 30 November. White Plains arrived in Seattle, Washington, on 14 December 1945. She remained there until 30 January 1946, when she embarked upon the voyage, via the Panama Canal and Norfolk, Virginia, to Boston, Massachusetts. The White Plains entered Boston Harbor on 17 February 1946, and then began preparations for decommissioning. The USS White Plains was decommissioned on 10 July 1946 and was berthed with the Boston Group, Atlantic Reserve Fleet. She remained with the reserve fleet for 12 years. On 12 June 1955, she was redesignated a utility aircraft carrier (CVU-66). Finally, her name was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 1 July 1958. She was sold on 29 July to the Hyman Michaels Company, of Chicago for scrapping. Awards White Plains earned five battle stars during World War II, as well as the Presidential Unit Citation and Philippine Republic Presidential Unit Citation for her part in the Battle off Samar.

She was the first ship to carry her name. She was the flagship of Task Group 22.3, a hunter-killer group which captured the German submarine in 1944.  Construction and commissioning Guadalcanal was built using a converted Maritime Commission freighter hull by Kaiser Shipyards in Vancouver, Washington. Originally Astrolabe Bay (AVG-60), she was reclassified ACV-60 on 20 August 1942 and launched as Guadalcanal (ACV-60) on 5 June 1943, sponsored by Mrs. Alvin I. Malstrom. She was reclassified CVE-60 on 15 July 1943; and commissioned at Astoria, Oregon on 25 September 1943, Captain Daniel V. Gallery in command. After shakedown training in which Capt. Gallery made the first take off and landing aboard his new ship, Guadalcanal performed pilot qualifications out of San Diego, California, and then departed on 15 November 1943, via the Panama Canal, for Norfolk, Virginia, arriving on 3 December. There she became flagship of Task Group 22.3 (TG 22.3), and with her escort destroyers set out from Norfolk on 5 January 1944 in search of enemy submarines in the North Atlantic Ocean. First \\"Hunter-killer\\" cruise World War II submarines had to run surfaced most of the time, and could not stay submerged for more than about 72 hours before having to surface to recharge batteries. But by 1944, U-boats dared not surface in daylight, because they would be spotted by patrolling aircraft. Patrols from escort carriers covered even the middle of the Atlantic. Surfacing at night was safer, because night flight operations from escort carriers were considered too dangerous. The best the escort carriers could do was substitute extra fuel tanks for depth charges on a Grumman TBF Avenger, so the plane could take off at sunset, fly around all night, and land at dawn. The U-boats would not know the plane was unarmed, and would not risk staying surfaced. Gallery decided that Guadalcanal would try night operations. When Ultra intelligence revealed a planned U-boat refueling rendezvous 500 miles west of the Azores just before sunset on 16 January 1944, Guadalcanal stayed clear of the area until launching eight Avengers just before sunset to comb the rendezvous area. The Avengers found two U-boats engaged in refueling with another standing by, and dived out of the clouds to drop depth charges. All three submarines disappeared; but 32 survivors of were floating in a pool of oil. In their excitement to see the effects of their first successful attack, the Avenger pilots stayed aloft so long they returned to the carrier after sunset. Aircraft recoveries were slow because of bad approaches in the gathering dusk. After four landed successfully, the fifth Avenger landed too far right and put both wheels into the gallery walkway with its tail fouling the flight deck. The flight deck crew was unable to move the Avenger; and the three remaining planes were running out of fuel in total darkness. Guadalcanal turned on the lights and urged the pilots to try landing on the left side of the flight deck. The nervous pilots came in too high, too fast, and too far to port until one of them desperately cut power, bounced, and landed inverted in the water off the port side. The plane guard destroyer rescued the three crewmen from the unsuccessful landing and the crewmen from the two remaining planes which were instructed to ditch. No more night flying was attempted, and no more U-boats were discovered during daylight patrols. Gallery kept his flight deck crew busy training with the wrecked Avenger between flight operations. The Avenger was cabled to the ship so it wouldn't be lost; and the crew was timed with a stopwatch to see how long it took them to push it over the side. The plane would then be winched back aboard for another drill. After they could reliably clear the flight deck within four minutes, they were finally allowed to push the battered Avenger overboard with no cable attached. After replenishing at Casablanca, the Task Group headed back to Norfolk and repairs, arriving on 16 February. Second \\"Hunter-killer\\" cruise Departing again with her escorts on 7 March, Guadalcanal sailed with newly assigned air group VC-58 to Casablanca and got underway from that port on 30 March with a convoy bound for the United States. After three weeks of daylight flights finding no U-boats, Guadalcanal attempted night flight operations under the full moon of 8 April 1944. Four fully armed Avengers were launched just before sunset with recovery scheduled for 22:30. One of the Avengers found recharging batteries on the surface northwest of Madeira, and forced the U-boat to submerge by dropping a stick of depth charges with U-515 silhouetted in a down-moon approach. Guadalcanal kept four Avengers aloft at all times through the night, and when U-515 attempted to surface to recharge batteries, she was repeatedly forced to submerge. Each sighting gave another fix on U-515s position; and , , , and detected the U-boat with sonar at 07:00. The ships made coordinated attacks until U-515 was forced to the surface with depleted batteries and foul air at 14:00, and Kapitaenleutenant Werner Henke scuttled his ship. Guadalcanal Avengers had detected a second U-boat about sixty miles away while holding down U-515; so they maintained patrols through the night of 9 April. was discovered at daybreak on 10 April recharging batteries on the surface 300 miles south of the Azores. Three Avengers attacked out of the dark western sky with depth charges and rocket fire. U-68 sank, leaving three lookouts swimming in the wreckage, but only Hans Kastrup survived to be rescued when destroyers arrived an hour later. With the confidence gained through sinking two U-boats in the first two nights of flight operations, Guadalcanal continued night flight operations as the moon waned, and aircrew were well trained when the task group arrived safely at Norfolk on 26 April 1944. Guadalcanals success encouraged other carriers to practice night operations. =Capture of U-505= Newly captured U-505, June 4, 1944 After voyage repairs at Norfolk, Guadalcanal and her escorts departed Hampton Roads for sea again on 15 May 1944. Two weeks of cruising brought no contacts, and Gallery decided to head the Task Group for the coast of Africa to refuel. However, on 4 June 1944, ten minutes after reversing course 150 miles West of Cape Blanco in French West Africa, Chatelain detected as it was returning to its base after an 80-day patrol in the Gulf of Guinea. The destroyer loosed one depth charge attack; then made a second, more accurate drop, guided in by circling aircraft from Guadalcanal. This pattern blew relief valves all over the U-boat, cracked pipes in her engine room, and rolled her on her beam ends. Shouts of panic from the engine room led Oberleutnant Harald Lange, making his first patrol as her captain, to believe his boat was mortally wounded. To save his crew, he blew his tanks and surfaced, coming up barely 700 yards from Chatelain. The destroyer fired a torpedo, which missed, and the surfaced submarine then came under the combined fire of the escorts and aircraft as her crew abandoned ship. Captain Gallery had been waiting and planning for such an opportunity, and had trained and equipped boarding parties. He ordered Pillsbury to send a boat with a boarding party to the U-boat. Under the command of Lieutenant, junior grade Albert David, the party leaped onto the slowly circling submarine and found her abandoned. Lt. David and his men quickly seized all important papers, code books, and the boat's Enigma machine while closing valves and stopping leaks. As Pillsbury attempted to get a tow-line on her the party managed to stop her engines. A larger salvage party from Guadalcanal arrived, led by Commander Earl Trosino, Guadalcanals Chief Engineer, and prepared U-505 for towing. After securing the tow-line and picking up the German survivors from the sea, Guadalcanal started for Bermuda with her priceless prize in tow. The fleet tug USS Abnaki rendezvoused with the task group and took over towing duties. The group arrived in Bermuda on 19 June after a 2,500-mile tow. Trosino, a chief engineer in the civilian Merchant Marine before the war, had figured out the U-boat's engines, and wanted to bring her into port under her own power. Gallery refused permission; he later apologized to Trosino for doubting his skill. U-505 was the first enemy warship captured on the high seas by the U.S. Navy since 1815. For their daring and skillful teamwork in this remarkable capture, Guadalcanal and her escorts shared in a Presidential Unit Citation. Lieutenant David received the Medal of Honor for leading the boarding party, and Captain Gallery received the Legion of Merit for conceiving the operation that led to U-505s capture. The captured submarine proved to be of inestimable value to American intelligence. For the remainder of the war she was operated by the U.S. Navy as the USS Nemo to learn the secrets of German U-boats. Her true fate was kept secret until the end of the war. U-505 is now an exhibit at the Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago. Arriving in Norfolk on 22 June 1944, Guadalcanal spent only a short time in port before setting out again on patrol. She departed Norfolk on 15 July and from then until 1 December, she made three anti-submarine cruises in the Western Atlantic. She sailed on 1 December for a training period in waters off Bermuda and Cuba that included refresher landings for pilots of her new squadron, gunnery practice, and anti-submarine warfare drills with the old submarine USS R-9. Guadalcanal arrived at Mayport, Florida on 15 December, and was there employed in carrier qualifications of pilots, She subsequently engaged in further training activities in Cuban waters until 13 February 1945, when she returned to Norfolk. After another short training cruise to the Caribbean Sea, she steamed into Mayport on 15 March for another tour of duty as carrier qualification ship, later moving to Pensacola, Florida for similar operations. After qualifying nearly 4,000 pilots, Guadalcanal returned to Norfolk, and decommissioned there on 15 July 1946. Guadalcanal entered the Atlantic Reserve Fleet at Norfolk and was redesignated CVU-60 on 15 July 1955, while still in reserve. She was finally stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 27 May 1958 and she was sold for scrap to Hugo Neu Corp. of New York on 30 April 1959. She was being towed to Japan for scrapping when now- Rear Admiral Gallery made the very last landing and take-off from the ship, using a helicopter, off Guantanamo, Cuba. Awards Guadalcanal was awarded three battle stars and a Presidential Unit Citation for service in World War II. Her Presidential Unit Citation was personally ordered by Admiral Ernest J. King, Chief of Naval Operations.

Jewitt, Yanga R. Fern√°ndez and Eugene A. Magnier, and was designated '. It was soon confirmed that this was the same as the one observed in 1975. This observation was immediately correlated with an observation on August 6, 2000, by the team of Brett J. Gladman, John J. Kavelaars, Jean-Marc Petit, Hans Scholl, Matthew J. Holman, Brian G. Marsden, Philip D. Nicholson and Joseph A. Burns, which was reported to the Minor Planet Center but not published as an IAU Circular (IAUC). In October 2002 it was officially named after Themisto, daughter of the river god Inachus and lover of Zeus (Jupiter) in Greek mythology.  Characteristics  Diagram illustrating Themisto's orbit (top left) among those of the other irregular satellites of Jupiter. The satellites above the horizontal axis are prograde, the satellites beneath it are retrograde. The yellow segments extend from the pericentre to the apocentre, showing the orbital eccentricity. Themisto's orbit is unusual: unlike most of Jupiter's moons, which orbit in distinct groups, Themisto orbits alone. The moon is located midway between the Galilean moons and the first group of prograde irregular moons, called the Himalia group. Themisto is about 8 kilometers (5 miles) in diameter (assuming an albedo of 0.04). That figure can be used to find a surface area of between 200 and 380 square kilometers.

She was named after Kitkun Bay, located within Prince of Wales Island. Launched in November 1943, and commissioned in December, she served in support of the Mariana and Palau Islands campaign, the Philippines campaign, and the Battle off Samar. Postwar, she participated in Operation Magic Carpet. She was decommissioned in April 1946 and sold for scrapping in November. Design and description A profile of the design of , which was shared with all Casablanca-class escort carriers. Kitkun Bay was a Casablanca-class escort carrier, the most numerous type of aircraft carriers ever built, and designed specifically to be mass- produced using prefabricated sections, in order to replace heavy early war losses. Standardized with her sister ships, she was long overall, had a beam of , and a draft of . She displaced standard, with a full load. She had a long hangar deck and a long flight deck. She was powered with two Skinner Unaflow reciprocating steam engines, which drove two shafts, providing , thus enabling her to make . The ship had a cruising range of at a speed of . Her compact size necessitated the installment of an aircraft catapult at her bow, and there were two aircraft elevators to facilitate movement of aircraft between the flight and hangar deck: one each fore and aft. One /38 caliber dual- purpose gun was mounted on the stern. Anti-aircraft defense was provided by eight Bofors anti-aircraft guns in single mounts, as well as twelve Oerlikon cannons, which were mounted around the perimeter of the deck. By the end of the war, Casablanca-class carriers had been modified to carry thirty cannons, and the amount of Bofors guns had been doubled to sixteen, by putting them into twin mounts. These modifications were in response to increasing casualties due to kamikaze attacks. Casablanca-class escort carriers were designed to carry 27 aircraft, but the hangar deck could accommodate more. During the Mariana and Palau Islands campaign, she carried 12 FM-2 fighters, and 8 TBM-1C torpedo bombers, for a total of 20 aircraft. However, during the Philippines campaign and Battle off Samar, she carried 16 FM-2 fighters and 12 TBM-1C torpedo bombers for a total of 28 aircraft. During the Invasion of Lingayen Gulf, she carried 15 FM-2 fighters, 10 TBM-3 torpedo bombers, along with two reconnaissance planes, a FM-2P and a TBM-3P. Construction The escort carrier was laid down on 3 May 1943, under a Maritime Commission contract, MC hull 1108, by Kaiser Shipbuilding Company, Vancouver, Washington. She was named Kitkun Bay, as part of a tradition which named escort carriers after bays or sounds in Alaska. She was launched on 8 November 1943; sponsored by Mrs. Francis E. Cruise, the wife of Captain Edgar Allen Cruise, a Navy Cross recipient; transferred to the United States Navy and commissioned on 15 December 1943, with Captain John Perry Whitney in command. Operational missions Upon being commissioned, Kitkun Bay proceeded southwards to Naval Air Station Tongue Point, Astoria, Oregon, where she fitted out. On 3 January 1944, whilst she was moored at Pier 1, an unidentified aircraft flew over the area, and with the previous shelling of Fort Stevens in mind, the crew entered general quarters at 4:40. Eventually, it became clear that the aircraft was an American plane that failed to follow recognition protocol. After finishing fitting out, Kitkun Bay embarked on a shakedown cruise around Puget Sound, loading munitions, fueling, and degaussing. She stood out of Seattle on 13 January, stopped at Port Townshend, and proceeded down the West Coast. Upon arriving at Naval Air Station Alameda, she loaded munitions, fuel, and aircraft equipment from 17 to 20 January. After leaving port, she steamed southwards to San Diego, conducting gunnery practice along the way. She arrived on 22 January, whereupon she trained in additional gunnery and torpedo exercises in the vicinity of the Channel Islands, which continued until 27 January. During this time period, Composite Squadron 5 (VC-5), her designated aircraft contingent, trained from Ream Field, near Imperial Beach. At the time, the squadron consisted of 12 FM-2 Wildcats, as well as 7 TBM-1 and 2 TBF-1 Avengers. After finishing exercises, Kitkun Bay docked back in San Diego, where she took on thirteen naval officers and seventeen TBF-1 Avengers of Marine Torpedo Bomber Squadron 242 (VMTB-242), along with their corresponding complement of crew. This process took place between 27 and 28 January, and upon finishing, she left San Diego on a transport mission bound for the West Pacific. Sailing without escorts for the first leg of her voyage, the crew conducted drills and anti-aircraft exercises. She crossed the equator on 6 February. Upon entering the waters around the Samoan Islands on 9 February, where Japanese submarines were assessed to be possibly located, the destroyer escort was assigned as an escort. Kitkun Bay arrived at Espiritu Santo on 14 February. For the next two days, Kitkun Bay disembarked her passengers, as well as the marine air group that she was transporting. She also unloaded spare parts for aircraft based in the region. Upon finishing that task on 17 February, she transited the Segond Chanel, where she took on a load of assorted cargo, including fuel, mail, and passengers. She then steamed for Efate, arriving the following day, on 18 February. As she began her return trip on 19 February, she was escorted by the former destroyer, turned high- speed minesweeper, . Transiting via Ford Island, she arrived at Pearl Harbor on 28 February, where she disembarked much of her cargo. She then proceeded back to the West Coast, in conjunction with , which had also just finished a transport mission, and was now carrying a load of nonfunctional aircraft. The two escort carriers arrived back at port in San Diego on 6 March. After returning to port, Kitkun Bay took on Composite Squadron 5 (VC-5) on 8 March. She then conducted pilot qualifications off the southern California coast, from 7 to 17 March. During these qualifications, the former destroyer, now seaplane tender, kept watch. After a brief return to port, where VC-5 was unloaded for further training, she conducted additional pilot qualifications for a variety of squadrons throughout the end of March. From 1 to 27 April, the carrier was moored at Naval Base San Diego, where maintenance and repairs were conducted. During this period, Rear Admiral Harold Bushnell Salada, the commander of Carrier Division 26, went aboard Kitkun Bay, assigning the carrier as his flagship. Kitkun Bay returned to sea at the end of April, recalibrating her navigational equipment, and conducting additional drills. She then returned to San Diego, this time to pick up an air squadron bound for Pearl Harbor. She left port on 1 May, with twelve FM-2 Wildcats and nine TBM-1C Avengers of VC-5 on board. She was joined by Gambier Bay and , and the three carriers were escorted by the destroyers and . Arriving at Ford Island on 8 May, the aircraft conducted carrier qualifications with VC-5 off of Oahu. These qualifications were momentarily interrupted by upkeep at Ford Island. She then conducted additional exercises in conjunction with the battleship . Exercises with the battleship were conducted from 10 to 11, 12 to 15, and from 16 to 19 May. After finishing exercises, she yet again entered maintenance, during which preparations for Operation Forager were made, the Mariana and Palau Islands campaign. =Mariana and Palau Islands campaign= The destroyers , , and escorted Kitkun Bay and Gambier Bay as they sortied from Pearl Harbor on 31 May. Later that day, the two carriers rendezvoused with a bombardment group for the campaign, centered around the battleships , , Maryland, and . This task group was escorted by a dozen destroyers, which were in turn also escorting the various vessels of Transport Division 16. Kitkun Bay, along with the other carriers, launched fighter patrols to provide an air screen, and launched aircraft to conduct antisubmarine patrols. During this time period, Kitkun Bay suffered two crashes. The first, involving a Wildcat, occurred on 1 June, but the pilot was rescued by an escorting destroyer. On 4 June, an Avenger, approaching the carrier's flight deck, attempted to land. However, as the plane slowed down, the landing signal officer (LSO) waved the aircraft off, as the carrier was still swinging into the wind. As the torpedo bomber attempted to clear, it stalled, and crashed into the ocean some away from the starboard side of ship. The gunner escaped, and was recovered by Morrison, but the pilot and the radioman both drowned. On 8 June, she arrived at Kwajalein Atoll. Whilst anchored her crew experienced general quarters three times on 9 June, as a result of U.S. planes that failed to properly identify themselves. There, she was assigned to Task Unit 52.11.1, of Task Group 52.14, commanded by Rear Admiral Gerald F. Bogan. On 10 June, the task group left Kwajalein, this time bound directly for the Marianas. En route, Kitkun Bay launched planes to patrol for submarines and to cover the task force as it steamed westwards. On 13 June, at 08:53 in the morning, an Avenger launched from the carrier spotted what it believed to be a periscope about from the carrier, before dropping two bombs. The carrier began evasive maneuvers, and the contact was marked with smoke. Despite the perceived submarine being engaged by a pair of destroyers and another aircraft, no further contact was reported. Later that morning, at 10:48, the task group's radar operators spotted an unidentified aircraft some to the east, directing Kitkun Bays fighters towards the blip. At 11:05, the fighters intercepted a Mitsubishi G4M1 variant bomber, quickly shooting the aircraft down. At the end of the day, at 22:25, the destroyer fired at a surface signature, with no apparent result. Two escort carriers, Gambier Bay, and Kitkun Bay, accompanied by a destroyer screen, proceeding ahead. At 2:45 in the morning of 14 June, Kitkun Bays lookouts spotted Saipan, as well as flares illuminating the Japanese-held island. By the morning, Kitkun Bay had been joined by three more carriers, and she began preparing to launch aircraft. During these preparations, as one of her plane handlers was pushing an Avenger into position on the flight deck, one of its rockets discharged, with the sailor being hit by the backblast. The discharged rocket narrowly passed in between several other aircraft, and the unfortunate sailor was badly burned throughout his entire body, succumbing to his injuries the following day. Nonetheless, the carrier continued launching its aircraft complement as planned, providing cover over the attack transports hovering near the island, and scouting out landing positions. On the morning of 15 June, U.S. forces began landing on Saipan. Kitkun Bays aircraft provided close air support, strafing Japanese positions and covering the initial advance. Japanese surface gunfire did down one of her Wildcats over water, but its crew was recovered by Morrison. During this time period, the carrier's radar operators where continuously bedeviled by unidentified blips. For example, on the night of 16 June, at 3:07, a probable Japanese plane was spotted approaching the carrier, some out, with her crew being called to general quarters. The plane turned and escaped, and the crew were dismissed, before general quarters was called again eighteen minutes later, due to another array of blips. At 13:45, Morrison detected a submarine signature, and dropped depth charges, without ill result. During the following days, Kitkun Bay continued launching aircraft in support of ground operations, whilst at the same time enduring almost constant Japanese probing attacks. The task group operated some east of the island, and aircraft losses were frequent. On 17 June, one of her Avengers was damaged by Japanese ground fire, and the aircraft splashed into the ocean, with the crew being retrieved by the destroyer . Later that day, the task group came under more concentrated attack. During the afternoon, the Japanese had launched an aerial raid, consisting of about thirty to forty aircraft, from the island of Yap in an attempt to harry ships landing reinforcements on Saipan. Although their attacks were generally unsuccessful, as they retired, they happened across the escort carrier task group. The Japanese aircraft were spotted by the escort carrier radars some away. As it became clear that the aircraft were closing in, general quarters were sounded, and additional aircraft were launched to prepare for an interception. At 18:50, after the sun had set, the Japanese aircraft, finding the escort carriers an acceptable target, attacked. Gambier Bay was shook by two near-hits, and Coral Sea was harried by multiple aircraft. Four torpedo bombers approached Kitkun Bay from the port bow, with at least one dropping a torpedo, which passed behind the carrier. Shortly afterwards, all four where shot down in a carnage of antiaircraft fire. After a brief lull, the task group's air screen shot down two more Japanese planes. The last Japanese attempt at an attack occurred at 19:05, when two dive bombers moved into position for an attack, before being discouraged by antiaircraft fire. Remarkably, due to an effective anti-aircraft screen and concentrated fire, none of the ships of the task group were hit by any Japanese munitions, although a multitude of Japanese planes had been shot down. No American planes were lost to enemy action, but a Wildcat from Kitkun Bay was lost as aircraft were recovered following the attack. By 20:26, Kitkun Bay had already recovered all but one of its fighters. However, the last fighter to be recovered came in too low, and its tailhook hit a metal handrail, bending it into a sharp V. This impact and sudden deacceleration might have stunned the pilot, and as the plane continued forwards, it keeled off starboard, just behind the ship's island, plunging into the ocean. Despite a destroyer searching throughout the night, nothing was recovered. Enemy planes sent the ships to general quarters at 0421 on 18 June 1944, but they turned out to be snoopers and did not press their attack. Kitkun Bay launched her planes for additional runs against Japanese troops on Saipan and nearby Tinian throughout the day. Radar detected a force of about 30 enemy aircraft approaching from 40 miles to the southward at 1603. As the attackers closed the range rapidly, the crew manned their battle stations, but the enemy kept off at a distance. Wildcats intercepted and splashed two planes at 1755, which fell burning into the sea about five miles from the ship. Six Japanese planes suddenly approached the formation from the south at about 10,000 feet and all the ships opened fire as soon as they flew within range. An enemy plane, tentatively (and possibly erroneously) identified as a Nakajima J1N1 Gekko made a run on Kitkun Bay on her starboard bow. The Irving delayed releasing its torpedo and the ship's forward starboard guns poured fire into the plane, and at 100 yards one of its engines began smoking. The attacker dropped the torpedo but it missed the carrier by about 25 feet since the captain had her in a sharp turn. As the Irving crossed the bow its tail gunner attempted to strafe the ship but several 20 millimeter shells sliced into him. Additional 40 millimeter rounds hit the plane and it burst into flames, rose vertically for about 1,000 feet, nosed over and plunged into the sea in a ‚Äúspectacular‚Äù splash. At the same time another plane attacked from Kitkun Bay‚Äôs starboard beam and passed just astern of the ship. The entire midship and after starboard batteries opened up on the aircraft and possibly killed all of the crew, since it failed to drop a torpedo. As the torpedo bomber cleared the stern, the port guns shot into it and the bomber splashed into the water about 300 yards off the port quarter. Another torpedo plane thrust at either Coral Sea or Gambier Bay, which appeared to bear the brunt of the assault, as they steamed astern of Kitkun Bay. A 5-inch round from Kitkun Bay hit it squarely and a ball of flame erupted from the assailant as it just cleared the bow of the other carrier and crashed into the Pacific. Lt. William H. Johnson, USNR, and Ens. Krouse flew a pair of Wildcats (BuNos 16180 and 46959) that went down during the chaotic aerial maneuvering on the 18th. Destroyers rescued both men, Krouse after having survived his second fighter loss in as many days. Throughout the day on 19 June 1944, TF 58 repelled Japanese air attacks and slaughtered their aircraft in what Navy pilots dubbed the ‚ÄúGreat Marianas Turkey Shoot.‚Äù Kitkun Bay operated with her cohorts to the eastward of Saipan when American radar detected multiple Japanese strike groups about ten miles out and heading toward the fleet early that morning, and at 0624, Kitkun Bay launched a pair of Wildcats for CAP, joined a minute later by the first of five from Gambier Bay. The enemy closed the range rapidly and within five minutes a trio of dive bombers attacked the formation from an altitude of about 5,000 feet. The Japanese planes dropped two bombs that splashed close aboard Gambier Bay and then winged off, but a minute later two torpedo bombers approached the ships from the east. The vessels of the formation shot a heavy concentration of antiaircraft fire at the pair and they broke off and withdrew without making their runs. The escort carriers continued flight operations throughout the busy day and that afternoon launched a bomb strike that included six Avengers from Kitkun Bay that attacked the Japanese ashore on Saipan. The usual late afternoon bogey alarms sent the ship's company scrambling to their battle stations at 1618, but the vessels of the formation blazed away with every available gun and the enemy planes came about without attacking. The following day, Kitkun Bay sent her Avengers aloft for early morning antisubmarine patrols. The ship then worked with Gambier Bay and their screening vessels in providing a triple defense of antiaircraft, antisurface, and antisubmarine cover for the transports of the Joint Expeditionary Force, TF 51, Vice Adm. Richmond K. Turner, as they operated about 60 miles to the east of Saipan. Ens. James C. Lucas, USNR, flew a TBM-1C (BuNo 17055) from the ship that crashed, but a destroyer rescued Lucas and his crew. Kitkun Bay celebrated her 1,000th landing with cake on 21 June 1944. At noon, Laws slipped alongside Kitkun Bay as the two ships rolled in the swells and transferred a Japanese prisoner to the carrier. The destroyer had picked up the 19-year-old Sumatran when she discovered him floating in a raft two days before. The man served with the Japanese and flew a patrol from Yap [Wa‚Äôab] in the Caroline Islands to Rota in the Marianas, and unsuccessfully attacked Gambier Bay on the 17th. Kitkun Bay‚Äôs security detachment temporarily incarcerated the prisoner in the ship‚Äôs brig. A torpedo passed beneath Benham‚Äôs stern while the ships of the formation covered Turner‚Äôs transports on the 22nd. Benham attacked the submarine and dropped five depth charges, but the destroyer lost contact and the enemy boat eluded destruction. The task unit joined TU 52.14.2, consisting of Idaho (BB-41), New Mexico (BB-40), Pennsylvania (BB-38), Honolulu (CL-48), St. Louis (CL-49), and their screen of destroyers, on 24 June. Two days later, Kitkun Bay sighted Saipan and a plane flew the prisoner to Aslito Airfield on the island. The ship launched daily ground support missions, and early on the 29th sounded general quarters when she detected unidentified planes on her radar, though they did not approach. Kitkun Bay hurled her aircraft against enemy troops on both Saipan and Tinian, and later that day lookouts on a number of vessels sighted several torpedoes thrusting through the water toward the group, but the escorting destroyers proved unable to obtain good attack runs on the enemy submarine or submarines. Bogeys sent the crew to their battle stations again the following day, only to see the enemy wing off without attacking. Early July brought a brief respite at Eniwetok in the Marshall Islands as Kitkun Bay and her companions swung around on the 2nd of the month and made for the atoll. ‚ÄúSchedule of support aircraft maintained today much appreciated by troops,‚Äù Rear Adm. Harold B. Sallada, Commander Support Aircraft, messaged Kitkun Bay as she came about. ‚ÄúSupporting aircraft executed close support expertly. Not only the troops like what you are doing but we do.‚Äù ‚ÄúAt Saipan we became a fighting ship because the crew, ‚ÄúLt. Robert E. Thomlinson, USNR, who served on the staff of Rear Adm. Ralph A. Ofstie (see below), reflected, ‚Äúwhich had been full of the usual Navy gripe up to that time, suddenly found itself‚Ä¶From that time on, the Kitkun Bay was in the thick of the fight and did her share‚Ä¶Of the ships I was on during the war, she was my favorite and always will be.‚Äù Kitkun Bay took on stores, ammunition, and fuel while at Eniwetok (5‚Äì10 July 1944). The warship then turned her prow back to the fighting and, in company with Gambier Bay, Laws, and Morrison, set course for Saipan and arrived in the area on the 15th. Through the end of the month, planes flying from Kitkun Bay performed almost every type of potential carrier assignment against the Japanese forces defending Saipan and Tinian including CAP, hunting for submarines, bombing and strafing attacks, observing for artillery fire, and making smoke to assist minesweepers as they swept the channels for mines. The ship lost three fighters during these battles. Lt. Cmdr. Richard L. Fowler went down in a Wildcat (BuNo 16346) he flew off the flight deck of the carrier on 15 July but survived. Two days later, it was the turn of Lt. Paul B. Garrison, USNR, in an FM-2 (BuNo 47330). Ships picked up both men and subsequently returned them to the carrier. Lt. Robert C. White of VC-5 went down in a Wildcat (BuNo 55281) while flying a mission from Kitkun Bay on 18 July. At 1321, Morrison rescued White and at 1345 went alongside Kitkun Bay to transfer the pilot, before the destroyer resumed her screening duties. Gambier Bay, Kitkun Bay, Cassin Young (DD-793), Callaghan (DD-792), Irwin (DD-794), and Porterfield (DD-682) formed a new task unit on 1 August 1944, and charted a course for an operating area east of Guam. The carriers launched planes that provided air cover over the soldiers and marines battling the Japanese for control of the island (2‚Äì4 August). At 1704 on the 3rd, an Avenger of VC-10 flying an antisubmarine patrol from Gambier Bay sighted a periscope and attacked with depth charges, causing oil and debris to rise to the surface. The enemy submarine escaped. The ships then came about and anchored at Eniwetok (7‚Äì11 August). On the 8th, Rear Adm. Ofstie relieved Rear Adm. Sallada in command of CarDiv 26 and broke his flag in Kitkun Bay. Late on the afternoon of 11 August, Kitkun Bay stood out to sea for Esp√≠ritu Santo, where she completed voyage repairs, took on fuel, provisions, and ordnance, and sailors repainted much of the ship. Following that work, the vessels of the task unit got underway for a brief (24‚Äì26 August) sail to Purvis Bay in the Florida Islands [Nggela] of the Solomons. Kitkun Bay received orders to anchor at times in the harbor at Gavutu [Ghuvatu Harbour], which afforded the carrier a temporary base of operations while she girded herself for future operations by practicing attacks in support of amphibious landings in an area to the southwest of nearby Guadalcanal, and in New Georgia Sound (27 August‚Äì8 September). Heading westward on 8 September 1944, Kitkun Bay and the ships of the task unit escorted an assault force of transports and dock landing ships for Operation Stalemate II‚Äîthe landings of the 1st Marine Division on Peleliu and Angaur Islands in the Palaus. The convoy passed around the west end of Florida Island, between Santa Isabel and Malaita Islands, and proceeded at 12.5 knots. The carriers launched daily CAP and antisubmarine patrols to protect the marines during the passage. Kitkun Bay struck a heavy log at 0142 on the 13th and it lodged in her bow, reducing the ship's speed by almost a knot. The log stayed jammed into the hull for nearly 45 minutes in spite of changes of course to dislodge it, but it finally broke free without significantly damaging the ship and she resumed her voyage at the convoy's speed. The Japanese had prepared their main line of resistance on Peleliu inland from the beaches to escape naval bombardment, and three days of preliminary carrier air attacks in combination with intense naval gunfire failed to suppress the tenacious defenders. The ship hurled her planes against the enemy each day of her deployment to the battle (15‚Äì25 September 1944) as they flew photographic reconnaissance flights, and bombing and strafing runs, along with the usual CAP and antisubmarine barrier patrols to protect the ships operating offshore. Lt. Johnson flew a mission from Kitkun Bay on the 20th that included dropping a message to attack transport Fremont (APA-44). He then joined a strike against the Japanese ashore but one of the aircraft released a bomb that touched off an enemy ammunition dump. The explosion damaged his Wildcat and forced him to land on the war-torn island. The ship later sent a plane that landed on Peleliu Airfield, and picked the pilot up and returned him to the carrier. The following day on 21 September, Japanese antiaircraft fire damaged two of the Avengers flying from the ship over Babelthuap [Babeldaob] Island. Both torpedo bombers landed on the airfield on Peleliu, the first with a couple of wounded crewmen. The second plane managed to lift off again and fly back to the ship. After recovering aircraft that afternoon, the carriers and their escorts steamed to positions astern of some of the transports and dock landing ships, and the combined group then came about for Ulithi Atoll in the Carolines. The Army's 81st Infantry Division later reinforced the marines and the final Japanese on Peleliu only surrendered on 1 February 1945. Stopping briefly at Ulithi, the escort carriers and their escorts stood down the channel on the afternoon of 25 September 1944, for the three-day trip to New Guinea, and then continued on to Seeadler Harbor on Manus in the Admiralty Islands. Kitkun Bay loaded fuel, ammunition, and stores while at the anchorage (1‚Äì11 October), and prepared to take part in the invasion of Leyte in the Philippines. Screened by four destroyers, Gambier Bay and Kitkun Bay turned their prows seaward on 12 October 1944, and on the following day rendezvoused with a group of cruisers, destroyers, and landing craft. The force steamed toward Philippine waters in the vicinity of Mindanao, where the carriers and their screen detached on the 19th to join other carriers, and the invasion vessels continued on to Leyte Gulf. =Battle off Samar= Adm. William F. Halsey Jr., Commander, Third Fleet, led nine fleet and eight light carriers in those troubled waters. Vice Adm. Thomas C. Kinkaid, Commander, Seventh Fleet, led a force that included TG 77.4, Rear Adm. Thomas L. Sprague‚Äîconsisting of 18 escort carriers organized in Task Units (TUs) 77.4.1, 77.4.2, and 77.4.3, and known by their voice radio calls as Taffys 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Chenango (CVE-28), Petrof Bay (CVE-80), Saginaw Bay (CVE-82), Sangamon (CVE-26), Santee (CVE-29), and Suwanee (CVE-27) and their screens formed Taffy 1, Rear Adm. Thomas Sprague, and fought off northern Mindanao. Chenango and Saginaw Bay swung around on the 24th to carry planes to Morotai in the Netherlands East Indies [Indonesia] for repairs and overhaul. Kadashan Bay (CVE-76), Manila Bay (CVE-61), Marcus Island (CVE-77), Natoma Bay (CVE-62), Ommaney Bay (CVE-79), and Savo Island (CVE-78) of Taffy 2, Rear Adm. Felix B. Stump, operated off the entrance to Leyte Gulf. Two CarDivs formed Taffy 3, Rear Adm. Clifton A. F. Sprague, off Samar. Fanshaw Bay (CVE-70), Kalinin Bay (CVE-68), St. Lo (CVE-63), and White Plains (CVE-66) formed CarDiv 25, Rear Adm. Clifton Sprague, while Gambier Bay and Kitkun Bay comprised CarDiv 26, Rear Adm. Ofstie. Heermann (DD-523), Hoel (DD-533), and Johnston (DD-557), together with escort ships Dennis (DE-405), John C. Butler (DE-339), Raymond (DE-341), and Samuel B. Roberts (DE-413), screened Taffy 3. The Army's 6th Ranger Battalion landed on Dinagat and Suluan Islands at the entrance to Leyte Gulf to destroy Japanese installations capable of providing early warning of a U.S. attack, on 17 October 1944. The garrison on Suluan transmitted an alert that prompted Adm. Toyoda Soemu, the Japanese Commander in Chief of the Combined Fleet to order Sh≈ç-G≈ç 1‚Äîan operation to defend the Philippines. The raid thus helped to bring about the Battle of Leyte Gulf. While the enemy gathered his naval and air forces, the Allies landed on Leyte. Kitkun Bay operated from a position east of Samar and launched multiple air strikes to support the troops as they fought their way ashore and then inland (20‚Äì25 October). Planes bombed and strafed the Japanese troops and their positions, flew reconnaissance missions, and maintained CAP over the ship and her consorts. In addition, the carrier provided fighters to protect transports and the invasion beaches. Lt. (j.g.) Donald W. Hyde, USNR, of VC-5 flew a Wildcat (BuNo 16274) from the ship that went down on the 20th, but the pilot survived. The Battle of Leyte Gulf, a succession of distinct fleet engagements, began on 22 October 1944, when Sh≈ç-G≈ç 1 attempted to disrupt the U.S. landings in Leyte Gulf. Japanese fuel shortages compelled them to disperse their fleet into the Northern (decoy), Central, and Southern Forces and converge separately on Leyte Gulf. Attrition had reduced the Northern Force's 1st Mobile Force, their principal naval aviation command and led by Vice Adm. Ozawa Jisabur≈ç, to carrier Zuikaku and light carriers Chitose, Chiy≈çda, and Zuih≈ç. Submarine Darter (SS-227) detected a group of Japanese warships northwest of Borneo on the 22nd and into the following day shadowed them. Bream (SS-243) meanwhile torpedoed heavy cruiser Aoba off Manila Bay, and Darter and Dace (SS-247) unflinchingly attacked what turned out to be the Japanese Center Force, Vice Adm. Kurita Takeo in command. Dace sank heavy cruiser Maya, and Darter sank heavy cruiser Atago and damaged her sistership Takao, which came about for at Brunei. The planes of TG 38.2, TG 38.3, and TG 38.4 attacked Kurita as his ships crossed the Sibuyan Sea. Enterprise, Intrepid (CV-11), Franklin (CV-13), and Cabot launched strikes that sank battleship Musashi south of Luzon. Aircraft from the three task groups also damaged battleships Yamato and Nagato, heavy cruiser Tone, and destroyers Fujinami, Kiyoshimo, and Uranami. Planes furthermore attacked the Southern Force as it proceeded through the Sulu Sea, and sank destroyer Wakaba and damaged battleships Fus≈ç and Yamashiro. Ozawa in the meanwhile decoyed Halsey's Third Fleet northward, and aircraft subsequently sank all four Japanese carriers, Chitose with the assistance of cruiser gunfire, off Cape Enga√±o. Halsey's rapid thrust, however, carried his ships beyond range to protect the escort carriers of Taffy 3. Occasional rain squalls swept through the area as the sun dawned on Wednesday, 25 October 1944. The visibility gradually opened to approximately 40,000 yards with a low overcast, and the wind was from the north-northwest. Kitkun Bay and the other ships of Taffy 3 greeted the day preparing to launch strikes to support the troops fighting ashore. The carriers thus armed their planes with light bombs and rockets to attack Japanese soldiers and positions, or depth charges for those intended to fly antisubmarine patrols, armament not well suited for attacking ships. Unbeknownst to Kitkun Bay and her consorts, however, the surviving ships of the Japanese Center Force, which included battleships Yamato, Haruna, Kong≈ç, and Nagato, heavy cruisers Chikuma, Ch≈çkai, Haguro, Kumano, Suzuya, and Tone, light cruisers Noshiro and Yahagi, and 11 destroyers, made a night passage through San Bernardino Strait into the Philippine Sea. Ensign William C. Brooks, Jr., US Naval Reserve, of Pasadena, California, flew a TBM-1C of VC-65 from St. Lo and sighted the pagoda masts of some of the Japanese ships at 0637 on 25 October 1944. Brooks initially surmised that they might be Allied reinforcements but followed established procedure and radioed a sighting report. His superiors demanded confirmation so he closed the range and positively identified some of the enemy vessels. Undaunted by the overwhelming enemy firepower, Brooks and his Avenger crew pressed home two attacks against a Japanese heavy cruiser, dropping depth charges that bounced off the ship, and then joined a pair of Avengers that dived on one of the battleships, feats of extraordinary heroism for which the pilot later received the Navy Cross. Lookouts on board the ships of Taffy 3 could see bursts of Japanese antiaircraft fire on the northern horizon as the enemy vessels fired at the Avengers, and within minutes, ships began to detect the approaching Japanese vessels on their radar, and to intercept enemy message traffic. The Japanese surprised the Americans and caught Taffy 3 unprepared to face such a powerful onslaught, and the battle almost immediately became a precipitate flight in the face of the overwhelming enemy force. Sprague ordered his ships to come about to 090¬∞ at 0650, and flee to the eastward, hoping that a rain squall would mask their escape. Taffy 3 urgently called for help, the carriers scrambled to launch their planes, and the escorts steamed to what quickly became the rear of the formation to lay protective smoke screens. Kitkun Bay‚Äôs crew raced to man their battle stations and the ship sounded flight quarters as the enemy opened fire. She rang up flank speed for 18¬Ω knots, and swung around to 070¬∞ to head partly into the wind for launching planes and yet to keep away as much as possible from the more heavily armed Japanese ships. The carrier launched eight Wildcats that were already warming up for the day's action (0656‚Äì0703). At 0702 ships began making smoke, and the heavy pall of smoke and the general murkiness of the weather often prevented men from seeing the entire picture. Beginning at 0710, Kitkun Bay launched six Avengers to engage the enemy. The ship changed course to 110¬∞, but briefly turned back into the wind to launch a ninth fighter at 0711. A heavy rain squall blotted the action from view for a few minutes that morning and Kitkun Bay continued to zig-zag. The formation turned to 190¬∞ but enemy shells hurtled toward the American ships and splashed near White Plains and off Kitkun Bay‚Äôs port beam. In the forefront of the circular formation, Kitkun Bay escaped any direct hits as the shells splashed ever closer astern, but several salvoes bracketed the carrier and the near misses held little hope that her good fortune could continue. Sprague ordered the escorts to make a torpedo run at the Japanese ships at 0740, but by this time, the enemy vessels reached a point bearing 355¬∞ from Kitkun Bay at 25,000 yards. Men watched with trepidation as the flashes of the enemy guns announced more salvoes that tore through the air and fell only about 1,500 yards astern of the ship. Kitkun Bay began to jettison her gasoline bombs and smoke tanks at 0755, and Sprague directed all of the carriers to make as much smoke as possible. Maintainers meanwhile scrambled to load the remaining Avengers in the hangar deck with torpedoes, while the ship swung to 195¬∞ at 0756 to permit the other vessels to get behind the smoke screen. Three destroyers appeared off the port bow at a range of approximately ten miles and in the confusion, lookouts initially identified them as Japanese, only to discover some of the U.S. ships fighting faithfully to protect their vulnerable charges. ‚ÄúThe enemy is now within range,‚Äù the captain instructed Lieutenant Edward L. Kuhn, US Naval Reserve, Kitkun Bay‚Äôs gunnery officer, ‚ÄúMr. Kuhn, you may fire the 5-inch at will.‚Äù His gunners opened fire and altogether shot 120 of the 180 rounds stored on board, a telling tribute to their frantic defense of the ship, with Kuhn's ‚Äúcool courage under fire‚Äù contributing to the gun crew's efficiency (and resulting in his later receiving a Bronze Star). One of their 5-inch shells plunged into a Japanese ship, tentatively identified as a cruiser, at 0759 on 25 October 1944, and started a fire forward. Kitkun Bay swung over five degrees to the westward to keep away from the enemy ships, two of which in sight, Chikuma and Tone, changed course to south-southeast to pursue the carriers. Kitkun Bay changed course to 240¬∞ at 0803, and launched a trio of Wildcats. The crew's hope for survival dropped when an enemy submarine's periscope was reported off the port bow. Japanese submarines aggressively penetrated Allied defensive screens and torpedoed carriers more than once during the war, and the enemy boat, if such she was, maneuvered in a perfect position to pick of a carrier as one passed on its enforced course. Kitkun Bay swung over to 205¬∞ to present as small a target as possible and enable the escorts to attack the submarine. One of the Avengers claimed to sight the periscope and dived on it, the pilot later expressing his belief that his depth charges sank the submarine. A puff of reddish smoke and the green dye marker that the plane dropped revealed the only evidence of the submarine, and Kitkun Bay passed almost over the spot where the lookout first sighted the periscope. The elusive submarine, if one indeed ever prowled the area, vanished without a trace. Japanese shells slammed into Gambier Bay and set the ship ablaze, and some of the enemy vessels, evidently believing they had finished her off, shifted their fire to Kitkun Bay as she briefly emerged from the smoke. A salvo splashed scarcely 1,000 yards astern at 0828, and the captain furiously zig-zagged the ship and attempted to slip back within the cover of the smokescreen to escape the enemy gunfire as they dropped the range. Another salvo erupted in the water 1,000 yards off the port beam at 0830, and a minute later a third salvo splashed 700 yards astern. The next salvo tore into the sea 500 yards off the starboard beam as the Japanese found the range. Kitkun Bay experienced a ray of hope at 0834 when she received news that the planes of the strike group had refueled ashore and were returning to protect their ship. The other carriers sent their aircraft aloft and a flight of 24 planes passed over Kitkun Bay a few minutes later and dived on the enemy cruisers, which opened fire at them. Kitkun Bay‚Äôs 5-inch gun continued the unequal contest and hurled shot after shot at the enemy cruisers, but they, in turn, fired another salvo that splashed off the port beam. The ship's radar picked up unidentified aircraft ten miles to the northwest at 0858, and worried watchstanders anticipated adding Japanese planes to the threat facing them. White Plains also fired her single 5-inch gun at one of the enemy heavy cruisers, most likely Chokai. Samuel B. Roberts fought Chokai as well, and at 0859 a secondary explosion erupted from the enemy vessel, possibly as some of her torpedoes cooked off. The blast knocked out her engines and rudder, and she sheered out of line. The other enemy cruisers continued firing and a salvo splashed barely 200 yards astern of Kitkun Bay. Haguro, which took Chikuma's place in position, and Tone appeared to outdistance the rest of the Japanese ships and drew up toward Kitkun Bay. The enemy ships dropped the range until they closed on Kitkun Bay‚Äôs port beam at 12,000 yards, and their next salvo straddled the carrier as their shells splashed on both sides. The embattled carrier's 5-inch had fired almost all of the ammunition at hand, and the captain ordered the gunners to cease fire and conserve the remaining rounds because he expected that the enemy destroyers would attack. A Japanese salvo splashed a mere 20 yards astern and the alarmed gun crew believed that the following salvo would slice into the ship. Capt. Whitney thus swung the warship between 200¬∞ and 270¬∞ in an effort to forestall the apparently inevitable. Cmdr. Fowler also attempted to save Kitkun Bay and led four Avengers flying from the ship that assailed Chokai at 0905. One of the planes dropped a 500-pound bomb that tore into the Japanese vessel's stern, and smoke emerged from the cruiser and she slowed. Just as the situation looked very bleak for Kitkun Bay and the other ships, the enemy suddenly broke off the engagement at 0925 and retired. As a relieved Capt. Whitney watched them continue to do so at 0931, he ordered the vessel to slow down to 15 knots and to cease making smoke. Four ships, valiantly fighting to the end, went down: Gambier Bay, Hoel, Johnston, and Samuel B. Roberts. In addition, Japanese gunfire damaged Kalinin Bay, Dennis, and Heermann, and straddled Kitkun Bay, St. Lo, and White Plains but scored no direct hits. During the course of the next hour, Fanshaw Bay, Kitkun Bay, St. Lo, White Plains, Dennis, Heermann, John C. Butler, and Raymond formed disposition Charlie. The carriers turned into the wind to launch and recover planes, and Kitkun Bay controlled 14 fighters and six torpedo bombers in the air at 0950. Kurita ordered Fujinami to escort Chokai at 1006, and as more aircraft attacked the pair, they shot down an Avenger. Kitkun Bay began launching five Avengers, four armed with torpedoes and the fifth with bombs, at 1013. At 1035, these five planes joined a sixth flying from St. Lo and attacked Yamato, the largest and most heavily armed battleship in the Japanese armada. The aircraft dived through intense antiaircraft fire and assailed the behemoth but failed to score any confirmed hits. The final phase of the Battle off Samar included retaliatory air strikes by both sides. As many as eight enemy aircraft, at least five of them Mitsubishi A6M2 Navy Type 0 carrier fighter Model 21s of the Tokk≈çtai suicide squadron Shikishima, suddenly appeared over the formation at 1049, and singled out the carriers for their fury. ‚ÄúA few minutes later,‚Äù Lt. Thomlinson recalled, ‚Äúanother kamikaze came in and landed upon our flight deck, killing and injuring some of our gunners. The sky was full of planes, [Japanese] and ours. Ours were from the 18 escort carriers which were ranged within 75 miles of our position.‚Äù The Zeke that Thomlinson described turned and dived on Kitkun Bay from the starboard side. Fanshaw Bay added her guns to those of her fellow carrier, but the kamikaze absorbed the heavy concentration of fire, cleared Kitkun Bay‚Äôs flight deck, and crashed into the port walkway netting. The shock carried away about 15 feet of the netting and its braces, the port aerial, and the life raft suspended from the netting frame. The 550-pound bomb exploded on impact, bursting evidently on a level with the walkway, and showering fragments into the nearby gun sponsons and the ship‚Äôs side from the forecastle to No. 6 sponson. The kamikaze assault punctured more than 100 holes in the bulkheads, doors, and gasoline lines. The broken gasoline lines permitted the fuel to flow into a gun sponson but a fire did not start and men washed the gasoline overboard. The attack killed AMM3c Graham C. Hatfield, seriously wounded four more, and slightly wounded another 12. In addition, the kamikaze destroyed two Avengers (BuNos 46201 and 46202) on board the ship. One enemy plane crashed into the sea and another flew directly into the flight deck of St. Louis, Dennis ‚Äútook a position as close as we dared on account of the violent explosions occurring and commenced picking up survivors,‚Äù who were by then abandoning ship from St. Lo. At 1108, another enemy plane crashed into White Plains. Dennis continued picking up survivors for the next several hours, eventually bringing 425 of them on board from St. Louis, six from White Plains, and three from Petrof Bay. Finally, at 1432, Dennis ‚Äúsecured from general quarters.‚Äù Two kamikazes also damaged Kalinin Bay. Lookouts sighted 15 more Japanese planes at 1100, and Kitkun Bay hurriedly launched two Wildcats to join the other fighters of the CAP. The enemy aircraft attacked the ship by approaching her from nearly dead astern. A Yokosuka D4Y Type 2 carrier bomber Suisei seemingly intent on destroying the radar mast and island flew toward the ship, but gunfire set the Judy aflame and the kamikaze passed over the bridge and exploded when opposite the forward end of the flight deck. Parts of the plane, including the starboard horizontal stabilizer from its tail, and the pilot, fell onto the flight deck and the forecastle. The bomb, estimated to be a 1,100-pound weapon, dropped into the water near the bow and exploded, inflicting only inconsequential damage to the light metal parts of the ship and throwing a heavy column of water into the air. The carrier's starboard side passed through this column of water, drenching hands on the rope bridge and forward gun sponsons. None of the other aircraft attacked Kitkun Bay and the survivors disappeared a few minutes later as they returned to their field. Five Avengers from Kitkun Bay meanwhile at 1105 attacked Chikuma. The Japanese heavy cruiser had already fired most of her antiaircraft ammunition against the U.S. planes that attacked her while crossing the Sibuyan Sea‚Äîsome of her guns expended all of their live rounds and the gun crews resorted to shooting training rounds. Two torpedoes sliced into the cruiser's port side amidships and water poured into her engine room, causing the ship to lose power. Chikuma drifted to a stop and began listing to port. Nowaki swung around at 1110 to render assistance to her stricken cohort Chikuma. The men of Kitkun Bay steeled themselves for another aerial assault when the radar identified a flight of planes, but breathed a sigh of relief when the intruders turned out to be a strike group from Hornet (CV-12) and Wasp (CV-18) en route to attack the retreating the Japanese, at that point about 38 miles to the northward on a heading for San Bernardino Strait. Some of the aircraft from the ship joined the strike. The enemy franticly battled the damage to Chikuma and attempted to save their ship, but Lt. Allen W. Smith Jr., the commanding officer of VC-75, led a trio of that squadron's TBM-1Cs from Ommaney Bay that dropped three more torpedoes that ripped into her port side at 1415. Within 15 minutes, the battered warship rolled over and sank by the stern. Nowaki pulled about 120 survivors from the water. In the Battle off Samar and the Japanese retirement, the Americans damaged Yamato, Kong≈ç, Chikuma, Ch≈çkai, Haguro, Kumano, Suzuya, and Tone. Chikuma Ch≈çkai, and Suzuya suffered repeated explosions and fires and destroyers Nowaki, Fujinami, and Okinami, respectively, scuttled the cruisers with torpedoes‚Äîthough Nowaki may have reached the area after U.S. aircraft delivered the coup de gr√¢ce to Chikuma. About 60 planes from TGs 38.2 and 38.4 tore into the retiring Japanese and sank Noshiro on the 26th. That day U.S. cruisers also crippled Nowaki with gunfire, and Owen (DD-536) sank her about 65 miles south-southeast of Legaspi, Luzon. The casualties the Japanese surface fleet sustained and its virtual withdrawal to anchorages because of a lack of fuel finished it as an effective fighting force. Hale (DD-642), Picking (DD-685), and Coolbaugh (DE-217) joined the formation that evening. Kitkun Bay secured from general quarters at 1840 on 25 October 1944, having been at battle stations for 11 hours and 47 minutes. The weary crew enjoyed little time for a respite when, at 2002, an unidentified surface contact and believed to be a surfaced submarine, trailed the formation for some time at a range of 19,400 yards. Coolbaugh dropped several depth charges on the contact, though without noticeable results. Kitkun Bay‚Äôs busy radar plot detected bogeys seven miles to the north at 2135. For an hour and 34 minutes the planes circled the formation suspiciously at a distance of two to five miles but never attacked, and then just as mysteriously winged off into the night. Kitkun Bay‚Äôs losses for the day included two torpedo planes and both of their pilots and two of their crewmen: Ens. James C. Lucas and ARM3c William B. Latimer (BuNo 46343), and Ens. Allen A. Pollard and AOM2 Frank L. Orcutt. One of the Avengers fell into the sea about five miles off Kitkun Bay‚Äôs port bow‚Äîthough identifying which proved difficult in the heat of battle. The Japanese furthermore shot down four Wildcats: Lt. (j.g.) Robert T. Sell (BuNo 47393), Ens. Paul Hopfner (BuNo 16386), Ens. Geofrey B. King (BuNo 47247), and Ens Murphy (BuNo 47304). The four fighter pilots flew with VC-3 but in the confusion of the fighting landed on board Kitkun Bay, which, in those tumultuous moments, became the closest carrier in sight and not aflame, and then returned to the fray. All four men survived the harrowing experience. The following day, Kitkun Bay worked with the other vessels of Taffy 3 as they patrolled to the eastward of Leyte until they received orders to return to Seeadler for replenishment and repairs. Fanshaw Bay, Kalinin Bay, Kitkun Bay, White Plains, Dennis, Hale, Halligan (DD-584), Haraden (DD-585), Hutchins (DD-476), Raymond, and Twiggs (DD-591) came about and shaped a course to the eastward, though Hale presently detached from the convoy. Planes from Kitkun Bay flew patrols for the formation all the way to Manus via Mios Woendi in the Padaido Islands of Netherlands New Guinea [Indonesia]. While en route at 1400 on the 27th, Halligan made an underwater sound contact and dropped 11 depth charges with inconclusive results. The damaged carriers required escorts and so she rejoined the formation without regaining contact. The ships reached Woendi harbor on 29 October 1944, refueled, and set course for Manus the next morning, and on the afternoon of 1 November slipped into Seeadler Harbor. The port authorities welcomed the returning veterans by sending out a band in a re-arming barge. Fanshaw Bay, Kalinin Bay, Kitkun Bay, White Plains, Dennis, Hutchins, and Raymond cleared the harbor on the 7th and set a course for Hawaiian waters. The carriers flew off their flyable planes to Ford Island on the morning of the 18th, and that afternoon entered Pearl Harbor. While the ship lay there at 1100 the following morning, VC-5 went ashore for a much needed period of rest and training. The ship's company gave the aviators a ‚Äúbig send-off and regretted parting with such a fine squadron.‚Äù That same afternoon the warship began a ten-day (19‚Äì29 November) availability in dry dock at the navy yard. Kitkun Bay wrapped-up her work on 29 November 1944, and that afternoon and evening VC-91 moved on board as her new squadron. Established in February 1944, VC-91 also flew FM-2 Wildcats, as well as TBM-3 Avengers. The ship then (30 November‚Äì3 December) trained in the waters south of Oahu, enabling her new pilots to attain their carrier qualifications. A trio of escorts screened the ship as she turned her prow back to the fighting on 5 December. The following day, Ens. Claggett H. Hawkins of VC-91, embarked on board the ship, fatally crashed in a TBM-3 Avenger (BuNo 22880). John C. Butler rescued one survivor, ARM3c T.J. Szpont. On the 11th, Edmonds (DE-406), one of the carrier's escorts, detected an apparent submarine and made a number of depth charges attacks without noticeable effect. That afternoon, all doubts about the accuracy of her discovery vanished when lookouts sighted two torpedo wakes rushing toward Edmonds, one of which passed beneath her as it evidently ran too deep, and the other swished by just ahead of her. All three escorts fell back and searched for their prey while Kitkun Bay proceeded on a westerly course using evasive tactics. After several hours of fruitless search, the escorts rejoined the ship and they all dropped anchor in Seeadler Harbor on 17 December 1944. Rear Adm. Ofstie returned to Kitkun Bay and broke his flag in command of CarDiv 26 as the ship took on stores, ammunition, fuel, and replacement planes for her next battle. In spite of almost continuous harsh weather during January 1945, the Allies invaded Lingayen Gulf on western Luzon in the Philippines. Kitkun Bay, Shamrock Bay (CVE-84), and their escorts cleared Seeadler Harbor at 0941 on New Year's Eve 1944, and set a course to rendezvous with the rest of the invasion fleet. They joined two transport groups at 1600 that afternoon, and the combined forces continued on their voyage. Lt. Cmdr. Bernard D. Mack, VC-91's commanding officer, wrecked in a Wildcat (BuNo 73569) on 4 January 1945. Mack survived the crash but in a pre- dawn take-off from Kitkun Bay the next morning, disappeared in another Wildcat (BuNo 73551). A thorough search of the area failed to locate either Mack or his plane. The Japanese reacted vigorously to the landings and their planes attacked the invasion forces during the transit from Leyte Gulf. TF 38, Vice Adm. John S. McCain in command, including seven heavy and four light carriers, a night group of one heavy and one light carrier, and a replenishment group with one hunter-killer and seven escort carriers, nonetheless concentrated on destroying enemy air power and air installations. On 3 January 1945 carrier planes bombed Japanese airfields and ships at Formosa [Taiwan]. Three days later Ofstie's Lingayen Protective Group, TF 77.4.3, part of the vast assemblage and consisting of Kitkun Bay, Shamrock Bay, John C. Butler, and O‚ÄôFlaherty (DE-340), entered Surigao Strait. An air alert sent men scrambling to man their battle stations but the enemy failed to attack. The following morning on 7 January 1945, however, a kamikaze aimed his death dive at Kadashan Bay, which steamed about 50 miles to the north of Kitkun Bay. Despite repeated hits the enemy plane plunged into the carrier amidships directly below the bridge. After an hour and a half of feverish damage control effort, the crew checked the fires and flooding. The battered ship returned to Leyte for temporary repairs on 12 January, and on 13 February set out for a complete overhaul at San Francisco, Calif. The enemy attack served as a heads-up for Kitkun Bay, and she received a report of more unidentified aircraft closing from the north at 15 miles. Lookouts sighted antiaircraft bursts on the horizon scarcely ten miles away as Japanese planes attacked other vessels of the invasion forces. The ship steamed at general quarters several minutes later at 0910, when a lone enemy bomber appeared close to the water and closing the formation just four miles off the starboard quarter. Multiple escorts opened fire and the enemy pilot maneuvered erratically to avoid the gunfire and escaped. The Wildcats of the warship's CAP claimed to splash three other intruders and by 1115 the radar seemed clear of enemy aircraft and the ship secured from battle stations. Vice Admiral Theodore S. Wilkinson, Commander, TF 79, sent a ‚ÄúFlash Red‚Äù at 1806 that evening as additional bogeys approached from a range of 20 miles. The ship's fighters pounced on the attackers and claimed to splash four to six planes. The enemy determinedly pressed home their attack nevertheless, and cruisers and destroyers closed Kitkun Bay and blasted away at the attackers to protect her. The carriers headed into the wind to conduct flight operations in order to recover aircraft from Kadashan Bay, and two of the latter's FM-2s from VC-20 landed on board Kitkun Bay. Lt. (j.g.) William F. Jordan, USNR, of VC-91 went down in a Wildcat (BuNo 73617) but a destroyer rescued Jordan. Lookouts sighted enemy planes circling about three miles off the ship's port bow at about 6,000 feet at 1848 on 7 January 1945, near 16¬∞N, 119¬∞10'E. The rumble of antiaircraft fire from the cruisers and destroyers increased in crescendo; however, in a few minutes two Japanese Nakajima Ki-43 Hayabusa Army Type 1 fighter planes detached from their formation and flew toward the carriers. One of the Oscars turned at 1857 and dived on Kitkun Bay from a relative bearing of 330¬∞. All available guns including Montpelier (CL-57) and Phoenix (CL-46) opened up on the Oscar and shot off parts of the plane, but the pilot continued his dive through what the ship's historian described as ‚Äúmurderous fire,‚Äù levelled off close to the water at 3,000 yards, and crashed the suicide plane through the port side at the waterline amidships. An explosion and large fire flared up simultaneously with a hit by a 5-inch round from one of the other ships, which burst close to the carrier's bow below a gun sponson, killing and wounding several men‚Äîthe attack killed 16 men altogether and wounded another 37. The Oscar tore a hole in the ship's side approximately 20 feet long and nine feet high between frames 113 and 121, extending three feet below the waterline. Kitkun Bay lost power and began listing to port rapidly as her after engine room, machine shop, and gyro spaces flooded. The list increased to 13¬∞ with the trim down by the stern four feet at 1904. Maintainers shifted planes to the starboard side of the flight deck to help correct the list. Firefighters valiantly battled the blaze and extinguished the flames by 1910, but the flooding continued as seawater poured into the ship in spite of the efforts of the engineers and repair party to contain the damage. Rear Adm. Ofstie prudently ordered all secret and confidential publications destroyed to prevent them from falling into enemy hands. The Medical Department tended to the wounded, and then the captain passed the orders to transfer all ‚Äúunnecessary‚Äù crewmen off the ship; wounded first. Destroyers took off 724 men, leaving less than 200 on board‚Äîthe rescue party supplemented by volunteers. ‚ÄúWe stayed upon the flight deck,‚Äù Lt. Thomlinson reflected, ‚Äúready to scramble into the sea, except when we had urgent business below decks. At 19 degrees list there‚Äôs no comfort on a carrier.‚Äù Despite the risk of a fire touching off ammunition and fuel on board Kitkun Bay, fleet ocean tug Chowanac (ATF-100) closed the carrier and secured a tow line to her at 2042, and they proceeded toward Santiago Island in the vicinity of Lingayen Gulf. The engineers got steam up in the forward engine room and the damage control teams reduced the list to four degrees. Hopewell (DD-681) and Taylor (DD-468) left the formation to guide and escort Shamrock Bay (CVE-84), which operated a distance away, back into the group, and the carrier joined them during the mid watch. Ofstie then transferred his flag to Shamrock Bay. Unidentified aircraft were reported nearby at 1430 on 9 January 1945, and the gun crews resignedly manned their weapons, though no attack developed. VC-91 counted 15 FM-2s, one FM-2P, a photographic variant, ten TBM-3s, and a single TBM-3P on board Kitkun Bay. The kamikaze claimed at least two Wildcats (BuNos 73589 and 74027) parked on board the ship. The situation nonetheless looked more hopeful as the morning progressed. The forward engine room had a head of steam and at 0815 eight fighters appeared overhead and protectively flew CAP over the ships. As the vessels approached Lingayen Gulf, crewmen sighted gunfire from both sides as the fighting continued ashore. Kitkun Bay gradually restored power and communications, and the tug cast off at 1030 and the carrier proceeded under her own steam, with speed limited to eight knots because of salt water steaming. Kitkun Bay lowered her colors to half mast at 1130 while the ship's company committed their fallen shipmates to the deep. Kitkun Bay proceeded on a westerly course to rendezvous with TG 77.4, but at 1822 received a report of enemy aircraft closing on the formation from the east. The warship sounded general quarters, and, although she could only make ten knots, a brisk breeze from the north enabled her to head into the wind and launch five Wildcats. The Japanese planes swung around and retired to the south without pressing an attack. The wind dropped to barely 15 knots and it was nearly dark by 1907 when the ship recovered her last fighters. The ship operated in the vicinity of the task group throughout the 10th, a day punctuated by two air alerts, though the enemy did not attack. Increasingly heavy seas that evening made the battered carrier's seaworthiness doubtful and maneuvering difficult. Capt. Albert Handly, the commanding officer, requested permission to join the first slow convoy to Leyte that passed in the area, and at 2200 Kitkun Bay received a message to join some tank landing ships of TU 79.14.3 and make for that island. Kitkun Bay held the course and station by using the magnetic compass while she limped nearly 500 miles to Leyte Gulf during the next several days. On the 11th, Lt. (j.g.) James A. Jones, USNR, of VC-91 crashed in a Wildcat (BuNo 73623) flying from the ship but a plane guard destroyer rescued him. On the 14th, the ship launched her own CAP, and later sent the fighters on to Tacloban Airfield on Leyte. Sighting Leyte that afternoon, Kitkun Bay entered Surigao Strait at 2336, and the following morning anchored in Leyte Gulf. Work on the ship progressed despite an enemy air raid on the night of the 18th. Smoke screens mostly obscured the Allied ships anchored in the roadstead, so the Japanese planes bombed some of the searchlights positioned on the beaches that they could spot. Additional air alerts sent the crew to their battle stations more than once, but they placed a patch over the hole in the side and pumped the water out of the flooded compartments. Men discovered a Japanese 550-pound armor-piercing bomb wedged into the No. 3 boiler on the 20th. The deadly device had torn through Kitkun Bay and stopped there without exploding, but ordnance disposal sailors from Leyte boarded the ship and cut through the boiler to remove the bomb‚Äîwhile all hands stayed clear of the area. The bomb experts discovered a second unexploded 550-pounder in the previously flooded machine shop, and de-armed and jettisoned over the side both bombs, the first one at 2306 and the second at 1510 the following day. ‚ÄúExperiment with converging or diverging boresight patterns on AA [antiaircraft] weapons,‚Äù Capt. Handly subsequently recommended to the fleet. ‚ÄúMake similar research with range setting and deflection devices. Try the elimination of all tracer and all 5-inch except Mark 32 or similar marks to deny pilot the knowledge of where the AA is and relieve gunners of the confusion of many bursts which tend to hide the plane, particularly at twilight. Tracers did not appear to assist our own gunners, and many guns apparently fired at 5-inch bursts.‚Äù The Navy consistently evaluated the results of these battles and evaluators noted that the optimum pattern of antiaircraft guns and their systems varied greatly with the control, weapon, ammunition‚Äîand the action of the target. The fleet made tracerless 20-millimeter and 40-millimeter rounds available, and VT (proximity) fuzes did not have tracers. ‚ÄúIf the control is adequate,‚Äù investigators responded, ‚Äúthe suggestion has considerable merit, although there is an undeniable psychological effect of tracers, both on the gunner and the attacking pilot.‚Äù Handly's dearly bought experience inspired him to make a number of other suggestions: ‚ÄúTest the value of a very tight screen, possibly with escort vessels closing to 200 yards upon Red alerts, to concentrate firepower, bolster morale, reduce deflection and reduce the masking of fire when low attacks fly between ships.....Place OBB‚Äôs [old battleships] in the center of CVE formations.‚Äù ‚ÄúThe best attempt to train was a number of simulated surprise attacks conducted by our embarked planes which afforded our gunners, lookouts and CIC [Combat Information Center] personnel an opportunity to improve their alertness making dry runs. These drills were effective, but did not enable us to stop the last attack...It is suggested that immediate research be pursued along the following lines by appropriate activities: Develop a target for realistic gunnery exercises. This could be a water fillable bomb with a target sleeve attached, and containing a radio controlled device to explode the bomb harmlessly before it could strike the firing ship after being launched by a dive bomber. Radio-controlled gliders or drones, similarly equipped, would be still better.‚Äù In addition, the captain expressed his concern about how close Japanese aircraft approached ships before the latter opened fire, in part because of the gunners‚Äô fears of hitting their own returning planes. Handly thus proposed what, at first glance, seems a harsh yet practical solution: ‚ÄúEnforce with a shoot - regardless policy, a doctrine prohibiting friendly pilots from making any but the prescribed approach to a formation of ships. Time cannot be wasted on positive identification.‚Äù The captain's recommendation seemed merited in light of the horrific casualties the kamikazes caused. Kitkun Bay stood out for home on 24 January 1945, her temporary repairs completed and 95 percent of the flooded compartments pumped out. A kamikaze had crashed Salamaua (CVE-96) on the 13th, and the damaged carrier and a screen accompanied Kitkun Bay, which sailed in tactical command of the group. The ships dropped anchor in Seeadler Harbor on 30 January, and the following day her men continued work on repairing their vessel. VC-91 detached on 4 February with orders to embark on board Savo Island, and Kitkun Bay‚Äôs historian observed that ‚Äúwith them went the gratitude and best wishes of the ship‚Äôs company.‚Äù The ship loaded some aviation gasoline and ordnance, and the convoy resumed their voyage and steamed uneventfully to Pearl Harbor (5‚Äì17 February), where Kitkun Bay moored to Ford Island. The warship discharged her remaining aviation gasoline and considerable ammunition, and then turned further eastward and sailed to Naval Dry Docks, an activity on Terminal Island near San Pedro, Calif. (20‚Äì28 February). Kitkun Bay granted leave to the ship's company in two periods of 20 days each. The welcome news marked the first leave for most of the crew following an extended tour of combat duty. While the ship completed repairs on 26 February 1945, VC-7 received orders to report to her no later than 10 April. The squadron increased its tempo of training at Naval Air Auxiliary Station (NAAS) Monterey, Calif., but on the following day also participated in simulated close support attacks on the Army's nearby Camp Hunter Liggett. The squadron granted pre-embarkation leave of ten days to all hands on 6 March. On the 19th, Ens. Jack Edwards, successfully landed an FM-2 in the water when his engine failed about 34 miles off Point Pinos. Attack transport Cullman (APA-78) steamed in the area and rescued Edwards after he spent only 16 minutes in his life raft. The Navy cancelled VC-7's orders to Kitkun Bay on 13 April, however, and the men and planes of the squadron subsequently served on board other ships and stations. Kitkun Bay wrapped-up the yard work and stood out of San Pedro with a full load of planes and carried them to Hawaiian waters (27 April‚Äì3 May 1945). The ship delivered her cargo to Pearl Harbor and into the following week cleaned- up from the repairs. In the process, yard workers at Pearl Harbor discovered that she required more work on the engines and the radar gear, which delayed her departure. Kitkun Bay returned to sea for a post-trial run on 3 June, during which she also carried our drills and gunnery exercises. The veteran ship slipped back into the harbor that evening to enable the navy yard to complete some engineering work. She loaded provisions and ammunition, along with the FM-2s, TBM-3s, and a single TBM-1C of VC-63, which had flown from NAS Hilo on Hawaii. The carrier then (8‚Äì13 June) took part in training exercises in the operating area west of Oahu. On the 9th, Ens. Max I. Polkowski of VC-63 wrecked in a TBM-3E (BuNo 85735) he flew from the ship, but a destroyer rescued the pilot. The string of ill fortune continued as just the very next day, Lt. (j.g.) Richard C. Bunten, USNR, of VC-63 crashed in a Wildcat (BuNo 74781), but a destroyer retrieved Bunten from the water as well. Kitkun Bay returned to Pearl Harbor and at 0800 on 15 June 1945, stood down the channel and steamed independently to Guam, holding frequent gunnery drills en route (15‚Äì27 June). The ship anchored in the harbor at Apra, and the next day unloaded her squadron and took fuel on board. Kitkun Bay proceeded to Ulithi, but while en route on the 28th, Ens. Walter R. Winiecki, USNR, of VC-63 went down in an FM-2 Wildcat (BuNo 74798), but a destroyer pulled the pilot from the sea and later returned him to the ship. Kitkun Bay reported to Third Fleet Logistic Support Group, TF 30.8, Rear Adm. Donald B. Beary, on the 29th, and loaded provisions and topped off fuel while at the atoll. The ship joined Steamer Bay (CVE-87) and some other vessels and cleared Ulithi on 3 July 1945, and about three hours later, they formed Carrier Cover Unit, TU 30.8.23, to take part in raids against the Japanese home islands. The Allies planned to invade Japan through two principal plans: Operation Olympic‚Äîlandings on Kyushu scheduled for 1 November 1945; and Coronet‚Äîlandings on Honsh≈´ scheduled for 1 March 1946. Olympic included a diversion against Shikoku to precede the main landings, and the enemy prepared to defend the islands ferociously. ‚ÄúThe sooner [the Americans] come, the better‚Ä¶One hundred million die proudly,‚Äù a Japanese slogan exhorted their people. The enemy deployed massed formations of kamikazes, as well as kaiten manned suicide torpedoes, shinyo suicide motorboats, and human mines‚Äîsoldiers were to strap explosives to their bodies and crawl beneath Allied tanks and vehicles. The preparations to support these landings included a series of carrier and surface raids by Halsey's Third Fleet against Japanese airfields, ships, and installations from Ky≈´sh≈´ to Hokkaido. Flt. Adm. Chester W. Nimitz, Commander-in-Chief, Pacific Fleet, defined Halsey's mission as to: ‚Äúattack Japanese naval and air forces, shipping, shipyards, and coastal objectives,‚Äù and to ‚Äúcover and support Ryukyus forces.‚Äù As part of this massive undertaking, McCain sailed with TF 38 from Leyte on 1 July 1945. The three task groups under McCain's command, Rear Adm. Thomas Sprague's TG 38.1, Rear Adm. Gerald F. Bogan's TG 38.3, and Rear Adm. Arthur W. Radford's TG 38.4, each comprised an average of three Essex (CV-9)-class carriers and two small carriers. A replenishment group and an antisubmarine group each included escort carriers. Kitkun Bay and Steamer Bay shared launching daily CAP and antisubmarine patrols, and rendezvoused with other ships of TF 38 on 8 July. That night the reinforced task force fueled and turned toward the first battles of the voyage, when, on 10 July, they hurled strikes against Japanese airfields in the T≈çky≈ç plains area. The enemy camouflaged and dispersed most of their planes, reducing the aerial opposition encountered but also diminishing the results obtained. Lt. Herbert Tonry, USNR, of VC-63 went down in an FM-2 Wildcat (BuNo 74923) he flew from Kitkun Bay on the 12th, but a destroyer rescued the pilot. Harsh weather compelled the Americans to shift their attacks to airfields, vessels, and railroads in northern Honsh≈´ and Hokkaido (14‚Äì15 July), and these two days of raids wrought havoc with the vital shipment of Japanese coal across the Tsugaru Strait. Allied carrier planes bombed targets around T≈çky≈ç on 17 July, and night CAP of planes flying from Bon Homme Richard (CV-31) protected U.S. and British ships that shelled six major industrial plants in the Mito-Hitachi area of Honsh≈´. The following day, the carriers launched aircraft against the naval station at Yokosuka and airfields near T≈çky≈ç. The raiders sank training cruiser Kasuga, incomplete escort destroyer Yaezakura, submarine I-372, submarine chaser Harushima, auxiliary patrol vessels Pa No. 37, Pa No. 110, and Pa No. 122, and motor torpedo boat Gyoraitei No. 28, and damaged Nagato, target ship Yakaze, motor torpedo boat Gyoraitei No. 256, landing ship T.110, and auxiliary submarine chaser Cha 225. Carrier raids damaged battleship Haruna and carriers Amagi and Katsuragi on 19 July. Kitkun Bay and Steamer Bay sent their planes aloft daily to protect the other ships from enemy aircraft or submarines. Kitkun Bay and her consorts protected the group until they rendezvoused with the heavy carriers of the task force and replenished on 20 July 1945. Two days later, McCain set out for more raids and on 24 July attacked Japanese airfields and shipping along the Inland Sea and northern Ky≈´sh≈´, supported by long-range strikes by USAAF bombers. Carrier planes flew 1,747 sorties and sank 21 ships including battleship Hy≈´ga, Tone, training cruiser Iwate, and target ship Settsu, and damaged 17 vessels. The carriers repeated their sweep the following day. Carrier planes struck targets between Nagoya and northern Ky≈´sh≈´ on 28 July, sinking a number of ships including Haruna, Ise, training ship Izumo, Aoba, light cruiser ≈åyodo, escort destroyer Nashi, submarine I-404, and submarine depot ship Komahashi. Aircraft damaged additional vessels. The ship's planes and escort ships often sighted and sank mines. Despite their maneuvering at times 400‚Äì500 miles from the Japanese home islands, the Carrier Cover Unit never encountered opposition. Kitkun Bay operated about 450 miles to the southeast of Honsh≈´, in the vicinity of the Third Fleet rendezvous, as part of the Logistics Support Group, and took part in the third replenishment rendezvous on the last day of the month A typhoon approached the Third Fleet but Halsey brought the ships about on 31 July and 1 August southward to a position near 25¬∞N, 137¬∞E, to evade the tempest. On the evening of the 3rd, the task force departed for another series of strikes. The following day, Kitkun Bay, Nehenta Bay, Carlson (DE-9), and Dionne (DE-261) formed TU 30.18.27 and came about for Eniwetok. A forge in Kitkun Bay‚Äôs shipfitter‚Äôs shop exploded at 10:34 on 4 August 1945. The blast caused a fire and burned several men, and two sailors trapped by the fire in that area jumped overboard to avoid the flames. Dionne swung around and rescued both men, and later returned them to the carrier. The conflagration fatally burned one of the victims, but firefighters quickly extinguished the blaze. Kitkun Bay sighted Eniwetok at daybreak on the 9th, and the task unit was dissolved as the ships proceeded individually and anchored at the atoll. Capt. John S. Greenslade relieved Capt. Handly two days later, and Handly proudly announced that he turned over a ‚Äúfighting crew and a fighting ship.‚Äù While the ship prepared to rejoin the carrier sweeps against the Japanese home islands, she received news of the enemy's willingness to surrender. Kitkun Bay then loaded foul weather gear because she received orders to turn northward and serve under Vice Adm. Frank Jack Fletcher, Commander, Ninth Fleet, and Alaskan Sea Frontier. Fanshaw Bay, Kitkun Bay, and their escorts formed TU 49.5.2 and set out at 0700 on 16 August for their northern journey. The two carriers operated as the duty carrier on alternate days during the voyage, but foul weather pummeled the ships and prevented flight operations. The seasoned warships steamed through Amutka Pass and entered the Bering Sea on 23 August, and the next morning Kitkun Bay moored to a buoy in Kulak Bay on the Bering (northwestern) side of Adak Island in the Aleutians. The vessels anchored in the shadow of show-capped peaks surmounting the treeless green tundra, and refueled and loaded supplies. Kitkun Bay shifted to Sweeper's Cove at Adak, where nearly 6,000 soldiers toured the ship the following day. That evening she cast off from the pier and returned to Kulak Bay. From there, Fanshaw Bay, Hoggatt Bay (CVE-75), Kitkun Bay, Manila Bay, Nehenta Bay, Savo Island, and their screen including Chester (CA-27), Pensacola (CA-24), and Salt Lake City (CA-25), sailed in TF 49, Rear Adm. Harold M. Martin, Commander, CarDiv 23, who broke his flag in Hoggatt Bay, and participated in the occupation of the northern Japanese home islands (31 August‚Äì9 September 1945). Later that day, the task force was redesignated TF 44, and operated within range of Vice Adm. Fletcher, who hoisted his flag in amphibious force flagship Panamint (AGC-13). Fletcher set out to receive the formal Japanese surrender of their forces in northern Honsh≈´ and Hokkaido. The carriers launched daily CAP and antisubmarine patrols, and the aircraft and ships sighted and destroyed frequent mines en route. An Avenger flying from Kitkun Bay became unable to maintain altitude while attempting an emergency landing on 5 September. The torpedo bomber crashed into the sea as the pilot turned to clear the ship's stern, and Fullam (DD-474) raced over and rescued all three men, and returned the shaken but uninjured crew to the carrier within the hour. Before dawn on the 7th, Kitkun Bay detected a small Japanese patrol craft 3,000 yards on the beam. One of the destroyers intercepted and investigated the vessel, and the convoy continued the voyage. Lookouts sighted Hokkaido early that morning and at 1130 northern Honsh≈´ appeared on the horizon. The carriers launched photographic planes over the next few days that obtained pictures of coastal installations and traffic on land and the coastal waterways. When the officer in tactical command discovered camps holding Allied prisoners of war as a result of discussions with Japanese prisoners, he promptly ordered all of the available torpedo planes to carry vitally needed supplies to the prisoners, who suffered from malnutrition and disease resulting from Japanese neglect and brutality. Kitkun Bay did her share and launched Avengers that carried six tons of medical supplies, food, clothing, and cigarettes and dropped them to the emaciated men, many of whom lacked the strength to even cheer their liberators. The aircraft also parachuted radios to the prisoners, which enabled the ship to establish communications with the men. The last of the planes recovered on board Kitkun Bay shortly after 1100 on 13 September 1945, and she and three of the other carriers and their nine escorts turned toward Tsugaru Strait. The column passed through the strait while gunfire detonated mines to either side (1430‚Äì1815), and Kitkun Bay detached and entered Mutsu Bay, where she anchored at ≈åminato in northern Honsh≈´ at 2014. The Japanese used the port as their main naval station in the north, and although rumors circulated that the enemy might oppose the landings, the garrison had obeyed their high command's orders to surrender without resisting on the 9th. A number of ships of the Fourth Fleet and numerous district and harbor craft also plied the busy harbor or lay at anchor. Howarth (DD-592) led Kitkun Bay back out to sea on 14 September, and four hours later they entered the anchorage at Hakodate, Hokkaido, to be greeted by British destroyer Barfleur (D.80), which already lay anchored in the harbor. A trio of Japanese tugs flying white surrender flags chugged alongside, one of which brought the British liaison officer on board to expedite the transfer of the Allied prisoners held ashore. Three Japanese officers called on Capt. Greenslade at 1618, but a few minutes later, Japanese antiaircraft fire erupted from the foothills of the harbor, about five miles away. The guns fired more than half- a-dozen times that afternoon and Japanese officials explained that they were celebrating a festival. The exasperated Americans explained the likelihood of misunderstandings that could lead to more fighting, and the Japanese agreed to halt further demonstrations until the ships departed. Kitkun Bay brought a number of freed Allied prisoners on board to return them to their homes and loved ones. Many of the men included survivors of the Wake Detachment, First Defense Battalion, USMC, which had served under Maj. James P.S. Devereux, USMC, and Marine Fighting Squadron (VMF) 211, Maj. Paul A. Putnam, USMC, during their epic defense of Wake Island against the Japanese (8‚Äì23 December 1941). Both Devereux and Putnam received the Navy Cross for their valiant defense of the island, and were freed and returned home by separate means. Additional liberated prisoners included sailors and marines captured by the Japanese at Shanghai, China, in 1941, and merchant seamen taken from their ships in several other ports. The newly released men savored their freedom, and praised the food, coffee, and cigarettes the planes had dropped to them. The ship weighed anchor the following morning at 0856 on 15 September 1945, in answer to an urgent radio appeal to rescue wounded, sick, and malnourished Allied prisoners still languishing in Japanese captivity that required immediate medical treatment. Kitkun Bay launched eight planes carrying liaison parties to Chitose, an airfield on Hokkaido from which the Japanese had sent kamikazes against Allied ships. The aircraft picked up seven ambulatory British Royal Air Force (RAF) servicemen and brought them back on board by noon. The carrier then cleared the anchorage, turned her prow southward, and dropped anchor at Yokohama on 17 September. After an early lunch, the RAF survivors boarded medium landing ship LSM-208 with the first leg of their long homeward journey completed. The fighting against the Japanese had ended but not the eternal struggle against the sea. A typhoon lashed the area that night and Kitkun Bay made ready to get underway if necessary. The wind increased until gusts above 75 knots whipped up the sea in the sheltered bay and caused her anchor to drag. The ship maneuvered on one engine in order to avoid drifting and colliding with Ticonderoga (CV-14), which lay nearby. The tempest swamped or set adrift numerous boats and landing craft, among them the captain's gig. Kitkun Bay alternatively used both engines that morning to relieve the strain on the anchor chain and to minimize yawing. The wind abated by noon to a comparatively moderate 45 knots. The crew rode out the typhoon and savored their first liberty ashore on the Japanese mainland during the ship's ten-day (17‚Äì27 September 1945) stay in the T≈çky≈ç Bay area. Many of the men explored the devastated cities and purchased souvenir trinkets from the people. Vessels of every description packed the bay when Kitkun Bay arrived, but multiple ships departed each day, and only a few major warships, several dozen destroyers and escorts, some auxiliaries, and a variety of landing craft remained when the carrier prepared to turn for home. The escort carrier shifted to the Fifth Fleet on 19 September and then (27 September‚Äì19 October 1945) took part in Operation Magic Carpet‚Äîthe return of veterans from the war zones by ships and aircraft. Kitkun Bay made her maiden Magic Carpet voyage carrying 554 troops, and Howarth joined her as they formed TU 16.12.26 and headed for the United States. The two ships touched at Apra, Guam, and Pearl Harbor on their return cruise, and Kitkun Bay slipped beneath the Golden Gate Bridge and moored at San Francisco as she brought the grateful veterans home. Additional voyages to Pearl Harbor and the west coast, and a cruise to Okinawa, concluded at San Pedro on 12 January 1946, and the following day Kitkun Bay moved to the Nineteenth Fleet. The ship steamed up the west coast and entered Puget Sound Naval Shipyard, Bremerton, Wash., on 18 February. Kitkun Bay steamed 137,000 miles during her commissioned service, the equivalent of more than five times around the world. The ship crossed the equator a dozen times, and the International Date Line ten times. She withstood heavy caliber Japanese gunfire, and fought off enemy planes that attacked her in both the conventional and suicide rolls. Planes flying from her flight deck claimed to down 26 enemy aircraft, and sank or contributed to sinking two Japanese heavy cruisers and two barges, damaged a battleship and a heavy cruiser, and destroyed five tanks on the ground. Twenty-seven men of the ship's company died and 58 sustained wounds. Inspectors from the Board of Inspection and Survey even so responded to the large-scale draw down following the war, and recommended that she ‚Äúwas not essential to defense of U.S.‚Äù and should be decommissioned with a view to sell the hulk for scrap. Consequently, Kitkun Bay was decommissioned on 19 April 1946, at Port Angeles, Wash., and stricken on 8 May. The Navy sold the ship for $12,700 to Zidell Ship Dismantling Company of Portland, Ore., on 18 November 1946. The veteran carrier was moved in January 1947, and by that October was reported scrapped. Kitkun Bay received six battle stars for World War II service, and shared in the award of the Presidential Unit Citation to Taffy 3 for extraordinary heroism in the Battle off Samar.

It was named after Kadashan Bay, located within Chichagof Island. The bay in turn was named after Paul K. Kadashan, an Alaskan Indian who established a homestead incorporating the bay in 1915. Launched in December 1943, and commissioned in January 1944, she served in support of the Mariana and Palau Islands campaign, the Battle off Samar, and the Invasion of Lingayen Gulf. Postwar, she participated in Operation Magic Carpet. She was decommissioned in June 1946, when she was mothballed in the Atlantic Reserve Fleet. Ultimately, she was sold for scrapping in February 1960. Design and description A profile of the design of , which was shared with all Casablanca-class escort carriers. Kadashan Bay was a Casablanca-class escort carrier, the most numerous type of aircraft carriers ever built, and designed specifically to be mass-produced using prefabricated sections, in order to replace heavy early war losses. Standardized with her sister ships, she was long overall, had a beam of , and a draft of . She displaced standard, with a full load. She had a long hangar deck and a long flight deck. She was powered with two Unaflow reciprocating steam engines, which drove two shafts, providing , thus enabling her to make . The ship had a cruising range of at a speed of . Her compact size necessitated the installment of an aircraft catapult at her bow, and there were two aircraft elevators to facilitate movement of aircraft between the flight and hangar deck: one each fore and aft. One /38 caliber dual-purpose gun was mounted on the stern. Anti-aircraft defense was provided by eight Bofors anti- aircraft guns in single mounts, as well as twelve Oerlikon cannons, which were mounted around the perimeter of the deck. By the end of the war, Casablanca- class carriers had been modified to carry thirty cannons, and the amount of Bofors guns had been doubled to sixteen, by putting them into twin mounts. These modifications were in response to increasing casualties due to kamikaze attacks. Casablanca-class escort carriers were designed to carry 27 aircraft, but the hangar deck could accommodate more. During the Mariana and Palau Islands campaign, she carried 16 FM-2 fighters, and 11 TBM-1C torpedo bombers, for a total of 27 aircraft. However, during the Battle off Samar, she carried 24 FM-2 fighters and 9 TBM-1C torpedo bombers for a total of 33 aircraft. During the Invasion of Lingayen Gulf, she carried 22 FM-2 fighters, 11 TBM-1C torpedo bombers, and a TBM-1CP reconnaissance plane. Construction The escort carrier was laid down on 2 September 1943, under a Maritime Commission contract, MC hull 1113, by Kaiser Shipbuilding Company, Vancouver, Washington. She was named Kadashan Bay, as part of a tradition which named escort carriers after bays or sounds in Alaska. She was launched on 11 December 1943; sponsored by Miss Audrey Ackerman; transferred to the United States Navy and commissioned on 18 January 1944, with Captain Robert Nisbet Hunter in command. Service history Upon being commissioned, Kadashan Bay underwent a shakedown cruise off of San Diego. On 6 March, she departed San Diego on a cruise to Espiritu Santo. She made two runs, transporting 154 aircraft, before returning to San Diego on 13 May. Following a brief period of repairs and training, the escort carrier sailed on 10 July to join a Task Group 32.7 at Pearl Harbor. This task group was formed in preparation for the imminent Mariana and Palau Islands campaign. As a part of Carrier Division 27, under the command of Rear Admiral William Sample, she sailed alongside , , and , which served as the flagship. In August, she sailed for Tulagi, where final preparations were made for the imminent invasion. Her task group departed Tulagi on 6 September, arriving off of Peleliu on 11 September. There, the escort carriers launched airstrikes to destroy defenses and to prepare the way for landings, although the impact by these bombings proved to be insufficient. The marines landed on 15 September, seizing the air field, and finding themselves in a battle of attrition against a determined Japanese garrison. Kadashan Bay stayed offshore the island, providing close air support until the beginning of October, when she retired to Manus to restock on supplies. After a short period of rest, she steamed towards Leyte Gulf on 14 October, providing cover for Task Group 78.6, a reinforcement group which would stay offshore of Leyte. Upon arriving on 21 October and joining Taffy 2, she began conducting airstrikes in support of troops which had already landed. On 25 October, one of her fighters, piloted by Ensign Hans L. Jensen, on a routine patrol mission, sighted the Central Force of the Japanese fleet off of Samar. After reporting his sighting, he launched an unsupported attack against the leading cruiser, beginning the decisive Battle off Samar. Once learning of the size and the importance of the Japanese fleet, she launched three fighter and three torpedo strikes against the Japanese force, which was threatening Taffy 3. The large amount of American planes were a contributing force in convincing Vice admiral Takeo Kurita to retire, and to not take advantage of his position. On 30 October, she retired for Manus, where she arrived on 3 November. In late November, the escort carriers began departing Manus and congregating at Kossol Roads, and on 10 December, she sortied for Mindoro. From 12 to 13 December, she transited the Surigao Strait, and as she moved west, her task group came under heavy aerial attack. In these actions, her fighters accounted for eleven planes, with running battles continuing to the end of December. By now, preparations were underway for the Invasion of Lingayen Gulf. As part of Vice Admiral Daniel E. Barbey's San Fabian task group, she provided air cover for the ships as they proceeded behind the main force. Eventually, she rendezvoused with the main force covering the landings on 3 January 1945. Kadashan Bay with a Nakajima Ki-43 kamikaze aircraft diving towards it. Heavy anti-aircraft fire is visible. Photographed from Marcus Island. Kadashan Bay arrived off of Luzon on 8 January, where she prepared to commence operations. At 7:00 that morning, she, along with Marcus Island, launched two squadrons of fighters. At 7:16, radar detected a large contingent of Japanese aircraft, to the east of the task group, which separated into three groups. The fighters moved to intercept, with other escort carriers contributing their own fighters. At 7:46, Kadashan Bay finished launching her last four fighters, and as they struggled for altitude, a Nakajima Ki-43 kamikaze aircraft dove towards the carrier. Whilst the newly launched fighters were helpless against the first kamikaze, they did manage to shoot down a different kamikaze, a Kawasaki Ki-61 fighter which attempted to follow up on Kadashan Bay. Kadashan Bay, having finished overhaul, at San Francisco on 8 April 1945. The Nakajima Ki-43 that the fighter crews had spotted were also noticed by the crew of Kadashan Bay. The crew observed the plane break away from an engagement several miles east, and head straight towards the carrier. Consequently, the ship's crew started a hard left turn in an attempt to stall for time. Although the aircraft came under heavy anti-aircraft fire, it continued, aiming directly for the carrier's bridge. Perhaps as a result of the concentrated fire, it then plunged down, striking below the bridge at the waterline, tearing a by hole, destroying the junior officers' quarters. The kamikaze sparked a brief gasoline fire, which was quickly put under control. A more pressing concern was flooding, which was accentuated by the ship's turn. Her gasoline system was inoperative, and her bow sank below design specifications. Remarkably, no-one was killed, and only three crewmen were wounded by the kamikaze. Nonetheless, the damage forced Kadashan Bay to retire from operations. On 10 January, she transferred her aircraft contingent to Marcus Island, and she returned to Leyte on 12 January for temporary repairs. On 13 February, she arrived at San Diego for further repairs, and then reported at San Francisco for complete overhaul. Once overhaul was finished, she sailed for Pearl Harbor on 8 April, where she arrived on 14 April. She would spend the rest of the war ferrying aircraft and men throughout the Pacific. During July the escort carrier was designated as a replenishment carrier for the Third Fleet. She was en route from Pearl Harbor to begin her new duty when the news of Japan's surrender was received. =Post-war= After the end of the war, Kadashan Bay joined Operation Magic Carpet, which repatriated U.S. servicemen from throughout the Pacific. She reported at Guam in September and arrived at San Francisco on 26 September with her first group of veterans. For the next three months, the escort carrier conducted Magic Carpet runs, stopping at Pearl Harbor, Guam, Okinawa, and China. She arrived at San Pedro on 22 December to finish her last Pacific cruise, and departed San Diego on 10 January 1946, bound for Boston. Kadashan Bay arrived at Boston on 29 January, was decommissioned on 14 June 1946, and subsequently placed in the Atlantic Reserve Fleet there. She was reclassified CVU-76 on 12 June 1955. She was redesignated as an aircraft ferry on 7 May 1959, and given the hull symbol AKV-26. She was struck from the Navy list on 1 August 1959 and sold for scrap to Comarket Inc. on February 1960. She was broken up in Hong Kong, starting June 1960.

In all, he played 455 first-class matches, amassing 34,346 runs at 49.70, including 103 centuries--making him one of a select few to score a \\"century of centuries\\", one of only four non-English cricketers to do so (the others being Donald Bradman, Zaheer Abbas and Viv Richards). Turner also coached the New Zealand side twice--once in the mid-1980s, when he presided over the team's first and (to date) only series victory in Australia, and again a decade later. Turner is one of only two players (the other being Graeme Hick in 1988 also for Worcestershire) since the Second World War to have scored 1000 first- class runs in England before the end of May, a feat he achieved in 1973. Among the eight batsmen who have done this, only Turner and Donald Bradman did it while playing for a touring team. Record breaking He also holds the record of highest percentage of runs scored in any completed innings 83.43% after he scored 141* out of Worcestershire's 169 against Glamorgan at Swansea in 1977. The remaining batsmen scored 27, highest 7 and there was one extra. On 29 May 1982, Turner became the first batsman in 33 years to score 300 runs in a single day in England. He was 311 not out when Worcestershire declared at 501-1 against Warwickshire. His 171 not out against East Africa in the 1975 World Cup is the longest individual innings in one-day international history, occupying 201 balls. Glenn Turner is also the first to score an ODI 150 as well as world cup 150 and also holds the record for the only batsman in ODI history to have faced over 200 deliveries in a single innings.

She originally designated an AVG, was classified ACV-68 on 20 August 1942; laid down under a Maritime Commission contract 26 April 1943 by the Kaiser Shipbuilding Co., Inc., Vancouver, Washington; reclassified CVE-68 on 15 July 1943; launched 15 October 1943; sponsored by Mrs. Anna Mary Updegraff, mother of Captain William N. Updegraff, U.S. Navy; and commissioned 27 November at Astoria, Oregon, Captain C. R. Brown in command. USS Kalinin Bay was named after a bay on the northern shore of Kruzof Island in the Alexander Archipelago of southeastern Alaska. Service history After shakedown along the Pacific Coast, Kalinin Bay departed San Diego 3 January 1944 for replenishment duty in the Pacific. Laden with troops and a cargo of planes, she steamed via Pearl Harbor for the Gilbert Islands, arriving off Tarawa Atoll 24 January to supply 5th Fleet carriers then engaged in the conquest of the Marshalls. For more than two weeks she provided logistic support from Tarawa to Majuro Atoll before returning to Alameda, California, 24 February. =Gilbert and Marshall Islands Campaign= With Composite Squadron 3 (VC-3) embarked 9 April, Kalinin Bay reached Majuro, Marshalls, 23 April; conducted ASW air patrols off Mili Atoll; and proceeded to Pearl Harbor 1 May to prepare for the Marianas operation. She departed Pearl Harbor 30 May; and, while en route to Saipan, she successfully evaded a Japanese torpedo that crossed her bow close aboard. Touching at Eniwetok 9 June, Kalinin Bay reached the eastern coast of Saipan 15 June and commenced air operations in support of the invasion. After repelling an enemy air attack at dusk on the 17th, she sailed 19 June to ferry planes to and from Eniwetok. Returning to Saipan 24 June, she resumed effective air strikes against enemy positions on the embattled island until 9 July when she steamed via Eniwetok for similar duty at Guam. Arriving 20 July, she launched direct support and ASW sorties until 2 August, then returned to Eniwetok to prepare for operations in the Palau Islands. =Mariana and Palau Islands Campaign= Kalinin Bay cleared Eniwetok 18 August and proceeded via Tulagi, Florida Island, to the Southern Palaus where she arrived 14 September with units of the 3rd Fleet. Ordered to furnish air support for the capture, occupation, and defense of Peleliu, Angaur, and Ngesebus, she launched air strikes to support landing operations. For 2 weeks her planes, flying almost 400 sorties, inflicted heavy damage on enemy ground installations and shipping. On 25 September, alone, they sank or destroyed three cargo transports and six landing barges. =Philippines Campaign= She departed the Palaus 30 September; and, upon arriving Seeadler Harbor, Manus Island, 3 October, she received a new commanding officer, Captain T. B. Williamson. Kalinin Bay departed Manus 12 October en route to the Philippine Islands. Ordered to provide air coverage and close air support during the bombardment and amphibious landings on Leyte Island, she arrived off Leyte 17 October. After furnishing air support during landings by Ranger units on Dinagat and Homonhon Islands in the eastern approaches to Leyte Gulf, she launched air strikes in support of invasion operations at Tacloban on the northeast coast of Leyte. Operating with Rear Admiral Clifton Sprague's \\"Taffy 3\\" (Task Unit 77.4.3), which consisted of 6 escort carriers and a screen of 3 destroyers and 4 destroyer escorts, Kalinin Bay sailed to the east of Leyte and Samar as her planes, flying 244 sorties from 18 to 24 October, struck and destroyed enemy installations and airfields on Leyte, Samar, Cebu, Negros, and Panay Islands. =The Battle off Samar= Steaming about 60 miles east of Samar before dawn 25 October, Taffy 3 prepared to launch the day's initial air strikes. At 0647, Rear Admiral Sprague received word that a sizable Japanese fleet was approaching from the northwest. Comprising four battleships, eight cruisers, and eleven destroyers, Vice Admiral Takeo Kurita's Center Force steadily closed and at 0658 opened fire on Taffy 3. So began the Battle off Samar‚Äîone of the most memorable engagements in U.S. naval history. Outnumbered and outgunned, the slower Taffy 3 seemed fated for disaster; but the American ships defied the odds and gamely accepted the enemy's challenge. Kalinin Bay accelerated to flank speed; and, despite fire from three enemy cruisers, she launched her planes, ordering the pilots \\"to attack the Japanese task force and proceed to Tacloban airstrip, Leyte, to rearm and regas.\\" As salvos fell \\"with disconcerting rapidity\\" increasingly nearer Kalinin Bay, her planes, striking the enemy force with bombs, rockets, and gunfire, inflicted heavy damage on the closing ships. As the trailing ship in the escort caravan, Kalinin Bay came under intense enemy fire. Though partially protected by chemical smoke, by a timely rain squall, and by valiant counterattacks of screening destroyers and destroyer escorts, she took the first of 15 direct hits at 0750. Fired from an enemy battleship, the large caliber shell (14 inch or 16 inch) struck the starboard side of the hangar deck just abaft the forward elevator. By 0800, the enemy cruisers, which were steaming off her port quarter, closed to within 18,000 yards. Kalinin Bay gamely responded to their straddling salvos with rapid fire from her single 5 inch gun, which only intensified the enemy fire. Three 8 inch, armor-piercing projectiles struck her within minutes of each other. At 0825, the carrier's 5-incher scored a direct hit from 16,000 yards on the No. 2 turret of a Nachi-class heavy cruiser, and a second hit shortly thereafter forced the enemy ship to withdraw temporarily from formation. At 0830, five enemy destroyers steamed over the horizon off her starboard quarter. The closing ships opened fire from about 14,500 yards; and, as screening ships engaged the cruisers and laid down concealing smoke, Kalinin Bay shifted her fire and, for the next hour, traded shots with Japan's Destroyer Squadron 10. Many salvos exploded close aboard or passed directly overhead; and, though no destroyer fire hit Kalinin Bay directly, she took ten more 8 inch hits from the now obscured cruisers. One shell passed through the flight deck and into the communications area, where it destroyed all the radar and radio equipment. Under heavy attack from the air and harassed by incessant fire from American destroyers and destroyer escorts, the enemy cruisers broke off action and turned northward at 0920. At 0915, the enemy destroyers, which were kept at bay by the daring and almost single-handed exploits of , launched a premature torpedo attack from 10,500 yards. As the torpedoes approached the escort carriers, they slowed down. A Grumman TBF Avenger from strafed and exploded two torpedoes in Kalinin Bay's wake about 100 yards astern, and a shell from the latter's 5 inch gun deflected a third from a collision course with her stern. At about 0930, as the enemy ships fired parting salvos and reversed course northward, Kalinin Bay scored a direct hit amidships on a retreating destroyer. Five minutes later, she ceased fire and retired southward with the surviving ships of Taffy 3. At 1050, the task unit came under a concentrated air attack. During the 40-minute battle, the first attack from a Kamikaze unit in World War II, all except were damaged. One plane of Lieutenant Yukio Seki and his Shikishima squadron crashed through St. Lo's flight deck and exploded her torpedo and bomb magazine, mortally wounding the carrier. Four diving planes attacked Kalinin Bay from astern and the starboard quarter. Intense fire splashed two close aboard; but a third plane crashed into the port side of the flight deck, damaging it badly. The fourth hit destroyed the aft port stack. As part of Taffy 3, Kalinin Bay had prevented a Japanese penetration into Leyte Gulf and saved General Douglas MacArthur's beachhead in the Philippines. At a cost of five ships and hundreds of men, Taffy 3, aided by her own planes and those of \\"Taffy 2\\" (Task Unit 77.4.2), sank three enemy cruisers, seriously damaged several other ships, and turned back the \\"most powerful surface fleet which Japan had sent to sea since the Battle of Midway.\\" Despite the battle damage, Taffy 3 cleared the air of attacking planes; at noon, the escort carriers retired southeastward while their escort searched for survivors from St. Lo. Though Kalinin Bay suffered extensive structural damage during the morning's furious action, she counted only 5 dead among her 60 casualties. Weary and battle scarred, Kalinin Bay was awarded the Presidential Unit Citation for heroic conduct as a unit of Taffy 3. She steamed via Woendi, Schouten Islands, to Manus, arriving 1 November for emergency repairs. Getting under way for the United States 7 November, the escort carrier reached San Diego 27 November for permanent repairs and alterations. End of career Repairs completed 18 January 1945, the veteran escort carrier departed San Diego 20 January to ferry planes and men to Pearl Harbor and Guam. For more than 8 months, she served as a replenishment carrier in the Pacific Carrier Transport Squadron; and, during six cruises between the West Coast and Pearl Harbor, Eniwetok, and Guam, she transported more than 600 planes. Departing San Diego 2 September, she steamed to the Philippines, arriving at Samar 28 September to participate in Operation Magic Carpet. With 1,048 men embarked, she departed Samar 1 October and arrived San Francisco 19 October. After conducting two more voyages between California and Pearl Harbor, Kalinin Bay departed San Diego 8 December for the Far East. On 25 December, while she steamed to Yokosuka, Japan, an intense storm heavily damaged her flight deck. Arriving the 27th, she received emergency repairs, then sailed 3 January 1946 for the West Coast and arrived San Diego 17 January. On 13 February, she proceeded to the eastern seaboard, reaching Boston 9 March. Kalinin Bay was decommissioned 15 May, and she was sold for scrap 8 December to Patapsco Steel Co., Baltimore, Maryland. Awards In addition to the Presidential Unit Citation, Kalinin Bay received five battle stars for World War II service.

It was named after Fanshaw Bay, located within Cape Fanshaw, of the Alexander Archipelago in the Territory of Alaska. The cape was given its name by Charles Mitchell Thomas, who was mapping the area, in 1887. Built for service during World War II, the ship was launched in November 1943, and commissioned in December, and served in support of the Mariana and Palau Islands campaign, the Battle off Samar, and the Battle of Okinawa. Postwar, she participated in Operation Magic Carpet. She was decommissioned in August 1946, when she was mothballed in the Pacific Reserve Fleet. Ultimately, she was sold for scrapping in September 1959. Design and description A profile of the design of , which was shared by all Casablanca-class escort carriers. Fanshaw Bay was a Casablanca-class escort carrier, the most numerous type of aircraft carriers ever built, and was designed specifically to be mass-produced using prefabricated sections, in order to replace heavy early war losses. Standardized with her sister ships, she was long overall, had a beam of , and a draft of . She displaced standard, with a full load. She had a long hangar deck and a long flight deck. She was powered with two Skinner Unaflow reciprocating steam engines, which drove two shafts, providing , thus enabling her to make . The ship had a cruising range of at a speed of . Her compact size necessitated the installment of an aircraft catapult at her bow, and there were two aircraft elevators to facilitate movement of aircraft between the flight and hangar deck: one each fore and aft. One /38 caliber dual-purpose gun was mounted on the stern. Anti- aircraft defense was provided by eight Bofors anti-aircraft guns in single mounts, as well as twelve Oerlikon cannons, which were mounted around the perimeter of the deck. By the end of the war, Casablanca-class carriers had been modified to carry thirty cannons, and the amount of Bofors guns had been doubled to sixteen, by putting them into twin mounts. These modifications were in response to increasing casualties due to kamikaze attacks. Casablanca-class escort carriers were designed to carry 27 aircraft, but the hangar deck could accommodate more. During the Mariana and Palau Islands campaign, the beginning of the Philippines campaign, and the Battle off Samar, she carried 16 FM-2 Wildcat fighters, and 12 TBM-1C Avenger torpedo bombers, for a total of 28 aircraft. However, during the Battle of Okinawa, she carried 24 FM-2 fighters and 6 TBM-3 torpedo bombers for a total of 30 aircraft. Construction The escort carrier was laid down on 18 May 1943, under a Maritime Commission contract, MC hull 1107, by Kaiser Shipbuilding Company, Vancouver, Washington. She was named Fanshaw Bay, as part of a tradition which named escort carriers after bays or sounds in Alaska. She was launched on 1 November 1943; sponsored by Mrs. Lorna V. Kenworthy, the wife of Captain Jesse L. Kenworthy Jr., who was the executive officer of the battleship during the Attack on Pearl Harbor. She was transferred to the United States Navy and commissioned on 9 December 1943, with Captain Douglass Pollock Johnson in command. Service history Fanshaw Bay underway, transporting aircraft, on 9 February 1944. Fanshaw Bay moored at Brisbane, Australia, on 10 February 1944, following a transport mission. Note that there are still Republic P-47 Thunderbolt fighters stored on-board her flight deck. Upon being commissioned, Fanshaw Bay took on armaments at Port Townsend, Washington on 31 December, and proceeded on a shakedown cruise down the West Coast. During this period, she a stop at Port Angeles, Washington from 6 January 1944 to 8 January, along with another pause at San Francisco, California between 11 and 16 January, where she took on a load of aircraft. She was also assigned to become the flagship of Carrier Division 25, commanded by Rear Admiral Gerald F. Bogan. She departed from San Francisco on 16 January, ferrying her load to Gladstone, Queensland, arriving on 2 February. On her return trip, she touched at Brisbane from 8 to 12 February, and at Noum√©a from 15 to 16 February. Upon returning, she underwent maintenance and her crew underwent leave at San Diego from 4 March to 6 April. There, Fanshaw Bay received her aircraft contingent, originally intended to be Composite Squadron 4 (VC-4), but switched to Composite Squadron 68 (VC-68), which consisted of 16 FM-2 fighters and 10 TBM-1C torpedo bombers. She departed San Diego on 6 April, accompanied by the seaplane tender , making a stop at Pearl Harbor on 10 April, and arriving at Majuro on 20 April. En route, on 11 April, one of her torpedo bombers crashed in an accident, with its crew being rescued by Orca. Upon arriving at Majuro, she began conducting antisubmarine patrols, along with the destroyer escorts , , and . Ten days of patrols returned no contacts, and she retired to Pearl Harbor. =Mariana and Palau Islands campaign= On 29 May, she sortied from Pearl Harbor, bound for Eniwetok Atoll, where she acted as the flagship of Task Group 52.14, which was assigned to support the upcoming Mariana and Palau Islands campaign. En route, two of her Wildcats were lost, and another was slightly damaged, through accidents. She began combat operations on 11 June, some west of Saipan, providing aerial reconnaissance, close air support, and antisubmarine patrols in support of the Battle of Saipan. On 15 June, at 17:15 in the late afternoon, the officers of Fanshaw Bay received a report of five Japanese aircraft proceeding towards her task group to her southwest. Fighters were scrambled, and the aircraft were intercepted away, harrying them as they quickly proceeded towards the carriers. Four of them were shot down, although a fifth aircraft was able to drop a torpedo aimed at Fanshaw Bay at 18:12. Fortunately for the carrier, the Japanese plane approaching from the starboard bow, perhaps disrupted by the anti-aircraft fire, dropped its torpedo at a slight turn. Therefore, Fanshaw Bay engaged in a hard right turn, easily dodging the torpedo. The Japanese aircraft was subsequently shot down at 18:15. On 17 June, one of Fanshaw Bays torpedo bombers conducting antisubmarine patrols crashed shortly after takeoff, veering port into the sea. A large explosion was triggered, likely from the detonation of one of the bomber's depth charges, killing all three of its crew. Later that day, another torpedo bomber was lost, and although two of the crew were recovered, the radioman drowned with the aircraft. In the late afternoon, the task group detected about seventy Japanese aircraft approaching quickly from the southeast, out. Fighters were scrambled, and Fanshaw Bay launched fourteen Wildcats to supplement the thirty-two launched by the other escort carriers. Her fighters, intercepting the planes, shot down one. Nonetheless, the Japanese force penetrated the air screen, and made for the carriers. Early on in the attack, the Japanese planes focused on Fanshaw Bay and . Her anti- aircraft guns provided adept assistance, shooting down three planes, and damaging two more. Sailors inspect the damage created from the bomb which smashed through Fanshaw Bays aft aircraft elevator. However, at 18:52, a Japanese bomber made a run for Fanshaw Bay, dropping a bomb (believed to be ) as it flew about above the carrier. The bomb penetrated into her aft aircraft elevator, punching through the wooden decking, and detonating within the hangar bay, some below the flight deck. Shrapnel was launched through the hangar, instantly killing eleven men of Repair Party 3, which had taken up position forward of the elevator. Munitions were stored on both sides of the elevator, and shrapnel sliced through three torpedoes, although they failed to detonate. Nonetheless, the blast had enough force to rupture a fire main, sever electrical cables, and to even eject depth charges from the bomb bays of the Avengers stored within the hangar deck. In addition, several fires were kindled, total steering control was lost, and the ship acquired a 3¬∞ list to the port. Although the fires were quickly put under control by the crew, several of her aircraft were compelled to land on other carriers as a result of the blazes. In the action, three planes from her aircraft contingent were lost in the turmoil, albeit there were no fatalities. Rear Admiral Bogan was also compelled to transfer his flag to the destroyer in order to more effectively lead the fleet. The rest of Fanshaw Bays damage was not so easily resolved. Steering control was not regained until 3:55 in the morning of 18 June. Of even greater concern to the ship's officers was that of her list, with her stern sinking lower than design specifications. Originally, they believed that the ship's outer skin had been penetrated, letting seawater in. Further investigation revealed that the cause for the list came from the ruptured fire main, which the damage control teams struggled to plug. Bogan, continuously frustrated by the progress of damage control, later complained in a 1969 interview that Fanshaw Bay was \\"the worst ship [he‚Äôd] ever seen in any Navy\\" and that \\"the entire complement was incompetent.\\" Regardless of opinions, Fanshaw Bay suffered 14 dead and 23 wounded from the attack. On 18 June, at 11:30 in the morning, her dead were buried at sea in a ceremony. Fanshaw Bay retired from operations and proceeded to Pearl Harbor for a long period of repairs. Nonetheless, limited flight operations continued, with a fighter pilot perishing in an accident on 29 June. =Battle of Morotai= Upon finishing her repairs, Fanshaw Bay continued acting as the flagship of Carrier Division 25, now under the command of Rear Admiral Clifton A. F. Sprague. After departing from Pearl Harbor, she arrived at Manus Island, of the Admiralty Islands. Fanshaw Bay, along with five other escort carriers and a screen of eight destroyer escorts, was assigned to Task Group 77.1, which would support the landings on Morotai. Notably, her aircraft contingent had been swapped, and she now hosted Composite Squadron 66 (VC-66). She departed Manus on 10 September, and she began air support operations on 15 September. On 17 September, two Avengers, one from Fanshaw Bay, collided while moving into formation on an antisubmarine patrol. Of the six men involved, only a single survivor was recovered by the submarine chaser . On 19 September, Fanshaw Bay lost another aircraft, with one of her Wildcats, diving on a Zero, missing and exploding on contact with the water. The carrier continued to hemorrhage aircraft, with an additional two fighters and a torpedo bomber crashing by 27 September. On 3 October, the majority of the escort carriers had already retired, leaving only Fanshaw Bay and to continue operations. Fanshaw Bay was preparing to retire back to Manus during the night. At the time, her task group was operating to the north of the island, when the Japanese submarine fired a spread of torpedoes towards the escort carriers. The first indicator of a torpedo attack occurred when a torpedo was spotted passing to the front of St. Lo, and off the port beam of Fanshaw Bay. Before maneuvers could be conducted, a second torpedo detonated on the destroyer escort , killing thirteen, and wounding twenty-two. The destroyer screen commenced dropping depth charges, forcing Ro-41 away. =Battle off Samar= Fanshaw Bay quietly retired back to Manus, where preparations began for the Philippines campaign. More specifically, Fanshaw Bay, as the flagship for \\"Taffy 3\\", would be providing aerial cover for the planned landings on the island of Leyte. After a brief period of replenishment at Manus from 7 to 12 October, Fanshaw Bay set off for the Philippines. En route, on 16 October, Fanshaw Bay lost yet another aircraft to an accident, with one of her fighters wrecking itself on the flight deck, before being caught by an arresting cable, which resulted in the aircraft precariously dangling over her port side. Her crew, and after a short while, the aircraft, were subsequently recovered. At the time of the invasion, Taffy 3 consisted of Fanshaw Bay, St. Lo, White Plains, , , and , along with an accompanying screen of three destroyers and four destroyer escorts. As the U.S. fleet gathered off the Philippines, the Japanese garrison on Suluan managed to alert their command. This prompted Admiral Soemu Toyoda to launch Sh≈ç-G≈ç 1, a gambit to defend Japan's access to the oil fields of Southeast Asia. On 18 and 19 October, Taffy 3 conducted strikes against Japanese bases located within Cebu, Negros, and Panay, destroying a total of thirty-eight planes, and damaging twenty-eight more. She then steamed off the island of Samar from 20 to 25 October, providing air support for U.S. forces onshore, and dropping leaflets on Japanese positions. In the meantime, Admiral William Halsey Jr. led his Third Fleet northwards, after spotting Vice Admiral Jisabur≈ç Ozawa's diversionary Northern Force. Thus, the only ships covering the vulnerable landing crafts of Leyte Gulf were the three escort carrier task groups and their screens. Taffy 3, the northmost task group, would bear the brunt of Vice Admiral Takeo Kurita's Center Force as it swung through the San Bernardino Strait. On the early morning of 25 October, Kurita's Center Force had already crossed the San Bernardino Strait unmolested, and was entering the open waters of the Leyte Gulf. White Plainss radar had possibly spotted the Japanese force maneuvering into position at 3:00, but this information was disregarded by the ship's command. Although World War II era surface radar was notoriously faulty, the speed and course of the spotted blip was consistent with the course set by the Center Force. Photographed from the escort carrier Kitkun Bay, Fanshaw Bay is shown surrounded by shell splashes from a Japanese battleship, likely the IJN or . In the foreground, three FM-2 Wildcat fighters are preparing for launching. At 4:30, the escort carriers went to general quarters in preparation for another round of airstrikes and close air support. By 5:30, Taffy 3 had launched twelve fighters to conduct a combat air patrol, before launching another two Wildcats and four Avengers shortly afterwards. The task group continued launching aircraft throughout the morning. By the time of the attack, Fanshaw Bay therefore only had twelve aircraft on hand, none of which were equipped to deal with heavily armed surface warships. The first indication of Japanese contact happened shortly after 6:30, when Taffy 3 experienced three almost simultaneous warnings. Firstly, they began receiving unencrypted Japanese chatter. Secondly, they spotted antiaircraft fire, estimated at to the north, where there was known to be no Allied surface presence. In fact, an Avenger from St. Lo had stumbled into the midst of the Japanese fleet, and began radioing Rear Admiral Sprague warnings. Thirdly, Fanshaw Bays radar operators spotted an unmistakable surface signature of unknown surface ships just away. Upon coming to an understanding of the severity of the situation, Sprague ordered Taffy 3 to steam eastward, in hopes of being shielded by a passing rain squall. At 6:52, Fanshaw Bay launched the remaining twelve of her planes, which consisted of a single Wildcat, and eleven Avengers. Of the Avengers, ten were carrying a single semi-armor piercing bombs, and one was carrying two depth charges. Sprague also radioed for assistance from Vice Admiral Jesse B. Oldendorf, the commander of Task Group 77.2, which had just defeated the Southern Force in the Battle of Surigao Strait. Unfortunately for Sprague, Oldendorf was at least three hours sail away, Task Group 77.2 was scattered over an immense distance because of the previous night's battle, and it was low on both fuel and ammunition. Taffy 3 would have to confront the Center Force by itself. Fanshaw Bay and White Plains were located on the west flank, and therefore bore the opening volleys of the engagement. Beginning at 6:58, both of the carriers came under fire from the Japanese task group, which was situated about away. The Japanese were firing dye-marked shells to gauge their aim, and the escort carriers were, much to the concern of their command, straddled in plumes of colored water. The officers would certainly be more concerned if they were able to correspond the color of the dyed water to that of a particular Japanese ship, as plumes of red, green, blue, purple, pink and yellow dyed water started to dot the ocean. Unbeknownst to the crew, the pink dyes corresponded to the Japanese battleship , with its guns, the largest ever manufactured, and the yellow dyes corresponded to the Japanese battleship , with its guns. Fortunately for Fanshaw Bays crew, as the shells slowly creeped up to her stern, she happened across a passing rain squall at 7:03, reducing visibility to just . At the same time that Fanshaw Bay was being harried by shells, the twelve aircraft that she had launched, joined by four fighters which had been on patrol, commenced attacks against the leading Japanese ships. Their attacks were mostly ineffective, mostly due to their light armaments and a general lack of coordination. The task group emerged from the rain squall by 7:23, but it was not until 7:50 that Fanshaw Bay came under concentrated fire again. At 7:50, four shells made impact with her hull, with another two missing just in front of her bow. One shell penetrated through a ventilator, killing two men as it tore into the carrier. Another shell passed under one of her Bofors guns, tearing the face off of one of her crew. Deflected by the gun's shield, the shell ricocheted over her flight deck. Another shell destroyed her catapult track, and resulted in a small explosion within her flag office. Four small fires had been kindled by these shells, but they were quickly put under control, along with a minor issue with flooding. Although four men had been killed in the attack, her operational capability was not significantly compromised. Rather, Fanshaw Bays gun responded by firing against one of the leading Japanese cruisers, landing at least five hits against its superstructure. Fanshaw Bay continued whilst under concentrated fire for the next hour, conducting a variety of evasive maneuvers. At 8:35, with the task force weaving back and forth, Fanshaw Bay had a close call with the destroyer , narrowly avoiding a collision. Despite the addition of smoke screens, and the heroic defense of her escorts, by 8:55, the Japanese had already closed the distance to only . During the intervening period, the Japanese shells had sparked a series of fires, which the damage control parties struggled to contain, and the situation seemed to be deteriorating. She was also forced to dodge torpedo attacks launched by the Japanese destroyer screen. Fortunately for her crew, Admiral Kurita, discouraged by the dogged defense of Taffy 3 and his losses, harried by constant air attacks, and believing that he was facing an equal or perhaps a superior force, was convinced to withdraw. At 9:25, to the bewilderment of Rear Admiral Sprague, the Japanese fleet turned around and retired. In the chaos of the action, Fanshaw Bay lost four Wildcats and an Avenger. In addition, Gambier Bay was severely damaged and sunk as a result of Japanese naval gunfire, with her survivors being left behind by the beleaguered task force. As Taffy 3 retired to the southeast following the engagement, five Japanese kamikaze Zeroes, along with four escorting fighters, were spotted at 10:51. The first kamikaze aimed for Kitkun Bay, but its aim was off, only clipping the carrier before detonating over the flight deck and plunging into the ocean. The second and third planes went for Fanshaw Bay. The first plane to approach was shot down by her gun, and it nosedived into the ocean. However, one of its bombs still exploded some from her hull, sending shrapnel across the carrier. As the other kamikaze maneuvered into a position to strike the ship, it was shot down a safe distance from the carrier by her anti- aircraft gunners. The fourth kamikaze proceeded towards White Plains, but only clipped the carrier, inflicting minor damage. The fifth kamikaze plunged towards, and sunk St. Lo with the loss of 113 lives. Even more kamikazes attempted to follow on the successful attack on St. Lo, but accurate anti- aircraft fire and an effective fighter screen ensured that the carriers sustained no more substantial damage. With her destroyer screen detached to recover the survivors of St. Lo, Fanshaw Bay retired towards Manus, recovering aircraft from the action throughout the day. At the end of the day, the carrier's crew had suffered four dead, and four wounded, with three having to be transferred to for treatment ashore. Arriving at Manus on 1 November, she replenished until 7 November, and proceeded back to the West Coast, making a stop at Pearl Harbor. She arrived at San Diego, where repairs were made for the damage sustained in the Battle off Samar. On 10 January 1945, Captain Murr Edward Arnold took over command of the vessel. In addition, a new aircraft contingent, Composite Spotting Squadron 2 (VOC-2), was embarked upon the carrier. Upon finishing repairs, she steamed for the waters off of Hawaii, where training operations were conducted, along with routine patrols. =Battle of Okinawa= Rear Admiral Sprague photographed on the bridge of Fanshaw Bay, as the Okinawa landings proceeded, circa April 1945. After finishing training, she sailed westwards to Ulithi, arriving on 14 March. There, she was designated as the flagship of Carrier Division 26, under the command of Rear Admiral Sprague. Preparations were made for the upcoming landings on Okinawa. On 21 March, she departed for Okinawa, and her aircraft began combat operations on 25 March. Her planes supported the initial landings on 1 April, providing extensive close air support, and neutralizing Japanese positions. On 7 April, Rear Admiral Ernest Wheeler Litch took over command of Carrier Division 26. Fanshaw Bay remained on station off of Okinawa for sixty- nine consecutive days, and her air contingent flew 2,089 sorties in the battle, claiming five Japanese planes. Throughout the operation, she witnessed near constant kamikaze attacks, with some 1,465 Japanese kamikazes involved. Following a short period of replenishment at San Pedro Bay, Fanshaw Bay again returned to Okinawa, arriving off of the Sakishima Islands on 9 June to continue launching airstrikes. She continued these operations until 27 June, when she was assigned to Task Force 39, commanded by Rear Admiral Alexander Sharp. Consisting of 107 minesweepers, seven minelayers, and seven netlayers, the Task Force began minesweeping operations within the East China Sea, beginning on 5 July. Fanshaw Bay, along with three other escort carriers, provided an aerial screen for the minesweepers, and launched strikes against targets situated around the mouth of the Yangtze River on 28 July. On 30 July, she withdrew from the operations, having assisted the minesweepers in clearing 404 mines over , with no loss in ships, despite the occasional Japanese submarine or plane. Fanshaw Bay anchored within Nakagusuku Bay, where she endured further kamikaze and submarine incursions. She then steamed for Guam and Eniwetok, where she loaded aircraft. She was assigned to Vice Admiral Frank Jack Fletcher's Ninth Fleet, which was operating off of the Aleutian Islands. As she departed from Eniwetok, she received news of the Japanese surrender on August 15. =Post-war= Nonetheless, Fanshaw Bay proceeded northwards, mooring at Kuluk Bay, Adak Island. There, she joined Task Force 44, and sailed southwards to assist in the Japanese occupation. She operated off of Japan between 31 August and 9 September, covering troops as they landed on Hokkaido. After the formal signing of surrender by the Japanese garrison on Hokkaido on 9 September, she returned to Pearl Harbor, arriving on 24 September. At Pearl Harbor, she joined the \\"Magic Carpet\\" fleet, which repatriated U.S. servicemen from throughout the Pacific. She cruised around the Pacific, making stops and returning U.S. servicemen back to the mainland, sailing a total of along the way, and with an average of 1,400 passengers on- board during each journey. She first steamed for San Francisco, arriving on 20 October, took on passengers at Pearl Harbor on 27 October, and returned her passengers to San Diego on 4 November. She then made a trip to Japan, arriving at Tokyo Bay on 28 November, returning to the West Coast on 18 December, where she was discharged from the \\"Magic Carpet\\" fleet. Following release, Fanshaw Bay sailed northwards, arriving at Port Angeles, Washington, on 26 January 1946. Inactivation work began at Tacoma on 29 January, and she was decommissioned on 14 August. She was mothballed as part of the Pacific Reserve Fleet, and she was redesignated as a helicopter escort carrier whilst in reserve on 12 June 1955. She was struck from the Navy list on 1 March 1959, and sold for scrapping on 29 August to Hyman-Michaels Co., Chicago. She was ultimately broken up in Portland, Oregon, later that year. Fanshaw Bay received five battle stars for World War II service, and along with the rest of Taffy 3, received the Presidential Unit Citation for conduct during the Battle off Samar.

Sponsored by Mrs. Victor Sundrik, she was reclassified again to CVE-75 on 15 July 1943, and was commissioned at Astoria, Oregon, on 11 January 1944, with Captain W. V. Saunders in command. Service history After intensive training off the California coast, Hoggatt Bay transported aircraft and crews to Pearl Harbor from 10‚Äì25 March 1944. Upon her return and further training in antisubmarine work, she sailed on 1 May for Pearl Harbor and Majuro. The combination of escort carriers and destroyers had proven itself effective against submarines in the Battle of the Atlantic, and was now to be used in the Pacific against the Japanese. Hoggatt Bay and a group of destroyers and destroyer escorts patrolled in the southwest Pacific from 26 May-19 June with notable success. scored a kill on Ro-105 on 31 May and sank Ro-111 with depth charges and gunfire 11 June. These operations and those of other groups did much to reduce Japanese submarine interference with the invasion of the Marianas. Returning to the patrol area after a brief stay at Eniwetok, Hoggatt Bay's group provided air support and cover for the Marianas operation from 5 July‚Äì9 August, after which the ships returned to Manus Island. Next on the timetable of Pacific conquest was Peleliu, a valuable air base for further advances, and Hoggatt Bay sortied 1 September to furnish antisubmarine protection and search planes for the invasion. For nearly two months the escort carrier cruised these seas south and west of the Marianas in support of American operations. , a member of her group, sank on 3 October, and later in the month planes from Hoggatt Bay helped provide air cover for as she struggled toward Ulithi. The ship arrived at Ulithi on 28 October, and sailed on 10 November to provide air support for the developing campaign in the Philippines. This was followed by amphibious exercises in Huon Gulf, New Guinea, in preparation for the Lingayen unit operations. Arriving at Manus on 20 December 1944, Hoggatt Bay joined the great task force which departed from that and other staging bases in late December for Lingayen Gulf. The voyage through the Philippines was a perilous one, as the Japanese attacked with their last desperate weapon, the suicide plane. Crewmen on Hoggatt Bay and the other ships fought continuously after 3 January, downing many of the attackers, but was lost and other ships damaged. Arriving Lingayen Gulf on 6 January, Hoggatt Bay sent her carrier planes in to support the landings and destroy strong points despite suicide attacks; this vital work continued until 17 January, when the ship set course for Ulithi, and then San Diego. Temporary repairs at Ulithi and more extensively at San Diego were necessitated by an accidental explosion of bombs as aircraft landed onboard on 15 January off Luzon, Philippine Islands. The veteran escort carrier returned to San Diego 15 February 1945, and after much-needed repairs sailed 6 April to join the vast fleet arrayed off Okinawa in support of the invasion. She arrived Okinawa 8 May via Pearl Harbor and Ulithi and immediately took station south of the island to lend her aircraft to the carrier air forces engaged in the operation. Her planes flew direct support missions, photographic flights, and supply drops during the period from 8 May-24 June. Hoggatt Bay arrived at Leyte Gulf on 27 June, and after a month of training sailed on 28 July for Adak, Alaska. The surrender came while the carrier was en route, however, and the planned operation was replaced by occupation plans. After her arrival on 18 August, Hoggatt Bay sailed for Ominato. She arrived September and supported the occupation of Hokkaid≈ç and northern Honsh≈´. During this period aircraft from the ship discovered many Japanese prison camps, and the ship had the pleasure of evacuating Lieutenant Colonel James Devereux, Marine Commander at Wake Island when captured by the Japanese. Hoggatt Bay also participated in the occupation of Aomori before anchoring in Tokyo Bay on 27 September. The escort carrier departed Tokyo on 30 September and, after a brief service with the \\"Magic Carpet\\" fleet, returned to Boston and was decommissioned on 20 July 1946. Placed in the Atlantic Reserve Fleet, Boston, the ship was re-classified CVHE-75 on 12 June 1955, and AKV-25 on 7 May 1959. She was sold for scrap on 31 March 1960.

Tripoli is the first US Navy ship named for the Battle of Derne in 1805. It was the decisive victory of a mercenary army led by a detachment of United States Marines and soldiers against the forces of Tripoli during the First Barbary War. It was the first recorded land battle of the United States fought overseas.http://www.history.navy.mil/research/histories/ship- histories/danfs/t/tripoli-i.html Construction She was built under a Maritime Commission (MARCOM) contract (MC hull 1101) at Vancouver, Washington, and was laid down by the Kaiser Shipyards on 1 February 1943, as Didrickson Bay (ACV-64). Renamed Tripoli on 3 April 1943, and launched on 13 July 1943, sponsored by Mrs. Leland D. Webb, and commissioned on 31 October 1943, at Astoria, Oregon, Captain Wendell G. Switzer in command. Service history =World War II= Following shakedown training off the California coast, the escort carrier entered the repair base at San Diego, California. There, on 4 January 1944, gasoline was inadvertently dumped into the water around the forward part of the ship, on the starboard side. Acetylene torch sparks ignited the volatile mixture, and flames quickly spread from the bow to frame 82, engulfing the forward galley walkway and the island superstructure. Yardcraft and the ship's crew battled the flames and soon had the fire under control, but not before two men had died. Atlantic Subsequently repaired, Tripoli departed San Diego on 31 January, bound for the Panama Canal and duty with the Atlantic Fleet. She arrived at her new home port, Norfolk, Virginia on 16 February. Embarking Composite Squadron 13 (VC-13) - 13 Grumman FM-2 Wildcats and Grumman TBM Avengers - the carrier put to sea on 15 March as the center ship in Task Group 21.15 (TG 21.15). Supported by five destroyer escorts of Escort Division 7 (CortDiv 7), Tripoli patrolled west of the Cape Verde Islands to break up German U-boat refuelling activities in that area. After providing air cover for a convoy routed to the British West Indies, Tripolis Wildcats and Avengers searched the sea lanes northwest, southwest, and west of the Cape Verdes before putting into Recife, Brazil on 5 April, to refuel and provision. Back at sea again two days later, Tripoli continued the routine of daily launchings and recoveries of her aircraft, guarding the Allied sea lanes against the incursions of enemy U-boats. About one hour before sunrise on 19 April, one of Tripolis Avengers made radar contact with a German U-boat as the submarine cruised on the surface awaiting the arrival of her \\"Milch Cow\\" or refuelling partner. put up a spirited anti-aircraft barrage while the Avenger made three attacks. A pattern of rockets bracketed the submarine on the first pass as the Germans prepared to dive for comparative safety. On the second run, the aircraft's depth charges failed to release, giving the enemy submersible the time she needed to dive. The U-boat evaded the aircraft's last attack - a mine - but also missed her fuelling rendezvous with . Returning to Norfolk on 29 April, Tripoli underwent voyage repairs before embarking VC-6 - 12 Avengers and nine Wildcats. She then formed up with CortDiv 7 and departed Hampton Roads on 24 May for further searches in the vicinity of the Cape Verdes. Four days out, she changed course to intercept a German submarine estimated to be proceeding southwest from a position west of the Madeira Islands. When no contact was made by 30 May, Tripoli and her consorts steamed north to rendezvous with a convoy bound for Nova Scotia. Following her return to Norfolk on 18 June, Tripoli spent two months in carrier qualification training off Quonset Point, Rhode Island, before making port again at Norfolk on 15 July. Embarking Composite Squadron 6, she conducted two weeks of pilot qualifications in the Chesapeake Bay area before departing Hampton Roads on 1 August, bound for her new base of operations, Recife. Screened by and , the escort carrier proceeded south until 1 August, when O'Toole developed a sonar contact and gave chase. Aircraft from Tripoli laid patterns of sonobuoys at the initial contact point and dropped smoke floats and float lights on an oil slick. Picking up the \\"scent\\", O'Toole straddled the floats with her Hedgehog projectiles and depth charges and soon radioed victoriously \\"We hit the rodent!\\" A brief visual examination of the evidence - debris and a large quantity of diesel oil - satisfied the hunter- killer group that they had indeed sunk an enemy submarine. However, a post-war examination of German records did not confirm the kill. As night fell, Tripoli vectored two aircraft to another sonar contact by O'Toole, and four depth bombs were dropped - keeping another U-boat down and running. Tripoli and her group then returned to Recife on 13 August, and reported for duty with Admiral Jonas H. Ingram's 4th Fleet. Designated as the center of TG 47.7, the escort carrier put to sea on 22 August with the four destroyer escorts of CortDiv 24 to operate against a homeward-bound German submarine estimated to pass at 25¬∞ south latitude and 5¬∞ west longitude. After a fruitless search pursuing two fading sonar contacts in the mid-South Atlantic narrows, Tripoli and her group returned to Recife on 11 September for provisioning and fuelling. Underway again two days later, TG 47.7 headed out to conduct another search - this time along the estimated track of two U-boats slated to rendezvous for refuelling. One of the target U-boats was , bound from Penang, British Malaya with a cargo of valuable petroleum products for the German war effort. Ordered to fuel, outward-bound for the Far East, U-1062 prepared to rendezvous with her smaller sister boat in the South Atlantic narrows - directly in the path of the Tripoli escort group. Passing to the westward of the Cape Verdes, TG 47.7 made rendezvous with s escort group to conduct a joint hunter-killer operation against the two enemy boats. Round-the-clock searches by radar-equipped Avengers continued until 40 minutes after sunset on 28 September, when an Avenger piloted by Lieutenant William R. Gillespie reported a definite contact with the surfaced U-219 only 11 miles from the enemy's estimated track. Gillespie went in to conduct a low-level rocket attack, but was shot down by heavy flak. Another Avenger, drawn to the battle, braved the flak to conduct another rocket run and also dropped depth bombs, while a Wildcat strafed the U-boat which struggled desperately to dodge the harassing attacks by the American aircraft. U-219 emerged from the firefight unscathed, but U-1062 did not enjoy similar good fortune. , one of Mission Bays screen, homed in on sonobuoy indications on 30 September and sank the \\"Milch Cow\\" with a four- charge pattern. In the meantime, U-219 was not yet home free - one of Tripolis Avengers dropped depth bombs on the fleeing boat on 2 October. American sonar- men felt that they had definitely \\"killed\\" the U-boat, but post-war accounting showed that U-219 had escaped to Batavia, Java. When fuel supplies ran low, Tripoli returned to Recife on 12 October. She conducted one further search of the narrows from 26 October-12 November before heading for a much-needed overhaul at Norfolk. Subsequently, the escort carrier sailed for the Pacific and, after transiting the Panama Canal and touching at San Diego, arrived at Pearl Harbor on 10 January 1945. Pacific Tripoli transferred Composite Squadron 8 ashore to conduct operations from Hilo, Hawaii, before she loaded a miscellaneous cargo of fighters and bombers to be offloaded at Roi, in the Marshall Islands, where she made port on 20 February 1945. Returning to Pearl Harbor after this ferry run, the escort carrier commenced training operations which would continue through the end of the war, and into late 1945. With Japan's surrender and the end of hostilities in the Pacific, Tripoli was assigned to Operation Magic Carpet. Arriving at San Diego on 29 August, with 500 Navy veterans, Tripoli returned to Pearl Harbor on 8 September, before resuming local operations - including night carrier qualifications - through November. She subsequently made one trip with Army passengers to San Pedro, California, and a further \\"Magic Carpet\\" run to San Diego. The carrier departed the west coast on 15 January 1946, for deactivation overhaul at Norfolk. On 22 May 1946, the need for her services not required, Tripoli was decommissioned and laid up in reserve. =Korean War= The outbreak of the Korean War in the summer of 1950 resulted in the return of many of the Navy's reserve ships to active service to support American operations in the Far East. Accordingly, Tripoli was recommissioned at New York on 5 January 1952, Captain Raymond N. Sharp in command. Assigned to the Military Sealift Command (MSC), Atlantic Area, the former \\"hunter-killer\\" began her new career as an aircraft transport and ferry. Tripoli transporting F-84 Thunderjets in the 1950s. Over the next six years, Tripoli conducted 44 transport voyages, mostly to European and Mediterranean ports, but with one visit to Hawaii and two to the Far East. Following the ship's third voyage to Europe, Tripoli was berthed at the Port Newark Terminal on 5 August 1952, where she loaded 45 F-84 Thunderjets, 90 wingtip fuel tanks, and related gear for transport to the Far East. After going to sea on 7 August, bound for Japan, Tripoli steamed via the Panama Canal and San Diego and made port at Yokosuka with her vital cargo on 5 September, where cranes lifted the reinforcements ashore - soon to be in action in their ground-attack role in Korea. After loading battle-damaged aircraft for repairs in the United States, the carrier embarked 245 Navy and Marine Corps personnel for rotation back to Alameda Naval Air Station, California. Making port on the West Coast on 22 September, she then put to sea for the Far East a second time, once again carrying jet aircraft to Yokosuka, as well as transporting men of the Sea Echelon of Boat Unit 1. Loading a cargo of helicopters and military passengers, Tripoli returned to the west coast and arrived at Alameda on 11 November 1952. Subsequently making her sole Hawaiian voyage with the MSC, Tripoli then headed east to finish her career with transport voyages to European and Mediterranean ports. At Alameda May 1954, fifty F-86D aircraft were loaded on board Tripoli and cocooned for a 21-day trip thru the Panama Canal to St Nazaire, France. June 13 approx 500 US Air Force personnel of the 440th FIS from Spokane WA and 441st FIS from Hamilton AFB in San Francisco, CA boarded the ship. One source identifies the units as the 496th Fighter Squadron from Hamilton AFB, and the 440th from Geiger Air Force Base.United Press, \\"Interceptor Fighters On Way To Europe\\", San Bernardino Sun-Telegram, San Bernardino, California, Sunday 6 June 1954, Volume VIII, Number 9, page 2. On July 2 the ship arrived at the port of St Nazaire, France. The two squadrons were bound for Landstuhl AFB, Germany. Receiving \\"smart ship\\" awards from in the intervening years, Tripoli was reclassified a utility carrier and redesignated CVU-64 on 12 June 1955. Again redesignated T-CVU-64 on 1 July 1958, Tripoli was decommissioned at New Orleans, La., on 25 November 1958 and subsequently struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 1 February 1959. Her hull then scrapped by a Japanese firm in January 1960.

Joseph Campbell Cronin in command. Service history The new escort carrier got underway from Seattle on 17 January 1944 bound for San Francisco where she was immediately pressed into service ferrying stores, airplanes, and military personnel to Hawaii. She departed Pearl Harbor for the homeward voyage on 29 January and arrived at San Diego with her load of passengers on 4 February. Throughout most of February, she participated in training exercises out of San Diego before steaming, via the Canal Zone, for Hampton Roads, Virginia. Following her arrival at Norfolk on 17 March, Tulagi underwent overhaul and carrier qualification tests. Tulagi embarked a load of Army Air Forces planes late in May and departed New York on the 28th in convoy with two other carriers and their screen. On 6 June, Tulagi entered her first foreign port as she steamed the swept channel approach to Casablanca. After disembarking her cargo, the carrier took on passengers including a group of 35 prisoners of war and then headed home. After arriving at Norfolk on 17 June 1944, Tulagi got underway late in June for Quonset Point, Rhode Island, where she embarked personnel, planes, and equipment. On the last day of the month, she departed Narragansett Bay with Rear Admiral Calvin T. Durgin on board as Commander, Task Group 27.7, and steamed eastward conducting squadron and battery training en route to Oran, Algeria. Tulagi visited Malta on 26 July and then spent the following weeks conducting exercises, which included a dress rehearsal out of African and Italian ports for the coming Operation Dragoon, the invasion of southern France. On D-Day, Tulagi steamed in formation 45 miles off the invasion beach; and, at 0546, she launched her first flight of F6F Hellcats. In the next week, aircraft from Tulagi flew a total of 68 missions and 276 sorties, inflicting considerable damage on the enemy. Weather was generally good as carrier-based planes conducted spotting missions and made strikes at various targets ashore, including gun emplacements and railway facilities. On 21 August, Tulagi's last day in support of Operation \\"Dragoon\\", German forces were in retreat before the Allied thrust. Tulagi's fliers conducted a devastating attack along the line of march of a German convoy which snarled the roads for miles around Remoulins and crowned her achievements of the day by downing three German Junkers Ju 52s. After taking on supplies and fuel at Oran, she got underway for home on 6 September. Following a quick overhaul at Norfolk, the escort carrier set her course for Panama; transited the Canal; and arrived at San Diego on 26 October. There, she embarked two air squadrons for transportation to Hawaii and departed the west coast on 29 October 1944. Following her arrival at Pearl Harbor on 5 November, the carrier participated in antisubmarine warfare and gunnery exercises. On the 24th, she got underway in company with a special antisubmarine task group which conducted sweeps as it steamed via the Marshalls and Ulithi for Saipan. Throughout December, Tulagi continued antisubmarine activities in the Palaus and the southern Marianas. On the first day of the new year, 1945, Tulagi got underway for Lingayen Gulf and the impending invasion of Luzon. Meanwhile, the Japanese in the Philippines had assigned more than 100 suicide planes for a concerted attack on Tulagi's task force. The convoy passed through Surigao Strait into the Mindanao Sea on 3 January. In the following three days, the kamikazes took their toll. On the 4th, reports of enemy aircraft in the area became more frequent; and, late in the afternoon, a suicide plane crashed while trying to dive into . Moments later, observers on Tulagi saw the conflagration which marked the death throes of , the victim of another kamikaze. On the morning of 5 January, enemy air attackers continued to menace the convoy as it steamed through Mindoro Strait and into the South China Sea. Although fighters from the carrier shot down two Mitsubishi A6M Zeros, three enemy aircraft succeeded in penetrating the defenses of the convoy. Two were shot down, but one managed to crash into , a member of the convoy's screen. When landing began at Lingayen Gulf on 9 January 1945, Tulagi launched her planes for air strikes on land targets, anti-snooper patrols, and air cover for American vessels. On 12 January, Tulagi supplied air support for the Lingayen Gulf beachhead; and, the next day, her port battery shot down a suicide plane which had singled out the carrier for destruction. Before it crashed, the attacker, deflected from Tulagi by withering anti-aircraft fire, crossed astern and to starboard of the escort carrier and vainly attempted to dive into an alternate target. On 17 January, the Army Air Force assumed responsibility for direct air support of American operations in Lingayen Gulf; and Tulagi's fliers turned their attention toward the Zambales coast where they provided cover for support and protection of forces near San Narcisco. On 5 February, Tulagi arrived at Ulithi after a grueling period of sustained flight operations during which her planes had been in the air for all but two of 32 days. Tulagi departed Guam on 21 February to conduct hunter-killer exercises in support of the assault on Iwo Jima before joining a task unit in \\"area Varnish\\" west of Iwo Jima on 1 March. She supplied air support and antisubmarine patrols until departing the area on 11 March, bound for Ulithi. Arriving there on 14 March, she prepared for the invasion of the Ryukyus. Assigned alternately to antisubmarine and direct support activities, Tulagi operated continuously off the coast of Okinawa from the end of March until early June. On 3 April, four Zeros attacked her formation, and all were shot down. On the 6th, while Tulagi was anchored at Kerama Retto for rearming, a Japanese air attack penetrated air space over the harbor. The carrier took one of her attackers under fire at 4,000 yards, but the Japanese plane came harrowingly close before turning aside to dive into a nearby LST which burst into flames 200 feet high. Minutes later, Tulagi shot down another attacker and chased off a third with her accurate fire. The next day, Tulagi resumed her station off Okinawa, providing planes for air strikes called in by ground observers and for running photo- reconnaissance and patrol missions. On the 13th, after she launched a special strike against the airfields of Miyako Jima, she began antisubmarine operations along the shipping lanes approaching Okinawa. Following this long and arduous tour, Tulagi arrived at Guam on 6 June 1945. The carrier departed the Marianas on the 8th, bound for San Diego. She remained on the west coast throughout the summer undergoing overhaul, trials, and training. Peace came while she was at San Diego, but she departed the west coast again on 4 September and steamed via Hawaii for the Philippines. At Samar, she embarked planes for transportation back to the United States and reached Pearl Harbor in October. After returning to San Diego in January 1946, the veteran escort carrier reported to the 19th Fleet at Port Angeles, Washington, on 2 February 1946 for inactivation. She was decommissioned on 30 April 1946 and struck from the Navy List on 8 May 1946. Awards Tulagi received four battle stars for World War II service.

She was named after Rudyerd Bay, within Ketcchikan Gateway Bourough, of the Territory of Alaska. Today, the bay lies within Misty Fjords National Monument. The ship was launched in January 1944, commissioned in February, and served as a replenishment and transport carrier throughout the Mariana and Palau Islands campaign and the Philippines campaign. Later, she served as a frontline carrier, providing air cover and support for the invasion of Iwo Jima, and the Battle of Okinawa. Postwar, she participated in Operation Magic Carpet, repatriating U.S. servicemen from throughout the Pacific. She was decommissioned in June 1946, when she was mothballed in the Atlantic Reserve Fleet. Ultimately, she was sold for scrapping in January 1960. Design and description A profile of the design of , which was shared with all Casablanca-class escort carriers. Rudyerd Bay was a Casablanca-class escort carrier, the most numerous type of aircraft carriers ever built, and designed specifically to be mass-produced using prefabricated sections, in order to replace heavy early war losses. Standardized with her sister ships, she was long overall, at the waterline, she was long, she had a beam of , at her widest point, this was , and a draft of . She displaced standard, with a full load. She had a long hangar deck and a long flight deck. She was powered with two Skinner Unaflow reciprocating steam engines, which drove two shafts, providing , thus enabling her to make . The ship had a cruising range of at a speed of . Power was provided by four Babcock & Wilcox water-tube boilers. Her compact size necessitated the installation of an aircraft catapult at her bow, and there were two aircraft elevators to facilitate movement of aircraft between the flight and hangar deck: one each fore and aft. One /38 caliber dual-purpose gun was mounted on the stern. Anti-aircraft defense was provided by eight Bofors anti-aircraft guns in single mounts, as well as 12 Oerlikon cannons, which were mounted around the perimeter of the deck. By the end of the war, Casablanca-class carriers had been modified to carry thirty 20 mm cannons, and the amount of 40 mm guns had been doubled to sixteen, by putting them into twin mounts. These modifications were in response to increasing casualties due to kamikaze attacks. Although Casablanca-class escort carriers were designed to function with a crew of 860 and an embarked squadron of 50 to 56, the exigencies of wartime often necessitated the inflation of the crew count. Casablanca-class escort carriers were designed to carry 27 aircraft, but the hangar deck could accommodate more. During the Invasion of Iwo Jima, she carried 15 FM-2 fighters, 11 TBM-1C torpedo bombers, and a TBM-1CP reconnaissance plane for a total of 27 aircraft. During the Battle of Okinawa, she carried 17 FM-2 fighters and 12 TBM-3 torpedo bombers, for a total of 29 aircraft. Construction Her construction was awarded to Kaiser Shipbuilding Company, Vancouver, Washington under a Maritime Commission contract, on 18 June 1942. The escort carrier was laid down on 24 October 1943 under the name Kaita Bay, as part of a tradition which named escort carriers after bays or sounds in Alaska. She was laid down as MC hull 1118, the twenty-seventh of a series of fifty Casablanca-class escort carriers. She was launched on 12 January 1944; sponsored by the wife of Captain Scott Ernest Peck; transferred to the United States Navy and commissioned on 25 February 1944, with Captain Curtis Stanton Smiley in command. Service history The fleet oiler (foreground) and Rudyerd Bay (background) photographed steaming together in April 1944, before Rudyerd Bay had received its camouflage. Upon being commissioned, Rudyerd Bay underwent a shakedown cruise down the West Coast to Southern California, where she took on a load of aircraft, which she ferried to Espiritu Santo of the New Hebrides throughout April and May. Upon returning to the West Coast, the carrier conducted qualification exercises off the California coast until July, before making another transport run to Majuro, in the Marshall Islands from 20 July to 26 July, escorted by the destroyer escort . After finishing her mission, she embarked Composite Squadron 77 (VC-77), departing on 8 August for the West Pacific. At Enewetak Atoll in the Marshall Islands, she joined Task Group 30.8, the Fleet Oiler and Transport Carrier Group, which at the time, consisted of seven escort carriers (including Rudyerd Bay), seven destroyers, fifteen destroyer escorts, and twenty-four replenishment oilers, organized into eight task units. She then proceeded with the task group to Manus Island, in the Admiralty Islands, arriving on 31 August. Throughout early September, Rudyerd Bay served as a replenishment carrier, providing replacement aircraft (from VC-77), parts, and supplies for the frontline Fast Carrier Task Force of the Third Fleet, which at the time was supporting the Mariana and Palau Islands campaign. Later, during October, she continued supporting the fast carriers as they operated in support of the Philippines campaign. Rudyerd Bay was still a part of Task Group 30.8, now renamed the At Sea Logistics Group. The fleet oilers had been detached, and the number of escort carriers involved had increased to eleven. On 18 October, the carrier took on the wounded of the light cruiser , which had been subjected to two separate aerial torpedo hits. She transported them to Ulithi in the Caroline Islands, and by November, the carrier was back to replenishment duties, which would eventually take her into Typhoon Cobra. On 17 December 1944, Rudyerd Bay was a part of Task Unit 30.8.12, alongside her sister , which was acting as the flagship. The two escort carriers were screened by the destroyer escorts and . By then, the Third Fleet had been operating against positions on Luzon since 14 December, but its escorting destroyers ran low on fuel. As a result, the fleet retired to the east to refuel, and to receive replacement aircraft from Task Group 30.8. Rudyerd Bay rendezvoused with the Third Fleet about east of Luzon early on 17 December. The location had been chosen because it lay out of range of Japanese fighters, but it also happened to lie within Typhoon Alley, where many Pacific tropical cyclones transited. As the escort carriers and the Third Fleet met, Typhoon Cobra began to bear down. At 01:00, fueling operations were attempted with the destroyers, although heavy winds and listing seas complicated the matter. At the same time, barometers on-board the ships began to drop, and tropical storm force winds were recorded. A radar image of Typhoon Cobra, 18 December 1944. As the weather continued to deteriorate, Admiral William Halsey Jr. ordered fueling operations suspended at 13:10. He ordered his fleet to move to the next morning's planned rendezvous spot, approximately northwest, and comfortably safe from the typhoon's impacts. Two hours later, he instead ordered his fleet to proceed due southwards, from where the fleet was located. This brought the fleet directly into the typhoon's core. To make matters worse for the Third Fleet, Halsey ordered the fleet to proceed northwards at 22:20, putting the fleet in the quadrant of the typhoon with the highest winds. Blurry data and observations meant that command had little idea of where the typhoon actually was, with some weather maps pinning the typhoon's center some away, even whilst the fleet sailed directly into the eye. Attached to the Third Fleet, Rudyerd Bay followed. At 07:00, on the morning of 18 December, the fleet was inescapably trapped in the typhoon's path. Conflicting orders meant that some of the destroyers attempted to do some fueling during the morning, even as waves with an estimated height of pounded the task force. At 07:22, Rudyerd Bay came to course at 60¬∞, along with her sisters and Nehenta Bay. Rudyerd Bay struggled to maintain its course as it battled with high winds and waves cresting over the flight deck. At 10:17, Rudyerd Bay radioed that she was dead in the water, albeit control was quickly regained. Nonetheless, all appearances suggest that Rudyerd Bay passed through Typhoon Cobra relatively intact and without much damage, given the fact that on 19 December, Halsey found it judicious to assign upon her and her sister , the task of combing through the area looking for survivors. On 20 December, at 05:00, the carrier was the first to report to Halsey that the destroyer had capsized, with the loss of most of its crew. At 08:40, Rudyerd Bay, along with her screens, relieved the destroyer escort , which had been conducting search and rescue operations for fifty straight hours. Upon concluding rescue operations, Rudyerd Bay steamed back to Ulithi, where the destroyer escorts unloaded the survivors of the Spence. On 28 December, the escort carrier, accompanied by Nehenta Bay, several oilers, and various other ships, departed Ulithi, voyaging westwards to continue their replenishment role in support of the Philippines campaign. The carrier was situated in the Philippine Sea, until 10 January 1945, when she moved north to the South China Sea, in order to better support the fast carriers as they participated in the invasion of Lingayen Gulf and conducted strikes against Japanese shipping stretching from Indochina to Formosa. On 22 January, Rudyerd Bay left replenishment duty, transiting via the Sulu Sea, Mindanao Sea, and Leyte Gulf, before docking at Ulithi. Rudyerd Bay remained at Ulithi until 10 February, when she left for Saipan, in the Mariana Islands, in preparation for the invasion of Iwo Jima. During this time period, Captain John Golden Foster Jr. took over command of the carrier. On 16 February, she left the Mariana Islands, as a part of Task Group 51.17, along with . The two carriers were responsible for providing air cover and escorting the troop transports as they ferried marines to the shores of Iwo Jima. Finishing this duty without incident on 18 February, the two carriers joined Task Group 52.2, the Support Carrier Group, as a part of Task Unit 52.2.3, which was under the command of Rear Admiral George R. Henderson. Rudyerd Bays aircraft contingent, VC-77, began flying missions in support of the marines on 19 February, as U.S. forces began touching down on the island's beaches. These missions were expected to include reconnaissance missions, flown by VC-77's sole TBM-1CP reconnaissance plane. However, after the plane had just taken off on its first mission, at 09:14, a scanty twelve minutes after the first U.S. forces had touched down on the island, the Avenger had a large Japanese shell tear into it, turning the plane into a fireball and killing VC-77's commanding officer. Nonetheless, VC-77 continued providing close air support and conducting antisubmarine patrols around Iwo Jima until 8 March, when Rudyerd Bay retired for Ulithi. In an overhead shot of Rudyerd Bay on 20 May 1945, numerous aircraft of Composite Squadron 96 (VC-96), a couple of the carrier's crew, and a crane are visible. Whilst Rudyerd Bay was stationed at Ulithi from 11 March to 20 March, her aircraft contingent was exchanged, with Composite Squadron 96 (VC-96) being embarked in preparation for the Battle of Okinawa. On 21 March, the carrier got underway, as a part of Task Unit 52.1.2, which was under the command of Rear Admiral Felix Stump. She arrived at her position on 25 March, about to the south of Okinawa, where she began launching strikes against enemy positions on Kerama Retto and on Okinawa itself. Rudyerd Bays aircraft contingent, with the exceptions of 1 April and 8 April, operated daily until 17 April. From 13 to 15 April, VC-96 concentrated on the Sakishima Islands, where a squadron of Japanese kamikaze aircraft were being launched. Throughout these operations, Rudyerd Bay witnessed a steady stream of both kamikazes and conventional Japanese aircraft make attacks on the escort carriers. For example, on the late afternoon of 2 April, Rudyerd Bays fighters were scrambled when two kamikazes attacked her sister , with an extreme near-miss tearing a large hole in the starboard side of the carrier. As the sun set, one of VC-96's fighters shot down a Mitsubishi A6M Zero, and as the Japanese planes disengaged, eight of her fighters were forced to make night landings, even though none of the pilots had been night-qualified. In the ensuing mayhem, two Wildcat fighters and an Avenger on the flight deck were rendered as complete losses, with four more planes being severely damaged, albeit remarkably, none of the pilots were killed or seriously injured. On 17 April, Rudyerd Bay was rotated to Task Group 50.8, the Logistics Support Group, for a 10-day period of relative rest, although her aircraft were still responsible for providing an air screen for the replenishment carriers. She was rotated back to Task Group 52.1 on 27 April, whereupon she continued providing close air support. She was rotated again to Task Group 50.8 on 8 May, providing air cover until 20 May, when she retired from the Ryukyu Islands. By then, VC-96 had flown 1,257 sorties in support of the battle on Okinawa. Proceeding eastwards, Rudyerd Bay arrived on Guam on 23 May, where she detached her aircraft contingent, VC-96, and embarked Composite Squadron 85 (VC-85) for transport back to the West Coast. Upon arriving back in the United States, she underwent overhaul, which took until the end of July. Upon the completion of overhaul, she was reassigned to plane ferry duty, which began on 1 August, when she ferried a load of aircraft from Naval Air Station Alameda to the Marshall Islands. Whilst she was still midway in her ferry mission, the Japanese surrender was announced. Nonetheless, Rudyerd Bay continued onwards, unloading cargo and passengers at Enewetak, before heading to Ulithi and the Philippines, and moving Composite Squadron (VC-33) to Okinawa. She then took on another aircraft squadron, which she transported back to the West Coast, arriving at San Francisco on 8 October. There, Rudyerd Bay underwent repairs and modifications in order to better accommodate troops, before being assigned to the \\"Magic Carpet\\" fleet, which repatriated servicemen from throughout the Pacific. She made Magic Carpet runs for the rest of 1945, into the new year, finishing her final trans-Pacific run on 23 January 1946. On 18 February, she left dock at California, bound for the Eastern seaboard. She transited through the Panama Canal on 28 February, unloaded some aircraft at Jacksonville, Florida in early March, and steamed north to Boston, where inactivation work was commenced. Rudyerd Bay was decommissioned on 11 June, and mothballed in the Atlantic Reserve Fleet, as part of its Boston group. Docked at the South Boston Naval Annex, she was reclassified as a utility carrier (CVU-81) on 12 June 1955. She was then further reclassified as an aviation transport (AKV-29) on 7 May 1959. She was struck from the Navy list on 1 August 1959, and sometime in January 1960, she was sold to Cantieri Navali Santa Maria, which broke her up in Genoa, Italy throughout 1960. Rudyerd Bay' received five battle stars for her World War II service.

It honors engineering students in American universities who have shown a history of academic achievement as well as a commitment to personal and professional integrity. Specifically, the association was founded \\"to mark in a fitting manner those who have conferred honor upon their Alma Mater by distinguished scholarship and exemplary character as students in engineering, or by their attainments as alumni in the field of engineering, and to foster a spirit of liberal culture in engineering colleges\\". History When academic honor society Phi Beta Kappa sought to restrict its membership to students of the liberal arts in the late 19th century, Edward H. Williams, Jr., a member of Phi Beta Kappa and head of the mining department at Lehigh University, formulated the idea of an honor society for those studying technical subjects. Irving Andrew Heikes, the valedictorian of his class at Lehigh, was initiated as the first student member of Tau Beta Pi on June 15, 1885. A statue on Lehigh's campus commemorates this event. In 1892, a second chapter was established at Michigan State University. Since then, the association has grown to 248 collegiate chapters across the United States and Puerto Rico. Tau Beta Pi was a founding member of the Association of College Honor Societies. The national headquarters of Tau Beta Pi is located in Knoxville, Tennessee on the campus of the University of Tennessee. Although Tau Beta Pi never discriminated on the basis of race or religion, Tau Beta Pi did make its start as a male-only society. Female engineering students were scholastically eligible for Tau Beta Pi as early as 1902; however, those women were not granted membership. Starting in 1936, TBP awarded a \\"women's badge\\" to exceptional female engineering students, and a total of 619 women's badges were awarded until 1969. In 1969, Tau Beta Pi began granting women full membership in the society. In 1974, the Sigma Tau fraternity merged with Tau Beta Pi. Sigma Tau was an honor society for engineering much like Tau Beta Pi and was founded at the University of Nebraska in 1904. At the time of the merger, Sigma Tau consisted of 34 collegiate chapters and a total membership of 45,000. The basis of the merger of Tau Beta Pi and Sigma Tau was the conviction that a single, strong honor society would better serve the engineering profession.  Insignia  The colors of Tau Beta Pi are seal brown and white, which are the school colors of Lehigh. The official badge, called the Bent, is a watch key in the shape of the bent of a trestle (see picture). The trestle is the load-bearing part of the bridge, representing Tau Beta Pi's principle of Integrity and Excellence In Engineering. Originally, the keys could be used to wind watches. However, because watches have since been fabricated with their own winding mechanisms, modern keys do not have this ability. When using the Bent, members must adhere to strict guidelines regarding the exact dimensions of the trestle in order for the Bent to be a valid representation. The symbols on the Bent at the top and the bottom are an ancient form of Greek letters. The quarterly magazine of Tau Beta Pi is also titled The Bent. Plaque recognizing the Georgia Tech chapter of Tau Beta Pi The logo of Tau Beta Pi was revised and approved at the 2019 Convention in Columbus, Ohio. The new logo features the Bent inside a circle, with the words \\"Tau Beta Pi / The Engineering Honor Society\\" either to the right or underneath the symbol and is available in either blue or seal brown on a white background. The old logo, which featured a tilted 3D Bent and the words \\"Tau Beta Pi / The Engineering Honor Society\\" in a lighter blue color was discontinued in October 2019.https://www.tbp.org/off/graphics.cfm A logo for Pi Day was developed in 2016 and features a black seal with white text \\"Tau Beta Pi / The Engineering Honor Society / Pi Day\\" centered around the image of the bent in the middle. The digits of pi wrap around the edge of the seal. Chapters As of 2020, there are 256 Tau Beta Pi Collegiate Chapters; 250 are currently active, 6 are inactive.https://www.tbp.org/off/chapterList.cfm  Membership  There is now only one \\"class\\" of members in Tau Beta Pi, the former classifications of Member with Distinction, Honorary Member, and Associate Member having been discontinued. Election to membership in the association is accomplished only by vote of a collegiate chapter, and members' chapter designations are always those of the chapters which elected them. Members' class numerals are those of the years in which they received the engineering degrees on which their eligibility was based, although members with no engineering degree are designated by the year in which they were initiated. Candidates eligible for consideration for election to membership by a collegiate chapter fall into five general categories: # Undergraduate students. # Graduate students. # Alumni of the chapter's institution who were eligible as students. # Alumni of other institutions who were eligible as students. # Engineers of high attainment in the profession, regardless of college attended, scholastic record, or educational background. = Undergraduate eligibility requirements = Undergraduate students whose scholarship places them in the top eighth of their engineering class in their next-to-last year or in the top fifth of their engineering class in their last college year are eligible for membership consideration. These scholastically eligible students are further considered on the basis of personal integrity, breadth of interest both inside and outside engineering, adaptability, and unselfish activity. At least 50% of a student's coursework must have been completed by the time of their invitation to the society. Students must be pursuing at least one major within their college's engineering school; for this reason, some Computer Science students may or may not be eligible for membership depending on if Computer Science is counted in the engineering school or the liberal arts school at their respective university, for example. Some chapters may set a scholastic-grade deadline below which candidates are not considered, such deadline being higher than that required as a minimum by the Constitution. Elections and initiations are normally held twice a year, in the fall/winter or spring terms of the chapter's institution. Student electees who are financially unable to meet the initiation-fee obligation may make delayed payment arrangements with their chapters, may borrow from the association's loan fund, or may accept election but postpone initiation for up to five years. = Graduate eligibility requirements = Engineering graduate students whose scholarship places them in the top fifth of their graduate class and have completed at least 50% of their coursework or whose high- quality work is attested to by a faculty member may be elected to membership. Engineering alumni of a chapter's institution or of another recognized institution whose scholastic record placed them in the top fifth of their class may be elected to membership. Such candidates are usually recommended to the chapter by a member who knows them. In all cases the requisite scholastic attainment makes candidates eligible for membership consideration. They are further considered on the basis of the association's exemplary character requirement. = Eminent engineer eligibility requirements = Persons who have achieved eminence in engineering may be elected to membership without regard to collegiate records. If they graduated from a recognized engineering college, they must have been engaged in engineering for at least 10 years; if not, they must have practiced engineering for at least 15 years. Such candidates are usually recommended by members who know them. The required degree of eminent achievement is left to the chapters' discretion; and candidates are further considered on the basis of exemplary character. =Historical requirements= Prior to the fall of 1941, Tau Beta Pi's scholastic requirements were that eligible candidates stand in the top eighth of the junior class, but in the top quarter of the senior class. The classes graduating in 1942 were thus the first to be admitted under the higher requirements. Until 1969 membership in Tau Beta Pi was limited to men, although qualified women were offered an award called the Women's Badge. From its authorization in 1936 until its elimination by the admission of women to membership, 619 Women's Badges were awarded by 98 chapters. Those women have now been offered membership by their chapters after Tau Beta Pi initiated its first female members in 1969. = Membership verification = Tau Beta Pi membership catalogs were published in 1898, 1911, 1916, 1926, 1932, and 1939. The 1946 Convention authorized discontinuance of them because of the excessive cost and limited usefulness. Today, membership can be verified online. = Membership benefits = Tau Beta Pi members gain access to a variety of benefits for life after initiation, including access to applying for $2000 scholarships for rising seniors (about 50% acceptance rate) and $10,000 fellowships for graduate students (about 10% acceptance rate), a private LinkedIn group of alumni, the opportunity to attend the annual national convention (with sponsored travel for voting delegates) and participate in a Tau Beta Pi-only recruiting fair, and graduation stoles and cords for members in good standing during their graduation. Members also receive automatic entry-level advancement of US Gov applicants to GS-7* 4 and member-only lifetime discounts from companies like Geico, Dell, SIRVA Home, PPI for FE/EIT and PE exams, and hotels around the world.  Major activities  Tau Beta Pi has an active fellowship and scholarship program supported by alumni members and other supporters. Some of the results of these programs are: * Over 2,798 students have received scholarships for their senior year of engineering study.https://www.tbp.org/scholarships.cfm * 869 students have been given stipends exceeding $4,555,000 since 1929. * 1,768 students have borrowed more than $830,000 from the educational loan program since 1932. * 479 students have received scholarship awards of $958,000 since 1998. = MindSET program = One initiative provided by Tau Beta Pi is the MindSET (Math, Science, Engineering, Technology) K-12 program. This program is designed to foster interest in engineering among elementary, middle, and high school students with classroom and hands-on activities. The goal of MindSET is to have students completing algebra by 8th grade and calculus by 12th grade. MindSET was first conceived by Dr. Jonathan F. Earle as GatorTRAX, a program run by the Florida Alpha chapter, and is now a national program with more than 50 active projects across the country.

She was laid down as Kanalku Bay under Maritime Commission contract by Kaiser Co., Inc., Vancouver, Washington on 15 September 1943; renamed Marcus Island on 6 November 1943; launched on 16 December 1943; sponsored by Mrs. S. L. La Hache; acquired by the Navy on 26 January 1944; and commissioned at Astoria, Oregon on 26 January 1944, Captain Charles F. Greber in command. Service history =World War II= After shakedown and training along the West Coast, Marcus Island made a round trip aircraft ferry run to U.S. bases in the South Pacific from 19 May ‚Äì 1 July. Then she embarked Composite Squadron 21 (VC-21), departed San Diego on 20 July, and arrived Tulagi in the Solomon Islands on 24 August to prepare for operations in the Palaus. As flagship for Rear Admiral W. D. Sample's Carrier Division 27 (CarDiv 27), she began preinvasion strikes against Peleliu and Angaur on 12 September. She provided close air support as assault troops hit the beaches beginning the 15th, and until 2 October, she launched scores of sorties during embittered fighting on the rugged islands. Marcus Island arrived at Manus in the Admiralty Islands on the 4th, and after completing preparations for the invasion of the Philippines, she sortied with the Task Group 77.4 (TG 77.4) on 12 October for Leyte as part of the task unit known as \\"Taffy 2\\". Beginning on 18 October, she launched airstrikes against enemy positions and during the next week, her pilots flew 261 target and air cover missions. The Battle for Leyte Gulf and the running fight of \\"Taffy 3\\" in the Battle off Samar on 25 October are well chronicled elsewhere; Marcus Islands war diary succinctly recorded the pace of action on the 25th ‚Äì \\"A day of intense activity\\". During the heroic stand of \\"Taffy 3\\", fighters and bombers from Marcus Island struck hard at the Japanese force. One Grumman TBM Avenger put a torpedo into the portside aft of a heavy cruiser, probably . Amidst intense antiaircraft fire, her fighters made repeated strafing runs against battleships, cruisers, and destroyers. Her planes joined in two strikes against the retreating Japanese ships that afternoon, and her pilots claimed 14 hits on enemy ships including a torpedo and six bomb hits on an Agato class cruiser. In addition, her fighters battled and shot down five Japanese planes. On the 26th, she sent 12 bombers and fighters to the Visayan Sea where they helped sink and with repeated hits from bombs, rockets, and machine guns. Marcus Island departed the Philippines 30 October but returned less than two weeks later as part of the escort for the Mindoro attack group. Departing Kossol on 10 December, she transited Surigao Strait on the 13th. Her patrolling aircraft shot down one enemy fighter on 14 December and shot down three more planes on the 15th. Marcus Island came under attack the morning of the Mindoro invasion, and from 08:10‚Äì09:30, enemy planes made three suicide runs and one bombing strike against the carrier. All the planes were shot down or deflected by intense antiaircraft fire, although two kamikazes crashed close off the bow to port and starboard causing minor damage and several casualties. Between 16‚Äì23 December, Marcus Island returned to the Admiralties; on the 29th she departed once more for the western Philippines, steaming with units of the Luzon Attack Force for operations in Lingayen Gulf. As she steamed through the Mindanao Sea on 5 January 1945, one of her planes depth- bombed a Japanese midget submarine, which was subsequently rammed and sunk by . Three days later, her planes shot down four enemy aircraft in spirited dogfights. As the amphibious landings began the 9th, Marcus Island launched close support and strafing strikes over the Lingayen beaches. In addition they attacked and sank two small enemy coastal ships north of Lingayen Gulf along the Luzon coast that same day. Marcus Island continued to provide coordinated airstrikes in support of the Lingayen operations until steaming down the Luzon coast on 17 January. On the 29th, she furnished close air support during an unopposed landing at Zambales Province, Luzon, then she steamed to Ulithi, arriving on 5 February. Rear Admiral Sample hauled down his flag on 6 February, and on the 8th, Marcus Island became flagship of Rear Admiral Felix Stump's CarDiv 24. The carrier debarked hard-hitting VC-21 on 14 February and embarked VC-87 the same day. After completing training out of Ulithi, she steamed to Leyte Gulf on 4‚Äì7 March to conduct rehearsal exercises for the impending invasion of the Ryukyu Islands. Departing on 21 March, Marcus Island arrived south of Kerama Retto on the 26th and began launching airstrikes. She provided close air support and air cover during operations in the Ryukyus. From 26 March ‚Äì 29 April, she operated primarily south and southeast of Okinawa while launching attack and spotter strikes. Composite Observation Squadron 1 (VCO-1) replaced VC-87 on 5 April. Planes of both the squadrons flew 1,085 sorties during this period and pounded enemy airfields, gun emplacements, supply dumps, and troop concentrations. Her pilots shot down 11 Japanese aircraft and destroyed another 13 on the ground. =Postwar= Marcus Island departed Okinawa on 29 April, and after loading damaged aircraft at Guam, she sailed on 5 May for the United States, arriving San Diego on 22 May. She sailed west again on 10 July, carrying replacement troops and aircraft to Pearl Harbor and Guam before returning to Alameda, California on V-J Day. Sailing once more via Pearl Harbor and Guam, she reached Okinawa on 28 September and embarked returning troops, arriving San Francisco on 24 October. By early-January 1946, she completed additional \\"Magic Carpet\\" runs to Guam and Pearl Harbor. Departing San Diego on 12 January, Marcus Island sailed via the Panama Canal and Norfolk, arriving Boston on 2 February. She remained at Boston, decommissioned there on 12 December 1946, and entered the Atlantic Reserve Fleet. She reclassified to CVHE-77 on 12 June 1955 and to AKV-27 on 7 May 1959. She was sold at Boston to Comarket, Inc. on 29 February 1960. Awards Marcus Island received four battle stars for World War II service. Some claims that the ship received five battle stars but not yet proved.

This movement is part of a larger anti-tax movement in the western United States which began with the passage of Proposition 13 in California. The tax revolt, carried out in large part by a series of citizens' initiatives and referendums, has reshaped the debate about taxes and public services in Oregon. Major figures The leaders of the tax revolt include Don McIntire, president of the Taxpayer Association of Oregon, and Bill Sizemore, leader of Oregon Taxpayers United. Much of the money spent to promote these anti-tax measures were provided by out-of-state backers including Americans for Tax Reform headed by Grover Norquist.  National context and the passage of Measure 5  Oregon voters placed limits to property tax in the Oregon Constitution in 1990 with the passage of Measure 5. A majority of voters were frustrated by the increase in property taxes attributed to rapidly rising property values in the Portland area. Some attribute this home price inflation to an influx of population in the Portland metro, which is surrounded by an urban growth boundary that limits the supply of developable land. Others observe that the situation was much more complex, pointing to the loose monetary policy pursued by Alan Greenspan, including adjustments to the CPI that measured homeowners equivalent rent instead of actual home price, a recovering economy in the region, and numerous other factors. Measure 5 shifted the burden of school funding to the state (which levies an income tax) and away from counties. Measure 5 also equalized school funding throughout the state, which meant that schools in rural areas benefited while schools in Portland saw budgets reduced.  Measure 47  Measure 47, which attempted to cap the annual rate at which property taxes could rise. This was partly to moderate fast growing house prices in Portland. Measure 47 also instituted Oregon's double majority rule, in which local tax levies could only pass in minor elections when voter turnout surpassed half of the registered voters. In November 1996, Measure 47 was passed by the Oregon voters 52.3% to 47.7%. Problems with the legal wording of Measure 47 caused the Oregon Legislature to send Measure 50 to voters in 1997, which clarified Measure 47. During a special election in May 1997, Measure 50 was approved by the voters 55.7% to 44.3%.  Later legislation  Bill Sizemore The tax revolt manifested itself in a series of budget battles in the Oregon Legislature about school funding, the Oregon Health Plan, and other spending priorities during the late 1990s. Then Governor John Kitzhaber and the Republican leadership in the legislature clashed repeatedly over budget priorities. In 2000, Don McIntire helped place Measure 8 on Oregon's ballot, which would have limited state spending to 15 percent of personal income for the previous biennium. Measure 8 was defeated by a margin of 43.5% to 56.5%. However, in the same election Oregonians enshrined the so-called \\"kicker check\\"‚Äîa rebate check given to taxpayers in the event that state revenues sufficiently exceed forecasts‚Äîinto the state constitution with Measure 86 which passed 62% to 38%. Anti-tax activists defeated two proposals in 2003 and 2004 (Measure 28 and Measure 30), which were referred to voters by the Oregon State Legislature to increase income taxes temporarily. Sizemore's group ran into legal problems in 2002. Sizemore sparked the ire of several public employees unions with a series of initiatives aimed at reducing public employee pensions and reducing their political power. The unions responded with the Voter Education Project, which tracked signature gatherers hired by Sizemore to place measures on the ballot. After documenting instances of fraud by signature gatherers, the Oregon Education Association, a teachers' union, successfully sued Sizemore's organization under racketeering laws in 2003. The $2.3 million judgment against Oregon Taxpayer's United severely hurt Sizemore's ability to put measures on the ballot. The fraud allegations also led to the passage of Measure 26 in 2002, which prohibits the payment of signature gatherers on a per-signature basis, and was approved by voters 75% to 25%. Tax activists generally claim that Oregon's government is wasteful and inefficient, arguing that the government could do better with less. They often highlight programs that they feel are unnecessary. Opponents of the tax revolt argue that passing tax decreases via ballot measure leads to short-sighted policy making, in which voters are enticed to vote with the revolt by lower tax bills and without thinking about the budget problems caused by reduced revenues.

She was laid down as Bucareli Bay (ACV-61) under Maritime Commission contract by Kaiser Company, Inc., Vancouver, Washington on 15 January 1943; renamed Manila Bay on 3 April 1943; launched on 10 July 1943; sponsored by Mrs. Robert W. Bockius; reclassified CVE-61 on 15 July 1943; acquired by the Navy on 5 October 1943; and commissioned the same day at Astoria, Oregon, Captain Boynton L. Braun in command. Service history =World War II= After a shakedown cruise along the west coast, Manila Bay sailed for Pearl Harbor on 20 November and returned a load of damaged planes to San Diego on 4 December. After training exercises, with Composite Squadron 7 (VC-7) embarked, she departed Hawaii on 3 January 1944. A week later she embarked Rear Admiral Ralph Davidson and became flagship for Carrier Division 24. Joining Task Force 52 (TF 52), she sortied 22 January for the invasion of the Marshall Islands. Between 31 January-6 February, she launched air and antisubmarine patrols as well as dozens of combat missions. Her planes bombed and strafed enemy positions from Kwajalein Island north to Bigej Island and destroyed ammunition dumps and ground installations. She remained in the Marshalls during the next month and extended her operations late in February first to Eniwetok and then to Majuro. Departing Majuro on 7 March, Manila Bay reached Espiritu Santo on the 12th. Three days later she joined TF 37 for airstrikes and surface bombardments against Kavieng, New Ireland on 19‚Äì20 March. During the next month she cruised between the Solomons and the Bismarck Archipelago supporting the protracted offensive to neutralize the Archipelago and the Japanese fortress at Rabaul. Thence, on 19 April she steamed so that her planes could attack enemy positions on New Guinea. New Guinea American naval and ground forces began a three‚Äìpronged invasion along northern New Guinea at Aitape, Hollandia, and Tanahmerah Bay on 22 April. During and after the invasion Manila Bay launched protective air patrols and sent fighters and bombers to attack and destroy Japanese installations in the Aitape area. On 4 May she returned to Manus Island where Rear Admiral Felix Stump relieved Admiral Davidson as Commander, Carrier Division 24. Admiral Stump transferred his flag to on 6 May, and the following day Manila Bay sailed for overhaul at Pearl Harbor where she arrived on 18 May. After loading 37 Army Republic P-47 Thunderbolts of the Army Air Forces' 73rd Fighter Squadron, 318th Fighter Group, Manila Bay sailed on 5 June for the Mariana Islands. Steaming via Eniwetok, she reached the eastern approaches to Saipan on 19 June. During the next 4 days, she remained east of the embattled island as ships and planes of the Fast Carrier Task Force repulsed the Japanese Fleet in the Battle of the Philippine Sea, and inflicted staggering losses on the enemy, crippling the Imperial Navy‚Äôs air strength permanently. On 23 June, Manila Bay came under enemy air attack during refueling operations east of Saipan. Four Aichi D3A Val dive bombers attacked her from dead ahead, dropping their bombs which exploded wide to port. As a precautionary and rather unusual move which Raymond A. Spruance later characterized as \\"commendable initiative\\", Manila Bay launched four of the P-47 Thunderbolts she was ferrying to fly protective CAP until radar screens were clear of contacts. The Army fighters then flew to Saipan, their intended destination. Manila Bay launched the remaining planes the next day and returned to Eniwetok, arriving on 27 June. After embarking 207 wounded troops, she departed on 1 July, touched Pearl Harbor on the 8th, and reached San Diego on 16 July. Manila Bay returned to Pearl on 31 August. Two days later, Captain Fitzhugh Lee III took command of the veteran carrier, and after embarking VC-80, Manila Bay departed on 15 September as a unit of Carrier Division 24 (CarDiv 24). Steaming via Eniwetok, she reached Manus 3 October and began final preparations for the invasion of the Philippines at Leyte Gulf. Leyte Gulf Assigned to the Task Group 77.4 (TG 77.4), Manila Bay departed on 12 October for waters east of the Philippines. Prior to the invasion, her planes pounded enemy ground targets on Leyte, Samar, and Cebu Islands. She launched ground support, spotting, and air cover strikes during the amphibious assaults on 20 October, and she sent bombers and fighters to support ground forces during the critical first few days at Leyte. As Manila Bay cruised to the east of Leyte Gulf with other carriers of Admiral Stump's \\"Taffy 2\\" (Task Unit 77.4.2, TU 77.4.2), powerful Japanese naval forces converged upon the Philippines and launched a three-pronged offensive to drive the Americans from Leyte. In a series of masterful and coordinated surface attacks, an American battleship, cruiser, and destroyer force met and destroyed enemy ships in the Battle of Surigao Strait early on 25 October. Surviving Japanese ships retreated into the Mindanao Sea pursued by destroyers, PT boats, and after sunrise by carrier-based bombers and fighters. Manila Bay sent an eight-plane strike against ground targets on Leyte before sunrise; subsequently, these planes bombed and strafed retiring enemy ships southwest of Panaon Island. A second strike about midmorning pounded the cruiser . In the meantime, however, Manila Bay turned her planes against a more immediate threat: the enemy attack against ships of Taffy 3. =Samar= A running battle ensued between the escort carriers of Rear Adm. Clifton Sprague's Taffy 3 and the larger, vastly more powerful surface ships of Vice Admiral Takeo Kurita's Center Force. The self-sacrificing attacks by American destroyers and destroyer escorts, and the prompt, aggressive, and unceasing torpedo, bomb, and strafing strikes by planes from Taffy 2 and Taffy 3 contributed to the American victory against great odds in the Battle off Samar. Manila Bay launched two airstrikes during the enemy pursuit of Taffy 3 and two more as the Japanese retreated. At 08:30, she sent four torpedo-laden Grumman TBM Avengers and a seven-plane escort to join the desperate fight. Three launched torpedoes at a battleship, probably , but they missed. The fourth plane launched her torpedo at a heavy cruiser, most likely . It hit the ship to starboard near the fantail, forcing her out of control. The second strike an hour later by two Avengers resulted in one torpedo hit on the portside amidships against an unidentified battleship. As the Japanese ships broke off attack and circled off Samar, the airstrikes continued. At 11:20, Manila Bay launched four Avengers, carrying 500 pound bombs, and four bombers from other carriers. Escorted by General Motors FM-2 Wildcats and led by Commander R. L. Fowler, they soon joined planes from other Taffy carriers. Shortly after 12:30, some 70 planes surprised and attacked the retiring Center Force, strafing and bombing through intense antiaircraft fire. Manila Bays bombers made a hit and two near misses on the lead battleship, probably or . Manila Bay launched her final strike at 12:45, strafing destroyers and getting two hits on a cruiser. Later that afternoon, Manila Bays CAP intercepted a Japanese bomber-fighter strike about 50 miles north of Taffy 2. Her four fighters broke up the enemy formation, and with reinforcements drove off the attackers before they reached the carriers. Her planes continued to attack enemy ships the following day. Laden with rockets and bombs, one of her Avengers scored two hits on the cruiser and several rocket hits on the destroyer . Both ships sank about noon in the Visayan Sea after numerous air attacks. Manila Bay resumed air operations in support of Leyte ground forces on 27 October. During ground support and air cover missions, her planes shot down an Aichi D3A \\"Val\\" on 27 October and bagged two Nakajima Ki-43 \\"Oscars\\" on 29 October. Late on 30 October she sailed for the Admiralty Islands, arriving at Manus on 4 November. Mindoro After steaming to Kossol Passage late in November, Manila Bay departed on 10 December to provide air cover for the Mindoro invasion convoys. The task force entered Mindanao Sea early on 13 December. Late that afternoon in the Sulu Sea south of Negros, they encountered enemy aircraft. The fighter cover shot down or repulsed most of the attackers. Accurate fire from Manila Bay shot down one kamikaze. A second kamikaze hit the destroyer . During and after the Mindoro landings on 15 December, Manila Bay sent her planes on ground support and air cover missions. As troops poured ashore, more kamikazes attempted to break the air cover and crash into ships of the covering and carrier group. The few that escaped the combat air patrols were either shot down or driven off by accurate antiaircraft fire. Manila Bay helped down three of the raiders and her fighters knocked out two more. After recovering her planes on 16 December, she sailed in convoy via Surigao Strait and reached Kossol on 19 December. After a trip to Manus, Manila Bay sortied New Year's Day 1945 with ships of the Luzon Attack Force. With five other escort carriers she provided air cover for Vice Admiral Jesse B. Oldendorf's Bombardment and Fire Support Group, and direct air support for Vice Admiral Daniel E. Barbey's San Fabian Attack Force. The task groups steamed via Surigao Strait and the Mindanao Sea into the Sulu Sea where they turned north for the Mindoro Strait. Enemy nuisance and suicide raids began in earnest on 4 January; and despite the tight air cover provided by CVE aircraft, a kamikaze crashed into the flight deck of causing her to sink. The enemy air attacks intensified on 5 January. Patrolling fighters broke up morning and early afternoon strikes, shooting down numerous raiders. At 16:50, a third attack sent all hands to general quarters. Vectored CAP shot down several enemy planes and anti-aircraft fire accounted for others. Three planes got through to the cruisers , the destroyer , and the Australian cruiser . Just before 17:50, two kamikazes dove at Manila Bay from the portside. The first plane hit the flight deck to starboard abaft the bridge, causing fires on the flight and hangar decks, destroying radar transmitting spaces, and wiping out all communications. The second plane, aimed for the bridge, missed the island close aboard to starboard and hit the sea off the fantail. Firefighting parties promptly brought the blazes under control, including those of two fueled and burning torpedo planes in the hangar deck. Within 24 hours, she resumed limited air operations. Most repairs to her damaged electrical and communication circuits were completed by 9 January, when the amphibious invasion in Lingayen Gulf got underway. Lingayen Gulf Manila Bay had 14 men killed and 52 wounded, but by 10 January she resumed full duty in support of the Lingayen Gulf operations. In addition to providing air cover for the task force, her planes flew 104 sorties against targets in western Luzon. They gave effective close support for ground troops at Lingayen and San Fabian and bombed, rocketed, and strafed gun emplacements, buildings, truck convoys, and troop concentrations from Lingayen to Baguio. Manila Bay departed in convoy late on 17 January. Steaming via Leyte, Ulithi, and Pearl Harbor, she arrived San Diego on 15 February. Battle damage repairs completed late in April, with VC-72 embarked she trained in Hawaiian waters until sailing for the western Pacific on 24 May. She closed the coast of Okinawa on 13 June and during the next week launched rocket and strafing strikes in the Ryukyu Islands. She departed for the Marianas on 20 June and operated out of Guam and Eniwetok during the closing weeks of the war. Manila Bay steamed to the Aleutians in mid-August. As a unit of TF 44, she departed Adak Island on 31 August to support occupation operations in northern Japan. From 7‚Äì12 September her planes carried out photographic and reconnaissance missions over northern Honsh≈´ and southern Hokkaid≈ç and dropped emergency supplies at POW camps. She returned to Pearl Harbor on 24 September, unloaded her aircraft, and steamed to the Marshall Islands carrying replacement troops. =Post-war= Assigned to \\"Magic Carpet\\" duty, Manila Bay embarked 1,031 veterans at Eniwetok, and from 6‚Äì18 October sailed to San Francisco. In November, the carrier aided the disabled Boeing 314 Honolulu Clipper 650 miles east of Oahu. After completing 2 more \\"Magic Carpet\\" runs, she departed Pearl Harbor on 27 January 1946 and reached Norfolk, Va. on 18 February. She steamed to Boston from 15‚Äì17 April, decommissioned there on 31 July 1946, and entered the Atlantic Reserve Fleet. She was reclassified CVU-61 on 12 June 1955; her name was struck from the Navy list on 27 May 1958; and she was sold for scrap to Hugo New Corp., 2 September 1959. Awards Manila Bay received eight battle stars for World War II service.

She was named after Mission Bay, located northwest of San Diego. Launched in May 1943, and commissioned in September, she served as a transport carrier, ferrying aircraft to bases in Europe, Africa, and Asia. She also participated in the Battle of the Atlantic, protecting convoys and conducting antisubmarine patrols. Notably, she escorted President Roosevelt on-board the cruiser as he returned from the Yalta Conference. She was decommissioned in February 1947, when she was mothballed in the Atlantic Reserve Fleet. Ultimately, she was sold for scrapping in April 1959. Design and description The profile of a standardized Casablanca-class escort carrier, prior to refit with additional anti-aircraft guns.

Standardized with her sister ships, she was long overall, had a beam of , and a draft of . She displaced standard, with a full load. She had a long hangar deck and a long flight deck. She was powered with two Uniflow reciprocating steam engines, which drove two shafts, providing , thus enabling her to make . The ship had a cruising range of at a speed of . Her compact size necessitated the installment of an aircraft catapult at her bow, and there were two aircraft elevators to facilitate movement of aircraft between the flight and hangar deck: one each fore and aft. One /38 caliber dual-purpose gun was mounted on the stern. Anti-aircraft defense was provided by eight Bofors anti-aircraft guns in single mounts, as well as twelve Oerlikon cannons, which were mounted around the perimeter of the deck. By the end of the war, Casablanca-class carriers had been modified to carry thirty 20‚Äìmm cannons, and the amount of 40‚Äìmm guns had been doubled to sixteen, by putting them into twin mounts. These modifications were in response to increasing casualties due to kamikaze attacks. Casablanca-class escort carriers were designed to carry 27 aircraft, but the hangar deck could accommodate more. Construction The escort carrier was laid down on 28 December 1943, under a Maritime Commission contract, MC hull 1096, by Kaiser Shipbuilding Company, Vancouver, Washington. She was launched on 26 May 1943; sponsored by Mrs. James McDonald; transferred to the United States Navy and commissioned on 13 September 1943, with Captain William Lehigh Rees in command. Service history Mission Bay photographed on 23 November 1943, in the Caribbean after passing through the Panama Canal, bound for Portsmouth. Upon being commissioned, Mission Bay underwent a shakedown cruise down the West Coast to San Diego. She departed San Diego on 15 November bound for the East Coast. Passing through the Panama Canal, arriving at Portsmouth, Virginia on 5 December. There, she was assigned to participate in the Battle of the Atlantic, escorting convoys and hunting German U-boats. She left the East Coast on 26 December, escorting convoys on their way to Casablanca, French Morocco. She arrived on 19 January 1944. She then sailed back, returning to Portsmouth on 8 February. Her next cruise started on 20 February, when she departed New York City, transporting Army planes and crew, bound for India. Along the way, she made stops at Recife, Brazil, and Cape Town, Union of South Africa. She arrived at Karachi on 29 March, where she unloaded her cargo. She then proceeded back to her home port, arriving back at Portsmouth by 12 May. On 28 May, she departed New York again, ferrying aircraft along with and , round trip to Casablanca. She arrived on 6 June, departed on 8 June, and arrived back at New York on 17 June. As she entered New York Harbor, she collided with a dredge, which resulted in significant damage to the hull. She arrived at Portsmouth on 22 June, where repairs were conducted throughout the month of July. During this time period, Commander William Ellis Gentner, Jr. took over command of the ship. An aerial photograph of ships mothballed at the Bayonne Naval Supply Depot. Mission Bay is visible at the far side of the peninsula, along with several other escort carriers. On 8 September, she departed, bound for the South Atlantic. After refueling at Dakar, French West Africa on 20 September, she began antisubmarine operations, which lasted throughout the month of November. She arrived back at Portsmouth on 25 November. On 21 December, she left harbor, and proceeded to the Caribbean, where she conducted exercises in the strait between Florida and Cuba. These exercises and miscellaneous tasks took her until February 1945. She was then ordered to sail to Gibraltar, where she would meet the heavy cruiser which was carrying President Franklin D. Roosevelt and his entourage back from the Yalta Conference. She rendezvoused with the cruiser on 23 February, and escorted the ship as it passed through the open Atlantic. She then left the convoy, mooring at Bermuda on 27 February, before returning to Portsmouth on 9 March. She departed again on 29 March, and conducted a final antisubmarine sweep of the North Atlantic. Having found no contacts, she anchored off of New York on 14 May. She then cruised off the East Coast, training pilots and conducting pilot qualifications, before she proceeded to Guantanamo Bay on 19 July. She arrived at Quonset Point on 2 August, where she continued training pilots until December, well after the Japanese surrender. On 19 December, she was assigned to the 16th Reserve Fleet, based at Norfolk, Virginia. She was fully decommissioned on 21 February 1947, and mothballed as part of the Atlantic Reserve Fleet, albeit she still stayed with the 16th Reserve Fleet. On 30 November 1949, she was moved up to the Bayonne Naval Supply Depot, New Jersey, where she lay until she was struck from the Navy list on 1 September 1958. She was sold to Hugo Neu Corp on 30 April 1959, and towed to Japan, where she was broken up, starting January 1960.

It was named after Ommaney Bay, located at the south end of Baranof Island, Alaska. Launched in late 1943 and commissioned in early 1944, the ship took part in the Mariana and Palau Islands campaign followed by several battles during the Philippines campaign in 1944 and early 1945. She was heavily damaged in a kamikaze attack and subsequently scuttled on 4 January 1945, with the loss of 95 men, including two men on board the destroyer escort who were killed by flying debris.

One /38 caliber dual purpose gun was mounted on the stern, and she was equipped with 16 Bofors 40 mm (1.57 in) anti-aircraft guns in twin mounts, as well as 12 Oerlikon 20 mm cannons, which were used in an anti-aircraft capability. By the end of the war, Casablanca-class carriers had been modified to carry thirty 20 mm cannons, as a response to increasing casualties due to kamikaze attacks. Anti-aircraft guns were mounted around the perimeter of the deck. Casablanca-class escort carriers were designed to carry 27 aircraft, but she sometimes went over or under this number. For example, during the Mariana and Palau Islands campaign and the Battle off Samar, she carried 16 FM-2 fighters and 11 TBM-1C torpedo bombers, for a total of 27 aircraft. During the Battle of Mindoro, she carried 24 FM-2 fighters and 9 TBM-1C torpedo bombers, for a total of 33 aircraft. Whilst she was in transit in support of the Invasion of Lingayen Gulf, and during her eventual sinking, she carried 19 FM-2 fighters, 10 TBM-1C torpedo bombers, a TBM-3 variant torpedo bomber, and a TBM-1CP spotter plane, for a total of 31 aircraft. Construction The escort carrier was laid down on 6 October 1943, under a Maritime Commission contract, MC hull 1116, by Kaiser Shipbuilding Company, Vancouver, Washington. She was launched on 29 December 1943; sponsored by Mrs. P. K. Robottom; transferred to the United States Navy and commissioned on 11 February 1944, Commodore Howard L. Young in command.  Service history  After commissioning and fitting out at Astoria, Oregon, and conducting shakedown in Puget Sound, Ommaney Bay sailed on 19 March 1944 from Oakland, California, bound for Brisbane, Australia, with passengers and a cargo of supplies and aircraft. By 27 April, she had completed her mission and was back in San Diego, where she began a rigorous ten days of carrier qualification landings, drills and tests. Then, after minor alterations and repairs, the ship sailed on 10 June for Pearl Harbor. Until 12 August she trained air groups and squadrons, then she sailed to Tulagi to rehearse for the invasion of the Palau Islands. From 11 September until the beginning of October, Ommaney Bay sat off Peleliu and Angaur and provided air cover for the fleet and close support strikes for the forces ashore. On 18 September 1944, a TBM-1C from Ommaney Bay, low on fuel, was the first aircraft to land onto Peleliu's airfield. Ommaney Bay sailed to Manus Island to renew her depleted stock of fuel and ammunition, then joined Rear Admiral Felix Stump's \\"Taffy 2\\" (TU 77.4.2) for the invasion of Leyte, arriving on 22 October. At the beginning of the Battle off Samar, the escort carriers began launching airstrikes in an effort to cripple as many of the approaching enemy force as possible. On 25 October, at 01:55, Admiral Thomas C. Kinkaid ordered three searches at daybreak. Ommaney Bay was directed at 05:09 to cover the sector between 340¬∞ and 30¬∞. Because of delays, it took two hours for a search contingent of five fighters and seven torpedo bombers to be launched. If launched earlier, the patrol could've possibly intercepted Vice-Admiral Takeo Kurita's task force, and provided advance warning for Taffy 3, influencing the subsequent Battle off Samar. The search contingent, becoming aware of the confrontation, moved to aid Taffy 3. At around 08:20, five Wildcats and six Avengers from Ommaney Bay attacked the cruiser , inflicting some damage. 40 minutes later, her Avengers joined 17 other torpedo bombers in crippling Mogami. She sank three hours later, scuttled by . Ommaney Bay launched some six strikes that day, and along with the rest of Task Group 77.4.1, she turned potential defeat into victory. As part of Taffy 2, she was also obliged to accept aircraft from other task groups, which were damaged or low on fuel from their strikes. She was forced to jettison several aircraft over her deck to preserve the functionality of her flight deck. On 30 October, her task group retired from the Leyte Gulf, bound for Manus. A Yokosuka P1Y kamikaze aircraft passing above Ommaney Bays flight deck. The carrier spent the month of November at Manus and Kossol Passage for availability and replenishment. On 10 November, she was docked in Seeadler Harbor, approximately from the ammunition ship , when the ship suddenly exploded violently. Even from her distant vantage point, Ommaney Bay was showered with metal fragments, and was hit by a tidal wave. From 12 December to 17 December, the escort carrier operated in the Mindanao and Sulu Seas in support of operations on the island of Mindoro. On the early morning of 15 December, forty Japanese planes, divided equally between kamikazes and escorts, took off from Clark Field and Davao, bound for the battleships and carriers to the east of Mindoro. The first sightings were reported at 7:00, and for the rest of the morning, kamikaze attacks harried the task force. At 09:40, a group of Japanese planes dove towards the carriers. One plane missed with a bomb, and disengaged, and two were shot down by anti-aircraft fire from and the destroyer escorts. However, a Yokosuka P1Y kamikaze dove directly towards Ommaney Bay, approaching from the port-bow side. Engaged by heavy anti-aircraft fire from the entire task force, the plane was set ablaze about away, and passed over the flight deck, crashing into the ocean. On 19 December she returned to Kossol Passage. On 27 December, she departed for the Philippines in support of the planned 6th Army landings at Lingayen Gulf. After arriving, she paused at San Pedro Bay, before leaving port and entering the Sulu Sea on 3 January 1945. Sinking Ommaney Bay under attack by kamikaze aircraft, 4 January 1945. Ommaney Bay burning after the kamikaze attack. Ommaney Bay engulfed in smoke and flames, a short while after the attack. Photographed from the battleship , the destroyer is depicted maneuvering into position, whilst attempting to combat the flames. On the afternoon of 4 January 1945, she was transiting the Sulu Sea, to the west of the Philippines. At 17:00, approximately 15 Japanese planes were picked up on radar, west of the task group, and approaching quickly. These planes split into two groups, one group heading towards the rear of the task group, whilst the other continued on its course towards the center. Albeit fighters from the carrier group were scrambled, false radar signals hampered their efforts to intercept, and the only successful interception was when P-47 fighters intercepted two enemy planes, shooting down one. The other plane escaped, and is believed to be the kamikaze which would attack Ommaney Bay. This successful intercept was not reported back to command, nor was the fact that the plane which escaped was being herded towards the carrier group. At 17:12, a Yokosuka P1Y penetrated the screen undetected and made for Ommaney Bay, approaching directly towards the ship's bow. Captain Young later reported that the kamikaze's approach was concealed by the blinding glare of the sun. Captain Young, acutely aware of the kamikaze threat, had assigned multiple lookouts throughout the carrier's deck. At the time of the attack, ten lookouts were assigned, along with an additional lookout located on the signal platform, equipped with Polaroid glasses. Additionally, a lack of radar signals had led the task group to believe that the Japanese planes had withdrawn, and the kamikaze attack took the lookouts by complete surprise. was only able to respond with inaccurate anti-aircraft fire, whilst Ommaney Bay was unable to react at all. The plane sliced across the superstructure with its wing, collapsing it onto the flight deck. It then veered into her flight deck on the forward starboard side. Two bombs were released; one of them penetrated the flight deck and detonated below, setting off a series of explosions among the fully gassed planes on the forward third of the hangar deck, near the No. 1 boiler uptakes. The second bomb passed through the hangar deck, ruptured the fire main on the second deck, and exploded near the starboard side. A TBM torpedo bomber had been hit by the kamikaze's wreckage, sparking a fire which consumed the aft of the flight deck. Water pressure forward was lost immediately, along with power and bridge communications. An oil tank may have been breached, contributing to the fire, as the smoke was noted as looking \\"oily\\". Men struggling with the terrific blazes on the hangar deck soon had to abandon it because of the heavy black smoke from the burning planes and exploding .50 caliber ammunition. Destroyer escorts found it difficult to assist Ommaney Bay, because of the intense heat, the ammunition going off, and the real possibility that a catastrophic detonation could be triggered by the blaze. The destroyer , attempting to maneuver into a position to fight the fires, collided with the carrier, damaging her port bridge wing. At 17:45, wounded crew began to be taken off the ship, and by 17:50 the entire topside area had become untenable. In addition, the stored torpedo warheads threatened to detonate at any time. The order to abandon ship was given. At 18:12, Captain Young was the last man to evacuate the burning wreck. At 18:18, the torpedoes stored in the aft end of the ship finally detonated, collapsing the flight deck and launching debris onto the destroyers who were rescuing survivors. Two crewmen from the aboard a motor whaleboat were struck and killed by airborne debris. At 19:58 the carrier was scuttled by a torpedo from the destroyer , under orders from Admiral Jesse B. Oldendorf. A total of 95 Navy men were lost, and 65 men were wounded, including the two killed from Eichenberger. On 6 January and on 9 January, was struck by kamikaze attacks, killing seven survivors rescued from Ommaney Bay. As a replacement for the sunken carrier, was dispatched to support the landing on Lingayen Gulf.

She transferred eight aircraft to other ships in the harbor. On the morning of 29 April, she made rendezvous with Task Force 58 (TF 58) to furnish replacement aircraft, prior to its first strike against the then powerful Japanese stronghold of Truk. The ship then proceeded to Majuro, arriving 3 May, and rejoined TF 58 after its successful strike on Truk. There she unloaded all her aircraft and most aviation spares and materiel, and took on aircraft in need of major overhaul, and salvage equipment. With and three destroyers, the ship turned toward the US on 7 May, arriving in San Francisco Bay 20 May. At San Diego, she embarked Composite Squadron 76 (VC-76), commanded by Lieutenant Commander James W. McCauley, for shakedown air operations. On 30 July the ship shoved off for Pearl Harbor, arriving 6 August. The extra aircraft were unloaded and all resemblance to a ferry transport disappeared.

The Marines successfully landed on Peleliu Island and established a beachhead aided by her aircraft. From D-Day until 29 September, with the exception of one day when bombs and ammunition were replenished at Kossol Passage, her aircraft bombed and strafed the Japanese, and searched for enemy shipping, aircraft, and submarines. She encountered no air opposition during the operation. By 30 September, when the airstrip on Peleliu was operational Petrof Bay retired to Manus Island.Rick Cline. \\"Escort Carrier WWII: War in the Pacific on the aircraft carrier USS Petrof Bay\\". RA Cline Publishing. July 1, 1998. =Battle of Leyte Gulf= On 14 October 1944 she sortied from Seeadler Harbor, Admiralty Islands with Saginaw Bay en route to Leyte Gulf for the first step in the liberation of the Philippines. The two escort carriers rendezvoused with \\"Taffy 2\\" for \\"A-Day\\" operations, and made forty air sorties during the landing on this first day. That night after being detached from the task unit, the carrier joined \\"Taffy 1\\", which had been suffering air attacks. From 21 October through 24 October Petrof Bay launched Air Support Groups. On 24 October, contact reports accumulated describing major units of the Japanese fleet moving out to fight what was to be the Battle for Leyte Gulf. The escort carriers were in three units: \\"Taffy 3\\" (Task Unit 77.4.3), east of the southern portion of Samar; \\"Taffy 2\\" (Task Unit 77.4.2), just south of that position; and \\"Taffy 1\\" (Task Unit 77.4.1) with Petrof Bay, south of \\"Taffy 2\\" and east of Surigao Island. The Japanese Central Force, which had earlier been sighted and attacked by aircraft in the Sibuyan Sea, and which was thought to be withdrawing, had slipped through San Bernardino Strait under cover of darkness, and had steamed south toward the eastern entrance to Leyte Gulf. At 06:47, Taffy 3 reported that they were being attacked by heavy units of the Japanese fleet and land-based aircraft. Two special strikes from Petrof Bay joined in the air attack against these enemy ships. Four General Motors FM-2 Wildcats and six Grumman TBM Avengers were launched at 07:24 to join a 05:52 launch of four fighters redirected to attack the Japanese surface ships. At 07:29, radar reported six Japanese Mitsubishi A6M Zeros closing on the formation. The ship went to General Quarters and so remained for the next 108 hours. Anti-aircraft guns shot down two planes, but one of the survivors crashed into the flight deck of , another crashed into , and another narrowly missed . A Yokosuka D4Y \\"Judy\\" then strafed Petrof Bay and narrowly missed with a bomb that failed to explode. Santee was hit by a torpedo a few minutes later. Meanwhile, Petrof Bays planes hit the enemy while Taffy 3 was actually under attack. The Wildcats made strafing attacks while the Avengers launched torpedoes. During the two strikes, her pilots claimed one probable hit on the battleship , two probable hits on the battleship , two on the battleship and one on an unidentified cruiser, plus strafing runs on Yamato, the cruisers, and destroyers. Wildcats without enough fuel to return to Petrof Bay landed at Tacloban airfield where they received some friendly fire. Surviving Avengers landed on of Taffy 3 and of Taffy 2 with less than ten gallons of fuel remaining. Only one torpedo plane and two fighters returned to Petrof Bay. Petrof Bay launched a final strike at 15:30 to search for and attack the enemy then in retreat. After rendezvousing with other aircraft from the escort carriers, the flight proceeded to San Bernardino Strait where it found and attacked a cruiser of the , scoring two torpedo hits and one probable hit. These planes also landed at Tacloban Airfield when their fuel was inadequate to return to Petrof Bay. At 22:32, one of the destroyers in the screen had a sound contact. A 90-degree emergency turn was made and almost immediately thereafter two torpedoes straddled Petrof Bay, one on the port and the other passing under the overhang on the starboard side. The destroyer escort attacked with depth charges and was believed successful in destroying the submarine. On 26 October, the only remaining Japanese force within range of the escort carrier's aircraft was one light cruiser and four destroyers sighted in the Visayan Sea. Petrof Bay launched its only two remaining Avengers to participate in a strike against the five ships. One plane scored a hit with a semi-armor-piercing bomb and a near miss on the cruiser and strafed a destroyer which caught on fire and blew up. Suwanee was crashed into by another Zero at noon; and four Japanese aircraft started suicide runs on Petrof Bay from astern. The first aircraft exploded in mid-air from a hit from the gun aided by gunfire from other ships. The second turned to starboard, smoking, and withdrew. The third aircraft looped into the clouds, came straight down, missed and hit the water twenty feet in front of the bridge. The aircraft exploded as it hit the water, drenching the ship with gas. The fourth Japanese aircraft dove straight for the flight deck, its tail and wing were shot off as it fell aft of the fantail. During the night of 28 October Petrof Bay retired to the fueling area. That night the ship returned to rendezvous with Taffy 2, TG 77.2 and TG 77.3, and, in company with them, proceeded to Manus Island. All VC-76 aircrew were recovered. The squadron logged 15,000 hours of flight time through eight months of combat without a single personnel loss, while pilots were awarded seventeen Navy Crosses. Captain Kane also received a Navy Cross. Next, Petrof Bay, as a part of Task Unit 77.4.5, departed for the traffic lanes leading to Leyte 19 November arriving in the area 23 November. In mid-January 1945, the ship was detached from Task Group 77.3 and ordered to report for duty to Task Group 77.4, to prevent runs being made by the enemy from and into Manila. Direct support was furnished 29‚Äì30 January for the landings in the San Narciso and San Antonio areas. =Iwo Jima= With the reconquest of Luzon well underway, Petrof Bay departed for Ulithi. The fortress island of Iwo Jima stood in the path of the advancing Americans, and was needed as a base for fighter escorts for the B‚Äì29 raids on Tokyo and the Japanese Empire. After being in port for only five days, Petrof Bay departed the Ulithi lagoon, underway for Iwo Jima. On 15 February 1945, she arrived at the objective area in company with Task Group 52.19, the Advance Movement Group. As the battleships, cruisers and destroyers began shelling the island, aircraft from the escort carriers began strafing and bombing attacks. The troop transports arrived 18 February, and the Marines established a beachhead the next day. Aircraft from Petrof Bay supported these landings and furnished the troops with air support during the operation, making 786 air sorties. By 7 March, the airstrip on Iwo Jima was fully operational and the ship was ordered to retire to Ulithi via Guam. Iwo Jima was the last operation for the ship's original squadron, VC‚Äì76, and at Guam they were disembarked and Composite Squadron 93 (VC‚Äì93) embarked on 10 March. =Okinawa= As a part of Task Unit 52.1.2 the ship departed 21 March 1945, escorting TG 54.1, Fire Support Group, to furnish air cover and air support in the invasion and capture of Okinawa. As Marines landed on Kerama Retto, Petrof Bay's new squadron first saw combat during strikes supporting the operation. Anti-aircraft fire was exceptionally heavy and accurate. The day before the landings on Okinawa the escort carrier's aircraft supported landings on Kiese Shima. Thereafter, she launched daily strike groups, patrols and special missions. \\"L\\" Day was 1 April, Easter Sunday, and the landings on Okinawa were made at 08:30 with slight opposition. Aircraft from Petrof Bay preceded the troops. The unit was ordered to attack and neutralize Sakishima Gunto 13 April, and the first strike was launched from . Heavy anti-aircraft fire was encountered and two aircraft were shot down, but the pilots rescued. On 16 April the formation was back southeast of Okinawa. During the period from 9 May until 26 May, the ship furnished direct air support, on-target air and anti-submarine patrol. During the Okinawa operation Petrof Bays combat air patrol shot down 17 enemy aircraft. On 26 May, Petrof Bay departed for Guam, where she arrived and entered Apra Harbor on 30 May. VC-93 was disembarked and Composite Squadron 90 (VC-90) embarked for transportation to Pearl Harbor. On 19 June, Petrof Bay moored at the Naval Operating Base, Terminal Island, San Pedro, California, for a general overhaul. She was undergoing the overhaul August 6, 1945 when the first atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima and remained in overhaul on August 9, 1945 when the second atomic bomb was dropped on Nagasaki. Postwar Petrof Bay sailed for Pearl Harbor on 13 August 1945. Two days later Japan accepted the terms of the Potsdam Declaration. The carrier arrived 20 August, took VC-20 aboard for qualifying exercises in local seas, replaced VC-20 with VC-4, and sailed for Tokyo Bay 29 August by way of Eniwetok and Saipan. Flight operations continued, consisting of scouting and anti-submarine patrols with the last flight, a TBM Avenger, landing at 16:28 on 10 September off Saipan. The ship arrived at Saipan on 11 September, did not continue to Tokyo Bay, and departed for Pearl Harbor on 25 September with 104 members of VC-7 and other military personnel aboard as passengers. All aircraft were unloaded at Pearl Harbor, ending Petrof Bays career as a warship. The 123 men of VPB-152 and others were boarded as passengers. She departed 5 October, arrived in San Francisco 11 October, disembarking hundreds of veteran passengers including her operational squadron, VC-4. On 18 October she made a round trip to Pearl Harbor to pick up more veterans, returning 31 October. Alterations were made at Hunters Point to accommodate more passengers and she departed 17 November for Eniwetok where she loaded 1,062 veterans, followed by 153 at Kwajalein. She arrived in San Francisco 6 December, departed for Guam 12 December, embarked 944 veterans, and arrived at San Pedro on 18 January 1946. Departing San Pedro on 29 January 1946, she touched at San Diego, transited the Panama Canal, and steamed up the eastern seaboard to Norfolk, Virginia, arriving 15 February. From there she headed northward again, and made her final mooring under her own power at Boston, Massachusetts on 23 February. She was decommissioned and placed in the Boston Group of the Atlantic Reserve Fleet on 31 July 1955, reclassified CVU‚Äì80 12 June 1955, struck from the Navy Vessel Register 27 June 1958. The ship was sold to J. Berkurt on 30 July 1959, and subsequently scrapped. Awards Petrof Bay received five battle stars and a Presidential Unit Citation for World War II service.

The carrier entered service in 1943 and participated in a series of operations in the South Pacific including the Philippines campaign, the Battle off Samar and the Battle of Okinawa. During the Okinawa battle, Natoma Bay was struck by a Japanese aircraft and damaged and ended the ship's participation in the war. Once repaired, Natoma Bay was assigned to Operation Magic Carpet, the return of American soldiers from the Pacific theatre. Following the completion of the operation the escort carrier was decommissioned in 1946 and placed in reserve. In 1959, Natoma Bay was sold for scrap. Construction and career She was laid down as Begum (MC hull 1099), on 17 January 1943, by the Kaiser Shipbuilding Co., Inc., Vancouver, Washington, under Maritime Commission contract, named Natoma Bay on 22 January 1943, after a bayUSGS Board of Geographic Names, Natoma Bay in the Graham Islands off the southwest coast of Alaska; launched on 20 July 1943; sponsored by Lady Halifax, wife of the United Kingdom's ambassador to the United States; and commissioned on 14 October 1943, Captain Harold L. Meadow in command. =1943-1944= After her shakedown cruise off the California coast, Natoma Bay performed aircraft and personnel ferrying duties between San Diego and Hawaii for Commander Fleet Air, West Coast, until 3 January 1944. Then, with squadron VC-63 embarked, she departed San Diego for Pearl Harbor, reporting to ComCarDiv 24, 5th Amphibious Force, on 10 January. On 23 January she sortied with TG 51.2 for the invasion of the Marshalls. Between 31 January and 7 February, as positions on Majuro Atoll were consolidated, CVE‚Äì62 furnished anti-submarine and combat air patrols (CAPs) and area searches for the attack force. On 8 February, she extended her operations to Wotje and Maloelap, alternating for the remainder of the month between those islands and Majuro. Departing Majuro on 7 March, Natoma Bay reached Espiritu Santo on the 12th. Three days later she joined TF 37 for air strikes and surface bombardments against Kavieng, New Ireland, 19 March20 March. She then cruised to the north of the Solomons and New Ireland, providing air cover for convoys to and from Emirau where an air base and a limited naval base were being established. During the next three weeks, she continued to cruise in the Solomons-Bismarck Archipelago area in support of the protracted offensive to neutralize the latter and seal off the Japanese fortress at Rabaul. On 19 April she rendezvoused with TF 78 and then steamed toward New Guinea where her planes pounded enemy positions in support of a three pronged attack by Allied land and naval forces against Aitape, Hollandia (currently known as Jayapura), and Tanahmerah Bay, 22 April. During and after the landings, Natoma Bay launched protective air patrols and sent fighters and bombers to destroy Japanese installations in the Aitape area. Returning to Manus for engine repairs, 28 April, she sailed 7 May for Pearl Harbor, arriving 18 May. After loading 37 P-47D Thunderbolt fighters of the Army Air Forces' 19th Fighter Squadron, 318th Fighter Group, Natoma Bay departed Pearl Harbor 5 June en route to the Marianas. Steaming via Eniwetok, she arrived off Saipan on 19 June and was ordered to retire eastward until the Battle of the Philippine Sea was decided. On the 22nd she steamed westward and commenced catapulting the Army planes toward their destination, Aslito Air Field, Saipan. She dispatched 25 on the 22nd and the remainder early on the 23rd, then retired to a refueling area 45 miles east of Saipan. There the formation came under enemy air attack. Four Aichi \\"Val\\" dive bombers dropped their payloads, but no hits were scored; intensive anti-aircraft fire prevented damage to the main targets, Natoma Bay and Manila Bay. The latter ship, with Army fighters still on board, then catapulted those aircraft to provide protective CAP until the radar screens were clear of contacts. Natoma Bay returned to Eniwetok, 27 June, embarked casualties, and sailed for San Diego, arriving 16 July for availability, logistics and ferry duty. Between 5 September and 14 September she conducted qualification and training exercises for VC-81 (Composite Squadron 81) off Pearl Harbor, and on the 15th, got under way for Manus as a unit of the 3rd Fleet. On 3 October she reached Seeadler Harbor and began final preparations for the invasion of the Philippines. Assigned to the Escort Carrier Group (TG 77.4), Natoma Bay departed the Admiralties, 12 October, for waters east of the Philippines. After weathering stormy seas, 14‚Äì17 October, she commenced offensive flight operations on the 18th. Prior to the invasion, her planes bombed Japanese positions and conducted strafing runs against enemy vehicles and small craft on and around Leyte and Negros. During the amphibious assault on the 20th, she launched ground support, spotting, and air cover strikes. Then, during the critical days following the landings, she sent bombers and fighters to support the ground forces. On 25 October, as Natoma Bay, flagship of Rear Admiral Stump, CTU 77.4.2 (\\"Taffy 2\\"), cruised off the eastern entrance to Leyte Gulf, the Japanese launched a tri-force offensive to drive the Allies from Leyte, and from the Philippines. During the early morning hours, the enemy's Southern Force was soundly defeated in Surigao Strait. Surviving Japanese ships retreated into the Mindanao Sea pursued by destroyers, PT boats, and after sunrise, by carrier based aircraft. At 06:58, \\"Taffy 3\\", (6 CVEs, 3 DDs, and 4 DEs) cruising off Samar under Rear Admiral C. Sprague, was attacked by the vastly more powerful Japanese Center Force (4 BBs, 6 CAs, 2 CLs, 11 DDs) under Admiral Kurita. At 07:01, having ordered all operational planes launched, Adm. Sprague requested any available assistance. Admiral Ozawa's Northern Force, however, had already accomplished its mission ‚Äî Admiral Halsey's TF 38 had been drawn off to the north. The cruisers and battleships under Admiral Oldendorf were replenishing after their battle in Surigao Strait. Help could only come from the south. At 07:02, \\"Taffy 2\\", 20 miles to the south-south-east, responded and by 07:08 all available planes were en route. Those already dispatched on routine missions were recalled. In a running battle which ensued, the determination of self-sacrificing destroyers and destroyer escorts of \\"Taffy 3\\" and fighters and bombers of the three Taffies resulted in an almost unbelievable, but necessary, victory in the Battle off Samar. Ordered not to concentrate on any particular ship, but to cripple as many as possible, planes from Natoma Bay conducted two strikes against the enemy within an hour and a half. At 09:26 a third strike, with 500 pound SAP bombs in lieu of torpedoes, was launched. At 11:18, a fourth strike was sent off to push the maneuvering enemy away from Leyte Gulf, but with neither torpedoes nor armor-piercing bombs aboard, the planes took off carrying only general-purpose bombs and depth charges. At noon, Natoma Bays fighters, launched previously for CAP, were landed, rearmed and sent up again. At 12:56 and at 15:08, the 5th and 6th strikes were launched to further pursue the enemy as it retreated toward San Bernardino Strait. Fighter planes, armed with 250-pound (113 kg) general-purpose bombs, were among those dispatched with the last strike. At the end of that fateful day's operations, TG 77.4, with \\"Taffy 3\\" bearing the brunt of the damage, had turned back the Japanese Force. Praise for the escort carrier group was unbounded. They had \\"...accomplished a task that only a large carrier task force should be expected to undertake...\\" Natoma Bays contribution to the earning of this praise included one heavy cruiser sunk, one torpedo plane shot down, and hits on one battleship, three heavy cruisers, two light cruisers and one destroyer. The following morning, 26 October, Natoma Bays planes, continuing to pound the enemy, assisted in the sinking of a light cruiser and her accompanying destroyer in the Visayan Sea and then resumed support of ground forces on Leyte. On the 27th, her fighters strafed Japanese vessels in Ormoc Bay and then swung over Samar where they downed a Kawasaki Ki-61 \\"Tony\\". A Mitsubishi G3M \\"Nell\\" was bagged on the 28th, and on 30 October the CVE sailed for Seeadler Harbor, arriving 4 November. Natoma Bay got underway for Kossol Roads 27 November and departed from there 10 December to provide air cover for the Mindoro invasion convoys as they transited the Mindanao and Sulu Seas. On the 13th, kamikazes from Negros Island attacked the formation. Eleven were shot down, but three pressed home the attack. Two were downed by anti-aircraft fire, but the third scored on the destroyer Haraden. Japanese aerial attacks continued on the 14th and Natoma Bay‚Äôs fighters added seven A6M Zeros to their total. During and after the Mindoro landings, 15 December, Natoma Bay provided air cover and ground support, protecting screening vessels from kamikazes and strafing Japanese positions. After recovering her planes on the 16th, she retired to Kossol Roads, thence to Manus, returning to the Palaus at the end of the month. =1945= On 1 January 1945, Natoma Bay, reassigned to CARDIV 25, sortied once again with ships of an attack force, the target this time, Luzon. There, after battling enemy nuisance and suicide raiders en route, she, with five other CVEs, provided air cover for the Bombardment and Fire Support Group prior to the landings, and direct air support ahead of the amphibious troops after the assault in the San Fabian area. Between the 10th and the 17th her continuous direct air support missions resulted in the damage and destruction of bridges, fuel and ammunition dumps, barracks, roads and vehicles. After replenishment at Mindoro, Natoma Bay cruised west of Mindoro until the 29th. She then moved into position to support amphibious landings on the west coast of Zambales Province and at Subic Bay, remaining there until 1 February. Her task group, 77.4, then retired, reaching Ulithi on the 5th. She sortied 10 February with TU 52.2.1, to provide air cover en route to and during the Iwo Jima assault. Between the 16th and the 19th, her planes flew 123 sorties to prepare the way for the assault marines. On D-day, 19 February, 36 sorties provided direct support, while another 16 provided CAP cover. After the 19th, Natoma Bay expanded her duties to include antisubmarine and air coordinator missions, and in March, to anti-shipping assignments. Natoma Bay departed the Volcano-Bonin area 8 March, entering Ulithi Lagoon on the 11th. There squadron VC-9 replaced VC-81 and by the 21st, was ready for Natoma Bays next operation, Okinawa. With TU 52.1.1, the escort carrier provided air cover for the pre-invasion bombardment and Occupation of Kerama Retto, 24 March1 April. She then shifted her attention to Okinawa itself. For the next three months except for brief repair periods, her planes bombed and strafed strategic and tactical targets; flew observation and spotting, photographic and propaganda missions; dropped provisions and munitions in advance areas; and conducted combat air and anti-submarine patrols. At 06:35, 7 June, after having maneuvered through typhoon weather, Natoma Bay was closed by a Zero, broad on the port quarter and low on the water. Changing course, it came in over the stern, fired incendiary ammunition at the bridge, and on reaching the island structure, nosed over and crashed the flight deck. The engine, propeller and a bomb tore a hole in the flight deck, , while the explosion of the bomb damaged the deck of the forecastle and the anchor windlass beyond repair and ignited a nearby fighter. Three of Natoma Bays crew and one officer of VC‚Äì9 were wounded. One ship's officer was killed. A second Zero was splashed by the ship's port batteries. The damage control party immediately extinguished the blaze and set about emergency repairs. The next strike was cancelled, but the following one, against Miayako Shima, took place as scheduled at 10:30. =Post-war activities= On 20 June the escort carrier headed for Guam for partial repairs, then continued on to the United States. By 19 August, when she arrived in San Diego, the war was over. During September and October she underwent repairs, alterations and general overhaul, after which she reported for duty as a \\"Magic Carpet\\" transport. During November and early December she carried servicemen from the Philippines to California, then after detachment, 29 December, she was transferred to the Atlantic Reserve Fleet. =Decommissioning and disposal= Reporting 20 February 1946, she decommissioned 20 May, berthing at Norfolk. In October 1949, she was reassigned to the Boston Reserve Group. Reclassified CVU‚Äì62 on 12 June 1955, she was declared unfit for further service in 1958 and her name was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 1 September. She was sold on 30 July 1959 for scrap to the Japanese. Awards Natoma Bay earned seven battle stars for her World War II service on the Asiatic-Pacific theater medal and two bronze stars on the Philippine Liberation medal. Natoma Bay also earned a Presidential Unit Citation, taking part in 13 operations in World War II, not including the Battle of Leyte Gulf.Notice of Separation from US Naval Service, #1712, serial 607-82-16  References  * External links * * Natoma Bay Logbook Project Category:Casablanca-class escort carriers Category:World War II escort aircraft carriers of the United States Category:Ships built in Vancouver, Washington Category:1943 ships ","title":"USS Natoma Bay"},{"id":"554033","text":"The Fraser Institute is a Canadian public policy think tank and registered charity.

History The Fraser Institute was founded in 1974 by Michael Walker, an economist from the University of Western Ontario, and businessman T. Patrick Boyle, then a vice-president of MacMillan Bloedel. It obtained charitable status in Canada on October 22, 1974, and in the United States in 1978.The Fraser Institute at 30: A Retrospective Fraser Institute Its stated mission is \\"to measure, study, and communicate the impact of competitive markets and government intervention on the welfare of individuals.\\"Mission Fraser Institute The institute is named after the Fraser River. Sir Antony Fisher, previously instrumental in setting up the UK's Institute of Economic Affairs, was appointed acting director in 1975, until Walker became executive director in 1977. In its first full year of operation, 1975, the institute reported revenues of $421,389. In 1988, revenues exceed $1 million, and in 2003, $6 million. Political stance The Fraser Institute describes itself as \\"an independent international research and educational organization\\",Who We Are Fraser Institute and envisions \\"a free and prosperous world where individuals benefit from greater choice, competitive markets, and personal responsibility\\". Forbes has referred to the think tank as libertarian. The New York Times has described the institute as libertarianWith Interest: Turning the tables on reform The New York Times and conservative. The Calgary Herald called it conservative, Langley Times classified it as right-of-center libertarian. Funding As a registered charity with the Canada Revenue Agency, the institute files annual registered charity information returns. In 2010, the institute reported having $4.5 million CAD in assets and $10.8 million in annual revenue. The institute depends on contributions from individuals, corporations, and foundations. It does not accept government grants or payments for research, however individual donors may claim tax credits for donations and corporate donors may claim tax deductions.Funding Overview Fraser Institute The institute has received donations of hundreds of thousands of dollars from foundations controlled by Charles and David Koch, with total donations estimated to be approximately $765,000 from 2006 to 2016. It also received US$120,000 from ExxonMobil in the 2003 to 2004 fiscal period. In 2016, it received a $5 million donation from Peter Munk, a Canadian businessman.Fraser Institute, 2016 Annual Report. Retrieved 15 Sept 2017. https://www.fraserinstitute.org/sites/default/files/fraser- institute-2016-annual-report.pdf In 2012, the Vancouver Observer reported that the Fraser Institute had \\"received over $4.3 million in the last decade from eight major American foundations including the most powerful players in oil and pharmaceuticals\\". According to the article, \\"The Fraser Institute received $1.7 million from 'sources outside Canada' in one year alone, according to the group's 2010 Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) return.

The institute has also published regional and sub-national reports ranking the economic freedom of North America, Latin America, the Arab World, and the Francophonie. These reports are distributed worldwide through the Economic Freedom Network, a global network of 80 think-tanks. *Human Freedom Index: Along with the Cato Institute and the Liberales Institut at the Friedrich Naumann Foundation for Freedom, the Fraser Institute publishes annual Human Freedom Index, which presents the state of human freedom in the world based on a broad measure of 76 distinct indicators that encompasses personal, civil, and economic freedom. The index presents a broad measure of human freedom, understood as the absence of coercive constraint. The index covers the following areas: Rule of Law, Security and Safety, Movement, Religion, Association, Assembly, and Civil Society, Expression, Relationships, Size of Government, Legal System and Property Rights, Access to Sound Money, Freedom to Trade Internationally, and Regulation of Credit, Labor, and Business. The Human Freedom Index was created in 2015, covering 152 countries for years 2008, 2010, 2011 and 2012. In January 2016 data for 2013 was added, covering 157 countries. *Waiting Your Turn: Wait Times for Health Care in Canada is the institute's annual report on hospital waiting times in Canada, based on a nationwide survey of physicians and health care practitioners. The twentieth annual survey, released December 2010, found that the total waiting time between referral from a general practitioner and delivery of elective treatment by a specialist, averaged across 12 specialties and 10 provinces surveyed, had risen from 16.1 weeks in 2009 to 18.2 weeks in 2010. *Survey of Mining Companies: Published annually, the global Survey of Mining Companies ranks the investment climates of mining jurisdictions around the world, based on the opinions of mining industry executives and managers. *Global Petroleum Survey: An annual survey of petroleum executives regarding barriers to investment in oil- and gas-producing regions around the world. *Canadian Provincial Investment Climate: A series of reports measuring the extent to which Canadian provinces embrace public policies that contribute to, and sustain, positive investment climates. *Firearms reports. The Fraser Institute issued a number of articles and statements opposing Canadian gun control laws, including firearms registry. *School Report Cards: Every year, the institute publishes a series of School Report Cards ranking the academic performance of schools in British Columbia, Alberta, Ontario, Quebec, and Washington state based on the publicly available results of standardized testing mandated and administered by the provinces.School Report Cards Fraser Institute The website www.compareschoolrankings.org allows anyone to compare up to five schools at once, based on a variety of performance indicators.Compare School Rankings Fraser Institute *Tax Freedom Day: The institute's annual Tax Freedom Day report calculates the day the average Canadian family has paid off the total tax bill and royalties imposed on them and corporations by all levels of government. In 2016, Tax Freedom Day was June 7 with $45,167 (42.9 per cent of income) having been collected per family.Canadians Celebrate Tax Freedom Day on June 7, 2016 Fraser Institute The institute also offers a personal Tax Freedom Day calculator.Personal Tax Freedom Day Calculator Fraser Institute * The institute publishes three magazines: Fraser Forum, a bi-monthly review of public policy in Canada; Perspectives, a French-language review of public policy in Quebec and la Francophonie; and Canadian Student Review, a look at current affairs written for students, by students.Magazines Fraser Institute * In March 2010, the institute released Did Government Stimulus Fuel Economic Growth in Canada? An Analysis of Statistics Canada Data, a report critical of the Harper government's Economic Action Plan, concluding that the stimulus package did not have a material impact on Canada's economic turnaround in the latter half of 2009. Education programs The institute periodically hosts free seminars across Canada for students, teachers, and journalists, focusing on key economic concepts and timely issues in public policy.Education Programs Fraser Institute In 2010, the institute hosted eight one-day student seminars, attracting more than 775 participants. The Fraser Institute also offers an internship program, to which more than 431 individuals applied in 2010.

From 1979 to 1991, the institute's senior economist was Walter Block.Walter Block curriculum vitae on Walterblock.com, p. 2. Former Alberta Wildrose Party leader, now talk show host Danielle Smith. Controversies According to an article published in CBC News Online, some people allege that Michael Walker helped set up the institute after he received financial backing from forestry giant MacMillan Bloedel, largely to counter British Columbia's NDP government,CBC News Indepth: Fraser Institute then led by premier Dave Barrett. In late 1997, the institute set up a research program emulating the UK's Social Affairs Unit, called the Social Affairs Centre. Its founding director was Patrick Basham. The program's funding came from Rothmans International and Philip Morris. When Rothmans was bought by British American Tobacco (BAT) in 1999, its funding ended, and in 2000 the institute wrote to BAT asking for $50,000 per year, to be split between the Social Affairs Centre and the Centre for Risk and Regulation. The letter highlighted the institute's 1999 publication Passive Smoke: The EPA's Betrayal of Science and Policy,John Luik and Gio Batta Gori (1999), Passive Smoke: The EPA's Betrayal of Science and Policy , Vancouver: Fraser Institute \\"which highlighted the absence of any scientific evidence for linking cancer with second-hand smoke [and] received widespread media coverage both in Canada and the United States\\".Fraser Institute letter of 28 January 2000 to British American Tobacco chairman Martin Broughton, Letter to Martin Broughton regarding research program in emulation of the social affairs unit, disclosed via Legacy Tobacco Documents Library. At this time the CEO of BAT's Canadian subsidiary, Imasco, was also on the Fraser Institute's board of trustees.Donald Gutstein, rabble.ca, 14 October 2009, Following the money: The Fraser Institute‚Äôs tobacco papers The Fraser Institute ceased disclosing its sources of corporate funding in the 1980s. In 1999, the Fraser Institute was criticized by health professionals and scientists for sponsoring two conferences on the tobacco industry entitled Junk Science, Junk Policy? Managing Risk and Regulation and Should Government Butt Out? The Pros and Cons of Tobacco Regulation. Critics charged the institute was associating itself with the tobacco industry's many attempts to discredit authentic scientific work.

She was named after Nehenta Bay, located within Gravina Island. Built for service during World War II, the ship was launched in November 1943, and commissioned in January 1944, and served in support of the Mariana and Palau Islands campaign and the Battle of Okinawa. Postwar, she participated in Operation Magic Carpet. She was decommissioned in May 1946, when she was mothballed in the Atlantic Reserve Fleet. Ultimately, she was sold for scrapping in June 1960. Design and description A profile of the design of , which was shared with all Casablanca-class escort carriers. Nehenta Bay was a Casablanca-class escort carrier, the most numerous type of aircraft carriers ever built, and designed specifically to be mass-produced using prefabricated sections, in order to replace heavy early war losses. Standardized with her sister ships, she was long overall, had a beam of , and a draft of . She displaced standard, with a full load. She had a long hangar deck and a long flight deck. She was powered with two Skinner Unaflow reciprocating steam engines, which drove two shafts, providing , thus enabling her to make . The ship had a cruising range of at a speed of . Her compact size necessitated the installment of an aircraft catapult at her bow, and there were two aircraft elevators to facilitate movement of aircraft between the flight and hangar deck: one each fore and aft. One /38 caliber dual-purpose gun was mounted on the stern. Anti- aircraft defense was provided by eight Bofors anti-aircraft guns in single mounts, as well as twelve Oerlikon cannons, which were mounted around the perimeter of the deck. By the end of the war, Casablanca-class carriers had been modified to carry thirty 20-mm cannons, and the amount of 40-mm guns had been doubled to sixteen, by putting them into twin mounts. These modifications were in response to increasing casualties due to kamikaze attacks. Casablanca- class escort carriers were designed to carry 27 aircraft, but the hangar deck could accommodate more. Construction The escort carrier was laid down on 20 July 1943, under a Maritime Commission contract, MC hull 1111, by Kaiser Shipbuilding Company, Vancouver, Washington. She was named Nehenta Bay, after a bay in Gravina Island, as part of a tradition which named escort carriers after bays or sounds in Alaska. She was launched on 28 November 1943; sponsored by Mrs. Robert H. Lewis; transferred to the United States Navy and commissioned on 3 January 1944, with Captain Horace Bushnell Butterfield in command. Service history Nehenta Bay underway at sea, transporting aircraft, circa 1945. Nehenta Bay underway at sea in 1945. She is painted in Camouflage Measure 33, Design 10A. Upon being commissioned, Nehenta Bay underwent a shakedown cruise down the West Coast to San Francisco. She then underwent a transport mission to Pearl Harbor on 6 February, carrying a load of replacement aircraft and military personnel. She arrived at Pearl Harbor on 12 February, where she took on a load of damaged planes which required repairs. She arrived at San Diego on 21 February, where she unloaded her cargo. After training exercises off the Southern California coast, she made another transport run to Hawaii on 18 March. After stopping at Hawaii, she proceeded westwards to Majuro, arriving there on 7 April. She then returned to San Diego, stopping at Pearl Harbor along the way, and arriving on 27 April, carrying wounded military personnel, as well as nonfunctional aircraft. Nehenta Bay then conducted additional exercises off the West Coast, and steamed for Hawaii, where additional combat readiness training ensued. After finishing her exercises, she left Pearl Harbor on 18 June, bound for the Mariana Islands, in support of the Mariana and Palau Islands campaign. She joined Task Group 52.14, under the command of Rear Admiral Gerald F. Bogan. With Composite Squadron 11 (VC-11) on-board, she was based on newly-captured Enewetak Atoll. There, her aircraft conducted antisubmarine patrols, and provided close air support covering the Battle of Tinian. Notably, her aircraft strafed Tinian on 5 and 7 July, attacking gun emplacements and a sugar refinery. She returned to Enewetak on 16 July to refuel and replenish. She then joined the then (later renamed the St. Lo), along with twelve destroyer escorts, in conducting antisubmarine patrols off Guam and Saipan. In the meantime, she also launched strikes in support of the ongoing Battle of Saipan. After finishing her patrol, she became a replenishment carrier, supporting the Third Fleet's frontline Fast Carrier Task Force as part of Task Group 30.8, the Fleet Oiler and Transport Carrier Group. She escorted vulnerable fleet oilers as they proceeded to the frontlines, protecting them from Japanese submarines and aircraft. Escort carriers such as Nehenta Bay enabled the frontline carriers to replace battle losses, and to stay at sea for longer durations of time. She was based on Manus and Ulithi, where she received supplies and replacement aircraft. On 18 December, as part of Task Group 30.8.12, she braved Typhoon Cobra. =Typhoon Cobra= The Third Fleet had been operating against positions on Luzon since 14 December, but its escorting destroyers ran low on fuel. As a result, the fleet retired to the east to refuel, and to receive replacement aircraft from Task Group 30.8. She rendezvoused with the Third Fleet about east of Luzon early on 17 December. The location had been chosen because it lay out of range of Japanese fighters, but it also happened to lie within Typhoon Alley, where many Pacific tropical cyclones transited. As the escort carriers and the Third Fleet met, Typhoon Cobra began to bear down. At 1:00 in the night, fueling operations were attempted with the destroyers, although heavy winds and listing seas complicated the matter. At the same time, barometers on-board the ships began to drop, and tropical storm force winds were recorded. A radar image of Typhoon Cobra, 18 December 1944. As the weather continued to deteriorate, Admiral William Halsey Jr. ordered fueling operations suspended at 13:10, just after noon. He ordered his fleet to move to the next morning's planned rendezvous spot, approximately northwest, and comfortably safe from the typhoon's impacts. Two hours later, he instead ordered his fleet to proceed due southwards, from where the fleet was located. This brought the fleet directly into the typhoon's core. To make matters worse for the Third Fleet, Halsey ordered the fleet to proceed northwards at 22:20, putting the fleet in the quadrant of the typhoon with the highest winds. Blurry data and observations meant that command had little idea of where the typhoon actually was, with some weather maps pinning the typhoon's center some away, even whilst the fleet sailed directly into the eye. Attached to the Third Fleet, Nehenta Bay followed. At 7:00, on the morning of 18 December, the fleet was inescapably trapped in the typhoon's path. Conflicting orders meant that some of the destroyers attempted to do some fueling during the morning, even as waves with an estimated height of pounded the task force. At 7:22, Nehenta Bay came to course at 60¬∞, along with and . As Nehenta Bay struggled to maintain her course, massive waves crested over her flight deck. Captain Butterfield radioed to Vice Admiral John S. McCain Sr. that Nehenta Bay could not continue on her given path, and asked for permission to change course. At 7:52, McCain replied to the affirmative, and Nehenta Bay turned due south. At the time, she was rolling at about 30¬∞ to 37¬∞, a dangerous angle for an aircraft carrier. Steering control was momentarily lost due to the typhoon, but it was quickly regained. To maintain steerageway, she increased her speed to , before Butterfield decided that it would be easier to change the ship on a northwesterly heading. This change in course stabilized Nehenta Bay. Her rolls steadied to a bit less than 30¬∞, but her crew still had to fight to stay in control against heavy seas and gusty winds. A full rudder was required to keep her bow aligned against gusts of up to . Eventually, the winds died down, and Nehenta Bay emerged from the storm with relatively little damage. Only three planes on her flight deck had been carried overboard, with another blown loose and stuck on a catwalk. The 20-mm cannon mounted on said catwalk had been ejected from the carrier as a result of the collision. There was minor damage on the flight deck, but her loss in cargo and hull integrity was little compared to her fellow ships of Task Group 30.8. =Battle of Okinawa= A FM-2 Wildcat fighter of Composite Squadron 11 (VC-11) slams into a barricade during flight operations onboard Nehenta Bay, 21 January 1945. She continued her replenishment duties after the typhoon, and on 27 December, Captain Edward Orrick McDonnell took over command of the vessel. On 12 January 1945, her aircraft contingent saw some action. At the time, she was providing cover and support for the vulnerable fleet oilers. At 7:10 in the morning, an Aichi E13A reconnaissance seaplane was detected by radar about away from Nehenta Bay. A squadron of fighters was launched in response to the threat, and the Japanese plane was engaged by fighters away from the task group. After an unsuccessful attempt to disengage, the seaplane spiraled into the ocean. On 17 January, whilst Nehenta Bay was operating in the South China Sea, she once again suffered damage as a result of the weather. Throughout the day, refueling operations had been hampered by heavy surf and wind. At around 19:30, heavy waves, up to high, started cresting over the flight deck. Some steel supports near her bow buckled under the waves, and the flight deck bent down and sank, rendering the aircraft catapult inoperational. She continued to launch replacement aircraft, although her duties were cut back. She was discharged from her Task Group, and returned to San Diego on 19 February for overhaul and repairs. She then proceeded for Hawaii, where training exercises were conducted. She then briefly served as a training carrier, conducting pilot qualifications off of Guam, before arriving at Ulithi on 9 May, where she prepared to begin operations in support of the landings on Okinawa. She joined Task Unit 52.1 under Rear Admiral Calvin T. Durgin in May, with Composite Squadron 8 (VC-8) onboard. She then began flying missions and making strikes as U.S. forces advanced down the island. During this period, her task group came under frequent kamikaze attacks, most notably on 7 June, when two carriers were struck by aircraft. After finishing her duties, she once again served as a replenishment carrier until the end of the war, guarding fleet oilers as they transited towards the Fast Carrier Task Force, which was launching strikes against the Japanese home islands. =Post-war= She was en route to the Aleutian Islands when the Japanese surrender was announced on 15 August. On 31 August, Nehenta Bay sailed to Mutsu Bay in support of the Occupation of Japan. There, she watched on as Vice Admiral Frank Jack Fletcher accepted the formal surrender of Japanese forces in northern Honshu and Hokkaido on 6 September. Her aircraft contingent dropped supplies to prisoners of war, and conducted patrols as U.S. forces landed throughout the Japanese islands. She returned to Pearl Harbor on 24 September, where she disembarked her aircraft squadron, aviation equipment, and excess gasoline. She then joined the Operation Magic Carpet fleet, which repatriated U.S. servicemen from around the Pacific. She first made a run to the Marshall Islands on 30 September, repatriating them to San Francisco in mid-October. She then made another run to the Philippines throughout November, returning to the West Coast on 27 November. She was then discharged from the Magic Carpet fleet, and steamed for Boston, passing through the Panama Canal. She arrived on 31 January 1946, whereupon inactivation work was conducted. She was decommissioned on 15 May, and mothballed as part of the Atlantic Reserve Fleet. Berthed at the East Boston Naval Annex, she suffered extensive damage on 31 August 1954 as a result of Hurricane Carol, which toppled a dockyard crane onto her flight deck. She was redesignated as a utility aircraft carrier, CVU-74, on 12 June 1955. She was once again redesignated, this time as an aircraft transport, AKV-24, on 7 May 1959. She was struck from the Navy list on 1 April 1960, and sold on 29 June 1960 to Coalmarket Inc. for scrapping. She was ultimately broken up in Hong Kong during June 1960. She received seven battle stars for her World War II service.

She was converted from a Maritime Commission hull (MC hull 1104) built by the Kaiser Shipbuilding Company of Vancouver, Washington. Her keel was laid on 19 March 1943. Soon thereafter, she was assigned the first of her three names, Emperor. After being designated an auxiliary aircraft carrier, ACV-67, she was renamed Nassuk Bay on 28 June 1943. On 15 July, she was redesignated an escort carrier, CVE-67. She was launched on 6 October 1943 by Mrs. F. J. McKenna while still bearing the name Nassuk Bay. One month later, she received her third and final name, Solomons, and as such was commissioned on 21 November 1943, Captain M. E. Crist in command. Service history Solomons spent the next four weeks in the Astoria, Oregon-Puget Sound area undergoing post-trial shakedown, tests, and exercises. Departing Astoria on 20 December 1943, she stopped at Alameda, California, three days later and arrived at San Diego on 25 December. Following operations out of San Diego, she sailed for Pearl Harbor on 30 December. On 6 January 1944, Solomons loaded aircraft and supplies there, embarked passengers, and departed on the 9th for the U.S. west coast. USS Solomons at San Diego Arriving at San Diego on 14 January, Solomons conducted battle practice off the coast of southern California until the end of the month. She departed San Diego on 30 January bound for Norfolk, Virginia. During her approach to the Panama Canal, Solomons' planes participated in a simulated aerial attack on the canal. The carrier arrived at Balboa, Panama, on 9 February, embarked passengers, and departed for Norfolk two days later, arriving on 16 February. Loaded with planes, supplies, and aviation stores, Solomons got underway on 21 March bound for Brazil, arrived at Recife on 13 April, and reported for duty with the 4th Fleet. On the next day, she got underway for her first antisubmarine patrol. This cruise, which lasted until 30 March, and the next, from 4‚Äì20 May, proved uneventful. Departing Recife in June 1944, Solomons was soon involved in her sole U-boat engagement of the war. On 15 June, one of Solomons pilots reported contact with an enemy submarine some 50 miles from the carrier. and were immediately directed to the position of the contact. The pilot who had made the initial contact on the submarine was shot down by enemy anti-aircraft fire, but at 1654, another Solomons aircraft regained visual contact. Five other Solomons aircraft soon joined up with it, and the group commenced a series of rocket and depth charge attacks, which resulted in sinking the submarine, although with the loss of another pilot. Straub succeeded in rescuing 20 survivors, including the commanding officer. Solomons continued anti-submarine air operations until 23 June, when she returned to Recife to refuel and disembark the captured German sailors.

After one more anti- submarine patrol and a visit to Rio de Janeiro, Solomons returned to Norfolk, arriving on 24 August. She remained at that port for a month before leaving for Staten Island, New York. She docked there on 25 September. She embarked 150 Army airmen together with their P-47 Thunderbolts and departed on 6 October, bound for Casablanca, French Morocco. By 7 November, she was back in the United States, this time at Narragansett Bay, Rhode Island. Solomons spent the rest of her active service engaged in qualifying Navy and Marine pilots in carrier landings, initially off Quonset Point, Rhode Island. In January 1945, she moved to Port Everglades, Florida, and continued her carrier landing qualification assignment throughout 1945. For a week in December, she participated in an unsuccessful search for the 14 airmen of Flight 19, and the 13 from the ill-fated rescue mission. On 15 May 1946, Solomons was decommissioned at Boston Naval Shipyard and struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 5 June. Sold for scrap to the Patapsco Scrap Corp., Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, she was delivered to its agent on 22 December at Newport, Rhode Island.

Construction The escort carrier was laid down on 4 December 1943, under a Maritime Commission contract, MC hull 1124, by Kaiser Shipbuilding Company, Vancouver, Washington. She was named Steamer Bay, as part of a tradition which named escort carriers after bays or sounds in Alaska. She was launched on 26 February 1944; sponsored by Mrs. Henry S. Kendall; transferred to the United States Navy and commissioned on 4 April 1944, Captain Myron Steadman Teller in command. Service history =World War II= Two Grumman F6F Hellcats photographed on-board Steamer Bay. These aircraft were not part of her aircraft contingent, and are being transported, evident by the lack of squadron or carrier markings. The rightmost aircraft, positioned on the aircraft catapult, is a F6F-5N night- fighter variant. After being commissioned, Steamer Bay conducted trials and went on a shakedown cruise down the West Coast, before arriving at San Diego. On 14 May, she sailed for the New Hebrides, transporting Marine Air Group (MAG) 61. She arrived at Espiritu Santo on 30 May, where her cargo was unloaded. She departed on 2 June, arriving at San Diego on 20 June. On 19 July, she loaded 298 marines and 72 aircraft, and proceeded westwards for the Marshall Islands. She hence arrived at Majuro on 1 August, where she discharged her cargo. She headed for Pearl Harbor, where she was attached to the United States Third Fleet to store replacement aircraft to support the ongoing Mariana and Palau Islands campaign and the Philippines campaign. Seventy-two planes were loaded onto Steamer Bay, and she sailed for Seeadler Harbor, Manus Island, arriving on 21 August. Throughout the next two and a half months, she remained on station, providing replacement aircraft and crew for Task Group 38. After completing her duties, she returned to Pearl Harbor, where she underwent repairs and training from 15 November to 5 December. Steamer Bay departed back to Seeadler Harbor, arriving on 17 December. There, she was assigned to Task Group 77.4 (Taffy 2), commanded by Rear Admiral Felix Stump, which had previously participated in the Battle of Leyte Gulf. The task force consisted of six escort carriers and their escorts. On 1 January 1945, the task force sortied out of Seeadler Harbor, in support of the Invasion of Lingayen Gulf. En route, the escort carriers came under heavy aerial attacks. Of the six carriers within Taffy 2, was sunk by a kamikaze plane on 4 January, and and were damaged by additional kamikazes on 5 January. Steamer Bay herself narrowly missed being hit, with a kamikaze once flying dangerously close to her stern. Throughout the landings, the escort carrier task groups anchored offshore launched over 1,400 aircraft sorties in support of the operation. In the middle of operations, Taffy 2 was reformed under Rear Admiral Felix Stump, partially because of the losses and damages suffered by the escort carriers. In anticipation for possible Japanese counterattacks on American positions on Mindoro and Luzon, the task group proceeded south to operate in the waters offshore Mindoro. Steamer Bay remained in the Philippine Islands with the rest of the 7th Fleet until 31 January, when she departed for Ulithi. Steamer Bay was only anchored for five days, before she departed with the rest of the 5th Fleet, bound for Iwo Jima. She was incorporated into Carrier Division 26, under the command of Rear Admiral Clifton Sprague, alongside four other escort carriers. The task group began operations, west of Iwo Jima, on 16 February. The task group's mission was to neutralize Japanese bases and positions along the Nanp≈ç Islands until 19 February (D-Day). The task group then provided close air support for the marines throughout the landings and the costly struggle throughout the island. Steamer Bay, along with , was relieved on 7 March, and then proceeded to Leyte. They arrived at San Pedro Bay on 12 March, where she prepared for the upcoming invasion of Okinawa Island. She sailed for the Ryukyu Islands on 27 March, arriving in her operating area south of the island on the morning of 1 April. Operations were complicated by uncooperative weather and choppy seas. On 3 April, a sailor was cast overboard when a railing broke. His body was not recovered. She conducted operations until 26 May when she was relieved, and sailed to Apra Harbor, Guam, for repairs and rest. On 10 June, she was ordered to join the 3rd Fleet east of Miyako Jima assisted her task group in neutralizing Japanese airfields on Sakishima Gunto. She conducted air strikes against the airfields from 14 June to 22 June, before sailing for Ulithi. Steamer Bay left Ulithi on 3 July, part of the Logistics Support Group, responsible for resupplying the fast carrier forces with aircraft during operations against the Japanese mainland. On 20 July, she was detached and sailed, making stops at Guam and Pearl Harbor, for the West Coast, arriving at San Diego on 10 August. =Post war= Steamer Bay was in dry dock when the Japanese surrender was announced. When repairs were finished, she became a part of the Operation Magic Carpet fleet, which repatriated U.S. servicemen from around the Pacific. To support her new role, bunk beds were installed within the hangar deck to accommodate veterans returning from overseas. On 28 September, she sailed for Pearl Harbor, on her first Magic Carpet run. After completing her Magic Carpet duties, Steamer Bay was assigned to the Pacific Reserve Fleet on 4 February 1946, and berthed at Tacoma, Washington. On January 1947, she was placed in reserve, and decommissioned. Her designation was changed to CVHE-87 on 12 June 1955. She was struck from the Navy list on 1 March 1959, and sold to Hyman-Michaels Co., Chicago, Illinois, on 29 August 1959, for scrapping. She received six battle stars for her World War II service.

Her keel was laid down on 23 November 1943, and she was launched on 19 February 1944; sponsored by Mrs. Kathryn Mullinnix; and commissioned at Astoria, Oregon, on 28 March 1944, Captain Robert G. Lockhart in command. Service history Sitkoh Bay spent the month after commissioning completing her fitting out and making short shakedown and trial cruises along the northwestern coast of the United States. On 28 April, the escort carrier entered port at Alameda, California, loaded cargo and embarked passengers. She stood out of Alameda on 30 April, bound for Pearl Harbor, and began the first of many routine voyages shuttling planes, pilots, and air crewmen back and forth between the front line and rear areas. The majority of her missions carried her from Pearl Harbor, or via Pearl Harbor from the California coast, to various islands in the southern or central Pacific which served as staging areas for the war being waged farther north or west. In the latter part of 1944, her ports of call were Majuro in the Marshall Islands, and Manus in the Admiralty Islands. From these two points, planes were staged on to the 3rd and 7th Fleets, respectively. In January 1945, the South Pacific was dropped from Sitkoh Bays itinerary, and she concentrated on replenishing the 3rd Fleet in the Central Pacific. Her ports of call included Apra Harbor, Guam, in the Marianas; Roi Harbor, Roi Island, and Eniwetok in the Marshalls; and Ulithi Atoll in the Western Carolines. Her missions in early 1945 were in support of the campaigns in the Philippines, the assault on Iwo Jima, and the preparations for the invasion of Okinawa. Sitkoh Bays only action came on 7 April 1945 while she was delivering Marine Air Group 31 to Okinawa. At 1528, a Yokosuka P1Y \\"Frances\\" dove at the carrier. Sitkoh Bays anti-aircraft gunners combined with an F4U Corsair on combat air patrol from to shoot down the interloper about 100 yards off Sitkoh Bays port beam. The next day, she cleared the area for Guam en route to Pearl Harbor and a return to her replenishment routine. After the cessation of hostilities with Japan on 15 August, Sitkoh Bay joined Task Group 30.8 (TG 30.8), the replenishment group for the 3rd Fleet, and cruised with it off the southeastern coast of Honsh≈´ from 25 August-5 September. On 10 September, she entered Eniwetok and departed the next day for Guam. For the next month, she made voyages between Guam, Samar Island in the Philippines, and Okinawa, returning to Pearl Harbor on 18 October and San Diego on the 26th for an availability period. After further voyages to the Central Pacific, Sitkoh Bay returned to the United States and was placed out of commission, in reserve, on 30 November 1946 at Bremerton, Wash. F-84Es to Japan, 1951. On 29 July 1950, Sitkoh Bay was recommissioned with Captain C. W. Lord in command. She was assigned to the Military Sealift Service, and for the next four years, she sailed between the west coast and Japan, supporting U.N. forces in Korea. Her major ports of call were San Francisco, San Diego, and Pearl Harbor and Yokohama and Yokosuka in Japan. Sitkoh Bay departed from this west coast-to-Japan routine three times over those four years. In March 1951, she delivered a load of F8F Bearcats to the French forces at Saigon in French Indochina and then visited Manila, P.I., before returning to California-to-Japan runs. In September, she visited Pusan, Korea. Sitkoh Bay ventured from her normal sea-lanes again in May 1952, when she sailed back to San Francisco from Yokosuka. The escort carrier ceased operations again in 1954 and was placed out of commission, in reserve, on 27 July. She joined the Pacific Reserve Fleet and was berthed at San Francisco. On 12 June 1955, the mothballed escort carrier was redesignated a utility aircraft carrier, CVU-86. In mid-March 1958, she changed berthing areas, moving from San Francisco to San Diego. On 1 April 1960, Sitkoh Bay, by then reclassified as a cargo ship and aircraft ferry, AKV-86, was struck from the Naval Vessel Register. Her hulk was sold on 30 August 1960 to Eisenberg & Co. of New York City for scrapping. Awards Sitkoh Bay was awarded three battle stars for her World War II service, and one for the Korean War.

She was laid down with the hull code ACV-84 on 15 March 1943 by the Kaiser Co., Vancouver, Washington, under a Maritime Commission contract (MC hull 1121); re-designated CVE-84 on 10 June 1943; launched on 4 February 1944; sponsored by Mrs. James R. Dudley; and commissioned on 15 March 1944, Captain Frank T. Ward, Jr., in command. Service history Following shakedown, Shamrock Bay remained on the west coast into June qualifying pilots in carrier landings. Then transferred to transport duty in the Atlantic, she carried Army fighter planes and Army and Navy personnel to Casablanca and brought back damaged P-40s for use in training and for salvage and aircraft engines for overhaul and salvage. Passengers on the return voyages were, for the most part, Army Air Corps personnel from the China-Burma-India theater. On 27 October, Shamrock Bay completed her second transport run at Norfolk and prepared for antisubmarine operations in the South Atlantic. However, the loss of escort carriers in the Philippine area brought a change of orders; and, on 11 November, with Composite Squadron 42 (VC-42) embarked, she sailed for the Pacific. Transiting the Panama Canal on 18 November, she arrived at San Diego on the 27th; embarked VC-93 for transportation to Hawaii on 2 December; and reached Pearl Harbor on the 9th. There, VC-42 and ‚àí93 were disembarked and VC-94 reported for duty. On the 11th, Shamrock Bay continued west, and, delivering planes to Johnston Island en route, arrived at Seeadler Harbor, on Manus in the Admiralty Islands, on the 22nd to join the 7th Fleet. With an increase in aircraft from her normal ASW complement of 9 Grumman TBM Avengers and 12 General Motors FM-2 Wildcats to 12 Avengers and 20 Wildcats, Shamrock Bay covered Task Groups 79.1 and 79.2 from 31 December 1944 through 8 January 1945, as those groups departed the Admiralties and moved into the Philippines for the Lingayen Gulf invasion of Luzon. Enemy aerial resistance increased as the force closed its objective. On the 8th, dogfights peppered the sky. was hit by a kamikaze and was unable to accommodate all of her planes. Two were landed on Shamrock Bay. Shortly afterwards, another kamikaze, a Nakajima Ki-43 \\"Oscar\\", headed for Shamrock Bay, but was driven off only to crash into . Shamrock Bay then landed that CVE's planes, as escort ships went to the aid of the stricken carrier. From 9 to 17 January, Shamrock Bay remained in the assault area conducting flight operations in support of the invasion. Five hundred and seventy-one sorties were flown, 180 of which were over Luzon. On the 17th, she joined TG 77.14 and sailed for Ulithi. At Ulithi, the escort carrier joined TU 50.8.25; and, on 16 February, departed that atoll to act as carrier escort of group Baker of the Logistics Support Group for the Iwo Jima landings. She continued that support into March. On the 5th, she returned to Ulithi to prepare for Operation Iceberg, the assault on Okinawa; and, on the 13th, she got underway for the Ryukyus, again supplying cover for the Logistics Support Group. Detached on 7 April, a week after the main landings on the Hagushi beaches, she joined TU 52.1.1 and commenced strikes over Okinawa. On 15 April 1945, four of the Shamrock Bay's FM-2 Wildcat fighters were scrambled to help save the USS Laffey (DD-724). The Laffey was under attack from kamikazes in Picket Station 1, 50 miles north of Okinawa. The four fighters shot down six enemy kamikazes but were forced to return to the Shamrock Bay due to being low on fuel and ammunition. The Laffey is later saved by a flight of 12 Marine Vought F4U Corsair fighter-bombers. With only a few, brief interruptions to take on supplies and ammunition at Kerama Retto, Shamrock Bay remained at sea conducting flight operations in support of the Okinawa campaign until 11 May. She then sailed for Guam to take on aircraft and aviation spares as well as ammunition and supplies. On the 20th, Captain J.E. Leeper relieved Captain Ward, and VC-96 replaced VC-94. On the 28th, the ship departed Apra Harbor to return to the Ryukyus; and, at the end of the month, she resumed her support activities as a unit of TU 32.1.1. In early June, flight operations were interrupted as the force rode out a typhoon, then continued until the ships headed for the Philippines after mid-month. Shamrock Bay, having launched over 1,200 sorties in support of the Okinawa campaign, arrived in San Pedro Bay on 27 June. In early July, she transferred her planes to Guiuan airfield. On the 5th, she sailed for Guam to take on aircraft engines to be returned to the United States for overhaul; and, on the 27th, she arrived at San Diego. VC-96 then disembarked, and Shamrock Bay commenced an availability period which ended just before the cessation of hostilities in the Pacific. After the end of the war, Shamrock Bay made a transport run to Guam, carrying Army and Navy planes out and vehicles back. Then assigned to \\"Magic Carpet\\" duty, she offloaded her aviation stores and detached her aviation personnel at Alameda; and, on 20 October, headed for Pearl Harbor to embark her first contingent of returning veterans, members of the 4th Marine Division. She completed that run at San Diego on 2 November 1945, then made two transpacific runs, one to Okinawa and one to Honsh≈´. She completed the second run at Seattle on 26 January 1946. On 2 February, she sailed for Alameda; and, on the 7th, she got underway to return to the east coast for inactivation. Shamrock Bay arrived at Boston on 1 March; underwent overhaul; and was decommissioned on 6 July 1946. Reclassified CVU-84 on 12 June 1955, she remained in the Reserve Fleet until struck from the Navy List on 27 June 1958. In May 1958, she was sold for scrapping to the Hyman-Michaels Co., of Chicago.

Service history U.S. Grumman TBF Avengers in flight over Shipley Bay. A destroyer is visible in the foreground. Upon being commissioned, Shipley Bay underwent a shakedown cruise down the West Coast to San Diego. She operated off the Southern California coast until 3 May, when she took on a load of aircraft and personnel, and ferried them to Pearl Harbor and stops in the South Pacific. She conducted these transport missions until October, making stops at the West Coast, Pearl Harbor, Majuro Atoll, Guadalcanal, and Tulagi. In these missions, she ferried a total of 496 aircraft. After finishing her aircraft deliveries, she was designated the role of a replacement carrier, carrying aircraft to replenish battlefield losses. She was assigned to Task Group 30.8 within Task Force 38, and maintained a backline, supply role. In three meetings, she transferred a total of 100 aircraft to frontline carriers. The first rendezvous was conducted between 17 October and 29 October east of Samar, as she provided replacement aircraft for the desperate Battle off Samar. Her second transfer occurred east of Luzon, between 10 December and 24 December, as landings and close air support began being conducted for the ongoing Battle of Luzon. Her third and final transfer happened between 26 December 1944 and 12 January 1945 whilst Shipley Bay was northwest of Luzon, as an armada of carriers supported the Invasion of Lingayen Gulf. After finishing her duties as a replacement carrier for the Philippines campaign, she operated off of Pearl Harbor as a training carrier for the next three months. During her tenure as a replacement carrier, Captain Austin Wadsworth Wheelock took over as commanding officer of the ship. On 22 April, she departed Pearl Harbor, bound for Okinawa. Stopping at Guam, she arrived on 7 May and immediately began operations. Between 7 May and 16 May, her aircraft conducted 352 sorties supporting the Battle of Okinawa, bombing Japanese defenses and equipment. On 16 May, her aviation gasoline tanks were damaged by a collision, forcing her to retire back to Guam for repairs. Once repairs were finished, she once again returned to the waters off of Okinawa, along with five other escort carriers. She resumed operations on 9 June, and her aircraft were assigned the duty of neutralizing the five airfields on Miyako-jima and Ishigaki-jima, from which kamikaze aircraft were operating. She bombed the airfields between 14 and 16 June, returning again from 18 to 22 June. On 22 June, she left, bound for the West Coast, where she would undergo overhaul. She was moored at U.S. Repair Base, San Diego when the Japanese surrender was announced. On 26 September, she left San Diego, and joined the \\"Magic Carpet\\" fleet, which repatriated U.S. servicemen from throughout the Pacific. She cruised around the Pacific, making stops at San Francisco, Pearl Harbor, Okinawa, and Kwajalein, ultimately returning several thousand troops back to the United States. Shipley Bay sailed to Boston, Massachusetts in February 1946 in order to undergo deactivation, arriving on 9 March. She was decommissioned on 28 June 1946, and mothballed in the Atlantic Reserve Fleet at South Boston Naval Annex. On 12 June 1955, she was redesignated as a utility aircraft carrier, CVU-85. She was struck from the Navy list on 1 March 1959, and sold for scrap on 2 October. She was towed to Japan, where she was broken up throughout January 1961. She received two battle stars for her World War II service.

Casablanca-class escort carriers were designed to carry 27 aircraft, but Saginaw Bay sometimes went over or under this number. For example, during the Mariana and Palau Islands campaign, she carried 18 FM-2 fighters, and 12 TBM-1C torpedo bombers, for a total of 30 aircraft. However, during the Philippines campaign, she carried 20 FM-2 fighters and 12 TBM-3 torpedo bombers, for a total of 32 aircraft. During the Invasion of Iwo Jima, she carried 20 FM-2 fighters and 12 TBM-3 torpedo bombers, for a total of 32 aircraft. During the Battle of Okinawa, she carried 19 FM-2 fighters, 11 TBM-3 torpedo bombers, and a TBM-3P reconnaissance aircraft, for a total of 31 aircraft. Construction A contract for fifty Casablanca-class escort carriers was made on 18 June 1942, with the construction being awarded to the Kaiser Shipbuilding Company, Vancouver, Washington. All fifty were commissioned in the span of a single year. Saginaw Bay was laid down on 1 November 1943 under a Maritime Commission contract, MC hull 1119, by Kaiser Shipbuilding Company, Vancouver, Washington. She was launched on 19 January 1944, and was sponsored by Mrs. Howard L. Vickery. After construction was completed, the ship was transferred to the United States Navy and commissioned on 2 March. Upon commissioning, Saginaw Bay was under the command of Captain Frank Carlin Sutton Jr. Service history =World War II= A TBM Avenger flies over Saginaw Bay on 14 June 1944, during pilot qualifications off of Southern California. Vought F4U Corsairs being ferried to Hawaii onboard Saginaw Bay, 19 April 1944. Upon being commissioned, she underwent a shakedown cruise off of San Diego. On 15 April 1944, Saginaw Bay loaded aircraft and their pilots from Terminal Island for transport to Hawaii. She arrived at Pearl Harbor on 21 April, where she unloaded her cargo in exchange for damaged planes, before returning to Alameda, California. She proceeded to conduct pilot qualifications off the coast of San Diego throughout May and early June, during which a FM-2 fighter crashed into the sea, killing its pilot. After completing her exercises, she underwent a second replenishment aircraft ferry mission, arriving at Pearl Harbor on 5 July. After taking on a load of aircraft, she proceeded westward to Enewetak Atoll and Majuro before returning to San Diego. On 13 August, she left, bound for the Solomon Islands, where she would act as the flagship for Carrier Division 28, commanded by Rear Admiral George R. Henderson. There, she prepared for the invasion of the Palaus. From 15 September to 9 October, her task group provided air cover over Peleliu and Anguar. She retired to Seeadler Harbor, located within Manus Island, where plans were drawn for the landings on Leyte. She joined \\"Taffy 1\\", along with 12 other escort carriers, under the command of Rear Admiral Thomas L. Sprague. \\"Taffy 1\\" was assigned the task of guarding the southeast entrance into Leyte Gulf. On 14 October, the task group departed, guarding troop transports along the way, arriving within Leyte Gulf by 20 October. As the Japanese Fleet closed in for a decisive engagement on 24 October, Saginaw Bay and transferred much of their aircraft contingent to other carriers. She then retired to Morotai for replacement aircraft, missing the ensuing Battle off Samar. She rejoined her task unit on 28 October with a new aircraft contingent, just as it started to retire back to Manus. Saginaw Bay was anchored in Seeadler Harbor on 10 November when the ammunition ship underwent a catastrophic explosion. She suffered only minor damage from the blast and resulting tidal wave. During her layover, she was taken into dry dock for repairs. From 14 December to the 21st, she underwent exercises in preparation for amphibious landings at Lingayen. On 2 January 1945, her task group departed Manus, escorting transports, arriving at Lingayen Gulf just in time to support the landings on 9 January. On 10 January, she came under attack from two Japanese bombers, who dropped bombs, which missed. On 14 January, a torpedo was spotted near her hull, which also missed. During this period of activity, was heavily damaged by a kamikaze, and was sunk by one, complicating the task group's efforts to provide air support. Efforts were also hampered by heavy seas, which made landings on her flight deck precarious. On 21 January, she retired from supporting the landings, steaming back to Ulithi, in preparation for the landings upon Iwo Jima. On 23 January, she participated in a rehearsal of the Iwo Jima landings in Ulithi. On 10 February, her task group departed Ulithi en route to Iwo Jima, making a stop at Saipan along the way. On 19 January, she supported the landings and provided air support until 11 March. During operations, the carrier task group was constantly harried by kamikazes. Her crew witnessed the escort carrier get hit by two kamikazes, before sinking from the resulting blaze. On 11 March, she departed from Iwo Jima bound for Ulithi, with Japanese forces still entrenched within the northern half of the island. On 14 March, she arrived back at Ulithi, where Captain Robert Goldthwaite assumed command. Saginaw Bay was quickly returned into action, departing for Okinawa on 21 March, arriving on 24 March. There, she immediately began operations in preparation for the landings, which proceeded until 29 April. On 2 April, her anti-aircraft guns shot down a Japanese plane which dove towards her, while she was loading ammunition within Kerama Retto Harbor. Throughout the battle, her aircraft claimed eleven Japanese planes. On 29 April, she was ordered back to the United States, making stops at Guam, Pearl Harbor, arriving at San Francisco on 22 May, where she underwent repairs. After repairs were finished, she then proceeded down to San Diego, where she delivered planes to Guam, returning on 20 August. En route, the surrender of Japan was announced. =Post war= Following the end of the war, she steamed for Hawaii, where she underwent training operations before being incorporated into Operation Magic Carpet, which repatriated U.S. servicemen from throughout the Pacific. On 14 September, she departed Hawaii, making stops at Guiuan Roadstead, Samar, and San Pedro Bay, Leyte, where she took on servicemen. She then returned to San Francisco. She then made a second Magic Carpet run to Buckner Bay, Okinawa, before proceeding back for San Francisco. On 1 February 1946, she was discharged from the Magic Carpet fleet, and departed San Francisco for Boston Naval Shipyard, on the Eastern seaboard. She arrived on 23 February for inactivation, and she was subsequently decommissioned on 19 June. She was assigned to the Boston Group of the U.S. Atlantic Reserve Fleet. On 12 June 1955, she was reclassified as CVHE-82, but she was never converted. On 1 March 1959, she was struck from the navy list and sold to Louis Simmons on 27 November. In April 1960, she was broken up in Rotterdam, the Netherlands.

Her compact size necessitated the installment of an aircraft catapult at her bow, and there were two aircraft elevators to facilitate movement of aircraft between the flight and hangar deck: one each fore and aft. One /38 caliber dual-purpose gun was mounted on the stern. Anti-aircraft defense was provided by eight Bofors anti-aircraft guns in single mounts, as well as twelve Oerlikon cannons, which were mounted around the perimeter of the deck. By the end of the war, Casablanca-class carriers had been modified to carry thirty 20-mm cannons, and the amount of 40-mm guns had been doubled to sixteen, by putting them into twin mounts. These modifications were in response to increasing casualties due to kamikaze attacks. Casablanca-class escort carriers were designed to carry 27 aircraft, but the hangar deck could accommodate more. For example, during the Invasion of Iwo Jima, she carried 20 FM-2 fighters, and 12 TBM-1C torpedo bombers, for a total of 32 aircraft. During the Battle of Okinawa, she carried 18 FM-2 fighters, 10 TBM-1C variant torpedo bombers, and 3 TBM-3 variant torpedo bombers, for a total of 31 aircraft. Construction Her construction was awarded to Kaiser Shipbuilding Company, Vancouver, Washington under a Maritime Commission contract, on 18 June 1942, under the name Didrickson Bay, as part of a tradition which named escort carriers after bays or sounds in Alaska. The escort carrier was laid down on 8 November 1943, under a Maritime Commission contract, MC hull 1120, by Kaiser Shipbuilding Company, Vancouver, Washington. She was launched on 31 January 1944; sponsored by Mrs. Edith W. DeBaun; transferred to the United States Navy and commissioned on 9 March 1944, with Captain William Theodore Rassieur in command. Service history Sargent Bay being moved by tugs off the Washington coast, 25 March 1944. The destroyer escort transfers a sick crewman onto Sargent Bay. Upon being commissioned, Sargent Bay underwent a shakedown cruise down the West Coast to San Diego. She then underwent a transport mission, ferrying P-47 Thunderbolts of the 333rd Fighter Squadron, 318th Fighter Group to Saipan. She unloaded her cargo on 18 July, and reported to the 3rd Fleet at Pearl Harbor on 17 August. The next day, she departed, bound for Eniwetok and Manus Island. On 6 November, she left Manus, assigned to Task Group 30.8 (Fleet Oiler and Transport Carrier Group) on the first of four tours with replenishment groups operating off the Philippines. She provided air cover and support for the vulnerable oilers which supplied the frontline fast carrier groups with fuel and replacement aircraft, enabling them to operate out at sea for long periods of time. During this time period, Sargent Bay was based out of Ulithi. She remained on this duty until 27 January 1945, staying out at sea in two to four week increments. In February 1945, Sargent Bay was assigned to Task Group 52.2, the escort carrier group responsible for providing air cover in preparation for the Invasion of Iwo Jima. Along five other carriers, she operated under the command of Rear Admiral Clifton Sprague, in Carrier Division 26. Her air contingent provided artillery spotting and close air support for the marines struggling through the island, and she also conducted aircraft screening for the task group, as well as anti-submarine patrols. She continued operations until 11 March, when she retired along with her task group. Sargent Bay was only out of action for a short period of time, as she joined Task Group 52.1.1, the escort carrier force assigned to support the planned Battle of Okinawa. Under the command of Rear Admiral Felix Stump, she began operations off of Okinawa on 25 March. She provided many of the same duties as she did during the Invasion of Iwo Jima, including conducting anti-aircraft patrols. Notably, on the late evening of 3 April, her fighters shot down one of a pair of kamikazes attempting to approach the escort carriers. Anti-aircraft fire from the destroyer brought down the other kamikaze. On 7 April, she traded places with the escort carrier , as she briefly left to join the Logistics Support Group, before returning to the strike force on 18 April. She left again on 15 May, for repairs at Guam. She rejoined operations over Okinawa on 2 June, before finally retiring from the operation on 20 June. Proceeding south, she arrived off of Leyte on 23 June, and spent the next month performing upkeep. She then sailed for the United States, arriving at San Pedro on 9 August for repairs and overhaul. There, news of the Japanese surrender broke. After completing overhaul, she joined the Operation Magic Carpet fleet, which repatriated U.S. servicemen from around the Pacific. During the month of October, she made two runs, transporting personnel from Hawaii. She then conducted a run to Eniwetok, and a final run to Okinawa, finishing her duties before the New Year. Passing through the Panama Canal, Sargent Bay arrived at Boston on 23 March 1946 for inactivation. She was decommissioned on 23 June, and subsequently stored at the South Boston Naval Annex, where she was mothballed as part of the Atlantic Reserve Fleet. She was reclassified CVU-83 on 12 June 1955. She was struck from the Navy list on 27 June 1958, and she was sold on 30 July 1959 to J.C. Berkwitt Co., New York. She was ultimately broken up in Antwerp, Belgium, starting September 1959.

Construction Her construction was awarded to Kaiser Shipbuilding Company, Vancouver, Washington under a Maritime Commission contract, on 18 June 1942. The escort carrier was laid down on 27 September 1943 under the name Kaita Bay, as part of a tradition which named escort carriers after bays or sounds in Alaska. She was laid down as MC hull 1115, the twenty-fourth of a series of fifty Casablanca-class escort carriers. She was renamed Savo Island on 6 November 1943, as part of a new naval policy which named subsequent Casablanca-class carriers after naval or land engagements. She was launched on 22 December 1943; sponsored by Miss Margaret Taffinder; transferred to the United States Navy and commissioned on 3 February 1944, with Captain Clarence Eugene Ekstrom in command. Service history Upon being commissioned, Savo Island underwent a shakedown cruise down the West Coast to San Diego, where she took on a load of replacement aircraft. Between 15 March 1944 and 2 July, she underwent two transport missions, ferrying aircraft to bases in the Southwest Pacific. On 6 July, she embarked Composite Squadron (VC) 27, which would be her aircraft contingent throughout the Marianas and Palau Islands campaign and the Philippines campaign of 1944‚Äì45. After a brief period of training off the waters of San Diego, she sailed west to Pearl Harbor, where similar exercises were conducted. There, on 4 August, she was assigned to Task Group 32.7, the Western Escort Carrier Group, commanded by Rear Admiral William Sample, of the Third Fleet, assigned to support the planned landings on the island of Peleliu, in the Palau Islands. Her aircraft contingent began combat operations on 11 September, strafing and bombarding the island to soften up the defenses for the landings. Following the landing of marines, her aircraft transitioned into providing close air support and patrol missions, up until 30 September. On 3 October, she was assigned to and joined Task Group 77.4, which was gathering at Manus Island, in the Admiralty Islands, as part of the Seventh Fleet. She, accompanied by eighteen other escort carriers and their screens of battleships, cruisers, and destroyers, steamed on 12 October for Leyte Gulf, where they were expected to support the landings on Leyte, which marked the beginning of the Philippines campaign. As a part of Task Unit 77.4.2, otherwise known as \\"Taffy 2\\", commanded by Rear Admiral Felix Stump, she was positioned to the direct south of \\"Taffy 3\\", which was located to the direct east of the San Bernardino Strait. Arriving off the island on 18 October, her aircraft began carrying out naval patrols and strikes against predesignated targets. Once the Sixth Army had landed on 20 October, her aircraft transitioned towards a focus on close air support, supporting the initial advances for the next few days. On 23 October, the Battle of Leyte Gulf began. Almost the entirety of Japan's remaining surface fleet had been concentrated into a counterattack against the U.S. forces in the vicinity of the Philippines, which had threatened to cut off Japan's vital oil supply from Southeast Asia. Split into three groups, the Southern Force was defeated in the Battle of Surigao Strait, whilst Vice Admiral William Halsey Jr. sent the Third Fleet in an attack against the diversionary Northern Force. Therefore, the escort carriers which continued providing ground support had no capital ship screening, even as Vice Admiral Takeo Kurita's Center Force drove through the San Bernardino Strait during the night. On the early morning of 25 October, the Center Force emerged into the waters of the Leyte Gulf, catching Taffy 3, some north of Savo Island, by surprise. As the American command came to an understanding of the severity of the situation, with the Center Force consisting of four battleships, six cruisers, and a large destroyer screen, the entirety of Taffy 2's aircraft were recalled to join the defense. Savo Islands fighters and torpedo bombers were not equipped to attack surface ships, with most of her bombers being loaded with incendiary bombs and missiles for ground attacks. Nonetheless, aircraft from Savo Islands VC-27 were amongst Taffy 2's first wave of strikes, launched at 7:37 in the morning. Some of the destroyers within Taffy 2's screen wandered north, before being confronted with some Japanese naval gunfire and being ordered to withdraw towards the escort carriers. Overall, Savo Island launched six strikes against the Japanese forces, with her aircraft notably landing a torpedo hit on a Japanese battleship and shooting down an Aichi E13A reconnaissance seaplane caught in the middle of the action. Discouraged by the stiff resistance his Center Force had faced, including the loss of three cruisers, Kurita issued orders to withdraw in the late morning, sparing Taffy 3 from further destruction. As the Japanese forces withdrew, fighters from Savo Island took the opportunity to down four more Japanese planes. Nonetheless, the escort carriers underwent concentrated Japanese attack again in the afternoon, this time from the air, including some of the first usage of kamikaze suicide attacks. The carrier continued supporting ground operations until 30 October, when Taffy 2 was reorganized into Task Unit 77.4.4, and ordered to withdraw back to Manus Island to rearm and replenish. She sortied from Manus on 19 November, providing cover for convoys proceeding to Leyte Gulf from 22 November to 27 November, accompanied by two other escort carriers. Upon completing this task, she replenished at Kossol Roads, Palau, before she left on 10 December, this time in support of the landings on the island of Mindoro. Her aircraft provided air cover as the landing craft unloaded their troops, and provided close air support as they advanced. They also targeted air fields, from which kamikaze aircraft were beginning to make regular forays. The escort carriers were relieved by Army aircraft on 15 December, but she stayed offshore until 17 December because of indications of a Japanese surface raid, which never materialized. On 17 December, she steamed back to Manus Island. Savo Island underway in the Sulu Sea, photographed from the battleship . At Manus Island, Savo Island was assigned to Task Unit 77.4.2., the San Fabian Carrier Group. On 27 December, the carriers, escorted by a large surface fleet, left Manus bound for Lingayen Gulf, to the west of Luzon. There, the carriers would support the 6th Army landings on Luzon. As a part of Task Unit 77.4.2., Savo Island would provide air support and cover for the I Army Corps, which would land around the San Fabian area. Pausing at San Pedro Bay, the carriers entered the Sulu Sea on 3 January 1945, where they began being harried by aircraft, circling around on radar. Japanese planes continued appearing around the periphery of the American forces throughout 4 January, but it was not until 17:00 in the evening that the Japanese forces coalesced into a kamikaze strike, attacking at 17:12, achieving complete surprise, and sinking Savo Islands sister . The following day, on 5 January, the kamikazes returned. At 17:43 in the evening, the battleship reported planes approaching from her starboard bow, and shortly afterwards, Savo Islands sister had been hit by two kamikazes, heavily damaging the ship. A few minutes after the attack on Manila Bay, a Nakajima Ki-43 kamikaze dove towards Savo Island. Engaged by several anti-aircraft batteries, the plane began trailing smoke some away from the carrier. As a reaction, Savo Island turned hard to starboard, whilst its searchlight was pointed at the aircraft to try to blind the pilot. The plane, moving erratically, passed between the carrier's mast and the whip antenna, shearing off the carrier's radar antenna, before diving into the sea. On 6 January, the carriers proceeded into Lingayen Gulf, and started a heavy bombardment of Japanese defenses, flying 5,971 sorties in eleven days. On 9 January, the 6th Army moved onshore, encountering little resistance. Savo Island remained on station until 17 January, when the United States Air Force took over air operations on Luzon. She then proceeded south to operate to the northwest of Mindoro, to guard against any counterattacks on the American garrisons situated throughout the Northern Philippines, staying on station from 17 January until 29 January. During this period, on 19 January, Captain William Donald Anderson took command of the ship. Upon completing her patrols, she then provided cover for landings near Subic Bay on 29 and 30 January, before retiring to Ulithi, in the Caroline Islands, for repairs and replenishment. There, her aircraft contingent, Composite Squadron 27, was replaced with Composite Squadron 91, which had previously served upon Savo Islands sister . Upon receiving replacement pilots, she began a brief period of training exercises, before being assigned to Task Unit 52.1.1, in preparation for the Battle of Okinawa. Transiting via Leyte, her aircraft provided air cover and patrols en route. On 26 March, along with two other escort carriers, she supported the 77th Infantry Division as it occupied the Kerama Islands. On 27 March, she began bombing the main island of Okinawa, with her fighters flying antiaircraft and antisubmarine patrols. On 7 April, the carrier left Task Unit 52.1.1., trading places with , part of Task Group 50.8, the Logistics Support Group. Therefore, from 7 to 16 April, she screened a replenishment convoy proceeding to the east of Okinawa. Upon the completion of that task, she continued providing close air support for American forces advancing down Okinawa. On 27 April, her aircraft bombed Sakishima Gunto, an island situated halfway between Okinawa and Formosa. On 29 April, Savo Island, along with her sisters and , were discharged from their task group, all sailing for overhaul in San Diego. Savo Islands aircraft contingent, Composite Squadron 91, was traded for her sister 's Composite Squadron (VC) 84. USS Savo Island (CVE-78) photographed from the waterline, her flight deck full of aircraft, date and location unknown. After finishing overhaul, Savo Island began a transport mission from San Diego to Pearl Harbor, before transiting back to Alameda, California, on the West Coast. On 6 August, she departed for the Aleutian Islands, arriving on 15 August, right as the Surrender of Japan was announced. On 31 August, she headed, along with six other escort carriers, to support the occupation of Japan in northern Honsh≈´ and Hokkaid≈ç. After finishing her duties, she returned to Pearl Harbor on 25 September, where she was assigned to the \\"Magic Carpet\\" fleet, which repatriated servicemen from throughout the Pacific. She first loaded occupation troops bound for Japan at San Francisco, before heading west. Savo Island made a total of three \\"Magic Carpet\\" voyages, repatriating troops from Guam, Pearl Harbor, and Okinawa, respectively. Upon arriving at Seattle on 14 January 1946, and finishing her final voyage, she transited to the Eastern seaboard, entering Boston Harbor on 16 March for inactivation. Savo Island was decommissioned on 12 December, and mothballed in the Atlantic Reserve Fleet, as part of its Boston group. Docked at the South Boston Naval Annex, she was reclassified as a helicopter escort carrier (CVHE-78) on 12 June 1955. She was then further reclassified as an aviation transport (AKV-28) on 7 May 1959. She was struck from the Navy list on 1 September 1959, and she was sold on 29 February 1960 to Comarket Inc., which broke her up in Hong Kong throughout June 1960. Savo Island received 4 battle stars for her World War II service. In addition, she received a Presidential Unit Citation for her service in the Western Carolines, the Philippines, and Okinawa from 6 September 1944 to 29 April 1945. Clarence Ekstrom, the carrier's commander during the Battle of Leyte Gulf, later received the Navy Cross for his leadership and courage in the action. In popular culture While the Savo Island spent the Korean War in mothballs as part of the Atlantic Reserve Fleet, author James Michener fictionally had it in commission (as an Essex-class fleet carrier) and participating in that war as the primary setting for his novella The Bridges at Toko-Ri. The 1954 movie version was filmed aboard the fleet carriers and with Oriskany still displaying its hull symbol of CV-34, but the ship was still referred to as the Savo Island.

Many parents park their cars in school parking lots and driveways to drop off and pick up their children at the appropriate times.  Background  In the past it was normal for children to walk to school, either on their own, with friends, or accompanied by an adult. Walking to school has fallen from 61% of primary school pupils in 1992/4 to 50% in 2004. In recent years walking to school has become less common as more and more students are dropped off at school by parents using cars, sometimes in a rota with other parents. The reasons for this are manifold. Firstly, in many cases both parents work and do not have time to walk their children to school, and do not know any other parents who have the time either. Secondly, even if the children are old enough to walk on their own (or cycle), most parents are worried that something may happen to them, e.g. abduction, car accidents, etc. Often there is no convenient bus service, and the distance is too far for walking, thus forcing the school run. The risk of children being run over near their schools is much higher than in the past due to all the parents driving their own children to school and parking in unsafe places near the school gates. It is not unusual to see drivers parking their cars in bus stops, on pedestrian crossings or facing the wrong way, with children getting in or out of the car. The fear that something may happen to the children has perhaps more to do with media coverage of isolated cases than any real threat.  Problems arising from 'the school run'  Some schools now have a 20 mph speed limit operating when the children are about, though traffic congestion often necessitates a lower speed. With the increase in a choice of schools for parents, children may have to travel further and are more likely to require a bus or car ride. It is claimed that the school run is responsible for a large amount of the traffic problems in the morning rush hour. The decreasing amount of exercise and associated increase in obesity are also partly blamed on the school run. To combat the issue of exercise, or lack thereof, many schools have started employing programs and techniques to encourage children to walk to school, whilst mitigating the possible dangers of walking to school. An example of one of these programs is the 'walking school bus' whereby children at selected schools can elect to travel within an organised group of school children and volunteer parents. The school run has become a popular target for some politicians and campaigners against the use of cars for journeys which could be better walked or cycled. One of the campaigns promoting this alternative is the walk to school campaign.

The company diversified into car manufacturing with its acquisitions of Triumph and Rover in 1960 and 1967, respectively. It gave its name to the British Leyland Motor Corporation, formed when it merged with British Motor Holdings in 1968, to become British Leyland after being nationalised. British Leyland later changed its name to simply BL, then in 1986 to Rover Group. After the various vehicle manufacturing businesses of BL and its successors went defunct or were divested, the following marques survived: Jaguar and Land Rover, now built by Jaguar Land Rover; MG, now built by MG Motor, and Mini, now built by BMW. The truck building operation survived largely intact as Leyland Trucks, a subsidiary of Paccar.

Their first products included steam powered lawn mowers. The company's first vehicle was a 1.5-ton-capacity steam powered van. This was followed by a number of undertype steam wagons using a vertical fire-tube boiler. By 1905 they had also begun to build petrol-engined wagons. The Lancashire Steam Motor Company was renamed Leyland Motors in 1907 when it took over Coulthards of Preston, who had been making steam wagons since 1897.\\"The Coulthard Steam Wagon\\", The Automotor and Horseless Carriage Journal, Dec 1897, p84 They also built a second factory in the neighbouring town of Chorley which still remains today as the headquarters of the Lex Autolease and parts company. In 1920, Leyland Motors produced the Leyland Eight luxury touring car, a development of which was driven by J.G. Parry- Thomas at Brooklands. Parry-Thomas was later killed in an attempt on the land speed record when the car overturned. Rumours that a chain drive broke were found to be incorrect when the car was disinterred late in the 20th century as the chains were intact. At the other extreme, they also produced the Trojan Utility Car in the Kingston upon Thames factory at Ham from 1922 to 1928. Three generations of Spurriers controlled Leyland Motors from its foundation until the retirement of Henry Spurrier in 1964. Spurrier inherited control of Leyland Motors from his father in 1942, and successfully guided its growth during the postwar years. Whilst the Spurrier family were in control the company enjoyed excellent labour relations‚Äîreputedly never losing a day's production through industrial action. =World War II= During World War II, Leyland Motors, along with most vehicle manufacturers, was involved in war production. Leyland built the Cromwell tank at its works from 1943 as well as medium/large trucks such as the Hippo and Retriever. After the war, Leyland Motors continued military manufacture with the Centurion tank. =Post war= 1948 Leyland Beaver flatbed In 1946, AEC and Leyland Motors formed British United Traction to build trolleybuses. In 1955, through an equity agreement, manufacture of commercial vehicles under licence from Leyland Motors commenced in Madras, India at the new Ashok factory. The products were branded as Ashok Leyland. Leyland Motors acquired other companies in the post war years: * 1951: Albion Motors * 1953: Collaboration with Danish Automobile Building (DAB), a bus manufacturer, later with a majority stake in the 1970s * 1955: Scammell‚Äîmilitary and specialist lorry manufacturer * 1961: Standard-Triumph (Standard-Triumph International Limited), cars, vans and some agricultural machinery interestsReorganizing Standard Triumph The Times Tuesday, 22 August 1961; pg. 8; Issue 55166 =Holding company: Leyland Motor Corporation= Share of the Leyland Motor Corporation Ltd, issued 8.

Chronologically, the 1960s growth of Leyland Motor Corporation (LMC) was as follows: * 1962: Leyland Motors acquires Associated Commercial Vehicles (ACV), which incorporated AEC, Thornycroft, Park Royal Vehicles and Charles H Roe. * 1962 a new group holding company was incorporated to own Leyland Motors Limited, ACV and new acquisitionsChanges in Leyland Motors Group The Times, Thursday, 20 September 1962; pg. 19; Issue 55501 * 1965: Minority (25%) interests in Bristol Commercial Vehicles and Eastern Coach Works * 1966: Rover cars and their subsidiary car, aero-engine and armoured fighting vehicle manufacturer Alvis Car and Engineering Company * 1967: Aveling-Barford was acquired This company mainly made road rollers and dumper trucks. In 1968 Leyland Motors merged with British Motor Holdings (BMH) to form the British Leyland Motor Corporation (BLMC). BMH, which was the product of an earlier merger between the British Motor Corporation, the Pressed Steel Company and Jaguar, brought with it more marques, including Daimler, Guy, BMC, Austin, and Morris. Leyland diesel engines were used in Finnish Sisu and Vanaja lorries and buses in 1960s. =British Leyland era= BLMC logo The BLMC group was difficult to manage because of the many companies under its control, often making similar products. This, and other reasons, led to financial difficulties and in December 1974 British Leyland had to receive a guarantee from the British government. In 1975, after the publication of the Ryder Report and the company's bankruptcy, BLMC was nationalised as British Leyland (BL) and split into four divisions with the bus and truck production becoming the Leyland Truck & Bus division within the Land Rover Leyland Group. This division was split into Leyland Bus and Leyland Trucks in 1981. Leyland Trucks depended on British sales as well as export markets, mainly Commonwealth and ex-Commonwealth markets. The early 1980s were very hard, with export sales drying up in many places such as oil-dependent Nigeria. In 1986, BL changed its name to Rover Group. The equity stake in Ashok Leyland was controlled by Land Rover Leyland International Holdings, and sold in 1987. At this point, while building about 10,000 trucks per annum, Leyland was more and more depending on outside engines as production of their own 98-series was steadily declining. The 1986 closure of Bedford Vehicles's heavy truck plant further harmed Leyland, as they had been planning on selling axles and other components to the General Motors subsidiary. =Leyland name post-British Leyland= Buses The bus operations was sold in a management buyout to form Leyland Bus, and was subsequently bought by Volvo Buses in 1988, which discontinued most of its product range but adopted the Leyland Olympian. Volvo reengineered it as the first named Volvo Bus model, the Volvo Olympian, and aside from minor frame changes the major alterations were the fitment of Volvo axles, braking system, and controls. Both were the best selling double-deck bus chassis of their time. Trucks * 1987 The Leyland Trucks division of Rover Group (formerly BL) merged with DAF Trucks of The Netherlands, and was floated on the Dutch stock exchange as DAF NV. The new company traded as Leyland DAF in the UK, and as DAF elsewhere. * 1993 DAF NV went into bankruptcy. The UK truck division was bought through a management buyout and became Leyland Trucks. The van division was also bought through a management buy-out and became LDV. The spare parts operation, Multipart, was subject to a management buy-out, eventually becoming part of the LEX organisation. * 1998 Leyland Trucks was acquired by the US truck manufacturer Paccar. Leyland Trucks now operates as a division of Paccar from the Leyland Assembly Plant in North West England manufacturing around 14,000 trucks per year of which about a third are sold in the EU, though not with the name Leyland. =Ashok Leyland= Ashok Leyland Corporate Building in Chennai, India The Leyland name and logo continues as a recognised and respected marque across India, the wider subcontinent and parts of Africa in the form of Ashok Leyland. Part of the giant Hinduja Group, Ashok Leyland manufactures buses, trucks, defence vehicles and engines. The company is a leader in the heavy transportation sector within India and has an aggressive expansionary policy. In 1987 the London based Hinduja Group bought the Indian-based Ashok Leyland company. Today, Ashok-Leyland is pursuing a joint venture with Nissan, and through its acquisition of the Czech truck maker, Avia, is entering the European truck market directly. With its purchase of a 26% stake in UK-based bus manufacturer Optare in 2010, Ashok Leyland has taken a step closer to reconnecting with its British heritage, as Optare is a direct descendant of Leyland's UK bus-making division. On 21 December 2011, Ashok Leyland bought an additional 49% stake in Optare, bringing its total to 75%. Products A Kowloon Motor Bus 2-axle Leyland Olympian in Hong Kong =Buses= Historically, Leyland Motors was a major manufacturer of buses used in the United Kingdom and worldwide. It achieved a number of firsts or milestones that set trends for the bus industry. It was one of the first manufacturers to devise chassis designs for buses that were different from trucks, with a lower chassis level to help passengers board more easily. Its chief designer, John George Rackham, who had experience at the Yellow Coach Company in Chicago before returning to England, created the Titan and Tiger ranges in 1927 that revolutionised bus design. After 1945, Leyland created another milestone with the trend-setting Atlantean rear-engined double-decker bus design produced between 1956 and 1986. See List of Leyland buses for the list of bus products. =Trucks= 1920s * Q-type 4 ton * SQ2 7 ton * SWQ2 10-ton six-wheeler * Bull * Carrimore 4X2 * Roadwagon 1930s * Beaver * Bison * Buffalo * Bull * Llama * Hippo * Octopus 22-ton eight-wheeler * Steer * Lynx * Cub * Badger * Overseas Roadtrain 1940s * Comet * Hippo * Beaver 1950s * Martian 1960s Leyland FG Leyland Terrier * Leyland 90 * Beaver * Retriever * Comet * Laird * Steer (1966, Ergomatic) * Gas Turbine * FG * Lynx 1970s * Cruiser * Harrier * Terrier (G-series) * Firemaster * Boxer (G-series) * Landmaster * Clydesdale (G-series) * Chieftain * Mastiff (G-series) * Reiver (G-series) * Marathon (Ergomatic) * Bison (Ergomatic) * Buffalo (Ergomatic) The G-series cab was built in Bathgate and was available with several different names, such as Terrier, Clydesdale, and Reiver. After this cab was replaced the tooling was shipped to Turkey, where BMC's Turkish subsidiary built it as the \\"BMC Yavuz\\" and then as the \\"Fatih\\" (with Cummins engines) from 1986 until 1996. The Marathon was Leyland's answer to the booming \\"max cap\\" truck fad at the start of the 1970s. Imports such as the Volvo F88 and Scania 110/140 were selling very well in the UK thanks to the previously unheard of levels of driver comfort, reliability, quality and performance. Leyland had insufficient money for development of a complete new vehicle at the time, so designers were instructed to utilise as many existing in-house components as possible. It was perceived at the time that the resulting model would be a stopgap until the new T45 range was ready for production toward the latter half of the 1970s. A 1979 model of the short- lived redesigned Marathon 2 The cab was a re-worked version of the \\"Ergomatic\\" tilt cab of 1965, heavily modified with different lower panels, raised height etc., and was available in day and sleeper cab form. Engines were decided from the outset to be in the higher power category to be competitive with rival vehicles. The only existing engine within the Leyland empire suitable for such an application (following the demise of the ill-fated fixed-head 500 series and AEC's underdeveloped and unreliable V8) was the AEC AV760 straight-six, which was turbocharged and designated as the TL12. Other engine options included a 200 bhp Leyland L11, as well as Cummins 10- and 14-litre engines at 250 and 330 bhp, respectively. Production began in 1973, and various shortcomings were noted, including below-par heating and ventilation, and pronounced cab roll. However, road testers of the time were very impressed by the truck's power and performance. In 1977, the redesigned \\"Marathon 2\\" was launched, an updated and revised vehicle that attempted to address some of the previous criticisms of the earlier vehicle. Relatively few Marathons of all types were sold before production ended in 1979 with the introduction of the T45 \\"roadtrain\\" range of vehicles. 1980s ;Roadrunner This was Leyland's answer to the Ford cargo in the non-HGV 7.5-ton truck sector. Launched in 1984, it utilised a Leyland 698 straight-six engine until 1986, when a 5.9 L Cummins was introduced. It was notable at the time for its low- level passenger side windscreen, featured as a safety aid to enable the driver to see the kerb, although this was removed on later models. The basic cab had a long service life, becoming later on the Leyland DAF 45. ;Constructor The Leyland Constructor was a 6x4, three axle wagon with gross weight up to 24 tonnes used as a tipper or on short haul distribution duties. ;Roadtrain 1988 T45 Roadtrain tractor unit The Leyland Roadtrain was a range of heavy goods vehicle tractor units manufactured by Leyland Trucks between 1980 and 1990. The nomenclature \\"T45\\" refers to the truck range as a whole and encompasses models such as the lightweight 7.5-ton Roadrunner, Freighter (fourwheel rigid truck), Constructor (multi-axle rigid tipper or mixer chassis ‚Äì its chassis owing much to the outgoing Scammell 8-wheeler Routeman), and Cruiser (basic spec low weight tractor unit). The Roadtrain itself was a max weight model with distance work in mind. The T45's cab is called the C40 and its design was a joint effort between Leyland, BRS and Ogle Design and was seen as the height of modernity when compared with its predecessors, the idea being to have one basic design to replace the various outgoing models (for example, the Bathgate built the G cab on the Terrier, the Ergomatic cabbed the Lynx, Beaver etc.). This did indeed make good economic sense; however, there has been speculation that Leyland did in fact alienate a number of customers who had traditionally purchased other marques from within the Leyland empire‚ÄîAlbion, AEC, Scammell, etcetera ‚Äì who were now left with no alternative but to have a Leyland-branded vehicle or purchase from elsewhere. Some Constructors, with their Scammell- based chassis, were built with Scammell badging as well. Throughout its production run, engine choices included the AEC-based TL12, a straight carry over from the preceding \\"stopgap\\" model Marathon range, The Rolls-Royce Eagle 265/300 and the Cummins 290 L10 and 14-litre 350 coupled to a Spicer or Eaton transmission, although all versions produced a distinctive whine from the propshaft knuckle joint when approaching . The TL12 engine was dropped early on in the production run, with most large fleet buyers choosing the Rolls- Royce engine. The Roadtrain was available in day- and sleeper-cabbed form, in high and low datum versions‚Äîthis refers to the cab height‚Äîhigh datum versions were intended as long haul vehicles with higher mounted cabs and more internal space. 6x2 versions were built in high cab form only on a chassis that was basically that of the ageing Scammell trunker. The Constructor's chassis was entirely Routeman behind the cab, albeit with altered suspension and with the front chassis rails splayed wider apart to fit the new C40 cab. In 1986, the high roofed Roadtrain interstate was introduced, a top of the range long distance truck with standing room inside. The Roadtrain was a common sight throughout most of the 1980s, with a great many of the major fleet users in the UK such as Tesco, Blue Circle Industries (unusually with high datum day cabs) and BRS running them. The firm of Swain's based in Rochester, Kent had a number of roadtrains in its fleet which enjoyed a comparatively long service life (until the late 1990s) before being replaced by the newer DAF 85. Sales were never quite satisfactory, however, with the vacation closure extended in 1986 to reduce unsold stock. Production ended in 1990 with the sale of Leyland Trucks to Dutch firm DAF, although as a postscript DAF relaunched the model in low-datum form (it was already manufacturing the large DAF 95) as the DAF 80, using the Roadtrain cab with the DAF 330 ATi engine (quite ironic, given that this engine had its roots in the Leyland O.680). This model was produced for a relatively short time until 1993 with the launch of the brand new cabbed DAF 85. Due partly to the cab's propensity to rust and also to the admittedly short life of commercial vehicles, any Roadtrain in commercial operation is now a very rare sight indeed. However, a small number remain in use throughout the country as towing-and-recovery vehicles. The army made use of an 8x6 version of the Roadtrain as a hook loader until recently. This is known to the British Army as Demountable Rack Offload and Pickup System (DROPS), which has seen action in Iraq and Afghanistan and is still in service, but is due to be replaced by the MAN version. ;Comet The Leyland Comet was introduced in 1986, specifically designed for export markets mainly in the developing world. As such, it was a no-frills vehicle of a simple and sturdy design, with five- or six-speed transmissions rather than the multi-speed units used on European models. The cabin was a simplified all-steel version of that used by the Roadrunner, designed to enable local assembly. The three-axle version is called the Super Comet. =Diesel multiple units= * British United Traction DMUs * British Rail Class 141 * British Rail Class 142 * British Rail Class 155 See also * Ashok Leyland * British Leyland Motor Corporation * Leyland Band * Leyland Bus * Leyland Trucks * List of car manufacturers of the United Kingdom References * Jack, Doug (1984).

The idea that the output of a function at any time depends only on past and present values of input is defined by the property commonly referred to as causality. A system that has some dependence on input values from the future (in addition to possible dependence on past or current input values) is termed a non-causal or acausal system, and a system that depends solely on future input values is an anticausal system. Note that some authors have defined an anticausal system as one that depends solely on future and present input values or, more simply, as a system that does not depend on past input values. Classically, nature or physical reality has been considered to be a causal system. Physics involving special relativity or general relativity require more careful definitions of causality, as described elaborately in Causality (physics). The causality of systems also plays an important role in digital signal processing, where filters are constructed so that they are causal, sometimes by altering a non- causal formulation to remove the lack of causality so that it is realizable. For more information, see causal filter. For a causal system, the impulse response of the system must use only the present and past values of the input to determine the output. This requirement is a necessary and sufficient condition for a system to be causal, regardless of linearity. Note that similar rules apply to either discrete or continuous cases. By this definition of requiring no future input values, systems must be causal to process signals in real time.  Mathematical definitions  Definition 1: A system mapping x to y is causal if and only if, for any pair of input signals x_{1}(t), x_{2}(t) and any choice of t_{0}, such that :x_{1}(t) = x_{2}(t), \\\\quad \\\\forall \\\\ t < t_{0}, the corresponding outputs satisfy :y_{1}(t) = y_{2}(t), \\\\quad \\\\forall \\\\ t < t_{0}. Definition 2: Suppose h(t) is the impulse response of any system H described by a linear constant coefficient differential equation.

As the light travels through multiple gas clouds with different redshifts, multiple absorption lines are formed. History The Lyman-alpha forest was first discovered in 1970 by astronomer Roger Lynds in an observation of the quasar 4C 05.34. Quasar 4C 05.34 was the farthest object observed to that date, and Lynds noted an unusually large number of absorption lines in its spectrum. He suggested that most of the absorption lines were all due to the same Lyman-alpha transition. Follow-up observations by John Bahcall and Samuel Goldsmith confirmed the presence of the unusual absorption lines, though they were less conclusive about the origin of the lines. Subsequently, the spectra of many other high-redshift quasars were observed to have the same system of narrow absorption lines. Lynds was the first to describe them as the \\"Lyman-alpha forest\\". Jan Oort argued that the absorption features are due not to any physical interactions within the quasars themselves, but to absorption inside clouds of intergalactic gas in superclusters. Physical background For a neutral hydrogen atom, spectral lines are formed when an electron transitions between energy levels. The Lyman series of spectral lines are produced by electrons transitioning between the ground state and higher energy levels (excited states). The Lyman-alpha transition corresponds to an electron transitioning between the ground state (n = 1) and the first excited state (n = 2). The Lyman-alpha spectral line has a laboratory, or rest, wavelength of 1216 √Ö, which is in the ultraviolet portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. The Lyman-alpha absorption lines in the quasar spectra result from intergalactic gas through which the galaxy or quasar's light has traveled. Since neutral hydrogen clouds in the intergalactic medium are at different degrees of redshift (due to their varying distance from Earth), their absorption lines are observed at a range of wavelengths. Each individual cloud leaves its fingerprint as an absorption line at a different position in the observed spectrum. Use as a tool in astrophysics The Lyman-alpha forest is an important probe of the intergalactic medium and can be used to determine the frequency and density of clouds containing neutral hydrogen, as well as their temperature. Searching for lines from other elements like helium, carbon and silicon (matching in redshift), the abundance of heavier elements in the clouds can also be studied. A cloud with a high column density of neutral hydrogen will show typical damping wings around the line and is referred to as a damped Lyman-alpha system. For quasars at higher redshift the number of lines in the forest is higher, until at a redshift of about 6, where there is so much neutral hydrogen in the intergalactic medium that the forest turns into a Gunn‚ÄìPeterson trough. This shows the end of the reionization of the universe. The Lyman-alpha forest observations can be used to constrain cosmological models.

It may be served with no topping, topped with a meringue topping made from the egg whites, or with whipped cream; it may be cooked in a pie crust, graham cracker crust, or no crust. The dish is named after the small Key limes, which are more aromatic than the common Persian limes, and which have yellow, not green, juice. The filling in a Key lime pie is also yellow, largely because of the egg yolks. The filling is made by simply mixing the ingredients without cooking: the proteins of the egg yolks and condensed milk and the acidic lime juice curdle, thickening the mixture without baking. Today, key lime pies are usually baked to pasteurize the eggs and thicken the filling further. History The Key lime pie is probably a direct descendant of the Magic Lemon Cream Pie, invented in 1931 in the test kitchens of Borden, the leading producer of condensed milk, and attributed to their fictional spokesperson, Jane Ellison. A \\"Tropical Lime Chiffon Pie\\", using condensed milk and egg yolks, is documented in a 1933 Miami newspaper article. Quoted in An \\"icebox lime pie\\", was mentioned as a specialty of the Florida Keys in 1935.Highway Traveler and a recipe under the name \\"Key Lime Pie\\" was published in 1940.June Brown, Buffalo, New York No earlier solid sources are known, despite appeals to the public. A 1927 Key West Women's Club cookbook does not mention the recipe. A 1926 restaurant menu includes \\"lime pie\\", but it is unclear what it was. Various accounts claim that it was known earlier, but none were recorded before 1933. A widely-reported story claims that William Curry's cook Aunt Sally invented it in the late 19th century. But there is no evidence for this, and the oldest version of this story dates to only 1995, in promotional materials for a Bed and Breakfast in Curry's former house. It was in the 1950s that Key lime pie was promoted as Florida's \\"most famous treat\\" and in 1987 as \\"the greatest of all regional American desserts.\\" Key limes Key lime (Citrus aurantifolia 'Swingle') is naturalized throughout the Florida Keys. While their thorns make them less tractable, and their thin, yellow rinds more perishable, Key limes are more tart and more aromatic than the common Persian limes seen year-round at grocery stores in the United States. Key limes have not been grown commercially in the U.S. since the 1926 Miami hurricane; they are generally imported from Central or South America. Key lime juice, unlike regular lime juice, is a pale yellow. Bottled Key lime juice, invariably from concentrate, is widely available at retail in the United States. Legislation In 1965, Florida State Representative Bernie Papy, Jr. introduced geographical indication legislation calling for a $100 fine to be levied against anyone advertising Key lime pie not made with Key limes. The bill failed. On July 1, 2006, the Florida House of Representatives and the Florida Senate both passed legislation {HB 453} and {SB 676} selecting \\"Key lime pie\\" as the official pie of the state of Florida.

Minors have been recruited to attack Israeli targets, both military and civilian, especially during the Second Intifada from 2000 to 2005. This deliberate involvement of children in armed conflict has been condemned by International human rights organizations. According to Amnesty International, \\"Palestinian armed groups have repeatedly shown total disregard for the most fundamental human rights, notably the right to life, by deliberately targeting Israeli civilians and by using Palestinian children in armed attacks. Children are susceptible to recruitment by manipulation or may be driven to join armed groups for a variety of reasons, including a desire to avenge relatives or friends killed by the Israeli army.\\" History According to the Coalition to Stop the Use of Child Soldiers \\"2004 Global Report on the Use of Child Soldiers\\", there were at least nine documented suicide attacks involving Palestinian minors between October 2000 and March 2004 p. 292\\\\. In 2004, the Coalition to Stop the Use of Child Soldiers reported that \\"there was no evidence of systematic recruitment of children by Palestinian armed groups,\\" also noting that this remains a small fraction of the problem in other conflict zones such as Africa, where there are an estimated 20,000 children involved in active combat roles in the Sudan alone. Human Rights Watch also reported that \\"there was no evidence that the Palestinian Authority (PA) recruited or used child soldiers.\\" According to the Palestinian Human Rights Monitoring Group, in the al-Aqsa Intifada, children were used as \\"messengers and couriers, and in some cases as fighters and suicide bombers in attacks on Israeli soldiers and civilians\\" during the al-Aqsa Intifada. Fatah, Hamas, Palestinian Islamic Jihad Movement and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine have all been implicated in involving children in this way. The issue was brought to world attention after a widely televised incident in which a mentally handicapped Palestinian teenager, Hussam Abdo, was disarmed at an Israeli checkpoint. The youngest Palestinian suicide bomber who blew himself up was Issa Bdeir, a 16-year-old high school student from the village of Al Doha. He blew himself up in a park in Rishon LeZion, killing a teenage boy and an elderly man. According to the Israel Defense Forces, 29 suicide attacks were carried out by youth under the age of 18 in 2000‚Äì2003. From May 2001, 22 shootings attacks and attacks using explosive devices were carried out by youth under the age of 18, and more than 40 youths under the age of 18 were involved in attempted suicide bombings that were thwarted (three in 2004). On March 24, 2004, one week after capturing a bomb in the bag of 12-year-old Abdullah Quran, Hussam Abdo, a 16-year-old Palestinian (who initially claimed he was 14), was captured in a checkpoint near Nablus wearing an explosive belt. The young boy was paid by the Tanzim militia to detonate himself at the checkpoint. IDF soldiers manning the checkpoint were suspicious of him and told him to stay away from people. Later, an EOD team arrived and by using a police-sapper robot, removed the explosive belt from him. Hussam explained that he was offered 100 NIS and sex with virgins if he would perform the task. He said his friends mocked him in class. On May 30, 2004, The New York Times reported Israeli allegations that the al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades were using children to recruit classmates as suicide bombers, and that one child, Nasser Awartani, 15, of Nablus allegedly recruited four of his classmates, one of whom was claimed by the Shabak report on Awartani to be Hussam Abdo. On June 16, 2004, two girls, aged 14 and 15, were arrested by the IDF for allegedly plotting a suicide bombing. According to an IDF statement, the two children were recruited by activists from Tanzim (Fatah's armed wing), guided by Hezbollah. On July 3, the Israeli Security Forces thwarted a suicide bombing that it claimed was to have been carried out by 16-year-old Muataz Takhsin Karini. Karini and two of his operators were arrested, while a 12 kg explosive belt was detonated safely by an Israeli EOD crew. On June 5, IDF forces detonated two explosive belts concealed in schoolbags. On July 14, the Shin Bet in Kfar Maskha arrested 17-year-old suicide bomber Ahmed Bushkar, from Nablus. On September 23, 2004, a day before Yom Kippur, the Shin Bet and the Israel Police announced their capture of a 15-year-old suicide bomber and a 7 kg explosive belt in the village of Dir-Hana in the Western Galilee. The 15-year-old was part of joint terrorist cell of Tanzim and Palestinian Islamic Jihad from Yamon village near Jenin. The four were Palestinians who worked illegally in Israel. The 15-year-old was allegedly paid 1000 shekels in order to blow himself up in Afula. According to a Shabak report published on September 26, 2004, about 292 Palestinian children have been involved in terrorism. On September 27, 2004, a 15-year-old suspected suicide bomber was arrested in Nablus. On October 28, Ayub Maaruf, a 16-year-old Fatah suicide bomber, was arrested near Nablus along with his operator. On November 1, 16-year-old Aamer Alfar blew himself up in Tel Aviv's Carmel Market, killing 3 Israelis in a suicide bombing that was claimed by the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine. Alfar's mother and father condemned what they saw as the exploitation of their son: > God will curse those who recruited Amar. I had heard the stories about > recruiting children in Nablus but I didn't think they were true... Yes, it > is difficult here for everyone because of the occupation, and life in Nablus > is intolerable, but children should not be exploited in this way. On November 4, a 15-year-old suicide bomber was arrested in Nablus. On February 3, 2005, Mahmoud Tabouq, a 15- or 16-year-old Palestinian, was arrested at the Huwara checkpoint near Nablus carrying a bag containing an explosive belt, an improvised gun, and 20 bullets. The belt was detonated safely by a Magav bomb squad. Video available. On April 12, a 15-year-old Palestinian boy identified as Hassan Hashash was caught at Huwara checkpoint hiding five pipe bombs under his coat. He tried to ignite them with a match when the soldiers apprehended him. Later he was disarmed, and sappers detonated the bombs safely. Family members of Hashash suggested that he deliberately carried bombs into an IDF checkpoint in order to be arrested and study for the \\"Bagrut\\" final exams in the Israeli jail. A week later, another Palestinian youth (aged 17) was caught carrying explosives in Beit Furik checkpoint. On April 27, two teenagers, aged 15 (though other sources cite their ages as 12 and 13), were arrested at a checkpoint near Jenin after 11 explosive charges were found on them. One teenager was recruited by the Palestinian Islamic Jihad and the other by the al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades. The two told interrogators that they had been acting as couriers for terrorists, but security forces suspect they planned to get close to the soldiers and then detonate the charges. On May 22, Iad Ladi, a 14- or 15-year-old Palestinian suicide bomber was arrested at a Huwara checkpoint near Nablus. This was the 14th time during April and May that a Palestinian child was arrested as a bomber or a courier. Two days later, another 15-year-old Palestinian teen carrying two pipe bombs, was caught at the same checkpoint. On June 15, The Israeli press reported that the Shabak arrested a Palestinian militant cell in Nablus during the previous month. The cell included eight members, four of whom were child suicide bombers. The cell was on the verge of committing another suicide bombing attack using the four children. According to the Shin Bet, the cell was directed and funded by the Fatah's Tanzim branch and the Lebanese group Hezbollah. On October 11, a 14-year-old Palestinian boy was arrested by IDF forces. He told the soldiers he was forced to agree to commit a suicide bombing when two terrorists from Fatah's Tanzim faction threatened to murder him by spreading a leaflet accusing him of collaboration unless he agreed. They took pictures of him with a gun and the Qur'an and forced him to write his own will. On August 27, a 15-year-old Palestinian boy carrying two explosive devices on his body was arrested in the northern Gaza Strip after he attempted to carry out an attack against soldiers operating in the area against Palestinians launching Qassam rockets on Israeli civilians across the border inside Israel. Use of indoctrination According to emeritus professor of psychiatry at the University of Virginia School of Medicine Vamik Volkan, > Most suicide bombers in the Middle East are chosen as teenagers, \\"educated\\", > and then sent off to perform their duty when they are in their late teens or > early to mid-twenties. The \\"education\\" is most effective when religious > elements of the large-group identity are provided as solutions for the > personal sense of helplessness, shame, and humiliation. Replacing borrowed > elements sanctioned by God for one's internal world makes that person > omnipotent and supports the individual's narcissism. I found that there was > little difficulty in finding young men interested in becoming suicide > bombers in Gaza and the West Bank. Repeated actual and expected events > humiliate youngsters and interfere with their adaptive identifications with > their parents because their parents are humiliated as well.Vamik D. Volkan: > Suicide Bombers University of Virginia Volkan gives the examples of beatings, torture, or the loss of a parent as typical humiliating events that might make a young person more susceptible to recruitment for suicide terrorism. Once recruited, children and teenagers are encouraged to cut off contact with \\"real world\\" affairs and subjected to an intense program of memorization and repetition of the Qur'an based more on sound than on meaning. > The typical technique of creating Middle Eastern Muslim suicide bombers > includes two basic steps: first, the \\"teachers\\" find young people whose > personal identity is already disturbed and who are seeking an outer > \\"element\\" to internalize so they can stabilize their internal world. Second, > they develop a \\"teaching method\\" that \\"forces\\" the large-group identity, > ethnic and/or religious, into the \\"cracks\\" of the person's damaged or > subjugated individual identity. Once people become candidates to be suicide > bombers, the routine rules and regulations, so to speak, or individual > psychology does not fully apply to their patterns of thought and action. Anne Speckhard, adjunct associate Professor of Psychiatry, Georgetown University Medical Center and Professor of Psychology, Vesalius College, Free University of Brussels, writes: > In the Palestinian territories, there currently exists a \\"cult of > martyrdom\\". From a very young age children are socialized into a group > consciousness that honors \\"martyrs\\", including human bombers who have given > their lives for the fight against what is perceived by Palestinians to be > the unjust occupation of their lands. Young children are told stories of > \\"martyrs\\". Many young people wear necklaces venerating particular \\"martyrs\\", > posters decorate the walls of towns and rock and music videos extol the > virtues of bombers. Each act of suicide terrorism is also marked by a last > testament and video, which are prepared ahead of time by the \\"martyr\\" who > can later reach great popularity when the video is played on television. > Despite the very deep and real grief of the family and friends left behind, > the funerals of \\"martyrs\\" are generally accompanied with much fanfare by > community and sponsoring organization. Often, the effect of this is > confusing to outsiders as it can disrupt, delay and even circumvent the > family's ability to focus on its grief over the loss of a family member and > it may even support the family in claiming to outsiders joy over the loss of > its loved one. This \\"cult of martyrdom\\", which has a strong underpinning in > longstanding cultural roots (the honoring of martyrs), appears to have > developed principally over the last decade, as the first act of suicide > terrorism occurred in Israel only twelve years ago. Umm Nidal, who sent three of her sons, including one 17-year-old, on suicide attacks, said \\"I love my children, but as Muslims we pressure ourselves and sacrifice our emotions for the interest of the homeland. The greater interest takes precedence to the personal interest.\\" She was later elected to the Palestinian legislature on the Hamas ticket. According to Human Rights Watch, > Major Palestinian armed groups, including Al-Aqsa Martyrs Brigade, the > Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, Islamic Jihad, and Hamas, > have publicly disavowed the use of children in military operations, but > those stated policies have not always been implemented. Some leaders, > including representatives of Islamic Jihad and Hamas, have said that they > consider children of 16 to be adults. International law defines a child as > any person under the age of eighteen. [...] Israeli government policy in the > Occupied Territories defines Palestinians under the age of 16 as minors > while Israeli children in the same territories are considered minors until > they reach the age of 18. Baby Suicide Bomber photo The Baby Suicide Bomber refers to a photo that received media attention in 2002. During a search done June 29, 2002, of a house belonging to a Hamas militant in the town of Hebron, The IDF claims to have found a photo showing an 18-month infant standing wide-eyed in a baby suit, Red wires strapped to his waist, with a pretend explosives belt, and across his head tied a red bandana of Hamas. According to BBC News the baby's grandfather, Redwan Abu Turki, said that the dressing of the infant baby as a bomber was from a rally at the university and \\"the picture was taken just for the fun of it.\\" Israeli newspapers published the photograph under headlines such as \\"Terror in Diapers\\"\\"Terror in Diapers\\" (photo caption), Maariv, as cited by Photo of baby suicide bomber called 'a joke', CNN, published June 29, 2002 and \\"Born to Kill\\".\\"Born to kill\\" (photo caption), The Jerusalem Post, June 28, 2002 Israeli Prime Minister Sharon's advisor Dore Gold said the picture \\"symbolizes the hatred and incitement which the Palestinian leadership has been feeding a whole generation of Palestinian youths.\\" At the U.S. State Department, spokesman Richard Boucher stated that he considered the image as \\"a highly objectionable display\\".Excerpts: June 28, 2002 Press Briefing, The Office of Electronic Information, Bureau of Public Affairs on behalf of the U.S. State Department, June 28, 2002 While Palestinian officials dismissed it as a propaganda trick, Haaretz reported that a Palestinian journalist in the Hebron area said she did not believe the picture was a fake and expressed surprise at the furor it caused in Israel Other photos of children dressed up as militants have been published since then.

Brokoff was of Carpathian German origin, born in Spi≈°sk√° Sobota, today in Slovakia, then in Royal Hungary, and later working and living in Bohemia. He was the father of the sculptors Michael Brokoff and Ferdinand Brokoff. In 1675 Brokoff moved from Hungary and worked at various places mainly in western Bohemia. Three years later, in 1692 he settled in Prague and gained burgher rights in Prague's Star√© mƒõsto (Old Town). He and his wife Elisabeth () born Spingler had four children - sons, Michal Jan Josef, Ferdinand Maxmilian and Antonin Sebastian, and a daughter, Anna Eleonora. Two of the sons continued in his work (and the younger, Ferdinand Maxmilian, becoming the more prominent), the third son, Anton√≠n Sebastian, later became the court poet in Vienna. Jan Brokoff died in Prague. Work Statue of Triton in Kl√°≈°terec nad Oh≈ô√≠ castle park - 1685 Statue of John of Nepomuk (1683) on the Charles Bridge, Prague The works attributed to him are of two kinds: some he made himself, others he only designed and let his son Ferdinand actually make them. Brokoff created the statuary of Lamenting of the Christ (Czech: Pieta) placed on the Charles Bridge in 1695, however this sculpture has been later (1859) moved to the Monastery of the Gracious Sisters of Charles Borromei (Sorores Misericordiae Congregationis S.

Prior to his conversion to Islam, Yousuf was one of the few Christians to play for the Pakistan national cricket team. Yousuf scored 1,788 runs in 2006 which is a world record for most runs scored in a year in tests at an average of almost 100. Yousuf was banned from playing international cricket for Pakistan by the Pakistan Cricket Board on 10 March 2010, following an inquiry into the team's defeats during the tour of Australia. An official statement was released by the Pakistan Cricket Board, saying that he would not be selected again because he had created disciplinary problems and infighting within the team. In reaction to the ban, Yousuf announced his retirement from international cricket on 29 March 2010. However, following Pakistan's disastrous first Test against England in July/August 2010, PCB decided to ask Yousuf to come out of retirement. Early life Yousuf was born in Lahore, Punjab, Pakistan to a Punjabi Christian family. His father Youhana Maseeh was formerly a Hindu Dalit (Chuhra) who converted into Christianity. He worked at the railway station, the family lived in the nearby Railway Colony. As a boy, he couldn't afford a bat and so swatted his brother's taped tennis ball offerings with wooden planks of various dimensions on surfaces masquerading as roads. As a 12-year- old, he was spotted by the Golden Gymkhana, though even then only circumstances dictated his ambitions and never thought of playing cricket, to make a living. He joined Lahore's Forman Christian College and continued playing until suddenly giving up in early 1994. Yousuf, hailing from a poor background, was plucked from the obscurity of a tailor's shop in the slums of the eastern city of Lahore to play a local match in the 1990s. His well- crafted shots attracted attention and he rose through the ranks to become one of Pakistan's best batsmen. He was set to work at a tailor's when he was pulled back by a local club was short of players. They called him to make up numbers and made a hundred which led to a season in the Bradford Cricket League, with Bowling Old Lane, and a path back into the game. Conversion to Islam Until his conversion to Islam in 2001, Yousuf was the fourth Christian (and fifth non-Muslim overall) to play for the Pakistan cricket team, following in the footsteps of Wallis Mathias, Antao D'Souza and the Anglo- Pakistani Duncan Sharpe. He also has the distinction of being the first and so far only non-Muslim to captain the country, leading the team in the 2004‚Äì05 tour of Australia where he scored a century in the Boxing Day Test at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. He converted to Islam after attending regular preaching sessions of the Tablighi Jamaat, Pakistan's largest non-political religious grouping, whose preachers include Yousuf's former teammate Saeed Anwar and his brother. His wife Tania converted along with him and adopted the Islamic name Fatima. However, the news was kept private for three years due to family reasons as well as his own decision to practice his faith, before his announcement of their conversion publicly in September 2005. \\"I don't want to give Yousuf my name after what he has done\\", his mother was quoted as saying by the Daily Times newspaper. \\"We came to know about his decision when he offered Friday prayers at a local mosque. It was a shock\\", his mother was reported as saying. However, Yousuf told the BBC that \\"I cannot tell you what a great feeling it is.\\" As part of his conversion, Yousuf officially changed his name from Yousuf Youhana to Mohammad Yousuf. Former Pakistan cricketer and sports commentator Rameez Raja, who himself is Muslim, acknowledged the significance of Yousuf's new faith: \\"Religion has played an integral part in his growth not just as a cricketer but as a person.\\"  International career  =Early days= He made his Test debut against South Africa in Durban and One Day International debut against Zimbabwe in Harare. He has scored over 9,000 One Day International runs at an average above 40 and over 7,000 Test runs at an average above 50 (2nd highest batting average amongst all Pakistani batsmen) with 24 Test centuries. He has the record of scoring the most runs without being dismissed in the One Day International match, with a total of 405 runs against Zimbabwe in Zimbabwe in 2002‚Äì2003. He has also scored a 23-ball fifty and a 68-ball hundred in One Day International. In Test match, he has scored a 27-ball fifty, which is 3rd fastest by any player. He was the top scorer during the successive years of 2002 and 2003 in the world in One Day International match. In 2004, he scored 111 runs against the Australians in the Boxing Day Test. In December 2005, he scored 223 runs against England at Lahore, also earning him the man of the match award. Seven months later in July 2006, when Pakistan toured England, he scored 202 runs and 48 in the first Test, again earning himself the man of the match award. He followed up with 192 in the third Test at Headingley and 128 in the final Test at The Oval. =Rise in ranks= Yousuf was named CNN-IBN's Cricketer of the Year for 2006, ahead of the likes of Australian captain Ricky Ponting, West Indies Brian Lara, Australian spinner Shane Warne, South Africa's bowling spearhead Makhaya Ntini and Sri Lanka's Muttiah Muralitharan. He was selected as a Wisden Cricketer of the Year in the 2007 edition. Yousuf became the fourth recipient of the ICC 'Test Cricketer of the Year' award for 2007, he scored 944 runs at an average of 94.40 including seven centuries and two fifties in just 10 innings and that was enough to be awarded the honour ahead of English batsman Kevin Pietersen and Australian batsman Ricky Ponting. A year that started on a promising note, Yousuf carried it forward to break two world records both held earlier by former West Indian batsman Viv Richards. The 32-year-old, Pakistani batsman achieved an unparalleled 1788 runs in just 10 Test matches with the help of twelve centuries which became his second world record. Yousuf is known for his ability to score runs at exceptional rate through his great technique and composed strokeplay. Although capable of hitting the ball hard, Yousuf is quick between the wickets, although he is prone to being run out. = Golden 2006 = Statistically, the year 2006 is said to be the year of Australia, Muttiah Muralitharan and Yousuf. Yousuf scored 1788 runs at an average of 99.33 in 2006 and broke two of Viv Richards's world records.A year dominated by Yousuf, Murali and Australia. Cricinfo.com. Retrieved on 9 February 2007.

He is also distinguished by his characteristic celebration after hitting one hundred runs for his country, where he prostrates in thankfulness to Allah in the direction of Mecca. He has observed this act (known as the Sajdah) since his conversion to Islam. = Retirement and subsequent return = On 29 March 2010, Yousuf announced his retirement from international cricket, two days after the Pakistan Cricket Board imposed an indefinite ban on him. \\"I received a letter from the PCB that my staying in the team is harmful for the team, so I announce my retirement from international cricket\\", he said at a press conference in Karachi. On 27 March, Yousuf said that he had decided to retire from international cricket. \\"Yes, I have decided to retire as Pakistan player and my decision is not an emotional one\\", Yousuf told press agency AFP, \\"It's of no use playing if my playing is harmful to the team\\". He was placed under an indefinite ban by the Pakistan Cricket Board for his disciplinary problems on Pakistan's tour of Australia 2009‚Äì2010. On 1 August 2010, after Pakistan lost the first Test match against England at Trent Bridge, Nottingham, Yousuf was called back in the squad for the rest of the series. He decided not to play the second Test because of tiredness and jet lag.https://www.espncricinfo.com/story/_/id/22523989/tired-mohammad-yousuf- not-play-second-test Shortly after the completion of the second test, Pakistani captain Salman Butt announced that he expected Yousuf to return for the third test. The selectors decided to play Yousuf in a tour match against Worcestershire just before the third Test so that his form and fitness could be checked. Yousuf's form check was positive, because on a day inflicted by rain he managed to score 40*. Yousuf then scored 56 against England in the third Test before being caught and bowled by Graeme Swann; in the process Yousuf became Swann's 100th casualty in Test cricket;the day saw a much improved performance by Pakistan as they were eventually bowled out for 308. In the same tour of England that summer, he participated in the Twenty20 series as well. Despite being considered an \\"old boys cricketer\\" and having participated in only a sole T20I in 2006 and considered one who does not slog as often (notable by the low number of sixes he has scored), Yousuf participated and scored 26 off 21 deliveries. His return continued well when he scored 46 in the second ODI against England. He consistently scored during the five-match England series as Pakistan lost 3‚Äì2. Yousuf was subsequently selected to play for Pakistan in all three formats against South Africa in October 2010; he was considered as an option for becoming captain but the captaincy was given Misbah-ul-Haq Yousuf's batting partner Younis Khan; however he was not selected. Controversy In 2007, after initially signing a contract to join the Indian Cricket League, Yousuf later refused due to pressure from the Pakistan Cricket Board as he would later face a ban by the board. In return the PCB promised to get him into the Indian premier league, however, no team bid for him as he faced litigation from the ICL. In 2008, he once again threatened to join the ICL after the PCB dropped him from their squad. A PCB official was quoted as saying, \\"We have banned all our cricketers who joined the ICL and if Yousuf also plays for the unauthorised league then he will have to face the same punishment. Yousuf is still our best Test batsman and has a future with the Pakistan team, but not if he joins the ICL.\\" Yousuf decided to join the ICL again to play mid-way through the second season. The Pakistan Cricket Board reacted to the news by banning him from the national team. Yousaf's chances to return to Pakistani cricket improved on 2 February 2009 when a Pakistani court suspended the ban on ICL players. Pakistan Cricket Board recalled batsman Mohammad Yousuf to the squad for their July 2009 Test series in Sri Lanka. Yousuf ended his association with the unsanctioned Indian Cricket League (ICL) in early May, in the hope of earning a recall for his country. His decision to join the ICL was made because of differences with former captain Shoaib Malik, who has since been replaced by Younus Khan. In July 2009, on his first match after returning to Test Cricket since 2007, Yousuf scored a century to announce his return to cricket. Yousuf informed the Pakistan Cricket Board that he would not be taking part in the Champions Trophy 2008 because it would coincide with the holy month of Ramadan. He along with another former Indian Cricket League player Abdul Razzaq were awarded ‚ÄòA‚Äô category mid-term central contracts by Pakistan Cricket Board after they left Indian Cricket League. A little over one year after being welcomed back by the PCB, Yousuf was made captain of the Test team for the tour of New Zealand after Younus Khan was allowed to take a break. The Pakistan Cricket Board, on 10 March 2010, banned Yousuf and former captain, Younis Khan from playing for the national team indefinitely and imposed one- year bans on Shoaib Malik and Rana Naved-ul-Hasan. Despite receiving the ban Yousuf said that the series against South Africa in late 2010 could be a possibility. Pakistan then toured England in July 2010 and after losing the first test by 354 runs due to a weak batting line-up, the second innings total of 80 being the lowest total by Pakistan against England. Yousuf announced his return to International Cricket and was placed on the squad. He then required a visa which was granted but there was a concern that Yousuf could not come to England in time for that tour. Yousuf captained his domestic team, the Lahore Lions, to victory in the 2010‚Äì11 Faysal Bank Twenty-20 Cup; the team defeated the Karachi Dolphins in the final. That was also the first time in five years that the trophy had gone to someone besides the Sialkot Stallions. Despite his poor fielding skills, Yousuf was given the award of fielder of the series. He did however injure his hamstring in training for the series against South Africa in October 2010. Chief Selector Mohsin Khan elected to withdraw Yousuf from the ODI and T20I squads but said that he should be ready to play in the Test match series. Yousuf's replacement in the limited-overs squad was Younus Khan, who had successfully reconciled with the Pakistan Cricket Board. He managed to regain his fitness and participated in the two-match Test series against South Africa. Also, he managed to regain his fitness quickly enough to participate in the final ODI of the five-match series. Yousuf wore a shirt which had his name written on in ink, which was against regulations. The match-referee called him and Yousuf stated that because he came for the test series he did not bring coloured clothing because he did not think that he would play. Subsequently, the ICC cleared him of any wrongdoing. Minutes before the toss in the first Test match, Yousuf picked up a groin injury. The injury took two weeks to heal and subsequently Yousuf missed the two-match Test series. Amid his recent spate of injuries, former Pakistan captain Moin Khan suggested that Yousuf should retire from ODIs and T20s and focus on Tests only due to age and consistent injuries. In January 2012 it was announced that Yousuf was holding talks with Leicestershire over becoming their overseas player for 2012. Talks broke down over Yousuf wanting to take time off for Ramadan. Yousaf received the Pride of Performance award in August 2012.

Natural night vision, or scotopic vision, is the ability to see under low-light conditions. In humans, rod cells are exclusively responsible for night vision as cone cells are only able to function at higher illumination levels.Miller, R. E., & Tredici, T. J. (1992). Night vision manual for the flight surgeon. PN. Night vision is of lower quality than day vision because it is limited in resolution and colors cannot be discerned; only shades of gray are seen. In order for humans to transition from day to night vision they must undergo a dark adaptation period of up to two hours Rebecca Holmes, ‚ÄúSeeing single photons‚Äù. Physics World, December 2016. http://research.physics.illinois.edu/QI/Photonics/pdf/PWDec16Holmes.pdf in which each eye adjusts from a high to a low luminescence \\"setting\\", increasing sensitivity hugely, by many orders of magnitude. This adaptation period is different between rod and cone cells and results from the regeneration of photopigments to increase retinal sensitivity. Light adaptation, in contrast, works very quickly, within seconds.  Efficiency  The human eye can function from very dark to very bright levels of light; its sensing capabilities reach across nine orders of magnitude. This means that the brightest and the darkest light signal that the eye can sense are a factor of roughly 1,000,000,000 apart. However, in any given moment of time, the eye can only sense a contrast ratio of 1,000. What enables the wider reach is that the eye adapts its definition of what is black. The eye takes approximately 20‚Äì30 minutes to fully adapt from bright sunlight to complete darkness and becomes 10,000 to 1,000,000 times more sensitive than at full daylight. In this process, the eye's perception of color changes as well (this is called the Purkinje effect). However, it takes approximately five minutes for the eye to adapt from darkness to bright sunlight. This is due to cones obtaining more sensitivity when first entering the dark for the first five minutes but the rods taking over after five or more minutes.\\"Sensory Reception: Human Vision: Structure and Function of the Human Eye\\" Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, vol. 27, 1987 Cone cells are able to regain maximum retinal sensitivity in 9‚Äì10 minutes of darkness whereas rods require 30‚Äì45 minutes to do so.\\"Sensory Reception: Human Vision: Structure and function of the Human Eye\\" vol. 27, p. 179 Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, 1987 Dark adaptation is far quicker and deeper in young people than the elderly. = Cones vs. rods = Normalised absorption spectra of the three human photopsins and of human rhodopsin (dashed). The human eye contains two types of photoreceptors, rods and cones, which can be easily distinguished by their structure. Cone photoreceptors are conical in shape and contain cone opsins as their visual pigments. There exist three types of cone photoreceptors, each being maximally sensitive to a specific wavelength of light depending on the structure of their opsin photopigment.Link, Kolb, H. (n.d.). Photoreceptors. The various cone cells are maximally sensitive to either short wavelengths (blue light), medium wavelengths (green light), or long wavelengths (red light). Rod photoreceptors only contain one type of photopigment, rhodopsin, which has a peak sensitivity at a wavelength of approximately 530 nanometers which corresponds to blue- green light. The distribution of photoreceptor cells across the surface of the retina has important consequences for vision.Purves, D., Augustine, G. J., & Fitzpatrick, D. (2001). Neuroscience. (2nd ed.). Sinauer Associates. Cone photoreceptors are concentrated in a depression in the center of the retina known as the fovea centralis and decrease in number towards the periphery of the retina. Conversely, rod photoreceptors are present at high density throughout the most of the retina with a sharp decline in the fovea. Perception in high luminescence settings is dominated by cones despite the fact that they are greatly outnumbered by rods (approximately 4.5 million to 91 million).  Ambient light response  Visual Response to Darkness. Cones work at high light levels (during the day but also during driving at night in the headlamp spotlight; rods take over at twilight and night. The y-axis has logarithmic scaling. A minor mechanism of adaptation is the pupillary light reflex, adjusting the amount of light that reaches the retina very quickly by about a factor of ten. Since it constributes only a tiny fraction of the overall adaptation to light it is not further considered here. In response to varying ambient light levels, rods and cones of eye function both in isolation and in tandem to adjust the visual system. Changes in the sensitivity of rods and cones in the eye are the major contributors to dark adaptation. Above a certain luminance level (about 0.03 cd/m), the cone mechanism is involved in mediating vision; photopic vision. Below this level, the rod mechanism comes into play providing scotopic (night) vision. The range where two mechanisms are working together is called the mesopic range, as there is not an abrupt transition between the two mechanism. This adaptation forms the basis of the Duplicity Theory.  Advantages of night vision  Reflection of camera flash from tapetum lucidum Many animals such as cats possess high-resolution night vision, allowing them to discriminate objects with high frequencies in low illumination settings. The tapetum lucidum is a reflective structure that is responsible for this superior night vision as it mirrors light back through the retina exposing the photoreceptor cells to an increased amount of light. Most animals which possess a tapetum lucidum are nocturnal most likely because upon reflection of light back through the retina the initial images become blurred. Humans, like their primate relatives, do not possess a tapetum lucidum and therefore were predisposed to be a diurnal species. Despite the fact that the resolution of human day vision is far superior to that of night vision, human night vision provides many advantages. Like many predatory animals humans can use their night vision to prey upon and ambush other animals without their awareness. Furthermore, in the event of an emergency situation occurring at night humans can increase their chances of survival if they are able to perceive their surroundings and get to safety. Both of these benefits can be used to explain why humans did not completely lose the ability to see in the dark from their nocturnal ancestors.  Dark adaptation  Extreme red light used on a ship's bridge at night to aid dark adaptation of the crew's eyes Rhodopsin, a biological pigment in the photoreceptors of the retina, immediately photobleaches in response to light. Visual phototransduction starts with the isomerizing of the pigment chromophore from 11-cis to all-trans retinal. Then this pigment dissociates into free opsin and all-trans retinal. Dark adaptation of both rods and cones requires the regeneration of the visual pigment from opsin and 11-cis retinal. Therefore, the time required for dark adaptation and pigment regeneration is largely determined by the local concentration of 11-cis retinal and the rate at which it is delivered to the opsin in the bleached rods. The decrease in calcium ion influx after channel closing causes phosphorylation of metarhodopsin II and speeds up the cis-retinal to trans-retinal inactivation. The phosphorylation of activated rhodopsin is mediated by recoverin. The regeneration of the photopigments occurs during dark adaptation albeit at markedly different rates.Link, American Optometric Association. Rods are more sensitive to light and so take longer to fully adapt to the change in light. Rods, whose photopigments regenerate more slowly, do not reach their maximum sensitivity for about two hours. Cones take approximately 9‚Äì10 minutes to adapt to the dark. Sensitivity to light is modulated by changes in intracellular calcium ions and cyclic guanosine monophosphate. The sensitivity of the rod pathway improves considerably within 5‚Äì10 minutes in the dark. Color testing has been used to determine the time at which rod mechanism takes over; when the rod mechanism takes over colored spots appear colorless as only cone pathways encode color.Aubert H. Physiologie der Netzhaut. Breslau: E. Morgenstern; 1865. Three factors affect how quickly the rod mechanism becomes dominant: *Intensity and duration of the pre-adapting light: By increasing the levels of pre-adapting luminances, the duration of cone mechanism dominance extends, while the rod mechanism switch over is more delayed. In addition the absolute threshold takes longer to reach. The opposite is true for decreasing the levels of pre-adapting luminances.Bartlett NR. Dark and light adaptation. In: Graham CH, editor. Vision and visual perception. New York: John Wiley and Sons, Inc.; 1965. *Size and location on the retina: The location of the test spot affects the dark adaptation curve because of the distribution of the rods and cones in the retina. *Wavelength of the threshold light: Varying the wavelengths of stimuli also affect the dark adaptation curve. Long wavelengths‚Äîsuch as extreme red‚Äîcreate the absence of a distinct rod/cone break, as the rod and cone cells have similar sensitivities to light of long wavelengths. Conversely, at short wavelengths the rod/cone break is more prominent, because the rod cells are much more sensitive than cones once the rods have dark adapted.Link, Perkins, E. S. (2014). Human eye. In Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. =Intracellular signalling= Normally, calcium reduces the affinity of channels to cGMP, through calcium-binding protein, calmodulin. A decrease in calcium levels when cGMP gated Na channels close activates guanylate cyclase, which increases production of cGMP, and also increases the affinity of the channels to cGMP to potentiate re-opening of the Na channels. The decrease in calcium ion concentration also inhibits the activation of phosphodiesterase to slow cGMP hydrolysis and increase the amount of cGMP. This allows for the photoreceptor cell to hyperpolarize again in response to changes in brightness level even in the dark because channels would re-open and allow for the cell to slightly depolarize. = Inhibition = Inhibition by neurons also affects activation in synapses. Together with the bleaching of a rod or cone pigment, merging of signals on ganglion cells are inhibited, reducing convergence. Alpha adaptation, i.e., rapid sensitivity fluctuations, is powered by nerve control. The merging of signals by virtue of the diffuse ganglion cells, as well as horizontal and amacrine cells, allow a cumulative effect. Thus that area of stimulation is inversely proportional to intensity of light, a strong stimulus of 100 rods equivalent to a weak stimulus of 1,000 rods. In sufficiently bright light, convergence is low, but during dark adaptation, convergence of rod signals boost. This is not due to structural changes, but by a possible shutdown of inhibition that stops convergence of messages in bright light. If only one eye is open, the closed eye must adapt separately upon reopening to match the already adapted eye. = Measuring Dark Adaptation = Ophthalmologists sometimes measure patients' dark adaptation using an instrument known as a dark adaptometer. Currently, there is one commercially available dark adaptometer, called the AdaptDx. It works by measuring a patient's Rod Intercept (RI) time. RI is the number of minutes it takes for the eye to adapt from bright light to darkness. This RI number provides a clear and objective measurement of retinal function with 90% sensitivity and specificity. An RI of less than 6.5 minutes indicates a healthy dark adaptation function. However, an RI higher than 6.5 indicates impaired dark adaptation.  Using Dark Adaptation Measurement to Diagnose Disease  Numerous clinical studies have shown that dark adaptation function is dramatically impaired from the earliest stages of AMD, retinitis pigmentosa (RP), and other retinal diseases, with increasing impairment as the diseases progress. AMD is a chronic, progressive disease that causes a part of the retina, called the macula, to slowly deteriorate over time. It is the leading cause of vision loss among people age 50 and older. It is characterized by a breakdown of the RPE/Bruch's membrane complex in the retina, leading to an accumulation of cholesterol deposits in the macula. Eventually, these deposits become clinically-visible drusen that affect photoreceptor health, causing inflammation and a predisposition to choroidal neovascularization (CNV). During the AMD disease course, the RPE/Bruch's function continues to deteriorate, hampering nutrient and oxygen transport to the rod and cone photoreceptors. As a side effect of this process, the photoreceptors exhibit impaired dark adaptation because they require these nutrients for replenishment of photopigments and clearance of opsin to regain scotopic sensitivity after light exposure. Measurement of a patient's dark adaptation function is essentially a bioassay of the health of their Bruch's membrane. As such, research has shown that, by measuring dark adaptation, doctors can detect subclinical AMD at least three years earlier than it is clinically evident. Accelerating dark adaptation There are a range of different methods, with varying levels of evidence, that have been purported or demonstrated to increase the rate at which vision can adapt in the dark. = Red lights and lenses = As a result of rod cells having a peak sensitivity at a wavelength of 530 nanometers they cannot perceive all colours on the visual spectrum. Because rod cells are insensitive to long wavelengths, the use of red lights and red lens glasses has become a common practice for accelerating dark adaptation.Link, Abbott, B. (2012). Sensation and perception. In order for dark adaptation to be significantly accelerated an individual should ideally begin this practice 30 minutes prior to entering a low luminescence setting.Watson, S., & Gorski, K. A. (2011). Invasive cardiology: A manual for cath lab personnel. (3rd ed., pp. 61-62). Sudbury, MA: Jones & Bartlett Learning. This practice will allow an individual to maintain their photopic (day) vision whilst preparing for scotopic vision. The insensitivity to red light will prevent the rod cells from further becoming bleached and allow for the rhodopsin photopigment to recharge back to its active conformation. Once an individual enters a dark setting most of their rod cells will already be accommodated to the dark and be able to transmit visual signals to the brain without an accommodation period. The concept of red lenses for dark adaptation is based upon experimentation by Antoine B√©cl√®re and his early work with radiology. In 1916, the scientist Wilhelm Trendelenburg invented the first pair of red adaptation goggles for radiologists to adapt their eyes to view screens during fluoroscopic procedures.  Evolutionary context  Although many aspects of the human visual system remain uncertain, the theory of the evolution of rod and cone photopigments is agreed upon by most scientists. It is believed that the earliest visual pigments were those of cone photoreceptors, with rod opsin proteins evolving later. Following the evolution of mammals from their reptilian ancestors approximately 275 million years ago there was a nocturnal phase in which complex colour vision was lost. Being that these pro-mammals were nocturnal they increased their sensitivity in low luminescence settings and reduced their photopic system from tetrachromatic to dichromatic. The shift to a nocturnal lifestyle would demand more rod photoreceptors to absorb the blue light emitted by the moon during the night.Link, Roberts, J. E. (2010). Circadian rhythm and human health. It can be extrapolated that the high ratio of rods to cones present in modern human eyes was retained even after the shift from nocturnal back to diurnal. It is believed that the emergence of trichromacy in primates occurred approximately 55 million years ago when the surface temperature of the planet began to rise. The primates were diurnal rather than nocturnal in nature and therefore required a more precise photopic visual system. A third cone photopigment was necessary to cover the entire visual spectrum enabling primates to better discriminate between fruits and detect those of the highest nutritional value. Applications  *Aviators commonly wear red lensed glasses or goggles prior to taking off in the dark to ensure that they are able to see outside of the aircraft. Furthermore, throughout flight the cockpit is illuminated with dim red lights. This lighting is to ensure that the pilot is able to read instruments and maps while maintaining scotopic vision for looking outside.Link , Federal Aviation Administration. (2015). Medical facts for pilots. *Submarines: Oftentimes submarines are ‚Äúrigged for red,‚Äù meaning that the boat is going to be surfacing or coming to periscope depth at night. During such times illumination within certain compartments is switched to red light to allow the eyes of the lookouts and officers to adjust to the darkness prior to looking outside of the boat. Additionally, compartments on a submarine may be illuminated with red light in order to simulate night conditions for the crew.Summitt, D. (2004). Tales of a cold war submariner. (1st ed., p. 138) = Vitamin A = 11-cis-Retinal2 Vitamin A is necessary for proper functioning of the human eye. The photopigment rhodopsin found in human rod cells is composed of retinal, a form of vitamin A, bound to an opsin protein. Upon the absorption of light rhodopsin was decomposed into retinal and opsin through bleaching. Retinal could then have one of two fates: it could recombine with opsin to reform rhodopsin or it could be converted into free retinol. The American scientist George Wald was the first to recognize that the visual system expends vitamin A and is dependent upon diet for its replacement. Vitamin A serves many functions in the human body outside of healthy vision. It is vital in maintaining a healthy immune system as well as promoting normal growth and development.Link, Dieticians of Canada. (2014). Food sources of vitamin a. The average adult male and female should consume 900 and 700 micrograms of vitamin A per day, respectively. Consumption above 3000 micrograms per day is referred to as vitamin A toxicity and is usually caused by accidental ingestion of supplements.Link, Johnson, L. E. (2014). Vitamin a.  Sources of vitamin A  Vitamin A is present in both animal and plant sources as retinoids and carotenoids, respectively. Retinoids can be used immediately by the body upon absorption into the cardiovascular system; however, plant-based carotenoids must be converted to retinol prior to utilization by the body. The highest animal-based sources of vitamin A are liver, dairy products, and fish. Fruits and vegetables containing high amounts of carotenoids are dark green, yellow, orange, and red in colour.  Evolutionary context  Vitamin A-based opsin proteins have been used for sensing light in organisms for most of evolutionary history beginning approximately 3 billion years ago. This feature has been passed from unicellular to multicellular organisms including Homo sapiens. This vitamin was most likely selected by evolution for sensing light because retinal causes a shift in photoreceptor absorbance to the visible light range. This shift in absorbance is especially important for life on Earth because it generally matches the peak irradiance of sunlight on its surface. A second reason why retinal evolved to be vital for human vision is because it undergoes a large conformational change when exposed to light. This conformational change is believed to make it easier for the photoreceptor protein to distinguish between its silent and activated state thus better controlling visual phototransduction.  Experimental evidence  Various studies have been conducted testing the effective of vitamin A supplementation on dark adaptation. In a study by Cideciyan et al. the length of dark adaptation was measured in a patient with systemic vitamin A deficiency (VAD) before and after vitamin A supplementation. The dark adaptation function was measured prior to supplementation, 1 day post-treatment, and 75 days post-treatment. It was observed that after merely one day of vitamin A supplementation the recovery kinetics of dark adaptation were significantly accelerated after photoreceptor bleaching. Dark adaptation was further accelerated following 75 days of treatment. A subsequent study by Kemp et al. studied dark adaptation in subjects with primary biliary cirrhosis and Crohn‚Äôs disease, both of whom had vitamin A deficiency. Within 8 days of oral supplementation of vitamin A both patients had their visual function restored to normal. Furthermore, adaptation kinetics significantly improved in both subjects following supplementation. = Anthocyanins = Anthocyanins make up the majority of the 4000 known flavonoid phytochemicals. This group of approximately 600 bioactive antioxidants carries the strongest physiological effects of any plant compound.Link , Sterling, M. (2001). What are anthocyanins? These chemicals are also the most visible of the flavonoid phytochemicals because they provide bright blue, red, or purple pigmentation to many plant species. Anthocyanins also serve to protect the photosynthetic tissues from the direct rays of the sun. , Innovateus. (n.d.). What are the benefits of anthocyanidins? In addition, the antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and vasoprotective properties of anthocyanins allow them to demonstrate diverse health effects. In humans, anthocyanins are effective for a variety of health conditions including neurological damage, atherosclerosis, diabetes, as well as visual impairment. Anthocyanins frequently interact with other phytochemicals to potentiate biological effects; therefore, contributions from individual biomolecules remains difficult to decipher. As a result of anthocyanins providing bright colouration to flowers, the plants containing these phytochemicals are naturally successful in attracting pollinators such as birds and bees. The fruits and vegetables produced by such plants are also brightly pigmented attracting animals to eat them and disperse the seeds. Due to this natural mechanism anthocyanin-containing plants are widely abundant in most areas of the world. The high abundance and distribution of anthocyanin-containing plants make it a natural food source for many animals. Through fossil evidence it is known that these compounds were eaten in high amounts by primitive hominins. During World Wars I and II British Air Force aviators were known to consume extensive amounts of bilberry jam. The aviators consumed this anthocyanin-rich food due to its many visual benefits, included accelerated dark adaptation, which would be valuable for night bombing missions.Losso, J. N., Shahidi, F., & Bagchi, D. (2007). Anti-angiogenic functional and medicinal foods. Boca Raton, FL: Taylor & Francis Group.  Food sources  Blackberry fruits Brightly coloured fruits and vegetables are rich in anthocyanins. This makes sense intuitively because anthocyanins offer pigmentation to plants. Blackberries are the most anthocyanin-rich foods, containing 89-211 milligrams per 100 grams. Other foods that are rich in this phytochemical include red onions, blueberries, bilberries, red cabbage, and eggplant. The ingestion of any of these food sources will yield a variety of phytochemicals in addition to anthocyanins because they naturally exist together. The daily intake of anthocyanins is estimated to be approximately 200 milligrams in the average adult; however, this value can reach several grams per day if an individual is consuming flavonoid supplements.  Effect on dark adaptation Anthocyanins accelerate dark adaptation in humans by enhancing the regeneration of the rod photopigment, rhodopsin. Anthocyanins accomplish this by binding directly to opsin upon the degradation of rhodopsin to its individual constituents by light. Once bound to opsin, the anthocyanin changes its structure thereby accelerating its access to the retinal binding pocket. By having a diet rich in anthocyanins an individual is able to generate rhodopsin in shorter periods of time because of the increased affinity of opsin to retinal. Through this mechanism an individual is able to accelerate dark adaptation and achieve night vision in a shorter period of time.  Supportive evidence  In a double-blind, placebo-controlled study conducted by Nakaishi et al. a powdered anthocyanin concentrate derived from black currants was provided to a number of participants. Participants received one of three doses of anthocyanins to measure if the result occurred in a dose-dependent manner. The period of dark adaptation was measured prior to and two hours following supplementation in all participants. Results from this experiment indicate that anthocyanins significantly accelerated dark adaptation at merely one dose level compared to the placebo. Observing the data as a whole Nakaishi et al. concluded that anthocyanins effectively reduced the dark adaptation period in a dose-dependent manner.  Contradictory evidence  Despite the fact that many scientists believe anthocyanins to be beneficial in accelerating dark adaptation in humans, a study conducted by Kalt et al. in 2014 showed blueberry anthocyanins have no effect. In this study two double-blind, placebo-controlled studies were conducted to examine dark adaptation following the intake of blueberry products. In neither study did the blueberry anthocyanin intake effect the length of dark adaptation. From these results Kalt et al. concluded that blueberry anthocyanins provide no significant difference to the dark adaptation component of human vision.  Light adaptation  With light adaptation, the eye has to quickly adapt to the background illumination to be able to distinguish objects in this background. The process for light adaptation occurs over a period of five minutes. The photochemical reaction is: : Rhodopsin ‚áå retinal + opsin = Increment threshold = Schematic of the increment threshold curve of the rod system Using increment threshold experiments, light adaptation can be measured clinically.H Davson. Physiology of the eye. 5th ed. London: Macmillan Academic and Professional Ltd.; 1990. In an increment threshold experiment, a test stimulus is presented on a background of a certain luminance, the stimulus is increased until the detection threshold is reached against the background. A monophasic or biphasic threshold versus intensity TVI curve is obtained through this method for both cones and rods. When the threshold curve for a single system (i.e., just cones or just rods) is taken in isolation it can be seen to possesses four sections:Aguilar M, Stiles WS. Saturation of the rod mechanism of the retina at high levels of stimulation. Opt Acta (Lond) 1954;1:59‚Äì65. ;1. Dark light: The threshold in this portion of the TVI curve is determined by the dark/light level. Sensitivity is limited by neural noise. The background field is relatively low and does not significantly affect threshold. ;2. Square root law: This part of the curve is limited by quantal fluctuation in the background. The visual system is usually compared with a theoretical construct called the ideal light detector. To detect the stimulus, the stimulus must sufficiently exceed the fluctuations of the background (noise). ;3. Weber's law: Threshold increases with background luminance proportional to the square root of the background. ;4. Saturation: At saturation, the rod system becomes unable to detect the stimulus. This section of the curve occurs for the cone mechanism under high background levels.H Davson. Physiology of the eye. 5th ed. London: Macmillan Academic and Professional Ltd.; 1990  Insufficiency  Effect of night blindness. Left: good night vision. Right: nightblind. Insufficiency of adaptation most commonly presents as insufficient adaptation to dark environment, called night blindness or nyctalopia. The opposite problem, known as hemeralopia, that is, inability to see clearly in bright light, is much rarer. The fovea is blind to dim light (due to its cone-only array) and the rods are more sensitive, so a dim star on a moonless night must be viewed from the side, so it stimulates the rods. This is not due to pupil width since an artificial fixed-width pupil gives the same results. Night blindness can be caused by a number of factors the most common of which being vitamin A deficiency. If detected early enough nyctalopia can be reversed and visual function can be regained; however; prolonged vitamin A deficiency can lead to permanent visual loss if left untreated. Night blindness is especially prominent in developing countries due to malnutrition and therefore a lack of vitamin A in the diet. In developed countries night blindness has historically been uncommon due to adequate food availability; however, the incidence is expected to increase as obesity becomes more common. Increased obesity rates correspond to an increased number of bariatric surgeries, causing malabsorption of vitamin A in the human body.

A Weisswurst (German Wei√üwurst , literally white sausage; ) is a traditional Bavarian sausage made from minced veal and pork back bacon. It is usually flavored with parsley, lemon, mace, onions, ginger, and cardamom, although there are some variations. Then the mixture is stuffed into pork casings and separated into individual sausages measuring about ten to twelve centimeters in length and three to four centimeters in thickness. As they are not smoked or otherwise preserved they are very perishable. Wei√üw√ºrste traditionally were manufactured early in the morning and prepared and eaten as a snack between breakfast and lunch. There is a saying that the sausages should not be allowed to hear the noon chime of the church bells. Even today, most Bavarians never eat Wei√üw√ºrste after lunchtime (though it is perfectly acceptable to have a lunch consisting of Wei√üw√ºrste at, say, half past one). The sausages are heated in water‚Äîwell short of boiling‚Äîfor about ten minutes, which will turn them greyish-white because no color-preserving nitrite is used in Weisswurst preparation. Wei√üw√ºrste are brought to the table in a big bowl together with the hot water used for preparation (so they do not cool down too much), then eaten without their skins. Ways of eating Wei√üwurst include the traditional way, called zuzeln (Bavarian for sucking), in which each end of the sausage is cut or bitten open, after which the meat is sucked out from the skin. Alternatively, the more popular and more discreet ways of consuming it are by cutting the sausage lengthwise and then \\"rolling out\\" the meat from the skin with a fork, or also to open it on one and consume it very much like a banana, ever opening the peel further and dipping the sausage into the mustard. Wei√üwurst is commonly served with a Bavarian sweet mustard (Wei√üwurstsenf) and accompanied by Brezn (Bavarian Pretzel‚Äîoften spelled Brezeln outside Bavaria) and Wei√übier. Wei√üwurst, whose consumption traditionally is associated with Bavaria, helped in the coining of a humorous term, Wei√üwurst√§quator (literally, white sausage equator), that delineates a cultural boundary separating other linguistic and cultural areas from Southern Germany. The Wei√üwurst was invented in 1857 at the Marienplatz in Munich. Despite this \\"mid-1800s invention,\\" (a popular legend holds that its invention was an accident) Wei√üw√ºrste can be found pictured in publications dating to the early 1800s.

Background Georgios Grivas Cyprus, an island in the eastern Mediterranean, inhabited mostly by Greek Cypriots (majority) and Turkish Cypriots (minority) populations, was part of the Ottoman Empire until 4 June 1878, when in the aftermath of the Russo-Turkish War, it was handed to the British empire. As nationalistic tendencies were growing in both communities of Cyprus, Greek Cypriots were leaning towards Enosis (Union with Greece) which was a part of Megali idea. The origins of Enosis date back to 1821, the year when the Greek War of Independence commenced, and the archbishop of Cyprus, his archdeacon, and three bishops were beheaded, amongst other atrocities. In 1828, Count Ioannis Kapodistrias, the first governor of Greece, asked for the union of Cyprus with Greece, while small-scale uprisings also occurred. In 1878, when British general Wolsely came to Cyprus to formally establish British rule, he was met by the archbishop of Kition who, after welcoming him, requested that Britain cede Cyprus to Greece. Initially, the Greek Cypriots welcomed British rule because they were aware that the British had returned the Ionian Islands to Greece in 1864, and they were also hoping for British investment in Cyprus. In 1912 the British government offered Greece to exchange Cyprus for a naval base in Argostoli, Kefalonia, in order to gain control of the Ionian sea, an offer which was repeated in 1913. In 1915, the British offered several times Cyprus to Greece, in exchange for Greece's participation in World War I. But while Greece was undecided whether it should enter the War, the British government withdrew its offer. By 1915, the Greek Cypriots seeing that neither the British investment nor Enosis, had materialised, increased their opposition to British rule. In the beginning, the Enosis movement had only few supporters mainly from the upper classes. But that was about to change as two groups of disappointed with the new ruler began to form: the Church and the Usurers. In the following years a growing number of Cypriots were studying in Greece, and upon their return, they became strong advocates of Enosis. On the other hand, the Turkish Cypriot community started to develop its own nationalism in the early 20th century, as news arrived in the island about the persecutions faced by Muslims in the countries that formed after the collapse of Ottoman Empire. The November 1926 appointment of Ronald Storrs (a philhellene) as the new governor of Cyprus, fostered the idea among Greek Cypriot nationalists that British rule would be a stepping stone for the eventual union with Greece. Their relationship was to sour in 1928, when Greek Cypriots refused to take part in the celebration of the 15th anniversary of the British occupation of Cyprus. Greece appealed for calm, limiting the spread of anti-colonial articles in Greek Cypriot newspapers. Education became another arena of conflict with the passage of the Education Act, which sought to curtail Greek influence in the Cypriot school curricula. Cypriot irredentists also lamented the supposedly preferential treatment of Malta and Egypt at the expense of Cyprus. Relations worsened further when the British authorities unilaterally passed a new penal code which permitted among other things the use of torture. In 1929, Legislative Council members Archbishop of Kition Nikodemos and Stavros Stavrinakis arrived in London, presenting a memorandum to the secretary of colonies Lord Passfield which contained demands for Enosis. As with previous such attempts the answer was negative. In September 1931, Storrs blocked a Legislative Council decision to halt tax hikes that were to cover a local budget deficit. Greek Cypriot MPs reacted by resigning from their positions. Furthermore, on 18 October, Archbishop of Kition Nikodemos called Greek Cypriots to engage in acts of civil disobedience until their demands for Enosis were fulfilled. On 21 October 1931, 5,000 Greek Cypriots, mostly students, priests and city notables rallied in the streets of Nicosia while chanting pro‚ÄìEnosis slogans in what came to be known as the October Events. The crowd besieged Government House, following three hours of stone throwing the building was set on fire. The rioters were eventually dispersed by police. At the same time British flags were stripped from public offices across the country, often being substituted with Greek ones. Order was restored by the beginning of November. A total of seven protesters were killed, thirty were injured, ten were exiled for life, while 2,606 received various punishments ranging from prison terms to fines on account of seditious activities. The revolt damaged both the Enotic cause and the Anglo‚ÄìHellenic relations. The Legislative Council and municipal elections were abolished, the appointment of village authorities and district judges was relegated to the governor of the island. Propagating Enotic ideas and flying foreign flags was banned as was the assembly of more than 5 people. Cyprus thus entered a period of autocratic rule known as Palmerokratia (Œ†Œ±ŒªŒºŒµœÅŒøŒ∫œÅŒ±œÑŒØŒ±, \\"Palmerocracy\\"), named after governor Richmond Palmer, which started shortly before the revolt and would last until the beginning of World War II. In the 1950s, EOKA was established with the specific aim of mounting a military campaign to end the status of Cyprus as a British crown colony and achieving the island's unification with Greece. The leadership of AKEL at the time, the island's communist party, opposed EOKA's military action, advocating a \\"Gandhiesque approach\\" of civil disobedience, such as workers' strikes and demonstrations. Initially, the struggle was political, as opposed to military. EOKA, in Grivas' words, wanted to attract the attention of the world through high-profile operations that would make headlines. Formation =Leadership= EOKA was headed by Georgios Grivas Greek Army officer, World War I and World War II veteran. During the Axis occupation of Greece in World War II, he led a small, anti-communist resistance group, named Organization X. During the anti-communist struggle of December 1944 in Athens after the Axis withdrawal he was saved due to British intervention. Grivas assumed the nom de guerre Digenis in direct reference to the legendary Byzantine Digenis Akritas who repelled invaders from the Byzantine Empire. Second in command in EOKA was Grigoris Afxentiou, also a former officer of the Greek army. Afxentiou had graduated from the reserves Officers Academy in 1950 without previous experience on battlefield. =Objectives= The main objective of EOKA was Enosis: union of Cyprus with Greece. The organization adopted typical Greek national ideologies and displayed religious, conservative and anticommunist ideas. This was in agreement with the prevailing ideas of Cypriot society at the time. There was a widespread belief that leftists opposed national objectives and provided a certain support to the colonial regime contrary to other contemporary anti-colonial insurgencies in Africa or Asia, which were led by Marxists. Grivas and Archbishop of Cyprus, Makarios III, disagreed about the way to rid the island of British rule. Grivas rejected Makarios' attempt to limit the campaign to acts of sabotage, avoiding loss of life. Nevertheless, he shared Makarios' view that victory would be won by diplomatic means.Newsinger, 2016, p. 96 Grivas' goal was to subject the British to continued relentless harassment, making it clear to them that occupation carried a price, while keeping Enosis on the international diplomatic agenda.Newsinger, 2016, p. 97 The British response to the EOKA campaign was crucial in this regard: repression would on the one hand alienate the Greek Cypriot population from British rule, and on the other hand provide Makarios and the Greek government with a stick to beat the British with before the United Nations. EOKA would ensure that there was a Cyprus problem and demonstrate to the world that the British could not resolve it. =Preparations= Grivas carried out a first reconnaissance in Cyprus as early as July 1951.Newsinger, 2016, p. 93 Makarios was certainly skeptical, telling Grivas on one occasion that he would not find supporters for an armed struggle. The British shared the same view. Grivas finally arrived on the island in early November 1954 and set about establishing his underground network.Newsinger, 2016, p. 94 He recruited from the Cyprus Farmers' Union (PEK) in the villages and from the two main youth movements, the Church- controlled Christian Youth Movement (OHEN) and the nationalist Pancyprian Youth Movement (PEON) in the towns. Grivas intended to turn the youth of Cyprus 'into the seedbed of EOKA'. The backbone of EOKA were the mountain groups, a conventional guerrilla force living in hidden camps in the forests, and the town groups, often continuing their civilian job or schooling. Supporting this armed wing was the much broader National Front of Cyprus (EMAK), which provided EOKA with intelligence, supplies, weapons, medicines, recruits and safe houses, confronted the British on the streets with demonstrations and riots and conducted the propaganda offensive. Armed campaign Street riot in Nicosia during the Battle at Nicosia Hospital in 1956 = From April 1955 to the dismissal of governor Armitage (October) = The armed struggle started on the night of March 29 ‚Äì April 1955. A total of 18 bomb attacks occurred in various locations across the island. Most notable incidents were those of Nicosia by the group of Markos Drakos as well as the demolition of the Cyprus Broadcasting Station's transmitter. The attacks were accompanied by a revolutionary proclamation signed by \\"The leader, Digenes\\". Grivas decided to keep his involvement secret at the moment and used the name of a Byzantine general who had defended Cyprus in the medieval era. The British, not expecting this turn of events, reinforced their local military bases (Dhekelia and Akrotiri) by transferring troops from Egypt. At the end of April EOKA attacks temporarily paused, giving time to Grivas to organize the youth. A second offensive was launched on June 19 with coordinated bomb and grenade attacks against police stations, military installations and the homes of army officers and senior officials. One of those bombings demolished the building of the Famagusta Police headquarters. Those attacks were usually followed by sporadic incidents: shootings, bombings and increased public disorder. This second wave of EOKA attacks lasted until the end of June, totaling 204 attacks since the beginning of the armed resistance. In August, two Special Branch members were assassinated in separate incidents. The raising of the Greek flag during demonstrations usually led to clashes with the colonial authorities, the latter removing it by force if necessary. Another major EOKA success was the escape from Kyrenia castle prison of 16 EOKA members including a number of key figures, such as Markos Drakos and Grigoris Afxentiou.  British reactions  The situation seemed to be deteriorating out of control and the British authorities attempted to safeguard their position in Cyprus by diplomatic maneuvering and a counterinsurgency offensive. The first involved playing the Greek and Turkish governments off against each other. Eden saw Turkey as \\"the key protecting British interests\\" in Cyprus. By the end of September, as the crisis was escalating, the British Government decided to replace governor Armitage. In Turkey, the public opinion was un-eased. Rumors were spreading in Turkish media that a slaughter of the Turkish Cypriot community was likely to occur. Though they were unfounded they led to nationalist reactions in the country and the government-sponsored anti-Greek Istanbul pogrom of September 1955. At the same time, during the London Trilateral Conference between Britain, Turkey and Greece, an agreement failed to materialize due to Turkish intransigence. In this fashion, British policy also aimed at the dramatic increase in recruitment of Turkish Cypriots. By the start of 1956, they had come to dominate the police force numbering 4,000 compared to less than 1,000 Greek Cypriots. The Turkish Cypriots were very much in the front line against EOKA. Inevitably, the use of Turkish Cypriot policemen against the Greek Cypriot community exacerbated relations between the two communities. = From October 1955 to March 1956 (Operation Forward Victory, phase I) = The new British governor John Harding arrived at October 3. Harding sought to meet Archbishop Makarios, and both agreed on commencing what became known as Harding-Makarios negotiations. Increased security and stepping up military might was of Harding's priorities. On November 26, Harding declared a State of Emergency ‚Äì that meant among other, implementation of the death penalty for non-fatality crimes. Repressive legislation and troop reinforcements did not succeed. The Greek Cypriot population was hostile and the Special Branch was neutered. The British response was large-scale cordon and search operations which rarely resulted in arrests or the discovery of arms caches, but which invariably alienated those whose houses were searched or who were roughed up and dragged off to be screened. Collective punishments, far from undermining support for EOKA, only succeeded in making the Greek Cypriots more hostile to British rule. Moreover, Harding viewed Cyprus very much as a pawn in the Cold War global situation: on December 13 he banned AKEL and detained 128 of its leading members, effectively crippling the only political party in Cyprus that opposed EOKA. The inevitable result was to increase sympathy for EOKA and to assist its recruitment efforts. The problem was that the Greek Cypriot community was overwhelmingly in favour of Enosis. Far from moderates emerging with whom Britain could do a deal. It was this popular support, enabling Grivas and his small band of guerrillas to take on the growing security apparatus that Harding was marshaling against him, that sustained the armed struggle. It became clear that EOKA did have an effective intelligence apparatus and that the guerrillas were often forewarned of security intentions. Schoolchildren, domestic servants, civilian personnel on the military bases, the police, all were enlisted by Grivas in the intelligence war while the security forces were operating in the dark. Operation \\"Forward to Victory\\" (Greek name) was launched on November 18 and was accompanied by several bomb attacks. In the urban areas, schoolchildren had a prominent role in the EOKA struggle. The Battle of Flags, escalated during the Autumn of 1955 and peaked in January and February 1956- that kept British forces busy away from chasing down EOKA. Schoolboys were not only participating in riots and stone-throwing against the police, but some of them were also trained to throw bombs and carry assassinations. Bombs by guerrillas and youngsters were thrown at British personnel houses, police stations and army camps. In some cases, EOKA members managed to steal some weaponry. The British were never to succeed completely eliminating EOKA agents from the police force. The struggle continued in the mountains as the guerrillas expanded their network in the Troodos mountains. However, due to harsh winter conditions in addition to certain British military pressure, the activity of EOKA temporarily eased. By the end of February 1956 the British were involved in suppressing a veritable schoolchildren revolt that left one boy shot dead and the island's school system almost completely closed down. = March 1956 to March 1957 (operation Victory, phase II) = After the failure of Makarios-Harding negotiations the British government abruptly exiled Makarios to Seychelles on March 9, 1956. This triggered a week long general strike followed by a dramatic increase in EOKA activity: 246 attacks until March 31 including an unsuccessful attempt to assassinate Harding. The offensive continued into April and May and the British casualties averaged two killed every week. While Harding's forces were making ground up in the mountains, EOKA guerrillas and youth were trying to assassinate members of the security forces at their leisure time or alleged traitors. EOKA focused its activity to urban areas during this period. House bombings and riots, mostly by schoolboys, forced army to keep forces away from the mountains where EOKA's main fighters were hiding. Apart from individual citizens or soldiers in their leisure time, army and police facilities were attacked totaling 104 house bombings, 53 riots, 136 acts of Sabotage, 403 ambushes, 35 attacks on police, 38 attacks on soldiers and 43 raids on police stations. But as the pressure of Harding mounted, Grivas began targeting Turkish Cypriot policemen effectively sparking inter-communal riots and a series of strikes Harding escalated his fight against EOKA organizing a series of operations in April‚ÄìJuly Harding also upgraded his intelligence network including the creation of the notorious X-platoon. On May 10 the first two EOKA prisoners were hanged and Grivas responded with the execution of two British soldiers. The British were concerned to counter EOKA's mountain units. Large scale operations were launched however Grivas managed to escape. He decided to move to Limassol where he established his new headquarters. Although Grivas escaped, the Troodos operations had some success for the British: 20 guerrillas and 50 weapons were captured. However, they ended up with a disaster: at least 7 British soldiers were killed and additionally 21 were burned to death by accident. The last incident overshadowed the first real success against the EOKA guerrilla forces. On August 9 the British authorities hanged three more EOKA prisoners; however, Grivas did not retaliate this time. Widespread strikes were held in protest. In November 1956 due to the Suez Crisis large numbers of British troops were transferred off Cyprus allowing Grivas to launch a new offensive. EOKA launched a wave of attacks in what would become for the British \\"Black November\\" with a total of 416 attacks, 39 killed 21 of the British. After the Suez debacle, the British military strength was increased to 20,000 and Harding managed to direct a new offensive. Although EOKA activity was severely suppressed in the mountains its armed struggle continued in the urban areas while the British forces were apparently impotent. Grivas declared truce on the 14th of March 1957 which lasted nearly one year. = From March 1957 to November 1957 = Harding continued to pressure EOKA despite the unilateral truce imposing security measures on villagers. This backfired at the British Forces as EOKA made gains in the field of propaganda. Meanwhile, PEKA was continuing the struggle for Enosis with political means, while EOKA was trying to recruit new members. Priests and teachers, under strict secrecy, were the scouting for young men aged 14‚Äì24, and were mostly successful. Grivas reorganized EOKA's structure. By Autumn, Grivas was increasing his autonomy from Greece and Makarios and was planning to attack the Left and the Turkish Cypriot community. The Greek government and Makarios were unable to prevent those initiatives.  Detention Camps and claims of torture  Detention of Persons Law, passed on 15 June 1955, gave the authority to the British authorities to enclose a suspect in a detention camp without a trial. PEKA and later Makarios and Greek Government pointed to the unhuman conditions in those camps. The situation of the inmates there was a matter of dispute International Committee of the Red Cross visited the camps twice and found no problems. Harding declined the torture allegations, describing it as propaganda by EOKA. Torture allegations had an impact in internal British politics. The precise use of torture methods remains a matter of dispute. According to Heinz Richter, while police or army was generally lawful, the British turned a blind eye to interrogators many of whom were deliberately under-educated Turkish Cypriots who were against Enosis. Another aspect that Richter highlights is that many claims of torture were made as the alleged victims were afraid for their lives as it was punished by death to speak to the British. David French on the other hand views that most - but not all- claims of torture were a propaganda tool of EOKA. In general Harding failed to win over the Greek Cypriot population especially when his security forces resorted to this kind of measures. Campaign against Greek Cypriot groups  Initially, EOKA was intimidating the population not to co-operate with the security forces, but steadily the definition of traitor broadened as the security forces had some successes EOKA at the end of 1956. EOKA members who had spoken to the security forces under interrogation were also considered as traitors and Grivas was in favour of the death penalty in such case. Incidences happened where EOKA guerrillas killed others by their own initiative and not solely based on accusations for treason. The killings took place in public. Such activity peaked especially during summer-autumn 1956. The Greek Cypriot Left and in particular the communist party (AKEL) were also targeted. The later aimed at a political role in the Greek Cypriot community challenging EOKA's claim that Makarios was the sole leader of the community. As AKEL was growing in numbers it was practically denying Makarios' role. The British delicately fueled this hostility and in August 1957 a second wave of intra-Greek violence broke out. Due to intimidation methods and targeting civilians towards local population a number of scholars characterized EOKA as a terrorist organisation. Another similar wave broke out in April- October 1958 when a peace agreement was imminent. AKEL held massive demonstrations and sought the help of Makarios which he granted. End of truce During this period the British were openly tolerating the Turkish Cypriot paramilitary organisations. The British had deliberately set out to use the Turkish Cypriot community on the island and the Turks government as a means of blocking the demand for Enosis. They had effectively allied themselves with the Turkish minority and turned them as the overwhelming majority in the police force. This had now got out of control as far as the British were concerned, but nevertheless they still managed to exploit the situation. The truce against the colonial authorities lasted until 28 October 1957 (Ohi Day, Greek national holiday) when Harold Macmillan, British minister of foreign affairs, declined a proposal by Makarios. =December 1957‚ÄìAugust 1958 (Foot governorship and intercommunal violence) = Sir Hugh Foot arrived in Cyprus in December 1956, when it was obvious that a military victory for the British was not imminent. Grivas at that time was planning a gradual escalation of EOKA's attacks on the British forces but in mid-December, he called for a truce to give space for negotiations to take place. The truce broke on 4 March 1958 when a new wave of attacks was unleashed but this time, Grivas ordered his guerillas not to attack Turkish Cypriots to avoid intercommunal violence that could lead to partition.  EOKA and Turkish Cypriots  The Turkish Cypriot community objected to Enosis long before the 1950s from fear that unification with Greece would lead to their persecution and expulsion, a fear based on the fate of Cretan Turks after Crete's union with Greece. Similarly, nationalism among Turkish Cypriots was constructed from various events that led to the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire. Grass root paramilitary armed groups, such as Kƒ±brƒ±s T√ºrk Mukavemet Birliƒüi (\\"Turkish Cypriot Resistance Unit\\"), Kara √áete (\\"Black Gang\\") and Volkan, appeared as early as May 1955. All of them were absorbed later by TMT (T√ºrk Mukavemet Te≈ükilatƒ±/Turkish Resistance Organization) TMT was Turkey's tool to fuel intercommunal violence in order to show that partition was the only possible arrangement. Like EOKA, TMT used violence against members of its own community (i.e. leftists) that were not willing to stay in line with their cause. EOKA avoided conflict against the Turkish Cypriots but this changed later from January 1957. According to French, Grivas decided to attack Turkish Cypriots so as to spark intercommunal tensions and rioting in the towns of Cyprus, forcing the British to withdraw their troops from hunting EOKA up in the mountains and restore order in urban areas. From 19 January 1957 to the end of March, EOKA's guerrillas attacked members of the Turkish community, starting with a Turkish Cypriot police officer, sparking riots lasting 3 days. Intercommunal (and intra-communal) violence escalated in the summer of 1958 with numerous fatalities. French counted 55 assassinations by Turks on Greeks, and 59 assassinations by Greeks on Turks between 7 June-7 August. A substantial number of Turkish Cypriots fled from the southern parts of Cyprus and moved to the northern side due to the violence. In order to tackle the intercommunal clash, Foot mounted Operations \\"Matchbox\\" and \\"Table Lighter\\". A truce was called in August, backed by the Greek and Turkish Governments. = From August 1958 to the Zurich and London Agreements = Archbishop Makarios III (here in 1962) was the political leader of EOKA. British authorities were unable to suppress EOKA activity, so the British government was trying to reach a solution that wouldn't embarrass Britain. MacMillan Plan put an effort in this direction. Greeks rejected the plan as they saw it as an open door leading to the partition of the island and Grivas cancelled the truce on September 7. As such a new armed campaign was launched and the targets differed significantly from the previous periods. Grivas ordered guerillas to \\"strike indiscriminately at every English person wherever they can be found\\" resulting in the death of 8 British citizens in 104 incidents attacks in the following two months. But while the military force of EOKA was growing, Greek Cypriots were getting frustrated from the intercommunal violence and the struggle against the British. Makarios hinted in an interview that he was ready to shift his stance and accept an independent Cyprus. This development infuriated Grivas but was backed by influential members of the Greek Cypriot Community. EOKA was losing its broad support base. During the last months of 1958, all parties had reasons to favour a compromise. Greek Cypriot side was afraid that partition was becoming more and more imminent, Greece was anxious that the ongoing situation could lead to a war with Turkey, Turkey had to manage the ongoing crises at its eastern borders and the British didn't want to see NATO destabilizing because of Greek-Turkish war. On 5 December, the foreign ministers of Greece and Turkey acknowledged the situation and a series of meetings were arranged that resulted in London-Z√ºrich Agreements. This was a compromise solution in which Cyprus would become an independent and sovereign country. Both Makarios and Grivas accepted the agreements with a heavy heart, instead, Turkish-Cypriot leadership was enthusiastic about the compromise. On 9 March 1959, Grivas issued a leaflet declaring his acceptance to London agreements. According to historian Heinz Richter, who cites David Carter's list, the activities of EOKA resulted in the death of 104 British soldiers, 54 policemen (among them 15 Greek Cypriots, 22 Turkish Cypriots and 12 British<\\\\--plus two 2 \\"others\\"-->) and 238 citizens (among them 26 British, 203 Greek Cypriots and 7 Turkish Cypriots)  Aftermath  After Zurich- Londone agreement and the establishment of the Republic of Cyprus, Makarios, who became the first president, staffed the Government and Civil service with EOKA members. Extremists of both communities stayed armed and continued to seek their ends, Enosis or Taksim. Ministers and other EOKA veterans joined the secret Akritas organisation, with Polycarpos Giorkatzis as new \\"Digenis\\". As each community strived for opposite ends, the newly formed state soon collapsed, after Makarios changed the constitution unilaterally, paving the way to the intercommunal violence. Grivas returned secretly to Cyprus to continue the EOKA struggle for Enosis, as he deemed that Makarios was gradually shifting away from their initial goal. He created EOKA B and with the aid of military Junta of Athens, attacked government buildings, Makarios himself and AKEL. In 1974, EOKA B joined forces with the greek military units on the island and the Cypriot National Guard at the coup against Makarios. Legacy The authorities of the Republic of Cyprus consider the EOKA struggle as a struggle of national liberation and its members as heroic freedom fighters. The day of the beginning of the EOKA campaign, 1 April, is considered a national anniversary in the country today. Turkish nationalist narrative as written in a Turkish-Cypriot textbook considers the struggle of EOKA's guerillas as barbaric and illegal with the conclusion that \\"Cyprus is and will remain T√πrkish\\" (p. 61).\\" =Museums and Monuments= Monument for Michalis Karaolis, Nicosia A memorial museum dedicated to the EOKA campaign was created in 1960. It is located in the centre of Nicosia. There are various monuments dedicated to the members of EOKA who died during the years of combat who are largely regarded as war-time heroes by Greek-Cypriots. Part of the central jail of Nicosia established by British governor Harding functions after the Cypriot independence as a museum. This includes the prisons cells, the gallows and the \\"Incarcerated Graves\\" of 13 EOKA fighters who were either executed or killed by the colonial authorities. Foreign Office declassified documents and EOKA lawsuits against the British government Torture tactics employed by the British in Cyprus included the use of beatings, public floggings, clean beatings, forced standing, ice, and drugs. Other torture included anal and vaginal insertion of hot eggs, a tactic also employed by the British in Kenya. A British Special Branch interrogator in Cyprus stated that he had devised the \\"hot egg under the armpit\\" technique\\". In a few instances electrotorture was also applied. Jack Taylor, a British policeman who was sent to Cyprus in September 1956 revealed that there were beatings of prisoners, while British Brigadier Harbottle confirmed that the British Special Branch used torture. These statements confirm the use of torture in Cyprus by the British, although how widespread and frequent the use of torture was remains unclear. In 2012, Foreign Office released highly classified documents that described claims of torture and abuse between 1955‚Äì1959. In the reports it is revealed that officers of the colonial administration admitted to torture and abuse. In the same papers, there are allegations against British soldiers and security personnel concerning the murder of a blind man, ordering a Greek Cypriot to dig his own grave, and hitting a pregnant woman who subsequently miscarried. Other allegations include the 1958 mass arrest and beating of 300 civilians by colonial forces. In the incident, it is alleged that the British forces left some civilians behind, thinking they were dead. A woman provided details of her rape in a forest, at the age of 16, by members of the British Special Forces, and her subsequent \\"brutal interrogation\\" regarding her connection to EOKA which included a mock execution and forcibly wearing a noose.Eoka fighters win first historical torture battle in UK court In another incident, a man lost his kidney following an interrogation at the notorious \\"Red House\\" building in Limassol. Following the release of the documents, EOKA veterans announced that lawsuits were being planned against British authorities.\\"Cypriots to sue U.K. for alleged torture in '50s\\" , Herald News, 1 November 2012 The veterans association alleged that at least 14 Cypriots died and hundreds more could have been \\"tortured during interrogations\\" by the British during the 1955‚Äì1959 campaign. Two of those who allegedly died during interrogation were aged 17. The legal action comes on the back of the uncovering of secret documents released in 2011 which present similar practices during the Mau Mau Uprising in Kenya, during the same period. In 2018, Cypriot veterans won the right to claim damages over UK torture claims at court. The presiding judge dismissed arguments by the British government that the case should be judged under Cypriot law, which, if true, would have meant that the statute of limitations applied in the case. The judge commented that \\"It seems to me that, in this case at any rate, where a state stands to be held to account for acts of violence against its citizens, it should be held to account in its own courts, by its own law and should not escape liability by reference to a colonial law it has itself made.\\" The case was settled out-of-court with the UK awarding Greek Cypriots with ¬£1 million (to be distributed among alleged victims). The UK government refused any liability.

History Leibstadt Nuclear Power Plant Leibstadt is first mentioned about 1240 as Leibesteit. In the 13th and 14th Centuries it was ruled by the Habsburgs. In 1323 two mills are mentioned in Leibstadt. After the 1415 conquest of the Aargau, the two parts of the village (Oberleibstadt and Unterleibstadt, separated by a creek) were ruled separately by various overlords. The former was part of the Austrian district of Laufenburg, while the latter was part of the Swiss Confederation's district of Leuggern in the County of Baden. As a border village, Leibstadt was in danger any time the Habsburgs and the Confederation fought. A chronicle records that on 1 March 1499 men from Gansingen and Mettau attacked and burned most of the villages in the area, including Leibstadt.Leibstadt municipal website accessed 12 May 2016 Between 1635-1798 the villages of Leibstadt and Schwaderloch formed the Roll'sche district of Bernau. Until 1816 Oberleibstadt belonged to the municipality of Leuggern and then formed its own political municipality (until 1832 it included Full-Reuenthal) within the Zurzach district. Unterleibstadt was an independent political municipality in the Laufenburg district. In 1866 the two municipalities merged to form Leibstadt and became part of the Zurzach district. The first school was founded in 1756 by the Knights order from Leuggern. In 1880 Leibstadt resigned from the parish of Leuggern and formed their own Catholic parish (which included Schwaderloch between 1818-1953). The village chapel burned down in 1871 was replaced in 1879-80 with the present parish church. A railway station was opened in Leibstadt in 1892, serving the Koblenz-Stein-S√§ckingen line. However this closed in 1993 and only a Postauto bus travels to the municipality now. Into the latter half of the 20th Century, agriculture was the main source of industry and income in Leibstadt. In 1973 the nuclear power company, Leibstadt AG was founded to build a power plant in Leibstadt. The largest nuclear power plant in Switzerland, which cost about 4.8 billion CHF, came online in 1984. It produces about 7.2 billion kWh of electricity per year and provides about three fifths of the jobs in the community. Geography Aerial view (1949) Leibstadt has an area, , of .

The municipality is located in the Zurzach district, between the Wandfluh and Rhine rivers. It consists of the haufendorf village (an irregular, unplanned and quite closely packed village, built around a central square) of Leibstadt and the hamlet of Bernau. In 1866 the municipality was created when the formerly independent villages of Oberleibstadt and Unterleibstadt merged.Amtliches Gemeindeverzeichnis der Schweiz published by the Swiss Federal Statistical Office accessed 14 January 2010 Coat of arms The blazon of the municipal coat of arms is Gules a Bend per bend Argent and Sable.Flags of the World.com accessed 20-June-2010 Demographics Leibstadt has a population () of , 36.6% of the population are foreign nationals.Swiss Federal Statistical Office - Superweb database - Gemeinde Statistics 1981-2008 accessed 19 June 2010 Over the last 10 years (1997‚Äì2007) the population has changed at a rate of -2.4%.

Unlike a fable, the moral is more important than the narrative details. As with the parable, the apologue is a tool of rhetorical argument used to convince or persuade. Among the best known ancient and classical examples are that of Jotham in the Book of Judges (9:7-15); \\"The Belly and its Members,\\" by the patrician Agrippa Menenius Lanatus in the second book of Livy; and perhaps most famous of all, those of Aesop. Well-known modern examples of this literary form include George Orwell's Animal Farm and the Br'er Rabbit stories derived from African and Cherokee cultures and recorded and synthesized by Joel Chandler Harris. The term is applied more particularly to a story in which the actors or speakers are either various kinds of animals or are inanimate objects. An apologue is distinguished from a fable in that there is always some moral sense present in the former, which there need not be in the latter. An apologue is generally dramatic, and has been defined as \\"a satire in action.\\" An apologue differs from a parable in several respects. A parable is equally an ingenious tale intended to correct manners, but it can be true in the sense that \\"when this kind of actual event happens among men, this is what it means and this is how we should think about it\\", while an apologue, with its introduction of animals and plants, to which it lends ideas, language and emotions, contains only metaphoric truth: \\"when this kind of situation exists anywhere in the world, here is an interesting truth about it.\\" The parable reaches heights to which the apologue cannot aspire, for the points in which animals and nature present analogies to man are principally those of his lower nature (hunger, desire, pain, fear, etc.), and the lessons taught by the apologue seldom therefore reach beyond prudential morality (keep yourself safe, find ease where you can, plan for the future, don't misbehave or you'll eventually be caught and punished), whereas the parable aims at representing the relations between man and existence or higher powers (know your role in the universe, behave well towards all you encounter, kindness and respect are of higher value than cruelty and slander). It finds its framework in the world of nature as it actually is, and not in any parody of it, and it exhibits real and not fanciful analogies. The apologue seizes on that which humans have in common with other creatures, and the parable on that which we have in common with a greater existence. Still, in spite of the difference of moral level, Martin Luther thought so highly of apologues as counselors of virtue that he edited and revised Aesop and wrote a characteristic preface to the volume. for the main text, but the origin of the examples is unclear. The parable is always blunt and devoid of subtlety, and requires no interpretation; the apologue by nature necessitates at least some degree of reflection and thought to achieve understanding, and in this sense it demands more of the listener than the parable does. The origin of the apologue is extremely ancient and comes from the Middle East and its surrounding area (Persia, Asia Minor, Egypt, etc.), which is the Classical fatherland of everything connected with allegory, metaphor and imagination. Veiled truth was often necessary in the Middle East, particularly among the slaves, who dared not reveal their minds too openly. The two fathers of apologue in the West were slaves, namely Aesop and Phaedrus. La Fontaine in France; Gay and Dodsley in England; Gellert, Lessing and Hagedorn in Germany; Tomas de Iriarte in Spain, and Krylov in Russia, were leading later writers of apologues. Length is not an essential matter in the definition of an apologue. Those of La Fontaine are often very short, as, for example, \\"Le Coq et la Perle\\" (\\"The Cock and the Pearl\\"). \\"A cock was once strutting up and down the farmyard among the hens when suddenly he espied something shining amid the straw. ‚ÄúHo! ho!‚Äù quoth he, ‚Äúthat‚Äôs for me,‚Äù and soon rooted it out from beneath the straw. What did it turn out to be but a Pearl that by some chance had been lost in the yard? ‚ÄúYou may be a treasure,‚Äù quoth Master Cock, ‚Äúto men that prize you, but for me I would rather have a single barley-corn than a peck of pearls.‚Äù On the other hand, in the romances of Reynard the Fox we have medieval apologues arranged in cycles, and attaining epical dimensions. An Italian fabulist, Corti, is said to have developed an apologue of \\"The Talking Animals\\" reaching twenty-six cantos. La Motte, writing at a time when this species of literature was universally admired, attributes its popularity to the fact that it manages and flatters amour-propre by inculcating virtue in an amusing manner without seeming to dictate or insist. This was the ordinary 18th-century view of the matter, but Rousseau contested the educational value of instruction given in this indirect form. A work by P. Soull√©, La Fontaine et ses devanciers (1866), is a history of the apologue from the earliest times until its final triumph in France. Montesquieu wrote a propos his Persian Letters \\"There are certain truths of which it is not enough to persuade, but which must be made to be felt. Such are the moral verities. Perhaps a bit of history will be more touching than subtle philosophy.\\" See also *Traditional story External links * Based on 'Air-Fire-Water-Shame' (Spanish).

These Juntas were defeated shortly after, and the cities fell again under Spanish control. The May Revolution of 1810 ousted the viceroy in Buenos Aires, which established its own junta. Buenos Aires sent three military campaigns to the Charcas, headed by Juan Jos√© Castelli, Manuel Belgrano and Jos√© Rondeau, but the royalists ultimately prevailed over each one. However, the conflict grew into a guerrilla war, the War of the Republiquetas, preventing the royalists from strengthening their presence. After Sim√≥n Bol√≠var and Antonio Jos√© de Sucre defeated the royalists in northern South America, Sucre led a campaign that was to defeat the royalists in Charcas for good when the last royalist general, Pedro Antonio Ola√±eta, suffered death and defeat at the hands of his own defected forces at the battle of Tumusla. Bolivian independence was proclaimed on August 6 of 1825. The Colonial Governing Power and the Causes of the War Charcas (modern day Bolivia) is also sometimes referred to as the Upper Peru. This region fell under the authority of Spanish colonial rule in the sixteenth century. It was originally placed directly under the rule of the Viceroyalty of Peru, however this location proved to be too distant for effective ruling so Phillip II established the Audiencia of Charcas, which was an autonomous governing body under the purview of the viceroy of Peru. This governing was composed of oidores or judges and a governor with the title of president of the Audiencia. The Audiencia was given authority to make final decisions when a viceroy was unavailable or absent. The Audiencia was centered in Chuquisaca, which started out as an indigenous community and later became known by its post-independence name, Sucre. This was the center of administration as well as cultural activities for Charcas. The Archbishop of Charcas lived there and one of the prominent universities in Bolivia, was founded there. The Audiencia was a great honor for the Charcas. Oidores mostly came directly from Spain and tended to be very proud, often making everyone bow to them. They were also incredibly ignorant about the peoples' needs and problems. As Spanish settlements expanded to the south, the jurisdiction of the Audiencia of Charcas grew to include not only present day Bolivia, but also Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay and even parts of Peru. In 1776, the Audiencia of Charcas was placed under the authority of the viceroy of Buenos Aires in the newly created Viceroyalty of the R√≠o de la Plata and most trade was redirected to Buenos Aires. This change was against Peruvian desires because they had wanted to keep Charcas for its enormous wealth in the mines of Potos√≠. For the next few decades, the question of the political and economic ties with Charcas was constantly fought over by Peru and R√≠o de la Plata. On May 25, 1809 the citizens of Sucre participated in the first outbreak that was part of the initiation of the war of independence in Bolivia. In 1784 the Spanish rulers created the intendancy system. Four main intendancies were constructed in La Paz, Cochabamba, Potos√≠, and Chuquisaca. This system gave authority to a few, skillful and educated men who were directly responsible to the King of Spain. This system was implemented to increase revenue as well as to stop specific problems that had resulted from other authorities misusing their power. The system consequently limited the power of the Audiencia. The Bolivian people were divided into three main categories: Criollos, Mestizos, and the indigenous population. In authority over all of these people were the Peninsulares, who were influential people who had come from Spain to assume a leadership position in the church or government, in one of the Spanish colonies. All the rest of the Bolivian people had a social status beneath this elite class. The Criollos were people of pure Spanish descent who had been born in Latin America. The Criollos were envious of the power the Peninsulares held, and this attitude formed part of the basis for the War of Independence. Beneath the Criollos on the social hierarchy were the Mestizos, who were a mix of Spanish and Indigenous descent. The main reason these two people mixed was because of the lack of Spanish women in the region. Finally, at the bottom of the hierarchy was the biggest social class, the indigenous people, who primarily spoke Aymara and Quechua. These people often did not know what was going on politically in the country. However they offered a large force of fighting men for both the patriots and the royalists in the war. Nevertheless, in the War of Independence they proved to be very unpredictable and would, at times, turn on the army at any provocation. These people would generally fight for whoever controlled that area, whether loyalists, patriots, or royalists. The majority of the time it was the Republiquetas who controlled the rural areas where the Natives lived. Although they would fight for whomever, these people favored the patriots because they were part native, whereas the other armies were of pure Spanish descent. The real intention of the Indigenous people was to reestablish the Incan empire and so they wanted a form of government different from all three of the other groups. These groups all contented for the Natives' assistance in order to win the war; however not one army ever thought of liberating these people. Independence was not a new idea in the minds of the people of the Charcas. This concept had begun to take root long before and already signs of discontent with current form of government were beginning to show. The individuals in every class of the Bolivian population had become dissatisfied - the Criollos, the Mestizos, as well as the Indigenous people. They were all feeling the effects of increased Spanish taxes and trade restrictions. Indigenous rebellions started in 1730 in Cochabamba and others followed in the decades to come. Although most of the people were discontented, the different social classes were not unified in their solution to the dilemma. The indigenous wanted to do away with all the Spanish people and set up an Andean Utopia, whereas the Criollos simply desired more freedom from Spain. The Criollos were very racist against the Native population and so these two people groups never really united against Spain. much revolutionary ideas were spread from the University in Chuquisaca. In the early 1780s different students in the University distributed pamphlets in Charcas. These were written against Spanish authority and in them public officials were even called thieves. The ideas of independence really stemmed from Aquinas, a church father, who wrote about politics. He taught that if a ruler is cruel and tyrannical the people have a right to rebel and fight against their own government. The ruler should be under the Pope, thus the people can rebel against the King but not against God. There was not one main leader of the Revolutionaries or Radicals. Nevertheless, three main men were influential in this circle: Jaime Zuda√±ez, Manuel Zuda√±ez, and Bernardo Monteagudo. Jaime Zuda√±ez was part of the Audiencia in the department of the defense of the poor. He would try to influence the decisions the Audiencia made and no one suspected his treasonous behavior. Manuel Zude√±ez, his brother, was in the government as well and held an important position in the University in Chuquisaca. Finally Bernardo Monteagudo was a writer from a poor family but had an impact on the people through his whispering campaigns. All three of these men were in favor of doing away with the president, Ram√≥n Garc√≠a Le√≥n de Pizarro. The juntas of 1809 During the Peninsular War which took place in Spain, Charcas (today Bolivia) closely followed the reports that arrived describing the rapidly evolving political situation in Spain, which led the Peninsula to near anarchy. The sense of uncertainty was heightened by the fact that news of the March 17 Mutiny of Aranjuez and the May 6, 1808 abdication of Ferdinand VII in favor of Joseph Bonaparte arrived within a month of each other, on August 21 and September 17, respectively. In the confusion that followed, various juntas in Spain and Portuguese Princess Carlotta, sister of Ferdinand VII, in Brazil claimed authority over the Americas. On November 11, the representative of the Junta of Seville, Jos√© Manuel de Goyeneche, arrived in Chuquisaca, after stopping in Buenos Aires, with instructions to secure Charcas' recognition of authority of the Seville Junta. He also brought with him a letter from Princess Carlotta requesting the recognition of her right to rule in her brother's absence. The President- Intendant Ram√≥n Garc√≠a Le√≥n de Pizarro, backed by the Archbishop of Chuquisaca Benito Mar√≠a de Mox√≥ y Francol√≠, was inclined to recognize the Seville Junta, but the mostly Peninsular Audiencia of Charcas, in its function as a privy council for the President (the real acuerdo), felt it would be hasty to recognize either one. A fist fight almost broke between the senior oidor and Goyeneche over the issue, but the oidores' opinion prevailed. The Radicals or Revolutionaries supported the Audiencia's decision because it put the power more into the hands of the people in Latin America as well as because it was a \\"temporary\\" split with Spain during this time of tribulation in the land of Spain. Over the next few weeks Garc√≠a Le√≥n and Mox√≥ became convinced that recognizing Carlotta might be the best way to preserve the unity of the empire, but this was unpopular with the majority of Charcasvians and the Audiencia. The President and the Archbishop grew very unpopular with the oidores because the archbishop informed the people on every bit of news that arrived from Spain. The Audiencia wanted to conceal the information in order to not acknowledge their own weaknesses. During this time the Catholic Church in Charcas split from the \\"Audiencia\\" because of the tension between Mox√≥ and the Oidores. 100 years of struggle for independence: 25 de Mayo de 1809 on a commemorative stamp. On May 26, 1809, the Audiencia oidores received rumors that Garc√≠a Le√≥n de Pizarro planned to arrest them in order to recognize Carlotta. The Audiencia decided that the situation had become so anarchic both in Charcas and in the Peninsula, that Charcas needed to take the government into its own hands. It removed Garc√≠a Le√≥n de Pizarro from office and transformed itself into a junta, which ruled in Fernando's name, just as cities and provinces had done in Spain a year earlier. A second junta was established in La Paz on July 16 by Criollos who took over the local barracks and deposed both the intendant and bishop of La Paz. The La Paz junta clearly broke with any authority in Spain and with the authorities in Buenos Aires. Jos√© de la Serna, the Spanish Viceroy in Lima dispatched five thousand soldiers led by none other than Goyeneche, who had become the president of Audiencia in Cuzco. The rebels were defeated and the leaders of the movement were hanged or sentenced to imprisonment for life. The Audiencia had to beg for mercy as well as make an agreement with the Royalists so that the city of Chuquisaca would not be left in ruin by the army. This rebellion was stopped, however the yearning for freedom was far from extinguished. After Buenos Aires successfully established a junta in May 1810, Charcas came under the control of the Viceroyalty of Peru and managed to fight off several attempts to take over it militarily. The Peninsulares had very divided opinions regarding which form of government was that best and what claims from Spain were actually true, thus they unconsciously left room for other groups to take the initiative for the future of Charcas. The Criollos were excited about this break between the President and the Audiencia because they took it as an excellent opportunity to gain the power they had always craved but never obtained because of the Spanish government. These upper class Criollos were divided into three main sections. The first one was very influenced by the Peninsulares and so did not desire anything to change. The second sector longed for an independent government. The final group was made up of the Radicals who wanted an independent government, not to solely accomplish that end, but to bring about deeper social reforms. The middle class Criollos as well as the Mestizos did not actively participate in expressing their opinions because they lacked leadership but were very attentive to all that was happening during the war. The republiquetas From 1810 to 1824, the idea of independence was kept alive by six guerrilla bands that formed in the backcountry of Charcas. The areas they controlled are called republiquetas (\\"petty republics\\") in the historiography of Bolivia. The republiquetas were located in the Lake Titicaca region, Mizque, Vallegrande, Ayopaya, the countryside around Sucre, the southern region near today's Argentina and Santa Cruz de la Sierra. The republiquetas were led by caudillos whose power was based on their personality and ability to win military engagements. This allowed them to create quasi-states which attracted varied followers, ranging from political exiles of the main urban centers to cattle rustlers and other fringe members of Criollo and Mestizo society. These Criollo and Mestizo republiquetas often allied themselves with the local Indian communities, although it was not always possible to keep the Natives' loyalty, since their own material and political interests often eclipsed the idea of regional independence. Ultimately the republiquetas never had the size nor organization to actually bring about the independence of Charcas, but instead maintained a fifteen-year stalemate with royalist regions, while holding off attempts by Buenos Aires to control the area. Most of these quasi states were so isolated that they had no knowledge that the others even existed. During the time of the Republiquetas the radicals in Argentina had succeeded in winning the independence of the country on May 25, 1810. Since Charcas was included in the Viceroyalty of R√≠o de la Plata the radicals were interested in freeing Charcas as well. The citizens of Charcas showed their support of this through an uprising against the Royalists. Three armies were sent over from Argentina from 1810 to 1817. The first army sent was led by Juan Jos√© Castelli. After his victory, he arrested the president of the Audiencia, the intendant of Potos√≠, as well as a Royalist general. The people protested against this act because these people were respected in the community although they on the opposing side. Castelli did not heed their plead but executed them anyway because they would not submit to Argentina. The Argentinian army looted, stole, killed, and misused the citizens of Potos√≠. They not only disrespected the women there, they also killed those who attempted to stop this behavior. Eventually they left to go conquer Chuquisaca. Castelli went from city to city in Charcas freeing the people from Royalist forces, but destroying the cities and mistreating its citizens in the process. Despite all of this, he did try to make reforms to free the indigenous and improve their quality of life. He finally arrived at the border of Viceroyalty of Lima and stopped and made a treaty with Goyeneche, yet he did not respect the treaty and kept expanding. Therefore, on June 20, 1811 Goyeneche attacked Castelli's army, causing them to flee back toward Argentina. They were forced to bypass Oruro and other cities because the people there wanted revenge for the trouble they had caused. Goyeneche did not continue pursuing Castelli's army, but instead paused and cared for all the wounded. Castelli nonetheless, was eventually run out of the country and the Royalists took control. Two more auxiliary armies from Argentina followed but both were eventually defeated. The areas of Charcas which remained under royalist control elected a representative to the Cortes of C√°diz, Mariano Rodr√≠guez Olmedo, who served from May 4, 1813, to May 5, 1814. Rodr√≠guez Olmedo was a conservative representative, signing the 1814 request, known as the \\"Manifesto of the Persians\\" (\\"Manifiesto de los Persas\\"), by seventy Cortes delegates to Ferdinand VII to repeal the Spanish Constitution of 1812.} Independence consolidated Meanwhile, Sim√≥n Bol√≠var, who is considered by some to be the Napoleon of South America, and Jos√© de San Mart√≠n were endeavoring to free the surrounding territories in Latin America. San Mart√≠n, who was originally from Argentina, had liberated Chile and then moved on to Peru. Mart√≠n believed that to completely eliminate Spanish rule in Latin America they had to defeat the Royalists in Peru. Charcas was then under the Viceroyalty of Lima and thus liberating Peru would lead to the liberation of Charcas as well. Therefore, because of this strong conviction that as long as Spain controlled the seas they would have a foothold on the continent, he created a fleet led by Lord Cochrane, who had joined the Chilean service in 1819. Mart√≠n took over Lima in July 1821 and declared Peruvian independence. There Mart√≠n encountered much resistance from the Royalists who remained. During that time, his army began to crumple because of disease as well as soldiers abandoning the army. Mart√≠n was left with no choice but to beg Bol√≠var for his help. Although Bol√≠var and Mart√≠n met, they could not agree on the form of government that should be established for the liberated countries and so both went on their separate ways for the time being. Mart√≠n returned to Peru, only to face the a revolution in Lima that had started because the men left behind were incapable of governing the country. He resigned from his position as Protector of Peru, discouraged. Bol√≠var was convinced that it was his duty to rid the continent of the Spanish, and so journeyed to Lima. When he arrived on September 1, 1823, he immediately took command. The fight for independence gained new impetus after the December 9, 1824, Battle of Ayacucho, in which a combined army of 5,700 Gran Colombian and Peruvian troops under the command of Antonio Jos√© de Sucre defeated the royalist army of 6,500 and captured its leader, Jos√© de la Serna. However, Royalist armies still remained, which were the stronghold at El Callao and the army of General Ola√±eta in Charcas. The army at El Callao was easily defeated but Ola√±eta's army proved to be more difficult. Ola√±eta was rumored to have planned to surrender Charcas to Brazil in 1824 in order to keep the country under Spanish control. He had asked for Brazil to send over an army; however, the governor of Brazil refused to become involved. Bol√≠var and San Mart√≠n both desired to make an agreement with Ola√±eta because he had helped them in the battle of Ayacucho. Sucre, Bol√≠var's most successful general, did not trust Ola√±eta and so despite his plan to make peace, he started to occupy Charcas. Sucre prepared to persuade this Royalist general, either with works or by force. Bol√≠var assumed that Ola√±eta would take a long time deciding what to do and planned to travel to Charcas during that time. However, Ola√±eta had planned one more sudden attack. Sucre invited the men of Charcas to join him and in January 1825, a large number of men from Ola√±eta's army deserted him and joined Sucre. On March 9, Sucre had succeeded in capturing every Royalist general there except for Ola√±eta. Yet this fierce general refused to surrender. Finally on April 13, part Ola√±eta's forces joined the patriots and mutinied. Ola√±eta was fatally wounded in the ensuing battle. At last, Spain had relinquished its grip on South America, the final battles being fought in Charcas. \\"Sucre called this city the cradle of American Independence.\\" The reason for this statement was that La Paz was the first place people were murdered for the desire for independence and now, decades later, the last Royalist forces had been defeated. What remained of the royalist forces dissolved because of mutiny and desertion. On April 25, 1825 Sucre stepped foot in Chuquisaca, which had been the hub of Spanish dominion. The citizens of the city rejoiced, gathering along the road. The town council, clergy, and the university students all congregated at the edge of Chuquisaca to greet Sucre. The people even went as far as preparing a Roman chariot pulled by twelve maidens dressed in blue and white to pull Sucre into the heart of the city. Sucre called a meeting on July 10 in Chuquisaca to decide the fate of the country of Charcas. There were three options that the committee could decide from. Charcas could unite with Argentina, unite with Peru, or become independent. Bol√≠var's desire was for Charcas to unite with Peru; however, the council was in favor of becoming an independent nation. Although they did not all vote for this, all signed the declaration of independence on August 6, 1825. Although no one disputes that Bolivia was named after Bol√≠var, there are differences in opinion over why that actually happened. Some historians say that it is because the people were afraid Bol√≠var would be against the vote because Bol√≠var wanted Charcas to join Peru. Because of this, they proceeded to name the newly formed country after him to appease him. The Bolivian population still celebrates Bol√≠var's birthday as a national holiday to honor him. Bol√≠var was president for five months, during which time he reduced taxes, and reformed the land organization to aid the indigenous population. He left Sucre as president when he returned to govern the North. Sucre attempted to reduce the taxes that the indigenous were forced to pay. However, this plan failed because without it, he was not able to support the Gran Colombian Army which stopped the Argentinians from invading Bolivia again. Thus the system remained in place. From then on, local elites dominated the congress and although they supported Sucre's efforts, they chafed under the idea that a Gran Colombian army remained in the nation. After an attempt on his life, Sucre resigned the presidency of Bolivia in April 1828 and returned to Venezuela. The Bolivian Congress elected La Paz native Andr√©s de Santa Cruz as the new president. Santa Cruz had been a former royalist officer, served under Jos√© de San Mart√≠n after 1821 and then under Sucre in Ecuador, and had a short term as president of Peru from 1826 to 1827. Santa Cruz arrived in Bolivia in May 1829 and assumed office. Independence did not provide solidarity to the nation. For six decades afterward, the country had feeble and short governing institutions. Brief annexation by the Province of Mato Grosso Spain, which betrayed Portugal in 1807 (its ally until then) to ally with France, saw himself betrayed by Napoleon, whom imprisoned the Spanish royal family and nominated his brother, Jos√© Bonaparte, as King of Spain, title unrecognized by the population which resisted the French occupation. Thus, with the political vacuum created by the absence of its King, that is, by the absence of a central government, the Spanish Empire started to dismantle itself. Independence movements started to surge in all Hispanic America, spreading war and chaos. In face of this sensation of unsafety and fearing the chaos, in June 1822, the three governors of the Spanish departments of Alto Peru (which had already being threatened by the troops of General Antonio Jose de Sucre and Simon Bolivar), reunited in Cuiaba (Capital of the Captaincy of Mato Grosso / Brazil) and solicited the governor that he interceded along with the Prince Regent Dom Pedro (that soon would be crowned as Dom Pedro I, Emperor of Brazil), in order that the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves annexed these territories, seeking to spare its population from the massacre and the chaos. Immediately, the governor of Mato Grosso sent troops that were by his captaincy to the Alto Peru, blocking the advance of Bolivar and Sucre, and sent a letter to Dom Pedro, communicating him about the sending of troops and the solicitation of the authorities of Alto Peru (that later on would become Bolivia). Letter which was only received by Dom Pedro I in November 1822, when Brazil was already an independent nation. Besides, Bolivar and Sucre were quicker and sent representatives to the City of Rio de Janeiro, which came before the governor's letter. In this way, when the Prince Regent received the letter he had already decided not to annex Alto Peru, rejecting the solicitation from the governors of the region and ordering that the troops were removed from there. With this, Dom Pedro I left the region of Alto Peru (modern Bolivia) up to its own luck, what culminated with the invasion of the Bolivar and Sucre troops and the Bolivian independence from Spain. Clearly at that moment, Dom Pedro I was more worried in defeating the resistance of the liberal Portuguese troops on Brazilian soil, guaranteeing Brazilian unity. However without this decision being made Bolivian territory may have been integrated into Brazil.

Considered to be one of the fastest bowlers in Pakistan after Shoaib Akhtar and Waqar Younis, Sami was the first bowler in cricket to notch hat-tricks in all three formats of the game. Sami is known for his quick yorkers, traditional spin and good wide balls. Domestic career Sami joined the Indian Cricket League following the tour of India in December 2007. He played for the Lahore Badshahs, a team composed entirely of Pakistani cricketers, during the Indian Premier League's second Twenty20 tournament. His participation in the league meant that he, like many other Pakistan players, he was banned from representing his country at both international level and domestic cricket in Pakistan. Sami was bought by Islamabad United for US$50,000 in the Pakistan Super League. He finished the season as the 2nd highest wicket-taker for his team and 4th overall in the tournament with 12 wickets in 7 matches. He was retained by Islamabad United in 2017 season again finishing the season as 2nd highest wicket-taker for his team. He is the second leading wicket-taker with 24 wickets in 16 matches. In 2013, Sami was retained by the BPL team, Duronto Rajshahi to play as the main fast bowler, but cause of disagreements between PCB and BCB no Pakistani player (including Sami) was allowed to play in the BPL. This was a big loss for Duronto, because sami was the highest wicket-taker last season. He was the leading wicket-taker for Karachi Whites in the 2017‚Äì18 Quaid-e-Azam Trophy, with 28 dismissals in five matches. In April 2018, he was named in Punjab's squad for the 2018 Pakistan Cup. In October 2018, he was named in the squad for the Rajshahi Kings team, following the draft for the 2018‚Äì19 Bangladesh Premier League. In March 2019, he was named in Punjab's squad for the 2019 Pakistan Cup.  International career  =Golden years= Sami, initially named as the modern Malcolm Marshall by Imran Khan, made his Test cricket debut against New Zealand in 2001 by taking 8 wickets for 106 runs in the match, including five wickets in the second innings. This was a world record for the most wickets by a debutant. During his third Test match he achieved a hat-trick against Sri Lanka and in 2002 he took his second hat-trick in his career, against the West Indies during a One Day International match. This led to him becoming one of only a two bowlers in cricket (the other was Wasim Akram) to achieve this mark in both forms of the game. He also displayed excellent performances against Zimbabwe and New Zealand in 2003. On 1 December 2003, he achieved his best bowling figures in One Day International cricket by taking 5 wickets for 10 runs during a match. Earlier in April during that year in Sharjah in the United Arab Emirates, he had taken 4 wickets for 25 runs against Kenya during the match. Sami played his 50th One Day International match against India at Lahore in Pakistan on 24 March 2004. He has also taken over 100 wickets in First-class cricket and in List A cricket. =Loss of form= Sami also earned the ignominy of bowling the longest over in One Day International cricket during the Asia Cup match against Bangladesh in 2004, when he bowled 17 balls in one over which consisted of seven wides and four no-balls. He is also the only bowler in Test cricket history to have over 50 wickets and a bowling average of 50. After losing form and failing to achieve success for the Pakistan cricket team, the Pakistan Cricket Board and its national selectors replaced Sami for the One Day International series against England with fast bowler Mohammad Asif, however he was recalled for the series against South Africa in January and February in 2007. He was selected in the 15-man Pakistan squad for the 2007 Cricket World Cup, although he was named as one of five reserves. After teammates Shoaib Akhtar and Mohammad Asif were dropped from the World Cup squad, since neither of the two had been declared fit and they had not undergone official doping tests, Sami and Yasir Arafat were called up as replacements.. =Comeback= In 2009‚Äì2010, he was recalled back to the Pakistan team and on 3 January 2010, during Pakistan's Test match series against Australia, he played at the Sydney Cricket Ground in Australia and took 3 wickets for 27 runs in the first innings of the second Test match. On 19 April he was selected in the Pakistan squad as a replacement for the injured fast bowler Umar Gul, in the 2010 ICC World Twenty20 cricket tournament to be held in the West Indies. Sami was recalled and played against South Africa in the middle east in November 2010. In May 2012 Sami received another recall and was announced in the squad that toured Sri Lanka in June 2012, because of his amazing performances in the Bangladesh premier league (which included a hat trick and a 5-wicket haul). He bowled brilliantly in the 2nd T20I. Following that, in the 1st ODI he bowled economically and with pace, which earned him a place in the 15-man squad to play the touring Australians and also the 2012 ICC World Twenty20. Sami was selected for these international tours, but didn't get to play an official game (he got to play two warm up matches), as Pakistan made it to the semi-finals, but lost to Sri- lanka. In May 2015, Sami was selected for the T20I side that is going to play Zimbabwe in Lahore. This happened after impressive performances in the Faysal Bank T20I cup. Sami made comeback in the home series against Zimbabwe. In his comeback match, Mohammad Sami took three wickets for Pakistan. Sami has been included in Pakistan squad for the 2016 ICC World Twenty20 as a result of strong performances in the BPL, the PSL & the Asia Cup where he bowled accurately at more than 140 km/h on a consistent basis. Bowling action Sami is regarded as one of the fastest bowlers in world cricket and has the ability to swing the cricket ball at high pace. He has unofficially bowled the fastest delivery in cricket when he clocked at 164 km/h (101.9 mph) during a One Day International match. However, it was revoked by cricket officials after it found faulty speed measurements on the speed meter. However, despite his speed, he has been in and out of the national side for several times. However he has received support from former Pakistan captain Wasim Akram & Waqar Younis, who sees Sami's speed and wicket taking ability as an important skill for the Pakistan team.

It is the seat of the Municipality of Izola. Its name originates from Italian Isola, which means 'island'. History Izola Tower An ancient Roman port and settlement known as Haliaetum stood to the southwest of the present town, next to the village of Jagodje, as early as the 2nd century BC. The town of Izola was established on a small island by refugees from Aquileia in the 7th century . The coastal areas of Istria came under Venetian influence in the 9th century. The settlement was first mentioned in writing as Insula in a Venetian document entitled Liber albus in 932AD.Izola-Isola municipal website It became definitely the territory of the Republic of Venice in 1267, and the centuries of Venetian rule left a strong and enduring mark on the region. The Venetian part of the peninsula passed to the Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation in 1797 with the Treaty of Campo Formio, until the period of Napoleonic rule from 1805 to 1813 when Istria became part of the Illyrian provinces of the Napoleonic Empire. After this short period, during which Izola's walls were torn down and used to fill in the channel that separated the island from the mainland, the newly established Austrian Empire ruled Istria until November 1918.Entry for Izola in the Lonely Planet Guide to Slovenia The treaty of Saint Germain assigned Izola and the rest of the Istria region to Italy. The Italian-speaking population was the majority according to the Austro-Hungarian census of 1900: of 5,363 inhabitants, 5,326 spoke Italian, 20 Slovene, and 17 German. Istria became part of the Kingdom of Italy, until Italian capitulation in September 1943, whereupon control passed to Germany. Izola was liberated by a naval unit from Koper at the end of April 1945. After the end of World War II, Izola was part of Zone B of the provisionally independent Free Territory of Trieste; after the de facto dissolution of the Free Territory in 1954 it was incorporated into Slovenia, then a part of Yugoslavia.Izola Municipality site The newly defined Italo-Yugoslav border saw the migration of many people from one side to the other. In Izola's case, many Italian speakers chose to leave, and in their place Slovenian-speaking people from neighbouring villages settled in the town. In 1820, a thermal spring was discovered in Izola, leading to the town's earliest forms of tourism. Between 1902 and 1935 the Parenzana, a narrow-gauge railway line, connected the town to Trieste and Poreƒç (known as Parenzo until 1947).

The law defines \\"child in utero\\" as \\"a member of the species Homo sapiens, at any stage of development, who is carried in the womb.\\"Text of Unborn Victims of Violence Act . The law is codified in two sections of the United States Code: Title 18, Chapter 1 (Crimes), ¬ß1841 (18 USC 1841) and Title 10, Chapter 22 (Uniform Code of Military Justice) ¬ß919a (Article 119a). The law applies only to certain offenses over which the United States government has jurisdiction, including certain crimes committed on federal properties, against certain federal officials and employees, and by members of the military. In addition, it covers certain crimes that are defined by statute as federal offenses wherever they occur, no matter who commits them, such as certain crimes of terrorism. Because of principles of federalism embodied in the United States Constitution, federal criminal law does not apply to crimes prosecuted by the individual states. However, 38 states also recognize the fetus or \\"unborn child\\" as a crime victim, at least for purposes of homicide or feticide. \\"State Homicide Laws That Recognize Unborn Victims.\\" The legislation was both hailed and vilified by various legal observers who interpreted the measure as a step toward granting legal personhood to human fetuses, even though the bill explicitly contained a provision excepting abortion, stating that the bill would not \\"be construed to permit the prosecution\\" \\"of any person for conduct relating to an abortion for which the consent of the pregnant woman, or a person authorized by law to act on her behalf\\", \\"of any person for any medical treatment of the pregnant woman or her unborn child\\" or \\"of any woman with respect to her unborn child.\\" However, the reticence of a federal law to authorize federal prosecution of a particular act committed under federal jurisdiction does not prevent states from passing their own laws against the act committed under their jurisdiction. Meanwhile, the definition of all unborn babies as \\"members of the species homo sapiens\\" in section (d) says essentially what proposed \\"personhood\\" laws say. Sponsors of such proposals say such legal language will trigger the \\"collapse\\" clause in Roe v. Wade, by establishing what they suggest Roe said must be established for legal abortion to end.Roe v. Wades \\"collapse\\" clause says: \\"The appellee and certain amici argue that the fetus is a 'person' within the language and meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment. In support of this, they outline at length and in detail the well-known facts of fetal development. If this suggestion of personhood is established, the appellant's case, of course, collapses, for the fetus' right to life would then be guaranteed specifically by the Amendment. The appellant conceded as much on reargument. On the other hand, the appellee conceded on reargument that no case could be cited that holds that a fetus is a person within the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment.\\" Several state supreme courts have ruled that sections (a) through (c) are not threatened by Roe,\\"Constitutional Challenges to State Unborn Victims (Fetal Homicide) Laws\\". but no court has addressed whether Roe can survive the suggested triggering of its \\"collapse\\" clause by section (d).

(Examples of fetal-death cases that could not be prosecuted prior to enactment of the Unborn Victims of Violence Act.) One exception was the \\"born-alive rule,\\" applied in US v. Spencer, 839 F.2d 1341 (9th Cir. 1988), a case in which the child was born alive and died shortly afterwards; therefore there was no doubt that the decedent was once a living person under the law. The Unborn Victims of Violence Act was first introduced in Congress in 1999 by then-Congressman (later Senator) Lindsey Graham (R-SC). It passed the House of Representatives in 1999 and 2001, but not the Senate. In 2003, the bill was reintroduced in the House as H.R. 1997 by Rep. Melissa Hart of Pennsylvania. It was ultimately co-sponsored by 136 other members of the House before it passed by a vote of 254 in favor to 163 against on February 26, 2004. After several amendments were rejected, it was passed in the Senate by a vote of 61-38 on March 25, 2004. It was signed into law by President George W. Bush on April 1, 2004.

At the signing ceremony, the President was joined on stage by men and women who had lost family members in two-victim crimes, including Laci Peterson's mother, Sharon Rocha. During his remarks at the ceremony, Bush said, \\"Any time an expectant mother is a victim of violence, two lives are in the balance, each deserving protection, and each deserving justice. If the crime is murder and the unborn child's life ends, justice demands a full accounting under the law.\\" Senator John Kerry, his main opponent in the 2004 Presidential election, voted against the bill, saying, \\"I have serious concerns about this legislation because the law cannot simultaneously provide that a fetus is a human being and protect the right of the mother to choose to terminate her pregnancy.\\" Support Anti-abortion organizations strongly supported the act. On July 3, 2003, the U.S. Judiciary Committee heard testimony for and against passage of the UVVA. Feminists for Life of America President Serrin Foster submitted her own testimony, as well as that of Sharon Rocha. In addition, Foster argued against passage of an alternative bill by Rep. Zoe Lofgren, which would have provided \\"additional punishment for certain crimes against women when the crimes cause an interruption in the normal course of their pregnancies\\" but not treated the unborn child as a second victim. \\"We are asking our elected representatives to honestly answer the question in the case of Laci Peterson and baby Conner,\\" Foster asked. \\"Was there one victim or two? Those who support the single-victim substitute would deny women justice.\\" Opposition The Unborn Victims of Violence Act was strongly opposed by most pro-choice organizations, on grounds that the U.S. Supreme Court's Roe v. Wade decision said that the human fetus is not a \\"person\\" under the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution, and that if the fetus were a Fourteenth Amendment \\"person,\\" then they would have a constitutional right to life. However, the laws of 38 states also recognize the human fetus as the legal victim of homicide (and often, other violent crimes) during the entire period of prenatal development (27 states) or during part of the prenatal period (nine states).\\"State Homicide Laws That Recognize Unborn Victims.\\" Legal challenges to these laws, arguing that they violate Roe v. Wade or other U.S. Supreme Court precedents, have been uniformly rejected by both the federal and the state courts, including the supreme courts of California, Pennsylvania, and Minnesota.Constitutional Challenges to State Unborn Victims (Fetal Homicide) Laws.\\" Some prominent legal scholars who strongly support Roe v. Wade, such as Prof. Walter Dellinger of Duke University Law School, Richard Parker of Harvard, and Sherry F. Colb of Rutgers Law School, have written that fetal homicide laws do not conflict with Roe v. Wade. A principle that allows language in law to not conflict with Roe, which logically should trigger Roe's \\"collapse\\" clause, was explained in Webster v. Reproductive Health Services, 492 US 490 (1989). Until such language becomes the basis for laws that specify penalties for abortion, the issue is not even before the court, of whether or not such language conflicts with Roe, and if so, which should be struck down.\\"...until those courts have applied the...state's view of when life begins...to restrict appellees' [abortionists'] activities in some concrete way, it is inappropriate for federal courts to address its meaning.\\" Webster v. Reproductive Health Services, 492 US 490 (1989). Sandra Day O'Connor added in a concurrence, \\"When the constitutional invalidity of a State's abortion statute actually turns upon the constitutional validity of Roe, there will be time enough to reexamine Roe, and to do so carefully.\\" Text of the law The operative portion of the law, now codified as Title 18, Section 1841 of the United States Code, reads as follows: Sec. 1841. Protection of unborn children : (a) (1) Whoever engages in conduct that violates any of the provisions of law listed in subsection (b) and thereby causes the death of, or bodily injury (as defined in section 1365) to, a child, who is in utero at the time the conduct takes place, is guilty of a separate offense under this section. ::(2) (A) Except as otherwise provided in this paragraph, the punishment for that separate offense is the same as the punishment provided under Federal law for that conduct had that injury or death occurred to the unborn child's mother. :::(B) An offense under this section does not require proof that‚Äî ::::(i) the person engaging in the conduct had knowledge or should have had knowledge that the victim of the underlying offense was pregnant; or ::::(ii) the defendant intended to cause the death of, or bodily injury to, the unborn child. :::(C) If the person engaging in the conduct thereby intentionally kills or attempts to kill the unborn child, that person shall instead of being punished under subparagraph (A), be punished as provided under sections 1111, 1112, and 1113 of this title for intentionally killing or attempting to kill a human being. :::(D) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the death penalty shall not be imposed for an offense under this section. :(b) The provisions referred to in subsection (a) are the following: ::(1) Sections 36, 37, 43, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 229, 242, 245, 247, 248, 351, 831, 844 (d), (f), (h)(1), and (i), 924 (j), 930, 1111, 1112, 1113, 1114, 1116, 1118, 1119, 1120, 1121, 1153 (a), 1201 (a), 1203, 1365 (a), 1501, 1503, 1505, 1512, 1513, 1751, 1864, 1951, 1952 (a)(1)(B), (a)(2)(B), and (a)(3)(B), 1958, 1959, 1992, 2113, 2114, 2116, 2118, 2119, 2191, 2231, 2241 (a), 2245, 2261, 2261A, 2280, 2281, 2332, 2332a, 2332b, 2340A, and 2441 of this title. ::(2) Section 408(e) of the Controlled Substances Act of 1970 (21 U.S.C. 848 (e)).

Harness of London, Ontario to promote the interests of the Province of Ontario within the Canadian confederation. Burns, a former Liberal and past president of the London-North-Centre Canadian Alliance riding association, and Harness, a former Progressive Conservative and regional organizer of the London area Reform Party of Canada and future party leader of the Reform Party of Ontario, both promised that a successful Ontario party would force the federal government to be run by a coalition of regions. Burns, as interim leader, vowed to have 50 candidates in the next federal election. Harness, as the interim deputy leader and chief party organizer, quickly worked on the principles and policy for the Ontario Party of Canada. A founding workshop was held, a website was developed and the party applied to Elections Canada, the government elections agency, for party status. The party issued two news releases, which resulted in articles in the National Post on September 9, 2002 and September 16, 2002. But in February 2003, Burns wrote an article in The London Free Press newspaper endorsing the Canadian Alliance and promising that the Ontario party would live on, at least in spirit: \\"The Ontario Party of Canada will, for the time being, become an ardent advocate for the best interests of Ontarians and comment on national, provincial and municipal matters. Should the time ever arise when the electorate wants a regional representation in Parliament, we will be there. If this scenario never arises, advocacy and strategic support alliances will be the order of the day.\\" In late 2003, Burns, the would-be defender of Ontario‚Äôs interests in Confederation, had moved to Vancouver, British Columbia, where he became active in the new Conservative Party of Canada. He was quoted as writing: \\"Several months ago we made the decision to fold the party and fully support Stephen Harper and the new and improved Conservative party. We are convinced that it will address Ontario's and every region's concerns.\\" The merger of the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada and the Canadian Alliance in late 2003 undermined the commitment of those who supported the Ontario Party. Elections Canada reported on March 29, 2004 the party lost its eligibility to become registered because it failed to report a change of leader. Harness, as party leader of the provincial Reform Party of Ontario from 2007 to 2014, would use many principles from the federal Ontario Party of Canada within the provincial political party, including sovereignty regionalization.

On July 9, 1816, an assembly met in San Miguel de Tucum√°n, declared full independence with provisions for a national constitution. Background The territory of modern Argentina was part of the Spanish Viceroyalty of the R√≠o de la Plata, with its capital city in Buenos Aires, seat of government of the Spanish viceroy. Modern Uruguay, Paraguay and Bolivia were also part of the viceroyalty, and began their push for autonomy during the conflict, becoming independent states afterwards. The vast area of the territory and slow communications led most populated areas to become isolated from each other. The wealthiest regions of the viceroyalty were in Upper Peru (modern-day Bolivia). Salta and C√≥rdoba had closer ties with Upper Peru than with Buenos Aires. Similarly, Mendoza in the west had closer ties with the Captaincy General of Chile, although the Andes mountain range was a natural barrier. Buenos Aires and Montevideo, who had a local rivalry, located in the La Plata Basin, had naval communications allowing them to be more in contact with European ideas and economic advances than the inland populations. Paraguay was isolated from all other regions. In the political structure most authoritative positions were filled by people designated by the Spanish monarchy, most of them Spanish people from Europe, also known as peninsulares, without strong compromises for American problems or interests. This created a growing rivalry between the Criollos, white people born in Latin America, and the peninsulares, Spanish people who arrived from Europe (the term \\"Criollo\\" is usually translated to English as \\"Creole\\", despite being unrelated to most other Creole peoples). Although they were all considered Spanish, and that there was no legal distinctions between Criollos and Peninsulares, most Criollos thought that Peninsulares had undue influence in political matters. The ideas of the American and French Revolutions, and the Age of Enlightenment, promoted desires of social change among the criollos. The full prohibition imposed by Spain to trade with other nations was also seen as damaging to the viceroyalty's economy. The population of Buenos Aires was highly militarized during the British invasions of the R√≠o de la Plata, part of the Anglo-Spanish War. Buenos Aires was captured in 1806, and then liberated by Santiago de Liniers with forces from Montevideo.Camogli, p. 23 Fearing a counter-attack, all the population of Buenos Aires capable of bearing arms was arranged in military bodies, including slaves. A new British attack in 1807 captured Montevideo, but was defeated in Buenos Aires, and forced to leave the viceroyalty. The viceroy Rafael de Sobremonte was successfully deposed by the criollos during the conflict, and the Regiment of Patricians became a highly influential force in local politics, even after the end of the British threat.Camogli, p. 24 The transfer of the Portuguese Court to Brazil generated military concern. It was feared that the British would launch a third attack, this time allied with Portugal. However, no military conflict took place, as when the Peninsular War started Britain and Portugal became allies of Spain against France. When the Spanish king Ferdinand VII was captured, his sister Carlota Joaquina sought to rule in the Americas as regent, but nothing came out of it because of the lack of support from both the Spanish Americans and the British. Javier de El√≠o created a Junta in Montevideo and Mart√≠n de √Ålzaga sought to make a similar move by organizing a mutiny in Buenos Aires, but the local military forces intervened and thwarted it. Spain appointed a new viceroy, Baltasar Hidalgo de Cisneros, and Liniers handed the government to him without resistance, despite the proposals of the military to reject him.Camogli, pp. 26‚Äì27 =The Revolution= The May Revolution forced the viceroy to resign. He was replaced by a government Junta, the Primera Junta. The military conflict in Spain worsened by 1810. The city of Seville had been invaded by French armies, which were already dominating most of the Iberian Peninsula. The Junta of Seville was disestablished, and several members fled to C√°diz, the last portion of Spain still resisting. They established a Council of Regency, with political tendencies closer to absolutism than the former Junta. This began the May Revolution in Buenos Aires, as soon as the news was known. Several citizens thought that Cisneros, appointed by the disestablished Junta, did not have the right to rule anymore, and requested the convening of an open cabildo to discuss the fate of the local government. The military gave their support to the request, forcing Cisneros to accept. The discussion ruled the removal of viceroy Cisneros and his replacement with a government junta, but the cabildo attempted to keep Cisneros in power by appointing him president of such junta. Further demonstrations ensued, and the Junta was forced to resign immediately. It was replaced by a new one, the Primera Junta.Camogli, pp. 27‚Äì28 Buenos Aires requested the other cities in the viceroyalty to acknowledge the new Junta and send deputies. The precise purpose of these deputies, join the Junta or create a congress, was unclear at the time and generated political disputes later. The Junta was initially resisted by all the main locations around Buenos Aires: C√≥rdoba, Montevideo, Paraguay and the Upper Peru. Santiago de Liniers came out of his retirement in C√≥rdoba and organized an army to capture Buenos Aires, Montevideo had naval supremacy over the city, and Vicente Nieto organized the actions at the Upper Peru. Nieto proposed to Jos√© Fernando de Abascal y Sousa, viceroy of the Viceroyalty of Peru at the North, to annex the Upper Peru to it. He thought that the revolution could be easily contained in Buenos Aires, before launching a definitive attack. Buenos Aires was declared a rogue city by the Council of Regency, which appointed Montevideo as capital of the viceroyalty of the R√≠o de la Plata, and Francisco Javier de El√≠o the new viceroy. However, the May Revolution was not initially separatist. Patriots supported the legitimacy of the Juntas in the Americas, whether royalists supported instead the Council of Regency; both ones acted on behalf of Ferdinand VII. All of them believed that, according to the retroversion of the sovereignty to the people, in the absence of the rightful king sovereignty returned to the people, which would be capable to appoint their own leaders. They did not agree on who was that people, and which territorial extension had the sovereignty. Royalists thought that it applied to the people on European Spain, who had the right to rule over all the Spanish empire. The leaders of the May Revolution thought that it applied to all the capitals of Spanish kingdoms. Jos√© Gervasio Artigas would lead later a third perspective: the retroversion applied to all regions, which should remain united under a confederative system. The three groups battled each others, but the disputes about the national organization of Argentina (either centralist or confederal) continued in Argentine Civil War, for many years after the end of the war of independence.Camogli, pp. 29‚Äì31 Battle of San Nicol√°s. Armed conflict The Primera Junta sent military campaigns to the viceroyalty, in order to secure support to the new authorities and retain the authority held as the capital of the viceroyalty. The victories and defeats of the military conflict delimited the areas of influence of the new United Provinces of the R√≠o de la Plata. With the non-aggression pact arranged with Paraguay early on, most of the initial conflict took place in the north, in Upper Peru, and in the east, in the Banda Oriental. In the second half of the decade, with the capture of Montevideo and the stalemate in Upper Peru, the conflict moved to the west, to Chile.Camogli, pp. 32‚Äì33 =Initial campaigns= The first two military campaigns ordered by the revolutionary Junta in Buenos Aires were launched against Cordoba, where former Viceroy Santiago de Liniers organized a counter- revolution, and the Intendency of Paraguay, which did not recognize the outcome of events at the May Revolution. However, the improvised army gathered by Liniers at Cordoba deserted him before battle, so the former Viceroy attempted to flee to the Upper Peru, expecting to join the royalist army sent from the Viceroyalty of Peru to suffocate the revolution at Buenos Aires. Colonel Francisco Ortiz de Ocampo, who led the patriot army, captured Liniers and the other leaders of the Cordoba counter-revolution on 6 August 1810, but, instead of executing them as he was instructed, he sent them back to Buenos Aires as prisoners. As a result, Ocampo was demoted and Juan Jos√© Castelli was appointed as the political head of the army. On 26 August, Castelli executed the Cordoba prisoners and led the Army of the North towards the Upper Peru. *First Upper Peru campaign (1810‚Äì1811) After securing the loyalty of the northwestern Provinces to the May Revolution through elections of representatives to the Junta in Buenos Aires, Castelli sent General Antonio Gonz√°lez Balcarce into the Upper Peru, but he was defeated at the battle of Cotagaita. Castelli then sent him reinforcements, leading to the first patriotic victory at the battle of Suipacha, which gave Buenos Aires control over the Upper Peru. The royalist generals Vicente Nieto, Francisco de Paula Sanz and Jos√© de C√≥rdoba y Rojas were captured and executed. Castelli then proposed to the Buenos Aires Junta to cross the Desaguadero River, taking the offensive into the Viceroyalty of Peru domains, but his proposal was rejected. His army and Goyeneche's stationed near the frontier, while negotiating. Goyeneche advanced and defeated Castelli at the Battle of Huaqui, whose forces dispersed and left the provinces. The resistance of patriot republiqueta guerrillas of Upper Peru, however, kept the royalists at bay, preventing them from advancing south. *Paraguay campaign (1810‚Äì1811) The other militia sent by Buenos Aires was commanded by Manuel Belgrano and made its way up the Paran√° River towards the Intendency of Paraguay. A first battle was fought at Campichuelo, where the Patriots claimed victory. However, they were completely overwhelmed at the subsequent battles of Paraguar√≠ and Tacuar√≠. Thus, this campaign ended in failure as well from a military point of view; however, some months later, inspired on the Argentine example, Paraguay broke its links with the Spanish crown by declaring itself an independent nation. *First Banda Oriental campaign (1811) Asencio =Renewed offensives= The undesired outcomes of the Paraguay and Upper Peru campaigns led the Junta to be replaced by an executive Triumvirate in September 1811. This new government decided to promote a new campaign to the Upper Peru with a reorganized Army of the North and appointed Jos√© de San Mart√≠n, a veteran of the Napoleonic Wars who had recently arrived from Spain, as lieutenant colonel. San Mart√≠n was ordered to create the professional and disciplined cavalry unit known as Regiment of Mounted Grenadiers (). *Second Upper Peru campaign (1812‚Äì1813) General Manuel Belgrano was appointed as the new commander of the Army of the North. Facing the overwhelming invasion of a royalist army led by General P√≠o de Trist√°n, Belgrano turned to scorched-earth tactics and ordered the evacuation of the people of Jujuy and Salta, and the burning of anything else left behind to prevent enemy forces from getting supplies or taking prisoners from those cities. This action is known as the Jujuy Exodus. Turning against the Triumvirate orders, however, Belgrano decided to fight the royalists at Tucum√°n, obtaining a great victory and then decisively defeating the royalist army at the Battle of Salta, in northwestern Argentina, forcing the bulk of the royalist army to surrender their weapons. Trist√°n (a former fellow student with Belgrano at Salamanca University) and his men were granted amnesty and released. Then again, the patriot army was defeated into the Upper Peru at the battles of Vilcapugio and Ayohuma and retreated to Jujuy. *Second Banda Oriental campaign (1812‚Äì1814) In early 1812, the truce between Buenos Aires and Montevideo was over, and Manuel de Sarratea led an army to the Banda Oriental, but he was soon replaced by Jos√© Rondeau, who initiated a second siege of Montevideo. Although royalist Gaspar de Vigodet sought to break the siege, he was defeated at the Battle of Cerrito. The Spanish navy then sought to evade the land blockade by raiding nearby populations on the west bank of the Uruguay river. On 31 January 1813, Spanish troops from Montevideo landed near the town of San Lorenzo, Santa Fe Province, but it was absolutely defeated by the Granaderos unit led by San Mart√≠n on February 3. The Battle of San Lorenzo ended further Spanish raids on the west bank of the Paran√° river and the Triumvirate awarded San Mart√≠n the rank of general. The Granaderos unit was instrumental in the Revolution of October 8, 1812 which deposed the government and installed a new Triumvirate, considered to be more committed to the cause of Independence. In fact, this second Triumvirate convened a national assembly which was meant to declare Independence. The Assembly, however, first decided replace the Triumvirate with a new unipersonal Executive office, the Supreme Director of the United Provinces of the R√≠o de la Plata, and elected Gervasio Antonio de Posadas for that role. One of the first actions of Posadas was to create a naval fleet from scratch, which was to be financed by Juan Larrea, and appointed William Brown as lieutenant colonel and chief commander of it, on March 1, 1814. Against all the odds, on 14 May 1814 the improvised patriot navy engaged the Spanish fleet and defeated it three days later. This action secured the port of Buenos Aires and allowed the fall of Montevideo, which could not stand the siege any more, on 20 June 1814. =The march towards Independence= The fall of Montevideo eliminated the royalist menace from the Banda Oriental and meant the actual end of the Spanish Viceroyalty of the R√≠o de la Plata. Soon afterwards, William Brown was awarded the rank of admiral, and Carlos Mar√≠a de Alvear, who was put in charge of the siege of Montevideo just a few days before the surrender of the city, succeeded his uncle Gervasio Posadas as the Supreme Director of the United Provinces, on January 11, 1815. Alvear, however, was resisted by the troops, so he was quickly replaced, on April 21, by Ignacio √Ålvarez Thomas through a mutiny. √Ålvarez Thomas then appointed Alvear as general of the Northern Army, in replacement of Jos√© Rondeau, but the officiality did not recognize this and remained loyal to Rondeau. *Third Alto Per√∫ campaign (1815) :In 1815, the Northern Army, unofficially commanded by Jos√© Rondeau, started another offensive campaign in the Upper Per√∫, without the formal authorization of Supreme Director √Ålvarez Thomas. Lacking official support, however, the army was faced with anarchy. Moreover, soon after it would lose as well the aid of the Provincial Army of Salta, commanded by Mart√≠n Miguel de G√ºemes. After the defeats of Venta y Media (October 21) and Sipe-Sipe (November 28), the northern territories of the Upper Peru were effectively lost to the United Provinces. However, the Spanish Army could not advance further south as they were successfully stopped at Salta by the G√ºemes guerrillas from then on. The unsuccessful outcome of the third Upper Peru campaign would spread rumors in Europe that the May Revolution was over. Furthermore, King Ferdinand VII was restored to the Spanish throne on 1815, so an urgent decision was needed regarding the political status of the United Provinces. On July 9, 1816, an assembly of representatives of the Provinces (including three Upper Peru departments but excluding representatives from Santa Fe, Entre R√≠os, Corrientes and the Banda Oriental, united into the Federal League) met at the Congress of Tucum√°n and declared the Independence of the United Provinces in South America from the Spanish Crown, with provisions for a national Constitution. =Army of the Andes (1814‚Äì1818)= San Mart√≠n wrapped in the flag. In 1814, General Jos√© de San Mart√≠n had taken command of the Army of the North to prepare a new invasion of the Upper Peru. However, he quickly resigned as he foresaw yet another defeat. Instead, he developed a new strategy to attack the Viceroyalty of Per√∫ through the Captaincy of Chile, inspired on the writings of Sir Thomas Maitland, who was quoted as saying that the only way to defeat the Spanish at Quito and Lima was attacking Chile first. San Mart√≠n asked to become the Governor of the Province of Cuyo, where he prepared the Chile campaign. Installed in the city of Mendoza, San Mart√≠n reorganized the Granaderos cavalry unit into the Army of the Andes, which he created out of patriots from both the United Provinces and exiles from Chile. In early 1817, San Mart√≠n led the crossing of the Andes into Chile, obtaining a decisive victory at the battle of Chacabuco on February 17, 1817, and took Santiago de Chile, where he refused the offer of the governorship of Chile in favour of Bernardo O'Higgins (who became supreme director) because he did not wish to be diverted from his main objective, the capture of Lima. O'Higgins installed a new independent government. In December 1817, a popular referendum was set up to decide about the Independence of Chile. However, a Royalist resistance stood still in southern Chile, allied with the Mapuches. On April 4, Argentine Colonel Juan Gregorio de Las Heras had occupied Concepci√≥n, but the Royalists retreated to Talcahuano. In early 1818, Royalist reinforcements from the Viceroyalty of Peru arrived, commanded by general Mariano Osorio, and advanced towards the capital. San Mart√≠n then turned to scorched earth tactics and ordered the evacuation of Concepci√≥n, which he thought was impossible to defend. On 18 February 1818, the first anniversary of the battle of Chacabuco, Chile declared its independence from the Spanish Crown. On March 18, 1818, Osorio led a surprise attack on the joint Argentine-Chilean army, which had to retreat to Santiago, with heavy losses. In fact, among the confusion, Supreme Director O'Higgins was thought to be killed, and panic seized the patriot camp. Crippled after his defeat at Cancha Rayada, O'Higgins delegated the command of the troops entirely to San Mart√≠n in a meeting on the plains of Maip√∫. Then, on April 5, 1818, San Mart√≠n inflicted a decisive defeat on Osorio in the Battle of Maip√∫, after which the depleted royalists retreated to Concepcion, never again to launch a major offensive against Santiago. The Chile campaign is generally considered to be the conclusion of the Argentine War of Independence, as the further actions of the United Army into Peru were carried on under the authority of the Chilean government, not the United Provinces. However, defensive actions continued to be carried on in the northern frontier of the United Provinces until the 1825 Battle of Ayacucho, which ended the royalist threat from the Upper Peru. Annual commemoration The D√≠a de la Revoluci√≥n de Mayo (May Revolution Day) on May 25 is an annual holiday in Argentina to commemorate the First National Government (and the creation of the Primera Junta), one of the significant events in the history of Argentina. These and other events of the week leading to this day are referred to as the Semana de Mayo (May Week).

The game is set in a medieval milieu, and controlled via a point and click interface, with the primary goal on each map being to build a settlement with a functioning economy, producing sufficient military units so as to conquer rival territories, ultimately gaining control of the entire map. To achieve this end, the player must engage in economic micromanagement, construct buildings, and generate resources. The game can be played in one of two modes; a series of fifty sequential missions against computer controlled opponents of increasing difficulty, or a free-game style mode, in which the player competes in individual games involving either computer-controlled opponents, human opponents, or a combination of both. Originally envisioned as a standard god game, similar to Populous, the concept of The Settlers was altered by the game's designer and programmer, Volker Wertich, after development had already begun. Wanting to create something unlike other titles available at the time, Wertich decided to focus on creating a game which could simulate a complex economic system, and which would feature gameplay built around a simulation of real-world supply and demand. However, due to the complexities of writing a codebase which understood and could realistically duplicate such a system, as well as ensuring the computer could handle military and economic matters simultaneously, the game required over two years of development. Wertich worked on the programming for a year, writing 70,000 lines of raw code, before any work began on the graphics. The game received positive reviews, especially on the Amiga, where it was more widely reviewed than on MS-DOS. Critics especially praised the complexity of the economic system and the interrelatedness of the various buildings, as well as the graphics and sound effects. While some saw it as a god game, comparing it favourably to Populous, others saw it as a city-building game, comparing it favourably to SimCity. Others, however, felt it defined a new genre altogether by blending elements of god games and city-building games. It is often cited as one of the best Amiga games ever made. It was also a commercial success, selling over 400,000 units worldwide across both systems, considerably more than Blue Byte had anticipated. It went on to form the basis for The Settlers series, one of Blue Byte's most successful franchises. Gameplay The Settlers is a city- building game with real-time strategy elements, controlled via a point and click interface, in which the primary goal on each map is to build a settlement with a functioning economy, producing sufficient military units so as to conquer rival territories, ultimately gaining control of the entire map. To achieve this end, the player must engage in economic micromanagement, construct buildings, and generate resources. =Game modes= The game can be played in one of two modes. The first is a series of thirty sequential missions where the player, either alone, or teaming with a second player, competes against computer controlled opponents of increasing difficulty. The second is a free-game style mode, played on either a randomly generated map, or a pre-built map, based on data input by the player prior to commencing. The player can then refine the game by selecting the number of races (from two to four), choosing which commander should lead each race (there are ten different commanders, ranging from peaceful and placid to warlike and aggressive), refining the amount of raw materials available to each player at the start of the game, setting the intelligence of the settlers and knights in each race's service, and determining the rate at which each race's settlers produce items. Games involving two human players are played in split screen, with the second player using a mouse on the same PC. Two-player mode allows two players to either team up together to compete against one or two computer opponents, or compete against one another and up to two additional computer opponents. =Settlers and transportation = Whether playing a mission or a free-game, each game begins the same way; the player is presented with part of the map, usually a green area on which it is easy to build, and must construct their castle/headquarters so as to begin their settlement. The basic gameplay revolves around serfs (the titular \\"settlers\\") who transport materials, tools and produce, and who populate and perform the requisite task of each building. As the player constructs buildings and thus requires settlers to occupy them, the settlers automatically emerge from the castle as needed. As the settlement continues to grow in size, the castle's quota of settlers will eventually be reached, and the player will need to build a warehouse to generate more settlers. At no point does the player directly control any individual settler - instead, general orders are issued (such as ordering the construction of a building), with the AI handling the delegation of orders to specific settlers. HUD shows part of the player's settlement, with the various buildings linked by roads. The roads are demarcated by waypoints (turquoise flags), which function as hubs for the distribution of goods, with a single settler operating between each flag. An important game mechanic is the construction of a road network so as to allow for an efficient transportation system, as any settlers transporting goods must use roads. To build a road, the player must place a flag, and then manually build the road using a series of on- screen prompts advising as to the best direction in which to build. To maximize distribution, the player must set as many flags as possible on each road. Flags can only be set a certain distance apart, and serve as transport hubs; a settler will carry an item to a flag and set it down, at which point the next settler along will pick up the item and continue, freeing the first settler to return and pick up another item at the previous flag. The more flags the player has, the more settlers will operate on a given road, cutting down the distance each settler must travel, and reducing the time to transport one item and return for the next, thus avoiding item congestion at each flag. When more than one item is placed at a flag, the game has an adjustable goods priority system, which determines the order in which items are transported. Waterways can also be constructed over small bodies of water in the same manner as roads, although the settlers need boats to cross. =Economy= The economy is under the player's control throughout the game, and is adjustable in multiple ways. For example, the player can control the distribution of goods by selecting how much of a given resource is transported to a given building, under five separate headings; food, wood, iron, coal and wheat. In a similar manner, the player can select what tools are made when; by increasing the significance of a particular tool, that tool will be produced before others. Tool production is important insofar as all buildings require raw materials and a worker with the right tool. For example, if the player has built a blacksmith, and the building is still empty despite idle settlers in the headquarters, a pliers will need to be manufactured in the toolsmith. =Military= The player's territory can only be expanded by building a military complex near the territory border. Each complex must have at least one knight garrisoned for the territory to expand. Knights are automatically created from the pool of existing settlers in the headquarters, with each individual soldier requiring a sword and shield. Once knights are garrisoned, gold coins can be transported to the building to increase their morale, which allows them to fight more aggressively. They can also be promoted through five ranks, receiving training in the castle, or when stationed in a building, although they rank up slower when stationed. The player also has control over the structure of their military; and is free to change the number of settlers who become knights, the rank of first-line defence knights, how many knights from each building can be used offensively, how many knights counter the enemy if nearby buildings are attacked, and how many knights take up positions in buildings not visible to the enemy, buildings visible but not immediately under threat, buildings under threat, and buildings about to be attacked. The player can also order lower ranked knights to leave military buildings and return to the castle, replacing them with higher ranked knights. In order for the player to attack an enemy building, they must click on that building, and select the number of units they wish to use to carry out the attack. If the player's units defeat all soldiers stationed in the building, they will occupy it, with the player's territory increasing according to the building's radius. Defense of the player's military buildings is automatic; as enemies attack, any knights stationed in the building defend. Development Volker Wertich, the game's designer and programmer, was initially inspired to create The Settlers by titles such as Little Computer People, Populous and SimCity. Originally, he intended the game to be similar to existing god games, with early development working to that end. However, wanting to create something different, Wertich scrapped his initial concept and decided to focus on creating a game which could simulate a complex economic system, and which would feature gameplay built around a simulation of real-world supply and demand. To this end, the major innovation he introduced in The Settlers was how the game handled raw materials. In most other titles, raw materials were made available without the player having to do much in the way of producing them. In The Settlers, however, the player would be responsible for the raw materials upon which the economic system was built, by way of constructing and maintaining each link in the chain-of-production. For example, to create weapons, the player would need iron ore and coal, which could only be mined. However, for miners to be willing to work, they had to be fed, meaning the player would have to produce bread. This could only be done if the player had built a grain farm to grow crops, which would be converted into flour, and a well, which would produce water to be mixed with the flour to make bread. According to producer Thomas Hertzler, the main driving force behind much of the development was \\"to create an economy simulation without it being boring.\\" Designing a game which could simulate such a system, however, proved far from simple, with the game requiring two years development and programming, with much of this time \\"spent teaching the computer the basic facets of running an economic system.\\" The game's project manager Stefan Piasecki further explains the reason for the lengthy development cycle was \\"due mainly to [the] enormous amount of data that had to be inputted. The Settlers isn't like most games where the player has just one or two characters to guide through the game. The Settlers world is a unique place with all the elements of the real world.\\" Wertich worked on the programming of the game for a year, writing 70,000 lines of raw code, before any work began on the graphics. His biggest challenge was getting the computer to understand and accurately simulate supply and demand, which, once the necessary buildings have been constructed, is handled almost entirely outside the privy of the player. Piasecki explains, \\"if there's a windmill next to a farmer, the program has to check whether that miller has the capacity to grind his corn. If not, the corn must be taken to another mill. But what if the street is crowded? The computer then has to work out the best route for the farmer to take his goods.\\" He further states, The amount of possible on-screen action in the game depended on which model Amiga the player used, with the upper limit of settlers different on different machines. An Amiga 500 was capable of supporting up to roughly 8,000 settlers, whilst an Amiga 1200 could support up to roughly 16,000, and, with additional RAM, up to roughly 64,000. More precisely, because the game works on a 16-bit integer, the maximum number of settlers possible is 65,536. However, as any map capable of generating so many settlers must contain four races, the most settlers one player can ever control at any one time is 16,384. Additionally, the game features twenty-five different roles that a settler can occupy, with each role resulting in a settler who looks different and is animated differently from settlers in the other twenty-four roles. However, each individual settler's head is only 5x5 pixels, the space available for artist Christoph Werner to create twenty-five different looks. Furthermore, when the player zooms in, workers can be seen at work inside buildings, and sound effects change depending on where in the settlement the player is currently situated. All of this variety and variation added to the complexity when programming the game. The game's numbers are also important in open-game mode, where the player can create the world by inputting a 16-digit code, with each digit ranging from 0 to 9, allowing for roughly 270 billion combinations, hence 270 billion slightly different maps. The game also presented programming problems when being ported to MS-DOS by Blue Byte and Massive Development. Thomas H√§user, who did quality assurance work on the game, and was promoted to project manager for The Settlers II, explains \\"the Amiga source code was completely undocumented. To implement it, we used a team that had written a compiler for the assembly code. With that, the Amiga source was compiled to a PC assembly code and assembled afterwards. This was, of course, very complex and prone to errors.\\" The only significant graphical difference between the Amiga version and the MS-DOS version was that whilst the Amiga version used Amiga Halfbrite mode, the DOS version was limited to 8-bit color. Reception The Settlers received positive reviews upon its release, especially on Amiga, where it was more widely reviewed than on MS-DOS. Amiga User International scored the game 97%, calling it \\"a true masterpiece\\" and \\"an awesome piece of programming that could only have been achieved by creative talent of the highest order.\\" They compared it favourably to Populous, and praised it as the best god game ever made, writing \\"The Settlers has broken new programming ground and will be the benchmark in years to come for any up and coming software writer.\\" They especially lauded the interrelatedness of the various buildings, and the complexity of the economic system. Amiga Formats Rob Mead rated it 94%, giving it an \\"Amiga Format Gold\\" award, and calling it \\"a major contender for the game of the year.\\" He too praised the economic system and the connections between the buildings, saying \\"the game oozes quality.\\" He also cited the graphics and sound effects as especially noteworthy. Amiga Computings Simon Clays scored it 93%, giving it a \\"Gamer Gold\\" award, and writing, \\"it contains some of the most intelligent interactions between player and characters yet to be seen on an Amiga.\\" He too lauded the economic system, the connections between the buildings, the graphics and the sound effects, and he too found the game superior to Populous, writing \\"with so many of this type of title knocking around, it really is refreshing to see a product that is fresh and entertaining.\\" CU Amigas Tony Dillon scored it 90%, giving it an \\"Amiga Screen Star\\" award. He argued it was neither a god game nor a city-building game, but was instead a new type of game which combined ideas from other genres in a way never before seen. He particularly praised the variety of gameplay, arguing \\"there are so many variations on the basic game, that you will wonder if you could ever play the same game twice.\\" He also lauded the \\"intelligent sounds, and graphics that actually mean something.\\" The Ones Simon Byron scored it 90%, writing, \\"it's definitely a game you fall in love with instantly.\\" His only criticism was the steep learning curve, arguing that on-screen labelling of the different buildings would have helped ease the player in. Amiga Powers Mark Winstanley scored it 88%, comparing it favourably to Populous, A-Train and SimCity, and writing \\"The Settlers is like lots of things, but still manages to be a unique game, which is truly a rare and satisfying thing to see these days.\\" He praised the interface's use of charts and graphs, and the attention to graphical detail. He concluded by calling it \\"witty, imaginative and detailed, right down to the last leaf and fishing rod. It's as complex or as simple as you want it to be and thoroughly absorbing.\\" Computer Gaming Worlds Robert L. Hayes, Jr. scored the MS-DOS version 4.5 out of 5, praising the complexity of the game's economic system and the interconnectedness of the buildings, and calling it \\"possibly the most realistic medieval economic model ever built into a computer system.\\" He was also impressed with the interface, graphics, and animations. However, he called combat \\"dull and predictable,\\" criticising the limited control players have. PC Players J√∂rg Langer scored it 83%, finding it slightly inferior to Populous II. Although he praised the economic system, the interrelatedness of the buildings, the graphics, and the interface, he was critical of both VGA and SVGA modes, arguing that VGA mode didn't give a wide enough view, and in SVGA mode, the menus and icons were too small. He also criticised combat as \\"impossible to influence.\\" PC Games Petra Mauer√∂der scored it 82%, writing, \\"I expected a lot more.\\" Although she praised the graphics and sound effects, she was critical of the game's repetitiveness, writing \\"after only a few days, the motivation drops significantly because the tasks become routine.\\" She also criticised the pace of the game, arguing that for much of the playing time, the player is \\"reduced to a passive observer.\\" She ultimately found the game inferior to SimCity 2000. PC Gamers T. Liam McDonald scored it 75%, arguing, \\"it's fun and modestly challenging, but it could have been better.\\" Criticisms included a lack of humour, a confusing interface, an inability to influence combat, and a lack of gameplay depth. He concluded, \\"it stands as a lightweight, if entertaining game.\\" =Sales= The game was a commercial success. By June 1996, it had sold over 215,000 units worldwide across both systems, well beyond Blue Byte's expectations. By May 1998, it had sold over 400,000 units. Legacy The game has been cited as one of the best Amiga games ever made. In Amiga Jokers 1994 Reader's Choice Awards, it won both \\"Best Game\\" and \\"Best Strategic Game\\". In 1996, Amiga Power ranked it at #25 in their \\"Amiga Top 100\\". In 2010, the Polish edition of CHIP ranked it at #1 in their \\"Top Ten Amiga Games\\". In 2011, Wirtualna Polska ranked it at #16 in their \\"30 best games for the Amiga\\". The game formed the basis for The Settlers series, leading to ten further titles, and becoming one of Blue Byte's best selling franchises. Upon the success of the first game, Blue Byte began work immediately on a sequel, seeking out feedback from fans, and working to address anything they disliked or felt could be improved upon. Subsequent games in the series have been released on MS-DOS, Microsoft Windows, MacOS, Nintendo DS, iOS, webOS, bada, Symbian, Android, and online. Outside the official series, The Settlers has given rise to two free, open source games released under the GNU General Public License. Widelands, written in C++ and built on the SDL libraries, is an ongoing project begun in 2001. Inspired by and based upon The Settlers and, to a larger extent, The Settlers II, Widelands is itself a new game with its own storyline, races, buildings, graphics and gameplay. In a 2009 review of Build13 for Linux Journal, John Knight wrote, \\"Widelands is a breath of fresh air in an extremely stale genre, whose roots ironically stem from way back in the past in RTS history. Whether you're chasing a fix of that original Settlers feel or just want a different direction in RTS, this game is well worth a look. Freeserf, developed by Jon Lund Steffensen and made available at GitHub, is an attempt to reimplement the Settlers game mechanics in C++. Begun in 2010, Freeserf still requires the original game files to work. In August 2018, Ubisoft re-released the original game as The Settlers: History Edition, optimised for Windows 10, and featuring adjustable game speed, adjustable resolution, options for mouse, keyboard, and controller inputs, key mapping for keyboard and controller inputs, and different device support for split-screen, allowing any combination of mouse, keyboard, and controller inputs (i.e., one player can use a mouse and the other can use a controller). In November, the game was also included in The Settlers: History Collection, with the same features and Windows 10 optimisation as the stand-alone August release. Available only on Uplay, the History Collection also includes re-releases of The Settlers II, The Settlers III, The Settlers IV, The Settlers: Heritage of Kings, The Settlers: Rise of an Empire, and The Settlers 7: Paths to a Kingdom.

Michael Khodarkovsky, Bitter Choices: Loyalty and Betrayal in the Russian Conquest of the North Caucasus (2011). Opening hostilities At the start of hostilities the Russian army of 100,000 men was commanded by Emperor Nicholas I, while the Ottoman forces were commanded by Hussein Pasha. In April and May 1828 the Russian commander-in-chief, Prince Peter Wittgenstein, moved into Romanian Principates Wallachia and Moldavia. In June 1828, the main Russian forces under the emperor crossed the Danube and advanced into Dobruja. Action of 26 May 1829, by Nikolay Krasovsky. The Russians then laid prolonged sieges to three key Ottoman citadels in modern Bulgaria: Shumla, Varna, and Silistra.A Global Chronology of Conflict: From the Ancient World to the Modern Middle East, Vol.III, ed. Spencer C. Tucker, (ABC-CLIO, 2010), 1152. With the support of the Black Sea Fleet under Aleksey Greig, Varna was captured on 29 September. The siege of Shumla proved much more problematic, as the 40,000-strong Ottoman garrison outnumbered the Russian forces. As the latter were harassed by Turkish troops and ill- equipped, many of its soldiers died of disease or exhaustion. Russia then had to withdraw to Moldavia with heavy losses without having captured Shumla and Silistra.Metternich and Austria: An Evaluation, Alan Sked Changing fortunes As winter approached, the Russian army was forced to leave Shumla and retreat back to Bessarabia. In February 1829 the cautious Wittgenstein was replaced by the more energetic Hans Karl von Diebitsch, and the Tsar left the army for St Petersburg. On 7 May, 60,000 soldiers led by Field Marshal Diebitsch crossed the Danube and resumed the siege of Silistra. The Sultan sent a 40,000-strong contingent to the relief of Varna, which was defeated at the Battle of Kulevicha on 30 May. Three weeks later on 19 June, Silistra fell to the Russians. Siege of Kars (1828), by January Suchodolski. Meanwhile, Ivan Paskevich advanced on the Caucasian front defeated the Turks at the Battle of Akhalzic and captured Kars on 23 June and Erzurum, in north-eastern Anatolia on 27 June, the 120th anniversary of the Poltava. On 2 July Diebitsch launched the Transbalkan offensive, the first in Russian history since the 10th-century campaigns of Svyatoslav I. The contingent of 35,000 Russians moved across the mountains, circumventing the besieged Shumla on their way to Constantinople. The Russians captured Burgas ten days later, and the Turkish reinforcement was routed near Sliven on 31 July. By 22 August, the Russians had taken Adrianople,Stanford J. Shaw, Ezel Kural Shaw, History of the Ottoman Empire and Modern Turkey:Reform, Revolution, Republic, Volume 2, (Cambridge University Press, 1977), 31. reportedly causing the Muslim population in the city to leave.Edirne, M. Tayyib Gokbilgin, The Encyclopaedia of Islam, Vol. II, ed. B. Lewis, C. Pellat and J. Schacht, (Brill, 1991), 684. The Ottoman palace in Adrianople, Saray-i Djedid-i Amare, was heavily damaged by Russian troops. Caucasus front Although the main fighting was in the west there was significant action on the Caucasus front. Paskevich's main aims were to tie down as many Turkish troops as possible, to capture the Turkish forts on the Black Sea coast that supported the Circassians and might be used to land troops, and to push the border west to some desirable point. Most of the Turkish side was held by the semi-independent Pasha of Akhaltsikhe and Muslim Georgian Beys who ruled the hills. Kars on an upland plain blocked the road from Akhaltsikhe to Erzerum, the main city in eastern Turkey. The Russo- Persian War (1826‚Äì28) had just ended, which removed a major danger. Since two- thirds of his troops were tied down holding the Caucasus and watching the Persians, he had only 15.000 men to fight the Turks. The Turks delayed attacking so he had time to move troops and supplies west, concentrating at Gyumri on the border. 1828, June: Kars: On 14 JuneAll dates Old Style so add 12 days for the modern calendar he set out for Kars 40 miles southwest which was held by 11.000 men and 151 guns. The capture of Kars was almost an accident. During a skirmish in the suburbs a company of riflemen under Lieutenant Labintsev made an unauthorized advance. Seeing their danger other companies rushed to the rescue. Their danger drew in more soldiers until most of the Russian force was massed at one point. The wall was breached and soon the Turks held only the citadel. At 10AM 23 June the citadel surrendered. The Turks lost 2.000 killed and wounded, 1350 prisoners and 151 guns, but much of the garrison managed to escape. The Russians lost 400 killed and wounded. Kios PashaAllen-Muratoff call him K√∂se Mehmet. K√∂se means beardless so he may have been a eunuch. of Erzerum was within an hour's march of Kars, but when he heard the news he withdrew to Ardahan. 1828, July: Akhalkalaki: Paskevich feinted toward Erzerum and then marched north to Akhalkalaki. Under bombardment, the 1000-man garrison became demoralized and half of them tried to escape by letting themselves down the walls on ropes, but most were killed. The Russians used the same ropes to scale the walls and the remaining 300 men surrendered (24 July). 1828, August: Akhaltsikhe: Forty miles west was Akhaltsikhe with 10.000 men under its semi-independent Pasha. It guarded the Borjomi Gorge which led northeast to Georgia. Instead of taking the main road which went southwest to Ardahan and then north, Paskevich and 8000 men marched three days through roadless country and reached Akhaltsikhe on 3 August. The next day Kios Pasha and 30.000 men encamped four miles from the fort. Paskevich, outnumbered by an enemy on two sides, turned on Kios. After a day- long battle Kios, wounded, and 5.000 infantry fled to the fort and the remaining Turks scattered south to Ardahan. The Russians took enormous booty and lost 531 men, including a general. The siege now began. Akhaltsikhe had three lines of defense: the fortress, the citadel within and the town without. The town, with its crooked streets, ravines and bastions was almost a fortress itself. The attack began at 4PM, the citizens defended themselves as best they could and by nightfall the town was on fire. In one mosque 400 people burned to death. By dawn of the 16th the ruined town was in Russian hands. They moved artillery up to bear on the fortress walls. On 17 August Kios Pasha surrendered on the condition that he and 4000 men be allowed to withdraw with their arms and property. The Russians lost about 600 men and the Turks 6000. The next day they took the Atskhur castle which controlled the Borjomi Gorge leading from Akhaltsikhe northeast to Georgia. On 22 August the occupied Ardahan, the road junction connecting Akhaltsikhe-Akhalkalaki to the Kars- Erzerum road. Seeing no further opportunities the Russians retired to winter quarters. On the Black Sea coast Anapa was captured on 12 June and Poti on 15 June. By September Chavchadvadze had occupied the Pashalik of Bayazid with little opposition. \\"And the banners of your majesty float over the headwaters of the Euphrates\\". On the last day of September the Russians occupied Guria. 1829: Kios Pasha was replaced by Salih Pasha with Haghki (Hakki) Pasha as his deputy. In winter Paskevich went to St Petersburg with a plan for a massive invasion of Anatolia, but this was rejected. 20000 raw recruits would be sent to the Caucasus, but they would not be ready until late summer. On 30 January the Russian ambassadors to Tehran, including Alexander Griboyedov were killed by a mob. Both sides were too wise to start another war but the possibility tied up part of the Russian army. On 21 February Akhmet Beg (Ahmet Bey) of Hulo and 15000 Lazes and Adjars occupied the town of Akhaltsikhe, slaughtered the Armenian part of the population, and besieged the fortress. Twelve days later Burtsev forced the Borjomi Gorge and the Adjars fled with their loot. General Hesse drove back a Turkish advance from Batum and captured the Turkish camp of Limani south of Poti. Far to the southeast, Bayazid was besieged by the Pasha of Van. The main Turkish advance began in mid-May. Kiaghi Bek approached Ardahan, but was driven north to Adjaria where he threatened Akhaltsikhe. He was defeated at Digur south of Akhaltsikhe and the Russians went south to join Paskevich at Kars. 1829, June: Saganlug and Erzerum: On 13 June Paskevich (12340 infantry, 5785 cavalry and 70 guns) left Kars for Erzerum. The Turks had 50000 men including 30000 nizams (new-model infantry). They stood between Hasankale and Zivin on the Erzerum-Kars road. Further east on the road an advanced force (20000 under Haghki Pasha) held the Millidiuz (Meliduz) Pass over the SaganlugAllen-Muratoff have Soƒüanli-daƒü (former) and Pasinler-sira-daƒü(current) mountain. Paskevich chose to take the inferior road to the north, place himself near Zevin between the two armies and attack Haghki Pasha from the rear. There were complex maneuvers and small actions. At 7 PM on the 19th Paskevich attacked and completely defeated the western army. Next day he turned east and captured Haghki Pasha and 19 guns, but most of his men managed to scatter. With the armies out of the way he set out for Erzerum. On 27 June the city, which had not seen Christian soldiers within its walls for five centuries, surrendered. 1829: After Erzerum: From Erzerum the main road led northwest through Bayburt and Hart to Trebizond on the coast, a very formidable place that could only be taken with the fleet which was now busy on the Bulgarian coast. In July Burtsev went up this road and was killed at Hart. To retrieve Russia's reputation Paskevich destroyed Hart (28 July). He sent an army somewhere west and brought it back, went up the Trebizond road, saw that nothing could be accomplished in that direction, and returned to Erzerum. Hesse and Osten-Sacken pushed north toward Batum and returned. The Pasha of Trebizond moved against Bayburt and was defeated on 28 September, the last action of the war. The Treaty of Adrianople (1829) was signed on 2 September 1829, but it took a month for the news to reach Paskevich. In October his army began marching home. Russia kept the ports of Anapa and Poti, the border forts of Atskhur, Akhalkalaki and Akhaltsikhe fort, but returned Ardahan and the Pashaliks of Kars, Bayazid and most of Akhaltsikhe Pashalik. In 1855 and 1877 Paskevich's work had to be done all over again. One consequence of the war the migration of 90000 Armenians from Turkish to Russian territory. The Treaty of Adrianople Territorial changes after the Treaty of Adrianople Faced with these several defeats, the Sultan decided to sue for peace. The Treaty of Adrianople on 14 September 1829 gave Russia most of the eastern shore of the Black Sea and the mouth of the Danube. Turkey recognized Russian sovereignty over parts of northwest present-day Armenia. Serbia achieved autonomy and Russia was allowed to occupy Moldavia and Wallachia (guaranteeing their prosperity and full \\"liberty of trade\\") until Turkey had paid a large indemnity. Moldavia and Wallachia remained Russian protectorates until the Crimean War. The Straits Question was settled four years later, when both powers signed the Treaty of H√ºnk√¢r ƒ∞skelesi. Regarding the Greek case, with the treaty of Andrianople, the Ottoman Sultan recognized finally the autonomy or independence of the Greeks. Much later, Karl Marx in an article in New York Tribune (21 April 1853), wrote: \\"Who solved finally the Greek case? It was neither the rebellion of Ali Pasha, neither the battle in Navarino, neither the French Army in Peloponnese, neither the conferences and protocols of London; but it was Diebitsch, who invaded through the Balkans to Evros.\\"ŒúŒ¨œÅŒæ Œ≥ŒπŒ± Œ°œâœÉŒøœÑŒøœÖœÅŒ∫ŒπŒ∫œå See also * Russo-Persian War (1826‚Äì28) * Greek War of Independence Sources and further reading * Bitis, Alexander. \\"The 1828‚Äì1829 Russo-Turkish war and the resettlement of Balkan peoples into Novorossiia.\\" Jahrb√ºcher F√ºr Geschichte Osteuropas (2005): 506-525 online in English *William Edward David Allen and Muratoff, Paul, Caucasian Battlefields, 1953,2010, Chapter II * Michael Khodarkovsky.

It was originally best known by its full name, but soon came to have other names, such as the American Revised Version, the American Standard Revision, the American Standard Revised Bible, and the American Standard Edition. By the time its copyright was renewed in 1929, it had come to be known by its present name, the American Standard Version. Because of its prominence in seminaries, it was sometimes simply called the \\"Standard Bible\\" in the United States.  History  Title page to the ASV The American Standard Version, which was also known as The American Revision of 1901, is rooted in the work begun in 1870 to revise the King James Bible of 1611. This revision project eventually produced the Revised Version (RV). An invitation was extended to American religious leaders for scholars to work on the RV project. In 1871, thirty scholars were chosen by Philip Schaff. The denominations represented on the American committee were the Baptist, Congregationalist, Dutch Reformed, Friends, Methodist, Episcopal, Presbyterian, Protestant Episcopal, and Unitarian. These scholars began work in 1872. Three of the editors, the youngest in years, became the editors of the American Standard Revised New Testament: Drs. Dwight, Thayer and Matthew Riddle. Any suggestion of the American Revision Committee would only be accepted if two-thirds of the British Revisers agreed. This principle was backed up by an agreement that if their suggestions were put into the appendix of the RV, the American Committee would not publish their version for 15 years. The appendix had about three hundred suggestions in it. The Revised Version New Testament was published in 1881, the Old Testament in 1885, and the Apocrypha in 1894. Around this time, the British team disbanded. Also around this time, unauthorized copied editions of the RV appeared with the suggestions of the American team in the main text. This was possible because while the RV in the UK was the subject of a Crown copyright as a product of the University Presses of Oxford and Cambridge, this protection did not extend to the U.S. and the text was never separately copyrighted there. In 1898, publishers for Oxford and Cambridge Universities published their own editions of the RV with the American suggestions included. However, these suggestions were reduced in number (but it did incorporate all of those suggestions which were listed in the Appendixes, as can be verified by comparing the Appendixes with the main text of the 1898 edition). Some of those Americanized editions by Oxford and Cambridge Universities had the title of \\"American Revised Version\\" on the cover of their spines. Some of Thomas Nelson's editions of the American Standard Version Holy Bible included the Apocrypha of the Revised Version. The Revised Version of 1885 and the American Standard Version of 1901 are among the Bible versions authorized to be used in services of the Episcopal Church and the Church of England... In 1901, after the 15-year deferral agreement between the American and British Revisers expired, and the Revised Version, Standard American Edition, as the ASV Bible was officially called at the time, was published by Thomas Nelson & Sons. It was copyrighted in North America to ensure the purity of the ASV text. In 1928, the International Council of Religious Education (the body that later merged with the Federal Council of Churches to form the National Council of Churches) acquired the copyright from Nelson and renewed it the following year. The copyright was a reaction to tampering with the text of the Revised Version by some U.S. publishers, as noted above. By the time the ASV's copyright expired for the final time in 1957, interest in this translation had largely waned in the light of newer and more recent ones, and textual corruption hence never became the issue with the ASV that it had with the RV. Because the language of the ASV intentionally retained the King James Version's Elizabethan English, was printed with comparatively lower quality materials, and because of what some perceived to be its excessive literalism, it never achieved wide popularity, and the King James Version would remain the primary translation for most American Protestant Christians until the publication of the Revised Standard Version in 1952.  Rationale  There were two rationales for the ASV. One reason was to obviate any justification for the unauthorized copied editions of the RV that had been circulating. Another reason was to use more of the suggestions the American team had preferred, since the British team used few of their suggestions in the first place, even in the later version which they had published incorporating some of them. While many of the suggestions of the American scholars were based on the differences between American and British usage, many others were based on differences in scholarship and what the American revisers felt the best translation to be. Consequently, there were several changes to the KJV text in the ASV that were not present in the RV. Features The divine name of the Almighty (the Tetragrammaton) is consistently rendered Jehovah in 6,823 places of the ASV Old Testament, rather than ' as it appears mostly in the King James Bible and Revised Version of 1881‚Äì85. However, there are notably seven verses in the King James Bible where the divine name actually appears which are Genesis 22:14, Exodus 6:3, Exodus 17:15, Judges 6:24, Psalms 83:18, Isaiah 12:2 and Isaiah 26:4 plus as its abbreviated form, Jah, once in Psalms 68:4. The English Revised Version (1881‚Äì1885, published with the Apocrypha in 1894) renders the Tetragrammaton as Jehovah where it appears in the King James Version, and another eight times in Exodus 6:2,6‚Äì8, Psalm 68:20, Isaiah 49:14, Jeremiah 16:21 and Habakkuk 3:19 plus as its abbreviated form, Jah, twice in Psalms 68:4 and Psalms 89:8. The reason for this change, as the Committee explained in the preface, was that \\"‚Ä¶the American Revisers‚Ä¶ were brought to the unanimous conviction that a Jewish superstition, which regarded the Divine Name as too sacred to be uttered, ought no longer to dominate in the English or any other version of the Old Testament‚Ä¶\\". It is speculated that because of this, the Jehovah Witness name-dogma was created by Joseph Franklin Rutherford around this time. Other changes from the RV to the ASV included (but were not limited to) substituting \\"who\\" and \\"that\\" for \\"which\\" when referring to people, and Holy Ghost was dropped in favor of Holy Spirit. Page headings were added and footnotes were improved.  Revisions  The ASV has been the basis of six revisions and one refreshing. They were the ‚Äî including two New Testament translation efforts: the 1946 RSV New Testament published alone, with the entire Bible completed in 1952, and then a \\"second edition of the RSV New Testament, issued in 1971, twenty-five years after its initial publication\\" not to be confused with the later \\"New Revised Standard Version\\". ‚Äî, the , the , the , the , the World English Bible, 2000, and the Refreshed American Standard Version New Testament, 2018. (RASV). The ASV was also the basis for Kenneth N. Taylor's Bible paraphrase, . A group commissioned by Adam Lewis Greene in 2014 revised the ASV into the American Literary Version and it was released in 2016.  Usage by Jehovah's Witnesses  The ASV has also been used for many years by Jehovah's Witnesses. The reasons for their choosing of the ASV were twofold: its usage of \\"Jehovah\\" as the Divine Name, which was a translation of the Tetragrammaton (YHWH) into English as some early Bible scholars had done before (i.e. Tyndale at Ps. 83:18). They also derived their name from Isaiah 43:10, 12, both of which contain the phrase, \\"Ye are my witnesses, saith Jehovah.\\" Also, there was a perception that the ASV had improved the translation of some verses in the King James Version, and in other places it reduced the verses that they found to be erroneously translated in the KJV to mere footnotes, removed from the main text altogether.. Jehovah's Witnesses' publishing organization, Watch Tower Bible and Tract Society of Pennsylvania, had printed its own edition of the King James Version since 1926, but did not obtain the rights to print ASV until 1944. From 1944 to 1992, they printed and distributed over a million copies of the ASV. By the 1960s, the New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures, made by members of their group and the rights to which they controlled, had largely replaced ASV as the Bible used most by Witnesses.. Though now preferring the NWT, Jehovah's Witnesses' publications frequently quote from other translations, including ASV.

It is one of the three major towns of Slovenian Istria. The town is known for its medieval architecture, with narrow streets and compact houses. Piran is the administrative seat of the Municipality of Piran and one of Slovenia's major tourist attractions. Until the mid-20th century, Italian was the dominant language, but it was replaced by Slovene as demographics shifted. History Piran before the end of the 19th century In the pre-Roman era, the hills in the Piran area were inhabited by Illyrian Histri tribes who were farmers, hunters and fishermen. They were also pirates who disrupted Roman trade in the northern Adriatic. The Piran peninsula was incorporated into the Roman Empire in 178 and 177 BC and settled in the following years with rural homes (villae rusticae). Piran before the inner marina was buried and remade into a town square Tartini Square as it appears today The decline of the Roman Empire, from the 5th century AD onward, and incursions by the Avars and Slavs at the end of the 6th century, prompted the Roman population to withdraw into easily defensible locations such as islands or peninsulas. This started local urbanisation and by the 7th century, under Byzantine rule, Piran had become heavily fortified. Despite the defences, the Franks conquered Istria in 788 and Slavs settled in the region. By 952, Piran had become a part of the Holy Roman Empire. The earliest reliable records of the area are in the 7th century work Cosmographia by an anonymous cleric of Ravenna. The name of the town most probably originates from the Greek \\"pyrrhos\\", which means \\"red\\", because of the reddish flysch stones commonly found in the town's area. Some historians also refer it to \\"pyros\\", meaning fire, due to ancient lighthouses which were supposed to be on the edge of the marina. From 1283 to 1797, the town became part of the Republic of Venice, where it was governed in a semi- autonoumous way, with a council of local noblemen assisting the Venetian delegate. Several enemy (e.g. from the Republic of Genoa) and pirate assaults were repelled during the late Middle Ages; a great pestilence hit the town in 1558, killing about two thirds of the population. The last decades of Venetian rule were marked by decadence, due to the competition with the nearby Austrian port town of Trieste. The town was annexed to the Austrian Empire in 1797; but during the years from 1806 to 1814, when it was ceded to the Napoleonic Empire. On 22 February 1812, the Battle of Pirano was fought between a British and a French ship of the line in the vicinity of Piran. This was a minor battle of the Adriatic campaign of the Napoleonic Wars. The French Rivoli had been recently completed at Venice. The French naval authorities intended her to bolster French forces in the Adriatic, following a succession of defeats in the preceding year. Captain John Talbot of HMS Victorious arrived off Venice in mid-February and blockaded the port. When the Rivoli attempted to escape under the cover of fog, Talbot chased her and forced her to surrender in a five-hour battle, the Rivoli lost over half her crew as either wounded or dead. This was the only battle ever fought in the sea nowadays belonging to Slovenia. At the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century, Piran was an Austro-Hungarian town with over 12,000 inhabitants, larger than nearby Koper. It was a flourishing market and spa town with good transport connections. The first trolleybus line in the Balkans was introduced to public service on 24 October 1909 in Piran. In 1912, it was replaced by a tramway that operated on the same route till 1953. After the First World War, together with Trieste and all Istria, the town was ceded to Italy. There were no particular events in those years, until Italy entered the Second World War in 1940. With the defeat of the Axis powers and the rise of Tito's rule, Piran was assigned to the Free Territory of Trieste, Zone B, under Yugoslavian administration. The town was annexed to Yugoslavia in 1954, according to the London Memorandum signed together with Italy. A significant part of Piran's population chose to emigrate to Italy or abroad in the final phase of the Istrian exodus, rather than stay in socialist Yugoslavia. The annexation to Yugoslavia was finally ratified with the Osimo Treaty in 1975, signed by Italy as well. Since 1991, Piran has been part of independent Slovenia. On 24 October 2010, Slovenia became the first country of former communist Europe to elect a black mayor. The physician Peter Bossman, who came from Ghana in the late 1970s, was elected the Mayor of Piran. He officially took office at the first constitutional meeting of the Municipal Council on 12 November 2010, succeeding Toma≈æ Gantar. He represents the Social Democrats. The territorial claims of Croatia and Slovenia in the Gulf of Piran remain an important matter of debate in the Croatia‚ÄìSlovenia border disputes that began after the dissolution of Yugoslavia. Culture and education Giuseppe Tartini's statue of the sculptor with St. George's Cathedral in the background Piran is the birthplace of the composer and violinist Giuseppe Tartini, who played an important role in shaping its cultural heritage. The town's main square, Tartini Square (, ), is named after him. In 1892, the 200th anniversary of his birth, a monument to Tartini was erected in Piran. Venetian artist Antonio Dal Zotto was commissioned to create a larger-than-life bronze statue, which was mounted on its pedestal in 1896. The statue dominates the square, overlooked by the Cathedral of Saint George. The painter Cesare Dell'Acqua was also born in Piran. Piran is the seat of the Euro-Mediterranean University of Slovenia (EMUNI), founded in 2008 as one of the cultural projects of the Barcelona Process: Union for the Mediterranean. The Piran Coastal Galleries, a public institution encompassing a group of six public contemporary art galleries, is based in Piran. =Cultural events= Musical evenings have taken place for decades in the Greyfriars Franciscan monastery's atrium, one of the most beautiful cloister atriums in the Slovenian Littoral, which has good acoustics.\\"St. Francis Church\\". Turistiƒçno zdru≈æenje Portoro≈æ; retrieved 22 September 2015. The municipality's festival is 15 October, which celebrates the foundation of the first Slovenian partisan naval detachment, named Koper, in 1944. Geography and climate Piran is located at the tip of the Piran peninsula on the Gulf of Piran. To the east of the town, along the northern coastline (in the direction to Strunjan) there is a small tourist settlement named Fiesa. Piran and Fiesa are connected by a promenade along the beach. Piran has a humid subtropical climate with warm summers and cool rainy winters. Snow is rare (usually 3 days per year, almost always in traces). There are 22 days a year with maximum temperatures of or higher; on one day a year the temperature does not exceed . Fog appears about 4 days per year, mainly in winter. Demographics Tartini Square According to the Austrian language census of 1910, there were 7,379 inhabitants in the town proper, 95.97% Italians and 0.09% Slovenes. In 1945, the town proper had 5,035 inhabitants, 91.32% Italian and 8.54% Slovene speakers. In 1956 there were 3.574 inhabitants, 67.6% Slovene and 15.5% Italian. After 1947, the ethnic composition changed radically due to the exodus of Italians to Italy and their replacement by Slovene settlers, both from other areas of Slovenian Istria and from interior areas of the country. Monuments Piran town wall Piran was heavily influenced by the Venetian Republic and Austria-Hungary, therefore the monuments differ greatly from those in inner parts of Slovenia. The Piran town walls were constructed to protect the town from Ottoman incursions; many parts of the town walls from different eras remain, and are of interest to tourists. In the middle of the town is the Tartini Square, with a monument in memory of Giuseppe Tartini. Nearby are located various important buildings, such as Tartini‚Äôs house, first mentioned in 1384 and one of the oldest in town, the Municipal Palace, Loggia and Beneƒçanka, among others. On the hill above the town is the biggest and most important church, the Saint George's Church, with a Franciscan monastery nearby. Communications and transport There is an international airport and a marina in the vicinity of the town. The medium- wave transmitter of Radio Koper is in Piran. It transmits on 1170 kHz and has a 123.6-metre-tall guyed mast with cage antenna. The town is connected with Koper, Izola, Portoro≈æ (the location of the airport), Seƒçovlje and Lucija by a cheap bus line. The lines of other coastal settlements operate mostly during the tourist season. The first trolleybus line in the Balkans entered public service on 24 October 1909 in Piran, then part of Austria-Hungary. It ran from Tartini Square along the coast and the shipyard to Portoro≈æ and Lucija. The town authorities bought five trolleybuses manufactured by Austrian company Daimler-Motoren-Gesellschaft. In 1912, it was replaced by a tram system that operated until 1953, when it was superseded by buses. Sports Pod Obzidjem Stadium () is a multi-purpose stadium in Piran. It is used for football matches and is the home ground of football team NK Portoro≈æ Piran. The stadium currently holds 750 spectators, 500 of them can be seated.

The war, which lasted from 1848 to 1851, also involved troops from Prussia and Sweden. Ultimately, under international pressure, the Prussians had to withdraw their forces. As a result, the war ended in a Danish victory over the rebels and the signing of the London Protocol in 1852. A second conflict, the Second Schleswig War, erupted in 1864. Background At the beginning of 1848, Denmark included the Duchy of Schleswig, and the king of Denmark ruled the duchies of Holstein and Saxe-Lauenburg within the German Confederation. The majority of the ethnic Germans in Denmark lived in these areas. Germans made up a third of the country's population, and the three duchies accounted for half of Denmark's economy. The Napoleonic Wars, which had ended in 1815, had fanned both Danish and German nationalism. Pan-German ideology had become highly influential in the decades prior to the wars, and writers such as Jacob Grimm (1785‚Äì1863) and the Norwegian Peter Andreas Munch (1810‚Äì1863) argued that the entire peninsula of Jutland had been populated by Germans before the arrival of the Danes and that therefore Germans could justifiably reclaim it. Jens Jacob Asmussen Worsaae (1821‚Äì1885), an archaeologist who had excavated parts of the Danevirke, countered the pro- German claims, writing pamphlets which argued that there was no way of knowing the language of the earliest inhabitants of Danish territory, that Germans had more solid historical claims to large parts of France and England, and that Slavs by the same reasoning could annex parts of eastern Germany. The conflicting aims of Danish and German nationalists contributed to the outbreak of the First Schleswig War. Danish nationalists believed that Schleswig, but not Holstein, should be a part of Denmark, as Schleswig contained a large number of Danes, whilst Holstein did not. German nationalists believed that Schleswig, Holstein, and Lauenburg should remain united, and their belief that Schleswig and Holstein should not be separated led to the two duchies being referred to as Schleswig-Holstein. Schleswig became a particular source of contention, as it contained a large number of Danes, Germans and North Frisians. Another cause of the war was the legally questionable change to the rules of ducal succession in the duchies. King Christian VIII of Denmark died in January 1848. His only legitimate son, the future Frederick VII, seemed unable to beget heirs, thus the duchies appeared likely to pass to the rule of the House of Oldenburg, which might have resulted in a division of Denmark. Accordingly, Christian VIII had decreed (8 July 1846) a change to the succession law in the duchies to allow succession through the female line. The implementation of this law was illegal. Trigger The Schleswig-Holsteiners, being inspired from the successes of the French in the revolution in Paris of February 1848, sent a deputation to Copenhagen to demand the immediate recognition by King Frederick VII of a joint state of Schleswig-Holstein previous to its admittance into the German Confederation. King Frederick's reply, in which he admitted the right of Holstein as a German confederate state to be guided by the decrees of the Frankfurt diet, but declared that he had neither \\"the power, right, nor wish\\" to incorporate Schleswig into the confederation, was immediately followed or even perhaps preceded by an outbreak of open rebellion. Schleswig-Holsteinian Prince Frederik of Noer took the 5th \\"Lauenburger\\" Rifle Corps (J√§gerkorps) and some students of Kiel university to take over the fortress of Rendsburg in Schleswig-Holstein. The fortress contained the main armoury of the duchies, and the 14th, 15th, and 16th Infantry Battalions, the 2nd Regiment of Artillery, as well as some military engineers. When Noer's force arrived, they found that the gates to the fortress had been left open for an unknown reason and promptly walked in, surprising the would-be defenders. After delivering a speech to the defenders, the prince secured the allegiance of the battalions and regiment of artillery to the provisional government. Danish officers who had been serving in the defence of the fortress were allowed to leave for Denmark on the assurance that they did not fight against Schleswig-Holstein in the coming war. Course of the war =1848= Wishing to defeat Denmark before Prussian, Austrian, and German troops arrived to support them, 7,000 Schleswig-Holsteinish soldiers under General Krohn occupied Flensborg on 31 March. Over 7,000 Danish soldiers landed east of the city, and Krohn, fearing he would be surrounded, ordered his forces to withdraw. The Danes were able to reach the Schleswig- Holsteiners before they were able to retreat, and the subsequent Battle of Bov on 9 April was a Danish victory. At the battle, the Prince of Noer, senior commander of the Schleswig-Holsteinish forces, did not arrive until two hours after fighting had started, and the Schleswig-Holsteiners were more prepared for the withdrawal they had intended to make than for an engagement. *12 April: The diet recognized the provisional government of Schleswig and commissioned Prussia to enforce its decrees. General Wrangel was also ordered to occupy Schleswig. *23 April: Prussian victory in battle at Schleswig. *23 April: German victory in battle at Mysunde. *24 April: Prussian victory in battle at Oeversee. *27 May: Battle at Sundeved. *28 May: Battle at Nyb√∏l. *5 June: Danish victory over Germans in battle at Dybb√∏l Hill. *7 June: Battle at Hoptrup. *30 June: Battle at Bjerning. The Germans had embarked on this course of participation in the Schleswig-Holstein War alone, without the European powers. The other European powers were united in opposing any dismemberment of Denmark, even Austria refusing to assist in enforcing the German view. Swedish troops landed to assist the Danes; Tsar Nicholas I of Russia, speaking with authority as head of the senior Gottorp line, pointed out to King Frederick William IV of Prussia the risks of a collision. Great Britain, though the Danes had rejected her mediation, threatened to send her fleet to assist in preserving the status quo. The fact that Prussia had entered the war on behalf of the revolutionary forces in Schleswig-Holstein created a great number of ironies. The newly elected Frankfurt Diet tended to support the incursion into the Schleswig-Holstein War while King Frederick William did not. Indeed, Frederick William ordered Friedrich von Wrangel, commanding the army of the German Confederation, to withdraw his troops from the duchies; but the general refused, asserting that he was under the command of the Diet of the German Confederation and not of the King of Prussia but of the regent of Germany (Archduke John of Austria). Wrangel proposed that, at the very least, any treaty concluded should be presented for ratification to the Frankfurt Diet. The Danes rejected this proposal and negotiations were broken off. Prussia was now confronted on the one side by the German nation urging her clamorously to action, on the other side by the European powers threatening dire consequences should she persist. After painful hesitation, Frederick William chose what seemed the lesser of two evils, and, on 26 August, Prussia signed a convention at Malm√∂ which yielded to practically all the Danish demands. The Holstein estates appealed to the German diet, which hotly took up their cause, but it was soon clear that the central government had no means of enforcing its views. In the end the convention was ratified at Frankfurt. The convention was essentially nothing more than a truce establishing a temporary modus vivendi. The main issues, left unsettled, continued to be hotly debated. In October, at a conference in London, Denmark suggested an arrangement on the basis of a separation of Schleswig from Holstein, which was about to become a member of a new German empire, with Schleswig having a separate constitution under the Danish crown. =1849= *27 January: The London conference result was supported by Great Britain and Russia and accepted by Prussia and the German parliament. The negotiations broke down, however, on the refusal of Denmark to yield the principle of the indissoluble union with the Danish crown. *23 February: The truce came to an end. *3 April: The war was renewed. At this point Nicholas I intervened in favour of peace. However, Prussia, conscious of her restored strength and weary of the intractable temper of the Frankfurt parliament, determined to take matters into her own hands. *3 April: Danish victory over Schleswig-Holstein forces in battle at Adsb√∏l. *5 April: Battle of Eckernf√∂rde *6 April: Battles at Ullerup and Avnb√∏l. *13 April: Danish victory over Saxon forces in battle at Dybb√∏l. *23 April: Battle at Kolding. *31 May: Danes stop Prussian advance through Jutland in cavalry battle at Vejlby. *4 June: inconclusive Battle of Heligoland (1849) *6 July: Danish victory in sortie from Fredericia. *10 July: Another truce was signed. Schleswig, until the peace, was to be administered separately, under a mixed commission; Holstein was to be governed by a vicegerent of the German empire (an arrangement equally offensive to German and Danish sentiment). A settlement seemed as far off as ever. The Danes still clamoured for the principle of succession in the female line and union with Denmark, the Germans for that of succession in the male line and union with Holstein. =1850= In April 1850, Prussia, which had pulled out of the war after the treaty of Malm√∂, proposed a definitive peace on the basis of the status quo ante bellum and postponement of all questions as to mutual rights. To Palmerston the basis seemed meaningless and the proposed settlement would settle nothing. Nicholas I, openly disgusted with Frederick William's submission to the Frankfurt Parliament, again intervened. To him Duke Christian of Augustenborg was a rebel. Russia had guaranteed Schleswig to the Danish crown by the 1773 Treaty of Tsarskoye Selo. As for Holstein, if the King of Denmark could not deal with the rebels there, he himself would intervene as he had done in Hungary. The threat was reinforced by the menace of the European situation. Austria and Prussia were on the verge of war, and the sole hope of preventing Russia from entering such a war on the side of Austria lay in settling the Schleswig- Holstein question in a manner desirable to her. The only alternative, an alliance with the hated Napoleon Bonaparte's nephew, Louis Napoleon, who was already dreaming of acquiring the Rhine frontier for France in return for his aid in establishing German sea-power by the ceding of the duchies, was abhorrent to Frederick William. *8 April: Karl Wilhelm von Willisen became the Supreme Commander of the German Forces *2 July: A treaty of peace between Prussia and Denmark was signed at Berlin. Both parties reserved all their antecedent rights. Denmark was satisfied that the treaty empowered the King of Denmark to restore his authority in Holstein with or without the consent of the German Confederation. Danish troops now marched in to coerce the refractory duchies. While the fighting went on, negotiations among the powers continued. *24‚Äì25 July: Danish victory in the Battle of Idstedt. *28 July: Danish victory in cavalry battle at Jagel. *2 August: Great Britain, France, Russia and Sweden-Norway signed a protocol, to which Austria subsequently adhered, approving the principle of restoring the integrity of the Danish monarchy. *12 September: Battle at Missunde. *4 October: Danish forces resist German siege at Friedrichstadt. *24 November: Battle of Lottorf *31 December: Skirmish at M√∂hlhorst. =1851= *May: The Copenhagen government made an abortive attempt to come to an understanding with the inhabitants of the duchies by convening an assembly of notables at Flensburg. *6 December 1851: The Copenhagen government announced a project for the future organization of the monarchy on the basis of the equality of its constituent states, with a common ministry. =1852= *28 January: A royal letter announced the institution of a unitary state which, while maintaining the fundamental constitution of Denmark, would increase the parliamentary powers of the estates of the two duchies. This proclamation was approved by Prussia and Austria, and by the German confederal diet insofar as it affected Holstein and Lauenburg. The question of the Augustenborg succession made an agreement between the powers impossible. *31 March: The Duke of Augustenborg resigned his claim in return for a money payment. Further adjustments followed. *8 May: another London Protocol was signed. The international treaty that became known as the \\"London Protocol\\" was the revision of the earlier protocol, which had been ratified on 2 August 1850, by the major Germanic powers of Austria and Prussia. The second, actual London Protocol was recognized by the five major European powers (the Austrian Empire, the Second French Republic, the Kingdom of Prussia, the Russian Empire, and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland), as well as the two major Baltic Sea powers of Denmark and Sweden. The Protocol affirmed the integrity of the Danish federation as a \\"European necessity and standing principle\\". Accordingly, the duchies of Schleswig (a Danish fief) and Holstein, and Lauenburg (sovereign states within the German Confederation) were joined by personal union with the King of Denmark. For this purpose, the line of succession to the duchies was modified, because Frederick VII of Denmark remained childless and hence a change in dynasty was in order. (The originally conflicting protocols of succession between the duchies and Denmark would have stipulated that, contrary to the treaty, the duchies of Holstein and Lauenburg would have had heads of state other than the King of Denmark.) Further, it was affirmed that the duchies were to remain as independent entities, and that Schleswig would have no greater constitutional affinity to Denmark than Holstein. This settlement did not resolve the issue, as the German Diet had steadfastly refused to recognize the treaty, and asserted that the law of 1650 was still in force, by which the Duchies were not united to the state of Denmark, but only to the direct line of the Danish kings, and were to revert on its extinction, not to the branch of Glucksburg, but to the German ducal family of Augustenburg. Only twelve years passed before the Second Schleswig War in 1864 resulted in the incorporation of both duchies into the German Confederation, and later, in 1871, into the German Empire.

The war began on 1 February 1864, when Prussian and Austrian forces crossed the border into Schleswig. Denmark fought the Kingdom of Prussia and the Austrian Empire. Like the First Schleswig War (1848‚Äì1852), it was fought for control of the duchies of Schleswig, Holstein and Lauenburg, due to the succession disputes concerning them when the Danish king died without an heir acceptable to the German Confederation. The war started after the passing of the November Constitution of 1863, which integrated the Duchy of Schleswig into the Danish kingdom in violation of the London Protocol. The war ended on 30 October 1864, with the Treaty of Vienna and Denmark's cession of the Duchies of Schleswig (except for the island of √Ür√∏, which remained Danish), Holstein and Saxe- Lauenburg to Prussia and Austria. Background Military clashes in Schleswig/Slesvig In 1848, Denmark received its first liberal constitution. At the same time, and partly as a consequence, the secessionist movement of the large German majority in Holstein and southern Schleswig was suppressed in the First Schleswig War (1848‚Äì51), when the Germans in both territories failed in their attempt to become a united, sovereign and independent state: At the time, the king of Denmark was also duke of the duchies of Holstein and Schleswig. However, the movement continued throughout the 1850s and 1860s, as Denmark attempted to integrate the Duchy of Schleswig into the Danish kingdom while liberal proponents of German unification expressed the wish to include the Danish-ruled duchies of Holstein and Schleswig in a Greater Germany. Holstein was completely ethnically German, had been a German fief before 1806 was a part of the German Confederation. Schleswig was a Danish fief and was linguistically mixed between German and Danish and North Frisian, partly due to German immigration over the centuries. Before the middle ages, the people of Schleswig spoke Danish and Frisian, and as late as the 18th century many rural areas of southern Schleswig still spoke Danish. In the early 19th century the northern and middle parts of Schleswig spoke Danish, but the language in the southern half had shifted to German. German culture was dominant among the clergy and nobility; Danish had a lower social status and was spoken mainly by the rural population. For centuries, while the rule of the king was absolute, these conditions had created few tensions. When liberal and egalitarian ideas spread and nationalist currents emerged about 1820, identification was mixed between Danish and German: The German elites in Schleswig wished to be a part of Germany, while the Danes wanted Schleswig to be more firmly integrated into Denmark proper. Furthermore, there was a grievance about tolls charged by Denmark on ships passing through the Danish Straits between the Baltic Sea and the North Sea. To avoid that expense, Prussia and Austria planned to construct the Kiel Canal, which could not be built as long as Denmark ruled Holstein. Schleswig, Holstein and Lauenburg before the war Much of the dispute focused on the heir of King Frederick VII of Denmark. The Germans of Holstein and Schleswig supported the House of Augustenburg, a cadet branch of the Danish royal family, but the average Dane considered them too German and preferred the rival Gl√ºcksburg branch with Prince Christian of Gl√ºcksburg as the new sovereign. Prince Christian had served on the Danish side in the First Schleswig War (1848‚Äì1851). Statue of Otto von Bismarck in Schleswig-Holstein The peace treaty that had ended the war in 1851 stipulated that the duchy of Schleswig should be treated the same as the duchy of Holstein regarding its relations with the Kingdom of Denmark. However, during the revisions of the 1848 constitution in the late 1850s and early 1860s, Holstein refused to acknowledge the revision, creating a crisis in which the parliament in Copenhagen ratified the revision but Holstein did not. In 1863, Frederick VII died, and the new Danish king ordered that the new constitution should apply to Schleswig and Denmark, but not to Holstein. This was a clear breach of the 1851 peace treaty and the London Protocol of 1852 and gave Prussia and the German Confederation a casus belli against Denmark. The German position was considerably more favorable than it had been thirteen years before, when Prussia had to give in due to the risk of military intervention by Britain, France and Russia on behalf of Denmark: France had colonial problems, not least with Britain. Otto von Bismarck had neutralized Russia politically and succeeded in obtaining cooperation from Austria which underlined its great power status within the German union, while Britain was upset that Denmark had violated the London Protocol. To understand the Danish resolve in this question one must understand that the Danes regarded Schleswig as an ancient core region of Denmark. The southern part of Schleswig contains the ruins of the old Danish Viking \\"capital\\" Hedeby and the Danevirke fortification; its first sections were built around 400‚Äì500 AD, possibly to protect Denmark from migrating tribes during the age of migration. Before the Danes took possession of the area, around 500 AD, Schleswig was the home of the Angles, of which many migrated to Britain, where they later formed the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms; the remaining Angles are believed to have assimilated with the Danes, indeed the Angles and the Danes seem to have had a very close relationship as attested by the shared sagas of the early English and Danes. Thus, to suggest that the region did no longer fully belong to Denmark was seen as a great provocation to the Danes' ancestral claim to Schleswig. The Germans, on the other hand, referred to medieval history: Already in 1326 and 1448, the Danish kings had accepted the almost complete independence of Schleswig from the Danish crown. The Germans argued that the duchy had therefore not been part of Denmark proper for 400 years, but instead was \\"forever inseparable\\" (up ewich ungedeelt) from the German duchy of Holstein, something the Danish king had promised as early as 1460. In short, the Danes considered Schleswig to be an integral part of Denmark and wished to make this clear by enacting a new constitution that excluded Holstein, while the Germans thought that Schleswig was inseparable from Holstein: If the Danish crown wished to treat the two Duchies differently, the only solution was, in their eyes, to get rid of Danish rule altogether. Both sides thus saw the other as the aggressor. Constitutional crisis (1848 to 1863) After years of growing tension, the adoption of the Constitution of Denmark in 1848 had complicated matters further, as many Danes wished for the new liberal constitution to apply to all Danes, including those in Schleswig. The constitutions of Holstein and Schleswig were dominated by the Estates system, giving more power to the most affluent members of society, with the result that both Schleswig and Holstein were politically dominated by a predominantly German class of landowners. Thus two systems of government co-existed within the same state: constitutional monarchy in Denmark, and absolutism in Schleswig and Holstein. The three units were governed by one cabinet, comprising liberal Danish ministers, who urged economic and social reforms, and conservative ministers, who opposed political reform. This caused a deadlock for practical lawmaking. Moreover, Danish opponents of this so-called Unitary State (Helstaten) feared that Holstein's presence in the government and simultaneous membership of the German Confederation would lead to increased German interference with Schleswig, and even in purely Danish affairs. At the same time, liberal German politicians came to power in Schleswig and Holstein; their goal was to unify the two duchies, to gain independence from the Danish king and to join the German Confederation as a sovereign state. The objectives of the Danish and German liberals were therefore incompatible, which in 1848 ultimately led to war. In Germany, many people viewed the conflict of Schleswig as a war of liberation, while most Danes considered it a German aggression. In Copenhagen, the Palace and most of the administration (unlike most liberal politicians) supported a strict adherence to the status quo. The same applied to foreign powers, such as Great Britain, France and Russia, who would not accept a weakened Denmark in favour of Germany, nor a Prussia that had acquired Holstein with the important naval harbour of Kiel that controlled the entrance to the Baltic. After Prussia had therefore been forced to withdraw its support from the insurgents in Schleswig and Holstein in 1851, the Danes were able to defeat the rebels in the First Schleswig War. However, in 1852, they had to commit themselves to treat Schleswig constitutionally no different than Holstein. This contradicted the objective of the Danish liberals to fully reintegrate Schleswig into Denmark. In 1858, the German Confederation deposed the 'union constitution' of the Danish monarchy concerning Holstein and Lauenburg, which were members of the Confederation. The two duchies were henceforth without any constitution, while the 'union constitution' still applied to Schleswig and Denmark proper. As the heirless King Frederick VII grew older, Denmark's successive National-Liberal cabinets became increasingly focused on maintaining control of Schleswig following the king's demise. The king died in 1863 at a particularly critical time; work on the November Constitution for the joint affairs of Denmark and Schleswig had just been completed, with the draft awaiting his signature. The new King, Christian IX, felt compelled to sign the draft constitution on 18 November 1863, expressing grave concern. In doing so, the king violated the London Protocol of 1852 and gave the Prussian Prime Minister Otto von Bismarck a justification for war. This action caused outrage among the duchies' German population and a resolution was passed by the German Confederation at the initiative of Bismarck, calling for the occupation of Holstein by Confederate forces. The Danish government abandoned Holstein and pulled the Danish Army back to the border between Schleswig and Holstein. Most of it fortified itself behind the Danevirke. This order to retreat without combat caused adverse comment among some Danish private soldiers, but the military circumstances made it wise to shorten the frontier that needed to be defended. Also, as the administrations of Holstein and Lauenburg were members of the German Confederation, not pulling back might have caused a severe political crisis and perhaps war with Great Britain, guarantor of the London Protocol. Strategy There were so- called \\"flank positions\\" near Ebeltoft (North), the fortified city of Fredericia (center), and Dybb√∏l in the south designed to support the strategy of defending the peninsula of Jutland along the north‚Äìsouth axis using naval supremacy to move the army north‚Äìsouth and hence trap an invading army in futile marches between these flank positions. This would deny the (assumed superior) invader the chance of forcing the defenders into a decisive battle, and give the defenders the opportunity to swiftly mass and counter-attack weak enemy positions, besieging forces, or divided forces by shifting weight by sea transport. The political dimension of this strategy was to draw out the war and hence give time and opportunity for the \\"great powers\\" to intervene diplomatically‚Äîit was assumed that such an intervention would be to the advantage of (neutral) Denmark. This strategy had been successful in the First Schleswig War. Unrealistic expectations of the potency of the Danish army and incompetence at the political level had overruled the command of the army's wishes to defend Jutland according to the above plan, and instead favoured a frontal defense of Jutland on or near the historical defense (and legendary border) line at the Danevirke, near the city of Schleswig in the south. Hence resources had been put into the Danevirke line and not into the flank positions, which stayed akin to battlefield fortifications rather than modern fortifications capable of withstanding a modern bombardment. The problem with the Danevirke line was that perhaps it was relatively strong against a frontal assault but leaned on bodies of water or marshes at both ends. In early 1864, these waters and marshes froze solid in a hard winter letting the Germans bypass the Danevirke. The first attempt to bypass the position failed near Missunde, but eventually the Germans appeared in force in the Danevirke's rear, compelling the Danish high command to order the line abandoned. As this decision was taken in violation of direct orders from the Danish government and in opposition to public opinion in Denmark, General de Meza was relieved of his command and replaced by the more loyal General Gerlach. The Danish army then occupied another fortified line called \\"the old Dybb√∏l\\". This position did not bar the entrance to Jutland but only the tip of a peninsula jutting into the Baltic Sea. There is little doubt that the command of the army did not believe that they could successfully repulse a well-prepared German siege and consequent assault on the Dybb√∏l position, and assumed that the political level would let the army be evacuated by sea and then fight the war on the principles of the north‚Äìsouth axis strategy. But the political level did not appreciate the gravity of the situation, insisting on maintaining military presence in Schleswig and at the same time refused more modest German demands of peace. Hence the army was ordered to defend the Dybb√∏l position \\"to the last man\\", and consequently the siege of Dybb√∏l began. Communications in the area The only railways in 1864 in Denmark north of the Konge√• were a line in Sj√¶lland from Copenhagen to Kors√∏r, and one in northern Jutland from √Örhus to the northwest. Any reinforcements for the Danevirke from Copenhagen would have gone by rail to Kors√∏r and thence by ship to Flensburg, taking two or three days, if not hindered by storm or sea-ice. There was a good railway system in the duchies, but not further north than Flensburg and Husum. Schleswig city, Flensburg, S√∏nderborg, and Dybb√∏l were all connected by a road paved with crushed rock, this being the route the army took. The same road continued from Flensburg to Fredericia and √Örhus and this was the route later taken by the Prussian army when it invaded Jutland. Events =1863= On 18 November 1863, King Christian IX of Denmark signed the so-called \\"November constitution\\" establishing a shared law of succession and a common parliament for both Schleswig and Denmark. This was seen by the German Confederation as a violation of the 1852 London Protocol. On 28 November, the German Diet removed the Danish delegate for the duchies of Holstein and Lauenburg pending resolution of the succession issue and the naming of a new delegate from a government recognized by the Diet. On 24 December 1863, Saxon and Hanoverian troops marched into Holstein on behalf of the Confederation (as part as the federal execution (Bundesexekution) against Holstein). Supported by the German soldiers and by loyal Holsteiners, Frederick VIII, a claimant to both duchies, took control of the government of Holstein. =1864= January In January the situation remained tense but without fighting; Danish forces controlled the north bank of the Eider River and German forces the south bank. All the inland waters (Eider River, Treene, Schlei, and the marshes east of Husum and around the Rheider Au) that the Danes were relying on as defence to guard the flanks of the Dannevirke, were frozen hard and could be crossed easily. Domestically, Bismarck had been under great pressure since a constitutional crisis in 1862, and he was hoping to gain public support among Prussian liberals by achieving the \\"liberation\\" of Schleswig. The decision not to settle for the occupation of the German Duchy of Holstein, but to invade Schleswig, was taken by the Prussian and Austrian governments alone. The other members of the German Confederation did not agree, and it was even discussed to declare war on the two great powers. However, due to the military superiority of the Prussians and Austrians, this did not happen. On 14 January 1864, Austria and Prussia declared to take action against Denmark without regard to decisions of the German Confederation.J√ºrgen M√ºller: Der Deutsche Bund 1815‚Äì1866, Oldenbourg Verlag, M√ºnchen 2006, p. 46‚Äì47 On 16 January 1864, Bismarck issued an ultimatum to Denmark demanding that the November Constitution should be abolished within 48 hours. This was politically impossible, particularly given the short deadline, and the demand was consequently rejected by the Danish government. February Sankelmark in February 1864 At the start of the war, the Danish army consisted of about 38,000 men in four divisions. The 8th Brigade consisted of the 9th and 20th Regiments (approximately 1,600 soldiers each), mainly soldiers from the middle and west and north of Jutland. About 36,000 men defended the Dannevirke, a job which it was said would have needed 50,000 men to do properly. The 1st Regiment had been changed from a battalion to a regiment on 1 December 1863. The Prussian army had 37 battalions, 29 squadrons and 110 guns, approximately 38,400 men. The Austrian army had 20 battalions, 10 squadrons and 48 guns, approximately 23,000 men. During the war the Prussian army was strengthened with 64 guns and 20,000 men. The supreme commander for the Prussian-Austrian army was Field Marshal Friedrich Graf von Wrangel. The Austrian troops were led by General Ludwig von Gablenz. Prussian and Austrian troops crossed into Schleswig on 1 February 1864 against the resistance of the Federal Assembly of the German Confederation, and war became inevitable. The Austrians attacked towards the refortified Dannevirke frontally while the Prussian forces struck the Danish fortifications at Mysunde (on the Schlei coast of Schwansen east of Schleswig town), trying to bypass the Danevirke by crossing the frozen Schlei inlet, but in six hours could not take the Danish positions, and retreated. Austrian illustration of the battle for K√∂nigsh√ºgel In the Battle for K√∂nigsh√ºgel (Danish Kongsh√∏j, translated King's Hill) near Selk on 3 February 1864, Austrian forces commanded by General Gondrecourt pushed the Danes back to the Dannevirke. The Danish 6th Brigade had an important part. The battle was fought in a snowstorm at . Danish fighting against Austrians at Selk and Kongsh√∏j and Saksarmen on February 3, 1864 is described as follows: A Danish military report dated 11 February 1864 describes incidents near K√∂nigsh√ºgel/Kongsh√∏j and Vedelspang as follows: On 5 February 1864, the Danish commander-in-chief, lieutenant general Christian Julius De Meza, abandoned the Dannevirke that night to avoid being surrounded and withdrew his army to Flensburg. The retreat caused the deaths and capture of 600 men. Ten soldiers froze to death and were counted as a part of the casualties that night. The hasty retreat also forced the Danes to abandon their important heavy artillery. The railway from the south to Flensburg was never properly used during this evacuation and the Danish army only evacuated what men and horses could carry or pull by road, leaving behind much artillery, most importantly heavy artillery. Some hours later, the Prussians and Austrians discovered the retreat and started to pursue. The Battle of Dybb√∏l by J√∏rgen Valentin Sonne, 1871 This withdrawal to Als and Dybb√∏l has gone down in Danish history as one of the worst experiences that Danish soldiers have been exposed to. Some of them compared it to Napoleon's retreat from Moscow. It was northwards in a north gale with driven snow, and most of the soldiers had had no rest for the last four days and nights:image. The march was burdened with artillery guns and supply carts and had to be as slow as its slowest component. Men and horses had trouble standing. Horses could not carry or pull their loads properly because of the snow and ice; riders had to dismount and lead their horses. Artillery guns and carts overturned. The column of men and horses and vehicles seemed endless. The army had to march from the Danevirke to Flensburg, which took about 14‚Äì18 hours. (Schleswig, Schleswig-Holstein is at the east end of the Danevirke and is 20 mi from Flensburg as the crow flies. The march was actually longer than 20 mi because soldiers had to walk from their positions to Schleswig, Schleswig-Holstein first.) They also had to fight rearguard against pursuing Prussians and Austrians. Some men in sight of Flensburg and thankful for the coming rest were ordered to stop or go back to man checkpoints. Many men were missing at the roll call, and the army thought that many Schleswigian soldiers had deserted during the march and went home. However, most of them came in that morning or the next morning. The storming of Dybb√∏l Near Stolk-Helligbek, about 10 kilometers north of Schleswig, pursuing Austrians reached them, and in heavy fighting near Overs√∏, the 9th and 20th Regiments of the 8th Brigade lost 600 men dead, injured and captured. On that day ten Danish soldiers died of hypothermia. The Prussians crossed the frozen Schlei at Arnis on 6 February 1864, defeating the Danes there. In the Battle of Sankelmark (about eight kilometers south of Flensburg) pursuing Austrians caught up with the Danish rear party, which consisted of the 1st and 11th regiments. The Danes were commanded by Colonel Max M√ºller. A hard fight, where large parts of 1st Regiment were taken prisoner, stopped the Austrians, and the retreat could continue. However, the Danes lost more than 500 men there. After a short rest and some food and drink in Flensburg, the 8th Brigade had to march to S√∏nderborg, where they were taken by ship to Fredericia. Soldiers packed the ship and could not lie down to rest. Furthermore, some had to stay outside on the deck and were nearly frozen. Other units stayed in Dybb√∏l; some reportedly were so exhausted on arrival that they laid on the ground in heaps three or four deep to sleep. Danish Infantry Regiment repels attack by Austrian hussars Als by the Prussians The loss of the Dannevirke without a fight, which in the 19th century played a big role in Danish national mythology due to its long history, caused a substantial psychological shock in Denmark and, as a result, de Meza had to resign from supreme command. Denmark never again ruled the Dannevirke. The Austrians, under general Ludwig Karl Wilhelm von Gablenz, marched north from Flensburg, while the Prussians advanced east on S√∏nderborg. On 18 February 1864, some Prussian hussars, in the excitement of a cavalry skirmish, crossed the north frontier of Schleswig into Denmark proper and occupied the town of Kolding. An invasion of Denmark itself had not been part of the original programme of the allies. Bismarck determined to use this circumstance to revise the whole situation. He urged upon Austria the necessity for a strong policy, to settle, comprehensively, the question of the duchies and the wider question of the German Confederation; Austria reluctantly consented to press the war. The Austrian army decided to stop at the north frontier of Schleswig. Some Prussians moved against Kolding and Vejle. On 22 February 1864, Prussian troops attacked the Danish forward line at Dybb√∏l, pushing them back to the main defence line. March * 8 March 1864, Bismarck pushed the Austrians into moving into Denmark proper. * Austrian forces captured Vejle after fierce house-to-house combat. The Danish units involved retreated to Horsens and later to Vendsyssel. In Fredericia, the Danish 8th Brigade's 20th Regiment was involved in a bigger skirmish: the regiment's first Company were captured near Snogh√∏j, on the mainland near where the (old) Lilleb√¶lt bridge is now. The rest of Fredericia's garrison retreated to Fyn. * 15 March 1864: Prussian siege artillery began to bombard the Danish fortifications at Dybb√∏l from positions at Broager. * 17 March 1864: The Prussian army drove back the Danish outposts in front of Dybb√∏l.

Slesvigske Krig#Afsluttende kampe (in Danish) With this all of Jutland, the Danish mainland, was occupied by the Germans. Now the Danish islands were also endangered, and the Danish government again had to accept armistice and peace negotiations, now however under clearly more difficult conditions. August and after The preliminaries of a peace treaty were signed on 1 August 1864: the King of Denmark renounced all his rights in the duchies in favour of the Emperor of Austria and the King of Prussia. Map of the territorial changes, without the royal Danish enclaves (German) In the Treaty of Vienna, 30 October 1864, Denmark ceded Schleswig, Holstein and Lauenburg to Prussia and Austria. Denmark was also forced to surrender the enclaves in western Schleswig that were legally part of Denmark proper and not part of Schleswig, but was allowed to keep the island of √Ür√∏ (which had been administered as part of Schleswig), the town of Ribe and its surrounding land, and eight parishes from Tyrstrup Herred south of Kolding. As a result of the peace settlement, the land area of the Danish monarchy decreased by 40% and the total population reduced from 2.6 million to 1.6 million (about 38.5%).Historiecenter Dybb√∏l Banke The Danish frontier had retreated about 250 km as measured from the furthest corner of the Duchy of Lauenburg to the new frontier on the Konge√• river. When the Danish army returned to Copenhagen after this war, they received no cheering or other public acclaim, unlike on their victorious return after the First Schleswig War. Aftermath Austrian veterans from the Second Schleswig War of 1864; photograph taken in 1914 from an excursion they took to Vejle in Denmark the same year. In the Prussian forces' first clash of arms since reorganization, their effectiveness proved clear, something the Austrians ignored to their cost 18 months later in the Austro-Prussian War, and contributed to a perception in the German states that Prussia was the only state that could defend the other German states against external aggression. (See Unification of Germany.) Prussia and Austria took over the respective administration of Schleswig and Holstein under the Gastein Convention of 14 August 1865. About 200,000 Danes came under German rule. Following the loss, Christian IX went behind the backs of the Danish government to contact the Prussians, offering that the whole of Denmark could join the German confederation, if Denmark could stay united with Schleswig and Holstein. This proposal was rejected by Bismarck, who feared that the ethnic strife in Schleswig between Danes and Germans would then stay unresolved. Christian IX's negotiations were not publicly known until published in the 2010 book Dommedag Als by Tom Buk- Swienty, who had been given access to the royal archives by Queen Margrethe II. The Peace of Prague in 1866 confirmed Denmark's cession of the two duchies, but promised a plebiscite to decide whether north Schleswig wished to return to Danish rule. This provision was unilaterally set aside by a resolution of Prussia and Austria in 1878. =Effects on Denmark= The war is generally considered to be a national trauma for Denmark. Despite Charles XV's promise to send troops, Sweden-Norway refused to aid Denmark. Consequently, the pan-Scandinavism movement focused on literature and language rather than political unification. Likewise, the war proved to be a diplomatic setback for the British government, whose attempts to mediate the conflict and deter Prussia were rebuffed.Black, Jeremy (ed.). The Tory World: Deep History and the Tory Theme in British Foreign Policy, 1679-2014. Taylor & Francis (2016), p. 191. The war also shocked Denmark out of any idea of using war as a political tool. Danish forces were not involved in war outside their frontiers until the 1999 NATO bombing of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. It became clear that, against the might of Germany, Denmark could not assert her survival with her own arms; this played a crucial role in the \\"adjustment policy\\" and later \\"Cooperation policy\\" during the Nazi-German occupation in World War II. From a Danish perspective, perhaps the most grievous consequence of the defeat was that thousands of Danes living in the ceded lands were conscripted into the German army in World War I and suffered huge casualties on the Western Front. This is still (but waning in time as the children of the conscripted men are dying out) a cause of resentment among many families in the southern parts of Jutland and the direct reason why a German offer of a joint centenary anniversary in 1966 was rejected. After Germany's defeat in 1918, the Danish government asked the Allied Powers and the Versailles Conference of 1919 to include a plebiscite in the disputed Schleswig region based on Woodrow Wilson's Fourteen Points as part of the Allied Powers' peace settlement with Germany, and this request was granted by the Allies. As a result of the plebiscite, North Schleswig was returned to Denmark. =Effects on humanitarian aid= The Infirmary Flag (Ambulanceflaget), adopted in 1850 and replaced in 1870 by the Red Cross. The Second Schleswig War was the first war to be fought after the establishment of the Red Cross movement in 1863. Both Denmark and Prussia had already established national Red Cross societies, and the International Committee of the Red Cross sent observers to evaluate their work. Both Red Cross societies established hospitals and provided impartial care to wounded soldiers, and were covered in newspapers internationally. The war drew attention to the nascent Red Cross movement and drew volunteers to the movement. In popular culture Danish author Herman Bang wrote about the war and its effects on the island of Als in his novel Tine, published in 1889. The book has been translated into many languages, including English, and is considered to be an example of an impressionist novel. In his novel The Riddle of the Sands (1903), Irish novelist Erskine Childers refers to the Dybb√∏l, when protagonists Davies and Carruthers encounter the (then present) German victory monument during a stop at S√∏nderborg on their Baltic yachting expedition. In the M. R. James short story \\"Nr. 13\\" references are made to the war. \\"Is this,\\" he said, \\"the Danish courage I have heard so much of? It isn't a German in there; and if it was, we are five to one.\\" The 2014 Danish TV series 1864 depicts the Second Schleswig War. The protagonist of the movie The Salvation is a veteran of the Second Schleswig War, who emigrates to America.

It is located on the Go≈Çdapa River, between the Szeskie Hills (Szeski Garb, Seesker H√∂hen) and the Puszcza Romincka forest. It has a population of 15,600 (). History =Beginnings= Masurians began to settle the region in the 16th century while it was part of the Duchy of Prussia, a fief of the Kingdom of Poland. Systematic settlement began in 1565, while the town was officially founded by Caspar von Nostitz on May 15, 1570. Located at a profitable location on the crossing of several trade routes near the Prussian border with Lithuania, Go≈Çdap grew rapidly. Its coat of arms depicts the House of Hohenzollern and Brandenburg, while the letter \\"S\\" stands for Sigismund II Augustus, King of Poland, who was the suzerain of the region. In 1656, during the Polish-Swedish War, Polish troops under command of Dymitr Jerzy Wi≈õniowiecki were stationed in Go≈Çdap.Tomasz Darmochwa≈Ç, Marek Jacek Rumi≈Ñski, Warmia Mazury. Przewodnik, Agencja TD, Bia≈Çystok, 1996. , p. 210-212 =Plague and Resettlement= The town became a part of the Kingdom of Prussia in 1701 and Germany in 1871. Between 1757 and 1762 it was occupied by Russians. From 1709-11 eastern Prussia suffered from a plague. The deceased were replaced by Germans from Brandenburg, Pomerania, Magdeburg, Halberstadt, the Electorate of the Palatinate, and Nassau, as did Swiss and Lithuanians. In 1732 Protestants expelled from Salzburg also resettled the area. In the 19th century Go≈Çdap's population consisted mainly of Poles, Lithuanians and Germans, mostly Protestants. Lutheran services took place in all three languages.S≈Çownik geograficzny Kr√≥lestwa Polskiego i innych kraj√≥w s≈Çowia≈Ñskich, Tom II, Warsaw, 1881, p. 668 In 1831, the Polish pastor's house was burnt down.

In 1818 it became a seat of Landkreis Goldap. In 1879 the town was linked to a railway.  Historical population  In year 1825, the county of Goldap (including the town) had 24911 inhabitants, including (by mother tongue): 17412 (~70%) German, 3940 (~16%) Polish and 3559 (~14%) Lithuanian. =World War I and II= World War I destructions of Go≈Çdap During World War I Goldap was a scene of fierce fighting on the Eastern Front, which passed through the town twice. As a result, it was almost completely destroyed. The town was rebuilt, and soon after the war ended it reached a similar number of inhabitants it had had before. During World War II Goldap was planned by the German staff as one of the strongholds guarding the rest of East Prussia from the Red Army on the Eastern Front. As a result of heavy fighting for the city and the regions directly east of it, in August and September 1944, 90% of the town was yet again destroyed. According to German war-time reports, about 50 civilians were murdered (some raped) by the Red Army on its initial entry into Goldap in October 1944. It was the first town of Nazi Germany to fall. However, in November 1944 the Wehrmacht reconquered Goldap and would be able to keep it until the end of December of the same year. In January, the German positions in far-eastern East Prussia broke down completely. =Post-war Poland= Town hall Former Officers' Mess After the war, the town‚Äîtogether with the southern two-thirds of East Prussia‚Äîwas placed under Polish administration according to the 1945 Potsdam Conference. The remaining German-speaking populace, including Masurians, who had not evacuated were subsequently expelled westward and replaced by Poles. The town, renamed from the German Goldap to the Polish Go≈Çdap, was rebuilt and retained its status as a seat of a powiat. Today the town of Go≈Çdap remains an important centre of local trade and commerce. There are several small food production facilities (milk plant, industrial slaughterhouse, mill) located there, as well as a paper mill and a small tourist equipment works. In addition, it is one of the centres of tourism, with many skiing, swimming, sailing and leisure centres located both in the town and around it.

Headquartered in Austin, Texas, it is a producer of automated test equipment and virtual instrumentation software. Common applications include data acquisition, instrument control and machine vision. In 2016, the company sold products to more than 35,000 companies with revenues of US$1.23 billion.  History  = Founding = In the early 1970s, James Truchard, Jeff Kodosky, and Bill Nowlin, were working at the University of Texas at Austin Applied Research Laboratories. As part of a project conducting research for the U.S. Navy, the men were using early computer technology to collect and analyze data. Frustrated with the inefficient data collection methods they were using, the three decided to create a product that would enable their task to be done more easily. In 1976, working in the garage at Truchard's home, the three founded a new company. They attempted to incorporate under several names, including Longhorn Instruments and Texas Digital, but all were rejected. Finally, they settled on the current name of National Instruments. With a $10,000 loan from Interfirst Bank, the group bought a PDP-11/04 minicomputer and, for their first project, designed and built a GPIB interface for it. Their first sale was the result of a cold call to Kelly Air Force Base in San Antonio, Texas. Because the trio were still employed by the University of Texas, in 1977 they hired their first full-time employee, Kim Harrison-Hosen, who handled orders, billing, and customer inquiries. By the end of the year they had sold three boards, and, to attract more business, the company produced and sent a mailer to 15,000 users of the PDP-11 minicomputer. As sales increased, they were able to move into a real office space in 1978, occupying a office at 9513 Burnet Road in Austin, Texas. = 1980s = At the end of the 1970s, the company booked $400,000 in orders, recording a $60,000 profit. In 1980 Truchard, Kodosky, and Nowlin quit their jobs to devote themselves full-time to National Instruments, and at the end of the year moved the company to a larger office, renting of office space. To assist in generating revenue, the company undertook numerous special projects, working on a fuel-pump credit-card system and a waveform generator for U.S. Navy sonar acoustic testing. By 1981, the company reached the $1 million sales mark, leading them to move to a office in 1982. In 1983 National Instruments reached an organizational milestone, developing their first GPIB board to connect instruments to IBM PCs. With the arrival of the Macintosh computer, however, the company felt ready to take advantage of the new graphical interfaces. Kodosky began a research initiative with the assistance of student researchers at the University of Texas into ways to exploit the new interface. This led to the creation of NI's flagship product, the LabVIEW graphical development platform for the Macintosh computer, which was released in 1986. The software allows engineers and scientists to program graphically, by \\"wiring\\" icons together instead of typing text-based code. By allowing people to use a more intuitive, less-structured development environment, their productivity greatly increased, making LabVIEW quite popular. The following year, a version of LabVIEW, known as LabWindows, was released for the DOS environment. The company had 100 employees by 1986. As part of the company's decision to begin direct sales of its products, NI opened its first international branch, in Tokyo, Japan in 1987. = 1990s = Logo used from 1995 to 2020. After growing their staff enough to take over almost the entire building they were renting, in 1990 NI moved to a new building at 6504 Bridge Point Parkway, which the company purchased in 1991. The building, located along Lake Austin near the Loop 360 Bridge, became known as \\"Silicon Hills = Bridge Point.\\" NI received their first patent for LabVIEW in 1991. Later that year, they introduced Signal Conditioning eXtensions for Instrumentation (SCXI) to expand the signal-processing capabilities of the PC, and, in 1992, LabVIEW was first released for Windows-based PCs and Unix workstations. To further assist their customers, NI also created the National Instruments Alliance Partner program, attracting a worldwide selection of third-party developers, systems integrators, and consultants who could extend the capabilities of the NI hardware and software. With LabVIEW now available to a much larger audience, in 1993 the company reached the milestone of $100 million in annual sales. To attract C/C++ programmers, later that year NI introduced LabWindows/CVI. The following year an industrious employee began experiments with the relatively new World Wide Web and developed natinst.com, the company's very first web page. As the company continued to grow, they began to run out of room in their approximately campus. In 1994, NI broke ground on a new campus, located at a site along North Mopac boulevard in northern Austin. By this time, NI had reached 1000 employees. The new NI campus, which opened in 1998, was designed to be employee-friendly. It contains dedicated \\"play\\" areas, including basketball and volleyball courts, an employee gym, and a campus-wide walking trail. Each of the buildings on the campus are lined with windows and feature an open floor plan, so that the employees seated in cubicles throughout the building are never far from the sun and views of northwest Austin. To maintain the focus on equality among the employees, even \\"Dr. T\\", as the employees call their CEO, sits in an open cubicle and does not have an assigned parking space. Employees had been granted stock in the privately held company as part of their compensation packages. When the company chose to go public in 1995, over 300 current and former employees owned stock. The company is now listed on the NASDAQ exchange as NATI. By the late 1990s, customers had begun using LabVIEW in industrial automation applications. With LabVIEW and the more advanced DAQ boards provided by the company, engineers could now replace expensive, fixed- function, vendor-defined instruments with a custom PC-based system that would acquire, analyze, and present data with added flexibility and a lower cost. With the company's acquisition of Georgetown Systems Lookout software, NI products were further incorporated into applications run on the factory-floor. By 1996, the company had reached $200 million in annual sales, and was named to Forbes magazine's 200 Best Small Companies list. Over the next several years, the engineers at NI continued to stretch the boundaries of virtual instrumentation, releasing machine vision software and hardware, which allow cameras to act as sensors, and motion control hardware and software. NI also introduced the CompactPCI-based PXI, an open industry standard for modular measurement and automation, and NI TestStand, which provides for tracking high-volume manufacturing tests. = 2000s = User traffic and e-commerce rapidly improved after the company acquired the ni.com domain and began investing in web technologies to better highlight their products. The company quickly introduced online configuration tools to help customers decide which NI products would best interact to solve their problem, and introduced NI Developer Zone, which provides the end-user developers access to example programs, sample code, and development tips, as well as forums in which users and NI employees could help answer questions about the products. In the 2000s, NI began exporting most of its manufacturing overseas by first opening its first international manufacturing plant in Debrecen, Hungary. This plant helped to diversify the company's manufacturing capabilities, which had been centered at company headquarters in Austin. NI now manufactures nearly 90% of its production in Debrecen and has expanded several times in the last decade. In 2011, with a multimillion-dollar grant from the government, NI increased production in Debrecen by approximately 20%. With state-of-the-art automation processes, headcount increased by only 2%.http://www.bbj.hu/business/national- instruments-celebrates-ten-years-in-hungary_60703 In 2002, the company dedicated the Building C on their Mopac campus, which became the headquarters for the company's R&D; operations. Upon completion of this building, the NI campus finally had enough capacity to move all Austin-based employees to a single location. Following the company model of selling directly to customers, by 2006 NI had opened 21 sales offices in Europe and 12 offices in the Asia/Pacific region, as well as a multitude of offices in the Americas, Africa, and the Middle East. Research and Development centers are located in the U.S., Germany, India, Romania, China, Canada, and Malaysia. =2010s= In January 2013, National Instruments acquired all outstanding shares of Digilent Inc., which became a wholly owned subsidiary. Digilent was founded in 2000 by two Washington State University electrical engineering professors, Clint Cole and Gene Apperson and grew to become a multinational corporation in the engineering education sector, with sales of test and development products to thousands of universities. Digilent developed the open standard Pmod Interface. =2020s= On June 16, 2020, National Instruments announced that they were officially changing the company's name to NI.

Interactive Image Technologies was founded in Toronto, Ontario, Canada by Joe Koenig, and specialized in producing educational movies and documentaries. When the government of Ontario needed an educational tool for teaching electronics in colleges, the company created a circuit simulator called Electronics Workbench. In 1996, Interactive Image Technologies appointed its vice president Roy Bryant to Chief Operating Officer to oversee day-to-day operations of the company and to grow the companies Electronic Design Automation (EDA) products. Bryant is credited with \\"overseeing the development and marketing of the company's Electronics Workbench EDA product\\" . By 1999, Electronics Workbench was the most popular EDA in the world. In 1998 the company started a strategic partnership with another electronic design automation company named Ultimate Technology from Naarden, Netherlands who was the European market leader in printed circuit board design software, with their package ULTIboard. Like Electronics Workbench, founder James Post had focused heavily on the educational market and gained PR fame when he organized the distribution of 180,000 demo floppy disks via electronics magazines in Europe. In 1999 the companies merged, and renamed itself after its most well known product, Electronics Workbench. The then current product line consisted of schematic capture and a simulation product named MultiSIM and the printed circuit board software called Ultiboard. Soon thereafter the combined product suite became worldwide leader in PC based computer-aided design. In 2005 the company was acquired by National Instruments, and rebranded as National Instruments Electronics Workbench Group.  Community  Beginning in 1995, National Instruments has held an annual developer conference in Austin, NIWeek. Engineers and scientists from around the world attend the week-long conference at the Austin Convention Center. Activities center on technical sessions on the company's products as well as the underlying technologies, presented both by NI employees and external presenters. An exhibition hall allows selected industry integrators and suppliers to showcase their products, and various customers or university students also present papers on their work with NI tools.

Al-Qassam studied at Al-Azhar University in Egypt and afterward became an Islamic revivalist preacher in his hometown of Jableh in Syria during the last years of Ottoman rule. Following his return, he became an active supporter of the Libyan resistance to Italian rule, raising funds and fighters to aid the Libyans and penning an anthem for them. He would later lead his own group of rebels in alliance with Ibrahim Hananu to fight against French Mandatory forces in northern Syria in 1919‚Äì20. Following the rebels' defeat, he immigrated to Palestine,Bloomfield, 2010, p. 149.Fleischmann, 2003, p. 292.Kayyali, 1978, p. 180.Lozowick, 2004, p. 78. where he became a Muslim waqf (religious endowments) official and grew incensed at the plight of Palestinian Arab peasants. In the 1930s, he formed bands of local fighters and launched attacks against British and Jewish targets. He was eventually killed in a manhunt following his alleged role in the killing of a British policeman. Israeli historian Tom Segev has called him 'the Arab Joseph Trumpeldor'.Segev, 2001, pp. 362‚Äì363. His campaign and death were factors that led to the 1936‚Äì39 Arab revolt in Palestine. Early life and Muslim scholarship Al-Qassam was born in Jableh Al-Azhar Mosque, where al-Qassam studied, in 1906 Al-Qassam was born in Jableh, northwestern Syria, to father Abd al-Qadar, a Sharia court official during Ottoman rule and a local leader of the Qadariyya Sufi order. His grandfather had been a leading sheikh of the Qadariyya order and moved to Jableh from Iraq. Al-Qassam also followed the Hanafi fiqh (school of jurisprudence) of Sunni Islam and studied at the local Istambuli Mosque under the teaching of well-known ‚Ä≤alim (scholar) Sheikh Salim Tayarah.Schleifer, ed. Burke, 1993, p. 166. Sometime between 1902 and 1905, al-Qassam left for Cairo to study at the al-Azhar Mosque. Who he studied with is disputed by sources; some accounts say he studied under the Muslim reformist scholar Muhammad Abduh and came into contact with the prominent proto-Salafist, Rashid Rida, who himself studied under Abduh, while others are skeptical of al-Qassam's relationships with either. However, the attitude al-Qassam later adopted toward the political issues in the Arab world suggests he was well-acquainted with the ideas Abduh and Rida espoused.Milton-Edwards, 1999, p. 14. At al- Azhar, al-Qassam developed the thinking that would guide his future activism. Critical of a stagnant Islam, he preached among the ranks of farmers and other locals about the necessity for a modern Islam, one capable of defending itself from Western colonialism through jihad (holy struggle).Milton-Edwards, 1999, p. 17. He returned to Jableh in 1909 as an ‚Ä≤alim and worked as a teacher at a Qadariyya madrasa (Islamic school) where he taught both the mystical practices of the Qadariyya Sufi order and the jurisprudence and commentary of the Qur'an. In addition he preached as the imam of the Ibrahim Ibn Adham Mosque.Schleifer, ed. Burke, 1993, p. 167. Following his return to Jableh, al- Qassam commenced a program of Islamic revival based on moral reforms which included the encouragement of maintaining regular salaah (prayer) and the sawm (fasting) during Ramadan as well as advocating an end to gambling and alcohol consumption. Al-Qassam's campaign highly influenced Jableh's residents who increasingly adopted his reforms. He developed amiable relations with the local Ottoman police who he would call upon to enforce Sharia law on rare cases of major violations. In some occasions, he would send disciples as vigilantes to intercept caravans transporting alcohol which would then be disposed of. Despite the support for Arab nationalism from some of his fellow alumni at al-Azhar and among Syrian notables, al-Qassam's loyalties most likely laid with the Ottoman Empire as his relationship with the authorities would indicate.Schleifer, ed. Burke, 1993, p. 168. He was well-regarded among much of Jableh's population where he gained a reputation for piety, simple manners and good humor. Support for Libyan resistance Following Italy's September 1911 invasion of Libya, al-Qassam began collecting funds in Jableh for the joint Ottoman-Libyan resistance movement and composed a victory anthem. Jableh's district governor sought to gain control over the fundraiser and when locals nevertheless continued to send their donations to al-Qassam, he attempted to have him jailed. The district governor alleged that al-Qassam was working against the Ottoman state, but an official investigation found him not guilty and the governor was consequently dismissed. In June 1912, during one of his Friday prayer sermons, he called for volunteers to engage in a jihad against the Italians. Accepting only volunteers with prior Ottoman military training, al-Qassam enlisted dozens of volunteers and set up a fund for the expedition to Libya as well as a small pension for the families of volunteers while they were abroad. Although accounts vary, al-Qassam was accompanied by 60 to 250 volunteers known as mujahideen (those who engage in jihad) when he arrived in Alexandretta in the latter part of that year. Intending to gain sea transportation from the Ottomans, al-Qassam's request was rejected by the authorities who ordered him and his men back to Jableh. A new Ottoman government in Istanbul had gained power and shifted the state's focus to the Balkan front in October, abandoning the Libyan resistance. Part of the money that was raised was then used to establish a madrasa in Jableh while the remainder was saved for future efforts.Schleifer, ed. Burke, 1993, p. 169. Anti-French resistance in Syria The French Army occupying the Syrian coast, 1920 He later enlisted in the Ottoman army when World War I broke out, where he received military training and was attached as a chaplain to a base near Damascus.Segev, 1999, pp.360‚Äì362 Returning to Jableh before the war's end, al-Qassam used funds from his planned expedition to Libya to organize a local defense force to fight the French occupation. His principal role in the local resistance was financing the acquisition of weapons for Jableh's militia. By 1919, French forces moved into the coastal area of northern Syria while Faisal I established the Kingdom of Syria in Damascus as an independent Arab state. During this period, al-Qassam's Jableh militia fought against local French-backed Alawite militiamen who occupied areas around the city. The Alawites were eventually repelled, but French forces moved in soon after to consolidate their control. Consequently, al-Qassam and many of his disciples left Jableh for Mount Sahyun where he established a base near the village of Zanqufeh to launch guerrilla raids against the French Army. Al-Qassam's militia grew when it was joined by another militia based in the mountains following the death of its commander Umar al-Bitar. However, as the French tightened their control of the area, they were able to successfully pressure several of Jableh's major landowners to drop their financial support for al-Qassam and pay taxes to the French Mandate government. This further isolated al-Qassam who decided to flee Mount Sahyun for Aleppo in May 1920. There he and his fighters joined ranks with Ibrahim Hananu who was leading attacks against the French Army until the latter captured Jisr ash-Shugur in July. As a result of this French victory and the impending capitulation of Aleppo, al-Qassam and members of his unit fled past French Army lines with forged passports to Tartus.Schleifer, ed. Burke, 1993, p. 170. Activism in Palestine =Establishment in Haifa= From Tartus, al-Qassam travelled to Beirut by boat and then to Haifa, then under the British Mandate, where his wife and daughters later joined him. During the early 1920s, al-Qassam taught at the Madrasa Islamiya, an Islamic educational institution with many schools in Haifa and its periphery. It was funded by the Jamiat Islamiya, a waqf (religious endowments) administered by prominent Muslims from the city. Unlike other Muslim scholars, al-Qassam made himself easily accessible to the public and often arrived late to teach his classes because he was frequently stopped by passersby for advice. He resigned from his teaching career due to the school's insistence that he maintain consistent hours.Schleifer, ed. Burke, 1993, p. 171. As part of his Islamic revivalist teaching, he denounced and discouraged some local Palestinian traditions, including unorthodox funeral rituals, mothers' visitation to the al-Khidr shrine on nearby Mount Carmel to give thanks for their children's well-being or achievements and tribal dances around religious sites, as superstitious innovations to Islam.Schleifer, ed. Burke, 1993, pp. 170‚Äì171. Al-Qassam concentrated his activities on the lower classes, setting up a night school for casual labourers and preaching to them as an imam, first in the Jerini Mosque, and later in the Istiqlal Mosque. He would seek them out on the streets, in brothels and hashish dens. His greatest following came from the landless ex-tenant farmers drifting into Haifa from the Upper Galilee where purchases of agricultural land by the Jewish National Fund and Hebrew labour policies excluding Arabs had dispossessed many of their traditional livelihoods.Rashid Khalidi, citing Abdullah Schleifer's essay \\"Palestinian Peasant Resistance to Zionism before World War I\\" in Edward Said and Christopher Hitchens (eds.) Blaming the Victims: Spurious Scholarship and the Palestinian Question, Verso, London 2001 ch. 11 pp. 207‚Äì234 p. 229.Rashid Khalidi, Palestinian Identity: The Construction of Modern National Consciousness,Columbia University Press, 2009 p.115. Al-Qassam grew increasingly popular with northern Palestine's poorer Muslims and was frequently sought out to preach at Mawlid celebrations.Schleifer, ed. Burke, 1993, p. 172. In 1929 he was appointed the marriage registrar at the sharia court in Haifa by the Waqf authorities in Jerusalem,Milton-Edwards, 1999, p.16. a role that allowed him to tour the northern villages, whose inhabitants he encouraged to set up agricultural cooperatives. According to the American historian Edmund Burke, al-Qassam was: > An individual deeply imbued with the Islamic social gospel and who was > struck by the plight of Palestinian peasants and migrants. Al-Qassam's > pastoral concern was linked to his moral outrage as a Muslim at the ways in > which the old implicit social compact was being violated in the > circumstances of British mandatory Palestine. This anger fueled a political > radicalism that drove him eventually to take up arms and marks him off from > the Palestinian notable politicians.Schleifer, ed. Burke, 1993, p. 164 He also took advantage of his travels to deliver fiery political and religious sermons in which he encouraged villagers to organise resistance units to attack the British and Jews. He intensified his agitation and obtained a fatwa from Shaykh Badr al-Din al-Taji al-Hasani, the Mufti of Damascus, which ruled that the struggle against the British and the Jews was permissible.Milton- Edwards, 1999, p. 18. =Relationship with local leaders= Leading members of Hizb al-Istiqlal, 1932. Al-Qassam was closely associated with the party, particularly with Rashid al-Hajj Ibrahim, seated second from left According to Israeli historian Shai Lachman, between 1921 and 1935 al-Qassam often cooperated with Hajj Amin al-Husseini, the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem. They were initially on good terms, and al-Qassam's various official appointments required the mufti's prior consent. He suggests their cooperation increased after the 1929 riots, in which one source claims al-Qassam's men were active. The two fell out in the mid-1930s, perhaps due to al-Qassam's independent line of activism.. In 1933, al-Qassam sent an emissary to al-Husseini, requesting the latter's participation in a revolt against the British. At the time, al- Husseini refused, preferring a political solution.Mattar, 1992, p. 67. Between 1928 until his death, al-Qassam served as the president of the Young Men's Muslim Association (YMMA) in Haifa. While he focused his activism with the lower classes, his position in the YMMA afforded him access with the middle and educated classes of the city who were attracted to Hizb al-Istiqlal (Independence Party), an Arab nationalist political party.Schleifer, ed. Burke, 1993, p. 175. In particular, he developed a strong relationship with leading local party member Rashid al-Hajj Ibrahim, the previous president of the Haifa YMMA. A wide ideological gap between the secularist al-Istiqlal and al-Qassam was bridged by a convergence in the view that the struggle against Zionist expansion in Palestine was inseparable from active opposition to British rule. This view separated al-Qassam and al-Istiqlal from the mainstream political forces in Palestine at the time. While men from al- Istiqlal and the YMMA generally refrained from joining al-Qassam's cause, his association with them helped protect him from political figures who opposed his activism.Schleifer, ed. Burke, 1993, p. 176. His activities were also financed by several well-off businessmen associated with al-Istiqlal due to his spreading reputation. =Organisation of armed struggle= In 1930 or 1931,Judis, 2014, p. 108. al-Qassam had recruited numerous hand-picked followers and organised them into about a dozen different circles, each group of supporters unaware of the existence of the other groups. The majority of his men were peasants and urban labourers. The majority of al-Qassam's circles were based in northern Palestine, but he had disciples throughout the country, including in Gaza in the south. In contrast to traditional Palestinian leaders who campaigned against Zionist settlement while avoiding confrontation with the British authorities, al-Qassam saw it as a priority to fight against both. He also saw the brewing conflict in Palestine as a religious struggle, unlike most Palestinian leaders who advocated a secular and nationalist response. Al- Qassam advocated a moral, political and military jihad as the solution to end British rule and Zionist aspirations in Palestine.Schleifer, ed. Burke, 1993 p. 173. In training his men, al-Qassam stressed that maintaining good character was of paramount importance. As such, fighters should provide for the needy, aid people with illness, maintain good ties with their families and pray regularly to God. These virtues, he claimed, were prerequisites to being disciplined and fearless fighters. The moral component of al-Qassam's teachings were especially geared towards the young men of Haifa's labour slums who lived away from their families and who were exposed to activities considered immoral in Islam. He viewed marriage as key to preventing the moral corruption of young men and managed to financially aid his more destitute supporters with their wedding expenses. He encouraged his men to grow beards as a sign of their commitment to jihad and to carry a Qur'an with them wherever they went.Schleifer, ed. Burke, 1993, p. 174. Although many of his followers had been illiterate, he taught them how to read and write using the Qur'an as their basis for learning. Al-Qassam also asked his fighters to engage in the spiritual exercises practiced by the Qadiriyya Sufi order and to recite Sufi chants before battle. The guerrilla bands became known as the Black Hand (al-kaff al-aswad), an anti-Zionist and anti-British militant organisation.Kimmerling and Migdal, 2003, p. 65. The idea for such a group appeared to have crystallised after the 1929 riots. From the outset, a split occurred in the movement. One faction led by Abu Ibrahim al-Kabir argued for immediate attacks against British and Jewish targets, while the other faction, headed by al-Qassam, thought than an armed revolt was premature and risked exposing the group's preparations. According to Subhi Yasin, a comrade of al- Qassam, the group's attacks in the north were executed by Abu Ibrahim's group in defiance of al-Qassam, though in 1969, Abu Ibrahim denied this allegation. The Black Hand's ensuing campaign began with the ambush and killing of three members of Kibbutz Yagur on 11 April 1931, a failed bomb attack on outlying Jewish homes in Haifa in early 1932, and several operations that killed or wounded four members of northern Jewish settlements. The campaign climaxed with the deaths of a Jewish father and son in Nahalal, from a bomb thrown into their home, on 22 December 1932. By 1935, al-Qassam had recruited several hundred men‚Äîthe figures range from 200 to 800‚Äîorganised in cells of five men, and arranged military training for peasants.Beverly Milton-Edwards, 1999, p. 18. The cells were equipped with bombs and firearms, which they used to raid Jewish settlements and sabotage British-built rail lines. Though striking a responsive chord among the rural poor and urban underclass, al-Qassam's movement deeply perturbed the Muslim urban elite as it threatened their political and patronage connections with the British Mandatory authorities.Kimmerling and Migdal, 2003, p. 66. Following the October 1935 discovery of a clandestine cache of arms in the port of Jaffa apparently originating from Belgium and destined for the Haganah, a Jewish paramilitary force,Matthews, 2006, p. 237. Palestinian Arab indignation broke out in two general strikes. The arms shipment to the Haganah served as the final impetus for al-Qassam to launch a revolt against the authorities.Johnson, p. 44. Death Al-Qassam's grave in Balad al-Sheikh, 2010 On 8 November the body of a Palestine Police constable, Moshe Rosenfeld, was discovered near Ein Harod.Laurens, 2002, p. 298. Al-Qassam and his followers were believed to have been responsible and search parties set out to capture him. In this context, al-Qassam and twelve of his men decided to go underground and, leaving Haifa, took to the hills between Jenin and Nablus. There they spent ten days on the move, during which they were fed by the residents of villages in the area. The British police manhunt eventually surrounded al-Qassam in a cave near Ya'bad, in the village of Sheikh Zeid.Milton-Edwards, 1999, p. 19. In the long ensuing firefight, al-Qassam and three of his followers were killed, and five captured on 20 November. The manner of his last stand galvanized Palestinians at the time, according to American historian Abdallah Schleifer: > Surrounded, he told his men to die as martyrs, and opened fire. His defiance > and manner of his death (which stunned the traditional leadership) > electrified the Palestinian people. Thousands forced their way past police > lines at the funeral in Haifa, and the secular Arab nationalist parties > invoked his memory as the symbol of resistance. It was the largest political > gathering ever to assemble in mandatory Palestine. To the surprise of the Palestine Police Force, al-Qassam's funeral, which was held at the Jerini Mosque, attracted at least 3,000 mourners, mostly members of the peasant and working classes. His coffin and those of his slain comrades were draped in the flags of Yemen, Saudi Arabia, and Iraq, the only three independent Arab countries at the time. In reaction to al-Qassam's death, strikes were held in Haifa and several Palestinian and Syrian cities.Moubayed, 2006, p. 392. Al-Qassam is buried at the Muslim cemetery at the former Palestinian village of Balad al-Sheikh, now Nesher, a Jewish suburb of Haifa.Benvenisti, 2000, p. 97. An obituary for al-Qassam was published in the Egyptian newspaper Al-Ahram on 22 November, eulogizing him as a \\"martyr\\" with the following statement: \\"I heard you preaching from up in the pulpit, summoning to the sword ... Through your death you are more eloquent than ever you were in life.\\"Johnson, 2013, p. 45. Legacy Five months following al- Qassam's death, members of his movement, known as \\"Qassamiyun\\" or \\"Qassamites\\", also Ikhwan al-Qassam, (the Brothers of al-Qassam)Mustafa Kabha. \\"The Palestinian Press and the General Strike, April‚ÄìOctober 1936: \\"Filastin\\" as a Case Study.\\" Middle Eastern Studies 39, no. 3 (2003): 169‚Äì89. https://www.jstor.org/stable/4284312. under the leadership of Farhan al-Sa'di, al-Qassam's spiritual heir, shot and killed two Jewish passengers on a bus and shot 3 Jewish drivers, killing 2, in the 1936 Anabta shooting, acts that became major contributing factors in the start of the 1936‚Äì39 Arab revolt in Palestine. Peasant and urban guerrilla factions (fasa'il) led by the Qassamiyun played a significant role in commencing the countrywide revolt. At the start of the revolt, al-Qassam's close disciples al-Sa'di, Abu Ibrahim al- Kabir, and Attiyah Ahmad Awad led fasa'il in the Jenin region, the Upper Galilee and Balad al-Sheikh, respectively. Al-Qassam, according to Palestinian-American Rashid Khalidi, > played a crucial role in winning the populace away from the elite-brokered > politics of compromise with the British, and in showing them the \\"correct\\" > path of popular armed struggle against the British and the Zionists.Rashid > Khalidi, Palestinian Identity: The Construction of Modern National > Consciousness, p. 195. The first Israeli prime minister, David Ben-Gurion, compared the glory that al-Qassam's actions aroused in the 1930s to the fame won in Zionist discourse by Zionist activist Joseph Trumpeldor who died in a battle with Arab forces. Recalling this, Israeli historian Tom Segev has argued that \\"The terrorists that al-Qassam led and the intifada fighters, more recently, may also be likened to the terrorists that Menachem Begin led.\\"Tom Segev, \\"Back to school: Ben-Gurion for beginners,\\" Haaretz, 22 June 2012. Although al-Qassam's revolt was unsuccessful in his lifetime, militant organizations gained inspiration from his example. His funeral drew thousands, which turned into a mass demonstration of national unity. The Palestinian fedayeen who emerged in the 1960s saw al-Qassam as their originator. The founders of the Palestinian nationalist armed movement Fatah had initially considered naming their group the \\"Qassamiyun\\". Leila Khaled, a well-known member of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, once stated that her organization began \\"where al-Qassam left off: his generation started the revolution, my generation intends to finish it.\\"Swedenberg, p. 105. The military wing of the Palestinian Islamist armed movement Hamas, the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades, bears his name as does the Qassam rocket, a short-range rocket the group produces and uses.

Such a system is described by a set of parameters subject to differential constraints, such that when the system evolves along a path in its parameter space (the parameters varying continuously in values) but finally returns to the original set of parameter values at the start of the path, the system itself may not have returned to its original state. Details More precisely, a nonholonomic system, also called an anholonomic system, is one in which there is a continuous closed circuit of the governing parameters, by which the system may be transformed from any given state to any other state. Because the final state of the system depends on the intermediate values of its trajectory through parameter space, the system cannot be represented by a conservative potential function as can, for example, the inverse square law of the gravitational force. This latter is an example of a holonomic system: path integrals in the system depend only upon the initial and final states of the system (positions in the potential), completely independent of the trajectory of transition between those states. The system is therefore said to be integrable, while the nonholonomic system is said to be nonintegrable. When a path integral is computed in a nonholonomic system, the value represents a deviation within some range of admissible values and this deviation is said to be an anholonomy produced by the specific path under consideration. This term was introduced by Heinrich Hertz in 1894. The general character of anholonomic systems is that of implicitly dependent parameters. If the implicit dependency can be removed, for example by raising the dimension of the space, thereby adding at least one additional parameter, the system is not truly nonholonomic, but is simply incompletely modeled by the lower-dimensional space. In contrast, if the system intrinsically cannot be represented by independent coordinates (parameters), then it is truly an anholonomic system. Some authors make much of this by creating a distinction between so-called internal and external states of the system, but in truth, all parameters are necessary to characterize the system, be they representative of \\"internal\\" or \\"external\\" processes, so the distinction is in fact artificial. However, there is a very real and irreconcilable difference between physical systems that obey conservation principles and those that do not. In the case of parallel transport on a sphere, the distinction is clear: a Riemannian manifold has a metric fundamentally distinct from that of a Euclidean space. For parallel transport on a sphere, the implicit dependence is intrinsic to the non- euclidean metric. The surface of a sphere is a two-dimensional space. By raising the dimension, we can more clearly see the nature of the metric, but it is still fundamentally a two-dimensional space with parameters irretrievably entwined in dependency by the Riemannian metric. History N. M. Ferrers first suggested to extend the equations of motion with nonholonomic constraints in 1871. He introduced the expressions for Cartesian velocities in terms of generalized velocities. In 1877, E. Routh wrote the equations with the Lagrange multipliers. In the third edition of his book for linear non- holonomic constraints of rigid bodies, he introduced the form with multipliers, which is now called the Lagrange equations of the second kind with multipliers. The terms the holonomic and nonholonomic systems were introduced by Heinrich Hertz in 1894. In 1897, S. A. Chaplygin first suggested to form the equations of motion without Lagrange multipliers. Under certain linear constraints, he introduced on the left-hand side of the equations of motion a group of extra terms of the Lagrange-operator type. The remaining extra terms characterise the nonholonomicity of system and they become zero when the given constrains are integrable. In 1901 P. V.Voronets generalised Chaplygin's work to the cases of noncyclic holonomic coordinates and of nonstationary constraints. Constraints Consider a system of N particles with positions \\\\mathbf r_i for i\\\\in\\\\\\\\{1,\\\\ldots,N\\\\\\\\} with respect to a given reference frame. In classical mechanics, any constraint that is not expressible as :f(\\\\mathbf r_1, \\\\mathbf r_2, \\\\mathbf r_3, \\\\ldots, t)=0, is a non-holonomic constraint. In other words, a nonholonomic constraint is nonintegrable and has the form :\\\\sum_{i=1}^n a_{s,i} \\\\, dq_i + a_{s,t} \\\\, dt = 0~~~~(s = 1, 2, \\\\ldots, k) ::n is the number of coordinates. ::k is the number of constraint equations. ::q_i are coordinates. ::a_{s,i} are coefficients. In order for the above form to be nonholonomic, it is also required that the left hand side neither be a total differential nor be able to be converted into one, perhaps via an integrating factor. For virtual displacements only, the differential form of the constraint is :\\\\sum_{i=1}^n a_{s,i} \\\\delta q_i = 0~~~~(s = 1, 2, \\\\ldots, k). It is not necessary for all non-holonomic constraints to take this form, in fact it may involve higher derivatives or inequalities. A classical example of an inequality constraint is that of a particle placed on the surface of a sphere: :r^2-a^2\\\\geq0. ::r is the distance of the particle from the centre of the sphere. ::a is the radius of the sphere. Examples =Rolling wheel= Consider the wheel of a bicycle that is parked in a certain place (on the ground). Initially the inflation valve is at one position. If the bicycle is ridden around, and then parked in exactly the same place, the valve will almost certainly not be in the same position as before, and its new position depends on the path taken. =Rolling sphere= This example is an extension of the 'rolling wheel' problem considered above, with a more mathematical treatment. Consider a three-dimensional orthogonal Cartesian coordinate frame, for example, a level table top with a point marked on it for the origin, and the x and y axes laid out with pencil lines. Take a sphere of unit radius, for example, a ping-pong ball, and mark one point B in blue. Corresponding to this point is a diameter of the sphere, and the plane orthogonal to this diameter positioned at the center C of the sphere defines a great circle called the equator associated with point B. On this equator, select another point R and mark it in red. Position the sphere on the z = 0 plane such that the point B is coincident with the origin, C is located at x = 0, y = 0, z = 1, and R is located at x = 1, y = 0, and z = 1, i.e. R extends in the direction of the positive x axis. This is the initial or reference orientation of the sphere. The sphere may now be rolled along any continuous closed path in the z = 0 plane, not necessarily a simply connected path, in such a way that it neither slips nor twists, so that C returns to x = 0, y = 0, z = 1\\\\. In general, point B is no longer coincident with the origin, and point R no longer extends along the positive x axis. In fact, by selection of a suitable path, the sphere may be re-oriented from the initial orientation to any possible orientation of the sphere with C located at x = 0, y = 0, z = 1.The Nonholonomy of the Rolling Sphere, Brody Dylan Johnson, The American Mathematical Monthly, June‚ÄìJuly 2007, vol. 114, pp. 500‚Äì508. The system is therefore nonholonomic. The anholonomy may be represented by the doubly unique quaternion (q and ‚àíq) which, when applied to the points that represent the sphere, carries points B and R to their new positions. =Foucault pendulum= The classic example of a nonholonomic system is the Foucault pendulum. In the local coordinate frame the pendulum is swinging in a vertical plane with a particular orientation with respect to geographic north at the outset of the path. The implicit trajectory of the system is the line of latitude on the Earth where the pendulum is located. Even though the pendulum is stationary in the Earth frame, it is moving in a frame referred to the Sun and rotating in synchrony with the Earth's rate of revolution, so that the only apparent motion of the pendulum plane is that caused by the rotation of the Earth. This latter frame is considered to be an inertial reference frame, although it too is non-inertial in more subtle ways. The Earth frame is well known to be non- inertial, a fact made perceivable by the apparent presence of centrifugal forces and Coriolis forces. Motion along the line of latitude is parameterized by the passage of time, and the Foucault pendulum's plane of oscillation appears to rotate about the local vertical axis as time passes. The angle of rotation of this plane at a time t with respect to the initial orientation is the anholonomy of the system. The anholonomy induced by a complete circuit of latitude is proportional to the solid angle subtended by that circle of latitude. The path need not be constrained to latitude circles. For example, the pendulum might be mounted in an airplane. The anholonomy is still proportional to the solid angle subtended by the path, which may now be quite irregular. The Foucault pendulum is a physical example of parallel transport. =Linear polarized light in an optical fiber= Take a length of optical fiber, say three meters, and lay it out in an absolutely straight line. When a vertically polarized beam is introduced at one end, it emerges from the other end, still polarized in the vertical direction. Mark the top of the fiber with a stripe, corresponding with the orientation of the vertical polarization. Now, coil the fiber tightly around a cylinder ten centimeters in diameter. The path of the fiber now describes a helix which, like the circle, has constant curvature. The helix also has the interesting property of having constant torsion. As such the result is a gradual rotation of the fiber about the fiber's axis as the fiber's centerline progresses along the helix. Correspondingly, the stripe also twists about the axis of the helix. When linearly polarized light is again introduced at one end, with the orientation of the polarization aligned with the stripe, it will, in general, emerge as linear polarized light aligned not with the stripe, but at some fixed angle to the stripe, dependent upon the length of the fiber, and the pitch and radius of the helix. This system is also nonholonomic, for we can easily coil the fiber down in a second helix and align the ends, returning the light to its point of origin. The anholonomy is therefore represented by the deviation of the angle of polarization with each circuit of the fiber. By suitable adjustment of the parameters, it is clear that any possible angular state can be produced. =Robotics= In robotics, nonholonomic has been particularly studied in the scope of motion planning and feedback linearization for mobile robots.Robot Motion Planning and Control, Jean-Paul Laumond (Ed.), 1998, Lecture Notes in Control and Information Sciences, Volume 229, Springer, .

It originally derives from the rule dating from the mid-6th century AD in Benedictine monasteries, that the usual evening meal was to be followed by the reading of excerpts from _Collationes_ patrum in Scetica eremoLit. 'Conferences with the fathers of Scetis in the desert'), usually translated as Conferences with the Desert Fathers,) written by John Cassian in around 420. However, according to the strict Rule of Saint Benedict, on days of fasting there would be no evening meal: Vespers was directly followed by the readings from the Collationes or the Lives of the Fathers, and then Compline. By the 9th century AD the strict rules about fasting in Western Christianity became more relaxed, following the lead of e.g. Thomas Aquinas, and it became allowed to have a light evening snack or 'collation' on fast days.\\"Lent\\", Catholic Encyclopedia. Retrieved 9 March 2019 This grew to apply to the indulgence of two small meals allowed on days of fasting, with or without abstinence.\\"Lent\\", Catholic Encyclopedia Historically, an evening collation was leniently defined by the Catholic Church as being less than eight ounces of food, and even a single \\"hearty meal\\" at lunchtime is allowed when fasting. The traditional Black Fast of Western Christianity, which was broken after sunset, did not permit a collation if strictly observed. After the 14th century AD, taking a collation became a part of Christian fasting practices in many localities. Today, on Christian fasting days of Lent (Ash Wednesday and Good Friday), the Catholic Church prescribes \\"one full meal, as well as two smaller meals that together are not equal to a full meal\\". Similarly, an Evangelical Lutheran publication delineating fasting guidelines states that \\"On fasting days, two ¬º meals are eaten, and one regular meal in the evening\\". The Traditional Saint Augustine's Prayer Book: A Book of Devotion for Members of the Anglican Communion defines \\"Fasting, usually meaning not more than a light breakfast, one full meal, and one half meal, on the forty days of Lent.\\" Other uses The French court of Louis XIV used the term collation to refer to light meals in general. In British English today, a collation is likewise a light meal, offered to guests when there is insufficient time for fuller entertainment. It is often rendered cold collation in reference to the usual lack of hot or cooked food. The Polish word kolacja (\\"supper\\") is a derivation. In modern Italian, the two small meals are the prima colazione (breakfast) and seconda colazione (lunch). The word \\"colazione\\" itself in the general language now means \\"breakfast\\" (whereas the English \\"break their fast\\" for breakfast; lunch is pranzo in Italian).

The garments are commonly referred to as a \\"pair of overalls\\" by analogy with \\"pair of trousers\\". Overalls were originally made of denim, but they can also be made of corduroy or chino cloth. Overalls were invented in the 1890s by Levi Strauss and Jacob W. Davis at Levi Strauss & Co., but they went through an evolution to reach their modern form. Initially only used for protective clothing in work settings, they have become a garment of high fashion as \\"potential cult items\\". railway workers adjusting track.  History  = Beginnings = The exact beginnings of the wearing of overalls are unclear, but they are mentioned in literature as early as 1776 as protective working garments commonly worn by slaves. The first evidence of overalls being mass-produced are those made by Levi Strauss and Jacob Davis in the 1890s. The first \\"jeans\\" they invented were actually overalls (\\"waist overalls\\" or \\"waist-high overalls\\"), consisting of suspenders attached to denim pants with buttons but with no top part with a bib. From the beginning, denim overalls were popular workers' garments due to their durability. In fact, Levi, Strauss & Co.'s slogan in the 1880s-1890s was \\"Never Rip, Never Tear\\". In 1911, Harry David Lee made the first bib overalls, made of pants with pockets with a bib and straps over the shoulders. In 1927, Lee's developed a \\"hookless fastener\\" and created \\"buttonless\\" overalls. Zippers replaced buttons. Soon after, suspender buttons were traded in for belt loops to attach over-the-shoulder straps. = The Overalls Movement of 1920 = In 1920, groups of \\"Overalls Clubs\\" formed around the United States. They took overalls as their symbol to protest the rising cost of clothing, and profiteering in the garment industry. = The Great Depression = In the 1930s, the poorest segments of the American population wore overalls: farmers, miners, loggers, and railroad workers. They were most commonly worn by men and boys in the Southern and Midwestern United States. They can be seen in many of Walker Evans's photographs. =Modern history= Bib overalls (in different colors and textiles) have become popular garments among American youth, from the 1960s onward. Diesel Black Gold Fall/Winter 2010 Collection In the 21st century, overalls have evolved into high-fashion garments. Designers such as Stella McCartney feature them in ready-to-wear collections for men, women, and children. Stella McCartney's children's overalls sell for as much as $138. Nordstrom sells overalls for as much as $1,080.  Brands  Lee's and Levi, Strauss & Co. were not the only companies making overalls in the late 19th and 20th centuries. * One of the oldest brands of overalls, OshKosh B'gosh, founded in 1895 in Wisconsin, specialized in hickory-stripe (blue-and-white stripe) bib overalls. The company produced bib overalls for children in the late 1960s. * Larned, Carter & Co., from Detroit, called themselves the \\"World's Greatest Overall Makers\\". They marketed their products as uniforms for railroad workers. * One of the biggest overall manufacturers was Blue Bell, which began in North Carolina in 1904. It was popular among railroad workers. * Jellico Clothing Manufacturing Co., later renamed Big Ben, was a major competitor of Blue Bell. Big Ben bought Blue Bell in 1926 and continued under the name Blue Bell. Blue Bell then bought the overalls company Casey Jones.  Garments adapted from overalls  Salopettes for a motorcycle rider Shortalls (a contraction of the words \\"short\\" and \\"overalls\\") are overalls adapted so the part of the garment below the waist is shorts. Salopettes is the French word for bib-and-brace overalls. The word is used in English for a similar garment to overalls worn for sailing, skiing, diving, and other heavy- duty activities. They are made of wind-and-waterproof trousers, traditionally with a high waist reaching to the chest and held up by adjustable shoulder braces. Historically, military \\"overalls\\" were loose garments worn in the 18th and early 19th centuries over soldiers' breeches and gaiters when on active service or in barracks. After 1823, the term was replaced by that of \\"trousers\\" in British Army documents, but it survives to the present day in reference to the tight-fitting garments strapped under the instep, worn as part of the mess dress and full dress uniforms of cavalry regiments.

He was the son of the dynasty's founder Chandragupta and the father of its most famous ruler Ashoka. Bindusara's life is not documented as well as the lives of these two emperors: much of the information about him comes from legendary accounts written several hundred years after his death. Bindusara consolidated the empire created by his father. The 16th century Tibetan Buddhist author Taranatha credits his administration with extensive territorial conquests in southern India, but some historians doubt the historical authenticity of this claim.  Background  Ancient and medieval sources have not documented Bindusara's life in detail. Much of the information about him comes from Jain legends focused on Chandragupta and the Buddhist legends focused on Ashoka. The Jain legends, such as Hemachandra's Parishishta-Parvan were written more than a thousand years after his death. Most of the Buddhist legends about Ashoka's early life also appear to have been composed by Buddhist writers who lived several hundred years after Ashoka's death, and are of little historical value. While these legends can be used to make several inferences about Bindusara's reign, they are not entirely reliable because of the close association between Ashoka and Buddhism. Buddhist sources that provide information about Bindusara include Divyavadana (including Ashokavadana and Pamsupradanavadana), Dipavamsa, Mahavamsa, Vamsatthappakasini (also known as Mahvamsa Tika or \\"Mahavamsa commentary\\"), Samantapasadika, and the 16th century writings of Taranatha. The Jain sources include the 12th century Parishishta-Parvan by Hemachandra and the 19th century Rajavali-Katha by Devachandra. The Hindu Puranas also mention Bindusara in their genealogies of Mauryan rulers. Some Greek sources also mention him by the name \\"Amitrochates\\" or its variations.  Early life  = Parents = Bindusara was born to Chandragupta, the founder of the Mauryan Empire. This is attested by several sources, including the various Puranas and the Mahavamsa. The Dipavamsa, on the other hand, names Bindusara as the son of the king Shushunaga. The prose version of Ashokavadana states that Bindusara was the son of Nanda and a 10th- generation descendant of Bimbisara. Like Dipavamsa, it omits Chandragupta's name altogether. The metrical version of Ashokavadana contains a similar genealogy with some variations. Chandragupta had a marriage alliance with the Seleucids, which has led to speculation that Bindusara's mother might have been Greek or Macedonian. However, there is no evidence of this. According to the 12th century Jain writer Hemachandra's Parishishta-Parvan, the name of Bindusara's mother was Durdhara. = Names = The name \\"Bindusara\\", with slight variations, is attested by the Buddhist texts such as Dipavamsa and Mahavamsa (\\"Bindusaro\\"); the Jain texts such as Parishishta-Parvan; as well as the Hindu texts such as Vishnu Purana (\\"Vindusara\\"). Other Puranas give different names for Chandragupta's successor; these appear to be clerical errors. For example, the various recensions of Bhagavata Purana mention him as Varisara or Varikara. The different versions of Vayu Purana call him Bhadrasara or Nandasara. The Mahabhashya names Chandragupta's successor as Amitra-ghata (Sanskrit for \\"slayer of enemies\\"). The Greek writers Strabo and Athenaeus call him Allitrochades and Amitrochates respectively; these names are probably derived from the Sanskrit title. In addition, Bindusara was given the title Devanampriya (\\"The Beloved of the Gods\\"), which was also applied to his successor Ashoka.\\"According to the Jaina and the Buddhist traditions Chandragupta had many sons and Bindusara was chosen to succeed him. He also had the title 'Devanampriya'. The Greeks call him Amitrachates, the Sanskrit equivalent of Amitragatha\\" The Jain work Rajavali-Katha states that his birth name was Simhasena. Both Buddhist and Jain texts mention a legend about how Bindusara got his name. Both accounts state that Chandragupta's minister Chanakya used to mix small doses of poison in the emperor's food to build his immunity against possible poisoning attempts. One day, Chandragupta, not knowing about the poison, shared his food with his pregnant wife. According to the Buddhist legends (Mahavamsa and Mahavamsa Tikka), the queen was seven days away from delivery at this time. Chanakya arrived just as the queen ate the poisoned morsel. Realizing that she was going to die, he decided to save the unborn child. He cut off the queen's head and cut open her belly with a sword to take out the foetus. Over the next seven days, he placed the foetus in the belly of a goat freshly killed each day. After seven days, Chandragupta's son was \\"born\\". He was named Bindusara, because his body was spotted with drops (\\"bindu\\") of goat's blood. The Jain text Parishishta-Parvan names the queen as Durdhara, and states that Chanakya entered the room the very moment she collapsed. To save the child, he cut open the dead queen's womb and took the baby out. By this time, a drop (\\"bindu\\") of poison had already reached the baby and touched its head. Therefore, Chanakya named him Bindusara, meaning \\"the strength of the drop\\". = Family = The prose version of Ashokavadana names three sons of Bindusara: Sushima, Ashoka and Vigatashoka. The mother of Ashoka and Vigatashoka was a woman named Subhadrangi, the daughter of a Brahmin of the Champa city. When she was born, an astrologer predicted that one of her sons would be a king, and the other a religious man. When she grew up, her father took her to Bindusara's palace in Pataliputra. Bindusara's wives, jealous of her beauty, trained her as the royal barber. Once, when the Emperor was pleased with her hairdressing skills, she expressed her desire to be a queen. Bindusara was initially apprehensive about her low class, but made her the chief queen after learning about her Brahmin descent. The couple had two sons: Ashoka and Vigatashoka. Bindusara did not like Ashoka because his \\"limbs were hard to the touch\\". Another legend in Divyavadana names Ashoka's mother as Janapadakalyani. According to the Vamsatthappakasini (Mahavamsa Tika), the name of Ashoka's mother was Dhamma. The Mahavamsa states that Bindusara had 101 sons from 16 women. The eldest of these was Sumana, and the youngest was Tishya (or Tissa). Ashoka and Tishya were born to the same mother.  Reign  Historian Upinder Singh estimates that Bindusara ascended the throne around 297 BCE. = Territorial conquests = Territorial evolution of Magadha and the Maurya Empire between 600 and 180 BCE, including possible expansion under Bindusara prior to 273 BCE. The 16th century Tibetan Buddhist author Taranatha states that Chanakya, one of Bindusara's \\"great lords\\", destroyed the nobles and kings of 16 towns and made him master of all the territory between the western and the eastern seas (Arabian Sea and the Bay of Bengal). According to some historians, this implies conquest of Deccan by Bindusara, while others believe that this only refers to suppression of revolts. Sailendra Nath Sen notes that the Mauryan empire already extended from the western sea (beside Saurashtra) to the eastern sea (beside Bengal) during Chandragupta's reign. Besides, Ashoka's inscriptions found in southern India do not mention anything about Bindusara's conquest of Deccan (southern India). Based on this, Sen concludes that Bindusara did not extend the Mauryan empire, but managed to retain the territories he inherited from Chandragupta. K. Krishna Reddy, on the other hand, argues that Ashoka's inscriptions would have boasted about his conquest of southern India, had he captured Deccan. Reddy, therefore, believes that the Mauryan empire extended up to Mysore during Bindusara's reign. According to him, the southernmost kingdoms were not a part of the Mauryan empire, but probably acknowledged its suzerainty. Alain Dani√©lou believes that Bindusara inherited an empire that included the Deccan region, and made no territorial additions to the empire. Dani√©lou, however, believes that Bindusara brought the southern territories of the Cheras, the Cholas and the Satyaputras under nominal Mauryan control, although he could not overcome their armies. His theory is based on the fact that the ancient Tamil literature alludes to Vamba Moriyar (Mauryan conquest), although it does not provide any details about the Mauryan expeditions but . According to Dani√©lou, Bindusara's main achievement was organization and consolidation of the empire he inherited from Chandragupta. Ancient tamil poems like the Akana·πâ≈´·πüu and the Na·πü·πüi·πáai tells that the mauryan invasion was repulsed by the tamil kings. = Takshashila revolt = The Mahavamsa suggests that Bindusara appointed his son Ashoka as the viceroy of Ujjayini. Ashokavadana states that Bindusara sent Ashoka to lay siege to Takshashila. The Emperor refused to provide any weapons or chariots for Ashoka's expedition. The devatas (deities) then miraculously brought him soldiers and weapons. When his army reached Takshashila, the residents of the city approached him. They told him that they only opposed Bindusara's oppressive ministers; they had no problem with the Emperor or the prince. Ashoka then entered the city without opposition, and the devatas declared that he would rule the entire earth one day. Shortly before Bindusara's death, there was a second revolt in Takshashila. This time, Sushima was sent to quell the rebellion, but he failed in the task. = Ministers = The Rajavali-Katha states that Chandragupta's prime minister Chanakya accompanied him to the forest for retirement, after handing over the administration to Bindusara. However, the Parishishta-Parvan states that Chanakya continued to be Bindusara's prime minister. It mentions a legend about Chanakya's death: Chanakya asked the emperor to appoint a man named Subandhu as one of his ministers. However, Subandhu wanted to become a higher minister and grew jealous of Chanakya. So, he told Bindusara that Chanakya had cut open the belly of his mother. After confirming the story with the nurses, Bindusara started hating Chanakya. As a result, Chanakya, who was already a very old man by this time, retired and decided to starve himself to death. Meanwhile, Bindusara came to know about the detailed circumstances of his birth, and implored Chanakya to resume his ministerial duties. When Chanakya refused to oblige, the Emperor ordered Subandhu to pacify him. Subandhu, while pretending to appease Chanakya, burned him to death. Shortly after this, Subandhu himself had to retire and become a monk due to Chanakya's curse. Ashokavadana suggests that Bindusara had 500 royal councillors. It names two officials ‚Äì Khallataka and Radhagupta ‚Äì who helped his son Ashoka became the emperor after his death. = Foreign relations = Bindusara maintained friendly diplomatic relations with the Greeks. Deimachos of Plateia was the ambassador of Seleucid emperor Antiochus I at Bindusara's court. Deimachos seems to have written a treatise entitled \\"On Piety\\" (Peri Eusebeias). The 3rd century Greek writer Athenaeus, in his Deipnosophistae, mentions an incident that he learned from Hegesander's writings: Bindusara requested Antiochus to send him sweet wine, dried figs and a sophist. Antiochus replied that he would send the wine and the figs, but the Greek laws forbade him to sell a sophist. Bindusara's request for a sophist probably reflects his intention to learn about the Greek philosophy. Diodorus states that the king of Palibothra (Pataliputra, the Mauryan capital) welcomed a Greek author, Iambulus. This king is usually identified as Bindusara. Pliny states that the Egyptian king Philadelphus sent an envoy named Dionysius to India.India, the Ancient Past, Burjor Avari, p.108-109 According to Sailendra Nath Sen, this appears to have happened during Bindusara's reign.  Religion  The Buddhist texts Samantapasadika and Mahavamsa suggest that Bindusara followed Brahmanism, calling him a \\"Brahmana bhatto\\" (\\"votary of the Brahmanas\\"). According to the Jain sources, Bindusara's father Chandragupta adopted Jainism before his death. However, they are silent on Bindusara's faith, and there is no evidence to show that Bindusara was a Jain. A fragmentary inscription at Sanchi, in the ruins of the 3rd century BCE Temple 40, perhaps refers to Bindusara, which might suggest his connection with the Buddhist order at Sanchi. Some Buddhist texts mention that an Ajivika astrologer or priest at Bindusara's court prophesied the future greatness of the prince Ashoka. The Pamsupradanavadana (part of Divyavadana) names this man as Pingalavatsa. The Vamsatthappakasini (the Mahavamsa commentary) names this man as Janasana, based on a commentary on Majjhima Nikaya. The Divyavadana version states that Pingalavatsa was an Ajivika parivrajaka (wandering teacher). Bindusara asked him to assess the ability of the princes to be the next emperor, as the two watched the princes play. Pingalavatsa recognized Ashoka as the most suitable prince, but did not give a definitive answer to the Emperor, since Ashoka was not Bindusara's favourite son. He, however, told Queen Subhadrangi of Ashoka's future greatness. The Queen requested him to leave the kingdom before the Emperor forced him to provide an answer. Pingalavatsa returned to the court after Bindusara's death. The Mahavamsa commentary states that Janasana (also Jarasona or Jarasana) was the Queen's kulupaga (ascetic of the royal household). He had been born as a python during the period of Kassapa Buddha, and had become very wise after listening to the discussions of the bhikkhus. Based on his observations of the Queen's pregnancy, he prophesied Ashoka's future greatness. He appears to have left the court for unknown reasons. When Ashoka grew up, the Queen told him that Janasana had forecast his greatness. Ashoka then sent a carriage to bring back Janasana, who was residing at an unnamed place far from the capital, Pataliputra. On the way back to Pataliputra, he was converted to Buddhism by one Assagutta. Based on these legends, scholars such as A. L. Basham conclude that Bindusara patronized the Ajivikas.  Death and succession  Historical evidence suggests that Bindusara died in the 270s BCE. According to Upinder Singh, Bindusara died around 273 BCE. Alain Dani√©lou believes that he died around 274 BCE. Sailendra Nath Sen believes that he died around 273-272 BCE, and that his death was followed by a four-year struggle of succession, after which his son Ashoka became the emperor in 269-268 BCE. According to the Mahavamsa, Bindusara reigned for 28 years, while according to the Puranas, he ruled for 25 years. The Buddhist text Manjushri-Mula-Kalpa claims that he ruled for 70 years, which is not historically accurate. All sources agree that Bindusara was succeeded by his son Ashoka, although they provide varying descriptions of the circumstances of this succession. According to the Mahavamsa, Ashoka had been appointed as the viceroy of Ujjain. On hearing about his father's fatal illness, he rushed to the capital, Pataliputra. There, he killed his 99 brothers (leaving only Tishya), and became the new emperor. According to the prose version of Ashokavadana, Bindusara's favourite son Sushima once playfully threw his gauntlet at the prime minister, Khallataka. The minister thought that Sushima was unworthy of being an emperor. Therefore, he approached the 500 royal councillors, and suggested appointing Ashoka as the emperor after Bindusara's death, pointing out that the devatas had predicted his rise as the universal ruler. Sometime later, Bindusara fell sick and decided to hand over the administration to his successor. He asked his ministers to appoint Sushima as the emperor, and Ashoka as the governor of Takshashila. However, by this time, Sushima had been sent to Takshashila, where he was unsuccessfully trying to quell a rebellion. When the Emperor was on his deathbed, the ministers suggested appointing Ashoka as the temporary emperor, and re-appointing Sushima as the emperor after his return from Takshashila. However, Bindusara became angry when he heard this suggestion. Ashoka then declared that if he was meant to be Bindusara's successor, the devatas would appoint him as the emperor. The devatas then miraculously placed the royal crown on his head, while Bindusara died. When Sushima heard this news, he advanced towards Pataliputra to claim the throne. However, he died after being tricked into a pit of burning charcoal by Ashoka's well-wisher Radhagupta. The Rajavali-Katha states that Bindusara retired after handing over the throne to Ashoka.

It was fought in connection with the Russian Civil War during 1918‚Äì1920. The campaign was the struggle of Estonia for its sovereignty in the aftermath of World War I. It resulted in a victory for the newly established state and was concluded in the Treaty of Tartu. Preface In November 1917, upon the disintegration of the Russian Empire, a diet of the Autonomous Governorate of Estonia, the Estonian Provincial Assembly, which had been elected in the spring of that year, proclaimed itself the highest authority in Estonia. Soon thereafter, the Bolsheviks dissolved the Estonian Provincial Assembly and temporarily forced the pro-independence Estonians underground in the capital Tallinn. A few months later, using the interval between the Red Army's retreat and the arrival of the Imperial German Army, the Salvation Committee of the Estonian National Council Maap√§ev issued the Estonian Declaration of Independence in Tallinn on 24 February 1918Estonian Declaration of Independence 24 February 1918 at www.president.ee and formed the Estonian Provisional Government. This first period of independence was extremely short-lived, as the German troops entered Tallinn the following day. The German authorities recognized neither the provisional government nor its claim for Estonia's independence, counting them as a self-styled group usurping sovereign rights of the Baltic nobility. Course of the war After the German Revolution with the capitulation of Imperial Germany, between the 11 and 14 November 1918, the representatives of Germany formally handed over political power to the Estonian Provisional Government. On 16 November the provisional government called for voluntary mobilization and began to organize the Estonian Army, with Konstantin P√§ts as Minister of War, Major General Andres Larka as the chief of staff, and Major General Aleksander T√µnisson as commander of the Estonian Army, initially consisting of one division. =Soviet westward offensive= \\"Brothers, Hurry to Join the Nation's Army!\\" Estonian Army Recruiting poster in 1918 In late November 1918, Soviet forces moved against Estonia. On 28 November 1918, the 6th Red Rifle Division struck the border town of Narva, which marked the beginning of the Estonian War of Independence. The 6th Red Rifle Division attacked with 7,000 infantry, 22 field guns, 111 machine guns, an armored train, two armored vehicles, two airplanes, and the Bogatyr class cruiser Oleg supported by two destroyers. The town was defended by men of the Estonian Defence League (Home Guard) (consisting partly of secondary school students) and Infanterie-Regiment Nr. 405 of the German Army. The Reds captured Narva on 29 November and the Infanterie-Regiment Nr. 405 withdrew westwards. The Soviet 2nd Novgorod Division opened a second front south of Lake Peipus, with 7,000 infantry, 12 field guns, 50 machine guns, two armored trains, and three armored vehicles. Estonian military forces at the time consisted of 2,000 men with light weapons and about 14,500 poorly armed men in the Estonian Defence League. The end of November 1918 saw the formation of the Baltic Battalion, primarily a mounted machine-gun company plus infantry. Estonia's Baltic German minority provided a sizable troop of volunteer militia for the Battalion, which was one of the first fighting units of the Estonian Army, and maintained staunch loyalty to the authority of the Republic. This contrasts with the Baltische Landeswehr in Latvia. The 49th Red Latvian Rifle Regiment took the Valga railway junction on 18 December and the city of Tartu on Christmas Eve. Also on Christmas Eve, the 6th Red Rifle Division captured the Tapa railway junction, advancing to within 34 kilometers of the nation's capital Tallinn. Estonian Bolsheviks declared the Estonian Workers' Commune in Narva. By the end of the year, the 7th Red Army controlled Estonia along the front line 34 kilometers east of Tallinn, west from Tartu and south of Aina≈æi. Colonel Johan Laidoner was appointed Commander in chief of the Estonian armed forces. He recruited 600 officers and 11,000 volunteers by 23 December 1918. Officers of Estonian armoured train nr 1 in December 1918 He reorganized the forces by setting up the 2nd Division in Southern Estonia under the command of Colonel Viktor Puskar, along with commando units, such as the Tartumaa Partisan Battalion and the Kalevi Malev Battalion. The national government obtained foreign assistance. On 5 December, Finland delivered 5,000 rifles and 20 field guns along with ammunition. A British Royal Navy squadron commanded by Rear Admiral Sir Edwyn Alexander- Sinclair arrived at Tallinn on 31 December and delivered 6,500 rifles, 200 machine guns, and two field guns. The squadron captured two Russian destroyers, Spartak and Avtroil, and turned them over to Estonia, which renamed them Vambola and Lennuk. On 2 January, Finnish volunteer units with 2,000 men arrived in Estonia. Three armored trains were built in Tallinn under the command of Captain Anton Irv. =Liberation of Estonian territory= The first celebration of Estonian Independence Day in Tallinn on 24 February 1919 By the beginning of 1919, the Estonian Army had increased its ranks to a total of 13,000 men, with 5,700 on the front-facing 8,000 Soviets.Traksmaa, August: L√ºhike vabaduss√µja ajalugu, page 10. Olion, 1992, The strengthened Estonian Army stopped the 7th Red Army's advance in its tracks between 2 and 5 January 1919 and went on the counter-offensive on 7 January. Tapa was liberated two days later in a campaign highlighted by the implementation of the highly successful \\"soomusrongid\\" (armoured trains). This turn of events was swiftly followed by the liberation of the sizable town of Rakvere on 12 January. In liberating Narva, a 1,000-strong Finnish-Estonian force landed at Utria to the rear of the Soviet 6th Rifle Division on 17 January. In so doing, retreat eastward for the Soviet forces was precluded. The following day Narva was liberated. Consequent to this the northeastern front stabilized along the Narva river. Within 11 days, the 1st Division had advanced 200 km.Traksmaa, August: L√ºhike vabaduss√µja ajalugu, page 98. Olion, 1992, In the southern sphere-of-conflict, Tartu was liberated through the rapid deployment of armored trains and the Tartumaa Partisan Battalion. The 2nd Division continued to advance southwards facing increasing Soviet resistance. In the Battle of Paju, the Tartumaa Partisan Battalion and the Finnish volunteers drove the Latvian Riflemen out of Valga on 31 January. Estonian armoured train in Valga in February 1919 The 7th Red Army was routed outside the boundaries of contemporary Estonia and the battle-front continued outwards into the ancient, historical Estonian settlement area.Estonian War of Independence 1918‚Äì1920. Jyri Kork (Ed.). Esto, Baltimore, 1988 (Reprint from Estonian War of Independence 1918-1920. Historical Committee for the War of Independence, Tallinn, 1938) The second half of February saw the Estonian southward advance capture Salacgrƒ´va and Al≈´ksne. This advance was soon stopped by a Soviet buildup ostensibly for a new expansionist offensive into Estonia. On the first Independence Day of 24 February 1919, the pro-independence Estonian forces on the front consisted of 19,000 men, 70 field guns, and 230 machine guns. Estonia had become the first country to repel the Soviet westward offensive.Traksmaa, August: L√ºhike vabaduss√µja ajalugu, page 115. Olion, 1992, In the second half of February, the Red armies started the new Soviet offensive to capture Estonia. To this end, the Soviets established what was referred to as the new 'Estonian' Red Army. This sizable force consisted upwards of 80,000 conscripts. In positions along the Narva River the Estonian 1st Division and their allied White Russian Northern Corps repelled the 7th Red Army's attacks. The Red Army heavily bombarded Narva, leaving about 2,000 people homeless yet ultimately failed to capture the city. The majority of Soviet forces were concentrated at and along the southern front. The so-called 'Estonian' Red Army captured Al≈´ksne, Setomaa, Vastseliina, and R√§pina parishes by 15 March. Having received reinforcements, the Estonian 2nd Division counterattacked and regained Petseri by 29 March. Subsequently, the 'Estonian' Red Army was pushed behind the Optjok River. On 27 March, the Estonian 3rd Division was deployed along the western flank of the southern front under the command of Major-General Ernst P√µdder. At V√µru, the situation became critical on 22 April when the Red Army approached to within 1.5 km of the town. Heavy fighting continued at the southeastern front up to the first half of May. On 25 April, the Latvian Riflemen captured R≈´jiena, but were soon pushed back by the 3rd Division to Salacgrƒ´va-Seda-Gauja line.Traksmaa, August: L√ºhike vabaduss√µja ajalugu, pages 126-127. Olion, 1992, =Estonian elections and formation of foreign units= Constituent Assembly election in April 1919 On 5‚Äì7 April 1919 the Estonian Constituent Assembly was elected. The elections were won by the Left and Centre parties.Miljan, Toivo: Historical dictionary of Estonia , page 140. Scarecrow Press, 2004, The 120 members of the Constituent Assembly met at the opening session on 23 April and elected Social Democrat August Rei as chairman. The provisional government retired, and a new government headed by Otto Strandman was formed. On 4 June the assembly adopted a temporary Constitution of Estonia.Traksmaa, August: L√ºhike vabaduss√µja ajalugu, page 131. Olion, 1992, On 10 October the Land Reform Act was passed, which confiscated and redistributed the large Baltic German estates that covered more than half of the territory of Estonia.O'Connor, Kevin: The history of the Baltic States, page 88. Greenwood Publishing Group, 2003, Estonia actively helped to organize White Russian, Latvian and Ingrian forces on the territory of the Republic. The White Russian Northern Corps had been organizing in Estonia since December 1918. On 18 February, an agreement was signed between Estonia and Latvia, which allowed formation of Latvian forces under Estonian command but using them only on the southern front. The North Latvian Brigade under the command of Jorƒ£is ZemitƒÅns was formed from the citizens of Latvia who had fled to Estonia.Traksmaa, August: L√ºhike vabaduss√µja ajalugu, pages 137-138. Olion, 1992, In March 1919, an agreement was signed with the Ingrian National People's Committee for the formation of an Ingrian battalion. By May 1919, there were 6,000 Russians, 4,000 Latvians and 700 Ingrians in their respective national units.Traksmaa, August: L√ºhike vabaduss√µja ajalugu, page 11. Olion, 1992, =Offensives into Russia and Latvia= Estonian soldiers near ƒÄrciems in Latvia in May 1919 Although the Estonian Army had attained control over its country, the opposing Red armies were still active. The Estonian High Command decided to push their defense lines across the border into Russia in support of the White Russian Northern Corps. On 13 May, the Northern Corps went on the offensive at Narva, catching the Soviets by surprise and destroying their 6th Division.Traksmaa, August: L√ºhike vabaduss√µja ajalugu, page 141. Olion, 1992, The offensive was supported along the Gulf of Finland's coast by the British and Estonian navy and marines. With the front approaching, the garrison of the Krasnaya Gorka fort mutinied. But the 7th Red Army received reinforcements and counterattacked, pushing the White Russians back, until the front was stabilised with the support from the Estonian 1st Division on the Luga and Saba rivers.Traksmaa, August: L√ºhike vabaduss√µja ajalugu, page 142. Olion, 1992, The offensive of the Estonian Petseri Battle Group began on 24 May. The 600 troops of 1st Estonian Rifle Regiment of the Red Army together with Leonhard Ritt, commander of the 1st Estonian Rifle Division switched side on the same day.Traksmaa, August: L√ºhike vabaduss√µja ajalugu, page 145.

Hoover Press, 2001, Offensive destroyed the Estonian Red Army, captured Pskov on 25 May and cleared the territory between Estonia and the Velikaya River of Soviet forces. A few days later White Russian forces arrived in Pskov, but as they were unable to defend the town on their own, some Estonian forces remained in Pskov, while the rest were pulled back to the state border. The Northern Corps mobilised members of the local population in the Pskov region. On 19 June 1919, the Estonian Commander-in-Chief General Johan Laidoner rescinded his command over the White Russians, and they were renamed the Northwestern Army. Shortly afterwards, General Nikolai N. Yudenich took command of the troops.Traksmaa, August: L√ºhike vabaduss√µja ajalugu, pages 141. Olion, 1992, Estonian army parade in Pskov on 28 May 1919 Simultaneously with the Pskov offensive Estonian 2nd and 3rd divisions also started southward offensive into Northern-Latvia. By end of May they had captured Al≈´ksne and Valmiera. Due simultaneous German-Latvian offensive in Western-Latvia situation was becoming very difficult for the Soviets. On 31 May, an Estonian cavalry regiment led by Gustav Jonson reached Gulbene, capturing large amount of rolling stock, including 2 armoured trains.Traksmaa, August: L√ºhike vabaduss√µja ajalugu, page 147. Olion, 1992, Rapid offensive of 2nd Division, spearheaded by its cavalry regiment, continued and on 6 June it crossed Daugava river and captured Jƒìkabpils.Mangulis, Visvaldis: Latvia in the Wars of the 20th Century , page 50. Cognition Books, 1983, But 3rd Division could not support advance of 2nd division anymore as it was now facing a new enemy: the Baltische Landeswehr. =War against the Landeswehr= Estonian artillery in war against the Landeswehr The war against the Baltische Landeswehr broke out on the southern front in Latvia on 5 June 1919. The Latvian democrats led by KƒÅrlis Ulmanis had declared independence as in Estonia but were soon pushed back to LiepƒÅja by Soviet forces, where the German VI Reserve Corps finally stopped their advance. This German force, led by general R√ºdiger von der Goltz, consisted of the Baltische Landeswehr formed from Baltic Germans, the Guards Reserve Division of former Imperial German Army soldiers who had stayed in Latvia, and the Freikorps Iron Division of volunteers motivated by prospects of acquiring properties in the Baltics. This was possible because the terms of their armistice with the Western Allies obliged the Germans to maintain their armies in the East to counter the Bolshevist threat. The VI Reserve Corps also included the 1st Independent Latvian Battalion led by Oskars Kalpaks, which consisted of ethnic Latvians loyal to the Provisional Government of Latvia. The Germans disrupted the organization of Latvian national forces, and on 16 April 1919 the Provisional Government was toppled and replaced with the pro- German puppet Provisional Government of Latvia led by Andrievs Niedra.Traksmaa, August: L√ºhike vabaduss√µja ajalugu, page 149. Olion, 1992, Liulevicius, Vejas G.: War land on the Eastern Front: culture, national identity and German occupation in World War I, page 231. Cambridge University Press, 2000, Ulmanis took refuge aboard the steamship \\"Saratow\\" under Entente protection. The VI Reserve Corps pushed the Soviets back, capturing Riga on 23 May, continued to advance northwards, and demanded that the Estonian Army ended its occupation of parts of northern Latvia. The real intent of the VI Reserve Corps was to annex Estonia into a German-dominated puppet state. Estonian representatives Karl Parts, Ernst P√µdder, and Nikolai Reek during the negotiations with the Landeswehr On 3 June, Estonian General Laidoner issued an ultimatum demanding that German forces must pull back southwards, leaving the broad gauge railway between Ieriƒ∑i and Gulbene under Estonian control. When Estonian armoured trains moved out on 5 June to check compliance with this demand, the Baltische Landeswehr attacked them, unsuccessfully.Traksmaa, August: L√ºhike vabaduss√µja ajalugu, page 150. Olion, 1992, The following day, the Baltische Landeswehr captured Cƒìsis. On 8 June, an Estonian counterattack was repelled. The first clashes demonstrated that the VI Reserve Corps was stronger and better equipped than the Soviets. On 10 June, with Entente mediation, a ceasefire was made. Despite the Entente demand for the German force to pull behind the line demanded by the Estonians, von der Goltz refused and demanded Estonian withdrawal from Latvia, threatening to continue fighting. On 19 June, fighting resumed with an assault of the Iron Division on positions of the Estonian 3rd Division near Limba≈æi and Straupe, starting the Battle of Cƒìsis. At that time, the 3rd Estonian Division, including the 2nd Latvian Cƒìsis regiment under Colonel Kri≈°jƒÅnis Berƒ∑is, had 5990 infantry and 125 cavalry. Intensive German attacks on Estonian positions continued up to 22 June, without achieving a breakthrough. On 23 June, the Estonian 3rd Division counterattacked, recapturing Cƒìsis. The anniversary of the Battle of Cƒìsis (V√µnnu lahing in Estonian) is celebrated in Estonia as the Victory Day. The Estonian 3rd Division continued their advance towards Riga. On 3 July, when the Estonian forces were at the outskirts of Riga, a ceasefire was made on the demand of the Entente and the Ulmanis government was restored in Riga. The German forces were ordered to leave Latvia, the Baltische Landeswehr was put under the command of the Latvian Provisional Government and sent to fight against the Red Army. However, to circumvent Entente's orders, the troops of the disbanded VI Reserve Corps, instead of leaving, were incorporated into the West Russian Volunteer Army, officially hired by the German puppet Government of Latvia and led by Pavel Bermondt-Avalov. In October, fighting restarted when the West Russian Volunteer Army attacked Riga. Following the Latvian request to help, Estonia sent two armoured trains to aid repelling the German attack. The Estonian army also remained to support the defence of Latvia against Soviets by defending the front north of Lake LubƒÅns.Traksmaa, August: L√ºhike vabaduss√µja ajalugu, page 162. Olion, 1992, =Final battles and peace negotiations= thumbleftThe Estonian Army High Command in 1920 Soviet Russia had been attempting to conclude a peace since the spring of 1919. On 25 April 1919, Hungarian Communists offered to mediate a settlement between the Bolsheviks and the Estonians, but Admiral Cowan threatened withdrawal of support to the Estonians unless they rejected the Hungarian offer. The Russians then publicly broached the subject of peace talks in a radio broadcast on 27 and 28 April. On 5 June the Estonian Commune was abolished. A subsequent broadcast by the Russians on 21 July led to the British journalist Arthur Ransome sounding out the Commissar for Foreign Relations Georgy Chicherin on the subject of peace talks. As a result, the Soviet government made a formal offer for negotiations on 31 August 1919. The Estonians accepted on 4 September, and delegations started talks on 16 September. Estonia then proposed to stop the negotiations until Latvia, Lithuania and Finland have agreed to participate in joint negotiations.Traksmaa, August: L√ºhike vabaduss√µja ajalugu, page 174. Olion, 1992, In the autumn, the Northwestern Army launched operation White Sword, a major effort to capture Petrograd.

The Northwestern Army approached to 16 kilometres (10 miles) from Petrograd, but the Red Army repulsed the White Russian troops back to the Narva River. Distrustful of the White Russians, the Estonian High Command disarmed and interned the remains of the Northwestern Army that retreated behind the state border.Fletcher, William A. The British navy in the Baltic, 1918‚Äì1920: Its contribution to the independence of the Baltic nations, Journal of Baltic Studies, 1976, pp134 - 144 Estonian field battery near Narva in late 1919 The 7th and 15th Soviet Armies advancing behind collapsing White Russian forces continued to attack the fortified positions at the state border near Narva. The first clashes took place on Luga River on 16 November, starting the conclusive battles with 120,000 Soviets facing 40,000 Estonians.Kaevats, √úlo: Eesti Ents√ºklopeedia 10, page 123. Eesti Ents√ºklopeediakirjastus, 1998, After repeated attacks, the 7th Red Army managed to achieve some limited success. At the end of November, the situation on the front calmed, as the Soviets needed to replenish their forces. In order to pressure Estonia in the peace talks, intensive Soviet attacks restarted on 7 December.Traksmaa, August: L√ºhike vabaduss√µja ajalugu, page 200. Olion, 1992, On 16 December, the situation became critical as forward units of the 15th Red Army crossed the Narva River. The next day, an Estonian counterattack pushed the Soviets back. The Estonian high command actively reinforced the 1st Division at Narva during the battles, sending in the headquarters of the 3rd Division. General T√µnisson became commander of the Viru Front. After suffering 35,000 casualties in heavy battles, the Red Army was completely exhausted by the end of December. On 19 November, the new government of Jaan T√µnisson decided to restart talks with Soviet Russia, even without the participation of other Baltic States.Traksmaa, August: L√ºhike vabaduss√µja ajalugu, pages 223‚Äì224. Olion, 1992, Negotiations began on 5 December, with the main point of dispute being territorial issues. Talks continued through December, with both sides pressing their territorial demands, while heavy fighting continued at Narva. The peace treaty was finally concluded on 31 December 1919, and the ceasefire came into effect on 3 January 1920.Georg von Rauch, The Baltic States: The Years of Independence 1917‚Äì1940, Hurst & Co, 1974, p70 Foreign assistance British squadron in Koporye Bay in October 1919 Foreign assistance, mostly from the United Kingdom and Finland, played a very important role during the early stages of war. British naval and air forces arrived in December 1918, after lobbying in London by Estonian politicians. At this time, the new Estonian government was weak and desperate, and the Estonian Prime Minister even asked that his state be declared a British protectorate, but Britain would not meet this plea.Kinvig, p. 138 However, the British squadron delivered 6500 rifles, 200 machine guns, 2 field guns, also two Soviet destroyers were captured near Tallinn and turned over to Estonia. A Royal Navy squadron continued to provide artillery support on the coast and also protected the Estonian flank against the Russian Baltic Fleet. The United Kingdom remained Estonia's main supplier of arms and equipment during the war. While the British navy provided considerable support, the historian William Fletcher concludes that \\"the British naval force would have had little effect on the outcome of Baltic affairs had not the Estonians and Latvians provided a vibrant and disciplined land and sea force\\". The British contributed 88 ships to the Baltic campaign, of which 16 were sunk.Kinvig, p. 289 128 British servicemen died in the campaign, 9 were captured and at least 27 were wounded.Kinvig, p. 289 Finnish volunteers arrive in Tallinn, Estonia in December 1918 Concerned with having Bolshevik rule in the South, Finland delivered funds and weapons. Finland provided 5000 rifles and 20 field guns by 12 December. Finland also sent 3500 volunteers. Pohjan Pojat led by Hans Kalm fought at the Southern Front, including at the Battle of Paju, while I Suomalainen Vapaajoukko led by Martin Ekstr√∂m fought at the Viru Front, including at the Battle of Utria. Finnish volunteers returned to Finland on March‚ÄìApril 1919, having lost 150 men. Danish-Baltic Auxiliary Corps with approximately 200 men was formed under the command of Captain Richard Gustav Borgelin in April 1919. The company took part in battles against Bolsheviks in Latvia and near Pskov and 19 men were killed by the time their contract ended in September. R. G. Borgelin was promoted to Lieutenant Colonel and given Maidla manor in gratitude for his services. The Swedish volunteer unit under the command of Carl Mothander was formed in Sweden in early 1919. In March 1919, 178 volunteers took part in scout missions in Virumaa. In April, the company was sent to the Southern front and took part of the battles near Pechory. In May, the company was disbanded with some volunteers joining other units and the rest returning to Sweden. Tartu Peace Treaty Part of the Estonian delegation at the negotiations of the Treaty of Tartu (left to right): Jaan Poska, Jaan Soots and Victor Mutt. On 2 February 1920, the Peace Treaty of Tartu was signed by the Republic of Estonia and RSFSR. At this point, the Bolshevist regime had not been recognized by any Western power. The terms of the treaty stated that Russia renounced in perpetuity all rights to the territory of Estonia. The agreed frontier corresponded roughly with the position of the front line at the cessation of hostilities. In particular, Estonia retained a strategic strip to the east of the Narva river (Narvataguse) and Setumaa in the southeast, areas which were lost in early 1945 ‚Äì shortly after Soviet troops had taken control of Estonia, when Moscow transferred the land East of the Narva River and most of Petseri County to the RSFSR.

Among his songs, \\"Ti si mi u krvi\\" (from same-named album) is widely considered one of the most popular ballads of ex-Yugoslav music.\\\\- 24sata.hr Otkrivamo vam kako je nastao legendarni hit 'Ti si mi u krvi' Early life Born in Sarajevo, PR Bosnia and Herzegovina, FPR Yugoslavia to Herzegovinian Serb parents, police administrator Vladimir from the Vlahoviƒái village near Ljubinje and homemaker Stana ƒåoliƒá from Trebinje, young ƒåoliƒá showed an early interest in sports. He was active as a football goalkeeper in FK ≈Ωeljezniƒçar's youth system, before switching to track and field, where he also excelled. At one point he ran a 100 meter dash in 11.3 seconds, and continually placed high at various events he entered (at one of them he finished just behind future star Nenad Stekiƒá). ƒåoliƒá gave up on his sports career, feeling he lacked the discipline required to compete on a regular basis. ƒåoliƒá attended Vladimir Periƒá Valter elementary school in the Grbavica neighbourhood where he grew up. He also attended music school where he studied guitar playing. As a hobby, he took part in various school recitals, and also acted in a couple of plays at the Pionirsko pozori≈°te (youth theatre). Early career =Early years= Since the youngest age ƒåoliƒá showed an interest in music. With friend Braco Isoviƒá, he played guitar at informal and impromptu park gatherings through which they became somewhat locally known as \\"ƒåola i Isa sa Grbavice\\". At the time ƒåoliƒá was trying to emulate pop schlager music that dominated Yugoslav and Italian festivals. His first love was Milena Mijatoviƒá from Belgrade. His first significant public singing experience occurred in 1967, when he spent some time at the Montenegrin coast for the Republic Day. Staying in the house his father owned in the coastal community of Bao≈°iƒái, 17-year-old ƒåoliƒá was persuaded by a friend, Nedim Idrizoviƒá, to enter the amateur signing competition in nearby Bijela. He won second prize singing \\"Lady Madonna\\" by The Beatles. Encouraged by this unexpected success, and soon after returning to Sarajevo, ƒåoliƒá entered his first band‚Äîa group called Mladi i lijepi. This engagement didn't last, however, because around the time he graduated high school in 1969; he moved to the more established Ambasadori, a band whose two incarnations he would end up staying with for the next two and a half years. =Ambasadori= At the time of ƒåoliƒá's arrival, Ambasadori employed a strange setup: they were essentially a military cover band as all the musicians, except for bandleader Slobodan Vujoviƒá, were army recruits. Their repertoire centred around 1960s rhythm & blues (Chicago, Otis Redding, Wilson Pickett, etc.) along with obligatory Yugoslav hits of the day and years past, and finally even a few original numbers written by the bandmembers thrown into the mix. Over time, the group started getting more gig offers, which presented a problem since its army part was not available for many of them and those offers had to be declined. Seeing their opportunities limited by the strange situation, Vujoviƒá and ƒåoliƒá decided to step out and form Novi ambasadori in 1970, bringing in drummer Perica Stojanoviƒá, organist Vlado Pravdiƒá, saxophonist Lale Stefanoviƒá, and bassist Zlatko Hold. With the almost all new lineup, the band also expanded its repertoire so that in addition to R&B; they now also played covers of Led Zeppelin, Blood, Sweat & Tears, Creedence Clearwater Revival, etc. In the summer of 1970, Novi ambasadori scored a month-long gig with Indexi in Dubrovnik, which was their first tour-like experience. Next step was competing at the 1971 Va≈° ≈°lager sezone annual festival in Sarajevo where they finished in 7th place with a song \\"Plaƒçem za tvojim usnama\\" that songwriter Zdenko Runjiƒá claimed to have composed and officially signed his name under, despite the fact that it was a blatant rip-off of The Tremeloes' \\"Suddenly You Love Me\\" (which actually is a cover of Riccardo Del Turco's \\"Uno tranquillo\\" ). No one from the festival noticed this plagiarism and the band avoided the controversy. The song was even released on a 7-inch single \\"Plaƒçem za tvojim usnama\\" / \\"Zapjevaj\\" by Beograd Disk and sold surprisingly well. The performance at Va≈° ≈°lager sezone was also significant since it marked the band's first television appearance, exposing them to a much larger audience. One of the people in that TV audience was Kornelije Kovaƒç, an already influential and established figure in Yugoslav music circles, who immediately was intrigued by ƒåoliƒá's \\"clean tenor and good stage presence\\". ƒåoliƒá was soon offered a \\"bench role\\" with Indexi, to fill in for their singer Davorin Popoviƒá, and even performed with them a couple of times. =Korni grupa= In the meantime, during summer of 1971, ƒåoliƒá finally met face to face with Kornelije Kovaƒç who came to see ƒåoliƒá play in Mostar and invited him to join his Korni grupa as replacement to their departed singer Dado Topiƒá. Unlike Amabasadori, Korni grupa performed their own material and generally had a much more studious and serious approach to music, so ƒåoliƒá immediately jumped at the opportunity. On 10 September 1971, twenty-year-old ƒåoliƒá left his hometown and moved to the capital Belgrade in order to join his new band. However, his stint with Korni grupa ultimately proved to be very short and largely unsuccessful as he never meshed well enough with the rest of the group musically, finding it hard to fit into their progressive rock style. He recorded three tracks with them, \\"Kukavica, \\"Gospa Mica gazdarica\\", and \\"Pogledaj u nebo\\", all of which were released on the 7-inch single by PGP RTB. Track \\"Gospa Mica gazdarica\\" managed to create minor controversy due to the slightly risque lyrics written from the perspective of a young man imploring his older female landlord to allow him into her bed‚Äîa nod to ƒåoliƒá's life at the time since he was living away from home in sublet apartments. Due to numerous complaints, the song was taken off radio playlists. Soon, however, ƒåoliƒá and Kovaƒç agreed that it would be better for ƒåoliƒá to go solo. Only six months upon his arrival to Belgrade, he returned to Sarajevo determined to give solo career a try. Solo career =Early activity: Schlager festivals= On 15 April 1972 ƒåoliƒá's first solo move was taking part in the Va≈° ≈°lager sezone competitive festival in Sarajevo. He won the third audience prize as well as the interpretation award with Kemal Monteno written song \\"Sinoƒá nisi bila tu\\" that was originally meant to be sung by Josipa Lisac who opted out at the last moment. Right away, under Kovaƒç's guidance ƒåoliƒá managed to establish a fair amount of prominence as a solo act‚Äîand on 20 May 1972 the two appeared as guests on the very popular TV Belgrade variety show Obraz uz obraz hosted by Milena Draviƒá and Dragan Nikoliƒá. The same year, ƒåoliƒá made further appearances at the Split festival (with song \\"Stara pjesma\\"), Pri≈°tina festival, and Skopje Festival (with song \\"Moj bol\\"), before embarking on a tour of Soviet Union together with Indexi, Bisera Veletanliƒá, Sabahudin Kurt, and Sabina Vare≈°anoviƒá. =Eurovision and more festivals= ƒåoliƒá in Po≈æarevac in 1973. Then came the first big break that launched him on the road to stardom. By winning at the Opatija festival with song \\"Gori vatra\\" written by Kemal Monteno, ƒåoliƒá got to represent SFR Yugoslavia at the 1973 Eurovision Song Contest on 7 April 1973 in Luxembourg. The song placed poorly, but became a well-respected hit at home. Riding the wave of exposure the Eurovision appearance afforded him, ƒåoliƒá continued entering competitive festivals throughout SFR Yugoslavia over the next two years with plenty of success. At Hit parada festival in Belgrade on 23 November 1974, he won with the song \\"Ona spava\\", composed and written by Kornelije Kovaƒç. Next year, 1975, ƒåoliƒá bagged a few more festival wins with Kovaƒç's songs‚ÄîBeogradsko proleƒáe with \\"April u Beogradu\\", and Va≈° ≈°lager sezone with \\"Zvao sam je Emili\\". Other songs he performed at various festivals in those years were \\"Bling blinge blinge bling\\" (1973 Va≈° ≈°lager sezone, composed by Zdenko Runjiƒá), \\"Ljubav je samo rijeƒç\\" (1974 Beogradsko proleƒáe, composed by Vojkan Borisavljeviƒá), and \\"Zelena si rijeka bila\\" (1974 Va≈° ≈°lager sezone, composed by Kemal Monteno). Around the same time he also signed a deal with the German arm of WEA record label and did two singles for that market. German producers were of the opinion that his name was too difficult to pronounce for their consumers so they marketed him as Dravco. Soon, however, ƒåoliƒá decided not to pursue his options in that country further mostly because he was unwilling to move to Germany. =Debut album= His first solo album was Ti i ja (You and I), released in 1975 by Jugoton. Closely overseen by Kornelije Kovaƒç, the album brought ƒåoliƒá more hits like \\"Vagabund\\", \\"Igra≈° se vatrom\\", and \\"Lo≈°e vino\\" (written by Arsen Dediƒá and Goran Bregoviƒá). Cover sleeve was done by Dragan S. Stefanoviƒá, another collaborator who would remain with ƒåoliƒá for years to come. ƒåoliƒá's image especially appealed to girls and women, something that would remain a staple of his entire career. The same year, cashing in on his sudden popularity upswing, PGP RTB released a compilation of his festival singles under the name Zdravko ƒåoliƒá. Despite, achieving great prominence already, ƒåoliƒá continued appearing at the occasional festival such as the Zagreb one in 1976 where he surprisingly finished in fourth place singing \\"Ti si bila, uvijek bila\\". At the end of that year he went on a Yugoslavia-wide tour with Indexi. After the Belgrade concert, the measure of his sudden fame was on public display during autograph-signing at the Jugoton store as the cordon of girls rushed the store, breaking a window glass in attempt to get closer to him. The next year, 1977, he did the festival circuit for the last time, first in Zagreb with \\"≈Ωivi≈° u oblacima\\", followed by an appearance at the Festival of Patriotic Songs also in Zagreb, where he performed . That song was soon released on a 7-inch single record and sold 300,000 copies. =Mass popularity= His second album, Ako priƒëe≈° bli≈æe (If You Come Closer), released later that year, was even more successful, creating mass hysteria among girls for his music. The copies were extremely sought-after, as 50,000 sold in the first two weeks alone. The album contained some of his best known and liked songs such as \\"Glavo luda\\", \\"Zagrli me\\", \\"Juƒçe jo≈°\\", \\"Pjevam danju, pjevam noƒáu\\", \\"Jedna zima sa Kristinom\\", and \\"Produ≈æi dalje\\". On 1 April 1978, he started an ambitious tour of SFR Yugoslavia with Lokice dance group in support of the album that had already sold 150,000 copies. ƒåoliƒá also started to play the guitar occasionally on stage. Putujuƒái zemljotres (Traveling Earthquake Tour) produced and organized by Maksa ƒÜatoviƒá moved all over the country, soon becoming a phenomenon the likes of which the country had not seen before. The scenes of screaming girls rushing the stage were repeated in a city after a city. The tour's climax took place in Belgrade at Red Star FC stadium on 5 September 1978 with 70,000 people in attendance despite the fact that ƒåoliƒá already played two sold-out shows in Belgrade a few months earlier on 4 and 8 April at Hala Pionir. Supporting ƒåoliƒá on stage that night were Chris Nicholls on keyboards and Dado Topiƒá on bass guitar, with old favourites Kornelije Kovaƒç, Arsen Dediƒá, Kemal Monteno, Josip Boƒçek, Trio Strune, and RTV Belgrade singing quintet appearing as guests. ƒåoliƒá and the great tour essentially became a cultural phenomenon transcending musical boundaries such that in the lead-up to the big Belgrade concert journalist Du≈°an Savkoviƒá and film director Jovan Ristiƒá decided to make a movie about ƒåoliƒá. Savkoviƒá wrote a rudimentary screenplay, but the movie ended up being a 90-minute feature documentary titled Pjevam danju, pjevam noƒáu that follows ƒåoliƒá from Belgrade concert onwards and looks back on his career up to that point. Two days after the Belgrade concert, ƒåoliƒá was in his hometown Sarajevo at Ko≈°evo Stadium for the tour's grand finale; however, the rain interrupted much of the concert. By the end of its promotion cycle, the album sold more than 700,000 copies and with later re-releases during the 1990s went over the million mark. ƒåoliƒá also got the attention of Ziggy Loch, director of German WEA, who immediately after watching the Belgrade concert wanted to renew his contract. Singles with songs \\"Jedina\\" and \\"Zagrli me\\" were released for the German market as well as the disco single \\"I'm Not a Robot Man\\" / \\"Light Me\\". However, ƒåoliƒá refused to move to Germany for the second time, and instead on 14 November 1978 went to serve his mandatory Yugoslav Army stint. Twenty seven years of age at the time, ƒåoliƒá was assigned to a unit in Valjevo, before getting transferred to Belgrade, and finally Po≈æarevac. After serving 10 months, he got out of the military service on 14 September 1979. =1980s= Upon his return from the army, ƒåoliƒá started work on his third album‚Äîthat came out in the spring of 1980, entitled Zbog tebe; it brought more hits as ƒåola further secured his position of the most popular pop performer in Yugoslavia. In 1984, ƒåoliƒá moved from his hometown Sarajevo to Ljubljana where he started a private business with Goran Bregoviƒá through their Kamarad label. He then lived in Zagreb for five years. 1988 saw his hit \\"Jastreb\\". In 1989, he moved back to Belgrade. =Comeback= After his 1990 album \\"Da ti ka≈æem ≈°ta mi je\\", he didn't make another album until late 1997, when he embarked on a comeback with Komuna label album Kad bi moja bila, and regained much of his popularity. The following year, ƒåoliƒá had nine sold-out concerts at Sava Centar. In October 2005, he performed two concerts at the Belgrade Arena. In 2010, he had a big concert on the Asim Ferhatoviƒá Hase Stadium in Sarajevo, within his Kad pogleda≈° me preko ramena tour, in front of over 60,000 people. On 25 June 2011, he had the biggest concert of his career: on U≈°ƒáe, in Belgrade, with over 100,000 visitors. His biggest concert to date, it celebrated his 40-year career milestone. Personal life At the outbreak of Bosnian war, ƒåoliƒá moved to Belgrade, and has lived there ever since. ƒåoliƒá holds a degree in economics from the University of Sarajevo. He is married to wife Aleksandra Aleksiƒá, and has two daughters.

Its development began in 2001, and the operating system became self-hosting in 2008. The first alpha release was made in September 2009, and the last was November 2012; the first beta was released in September 2018 and the second beta was released in June 2020. Haiku is supported by Haiku, Inc., a non-profit organization based in Rochester, New York, United States, founded in 2003 by former project leader Michael Phipps. As of the June 2018 monthly activity report, Haiku developers had ported LibreOffice.  History  Haiku began as the OpenBeOS project in 2001, the same year that Be, Inc. was bought by Palm, Inc. and BeOS development was discontinued. The focus of the project was to support the BeOS user community by creating an open- source, backward-compatible replacement for BeOS. The first project by OpenBeOS was a community-created \\"stop-gap\\" update for BeOS 5.0.3 in 2002. In 2003, the non-profit organization Haiku, Inc. was registered in Rochester, New York, to financially support development, and in 2004, after a notification of infringement of Palm's trademark of the BeOS name was sent to OpenBeOS, the project was renamed Haiku. It wasn't until September, 2009 that Haiku reached its first milestone with the release of Haiku R1/Alpha 1. Then in November, 2012 the R1/Alpha 4.1 was released, while work continued on nightly builds. On September 28, 2018, the Haiku R1/Beta 1 was released. On June 9, 2020, Haiku R1/Beta 2 was released. , nightly builds continue to be released.  Technology  Haiku is written in C++ and provides an object-oriented API. The modular design of BeOS allowed individual components of Haiku to initially be developed in teams in relative isolation, in many cases developing them as replacements for the BeOS components prior to the completion of other parts of the operating system. The original teams developing these components, including both servers and APIs (collectively known in Haiku as \\"kits\\"), included: * App/Interface: develops the Interface, App and Support kits. * BFS: develops the Be File System, which is mostly complete with the resulting OpenBFS. * Game: develops the Game Kit and its APIs. * Input Server: the server that handles input devices, such as keyboards and mice, and how they communicate with other parts of the system. * Kernel: develops the kernel, the core of the operating system. * Media: develops the audio server and related APIs. * MIDI: implements the MIDI protocol. * Network: writes drivers for network devices and APIs relating to networking. * OpenGL: develops OpenGL support. * Preferences: recreates the preferences suite. * Printing: works on the print servers and drivers for printers. * Screen Saver: implements screen saver function. * Storage: develops the storage kit and drivers for required filesystems. * Translation: recreates the reading/writing/conversion modules for the different file formats. A few kits have been deemed feature complete and the rest are in various stages of development. The Haiku kernel is a modular hybrid kernel which began as a fork of NewOS, a modular monokernel written by former Be Inc. engineer Travis Geiselbrecht. Like the rest of the system, it is currently still under heavy development. Many features have been implemented, including a virtual file system (VFS) layer and symmetric multiprocessing (SMP) support.  Package management  , Haiku includes a package management system called \\"Haiku Depot\\", enabling software to be compiled into dependency-tracking compressed packages. Packages can also be activated by installing them from remote repositories with pkgman, or dropping them over a special packages directory. Haiku package management mounts activated packages over a read-only system directory. The Haiku package management system performs dependency solving with libsolv from the openSUSE project.  Compatibility with BeOS  Haiku R1 aims to be compatible with BeOS at both the source and binary level, allowing software written and compiled for BeOS to be compiled and run without modification on Haiku. This provides Haiku users with an instant library of applications to choose from (even programs whose developers are no longer in business or have no interest in updating them), in addition to allowing development of applications to resume from where they had been terminated following the demise of Be, Inc. This dedication to compatibility has its drawbacks though ‚Äî requiring Haiku to use a forked version of the GCC compiler, based on version 2.95, released in 2001, which is now years old. Switching to the newer version 7 of GCC breaks compatibility with BeOS software; therefore Haiku supports being built as a hybrid GCC7/GCC2 environment. This allows the system to run both GCC version 2 and version 7 binaries at the same time. The changes done to GCC 2.95 for Haiku include wide characters support and backport of fixes from GCC 3 and later. This compatibility applies to 32-bit x86 systems only. The PowerPC version of BeOS R5 is not supported. As a consequence, the ARM, 68k, 64-bit x86 and PPC ports of Haiku use only the GCC version 7 compiler. Despite these attempts, compatibility with a number of system add-ons that use private APIs will not be implemented. These include additional filesystem drivers and media codec add-ons, although the only affected add-ons for BeOS R5 not easily re- implemented are those for Indeo 5 media decoders, for which no specification exists. R5 binary applications that run successfully under Haiku () include: Opera, Firefox, NetPositive, Quake II, Quake III, SeaMonkey, Vision and VLC. Driver compatibility is incomplete, and unlikely to cover all kinds of BeOS drivers. 2D graphics drivers in general work exactly the same as on R5, as do network drivers. Moreover, Haiku offers a source-level FreeBSD network driver compatibility layer, which means that it can support any network hardware that will work on FreeBSD. Audio drivers using API versions prior to BeOS R5 are as-yet unsupported, and unlikely to be so; however, R5-era drivers work. Low- level device drivers, namely those for storage devices and SCSI adapters, will not be compatible. USB drivers for both the second- (BeOS 5) and third- (BeOS Dano) generation USB stacks will work, however. In some other aspects, Haiku is already more advanced than BeOS. For example, the interface kit allows the use of a layout system to automatically place widgets in windows, while on BeOS the developer had to specify the exact position of each widget by hand. This allows for GUIs that will render correctly with any font size and makes localization of applications much easier, as a longer string in a translated language will make the widget grow, instead of being partly invisible if the widget size were fixed.  Beyond R1  Initial planning for R2 has started through the \\"Glass Elevator\\" project (a reference to the children's novel Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator). The only detail confirmed so far is that it will switch to a current GCC release. A compatibility layer is planned that will allow applications developed for Haiku R1 to run on Haiku R2 and later. This was mentioned in a discussion on the Haiku mailing list by one of the lead developers, Axel D√∂rfler. Suggested new features include file indexing on par with Unix's Beagle, Google Desktop and macOS's Spotlight, greater integration of scalable vector graphics into the desktop, proper support for multiple users, and additional kits. = Critical (self-)reflection on versioning = At 2010 edition of FOSDEM in Brussels, Niels Sascha Reedijk gave a talk HAIKU OS has no Future cited the work of queer theory by Lee Edelman on queer futurity, and Mathew Fuller‚Äôs software studies, stating the Haiku OS is a ‚Äúqueer‚Äù operating system: ‚ÄúOur work will not ever define the future of operating systems, but what it does do is undermine the monotone machinery of the competition.

The current being \\"copied\\" can be, and sometimes is, a varying signal current. Conceptually, an ideal current mirror is simply an ideal inverting current amplifier that reverses the current direction as well. Or it can consist of a current- controlled current source (CCCS). The current mirror is used to provide bias currents and active loads to circuits. It can also be used to model a more realistic current source (since ideal current sources don't exist). The circuit topology covered here is one that appears in many monolithic ICs. It is a Widlar mirror without an emitter degeneration resistor in the follower (output) transistor. This topology can only be done in an IC, as the matching has to be extremely close and cannot be achieved with discretes. Another topology is the Wilson current mirror. The Wilson mirror solves the Early effect voltage problem in this design. Mirror characteristics There are three main specifications that characterize a current mirror. The first is the transfer ratio (in the case of a current amplifier) or the output current magnitude (in the case of a constant current source CCS). The second is its AC output resistance, which determines how much the output current varies with the voltage applied to the mirror. The third specification is the minimum voltage drop across the output part of the mirror necessary to make it work properly. This minimum voltage is dictated by the need to keep the output transistor of the mirror in active mode. The range of voltages where the mirror works is called the compliance range and the voltage marking the boundary between good and bad behavior is called the compliance voltage. There are also a number of secondary performance issues with mirrors, for example, temperature stability. Practical approximations For small-signal analysis the current mirror can be approximated by its equivalent Norton impedance. In large-signal hand analysis, a current mirror is usually and simply approximated by an ideal current source. However, an ideal current source is unrealistic in several respects: *it has infinite AC impedance, while a practical mirror has finite impedance *it provides the same current regardless of voltage, that is, there are no compliance range requirements *it has no frequency limitations, while a real mirror has limitations due to the parasitic capacitances of the transistors *the ideal source has no sensitivity to real-world effects like noise, power-supply voltage variations and component tolerances. Circuit realizations of current mirrors =Basic idea= A bipolar transistor can be used as the simplest current-to-current converter but its transfer ratio would highly depend on temperature variations, Œ≤ tolerances, etc. To eliminate these undesired disturbances, a current mirror is composed of two cascaded current-to-voltage and voltage-to- current converters placed at the same conditions and having reverse characteristics. It is not obligatory for them to be linear; the only requirement is their characteristics to be mirrorlike (for example, in the BJT current mirror below, they are logarithmic and exponential). Usually, two identical converters are used but the characteristic of the first one is reversed by applying a negative feedback. Thus a current mirror consists of two cascaded equal converters (the first - reversed and the second - direct). Figure 1: A current mirror implemented with npn bipolar transistors using a resistor to set the reference current IREF; VCC = supply voltage =Basic BJT current mirror= If a voltage is applied to the BJT base-emitter junction as an input quantity and the collector current is taken as an output quantity, the transistor will act as an exponential voltage-to-current converter. By applying a negative feedback (simply joining the base and collector) the transistor can be \\"reversed\\" and it will begin acting as the opposite logarithmic current-to-voltage converter; now it will adjust the \\"output\\" base-emitter voltage so as to pass the applied \\"input\\" collector current. The simplest bipolar current mirror (shown in Figure 1) implements this idea. It consists of two cascaded transistor stages acting accordingly as a reversed and direct voltage-to-current converters. The emitter of transistor Q1 is connected to ground. Its collector-base voltage is zero as shown. Consequently, the voltage drop across Q1 is VBE, that is, this voltage is set by the diode law and Q1 is said to be diode connected. (See also Ebers-Moll model.) It is important to have Q1 in the circuit instead of a simple diode, because Q1 sets VBE for transistor Q2. If Q1 and Q2 are matched, that is, have substantially the same device properties, and if the mirror output voltage is chosen so the collector-base voltage of Q2 is also zero, then the VBE-value set by Q1 results in an emitter current in the matched Q2 that is the same as the emitter current in Q1. Because Q1 and Q2 are matched, their Œ≤0-values also agree, making the mirror output current the same as the collector current of Q1. The current delivered by the mirror for arbitrary collector-base reverse bias, VCB, of the output transistor is given by: :: I_\\\\text{C} = I_\\\\text{S} \\\\left( e^{\\\\frac{V_\\\\text{BE}}{V_\\\\text{T}}} - 1 \\\\right) \\\\left(1 + \\\\frac{V_\\\\text{CE}}{V_\\\\text{A}}\\\\right), where IS is the reverse saturation current or scale current; VT, the thermal voltage; and VA, the Early voltage. This current is related to the reference current Iref when the output transistor VCB = 0 V by: :: I_\\\\text{ref} = I_C \\\\left( 1 + \\\\frac{2}{\\\\beta_0} \\\\right), as found using Kirchhoff's current law at the collector node of Q1: :: I_\\\\text{ref} = I_C + I_{B1} + I_{B2} \\\\ . The reference current supplies the collector current to Q1 and the base currents to both transistors ‚Äî when both transistors have zero base-collector bias, the two base currents are equal, IB1 = IB2 = IB. :: I_\\\\text{ref} = I_C + I_B + I_B = I_C + 2 I_B = I_C \\\\left(1 + \\\\frac {2} {\\\\beta_0} \\\\right), Parameter Œ≤0 is the transistor Œ≤-value for VCB = 0 V. Output resistance If VBC is greater than zero in output transistor Q2, the collector current in Q2 will be somewhat larger than for Q1 due to the Early effect. In other words, the mirror has a finite output (or Norton) resistance given by the ro of the output transistor, namely: : R_N = r_o = \\\\frac{V_A + V_{CE}}{I_C} \\\\ , where VA is the Early voltage; and VCE, the collector-to-emitter voltage of output transistor. Compliance voltage To keep the output transistor active, VCB ‚â• 0 V. That means the lowest output voltage that results in correct mirror behavior, the compliance voltage, is VOUT = VCV = VBE under bias conditions with the output transistor at the output current level IC and with VCB = 0 V or, inverting the I-V relation above: ::V_{CV} = V_T \\\\ln\\\\left(\\\\frac{I_C}{I_S} + 1\\\\right), where VT is the thermal voltage; and IS, the reverse saturation current or scale current. Extensions and complications When Q2 has VCB > 0 V, the transistors no longer are matched. In particular, their Œ≤-values differ due to the Early effect, with ::\\\\begin{align} \\\\beta_1 &= \\\\beta_0  \\\\beta_2 &= \\\\beta_0 \\\\left(1 + \\\\frac{V_{CB}}{V_A}\\\\right), \\\\end{align} where VA is the Early voltage and Œ≤0 is the transistor Œ≤ for VCB = 0 V. Besides the difference due to the Early effect, the transistor Œ≤-values will differ because the Œ≤0-values depend on current, and the two transistors now carry different currents (see Gummel-Poon model). Further, Q2 may get substantially hotter than Q1 due to the associated higher power dissipation. To maintain matching, the temperature of the transistors must be nearly the same. In integrated circuits and transistor arrays where both transistors are on the same die, this is easy to achieve. But if the two transistors are widely separated, the precision of the current mirror is compromised. Additional matched transistors can be connected to the same base and will supply the same collector current. In other words, the right half of the circuit can be duplicated several times with various resistor values replacing R2 on each. Note, however, that each additional right-half transistor \\"steals\\" a bit of collector current from Q1 due to the non-zero base currents of the right-half transistors. This will result in a small reduction in the programmed current. See also an example of a mirror with emitter degeneration to increase mirror resistance. For the simple mirror shown in the diagram, typical values of \\\\beta will yield a current match of 1% or better. Figure 2: An n-channel MOSFET current mirror with a resistor to set the reference current IREF; VDD is the supply voltage =Basic MOSFET current mirror= The basic current mirror can also be implemented using MOSFET transistors, as shown in Figure 2. Transistor M1 is operating in the saturation or active mode, and so is M2. In this setup, the output current IOUT is directly related to IREF, as discussed next. The drain current of a MOSFET ID is a function of both the gate-source voltage and the drain-to-gate voltage of the MOSFET given by ID = f (VGS, VDG), a relationship derived from the functionality of the MOSFET device. In the case of transistor M1 of the mirror, ID = IREF. Reference current IREF is a known current, and can be provided by a resistor as shown, or by a \\"threshold-referenced\\" or \\"self- biased\\" current source to ensure that it is constant, independent of voltage supply variations. Using VDG = 0 for transistor M1, the drain current in M1 is ID = f(VGS, VDG=0), so we find: f(VGS, 0) = IREF, implicitly determining the value of VGS. Thus IREF sets the value of VGS. The circuit in the diagram forces the same VGS to apply to transistor M2. If M2 is also biased with zero VDG and provided transistors M1 and M2 have good matching of their properties, such as channel length, width, threshold voltage, etc., the relationship IOUT = f(VGS, VDG = 0) applies, thus setting IOUT = IREF; that is, the output current is the same as the reference current when VDG = 0 for the output transistor, and both transistors are matched. The drain-to-source voltage can be expressed as VDS = VDG \\\\+ VGS. With this substitution, the Shichman‚ÄìHodges model provides an approximate form for function f(VGS, VDG): ::\\\\begin{align} I_d &= f(V_{GS}, V_{DG})  &= \\\\frac{1}{2} K_p \\\\left(\\\\frac{W}{L}\\\\right)\\\\left(V_{GS} - V_{th}\\\\right)^2 \\\\left(1 + \\\\lambda V_{DS}\\\\right)  &= \\\\frac{1}{2} K_p \\\\left[\\\\frac{W}{L}\\\\right]\\\\left[V_{GS} - V_{th}\\\\right]^2 \\\\left[1 + \\\\lambda (V_{DG} + V_{GS})\\\\right] ,  \\\\end{align} where K_p is a technology-related constant associated with the transistor, W/L is the width to length ratio of the transistor, V_{GS} is the gate-source voltage, V_{th} is the threshold voltage, Œª is the channel length modulation constant, and V_{DS} is the drain-source voltage. Output resistance Because of channel-length modulation, the mirror has a finite output (or Norton) resistance given by the ro of the output transistor, namely (see channel length modulation): :: R_N = r_o = \\\\frac{1}{I_D}\\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{\\\\lambda}r + V_{DS}\\\\right) = \\\\frac{1}{I_D}\\\\left(V_E L + V_{DS}\\\\right), where Œª = channel-length modulation parameter and VDS = drain-to-source bias. Compliance voltage To keep the output transistor resistance high, VDG ‚â• 0 V.Keeping the output resistance high means more than keeping the MOSFET in active mode, because the output resistance of real MOSFETs only begins to increase on entry into the active region, then rising to become close to maximum value only when VDG ‚â• 0 V. (see Baker). That means the lowest output voltage that results in correct mirror behavior, the compliance voltage, is VOUT = VCV = VGS for the output transistor at the output current level with VDG = 0 V, or using the inverse of the f-function, f ‚àí1: ::V_{CV} = V_{GS} (\\\\text{for}\\\\ I_D\\\\ \\\\text{at} \\\\ V_{DG} = 0V) = f^{-1}(I_D) \\\\ \\\\text{with}\\\\ V_{DG} = 0 \\\\ . For the Shichman‚ÄìHodges model, f‚àí1 is approximately a square-root function. Extensions and reservations A useful feature of this mirror is the linear dependence of f upon device width W, a proportionality approximately satisfied even for models more accurate than the Shichman‚ÄìHodges model. Thus, by adjusting the ratio of widths of the two transistors, multiples of the reference current can be generated. The Shichman‚ÄìHodges modelNanoDotTek Report NDT14-08-2007, 12 August 2007 is accurate only for rather dated technology, although it often is used simply for convenience even today. Any quantitative design based upon new technology uses computer models for the devices that account for the changed current- voltage characteristics. Among the differences that must be accounted for in an accurate design is the failure of the square law in Vgs for voltage dependence and the very poor modeling of Vds drain voltage dependence provided by ŒªVds. Another failure of the equations that proves very significant is the inaccurate dependence upon the channel length L. A significant source of L-dependence stems from Œª, as noted by Gray and Meyer, who also note that Œª usually must be taken from experimental data. Due to the wide variation of Vth even within a particular device number discrete versions are problematic. Although the variation can be somewhat compensated for by using a Source degenerate resistor its value becomes so large that the output resistance suffers (i.e. reduces). This variation relegates the MOSFET version to the IC/monolithic arena. =Feedback-assisted current mirror= Figure 3: Gain- boosted current mirror with op-amp feedback to increase output resistance MOSFET version of gain-boosted current mirror; M1 and M2 are in active mode, while M3 and M4 are in Ohmic mode and act like resistors. The operational amplifier provides feedback that maintains a high output resistance. Figure 3 shows a mirror using negative feedback to increase output resistance. Because of the op amp, these circuits are sometimes called gain-boosted current mirrors. Because they have relatively low compliance voltages, they also are called wide-swing current mirrors. A variety of circuits based upon this idea are in use, particularly for MOSFET mirrors because MOSFETs have rather low intrinsic output resistance values. A MOSFET version of Figure 3 is shown in Figure 4, where MOSFETs M3 and M4 operate in Ohmic mode to play the same role as emitter resistors RE in Figure 3, and MOSFETs M1 and M2 operate in active mode in the same roles as mirror transistors Q1 and Q2 in Figure 3. An explanation follows of how the circuit in Figure 3 works. The operational amplifier is fed the difference in voltages V1 ‚àí V2 at the top of the two emitter-leg resistors of value RE. This difference is amplified by the op amp and fed to the base of output transistor Q2. If the collector base reverse bias on Q2 is increased by increasing the applied voltage VA, the current in Q2 increases, increasing V2 and decreasing the difference V1 ‚àí V2 entering the op amp. Consequently, the base voltage of Q2 is decreased, and VBE of Q2 decreases, counteracting the increase in output current. If the op-amp gain Av is large, only a very small difference V1 ‚àí V2 is sufficient to generate the needed base voltage VB for Q2, namely : V_1 - V_2 = \\\\frac{V_B}{A_v}. Consequently, the currents in the two leg resistors are held nearly the same, and the output current of the mirror is very nearly the same as the collector current IC1 in Q1, which in turn is set by the reference current as : I_\\\\text{ref} = I_{C1} \\\\left(1 + \\\\frac{1}{\\\\beta_1}\\\\right), where Œ≤1 for transistor Q1 and Œ≤2 for Q2 differ due to the Early effect if the reverse bias across the collector-base of Q2 is non-zero. Output resistance Figure 5: Small-signal circuit to determine output resistance of mirror; transistor Q2 is replaced with its hybrid-pi model; a test current IX at the output generates a voltage VX, and the output resistance is Rout = VX / IX. An idealized treatment of output resistance is given in the footnote.An idealized version of the argument in the text, valid for infinite op amp gain, is as follows. If the op amp is replaced by a nullor, voltage V2 = V1, so the currents in the leg resistors are held at the same value. That means the emitter currents of the transistors are the same. If the VCB of Q2 increases, so does the output transistor Œ≤ because of the Early effect: Œ≤ = Œ≤0(1 + VCB / VA). Consequently the base current to Q2 given by IB = IE / (Œ≤ + 1) decreases and the output current Iout = IE / (1 + 1 / Œ≤) increases slightly because Œ≤ increases slightly. Doing the math, :\\\\begin{align} \\\\frac{1}{R_\\\\text{out}} &= \\\\frac{\\\\partial I_\\\\text{out}}{\\\\partial V_{CB}} = I_E \\\\cdot \\\\frac{\\\\partial}{\\\\partial V_{CB}} \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\beta}{\\\\beta + 1}\\\\right) = I_E \\\\cdot \\\\frac{1}{(\\\\beta + 1)^2} \\\\cdot \\\\frac{\\\\partial\\\\beta}{\\\\partial V_{CB}}  &= \\\\frac{\\\\beta I_E}{\\\\beta + 1} \\\\cdot \\\\frac{1}{\\\\beta} \\\\cdot \\\\frac{\\\\beta_0}{V_A} \\\\cdot \\\\frac{1}{\\\\beta + 1}  &= I_\\\\text{out} \\\\cdot \\\\frac{1}{1 + \\\\frac{V_{CB}}{V_A}} \\\\cdot \\\\frac{1}{V_A} \\\\cdot \\\\frac{1}{\\\\beta + 1}  &= \\\\frac{1}{(\\\\beta + 1) r_0}, \\\\end{align} where the transistor output resistance is given by rO = (VA \\\\+ VCB) / Iout. That is, the ideal mirror resistance for the circuit using an ideal op amp nullor is Rout = (Œ≤ + 1c)rO, in agreement with the value given later in the text when the gain ‚Üí ‚àû. A small-signal analysis for an op amp with finite gain Av but otherwise ideal is based upon Figure 5 (Œ≤, rO and rœÄ refer to Q2). To arrive at Figure 5, notice that the positive input of the op amp in Figure 3 is at AC ground, so the voltage input to the op amp is simply the AC emitter voltage Ve applied to its negative input, resulting in a voltage output of ‚àíAv Ve. Using Ohm's law across the input resistance rœÄ determines the small-signal base current Ib as: : I_b = \\\\frac{V_e}\\\\frac{r_\\\\pi}{A_v + 1} \\\\ . Combining this result with Ohm's law for R_E, V_e can be eliminated, to find:As Av ‚Üí ‚àû, Ve ‚Üí 0 and Ib ‚Üí IX. : I_b = I_X \\\\frac{R_E}{ R_E + \\\\frac{r_\\\\pi}{A_v + 1} }. Kirchhoff's voltage law from the test source IX to the ground of RE provides: : V_X = (I_X + \\\\beta I_b) r_O + (I_X - I_b )R_E. Substituting for Ib and collecting terms the output resistance Rout is found to be: :R_\\\\text{out} = \\\\frac{V_X}{I_X} = r_O \\\\left( 1 + \\\\beta \\\\frac{R_E}{R_E + \\\\frac{r_\\\\pi}{A_v + 1}} \\\\right) + R_E\\\\\\\\frac{r_\\\\pi}{A_v + 1}. For a large gain Av ‚â´ rœÄ / RE the maximum output resistance obtained with this circuit is :R_\\\\text{out} = (\\\\beta + 1)r_O, a substantial improvement over the basic mirror where Rout = rO. The small- signal analysis of the MOSFET circuit of Figure 4 is obtained from the bipolar analysis by setting Œ≤ = gm rœÄ in the formula for Rout and then letting rœÄ ‚Üí ‚àû. The result is :R_\\\\text{out} = r_O \\\\left[1 + g_m R_E(A_v + 1)\\\\right] + R_E. This time, RE is the resistance of the source-leg MOSFETs M3, M4. Unlike Figure 3, however, as Av is increased (holding RE fixed in value), Rout continues to increase, and does not approach a limiting value at large Av. Compliance voltage For Figure 3, a large op amp gain achieves the maximum Rout with only a small RE. A low value for RE means V2 also is small, allowing a low compliance voltage for this mirror, only a voltage V2 larger than the compliance voltage of the simple bipolar mirror. For this reason this type of mirror also is called a wide-swing current mirror, because it allows the output voltage to swing low compared to other types of mirror that achieve a large Rout only at the expense of large compliance voltages. With the MOSFET circuit of Figure 4, like the circuit in Figure 3, the larger the op amp gain Av, the smaller RE can be made at a given Rout, and the lower the compliance voltage of the mirror. =Other current mirrors= There are many sophisticated current mirrors that have higher output resistances than the basic mirror (more closely approach an ideal mirror with current output independent of output voltage) and produce currents less sensitive to temperature and device parameter variations and to circuit voltage fluctuations. These multi-transistor mirror circuits are used both with bipolar and MOS transistors.

Although rarely staged in its entirety, it is the play with the largest audience numbers on German-language stages. Faust is considered by many to be Goethe's magnum opus and the greatest work of German literature. The earliest forms of the work, known as the Urfaust, were developed between 1772 and 1775; however, the details of that development are not entirely clear. Urfaust has twenty-two scenes, one in prose, two largely prose and the remaining 1,441 lines in rhymed verse. The manuscript is lost, but a copy was discovered in 1886.Goethe's Plays, by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, translated into English with Introductions by Charles E. Passage, Publisher Benn Limited 1980 , The first appearance of the work in print was Faust, a Fragment, published in 1790. Goethe completed a preliminary version of what is now known as Part One in 1806. Its publication in 1808 was followed by the revised 1828‚Äì29 edition, the last to be edited by Goethe himself. Goethe finished writing Faust, Part Two in 1831; it was published posthumously the following year. In contrast to Faust, Part One, the focus here is no longer on the soul of Faust, which has been sold to the devil, but rather on social phenomena such as psychology, history and politics, in addition to mystical and philosophical topics. The second part formed the principal occupation of Goethe's last years. Nomenclature The original 1808 German title page of Goethe's play read simply: \\"Faust. / Eine Trag√∂die\\" (\\"Faust. / A Tragedy\\"). The addition of \\"erster Teil\\" (in English, \\"Part One\\") was retrospectively applied by publishers when the sequel was published in 1832 with a title page which read: \\"Faust. / Der Trag√∂die zweiter Teil\\" (\\"Faust. / The Tragedy's Second Part\\"). The two plays have been published in English under a number of titles, and are usually referred to as Faust, Parts One and Two. Faust, Part One Faust I, first edition, 1808 The principal characters of Faust Part One include: * Heinrich Faust, a scholar, sometimes said to be based on Johann Georg Faust, or on Jacob Bidermann's dramatized account of the Legend of the Doctor of Paris, Cenodoxus; see also Faust * Mephistopheles, the Devil * Gretchen, Faust's love (short for Margarete; Goethe uses both forms) * Marthe, Gretchen's neighbour * Valentin, Gretchen's brother * Wagner, Faust's attendant Faust, Part One takes place in multiple settings, the first of which is Heaven. The demon Mephistopheles makes a bet with God: he says that he can lure God's favourite human being (Faust), who is striving to learn everything that can be known, away from righteous pursuits. The next scene takes place in Faust's study where Faust, despairing at the vanity of scientific, humanitarian and religious learning, turns to magic for the showering of infinite knowledge. He suspects, however, that his attempts are failing. Frustrated, he ponders suicide, but rejects it as he hears the echo of nearby Easter celebrations begin. He goes for a walk with his assistant Wagner and is followed home by a stray poodle. In Faust's study, the poodle transforms into Mephistopheles. Faust makes an arrangement with him: Mephistopheles will do everything that Faust wants while he is here on Earth, and in exchange Faust will serve the Devil in Hell. Faust's arrangement is that if he is pleased enough with anything Mephistopheles gives him that he wants to stay in that moment forever, then he will die in that moment. When Mephistopheles tells Faust to sign the pact with blood, Faust complains that Mephistopheles does not trust Faust's word of honor. In the end, Mephistopheles wins the argument and Faust signs the contract with a drop of his own blood. Faust has a few excursions and then meets Margaret (also known as Gretchen). He is attracted to her and with jewelry and with help from a neighbor, Martha, Mephistopheles draws Gretchen into Faust's arms. With Mephistopheles' aid, Faust seduces Gretchen. Gretchen's mother dies from a sleeping potion, administered by Gretchen to obtain privacy so that Faust could visit her. Gretchen discovers she is pregnant. Gretchen's brother condemns Faust, challenges him and falls dead at the hands of Faust and Mephistopheles. Gretchen drowns her illegitimate child and is convicted of the murder. Faust tries to save Gretchen from death by attempting to free her from prison. Finding that she refuses to escape, Faust and Mephistopheles flee the dungeon, while voices from Heaven announce that Gretchen shall be saved ‚Äì \\"\\" ‚Äì this differs from the harsher ending of Urfaust ‚Äì \\"\\" ‚Äì \\"she is condemned.\\" Faust, Part Two Faust II, first edition, 1832 Cover of the first edition of Faust Part Two, 1832 Rich in classical allusion, in Part Two the romantic story of the first Faust is put aside, and Faust wakes in a field of fairies to initiate a new cycle of adventures and purpose. The piece consists of five acts (relatively isolated episodes) each representing a different theme. Ultimately, Faust goes to Heaven, for he loses only half of the bet. Angels, who arrive as messengers of divine mercy, declare at the end of Act V: \\"He who strives on and lives to strive / Can earn redemption still\\" (V, 11936‚Äì7). Relationship between the parts Throughout Part One, Faust remains unsatisfied; the ultimate conclusion of the tragedy and the outcome of the wagers are only revealed in Faust, Part Two. The first part represents the \\"small world\\" and takes place in Faust's own local, temporal milieu. In contrast, Part Two takes place in the \\"wide world\\" or macrocosmos. Translations In 1821, a partial English verse translation of Faust (Part One) was published anonymously by the London publisher Thomas Boosey and Sons, with illustrations by the German engraver Moritz Retzsch. This translation was attributed to the English poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge by Frederick Burwick. and James C. McKusick. in their 2007 Oxford University Press edition, Faustus: From the German of Goethe, Translated by Samuel Taylor Coleridge.. In a letter dated 4 September 1820, Goethe wrote to his son August that Coleridge was translating Faust. However, this attribution is controversial: Roger Paulin, William St. Clair, and Elinor Shaffer provide a lengthy rebuttal to Burwick and McKusick, offering evidence including Coleridge's repeated denials that he had ever translated Faustus and arguing that Goethe's letter to his son was based on misinformation from a third party.. Coleridge's fellow Romantic Percy Bysshe Shelley produced admired fragments of a translation first publishing Part One Scene II in The Liberal magazine in 1822, with \\"Scene I\\" (in the original, the \\"Prologue in Heaven\\") being published in the first edition of his Posthumous Poems by Mary Shelley in 1824. In 1828, at the age of twenty, G√©rard de Nerval published a French translation of Goethe's Faust. In 1870‚Äì71, Bayard Taylor published an English translation in the original metres. In 1885, the Irish dramatist W. G. Wills loosely adapted the first part of Faust for a production starring Henry Irving as Mephistopheles and Ellen Terry as Margaret at the Lyceum Theatre, London. Calvin Thomas published translations of Part 1 in 1892 and Part 2 in 1897. In 1908, Stephen Phillips and J. Comyns Carr freely adapted the first part of Faust for a production at Her Majesty's Theatre. It starred Henry Ainley as Faust, Herbert Beerbohm Tree as Mephistopheles and Marie Lohr as Margaret. Philosopher Walter Kaufmann was also known for an English translation of Faust, presenting Part One in its entirety, with selections from Part Two, and omitted scenes extensively summarized. Kaufmann's version preserves Goethe's metres and rhyme schemes, but objected to translating all of Part Two into English, believing that \\"To let Goethe speak English is one thing; to transpose into English his attempt to imitate Greek poetry in German is another.\\" In August 1950, Boris Pasternak's Russian translation of the first part led him to be attacked in the Soviet literary journal Novy Mir. The attack read in part, > ... the translator clearly distorts Goethe's ideas... in order to defend the > reactionary theory of 'pure art' ... he introduces an aesthetic and > individualist flavor into the text... attributes a reactionary idea to > Goethe... distorts the social and philosophical meaning...Olga Ivinskaya, A > Captive of Time: My Years with Pasternak, 1978. pp. 78‚Äì79. In response, Pasternak wrote to the exiled daughter of Marina Tsvetaeva, > There has been much concern over an article in Novy Mir denouncing my Faust > on the grounds that the gods, angels, witches, spirits, the madness of poor > Gretchen, and everything 'irrational' has been rendered much too well, while > Goethe's 'progressive' ideas (what are they?) have been glossed over. But I > have a contract to do the second part as well! I don't know how it will all > end. Fortunately, it seems that the article won't have any practical effect. In 1976, Farrar, Straus and Giroux published Randall Jarrell's translation of Faust, Part One posthumously. Martin Greenberg's translations have been credited with capturing the poetic feel of the original. Historic productions =Part One= *May 24, 1819: Premiere of selected scenes.

It is a member of the sunfish family Centrarchidae of the order Perciformes. It is native to North America and lives in streams, rivers, lakes, and ponds. It is commonly found east of the Rockies. It usually hides around, and inside, old tree stumps and other underwater structures. It can live in either deep or very shallow water, and will often move from one to the other depending on the time of day or season. Bluegills also like to find shelter among aquatic plants and in the shade of trees along banks. Bluegills can grow up to long and about . While their color can vary from population to population, they typically have a very distinctive coloring, with deep blue and purple on the face and gill cover, dark olive-colored bands down the side, and a fiery orange to yellow belly. The fish are omnivores and will eat anything they can fit in their mouth. They mostly feed on small aquatic insects and fish. The fish play a key role in the food chain, and are prey for bass, other (sunfish), northern pike, walleye, muskies, trout, herons, kingfishers, snapping turtles, and otters. Summary Bluegill from Lake Lanier, Buford, GA. (Caught & Released, June 14, 2004) The bluegill is noted for the black spot (the \\"ear\\") that it has on each side of the posterior edge of the gills and base of the dorsal fin. The sides of its head and chin are commonly a dark shade of blue. The precise coloration will vary due to the presence of neurally controlledchromatophores under the skin. The fish usually displays 5‚Äì9 vertical bars on the sides of its body immediately after being caught as part of its threat display. It typically has a yellowish breast and abdomen, with the breast of the breeding male being a bright orange. The bluegill has three anal spines, ten to 12 anal fin rays, six to 13 dorsal fin spines, 11 to 12 dorsal rays, and 12 to 13 pectoral rays. They are characterized by their deep, flattened bodies. They have a terminal mouth, ctenoid scales, and a lateral line that is arched upward anteriorly.Sublette, J. E., M. D. Hatch, and M. Sublette. 1990. University of New Mexico Press, Albuquerque. 393 pp The bluegill typically ranges in size from about four to 12 inches, and reaches a maximum size just over 16 inches. The largest bluegill ever caught was four pounds, 12 ounces in 1950.Ross, S. T. 2001. The Inland Fishes of Mississippi. University Press of Mississippi, Jackson. 624 pp The bluegill is most closely related to the orangespotted sunfish and the redear sunfish, but different in a distinct spot at or near the base of the soft dorsal fin. Distribution and habitat Male bluegillThe bluegill occurs naturally in the United States east of the Rocky Mountains from coastal Virginia to Florida, west to Texas and northern Mexico, and north to western Minnesota and western New York. Today they have been introduced to almost everywhere else in North America, and have also been introduced into Europe, South Africa, Zimbabwe,https://www.newsday.co.zw/2014/01/11/cat-mouse-game-chivero/ Asia, South America, and Oceania. Bluegills have also been found in the Chesapeake Bay, indicating they can tolerate up to 1.8% salinity.Schultz, Ken. Ken Schultz's Field Guide to Freshwater Fish. Hoboken, NJ: J. Wiley & Sons, 2004 In some locations where they have been transplanted, they are considered pests: trade in the species is prohibited in Germany and Japan. In the case of Japan, bluegills were presented to the then-crown prince, Akihito in 1960 as a gift by Richard J. Daley, mayor of Chicago. The prince, in turn, donated the fish to fishery research agencies in Japan, from which they escaped and became an invasive species that has wreaked havoc with native species, especially in Lake Biwa in Shiga Prefecture. The Daij≈ç Tenn≈ç has since apologized.McCurry, Justin (November 26, 2007). \\"Japan in culinary offensive to stop spread of US fish\\". The Guardian. Bluegill live in the shallow waters of many lakes and ponds, along with streams, creeks, and rivers. They prefer water with many aquatic plants, and seclude themselves within or near fallen logs, water weeds or any other structure (natural or manmade) that's underwater. They can often be found around weed beds, where they search for food or spawn.Lee, D. S. 1980. Lepomis macrochirus (Rafinesque 1819), Bluegill. pp. 597 in D. S. Lee, et al. Atlas of North American Freshwater Fishes. N. C. State Mus. Nat. Hist., Raleigh, 854 pp In the summer, adults move to deep, open water where they suspend just below the surface and feed on plankton and other aquatic creatures. Bluegill try to spend most of their time in water from , and tend to have a home range of about during nonreproductive months. They enjoy heat, but do not like direct sunlight ‚Äì they typically live in deeper water, but will linger near the water surface in the morning to stay warm. Bluegill are usually found in schools of 10 to 20 fish, and these schools will often include other panfish, such as crappie, pumpkinseeds, and smallmouth bass.Paulson, Nicole, and Jay T. Hatch. \\"Fishes of Minnesota ‚Äì Bluegill.\\" GC 1112 Welcome. Minnesota Department of Natural Resources, 18 June 2004. Web. 04 May 2011. Ecology Young bluegills' diet consists of rotifers and water fleas. The adult diet consists of aquatic insect larvae (mayflies, caddisflies, dragonflies), but can also include crayfish, leeches, snails, and other small fish.Carlander, K.D. 1997. Handbook of freshwater fishery biology. Volume 2. Life history Data on centrarchid fishes of the United States and Canada. Iowa State Univ.Press, Iowa. If food is scarce, bluegill will also feed on aquatic vegetation, and if scarce enough, will even feed on their own eggs or offspring. As bluegill spend a great deal of time near the surface of water, they can also feed on surface bugs. Most bluegills feed during daylight hours, with a feeding peak being observed in the morning and evening (with the major peak occurring in the evening). Feeding location tends to be a balance between food abundance and predator abundance. Bluegill use gill rakers and bands of small teeth to ingest their food. During summer months, bluegills generally consume 3.2 percent of their body weight each day. To capture prey, bluegills use a suction system in which they accelerate water into their mouth. Prey comes in with this water. Only a limited amount of water is able to be suctioned, so the fish must get within 1.75 centimeters of the prey. In turn, bluegill are prey to many larger species, including largemouth bass, smallmouth bass, trout, muskellunge, turtles, northern pike, yellow perch, walleye, catfish, and even larger bluegill. Herons and otters have also been witnessed catching bluegill in shallow water. However, the shape of the fish makes them hard to swallow. Adaptations Bluegills have the ability to travel and change directions at high speeds by means of synchronized fin movements. They use notched caudal fins, soft dorsal fins, body undulations, and pectoral fins to move forward. Having a notched caudal fin allows them to accelerate quickly. The speed of their forward motion depends on the strength of which they abduct or adduct fins. The flat, slender body of the bluegill lowers water resistance and allows the bluegills to cut effectively through water. The large, flexible pectoral fins allow the fish to decelerate quickly. This superior maneuverability allows the bluegill to forage and escape predators very successfully. Bluegills have a lateral line system, as well as inner ears, that act as receptors for vibration and pressure changes. However, bluegills rely heavily on sight to feed, especially in their foraging. Optimal vision occurs in the daylight hours. The mouth of the bluegill is very small and requires the use of the pharynx to suck in prey. = Standard and backward swimming = The bluegill sunfish relies heavily on the flexibility of its fins to maintain maneuverability in response to fluid forces. The bluegill's segmentation in its pectoral fin rays mitigates the effects of fluid forces on the fish's movement. The bluegill has a variety of unusual adaptations that allow it to navigate different environments. In conditions where the bluegill is deprived of its various sensory abilities, it utilizes its pectoral fins in navigation. If the bluegill's visual input or lateral line input were to be compromised, its pectoral fins are then able to be utilized as mechanosensors through the bending of the fin(s) when the fish comes into contact with its environment. In standard swimming the bluegill sunfish relies on its caudal (tail) fin, dorsal fin, and anal fin. The bluegill's caudal fin muscles are important in the fish's slow swimming and also important in the beginning stages of the fish increasing its swimming speed. The dorsal and anal fins are two types of median fins that work in parallel to balance torque during steady swimming. When swimming backwards, the bluegill utilizes a plethora of fin muscles located in various parts of its body. Backward swimming in the bluegill is more complex than steady swimming, as it is not just the reversal of forward swimming. The fish utilizes its pectoral fins to provide a rhythmic beat while the dorsal and anal fins produce momentum to drive the fish backwards. The pectoral fins' rhythmic beat is asymmetric and aids the fish's balance in its slow, backward movement. = C-start escape response = The bluegill, amongst a wide array of other fishes, exhibits the C-start escape response, which is generated by large neurons called Mauthner cells. Mauthner cells operate as a command center for the escape response and respond quickly once the neural pathway has been activated by an initial stimulus. The cells trigger a contraction of muscle that bends the fish body into a 'C' to then aid in the propulsion away from a predator. The C-start trajectory is highly variable, allowing the fish to alter its escape response each time. Because of this high variability, predators have a lower chance of learning a successful predation technique to capture the fish. The C-start escape response produces other advantages, including the ability to move quickly and unpredictably to capture prey. Hydrodynamically, the bluegill exhibits specific flow patterns that accompany its C-start escape response. The caudal (tail) fin is a main source of momentum in typical kinematic models of the C-start escape response but the bluegill draws a majority of its momentum from the body bending associated with the response, as well as its dorsal and anal fins. The dorsal and anal fins' roles as propulsors during escape response suggest that the size of the fins could lead to an evolutionary advantage when escaping predators. Reproduction and lifestyle Spawning season for bluegills starts late in May and extends into August. The peak of the spawning season usually occurs in June in waters of . The male bluegills arrive first at the mating site. They will make a spawning bed of six to 12 inches in diameter in shallow water, clustering as many as 50 beds together. The males scoop out these beds in gravel or sand. Males tend to be very protective and chase everything away from their nests, especially other male bluegills. Some bluegills, regardless of their small size, will even attack snorkelers if they approach the edge of the nest. As a female approaches, the male will begin circling and making grunting noises. The motion and sound of the males seem to attract the females. Females are very choosy and will usually pick males with larger bodies and \\"ears\\", making larger size a desirable trait for males to have. If the female enters the nest, both the male and female will circle each other, with the male expressing very aggressive behavior toward the female. If the female stays, the pair will enter the nest and come to rest in the middle. With the male in an upright posture, the pair will touch bellies, quiver, and spawn. These actions are repeated at irregular intervals several times in a row. Once the spawning is done, the male will chase the female out of the nest and guard the eggs. The fertilization process is entirely external. The male's sperm combines with the female's eggs in the water. Smaller males will often hide in nearby weeds and dart into the nest as they attempt to fertilize the eggs. They then quickly dart away. The size of the female plays a large role in how many eggs will be produced. A small female can produce as few as 1,000 eggs, and a large, healthy female can produce up to 100,000 eggs. The male continues to watch over the nest until the larvae are able to hatch and swim away on their own. The bluegill generally begins its spawning career at one year of age, but has been found to spawn as early as four months of age under favorable conditions.Sternberg, Dick. Freshwater Gamefish of North America. 1987. Anglers find spawning season to be a very successful time to fish for bluegills, as they aggressively attack anything, including a hook, that comes near. The growth of the bluegill is very rapid in the first three years, but slows considerably once the fish reaches maturity. Many fish reach five to eight years old, and in extreme cases, can live 11 years. Relationship with humans The bluegill is the state fish of Illinois. =Fishing= Bluegill caught in an Alabama pond Bluegills are popular panfish, caught with live bait such as worms, crickets, grasshoppers, flies, minnows, maggots or small frogs, as well as small shrimp bits, processed bait, bread, corn, other table scraps, small crankbaits, spinners, fake worms, or even a bare hook. They mostly bite on vibrant colors like orange, yellow, green, or red, chiefly at dawn and dusk. They are noted for seeking out underwater vegetation for cover; their natural diet consists largely of small invertebrates such as crickets, water bugs, larvae, and very small fish. The bluegill itself is also occasionally used as bait for larger game fish species, such as blue catfish, flathead catfish and largemouth bass.Coble, Daniel W. \\"Effects of Angling on Bluegill Populations: Management Implications.\\" North American Journal of Fisheries Management 8.3 (1988): 277 Fishermen are sometimes able to use polarized sunglasses to see through water and find bluegills' spawning beds. Bluegill have a rather bold character; many have no fear of humans, eating food dropped into the water, and a population in Canada's Lake Scugog will even allow themselves to be stroked by human observers. Because of their size and the method of cooking them, bluegills are often called panfish.\\"Fishes of Minnesota: Bluegill Minnesota DNR.\\" Minnesota Department of Natural Resources: Minnesota DNR.

He was elected as the youngest member of the National Assembly in 1789. He is also known for his military expertise and his relation with Mme de Sta√´l. When France became a republic Montmorency turned into an ultra-royalist. Napoleon regarded him as a member of the catholic opposition. During the restoration he became Minister of Foreign Affairs. Early years Mathieu de Montomorency was born in Paris, France on 10 July 1767. He was the son of Mathieu Paul Louis de Montmorency, vicomte de Laval (1748‚Äì1809) and Catherine Jeanne Tavernier de Boullongne (d. 1838). Montmorency's father was a scion of one of the oldest noble families in France, while his wife was the daughter of an aristocratic French planter in Guadeloupe. Montmorency went on to seek higher education at College du Plessis, where he developed his love for the subject of philosophy and the idea of enlightenment. In 1780, his father, a colonel of the Auvergne regiment, was appointed a premier gentilhomme de la chambre to King Louis XVI of France's younger brother, the Comte de Provence. However, when Catherine was denied the corresponding rank of dame pour accompagner to the prince's wife, Marie-Jos√©phine, due to her relatively low birth, Laval resigned his post in Provence's household. Montmorency was a very intelligent man. He was a diplomatist and a great writer. He eventually went to become a tutor for Henry, duke de Bordeaux, the grandson of Charles X. In 1788 Mathieu de Montmorency married his first cousin Hortense de Luynes. Despite being married he actually paid very little attention to his wife. Due to the very relaxed nature of marriages, he often was seen without his wife. In actuality, Montmorency was madly in love with another cousin by the name of Marquise de Laval. When Laval died in Summer 1790, Montmorency went to a great depression. Madame de Stael brought Montmorency out of his depression since writing a series of letters to each other. Career Originally known by the title of Comte de Montmorency-Laval, Mathieu served as an adolescent with his father in the American War of Independence with Lafayette. America was a new nation that had built its nation on democracy and liberty. Montmorency is credited for bringing these new governmental ideas to France. He became the governor of the city and castle of Compi√®gne. Montmorency was a member of the noble class. The nobility had a very negative reputation, as they were known for being greedy and discourteous. However, Montmorency's actions began to change the way the nobility was viewed at the start of the revolution. He was extremely generous and showed great remorse to people, unlike others. His ultimate goal was to make the French people happy, while still preserving the nobility. He was the deputy of Montfort-l'Amaury from 28 March 1789 til 30 September 1791. He joined the Estates General (France) as its youngest member. He moved to the left side of the National Assembly, shifting from the Second Estate, the nobility. On 17 August he was appointed as the secretary of the assembly.> Montmorency fought the aristocracy under the tutelage of the abb√© Siey√®s. He moved the abolition of armorial bearings on 19 June 1790. Before 20 April 1792 he and Count de Narbonne, the Minister of War, went to inspect the troops. Around the Storming of the Tuileries in August Montmorency fled to Coppet to live with Mme de Sta√´l and Arnail Fran√ßois, marquis de Jaucourt. In January 1793 he accompanied her to Boulogne-sur-mer, when she sought refuge in England. On 17 June 1794 his brother an abott was guillotined. Montmorency started to study the church father Augustine. In May 1795 he lived in Yverdon. He returned to Paris to see his relatives. He was arrested as an √©migr√© on the 26th of December, but released after a few days. Montmorency lived on an estate in Ormesson-sur-Marne. De Sta√´l and Constant joined him there and Montmorency visited them 1797 in Luzarches. Ch√¢teau d'Ormesson In 1803 he again joined the Coppet group; he accompanied her to Paris. In August 1811 he traveled with De Sta√´l in Switzerland. Fran√ßois-Emmanuel Guignard, De Montmorency, Mme R√©camier were exiled by Napoleon. At the beginning of the Bourbon Restoration, he was promoted to the rank of mar√©chal de camp, but in March 1815 (at beginning of the Hundred Days) he accompanied Marie Th√©r√®se of France from Bordeaux to London and met with Louis XVIII in Ghent who was forced to flee. After the Battle of Waterloo and the final defeat of Napoleon, he was made a peer of France and received the title of Vicomte de Montmorency- Laval. He was instrumental in convincing Armand-Emmanuel du Plessis, Duc de Richelieu to replace his former friend and former Bonapartist Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-P√©rigord as the new Prime Minister of France. Known for strong reactionary, ultramontane, and Ultra-royalist views, Felicite became the French minister of foreign affairs under Jean-Baptiste Guillaume Joseph, comte de Vill√®le in December 1821. He recommended armed intervention in Spain, to restore Ferdinand VII, at the Congress of Verona in October 1822. However, he resigned his post in December, being compensated by the title of Duc de Montmorency-Laval and the cross of the Legion of Honour soon after. Death He was elected to the Acad√©mie fran√ßaise in 1825, with few qualifications for the honour. The following year, he was named tutor to the six-year-old heir to the throne, the Duc de Bordeaux. He died two months after receiving this prestigious appointment, on 24 March 1826. He was discovered seated lifeless at the end of the Good Friday Liturgy in St. Thomas d'Aquin church in the fashionable St. Germain des Pr√®s faubourg. After the death of her husband, Mathieu de Montmorency became the legal guardian of De Sta√´l's children. Like August Schlegel he was one of her intimates until the end of her life.

He played 18 ODIs for Pakistan and took 15 wickets in the format. In ODI cricket, he has been economical so far with an economy rate under 4.8 runs per over. His best bowling in ODIs came against New Zealand in Sri Lanka in 2003 taking three wickets for 31 runs at the Rangiri Dambulla International Stadium. Success in the one day arena has been more elusive, Pakistan usually opting to play the two spinning all-rounders Shahid Afridi and Shoaib Malik or Saeed Ajmal instead. =County cricket= Kaneria played English County Championship between 2004 and 2010 representing the Essex. He impressed in county cricket, taking 32 wickets in seven championship matches for Essex in 2005.

Kaneria suffered a broken finger in Essex's LV County Championship Division Two match against Worcestershire County Cricket Club (Worcestershire CCC) at Colchester on 21 August 2008. The bowler was injured attempting to take a catch off Ben Smith. An X-ray confirmed he had broken a finger and he missed the remainder of the 2008 English domestic season. =Match Fixing Inquiry (2010)= In May 2010, he was inquired in connection with ‚Äúmatch irregularities‚Äù in the 2009 domestic season. The investigations are believed to focus on a NatWest Pro40 match in September 2009, which Essex won. In September 2010, police told Kaneria that the investigation had been closed and that he had been cleared of any allegations. He was selected for the two-match Test series against South Africa. Although he was a part of the training camp, the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) stopped him from playing in the series. No reason was given for his exclusion from the series. He then played in the Quaid-e-Azam Trophy for HBL, taking 18 wickets in two games. On 17 February 2012, during Mervyn Westfield's trial on spot fixing charges, Kaneria was named in court as the man who approached Westfield with the idea. They were teammates at the time the alleged approach took place. Now in June 2012, both have been found guilty of offences by an ECB disciplinary panel. As a consequence, Kaneria has been banned for life from playing cricket in England and Wales by the aforementioned panel. The PCB had previously agreed to abide by the ECB's decision. Kaneria appealed against the lifetime ban on him by the ECB for his involvement in a spot-fixing scandal. The appeal against English Cricket Board's decision was denied in July 2013 for the second time, with the ECB saying \\"We note, with regret, that Mr Kaneria has neither made any admission of guilt nor expressed any remorse for his corrupt actions, despite the weight of evidence against him.\\" In October 2018, after years of denying his guilt, Kaneria admitted to his involvement in the 2009 spot-fixing scandal. Personal life Kaneria is a Hindu and an ethnic Gujarati. He is married to Dharmita Kaneria (a daughter of a Varasia family) and has a son Nadish Kaneria and daughter Parisa Kaneria. He is the cousin of former Pakistani wicket-keeper Anil Dalpat.

It was the first Indian war west of the Missouri fought by the U.S. Army and its only conflict ever with the Arikara. The war came as a response to an Arikara attack on trappers, called \\"the worst disaster in the history of the Western fur trade\\".Meyer, Roy W.: The Village Indians of the Upper Missouri. The Mandans, Hidatsas, and Arikaras. Lincoln and London, 1977, p. 53. Background When Lewis and Clark reached Arikara settlements in 1804, the inhabitants did not show hostility to the expedition. In 1806, during a trip to the United States capital, an Arikara leader died, and many Arikara believed that Americans were involved in his death.Viola, Herman J.: Diplomats in Buckskins. A History of Indian Delegations in Washington Ciry. Washington, D.C., 1981, p. 159. Later, as a result of the growing activity of fur trading companies, contact between Arikara and white merchants became more frequent, and skirmishes eventually followed. In the start of 1823, the Arikara \\"attacked the Missouri Fur Company's Fort Recovery [a trading post for the Sioux] and killed two traders\\".Jensen, Richard E. & James S. Hutchins: Wheel Boats on the Missouri. The Journals and Documents of the Atkinson-O'Fallon Expedition, 1824-26. Helena and Lincoln, 2001, p. 18. The Sioux, both Yankton and Yanktonai east of the Missouri and Lakota on the west side, had for long been at war with the Arikara, interrupted by short truces on Sioux terms.Meyer, Roy W.: The Village Indians of the Upper Missouri. The Mandans, Hidatsas, and Arikaras. Lincoln and London, 1977, pp. 39-40. The Arikaras in question were living in a double village on the west shore of the Missouri, six or seven miles (about 10 km) upstream from the mouth of Grand River. A small creek separated the two fortified villages of earth lodges, each with a heavy frame of wood.Meyer, Roy W.: The Village Indians of the Upper Missouri. The Mandans, Hidatsas, and Arikaras. Lincoln and London, 1977, p. 38. The assault and the Arikara War (1823) On 2 June 1823,Nichols, p. 143 Arikara warriors assaulted trappers working for General William Henry Ashley's Rocky Mountain Fur Company on the Missouri River, killing about 15 people. The surviving trappers retreated down the river and hid in shelters, where they stayed for more than a month. The United States responded with a combined force of 230 soldiers of the 6th Infantry, 750 Sioux allies, and 50 trappers and other company employeesJames A.

On 9 August 1823, Leavenworth arrived at the Arikara villages and commenced the attack using his Sioux cavalry, but this was held off by the Arikara. On 10 August, Leavenworth ordered an artillery bombardment. This was largely ineffective, the shots falling beyond the villages, at which point Leavenworth ordered an infantry attack. Like the Sioux auxiliaries, the regular infantry also failed to break into the villages. They left the battlefield with some captured horses and laden with corn taken from the farming Indians' fields.Serial 89, 18th Congress, 1st Session, Senate Document No. 1, p. 94 and p. 103. On 11 August 1823, Leavenworth negotiated a peace treaty: > \\"In making this treaty, I met with every possible difficulty which it was in > the power of the Missouri Fur Company to throw in my way.\\"Serial 89, 18th > Congress, 1st Session, Senate Document No. 1, p. 95 Fearing further attacks, the Arikara left the village that night. Leavenworth set off to return to Fort Atkinson on 15 August. The Arikara village was burned behind him by resentful members of the Missouri Fur Company, much to Leavenworth's anger.Jensen, Richard E. & James S. Hutchins: Wheel Boats on the Missouri.

Seven people drowned in the Missouri.Ney, Virgil: \\"Daily Life at Fort Atkinson - On the Missouri, 1820-1827.\\" Military Review. Vol. 57 (1977), pp. 50-66. Causes The causes of the war are not well recorded, but the trading relationship of the Arikara with white traders was certainly a factor. The Arikara lived in permanent settlements for most of the year where they farmed, fished and hunted buffalo on the surrounding plains. However, this was insufficient to sustain them and they relied on being a center of trade with neighboring tribes to survive. Ashley's expedition to directly acquire furs and pelts cut out the Arikara in their role as trading middle-men and was thus a direct threat to their livelihood. There was also the issue of their desire to have a trading post on their territory so that they could have easy access to manufactured goods. They resented the fact that their long-time enemies, the Sioux, had such posts, but they did not. Ashley had been asked to set up a trading post when he was in the area in 1822. Not wishing to limit his operations by having to maintain a permanent base, Ashley instead promised the Arikara that he would have the goods they asked for shipped to them directly from St. Louis. Ashley had not made good this promise at the time of his 1823 expedition, and possibly never intended to.Nichols, pp. 149-150 A further source of resentment, although probably not a direct cause of the war, was the death of the Arikara chief Ankedoucharo during a visit to Washington in 1806. Ankedoucharo died of natural causes, but it was widely believed among the Arikara that he was deliberately murdered.Nichols, p. 147 The initial episode at the Arikara villages on 2 June reached international level when some hinted, that the British Hudson's Bay Company was the mastermind behind it all. The plot, so some believed, was to put a wedge between the American fur traders and the Arikaras. The British denied this.Nasatir, A.P.: The International significance of the Jones and Immell Massacre and the Aricara Outbreak in 1823. Pacific Northwest Quarterly, Vol. 30 (Jan. 1939), pp. 77-108. Aftermath Cloud-Shield's winter count (Lakota). 1823-24. \\"They joined the whites in an expedition up the Missouri River against the Rees [Arikaras]\\". Hundreds of Sioux Indians were the first to side with the U.S. army in an Indian war west of the Missouri. The event is recorded in some of the winter counts of the Lakotas. The Arikara refugees returned the following spring, restoring the villages.Meyer, Roy W.: The Village Indians of the Upper Missouri. The Mandans, Hidatsas, and Arikaras. Lincoln and London, 1977, p. 276, note 61. The hostility between the United States and the Arikara ended officially on 18 July 1825, when the two opponents signed a peace treaty.Kappler, Charles J.: Indian Affairs. Laws and Treaties. Washington, 1904. Vol. 2, pp. 237-239. The U.S. Army and the Arikara never engaged in battle again. As for the Sioux, \\"the result of the [Leavenworth] expedition ruined the reputation of all whites in the eyes of the Indians\\".Jensen, Richard E. & James S. Hutchins: Wheel Boats on the Missouri. The Journals and Documents of the Atkinson-O'Fallon Expedition, 1824-26. Helena and Lincoln, 2001, p. 20. The Sioux continued to attack the Arikaras and press them north, from one village to another. In 1851, the western Sioux claimed the 1823 battleground as Lakota territory and later received formal treaty recognition on the former Arikara land.Kappler, Charles J.: Indian Affairs. Laws and Treaties. Washington, 1904. Vol. 2, p. 594. Although brief, the conflict was noted for two reasons: it was the first military conflict between the United States and Native Americans in the West, setting the tone for future encounters between whites and other Native American groups; and since Leavenworth did not completely defeat the Arikara, his leniency toward them sparked a great debate between white Americans demanding subjugation of the natives and those advocating for peaceful cohabitation. The Arikara eventually settled with the Mandan and Hidatsa on the Fort Berthold Reservation in North Dakota. Many Arikara and Crow people became Indian scouts during the height of the Sioux Wars. Archaeological work at the location of the Arikara villages (Leavenworth site (39CO9)) in 1932 gave a clue to the futile shelling of the earth lodges more than 100 years earlier. The upper stratums of earth hid a number of unexploded shells.Strong, William Duncan: From History to Prehistory in the Northern Great Plains. Smithsonian Miscellaneous Collections, Vol. 100. Washington, 1940, pp. 353-394, unexploded shells p. 366.  In the media  A fictionalized representation of the 1823 attack by the Arikara on the Rocky Mountain Fur Company appears in the 2015 film The Revenant from the perspective of trapper Hugh Glass.

B1 (Typ 32; 1972)  VW Passat B1 5-door (Europe) Volkswagen Passat B1 2-door (Europe) VW Passat Variant LS 1980 (Australia) The first generation Passat launched in 1973 in two- and four-door sedan and three- and five-door versions. Externally all four shared styling by Giorgetto Giugiaro. The first generation Passat was a fastback variant of the mechanically identical Audi 80 sedan, introduced a year earlier. A five-door station wagon was introduced in 1974, which in North American markets was sold as an Audi Fox. In Europe, the Passat was equipped with two rectangular, two round 7-inch, or four round 5.5-inch headlights depending on specification. The Passat was one of the most modern European family cars at the time, and was intended as a replacement for the ageing Volkswagen Type 3 and Type 4. The only other European cars of its size to feature front-wheel drive and a hatchback were the Renault 16 and Austin Maxi. The Passat originally featured the four-cylinder OHC 1.3-litre () and 1.5-litre (/) petrol engines also used in the Audi 80‚Äîlongitudinally mounted with front-wheel drive, in Audi tradition, with either a four-speed manual transmission or three-speed automatic. It had a MacPherson strut front suspension with a solid axle/coil spring setup at the rear. The SOHC 1.5-litre was enlarged to 1.6-litre in August 1975 with unchanged power ratings and slightly higher torque ratings. In July 1978, the Passat Diesel became available, equipped with the VW Golf's 1.5-litre diesel (), followed in February 1979 by the Passat GLI with a fuel-injected version of the 1.6-litre engine. The range received a facelift in 1977 (launched 1978 outside Europe) with revised interior and revised exterior with repositioned indicators and depending on model, either four round or two rectangular headlights. In North America, the car was marketed as the Volkswagen Dasher. The three-door hatchback, four-door sedan, and a station wagon model launched in North America for and during the 1974 model year. Sole available engine was a carburetted 1.5-litre inline-four developing (or in 1975), supplanted from model year 1976 by a Bosch fuel-injected 1.6-litre four . North American cars were equipped with single DOT standard headlights. In 1978, the Dasher received a facelift along the lines of the European Passat, with quad sealed beam headlights and big polyurethane covered bumpers. The trim was also upgraded and the ride softened. 1979 saw the introduction of the 1.5-litre diesel engine, which produced just 48 PS (35 kW) in the car. 0‚Äì100 km/h time for the Diesel was 19.4 seconds, 6.2 seconds slower than the gasoline (petrol) engine. All gasoline engines were dropped for North America in 1981, in preparation for the next generation. In Brazil, the Passat B1 was produced from June 1974 until 1988. Since the Audi 80 was not marketed in Brazil, the Passat received the Audi's different front-end treatment after a facelift for 1979. Originally with a 1.5-litre engine, during its long life cycle many improvements from the B2 platform were later introduced, like its 1.6 and 1.8-litre engines, a Brazil-specific face-lift in 1985, and a five-speed gearbox. A sports version, named Passat TS 1.6 and later Passat GTS 1.8 Pointer was also introduced.  B2 (Typ 32B; 1981)  Volkswagen Passat B2 wagon (Europe) Volkswagen Passat B2 hatchback (Europe) The second generation Passat launched in 1981. The platform, named B2, was once again based on the corresponding version of the Audi 80, which had been launched in 1978. The B2 Passat was slightly longer. In addition to the Passat hatchbacks and Variants (estate/wagon), there was also a conventional three-box saloon, which until the 1985 facelift was sold as the Volkswagen Santana in Europe. In the United States, the Passat/Santana was sold as the Volkswagen Quantum, available in three-door hatchback, four-door sedan, and a wagon model, but the five-door hatchback was never sold there and the three-door hatchback was dropped after less than two years. The four-wheel drive Syncro wagon version was introduced in October 1984, initially only with the more powerful five-cylinder engine. The Passat/Santana was also produced and commercialized in China, Mexico, South America and South Africa, too. In Mexico, it was marketed from 1984 to 1988 as VW Corsar and Corsar Variant (the 4-door saloon and 5-door wagon, respectively). In Argentina, from 1987 to 1991 as the VW Carat. In Brazil, the wagon model was badged VW Quantum. The Passat saloon and estate were produced in South Africa for the local market until 1987. Like the previous generation, the B2 Passat was mainly sold with four-cylinder petrol and diesel engines. Unlike its predecessor, however, top-of the line versions received five- cylinder Audi or VW engines of 1.9‚Äì2.2 litres. The 5-cylinder version was sold in the US as the Quantum GL-5. In addition to four- and five-speed manuals and three-speed automatic gearboxes, the Passat/Santana was also available with the VW concern's interesting 4+E transmission. This, also called the \\"Formel E\\" had a particularly high top gear, which combined with a freewheeling mechanism, provided better gas mileage. An automatic stop/start was also available in some markets. The four-wheel-drive system used in the Passat Variant Syncro shared the mechanics of the Audi 80 and not the Volkswagen Golf Syncro. The Syncro's bottom plate was almost entirely different, requiring a transmission tunnel, a relocated gas tank and no spare tire well (to make room for the complex rear axle assembly). Only the more popular estate was reengineered. Syncro was also available in the North American market, only with the five-cylinder engine. In 1985, the range received a slight facelift, consisting of new, larger bumpers, interior retouches, a new front grille and new taillights on the hatchback versions. The three-door hatchback was discontinued, while the Santana nameplate was dropped in Europe. The saloon's front end was now the same as the hatchback and estate. The North American version, still known as the Quantum, gained European-style composite headlamps. On 31 March 1988, production ended (although Syncro models continued in production until June) with 3,345,248 built in Germany. World production totaled approximately 4.5 million units.  B3 and B4 (Typ 35i; 1988)  Volkswagen Passat B3 sedan (Europe) Volkswagen Passat B4 Variant (United Kingdom) The third generation Passat was introduced in March 1988 in Europe, 1990 in North America, and 1995 in South America. The lack of a grille made the car's front end styling reminiscent of older, rear-engined Volkswagens, such as the 411, and also doubled as a modern styling trend. The styling was developed from the 1981 aerodynamic (cd 0.25) Auto 2000 concept car. At the time, it was the first transverse engine layout Passat to be built on a Volkswagen-designed platform, rather than sharing one with an Audi saloon. The car, although designated B3 in Volkswagen's platform nomenclature, was based largely on the A platform as used for the smaller Golf model, but was stretched in all directions, and therefore had no connection with the B3 series Audi 80, launched two years earlier. Many components are shared directly between these vehicles. This generation of Passat was sold as a four- door saloon or a five-door estate, with the Passat not being sold as a hatchback from this point onwards. It was marketed under the Passat name in all markets; in North America, this was a first. The fuel-injected petrol engines gave better performance and refinement than the carburettor units previously used. They were mounted transversely, and the floorpan was engineered to accept Volkswagen's 'Syncro' four-wheel drive system. Engine options were the 2.0-litre 16-valve engine in the GL model, 1.8-litre engine in the CL model (not available in North America, all CLs, GLs, and GLSs had the 2.0 16v), The 1.8 8v 112 bhp PB engine from the Golf GTi was also used in the Passat GT model. Volkswagen's new 2.8-litre VR6 engine (also used in the Golf and Corrado) in the GLX/GLS model (introduced in 1991 in Europe and 1992 in North America), and the G60 engine (only available on the Syncro model in Canada for the North American market). The VR6 engine gave the top-of-the- range Passat a top speed of . The 1.9-litre and the 1.6-litre diesel engine were also available as options. = 1993 facelift (Passat B4) = Volkswagen Passat B4 wagon (Europe) 1996 Volkswagen Passat B4 sedan (United Kingdom) The B3 Passat was heavily facelifted in 1993, and despite being designated B4, it was not an all-new model. The facelift revised external body panels except for the roof and glasshouse, with most obvious exterior change seeing the reintroduction of a grille to match the style of the other same-generation Volkswagen models of the era, such as the Mk3 Golf and Jetta. The interior was mildly updated and included safety equipment, such as dual front airbags and seat belt pretensioners, although the basic dashboard design remained unchanged. The grille was introduced to give the front end a more aggressive appearance, as the previous model looked too 'passive'. The car was available with a Turbocharged Direct Injection (TDI) diesel engine ‚Äì an inline four- cylinder 1.9-litre turbodiesel, generating at 3,750 rpm and of torque at 1,900 rpm. It carried a US EPA fuel efficiency rating for the sedan of highway. Combined with a reserve option fuel tank, the B4 TDI wagon had an 1800+ km (1200+ mi) range on a single tank of fuel. The B4 TDI wagon saw less than 1,000 sales in the US during its 1996 to 1997 lifespan.  B5 (Typ 3B, 1996) and B5.5 (3BG; 2000)  Volkswagen Passat B5 wagon (US) Volkswagen Passat B5 sedan (Australia) An all-new Passat, based on the Volkswagen Group B5 platform, was launched in 1996 in Continental Europe, in February 1997 in the United Kingdom, and 1998 in North America. Its PL45 platform was shared with the first-generation \\"Typ 8D\\" Audi A4, which was unveiled 2 years earlier, and saw a return to the Passat sharing its longitudinal engine layout platform with Audi's equivalent model for the first time since the second-generation (B2) Passat of 1981, which shared its platform with the second-generation \\"Typ 81\\" Audi 80/Audi 90 (the A4 is the successor to the Audi 80 line). The Passat introduced a new design language, first seen on the Concept 1 concept car, for the latest generation of Volkswagens, such as the Mk4 Golf, Bora and Polo Mk4. Aerodynamic work gave the B5 Passat a coefficient of drag of 0.27 (saloon model). The car featured a fully independent four-link front suspension; and a semi-independent torsion beam for front-wheel-drive models or a fully independent suspension on the 4motion 4WD models. 4WD was introduced in 1997 as an option for the 1.8-litre, 2.8-litre V6, 1.9-litre TDI, 2.0-litre TDI and 2.5-litre V6 TDI engines, using a second-generation Torsen T-2 based 4WD system to minimise loss of traction. The 1.8-litre petrol engine in the Passat and Audi A4 has a lower oil capacity than transverse applications of the same engine ( in transverse, longitudinal), and may suffer from oil sludge problems as a result, if not changed at regular intervals with fully synthetic oils. Four transmission options were available: a 5-speed manual transmission, a 6-speed manual transmission (codename 01E), a 4-speed automatic transmission and a 5-speed automatic transmission with tiptronic. The 1.6-litre petrol engine had been dropped by 1999, leaving the 1.8-litre 20-valve as the entry- level engine. = 2001 facelift (Passat B5.5 ‚Äì Typ 3BG) = Volkswagen Passat B5.5 Variant (Europe) 2003 Volkswagen Passat B5.5 SE V6 sedan (Australia) The B5.5 Passat began production in late 2000, with styling and mechanical revisions, including revised projector-optic headlights, bumpers, tail lights, and chrome trim. A 4.0-litre W8 engine producing was introduced in 2001 in a luxury version of the car that included standard 4motion all-wheel drive. This engine was intended to be a test bed for Volkswagen Group's new W engine technology, which would later make an appearance on the W12 in the Phaeton, Audi A8, and Bentley Continental GT, and the W16 engine in the Bugatti Veyron. The engine was discontinued in 2004.  B6 (Typ 3C; 2005) and B7 (2010)  Volkswagen Passat Sedan (Front) leftedan (Rear) left The B6 Passat was first displayed at the Geneva Motor Show in March 2005, and launched in Europe in the summer of 2005. Unlike its predecessor, the B6 Passat no longer shared its platform with Audi's equivalent model (the Audi A4). Based on a modified version of the Mk5 Golf's PQ35 platform (PQ46), the B6 featured a transverse rather than longitudinal engine layout of its predecessor, like the previous B3 and B4 generations, which were related to the A2 (Golf) platform. The added benefits of the PQ46 platform are especially evident in its incredibly stiff torsional rigidity rating, which places it closer to a 997 generation Porsche 911 than its own Golf stable-mate in terms of chassis stiffness. The transverse-engine layout of the four-wheel drive version, marketed as 4motion, dictated a switch from the Torsen centre differential of the B5, to the Haldex Traction multi-plate clutch. The change to the Haldex system also changes the handling closer to a front-wheel drive car. Compared to the Torsen, the Haldex can direct torque more unequally to the front wheels (from 100:0 to 50:50 front-to-rear bias), thus providing a wider bias range than the 75:25 to 25:75 of the B5 Passat. Haldex is a reactive-type system, behaving as a front-wheel- drive vehicle until slippage is detected, at which point up to a maximum of 50% of the torque can be transmitted to the rear axle. See the Audi-related quattro (four-wheel-drive system) article for more information. Fuel Stratified Injection is used in every petrol engined version of the Passat, ranging from 1.4 to 3.6 litres (the 1.6-litre DOHC can reach in 11.4 seconds, and for manual transmission versions), but the multi-valve 2.0-litre Turbocharged Direct Injection (TDI) diesel is the most sought after version in Europe (available in both and variants). In the US market, a 2.0-litre turbocharged I4 is the base engine, or a 3.6-litre VR6 engine as the upgrade, with six-speed manual (only available on the base 2.0-litre turbocharged model) and automatic transmissions. As of the 2009 model year, the VR6 engine and 4motion option were no longer available in the US on the Passat sedan and wagon, but are available on the Passat CC. In February 2008, the 2.0 FSI was replaced with the new Audi-developed 1.8-litre TSI engine and 6-speed automatic transmission. The 1.8-litre T is rated at and and accelerates from 0‚Äì100 km/h in 8.6 seconds, reaching a top speed of . At the same time the 2.0-litre TDI engine from the Audi range, incorporating common rail injection technology superseded the existing 2.0 litre TDI units. The common rail technology uses less fuel and is quieter in operation. This engine is part of the wider Volkswagen Group policy for engine sharing. The Passat Estate won overall winner of Practical Caravans Towcar of the Year Awards 2008 for its array of towing features such as its Trailer Stability Programme. In Asia, the PQ46 Passat was released by FAW-VW as the Magotan, after Volkswagen's other joint venture Shanghai Volkswagen had decided to continue using the B5 platform for the Passat and the Passat Lingyu (long-wheelbase Passat). Since August 2010, the wagon version of Passat B6 will be offered in Asia, which is a fully imported model. But this car is simply called Volkswagen Variant in China, in order not to refer the name \\"Passat\\" or \\"Magotan\\". Exclusive to Europe, Japan, Australia and New Zealand was a limited edition Passat R36, which featured a 3.6-litre V6 engine. This version of the Passat put out 300 hp, and featured dual exhaust tips, an aggressive front bonnet, and All Wheel Drive. = Passat CC = Volkswagen CC 130TDI sedan (Australia) Volkswagen CC 130TDI sedan (Australia) The CC (\\"Comfort Coup√©\\") is a 4-door coup√© version of the Passat. It debuted at the 2008 North American International Auto Show in Detroit. Originally aimed at competing with the similarly styled Mercedes CLS, the Passat CC intends to be more stylish and luxurious than the previously released Passat B6. In the US, the name Passat was dropped, and the car was being sold as just CC. Some options specific to the CC include hands-free parking, lane-departure prevention, intelligent cruise control, and adaptive suspension. Engines offered in the CC mirror those of the regular Passat, with options of the base 2.0 litre turbocharged four-cylinder, or the optional 3.6-litre VR6, which includes 4-motion all-wheel drive. The Chinese-made CC was released by FAW-VW on 15 July 2010. Two engine options are provided: 1.8 litre T and 2.0 litre T. Volkswagen facelifted the Passat CC in late 2011 for the 2012 year, with styling updates akin to those of the larger Phaeton. For the updated model, Volkswagen has dropped the Passat name for all markets, now matching the Volkswagen CC branding used since 2008 in North America. = 2010 facelift (Passat B7) = The B6 Passat was facelifted by Klaus Bischoff and Walter de Silva, Facelifted Volkswagen B6 Passat and was unveiled at the Paris Motor Show in September 2010. Although designated \\"B7\\" by VW enthusiasts, the car is not an all-new model. The facelift resulted in new external body panels except for the roof and glasshouse, with the prominent changes to the grille and headlights. Overall height and width dimensions are unchanged from the B6 Passat, while length increases by 4 mm. New features include Adaptive Chassis Control (DCC), Dynamic Light Assist glare-free high beams, a fatigue detection system and an automatic \\"city emergency braking\\" system. It arrived at dealerships in January 2011. The interior featured minor detail changes from the B6, although the basic dashboard design remained unchanged. In India, the B6 version is likely to be replaced with the B7 version. Also the FAW-VW-built Magotan will also be replaced by a long-wheelbase version of the Passat B7. The new model will be exclusive to the Indian market, and at least 100 mm longer than the European B7. In China, the FAW-VW-built Magotan will also be replaced by a long-wheelbase version of the Passat B7. The new model will be exclusive to the Chinese market, and at least 100 mm longer than the European B7. Engines available for Magotan B7L are ranging from 1.4-litre T, 1.8-litre T to 2.0-litre T, a special-developed EA390 3.0-litre VR6 FSI engine is opted for the top model. In Malaysia, Volkswagen Global had authorised DRB-HICOM for assembly in the Pekan facility beginning 2011. The Passat was the best-selling model of Volkswagen Malaysia in 2012 and 2013. = Passat Alltrack = Volkswagen Alltrack B7 (Europe) Volkswagen Alltrack B7 (Europe) Volkswagen Alltrack B8 (Europe) Volkswagen Alltrack B8 (Europe) In October 2010, Volkswagen presented at the 2011 Tokyo Motor Show the Passat Alltrack. The Passat Alltrack bridges the gap between the passenger VW range and the SUV range comprising the Tiguan and Touareg. The Passat Alltrack was aimed at competing with Subaru Outback, which created a new market niche. They (Alltrack & Outback) both bear resemblance in ride height and external body kit. The Passat Alltrack has raised ground clearance from 135 to 165 mm which improves approach angle from 13.5 to 16 degrees, departure angle from 11.9 to 13.6 degrees and ramp angle from 9.5 to 12.8 degrees when compared to the standard Passat wagon. Passat Alltrack is the only VW in the passenger range to offer 4Motion with off-road driving programme, the off-road system works in conjunction with the ABS, electronic differential lock (EDL), DSG & hill descent assist system to control the vehicle in an off-road expedition. The engine range of the Passat Alltrack consists of two 2.0 litre TDI with outputs of 103 kW/140 hp & 125 kW/170 hp and two petrol engines, 1.8-litre producing 118 kW/160 hp and 2.0 litre TSI producing 155 kW/207 hp. The TDI models come standard with BlueMotion Technology packages with Stop/Start system and battery regeneration mode for recovering braking energy. The two lesser powered engine variants 2.0 litre TDI and 1.8-litre TSI are only available in front wheel drive format with a manual 6 speed transmission. The rest of the range with 4Motion has a 6 speed DSG automated manual transmission, except the 2.0 litre TDI with 103 kW/140 hp has an option of 6 speed manual. In 2012 at the New York Auto Show, VW showed a Passat Alltrack with 2.0 litre TDI 125 kW/170 hp under Alltrack Concept nameplate to gauge response for a future market in the off-road wagon segment. = DARPA driverless edition = A driverless version of the Passat Wagon finished second in the 2007 DARPA Urban Challenge. In spring 2015, Swiss telecommunications company Swisscom tested the driverless Volkswagen Passat on the streets of Zurich.  B8 (Typ 3G; 2015‚Äìpresent)  Volkswagen Passat (B8) SE sedan Volkswagen Passat (B8) Highline Variant The eighth generation model of the Passat was introduced in November 2014 in Continental Europe and in January 2015 in the United Kingdom as a four-door saloon and estate. Following other Volkswagen Group passenger vehicles such as the Volkswagen Golf Mk7, it is based on a stretched variant of the MQB platform, a modular automobile construction platform designed for transverse, front-engined cars. To reduce weight, lightweight materials such as aluminium and vacuum-formed steel have been utilised. According to the chairman of the board of Volkswagen, Martin Winterkorn, the B8 is \\"a premium car without the premium price\\", indicating that the Passat nameplate was moved to the compact executive car segment, as opposed to the previous generation models that were conceived as large family cars., although some auto journalists have criticised this strategy since it effectively puts the Passat in competition with the Audi A6. The Passat was introduced with a great number of advanced driver-assistance systems, including a semi-automatic parking system, emergency driver assistant, which will automatically take control of the vehicle if the driver has suffered a medical emergency, autonomous cruise control system for highway speeds up to 210 km/h, a collision avoidance system with pedestrian monitoring and variable ratio steering marketed as \\"progressive steering\\" which will adjust the steering gear ratios in relation to the current speed. The engine line-up of the Passat B7 was re-introduced with this generation with slightly increased power outputs, variable displacement for the 1.4-litre TSI petrol engine and two selective catalytic reduction (SCR) diesel engines, with one being twin-turbocharged. A plug-in hybrid, the Passat GTE, with an updated battery pack from the Golf GTE and Audi A3 Sportback e-tron is scheduled for launch in mid-2015 in the United Kingdom with sales commencing in 2016. Led by new chief of design Walter de Silva and VW's acquisition of coachbuilder Bertone, the 2015 Passat won the 2015 European Car of the Year award.  Other versions  = Volkswagen Passat Lingyu (China; 2005‚Äì2015) = Volkswagen Passat Lingyu (pre-facelift) The Passat Lingyu is a restyled version of the first generation ≈†koda Superb for the Chinese market. Manufactured by SAIC Volkswagen, the Passat Lingyu was introduced in 2005, succeeding the Passat B5. The car was designed by Istanbul-born car designer Murat G√ºnak. In 2009, a facelifted version was introduced as the Passat New Lingyu (Xinlingyu). Production lasted until 2015, while it was sold alongside the newer Passat NMS starting from 2011. Volkswagen built 20 examples of a fuel-cell Passat Lingyu in mid-2008 to be presented at the 2008 Beijing Olympics. = Passat NMS (North America and China; 2011‚Äìpresent) = The Passat branches off into two models starting from 2011, the one being the model marketed mainly in Europe and right-hand drive markets, and in China as the Magotan, and the other called the Passat NMS that is built for the North American and Chinese market. This model is more downscale compared to the European Passat to achieve a lower price point in order to penetrate the mainstream mid-size sedan market. The Passat NMS model was split again in 2019 as the Chinese version moved on to the MQB platform, while the North American model continued to be produced above the old platform, as the decline of the sedan market in North America has deterred further investments of a MQB-based Passat for the region.  First generation (2011)  Volkswagen Passat (first generation pre-facelift, United States) Known as the New Midsize Sedan (NMS) before its unveiling in January 2011, this model was designed for the North American market, replacing the B6 Passat sedan and wagon At its introduction, the Passat NMS was part of Volkswagen Group's strategy to sell over 800,000 vehicles per year in the North American market. The Passat NMS is marketed in the North America, South Korea, Middle East, and China, with no plans for a wagon/estate version. North American, Middle Eastern and South Korean models are manufactured at its Chattanooga Assembly Plant. In China, the new model is built by SAIC- Volkswagen in its Nanjing factory and is marketed as a more upscale model with some interior and exterior differences to the North American model, such as wood-trimmed steering wheel, rear air vents, and LED accented headlights. It was sold alongside models such as the long-wheelbase version of the European Passat known as the Magotan and a B5 Passat-based Passat Lingyu.  Second generation (North America, 2019)  Volkswagen Passat (second generation, United States)A new Passat for the North American market was released in 2019 as a 2020 model. The 2020 Volkswagen Passat NMS was completely redesigned except for the platform and powertrain featuring revised exterior styling, new wheel and tire combinations. Every metal stamping in the exterior was replaced, except the roof stamping. It is equipped with more standard safety and technology features, which include a suite of standard driver assistance technologies, and a 6.33-inch glass-covered touchscreen infotainment system with next-generation VW CarNet 4G LTE in-vehicle telematics. The second generation is still powered by a 174-horsepower, 2.0-liter TSI I4 gasoline engine and six-speed automatic transmission from the first generation. Second generation (China, 2019)  Volkswagen Passat (second generation, China) Revealed on October 12, 2018 by SAIC Volkswagen, the Chinese market 2019 Passat was built on the newer Volkswagen Group MQB platform. Despite the high resemblance between the Chinese and North American Passats, they are completely different models based on different platforms. The model replaces the Volkswagen Passat NMS in China, while the European version which is called the Magotan would be sold separately.https://www.autohome.com.cn/tech/201901/928624.html Trim levels are known as the 280TSI, 330TSI and 380TSI. 280TSI models receive the 1.4 litre EA211 engine, while 330TSI and 380TSI models receive the 2.0-litre EA888 engine. All models are available with 7-speed DSG gearbox as standard.

Early life Edward Irving was born at Annan, Annandale the second son of Gavin Irving, a tanner, and his wife, Mary Lowther of Dornock.https://archive.org/stream/fastiecclesiaesc00scot/fastiecclesiaesc00scot_djvu.txt On his father's side, who followed the occupation of a tanner, he was descended from a family long known in the district which had ties to French Huguenot refugees. His mother's side, the Lowthers, were farmers or small proprietors in Annandale. The first stage of his education was passed at a school kept by Peggy Paine, a relation of Thomas Paine, after which he entered the Annan Academy taught by Adam Hope. Scotland At the age of thirteen he entered the University of Edinburgh. In 1809 he graduated M.A.; and in 1810, on the recommendation of Sir John Leslie, he was chosen master of the mathematical school, newly established at Haddington, East Lothian. Amongst his pupils there was Jane Welsh, afterwards famous as Mrs Carlyle, one of the great letter-writers of the nineteenth century. He became engaged in 1812 to Isabella Martin, but he gradually fell in love with Jane Welsh, and she with him. He tried to get out of his engagement with Isabella, but was prevented by her family. It was Irving, ironically, who in 1821 had introduced Thomas Carlyle, the essayist, to her. Eventually, in 1823, he married Isabella. (Confusingly, Irving was also influential in the life of another Scottish Thomas Carlyle, born a few years later, whom he eventually gave a position of some responsibility within his new church.) His appointment at Haddington was exchanged for a similar one at Kirkcaldy Academy in Fife, in 1812. Completing his divinity studies by a series of partial sessions, he was licensed to preach in June 1815, but continued to discharge his scholastic duties for three years. He devoted his leisure, not only to mathematical and physical science, but to a course of reading in English literature, his bias towards the antique in sentiment and style being strengthened by a perusal of the older classics, among whom Richard Hooker was his favorite author. At the same time his love of the marvellous found gratification in the wonders of the Arabian Nights, and it is further characteristically related of him that he used to carry continually in his waistcoat pocket a miniature copy of Ossian, passages from which he frequently recited with sonorous elocution and vehement gesticulation. In the summer of 1818, he resigned his mastership and, in order to increase the probability of obtaining a permanent appointment in the Church of Scotland, took up his residence in Edinburgh. Although his exceptional method of address seems to have gained him the qualified approval of certain dignitaries of the church, the prospect of his obtaining a settled charge seemed as remote as ever. He was meditating a missionary tour in Persia when his departure was arrested by steps taken by Thomas Chalmers which, after considerable delay, resulted in October 1819 in Irving being appointed his assistant and missionary in St John's parish, Glasgow. Except in the case of a select few, Irving's preaching awakened little interest among the congregation of St John's. Chalmers himself, with no partiality for its bravuras and flourishes, compared it to Italian music, appreciated only by connoisseurs; but as a missionary among the poorer classes he wielded an influence that was altogether unique. The benediction \\"Peace be to this house\\", with which, in accordance with apostolic usage, he greeted every dwelling he entered, was not inappropriate to his figure and aspect, and it is said he took the people's attention wonderfully, the more especially after the magic of his personality found opportunity to reveal itself in close and homely intercourse. London Edward Irving, in a sketch published in September 1823. This half-success in a subordinate sphere was, however, so far from coinciding with his aspirations that he had again, in the winter of 1821, begun to turn his attention towards missionary labour in the East, when the possibility of fulfilling the dream of his life was suddenly revealed to him by an invitation from the Caledonian Church, Hatton Garden, London (now the Lumen Church, Bloomsbury), to make trial and proof of his gifts before the remnant of the congregation that held together. Over that charge, he was ordained in July 1822. Some years previously, he had expressed his conviction that one of the chief needs of the age was to make inroad after the alien, to bring in the votaries of fashion, of literature, of sentiment, of policy and of rank, who are content in their several idolatries to do without piety to God and love to Him whom He hath sent; and, with an abruptness which must have produced on him at first an effect almost astounding, he now had the satisfaction of beholding these various votaries thronging to hear from his lips the words of wisdom which would deliver them from their several idolatries and remodel their lives according to the fashion of apostolic times. This sudden leap into popularity seems to have been occasioned in connection with a veiled allusion to Irving's striking eloquence made in the House of Commons by George Canning, who had been induced to attend his church from admiration of an expression in one of his prayers, quoted to him by Sir James Mackintosh. His commanding stature, the symmetry of his form, the dark and melancholy beauty of his countenance, rather rendered piquant than impaired by an obliquity of vision, produced an imposing impression even before his deep and powerful voice had given utterance to its melodious thunders; and harsh and superficial half-truths enunciated with surpassing ease and grace of gesture, and not only with an air of absolute conviction but also with the authority of a prophetic messenger, in tones whose magical fascination was inspired by an earnestness beyond all imitation of art, acquired a plausibility and importance which, at least while the orator spoke, made his audience entirely forgetful of their preconceived objections against them. The subject-matter of his orations, and his peculiar treatment of his themes, no doubt also, at least at first, constituted a considerable part of his attractive influence. Caricature of Edward Irving's preaching by Isaac Robert Cruikshank (1824). He had specially prepared himself, as he thought, for teaching imaginative men, and political men, and legal men, and scientific men who bear the world in hand; and he did not attempt to win their attention to abstract and worn-out theological arguments, but discussed the opinions, the poetry, the politics, the manners and customs of the time, and this not with philosophical comprehensiveness, not in terms of warm eulogy or measured blame, but of severe satire varied by fierce denunciation, and with a specific minuteness which was concerned primarily with individuals. A fire of criticism from pamphlets, newspapers and reviews opened on his volume of Orations, published in 1823; but the excitement produced was merely superficial and essentially evanescent. Though cherishing a strong antipathy to the received ecclesiastical formulas, Irving's great aim was to revive the antique style of thought and sentiment which had hardened into these formulas, and by this means to supplant the new influences, the accidental and temporary moral shortcomings of which he detected with instinctive certainty, but whose profound and real tendencies were utterly beyond the reach of his conjecture. Being thus radically at variance with the main current of the thought of his time, the failure of the commission he had undertaken was sooner or later inevitable; and shortly after the opening of his new church in Regent Square in 1827, he found that fashion had taken its departure, and the church, though always well filled, was no longer crowded. By this desertion his self-esteem, one of his strongest passions, though curiously united with singular sincerity and humility, was doubtless hurt to the quick; but the wound inflicted was of a deeper and deadlier kind, for it confirmed him finally in his despair of the world's gradual amelioration, and established his tendency towards supernaturalism. Forerunner of the Catholic Apostolic Church For years the subject of prophecy had occupied much of Irving's thoughts, and his belief in the near approach of the second advent had received such positive corroboration by the perusal of the work of a Jesuit priest, Manuel Lacunza, writing under the assumed Jewish name of \\"Juan Josafat Ben-Ezra\\", that in 1827 he published a translation of it, accompanied with an eloquent preface. Probably the religious opinions of Irving, originally in some respects more catholic and truer to human nature than generally prevailed in ecclesiastical circles, had gained breadth and comprehensiveness from his intercourse with Samuel Taylor Coleridge but gradually his chief interest in Coleridge's philosophy centred round what was mystical and obscure, and to it in all likelihood may be traced his initiation into the doctrine of millenarianism. The first stage of his later development which resulted in the establishment of the Irvingite or Holy Catholic Apostolic Church in 1832 was associated with the Albury Conferences (1826‚Äì30), moderated by Hugh Boyd M‚ÄòNeile (1795‚Äì1879), at his friend Henry Drummond's seat, Albury Park at Albury, Surrey concerning unfulfilled prophecy, followed by an almost exclusive study of the prophetical books and especially of the Apocalypse, and by several series of sermons on prophecy both in London and the provinces. His apocalyptic lectures in 1828 crowding the largest churches of Edinburgh on summer mornings. In 1830, however, there was opened up to his ardent imagination a new vista of things spiritual, a new hope for the age in which he lived, by the revival in a remote corner of Scotland of those apostolic gifts of prophecy and healing which he had already in 1828 persuaded himself had only been kept in abeyance by the absence of faith. At once, he welcomed the new powers with an unquestioning evidence that could be shaken by neither the remonstrances nor the desertions of his dearest friends, the recantation of some of the principal agents of the gifts, his own descent into a subordinate position, the meagre and barren results of the manifestations, nor their general rejection both by the church and the world. His excommunication by the presbytery of London in 1830 for publishing his doctrines of the humanity of Jesus Christ, and the condemnation of these opinions by the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland in the following year, were secondary episodes that only affected the main issue of his career insofar as they further isolated him from the sympathy of the church; but the irregularities connected with the manifestation of the gifts gradually estranged the majority of his own congregation, and on the complaint of the trustees to the presbytery of London, whose authority they had formerly rejected, he was declared unfit to remain the minister of the National Scotch Church of Regent Square. After he and those who adhered to him (describing themselves as of the Holy Catholic Apostolic Church) had in 1832 removed to a new building in Newman Street, he was, in March 1833, deposed from the ministry of the Church of Scotland by the Presbytery of Annan on the original charge of heresy. Having been expelled from the Church of Scotland, Irving took to preaching in the open air in Islington, until a new church was built for him and his followers in Duncan Street, Islington. It was funded by Duncan Mackenzie of Barnsbury, a former elder of Irving's London church, and built by the Holborn firm of Stevenson & Ramage. It closed in the 1970s. With the sanction of the power, he was now, after some delay, reordained chief pastor of the church assembled in Newman Street, but unremitting labours and ceaseless spiritual excitement soon completely exhausted the springs of his vital energy. He died, worn out and wasted with labour and absorbing care while still in the prime of life, 7 December 1834. He is buried in the crypt of Glasgow Cathedral near to the tomb of St. Mungo.

His father was the Mthethwa king, Jobe kaKayi. It was under Dingiswayo that the Mthethwa rose to prominence, mostly employing diplomacy and assimilation of nearby chiefdoms to strengthen his power base. According to Muzi Mthethwa (1995), the Mthethwas are descended from the Nguni tribes of northern Natal and the Lubombo Mountains, whose modern identity dates back some 700 years.Muzi Mthethwa (1995), \\"The History of abakwaMthethwa, Research Project\\", Department of History, University of Zululand. Lineage Dingiswayo's lineage is of the Mthethwa tribe, which extends all the way to Mthethwa the first. It is possible that Dingiswayo and Zwide kaLanga shared the same lineage through Xaba KaMadungu. Zwide himself was the king of the Ndwandwe, Khumalo, Msene, and Jele tribes - all of whom were subjugated under Zwide's rule (There does not appear to be a direct family link between Zwide kaLanga and Soshangane kaZikode of the Nxumalo tribe). Dingiswoyo's Mthethwa family line can be easily identified as indicated by Muzi Mthethwa (1995):Muzi Mthethwa (1995), \\"The History of abakwaMthethwa, Research Project\\", Department of History, University of Zululand. * Dingiswayo * Jobe * Khayi * Xaba * Madungu * Simamane and Wengwe * Ndlovu * Khubazi * Nyambose * Mthethwa Early life We first hear of Godongwana during the wanderings of Nandi and her illegitimate son Shaka, who settled with the Mthethwa under King Jobe. Godongwana and his brother, Tana, plotted against their father Jobe, but their plot was discovered. Tana was killed and Godongwana made his escape. Nursed back to health by a sister, the young man found refuge in the foothills of the Drakensberg among the Qwabe and Langeni people. He changed his name to Dingiswayo, which means \\"he who is troubled\\", or \\"The Wanderer\\". Upon the death of his father, he returned to claim the chieftainship. Chief of the Mthethwas He found his brother Mawewe in power. He displaced him without resistance. Mawewe fled, but was lured back and killed. He observed a troop of Khoikhoi under Lieutenant Donovan which had accompanied Doctor Cowan. Cowan was murdered by chief Phakathwayo, while their expedition attempted to reach Portuguese territory via Natal, and Dingiswayo subsequently acquired Cowan's horse and gun.MacKeurtan, G. The Cradle Days of Natal (1497-1845). Pietermaritzburg. 1948 Dingiswayo's new military tactics were an adoption of western techniques of drills and formation movements under a chain of command. With Shaka as his general, he attacked the Amangwane under Matiwane about 1812 and drove them across the Buffalo river. It was the first of the Mfecane migrations - tribes displaced, latterly by the Zulus, and who in turn displaced others in a series of internecine wars. Dingiswayo combined a number of smaller tribes to oppose his chief rival to the north, Chief Zwide of the Ndwandwe. Death and legacy In 1816 Shaka returned to the Zulu to claim chieftainship, while still recognising the larger Mthethwa and Dingiswayo as overlord. However, in the course of an attempted invasion of Zwide's territory, Dingiswayo was captured and beheaded by Zwide at Ngome, near Nongoma. His personal possessions were buried in his kraal. Dingiswayo's grave is on the north bank of the Tugela River, in KheKheKhe's kraal. The Mthethwa forces were defeated and scattered temporarily, with the remnants reforming under Shaka. Zwide was later defeated by Shaka in the Zulu Civil War. Dingiswayo's career marked a watershed in the history of south-east Africa. During his exile he was exposed to European ideas and he put these into practice to produce a disciplined and highly organised army for the first time in the region. After his death, Shaka extended these ideas to create a rigidly disciplined society to complement Dingiswayo's military reforms.Longman History of Southern Africa, Longman Publishing, 1978 References Category:Mthethwa people Category:1780 births Category:1817 deaths Category:19th-century Zulu people Category:History of KwaZulu-Natal ","title":"Dingiswayo"},{"id":"554369","text":"The Edge Act is a 1919 amendment to the United States Federal Reserve Act of 1913, codified at , which allows national banks to engage in international banking through subsidiaries chartered by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. The act is named after Walter Evans Edge, a U.S. Senator from New Jersey who sponsored the original legislation for these types of subsidiaries. The impetus for the act was to give U.S. firms more flexibility to compete with foreign firms. Edge Act Corporation (EAC) An Edge Act Corporation is a subsidiary of a bank or bank holding company or financial holding company, that is chartered by the Federal Reserve under Section 25A of the Federal Reserve Act, as amended in 1916 and 1919, to engage in foreign banking activities. The Federal Reserve Board authorizes U.S. and foreign banking and financial organizations to establish Edge Act Corporations. It also regulates and examines the foreign activities of Edge Act Corporations and their subsidiaries. Foreign banks operating in the U.S. are permitted to organize and own an Edge Act Corporation. An Edge Act Corporation is useful because, among other things, it separates the risks of domestic operations from those of international. Prior to 1919, U.S. institutions were not permitted to own foreign banks. An EAC can own branches in the U.S., but may only conduct transactions directly linked to international trade. =Structure= By virtue of historical developments and funding considerations, an Edge Act Corporation is a domestic subsidiary that is generally held by a U.S. Member Bank; however, it may also be held directly by the bank holding company or financial holding Company. As of the International Banking Act of 1978 (IBA), an Edge Act Corporation may also be held by a Foreign Bank. =Types= * Banking Edge or Agreement Corporation, which is directly under control of a U.S. member bank or bank holding company, can receive deposits (without Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation coverage) from, and make loans to, companies engaging in international business. This structure allows foreign branches of U.S. banks. * Investment Edge or Agreement Corporation functions as an investment company, taking equity positions in foreign commercial and industrial organizations; An Agreement Corporation is chartered by a state to engage in international banking (essentially a state-chartered EAC, so named because the corporation enters into an \\"agreement\\" with the Fed's Board of Governors to limit its activities to those of an Edge Act Corporation, as if organized under Section 25A of the Federal Reserve Act. In reality, state supervision is superfluous, so Edge Act Corporations (rather than Agreement Corporations) are the vehicles of choice for international banking and financing operations. Investment Edges expand the types of companies in which their parent banks may invest. By law, U.S. banks may invest abroad only in other banking organizations. However an Edge Act Corporation may invest in any type of foreign company, as long as it does not engage in business in the United States, including making any domestic loans. Banking Edges extend the geographic reach of their parents because an Edge was not considered a bank and hence was not subject to the same interstate banking prohibitions. Thus in the 1960s, the trend was for banks from outside the state of New York to form Banking Edges and locate them in New York City for conducting international banking and for trading in foreign exchange. In the 1970s and 1980s, the trend was toward expansion into regional financial centers, such as Miami, Chicago, and San Francisco. Legislation in the mid-1990s, providing for the removal of Federal Interstate Branching restrictions, undermined the appeal of Banking Edges, and their relative importance in international banking has therefore declined. Major disadvantages of a Banking Edge, compared with an agency, are the smaller size of its loans (due to its smaller capital base, compared with that of the agency's parent bank) and the limitation of domestic lending ability to international or foreign business transactions. Of the 82 Edge and Agreement Corporations in operation at year-end 1999, 27 were Banking Edges located mostly in New York City and Miami with total assets of $18 billion. =Largest Edges= As of 1999, the three largest Edges were all holding companies under the Federal Reserve Regulatory District of New York. *HSBC International Finance Corporation, an Investment Edge (Wilmington, Delaware) :HSBC Holdings plc (London) *Citibank International, a Banking Edge (Miami) :Citigroup Inc.

The Columbia Electronic Encyclopedia, 6th ed. 2007. While often referred to as Irvingism or the Irvingian movement, it was neither founded nor anticipated by Edward Irving, who died in December 1834. The church was organised in 1835 under the lead of self-proclaimed apostles. Within the movement the Catholic Apostolic Church referred to the very large community of Christians who follow the Nicene Creed. Those outside used the name to refer to the ecumenical prayer movement at its height in the early 19th century, accompanied by what were regarded by the said movement as outpourings of spiritual gifts in Great Britain (and elsewhere, though swiftly repressed by the local church authorities in other countries) including the making of new apostles to be followed, subsidiary to the twelve apostles during the Ministry of Jesus Christ. History =Early history= James Haldane Stewart The impulse to the prayer movement in the 1820s was given (among others) by the Anglican priest James Haldane Stewart. He made an appeal to this by means of more than half a million pamphlets which were spread throughout Great Britain, the United States and Europe. They longed for renewed spiritual power, as had been visible in the first century after the outpouring of the Holy Spirit in the young church. This movement was by no means restricted to the British Isles, with similar investigations and prayers being offered in France, Germany and elsewhere. In the same period, the Presbyterian John McLeod Campbell preached in Scotland, contrary to the prevailing Calvinist orthodoxy, that Christ died for the salvation of all (unlimited atonement) and not only for a small, predetermined group of individuals known as the \\"elect\\" (limited atonement). In 1830, prophetic utterances were recorded in Port Glasgow, Scotland, among dissenters and Karlshuld, Bavaria, among Roman Catholics. These took the form of prophecy, speaking in tongues and miraculous healing. They were regarded as the answer to the prayers many had prayed. These occurrences spread in Scotland and England where certain ministers allowed their practice, although they were not approved of by existing church authorities. However, they died out in Bavaria under the opposition of the responsible clergy. =Edward Irving= Edward Irving, also a minister in the Church of Scotland and supporter of Campbell, preached in his church at Regent Square in London on the speedy return of Jesus Christ and the real substance of his human nature. He attracted thousands of listeners, even from the highest circles, and during his summer tours in Scotland (1827, 1828) believers came to listen to him with tens of thousands in attendance. Irving's relationship to this community was, according to its members, somewhat similar to that of John the Baptist to the early Christian Church. He was hailed by his followers as the forerunner of a coming dispensation, not the founder of a new sect. Around him, as well as around other congregations of different origins, coalesced persons who had been driven out of other churches, wanting to \\"exercise their spiritual gifts\\". Shortly after Irving's trial and deposition (1831), he restarted meetings in a hired hall in London, and much of his original congregation followed him. Having been expelled from the Church of Scotland, Irving took to preaching in the open air in Islington, until a new church was built for him and his followers in Duncan Street, Islington, funded by Duncan Mackenzie of Barnsbury, a former elder of Irving's London church. These, over the course of the next two years, accepting the presence of restored \\"apostles\\" and guided by claimed words of prophecy, saw Edward Irving officially installed as their bishop. This congregation became known as the \\"Central Church\\", one of seven that were defined in London as forming a pattern of the whole Christian Church. =Separation of the apostles and their \\"testimony\\"= Within the congregations mentioned, over the course of a short time, six persons were designated as apostles by certain others who claimed prophetic gifts. In 1835, six months after Irving's death, six others were similarly designated as called to complete the number of the twelve. Since all those so designated were acting to one degree or another in local congregations, they were then formally separated from these duties, by the bishops of the seven congregations, to occupy their higher office in the universal church on 14 July 1835. The names of those considered new apostles were: John Bate Cardale, Henry Drummond, Henry King-Church, Spencer Perceval, Nicholas Armstrong, Francis Woodhouse (Francis Valentine Woodhouse), Henry Dalton, John Tudor (John O. Tudor), Thomas Carlyle, Francis Sitwell, William Dow and Duncan Mackenzie. These, together with the seven congregations in London, the coadjutors of the apostles, formed what was known as the \\"Universal Church\\". The seat of the apostolic college was at Albury, near Guildford. They retired there immediately after their separation to set in order the worship and prepare a \\"testimony\\" of their work. This was presented to the spiritual and temporal rulers in various parts of Christendom in 1836, beginning with an appeal to the bishops of the Church of England, then in a more comprehensive form to the Pope and other leaders in Christendom, including the Emperor of Austria-Hungary, the Tsar of Russia, the kings of France, Prussia, Denmark and Sweden, as well as King William IV of England. The apostles declared that the Christian Church was the body of all that had been baptized in the name of the Father, Son and Holy Ghost, thus laying aside all divisions between nominal Christians, and that the apostolate had been restored for setting the whole body of Christianity in order to be ready for the Second Coming of Christ; therefore, they called upon all the clergy and lay authorities to recognise this and submit to their self-appointment as \\"apostles\\". Structure and ministries =Apostles= The apostles were regarded as the conveyors of the Holy Spirit, the declarers of the mysteries of God, and the authoritative interpreters of prophetic utterance; acting in concert they were the source of doctrine and the demonstrators of the mind of Christ. Their teaching was brought to the people by the evangelists and pastors, and by the ministers of the local churches for those who accepted their ministry. Each apostle would have one coadjutor, who was used to travel through areas of his responsibility and represent the apostle in conferences. =Grades of ministry and ordination= The ministry was exclusively male, on the grounds of the headship of the man over the woman as laid down by God in Genesis. All ministers had to be called by the word of prophecy to their place; this was still elective, in that frequent opportunity was given to present oneself as willing to take on a role in the ministry, and also that any direct call could be refused, though in practice this was extremely rare. All ministers had to be ordained by the apostles or their delegates; after they had been called and responded faithfully, a date would be set for their ordination. Three grades of ordained ministry were recognised: bishop, priest, and deacon. Ministers could be reassigned from one congregation to another by word of prophecy, except for inducted bishops who were considered to be \\"married\\" to the congregation of which they had charge. Each rank had different vestments to differentiate their function. It also occurred that people would be called to an office (say, that of priest) but would fulfil a lower rank (say, that of deacon) until it became clear where they would serve. This clarification was either prophetic or practical in character‚Äîif a priest was needed somewhere such a person might be asked to take up the role, or a special mission might be accorded. All grades were allowed to preach sermons and homilies. All sermons were referred to the apostles in order to ensure that the teachings were in accordance with the Bible, revealed truth, and the apostles' doctrine. The Catholic Apostolic Church had among its clergy many clerics of the Roman Catholic, Anglican and other churches. The orders of those ordained by Greek, Roman, Lutheran, Presbyterian and Anglican bishops were recognized by the simple confirmation of their ordination through an apostolic act. Bishops A bishop was in charge of only one congregation, though others might be under his care until they too could be put under the care of their own bishop. A bishop was titled \\"angel\\" (following the passage in Revelation, chapters 2 and 3), defined as \\"a bishop who has been ordained by an Apostle\\". All local ministers were subject to him, and he was responsible for the welfare of the congregations committed to his charge. While the angels had full authority within their congregations, it was expected that, having received the apostles, they would acknowledge the apostles' oversight, doctrine and forms of worship. Each angel could have one \\"help\\" or \\"coadjutor\\" who would also be of the rank of angel. If an angel had been sent to take charge of a congregation, he could not be inducted until that congregation had accepted him. If the congregation outgrew itself, subsidiary local congregations could be formed each with their angel and ministries. These were limited to four in number (only the church in Berlin had the full complement of four). The angels of the subsidiary congregations were under the charge of the angel of the mother church. Certain angels were designated as \\"archangels\\". There were two classes of archangels: the metropolitan archangels, of which there were supposed to be six in each tribe (this was never fully implemented throughout the tribes); and the universal archangels, who were called by word of prophecy to the post without being in charge of a \\"metropolitan congregation\\"; these last were at the disposition of the apostles for missions within the Church at large. All angels received a (small) salary and were \\"separated\\"‚Äîthat is, they had no other work to support them. Priests The priesthood was fully developed in many congregations. At least six priests were to be found to help the angel in the services, among them each of the four ministries was to be found. There were frequently many more priests than six, and each would have the oversight of particular members or areas. The six priests might also have helpers who were also of the rank of priest. The six priests (known as elders) were separated and received stipends, others might or might not receive stipends. Deacons The diaconate was particularly set up to look after the monetary affairs of the congregation, help the laity with regular visits and advice, and take part in evangelism. Seven were set up in each full congregation for this end and there would be one helper who was also a deacon. Other deacons not of this seven would aid in looking after the congregation. The deacons were not separated and each had in general his own source of income outside of the church. Deacons were not identified by word of prophecy but elected by the congregations. Certain names would be put forward and each family would have one preference vote. =Fourfold ministry= The hierarchy of angels, priests and deacons was not considered sufficient to perfect the saints, but the spiritual ministries taken from Ephesians 4:11 were developed for this end. These were defined to be four in number (as against the interpretation of a fivefold ministry): (Apostle or) Elder, Prophet, Evangelist, and Pastor (or Teacher). These were referred to as the \\"border\\" or \\"colour\\" of the ministry and were discerned by prophecy. Since these ministries were supposed to indicate something about the fundamental character of the minister personally, the border could not be changed once defined. Because the fourfold ministry was necessary to perform the full services of the liturgy, four priests, one of each border, had to be present along with the bishop. The border could be defined for any person or minister; thus, there were combinations of rank and border in any manner. For instance, there were angel-prophets, angel-evangelists, and priest-prophets as well as priest- elders, deacon-pastors, deacon-prophets, and so on. Certain of these combinations often implied particular roles. For example, the angel- evangelists were particularly responsible for evangelism within their geographical region or tribe while angel-prophets were automatically at the disposal of the apostles in Albury. The elder was generally in charge of organisation and declaring doctrine. The function of the prophets was to explain Scripture, minister the word of prophecy, and exhort to holiness, as well as to identify spiritual influences and borders (though this last function had to be done in special meetings call for that purpose and not at any time that pleased the prophet). The evangelist was used to declare the Gospel and explain the Bible teachings. The pastor was used for the teaching of truth, the provision of spiritual counsel, and comfort to the laity. Once a congregation had an angel and the fourfold ministry from local people (not including ministers who had transferred from other congregations), the full services could be held. This was announced by the hanging of seven lamps across the chancel. =Laity and other officers= Unordained officers There would be under-deacons who would help out in the church services (keeping doors, handing out liturgies, and so on) and also work with the deacons in visiting the congregation. They received a blessing from the local angel but were not ordained. They could take certain minor services with license from the presiding minister of the congregation. Two acolytes accompanied the angel during the celebration of the services and others would help robe the ministers beforehand but would not accompany the service. Deaconesses received blessing from the angel but were unordained. They mainly helped the deacons in their care for the congregations, particularly towards the women. Lay-assistants were also blessed for various reasons related to church work. All unordained officers would wear a cassock in church, though they would usually sit with the congregation. Two under-deacons or lay- assistants would be designated as \\"scribes\\" in order to record any words of prophecy and also write down the sermons and homilies as they were preached. After comparing their accounts, the copy would be sent to the apostles so that they could understand the spiritual state of the congregations. They would also note any prophetic utterances and submit them to the angel. Laity The congregations were expected to be at least as spiritually endowed as the clergy, and prophetic utterances from the laity were common. Each family or person living alone was under the care of a deacon, deaconess and priest, to whom they could resort if in need of advice or help, temporal as well as spiritual. Members also had access to monetary relief, if in need. Access to ministers was encouraged. Organisation =Twelve tribes= For ecclesiastical purposes, the church universal was divided into twelve tribes because Christendom was considered to be divided into twelve portions or tribes, defined according to the prevailing spiritual character of the country and only secondarily geographically. Nineteenth-century political geography was not followed, notably in the recognition of Poland (which at that time did not exist as a country) as a tribe in its own right. Certain countries outside Europe were designated as \\"suburbs\\" of a tribe. Each tribe was under the special charge of an apostle and his co-ministers. The apostles always held the supreme authority, though, as their number dwindled, their coadjutors inherited their responsibilities as long as they lived and assisted the survivors in the functions of the apostolate. The last apostle, Francis Valentine Woodhouse, died on February 3, 1901. The central episcopacy of forty-eight was regarded as indicated by prophecy, being foreshown in the forty-eight boards of the Mosaic tabernacle. All of the functions, ordinances, vestments and symbols were thus taken from the Bible and were said to be the fulfilment of how the primitive church was originally set up under the first Apostles. All members were expected to be spiritual, there was no limitation of spiritual manifestations to the clergy, and contacts on spiritual matters between the clergy and the laity were encouraged, though only ordained ministers were allowed to preach or take services. =Structure of the local church= Each fully endowed congregation was presided over by its angel or bishop; under him were twenty-four priests, divided variously into the four ministries of elders, prophets, evangelists, and pastors. Six priests were further designated \\"elders\\" and aided the bishop in the rule of the local church. With these were the deacons, seven of whom regulated the temporal affairs of the local church, though there could be up to 60 according to the number of people in the congregation. Moreover, there were also underdeacons, deaconesses, acolytes, singers, and doorkeepers, though none of these were ordained. The understanding was that each elder, with his co-presbyters and deacons, should have charge of 500 adult communicants in his district, making one church have 3000 members, corresponding to the number of converts at the first preaching of the Gospel in Acts. This could be only partially carried into practice. Layout of churches Churches were to be built by the means of the local congregation and to their approved designs, though the organisation and layout of the church had to follow the apostles' prescriptions. The church building had to be freehold and the title deeds given over to the apostles for their perpetual use; there was usually a set of trustees in each country for legal reasons. The church was to be laid out in three distinct parts, corresponding to the three divisions of the tabernacle or the Temple in Jerusalem. The nave would be for the congregation, then slightly elevated by a step or two the chancel for the priests and deacons (deacons sitting in cross benches at the entrance and priests along the sides). The third part, slightly elevated again with regard to the chancel and separated from it by a low barrier with a gate, was the sanctuary. Communion would be distributed to the faithful kneeling at this barrier, the ministrant being inside the sanctuary. The sanctuary contained the altar, placed centrally against the wall or dividing partition, and usually elevated on a pedestal. Furniture The decoration and style varied considerably according to the means of each congregation and the local preferences. The altar was usually ornate, with a receptacle (referred to as the \\"tabernacle\\") for storage of the eucharist on top. Either side of the altar would be a lamp, lit during high services. Hanging centrally over the sanctuary would be another lamp, lit when the eucharist was stored in the \\"tabernacle\\". If the congregation had the fourfold ministry, the seven lamps, reminiscent of the seven-branched candlestick of the Jewish rituals, would hang over the chancel near the sanctuary. These would be lit in the morning and put out after the evening service. All lamps were oil lamps with wicks and only pure olive oil was used. There would be a special chair or \\"throne\\" for the angel at the end of the chancel on the left; in the middle of the chancel at the same level would be a special kneeler used by the angel during the intercession part of the service; a censer stand stood next to it. Over on the right side of the chancel stood a table of prothesis used for the to-be-consecrated bread and wine for the communion, as well as other offerings as the service demanded. A lectern was provided in the chancel on the right side for the Scripture readings; while at the front of the chancel two further lecterns, on the left and on the right, were used for the Gospel and Epistle readings in the eucharist service. A pulpit on the left side (as looking towards the altar) would be provided for preaching: sometimes this would be placed adjoining the chancel, sometimes in the nave among the congregation. At the back of the nave near an entrance a font with a cover would be placed for baptisms. =Tithes and offerings= The ministry was supported by tithes in addition to the free- will offerings for the support of the place of worship and for the relief of distress. Each local church sent a tithe of its tithes to the apostles, by which the ministers of the Universal Church were supported and its administrative expenses defrayed; by these offerings, too, the needs of poorer churches were supplied. There was no collection during the service, but a trunk with various compartments for the different types of offerings was placed at the entrance to the church. They were generally divided into tithes, general offerings, thank-offerings, offerings for the upkeep of the church, the poor, and support for the universal ministry. Uniquely this trunk was left untouched until the presentation of the offerings during the Eucharist on Sundays, when it would be emptied and counted in a vestry by two deacons during part of the service, before a prayer of dedication to the purposes outlined would be pronounced. Distribution of money to the poor, not just members, was regularly practised. Liturgy and forms of worship For the service of the church a comprehensive book of liturgies and offices was provided by the apostles. The first impression dates from 1842 and includes elements from the Anglican, Roman, and Greek liturgies as well as original work. Lights, incense, vestments, holy water, chrism, and other adjuncts of worship were in constant use. The complete ceremony could be seen in their Central Church (now leased to Forward in Faith and known as Christ the King, Gordon Square) and elsewhere. The daily worship consisted of matins with proposition (or exposition) of the sacrament at 6 am, prayers at 9 am and 3 pm, and vespers at 5 pm. On all Sundays and holy days there was a solemn celebration of the Eucharist at the high altar; on Sundays this was at 11 am. On other days low celebrations were held, in the side-chapels if the building had them, which with the chancel in all churches correctly built after apostolic directions were separated or marked off from the nave by open screens with gates. The community laid great stress on symbolism, and in the Eucharist, while rejecting both transubstantiation and consubstantiation, held strongly to a real (mystical) presence. It emphasized also the phenomena of Christian experience and deemed miracle and mystery to be of the essence in a spirit-filled church. =Sources of forms of worship= After the Testimony, the apostles were directed to travel through Christendom, to visit all parts of Christianity and Christian worship, and search for the correct forms; the form and content of worship was not to be the result of arbitrary choice but defined by interpreting the Bible. Particular emphasis was laid on the relationship between the rites under the Jewish law as laid down in Leviticus and the liturgy of the church. The apostles brought these back after one or two years to Albury and the worship was set in order as a result. The forms of worship and the liturgy developed until the 1860s as special services were added. Following the more or less complete rejection of their Testimony, the apostles were led to set up congregations to look after those who had accepted them and had been excluded from their habitual places of worship and to install in them the forms of worship that they had been led to identify. In the 1850s, the clergy of the Church of England were invited to come and see what had been set up, but this too remained fruitless. The services were published as The Liturgy and other Divine Offices of the Church. Although many forms and prayers were taken over from different parts of the Church, many had to be written by the apostles since they did not exist elsewhere; about two- thirds of the liturgy was original. Apostle Cardale put together two large volumes of writings about the liturgy, with references to its history and the reasons for operating in the ways defined, which was published under the title Readings on the Liturgy. =Main services= The Eucharist, being the memorial sacrifice of Christ, was the central service. The Apostles rejected transubstantiation as well as consubstantiation while insisting on the real spiritual presence of the Body and Blood of Christ in the sacrament. Communion was taken in both kinds. Children were also admitted to communion from time to time, and more frequently until admitted to full communion, which generally occurred between the ages of 18 and 20. Communion would be distributed each day after morning prayer, though no consecration would be performed. Each day morning and evening services were held at 6 am and 5 pm. These, together with the Eucharist (11 am on Sundays) and the Forenoon service which immediately preceded it, were considered services of obligation, to be attended as often as other duties allowed. Afternoon services were also instituted. The apostles did not limit the services to these hours and other services could be held with the angel's permission. There existed full and shorter forms. The full form could only be offered in a church under an inducted angel, where the four ministries had been provided by members of the congregation (rather than ministers co-opted from other congregations). Each service in the full form started with an act of confession, followed by absolution, reading of the scriptures, anthems, psalms and the recital of the creed. The fourfold ministry would then offer the four Pauline divisions of prayer ‚Äì supplications, prayers, intercessions and giving of thanks, with the addition of collects for the seasons and with the Lord's prayer placed in the centre. Following this, the angel would offer a prayer of universal intercession, at which time also incense would be offered. The service would close with an anthem and a universal blessing from the angel. Shorter forms followed almost the same course but without the four divisions of prayer, without incense and in a less elaborate form. Much of the music in the Catholic Apostolic Church is composed by Edmund Hart Turpin, former secretary of the Royal College of Organists. =Special services= Holy days required special services, in particular the feasts of Christmas, Easter and Pentecost; with other major celebrations at All Saint's day, Good Friday and the eve of Pentecost. Among other feasts were Circumcision, Presentation, Ascension, All Angels, and Advent, as well as the anniversary of the separation of the apostles. Each major feast was followed by an octave of special prayers. Comprehensive special services were also provided for many other occasions, both public and private, including ordinations, special days of humiliation or rejoicing, blessings for work and visiting the sick. For more information see the liturgy. Prophecy and spiritual gifts Prophetic utterances in any church were the responsibility of the angel who would note what had been said and in turn submit words that were found important to the apostles. They would in turn use these words to direct their actions, and some would be circulated to the angels to be read to their congregations. These last were referred to as \\"words of record\\". No-one was expected to act immediately upon any word but to wait for it to be ministered to them in the right way. Numerous examples of miracles as well as the spiritual gifts described in the Pauline Epistles were recorded. As therein described, the existence of a spiritual gift does not convey any superiority of the person involved but a benefit for the whole church; and each person may exhibit a gift as the Holy Ghost so moves them. =Spiritual development= Baptism was not considered the end of spiritual endeavour but the reaching of maturity through the laying on of the apostles hands (known as \\"sealing\\"), after acceptance to full communion and the renewal of baptismal vows, was considered necessary to the full development of every person whether woman or man, lay or clergy. Classes were held for younger people and new members, a catechism was written, and regular contacts with the ministers having the care of the family or person was instituted and encouraged. Infant baptism was practised on the grounds that it was the only gate to eternal life, and it seemed wrong to deny this to anyone. The child would receive first communion shortly afterwards and then again after the age of five about once per year. With the agreement of the responsible minister this would be increased to three times per year at the feasts of Christmas, Easter, and Pentecost as the child grew up, with communion once per month after the age of fourteen or so. Full communion was entered into in a formal service not long before the laying on of the apostle's hands was to be arranged. Number of congregations and members The former Catholic- Apostolic church in Stockholm, Sweden, built in 1889‚Äì90. Since the 1970s, it has served as a Greek Orthodox church.. The existence of apparently separate congregations is understood by the community not as in any sense being a schism or separation from the one Catholic Church, but a separation to a special work of restoration, blessing and intercession on behalf of it on the one hand, and the results of the rejection of the Testimony on the other. In the early days those who accepted the Apostles were told to remain in their congregations and explain their adherence to their ministers. As the nuclei of the first congregations sprang out of the rejection of certain ministers by the churches to which they belonged, so many churches were set up to take care of those who were similarly cast out. Such congregations were established as patterns of the restored worship. Indeed, sectarianism is wholly rejected: the basic principle is that all who are baptized in the name of the Trinity are Christian and form part of one church. The name was taken directly from the Apostles' Creed as belonging to all Christians and not designating something new. Inspired by outbreaks of agalliasis (manifestations of the Spirit), and miraculous healing, the numbers of those who accepted the Apostles throughout the world grew at an amazing rate. The majority, after the rejection of the Apostles by the other churches, were cared for in separated congregations with ordained ministries. However, when the last apostle died in 1901 without an appearance of the 'Light of the World', the Catholic Apostolic Church declined; since ordination was only possible with Apostolic consent, no further consecrations to the ministry could be made. External evangelism, common since the beginning in 1835, ceased at the same time, and all services were reduced to a shorter form, even in congregations where the full Ministry was operating. Estimated membership at the beginning of the 20th century was 200,000, in almost 1000 congregations worldwide, spread as follows: England: 315, Scotland 28, Ireland: 6, Germany: 348, Netherlands: 17, Austria/Hungary: 8, Switzerland: 41, Norway: 10, Sweden: 15, Denmark: 59, Russia, Finland, Poland and the Baltic States: 18, France: 7, Belgium: 3, Italy: 2, US: 29, Canada: 13, Australia: 15, New Zealand: 5, South Africa: 1. The last angel died in 1960 in Siegen, Germany; the last priest in 1971 in London, England; the last deacon in 1972 in Melbourne, Australia. In 2014, the only active Catholic Apostolic congregation apparently left intact in the British Isles would seem to be the group conducting weekly worship at its large church in Maida Avenue, one of John Loughborough Pearson's last churches, near the Regent's Canal just west of Paddington station in London. The absence of any ordained clergy whose ministry the congregation would accept means that little of the once impressive liturgy can still be employed. The other principal building in London, to all intents and purposes the Catholic Apostolic \\"cathedral\\", in Gordon Square, also survives and has been let for other religious purposes since the early 1960s, serving for most of that time as the chaplaincy (\\"Christ the King\\") for the University of London, in whose main district it lies. The Apostles' Chapel at Albury, Surrey remains in the care of the Catholic Apostolic trustees but stands unused, though maintained. Of the other buildings once operated in Britain, none appears to survive in its original use; the Liverpool church suffered a devastating arson attack when it was on the brink of creative re-use and was then demolished, despite a campaign to save it; a similar building in Manchester has also not survived. The very distinguished building in Edinburgh, with its fine murals by Phoebe Anna Traquair, happily remains. The Aberdeen church on Justice Mill Lane is now a nightclub. =New Apostolic schism= Scheme of several Apostolic churches inside and outside the Netherlands from 1830 until 2005. Click on the image to enlarge. After the death of three apostles in 1855 the apostolate declared that there was no reason to call new apostles. Two callings of substitutes (\\"Jesus calleth thee Apostolic Messenger. He would use thee coadjutor for him whom He hath gathered to Himself.\\") were explained by the apostolate in 1860 as coadjutors to the remaining apostles. After this event another apostle was called in Germany in 1862 by the prophet Heinrich Geyer. The Apostles did not agree with this calling, and therefore the larger part of the Hamburg congregation who followed their 'angel' F .W. Schwartz in this schism were excommunicated. Out of this sprang the Allgemeine Christliche Apostolische Mission (ACAM) in 1863 and the Dutch branch of the Restored Apostolic Mission Church (at first known as Apostolische Zending, since 1893 officially registered as Hersteld Apostolische Zendingkerk (HAZK)). This later became the New Apostolic Church. The person called to be an apostle later recanted and was accepted back into his original rank. =Notable members= Aside from Irving, notable members include Thomas Carlyle, Baron Carlyle of Torthorwald (1803‚Äì1855), who was given responsibility for northern Germany. (This is not Thomas Carlyle the essayist (1795‚Äì1881), although Irving knew both men.). Besides Thomas Carlyle, Edward Wilton Eddis contributed to the Catholic Apostolic Hymnal; Edmund Hart Turpin contributed much to catholic apostolic music. Theology of the Second Advent Phoebe Traquair's murals, Catholic Apostolic Church murals, Edinburgh (east end) Readiness for an expected immediate Second Coming of Christ was the central aim of the congregations; the restoration of perfect institutions by the Apostles was deemed necessary to prepare the whole church for this event. The doctrines of achievable personal holiness, attainable universal salvation, the true spiritual unity of all baptized persons, living and dead, in the 'Body of Christ', the possibility of rapture without dying, and the necessity of the fourfold ministry directed by Apostles for perfecting the Church as a whole, formed the cornerstones of the theology. John S. Davenport explained their theology by saying that the changes which attend the Coming of the Lord will not be such as will attract the attention or the gaze of men. The pending judgments, such as are announced by the seven trumpets of the Apocalypse ‚Äì the political, ecclesiastical, and social changes which they involve, will seem to come about as ordinary events in human history, produced by the changes that were working in society. The rising up of the Antichrist and his full revelation will appear as the outcome of changes of opinion that have been going on for a long time, and will be upon men before they are aware of it. It is only they who are looking for the Lord's appearing, who have received with faith and reverence the warnings of the great event, who will recognize its tokens and not be taken by surprise. Notable buildings Former Catholic Apostolic Church, Albury Park, Surrey * The Church of Christ the King, Bloomsbury in Gordon Square, London: a massive Early-English neo-Gothic building constructed 1850‚Äì1854, designed by Raphael Brandon. * The Apostles' Chapel at Albury, Surrey: a Gothic Revival building in 15th century Gothic style, completed in 1840, designed by William MacIntosh Brookes. * Maida Avenue, Paddington, London: built 1891‚Äì1894, designed by John Loughborough Pearson. * Mansfield Place Church, Edinburgh (\\"the Scottish Sistine Chapel\\"): a Scottish neo-Romanseque building completed in 1885, designed by Sir Robert Rowand Anderson. The building is notable for its remarkable ethereal murals (1890s) by Phoebe Anna Traquair, a leading light of the Arts and Crafts Movement. The building was vacated by the Catholic Apostolic Church in 1958. It is in the care of the Mansfield Traquair Trust. It is used as a performance venue and for other functions. Part of the premises serve as offices for the Scottish Council of Voluntary Organisations. A 'Time of Silence' All ministers in the church were ordained by an Aaostle, or under delegated authority of an apostle. Thus, following the death of the last of the apostles, Francis Valentine Woodhouse, in 1901, the consensus of trustees, who administer the remaining assets, has been that no further ordinations are possible.The church and Its Gordon Square Cathedral: the 'Irvingites' and the Catholic Apostolic Church by Manfred Henke https://www.ucl.ac.uk/bloomsbury- project/articles/CAC-Gordon_Square.pdf Over a long period surviving ministers died until, by the mid-20th century, no ordained ministers remained and the sacraments of the church could no longer be celebrated. Surviving followers could still meet for expected worship and prayer, but not with its elaborate liturgy that required ordained ministers. Adherents were encouraged to share in the public worship of catholic-minded Christian communities including many churches in the Church of England. The church entered its present \\"Time of Silence\\". Most of its buildings have been sold-off or leased. The central church of Christ the King, London was leased. The Apostles' Chapel at Albury was closed as mentioned above. During the 1980s the trustees refurbished and re-decorated the chapel at expense, presumably in readiness for the anticipated Return of the Lord.

Since there is no overturning, the rock at the bottom is older than the rock on the top by the Law of Superposition. The law of superposition is an axiom that forms one of the bases of the sciences of geology, archaeology, and other fields dealing with geological stratigraphy. It is a form of relative dating. In its plainest form, it states that in undeformed stratigraphic sequences, the oldest strata will be at the bottom of the sequence. This is important to stratigraphic dating, which assumes that the law of superposition holds true and that an object cannot be older than the materials of which it is composed. In the simplest way to explain it that is possible, sedimentary rock that has not been moved around will have the oldest layers on the bottom, meaning that any fossils found inside will be older or newer depending where they are in the rock. History The law of superposition was first proposed in 1669 by the Danish scientist Nicolas Steno.David Thomas, Robert Kelly, Archaeology, p. 153, Cengage Learning, 2005 . In the English-language literature, the law was popularized by William \\"Strata\\" Smith, who used it to produce the first geologic map of Britain.Patrick Wyse Jackson, The Chronologers' Quest: The Search for the Age of the Earth, Cambridge University Press, 2006 , pp.127-8. It is the first of Smith's laws. Archaeological considerations Superposition in archaeology and especially in stratification use during excavation is slightly different as the processes involved in laying down archaeological strata are somewhat different from geological processes. Man- made intrusions and activity in the archaeological record need not form chronologically from top to bottom or be deformed from the horizontal as natural strata are by equivalent processes. Some archaeological strata (often termed as contexts or layers) are created by undercutting previous strata. An example would be that the silt back-fill of an underground drain would form some time after the ground immediately above it. Other examples of non vertical superposition would be modifications to standing structures such as the creation of new doors and windows in a wall. Superposition in archaeology requires a degree of interpretation to correctly identify chronological sequences and in this sense superposition in archaeology is more dynamic and multi-dimensional.

Church records show a meeting on May 13, 1835, among subsequent meetings, by members of the Concord Presbytery making plans to purchase and perform initial construction on the land, with land payments starting Jan. 1 of the following year. The first students graduated from Davidson in 1840 and received diplomas with the newly created college seal designed by Peter Stuart Ney, who is believed by some to be Napoleon's Marshal Ney. Philanthropic Hall (shown) and Eumenean Hall are on the National Register of Historic Places In the 1850s, Davidson overcame financial difficulty by instituting \\"The Scholarship Plan,\\" a program that allowed Davidson hopefuls to purchase a scholarship for $100, which could be redeemed in exchange for full tuition to Davidson until the 1870s. The college's financial situation improved dramatically in 1856 with a $250,000 donation by Maxwell Chambers, making Davidson the wealthiest college south of Princeton. The Chambers Building was erected to commemorate this gift. On November 28, 1921, the Chambers Building was destroyed in a fire but was reconstructed eight years later with funds provided by a generous gift from the Rockefeller family. The Chambers Building continues to be the primary academic building on campus. In 1923, the Gamma chapter in North Carolina of Phi Beta Kappa was established at Davidson. Over 1500 men and 500 women have been initiated into Davidson's chapter of Phi Beta Kappa. In 1924, James Duke formed the Duke Endowment, which has provided millions of dollars to the college, including a $15 million pledge in 2007 to assist with the elimination of student loans. On May 5, 1972, the trustees voted to allow women to enroll at Davidson as degree students for the first time. Women had attended classes as early as the 1860s but did not enjoy degree privileges. The first women to attend classes at Davidson were the five daughters of its president, the Rev. John Lycan Kirkpatrick. The first women were permitted to attend classes to increase the size of the student body during the American Civil War. However, art major Marianna \\"Missy\\" Woodward became the first woman to graduate from Davidson. She graduated in 1973 and was the only woman in a class of 217. In early 2005, the College's Board of Trustees voted in a 31‚Äì5 decision to allow 20% of the board to be non-Christian. John Belk, the former mayor of Charlotte and one of the heirs of Belk Department Store, resigned in protest after more than six decades of affiliation with the college. Belk, however, continued his strong relationship with his alma mater and was honored in March 2006 at the Tenth Anniversary Celebration of the Belk Scholarship. In 2007, Davidson eliminated the need for students to take out loans to pay for their tuition. All demonstrated need is met through grants, student employment, and parental contribution. The college claims to be the first liberal arts college in the United States to do this. Academics =Admissions= Princeton Review and U.S. News & World Report regard Davidson's admission process as \\"most selective\\". For the class of 2023 (enrolled fall 2019), Davidson received 5,973 applications and accepted 1,091 (18.3%). The yield rate (the percentage of accepted students who enroll) was 48.4%. The middle 50% range of SAT scores for enrolled students was 650‚Äì720 for Evidence-Based Reading & Writing, and 660‚Äì750 for Math, while the ACT Composite range was 30‚Äì33. Enrolled freshmen represent 41 states and 18 countries; 43.1% were from the U.S. South. =Rankings= The 2020 annual ranking by U.S. News & World Report rates Davidson College as tied for the 17th best among \\"National Liberal Arts Colleges\\" in America, 2nd in \\"Best Undergraduate Teaching\\" and 18th for \\"Best Value\\". For 2019, Davidson College was ranked 48th overall on Forbes ' list of \\"America's Top Colleges,\\" 17th best liberal arts college, and 8th in the South. In 2018, Kiplinger's Personal Finance rated Davidson College as the #1 best college for value across all colleges and universities in America. According to The Princeton Review, Davidson is ranked among the top twenty colleges nationally for the following categories: \\"Best Overall Academic Experience For Undergraduates,\\" \\"Professors Get High Marks\\" (1st), \\"Professors Make Themselves Accessible\\" (16th), \\"Students Study the Most\\" (10th), \\"School Runs Like Butter\\" (4th), \\"Town-Gown Relations are Great\\" (3rd), \\"Easiest Campus to Get Around\\" (3rd), and \\"Best Quality of Life (16th).\\" =Faculty= Chambers Building at Davidson College in Davidson, NC Davidson has a student- faculty ratio of 9:1, 69% of its classes are under 20 students. Davidson has 201 full-time faculty members. Almost all faculty members have terminal degrees in their field, with 97% of full-time members holding PhDs. =Honor code= E. H. Little Library, Davidson College, NC Davidson students are bound by a strict honor code, signed by each student at the start of their Freshman year. The Davidson College Honor Code states: \\"Every student shall be honor bound to refrain from cheating (including plagiarism). Every student shall be honor bound to refrain from stealing. Every student shall be honor bound to refrain from lying about College business. Every student shall be honor bound to report immediately all violations of the Honor Code of which the student has first-hand knowledge; failure to do so shall be a violation of the Honor Code. Every student found guilty of a violation shall ordinarily be dismissed from the College. Every member of the College community is expected to be familiar with the operation of the Honor Code.\\" As one of the most obvious manifestations of the Honor Code, Davidson students take self-scheduled, unproctored final exams. Some exams (known as \\"reviews\\" in Davidson vernacular) are take-home, timed, and closed book. Other take-home exams may be open book or untimed. Often take-home exams may take students days to complete. Every assignment submitted at Davidson includes either an implicit or (more often) explicit pledge that the student neither gave nor received assistance on the assignment beyond the bounds of the Honor Code. The Honor Code extends beyond 'reviews,' essays, or research papers. Notes around campus are commonly seen, whether on a bulletin board or taped to a brick walkway, describing an item found at the location and the finder's contact information so that the property may be recovered. =Majors and minors= Davidson offers majors in 27 subject areas.

Financial aid In 2007, Davidson College announced that all students would have their demonstrated financial need met by grants and student employment; loans would no longer be a component of any Davidson financial aid package.E-mail from Bobby Vagt to all Davidson College students, 19 March 2007 The Duke Endowment pledged $15,000,000 to support the initiative and it was named The Davidson Trust. In addition to not including loans in their financial aid packages, Davidson's 2014 capital campaign adding 156 new scholarships funded with $88 million. Davidson states that they are committed to providing 100% of demonstrated need of all students, with 44% of students receiving need-based aid and over 50% receiving some form of financial aid.

He was effective in initiating economic and political reforms, one of which was the drafting of Thailand's \\"Peoples' Constitution\\", which was promulgated in 1997 and abrogated in 2006. Anand received a Ramon Magsaysay Award for Government Service in 1997. Education career in civil service and business Anand was the youngest of twelve children of a wealthy family of Mon heritage on his father's side and Thai-Chinese (Hokkien) on his mother's.PAVING THE WAYPROUD TO BE MON SAYS FORMER THAI PM His father, Sern was a son of a high-ranking official of Mon ancestry. His father studied in England on a king's scholarship, and later oversaw all royal schools and thereafter a successful businessman in the 1930s. His paternal grandfather built an ethnic Mon monastery in Ratchaburi called Wat Khao Chon Phran. According to Anand, he inherited his Chinese heritage from his maternal grandmother, whose surname was Lau (). His Chinese ancestors came to Thailand in the mid-18th century and eventually became one of the country's most prominent Hokkien families. He is distantly related to Korn Chatikavanij through this branch of his family. Anand attended Dulwich College and later read law at Trinity College, Cambridge, graduating with honours in 1955. Anand spent 23 years in the foreign service, serving at times as the Ambassador of Thailand to the United Nations, Canada, the United States, and West Germany. In January 1976 he was appointed Permanent Secretary of the foreign ministry, and played a leading role in ensuring the US military withdrawal from Thailand. Following that year's October coup, Anand was branded a communist by the military during the subsequent political witch hunts, presumably for the Foreign Ministry's role in the normalisation of diplomatic relations between Thailand and the People's Republic of China. Although the civil service panel set up to investigate the allegations cleared him of any wrongdoing, Anand was put into relatively unimportant posts and in 1979 left the public sector for the private.Far Eastern Economic Review, 19 December 1991 He became the Vice-Chairman of the Saha-Union Group in 1979 and the Chairman of the Board of Directors in 1991. He has been a Director of Siam Commercial Bank since 1984. First administration Anand in 2010 On 23 February 1991, a military coup led by Generals Sunthorn Kongsompong, supreme commander of the armed forces, and General Suchinda Kraprayoon, the commander-in-chief of the army, imprisoned Chatichai Choonhavan, the democratically elected leader. As in previous Thai coups, the military formed a National Peace Keeping Council (NPKC) to run the country. To shore up its image and gain the trust of King Bhumibol, the NPKC appointed Anand as interim prime minister. Anand, closely linked to the palace and held in respect by both the bureaucracy and the business community, proved acceptable to the people and the international community. He was regarded as being astute and disciplined, and had never been associated with any financial scandals.Murray Upon accepting the position of prime minister, Anand was quick to declare that he did not agree with everything the junta had done and that he intended to follow an independent course. He angered the NPKC by suggesting that Chatichai be released immediately upon a cabinet being appointed.Bangkok Post, 3 March 1991 =Formation= The interim constitution that was promulgated on 1 March 1991 reconfirmed the intention of the NKPC to retain substantial control.The Nation, 11 March 1991 However, Anand was allowed relative freedom to select his own cabinet members. For the entire period of his premiership Anand faced constant pressure from the junta leaders, who tried to influence government decisions in order to gain financial benefits.Handley Anand filled his cabinet with well-known academics, technocrats, and ex-bureaucrats with proven records. Various commentators, ranging from the president of the Thailand Development Research Institute to the mass-circulation newspaper Thai Rath, described the cabinet as the most impressive Thailand had ever had.Bangkok Post, 7 March 1991The Nation, 7 March 1991 The strong guiding hand of privy councillor Prem Tinsulanonda could be seen. Amongst those selected by Anand were Prem's previous finance minister and economic advisor. A senior diplomat during the years Prem served as prime minister became foreign minister. The technocratic orientation of the cabinet substantially diminished the fears of foreign investors. =Reforms= Anand's administration proved harder-working than his predecessors. The administration worked on its task of implementing a long list of much-needed reforms. Its emphasis on education, public health, exports, agriculture, industry, environment, and improvement in living conditions, met with widespread approval. In a Bangkok poll in late-July 1991, 61 percent of respondents felt that the Anand government was more honest than previous administrations.Bangkok Post Weekly Review, 2 August 1991 Arguably the most significant of the reforms was a restructuring of the taxation system, which saw the introduction of a value added tax (VAT) and a reduction in corporate and income taxation. Several measures were taken to free up the flow of funds into and out of the country. Thai nationals were allowed to invest abroad without the approval of the Bank of Thailand. Regulations were altered for foreign banks to open branches and the ceiling on bank interest rates was lifted.The Nation, 16 April 1992 In addition, the process for obtaining official operating licences for factories was greatly simplified, while the method of allocating textile and tapioca quotas was made more apparent. In the energy sector, price control barriers were dismantled. The government was also able to successfully conclude agreements for a number of large-scale infrastructure projects initiated by the Chatichai administration. A regulatory board to oversee the privatisation and private investment in infrastructure projects was established. The projects themselves were also to be independently approved and monitored by agencies outside the government in order to minimise the opportunities for corruption. In an attempt to spread the benefits of the country's economic growth, civil servants were given a 23 percent raise in wages, state employers a 20 percent wage rise, and the minimum wage was raised by 15 percent. In addition to this, the Anand government allocated six billion baht in the fiscal year 1992 budget to be distributed to villages and spent at their discretion. Key accomplishments of Anand's government include: * The establishment of the ASEAN Free Trade Area (AFTA) * A highly effective anti-AIDS/HIV policy. * Electricity market reform, including the introduction of Independent Power Producers (IPPs) and the initiation of a 10-year liberalisation and privatisation plan for EGAT. Many have noted that Saha-Union Group, which Anand chaired, won a major bid to build a large coal-fired power plant while Anand was in power. * Award of a multi-billion baht concession to Telecom Asia (today known as True) to build and operate two million telephone lines in Bangkok. It was noted by many that General Suchinda, the coup leader who installed Anand as Prime Minister, was appointed chairman of Telecom Asia after he was toppled from power. * Suspension of the Hopewell rail-train airport link project.Bangkok's Independent Newspaper =Foreign policy= On the international front Anand performed well. Despite international concern over the coup, foreign administrations had sufficient confidence to resume relations quickly. Anand made visits to China in September 1991 and Japan in December 1991, and went on to meetings with President George H. W. Bush in the United States. He was able to shake off the stigma of being a junta-installed prime minister, instead successfully presenting the image of an administration determined to deregulate, cut red tape, and create an environment conductive to free enterprise. The Anand government's policies to its neighbours followed the lead of his predecessor Chatichai. Relationships with Laos improved significantly, with Thailand allocating one-half of its 200 million baht aid budget to the nation.Bangkok Post, 20 February 1992 Thailand under Anand became deeply involved in the Cambodian peace process, while relations with Vietnam went through a period of fence-mending and confidence-building. The only foreign relations area where there were serious reasons for criticising Anand's administration was Thailand's soft stance towards the repressive military junta of Burma. =Disagreements with the NPKC= Anand disagreed with the military junta's plans to increase the defence budget. Anand denied the military's request for supplemental funding that would have totaled 53 billion baht. Junta member Air Chief Marshal Kaset Rojananil criticised the government for being too \\"inefficient\\" and calling for it to resign.Bangkok Post, 2 October 1991 Suchinda justified the military's request by stating that there were still communist fighters in the Indochina region. In November and December Anand publicly repeated his views that the country's security did not lie in military might, but in its economic and political development, on one occasion stating, \\"Military might is no longer a guarantee of national security. No nation can feel secure as long as its citizens are deprived of freedom of political expression and of the opportunities for a better and more meaningful life.\\"The Nation, 5 November 1991 Anand also voiced disagreement with the junta's draft constitution, although the constitution was ultimately promulgated. At first, he refused to comment as the Constitution Scrutinising Committee, hand-picked by Sunthorn, made changes to what became the final draft constitution. Then on 16 November, Anand spoke out against clauses that gave the appointed 360 member Senate the same powers as elected members of the House of Representatives as well as a clause allowing permanent public officials and military officers to hold political posts. Anand suggested that the Senate be reduced in size. The military-dominated Constitution Drafting Assembly refused to accept his suggestions and voted unanimously to pass the draft. Anand's response was simple: \\"I'm disappointed\\".The Nation, 22 November 1991 =Human rights= Anand's refusal to interfere with the junta's actions meant that his administration failed to come to grips with human rights issues. He had a comprehensive environmental bill passed, but it was ignored by the military, which continued its corrupt activities. Not long after it had taken power, the NPKC announced a huge rural development project that would help solve the problems of rural landlessness and encroachment on protected forests, issues that had for decades occupied the king's attention. The military had promised to resettle more than 1.2 million people to permanent farmlands, but instead evicted villagers from forest reserves, where they had lived in some cases for generations, and transferred the lands to corporate plantations.Occasional Paper No. 21, Indian Ocean Centre for Peace Studies, University of Western Australia In almost all cases, the army failed to provide new homes and food supplies. When an activist monk led villagers to protest, he and his followers were attacked and arrested. In mid-June 1991, the outspoken president of the Labour Congress of Thailand, Thanong Phoarn, mysteriously disappeared. The deputy defence minister, a military man, casually brushed the matter aside, claiming that Thanong had probably fled his wife.Bangkok Post Weekly Review, 12 July 1991 He has not been seen since. With respect to the freedom of information, the Anand administration also disappointed many. With the NPKC in full control of the media, any criticism of the military was censored. News of rallies and demonstrations on a wide range of issues of public concern were kept from the public. The transparency of the denials of censorship by the military-dominated Interior Ministry must have been apparent to Anand, but he chose to do nothing about them. Anand was succeeded by General Suchinda, who was appointed by parliament after general elections. Second government Suchinda resigned on 24 May 1992, following an intervention by the king that ended the violent military crackdown on massive popular protests against his government. The five coalition parties that made up his administration still attempted to cling to power, however, despite calls for their resignation by the opposition and the press, and nominated Air Chief Marshal Somboon Rahong, leader of the Chart Thai Party, for the premiership. At the time it looked as if House Speaker Arthit Urairat was set to submit Somboon's name to the king. Arthit however held back the nomination of Somboon following a meeting with privy councillor Prem, who was thought to have been exerting pressure on behalf of the king. The House Speaker instead announced that no decision would be made until the constitutional amendments were passed on 10 June 1992, adding that the next prime minister would be a civilian. On 10 June 1992, Arthit surprised the country by recommending Anand's name instead of Somboon's to the king. The announcement was greeted with almost universal approval and even relief. Only the coalition parties of the previous government were dismayed, turning at first on Arthit, who they saw as having betrayed them. Four days later Anand announced the formation of his cabinet, which included twenty respected technocrats who had held ministerial portfolios during his previous tenure as prime minister. The top tasks of Anand's government were the rehabilitation of the economy, the organisation of free and fair elections, and the removal of top armed forces commanders from their posts. The Internal Peacekeeping Law, which allowed for the use of military force against demonstrators, was abolished on 29 June, and on 1 August, he removed Air Chief Marshal Kaset, General Issarapong, and General Chainarong, the First Regional Army Commander, from their posts. Anand was succeeded by democratically elected Chuan Leekpai later in 1992. Post-political career Anand rejoined the Saha-Union Group as chairman after the general elections of 1992. His government had awarded Saha-Union a major Independent Power Producer concession. He resigned from Saha-Union Group in 2002. =Constitution Drafting Assembly= In 1996, Anand was elected as a member of the Constitution Drafting Assembly and was appointed Chairman of the Drafting Committee. He oversaw the drafting of what became known as the \\"Peoples' Constitution\\" of 1997. The constitution was abrogated in 2006 after a military coup against Thaksin Shinawatra that Anand supported. The People's Constitution instituted several important reforms, including: * Decentralisation of government, including the establishment of elected Tambon Administrative Organisations (TAOs) and Provincial Administrative Organisations (PAOs). School administrations were also decentralised, although opposition from teachers delayed implementation of this reform * Establishment of several independent government agencies, including the Election Commission, the Office of the Auditor-General, and the National Human Rights Commission * Stipulated that candidates for parliament must hold at least a bachelor's degree * Mechanisms to increase political stability by favouring large parties over small ones, and hence singular governments over coalition governments =National Reconciliation Commission= From March 2005, Anand served as chairman of the National Reconciliation Commission (NRC), tasked with overseeing that peace was restored to the troubled south. A fierce critic of the Thaksin government, Anand frequently criticised his handling of the southern unrest, and in particular the State of Emergency Decree. He has been quoted to have said, \\"The authorities have worked inefficiently. They have arrested innocent people instead of the real culprits, leading to mistrust among locals. So, giving them broader power may lead to increased violence and eventually a real crisis.\\" Unfortunately, the situation deteriorated from 2005 to 2006, with escalating violence, especially among teachers and civilians. Despite much criticism of the Thaksin-government's policies, Anand refused to submit the NRC's final report, choosing instead to wait for the results of the 2006 legislative election. Anand finally submitted the NRC's recommendations on 5 June 2006. Among them were * Introducing Islamic law * Making ethnic Pattani- Malay (Yawi) an official language of the region * Establishing an unarmed peacekeeping force * Establishing a Peaceful Strategic Administrative Centre for southern border provinces The recommendations were rejected by Privy Council President Prem, who stated, \\"We cannot accept that [proposal] as we are Thai.

During November 2003 and December 2004, Anand was requested by then United Nations Secretary- General Kofi Annan to chair the High-Level Panel on Threats, Challenges and Change of the United Nations. The panel of former presidents, prime ministers, and scholars was tasked to prepare recommendations for possible UN reform. Support for the 2006 military coup Anand supported the 2006 military coup that abrogated the People's Constitution and overthrew the government of Thaksin Shinawatra. Anand had been a sharp critic of Thaksin for several years prior to the coup, and he blamed the coup on Thaksin. He also stated fears that the military junta would fail and that Thaksin could make a comeback. \\"When the [Chatichai] government disappeared from the scene [after the 1991 coup] there was no fear it could make a comeback. But over the past five years Thaksin and his party have become too powerful. They have consolidated their hold over the government machinery and certain sectors of the armed forces and parliament. So I think it's a more precarious situation.\\" Anand claimed that the coup was well received by the people and that the military junta's ban against opposition or political activity would not last long. He also noted surprise at the international community's condemnation to the coup.The Nation, Our coup is different: Anand , 29 September 2006 Criticism of Crown Prince Vajiralongkorn In a private meeting with US Ambassador Ralph Boyce, whose post-meeting report was leaked by WikiLeaks, Anand was critical of Crown Prince Vajiralongkorn. Anand noted that although the Crown Prince would succeed his father according to the law, the kingdom would be better off if other arrangements could be made. However, Anand noted that King Bhumibol would not likely change the succession. Anand also said that the Prince's succession would face \\"complicating factors\\" he continued interfering in politics or could not avoid embarrassing financial transactions, and that it was the consensus view among many Thai was that the Crown Prince could not stop either, nor would he be able, at age 57, to rectify his behaviour.

The English name is derived from the slang term \\"cramming\\", meaning to study hard or to study a large amount of material in a short period of time. Education Cram schools may specialise in a particular subject or subjects, or may be aligned with particular schools. Special cram schools that prepare students to re-take failed entrance examinations are also common. As the name suggests, the aim of a cram school is generally to impart as much information to its students as possible in the shortest period of time. The goal is to enable the students to obtain a required grade in particular examinations, or to satisfy other entrance requirements such as language skill (e.g.: IELTS). Cram schools are sometimes criticised, along with the countries in which they are prevalent, for a focus on rote learning and a lack of training in critical thinking and analysis. By country = Australia = Cram schools are referred to largely as \\"coaching colleges\\", they are used primarily to achieve the necessary results for the entrance exam for selective schools in New South Wales. They are also used extensively in mathematics courses for the Higher School Certificate and other high school leavers exams. = Bangladesh = In Bangladesh, cram Schools are known as \\"coaching centers\\" and to some extent 'tutorials'. Most cram schools provide help for admission tests of public universities and medical colleges, and public examinations like SSC, and, HSC. There are also some variants which have entered the market of ever increasing help seekers. For example, cram schools now also prepare students for language tests like IELTS and TOEFL, aptitude tests like GRE, GMAT, SAT, and so on. In recent years cram schools have also been extended to the tests for government civil services like BCS Examination. = Brazil = Cram schools are called \\"Cursinhos\\" (lit. Little Courses) in Brazil and are attended by students who will be taking a vestibular exam to be admitted into a university. =Chile= Cram schools are called \\"Preuniversitarios\\" in Chile and are attended by students to revise before taking PSU (University Selection Test) in order to get onto undergraduate studies. =China= Cram schools (also known as buke) are popular in China due to the importance of standardized exams, such as: * High school entrance exam (after junior high, at 9th year of school). * The National Higher Education Entrance Examination, or Gaokao, mandatory for college admission. * English language exams. Passing the College English Test (CET) band 4 and 6 is sometimes a prerequisite for bachelor's degree, and the certificates are often important to finding employment. The TOEFL and GRE tests from ETS are required for studying abroad in English-speaking countries. * Entrance exams to domestic graduate program. Over recent years the competition has intensified, partially because many new college graduates fail to find satisfactory jobs and seek post-graduate education instead. China has a test-driven system. Education departments give entrance examinations to sort students into schools of different levels. Examinations like the National Higher Education Entrance Examination (Gaokao) are vital, deciding the academic future of the participants. This education system cultivated the cramming style of teaching. Schools and teachers usually regard grades to be the primary goal. This sometimes leads to teachers imparting exam skills instead of knowledge and inspiration. But as the population of students decreases each year and admission to domestic universities expands, the pressure of the Entrance Exam has been reducing. =France= About 5% of the French students attend the Classes Pr√©paratoires aux Grandes √âcoles (prep school) or CPGE. These two-year programs are meant to prepare undergrad students to the entrance exams of high-profile graduate schools (Grandes √©coles) in research, engineering and business ‚Äî including √âcole Normale Sup√©rieure, HEC Paris, EDHEC, ESCP, EM Lyon, ESSEC, √âcole polytechnique, Arts et M√©tiers ParisTech, T√©l√©com Paris, √âcole des Ponts, CentraleSup√©lec, √âcole des Mines, ISAE-SUPAERO,... French prep schools are characterised by heavy workload and high demands. They have produced most of France's scientists, intellectuals, and executives, during the last two centuries. Students in CPGE have between 36 and 40 hours of class a week, and at least 2 hours and a half of study: the best students can go up to more than 5 every evening after school, as well as a weekly 2-to-4 hours test, and more work during the weekend. Moreover, they take what is called \\"Kh√¥lles\\" mainly 2 times a week. For the scientific branche; it consists of an hour test where a group of 3 students, each split at one board, is dealing with: a question related to a specific lesson (e.g. a demonstration of a theorem studied during class) and finally an exercice. Everything done during the test must be explained orally to the teacher. For kh√¥lles dealing with languages studied in CPGE (e.g. English) it mainly consists in a 30min test: on the one hand listening to an audio or studying an article from a newspaper then summarizing it, and on the other hand writing an essay dealing with the theme of what was summarized during the first part of the test (=20 min). Everything is then submitted orally to an English teacher (15min). This is a two-year cursus (or rather a five-term cursus, as the Entrance Exams occurs on the sixth term). If a student could not obtain the school they wanted, they may repeat the second year. There are three main branches : *Scientists (see ) study mainly maths, physics and chemistry, IT, and Industrial Sciences. They are dubbed \\"taupin\\" (from \\"taupe\\", a mole) because they don't often see the sun. Sub-branches are : Math-Physics, Physics-Chemistry, and Physics-Industrial sciences. There is also the biology sub-branch, the \\"agros\\" (from \\"agronomie\\", used here as agricultural science) specialised more in biology and chemistry than in maths/physics. *Economists (see ) study mainly social sciences, economy, maths and foreign languages. A lot of important French personalities and politicians went through this way. They're divided between those who study more sciences, those who study Law, economy, or technologies. *Humanities students (see Kh√¢gne) study mainly philosophy, literature, foreign and ancient languages, history. There are again subsections : the social sciences section, and the literature section. The various curriculums of CPGE are known for their folklore (slang terms, songs and hymns, anecdotes), and often inherited from early 19th-century generations of students. =Greece= Œ¶œÅŒøŒΩœÑŒπœÉœÑŒÆœÅŒπŒ± (from œÜœÅŒøŒΩœÑŒØŒ∂œâ, to take care of) have been a permanent fixture of the Greek educational system for several decades. They are considered the norm for learning foreign languages (English language learning usually starts during the elementary school years) and for having a chance to pass the university entrance examinations. The preparation for the country-wide university entrance examinations practically takes up the two last years of upper high school, and the general view is that the amount of relevant school hours is insufficient for the hard competition, regardless of the teachers' abilities. This leads to overworked students who take state school lessons from 08.15-14.00 at school, go home for lunch, continue for two or three hours in the cramming school and return to prepare the homework both for state school and \\"frontistirio\\". In the weekend, the students usually have lessons in the cramming school on Saturday morning and on Sunday morning revision tests, leaving them exhausted and with no free time. Greek students work very hard and also unhired teachers by the state find a way to employment through these private businesses. These two popular views pave the ground for the abundant number of cram schools, also attended by numerous high school students for general support of their performance. =Hong Kong= Cram schools in Hong Kong are called tutorial schools. These cram schools put focus on the major public examinations in Hong Kong, namely HKDSE, and teach students on techniques on answering questions in the examinations. They also provide students tips on which topics may appear on the coming examination (called \\"question tipping\\"), and provide students some sample questions that are similar to those that appear in the examinations. Some cram school teachers in Hong Kong have become idolised and attract many students to take their lessons. These teachers are called \\"King of tutors (Ë£úÁøíÂ§©Áéã)\\". Cram schools in Hong Kong are famous because of the stresses from Hong Kong Diploma of Secondary Education (HKDSE). These cram school teaching includes practicing exam questions and grammar drills. Moreover, they provide model essays for English language exam. However, some schools are not licensed, and few educators have teaching qualifications. Their education is fun and appealing to the students but may be of little use in actually passing exams. =India= Numerous cram schools‚Äîreferred to as coaching centers/institutes or tutorials in India‚Äîhave sprung up all over the nation. Like in other countries, these tutorials have become a parallel education system with the aim of getting their clients through various competitive exams to enter prestigious institutions such as the Indian Institute of Science for Scientific Research Stream, Indian Institutes of Technology for Engineering Stream and All India Institutes of Medical Sciences for Medical Stream at undergraduate & postgraduate level. They also prepare students to crack prestigious national level entrance/ scholarship exams at high school level such as NTSE (National talent search examination), KVPY (Kishore Vaigyanik Protsahan Yogana),a scholarship exam for pure science fields, JEE (Joint Entrance Examination) Main & Advanced to enter prestigious engineering colleges like the IITs, NEET-UG (National Eligibility cum Entrance Test - Undergraduate level) for entrance into major medical science undergraduate programs, etc. These exams are necessary to get into fields like scientific research, engineering, medical, management, accountancy, law and also into India's premier central and state government services organised by UPSC, SSC etc. Examples of cram schools in India include FIITJEE. =Indonesia= Cram schools in Indonesia are called bimbingan belajar (learning assistance), often shortened into bimbel, and accepts students preparing for National Examinations before passing elementary school, junior high school, high school and college entrance exams. These cram schools teach students with exam simulations and problem-solving tutorials. Usually, these cram schools teach students by past exam questions. Bimbels in Indonesia offer lessons after school hours, weekends or public holidays. =Ireland= \\"Grind schools\\", as they are known in the Republic of Ireland, prepare students for the Leaving Certificate examination. Competition for university places (the \\"points race\\") has intensified with recent years: students wishing to study medicine, law or veterinary science in particular must achieve five or six \\"A\\" grades to be accepted. Some grind schools, such as The Institute of Education, Ashfield College, Leinster Senior College and Bruce College, teach full-time. Many others offer weekend or evening classes for students in subjects in which they struggle. =Japan= Cram schools, called juku, are special private schools common in Japan that offer lessons conducted after regular school hours, on weekends, and during school vacations. =Korea= Although the South Korean educational system has been criticized internationally for its rigorousness, it remains common for South Korean schoolchildren to attend one or more cram schools after their elementary school-day is finished. Some types of institutes include math, science, art, and English. English-language institutes are particularly popular. Usually, in South Korea, the method of formal education centers on memorization. In a typical school, students stay in one classroom, while teachers travel between the classrooms. The students are taught Korean history, world history, Korean language, math, science, and foreign languages. South Korean students only have midterms and finals. They just have written tests with those subjects. Distinct feature of cramming teaching method in Korea is extra curriculum for tests. After school, generally, most students go to extra tutors, or \\"Hagwon\\", to supplement what they learned from the teachers who provide knowledge to the students; students memorize for tests and go to ‚ÄúHagwon‚Äù for high grades. =Malaysia= In Malaysia, it is considered a norm for parents, especially those from the middle and upper class, to send schoolchildren for private tuition. Such services are often provided by tuition centers and/or private tutors. These tutors may be full-time tutors, schoolteachers, retirees, or even senior students. Many concerned parents choose to send their children to different tuition classes or schedules based on the child's entrance examination subjects. Some students may go to tuition for their weaker subjects, while many schoolchildren are increasingly known to attend at least 10 hours of private tuition every week. Correspondingly, the reputation and business of a tuition center often depends on venue, schedule, number of top-scoring clients, and advertising by word of mouth. It is not uncommon for private tutors to offer exclusive pre-examination seminars, to the extent where some tutors entice schoolchildren to attend such seminars with the promise of examination tips, or even supposedly leaked examination questions. =Pakistan= In Pakistan, it has become very common for parents to send their children to such institutions, popularly known as \\"academies\\", after school for further private coaching. It has become prevalent in almost all levels of education, from junior classes to colleges and, to a lesser extent, universities. Due to the near-universality of this system, it has become very difficult to compete successfully in almost any level of exams without them, despite the added burden on the students. =Peru= In Peru, cram schools, known as \\"Academias\\", are institutions which intensively prepare, in about a year, high school graduates to gain admission to either University (\\"Academia Pre Universitaria\\"), or Military Schools (\\"Academia Pre-Militar\\"). Cram Schools in Peru are not an admission requirement to enter to any Tertiary Institution; however, due to fierce competition, preparation in a cram school allows the candidate to achieve the highest mark possible in the entry exam and so gain entry to their desired Tertiary Institution. Cram Schools are independent of universities, however, of recent a post-high-school, pre- university school has started at some public and private universities in Peru. Under the name of CEntro PREuniversitario (name or acronym of university, for instance CEPREUNI or CEPREPUCP, after Universidad Nacional de Ingenieria or Pontificia Universidad Catolica del Peru, commonly referred to as \\"the CEPRE\\" or \\"the PRE\\"). Some of these CEPREs offer automatic admission to their university to their students who reach a set level of achievement =Singapore= In Singapore, it is very common for students in the local education system to be enrolled in cram schools, better known locally as tuition centers. Enrollment in these after-school tuition centers is extremely high, especially for students bound for national exams, such as the Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE), GCE O Levels, or the GCE A Levels. Students attending tuition centers on a daily basis is not unheard of in Singapore. =Taiwan= Cram schools in Taiwan are called buxiban (Ë£úÁøíÁè≠ literally \\"supplementary learning class\\") and are not necessarily cram schools in the traditional sense. Almost any kind of extracurricular academic lesson could be termed buxiban, such as music, art, math, and science, even if students do not attend these classes specifically in order to pass an examination. It's a traditional belief that parents should send their children to all kinds of cram schools in order to compete against other talented children. Therefore, most children in Taiwan have a schedule packed with all sorts of cram school lessons. But when they study English, often with a \\"Native Speaker Teacher\\", they are actually studying at a private language school. Furthermore, since this study is ongoing, they are not \\"cramming\\" in the traditional sense of the word, and therefore, these language schools are not cram schools by strict definition. Taiwan is well known for its cram schools. Nearly all students have some kinds of cram school to improve their skills. The meritocratic culture, which requires some skills testing for passports to college, graduate school, and even government service, is dominant on Taiwan's policy. =Thailand= Cram schooling in Thailand has become almost mandatory to succeed in high school or in the entrance examinations of universities. Cram schools in Thailand, which are called tutoring institutes, tutoring schools, special tutoring, or special classes for example, are widespread throughout the country. Some of them do not have instructors in class rooms in a traditional sense; students receive their tuition via television network, which can either relay a live session from another branch or replay a pre- recorded session. Parents generally encourage their children to attend these schools and they sometimes can be perceived as pushy. The system of cram school is currently blamed for discouraging pupils from independent studies. The main reason given by attending students is to increase understanding in their lessons. The secondary reason of junior high school students is to want to know faster techniques whereas the reason of senior ones is to prepare for exam. The most attended subjects are mathematics for juniors and English language for seniors. Average expense per course is about 2,001‚Äì3,000 baht. Most of the students in the top universities of Thailand have attended at least one cram class, especially in science-based faculties such as science, engineering, medicine, and pharmacy. Those who failed in their first year are called \\"Deksil\\". They will spend their whole year to study at home or at cram school for the better chance of going to top universities like Chulalongkorn University, Thammasart University, Kasetsart University, Mahidol University, or King Mongkut's University of Technology Thonburi. =Turkey= The \\"dershane\\" (plural, dershaneler) system is the Turkish counterpart of cram schools. The Turkish dershane system resembles Indian and Japanese systems. Students, typically after school and on weekends (especially during the last year), are drilled on various aspects of YKS, \\"Higher Education Foundations Examination\\". This is cheaper than private tutoring. =United Kingdom= Crammers first appeared in Britain after 1855 when the Civil Service Commission created the Administrative class of government employees, selected by examination and interview rather than patronage. Crammers offered to prepare men of 18 to 25 years old for these examinations, mainly in classics, economics and foreign languages, which would provide entry to civil service or diplomatic careers. The opening scenes of Benjamin Britten's 1971 television opera Owen Wingrave, and the 1892 novella by Henry James on which it is based, are set in a military crammer; its master plays an important role in both. Retrieved from archive.org. Terence Rattigan's 1936 play French Without Tears is set in a language crammer typical of the period. These civil service crammers did not survive the Second World War. Tutorial colleges in the United Kingdom are also called \\"crammers\\", and are attended by some who want to attend the most prestigous universities. They have been around since the early 20th century. =United States= A number of businesses, called \\"tutoring services\\" or \\"test preparation centers\\", are colloquially known as cram schools. Such supplementary instruction is used in the United States as a way to assist students who have learning disabilities or are struggling academically in a particular subject. They are also used by some GED candidates* ACT, Inc. - publisher of the ACT (test) and by many upperclassmen in high schools to prepare for the SAT, ACT, and/or Advanced Placement exams. Their curriculum are geared more towards vocabulary drills, problem sets, practicing essay composition, and learning effective test-taking strategies. College graduates and undergraduates near graduation will sometimes attend such classes to prepare for entrance exams necessary for graduate level education (i.e. LSAT, DAT, MCAT, GRE). Review courses for the CPA examination (e.g., Becker Conviser, part of Devry University) and the bar examination (e.g., Barbri) are often taken by undergraduate and graduate students in accountancy and law.

He was elected following a popular uprising against the United States- backed dictator Jorge Ubico that began the Guatemalan Revolution. He remained in office until 1951, surviving 25 coup attempts. He did not contest the election of 1951, instead choosing to hand over power to Jacobo √Årbenz. As president, he enacted several social reform policies, including an increase in the minimum wage and a series of literacy programs. He also oversaw the drafting of a new constitution in 1945. Biography Ar√©valo Bermejo in his teenage years in a family portrait Ar√©valo served as President from 15 March 1945 to 15 March 1951. He was elected in 1944, in a contest which is generally reckoned as the first truly free election in the country's history. Ar√©valo won over 86 percent of the vote, garnering more than four times as many votes as the other candidates combined. It is still the largest margin of victory for a free election in the country's history. Ar√©valo's administration was marked by unprecedented relatively free political life during his six-year term. Ar√©valo, an educator and philosopher, understood the need for advancement in individuals, communities, and nations by practical means. Before his presidency, Ar√©valo had been an exiled university professor. He returned to Guatemala to help in the reconstruction efforts of the new post- Ub√≠co government, especially in the areas of social security. He also helped draft a new constitution which granted the people civil rights and liberties they had never previously known. His philosophy of \\"spiritual socialism,\\" referred to as Arevalismo, may be considered less an economic system than a movement toward the liberation of the imagination of oppressed Latin America. In the post-World War II period, the governments of the United States and other countries misinterpreted Arevalismo as communism, serving as a cause for unease and alarm, which garnered support from neighboring satellite caudillos such as Anastasio Somoza Garc√≠a. Many foreign estates, especially those undeveloped for agriculture, were confiscated and redistributed to peasants; landowners were obliged to provide adequate housing for their workers; new schools, hospitals, and houses were built; and a new minimum wage was introduced. In Guatemala's cities, newly-enfranchised labor unions accompanied reformist labor laws that greatly benefitted the urban lower and middle classes. Several parties and trade unions were formed. The enfranchisement of a large proportion of the population was a significant legacy of his term. The benefits did not spread to the rural agrarian areas where hacendado traditions, termed latifundia, remained patrician, racist, unyielding, and harsh. Whilst the government made some effort to improve campesino peasants' civil rights, rural conditions in Guatemala could not be improved without large-scale agrarian reform, proposed as mediated and fairly compensated land redistribution. Failure in achieving that was a weakness for Ar√©valo's party in Congress and thus for his administration, which his successor attempted to confront and to remedy with Decree 900. Ar√©valo was succeeded by Jacobo √Årbenz Guzm√°n, who continued the agrarian reform approach of Ar√©valo's government. Ar√©valo freely yielded succession to his presidency in 1951 to Jacobo √Årbenz in the second democratic election in Guatemala's republican history. Following √Årbenz's expulsion in 1954, open democracy would not return to a destabilized Guatemala for three decades. Ar√©valo went into voluntary exile in Mexico as a university professor and writer. On 27 March 1963 he returned to his country to announce his candidacy for the November presidential elections. Dictator Miguel Yd√≠goras Fuentes, who, despite the firm opposition of the Kennedy administration, had pledged to oversee a free and open election in which Ar√©valo would participate, flew into exile to Nicaragua after he was deposed in a coup on 31 March 1963. Enrique Peralta Azurdia then seized power, and Ar√©valo fled the country again. Spiritual socialism (Arevalismo) Categorized as a dedicated democrat and nationalist, Juan Jos√© Ar√©valo defined his political philosophy as \\"spiritual socialism\\". The ideology was directed towards the moral development of Guatemalans with the intent to \\"liberate man psychologically\\". Ar√©valo, the revolution‚Äôs intellectual pillar, positioned his theoretical doctrine as integral to the construction of a progressive and peaceful Guatemalan society. Governments are capable of initiating the formation of an ideal society by allowing citizens the freedom to pursue their own opinions, property and way of life. The revolution's first president asserted that safeguarding the free will of citizens generates popular support for governmental institutions, which ensure the security of the individual and collective equally. Arevalismo did emphasize the importance of civil freedoms as the essential groundwork for human development, but the political principle maintained that \\"Individual liberty must be exercised within the limits of social order\\".Handy, Gift of the Devil, 107. Democracy, according to Ar√©valo, was a social structure that required the restriction of civil rights in the event individual liberties conflict with national security and the will of the majority. The limit on civil rights appears contradictory to the notion of a Guatemalan government that expresses the free will of the people. However, the ambiguity is associated with Ar√©valo's dismissal of classical liberalism as an applicable guideline for Guatemalan governments.Immerman, The Revolutionary Governments, 47. Ar√©valo's rejection of Western oriented liberal individualism and apparent socialist inclinations led conservative sectors of the press to denounce the revolutionary president as a communist. Ar√©valo opposed classical Marxism's materialist tendency and affirmed that \\"Communism is contrary to human nature, for it is contrary to the psychology of man\\".Handy, Gift of the Devil, 111. Spiritual socialism‚Äôs anti-communist stance was apparent through Ar√©valo's suppression of various communist influenced initiatives operating in Guatemala. The president exiled several communist activists, declined to legalize the Communist Party of Guatemala, removed government officials with ties to the communist newspaper and shut down the Marxist instruction facility known as Escuela Claridad. Regardless of the aforementioned measures, Ar√©valo endured nearly 30 attempted coups from members of the Guatemalan military due to his perceived empathy for communists. He responded to anti-communists' attacks in a speech to the U.S. Congress in which he said, referring to World War II, \\"I fear the West has won the battle, but in its blind attacks on social welfare will lose the war to fascism.\\"Relentless Persistence: Nonviolent Action in Latin America [McManus & Schlabach, eds., New Society 1991]. The character of the 1944 revolution, envisioned by Ar√©valo, was based on the development of a modern social democratic society.Handy, Gift of the Devil, 103. A conversion from the remaining presence of feudalistic arrangements to a democratic socialist system was an aspiration of the revolutionary Guatemalan government. Ar√©valo's political philosophy stressed the importance of government intervention in the realm of economic and social interests as necessary to sustain the desires of the majority's free will. Deviating from Marxism, Ar√©valo valued property rights with the aim to subordinate them to benefit Guatemala as a whole if required. Overall, Ar√©valo sought to improve the social environment of the working majority through a reform of the capitalist mode of production. As a result, Ar√©valo was disliked by the Catholic church and the military, and faced at least 25 unsuccessful coup attempts during his presidency. Arevalismo was considered a popular movement opposed to firm authoritarian rule with the overarching objective to free Guatemala from its dependent status to the developed states. Private life Ar√©valo was married at the time of his presidency to Elisa Mart√≠nez. He had a relationship with Ala√≠de Foppa, by whom he had a son, Julio Sol√≥rzano Foppa. At the time of his death, he was married to Margarita de Leon and had five children.  Works  He is the author of a scathing allegorical short story \\"The Shark and the Sardines,\\" published in 1956. In 1963 he published a sequel entitled \\"Anti-Communism in Latin America\\".

Hyperthermophiles are often within the domain Archaea, although some bacteria are able to tolerate temperatures of around 100 ¬∞C (212 ¬∞F), as well. Some bacteria can live at temperatures higher than 100 ¬∞C at large depths in sea where water does not boil because of high pressure. Many hyperthermophiles are also able to withstand other environmental extremes such as high acidity or high radiation levels. Hyperthermophiles are a subset of extremophiles. History Hyperthermophiles isolated from hot springs in Yellowstone National Park were first reported by Thomas D. Brock in 1965.Joseph Seckbach, et al.: Polyextremophiles - life under multiple forms of stress. Springer, Dordrecht 2013, ,preface; @google booksThe Value of Basic Research: Discovery of Thermus aquaticus and Other Extreme Thermophiles Since then, more than 70 species have been established.Hyperthermophilic Microorganisms The most extreme hyperthermophiles live on the superheated walls of deep-sea hydrothermal vents, requiring temperatures of at least 90 ¬∞C for survival. An extraordinary heat-tolerant hyperthermophile is Strain 121,Microbe from depths takes life to hottest known limit which has been able to double its population during 24 hours in an autoclave at 121 ¬∞C (hence its name). The current record growth temperature is 122 ¬∞C, for Methanopyrus kandleri. Although no hyperthermophile has shown to thrive at temperatures >122 ¬∞C, their existence is possible. Strain 121 survives 130 ¬∞C for two hours, but was not able to reproduce until it had been transferred into a fresh growth medium, at a relatively cooler 103 ¬∞C. Research Early research into hyperthermophiles speculated that their genome could be characterized by high guanine-cytosine content; however, recent studies show that \\"there is no obvious correlation between the GC content of the genome and the optimal environmental growth temperature of the organism.\\"High guanine-cytosine content is not an adaptation to high temperature: a comparative analysis amongst prokaryotes The protein molecules in the hyperthermophiles exhibit hyperthermostability‚Äîthat is, they can maintain structural stability (and therefore function) at high temperatures. Such proteins are homologous to their functional analogues in organisms which thrive at lower temperatures, but have evolved to exhibit optimal function at much greater temperatures. Most of the low-temperature homologues of the hyperthermostable proteins would be denatured above 60 ¬∞C. Such hyperthermostable proteins are often commercially important, as chemical reactions proceed faster at high temperatures.\\"Analysis of Nanoarchaeum equitans genome and proteome composition: indications for hyperthermophilic and parasitic adaptation.\\" Cell structure The cell membrane contains high levels of saturated fatty acids to retain its shape at high temperatures.

This organism is thermophilic and can grow at temperatures from 35 ¬∞C to 70 ¬∞C (94.998 to 158 ¬∞F). Chloroflexus aurantiacus can survive in the dark if oxygen is available. When grown in the dark, Chloroflexus aurantiacus has a dark orange color. When grown in sunlight it is dark green. The individual bacteria tend to form filamentous colonies enclosed in sheaths, which are known as trichomes. Physiology As a genus, Chloroflexus spp. are filamentous anoxygenic phototrophic (FAP) organisms that utilize type II photosynthetic reaction centers containing bacteriochlorophyll a similar to the purple bacteria, and light-harvesting chlorosomes containing bacteriochlorophyll c similar to green sulfur bacteria of the Chlorobi. Like other members of its phylum (cf. Chloroflexi), the species stains Gram negative, yet has a single lipid layer (monoderm), but with thin peptidoglycan, which is compensated for by S-layer protein. As the name implies, these anoxygenic phototrophs do not produce oxygen as a byproduct of photosynthesis, in contrast to oxygenic phototrophs such as cyanobacteria, algae, and higher plants. While oxygenic phototrophs use water as an electron donor for phototrophy, Chloroflexus uses reduced sulfur compounds such as hydrogen sulfide, thiosulfate, or elemental sulfur. This belies their obsolescent name green non-sulfur bacteria; however, Chloroflexus spp. can also utilize hydrogen(H2) as a source of electrons. Chloroflexus aurantiacus is thought to grow photoheterotrophically in nature, but it has the capability of fixing inorganic carbon through photoautotrophic growth. Instead of using the Calvin-Benson-Bassham Cycle typical of plants, Chloroflexus aurantiacus has been demonstrated to use an autotrophic pathway known as the 3-Hydroxypropionate pathway. The complete electron transport chain for Chloroflexus spp. is not yet known. Particularly, Chloroflexus aurantiacus has not been demonstrated to have a cytochrome bc1 complex, and may use different proteins to reduce cytochrome c Evolution of photosynthesis One of the main reasons for interest in Chloroflexus aurantiacus is in the study of the evolution of photosynthesis. As terrestrial mammals, we are most familiar with photosynthetic plants such as trees. However, photosynthetic eukaryotes are a relatively recent evolutionary development. Photosynthesis by eukaryotic organisms can be traced back to endosymbiotic events in which non-photosynthetic eukaryotes internalized photosynthetic organisms. The chloroplasts of trees still retain their own DNA as a molecular remnant that indicated their origin as photosynthetic bacteria. =The \\"respiration early\\" hypothesis= How did photosynthesis arise in bacteria? The answer to this question is complicated by the fact that there are several types of light-harvesting energy capture systems. Chloroflexus aurantiacus has been of interest in the search for origins of the so-called type II photosynthetic reaction center. One idea is that bacteria with respiratory electron transport evolved photosynthesis by coupling a light- harvesting energy capture system to the pre-existing respiratory electron transport chain. Thus, rare organisms like Chloroflexus aurantiacus that can survive using either respiration or photosynthesis are of interest in on-going attempts to trace the evolution of photosynthesis.

Bedford, Canada. These are Middle Cambrian marine sediments. This formation covers over half of Nova Scotia and is recorded as being 8,800 m (29,000 ft) thick in some areas. In geology and related fields, a stratum (plural: strata) is a layer of sedimentary rock or soil, or igneous rock that was formed at the Earth's surface, with internally consistent characteristics that distinguish it from other layers. The \\"stratum\\" is the fundamental unit in a stratigraphic column and forms the basis of the study of stratigraphy. A stratum can be seen in almost every single country in the world. Characteristics The Permian through Jurassic strata in the Colorado Plateau area of southeastern Utah demonstrate the principles of stratigraphy. These strata make up much of the famous prominent rock formations in widely spaced protected areas such as Capitol Reef National Park and Canyonlands National Park. From top to bottom: Rounded tan domes of the Navajo Sandstone, layered red Kayenta Formation, cliff-forming, vertically jointed, red Wingate Sandstone, slope-forming, purplish Chinle Formation, layered, lighter-red Moenkopi Formation, and white, layered Cutler Formation sandstone. Picture from Glen Canyon National Recreation Area, Utah. Each layer is generally one of a number of parallel layers that lie one upon another, laid down by natural processes. They may extend over hundreds of thousands of square kilometers of the Earth's surface. Strata are typically seen as bands of different colored or differently structured material exposed in cliffs, road cuts, quarries, and river banks. Individual bands may vary in thickness from a few millimeters to a kilometer or more. A band may represent a specific mode of deposition: river silt, beach sand, coal swamp, sand dune, lava bed, etc. Naming Geologists study rock strata and categorize them by the material of beds. Each distinct layer is typically assigned a name, usually based on a town, river, mountain, or region where the formation is exposed and available for study. For example, the Burgess Shale is a thick exposure of dark, occasionally fossiliferous, shale exposed high in the Canadian Rockies near Burgess Pass. Slight distinctions in material in a formation may be described as \\"members\\" (or sometimes \\"beds\\"). Formations are collected into \\"groups\\" while groups may be collected into \\"supergroups\\".

A student getting food from a school cafeteria A cafeteria, sometimes called a canteen outside the U.S., is a type of food service venue location in which there is little or no waiting staff table service, whether a restaurant or within an institution such as a large office building or school; a school dining location is also referred to as a dining hall or lunchroom (in American English). Cafeterias are different from coffeehouses, although the English term came from Latin American Spanish, where it had and still has the meaning \\"coffeehouse\\". Instead of table service, there are food-serving counters/stalls or booths, either in a line or allowing arbitrary walking paths. Customers take the food that they desire as they walk along, placing it on a tray. In addition, there are often stations where customers order food, particularly items such as hamburgers or tacos which must be served hot and can be immediately prepared with little waiting. Alternatively, the patron is given a number and the item is brought to their table. For some food items and drinks, such as sodas, water, or the like, customers collect an empty container, pay at the check-out, and fill the container after the check-out. Free unlimited second servings are often allowed under this system. For legal purposes (and the consumption patterns of customers), this system is rarely, if at all, used for alcoholic drinks in the United States. Customers are either charged a flat rate for admission (as in a buffet) or pay at the check- out for each item. Some self-service cafeterias charge by the weight of items on a patron's plate. In universities and colleges, some students pay for three meals a day by making a single large payment for the entire semester. As cafeterias require few employees, they are often found within a larger institution, catering to the clientele of that institution. For example, schools, colleges and their residence halls, department stores, hospitals, museums, places of worship, amusement parks, military bases, prisons, factories and office buildings often have cafeterias. Although some of such institutions self-operate their cafeterias, many outsource their cafeterias to a food service management company or lease space to independent businesses to operate food service facilities. The three largest food service management companies servicing institutions are Aramark, Compass Group, and Sodexo. At one time, upscale cafeteria-style restaurants dominated the culture of the Southern United States, and to a lesser extent the Midwest. There were numerous prominent chains of them: Bickford's, Morrison's Cafeteria, Piccadilly Cafeteria, S&W; Cafeteria, Apple House, Luby's, K&W;, Britling, Wyatt's Cafeteria and Blue Boar among them. Currently, two Midwestern chains still exist, Sloppy Jo's Lunchroom and Manny's, which are both located in Illinois. There were also a number of smaller chains, usually located in and around a single city. These institutions, with the exception of K&W;, went into a decline in the 1960s with the rise of fast food and were largely finished off in the 1980s by the rise of \\"casual dining\\". A few chains ‚Äî particularly Luby's and Piccadilly Cafeterias (which took over the Morrison's chain in 1998) ‚Äî continue to fill some of the gap left by the decline of the older chains. Some of the smaller Midwestern chains, such as MCL Cafeterias centered on Indianapolis, are still very much in business. History Childs Restaurant, Philadelphia, PA, circa 1908 Divided trays from an East German canteen in the late 1960s. Perhaps the first self-service restaurant (not necessarily a cafeteria) in the U.S. was the Exchange Buffet in New York City, opened September 4, 1885, which catered to an exclusively male clientele. Food was purchased at a counter and patrons ate standing up.John F. Mariani, America Eats Out, William Morrow & Co (October 1991), This represents the predecessor of two formats: the cafeteria, described below and the automat. During the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago, entrepreneur John Kruger built an American version of the sm√∂rg√•sbords he had seen while traveling in Sweden. Emphasising the simplicity and light fare, he called it the 'Cafeteria' - Spanish for 'coffee shop'. The exposition attracted over 27 million visitors (half the U.S. population at the time) in six months, and it was because of Kruger's operation that America first heard the term and experienced the self-service dining format.Amy Zuber, \\"Samuel & William Childs\\", Nations Restaurant News, February 1996\\"A Restaurant Timeline\\", CuisineNet Diner's Digest, retrieved April 28, 2009 A high school cafeteria in Calhan, Colorado. Hospital cafeteria tray line server in Port Charlotte, Florida Meanwhile, in mid-scale America, the chain of Childs Restaurants quickly grew from about 10 locations in New York City in 1890 to hundreds across the U.S. and Canada by 1920. Childs is credited with the innovation of adding trays and a \\"tray line\\" to the self-service format, introduced in 1898 at their 130 Broadway location. Childs did not change its format of sit-down dining, however. This was soon the standard design for most Childs Restaurants, and many ultimately the dominant design for cafeterias. It has been conjectured that the 'cafeteria craze' started in May 1905, when Helen Mosher opened a downtown L.A. restaurant where people chose their food at a long counter and carried their trays to their tables.Charles Perry, \\"The cafeteria: an L.A. original\\", The Los Angeles Times, November 5, 2003 California has a long history in the cafeteria format - notably the Boos Brothers Cafeterias, and the Clifton's and Schaber's. The earliest cafeterias in California were opened at least 12 years after Kruger's Cafeteria, and Childs already had many locations around the country. Horn & Hardart, an automat format chain (different from cafeterias), was well established in the mid-Atlantic region before 1900. Between 1960 and 1981, the popularity of cafeterias was overcome by the fast food restaurant and fast casual restaurant formats. Outside the United States, the development of cafeterias can be observed in France as early as 1881 with the passing of the Ferry Law. This law mandated that public school education be available to all children. Accordingly, the government also encouraged schools to provide meals for students in need, thus resulting in the conception of cafeterias or cantine (in French). According to Abramson, prior to the creation of cafeterias, only some students were able to bring home-cooked meals and able to be properly fed in schools. As cafeterias in France became more popular, their use spread beyond schools and into the workforce. Thus, due to pressure from workers and eventually new labor laws, sizable businesses had to, at minimum, provide established eating areas for its workers. Support for this practice was also reinforced by the effects of World War II when the importance of national health and nutrition came under great attention.Abramson, Julia Luisa. Food culture in France. Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 2007. 122-23. Print. Other names Port Charlotte, Florida high school A cafetorium of St. Joan of Arc Catholic Academy in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. A cafeteria in a U.S. military installation is known as a chow hall, a mess hall, a galley, mess decks or, more formally, a dining facility, often abbreviated to DFAC, whereas in common British Armed Forces parlance, it is known as a cookhouse or mess. Students in the United States often refer to cafeterias as lunchrooms, which also often serve school breakfast. Some school cafeterias in the U.S. and Canada have stages and movable seating that allow use as auditoriums. These rooms are known as cafetoriums. In some older facilities, a school's gymnasium is also often used as a cafeteria with the kitchen facility being hidden behind a rolling partition outside non-meal hours. Cafeterias serving university dormitories are sometimes called dining halls or dining commons. A food court is a type of cafeteria found in many shopping malls and airports featuring multiple food vendors or concessions, although a food court could equally be styled as a type of restaurant as well, being more aligned with public, rather than institutionalised, dining. Some institutions, especially schools, have food courts with stations offering different types of food served by the institution itself (self-operation) or a single contract management company, rather than leasing space to numerous businesses. Some monasteries, boarding schools, and older universities refer to their cafeteria as a refectory. Modern-day British cathedrals and abbeys, notably in the Church of England, often use the phrase refectory to describe a cafeteria open to the public. Historically, the refectory was generally only used by monks and priests. For example, although the original 800-year-old refectory at Gloucester Cathedral (the stage setting for dining scenes in the Harry Potter movies) is now mostly used as a choir practice area, the relatively modern 300-year-old extension, now used as a cafeteria by staff and public alike, is today referred to as the refectory. A cafeteria located within a movie or TV studio complex is often called a commissary. College cafeteria The main dining hall of Pensacola Christian College A college canteen in India. In American English, a college cafeteria is a cafeteria intended for college students. In British English it is often called the refectory. These cafeterias can be a part of a residence hall or in a separate building. Many of these colleges employ their own students to work in the cafeteria. The number of meals served to students varies from school to school, but is normally around 21 meals per week. Like normal cafeterias, a person will have a tray to select the food that they want, but (at some campuses) instead of paying money, pays beforehand by purchasing a meal plan. The method of payment for college cafeterias is commonly in the form of a meal plan, whereby the patron pays a certain amount at the start of the semester and details of the plan are stored on a computer system. Student ID cards are then used to access the meal plan. Meal plans can vary widely in their details and are often not necessary to eat at a college cafeteria. Typically, the college tracks students' usage of their plan by counting the number of predefined meal servings, points, dollars or number of buffet dinners. The plan may give the student a certain number of any of the above per week or semester and they may or may not roll over to the next week or semester. Many schools offer several different options for using their meal plans. The main cafeteria is usually where most of the meal plan is used but smaller cafeterias, caf√©s, restaurants, bars or even fast food chains located on campus, on nearby streets, or in the surrounding town or city may accept meal plans. A college cafeteria system often has a virtual monopoly on the students due to an isolated location or a requirement that residence contracts include a full meal plan.

He was created Viscount Falkland in the Scottish peerage in 1620. He was Lord Deputy of Ireland from 1622 until 1629. Early life Cary was the son of Sir Edward Cary, of Berkhamstead and Aldenham, Hertfordshire, Master and Treasurer of His Majesty's Jewels, and his wife Catherine Knevet or Katherine Knyvett, daughter of Sir Henry Knevet or Knyvett, Master of the Jewel Office to Queen Elizabeth and King James, and wife Anne Pickering, and widow of Henry Paget, 2nd Baron Paget. His father was the son of Sir John Cary (d. 9 September 1552) and wife Joice Denny (d. from 10 November 1560 to 30 January 1560/61) and nephew of Sir William Carey. He entered Gray's Inn in 1590 and entered Exeter College, Oxford in 1593 at the age of sixteen. According to Wood, by the aid of a good tutor Cary became highly accomplished. Subsequently, he served in France and the Low Countries, and was taken prisoner by Don Luis de Velasco, probably at the Siege of Ostend (a fact referred to in the epigram on Sir Henry Cary by Ben Jonson). Court of Elizabeth I and James I On his return to England Cary was introduced to court, and became Gentleman of the Bedchamber. He was knighted at Dublin in 1599.Editors, Vicary Gibbs and H.A. Doubleday. In 1601 he was elected Member of Parliament for Hertfordshire. He was a JP for Hertfordshire in 1601. He became joint master of the jewels with his father on 21 June 1603. In 1604 he was re-elected MP for Hertfordshire. At the investiture of Charles Prince of Wales in 1616 he was created a Knight of the Bath In 1617 he became Comptroller of the Household and a Privy Councillor. He succeeded to the family estates on the death of his father in 1618. He was created Viscount Falkland in the county of Fife, in the Scottish peerage on 10 November 1620 (the title, with his naturalisation, was confirmed by Charles I by diploma in 1627). In 1621 he was re-elected MP for Hertfordshire; his Scots peerage gave him the right, which he was the first to exercise, of sitting in the English Commons.Footnote refers. The work dates the start of this, his last session in the Commons, as 1620. Chiefly through the favour of George Villiers, Duke of Buckingham Cary was appointed to succeed Sir Oliver St John, as Lord Deputy of Ireland. His patent was sealed in March 1622 and he was sworn on 18 September 1622. In office he showed himself both bigoted in his opinions and timid in carrying out a policy which continually dallied with extremes. Although he was conscientious, he was easily offended, and he failed to conduct himself with credit when confronted with any unusual difficulties. Falkland was greatly distressed at the number of priests in Ireland and their influence over the people. He was influenced by a sermon of James Ussher on the text \\"He beareth not the sword in vain\\", and issued a proclamation on 21 January 1623, ordering their banishment from the country. This proclamation was highly inappropriate at the time because of the (ultimately unsuccessful) negotiations for the Spanish marriage of the Prince of Wales. In February 1624 he received an order from the English privy council to refrain from more extreme measures than preventing the erection of religious houses and the congregation of unlawful assemblies. Service under Charles I Falkland convened an assembly of the nobility of Ireland on 22 September 1626, on account of the difficulties of maintaining the English army in Ireland. He laid before the assembly a draft of concessions promised by Charles, which were subsequently known as the \\"Graces\\". They promised the removal of certain religious disabilities and the recognition of sixty years' possession as a bar to all claims of the crown based on irregularities of title. Falkland did not conduct the negotiations with skill, and for a long time there seemed no hope of a satisfactory settlement. Finally in May 1628, a deputation from the nobility agreed, before the king and privy council at Whitehall, on certain additional concessions in the \\"Graces\\" and then confirmed, that Ireland should provide a sum of ¬£4,000 for the army for three years. Falkland believed that his difficulties with the nobility had been largely due to the intrigues of the Lord Chancellor of Ireland, Adam, Viscount Loftus, After the dissolution of the assembly of the nobility in 1627, he brought a charge against Loftus of malversation, and of giving encouragement to the nobility to refuse supplies. After the case had been heard in London, Lord Loftus was allowed to return to his duties pending further inquiry. Falkland had for some years been engaged in tracking out what he supposed was a dangerous conspiracy of the Byrnes of Wicklow, and in August 1628 was able to announce to Charles I that the result of his protracted investigations had been successful, a true bill having been found against them at the Wicklow assizes. The aim of Falkland was to set up a plantation in Wicklow on the confiscated estates of the Byrnes, but as his designs were disapproved of by the commissioners of Irish causes, the king appointed a committee of the Irish privy council to investigate the matter more fully. Falkland took deep offence because one of the members of committee was the lord chancellor, Loftus and he refused to afford any assistance in the investigation on account of the \\"high indignity\\" offered to himself. see: \\"A Copie of the Apollogie of the Lord Viscount Faulkland, Lord Deputie of Ireland, to the Lords of his Majestie's Privie Counsell, the 8th December, 1628\\", printed from the Harleian MS. 2305, in Gilbert's History of the Irish Confederation, i. 210‚Äì17. When, as the result of the inquiry, it was discovered that the Byrnes had been the victims of false witnesses, Falkland was, on 10 August 1629, directed to hand over his authority to the lords justices on the pretext that his services were required in England. Charles I, recognising his good intentions, continued him in favour. Cary broke his leg, which then had to be amputated, in Theobalds Park and as a result, he died in September 1633. He was buried on 25 September 1633 at Aldenham. Patron of the arts Falkland continued throughout his life to cultivate his literary tastes. An epitaph by him on Elizabeth, countess of Huntingdon, is given in Wilford's ‚ÄòMemorials.‚Äô Among his papers was found ‚ÄòThe History of the most unfortunate Prince, King Edward II, with choice political observations on him and his unhappy favourites, Gaveston and Spencer,‚Äô which was published with a preface attributed to Sir James Harrington in 1680. Falkland was in the habit of ingeniously concealing the year of his age in a knot flourished beneath his name, a device by which he is said to have detected a forger who had failed to recognise its significance. Family Cary married in 1602 Elizabeth Tanfield (1585‚Äì1639), daughter and heiress of Sir Lawrence Tanfield, lord chief baron of the exchequer, and his wife Elizabeth Symonds, daughter of Giles Symondes of Claye, Norfolk. She was aged fifteen at the time of the marriage and had a high reputation for her learning. In very early years she showed a strong inclination for the study of languages, mastering French, Spanish, Italian, Latin, Hebrew, and Transylvanian. As a result of her study of the fathers, she was converted to the Catholic faith, when about nineteen years of age. However she did not acknowledge the change in her opinions till twenty years afterwards. Elizabeth accompanied her husband to Dublin, where she took a great interest in the establishment of industrial schools. When Cary learned of her change of faith they quarrelled, and she left Dublin in 1625. The Privy Council allowed her a separate maintenance of ¬£500 a year. After her husband's return to England they became reconciled, but continued to live separately. On account of her change of faith, her father probably passed her over in his will (for the circumstances see under Lucius Cary). When her husband died she had only the annuity of ¬£200 a year given her by her parents. She died in October 1639. One of the most intimate friends of Lady Falkland was William Chillingworth, but after his conversion to Protestantism she blamed him for endeavouring to pervert her children. She published a translation of French Cardinal Jacques Davy Duperron's reply to the attack on his works by King James, but the book was ordered burned. Afterwards she translated the whole of Perron's works for the benefit of scholars at Oxford and Cambridge, which was never printed. She also wrote in verse the lives of St. Mary Magdalene, St. Agnes the Martyr, and St. Elizabeth of Portugal, as well as numerous hymns in honour of the Virgin Mary. The collected edition of the works of John Marston (1633) is dedicated to her. Of the 11 children of Lord and Lady Falkland there are records of nine, four sons and five daughters: *Lucius, became 2nd Viscount Falkland but during his father's life was confined in the Fleet prison, his father's petition to the king praying for the release of his son, is preserved in the Harleian MS. 1581, where there are also four letters to Falkland from the Duke of Buckingham, has been printed in the ‚ÄòCabala.‚Äô *Lawrence (Lorenzo), was knighted and was killed fighting under Sir Charles Coote (the elder) at Battle of Swords in 1642. *Patrick, was the author of some poems * Catherine (d. 1625) married James Home, 2nd Earl of Home * Placid (Henry), took orders in the Catholic Church. * Four daughters, Anne, who had been maid of honour to the queen, Lucy, Elizabeth, and Mary, ultimately became nuns in the Convent of Cambray.

He has been called \\"Scotland's greatest nineteenth-century churchman\\". He served as Vice- president of the Royal Society of Edinburgh from 1835‚Äì42. The New Zealand town of Port Chalmers was named after Chalmers. A bust of Chalmers is on display in the Hall of Heroes of the National Wallace Monument in Stirling. The Thomas Chalmers Centre in Kirkliston is named after him. Early life Chalmers' birthplace in Anstruther He was born at Anstruther in Fife, the son of Elizabeth Hall and John Chalmers, a merchant.https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp1.pdf Age 11 Chalmers attended the University of St Andrews studying mathematics. In January 1799 he was licensed as a preacher of the gospel by the St Andrews presbytery. In May 1803, after attending further courses of lectures at the University of Edinburgh, and acting as assistant to the professor of mathematics at St Andrews, he was ordained as minister of Kilmany, about 9 miles from the university town, where he continued to lecture.* Kilmany was a small and predominantly agricultural parish, with a population under 800 in 1811. Lecturer and minister Chalmers made an issue within the University of St Andrews of the quality of mathematics teaching. It came to involve attacks on John Rotheram, the professor of natural philosophy. His mathematical lectures roused enthusiasm, but they were discontinued by order of the authorities. Chalmers then opened mathematical classes on his own account which attracted many students; at the same time he delivered a course of lectures on chemistry, and ministered to his parish at Kilmany. In 1805 he became a candidate for the vacant professorship of mathematics at the University of Edinburgh, but was unsuccessful. In 1815 he became minister of the Tron Church, Glasgow, in spite of determined opposition to him in the town council on the grounds of his evangelical teaching. From Glasgow his reputation as a preacher spread throughout the United Kingdom. When he visited London Samuel Wilberforce wrote, \\"all the world is wild about Dr Chalmers.\\" At this time he lived at Wellington Place in Glasgow.Glasgow Post Office Directory 1817 Parochial work In November 1817 Chalmers used a memorial sermon for Princess Charlotte of Wales to appeal for a Christian effort to deal with the social condition of Glasgow. His parish contained about 11,000 persons, and of these about one-third were not connected with any church. He considered that parochial organizations had not kept pace in the city with the growing population. He declared that twenty new churches, with parishes, should be erected in Glasgow; and he set to work to revive the old parochial economy of Scotland. The town council agreed to build one new church, attaching to it a parish of 10,000 persons, mostly weavers, labourers and factory workers, and this church was offered to Chalmers. In September 1819 he became minister of the church and parish of St John, where of 2000 families more than 800 had no connection with any Christian church. He first addressed himself to providing schools for the children. Two school-houses with four endowed teachers were established, where 700 children were taught, at moderate fees. Between 40 and 50 local Sabbath schools were opened, where more than 1000 children were taught. The parish was divided into 25 districts with 60 to 100 families. Chalmers was the centre of the whole system, visiting families and holding evening meetings. Moral philosopher and theologian St. Andrew's Church, Edinburgh, scene of the Disruption In 1823 Chalmers accepted the chair of moral philosophy at the University of St Andrews, the seventh academic offer made to him during his eight years in Glasgow. His lectures led some students to devote themselves to missionary effort. Among his pupils were William Lindsay Alexander, Alexander Duff, and James Aitken Wylie. At this period Robert Morrison and Joshua Marshman visited St Andrews. In November 1828 Chalmers was transferred to the chair of theology at the University Edinburgh. He then introduced the practice of following the lecture with a viva voce examination on what had been delivered. He also introduced text- books. Chalmers' townhouse on the Moray Estate, 3 Forres Street, Edinburgh In 1834 Chalmers was elected fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, and in the same year he became corresponding member of the Institute of France; in 1835 Oxford conferred on him the degree of DCL. At this time he was living at 3 Forres Street on the Moray Estate in the west end of Edinburgh. In 1834 he became leader of the evangelical section of the Scottish Church in the General Assembly. He was appointed chairman of a committee for church extension, and in that capacity made a tour through a large part of Scotland, addressing presbyteries and holding public meetings. He also issued numerous appeals, with the result that in 1841, when he resigned his office as convener of the church extension committee, he was able to announce that in seven years upwards of ¬£300,000 had been contributed, and 220 new churches had been built. His efforts to induce the Whig government to assist in this effort were unsuccessful. Thomas Duncan, 1840 In 1840 Chalmers was unsuccessful in applying for the chair of divinity at the University of Glasgow. It went to the Moderate Alexander Hill. Non-intrusionism and the Free Church Chalmers found himself at the head of the party in the Church of Scotland which stood for \\"non-intrusionism\\": the principle that no minister should be intruded into any parish contrary to the will of the congregation. Cases of conflict between the church and the civil power arose in Auchterarder, Dunkeld and Marnoch. The courts made it clear that the Church, in their opinion, held its temporalities on condition of rendering such obedience as the courts required. The Church then appealed to the government for relief. In political manoeuvres with Westminster politicians, Chalmers was opposed by John Hope. In January 1843 the government put a final negative on the church's claims for spiritual independence. The non-intrusionist movement ended in the Disruption: on 18 May 1843, 470 clergy withdrew from the general assembly and constituted themselves the Free Church of Scotland, with Chalmers as moderator. He had prepared a sustentation fund scheme for the support of the seceding ministers. In 1844, Chalmers announced a church extension campaign, for new building. In 1846 he became the first principal of the Divinity Hall of the Free Church of Scotland, as it was initially called. Later in life he was quoted as saying: \\"Who cares about the Free Church compared with the Christian good of the people of Scotland? Who cares for any Church, but as an instrument of Christian good?\\" Death The grave of Rev Thomas Chalmers, Grange Cemetery St. Giles, Edinburgh On 28 May 1847 Chalmers returned to his house at Church HillEdinburgh Post Office Directory 1847 in Morningside, near Edinburgh, from a journey to London on the subject of national education. On the following day (Saturday) he was employed in preparing a report to the General Assembly of the Free Church, then sitting. On Sunday, the 30th, he continued in his usual health and spirits, and retired to rest with the intention of rising at an early hour to finish his report. The next morning he did not make his appearance, and he was discovered lying dead in bed. Chalmers was interred in the Grange Cemetery on 4 June, the very first burial in that cemetery.Rest in Peace:Grange Association newsletter, 109 His grave is on the north wall, near the north-west access. A large crowd of persons of all denominations accompanied his remains to the grave.The Popular Encyclopedia; or, Conversations Lexicon, published by Blackie & Son, 1883. His wife Grace Pratt died 16 January 1850 and is buried with him, as is his daughter Grace Pratt Chalmers (1819-1851) and two of his other six daughters. Works Chalmers's academic years resulted in a prolific literature of various kinds: his writings fill more than 30 volumes. Contemporaries regarded him highly as a natural theologian. A series of sermons on the relation between the discoveries of astronomy and the Christian revelation was published in January 1817, and within a year nine editions and 20,000 copies were in circulation. =Political economy= On political economy, 1832 In 1808 Chalmers published an Inquiry into the Extent and Stability of National Resources, a contribution to the discussion created by Bonaparte's commercial policy. As a political economist he first dealt with: the relationship between the degree of the fertility of the soil and the social condition of a community; capital accumulation; and the general doctrine of a limit to all the modes by which national wealth may accumulate. He was the first also to advance that argument in favour of religious establishments which met on its own ground the doctrine of Adam Smith, that religion ‚Äì like other things ‚Äì should be left to the operation of the law of supply and demand. In 1826 he published a third volume of The Christian and Civic Economy of Large Towns, a continuation of work begun at St John's, Glasgow. In 1832 he published a Political Economy, the chief purpose of which was to argue that the right economic condition of the masses is dependent on their right moral condition, so that character is the parent of comfort, not vice versa. =Poor law reform= Parochial machinery gave Chalmers experience in dealing with the problem of poor relief. He became an influential thinker on poverty. Chalmers was a Malthusian in his belief that the cause of pauperism was the poor having too many children. He also thought that poor-relief officials should be tenured and business-like; and voluntary taxation was the correct way to support poor relief. When Chalmers undertook the management of the parish of St John's, the poor of the parish cost the city ¬£1400 per annum, and in four years the pauper expenditure was reduced to ¬£280 per annum. The investigation of new applications for relief was given to the deacon of the district, and an effort was made to enable the poor to help themselves. At this time there were few parishes north of the Forth and Clyde where there was a compulsory assessment for the poor, but the English method of assessment was spreading. Chalmers opposed compulsory assessment as counter-productive, and believed that relief should instead be raised and administered by voluntary means. It has been argued that Chalmers was both a paternalist, on the moral plane, and a supporter of economic individualism. Critics replied to Chalmers that his approach was impossible in large cities. William Pulteney Alison engaged in controversy with him; Chalmers countered with moral arguments. In arguing that private charity should outweigh public expenditure in relieving poverty, he was one of a group of British writers of the period of similar views, that included also Samuel Richard Bosanquet, Thomas Mozley and Frederick Oakeley. The views from Chalmers and Edinburgh had a notable effect in Wales, though Lewis Edwards, Y Traethodydd, and Owen Thomas. =Moralist= John Steell, Thomas Chalmers, statue, Edinburgh In his St Andrews lectures Chalmers excluded mental philosophy and included the whole sphere of moral obligation, dealing with man's duty to God and to his fellow-men in the light of Christian teaching. Many of his lectures were printed in the first and second volumes of his published works. In the field of ethics he made contributions in regard to the place and functions of volition and attention, the separate and underived character of the moral sentiments, and the distinction between the virtues of perfect and imperfect obligation. =Religion= At his own request the article on Christianity was assigned to him in David Brewster's Edinburgh Encyclop√¶dia. The separate publication of this article, and contributions to the Edinburgh Christian Instructor and The Eclectic Review, enhanced his reputation as an author. Chalmers's writings are a source for argument and illustration on the question of Establishment. \\"I have no veneration\\", he said to the royal commissioners in St Andrews, before either the voluntary or the non-intrusive controversies had arisen, \\"for the Church of Scotland qua an establishment, but I have the utmost veneration for it qua an instrument of Christian good.\\" =Natural theology= Chalmers' Bridgewater Treatise, in the series On the Power, Wisdom and Goodness of God as Manifested in the Adaptation of External Nature to the Moral and Intellectual Constitution of Man, appeared in two volumes 1833 and went through 6 editions. As noted by Robert M. Young, these books effectively represent an encyclopedia of pre- evolutionary natural history, commissioned and published whilst Charles Darwin was on board the . In the area of natural theology and the Christian evidences he advocated the method of reconciling the Mosaic narrative with the indefinite antiquity of the globe which William Buckland advanced in his Bridgewater Treatises, and which Chalmers had previously communicated to him. =Gap creationism= In 1814 Chalmers lectured on the concept of gap creationism, also known as the \\"gap theory\\", and subsequently spread its popularity of this idea which he credited to Episcopius. He wrote of Genesis 1:1: \\"My own opinion, as published in 1814, is that it forms no part of the first day but refers to a period of indefinite antiquity when God created the worlds out of nothing. The commencement of the first day's work I hold to be the moving of God's Spirit upon the face of the waters. We can allow geology the amplest time ... without infringing even on the literalities of the Mosaic record.\\" David Octavius Hill, Thomas Chalmers, photograph, This form of old Earth creationism posits that the six-day creation, as described in the Book of Genesis, involved literal 24-hour days, but that there was a gap of time between two distinct creations in the first and the second verses of Genesis, explaining many scientific observations, including the age of the Earth.Evolution vs. Creationism: An Introduction, Eugenie Scott, pp61-62The Scientific Case Against Scientific Creationism, Jon P. Alston, p24 Gap creationism differs from day-age creationism (which posits that the \\"days\\" of creation were much longer periods - of thousands or millions of years), and from young Earth creationism (which although it agrees concerning the six literal 24-hour days of creation, does not posit any gap of time). The \\"New College\\", as the Divinity School became known, was a centre of opposition to the Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation (1844). Chalmers himself did not mention the work, but indirectly attacked its view of development in writing for the North British Review. James A. Secord, Victorian Sensation, University of Chicago Press (2000), p. 277. Family Chalmers' eldest daughter Anne married William Hanna, who wrote a long biography of his father- in-law. His brother, Charles Chalmers, founded the Merchiston Castle School. Charles' son, David (Thomas' nephew) was a noted industrialist and owner of the Cowan & Co. paperworks. References Bibliography *.

It provides tours in North America, mostly within the United States. It operates a bus line, and hostels in Seattle and San Francisco. The company caters particularly to backpackers, both from the U.S. and abroad. Early years Green Tortoise was one of several low-cost, no-frills \\"alternative\\" bus companies established in the 1970s and based in California and the Pacific Northwest, providing long-distance bus service, but by 1982 it was one of only two still in operation. Also commonly referred to as \\"hippie bus\\" companies during the 1970s, for their counterculture vibe and casual atmosphere, the first such company was Grey Rabbit, which started in 1971 and was based in San Francisco. Gardner Kent founded Green Tortoise in 1973 and based its name on that of Grey Rabbit. Although the two companies were very similar, Grey Rabbit put more emphasis on making the journey time shorte.g. San Francisco to New York in less than four dayswhereas Kent planned a service that would be a little slower but more relaxed, with more stops (for swimming, picnics, etc.) and where the experience of the trip itself was more important. Green Tortoise bus loading in Seattle's University District, 1984Green Tortoise's buses for its first two decades or more were secondhand transit buses built in the 1950s and modified by the removal of nearly all seatsreplaced by a long foam bed in the rear two-thirds of the busand the installation of overhead luggage racks that could be converted into bunk beds. In a 1982 article in The Sunday Oregonian, a reporter for the Field News Service wrote that, \\"The hippie bus companies may have been known for speed but never comfort. Buses were old, overcrowded and prone to breakdowns ‚Äî frequently stranding their generally hirsute passengers in the often highly unsympathetic hinterlands.\\" Although the use of old buses continued, Kent made changes targeting the other problems. In 1979, Green Tortoise lengthened its cross-country journey time to seven days and began focusing more on tour bus service than on transportation. It also added trips to Mexico and Alaska. Green Tortoise, Grey Rabbit and the smaller alternative bus companies all operated informally and without licenses for interstate operation during the 1970s. In 1981, the Tortoise and Rabbit, the only two still operating, both were granted temporary operating permits by the Interstate Commerce Commission. However, ridership on the alternative buses had been declining ever since the implementation of U.S. airline deregulation in the late 1970s, which had spawned much lower airfares. Grey Rabbit went under in 1983 and was acquired by Green Tortoise. In the early 1980s, the Tortoise's fleet still consisted of buses built in the 1950s. In 1983, the company was still operating a regular weekly service from San Francisco to Portland and San Francisco to Los Angeles, along with occasional cross-country trips, in addition to its slower-paced excursions. The company had 14 buses and 50 employees at its peak, in the late 1980s. Description and destinations coach in 2007 The company's buses are fitted with bunk beds so that passengers can lounge or sleep while the bus is moving. This is done at night so that a destination can be reached in the morning. The company aims to foster a social environment among its passengers, who work together to cook most meals, which are often vegetarian.Official Green Tortoise FAQ There are usually opportunities for camping during a trip. Itineraries typically try to avoid heavily touristed locations, and prioritize places of natural and cultural interest such as national parks, monuments, forests, hot springs, or archaeological ruins. Green Tortoise has historically made trips to destinations in the United States including Alaska and regular summer coast- to-coast routes from San Francisco to Boston and back. Special trips are also arranged to festivals every year, including a Mardi Gras trip to New Orleans, the Oregon Country Fair and Burning Man, where they also operate a shuttle bus from the event into nearby Gerlach and Empire, Nevada. Trips outside the U.S. have included Mexico (including the Yucat√°n Peninsula and the Baja California Peninsula), Guatemala, Belize, and Canada. The company discontinued its regularly scheduled service between San Francisco and Seattle via Eugene and Portland in 2001, in favor of focusing on \\"adventure camping trips\\". In 1992, the company's annual revenue was around $1.4 million. It had 50 employees and a fleet of 10 buses at that time, with a bus-renovation garage in Lowell, Oregon. In 2004, the fleet was still mostly made up of 1950s ex-Greyhound buses and 1960s ex-transit buses, but at least one or two new 1990s highway coaches had been added. Hostels The Seattle Green Tortoise Hostel, at its post-2006 location Since the mid-1990s, Green Tortoise has also operated two hostels. The first one opened in Seattle in 1993 and the second in San Francisco in 1994. The Seattle hostel was originally located in the Queen Anne neighborhood, but moved in 1997 to a location on Second Avenue in downtown Seattle, taking over the former Forest Hotel after a year of remodeling. That building was demolished in 2006, and the hostel moved to a different location in downtown Seattle, on Pike Street, across from the Pike Place Market. According to The Seattle Times, Hostelworld.com named Green Tortoise's Seattle hostel one of the top ten hostels in North America in its 2009 annual awards.

After gaining praise in the nascent grunge scene, Zapata was murdered in 1993 while on her way home from a music venue, at age 27. The crime went unsolved for a decade before her killer, Jesus Mezquia, was tried, convicted and sentenced to 36 years in prison. Life and career Mia Zapata was raised in Louisville, Kentucky and attended high school at Presentation Academy. Zapata learned how to play the guitar and the piano by age nine, and was influenced by punk rock as well as jazz, blues, and R&B; singers such as Bessie Smith, Billie Holiday, Jimmy Reed, Ray Charles, Hank Williams, and Sam Cooke. In 1984, Zapata enrolled at Antioch College in Yellow Springs, Ohio as a liberal arts student. In September 1986, she and three friends formed the punk rock band The Gits. In 1989, the band relocated to Seattle, Washington. Zapata found a job at a local bar and the four band members moved into an abandoned house they called \\"The Rathouse.\\" The band released a series of well-received singles on local independent record labels from 1990 to 1991. As the Gits were making a name for themselves in the local music scene, they often played shows with their friends' band, 7 Year Bitch. In 1992, the band released its debut album Frenching the Bully. Their reputation progressively increased within the grunge scene in Seattle, before the band began work on their second and final album Enter: The Conquering Chicken, released in 1993. Zapata came from an affluent family but often lived without material comforts. As her father described it: \\"Mia [lived] in two different worlds. She lived on two different sides of the street‚Äîthe straight side on one, with parochial schools, an affluent family, and tennis clubs. But when she crossed the street, material things didn't mean anything to her.\\"Mary F. Pols, \\"Holding On to Mia's Magic‚ÄîSinger's Killing Leaves Grief in the 2 Worlds She Lived In,\\" Seattle Times, August 26, 1993. Zapata's music often led to a rejection of financial comfort, but regardless of status, Valerie Agnew describes Mia as \\"commanding respect and interest immediately\\".The Gits: The Band The Music The Legacy. Dir. Kerry O'Kane. Perf. The Gits. 2008. DVD. Zapata was well connected to her community. Peter Sheehy recalls: \\"Mia [was] the hub of several social circles; a magnetic personality who drew all sorts of people together who otherwise might never have met.\\"Tracy Johnson, \\"Singer's Killer Gets 37 Years; Mia Zapata's Friends Fill Courtroom for Sentencing of Jesus Mezquia,\\" Seattle Post-Intelligencer, May 1, 2004.

Kerry O'Kane. Perf. The Gits. 2008. DVD. Judge Sharon Armstrong, the judge during her killer's trial, highlighted Zapata as an \\"extraordinarily vibrant\\" girl, who was \\"obviously talented\\"; she was \\"struck by how closely Zapata had connected to so many people\\". The Gits The Gits, who included guitarist Andrew \\"Joe Spleen\\" Kessler, drummer Steve Moriarty, and bassist Matt Dresdner, met in Ohio in 1986. A few years later, the band decided to move to Seattle to engage in city's burgeoning music scene. Within no time the Gits had developed a following amidst the local underground punk scene. Although the group was 75% men, the band as a whole and Zapata in particular became popular amongst the feminist community of Seattle at the time. In 1990, after the move to Seattle, the Gits went on a successful international tour without the support of a record label. In 1992, their first independent album, Frenching the Bully, was released. The album had hits such as \\"Another Shot of Whiskey\\", \\"Second Skin\\", and \\"Here's to Your Fuck\\", receiving positive reviews.Vincent Jeffries, \\"Mia Zapata's Bibliography\\" All Music (2012) Throughout the recording of the second album, the band had planned a large U.S. and European tour as well as many local shows, all the while being courted by various labels. Unfortunately, before the band could finish and release their second album, Enter: The Conquering Chicken, Zapata was suddenly murdered. The band did continue making music, and found success in their second album with singles such as \\"Seaweed\\" and \\"Precious Blood\\".Becca Jones- Starr, \\"Biography: The Gits 1986‚Äì1993\\" The Gits Official Website (2014) Murder and investigation Capitol Hill Around 2 a.m. on July 7, 1993, Zapata left the Comet Tavern in the Capitol Hill area of Seattle. She stayed at a studio space in the basement of an apartment building located a block away, and briefly visited a friend who lived on the second floor. This was the last time Zapata was seen alive. She may have walked a few blocks west, or north to a friend's apartment, or may have decided to take the long walk south to her home. Zapata's body was discovered near the intersection of 24th Avenue South and South Washington Street at around 3:30 a.m, located in Seattle's Central District. She had been beaten, raped, and strangled. It is believed she encountered her attacker shortly after 2:15 a.m. Her body was not initially identified as she had no identification on her when she was found. An episode of the cable television show Forensic Files revealed that she was identified after the medical examiner, who was a fan of the Gits and had been to their concerts, recognized her. According to the medical examiner, if she had not been strangled, she would have died from the internal injuries suffered from the beating. According to court documents, an autopsy found evidence of a struggle in which Zapata suffered blunt impact to her abdomen and a lacerated liver.Ancestry.com Zapata is interred at Cave Hill Cemetery in her hometown of Louisville. The Seattle music community, including its most famous bands ‚Äì Nirvana, Pearl Jam, and Soundgarden ‚Äì helped raise $70,000 to hire a private investigator for three years. The funds dried up without any major breaks in the case, but the investigator, Leigh Hearon, continued to investigate on her own time. In 1998, after five years of investigation, Seattle police detective Dale Tallman said: \\"We're no closer to solving the case than we were right after the murder.\\" Arrest and trial In 2003, Florida fisherman Jesus Mezquia, who had come from Cuba in 1980 in the Mariel boatlift,TV show \\"causeofdeath\\" was arrested and charged in connection with Zapata's murder based on DNA evidence. A DNA profile was extracted from saliva found on Zapata's body and kept in cold storage until the STR technology was developed for full extraction. An original entry in 2001 failed to generate a positive result, but Mezquia's DNA entered the national CODIS database after he was arrested in Florida for burglary and domestic abuse in 2002. Mezquia had a history of violence toward women including domestic abuse, burglary, assault, and battery. All of his ex-girlfriends, and his wife, had filed reports against him. There was also a report of indecent exposure on file against him in Seattle within two weeks of Zapata's murder. However, there was no known prior link between Mezquia and Zapata. Mezquia never testified in his own defense, and still maintains his innocence. The theory is that he saw Zapata leave the bar and followed her a short distance before he attacked. Her headset covered her ears so she would have been unaware of any danger until he grabbed her and dragged her to his car, where he assaulted her in the back seat. Mezquia was convicted in 2004 and initially sentenced to 37 years, which he appealed. He was then sentenced to 36 years. Mezquia has been in prison since January 2003. Aftermath In the aftermath of Zapata's murder, friends created a self-defense group called Home Alive. Home Alive organized benefit concerts and released albums with the participation of many bands, including Nirvana, Pearl Jam, Soundgarden, Heart, and the Presidents of the United States of America. Joan Jett also recorded an album with the surviving members of the Gits called Evil Stig (\\"Gits Live\\" backwards). The Home Alive group's instructors offered a range of courses, from anger management and use of pepper spray to the martial arts. In 2005 a documentary film, The Gits Movie, was produced about Zapata's life, the Gits, and the Seattle music scene. Its first showing occurred at the Seattle International Film Festival in May of that same year. Another version of the film appeared two years later at the 2007 SXSW (South By Southwest) Film Festival. The final cut was released theatrically in over twenty North American cities on July 7, 2008, the 15th memorial anniversary of Zapata's death. The following day the film was released on DVD along with a Best of the Gits CD (both from Liberation Entertainment). ¬°Viva Zapata!, by punk band 7 Year Bitch, was released in June 1994, on C/Z Records in Seattle, as a tribute to Zapata. Some of the songs on the album address the issue of Zapata's murder directly. Following her death, Jett and Kathleen Hanna wrote a song called \\"Go Home\\" that was later released on Jett's 1994 album, Pure and Simple. Later, a video for \\"Go Home\\" was released which depicts a woman who is being stalked and attacked but is then able to defend herself against the assailant. In February 2013, a play called These Streets, inspired by the stories of and featuring music by Zapata and other female musicians in Seattle, debuted at ACT theatre in Seattle. Zapata's death caused a sense of defeat and fear within the Seattle community. The Seattle Times marked the murder as the moment \\"the Seattle scene lost its sense of invincibility.\\"Nicole Brodeur, \\"What might have been for Zapata,\\" The Seattle Times, March 11, 2004. Cristen Storm recalls Zapata's death as a reality check, stating: \\"[They were] all very tough people and as a group of women, [they] are all really strong, outspoken, and hard-hitting, very opinionated women and that perception of, 'We're not victims at all in any way and this can't happen to women that aren't victims,' and I think [Zapata's death] shattered that myth for us, [and showed] that it happens to all types of women.\\"All Things Considered, NPR, April 17, 1996. Zapata is often cast as a symbol for feminist activism, a martyr, and an angel. Dresdner said \\"[Mia] was sainted, and that was very peculiar... she became this icon for feminism and all kinds of things that she had very little to do with in her actual life.\\" Margaret O'Neil Girouard, who wrote her thesis on Zapata, believes she is an example of women artists being classified based on the perceived motivations behind their art.Girouard, Margaret O.

In that time, it was highly influential for the reconstruction of the history of Roman Britain and contemporary Scotland, to the extent of appearing in Gibbon's Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire and being used to direct William Roy's initial Ordnance Survey maps. Bertram \\"discovered\\" the manuscript around the age of 24 and spent the rest of his life a successful academic and author. Scholars contested various aspects of the Description, but it was not recognized as an unquestionable forgery until 1846. Early life Charles Bertram was born in London in 1723. He was the son of an English silk dyer who was usually accounted to have emigrated to Copenhagen, Denmark, among the retinue of Princess Louisa, a daughter of George II, upon her marriage to Crown Prince Frederick of Denmark in 1743. (The prince became King Frederick V three years later.) Other sources suggest the father immigrated earlier, in 1738. The father established himself as a hosier in 1744, and Charles seems to have benefited from the warm reception that Louisa and her retinue received from the Danes. On 5 July 1747, Charles petitioned the University of Copenhagen's Consortium for admission to study history, antiquities, philosophy, and mathematics. This seems to have been granted, although students were generally required to adhere to the Danish Church and Bertram remained Anglican. He became a friend and prot√©g√© of Hans Gram, the royal librarian and a member of the privy council. On 23 March 1748, Bertram petitioned the king to be permitted to give public lectures on the English language and became a teacher of English in the Royal Marine Academy in Copenhagen. (Some accounts name him as a professor, rather than a tutor; if so, that status would have been granted some years later, as he was a new undergraduate in 1747.) His 1749 chrestomathy An Essay on the Excellency and Style of the English Tongue has been called the initiation of English-language printing in Denmark. A brother apparently died at sea in 1752, and at some point he married Cathrine Marie Gold. The Description of Britain Bertram's \\"facsimile\\" of the work's first page. Bertram's 1755 engraved map. Stukeley's 1757 map, based on a drawing sent by Bertram by early 1750, cleaned up and reoriented to face north. The British section of the genuine Hereford map, . In 1746, Bertram composed a letter to the English antiquarian William Stukeley on Gram's recommendation. He hesitated sending it and Stukeley did not receive it until 11 June 1747. He found it \\"full of compliments, as usual with foreigners\\", and his reply brought a \\"prolix and elaborate Latin epistle\\" from Gram in Bertram's favour. Gram was widely known and respected in English universities. After a few further letters, Bertram mentioned \\"a manuscript in a friend's hands of Richard of Westminster,... a history of Roman Brittain... and an antient map of the island annex'd.\\" He eventually \\"confessed\\" that another Englishman, \\"wild in his youth, had stolen it out of a larger manuscript in an English Library\\", permitting its use to Bertram upon his promise of secrecy. Stukeley was considering retirement but, receiving a new position in London and hearing of Gram's death, he renewed the correspondence and received a \\"copy\\" of its script made by Bertram. David Casley, the keeper of the Cotton Library, \\"immediately\\" described it as around 400 years old. Stukeley thereafter always treated Bertram as reliable. He \\"press'd Mr Bertram to get the manuscript into his hands, if possible... as the greatest treasure we now can boast of in this kind of learning.\\" Bertram refused his attempts to purchase the original manuscript for the British Museum, but Stukeley had received copies of the text piecemeal over a series of letters and had a version of the map by early 1750. Poste notes that the volume appeared in no manuscript catalogues of the era but offered that it could have been stolen at the time of the Cotton Library's fire in 1732. There had been a monk named Richard at Westminster Abbey in the mid-15th century and Bertram suggested this date to Stukeley. Stukeley preferred instead to identify Bertram's \\"Richard of Westminster\\" with Richard of Cirencester, who had lived at Westminster in the late 14th century and was known to have compiled another history. Stukeley made the text and map available at the Arundel Library of the Royal Society. Stukeley examined the text for years before reading his analysis of the work and its itineraries before the Society of Antiquaries in 1756 and publishing its itineraries in 1757. He was excited that the text provided \\"more than a hundred names of cities, roads, people, and the like: which till now were absolutely unknown to us\\" and found it written \\"with great judgment, perspicuity, and conciseness, as by one that was altogether master of his subject\\". His account of the itineraries included a new engraving, reorienting Bertram's map to place north at the top. Later in 1757, at Stukeley's urging, Bertram published the full text in a volume alongside Gildas's Ruin of Britain and the History of the Britons traditionally ascribed to Nennius. Bertram's preface noted that the work \\"contains many fragments of a better time, which would now in vain be sought for elsewhere\\". The preface goes on to note that, \\"considered by Dr. Stukeley... a jewel... worthy to be rescued from destruction\\", Bertram printed it \\"from respect for him\\". This volume's map was the earlier one and Stukeley later employed it for his own ' published posthumously in 1776. The work was studied critically and various aspects of Pseudo-Richard's text were universally rejected, including his claimed province of Vespasiana in lowland Scotland. Gibbon considered Pseudo- Richard to be \\"feeble evidence\\" and Pinkerton tersely noted that, where the two differ, \\"Ptolemy must be right and Richard must be wrong.\\" Nonetheless, the legitimacy of the text itself was unquestioned for decades despite no actual manuscript ever being seen by another person. Instead, Bertram always provided credible reasons why the actual document could not be made available and provided copies to satisfy each new request for information. Later life Stukeley assisted Bertram in joining the Society of Antiquaries in 1756. Bertram was succeeded as the naval academy's English teacher by the Swedish Carl Mannercrantz. The terminology and accent system he employed in his works, despite claims to originality, seem to broadly mimic H√∏ysgaard's and Bertram passed unmentioned by the Danish Biographical Dictionary. His Royal English‚ÄìDanish Grammar was undeserving of its appellation and was published, like all his books, at his own expense; nonetheless, it has been noted as \\"far and away the longest, the most ambitious, and the best\\" such work in its time. The end of its third volume consisted of blurbs and testimonials, including praise from the German Anglicist Theodor Arnold. Bertram died a respected scholar at Copenhagen on 8 January 1765. Legacy The success of the forgery was partially due to the difficulty in finding Bertram's original text, which had a limited printing in Copenhagen. British scholars generally relied on Stukeley's translation, which obscured some of the questionable aspects of the text, until a new volume with the original text and a full translation was published anonymously by Henry Hatcher in 1809. By Hatcher's time, it had become impossible to purchase a copy in London or Copenhagen and his own edition was produced through the loan of William Coxe's copy. Bertram's letters to Stukeley were acquired by John Britton and studied by Joseph Hunter. The inability to find a manuscript in Copenhagen after Bertram's death provoked some questions as to its validity. In 1827, John Hodgson fully rejected the text as spurious on account of its absence from Bertram's papers in Copenhagen, errors in the \\"extract\\"‚Äôs paleography, and the work's highly unusual Latin style. Enough doubts had arisen by 1838 that the English Historical Society declined to include The Description of Britain in its list of important historical works. In 1846, the German scholar Karl Wex conclusively proved at least some passages of the Description were completely spurious. He had been working on a new edition of Tacitus's Agricola and, consulting the Description, he recognized that it included transcription errors which had been introduced to editions of Tacitus by Venetian printers in the late 15th century. His work was translated into English by Poste and printed by the Gentleman's Magazine in October 1846. Many British scholars were slow to accept the truth. Some of the routes mentioned by the work had seemed to have been subsequently borne out and excuses were made for the known errors. Further evidence of the falsity of The Description of Britain came out in the following years, however, until no serious effort could be made in defense of the document. Bertram had on several occasions adopted variant readings and hypotheses unknown before Camden. The final confirmation that the Description was spurious came in the 1860s. Over four articles in 1866 and 1867, B.B. Woodward thoroughly debunked the work and, in 1869, J.E.B. Mayor complimented this by thoroughly comparing the Description with the Historial Mirror written by the real Richard of Cirencester (his only surviving work), which he had been reviewing and editing for the Rolls Series. Blame fell hardest on the reputation of William Stukeley, although it also impugned Gibbon, Roy, and other scholars who had accepted it.

The floor of the library proper within the upper storey lies several feet below the external division between the two storeys, reconciling the demands of use with the harmony of architectural proportion. It is credited as being one of the first libraries to be built with large windows to give comfortable light levels to aid readers. The book stacks are arranged in rows perpendicular to the walls under the intervals between the windows. At the end of each stack is a fine limewood carving by Grinling Gibbons, and above these are plaster cast busts of notable writers through the ages. Other marble busts standing on plinths depict notable members of the college and are mostly carved by Louis-Fran√ßois Roubiliac.

After exploring parts of what is now Missouri, he is remembered for founding the city of St. Charles in 1769. According to Hopewell's Legends of the Missouri and Mississippi: :In the year 1765, a French Canadian, called Blanchette Chasseur, animated by that love of adventure which characterizes all who have lived a roving and restless life, ascended the Missouri, with a few followers, for the purpose of forming a settlement in the then remote wilderness. :He was one of those who encountered perils and endured privations, not from necessity, but from choice; for he had been born to affluence, and had every indulgence consistent with wealth and station, but from a boy had spurned, with Spartan prejudice, every effeminate trait, and had accomplished himself in every hardy and manly exercise. When he had attained his majority, he sailed for America, then the El Dorado of all the visionary, roving and restless spirits of the age. According to Hopewell's rather romantic account, Blanchette met another Frenchman (Bernard Guillet) at the site of St. Charles in 1765. Blanchette, determined to settle at the site, asked if Guillet, who had become the chief of a Dakota tribe, had chosen a name for it. :\\"I called the place 'Les Petites C√¥tes' \\" replied Bernard, \\"from the sides of the hills that you see.\\" :\\"By that name shall it be called,\\" said Blanchette Chasseur, \\"for it is the echo of nature -- beautiful from its simplicity.\\" Hopewell's account is suspect on several details. He appears to have conflated Blanchette's occupation as a hunter (chasseur in French) with a name. Blanchette settled there in 1769 under the authority of the Spanish governor of Upper Louisiana, and served as its civil and military leader until his death in 1793.Don and Dianna Graveman, Legendary Locals of St. Charles, Missouri, Arcadia publishing, Charleston, 2016, p 11 During this time perhaps only a couple dozen buildings were built. Although the settlement was under Spanish jurisdiction, the settlers themselves remained primarily French nationals. He is buried in St. Charles Borromeo cemetery, St. Charles, Missouri.

The 'most famous English pirate of the day', his piracies ranged from Ireland and Guinea to Newfoundland.Clive Malcolm Senior, An Investigation of the Activities and Importance of English Pirates, 1603-40 (University of Bristol, PhD thesis, 1973), p. 88 Clive Senior, A Nation of Pirates: English Piracy in its Heyday (Newton Abbot, 1976), pp. 68-70. He is best known today for his involvement in the early English settlement of Newfoundland, including the settlements at Harbour Grace and Ferryland from 1611 to 1614. One of the most successful of all pirates, he controlled such seapower that no sovereign or state could afford to ignore him, and he was never overtaken or captured by any fleet commissioned to hunt him down. However, he is not as well known as some of the pirates from the late 17th and early 18th centuries. Loyal service Peter Easton, who was also known by Eston, had been a loyal servant of the English Crown. His ancestors had served in the Crusades. The Eastons also distinguished themselves against the Spanish Armada. The Historic Rose Manor based in Harbour Grace, Newfoundland and Labrador, is in close proximity to the fort that once housed Peter and his crew . In 1602, Easton was in command of a convoy as a privateer with a commission from Elizabeth I of England to protect the Newfoundland fishing fleet. During these times, fishing vessels would carry arms and small cannons to protect the valuable cargo of fish from pirates and foreign vessels. Under his commission, he could legally press-gang local fishermen into service for him. He could also attack the ships and wharves of the enemy as much as he wished, especially the much hated Spanish. Easton's flagship was Happy Adventure from which he flew the Saint George's Cross at the masthead. Becoming a pirate On 23 June 1604, when Elizabeth I was succeeded by James I. The king sued for peace with Spain and canceled all letters of commission to privateers. on hearing the news, Easton continued his attack on vessels as though nothing had changed. In so doing, he had crossed the line into piracy. Easton attacked Spanish ships for gold in the West Indies and the Mediterranean Sea, while in the meantime demanding and receiving protection money from English ships. In 1610, he blockaded the Bristol Channel, effectively controlling the shipping entering and leaving the western English ports. For the most part, he was acting on behalf of the powerful family of the Killigrews from Falmouth, Cornwall. They financed his expeditions and also took shares in his profits. Easton arrived in the colony of Newfoundland in 1612 with ten pirate ships and had his headquarters at Harbour Grace. He raided and plundered both English and foreign vessels and the harbours of Newfoundland, press-ganging fishermen into his service along the way. On one expedition, he plundered thirty ships in St. John's and held Sir Richard Whitbourne prisoner, releasing him on the condition that Whitbourne would go to England and obtain a pardon for Easton. The pardon was granted, but by this time, Easton had moved on to the Barbary Coast to harass the Spanish. While in Newfoundland, Easton is estimated to have taken as many as 1,500 fishermen for his ships, most voluntarily. Easton continued to protect John Guy's colony at Cuper's Cove but did not allow him to establish another colony at Renews. On one of his raids, Easton headed for the Azores. Stationing his fleet south and west of the islands, he planned to intercept the Spanish silver fleet. No details of the battle are known except that a few days later, Easton arrived in Tunis loaded with treasure and four Spanish ships in tow. Oderin is an island in Placentia Bay, Newfoundland. It was also a home base for Peter Easton in the 17th century. Oderin is horse-shoe-shaped and its sheltered harbour once accommodated many of Easton's ships. With its high hills, it would have made a perfect hiding place as ships masts would have remained concealed from nearly all approaches to the harbour. The island is reported to have been fortified when seen by Captain Tavener when he surveyed the island in 1713. Many of the older residents of Oderin attest to having seen the remnants of the fortifications well into the 20th century. Retirement to Savoy Early in 1613 the Duke of Savoy issued a proclamation making Nice and Villefranche free ports and offering asylum and safe conducts to all pirates. On 20 February 1613 Easton sailed into Villefranche at the head of four ships and 900 soldiers, leaving eight more vessels outside the Strait of Gibraltar. Easton met with the duke and agreed to invest 100,000 crowns in Savoy, offering to the duke a percentage of the proceeds in return for an annual income.Clive Malcolm Senior, An Investigation of the Activities and Importance of English Pirates, 1603-40 (University of Bristol, PhD thesis, 1973), p. 88-91. William Parkhurst, an English agent in Savoy, wrote of him: \\"This Easton hath since beene with me: hee seemeth to have the age of 40 yeares: his countenance is rude and savadge (which the Duke tooke notice off), his speech and carriage is slow, subtile, and guilty...\\"Clive Malcolm Senior, An Investigation of the Activities and Importance of English Pirates, 1603-40 (University of Bristol, PhD thesis, 1973), p. 390 Easton ingratiated himself with the Duke of Savoy by taking part in a raid on the Duchy of Mantua. Easton was granted a pension of ¬£4000 a year and was sworn to faithful service, becoming a Catholic, marrying an heiress and being created a Marquis of the Duchy of Savoy. Despite this, he remained known at court as 'Il cosaro Inglese' (the English corsair).Clive Malcolm Senior, An Investigation of the Activities and Importance of English Pirates, 1603-40 (University of Bristol, PhD thesis, 1973), p. 88-91 Within a month of Easton's arrival in Savoy he had dismissed most of his company. Although he took part in a Savoyard naval attack on Venice later in 1613, he commanded French crews and ships.Clive Malcolm Senior, An Investigation of the Activities and Importance of English Pirates, 1603-40 (University of Bristol, PhD thesis, 1973), pp. 91-92 The expedition was not successful and after this Easton took little part in maritime affairs. Nevertheless, he remained in the Duke's employ till at least 1620.

The kitchen cutting board is commonly used in preparing food; other types exist for cutting raw materials such as leather or plastic. Kitchen cutting boards are often made of wood or plastic and come in various widths and sizes. There are also cutting boards made of glass, steel, or marble, which are easier to clean than wooden or plastic ones such as nylon or corian, but tend to damage knives due to their hardness. Rough cutting edges‚Äîsuch as serrated knives‚Äîabrade and damage a cutting surface more rapidly than do smooth cutting implements. Materials  A knife edge is a delicate structure and can easily be blunted by too abrasive a surface. Alternatively, it can be chipped if used on a surface that is too hard. A good cutting board material must be soft, easy to clean, and non-abrasive, but not fragile to the point of being destroyed. Hard cutting boards can, however, be used for food preparation tasks that do not require a sharp knife, like cutting cheese or making sandwiches. =Wood= This wooden cutting board shows signs of scoring after repeated use Wood has some advantages over plastic in that it is somewhat self-healing; shallow cuts in the wood will close up on their own. Wood also has natural anti-septic properties. PDF fulltext Hardwoods with tightly grained wood and small pores are best for wooden cutting boards. Good hardness and tight grain help reduce scoring of the cutting surface and absorption of liquid and dirt into the surface. Red oak, even though a hardwood, has large pores which retain dirt even after washing. This makes it a poor choice for cutting-board material. Teak's tight grains and natural coloration make it a highly attractive cutting-board material, both for aesthetic and durability purposes. Teak, a tropical wood, contains tectoquinones, components of natural oily resins that repel moisture, fungi, warping, rot and microbes. Wooden boards can also be refinished with sanding and a reapplication of oil and wax. Wood boards need to be cared for with an edible mineral oil to avoid warping, and should not be left in puddles of liquid. Ideally, they should be suspended freely while drying. Care must be taken when selecting wood, especially tropical hardwood, for use as a cutting board, as some species contain toxins or allergens. Bamboo Bamboo cutting boards are an alternative to plastic or glass cutting boards, partially because bamboo is commonly thought to be naturally antimicrobial (although studies show otherwise ). During the harvesting process, bamboo is carefully chosen for maturation, markings, and size. The stalk is then cut into specific sizes and sent through a pressing process that strips the stalks into smaller plank-like pieces. Once the bamboo is pliable, a cutting board can be produced from multiple pieces by lamination. =Plastic= A plastic cutting board Plastic boards are usually called PE (polyethylene) cutting boards, or HDPE (high-density polyethylene plastic), the material of which these boards are made. There are basically two types of HDPE boards being made. One version is made from injection-molded plastic, while the other is HDPE from an extrusion line. There are several certifications of plastic cutting boards, one being NSF, that certifies the plastic has passed requirements to come in contact with food. Unlike wood, plastic has no inherent antiseptic properties. However, unlike wood, plastic boards do allow rinsing with harsher cleaning chemicals such as bleach and other disinfectants without damage to the board or retention of the chemicals to later contaminate food. Most high-density polyethylene plastic (HDPE) boards are specifically designed not to dull the edge of a knife. If a score line is present, the knife is safe. A serrated knife should not be used on a plastic cutting board. The sharper the knife, the longer the cutting board will last. Semi-disposable thin flexible cutting boards also ease transferring their contents to a cooking or storage vessel. =Silicone= Like rubber, silicone is soft on the blade, while being just as self-healing and anti-bacterial as wood. Silicone is also heat-resistant, and lacks the rubbery smell of rubber boards. =Glass= While glass looks like an easy surface to keep clean, glass cutting boards can damage knives because of the high hardness of the material. Cutting on glass tends to dent, roll or even chip knife edges in a rapid manner. Additionally, if used for chopping instead of slicing, glass can shatter or chip itself, contaminating food. =Steel= Steel shares with glass the advantages of the durability and ease of cleaning, as well as the tendency to damage knives. Depending on the exact steel and heat treatment used, at best a steel cutting board will wear the edge on knives quickly; at worst chip, dent, or roll it like glass. Hygiene Sanitation with cutting boards is a delicate process because bacteria can reside in grooves produced by cutting, or in liquids left on the board. =Preventing cross contamination of food= Bacteria or allergens can easily be transmitted from one part of the kitchen to another or from one food to another via knives, hands, or surfaces such as chopping boards. To reduce the chance of this it is advised to use separate boards for different types of food such as raw meat, cooked meat, dairy and vegetables. Many professional kitchens follow this standard colour-coding system: * Blue cutting boards: raw seafood. * Red cutting boards: raw red meat. * Green cutting boards: vegetables and fruits. * Yellow cutting boards: poultry * Brown cutting boards: cooked meat * White cutting boards: dairy and breads (also for universal if no other board is available.) =Care of boards= Regardless of the material, regular maintenance of a cutting board is important. A very diluted bleach solution is best for disinfecting cutting boards. To remove odors, the board can be rinsed and then rubbed with coarse salt and left to stand for several minutes before being wiped and rinsed clean. In a wooden board, this procedure will also smooth out minor imperfections on the surface. Wooden boards Wooden boards should never be placed in the dishwasher, or left immersed for long periods, as the wood or glue may be affected. To prevent cracking, wood cutting boards should be treated monthly, under normal usage. A standard recommendation is 5‚Äì7 times a year, or as needed. A light food-grade mineral oil is a good preservative for wooden cutting boards, as it helps keep water from seeping into the grain. Alternatively, one may also use a food-grade drying oil such as poppyseed oil, tung oil or linseed oil. The first two dry much faster than linseed. Note, plant based oils will go rancid, and cause wood cutting boards to pick up unpleasant smells. Most commercially available linseed and tung oils are not ‚Äúfood grade‚Äù, as they contain metallic driers. In general, edible savory vegetable or olive oils are not recommended because they tend to go rancid, causing the board to smell and food to pick up the rancid taste. When heavily or deeply scored, wooden boards need to be resurfaced as scoring can harbour bacteria. Boards can be easily resurfaced with various woodworking tools, such as scrapers or planes, even sandpaper. Plastic boards Unlike wood, most plastic boards are non-porous, which means that bacteria can't enter below the surface. It is still equally as important to clean the boards thoroughly after each use as bacteria can lie and grow in any imperfections on the surface. Although many boards are dishwasher safe, both domestic and professional boards which are HDPE will be warped by the hot water, making them unsafe. When heavily or deeply scored, boards need to be resurfaced as scoring can harbour mildew and bacteria. However, resurfacing a plastic cutting board is quite difficult and replacing it is recommended instead. = Bacterial contamination = One 1994 study found that wood was more likely to retain bacterial contamination, while another 1994 study found the opposite. In 2002, another study found that pine wood in particular had antibacterial properties, while two other types of wood did not reduce bacteria relative to plastic. While pine has been found to have antibacterial properties, it is not typically used as a cutting board because it is a \\"softwood\\". In 2005, a study found that oak was followed by pine in antibacterial properties. Oak is also not a common cutting board material due to its relatively large pore size. Another study in 2012 found that bamboo had high antimicrobial activity compared to other woods. In 2016, a literature review summarizing wood and microbial safety was published.

The 'dot' (period or full stop) before the file name makes it a hidden file in Unix-based environments. A site could have more than one \`.htaccess\` file, and the files are placed inside the web tree (i.e. inside directories and their sub-directories), and hence their other name distributed configuration files.Apache HTTP Server Tutorial: .htaccess files - Guide at Apache.org. \`.htaccess\` files act as a subset of the server's global configuration file (like \`httpd.conf\`) for the directory that they are in, or all sub-directories. The original purpose of \`.htaccess\`‚Äîreflected in its name‚Äîwas to allow per-directory access control by, for example, requiring a password to access World Wide Web content. More commonly, however, the \`.htaccess\` files define or override many other configuration settings such as content type, character set, Common Gateway Interface handlers, etc. Format and language \`.htaccess\` files are written in the Apache Directives variant of the Perl Compatible Regular Expressions (PCRE) language. Learning basic PCRE itself can help in mastering work with these files. For historical reasons, the format of \`.htaccess\` files is a limited subset of the Apache HTTP server's global configuration file \`httpd.conf\` even when used with web servers such as Oracle iPlanet Web Server\\"Using the .htaccess file\\", Oracle.com and Zeus Web Server which have very different native global configuration files. Common usage ; Authorization, authentication: A .htaccess file is often used to specify security restrictions for a directory, hence the filename \\"\`access\`\\". The \`.htaccess\` file is often accompanied by a \`.htpasswd\` file which stores valid usernames and their passwords. ; URL rewriting: Servers often use \`.htaccess\` for rewriting long, overly comprehensive URLs to shorter and more memorable ones. ; Blocking (access control): Use allow/deny to block users by IP address or domain. Also used to block bad bots, rippers and referrers. Often used to restrict access by web crawlers. ; SSI: Enable server-side includes. ; Directory listing: Control how the server will react when no specific web page is specified. ; Customized error responses: Changing the page that is shown when a server-side error occurs, for example HTTP 404 Not Found or, to indicate to a search engine that a page has moved, HTTP 301 Moved Permanently. ; MIME types: Instruct the server how to treat different varying file types. ; Cache control: \`.htaccess\` files allow a server to control caching by web browsers and proxies to speed up websites, reduce bandwidth usage, server load, and perceived lag. \`.htaccess\` also adds the cache age to the webpage resources so that on revisiting the page, the elements are reloaded from browser cache till the age mentioned expires, instead of requesting the resource again from the server. ; HTTPS & HSTS: Implementation of both HTTPS and HSTS on Apache servers is largely dependent on correct URL rewriting & header information mentioned in \`.htaccess\` file. Any incorrect syntax in the file while deploying HTTPS or HSTS leads to a failure in implementation. Advantages ; Immediate changes: Because \`.htaccess\` files are read on every request, changes made in these files take immediate effect ‚Äì as opposed to the main configuration file which requires the server to be restarted for the new settings to take effect. ; Non-privileged users: For servers with multiple users, such as on shared web hosting, it is often desirable to allow individual users the ability to alter their site configuration. The use of \`.htaccess\` files allows such individualization, and by unprivileged users ‚Äì because the main server configuration files do not need to be changed. Disadvantages Controlling Apache using the main server configuration file \`httpd.conf\` is often preferred for security and performance reasons: ; Performance loss: For each HTTP request, there are additional file-system accesses for parent directories when using \`.htaccess\`, to check for possibly existing \`.htaccess\` files in those parent directories which are allowed to hold \`.htaccess\` files. It is possible to programatically migrate directives from \`.htaccess\` to \`httpd.conf\` if this performance loss is a concern. ; Security: Allowing individual users to modify the configuration of a server can cause security concerns if not set up properly. ; Syntax: \`.htaccess\` is usually very sensitive to syntax errors. Due to this any misspellings may lead to 501 server errors and web resources in the directory with the erroneous \`.htaccess\` not being displayed at all.

Retrieved on 2008-06-05 =Since World War II= Though most people meet their dates at social organizations, in their daily life and work, or are introduced through friends or relatives, commercial dating agencies emerged strongly, but discreetly, in the Western world after World War II, mostly catering for the 25-44 age group. Newspaper and magazine personal ads also became common. Since the emergence of the Internet, mate-finding and courtship have seen changes due to online dating services and mobile dating services. Telecommunications and computer technologies have developed rapidly since around 1995, allowing daters the use of home telephones with answering machines - mobile phones - and web-based systems to find prospective partners. \\"Pre-dates\\" can take place by telephone or online via instant messaging, e-mail, or even video communication. Many singles look for love on the Web, and research in the United Kingdom suggests that as of 2004 there were around 150 agencies in that country, where the market was apparently growing at around 20 percent a year. Academic researchers find it impossible to find precise figures about crucial statistics, such as the ratio of active daters to the large number of inactive members (whom an agency will often wrongly claim as potential partners, leaving them 'on the books' long after they have left) and the overall ratio of men to women in an agency's membership. Academic research on traditional pre-Internet agencies suggests that most such agencies had far more men than women in their membership. Due to the ratio of available single women being biased against men in the Western world, many dating and marriage agencies began to offer services over-seas. Traditionally, in many societies (including Western societies), men were expected to fill the role of the pursuer. However, the anonymity of the Internet (as well as other factors) has allowed women to take on that role online. The trend of singles making a Web connection continues to increase, as the percentage of North American singles who have tried Internet dating has grown from two percent in 1999 to over ten percent today (from Canadian Business, February 2002). More than half of online consumers (53%) know someone who has started a friendship or relationship online, and three-quarters of 18-to-24-year-old online consumers (74%) say they do. There is also some academic evidence that the 18-25 age group has significantly taken up online dating. Fraud Users of online agencies or sites may be susceptible to fraud or other forms of deception. According to the FBI, almost 15,000 complaints categorized as romance scams were reported in 2016.

He was highly famed in the 18th and 19th century as the author of The Description of Britain before it was proved to have been a later forgery in 1846. Life His name (as Circestre) first appears on the chamberlain's list of the monks of that foundation drawn up in the year 1355. In 1391, he obtained a licence from the abbot to go to Rome and in this the abbot gave his testimony to Richard's perfect and sincere observance of religion for upwards of thirty years. In 1400 Richard spent nine nights of the infirmary of the abbey, and likely died that January. His only known extant work are the four books of the Historial Mirror of the Deeds of the Kings of England (), covering the years from 447 to 1066. The manuscript of this is in the university library at Cambridge and was edited in two volumes for the Rolls Series by John Mayor. At the conclusion of the fourth book Richard expresses his intention of continuing his narrative from the accession of William I, and incorporating a sketch of the Conqueror's career from his birth. This design he does not, however, appear to have carried into effect. The value of the Historial Mirror as a contribution to our historical knowledge is but slight, for it is mainly a compilation from other writers and even in transcribing these the compiler is guilty of great carelessness. He gives, however, numerous charters relating to Westminster Abbey and also a very complete account of the saints whose tombs were in the abbey church, especially concerning Edward the Confessor. The work was, however, largely used by historians and antiquaries until, with the rise of a more critical spirit, its value became more accurately estimated. Besides the Historial Mirror Richard also wrote, according to a 1396 letter from William of Woodford to Archbishop Thomas of Canterbury, a treatise on the offices (') and there was formerly in the cathedral library at Peterborough another tract ascribed to him entitled Super Symbolum. Of neither of these works, however, does any known copy now exist. Richard of Westminster Richard is best known for the historical forgery perpetrated by Charles Bertram known as The Description of Britain (). Bertram's original manuscript ascribed this to \\"Richard the Westminsterian monk\\" ('), but a British academic looking to verify its authenticity discovered that Richard of Cirencester had been at Westminster around the time of the work's supposed composition. It was then published under a variant of his name (') and the conflation was universally accepted, to the point where Richard's name is more associated with the discredited forgery than with his own works.

It is one way to stochastically generate new solutions from an existing population, and analogous to the crossover that happens during sexual reproduction in biology. Solutions can also be generated by cloning an existing solution, which is analogous to asexual reproduction. Newly generated solutions are typically mutated before being added to the population. Different algorithms in evolutionary computation may use different data structures to store genetic information, and each genetic representation can be recombined with different crossover operators. Typical data structures that can be recombined with crossover are bit arrays, vectors of real numbers, or trees. Examples Traditional genetic algorithms store genetic information in a chromosome represented by a bit array. Crossover methods for bit arrays are popular and an illustrative example of genetic recombination. =Single-point crossover= A point on both parents' chromosomes is picked randomly, and designated a 'crossover point'. Bits to the right of that point are swapped between the two parent chromosomes. This results in two offspring, each carrying some genetic information from both parents. File:OnePointCrossover.svg =Two-point and k-point crossover= In two-point crossover, two crossover points are picked randomly from the parent chromosomes. The bits in between the two points are swapped between the parent organisms. TwoPointCrossover.svg Two-point crossover is equivalent to performing two single-point crossovers with different crossover points. This strategy can be generalized to k-point crossover for any positive integer k, picking k crossover points. = Uniform crossover= In uniform crossover, typically, each bit is chosen from either parent with equal probability. Other mixing ratios are sometimes used, resulting in offspring which inherit more genetic information from one parent than the other. = Crossover for ordered lists = In some genetic algorithms, not all possible chromosomes represent valid solutions. In some cases, it is possible to use specialized crossover and mutation operators that are designed to avoid violating the constraints of the problem. For example, a genetic algorithm solving the travelling salesman problem may use an ordered list of cities to represent a solution path. Such a chromosome only represents a valid solution if the list contains all the cities that the salesman must visit. Using the above crossovers will often result in chromosomes that violate that constraint. Genetic algorithms optimizing the ordering of a given list thus require different crossover operators that will avoid generating invalid solutions. Many such crossovers have been published:Pedro Larra√±aga et al., \\"Learning Bayesian Network Structures by searching for the best ordering with genetic algorithms\\", IEEE Transactions on systems, man and cybernetics, Vol 26, No. 4, 1996 # partially mapped crossover (PMX) # cycle crossover (CX) # order crossover operator (OX1) # order-based crossover operator (OX2) # position-based crossover operator (POS) # voting recombination crossover operator (VR) # alternating-position crossover operator (AP) # sequential constructive crossover operator (SCX) Other possible methods include the edge recombination operator. Alternatively, to overcome the mentioned issue, double chromosomes can be used.

Tanfield was to establish a colony at Renews and left England in 1623 with an unknown number of colonists. The settlers were harassed by migratory fishermen who used the harbour. He was the leader of the colony of South Falkland from 1623 to 1625. The colony was still in existence in 1626 when it was visited by Sir Richard Whitbourne but the settlers likely returned to England shortly afterwards. By 1630, Tanfield was back in England about to embark to Ireland on a mission for King Charles I. The most probable identification of Tanfield is that he was the son of Clement Tanfield and his wife, Anne, of Gayton, Northamptonshire, born 1565. He was knighted in July 1603 and, in September, accompanied the new ambassador, Lord Spencer, to the court of the Duke of W√ºrttemberg, Frederick I, who was duke over what is now part of Germany.

The college traces its founding to 1742 by Moravians, descendants of followers of the Bohemian Reformation (John Amos Comenius), and claims to be the sixth- oldest college in the United States.Moravian College History The most popular majors are health sciences, business, nursing, sociology, psychology, and biological sciences.Moravian College ‚Äì Overview, U.S. News History Moravian College claims to be the sixth-oldest college in the United States and the first to educate women, as well as Native Americans in their own language. The college traces its roots to the Bethlehem Female Seminary, which was founded in 1742, as the first boarding school for young women in the U.S. The seminary was created by Benigna, Countess von Zinzendorf, the daughter of Count Nikolaus Ludwig Zinzendorf, who was the benefactor of the fledgling Moravian communities in Nazareth and Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. The Female Seminary was incorporated by the Pennsylvania State Legislature in 1863 and became the women's college, the Moravian Seminary and College for Women in 1913.College History Moravian College The college also traces its roots to the founding of two boys' schools, established in 1742 and 1743, which merged to become Nazareth Hall in 1759. Located in the town of Nazareth, Nazareth Hall became, in part, Moravian College and Theological Seminary in 1807. It was later incorporated by the Pennsylvania State Legislature as Moravian College and Theological Seminary in 1863 as a baccalaureate-granting institution. Beginning in 1858 and continuing to 1892, the seminary and college relocated from Nazareth to a former boys‚Äô school on Church Street in Bethlehem, located on the present site of the Bethlehem City Hall. The men's Moravian College and Theological Seminary then settled in the north end of the city (the present- day North Campus) as a result of a donation from the Bethlehem Congregation of the Moravian Church in 1888. The first buildings constructed at North Campus, Comenius Hall and Zinzendorf Hall, were completed in 1892 and joined the property's original brick farmhouse to form the new campus. The farmhouse was later named Hamilton Hall, which still stands today. In 1954, the two schools combined to form the single, coeducational, modern institution of Moravian College. The merger of the two institutions combined the North Campus (the location of the men's college from 1892‚Äì1954) and the South Campus (the location of the women's college) into a single collegiate campus. The distance between the North and South campuses is about 0.8 miles of Main Street, called the \\"Moravian Mile\\". First-year students traditionally walk the Moravian Mile as part of their orientation activities.Freshmen to Walk the Moravian Mile on August 27 Moravian College, August 16, 2005 =Colonial-era college= Although the college is one of the oldest educational institutions in the United States, it is not considered one of the nine original Colonial Colleges, but rather a colonial-era foundation. Moravian College and Theological Seminary, as well as the Bethlehem Female Seminary, did not start granting baccalaureate degrees until 1863. Academics Gate of the South Campus from Main Street Moravian College currently enrolls about 1,700 full- time undergraduate students in a wide variety of majors, all of which are presented in the liberal arts tradition. The seminary enrolls over 100 full- time students in its graduate divinity programs. During most semesters, at least 14 denominations are represented in the seminary student body. Faith communities most often represented among the seminary's students include: Moravian, Lutheran, UCC, Episcopal, United Methodist, Presbyterian, Baptist, Roman Catholic, Quaker, Mennonite, Unitarian Universalist, African Methodist Episcopal, Assembly of God, Brethren, Reformed, and nondenominational. The college's varied and highly regarded music programs grow from the Moravian Church's musical traditions. Moravian College's student news site is The Comenian, which is published online throughout the school year.The Comenian ‚Äì Moravian College's Student Newspaper Every year, the student body elects representatives to the United Student Government. USG has a legislature, composed of 16 senators from the undergraduate body, an executive, including an elected president and vice president, appointed cabinet and staff, and a judiciary, composed of appointed justices. USG was officially recognized in 1968. A somewhat unusual facet of college governance is the existence of two elected student members of Moravian College's Board of Trustees; both are full, voting members and serve two-year terms. Moravian College awards these undergraduate and graduate degrees: Bachelor of Music, Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Science, Master of Business Administration, Master of Education, Master of Human Resource Management, and six Master of Science programs in nursing; the seminary grants Master of Divinity, Master of Arts in Pastoral Counseling, and Master of Arts in Theological Studies degrees. The college also has evening undergraduate programs for adults seeking continuing undergraduate education and graduate degrees. The seminary has accreditation from the Association of Theological Schools in the United States and Canada.Accreditation Moravian Theological Seminary Because Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, and Tondabayashi, Japan, have been sister cities for over half a century, Moravian College and Osaka Ohtani University (Â§ßÈò™Â§ßË∞∑Â§ßÂ≠¶) also established a partnership.„É¢„É©„Éì„Ç¢„É≥ÊïôËÇ≤Á†î‰øÆ„Äë„ÅÆÂèÇÂä†ÂãüÈõÜÈñãÂßãÊó•Á®ã„Å´„Å§„ÅÑ„Å¶ Osaka Ohtani University, 2009 Each spring, several Japanese students come to Moravian for two weeks to take a class about the American education system. These students are hosted by Moravian students and enjoy trips to New York City and Philadelphia. During May and June 2010, the first two Moravian students studied at Osaka Ohtani University. Additionally, the college is a member of the Lehigh Valley Association of Independent Colleges; members include Muhlenberg College, Lafayette College, Lehigh University, Cedar Crest College, and DeSales University; students from each institution can take classes in each other member institution and can take courses in programs offered at other institutions not offered at Moravian, such as architecture. The college's Student Opportunities for Academic Research (SOAR) program provides stipends, travel allowances, and expenses for students engaged in research or creative activities through close interaction with a faculty mentor. The program helps Moravian students gain a better understanding of scholarship in their discipline, and fosters scholar-colleague relationships. SOAR stipends can be as high as $3,000 for summer work. Established in 1960, the college's honors program provides qualified seniors the opportunity to pursue a yearlong intensive study of a subject of special interest. Campus The college's programs are offered at four locations, known as the Main Street Campus (North Campus), the Priscilla Payne Hurd Campus (South Campus), the Steel Field Complex, and the Sports Medicine and Rehabilitation Center. =Priscilla Payne Hurd Campus= Art and music programs are offered in Bethlehem's historic district on the college's Priscilla Payne Hurd Campus. Many of the buildings on that campus were built during the colonial period, including the Brethren's House, built in 1748, which served as a hospital during the Revolutionary War, and currently houses the Music Department. Also located on Priscilla Payne Campus are the President's House, Main Hall (1854), the Widow's House, Clewell Hall, West Hall, South Hall, the 1867 Chapel, Clewell Dining Hall, and the Central Moravian Church. A number of the buildings are connected. The facilities have been renovated to include Payne Gallery (renovated from the original women's gymnasium ‚Äì 1903), the College's two-level art gallery that offers several shows each year, and Foy Concert Hall. Also located on the Priscilla Payne Hurd Campus are Peter Hall, a medium-sized colonial style recital hall, Hearst Hall, a small colonial style recital hall, and individual student rehearsal rooms and art studios. The College presents the nationally- renowned Christmas Vespers services in the Central Moravian Church, located on the corner of Main and Church streets across from Brethren's House. Many of the buildings on the Priscilla Payne Hurd Campus are located in a National Register of Historic Places District and Church Street has been referred to as one of the most historic streets in America. In the 2009‚Äì2010 school year, Moravian College added a new living complex on the Priscilla Payne Hurd Campus called the HILL. Each floor has suites, where four to 16 people can live. The complex has classrooms, a cafe, a fitness room, a mail room, and common rooms. The HILL is air conditioned and fully handicap accessible. The suites contain a living room, full kitchen, private bathroom, and additional hallway sinks. A shuttle service is provided for easy transportation between the North and South campuses. =Main Street Campus= Initially given in 1888 and settled in 1892, the North Campus is also known as the Main Street campus, as it is physically larger and is the site of the majority of the college's buildings, academic departments, administration, and student residences. The main building of the Main Street Campus is Comenius Hall, which was built in 1892 and is named for John Amos Comenius, the last bishop of Unity of the Brethren, known as the \\"father of modern education\\" for his revolutionary educational principles. Comenius wrote in 1632, \\"not the children of the rich or of the powerful only, but of all alike, boys and girls, both noble and ignoble, rich and poor, in all cities and towns, villages and hamlets, should be sent to school\\". The Moravians had considered schools secondary in importance only to churches. A statue of Comenius, which was a gift to the college from Charles University of Prague and the Moravian Church of Czechoslovakia, stands in front of Comenius Hall. The Main Street Campus is also the location of Reeves Library, Priscilla Payne Hurd Academic Complex, Colonial Hall, the Bahnson Center, the Moravian Archives, Zinzendorf Hall, Borhek Chapel, Prosser Auditorium (capacity 300), Monacacy Hall, Collier Hall of Science, Hamilton Hall, Memorial Hall, Johnston Hall (capacity 1,600 for athletics, 3,000 for events), the Timothy M. Breidegam Athletic and Recreation Center, the Collier Hall of Science, the Haupert Union Building, the Arena Theatre, and most of the college's student housing, including dorms, townhouses, and apartments. In 2016, John Makuvek Field was installed and opened behind the Haupert Union Building. John Makuvek Field is a synthetic-turf field that is home to the Greyhounds' field hockey, men's and women's lacrosse, and men's and women's soccer teams. The field is named for John Makuvek, who retired in 1996 after four years as athletics director, and in 2010 after 43 years as head golf coach. The field is located at the center of campus, with views from the residential halls, Reeves Library, and the portico of the Haupert Union Building. In 2017, the Sally Breidegam Miksiewicz Center for Health Sciences was opened at 1107 Main Street. The facility is a 55,000 ft2 facility hosting classes for both undergraduate and graduate programs, including nursing, informatics, and the health sciences and features the region's only virtual cadaver lab. The building is named in honor of former Moravian College trustee Sally Breidegam Miksiewicz. Also located on the Main Street Campus is the Betty Prince field hockey field. =Steel Field Complex= Most of the College's athletic fields are located at this complex, including the football stadium with a grandstand capacity of 2,400 and Sportexe turf field, eight- lane Mondo Super X Performance synthetic track, the softball field, the Gillespie baseball field, the Hoffman tennis courts, the football practice fields, and a fieldhouse. Steel Field and its brick grandstand were originally built by Bethlehem Steel to host the Bethlehem Steel Football Club, 1913-1930. In 1925, Lehigh University purchased Steel Field from Bethlehem Steel.Willard Ross Yates Lehigh University: a history of education in engineering, business, and the human condition Lehigh University Press, 1992, p. 145 The Bethlehem Steel Soccer Club continued to use the field until its demise. In 1962, Lehigh sold the facility to Moravian College.Willard Ross Yates Lehigh University: a history of education in engineering, business, and the human condition Lehigh University Press, 1992, p. 218 =Sports Medicine and Rehabilitation Center= In 2016, the Sports Medicine and Rehabilitation Center opened at 1441 Schoenersville Road, across from Betty Prince Field. The 43,000+ ft2 building is the home of the college‚Äôs Master of Science in Athletic Training program, Doctor of Athletic Training (DAT), as well as the future Master of Science in Occupational Therapy, Master of Science in Speech-Language Pathology, and Doctor of Physical Therapy programs ‚Äî positioning Moravian College as one of just three liberal arts colleges in the country to house these programs under one roof. About 10,000 square feet of the building are designated for St. Luke‚Äôs University Health Network. The facility includes six research labs, student collaboration areas, a distance- learning classroom, and 14 faculty offices.

In commission from 1949 until 1956, she saw active service in the Korean War, and was sold to Portugal in 1961 to serve as NRP Dom Francisco de Almeida until 1970. Construction The ship was originally ordered from William Pickersgill & Sons Ltd. of Southwick, Sunderland, on 19 January 1943 as the Loch Heilen. However, the contract was then changed, and the ship was laid down on 30 April 1944 to a revised design as a Bay class. Admiralty Job No. J4802 (Yard No. 266) was launched as Morecambe Bay on 1 November 1944. Work on the ship was suspended in August 1945 after the cessation of hostilities, and she ship was laid up at the builder's yard. Finally, in 1948, the ship was towed to the shipyard of J. Samuel White at Cowes, where she was completed. Service history =Malaya= Morecambe Bay was commissioned on 22 February 1949 under the command of Lieutenant-Commander K.R.S Leadley. However, post-war demobilisation meant that there was a shortage of personnel, and it was not until July that she had her full complement. In August she was assigned to Far East service under the command of Commander C.C.B. Mackenzie, and sailed for Malta in September. She exercised with Mediterranean Fleet ships in October, before sailing to Singapore, arriving on 21 November to join the 4th Frigate Flotilla in patrols and anti-insurgent operations on the coast of Malaya during the Malayan Emergency. =Korea= On the outbreak of the Korean War in June 1950 Morecambe Bay was nominated for service with the United Nations Naval Task Force based at Sasebo, Japan. She was deployed in October for bombardment and patrol duties off the west coast of Korea with other Commonwealth ships, including sister ship , and the New Zealand frigates and . In November she was deployed with Task Group 95.13 in minesweeping operations off the west coast, and in December was deployed in support of evacuation of Inchon with CTG 95.12, while under the command of Commander J.J.E. Famol. In January 1951 she left Korean waters and rejoined the flotilla at Hong Kong for Yangtze Patrol and flotilla exercises. In June Morecambe Bay began her second operational tour off Korea, supporting raids by Korean troops in the Haeju and Chojin area. In July she was attached to United States Navy Task Group 95.12 to assist in bombardments off the east coast of Korea in support of military operations, receiving a congratulatory signal from the Commander of the U.S. 7th Fleet Vice Admiral Harold M. Martin. She was then transferred to the Royal Navy Task Group on the west coast, and employed in operations off the Han River with the frigates and Mounts Bay in support of military operations to ensure access to Seoul, and in shore bombardments. Relieved from UN duties Morecambe Bay rejoined the flotilla in September for further anti-insurgent patrol duties, then refitted at Singapore in December. In January 1952 she carried out patrols of the Malacca Strait and supported of anti-insurgent operations. In February she sailed to Sasebo for her third operational UN tour, deployed with CTG 95.22 in the Sonjin and Chojin areas off the east coast. In March she was transferred to RN Task Group for service on west coast for patrol duties and gunfire support, returning to Hong Kong in May. In July Commander J.A.H. Hamer took command, and she sailed in August to Sasebo for her fourth Korean tour. In September she was deployed off the west coast for island patrols and support, then off the East coast in October, and returned to Hong Kong in November. Morecambe Bay returned to Korea in May 1953, and while operating off Ch'o do Island off the west coast of North Korea with a US Navy Landing Ship, came under enemy fire, while counter-fire was provided by the battleship . In June she provided a guard for the rededication of War Grave cemetery at Kobe in Japan. In August her tour in Korea ended and she sailed to Hong Kong to refit. After exercises, she was deployed as guardship at Pangyong Do from 31 October, and carried out patrol and gunfire support duties. On 9 December she was relieved by the destroyer and took passage to Kure, then to Hong Kong for fleet exercises. In January 1954 she was deployed in operations and patrols off Malaya, taking part in fleet exercises in February, before sailing to Hong Kong for maintenance, and a new CO, Commander A.C. Tupper. In April she patrolled the Pearl River, and the Formosa Strait, returning to Korea at the end of May for patrol and guardship duties, before returning to Singapore for a major refit in July, during which the crew were temporarily transferred to HMS Terror ‚Äì the naval barracks at Singapore Naval Base. =West Indies= In September, after a shakedown cruise off Singapore, Morecambe Bay sailed for the Caribbean to join the West Indies Squadron, calling at Yokosuka, Pearl Harbor, San Francisco, San Diego, Acapulco, Puerto San Jos√©, Guatemala, and Balboa, Panama, before transiting the Panama Canal on 20 December, arriving at Kingston, Jamaica three days later. In January 1955 she joined the cruisers and the Canadian Quebec, the frigates and , and other NATO warships for exercises, then returned to the UK, arriving back at Portsmouth on 2 February. After an extensive refit she was put back in commission on 31 July for service on America and West Indies Station under the command of Commander T.C. Meyrick. After trials and weapons calibration she sailed for Bermuda, arriving on 30 September. In October and November she visited various Caribbean island ports, then in December she took part in joint exercises with the cruiser and ships of the United States. The year 1956 was spent in an extensive series of visits to ports in Central America, and of the United States, as well as a major multi-national exercise in June with USN, RN, Canadian and Dutch ships. Finally, in September, Morecambe Bay returned to the UK, was decommissioned on 19 November 1956, and was laid up in Reserve at Portsmouth. Later she was transferred to Barrow and placed on the Disposal List. =Sold to Portugal= On 9 May 1961 the frigate was sold to Portugal and renamed Dom Francisco de Almeida. After a refit by John I. Thornycroft & Company at Woolston, Southampton, she was handed over to the Portuguese Navy on 3 August 1961. She served until scrapped in September 1970.

In commission from 1949 until 1960, she saw active service in the Korean War, and was sold to Portugal in 1961 to serve as NRP Vasco da Gama until 1971. Construction The ship was originally ordered from William Pickersgill & Sons Ltd. of South Bank, Middlesbrough, on 25 January 1943 as the Loch Kilburnie. However, in late 1943 the contract was changed, and the ship was laid down on 23 October 1944 to a revised design as a Bay class. She was launched as Mounts Bay on 8 June 1945, but work on the ship was then suspended. Finally, on 20 March 1946, the ship was transferred to the shipyard of John I. Thornycroft & Company at Woolston, Southampton where she was completed on 11 April 1949. Service history Mounts Bay was commissioned for service, and after sea trials and training she sailed to the Far East to join the 4th Frigate Flotilla. From 1950 to 1953 she was part of the United Nations Task Force based at Sasebo, Japan, with other Commonwealth warships in support of military operations in Korean waters, spending routine maintenance and rest periods at Kure, Japan. She was also deployed for Squadron duties, including patrols to protect British merchant ships trading between ports in China and the South China Sea. When not deployed off Korea she carried out patrols off Malayan coast in support of British anti-insurgent operations, and took part in Squadron and Fleet exercises and visits to ports in the Far East. After the Korean War armistice was signed on 27 July 1953, the UN Task Force operations continued, and Mounts Bay was deployed as a guardship into 1954. In September of that year she returned to the UK to refit and then served in the West Indies in 1955, in the South Atlantic in 1957, and then returned to Far East. Decommissioning and disposal In May 1960 the ship was decommissioned and put into Reserve at Portsmouth. Placed on the Disposal List in 1961 she was sold to Portugal. She was modernized by John I Thornycroft in Southampton, before being commissioned by the Portuguese Navy on 3 August 1961.

Launched in 1911, the ship was funded by the government of New Zealand as a gift to Britain, and she was commissioned into the Royal Navy in 1912. She had been intended for the China Station, but was released by the New Zealand government at the request of the Admiralty for service in British waters. During 1913, New Zealand was sent on a ten-month tour of the British Dominions, with an emphasis on a visit to her namesake nation. She was back in British waters at the start of the First World War, and operated as part of the Royal Navy's Grand Fleet, in opposition to the German High Seas Fleet. During the war, the battlecruiser participated in all three of the major North Sea battles‚ÄîHeligoland Bight, Dogger Bank, and Jutland‚Äîand was involved in the response to the inconclusive Raid on Scarborough, and the Second Battle of Heligoland Bight. New Zealand contributed to the destruction of two cruisers during her wartime service and was hit by enemy fire only once, sustaining no casualties; her status as a \\"lucky ship\\" was attributed by the crew to a MƒÅori piupiu (warrior's skirt) and hei-tiki (pendant) worn by the captain during battle. After the war, New Zealand was sent on a second world tour, this time to allow Admiral John Jellicoe to review the naval defences of the Dominions. In 1920, the battlecruiser was placed in reserve. She was broken up for scrap in 1922 in order to meet Britain's tonnage limit in the disarmament provisions of the Washington Naval Treaty. Design The Indefatigable class was not a significant improvement on the preceding ; the main difference was the enlargement of the dimensions to give the ships' two wing turrets a wider arc of fire. The ships were smaller and not as well protected as the contemporary German battlecruiser and subsequent German designs. While Von der Tanns characteristics were not known when the lead ship of the class, , was laid down in February 1909, the Royal Navy obtained accurate information on the German ship before work began on New Zealand and her sister ship .Roberts, pp. 28‚Äì29 Starboard elevation and deck plan as depicted in Brassey's Naval Annual, 1915. Note: plan is of Invincible-class battlecruisers; the Indefatigable- class had a third superstructure element with 'P' & 'Q' turrets more widely spaced. New Zealand had an overall length of , a beam of , and a draught of at deep load. The ship displaced at load and at deep load.Roberts, pp. 43‚Äì44 She had a crew of 800 officers and ratings. The ship was powered by two sets of Parsons direct-drive steam turbines, each driving two propeller shafts, using steam provided by 31 coal-burning Babcock & Wilcox boilers. The turbines were rated at and were intended to give the ship a maximum speed of . However, during trials in 1912, the turbines produced over , which allowed New Zealand to reach .Roberts, pp. 76, 80 The ship carried enough coal and fuel oil to give her a range of at a speed of .Burt, p. 91 famous dolphin‚Äîin the muzzle of a 12-inch gun (1914) The ship carried eight BL 12-inch Mk X guns in four twin gun turrets. Two turrets were mounted fore and aft on the centreline, identified as 'A' and 'X' respectively. The other two were wing turrets mounted amidships and staggered diagonally: 'P' was forward and to port of the centre funnel, while 'Q' was situated starboard and aft. Each wing turret had a limited ability to fire to the opposite side, but if the ship was full broadside to her target she could bring all eight main guns to bear. Her secondary armament consisted of sixteen 4-inch BL Mk VII guns positioned in the superstructure.Roberts, pp. 81‚Äì84 She mounted two 18-inch submerged torpedo tubes, one on each side aft of 'X' barbette, and twelve torpedoes were carried.Campbell (1978), p. 14 The Indefatigables were protected by a waterline armoured belt that extended between and covered the end barbettes. Their armoured deck ranged in thickness between with the thickest portions protecting the steering gear in the stern. The turret faces were thick, and the turrets were supported by barbettes of the same thickness.Roberts, p. 112 New Zealands 'A' turret was fitted with a rangefinder at the rear of the turret roof. It was also equipped to control the entire main armament in the event that the normal fire control positions were knocked out or communication between the primary positions and the gun layers was disabled.Roberts, pp. 90‚Äì91 =Wartime modifications= The ship was fitted with a single QF 6 pounder Hotchkiss anti-aircraft (AA) gun from October 1914 to the end of 1915.Roberts, p. 83 In March 1915, a single QF 3 inch 20 cwt\\"cwt\\" is the abbreviation for hundredweight, 20 cwt referring to the weight of the gun. AA gun was added. It was provided with 500 rounds. The battlecruiser's 4-inch guns were enclosed in casemates and given blast shields during a refit in November to better protect the gun crews from weather and enemy action. Two aft guns were removed at the same time.Campbell (1978), p. 13 New Zealand received a fire-control director sometime between mid-1915 and May 1916; this centralised fire control under the director officer, who now fired the guns. The turret crewmen merely had to follow pointers transmitted from the director to align their guns on the target. This greatly increased accuracy, as it was easier to spot the fall of shells and eliminated the problem of the ship's roll dispersing the shells when each turret fired independently.Roberts, pp. 92‚Äì93 An additional inch of armour was added to the top of the magazines and turret roofs after the Battle of Jutland.Roberts, p. 113 By 1918, New Zealand carried two aircraft, a Sopwith Pup and a Sopwith 1¬Ω Strutter, on flying-off ramps fitted on top of 'P' and 'Q' turrets. The Pup was intended to shoot down Zeppelins while the 1¬Ω Strutter was used for spotting and reconnaissance.Layman, pp. 114‚Äì115 Each platform had a canvas hangar to protect the aircraft during inclement weather.Roberts, p. 92 Acquisition and construction New Zealands bell; this bell had previously been used on the battleship of the same name At the start of the 20th century, the British Admiralty maintained that naval defence of the British Empire, including the Dominions, should be unified under the Royal Navy.Frame, p. 71 Attitudes on this matter softened during the first decade, and at the 1909 Imperial Conference, the Admiralty proposed the creation of Fleet Units: forces consisting of a battlecruiser, three light cruisers, six destroyers, and three submarines.Lambert, p. 64 While Australia and Canada were encouraged to purchase fleet units to serve as the core of new national navies, other fleet units would be operated by the Royal Navy at distant bases, particularly in the Far East; New Zealand was asked to partially subsidise a fleet unit for the China Station.Lambert, pp. 64‚Äì65 To this end, the Prime Minister of New Zealand, Sir Joseph Ward, announced on 22 March 1909 that his country would fund a battleship (later changed to an ) as an example to other countries.Lambert, pp. 64‚Äì67 It is unclear why this design was selected, given that it was known to be inferior to the battlecruisers entering service with the Imperial German Navy (). Historian John Roberts has suggested that the request may have been attributable to the Royal Navy's practice of using small battleships and large cruisers as flagships of stations far from Britain, or it might have reflected the preferences of the First Sea Lord and Admiral of the Fleet John Fisher, preferences not widely shared.Roberts, pp. 29‚Äì31 The New Zealand Government took out a loan to fund the cost of the ship. New Zealands keel was laid at Fairfield Shipbuilding and Engineering's yard on the Clyde on 20 June 1910. Launched on 1 July 1911, the battlecruiser was commissioned into the Royal Navy four days before she was completed on 23 November 1912.Burt, p. 103 Service history =First World War= New Zealand was sent on a ten-month flag-waving tour of New Zealand via South Africa in 1913. During this tour, the ship was seen by an estimated half- million New Zealanders‚Äîalmost half the population‚Äîand her captain was presented with a MƒÅori piupiu\\"Maori Chiefs Visit Warship\\", 18 April 1913, Evening Post\\"An historic piupiu\\" , TeAra (a warrior's skirt made from rolled flax) and a greenstone hei-tiki (pendant), which were intended to ward off evil. The Admiralty requested that New Zealand return to the United Kingdom when the tour concluded, rather than remain in the Pacific region as originally planned. The New Zealand Government acceded to the request and, upon her arrival on 8 December 1913, New Zealand joined the 1st Battlecruiser Squadron (1st BCS) of the Grand Fleet. The squadron visited Brest in February 1914, and Riga, Reval and Kronstadt in the Russian Empire the following June. On 19 August 1914, shortly after the First World War began, New Zealand was transferred to the 2nd Battlecruiser Squadron (2nd BCS). Battle of Heligoland Bight alt= New Zealands first wartime action was the Battle of Heligoland Bight on 28 August 1914, as part of the battlecruiser force under the command of Admiral David Beatty. Beatty's ships were originally intended to provide distant support for the British cruisers and destroyers closer to the German coast, in case large units of the High Seas Fleet sortied in response to the British attacks once the tide rose. When the British light forces failed to disengage on schedule at 11:35,The times used in this section are in UT, which is one hour behind CET, which is often used in German works. the battlecruisers, led by Beatty aboard his flagship, , began to head south at full speed to reinforce the smaller British ships; the rising tide meant that German capital ships would be able to clear the sandbar at the mouth of the Jade estuary.Tarrant, p. 24 The brand-new light cruiser had been crippled earlier in the battle and was under fire from the German light cruisers and when Beatty's battlecruisers loomed out of the mist at 12:37. By this time, New Zealand had fallen behind the three newer and faster battlecruisers and was not in position to significantly participate in the battle. Strassburg was able to evade fire by hiding in the mists, but C√∂ln remained visible and was quickly crippled by the British squadron. Before the German ship could be sunk, Beatty was distracted by the sudden appearance of the elderly light cruiser off his starboard bow. He turned to pursue, but Ariadne was set afire after only three salvos fired from under . At 13:10, Beatty turned north and made a general signal to retire. Shortly after turning north, the battlecruisers encountered the crippled C√∂ln, which was sunk by two salvos from Lion.Massie, pp. 109‚Äì113 During the battle, New Zealands captain, Lionel Halsey, wore the MƒÅori piupiu over his uniform, setting a tradition followed for the duration of the war. Two days after the battle, New Zealand was transferred back to the 1st BCS, when the battlecruiser arrived from the Mediterranean. Raid on Scarborough The German Navy had decided on a strategy of bombarding British towns on the North Sea coast in an attempt to draw out the Royal Navy and destroy elements of it in detail. An earlier raid on Yarmouth on 3 November 1914 had been partially successful, but a larger- scale operation was later devised by Admiral Franz von Hipper. The fast battlecruisers would conduct the bombardment, while the rest of the High Seas Fleet stationed itself east of Dogger Bank, so they could cover the battlecruisers' return and destroy any pursuing British vessels. Having broken the German naval codes, the British were planning to catch the raiding force on its return journey, although they were not aware of the High Seas Fleet's presence. Admiral Beatty's 1st BCS (now reduced to four ships, including New Zealand) and the 2nd Battle Squadron (consisting of six dreadnoughts) were detached from the Grand Fleet in an attempt to intercept the Germans near Dogger Bank.Massie, pp. 333‚Äì334 Admiral Hipper's raiders set sail on 15 December 1914, and successfully bombarded several English towns; British destroyers escorting the 1st BCS had already encountered German destroyers of the High Seas Fleet at 05:15 and fought an inconclusive action with them. Vice Admiral Sir George Warrender, commanding the 2nd Battle Squadron, had received a signal at 05:40 that the destroyer was engaging enemy destroyers, although Beatty had not. The destroyer spotted the German armoured cruiser and her escorts at about 07:00, but could not transmit the message until 07:25. Admiral Warrender received the signal, as did New Zealand, but Beatty, aboard Lion, did not, even though New Zealand had been specifically tasked to relay messages between the destroyers and the flagship. Warrender attempted to pass on Shark's message to Beatty at 07:36, but did not manage to make contact until 07:55. On receiving the message, Beatty reversed course, and dispatched New Zealand to search for Roon. She was being overhauled by New Zealand when Beatty received messages that Scarborough was being shelled at 09:00. Beatty ordered New Zealand to rejoin the squadron and turned west for Scarborough.Massie, pp. 342‚Äì343 Relative positions of the British and German forces at about 12:00 hours The British forces, heading west to cover the main route through the minefields protecting the coast of England, split up while passing the shallow Southwest Patch of Dogger Bank; Beatty's ships headed to the north, while Warrender passed to the south. This left a gap between them, through which the German light forces began to move. At 12:25, the light cruisers of the II Scouting Group began to pass the British forces searching for Hipper. The light cruiser spotted the light cruiser and signalled a report to Beatty. At 12:30, Beatty turned his battlecruisers toward the German ships, which he presumed were the advance screen for Hipper's ships. However, those were some behind. The 2nd Light Cruiser Squadron, which had been screening for Beatty's ships, detached to pursue the German cruisers, but a misinterpreted signal from the British battlecruisers sent them back to their screening positions. This confusion allowed the German light cruisers to escape, and alerted Hipper to the location of the British battlecruisers. The German battlecruisers wheeled to the north-east of the British forces and also made good their escape.Tarrant, p. 31 New Zealand became flagship of the 2nd BCS of the Grand Fleet on 15 January 1915, and saw action the following week in the Battle of Dogger Bank. Battle of Dogger Bank On 23 January 1915, a force of German battlecruisers under the command of Admiral Hipper sortied to clear Dogger Bank of any British fishing boats or small craft that might be there to collect intelligence on German movements. Alerted by decoded German transmissions, a larger force of British battlecruisers, including New Zealand, sailed under the command of Admiral Beatty to intercept. Contact was initiated at 07:20. on the 24th, when Arethusa spotted the German light cruiser . By 07:35, the Germans had spotted Beatty's force and Hipper ordered a turn south at , believing that this speed would outdistance any British battleships to the north-west; he planned to increase speed to the armoured cruiser s maximum of if necessary to outrun any battlecruisers.Massie, pp. 376‚Äì384 Beatty ordered his battlecruisers to make all practical speed to catch the Germans before they could escape. New Zealand and Indomitable were the slowest of Beatty's ships, and gradually fell behind the newer battlecruisers. Despite this, New Zealand was able to open fire on Bl√ºcher by 09:35, and continued to engage the armoured cruiser after the other British battlecruisers had switched targets to the German battlecruisers. After about an hour, New Zealand had knocked out Bl√ºchers forward turret, and Indomitable began to fire on her as well at 10:31. Two 12-inch shells pierced the German ship's armoured deck and exploded in an ammunition room four minutes later. This started a fire amidships that destroyed her two port turrets, while the concussion damaged her engines so that her speed dropped to , and jammed her steering gear. At 10:48, Beatty ordered Indomitable to attack her, but the combination of a signalling error by Beatty's flag lieutenant and heavy damage to Beatty's flagship Lion, which had knocked out her radio and caused enough smoke to obscure her signal halyards, caused the rest of the British battlecruisers, temporarily under the command of Rear Admiral Sir Gordon Moore in New Zealand, to think that that signal applied to them. In response, they turned away from Hipper's main body and engaged Bl√ºcher.Massie, pp. 385‚Äì406 New Zealand fired 147 shells at Bl√ºcher before the German ship capsized and sank at 12:07 after being torpedoed by Arethusa.Gardiner and Gray, p. 27 Captain Halsey had again worn the piupiu over his uniform during the battle, and the lack of damage to New Zealand was once more attributed to its good luck properties. New Zealand was relieved by Australia as flagship of the 2nd BCS on 22 February 1915. The squadron joined the Grand Fleet in a sortie on 29 March, in response to intelligence that the German fleet was leaving port as the precursor to a major operation. By the next night, the German ships had withdrawn, and the squadron returned to Rosyth. On 11 April, the British fleet was again deployed on the intelligence that a German force was planning an operation. The Germans intended to lay mines at the Swarte Bank, but after a scouting Zeppelin located a British light cruiser squadron, they began to prepare for what they thought was a British attack. Heavy fog and the need to refuel caused Australia and the British vessels to return to port on 17 April, and although they were redeployed that night, they were unable to stop two German light cruisers from laying the minefield. From 26 to 28 January 1916, the 2nd BCS was positioned off the Skagerrak while the 1st Light Cruiser Squadron swept the strait in an unsuccessful search for a possible minelayer.Jose, pp. 269‚Äì271 On the morning of 21 April 1916, the 2nd BCS sailed again for the Skagerrak, this time to support efforts to disrupt the transport of Swedish ore to Germany. The planned destroyer sweep of the Kattegat was cancelled when word came that the High Seas Fleet was mobilising for an operation of their own (later learned to be timed to coincide with the Irish Easter Rising), and the British ships were ordered to a rendezvous point in the middle of the North Sea, while the rest of the Grand Fleet made for the south-eastern end of the Long Forties. On the afternoon of 22 April, the Battlecruiser Fleet was patrolling to the north-west of Horn Reefs when heavy fog came down. The ships were zigzagging to avoid submarine attack when Australia collided with sister ship New Zealand twice in three minutes.Jose, pp. 272‚Äì274 Australia was damaged badly enough to be put out of action for several months, but New Zealand returned to the fleet on 30 May, a day before the start of the Battle of Jutland, relieving Indefatigable as flagship.Roberts, p. 123 Battle of Jutland Assembled officers of HMS New Zealand together with Winston Churchill and King George V On 31 May 1916, the 2nd BCS consisted of New Zealand (flagship of Rear Admiral William Christopher Pakenham) and Indefatigable; Australia was still under repair following her collision with New Zealand.Burt, p. 104 The squadron was assigned to Admiral Beatty's Battlecruiser Fleet, which had put to sea to intercept a sortie by the High Seas Fleet into the North Sea. The British were able to decode the German radio messages and left their bases before the Germans put to sea. Hipper's battlecruisers spotted the Battlecruiser Fleet to their west at 15:20, but Beatty's ships didn't spot the Germans to their east until 15:30. Two minutes later, he ordered a course change to east-south-east to position himself astride the German's line of retreat and called his ships' crews to action stations. He also ordered the 2nd BCS, which had been leading, to fall in astern of the 1st BCS. Hipper ordered his ships to turn to starboard, away from the British, to assume a south-easterly course, and reduced speed to to allow three light cruisers of the 2nd Scouting Group to catch up. With this turn, Hipper was falling back on the High Seas Fleet, then about behind him. Around this time, Beatty altered course to the east as it was quickly apparent that he was still too far north to cut off Hipper.Tarrant, pp. 69, 71, 75 Thus began the so-called \\"Run to the South\\" as Beatty changed course to steer east-south-east at 15:45, paralleling Hipper's course, now that the range closed to under . The Germans opened fire first at 15:48, followed by the British. The British ships were still in the process of making their turn, and only the two leading ships, Lion and , had steadied on their course when the Germans opened fire. The British formation was echeloned to the right with Indefatigable in the rear and the furthest to the west, and New Zealand ahead of her and slightly further east. The German fire was accurate from the beginning, but the British overestimated the range as the German ships blended into the haze. Indefatigable aimed at Von der Tann, while New Zealand, unengaged herself, targeted . By 15:54, the range was down to and Beatty ordered a course change two points to starboard to open up the range at 15:57. Indefatigable was destroyed at about 16:03, when her magazines exploded.Tarrant, pp. 80‚Äì85 After Indefatigables loss, New Zealand shifted her fire to Von der Tann in accordance with Beatty's standing instructions. The range had grown too far for accurate shooting, so Beatty altered course four points to port to close the range again between 16:12 and 16:15. By this time, the 5th Battle Squadron, consisting of four s, had closed up and was engaging Von der Tann and Moltke. At 16:23, a shell from struck near Von der Tanns rear turret, starting a fire among the practice targets stowed there that completely obscured the ship and caused New Zealand to shift fire to Moltke.Tarrant, pp. 89‚Äì90 At 16:26, the ship was hit by a shell, fired by Von der Tann, on 'X' barbette that detonated on contact and knocked loose a piece of armour that briefly jammed 'X' turret and blew a hole in the upper deck.Campbell (1998), pp. 48, 76 Four minutes later, Southampton, scouting in front of Beatty's ships, spotted the lead elements of the High Seas Fleet charging north at top speed. Three minutes later, she sighted the topmasts of Vice-Admiral Reinhard Scheer's battleships, but did not transmit a message to Beatty for another five minutes. Beatty continued south for another two minutes to confirm the sighting himself before ordering a sixteen-point turn to starboard in succession. New Zealand, the last ship in the line, turned prematurely to stay outside the range of the oncoming battleships.Massie, pp. 595‚Äì600 A chunk of armour knocked from New Zealands 'X' turret during the Battle of Jutland on display at the Torpedo Bay Navy Museum in Auckland New Zealand was straddled several times by the battleship but was not hit.Tarrant, p. 100 Beatty's ships maintained full speed in an attempt to increase the distance between them and the High Seas Fleet, and gradually moved out of range. They turned north and then north-east to try to rendezvous with the main body of the Grand Fleet. At 17:40, they opened fire again on the German battlecruisers. The setting sun blinded the German gunners, and as they could not make out the British ships, they turned away to the north-east at 5:47.Tarrant, p. 109 Beatty gradually turned more towards the east to allow him to cover the deployment of the Grand Fleet in battle formation and to move ahead of it, but he mistimed his manoeuvre and forced the leading division to fall off towards the east, further away from the Germans. By 18:35, Beatty was following Indomitable and Inflexible of the 3rd BCS as they were steering east-south-east, leading the Grand Fleet, and continuing to engage Hipper's battlecruisers to their south-west. A few minutes earlier, Scheer had ordered a simultaneous 180¬∞ starboard turn and Beatty lost sight of the High Seas Fleet in the haze.Tarrant, pp. 130‚Äì138 Twenty minutes later, Scheer ordered another 180¬∞ turn which put them on a converging course again with the British, which had altered course to the south. This allowed the Grand Fleet to cross Scheer's T, forming a battle line that cut across his battle line and badly damaging his leading ships. Scheer ordered yet another 180¬∞ turn at 19:13 in an attempt to extricate the High Seas Fleet from the trap into which he had sent them.Tarrant, pp. 149, 157 This was successful, and the British lost sight of the Germans until 8:05, when spotted smoke bearing west-north- west. Ten minutes later, she had closed the range enough to identify German torpedo boats, and engaged them. Beatty turned west upon hearing gunfire and spotted the German battlecruisers only away. Inflexible opened fire at 20:20, followed by the rest of Beatty's battlecruisers.Tarrant, p. 175 New Zealand and Indomitable concentrated their fire on , and hit her five times before she turned west to disengage.Campbell (1998), p. 272 Shortly after 20:30, the pre- dreadnought battleships of Rear Admiral Mauve's II Battle Squadron were spotted and fire switched to them. The Germans had poor visibility and were able to fire only a few rounds at them before turning away to the west. The British battlecruisers hit the German ships several times before they blended into the haze around 8:40.Tarrant, pp. 177‚Äì178 After this, Beatty changed course to south-south-east and maintained that course, ahead of both the Grand Fleet and the High Seas Fleet, until 02:55 the next morning, when the order was given to reverse course and head home.Tarrant, pp. 178, 224 New Zealand fired 420 twelve-inch shells during the battle, more than any other ship on either side. Despite this, only four successful hits were credited to the battlecruiser: three on Seydlitz and one on the pre-dreadnought .Campbell (1978), p. 18 She was hit only once during the battle, confirming for the crew the piupiu and tiki worn by her new captain, J.F.E. (Jimmy) Green, brought good luck. Post-Jutland career New Zealand was relieved by Australia as flagship on 9 June and temporarily attached to the 1st Battlecruiser Squadron, until relieved her in September.Parkes, p. 517 On the evening of 18 August, the Grand Fleet put to sea in response to a message deciphered by Room 40 that indicated that the High Seas Fleet, minus II Squadron, would be leaving harbour that night. The German objective was to bombard Sunderland on 19 August, based on extensive reconnaissance provided by airships and submarines. The Grand Fleet sailed with 29 dreadnought battleships and six battlecruisers. Throughout the next day, Jellicoe and Scheer received conflicting intelligence; after reaching the location in the North Sea where the British expected to encounter the High Seas Fleet, they turned north in the erroneous belief that they had entered a minefield. Scheer turned south again, then steered south-eastward to pursue a lone British battle squadron sighted by an airship, which was in fact the Harwich Force of cruisers and destroyers under Commodore Tyrwhitt. Realising their mistake, the Germans changed course for home. The only contact came in the evening when Tyrwhitt sighted the High Seas Fleet but was unable to achieve an advantageous attack position before dark, and broke off contact. The British and the German fleets returned home; the British lost two cruisers to submarine attacks, and one German dreadnought had been torpedoed.Marder, pp. 287‚Äì296 New Zealand underwent a refit at Rosyth in November 1916. She temporarily replaced Australia as squadron flagship between 29 November and 7 January 1917. German minesweepers and escorting light cruisers were attempting to clear British- laid minefields in the Heligoland Bight in late 1917. The Admiralty planned a large operation for 17 November to destroy the ships, and allocated two light cruiser squadrons and the 1st Cruiser Squadron covered by the reinforced 1st Battlecruiser Squadron and, more distantly, the 1st Battle Squadron of battleships. New Zealand was attached to the 1st BCS for this operation, which became known as the Second Battle of Heligoland Bight. New Zealand did not fire her guns during the battle.Newbolt, pp. 164‚Äì65 As in previous engagements, Captain Green wore the piupiu and tiki for luck. During 1918, New Zealand and the Grand Fleet's other capital ships were used on occasion to escort convoys between Britain and Norway. The 2nd BCS spent the period from 8 to 21 February covering these convoys in company with battleships and destroyers, and put to sea on 6 March in company with the 1st BCS to support minelayers. The 2nd BCS again supported minelayers in the North Sea from 25 June or 26 June to the end of July. During September and October, New Zealand and the 2nd BCS supervised and protected minelaying operations north of Orkney.Jose, pp. 279, 282, 303 The battlecruiser was present at the surrender of the High Seas Fleet as part of the 2nd BCS. =Post-war= Following the war, Admiral Jellicoe was tasked with helping to plan and coordinate the naval policies and defences of the British Dominions. New Zealand was made available for his transportation, and was refitted between December 1918 and February 1919 for the tour; the main changes were the removal of her flying-off platforms and the lower forward four-inch guns.Gordon, pp. 11‚Äì12Burt, p. 102 The first stop was India, with New Zealand arriving in Bombay on 14 March 1919 and departing six weeks later. The battlecruiser arrived at Albany, Western Australia, on 15 May, where Jellicoe and his staff disembarked to take an overland route across the country. New Zealand sailed via Melbourne and Hobart to depart from Sydney for New Zealand on 16 August.Gordon, pp. 14, 18, 21 New Zealand dry-docked at Cockatoo Island Dockyard in Sydney during Admiral Jellicoe's tour of the Dominions The ship called upon Christmas Island (Kiritimati), southeast of Fanning Island, on 19 November 1920, thinking it uninhabited. Instead, they were greeted by Joe English, of Medford, Massachusetts, who had been manager of a copra plantation on the island, but had become marooned with two others, when the war had broken out. The men were rescued.Bailey, p48 One of New Zealands 4-inch guns, outside the Auckland Museum The ship was particularly popular in New Zealand, where crowds flocked to visit her as they had done in 1913. Jellicoe, too, was popular and he later returned to New Zealand to serve as Governor-General from 1920 to 1924.Gordon, p. 21 The ship stopped off at Fiji and Hawaii before arriving on 8 November in Canada, the final country to be assessed. After returning to the United Kingdom, the battlecruiser was paid off into reserve on 15 March 1920. New Zealand was regarded as obsolete by the Royal Navy, because her 12-inch guns were inferior to the guns deployed on the latest generation of battlecruisers. She was sold for scrap on 19 December 1922 to meet the tonnage restrictions set on the British Empire by the Washington Naval Treaty. The New Zealand Government completed paying off the loan used to fund the ship in the 1944/45 financial year. Many items from the battlecruiser were sent to New Zealand after she was scrapped. Equipment including several 4-inch guns, a range finder and laundry equipment, were used by military units while other artifacts were placed on display in museums. During the Second World War, the 4-inch guns were the main armament of the land batteries which protected the entrances to the harbours at Auckland, Wellington and Lyttelton.Henderson et al., pp. 312‚Äì313 The captain's piupiu was returned to New Zealand in 2005, and is on display at the Torpedo Bay Navy Museum in Auckland alongside the ship's bell and other artifacts. The Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa in Wellington also holds several items from the ship in its collection.

Named after the Dominion of Newfoundland, she fought in the Second World War and was later sold to the Peruvian Navy. The hospital ship was a different ship, although also torpedoed in the Mediterranean in 1943. Early career Newfoundland was built by Swan Hunter and launched 19 December 1941 by the wife of the then British Minister of Labour, Ernest Bevin. The ship was completed in December 1942 and commissioned the next month. HMS Newfoundland firing her 6-inch guns during target practice, April 1943. Taken from After commissioning Newfoundland joined the 10th Cruiser Squadron, Home Fleet. Early in 1943 the ship became flagship of the 15th Cruiser Squadron, Mediterranean. On the night of 13/14 July 1943, during Sicily Campaign, she provided effective support for 1st Parachute Brigade helping to secure the Primasole Bridge, linking Catania with Syra. On 23 July 1943, she was torpedoed by the Italian submarine Ascianghi. Some sources attribute the torpedo to German submarine .https://uboat.net/allies/merchants/ships/3019.html 1 crewman was killed in the attack. Her rudder having been blown off, temporary repairs were carried out at Malta. Later, steering by her propellers only, and with the assistance of \\"jury rigged\\" sails between her funnels, she steamed to the Boston Navy Yard for major repairs. In 1944 the ship was re-commissioned for service in the Far East. While at Alexandria an exploding air vessel occurred in one of the torpedoes in the port tubes which caused severe damage and one casualty. The repairs delayed her arrival in the Far East for service with the British Pacific Fleet (BPF). Newfoundland went to New Guinea to support the Australian 6th Division in the Aitape-Wewak campaign. On 14 June 1945, as part of a BPF task group, Newfoundland attacked the Japanese naval base at Truk, in the Caroline Islands during Operation Inmate. On 6 July Newfoundland left the forward base of Manus in the Admiralty Islands with other ships of the BPF to take part in the Allied campaign against the Japanese home islands. On 9 August she took part in a bombardment of the Japanese city of Kamaishi. Newfoundland was part of a British Empire force which took control of the naval base at Yokosuka. The ship was present in Tokyo Bay when the Instrument of Surrender was signed aboard the US battleship , on 2 September 1945. Newfoundland was then assigned the task of repatriating British Empire prisoners of war. She returned to Great Britain in December 1946. Postwar Newfoundland was initially in reserve, and was used as a training ship as part of the stokers' training establishment , before starting a 20-month reconstruction at Plymouth in 1951. Recommissioned on 5 November 1952, she became flagship of the 4th Cruiser Squadron in the East Indies. The cabinet of Sri Lanka met on board her during the Hartal of 1953.Colvin R de Silva, Hartal From December 1953 Newfoundland underwent a three-month refit at Singapore before transferring to the Far East Station, shelling Malayan National Liberation Army targets near Penang in June 1954 when on passage to the Far East. On 31 October 1956, the was cruising South of the Suez Canal in the Red Sea, when Newfoundland encountered her and ordered her to heave to. Aware of tensions between Britain and Egypt that would lead to the Suez Crisis, Domiat refused and opened fire on the cruiser, causing some damage and casualties. The cruiser, with the destroyer , then returned fire and sank her opponent, rescuing 69 survivors from the wreckage. One man from the Newfoundland was killed and five were wounded.The War at Sea Newfoundland then returned to the Far East until paid off to the reserve at Portsmouth on 24 June 1959. She was sold to the Peruvian Navy on 2 November 1959, and subsequently renamed Almirante Grau and then to Capit√°n Qui√±ones in 1973. The cruiser was hulked in 1979 and used as a static training ship in Callao, before being decommissioned and scrapped later that year.

Prior to his retirement in 2007, he spent seven years as the director of the Center for Theological Inquiry at Princeton Theological Seminary. He was the co-founder of the Center for Catholic and Evangelical Theology and is known for his two-volume Systematic Theology published between 1997 and 1999. Student years Jenson was born on August 2, 1930, in Eau Claire, Wisconsin. He studied classics and philosophy at Luther College in the late 1940s, before beginning theological studies at Luther Seminary in 1951. Due to a car accident he missed most of his first-year seminary studies, and during that year he immersed himself in the works of Immanuel Kant and S√∏ren Kierkegaard. Jenson began reading historical-critical scholars like Hermann Gunkel and Sigmund Mowinckel, and as a result he became deeply interested in the biblical texts and in the theological significance of the Old Testament. At Luther Seminary, Jenson was assistant to the renowned orthodox Lutheran theologian, Herman Preus. Preus infused Jenson with an admiration for the theology of post-Reformation Lutheran scholasticism, and with a strong belief in the orthodox Lutheran understanding of predestination. Against the majority of the staff at Luther Seminary at that time, who believed that God elected individuals to salvation on the basis of \\"foreseen faith\\", Preus held that God had decreed the salvation of a definite number of the elect, without a decree of reprobation. Other influences at Luther Seminary included Edmund Smits, who introduced Jenson to the work of Augustine of Hippo, and fellow student Gerhard Forde, who introduced him to the work of Rudolf Bultmann. While studying at seminary, Jenson also met and married Blanche Rockne, who became one of the major stimuli for his theological work (one of his later books includes a dedication to Blanche, \\"the mother of all my theology\\"). After seminary, Jenson taught in the department of religion and philosophy at Luther College from 1955 to 1957, before moving to Heidelberg for doctoral studies in 1957‚Äì1958. Though he had planned to write his dissertation on Bultmann, his supervisor, , advised him to work on Karl Barth's doctrine of election. Thus Jenson worked on Barth's theology at Heidelberg, and he also studied nineteenth-century German theology and philosophy, partly with the help of the new Heidelberg lecturer, Wolfhart Pannenberg. He also attended a seminar there with Martin Heidegger (and, during a later visit to Heidelberg, with Hans- Georg Gadamer). Even more significantly, at Heidelberg he became friends with another young Lutheran scholar, Carl Braaten, who would later become his \\"chief theological companion\\" and his most important theological collaborator. Early career Jenson's doctoral dissertation (revised and published in 1963 as Alpha and Omega) was completed in Basel, with Barth's approval, and so Jenson returned to Luther College, where he continued to study Barth while also developing an increasing interest in the philosophy of G. W. F. Hegel. The faculty of the religion department was uncomfortable with Jenson's theological liberalism, and his openness to biblical criticism and evolutionary biology was strongly condemned. When the college failed to force Jenson's retirement, several professors from the religion and biology departments resigned in protest. From 1960 to 1966, Jenson was thus left with the task of helping to rebuild an entire religion department, and he became especially involved in the development of a new philosophy department. During these years, he also wrote A Religion Against Itself (1967), which sharply critiqued the American religious culture of the 1960s. Jenson finally left Luther College to spend three years as Dean and Tutor of Lutheran Studies at Mansfield College, Oxford University. Here he was able to focus for the first time on teaching theology, and he was deeply influenced by his encounters with Anglicanism and with ecumenical worship. The three years at Oxford marked a creative and productive period in Jenson's career. In The Knowledge of Things Hoped For (1969), he sought to integrate the traditions of European hermeneutics and English analytical philosophy, while also drawing on patristic and medieval theologians such as Origen and Thomas Aquinas. And in God after God (1969), he sought to go beyond the \\"death of God\\" theology by emphasizing the actualism and futurity of God's being. The proposal advanced in God after God was in many respects parallel to the new \\"theology of hope\\" that was being developed at the time in Germany by young scholars like J√ºrgen Moltmann and Wolfhart Pannenberg. At Oxford, Jenson also supervised the doctoral work of Colin Gunton, who went on to become one of Great Britain's most distinguished and influential systematic theologians. From Oxford, Jenson returned to America in 1968 and took up a position at the Lutheran Seminary in Gettysburg. His work here focused in part on distinctively Lutheran themes, especially in the books Lutheranism (1976) and Visible Words (1978). He also began to engage deeply with patristic thought (especially with Gregory of Nyssa, Cyril of Alexandria, and Maximus the Confessor), which led him to develop a creative new proposal for trinitarian theology in The Triune Identity (1982). Further, as a result of his encounter with Anglicanism at Oxford, Jenson was appointed to the first round of Lutheran‚ÄìEpiscopal ecumenical dialogue in 1968. This was the beginning of his long involvement with the ecumenical movement, which would deeply shape his later theology. With George Lindbeck, he became involved in the Roman Catholic‚ÄìLutheran dialogue; and in 1988, he spent time at the Institute for Ecumenical Research at Strasbourg. Throughout his career, Jenson's theology continued to move in an increasingly Catholic, conservative and ecumenical direction. He interacted extensively with the work of Catholic theologians like Joseph Ratzinger (Pope Benedict XVI) and Hans Urs von Balthasar and with Eastern Orthodox theologians like Maximus the Confessor, John Zizioulas, and Vladimir Lossky. Later career After two decades of teaching at Lutheran Theological Seminary in Gettysburg, Jenson moved in 1988 to the religion department of St. Olaf College in Northfield, Minnesota. He was joined in Northfield by his friend Carl Braaten, and together they founded the conservative Center for Catholic and Evangelical Theology in 1991. The founding of this center marked a new period of intensive ecumenical involvement for Jenson: with Braaten, he organized numerous ecumenical conferences and began publishing the theological journal Pro Ecclesia, where he remained a senior editor until his death. Jenson continued to teach at St. Olaf College until 1998, when he retired and took up a position as Senior Scholar for Research at the Center for Theological Inquiry in Princeton, New Jersey. Before leaving St. Olaf College, he completed work on his magnum opus, the two-volume Systematic Theology (1997‚Äì1999), which has since been widely regarded as one of the most important and creative recent works of systematic theology. In a review of this work, Wolfhart Pannenberg described Jenson as \\"one of the most original and knowledgeable theologians of our time\\". Jenson died in his home in Princeton on September 5, 2017.
