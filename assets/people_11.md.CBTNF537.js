The platform serves as a bridge to products and sellers on Taobao and Tmall, with information updated in real-time and translated to English. Product organization, customer service, payment, and delivery are geared towards non-Chinese users. The platform is accessible online as well through the company's official WeChat service account. The platform organizes products into departments and subcategories, and features positively reviewed and trending products throughout the website and blog articles. Baopals currently operates out of the Jing'an District of Shanghai, with an office dog named Doge who was pictured in an article from China Daily about the benefits of having pets in the workplace. In October 2017, Baopals was the first foreign team to receive honors and win the “Top 10 Up-and-Coming Entrepreneurs in Shanghai” award — one of the longest running startup contests in the city held by the Shanghai Human Resources and Social Security Bureau. In a 2018 interview with CNBC, Baopals reported that over 2 million items had been sold on the platform, with a gross merchandise value of over US$14 million. History Baopals was founded in Shanghai, China. After seven months of development, the platform opened to beta users in February 2016. In an interview with China Daily, Charles Erickson said: > The idea was born out of necessity from all of us. I was always asking my > Chinese colleagues to help me buy things on Taobao. So, we just wanted to > figure out a way to do this independently. On the company's tech platform, Jay Thornhill said: > [People may] think that we’re hand selecting products from Taobao and Tmall, > but our tech actually bridges everything over from Taobao and Tmall > automatically, in real time. So all the products and sellers are there. In 2017, Baopals was the winner of the OTEC International Startup Competition and Shanghai Innovation and Startup Competition. According to a profile on Baopals from China Daily, approximately 25 percent of Baopals customers are based in Shanghai, 20 percent in Beijing, 13 percent in Guangdong, and the rest flow from other parts of China. Recognition After launching in February 2016, Baopals was featured by local media in Shanghai. That's Shanghai wrote: \\"Worry no more, because Baopals was tailor-made for you. Is it Taobao translated into English? Well, yes, but you could just as easily do that on your browser. What Baopals does instead is reconfigure the interface, making it sleek and approachable, and compartmentalizing all that miscellanea into 16 categories. Game status: changed.\\" In April, City Weekend (Shanghai) published a piece on Baopals, saying, \\"At long, long last: shopping start-up Baopals has cracked the world of Taobao and Tmall wide open for the expat community. Translating the treasure trove of these products into English would have been enough, but the company also offers phenomenally easy delivery and payment options that reflect the gradually opening Chinese market in which us expats participate on a daily basis. Unlike existing concierge services that act more as middlemen, the Baopals team wanted to provide a more independent shopping experience.\\" In the following months Baopals received national attention in an article from the Global Times in an article about young foreign entrepreneurs in China, and was featured on the front page of Tech Crunch media partner TechNode, who wrote: \\"While a handful of expat entrepreneurs try to bring innovation from their country to China, this startup builds on the success of one of China’s largest companies and adapts it to expat tastes.\\" An article published in March 2017 by City Weekend (Beijing) referred to the platform as \\"...a solution for those of us illiterate in Chinese.\\" A photo essay published in August by China Daily quoted Charles Erickson as saying, \\"When you return to the west, you realize that opportunities are still in China\\". In August 2017, 海豚视频 (Dolphin Video) published a comedic video filmed at the Baopals office and co-founder's home outlining the history of the company and some of the crazier products available for purchase of the platform. Within the first 12 hours of publication the video received over 1 million views, peaking at 1.95 million two days later. Two more short videos were produced by Pear Video at the end of 2017, documenting and interviewing the Baopals cofounders as they attended an awards ceremony, worked in the office, exercised at the gym, and ate at a Chinese restaurant. Comedy series Mamahuhu featured a Baopals employee in a 2019 video titled \\"Average Day of a Chinese Office Worker in Shanghai.\\" The video team followed Li Yi Xuan and her daily routine, with a look inside the Baopals headquarters on the day following the Singles' Day sale.

The soup is made of rich beef stock, spiced with a mixture of spices. The spices includes garlic, shallot, candlenut, coriander, caraway, ginger, galangal, lime leaf, lemongrass, nutmeg and cinnamon. Garnishing include chopped scallion and bawang goreng (crispy fried shallot). Origin Sop saudara was created by Haji Dollahi, he worked for Haji Subair, a famous Coto Makassar traditional meat soup seller in Makassar circa 1950s. Both men hailed from a town in Pangkajene Islands Regency (Pangkajene Kepulauan or Pangkep) and made their business in selling traditional meat soup. After three years working for Haji Subair, Haji Dollahi decided to establish his own business in 1957. His first stall was located in Karebosi area, Makassar. The name \\"sop saudara\\" which means \\"brotherly soup\\" was inspired from the name coto paraikatte (the name of warung that sells Coto Makassar). In Makassar dialect, paraikatte means \\"relative\\", \\"fellow\\" or \\"kin\\", thus Haji Dollahi wished the soup will promote a brotherly sentiment with his customers.

It is a product which is protected under the GI registration and is made throughout the Indian state of Manipur. It was originally a product of Moirang village. Geographical indication The fabric has been registered for protection under the Geographical indication of the Trade Related Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS) agreement. It was registered as Moirang Phee under the Geographical Indications Act 1999 of the Government of India, with registration confirmed by the Controller General of Patents Designs and Trademarks under Class – 25 – Clothing vide application number 373 dated 19 December 2011, and also for Wangkhei Phee (GI no.372) and Shaphee Lanphee (GI no.371). The Government of Manipur was expected to register 1,000 weavers in respect of Moirang Phee within six months from the date of registration as per decision of the Consultative Committee meeting. History Moirang village where the Moirang Phee was initially made is a historical location in the Bishnupur District. Mythologically the village is linked to the mythical \\"Khamba\\" of the \\"Moirang Kangleirol\\" epic. Historically, according to the manuscript titled Loiyumba Silyen, King Meidingu Loiyumba (1074-1122) assigned the task of weaving of ‘Yarongphi (local name for Moirang Phee) to Moirang villagers It was made by the villagers to gift the designed fabric as a tribute to the Meitei rulers, the then royal family of Manipur. It is also the historic place where INA flag was unfurled in 1944. The village is located from Imphal, the capital of Manipur. Details of the product The \\"MoirangPheejin\\" design, known in local language as Yarongphi ('ya' means \\"tooth\\", 'rong' means \\"long\\" and 'longba' means \\"pronged\\"), which is weaved over the Moirang Phee fabric is stated to represent the thin and pointed teeth of the \\"Pakhangba\\", the Pythonic god in Manipur mythology. This motif, arranged in varying steps, on the longitudinal border of the main fabric woven during the first stage, has a sharp edge at the top and is woven sequentially to give an aesthetic appearance to the fabric. The triangular shaped design elongates on odd numbers of steps (such as 3, 5, 9, 11 and so forth) towards the center of the cloth on which it is woven, and is parallel to weft threads. This design is made to suit the fabric such as a sari, stole, sarong, school uniforms, lungi, skirts and half sari. The count of the weft of cotton or silk yarn used varies from 2/40S to 2/80S. The fabric is woven by women, and is used by them during marriages and other festivities. The fibre used to make the yarn is a derivative of “Lashing” (Cotton ball) and “Kabrang” (Mulberry cocoon). It is also extracted from the bark of the tree species, locally called as \\"Santhak\\" (Urtica sp.). The local fibre is spun into threads and then dyed using plants and bark. The dyed yarn is subject to sizing by applying starch made of rice, and then stretched across using a bamboo rod, which is followed by winding into bobbin. The fabric woven in two stages is made using loin loom or throw shuttle and fly shuttle loom; the throw shuttle loom is considered the most suitable. According to the GI registration stipulations for the fabric, an inspection agency, comprising nine officials from the government, societies and the craftsmen, has been instituted to check the quality of the product made by weavers.

In 1993 he was forcibly retired at the age of 55 but following the election of the People's Alliance government at the 1994 parliamentary elections they granted the option for senior police officers who had faced potential political victimisation to appeal and request to be re- instated with back-wages. Rajaguru was one of the six officers reinstated and placed in the rank of Senior DIG. He was appointed as IGP on 29 July 1995. In 1996 he established the Central Anti Vice Striking Force (CAVSF), a police division whose focus was stopping public-order crimes like gambling, narcotics, prostitution, and illegal sales of alcohol. On 7 December 1996 an American-built Bell 212 air force helicopter carrying Sri Lanka’s Deputy Defence Minister, Anuruddha Ratwatte, Army Commander, Rohan Daluwatte and Rajaguru crashed several miles north of the Weli Oya army base in Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam-held jungle of northern Sri Lanka.

Greenland Treaty The Greenland Treaty was an agreement between the member states of the European Communities, concerning Greenland's exit from the European Communities. It followed the Greenlandic referendum in 1982 in which voters supported exiting the EC. The Treaty arranged for the exit of Greenland and amended earlier treaties of the European Communities. As such, it is an integral part of the constitutional basis of the European Union. The decision to withdraw was made after Greenland had achieved self-rule, was made to protect Greenland's rights to its fishing waters and to limit external influence. When Denmark entered the EC in 1973, Greenland was a special part of Denmark with not much self-rule, so Greenland had no choice but to enter the EC with Denmark. This was in opposite to the Faroe Islands, which had self-rule and decided not to enter the EC. The Treaty entered into force on 1 February 1985 and as a result Greenland formally withdrew from the European Communities.

Biography  The son of Pierre-Joseph Basté and Louise- Thérèse Grangé, Pierre-Eugène Basté was born in in Paris. He attended the school and the collège Charlemagne. After graduation, he began working in a banking house that he left to start a literary career. At 17, he found himself having comédies en vaudeville played in the small theaters of Boulevard du Temple. He would sign these pieces with his middle name, Eugène and his mother's surname. He became the favorite author of Théâtre des Funambules and of Mme Saqui's show. By that time, he was dubbed the \\"Scribe of the boulevard du Temple\\". As a consequence of his success, Mme Saqui wanted him to work exclusively for her. For a year or two, Grangé would be the sole - and highly paid - author of her theater. In 1833, he gave the théâtre des Folies- Dramatiques a three-act play: Le Gamin, in collaboration with Lubize (1798-1863). ). Then, in 1836, he presented the théâtre des Variétés with Le Tour de faction, which was met with great success. During his career, he addressed all genres: comedy, vaudeville, drama, féerie, year-end review. Eugene Grangé was also a songwriter and a goguettier. He would participate to the monthly singing dinners of the Gnoufs-Gnoufs founded in 1858. Then, in May 1865 at the invitation and under the patronage of his friend Clairville, he joined the Fourth société du Caveau À propos Grangé's participation to the Société du Caveau, see the article Une gracieuseté de l'Illustration in La Chanson illustrée n°66, 1870, p.2. of which he eventually became a full member. He would be elected president seven times (1868, 1872, 1874, 1877, 1880, 1882 and 1884). At the end of the year 1879, Louis Henry Lecomte evaluated Grangé's output to no less than 350 plays and 300 songs that were inserted into the magazine Le Caveau. A certain number of volumes of these are avalaibable on Gallica. In addition to these songs are 72 speeches in verse that he gave as president of the Caveau. In 1881, he wrote the foreword presentation of his friend Henri Fénée's songbook, like him a member of the Caveau.

It was opened in July 1921 and is located in Hamburg, Germany, in the quarter of Langenhorn. Langenhorn is part of the borough of Hamburg-Nord. History Western train depot; the ANB station was located above the sheet pile wall on the right. The station was opened in July 1921, after the Langenhorn railway was in preliminary operation with steam trains since 5 January 1918. At that time there was a preliminary passenger platform at the freight yard, which was located north of the U-Bahn station. After 1921 one U-Bahn train per hour left Ochsenzoll to Ohlsdorf station, two during rush hours. On 5 May 1953 the Alster Northern Railway (Alsternordbahn, ANB), the first new railway line in the Federal Republic of Germany, opened from Ochsenzoll in northern direction to Ulzburg Süd station. Today it is part of the AKN network. The ANB station was an at-grade station, located north of today's western train depot of the station, on the western side of the street of Langenhorner Chaussee. In 1962, the U-Bahn company Hamburger Hochbahn decided to build a new Ochsenzoll station, which was needed for an extension of the line to the Norderstedt borough of Garstedt on Schleswig-Holstein territory. In 1963 the old entrance building of the station was demolished, underpasses for the U-Bahn tracks and also a pedestrian subway were built under Langenhorner Chaussee, and also the western train depot was constructed. In 1964 the aforementioned construction works were completed. Since 1967 the U-Bahn tracks were extended to Garstedt station, the new station was opened in 1969. From March to September 2015 a lift was constructed at the station's entrance, and the platform was partly elevated to allow an easier access for handicapped people. On the compound of the freight yard, which had been closed in 1991 and the tracks removed at the end of the 2000s, a car dealer expanded its facilities, including a shopping mall and a car park. The car park was originally planned as a Park and Ride facility, but due to protests and legal proceedings of residents of nearby street of Stockflethweg the car dealer company decided to use it only as a car park for their offered cars.Kein Park- and-Ride Parkhaus in Hamburg - Ochsenzoll, NDR.de, in German A further Park and Ride facility is projected.

There are only few parking slots and some bicycle facilities. There are two train depots, one to the west and one to the east of the station. Also there is a railway line control center (Streckenzentrale) of the Hamburger Hochbahn near the station. Service Ochsenzoll is served by Hamburg U-Bahn line U1; departures are every 5 minutes, every 10 minutes in non-busy periods. Bus lines 278, 292, 7550, 7551, and night bus line 606 serve the station.

The outer panels had a dihedral of 4.5°. The wing was built around two wooden box spars; its ribs were also wooden and the skin was birch plywood. Long ailerons filled much of the outer panels' trailing edges. Like the wings the fuselage was wooden, with four longerons defining its flat-sided form; it, too, had stressed birch ply skin. A Train 4T four-cylinder, air-cooled, inverted straight engine drove a two-blade propeller. The two occupants sat side by side in an open cockpit, fitted with dual control, over the wing. Its empennage was conventional, with a horizontal tail mounted on top of the fuselage and strongly straight-tapered like the wing. The elevators were inset and separate, with a gap between them to allow the movement of a deep, balanced rudder mounted on a small fin. The construction of the rear surfaces was similar to that of the wings. The Régnier 12 had a wide track, conventional undercarriage. Each mainwheel was at the end of a vertical oleo strut mounted on the forward wing spar, together with a rearward drag strut to the lower fuselage longeron. Its steel tailskid had two coil springs. Development The Régnier 12 was registered as OO-REG on 8 August 1936; the date of its first flight is not known, though tests with an unknown type of engine had started before May 1937. It appears that the Train engine was fitted by the time of the 1st Brussels Aero Salon in late May 1937. By July 1937 it had been flown solo by its designer, a pilot with only ten hours experience.

He has been a Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP), as one of the additional members for the Central Scotland region, since 2016. He ideologically identifies as a socialist, democrat and internationalist. Born and raised in North Yorkshire, Leonard won a scholarship to be educated at Pocklington School. He moved to Scotland in the 1980s to study Politics and Economics at the University of Stirling. Following his graduation, he worked as an aide to Labour politician Alex Falconer before working as a trade unionist for the Scottish Trades Union Congress and GMB Scotland. From 2002 to 2003, he served as Chair of the Scottish Labour Party when he was active in opposing the Iraq War. After unsuccessfully contesting Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley in 2011, he was elected at the 2016 Scottish Parliament election on the Central Scotland regional list. Leonard defeated Anas Sarwar to win the 2017 Scottish Labour Party leadership election, succeeding Kezia Dugdale. He later took on the role of Scottish Labour Spokesperson for Economy, Jobs and Fair Work in a 2018 frontbench reshuffle when he replaced Jackie Baillie. A supporter of former Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, he has been credited for shifting Scottish Labour leftwards but criticised for poor results in the 2019 European Parliament election and 2019 general election. After Jackie Baillie was elected as his new deputy leader in 2020, he has been under pressure to resign from members of the political right of the party.  Early life and career  Leonard was born in January 1962 in Westow, North Riding of Yorkshire and raised in the market town of Malton, North Yorkshire. He is the son of Derek, a tailor and member of the Tailor and Garment Workers Union, and Janet, who looked after him and his two sisters. From the age of 11, he was educated at the fee-paying independent Pocklington School, East Riding of Yorkshire, having received a local education authority scholarship. As a young boy, his first job was picking potatoes in Autumn. In his youth, he was inspired politically by Arguments for Socialism written by Tony Benn, a leftist Labour Member of Parliament and former cabinet minister. He was further influenced by Farewell to the Working Class and Critique of Economic Reason by Austrian philosopher André Gorz, as well as the works of early socialist novelist William Morris. Leonard studied Politics and Economics at the University of Stirling, where he was a member of the Labour club and president of the Students' Association. He was a contemporary of future First Minister of Scotland Jack McConnell and they shared a flat together for a time following graduation. While a student, he had a summer job weeding wheat fields in Suffolk, East Anglia after his family moved south to help his father find work. After university, he went on to spend five years working as an aide to Alex Falconer, Member of the European Parliament for Mid Scotland and Fife. He then spent a further five years as head of economics and assistant secretary for the Scottish Trades Union Congress. He then worked for 20 years as a GMB Scotland industrial organiser, a role in which he represented women, apprentices and young people on low pay.  Early political career  Official parliamentary portrait, 2016Throughout Leonard's working life, he was active in the Scottish Labour Party, including serving as one of its chairs from 2002 until 2003. He served as election agent for Anne McGuire in Stirling in the 1997 general election, where they unseated Secretary of State for Scotland Michael Forsyth by 6,411 votes. Leonard opposed the 2003 invasion of Iraq, marching against the war and describing the bombing of Baghdad as \\"awful\\". Leonard stood as the Labour candidate for Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley in the 2011 Scottish Parliament election but lost to the Scottish National Party's Adam Ingram. In the 2016 Scottish Parliament election, he contested Airdrie and Shotts. The SNP's Alex Neil held the seat but Leonard was elected as a Member of the Scottish Parliament as one of seven additional members for the Central Scotland region. Shortly after his election as an MSP, he was given a junior role on the Scottish Labour frontbench as Shadow Economy Minister by leader Kezia Dugdale. He supported Jeremy Corbyn in the 2016 UK Labour Party leadership election.  Leader of the Scottish Labour Party  = 2017 Scottish Labour Party leadership election = The 2017 Scottish Labour Party leadership election was triggered by the sudden resignation of Kezia Dugdale in the August. During the campaign to decide her successor, BBC News described Leonard as more left-wing than his rival, Anas Sarwar. Leonard received celebrity endorsement from cult comic book scribe Mark Millar, known for Kick-Ass and Kingsman, who said he was \\"the most exciting thing to happen up here in decades\\". On 18 November 2017, it was announced he had been elected as Leader of the Scottish Labour Party, receiving 56.7% of the vote on a 62.3% turnout. Only a few hours after the leadership election result was declared, Kezia Dugdale announced she was set to join reality TV game show I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!. This would mean she would be in Australia for several weeks while the Scottish Parliament was still in session. Leonard said he would discuss with Labour MSPs whether she would be suspended for failing to notify the party. It was decided she would not be suspended but, instead, sent a written warning from Scottish Labour Parliamentary Business Manager James Kelly. When she returned from Australia, she met with Leonard and other colleagues and released a statement expressing regret at her announcement overshadowing Leonard's victory. She also donated the earnings from her MSP's salary while absent, as well as part of the money earned from the show, to charity. = Early leadership: 2017–2019 = Leonard was an ally of Labour leader Jeremy CorbynIn December 2017, Leonard announced his new Shadow Cabinet. Jackie Baillie, Scottish Labour's longest-serving constituency MSP, was appointed as Spokesperson for Economy, Jobs and Fair Work. Leonard's former leadership rival Anas Sarwar was kept as Health and Sport Spokesperson. Neil Findlay, a close ally of both Leonard and Jeremy Corbyn, was made Brexit and Constitutional Relations Spokesperson. The announcement of Elaine Smith as Inequality Spokesperson was controversial. A practising Roman Catholic, she had a record of opposing same-sex marriage, likening it to polygamy in 2013. Leonard said he disagreed with her position on same-sex marriage but felt her criticisms of wealth disparity justified her appointment. Leonard somewhat distanced himself from Jeremy Corbyn in 2017, saying \\"I'm too long in the tooth to be a Corbynista\\". However, in his 2018 Labour Party Conference speech, he \\"confessed\\" to voting for Corbyn to be leader both in 2015 and 2016 because he believed Scotland would need a radical Corbyn government. Under his leadership, Scottish Labour would also go on to adopt the \\"For the Many, Not the Few\\" branding of the UK Labour Party. President of the United States Donald Trump, who is of part-Scottish descent, travelled to Scotland during his July 2018 UK state visit. Leonard and his deputy Lesley Laird attended protests in Glasgow and outside the Scottish Parliament opposing the visit because of Trump's attitudes and actions towards women, ethnic minorities and the poor. Trump returned to Scotland while on a June 2019 royal visit and Leonard spoke at a protest rally outside St Giles' Cathedral in Edinburgh. In September 2018, Scottish Labour cut funding for Kezia Dugdale's defence in a defamation case by video games journalist and nationalist blogger Stuart Campbell. They had previously promised not to do so and there was controversy over whether the decision was encouraged by the UK party. Dugdale subsequently won the case on the grounds of principle of fair comment. In leaked messages, Edinburgh South MP Ian Murray wrote, \\"Ultimately she won her case and the party lost £80,000 as they would’ve got their costs had they kept their promise.\\" He also wrote the decision was the \\"final straw\\" which caused her to leave Holyrood in 2019 and he angrily derided the Scottish Labour leadership as \\"full of thugs and incompetents\\". Leonard carried out a Shadow Cabinet reshuffle in October 2018, following a series of negative briefings by MSPs close to Kezia Dugdale. He took on the role of Economy Spokesperson, dismissing Jackie Baillie. Anas Sarwar was replaced by Monica Lennon, who was succeeded as Communities and Local Government Spokesperson by Alex Rowley. Both Lennon and Rowley had been allies of Leonard, and ally Neil Findlay was given the added role of Scottish Labour Business Manager. Critics of Leonard briefed the reshuffle was a purge of moderate MSPs. They also criticised how Baillie and Sarwar found out about their dismissals; Baillie by phone five minutes before it was publicly announced and Sarwar over Twitter while attending a Holyrood chamber debate. Leonard said the reshuffle was necessary to refresh his frontbench and ensure unity among its members. Former government minister Hugh Henry defended Leonard, arguing Baillie and Sarwar had both been disloyal. Following the resignation of Kezia Dugdale from the Scottish Parliament in 2019, former MSP and Transport Minister Sarah Boyack took her place on the Lothian regional list. In the September, Leonard appointed her Local Government Spokesperson. He moved Alex Rowley to cover Brexit and Constitutional Relations and moved Finance Spokesperson James Kelly to cover Justice. He also brought on North Ayrshire Council leader Joe Cullinane as head of campaigns and party engagement. Leonard said the additions would strengthen his core team but admitted Scottish Labour would still \\"need to make a strong case\\" to win back voters. In April 2019, Anas Sarwar's case against Rutherglen Councillor Davie McLachlan, who allegedly said \\"Scotland wouldn’t vote for a brown Muslim Paki\\", was dropped by the National Constitutional Committee on a technicality. In public support of Sarwar, Leonard said, \\"We have doubled the size of the National Constitutional Committee which hears these cases but, as this case shows, clearly more still needs to be done\\". At the 2019 Edinburgh Fringe, Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer John McDonnell insisted a Labour government would not block the holding of a second Scottish independence referendum if the Scottish Parliament voted for one. These remarks met with opposition from Leonard and other Scottish Labour colleagues. This caused Jeremy Corbyn to issue a statement that a Scottish Parliament vote could not be the only requirement for a new mandate, other requirements had yet to be met and, if they were met, a referendum would still not be priority for an incoming government. Both Leonard and McDonnell accepted Corbyn's decision on the matter, which was a compromise between their two positions. = 2019 European Parliament election and aftermath: April–September 2019 = Leonard led Scottish Labour into the 2019 European Parliament election with the party inheriting, from 2014, two of the six seats in Scotland. David Martin, an MEP since 1984, was first on the party list and former MSP Jayne Baxter succeeded Catherine Stihler as second. The campaign was managed by Neil Findlay. Scottish Labour vowed to pursue a \\"soft Brexit\\", consistent with the UK party. This was heavily challenged by the overtly pro-Remain SNP, as well as an insurgent Brexit Party. Brexit compounded an issue already facing Scottish Labour in the wake of the 2014 Scottish independence referendum; its loss of nationalist support to the SNP and unionist support to the Scottish Conservatives. In leaked WhatsApp messages, the \\"soft Brexit\\" position taken by Leonard's campaign was criticised by Shadow Minister for Scotland Paul Sweeney, who wrote, \\"If it’s like this then it’s a bad misjudgement and I’m having nothing to do with it... Let’s hope the NEC [National Executive Committee] kill this bullshit line.\\" Rutherglen and Hamilton West MP Ged Killen wrote that the stance had given the SNP \\"a new lease of life\\" and East Lothian MP Martin Whitfield added that Labour was at risk of being \\"dead in Scotland\\". Only Jeremy Corbyn's face was placed on the cover of the Scottish Labour campaign leaflet, which Leonard later admitted was a mistake and a missed opportunity to promote himself as more than Corbyn's \\"man in Scotland\\". The result for Scotland was declared on 27 May 2019. Scottish Labour lost both its seats, receiving 9.3% of the vote and coming fifth behind the SNP, Brexit Party, Scottish Liberal Democrats and Scottish Conservatives respectively. In the aftermath, Leonard accepted responsibility and said he would endorse remaining in the European Union, defying the UK party. Findlay resigned from his frontbench roles and promised to resign as an MSP at the 2021 Scottish Parliament election. Justice Spokesperson Daniel Johnson also resigned, citing the election result and a lack of clarity on Brexit from Leonard. In September, Leonard moved Alex Rowley to cover Brexit and Constitutional Relations and moved Finance Spokesperson James Kelly to replace Daniel Johnson as Justice Spokesperson. He also brought on North Ayrshire Council leader Joe Cullinane as head of campaigns and party engagement. Following Kezia Dugdale's resignation from the Scottish Parliament, former MSP and Transport Minister Sarah Boyack took Dugdale's place on the Lothian regional list and Leonard appointed her as Local Government Spokesperson. Leonard said the additions would strengthen his core team but admitted Scottish Labour would still \\"need to make a strong case\\" to win back voters. = 2019 general election: November–December 2019 = During the 2019 general election, Leonard led the Labour campaign in Scotland. Campaign for Socialism member Lesley Brennan served as his chief of staff, former Morning Star editor Conrad Landin as director of communications and Joe Cullinane as head of campaigns and party engagement. The core campaign pledge made by Leonard and Jeremy Corbyn was to invest an extra £70 billion in Scottish public services. On a two-day trip to Scotland, Jeremy Corbyn was heckled in Glasgow on the first day and Dundee on the second day. In Glasgow, by a church minister over Corbyn's connections to Islamist terrorists. In Dundee, by a Scottish nationalist. The Church of Scotland later suspended the minister for historic anti-Islam and homophobic social media posts. Scottish Labour saw itself lose the six seats it had gained in the 2017 general election, under Kezia Dugdale. Once again, the party was reduced to holding a single seat. Leonard apologised for the UK party failing to address concerns over Brexit and for the Scottish party not having stopped what he described as the \\"SNP juggernaut\\". However, he said he would continue as leader and carry out a listening exercise. = Election of Jackie Baillie as deputy leader: 2020–present = After internal critic Jackie Baillie won the deputy leadership in April 2020, Scottish Labour peer George Foulkes called on Leonard to resign and be replaced by Baillie before the 2021 Scottish Parliament election. Foulkes was joined in calls for Leonard to resign by James Kelly, Daniel Johnson, Jenny Marra, Mark Griffin and Rachel Reeves. Leonard accused his critics of never supporting his leadership and mounting \\"an internal war\\". He also suggested MSPs could face deselection for showing disloyalty, said attempts to oust him as leader were an \\"act of sabotage\\" and confirmed he would fight any challenger for the leadership. In an interview with Sky News, Leonard continued to emphasise his mandate from Scottish Labour members and that there had been five Scottish Labour leaders in the previous six years.  Political positions and views  Leonard speaking at the 2018 Labour Party Conference's alt=During the 2019 general election campaign, Leonard described himself as a \\"socialist, democrat and internationalist\\". He has been described by journalists as being left-wing, on the hard left and hostile to business. His politics have been described by allies as radical, conviction-led and based around representing and helping people. An ally of Jeremy Corbyn, his closeness to Corbyn has been criticised as costing Scottish Labour in the polls. He is a long-standing member of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND), which opposes the replacement of Trident with a new nuclear weapons system. However, he has stated he would defer to the position of the UK Labour Party, as defence is a non-devolved matter. Leonard has said he wants to fundamentally change the Scottish economy and has advocated a shift to a more planned, long-term approach to economic management. He is described in Tom Bower's biography Dangerous Hero: Corbyn's Ruthless Plot for Power as \\"a Marxist\\". When questioned over this assertion in an interview with Novara Media's Ash Sarkar, Leonard said, despite having read Marx, he would not describe his politics as Marxist but rather a synthesis of \\"Scottish radicalism\\" and those of \\"post-industrial Utopians\\". Leonard has stated leaving the United Kingdom would create larger problems for Scotland than the UK leaving the European Union. He is an opponent of a second Scottish independence referendum and has argued the 2014 referendum, in which Scotland voted to stay by 55% to 45%, was a once in a generation event. While the United Kingdom as a whole voted to leave the European Union by 52% to 48% in the 2016 EU referendum, Scotland itself voted to remain by 62% to 38%. Despite this, Leonard was initially in favour of the UK Labour Party's position of pursuing a \\"soft Brexit\\". In the aftermath of his party's poor result in the 2019 European Parliament election, he subsequently agreed to shift his pursuit to the UK remaining in the EU. A former trade unionist, Leonard argues the Scottish Government must recognise trade unions and pay a real living wage on all its public contracts. He has said he would support Scotland's red meat industry by investing more in abattoirs and rural supply chains, and would aim for full employment in the Highlands and Islands. He has also discussed seeing working time as a unit of currency and aiming for a managed reduction in the length of work weeks. He has stated Scottish Labour has \\"unfinished business\\" with land reform and should replace council tax with a property and land tax to force tax burden onto those with more wealth and more land. He advocates nationalising Scottish railways, removing Scotrail from private ownership by Abellio, and bus services, with the wider aim of making bus travel free for all.  Personal life  Leonard lives in Paisley, Renfrewshire and is married to Karen, an organiser for GMB Scotland, with whom he has a son and a stepdaughter. The couple own a female Hungarian vizsla named Copper. He studies socialist history as a hobby, co-founding the Keir Hardie Society and being a member of the Scottish Labour History Society and the William Morris Society. He is a fan of musician Paul Weller.

His term coincided with the Rwandan Revolution and the assassination of the popular Burundian political leader Prince Louis Rwagasore. It has been alleged that Harroy may have been implicated in the murder. Education and career Jean-Paul Harroy studied at the Solvay Business School from which he graduated as a business engineer in 1931. In 1936, he obtained a degree in colonial sciences at the Free University of Brussels and in 1946 the title of doctor in colonial sciences. His thesis addressed soil erosion in Central Africa and was entitled Afrique, terre qui meurt, la dégradation des sols africains sous l'influence de la colonisation (\\"Africa, a dying land: The Degradation of African Soils under the Influence of Colonization\\"). This thesis had a certain international impact, both in the United States and in the Soviet Union, and Harroy was widely seen as a leading expert on applied ecology in Africa. From 1932 to 1935 Jean-Paul Harroy worked in the family company before being appointed to manage the Institut des Parcs Nationaux du Congo belge, a precursor of the Institut congolais pour la conservation de la nature. From 1948 to 1955, Jean-Paul Harroy was the first secretary-general of the International Union for Protection of Nature, later to become the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). Controversy and the assassination of Prince Louis Rwagasore Harroy arrived in Ruanda-Urundi in 1955 and served as the territory's Governor in addition to being the Vice Governor-General of the Belgian Congo. Following Urundi's formal request for independence on 20 January 1959, Urundi's first democratic elections took place on 8 September 1961. These elections were won by UPRONA, a multi-ethnic unity party led by Prince Louis Rwagasore, which won just over 80 percent of the electorate's votes.

Early life and career  Lennon was born in Bellshill and raised in Blantyre, South Lanarkshire, the daughter of Gerald \\"Gerry\\" Ward, a council health and safety manager, and his wife Helen. She attended the co-educational, Roman Catholic John Ogilvie High School in Hamilton. Lennon studied environmental planning at the University of Strathclyde, graduating with a BA degree in 2001. While studying she lived with her father. Her parents had separated, and later divorced, as a result of her father's drinking which developed into severe alcoholism. From 2001 until 2007, Lennon worked as a planning officer for South Lanarkshire Council. She married at the age of 24 but felt forced to exclude her father from the wedding because of his alcoholism; he died 60 years old. After leaving South Lanarkshire Council, she worked as a surveyor for commercial property consultancy Knight Frank, also freelancing as a planning consultant, until her election in 2012.  Political career  In the 2012 South Lanarkshire Council election, Lennon was elected to represent Hamilton North and East. Then, in the 2016 Scottish Parliament election, she was second on Scottish Labour's Central Scotland regional list and was elected as a Member of the Scottish Parliament. Shortly after being elected, she was appointed by leader Kezia Dugdale as Shadow Minister for Inequalities, a role in which she campaigned to raise awareness about the need for women to check themselves for signs of breast cancer. In the 2017 Scottish Labour Party leadership election, Lennon nominated fellow Central Scotland MSP and left-wing ally Richard Leonard. In December 2017, Leonard announced his new Shadow Cabinet, in which she was promoted to Spokesperson for Communities and Local Government. In November 2017, Lennon went public with how she was sexually assaulted by a Labour colleague while other colleagues brushed off the incident at a party in 2013. Following revelations of similar incidents within the party, she argued that the party and British politics had an institutional problem with sexual assault and harassment. On 6 September 2018, Lennon made a speech in which she spoke of a constituent who had committed suicide shortly after Christmas 2017. The constituent pled with health services for help eight times in the six days directly before he died, but was either turned away or referred elsewhere. Lennon asked Nicola Sturgeon to take urgent action to review suicide prevention procedures in NHS Lanarkshire. In an October 2018 Shadow Cabinet reshuffle, Lennon was again promoted to Spokesperson for Health and Sport, replacing Richard Leonard's former leadership rival Anas Sarwar. She used the position to campaign for institutions to provide free menstrual hygiene products, to tackle period poverty. Along with Neil Findlay, Lennon abstained on an SNP government bill in favour of a second Scottish independence referendum. This was against their party's whip, which was to vote against the bill.  Personal life  Lennon is married with one daughter, Isabella. She is a feminist and a vegetarian, and suffers from ailurophobia, an irrational fear of cats.

The Bonwill Triangle is named after him.  Life  Bonwill was born as the son of W. M. Bonwill, a medical practitioner. He finished 1866 with a degree in dentistry at the Pennsylvania College of Dental Surgery and then studied medicine at the Jefferson Medical College. In October 1854 he settled in Dover, Delaware in private practice. He practiced there until 1871 and then moved to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. September 24, 1899 Bonwill died at St. Joseph's Hospital, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, to a sepsis secondary to prostate surgery, which had caused an acute cystitis and chronic nephritis.Javier Sanz Serrulla, WilliamG.A.Bonwill, Maxillaris, January 2006 (Spanish).  Research  Bonwill was engaged in the development of dentistry throughout his life. To date, his findings are associated with his name. About his dental research a long list of inventions have made him famous among professionals of his time, such as combine harvesters for wheat harvest, kerosene lamps, boilers, lighters and more. Mostly he patented his inventions. = Bonwill Triangle = Bonwill-Triangle of the mandible He examined 4,000 mandibles of corpses and another 6,000 from living people and found that the distance between the condyles was four inches and the distance between each condyle and the contact point of the two lower central incisors, the incisal point of the mandible (lower jaw), corresponded. The latter is also called symphysis. These three points form an equilateral triangle, which does not change throughout life. Bonwill presented these findings in 1864 during a meeting of the Delaware Dental Society to the dental public. This triangle is established as the Bonwill triangle in the scientific literature. He completed his findings that the dimensions of the teeth and other cranial bones and even the whole body are in constant relation to the length of the sides of this triangle. He postulated the fact that as soon as the dimensions of a tooth are known, it´s possible to deduce the entire skeleton. = Bonwill articulator = After preliminary work by Daniel Evans (1840) and as a result of his jaw measurements Bonwill developed in 1864 the first Bonwill articulator, a device for simulating the temporomandibular joint movements for manufacturing dentures. These plaster models of the dental arches of the upper and lower jaw are mounted in occlusion in the articulator. Bonwill coined the term articulation and replaced the older concept of occlusion. Its principle was used in almost all advanced articulators. He is considered the architect of the \\"balanced occlusion\\" and referred to the \\"three point contact\\". = Gold foil filling = In 1867 he developed an electromagnetic hammer, with which one could use gold as a restorative material for a tooth gold foil filling easier and faster, and had it patented in 1873. In November 1875, he was honored for this work with the Elliott Cresson Medal, the highest award of the Franklin Institute of Philadelphia. He expanded the technique for condensing amalgam while laying amalgam fillings. = Anesthesia = Mandibular partial denture with Bonwill Brace (left) He developed a method for anesthesia in minor surgery, during childbirth and in dental procedures through a forced breathing of the patient (hyperventilation). For this purpose, the patient must perform 80-100 breaths per minute. It was published in 1875 under the title \\"The air an anesthetic\\" and presented at the Franklin Institute.Before the Lamaze Method.

The Bonwill Brace is a support bracket - by combining two brackets, which includes two adjacent teeth.Volker Bienengräber, Die Zahnmedizin zum Zeitpunkt der Gründung des Central-Vereins deutscher Zahnärzte – ein historischer Rückblick, Deutscher Ärzte-Verlag, DZZ, Deutsche Zahnärztliche Zeitschrift (2011); 66 (1), S. 57–58  Literature  * Erich Göhler, Bonwill und seine Verdienste um die Entwicklung der Zahnheilkunde, Medizinische Dissertation., Leipzig, 1926, Glashütte i.

He is member of the center-right Croatian Democratic Union. Early life and education  Predrag Šustar was born 11 March 1970 in Rijeka, where he finished elementary and high school. In 1989, he enrolled in the study of molecular biology at the Biology department of the Zagreb Faculty of Science from which he graduate in biological engineering on April 27, 1994. After graduation, Šustar enrolled in University of Pisa, but transferred in August 1995 to the Philosophy department of the University of Padua from which he graduated in philosophy on December 2, 1999. On January 14, 2000, he began his postgraduate studies on the same university. He gained his PhD on February 13, 2003.http://www.hrt.hr/fileadmin/video/Predrag_Sustar.pdf Career From September 2 until December 15, 2001, Šustar was visiting scholar at the Columbia University. On December 15, 2003, he was elected to the academic title of docent from the history of philosophy and philosophy of science, and become employed at the Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences of the University of Rijeka. From September 5 until June 4, 2007, he was Fulbright visiting scholar at the Columbia University, with his mentor for the project \\"Science and Human World View: Kant’s Teleology Account\\" being professor Philip Kitcher. From 2007 until 2009, Šustar served as Head of Department of Philosophy of the Rijeka Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences, and from 2008 until 2010, Vice Dean for General Affairs of the same Faculty. On February 18, 2009, he was elected to the academic title of associate professor. From 2009 until 2015, he served two terms as Dean of the Rijeka Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences. From March 1, 2015 until September 30, 2016, he worked as visiting professor in the doctoral programs of the Departments of Philosophy and Biology at the University of Padua. Politics Šustar got enrolled in politics in 2013 when he ran as candidate for the mayor of Rijeka of the center-left Croatian Labourists – Labour Party. After he lost election to Vojko Obersnel, he left Labour Party and joined center-right Croatian Democratic Union. Šustar describes himself as \\"catholic, traditionalist, and demochristian\\". Views on evolution In article \\"Science And Religion in the “Theory Of Natural Philosophy“ by Roger Joseph Boscovich\\", that Šustar wrote with his college Aleksandra Golubović and published in Rijeka theological journal in October 2012, he wrote: \\"It seems that so far the theory of evolution did not offer definitive solutions, which still leaves room for God as a designer. What, in other words, means that the option of God (as intelligent designer) remains open (ie, it is most likely).\\" He was publicly criticized by physicists Ivica Puljak (CERN) and Dejan Vinković. Curricular reform controversy On May 25, 2016, head of the working group for the implementation of a comprehensive curricular reform, professor Boris Jokić and his team resigned citing political pressure from some members of the conservative Patriotic Coalition. Social Democratic Party of Croatia (SDP) called for Šustar's resignation. SDP member Sabina Glasovac, Vice-Chairwoman of the Committee on Education, Science and Culture of the Croatian Parliament, said that Šustar remained silent and that he was nothing more than a \\"formal minister\\" in an \\"incompetent government\\". This also triggered public outcry and launch of an online petition which was signed by more than 30,000 people in less than two days. Trade Union of Croatian Teachers, which represented 28.000 people, stated that they were \\"ready to organize a mass protest within three days if the government doesn't show a clear will to continue curricular reform.\\" On May 27, 2016, minister Šustar held a press conference of which he stated that the reform would continue with or without Jokić and his team, while at the same time urging Jokić to consider the withdrawal of resignation. He also criticized the Working group for the delay of public debate because they failed to achieve the set goals within the due time. Šustar announced an independent international review of the reform at the end of the process of its creation and stated that he expected that the experimental phase of the reform would start as early as of 2017, or latest in 2018, as it was planned by the Working group. On May 31, 2016, President Kolinda Grabar-Kitarović issued an open letter in which she expressed her support to Boris Jokić urging him not to give up, and calling minister Šustar to allow the continuation of the preparation of curriculum reform and its implementation as soon as possible. Shorty afterward, Grabar-Kitarović held a meeting with minister Šustar and professor Jokić on which they all agreed that the reform should continue immediately. However, Jokić stated that he would not withdraw his resignation. President promised that she, as the guarantor of stability, was going to do anything to eliminate the political pressure on the reform process. On June 1, 2016, more than 40.000 people participated in the pro- reform \\"Croatia Can Do Better\\" protests that were held in Zagreb, Split, Križevci, Dubrovnik, Slavonski Brod, Osijek, Bjelovar, Rijeka, Virovitica, Poreč, Pula, Zadar, Korčula, Shanghai, Budapest, Berlin, Paris, London and New York City. At the end of the central protest held in Zagreb which was attended by more than 25,000 people, organizers read four requests to politicians: 1. Let experts and teachers continue their work independently, without pressure, political intervention and censorship; 2. Croatian Parliament has to express support to the reform, Boris Jokić and his team; 3. Croatian Parliament has to enact a resolution on education as a national strategic interest that would obligate all the future governments; 4. Croatian Government must provide money and autonomy to implement the reform, and protect it from sabotages or it has to resign. Memberships Šustar is member of Croatian Philosophical Society, Croatian Society for Analytic Philosophy, International Society for the History of Philosophy of Science, Philosophy of Science Association, American Philosophical Association, International Society for the History, Philosophy and Social Studies of Biology, and European Philosophy of Science Association.

Background  Aden was an independent city-state whose strategic location allowed it to control the entrance of the Red Sea.Fritze, Ronald H. (2002). New Worlds: The Great Voyages of Discovery, 1400-1600. Gloucestershire: Sutton. p. 191. .Newitt, Malyn (2005). A History of Portuguese Overseas Expansion, 1400–1668. London: Routledge. pp. 81–82. . It became a wealthy trading area due to its location at the crossroads of busy trade routes into the Red Sea. Albuquerque's plan to capture Aden would allow him to dominate the Red Sea and strike a military blow at Egypt. Aden was one of four strategic places that Albuquerque wanted to capture: Aden – to control the straits of Mecca (Red Sea); Hormuz – to control the straits of Basra (the Persian Gulf); and Diu and Goa – to ensure sovereignty of all the other districts of India.Peters, F. E. (1994). Mecca: A Literary History of the Muslim Holy Land. Princeton: Princeton University Press. pp. 180–182. .  Siege  Attempted escalade of Aden in 1513 Albuquerque's fleet sailed from Goa, India, on 18 February 1513, and consisted of 20 ships manned by 1,700 Portuguese and 800 allied natives of Malabar.Vogel, Theodore (1877). A Century of Discovery: Biographical Sketches of the Portuguese and Spanish Navigators from Prince Henry to Pizarro. London: Seeley, Jackson, & Halliday. p. 125. The fleet arrived at Socotra Island. The captains deliberated on how to approach Aden. Some of Albuquerque's chiefs suggested an attempt at negotiated surrender while others pressed for an immediate attack. Albuquerque chose the latter option, believing that negotiations would give the inhabitants time to strengthen their defences or obtain reinforcements from elsewhere. Before dawn on Easter Sunday (26 March), the Portuguese commandeered some landing barges in the harbour, ferried their men ashore, and began their siege on Aden. They captured an outwork, where many defenders were slain and 39 pieces of ordnance were captured. However, they were later repulsed and suffered high casualties. The overall attack failed, with the scaling ladders collapsing under the weight of the men trying to mount them. This left some of the Portuguese trapped in isolation atop the wall. According to Albuquerque's biographer son, the attack was abandoned after all their scaling ladders broke. By midday, Albuquerque and his men withdrew to their ships. After plundering and burning the vessels in the harbour, and cannonading the town, the fleet sailed towards the Red Sea.  Aftermath  Albuquerque stated: \\"I think that if I had reconnoitred Aden first, I would not have launched our attack where I did.\\"Crowley, Roger (2015). Conquerors: How Portugal Seized the Indian Ocean and Forged the First Global Empire. New York: Random House. p. 292. . The failure to capture Aden significantly undermined his strategy. Without a base of operations at the mouth of the Red Sea, it was impossible for the Portuguese to prevent spices being shipped to Egypt and the Mediterranean by the traditional route. The Crown's ability to enforce a trade monopoly in the Indian Ocean had been fatally damaged. Alarmed by the Portuguese threat, the Egyptian Mamluks occupied the Yemeni Tihamah and attempted to capture Aden but failed. The Portuguese launched a second attack but also failed. Aden finally fell in 1538 to Suleiman Pasha, the commander of a large Ottoman fleet. Under Ottoman control, Aden was valued primarily as a barrier to European penetration of the holy cities rather than as an entrepôt for trade.Dumper, Michael R. T., ed; Stanley, Bruce E., ed. (2007).

It was composed in 1943 for the composer and Yvonne Loriod, and its performance requires about 40–45 minutes.  Overview  According to Messiaen's \\"author's note\\" attached to the original score,Stephen Schloesser, Visions of Amen: The Early Life and Music of Olivier Messiaen, Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, page 353. the work takes its inspiration from a quote of Ernest Hello: \\"Amen, word of Genesis, which leads to Revelation; Amen, word of Revelation, which is the consummation of Genesis\\". Messiaen gives four basic interpretations of Amen:Jean Wentworth, Review of Records, The Musical Quarterly, Vol. 59, No. 2 (Apr., 1973), pp. 323–328. \\"It is done\\", \\"So be it, according to thy will\\", \\"In the hope, the desire, that I may freely give and freely receive\\", \\"It is so, world without end\\". He describes the music as seven musical visions which reflect the living beings who say \\"Amen\\" in gratitude for their existence. Messiaen explains the different roles of the two piano parts: he assigned the primo part (played by Yvonne Loriod) \\"rhythmic difficulties, chord clusters, all that has speed, charm, and quality of sound\\". The secondo part (played by himself) he assigned \\"the principal melody, thematic elements, all that demands emotion and strength\\". One of the principal themes of the work is the Creation theme, appearing in the first movement in the bass in long notes, in the fifth movement in three variations (altered), and finally in the seventh movement, over ten times. Creation theme Movements There are seven movements: # Amen de la Création (\\"Amen of creation\\") # Amen des étoiles, de la planète à l'anneau (\\"Amen of stars, of the ringed planet\\") # Amen de l'agonie de Jésus (\\"Amen of Jesus' agony\\") # Amen du Désir (\\"Amen of desire\\") # Amen des Anges, des Saints, du chant des oiseaux (\\"Amen of angels, of saints, and of bird chant\\") # Amen du Jugement (\\"Amen of judgement\\") # Amen de la Consommation (\\"Amen of consummation\\") References Bibliography *Bruhn, Siglind (2008).

He is most known for his work on The Bone Wall, The Water Planet and Johnson & Johnson's Olympic Games Pavilion. He founded Urban A&O;, a design firm in 2002 and serves as its principal. MacDonald uses parametric modeling tools of CATIA-based software combined with digital fabrication processes to produce sculptural and geometrically complex forms and environments. He has received several research grants and awards, including four research grants from Harvard Graduate School of Design, China's Most Successful Design Award, and Vanguard Award by Architecture Magazine.  Education  MacDonald completed his B.A. in architecture from University of Washington in 1987. In 1992, he received his M.Arch. from Harvard University after briefly studying at the Architectural Association in London under Zaha Hadid. His master's thesis was titled Navigable Sites: Toronto Island Airport.  Career  In 2000, MacDonald joined Harvard University as an Assistant Professor. In 2002, while simultaneously teaching at Harvard University, he launched Urban A&O;, a boutique design firm specializing in advanced computational design work. Through the firm he started working on residential, commercial and exhibition design projects. MacDonald collaborated with sound artists O+A on an installation called Blue Moon. As part of the installation, three tuning tubes were installed in the North Cove Harbor, which created melodies and chords in response to ambient noise on the Hudson River. The sound was then played back through five cube loudspeakers. Blue Moon received wide media coverage. In 2004, MacDonald was promoted to Associate Professor at Harvard. MacDonald designed The Bone Wall, a solo exhibition at the Storefront for Art and Architecture, in 2006. The Bone Wall was sponsored by the Harvard Graduate School of Design and became of one of MacDonald's early well known works. In 2006, MacDonald collaborated with Thinc to design Water Planet, a multi-media aquarium experience at California Academy of Sciences. The Water Planet is shaped by an aggregate of seven walls surrounding three interactive islands. The seven walls house exhibits that illustrate a variety of evolutionary adaptations of life to water. MacDonald designed the fiberglass walls to resemble waves and the effect of an underwater experience. Openings in these walls provide windows to various aquarium tanks. ArtDaily reviewed the Water Planet and wrote that \\"Constructed using new technologies for computer-aided design and fabrication, the complex molded surfaces seemingly flow into one another, inviting touch and creating an immersive, watery setting.\\" In its review, the San Francisco Chronicle wrote that \\"when the lights are dimmed and images of kelp and underwater life are projected onto the cases, viewers get the feeling of being fully submerged.\\" In 2008, he was commissioned to design the Johnson & Johnson's Olympic Games Pavilion for the Beijing Olympics. The pavilion was surrounded by a bamboo forest that sheltered its guests and housed The Caring World, an exhibition exploring how people care for each other and the world. The exhibition highlighted the views of individuals through storytelling, documentary video and photo exhibition. It received significant media coverage and MacDonald won China's Most Successful Design Award and LEED Gold recognition award. Through his firm Urban A&O;, MacDonald was the lead designer for the 400th Henry Hudson anniversary exhibition in 2009. MacDonald left Harvard University in 2010. While at Harvard University, he received $25,000 in Dean’s Grants for Faculty Research four years consecutively. His research at Harvard was focused on advanced and emerging computational developments into parametric modeling. He has also received several other grants for his research on social patterns within dense urban environments. MacDonald has regularly incorporated his academic research into practice, most notably in his projects, The Bone Wall and Cairo Tower. MacDonald has designed urban and residential development planning projects in China and India. He has also worked with Audi, General Electric and Metropolis magazine as an architect. He regularly speaks at industry conferences around the world and was a speaker at TED 2006. He has lectured extensively on the relationship between architecture and technology. In 2010, he was recognized by Cambridge Who's Who for \\"demonstrating dedication, leadership and excellence in architecture and design.\\" In 2011-12, he taught briefly at Washington University in St. Louis and returned to teaching in 2018 at University of Pennsylvania.

It is notable for being the first SLR camera with a built in CdS light meter. It is a full mechanical camera - batteries are needed only to power the exposure meter. It is powered by a single PX625 battery (now discontinued, Wein Cell 625 batteries are an alternative).  History  In 1958, Minolta's first SLR camera was released, the Minolta SR-2, which employed a semi-automatic diaphragm and an instant return mirror. A year later, in 1959, the Minolta SR-1 was released. Basically a stripped down Minolta SR-2 with shutter speeds reduced to 1/500 of a second rather than the SR-2's 1/1000 of a second. Next came the Minolta SR-3. The camera had an ability to mount a selenium meter, which was then linked to the shutter speed. This particular camera was released in 1960, two years before the release of the SR-7. The Minolta SR-7 stayed in production from 1962 to 1966, with minor changes in its mechanism and overall construction. Specifically, in the early versions, the meter had no switch to turn itself off, so the owner had to close its leather ever ready case to prevent it from draining batteries. A year later, this was rectified and a switch was added. Mirror lock up function was also improved. In 1965 other changes were made to the camera - it was now squarer than previously, and the viewfinder was slightly changed, with the introduction of the Anglefinder and the Viewfinder Magnifier V. In late 1966, the SR-T series was introduced. These cameras had through-the-lens metering (TTL) metering, which Minolta called the Contrast Light Compensator (CLC).

The work was premiered by the Finnish Radio Symphony Orchestra under the conductor Sakari Oramo on 20 April 2005 at Finlandia Hall. Composition Barlinnie Nine has a duration of roughly 11 and half minutes and is composed in one continuous movement. The work has a subtitle A Tribute to Duncan Ferguson. Räihälä has described the work as a symphonic poem, and as a \\"musical portrait\\" of the Scottish footballer Duncan Ferguson. =Instrumentation= The work is scored for three flutes (doubling piccolo and tin whistles), three oboes (doubling cor anglais), three clarinets (doubling bass clarinet), three bassoons (doubling contrabassoon), four French horns, three trumpets, three trombones, tuba, timpani, two percussionists, harp, and strings.http://composers.musicfinland.fi/musicfinland/nuotisto.nsf/0/66E56DB327FB9C4FC225687E002BA671?opendocument =The title= According to Räihälä, the title refers to HMP Barlinnie, where Ferguson served his prison sentence in 1995, and to Ferguson's shirt number in Everton.Alan Pattullo: In Search of Duncan Ferguson.

P. 297 The Ferguson goal co-incidence In the same evening when Barlinnie Nine was premiered in Helsinki, Duncan Ferguson returned to the Everton side, that was chasing a spot in the Champions League, for a game versus Manchester United. Ferguson had been out of the side for most of the season, but headed the only goal of the game, giving Everton their first win over Manchester United for ten years. As it happens, the previous victory was also at Goodison Park, and even then Ferguson was the scorer of the only goal of the game, a header at the same end of the pitch. However, at this time Räihälä, a lifelong Everton supporter, had stopped following football, and was unaware of the game.Alan Pattullo: In Search of Duncan Ferguson.

It was opened in June 1969 and is located in Norderstedt, Germany, in the borough of Garstedt, which was an independent municipality to the end of 1969. History Construction works for the station began in 1967, and it was opened in June 1969, after U-Bahn tracks of the Langenhorn railway had been extended to Garstedt. This was done in accordance with an agreement between the cities of Hamburg and the former Garstedt municipality. Hamburg consented to expand the railway line to Garstedt, after it was allowed to expand the runway of Hamburg Airport onto Garstedt territory. The Alster Northern Railway (Alsternordbahn, ANB), which serviced the line to its southern terminus Ochsenzoll before, was shortened, first to former station of Birkenweg, later to a newly constructed at-grade station at Garstedt. The train service at Garstedt U-Bahn station started on one track, the second was completed on 14 December 1969. The station was originally planned in a terrain cutting, but the city decided to build the shopping mall of Herold Center over the station, which was completed in 1970. In the 2000s the entrance was re-built, the station square was partly roofed with a glas construction including new shopping arcades. At the beginning there was only a crossover for the trains south of the station. A storage siding in the north was added, as the line was extended to Norderstedt Mitte station in the 1990s. This completed in 1996, the ANB station in Garstedt was closed and dismantled. Station layout Garstedt is an underground station with an island platform and two tracks. The station is fully accessible for handicapped persons, as there is a lift. There are parking facilities at Herold Center shopping mall and some bicycle facilities.

Early life Edward Roy Kent was born in Grenada on 1 October 1920 and he grew up on the family estate at Morne Fendue in Saint Patrick Parish, Grenada. In 1928 his father purchased estates on Carriacou at Craigston, Mt Pleasant and Limlair. The family would often holiday at Craigston and as a result Kent developed a lasting fondness for Carriacou. At the age of 12 he was sent to England as a boarder at Bedford Modern School; for the next seven years he only returned to the Caribbean on one occasion.School of the Black and Red, by Andrew Underwood (1981); updated (2010) At the end of his schooldays he was returning to Carriacou when he was informed that Britain and Germany were at war. Kent, who was blind in one eye, was unable to fight. Career Kent's original intention had been to study law but the outbreak of World War II and the fact that he was unable to fight meant that he entered the family business, initially looking after the estate at Craigston in Carriacou. In the early 1950s, Kent moved back to Grenada where he managed several estates and was elected President of the Grenada Agriculturalists’ Union. In 1957, Kent moved to Saint Lucia where he managed the Dennery Factory Company for the next eleven years, including the manufacture of rum. The People's Revolutionary Government took control in Grenada and Carriacou between 1979 and 1983. In 1981 Kent was asked to become project manager of St. Lucia Model Farms, ‘a successful land-settlement scheme’. Following the fall of the People's Revolutionary Government, Kent returned to Carriacou in 1985 and as a result of the failure of the lime industry there, he concentrated his estate management skills on livestock breeding and real estate development.

The company advertised their technique of aging their beer in \\"natural rock caves.\\" These caves were dug into a hill behind its headquarters under the brewery in the Bronx. The Ebling Brewing Company suffered under the laws of Prohibition. In 1925 it was required to padlock its doors for four months and pay a $250,000 fine after it was found to have two truckloads of beer that had higher than the legal alcohol content, i.e.: they were found to be possessing \\"real beer.\\" The 72-year old president of the company at the time was William Ebling. The company finally closed its doors for good in the 1940s. The Ebling Brewing Company headquarters were razed and a parking lot was created over the site. The caves, sometimes as large as 20' x 100', were covered and forgotten by most people. In 2009, a developer, The Joy Construction Corporation, uncovered the caves as they began building a 600-unit low- and moderate-income housing on the site. There was much mystery surrounding the purpose of the network of caves under the site. Purposes considered included the Underground Railroad and bomb raid shelters. The president of Joy Construction, Amnon Shalhov, and Carly Sullivan, a spokeswoman for the Department of Buildings, said they said knew before construction began that the caves existed. Employees of the Joy Construction Corporation hoped to find buried beer memorabilia treasure. Unfortunately, none, other than the empty caves were found.

The film stars Charlize Theron, Mackenzie Davis, Mark Duplass, and Ron Livingston, and follows the friendship between a mother of three and her nanny. It is the fourth collaboration between Reitman and Cody, following Juno (2007), Jennifer's Body (2009), and Young Adult (2011), the last of which also starred Theron. The film premiered at the 2018 Sundance Film Festival, and was released in the United States on May 4, 2018, by Focus Features. It received mostly positive reviews from critics, praising Theron and Davis's performances and the film's portrayal of parenthood, and at the 76th Golden Globe Awards and at the 24th Critics' Choice Awards, Theron was nominated for Best Actress – Motion Picture Musical or Comedy and Best Actress in a Comedy Movie, respectively. Plot Marlo, a mother of two, is pregnant with an unplanned third child. Jonah, her son, has a developmental disorder that doctors have been unable to diagnose; she uses the Wilbarger Protocol to brush his skin in an attempt to reduce his sensitivity. When Marlo and her husband Drew visit her wealthy brother Craig's house for dinner, he offers to pay for a night nanny as a baby shower gift, but Marlo rebuffs him. Marlo gives birth to a daughter she names Mia, and quickly becomes overwhelmed and exhausted. After Jonah's principal recommends that he be placed in a different school, Marlo breaks down, and she retrieves the contact information for the night nanny. That night, Tully, the night nanny, arrives at the house. Despite an initial awkwardness, Marlo and Tully develop a close friendship over the course of several nights. Tully proves to be an exceptional nanny, cleaning the house and baking cupcakes for Jonah's class. When Marlo mentions that Drew has a fetish for women in 1950s diner waitress uniforms, Tully puts on a uniform that Marlo had previously purchased and they engage in a threesome with Drew. One night, Tully arrives to work visibly distressed, and says that she has had a fight with her roommate due to her roommate's anger over Tully bringing home too many hook-ups. Tully impulsively suggests going into the city for a drink, to which Marlo reluctantly agrees, and the pair drive to Marlo's old neighborhood in Bushwick, Brooklyn. While at a bar, Tully suddenly tells Marlo that she can no longer work for her, explaining that she was there only to \\"bridge a gap\\" and that she feels that she is no longer needed. While driving home, Marlo falls asleep at the wheel, and swerves the car into a river. Marlo sees herself trapped underwater, and envisions Tully as a mermaid coming to rescue her. She awakens at a hospital with Drew. A staff psychiatrist approaches Drew and informs him that Marlo was suffering from extreme sleep deprivation and exhaustion. When the doctor asks about their nanny, Drew tells her that he does not know much about her. A hospital clerk asks Drew for Marlo's maiden name, and he provides it: \\"Tully\\". Tully does not exist; Marlo imagined her from her past self aged 26 as a means to cope with stress. Marlo is visited by Tully one last time in her hospital room, where they decide that they have to stop seeing each other, and part amicably. Marlo returns home, where Jonah tells her that she no longer needs to brush his skin. She goes to the kitchen to listen to music and prepare the kids' lunches for the next day. Drew comes in and shares the music with her as he helps her. Cast * Charlize Theron as Marlo Moreau * Mackenzie Davis as Tully * Mark Duplass as Craig Freehauf * Ron Livingston as Drew Moreau * Elaine Tan as Elyse * Asher Miles Fallica as Jonah * Lia Frankland as Sarah  Production  Filming began from September 22, 2016 to November 2, 2016 in Vancouver, British Columbia. Theron said she gained nearly 50 pounds (23 kg) for the role in a period of three and a half months, and ate around the clock to keep the weight on. It took her a year and a half to take the weight off after filming had wrapped. Release In May 2017, Focus Features acquired distribution rights to the film and set the release date for April 20, 2018; however, in March 2018, the date was pushed back to May 4. Tully was released on digital download on July 17, 2018, and on Blu-ray and DVD on July 31. Reception =Box office= Tully grossed $9.3 million in the United States and Canada, and $6.2 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $15.6 million. In the United States and Canada, Tully was released alongside Overboard and Bad Samaritan, and was projected to gross $3–4 million from 1,353 theaters in its opening weekend. It ended up debuting to $3.2 million, finishing 6th at the box office, with a lower figure than Reitman's Labor Day ($5.1 million in 2014). 87% of its audience was over the age of 25. Deadline Hollywood noted an opening of $6.5 million would have been an ideal debut for the film. It made $2.2 million in its second weekend, dropping to 8th. =Critical response= On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 87% based on 277 reviews, and an average rating of 7.59/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \\"Tully delves into the modern parenthood experience with an admirably deft blend of humor and raw honesty, brought to life by an outstanding performance by Charlize Theron.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 75 out of 100, based on 52 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". According to PostTrak, filmgoers gave the film an overall positive score of 73%, with audience members over the age of 25 giving it a 71% and those under 25 giving it an 87%. David Ehrlich of IndieWire gave the film a \\"B\\", calling it \\"funnier than Juno and almost as ruthlessly honest as Young Adult\\", and saying: \\"Tully never pulls at your heartstrings quite as hard as it might, but there’s something beautiful about the way these two women both learn to love themselves, and in a way that also makes it easier for them to love each other.\\" Writing for Rolling Stone, Peter Travers praised the performances and script, giving the film 3.5 stars out of 4 and saying, \\"When the film takes a sharp turn and veers off-course in its final third, you hold on because Davis and Theron make sure you do. Together these two dynamite actresses cut to the soulful core of a movie that turns out to be funny, touching and vital.\\" Despite the film receiving positive reviews from many critics, one group of critics criticized the film for its portrayal of postpartum mental health. In particular they took exception to the normalization and the lack of recognition of post-partum depression and/or postpartum psychosis, which they deemed careless. The New York Times' review suggests that: > Marlo very visibly sinks into postpartum depression — you can see Ms. Theron > pulling Marlo deeper and deeper inside — the movie pretends that her burden > is somehow too hidden for anyone to notice... it isolates Marlo, and once > again it is a woman who’s the problem that needs solving. Diana Spalding, the website Motherly's digital education editor, midwife, and pediatric nurse, argues that Theron's character displays behaviors more typical of postpartum psychosis, the symptoms of which include delusions, hallucinations, periods of extreme activity, anger, paranoia and trouble communicating. Along with other negative critics of the movie, Spalding had looked forward to what a film about what motherhood was truly like, and instead finds the issue of postpartum mental illness \\"unaddressed\\", and her suicidal ideation is instead normalized.

It has had various names, both official and unofficial: North West Parish Kirkyard; St David's Kirkyard; and Ramshorn and Blackfriars. The latter name tells of its link to Blackfriars Church, linking in turn to the pre-Reformation connection to the Blackfriars Monastery in Glasgow. The burial ground was used from 1719 to 1915. In the 20th century it was remodelled along the lines of the London Improvements Act, moving most stones to the perimeter to create a usable park area. Apart from some flat stones still remaining in-situ this has largely disconnected the stones to the actual spot of interment. In 1813 the body of Janet McAlister was stolen from the graveyard, being found with 4 others in College Street Medical School.https://www.theglasgowstory.com/image/?inum=TGSA03637 In 1824 the church of St David was built on its southern side, designed in a fine Gothic style by the English architect Thomas Rickman, with modifications by local architect James Cleland. The cemetery is effectively in three sections: the original cemetery; an enclosed central walled area where the old church stood; and two small walled sections flanking the new church. Unusually monuments adopt only two forms: wall monuments and flat slabs, other than a small row of small 18th-century stones upright but partly sunk into the ground, standing in a line to the north-east.

Born and raised in northern New Jersey, he moved to Philadelphia after graduating from college. After a successful career in Philadelphia real estate, he entered politics for the first time in 2015, being elected to the Philadelphia City Council. Early life and education Domb was born in 1955 in Jersey City, New Jersey, the second son of Edward Domb and Betty Schlesinger Domb. Domb's father and grandfather worked in the embroidery business. The family relocated to nearby Fort Lee, New Jersey soon after Domb's birth. Domb and his older brother, Peter, embarked on a series of odd jobs from a young age, shining shoes, shoveling snow, and mowing lawns. He graduated from Fort Lee High School in 1973 and started college at American University in Washington, D.C. Domb took evening classes there and worked full-time selling security systems for Phelps Time Lock Service in Hyattsville, Maryland. He graduated in 1977 with a marketing degree and continued to work for Phelps, being transferred to Philadelphia to manage the company's office in that city. Business career To earn extra money while managing the Phelps office, Domb earned a real estate license at Temple University. As the real estate business became more profitable, he quit the security business job and sold real estate full time, opening his own office in 1983. Domb specialized in real estate near Philadelphia's Rittenhouse Square and soon became well-known among property buyers and sellers in that neighborhood. He was elected president of the Greater Philadelphia Association of Realtors (GPAR) in 1990, the youngest president that organization had ever elected. After success in real estate sales, Domb expanded into real estate development in 1999, and worked with restaurateur Stephen Starr to develop restaurants in Philadelphia. Domb was again elected president of the GPAR in 2013, by which time he had acquired the nickname \\"Philly Condo King.\\" In his second term as GPAR president, he worked with Mayor Michael Nutter and the city government on ideas to collect delinquent property taxes and attract new residents to the city. He also worked with City Council President Darrell L. Clarke to determine the market value and ultimate disposition of some of the city's inactive school buildings. Even after entering politics, Domb remained active in the real estate business, purchasing a 19-story office building in April 2016. Political career Nutter was term-limited, meaning that the office of mayor would be open at the 2015 election. Early in that year, there were reports that Domb was considering a run for the office. A registered independent, Domb was said to be \\"testing the waters,\\" possibly as an independent or a Republican. Instead, in May of that year, Domb announced he would run as a Democrat for one of the city's seven at-large council seats. Pledging some of his vast personal wealth to the cause, Domb described his goals in office: \\"We will talk about collecting taxes from out-of-state landlords and using that money to fund our schools. New job training programs. And partnering with our universities to mentor our children.\\" In the primary election that month, Domb placed third, winning one of the five Democratic nominations. In the general election in the majority-Democratic city, Domb again placed third, earning a seat on the council. In office, Domb continued to search for solution to the city's large number of tax-delinquent properties.

Intensional definition An intensional definition gives the meaning of a term by specifying necessary and sufficient conditions for when the term should be used. In the case of nouns, this is equivalent to specifying the properties that an object needs to have in order to be counted as a referent of the term. For example, an intensional definition of the word \\"bachelor\\" is \\"unmarried man\\". This definition is valid because being an unmarried man is both a necessary condition and a sufficient condition for being a bachelor: it is necessary because one cannot be a bachelor without being an unmarried man, and it is sufficient because any unmarried man is a bachelor.Cook, Roy T. \\"Intensional Definition\\". In A Dictionary of Philosophical Logic. Edinburgh: Edinburgh University Press, 2009. 155. This is the opposite approach to the extensional definition, which defines by listing everything that falls under that definition – an extensional definition of bachelor would be a listing of all the unmarried men in the world. As becomes clear, intensional definitions are best used when something has a clearly defined set of properties, and they work well for terms that have too many referents to list in an extensional definition. It is impossible to give an extensional definition for a term with an infinite set of referents, but an intensional one can often be stated concisely – there are infinitely many even numbers, impossible to list, but the term \\"even numbers\\" can be defined easily by saying that even numbers are integer multiples of two. Definition by genus and difference, in which something is defined by first stating the broad category it belongs to and then distinguished by specific properties, is a type of intensional definition. As the name might suggest, this is the type of definition used in Linnaean taxonomy to categorize living things, but is by no means restricted to biology. Suppose one defines a miniskirt as \\"a skirt with a hemline above the knee\\". It has been assigned to a genus, or larger class of items: it is a type of skirt. Then, we've described the differentia, the specific properties that make it its own sub-type: it has a hemline above the knee. Intensional definition also applies to rules or sets of axioms that define a set by describing a procedure for generating all of its members. For example, an intensional definition of square number can be \\"any number that can be expressed as some integer multiplied by itself\\". The rule—\\"take an integer and multiply it by itself\\"—always generates members of the set of square numbers, no matter which integer one chooses, and for any square number, there is an integer that was multiplied by itself to get it. Similarly, an intensional definition of a game, such as chess, would be the rules of the game; any game played by those rules must be a game of chess, and any game properly called a game of chess must have been played by those rules. Extensional definition An extensional definition of a concept or term formulates its meaning by specifying its extension, that is, every object that falls under the definition of the concept or term in question. For example, an extensional definition of the term \\"nation of the world\\" might be given by listing all of the nations of the world, or by giving some other means of recognizing the members of the corresponding class. An explicit listing of the extension, which is only possible for finite sets and only practical for relatively small sets, is a type of enumerative definition. Extensional definitions are used when listing examples would give more applicable information than other types of definition, and where listing the members of a set tells the questioner enough about the nature of that set. This is similar to an ostensive definition, in which one or more members of a set (but not necessarily all) are pointed out as examples. The opposite approach is the intensional definition, which defines by listing properties that a thing must have in order to be part of the set captured by the definition. History The terms \\"intension\\" and \\"extension\\" were introduced by Rudolf Carnap.

Vadé\\" in Oeuvres de M. Vadé, vol. 4 (London, 1758) at Google Books.  Biography  The son of Jacques Vadé, an innkeeper, Jean-Joseph went with his father to Paris in 1725. His studies suffered from his ebullient and lively character, and he could never learn Latin, but he knew how to correct the weakness of his education by reading the best authors on his own. At twenty, he obtained the position of controller of the vingtième (income tax) in Soissons, then in Laon, where he was noted for his wit and upbeat verve. In 1743, he left Laon to go to Rouen and became secretary of the Duke of Agenois for two years. Finally, he returned to Paris where his friends helped him find a new job in the office of the vingtième. It was around that time that he became known to the public for his effortless and graceful poems. Occasionally a singer, Vadé participated in the singing society La Dominicale. He had a daughter, Marie Françoise Rose (c. 1756 – 1818), who played under the name Mademoiselle Vadé at the Comédie-Française in 1776 and 1777 and was succeeded the following year by Mademoiselle Mars. He also had an illegitimate son, who married and became the father of the mother of the poet and goguettiere (1795–1862).See Élisa Fleury's biography in De quelques ouvriers-poètes, biographies et souvenirs par Eugène Baillet, Labbé éditeur, Paris 1898, pages 72-75. He died in July 1757 at age 37, following a painful operation.  Work  = Poetry and fables = Vadé published a series of fables that, without reaching the height of La Fontaine, said very good things in a nice form with graceful and charming amorous poems. He soon became famous, but having had the misfortune to become a little too close to the anti-philosophe Fréron, Voltaire never forgave him and never missed an opportunity to taunt and heap scorn on \\"this prank Vadé\\" (as he called him in a letter sent 7 September 1774 to Marie Du Deffand). Voltaire nevertheless gave Vadé the honor of signing several of his own works under the name Vadé. = Theatre = What earned Vadé a reputation as the creator of the ' is that, in seeking by honest toil the way to live honestly, he turned to theater, for which, before composing a number of vaudevilles, parades and opéras comiques, he first tried to write serious plays. These attempts proved fruitless when Les Visites du jour de l’An, which premiered on 3 January 1749 at the Comédie-Française, was presented only once, or La Canadienne was never performed at all. Vadé then turned successfully to comedy theater at the Foire Saint-Laurent and the Foire Saint-Germain, where his parodies showed him to be a mocking spirit, but nevertheless a deep and careful observer of people. Vadé depicted characters of a healthy and robust nature, with merits and defects, without the vain ornaments or ridiculous cosmetics with which they were burdened at the time.  Critics  Sternly criticized by Grimm, La Harpe and Collé who declared the poissard style \\"below nothing,\\" Vadé had supporters and admirers, who called him the Teniers, the Callot of French poetry or the Corneille of Les Halles. However, beyond Vadé's style (his trivial expressions, risqué phrases, burlesque), behind the poissard, Vadé's characters expressed in their dialog, a moral thought, which although sometimes hidden under a somewhat rough form, did not emerge less vigorously.

A. Applegate. Inspired by the true story of Ivan the gorilla, the film stars the voices of Sam Rockwell as Ivan, alongside Angelina Jolie, Danny DeVito, Helen Mirren, Brooklynn Prince, Chaka Khan, Ron Funches, Phillipa Soo, and Mike White, with human characters portrayed by Ramón Rodríguez, Ariana Greenblatt, and Bryan Cranston. The project was first announced in 2014, and went into production two years later. The cast was assembled between October 2017 and May 2018, with filming taking place in Florida in summer 2018. Originally intended to have a theatrical release, The One and Only Ivan was digitally released on Disney+ on August 21, 2020, and received mixed-to-positive reviews from critics. Plot Ivan, a silverback western lowland gorilla, lives in the enclosure at Big Top Mall. He performs for Mack, the owner, alongside other performers; a wise and nurturing African elephant named Stella, a spoiled poodle named Snickers, a spunky chicken named Henrietta, a fire truck-riding rabbit named Murphy, a paranoid sea lion named Frankie and a loquacious parrot named Thelma. Ivan is accompanied by a stray mutt, who they later name Bob, who secretly lives in his enclosure. Mack's janitorial employee George, brings his daughter Julia who frequently interacts with Ivan. One day, Julia leaves her old crayons with Ivan who suddenly begins taking an interest in drawing with them. Julia is apparently the only one who can decipher his drawings and what they mean. The Big Top Mall begins losing business, much to Mack's concern, but becomes excited when he purchases a baby elephant named Ruby who begins to draw in a crowd. Ivan is initially hesitant over accepting Ruby, especially when she begins to pry into his personal life. When Stella, who has been caring for Ruby, suddenly becomes weaker and unable to perform, Ivan gives Ruby encouragement to embrace the crowd on her own. Afterwards, Ruby asks Ivan to tell her a story and Ivan reveals how Mack and his wife Helen adopted him when he was just a baby. As Ivan got bigger, Mack became forgiving of his animalistic behavior, but Helen left him out of frustration. Mack eventually purchased the mall and turned it into a circus. Stella asks Ivan to look after Ruby and make sure she is free before passing away. Mack begins to train Ruby for the circus, which displeases Ivan and he decides to find a way to free her. Ivan's drawings are discovered by Mack and decides to make it the next big act, but despite the publicity in the news, Ivan refuses to cooperate. At night, Ivan and Bob trick the security guard Castello and free themselves and Ruby. At Ruby's urging, Henrietta, Murphy, Frankie and Thelma are also released and the animals flee the Big Top Mall to escape to the forest on the other side of the highway. To their disappointment, the \\"forest\\" is just an intersection and they are surrounded by more city. Mack, who was alerted by Castello, manages to bring the animals back and tries to keep their escape a secret. Ruby asks Ivan to tell her another story. At Bob's urging, Ivan finally explains how he used to live in the jungle with other gorillas. Ivan, then known as Mud, loved to make drawings in the mud and play with his sister Tag who loved playing tag. Ivan was separated by his family when poachers came and he had not seen any other gorillas since. Julia sympathetically gives Ivan some finger paints and, inspired, he decides to paint a mural. The next day, visitors come in along with reporters who have heard about the possible escape and decide to film the show. Ivan's mural, a recreation of a forest and lake, is seen by the crowd who responds positively to it. Julia believes that Ivan wants to be free and informs the reporters. Soon, protesters arrive demanding the release of the animals. Mack finally gives in and decides to shut down the mall. As all the animals are taken away, Mack has one final moment with Ivan, thanking him for his time. Ivan is taken to a big gorilla enclosure where he is reunited with his kind. To his astonishment, it is situated right next to the elephant enclosure where Ruby is with her kind. Ivan assures Stella's spirit that Ruby is safe under his watch. During the credits, photos and footage of the real Ivan is shown along with a summary of his life. In a mid-credits scene, Ivan is greeted by Bob who has been adopted by Julia and George who come visit the enclosure along with Mack to check in on Ivan.

Introduced in the last chapter of the manga, she becomes the protagonist of the spin-off Naruto: The Seventh Hokage and the Scarlet Spring (2015). A young ninja in training, Sarada is the daughter of Sasuke Uchiha and Sakura Haruno. Sarada was born while her mother was accompanying her father on his travels. Her character is first explored in the film Boruto: Naruto the Movie (2015), where she has become a low-ranking ninja (Genin) from the village of Konohagakure and dreams of becoming its leader, the Hokage. Sarada also appears as a main character in Ukyō Kodachi's manga series Boruto: Naruto Next Generations (2016) and its anime adaptation, which show her interactions with her family and with her future teammates, Boruto Uzumaki and Mitsuki, along with whom she is led by Konohamaru Sarutobi. Kishimoto felt pressure when he created Sarada because he thought he lacked experience in drawing female characters. Kishimoto also wanted to convey Sarada's relationship with her parents across her spin-off manga. Critical reception to Sarada has been positive. Her interactions with Boruto and Sasuke as well as how she aims to become the Hokage based on her character arc have been praised. Concept and creation alt=A dark-haired woman smiling Masashi Kishimoto conceived Sarada Uchiha as a character who would not initially be perceived as feminine. He felt pressured when developing Sarada for the Naruto spin-off manga, Naruto: The Seventh Hokage and the Scarlet Spring (2015), as he was worried about how the franchise's primarily male audience would respond to a female lead character. Masashi Kishimoto's brother, Seishi Kishimoto, shared similar concerns. Kishimoto read several unspecified books about women's traits to select the right characteristics for Sarada's personality. In the end, he gave these characteristics instead to another character appearing in the spin-off — Chocho Akimichi. He did this because Sarada's story was dark, and he aimed to balance it with Chocho, who would help keep the story comical and entertaining for readers due to the contrast to Sarada's arc. Another aspect Kishimoto wanted to develop in the series was the bond between Sarada and her mother, Sakura Uchiha. For the finale of the Naruto spin-off, Kishimoto wanted it to end with the focus on Sarada's family. Kishimoto chose to portray Sarada as slightly dark but strong-hearted rather than cute. He imagined the character as a female version of her father, Sasuke Uchiha. He also incorporated elements from Sakura into Sarada's characterisation and had both female characters wear similar clothing. Kishimoto also said that he aimed to make Sarada cute even while wearing glasses. Sarada was originally going to have long swept hair, but Kishimoto felt it would not fit into her look as a ninja and modified her hairstyle. The author also felt the glasses would make the character look more appealing. Her ninja outfit was based on one of Sakura's from Narutos first part, but Kishimoto additionally decided to cover Sarada's arms. During the finishing touches in the making of Sarada, Kishimoto made her eyes look like Sasuke's, and her glasses were also meant to hide this resemblance. Japanese rock band Scenarioart in charge of performing the ending theme song of this story arc were given directions by Pierrot to give make song show the distant but caring relationship between Sasuke and Sarada. As a result, although the lyrics often mentions the farewells Sasuke and Sarada had, the intention was meant to make it look optimistic as they are destined to meet once again. In the Boruto film and anime series, Boruto: Naruto Next Generations (2017), Kokoro Kikuchi voices Sarada in Japanese. When the new story arc about Sarada's family was announced for Boruto: Naruto Next Generations, Kikuchi said that she expected fans to \\"feel the strength and energy of the Uchiha family\\" throughout it, despite feeling nervous about voicing Sarada; she also looked forward to the interactions between Sarada and Chocho, who have completely different personalities. In the English version, Laura Bailey plays her in the video game Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 4 (2016), and Cherami Leigh voices her in all subsequent appearances. Leigh stated that she is grateful to voice Sarada. She also said that, while it is exciting to play her, she feels a lot of pressure because of how \\"legendary\\" the series is; nonetheless, Leigh and the other Boruto English voice actors felt honoured to play the characters based on the importance of the franchise. Appearances =In Naruto= Sarada makes her first appearance in the last chapter of Naruto. She is the daughter of Sasuke and Sakura Uchiha. As the central character of Naruto: The Seventh Hokage and the Scarlet Spring, Sarada searches for her estranged father. She mistakenly feels that Sakura is not her biological mother; after noticing that Karin, a woman who used to be one of Sasuke's allies, wears similar glasses to hers, Sarada believes that she is her real mother. Excited about seeing Sasuke after many years, Sarada gains the bloodline eye technique known as the jutsu, which she has inherited from him. However, she does not have a good first impression of her father, wrongly believing he does not care about his family. When Naruto Uzumaki, the leader of Konohagakure, helps her understand that family is not a matter of blood, Sarada realises that she would love Sakura regardless of their blood relation, and she wishes to save and protect her at any cost. It is eventually shown that Sarada has inherited Sakura's natural control over chakra, and thus she is able to gather it in her fists and cause a devastating effect on a target because of her superhuman strength. At the same time, it is highlighted that Sarada has also inherited her mother's \\"Cha!\\" (しゃーんなろー! Shānnarō!) verbal tic. Sarada eventually learns from Sakura that she is her biological mother. After she confirms this, Sasuke says that Sarada's existence shows the connection between him and Sakura. Karin later explains that she was Sakura's midwife when Sasuke and Sakura were travelling together. Before leaving again, Sasuke shows Sarada how much he loves her by giving her the same gesture he once gave Sakura, the forehead poke, and promises to come home soon. Having admired Naruto and his dedication to his village, Sarada makes it her goal to become the next Hokage one day. =In Boruto= Sarada is also a supporting character in the film Boruto: Naruto the Movie (2015), where she appears as a low-ranking ninja (Genin) and forms a team with Boruto Uzumaki, Mitsuki, and their teacher Konohamaru Sarutobi. Sarada, Mitsuki and Boruto participate in the ninja examination to become mid-ranking ninjas, Chunin. After passing the first round, Sarada helps her team win the second round by breaking through a genjutsu with her Sharingan and managing to obtain the flag she has been looking for. In the third round, Sarada uses her Sharingan again but this time combines it with her naturally good chakra control, and she is able to quickly defeat her adversary, Tarui. Despite this, the team fails to pass the final exam. Once the exam is interrupted by two figures known as Momoshiki Otsutsuki and Kinshiki Otsutsuki, Sarada tries to help clear the area, and her father protects her after she is almost crushed by a falling wall. Naruto is captured by the two villains, and Boruto asks Sarada and Mitsuki to protect Konohagakure while he goes with Sasuke to save the missing Hokage. After the mission ends, Sarada asks Boruto if he wants to become the next Hokage, to which he answers that he has decided to follow Sasuke's footsteps instead and protect her once she becomes the Hokage in the future. Sarada also appears in the novelisation of the film by Ukyō Kodachi. During the making of the film Boruto: Naruto the Movie, some scenes involving Sarada's interactions with Boruto were removed because of time constraints. Nevertheless, Kishimoto's most important scene between these two was kept: Boruto motivating Sarada to become the Hokage in the future. Sarada also appears in Kodachi's manga sequel to Naruto, Boruto: Naruto Next Generations (2016). While the manga of Boruto starts with a retelling of the film, the following chapters contain new stories. Konohamaru Team is given a ninja mission, but all three members reject it when Sarada learns that Boruto is protecting somebody from an assassin and saves him along with Mitsuki. The anime adaptation shows Sarada and her friends before becoming ninjas. While being childhood friends, Sarada and Boruto do not get along well but end up becoming closer once Boruto saves Chocho during a competition between students from the ninja academy. The anime also retells the events of Sarada's spin-off manga, where she manages to bond with her father. Similarly, the Boruto: Naruto Next Generations light novels by Kodachi include Sarada's role in the anime. In a later arc, Sarada's group goes on a trip to the Mist Village but ends up trying to stop a rebellion, with Sarada defeating one of the swordsmen leading it. Following this arc, Sarada and her friends become ninjas after passing a test, and she, Boruto, and Mitsuki form the new \\"Team 7\\" under the leadership of Konohamaru. In the anime, Mitsuki disappears from the Leaf Village, prompting Sarada and her friends to search for him. Once facing Mitsuki's new allies from the Stone Village, Mitsuki interrupts the battle and takes down Boruto. Sarada is also present in an original video animation where Team Konohamaru is sent to stop an apparent thief. =In other media= Outside the manga and anime series, Sarada appears in an omake from the manga Sasuke Uchiha's Sharingan Legend (2014), where she spies Boruto's training with Sasuke. She also appears in the ending of the video game Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 4 and becomes a playable character in the updated version Road to Boruto (2017). Besides reenacting scenes from the Boruto film, Sarada also appears in the game training with her father at her request. She is also playable in the video game Naruto to Boruto: Shinobi Striker (2018). Reception Critical response to Sarada's character has been positive. In a review of the Boruto manga, Amy McNulty of Anime News Network found Sarada's role in Boruto interesting due to her dream of becoming the Hokage, to the point of enjoying her more than her mother, Sakura. Christian Chiok of Japanator agreed, stating that Sarada's dream improved her characterisation. McNulty said both Sarada and Mitsuki helped maintain a good dynamic with Boruto. Writing about her introduction in the Boruto: Naruto Next Generations anime, Sam Stewart of IGN was disappointed that Sarada did not have much screentime in her debut as her conflict with Boruto was overshadowed by most of the other students from the ninja academy. Stewart expected that Sarada and Boruto's relationship would be expanded in future since both are the children of the earlier series' protagonists. Once a Boruto episode focused on Sarada and Boruto's interactions, Stewart was happier with their relationship. He said that Sarada had \\"become a mix of both Sasuke and Naruto\\" based on her personality and dreams to the point of finding her more appealing than her friends. Stewart found Sarada's arc one of the best parts of the Boruto anime because of her realistic interactions with her father, Sasuke, which he felt were more realistic than Boruto or Sumire Kakehi's stories. Toon Zone liked the dynamic between Sarada and Boruto because both characters are different from their parents. Chris Homer of The Fandom Post also commented that Sarada is more of a \\"reserved\\" character based on her personality. Cherami Leigh's role as Sarada's English voice also represented a reason for positive responses due to how suitable she was for her. Multiple writers have commented about Sarada's relationship with Sasuke. McNulty found Sarada's characterisation an interesting contrast to Boruto's due to how both dealt with parenting issues across their arcs. While McNulty disliked the romance between Sasuke and Sakura in the original series because she felt it initially was a one-sided crush on Sakura's part, she thought Sarada's story offered insight into the bond between the two and their relationship with their daughter, which also helped develop Sarada. Chris Zimmerman of DVD Talk stated that Sarada's family issues with Sasuke fitted the main theme of the Boruto film: the misrelationship between parents and their children. Zimmerman felt that Sarada's relationship with her father paralleled Naruto's issues with his son in the film. McNulty mentioned that, while Sarada did not detest her father the way Boruto hated his, she still had more admiration for Naruto due to her dream of being the next Hokage. Christian Chiok found Sarada's character arc one of the best parts of the Naruto spin-off because she formed a bond with Sasuke. Chris Homer was also one of the reviewers who felt there was a contrast between Sarada and Boruto's arcs, stating that both of them wanted to be like each other's parents. On the other hand, Alexandria Hill of Otaku USA found Sarada's spin-off series disappointing because of her lack of interaction with her father. Before the end of Sarada's arc, McNulty thought that while Sarada still wished to confirm her parentage, seeing her parents interact and show their love for her seemed to have lowered her need for answers. McNulty also pointed out that Sarada's journey fitted the themes of identity and family often seen in the series. Ken Iikura of Anime Now praised Sarada's role in the Boruto anime. He said that cold-hearted Sasuke clearly cares deeply for Sarada and that both characters were greatly expanded in the process. Anime Now writer Sarah Nelkin agreed with McNulty, stating that Sarada expands the bond between Sasuke and Sakura, despite him being absent often because of his mission. Various types of merchandise based on Sarada's image have also been released. Theatergoers of the Boruto film were given two different types of fans, one of which used Sarada and Sasuke's images.

She grew up to marry one of Day's friends, instead, and eventually became a school manager. Inspired by Jean-Jacques Rousseau's book Emile, or On Education, Day decided to educate two girls without any frivolities, using his own concepts, after being rejected by several women, and struggling to find a wife who shared his ideology. In 1769, Day and his barrister friend, John Bicknell, chose Sidney and another girl, Lucretia, from orphanages, and falsely declared they would be indentured to Day's friend Richard Lovell Edgeworth. Day took the girls to France to begin Rousseau's methods of education in isolation. After a short time, he returned to Lichfield with only Sidney, having deemed Lucretia inappropriate for his experiment. He used unusual, eccentric, and sometimes cruel, techniques to try to increase her fortitude, such as firing blanks at her skirts, dripping hot wax on her arms, and having her wade into a lake fully dressed to test her resilience to cold water. When Sidney reached her teenage years, Day was persuaded by Edgeworth that his ideal wife experiment had failed and he should send her away, as it was inappropriate for Day to live with her unchaperoned. He then arranged for Sidney to undergo experimental vocational and residential changes—first attending a boarding school, then becoming an apprentice to a dressmaker family, and eventually being employed as Day's housekeeper. Having seen changes in Sidney, Day proposed marriage, though he soon called this off when she did not follow his strict instructions; he again sent her away, this time to a boarding house, where she later found work as a lady's companion. In 1783, Bicknell sought out Sidney and proposed marriage, telling her the truth about Day's experiment. Horrified, she confronted Day in a series of letters; he admitted the truth but refused to apologise. Sidney married Bicknell, and the couple had two children before his death in 1787. Sidney went on to work with schoolmaster Charles Burney, managing his schools. In 1804, Anna Seward published a book about Sidney's upbringing. Edgeworth followed up with his memoirs, in which he claimed Sidney loved Day. Sidney herself, on the other hand, said she was miserable with Day and that he treated her as a slave.  Early life  The now-demolished Foundling Hospital, where Sidney was abandoned Sidney was born in 1757 in Clerkenwell, London, and was left at the Hospital for the Maintenance and Education of Exposed and Deserted Young Children (more commonly known as the Foundling Hospital) in London on 24 May 1757 by an anonymous individual. This person left a note explaining that the baby's baptismal name was Manima Butler and that she had been baptised in St James's Church, Clerkenwell. Her name was likely a misspelling of Monimia but there were no baptismal records for any spelling of the name at the parish. One of the requirements of the Foundling Hospital was that babies were to be less than six months old at the time of admittance, but the hospital did not keep more accurate records of age. Another requirement was that foundlings were given a new name and a reference number, so Sidney became Girl Ann Kingston no. 4759. She was taken in by a wet nurse, Mary Penfold, who brought her to Wotton, Surrey, where she remained until 1759, when she was two years old. Although it was usual for foundlings to remain with their wet nurse until the age of five or six, the Foundling Hospital had received an influx of new babies and moved many children who no longer required nursing, including Sidney, to the Shrewsbury branch of the Foundling Hospital. The Shrewsbury building was not completed until 1765, so in the meantime Sidney and another foundling were cared for by a nurse, Ann Casewell, at her home.  Day's experiment  = Background = Thomas Day in 1770 Thomas Day was a bachelor who had inherited his fortune from his father when he was an infant. Described as having a face pockmarked from smallpox, a brooding personality, and a short temper, Day attended Corpus Christi College, Oxford, to study philosophy. It was there that he decided to dedicate his life to becoming a virtuous man, shunning luxury and focusing on altruism. Around the same time he developed a list of requirements for his future wife, that she should be subservient and pure but also able to discuss philosophy and live without frivolities. These high standards, combined with his generally unlikeable personality, meant that his advances were rejected by several women while he was at university. Day was introduced to the work of Jean-Jacques Rousseau by his friend Richard Lovell Edgeworth; the pair shared a particular affinity for Rousseau's work on education in the book Emile, or On Education. On leaving Oxford, Edgeworth and Day attempted to teach Edgeworth's first son, Dick, in the style of Emile, a learning-by-doing approach. Accompanying Edgeworth to Ireland as Dick's tutor, Day fell in love and was spurned first by Edgeworth's sister, and then by at least three other women in quick succession. Day came to the conclusion that he would not be able to find a wife who would meet his high standards and largely blamed women's education for this. Inspired by the character of Sophie in Rousseau's Emile, he resolved to \\"create\\" his ideal wife by raising her from adolescence, using the techniques laid out in the book. Day was approaching financial independence, when he would have full access to the money left to him, and conspired with his barrister friend, John Bicknell, to find two girls who could be taken into his care to be groomed as a perfect wife. = Choosing the girls = Shrewsbury Orphan Hospital, which now forms part of Shrewsbury School Just after Day's 21st birthday in June 1769, he and John Bicknell travelled to the Shrewsbury Orphan Hospital to choose the first girl for his experiment. Sidney was 12 years old at the time, described as \\"a clear auburn brunette, with darker eyes more glowing bloom and chestnut tresses\\". She was slender, and had long eyelashes and a pleasant voice. Day was struggling to choose a girl for the experiment, and Bicknell quickly picked her out. The pair did not tell the orphanage secretary, Samuel Magee, about the planned experiment. Instead they told him that she was to be indentured as a servant at Edgeworth's country house in Berkshire, waiving the £4 () fee they would have received for the apprenticeship. In line with the orphanage's requirements that responsibility be held by a married man, Edgeworth would be legally accountable for Sidney, despite him not being present nor even aware of the arrangement. The apprenticeship was approved by the governors of the orphanage on 30 June 1769; Day and Bicknell collected Sidney on 17 August. She was brought to lodgings in London, where she met Edgeworth for the first time. Day changed her name to Sabrina Sidney: Sabrina, the Latin name for the River Severn, which her orphanage overlooked; and Sidney after Algernon Sidney, one of Day's heroes. Day became a benefactor, and subsequently governor, of the Foundling Hospital, and on 20 September 1769 he chose another girl for his experiment, renaming her Lucretia after the Roman matron. Day had Bicknell draw up a contract to define the terms of the girls' indenture. Within one year, he would choose which girl he intended to marry, and the other would be given as an apprentice to a woman in a trade, along with a fee of £100 (). He would give a further £400 () upon the girl's marriage or if she were to start her own business. He would marry his intended bride or, if he decided not to, would gift her the sum of £500 (). Bicknell acted as guarantor for the contract. = Education in France = Day's education of Sabrina followed suggestions from Emile, or On Education. Day wished for the girls to be isolated from external influences while he educated them so, at the beginning of November 1769, he decided to move them to France. It is also possible that he did this to protect himself from the legal ramifications of his experiment, as well as societal gossip. The trio travelled over 600 miles to Avignon, renting a house in le quartier des fusteries. The girls could speak no French and Day employed no English- speaking servants, to be sure that he would be the only person to influence them. Day focussed on the girls' education, in the style of Emile. He expanded on the teaching they had received from the Foundling Hospital in reading and basic arithmetic, and also taught them how to write. He believed that the girls should be able to manage the house, so they were charged with cooking and cleaning as well as other housework. Finally, he wanted to be able to debate complex concepts with them, so he taught them rudimentary theories in physics and geography, tasking them with observing the changing of the seasons, and recording details of sunrises and sunsets. He also imparted to them Rousseau's philosophical contempt for luxury. During his stay in France, Day regularly corresponded with Edgeworth. He said that both girls were passionate about their studies, Sidney more so. Day also related anecdotes, one concerning a trip on the Rhone where the boat overturned and he rescued both girls single-handedly as neither could swim. He described an incident in which he challenged a French Army officer to a duel, even producing a set of dueling pistols, simply as a manner of engaging or encouraging conversation with his young students; the officer apologised and explained he did not mean any offence, calming the situation. Accounts by 19th-century historians suggest that Day grew impatient with the girls when they became bored with their lessons and began to squabble, and that he also spent significant time nursing them through a bout of smallpox. These accounts may have been exaggerated as both girls had been inoculated against smallpox, and their strict upbringing meant they would not have rebelled excessively. = Return to England = While in France, Day struggled over which girl to choose to take forward with the experiment. Both were beautiful; Lucretia was more cheerful, Sidney more reserved and studious. The trio returned to England in spring 1770, by which time Day had finally decided that he would carry on with Sidney's training. Edgeworth explained that each of Day's projects with Sabrina had been successful, but he had come to the conclusion that Lucretia was \\"invincibly stupid\\". Day apprenticed Lucretia to a milliner in Ludgate Hill, and took Sidney to Stowe House in Lichfield, where her training could continue. The household would have had no more than a couple of servants, leaving Sidney to maintain the four floors of the house. Her tutoring continued at the same time, with one-on-one lessons from Day on a variety of subjects. Stowe House, Day's Lichfield residence, viewed across Stowe Pool, the lake into which Sidney waded Day extended his tutoring to fortify Sidney against hardship, again based upon his interpretation of Rousseau's Emile. The book explains the concept of \\"negative education\\", protecting a person from vices rather than teaching them virtues. Day interpreted this to mean that submitting Sidney to tests of endurance would help to create a woman with hardened nerves. One example given by Rousseau was helping Emile become accustomed to explosions such as fireworks by firing pistols with small amounts of powder near him, gradually increasing the amount of powder. Day, on the other hand, fired a pistol loaded with powder directly at Sidney's petticoat, not telling her that there was no shot in it. In an attempt to increase her resistance to pain he would drop hot sealing wax on her back and arms or stick pins in her, commanding her not to cry out. He would test her ability to keep secrets by telling her that his life was in danger and she should tell no one. To increase her resistance to the cold, Day instructed Sidney to wade into Stowe Pool until the water reached her neck, then lie in the nearby meadow until her clothes and hair had dried in the sun. Finally, to test her resistance to luxury, he gave her a big box of handmade silk clothes and had her throw them on a fire. Day had limited success with these techniques. Sidney became able to endure hot wax dripped on her arm without flinching, but she did tell others of his secret techniques, and could not help screaming whenever he fired his gun at her. During their time at Stowe House, Day introduced Sidney to members of the local intellectual circle, including the priest at Lichfield Cathedral, Thomas Seward. Seward and his wife hoped that Day might be a suitor for their daughter, Anna, and Anna's writings of the time show her interest in Day. Anna was also enchanted by Sidney, who became the link between Day and the Seward family. Anna took a keen interest in Sidney's story, as her father had taken in Honora Sneyd when Sneyd's mother had died.  Moving away from Day  Anna Seward, acquaintance of Day who questioned the propriety of his relationship with Sidney By 1770, Sidney began to question Day's techniques and to complain about the chores she had to perform. In December, the propriety of Day's arrangement with Sidney was questioned by the local community, especially Anna Seward. Edgeworth joined Day for Christmas at Stowe, and convinced him that his experiment had been unsuccessful. He also persuaded Day that Sidney was too old to live with him without a chaperone. Day appeared to accept Edgeworth's point of view, as he paid for Sidney to attend Sutton Coldfield boarding school in Warwickshire early in 1771. She remained at the boarding school for three years, including weekends and holidays, with infrequent visits from Day. The school normally focused on preparing high society daughters for marriage, with subjects such as needlework and the arts. Day stipulated that she was to be taught academic subjects but should not dance or learn music. In 1774, Day visited Sidney to inform her that she would be apprenticed to the Parkinsons, a family of dressmakers, as Day believed the profession would not expose her to temptation. She was delivered to the family with the stipulation that she should work hard at chores and be denied luxuries. The Parkinsons, however, treated Sidney well, to the extent that Day later chastised them for not instilling \\"industry and frugality\\" in her. Less than a year later the Parkinsons' business went bankrupt, leaving Sidney without an apprenticeship and nowhere to live. Day arranged for her to stay with his friends, the Keir family, and implied that she could take on the role of housekeeper at his own home. Day again considered Sidney, who was now 18, a potential wife, but did not let her know of his intentions, nor that her upbringing was part of his experiment. = Broken engagement = Over the next few months, Day returned to moulding Sidney to meet his requirements for the ideal woman, choosing what she would wear, and pushing his ideas of frugality upon her. Sidney took on all the ideas willingly and Day believed he had finally created a woman who would meet all his requirements. He was so confident that he talked openly of marrying Sidney, though she was unaware of his intentions. Eventually one of Day's friends let her know that he hoped to marry her. Sidney confronted Day about the rumours and he admitted they were true, neglecting to mention that he had hoped to marry her since the day he met her. Sidney did not refuse the proposal, so Day planned the wedding while she considered it further and eventually agreed. During the preparations, Day left Sidney with friends for a few days, giving her strict instructions on what she should wear. When he returned to find her in an outfit that did not meet his requirements, he flew into a rage and Sidney fled for a few hours, so Day called off the engagement. Sidney was sent to a boarding house in Birmingham and given a stipend of £50 per annum (). Day resolved never to see her again.  Marriage  After her engagement to Day ended, Sidney spent eight years at boarding houses around Birmingham. Day met and went on to marry an heiress, Esther Milnes, in 1778. Sidney met an apothecary, Jarvis Wardley, who proposed marriage in an acrostic poem. She contacted Day for advice, and he told her in absolute terms not to marry Wardley, even writing an acrostic poem for her to use in turning him down. In 1783, she had become a lady's companion in Newport, Shropshire. It was there that she was approached by Day's friend, the man who helped choose her at the foundling hospital, John Bicknell. Bicknell was single and had spent the majority of his earnings from his law career in gambling dens. He had not paid much attention to Sidney since selecting her with Day, but proposed marriage immediately. Sidney again consulted Day on the prospective engagement. Day did not approve, claiming the age difference was too great, although Bicknell was only two years older than Day. Bicknell decided to tell Sidney the truth about the experiment, that she was hand-picked to be Day's wife from childhood, and that all of Day's actions were designed to further his goal of turning her into the ideal bride. Horrified, Sidney wrote to Day to confront him over Bicknell's statements. Day admitted the truth but refused to apologise. After a series of letters, Day gave his consent to the marriage, telling her that the letter would be his final communication with her. Final residence of Sabrina Bicknell, at 29 Gloucester Circus, Greenwich Bicknell and Sidney married on 16 April 1784 at St Philip's Cathedral, Birmingham. The same day, Day paid the £500 wedding dowry he had stipulated in the contract he had set up with Bicknell, ending his £50 () per year stipend. The couple bought a house in Shenfield and had two children, John Laurens Bicknell and Henry Edgeworth Bicknell. Bicknell carried on with his gambling habits, squandering the remaining money over the following three years. On 27 March 1787, after three years of marriage, John Bicknell died of a paralytic stroke. Sidney and her two children were now left without an income. Day sent her a new stipend of £30 per year, () which was matched by Edgeworth. Her husband's barrister friends raised £800 () for the widow and her children. Sidney found a role as housekeeper for Charles Burney, as well as general manager of his schools in Chiswick, Hammersmith, and Greenwich. It was at his Greenwich school that her own children were educated. Day's widow, Esther, continued paying Sidney's allowance after his death in 1789, and Sidney carried on her work with Burney until she was 68. By this time she was living in a four-storey house in Gloucester Circus, Greenwich, with her own servants. On 8 September 1843, Sidney died at her home of a severe asthma attack. She was buried at Kensal Green Cemetery.  Legacy  Sidney asked her friends not to discuss her past as she believed her humble beginnings, and Day's mistreatment of her, would tarnish her reputation. Anna Seward nevertheless wrote about Sidney's upbringing in her 1804 work Memoirs on the Life of Dr. Darwin. As Seward publicly identified Sidney in the book, it was criticised by the press, and Sidney's son John was very angry to learn of his mother's past. In his 1820 memoirs, Edgeworth stated his belief that Sidney and Day made a good match and that she loved him. Sidney disagreed with these accounts, saying that Day had made her miserable, and that she had effectively been a slave. Sidney's education has been compared to George Bernard Shaw's Pygmalion, which may have been inspired by her story. Strong parallels have also been drawn between Sidney's upbringing and two novels of 1871: Henry James's Watch and Ward, and Anthony Trollope's Orley Farm. The story of her life has been told in Wendy Moore's 2013 book How to Create the Perfect Wife and dramatised in the 2015 BBC Radio 4 play The Imperfect Education of Sabrina Sidney.

Built in 1886-87 for duplex telegraph inventor Joseph Barker Stearns, it is one of Mid Coast Maine's most elaborate 19th-century summer houses, exhibiting a sophisticated Queen Anne style in stone and wood. It now houses the Norumbega Inn, a bed and breakfast inn. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974. Description and history Norumbega Castle stands north of downtown Camden, on the southeast side of High Street (United States Route 1), beyond its junction with Marine Drive. It is a 2-1/2 story structure, finished in rusticated stone with brick and wooden trim. It is basically rectangular in shape, but its features are asymmetrically arranged, typical for the Queen Anne period. Its main facade has three sections. The center section rises three stories, and is topped by a stepped gable. The right section, also three stories, has a projecting section topped by a conical turret. The interior is elaborately finished, and featured the latest innovations in modern households of the period, including electric lights and steam heat. Norumbega was designed by New York City architect Arthur B. Jennings, and built a local contractor in 1886-87. It was built for Joseph Barker Stearns, a native of Weld, Maine, who made a fortune in the telegraph industry by patenting duplex telegraphy and licensing it worldwide. Jennings also designed the estate's carriage house, which is now in separate ownership, and is also listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

Religions:  Sunni Islam, Christianity } The Palestinian exodus from Kuwait took place during and after the Gulf War. There were 400,000 Palestinians in Kuwait before the Gulf War. During the Iraqi occupation of Kuwait, 200,000 Palestinians left Kuwait due to various reasons (fear of persecution, food shortages, medical care difficulties, financial shortages, fear of arrest and mistreatment at roadblocks by Iraqis). After the Gulf War of 1991, nearly 200,000 Palestinians fled Kuwait, partly due to economic burdens, regulations on residence and fear of abuse by Kuwaiti security forces. The policy which partly led to this exodus was a response to the alignment of PLO leader Yasser Arafat with Saddam Hussein. The Palestinians who fled Kuwait were mostly Jordanian citizens. Only in 2004, the political situation between Kuwaiti and Palestinian leadership improved with official apology of Mahmud Abbas on PLO support of the Iraqi invasion in 1991. In 2012, the official Palestinian embassy in Kuwait was re-opened. In 2012, 80,000 Palestinians lived in Kuwait. Background Before the Gulf War, Palestinians numbered 400,000 of Kuwait's total population of 2 million.Journal of Palestine Studies: Palestinians in Kuwait (1991) by Anne M Lesch. Palestinians arrived in Kuwait in three different phases - 1948, 1967 and 1975. In the 1980s, Palestinian Arabs constituted the bulk of labor force. Events =During Iraqi occupation= The massive exodus of Palestinians from Kuwait began with the Iraqi invasion into the country in summer 1990. The exodus included both Kuwaitis and Palestinians, who were forming a large percentage of Kuwaiti residents. Out of initial 350,000 people of Palestinian descent who resided in Kuwait in mid-1990, more than 200,000 fled Kuwait during the Iraqi occupation of Kuwait, due to harassment and intimidation by Iraqi security forces, in addition to getting fired from work by Iraqi authority figures in Kuwait. The Iraqi education ministry in Kuwait fired 3,000 Palestinians in September 1990, and the dismissals of Palestinians from other sectors continued throughout October. The Iraqis also put pressure on the PLO office in Kuwait, which had refused to organize any Palestinian demonstrations and rallies in support of Iraq. The only Palestinian demonstration in Kuwait during the Iraqi occupation was actually a pro-Kuwait demonstration, with the Palestinian inhabitants of the Hawalli district waving photos of the Emir. =March 1991 exodus= Kuwait's lack of support for Palestinians after the Gulf War was a response to the alignment of Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and the PLO with Saddam Hussein, who had earlier invaded Kuwait. On March 14, 1991, 200,000 Palestinians were still residing in Kuwait, out of initial 400,000.AFTER THE WAR: Kuwait; Palestinians in Kuwait Face Suspicion and Probable Exile - New York Times Palestinians began leaving Kuwait during one week in March 1991, following Kuwait's liberation from Iraqi occupation. During a single week in March, the Palestinian population of Kuwait had almost entirely fled the country. Kuwaitis said that Palestinians leaving the country could move to Jordan, since most Palestinians held Jordanian passports. According to the New York Times, Kuwaitis said the anger against Palestinians was such that there was little chance that those who had left during the seven-month occupation could ever return and relatively few of those remaining will be able to stay. Aftermath The Palestinians who fled Kuwait were generally Jordanian citizens. They were formally recognized as Jordanians of Palestinian origin. In 2004, Kuwait allegedly put off a planned visit by Mahmoud Abbas, then the number two PLO official after Arafat.Palestine apology to Kuwait - Telegraph Palestinian officials denied reports that this was because he would not apologize for Arafat's support for the 1990 Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. However, on December 12, 2004, Abbas, now the Palestinian leader, apologized for the PLO's support of Saddam Hussein during the invasion.Abbas apology to Kuwait over Iraq, BBC News, December 12, 2004 On the first visit to Kuwait by a top Palestinian official since the invasion by Iraq, Abbas said: \\"I say we yes, we apologize over our stand towards Kuwait.\\" In 2012, there were 80,000 Palestinians living in Kuwait.

Smith, The Magnificent Twelve: Florida's Black Junior Colleges, Winter Park, Florida, FOUR-G Publishers, 1994, , p. 228. It was one of eleven black community colleges which were founded, at the urging of the Florida Legislature, in the late 1950s and early 1960s to show that a \\"separate but equal\\" educational system for blacks existed in Florida; the Legislature wished to avoid the integration mandated by the Supreme Court's Brown v. Board of Education decision of 1954. At the time, there was no nearby college for Negroes, and the distances and lack of funding effectively closed off most local blacks from college.Smith, p. 226. Initial classes used the facilities of the adjacent Black high school, Lincoln Park Academy. In 1962, a new building added classroom facilities, faculty offices, science laboratories, an administrative unit, a fine arts building, and a student union.Smith p. 239. Leroy S. Floyd, principal of Lincoln Park Academy, was selected as president of the new institution; in contrast with some of the new presidents, he had eight months to prepare for the September, 1960 opening.Smith, p. 228. With one exception, all the initial administrators and faculty were also employed in the K-12 school system in St. Lucie County prior to the College's opening.Smith, p. 232. Offerings included a college parallel program (64 semester hours), to prepare students for transfer; adult education (preparing for GED); and technical offerings in brick masonry, carpentry, waitress training, and technical illustration.Smith, p. 235. The adult program was a part of the evening high school program prior to the College. However, when it became part of the College, enrollment quadrupled from 115 to 446.Smith, p. 231. Initial enrollment was 98 students. Peak enrollment in its final year, 1964–65, was 667 students, of which 221 were in the college parallel program.Smith, p. 234. In 1964-65 it became apparent that the black institution would soon be merged with Indian River Junior College; the College closed in 1966. It was planned that the Lincoln facility would remain a center of Indian River, but \\"local political leaders were not ready to promote integrated facilities for the college in the Black community\\".Smith, p. 241.

Career Marchant was playing non-league football for Milford United before signing for Cardiff City in 1950. He scored six goals during the 1950–51 season, including a brace and a single goal in 8–0 and 7–1 thrashings of Welsh league sides Barry Town and Bangor City in the opening rounds of the Welsh Cup and the only goal of the South Wales derby match against Swansea Town on 24 March 1951. However, he struggled to oust more established forwards such as Wilf Grant from the starting line-up. Prior to the introduction of loan deals, Cardiff had a working relationship with Torquay United to transfer players needing Football League experience to the Devon-based club in exchange for first rights on any players Cardiff wished to sign from Torquay and, the following year, Marchant was sent to the Gulls. He spent two years at Plainmoor, averaging nearly a goal every other game but left the club in 1953 and returned to non-league football with Pembroke Borough. Marwood Marchant top row 2nd to left!

The district contains a collection of well-preserved buildings, that are reflective of life in a rural 19th-century village. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. Description and history The town of Tinmouth was chartered in 1761, settled about 1770, and incorporated in 1777. It was for a few years the shire town of Rutland County. Its early economic development was from varied sources, including mills, tanneries, and iron smelting operations that took advantage of beds of iron ore. The town was bypassed by the construction of railroads in the region, and saw some economic success later in the 19th century with the advent of dairy farming. The town's small village center is reflective of these periods of development, with construction concentrated in the early and late decades of the 19th century. Tinmount Center is located near the town's geographic center, and is organized around the four-way junction of Vermont Route 140, which runs north and east, Town Road 17, which runs west, and Town Road 2 (a.k.a. Mountain View Road), which runs south. Clustered around this intersection, mainly in a north-south orientation along VT 140 and Mountain View Road, are sixteen buildings, most of which are historically significant. Notable among these is the c. 1816 Noah Sawyer House, a fine example of Federal period architecture, and the town shed, a row of stalls built about 1840 that was used to house the horses of churchgoers. One example of the town's dairying history is the c. 1880 Old Creamery.

It is located 55 km northwest of the city of Polokwane on the intersection between the R567 and Matlala roads.  Demographics  Africans of Sub-Saharan descent almost form the absolute majority of the settlement and newly arrived South Asian immigrants and people of mixed ancestry make up the remainder of the population. The South Asian migrants have managed to set up successful trading stores within a few years of their arrival. Northern Sotho is the dominant language, with Xitsonga, the unrecognised Urdu language and others forming a small minority. Christianity is the main religion of the villagers, however, the religion of Islam is growing at a rapid rate.  Infrastructure  Tibane has electricity, tarred roads, a taxi rank, a sports stadium, a small claims court and piped, running water. Some basic facilities such as clinics, however, are still to be delivered. Tibani Shopping Centre is fully operational with a number of franchises, retails and other food chain stores. http://www.rns.co.za/mall.htm?mallID=185 It will be located next to the taxi rank across Matlala Road. A housing development project called the Aganang Demarcation Project was created to provide housing and extend the settlement.http://www.sahra.org.za/6D8E98C4-D05E-4D42-B18A-5F1CD1080B35/FinalDownload/DownloadId-2192682050EA667BBA46715F7806DEB1/6D8E98C4-D05E-4D42-B18A-5F1CD1080B35/sahris/sites/default/files/heritagereports/Aganang%20Demarcation%20Project%20DVP.pdf The houses are set to be constructed east and south of the Matlala and R567 roads respectively.  Central Business District  The Central Business District of Tibane includes a wide range of services which are rare in other villages of the municipality. These include many trading stores and general dealers; a filling station; panelbeaters and mechanics, a taxi rank; a post office; a small claims court; ICT shops; brick-manufacturers; steel and iron works and others. Some more formal businesses such as funeral parlours also have offices in the location. Matlala SAPS station is a mere 2 km south of the CBD in Ga-Ramokadikadi. Almost all of the businesses are located near the road intersection.

There are no institutions of higher learning in Tibane. The majority of successful matriculants opt for the University of Limpopo's Turfloop Campus to further their studies, while others opt for universities based in Gauteng.  Sports  Football is the most popular sport in Tibane, as it is throughout the whole of Aganang. It is followed by netball which gets much of its support from girls and women. The construction of Tibane Stadium was a huge boost for sports in the village. There are two community football teams located on the side of the Matlala road. Skomboys FC and All Blacks FC are the oldest football teams aging back to the 1970s while Cool King FC was only found in the early 2000s. It has produced massive talent over the years but lack of financial support has always been a disadvantage to these young boys as they usually manage to make it to the junior professional football leagues in the country. Their careers are often short-lived as young boys are often the main breadwinners in their homes. They leave football for better-paying jobs in the city of Gauteng, Johannesburg and across the country.

Wall remains on the Richters Köpfchen Information board on the Richters Köpfchen  Location  The ruins of this hill castle lie on the hill of Fürstenberg above Höingen. It was part of the Duchy of Westphalia and was in a position of strategic importance on the border with the County of Arnsberg. The inner bailey was on an eminence known as Richters Köpfchen, the outer bailey further away on the site of the present chapel.  History  The castle is first mentioned in 1295. At that time its first castellan (Burgmann), Hermann of Fürstenberg is cited, the first record of the now flourishing family of the barons of Fürstenberg. This Herman came from the family of Binolen (Hönnetal), but later named itself after their administrative seat of Fürstenberg. The castle was involved in numerous military actions: * 1303/04 - destruction by Count Everd of the Mark in his feud against Archbishop Wigbold, * 1307/09 - Archbishop Henry rebuilt the castle. On 8 December 1309 he was in the castle and signed two documents, * 1311 - Count Engelbert II of the Mark destroyed the castle, * 1313 - Bishop Henry rebuilt the castle, * 1343/44 - the castle was finally destroyed by the counts of Arnsberg and of the Mark. Members of the family of Fürstenberg lived at that time as castellans in Werl and around 1365/70 built Waterlappe Castle, which became their family seat in 1633. When in 1368 the County of Arnsberg was transferred to the Electors of Cologne, the border castle on the Fürstenberg hill lost its significance. The town of Neheim, now in Cologne, took over the defensive function in this area against the counts of the Mark.  Site  Even today the ring-shaped, medieval ramparts of the castle may be seen in the woods on the Furstenberg. They are protected as an area monument. Two fortifications may be distinguished: :a) Oldenburg, a large rampart system in which the castle chapel is located, :b) Richters Köpfchen, lower down, a small medieval stone castle. Individual remains of the stone castle on \\"Richters Köpfchen\\" may still be seen. The chapel on the tip of the hill has been recorded since 1429.

Lin-Manuel Miranda wrote both the music and lyrics to the song. Synopsis The song recounts a meeting which occurred in 1776 between Alexander Hamilton, John Laurens, Hercules Mulligan and Marquis de Lafayette. In the song, the four young revolutionaries declare their loyalty and fealty to the newly- started revolution, and consume alcohol in a bar as they talk, toasting every now and then. They state that their liberty and freedom can never be taken from them, and that there will soon be more people joining their cause. They also confess that they are willing to die in the fight. Reprises The song has two reprises in the first act of the musical: =The Story of Tonight (Reprise)= The first reprise of the song is the twelfth song in Act One of the musical. It takes place following the wedding of Alexander Hamilton and Elizabeth Schuyler in 1780. The group from the first rendition of the song is reunited, all of them drunk from the party and jokingly singing about the consequences of his marriage. They refer to Alexander as \\"the tomcat\\", referencing a moniker given to him by Martha Washington as a result of his promiscuous nature. Mulligan states that he is \\"newly not poor\\", as he has married into the wealthy Schuyler family. Their drunken festivities are interrupted by the arrival of Aaron Burr, who had recently been promoted to the rank of lieutenant colonel. Hamilton expresses envy at Burr's command, and Burr congratulates Hamilton on his nuptials, and Laurens inquires as to Burr's own romantic status. Hamilton dismisses his friends, Burr reveals that he is unlawfully consorting with the wife of a British officer. Hamilton asks Burr why he is so hesitant, a question that leads Burr to reveal his world-view and philosophy in the next song, \\"Wait for It\\". =Tomorrow There'll Be More of Us = A second reprise of \\"The Story of Tonight\\", titled \\"Tomorrow There'll Be More of Us\\" (\\"The Laurens Interlude\\" in the Off-Broadway version), occurs in the show towards the end of Act One. Hamilton is working at home when his wife Eliza informs him that he has received a letter from South Carolina. Hamilton puts off reading the letter, believing it to be from John Laurens. However, Eliza reveals that the letter is actually from Laurens' father. At Hamilton's request, she reads the letter aloud, delivering the news of Laurens' death in the Battle of the Combahee River, and all the black soldiers that were with him had either been killed or captured and returned to their owners. This battle had occurred because the British troops in the southern territories had not yet received word that the war had ended, meaning that Laurens had died for no reason. Laurens' father laments that his son's dream of freedom for his people as well as his plans for the first \\"black battalion\\" have died with him. Hamilton suppresses his emotional reaction to the news, saying only that he has \\"so much work to do.\\" Laurens also cuts in every now and then by singing lines from \\"The Story of Tonight,\\" possibly hinting that he held onto those beliefs even as he died. The song was not included on the original Broadway cast recording. Miranda explained that it was \\"more of a scene than a song, the only scene in the [sung-through] show\\", and he wanted to reserve the impact of \\"at least one revelation\\" that could be experienced more fully onstage. Analysis The song stylistically differs from many other songs in the musical due to the absence of hip-hop elements. Elizabeth Logan wrote that the song demonstrates the \\"characters' naïveté\\" as they are consumed with dreams of glory. The song is referenced multiple times in the musical, most importantly in \\"The World Was Wide Enough\\", when, having been wounded in a duel in Weehawken, New Jersey, Hamilton's final words in his final soliloquy is \\"Raise a glass to freedom\\". Critical reception The Young Folks considered the original song to be the musical's 28th best, and its first reprise to be the 44th. Cover We the Kings, an American rock band, performed a cover version of \\"The Story of Tonight\\" in 2016. The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon taped segments in Puerto Rico when Hamilton debuted on the island with the \\"And Peggy Tour\\" cast, including a performance of \\"The Story of Tonight\\", where Jimmy Fallon joined in as a second Alexander Hamilton next to Miranda singing about The Tonight Show and ending the performance with a salsa version of Fallon's Tonight Show opening song. A mashup of the song with \\"You Will Be Found\\" from Dear Evan Hansen performed by Lin-Manuel Miranda and Ben Platt was released on March 19, 2018. It peaked at number 49 on the Billboard Hot 100.

Salvadore Cammarano wrote the Italian language libretto. Malvina di Scozia was beset by obstacles at its 1851 Naples premiere. Pacini’s collaborator, the experienced librettist Salvadore Cammarano, was mortally ill. The opera’s subject matter, depicting the sordid behavior of the nobility, aroused unwanted attention from the royal censors of the King of Naples. The composer and librettist were forced to change the action to ancient Scotland for fear of offending the King. So, unlike Lucia di Lammermoor, another opera with a Cammarano libretto, Malvina has no real connection to Scottish culture. The lead tenor quit before the opening, and the opera had to be hastily rewritten for an unconventional cast of soprano, coloratura contralto, baritone and bass. Even with these challenges, Pacini created an opera so beautiful that a throng of admirers escorted the veteran composer home by torchlight after the premiere. Described at the premiere as “a wealth of harmony and melody…imagined and felt by a great master” the opera played to full houses for two months. But without a lead tenor part, and with Pacini’s star on the wane, it was revived only twice and vanished from the repertoire after 1862. It has not been heard in over 150 years. In Brooklyn, New York in 2016, Vertical Player Repertory commissioned music editor and conductor Hans Schellevis to create a new performing edition of this intriguing opera.  Characters  Malvina, soprano - the ill-fated noblewoman who has borne two illegitimate children to Prince Arturo Prince Arturo, high baritone - successful warrior who loves Malvina King Malcolm, bass - Prince Arturo's father, King of Scotland Princess Morna, coloratura mezzo-soprano - Irish princess betrothed to Prince Arturo Wortimer, character tenor - The King’s advisor Wortimer, spurned by Malvina Edwige, soprano - Lady-in-waiting to Malvina Rodwaldo, tenor - Captain of the King’s guard  Plot  Act I: Arturo comes back from war and the King announces he is betrothed to Morna. Arturo visits his beloved Malvina, with whom he has had two illegitimate children. Wortimer plots his revenge after being rejected by Malvina. After Arturo and Malvina get married in secret, Wortimer kidnaps the children and brings them to the king. Malvina arrives at the palace begging the King to spare her children. Arturo admits he has married Malvina and the children belong to him. Morna and the King are outraged and Malvina is imprisoned. Act II: Morna visits Malvina in prison, later joined by the King where they both forgive her and the King accepts the children as his heirs. Act III: All is well in the palace until Wortimer murders the children in their sleep and flees. The King is distraught and Arturo copes with his death. Malvina is found wandering through a graveyard, having lost her senses. Arturo brings in the captured Wortimer, who admits having poisoned Malvina. Malvina dies and Arturo kills Wortimer. The plot is unusual for the fact that the two women have a whole scene together and instead of a villain, Morna proves to be compassionate and just. Arturo has an extended scene solely dealing with his feelings of grief. The ensembles are unusually colorful because of two sopranos and a tenor, the top voices are soprano, mezzo, and baritone.

Biography Born Marvel Logan, Bhante Vimalaramsi studied with Anagarika Munindra in 1977 and became a bhikkhu in Thailand in 1986 with further studies in Burma. He went to Burma in 1988 to practice intensive meditation at the famous meditation center Mahasi Yeiktha in Rangoon. Bhante Vimalaramsi is a well known meditation teacher having taught in Malaysia and the United States. He has given retreats in Europe, Asia, SE Asia, and America. He is the founder of the American Forest Tradition and the Suttavada. He uses the Majjhima Nikaya as his basis for teaching the \\"Mindfulness of Metta\\" and the Brahmaviharas that leads to the realization of Nibbana, which many of his students call Tranquil Wisdom Insight Meditation (T.W.I.M.). Bhante Vimalaramsi founded the Dhamma Sukha Meditation Center (DSMC) located in Iron County, Missouri. In 2006, for the first time in American history, a Buddhist ordination was held where an American woman (Sister Khanti-Khema) took the Samaneri (novice) vows with an American monk (Bhante Vimalaramsi) presiding, and this was done for the American Forest Tradition at the Dhamma Sukha Meditation Center. On May 17, 2011, he was conferred the title of Sasana Tilakana, by The Supreme Sangha Council of Bangladesh. It was awarded for his intense work on preserving and teaching the Buddha Dhamma in the West. = US Representative to the World Buddhist Supreme Conference = Bhante Vimalaramsi is the first American born monk who has been named as the first U.S. Representative to the World Buddhist Supreme Conference in Kobe, Japan. As part of his new position he will coordinate U.S. representation at the Summit Conference to be held in Kobe, Japan in the Spring of 2007. The goal of the summit conferences is to bring together the many traditions of Buddhism in the world, and unify them to produce a united position dedicated to working towards balance, harmony, and world peace for mankind. The Conferences are scheduled to meet every two years. Upon approval he was inaugurated into this lifetime position on November 1, 2008 in the New Royal Grand Hall of Buddhism in Japan.  Teachings  In 1995 Bhante began to study the Sutta texts more thoroughly and he practiced meditation according to the Suttas. After a three- month self-retreat in a cave in Thailand, he wrote a book on the Mindfulness of Breathing called \\"The Ānāpānasati Sutta: A Practical Guide to Mindfulness of Breathing and Tranquil Wisdom Meditation\\". Today it is estimated that more than a million copies of this book are circulated worldwide in 12 languages. The meditation is not only for sitting but also if you keep it going, it will purify and retrain your mind in daily life. His book \\"Life is Meditation; Meditation is Life\\" (2014) makes this point beautifully. Bhante Vimalaramsi teaches meditation directly from the Suttas of the Pali Canon. He considers the most workable English translation to be the work of Ven. Bhikkhu Bodhi and Ven. Nanamoli. Generally, Bhante Vimalaramsi places first emphasis on the Suttas and references the commentarial works only where they agree with the Suttas. He teaches by directly reading from the Suttas and expounding what they mean as he goes along. He follows the definitions and drills for meditation that were given by the Buddha to the original group of monks. Therefore, the meditation is taught with Samatha and Vipassana yoked together as advised by the Buddha in the texts. = T.W.I.M., Jhānas, and the Relax step = Bhante Vimalaramsi has been teaching his meditation with a different approach, which is the Relax step and Tranquil/light Jhānas. A Sutta-based interpretation of meditation has led him to teaching what he calls \\"Tranquil Wisdom Insight Meditation (T.W.I.M.)\\", a joint Samatha/Vipassanā meditation. Bhante Vimalaramsi interprets the word ‘Samādhi’ as tranquillity, which signifies the same mental characteristics as Samatha. This has been covered in a number of research papers and journals, below are the direct quotes with citations: > Bhante Vimalaramsi suggests \\"it is far more important to observe what is > happening in the mind than to sit with uncomfortable or painful sensations… > There is no magic in sitting on the floor. The magic comes from a clear, > calm mind.\\" Bhante Vimalaramsi warns against the dangers of straining or > forcing meditation, and the emotional disturbances and hardening of the mind > that may ensue. > I really got it! Whenever you try to focus your attention only on breathing > and exclude other things—sound, delusive ideas etc., you will get stuffiness > and tension in your body and mind, even if you are not aware of it. > We would suggest following the Buddha’s advice to Ven. Soṇa and returning > the approach to bring about harmony rather than stress or tension. Perhaps > much can be learned from those like Ven. Vimalaramsi who are careful to > avoid the extremes of too loose and too tight. T.W.I.M. aims to provide the > meditator with a structure within which he or she can remain alert and > aware, yet relaxed and open. = Tranquil / Light Jhānas = Bhante Vimalaramsi teaches that Jhānas have only a light absorption. One can sense things happening around one while in these states; one can even do Jhānas while doing walking meditation. He teaches mainly from the Anapanasati Sutta and the Satipatthana Sutta, and maintains that Jhāna should not be considered as ecstatic or one-pointed (Ekaggatā). Rather, it is a light, relaxed state in which various Buddhist insights are examined. = The Six-R's = When practitioners find that a distraction has taken their attention off this embodied feeling, they are instructed to use the Six-Rs. The Six-R process was developed from the earliest Buddhist texts by Bhante Vimalaramsi. 1\\\\. Recognize that a distraction has occurred. 2\\\\. Release the distraction by not continuing to think about it. 3\\\\. Relax any tension that may have arisen. 4\\\\. Re-smile. 5\\\\. Return to the embodied feeling (Object of Meditation). 6\\\\. Repeat this process as needed.

She is most known for her iconic images of children in typical street scenes throughout Lima. The first female photographer for Caretas Magazine, she published two collected volumes of works which examined solitude and intimacy. Posthumously, collections of her photography have toured in Colombia, the United States and Peru. Early life Daphne Dougall Hogg was born on 19 April 1936 in the El Tigre neighborhood of Buenos Aires, Argentina to parents who had immigrated from Scotland at the turn of the twentieth century. Her father, was Alfred McDougall, founder of the Argentine radio station Radio Excélsior. Her early years were spent in Argentina, where she received a boarding school education. At twenty-two, she left Buenos Aires and moved to New York City, where she started work in an advertising agency. The agency's biggest client was located in Cuba and when the Cuban Revolution made doing business impossible, Dougall became a flight attendant. In 1959, she met Enrique Zileri through friends who were also flight attendants, during a stop- over in Lima, Peru. After a brief courtship, they married within a year and then had five children: Drusila, Diana, Domenica, Sebastian and Marco. While she was raising her children, Dougall took photographs of her children and studied master photographers like Ansel Adams, Henri Cartier-Bresson, Robert Frank and Dorothea Lange to develop her skill. Career Zileri began working as the first female photographer at Caretas, the political magazine owned by her husband's family. In 1968, when the military government of Juan Velasco Alvarado took control of the country, Enrique was exiled to Spain and Zileri took what jobs she could find to support the family. She worked as a substitute teacher and a translator, taking bridal photographs on the side. She also assisted in multiple functions to keep the magazine running during other upheavals, when they were forced to shut down or were exiled due to their pro-Democracy stance. She strongly influenced the artistic vision of the magazine. In 1994, Zileri held an exhibit of her works at Centro Cultural General San Martín in Buenos Aires. Though she tried many times to sell her works, she found no market for her photographs. Instead, she published two books, Soliloquios (1996) and Dúos (2000), as companion pieces—one exploring solitude and the other intimate relationships. The images collected in Soliloquios were taken in Buenos Aires, SoHo, Manhattan and in Cairo, Egypt. Her photographs, often of children, depict a \\"unique sensitivity\\" to the human condition and the majority reflected the color and reality of the streets of Lima. Near the end of her career, she concentrated on portraiture. She preferred to use a Leika without zoom or flash, but in her later photography, she sometimes used a digital camera, but she felt the process was not as artistic. Zileri died on 21 October 2011 in Santiago de Surco, Lima, Peru from complications of asthma. Posthumously, exhibits of her work were held in Colombia (2011), at the Fernando de Szyszlo Art Gallery at the Peruvian Embassy in Washington, D.C.

Early life and education Phoebe was born in Adelaide, South Australia, 31 March 1879. She was the youngest daughter of Frederic Chapple and his wife Elizabeth Sarah Chapple, née Hunter (c. 1845 – 19 October 1930), who left England in 1876 to take up the position of headmaster of Prince Alfred College, a prestigious Methodist school for boys in the inner eastern suburbs of the city. Phoebe may have received her early education at home, as her name does not appear in newspapers until 1891, from when she was a conspicuously successful student at the Advanced School for Girls, a radical new institution founded by the South Australian government to prepare able girls for entry to the University of Adelaide. She matriculated in 1895 and commenced the Bachelor of Science course in 1896, and was conferred with her BSc in 1898. She went on to study Medicine, and qualified MB and BS in 1904. Between 1896 and 1908, Chapple and Edith Lavington Tite (1877–1955) were associated with Our Girls' Institute, an offshoot of the YWCA, and sister organization of Our Boys' Institute. Career She served at the Adelaide Hospital as house surgeon in 1905 then in 1906 and 1907 worked with the Sydney Medical Mission, a service founded by Dame Emma Dixson and run by women for women of the poorer areas of the city. She returned to Adelaide late in 1907 and set up in practice at 28 North Terrace, where she still had a practice in 1917. She also had some kind of arrangement with Prince Alfred College.Joyce Gibberd, 'Chapple, Phoebe (1879–1967)', Australian Dictionary of Biography, National Centre of Biography, Australian National University, http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/chapple-phoebe-5560/text9481, published first in hardcopy 1979, accessed online 19 May 2016. She entered into commercial arrangements with several Friendly Societies: the Victoria Tent of the I. O. Rechabites, and The Federal Benefit Society of South Australia; She conducted first aid courses in conjunction with the Y.W.C.A. and St. John Ambulance Brigade She was medical officer to the South Australian Refuge (from 1858 to 1903 called the South Australian Female Refuge) at \\"Norwood House\\", 48 William Street, Norwood from 1908 to 1935. Chapple did a great deal of work of a charitable nature without charge. From around 1910 she was acting as honorary surgeon, later honorary superintendent at the Salvation Army's maternity hospital in Carrington Street then that organization's McBride Maternity Hospital from 1914. Situated in Briar Avenue, Medindie, the building previously known as \\"The Briars\\" was built for G. C. Hawker and named for donor Robert J. McBride. She was to work for that hospital until 1929. For some years she gave her services to the Children's Home established at Magill by Sister Grace and the Methodist Central Mission in 1914. When her father retired as headmaster of Prince Alfred College in 1914, he purchased for her a residence at 26 The Parade, Norwood, where he and Mrs Chapple were to live out their lives. Chapple moved to 115 Kensington road, Norwood in 1929 or earlier. One or other of these homes was dubbed \\"Tintagel\\". She wished to volunteer for active service in the Great War, and as the Australian forces had no intention of employing women doctors, she sailed to England at her own expense in February 1917, intending to join the Scottish Women's Hospitals for Foreign Service which had called for 400 suitably qualified women. in company with W. Taylor and P. Bartels. She arrived in April, and was soon appointed as surgeon with the Cambridge Military Hospital at Aldershot, attending to wounded soldiers. In November 1917, she was appointed honorary Captain in the W.A.A.C. (Women's Auxiliary Army Corps), (from 1918 known as Queen Mary's Army Auxiliary Corps), which was preparing to embark for France, and she was one of the first to go. While treating wounded soldiers at the front, the W.A.A.C.'s shelter trench was bombed and machine-gunned by German aeroplanes, and many around her were killed. With apparent disregard for her own safety she attended to the wounds of her injured comrades and despatched them to nearby Abbeville. For her coolness under fire she was awarded a Military Medal, the first woman doctor to be so decorated, presented at Buckingham Palace in June 1919. The citation for the award reads: > For gallantry and devotion to duty during an enemy air raid. While the raid > was in progress Doctor Chapple attended to the needs of the wounded > regardless of her own safety. The award appears anomalous as, though a high distinction, the MM was generally awarded to \\"other ranks\\", whereas the Military Cross was the equivalent award for Officers of rank Captain and below, and is considered the higher honour. She was also promoted to Major. Was the MM awarded rather than MC because of her gender or because an honorary medical Captain does not have the status of a military Captain? She next served at Rouen and Le Havre, and at the cessation of hostilities embarked on further training in England. She returned to Adelaide on the Orsova in September 1919. She stood for election to the Robe ward of the Adelaide City Council in December 1919, as a representative of the Women's Non-Party Political Association, but was narrowly defeated by John Stace Rees. Amy Louisa Tomkinson had two years earlier stood for the same ward against the same male incumbent with a similar outcome (and both women fared much better than did Frederic Blakeney Shoobridge in 1921 against the same opponent). In December 1919, Chapple and Dr. Harold Rischbieth were appointed surgeons to the clinical department of the Adelaide Hospital. Much of her medical work was in obstetrics and gynaecology; she was on occasion called upon as expert witness in cases of death brought about as a result of abortions,Procuring a miscarriage and performing an abortion were not only criminal acts but dangerous, even when performed by skilled practitioners under conditions as sterile as possible given the need for secrecy. Newspaper reports were shrouded in circumlocutions: \\"a certain condition\\" = pregnant; \\"a certain complaint\\" = venereal disease, such as syphilis. usually from peritonitis or septicaemia. The influenza epidemic of 1931 kept her busy: she made 100 visits to the Methodist Children's home alone, all pro bono. Her last overseas trip was in March 1937, when she sailed for London in the Orion to attend the coronation as an official guest, staying with her brother Harold, and did not return until October. While in Britain, she attended the Medical Women's International Conference in Edinburgh, at which she was the accredited Australian representative, and the annual meeting of the B.M.A., held in Belfast. While away, her niece Dr. Margaret Haslam, acted as locum tenens. During World War II, she was active with the Voluntary Services Detachments. Personal life Chapple was Patroness of the British Ex- Servicewomen's Fellowship, and a member of the Adelaide Ladies' Rifle Club Her name was prominent in the \\"social pages\\" of South Australian newspapers, at the racetrack, concerts or at fashionable receptions. She travelled often, keeping in touch with interstate and overseas members of her fragmented family, and hosting them when they visited Adelaide. She maintained a lifelong friendship with fellow women doctors like Helen Mayo and her old mentor Violet Plummer. Among non-medical friends were vigneron Reg. Walker and his wife Ethel, née Russell, and was dragged into their vitriolic and highly public divorce as an innocent witness. Reginald Charles Henderson Walker and Lilian Ethel May Russell married in 1904 She died on 24 March 1967 and was cremated with a military funeral.

Description The painting's dimensions are 127 x 180 centimeters. It is in the collection of the National Gallery in Athens. Analysis It depicts the facade of the eponymous cafe, which exists today in Omonia Square in Athens. In this series, it is preceded by Cafe Neon (Day). The theme of \\"coffee shops\\" has occupied Tsarouhis repeatedly within the overall interest to study the contemporary urban landscape, not only in space but also as a social context and version of an overall lifestyle. The \\"Cafes\\" as compositions thus work for the artist as a kind of privileged case study to give the opportunity to experiment around a number of issues, which concern the painting steadily: his interest in the study of the history of art; case reports in the facades as a scenographic role during the baroque period; or the timelessness and rhythmic repetitions that can be associated with his interest in Byzantine art; the meeting of set design and direction by painting, printing of architectural elements, their geometry, and their organization in axes allow the artist to experiment with synthetic values of removal. As indicated in the literature, the joint project approach of cafe Neon (Night) with the version, also situated at the National Gallery, with the composition cafe Neon (Day) [II. 3497]: \\"The two cafes function as a diptych, because together the two, give the full picture of the Greek cafe, as mythological, emotional and social space, in two different times of the day. The visual stimulus of these two images is, respectively, sunlight and the artificial light of night, creating the building during different visual episodes.Φλώρου, Ειρήνη (1999). Γιάννης Τσαρούχης - Η ζωγραφική και η εποχή του. Αθήνα: \\"Νέα Σύνορα\\" - Α. Α. Λιβάνη, σελ. 125-129, 152-153, 155. . Tsarouhis lists Cafe Neon among his best works. The debate on this project is very interesting and the following point of view: while the cafe Neon is a clearly document work is one of the essential formalities abstract Greek art in painting, in terms of direct or indirect references incorporating the artistic values and deeper metaphysical artists such as Piet Mondrian. That Tsarouhis never abandon figuration, but really understood in depth the meaning and functions of abstract art. Once the dominance of abstract art is absolute, he chooses to study in depth the figurative painting of America. The café atmosphere reminiscent of similar scenes of Edward Hopper, targeting and achieving just the visual transcription of the experience.

Funded by the private equity house and turnaround specialists Greybull Capital, My Local was formed in 2015 to acquire Morrisons struggling chain of M Local convenience shops with a view to bringing the shops into profitability. My Local was founded and run by Mike Greene, a convenience shop veteran who was critical of how Morrisons had run the shops and boasted of his ability to turn them around, bragging that the chain would be profitable in its first year. Under Greene's leadership, sales at the My Local shops collapsed as customers defected to rivals, citing My Local's poor produce, high prices and lack of availability. Sales at My Local were significantly down on the levels achieved when the shops were run by Morrisons. As a result in February 2016, less than four months after it began trading, My Local was forced to appoint KPMG to review the options for the struggling chain and began a process of selling off a number of its few profitable sites to competitors. My Local went into administration on 29 June 2016. History =Morrisons M local= Morrisons M local, Church Street, Liverpool In September 2010, Morrisons announced that it would operate a number of smaller shops to be called M local (later Morrisons M local) in major cities such as Birmingham, Manchester, Cardiff and Bristol. These shops would have a similar format to small Tesco Express and Sainsbury's Local shops, but include a wider range of ready-to-eat hot food such as pastries, coffee, rotisserie and porridge, as well as also having a salad bar. Items would be stocked from nearby Morrisons superstores and shoppers would also be able to order foods in, including fresh meat and fish. The first Morrisons M local shop opened in Ilkley, West Yorkshire in 2011. A distribution centre in Feltham, West London was acquired to provide a distribution network to the shops in London and the South East where there are fewer superstores. Around 70 shops were opened by the end of 2013, which was boosted by the purchase of seven Jessops and 49 Blockbuster premises from administrators. On 26 February 2013, a further six HMV shops were acquired from administrators. In November 2014, Morrisons announced that six unprofitable convenience shops would close, and the roll-out of the convenience shop chain would be slowed, as a batch of 40 sites would no longer be bought. Morrisons announced the closure of a further 23 loss-making M local convenience shops in March 2015. =My Local= My Local, the Headrow, Leeds In September 2015, Morrisons announced the sale of its 140 M Local shops to Mike Greene and Greybull Capital, to be re-branded as My Local, for £25 million. Wm Morrison Supermarkets plc sold its wholly owned subsidiary Wm Morrison Convenience Stores Limited on 26 October 2015 to MLCG Limited. Nisa would supply the new chain, in a five-year, £1 billion deal, and the shops were re-branded as My Local at the same time. My Local also announced it would be re-opening 10 former M local shops that Morrisons had previously shut. Disastrous sales at My Local under Mike Greene's leadership meant that only one of the 1 closed site was re-opened under the My Local banner. In February 2016 MLCG engaged KPMG to review the options available to the company. It was decided that cost savings were required, combined with a significant uplift in revenue. In March 2016, it emerged that My Local was in talks with The Co- operative Group about a potential asset swap. My Local could purchase up to 40 former Somerfield shops, and in return, the Co-op would purchase a handful of existing My Local branches. In June 2016 it was rumoured that the owners of My Local had called in KPMG for emergency help, the plan being that KPMG would help draw up last-minute plans, which included the company going into administration. This came just nine months after the company's creation, putting 2300 jobs at risk. Morrisons announced it would look to redeploy all of its former employees affected by the collapse of My Local in its shops. From 27 June, shops began to close, with all shops closed by 1 July. Since the collapse of the My Local chain, seven shops have been sold to Blakemore Retail (Spar),http://www.conveniencestore.co.uk/news/blakemore-retail-snaps-up-seven- my-local-stores/539048.article six to the Co-operative Grouphttp://www.conveniencestore.co.uk/news/co-operative-group-acquires-six- stores-from-my-local/538628.article and six to the Southern Co-operative.

Early life Born in London but raised in Dovercourt, Essex Thomas trained as a nurse at Dovercourt and the Chelsea Hospital for Women before completing her training at the Middlesex Hospital. Thomas remained at the Middlesex after training and became a staff nurse in the operating theatre. By 1929 she had been promoted to Theatre sister, a post she held until 1938. Empire Gallantry Medal On 26 January 1934, work commenced as normal and just prior to the first operation of the day the porter was preparing the oxygen cylinders in the anaesthetic room when an explosion occurred and the oxygen from the cylinder ignited sending flames up to into the main operating theatre. The theatre was immediately evacuated due to the risk of the cylinder exploding but Thomas remained behind and went into the anaesthetic room to remove the bottle of ether stored there. She then attempted to close the valve on the oxygen cylinder and found it would close so she did so thus preventing any explosion. Later investigation concluded that the likely cause of the explosion was piece of grit in the valve which as the porter tightened the valve caused a spark. Despite what could have been a disaster, normal working was resumed within minutes of Sister Thomas's actions. The hospital board met on 31 January where the incident was discussed. The minutes of the meeting recorded: The recommendation was duly made and on 2 March 1934 notice was published in London Gazette on the immediate award of the Empire Gallantry Medal to Sister Thomas. Rather than attend an investiture ceremony at Buckingham Palace Thomas was presented with the medal by King George V during an official visit to the Middlesex Hospital at the end of March. Later career Plaque on John Astor House, Middlesex Hospital, 3 Foley Street, W1 In 1938 Sister Thomas took over responsibility for two wards but later returned to operating theatre work as Theatre Superintendent responsible for the management of all the theatres at the Middlesex Hospital as well as the nearby Soho Hospital for Women. The Empire Gallantry Medal was superseded by the George Cross and holders of the EGM exchanged their medals for the new George Cross. In February 1942 she attended Buckingham Palace to be awarded the George Cross by King George VI. After retirement Thomas retired to Chelmsford where she died in 1989 aged 84. Sister Thomas is commemorated by a blue plaque at John Astor House in London.

The boycott was prompted by the Mondelez company's decision to close its American factories and move production to Mexico. Background In 2015, Mondelez International, the parent company of Nabisco, announced that it was laying off workers at factories in Chicago and Philadelphia. Production was moved to Salinas, Mexico. Mondelez decided not to make $120 million in upgrades to their Chicago facility and announced that half of the 1200 workers at the factory would be laid off. In 2014, Mondelez generated more than $34 billion in revenue and CEO Irene Rosenfeld received $21 million a year in compensation. The pressure to cut American jobs was linked to Bill Ackman, a hedge-fund billionaire who purchased a 7.5 percent stake in Mondelez, and is believed to have pushed for cost cutting. Before announcing the closure and transfer to Mexico, Mondelez negotiated with unions and the local and federal government. Mondelez asked the worker's unions to take pay cuts to make up the $46 million difference between production in the US and Mexico. According to Mondelez, the three unions representing the workers made demands that could not be satisfied. The Chicago factory, opened in the 1950s, was previously the largest bakery in the United States and employed over 4,000 workers at its peak. The Chicago factory was considered critical to Mondelez's success because of the unique workforce and strategic midwest location. Earlier in 2015, Mondelez closed a factory in Philadelphia which was 60 years old and led to the layoff of 350 employees. Boycott The announcement of the boycott was made by elected officials in Philadelphia and union activists in Chicago. In a July 9 speech, Congressman Brendan Boyle announced the boycott with a poster of an Oreo cookie with a red circle and line through it, accompanied by the message, \\"Say no to Oreo,\\" After highlighting the American layoffs, Boyle also congratulated CEO Rosenfeld on her pay increase. In Chicago, veteran activist Marilyn Katz drew attention to the boycott by writing that she was going to stop \\"dunking\\". Fellow activists announced that they would buy similar cookies from Trader Joe's or Hydrox rather than Oreo. Others, while supporting the boycott, highlighted the importance of international solidarity. In August 2015, Presidential candidate Donald Trump announced his support for the boycott, expressing his disappointment because Mondelez was an \\"American company\\" and promising never to eat another Oreo. Competitor Hydrox moved to capitalize on the boycott by printing an American flag on their packaging. In 2016, after production had started in Mexico, the AFL-CIO encouraged the boycott and published consumer guidance to help identify which Mondelez products were made in Mexico. =Protest= Protests accompanying the boycott specifically targeted Mondelez CEO Irene Rosenfeld. As workers received layoff notices, Rosenfeld was confronted with crowds outside public appearances, led by the Bakery, Confectionery, Tobacco Workers and Grain Millers' International Union. Protestors also appeared outside Rosenfeld's suburban Chicago home.

During a major run of the fire on the afternoon and evening of 12 January, fifty-seven houses and numerous non-residential buildings were completely destroyed, and a further six houses were damaged in the suburbs of Mt. Helena, Stoneville, and Parkerville. Approximately of uncleared land and pasture—the majority on private property—were burned during the 21-day duration of the fire. None of the residential subdivisions impacted had been formally declared as being within a bushfire prone area. The cause of the fire was recorded as accidental by the Department of Fire and Emergency Services (DFES). The source of ignition was determined by both the DFES and Energy Safety to have been a fallen power pole, which ignited extremely dry vegetation at approximately 11:00 AWST (UTC+8) during a period of easterly winds gusting up to moderate gale force and temperatures in excess of . A considerable quantity of property in Stoneville was destroyed following a wind change that brought fresh breezes from the south west to the fire ground, just prior to 15:00 AWST. Background In the Mt. Helena, Parkerville, and Stoneville suburbs of Mundaring Shire there are a mixture of large properties with stands of open woodland and pastures, and standard residential blocks with trees in a close vicinity to houses. The majority of the area eventually burned was within a broad valley sloping gently upward, west to east. The fuels were typical of a Eucalypt open forest; an over-story composed primarily of jarrah (eucalyptus marginata) and marri (corymbia calophylla), with scrub, leaf litter and patches of grass constituting the fuel load in the under- story. The estimated average fuel load was 15 tonne per hectare (t/ha), with a maximum fuel load of 20 t/ha in some areas of the fire ground.

It is 25 kilometres east of Jamnagar, near the Gulf of Kutch. History During British period, Balachari belonged to the Hadiana sub-division of the Jodiya pargana under Nawanagar State. The Balachadi Estate was formerly a seaside summer resort that belonged to the rulers of Nawanagar. The estate comprises 426 acres of land. There was a campsite for Polish refugee children of World War II, built by K. S. Digvijaysinhji, Jam Saheb Maharaja of Nawanagar in 1942, near his summer resort. He gave refuge to hundreds of Polish children rescued from Soviet concentration camps. The campsite is now part of the Sainik School. The Sainik School, Balachadi is the only Sainik School of Gujarat. It was established in 1961. Etymology The sea-shore is about three-fourths of a mile to the north of the village, and there are some rocky heights, almost the only lofty ground along the southern shore of the Gulf of Kutch. It is probably to these high shores that the village owes its name namely Balachari, Lofty Village, as these bluffs are a great landmark in this part of the gulf. Other derivation for the name of this village is from Balakhadi or 'the Burying Place of the Children,' as it is said in ancient legends to be the burial ground of the children of the Yadavas. But this derivation is mostly not accepted. Places of interest It is believed that formerly the land extended far to the north of its present range and that it has encroached three or four miles to the south during the last 1000 or 1200 years. A small masonry platform on which are numerous lingas or symbols of Shiva is said to be visible on very extraordinary low tides. On the sea-coast, about three-fourths of a mile from Balachari, is a temple of Baleshvar, specially worshiped by Rabaris and Bharvads, but also reverenced by other castes. Near the temple is a pipal tree called the Moksh Piplo and said to have been there since the time of Krishna. The legend regarding the Baleshvar Mahadev is as follows : That the linga was originally covered with sand, and a herdsman's cow used always to go there and pour her milk over the spot underneath which the linga lay. The herdsman noticing this one day followed her, and the cow, fearing that she might be prevented offering her adoration to the Mahadev, galloped to the spot and her hoof struck accidentally against the ling but with such force that an impression of her hoof was left in the stone. The herdsman following dug at the spot, and found that there was a linga. Accidentally his digging instrument struck the linga and blood spurted therefrom, and the mark of the blow is still visible, as is the impression of the cow's hoof. When the herdsman returned to his village and related these marvels a temple was built over it and it was installed with much devotion. Fairs are held at the Moksh Piplo or Salvation Pipal on the thirteenth- fourteenth and last day of the dark half of the month of Shraavana. Many people come from Jamnagar, Hariana, Jodiya, and the surrounding villages to this fair, and booths are erected, and toys, sweets, and country cloth are sold therein. Economy The aloe littorals, Kunwar Pathu, abounds on the coast and its flower-stalks are gathered largely for pickling and exported. These stalks are called selran. Near the village is a large tank which however only retains its water till January or February according to the rainfall. Fish are caught at both Balachari and Sachana in stone vadas or enclosures ; the fish enter these at high tide, and when the tide recedes the water filters through the enclosure walls which are built of loose stones, and the fish are left stranded. Turtles are often caught in these enclosures. The loose stones of the walls of these enclosures are soon cemented together by oysters and are then very strong. They are semicircular in shape with the convex side facing the sea. At Sachana there is a bush vada not very far above low-water mark. Branches of Babul are firmly fixed in a low stone wall until a large hedged enclosure is completed some 600 or 800 yards in length. In this enclosure very large fish are often caught, especially rays of different kinds in which this coast abounds, sharks, sawfish, swordfish, pomfret, soles, and sometimes even the dugong. Turtles of very large size are found, and one of the species found in these seas has a large thick tail. The small pearl oyster is found on the coral reefs on the coast and also on those fringing the islands in the gulf as well as two or three other kinds of oyster.

Two species of rare ground beetles (Bembidion schueppeli and B. litorale) are found in areas having partially vegetated sandy banks. The water beetle Helophorus arvernicus is found in the muddy water margin. The ground beetle Clivina collaris is found on flatter areas of the site, together with Caviphantes saxetorum, a money spider found under stones. On higher parts of sandy banks are found Aegalia sabuleti, a small chafer and Diplocephalus protuberans, another money spider. Shingle fauna includes Bembidion monticola and B. stomoides, species of ground beetle; Fleutiauxellus maritimus, a small click beetle; Arctosa cinerea, a large wolf spider and Diplocephalus connatus, a money spider found in Britain only at this and one other north-east site. The site's damp woodland supports a number of uncommon moths including Acasis viretata, the yellow-tarred brindle; Aporophyla nigra, the black rustic; and Idaea straminata, the plain wave moth. It also supports a ground beetle, Pterostichus cristatus found only in Northumberland and Durham; and a number of rare spiders including Centromerus persimilis. Alpine penny-cress (Thlaspi alpestre) found at the site indicates heavy metal contamination of the river probably arising from mineral mines in the river's catchment area. The condition of Allen Confluence Gravels was judged to be favourable in 2010, although concern was expressed about the incidence of Himalayan balsam (Impatiens glandulifera).

Personal life  Davis was born in March, Cambridgeshire, England, the first child of Hugh Davis, a railway man, and Thelma Carter. He had a brother, architect Christopher Davis, and Richard had two sons, William and Anthony. After falling ill in Italy, he died on 2 May 2016, aged 66, at the Royal Hallamshire Hospital. He was survived by his mother. His funeral took place at St Paul's Church, Macclesfield, on 25 May 2016.  Education  Davis attended March Grammar School for boys in 1960–67. He won a scholarship to attend Downing College at the University of Cambridge in 1968, where he studied the natural sciences, focusing on theoretical physics, for his undergraduate degree. He started an MSc in radio astronomy at Jodrell Bank in 1971, graduating with a diploma in 1972, followed by a PhD, also at Jodrell Bank, on the radio polarisation of quasars, graduating in 1975.  Career  Following from his PhD, he became an academic staff member at Jodrell in 1978, and over the course of 45 years he was involved in teaching, research, technical development at Jodrell Bank. Undergraduate teaching across physics and astrophysics, as well as supervising postgraduate students. In 2011 he was made an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) for services to science. He was a member of the Royal Astronomical Society Council in 2012–2015.  Research  Davis designed electronics to use the radio-linked Mark II and Mark III telescopes as Jodrell Bank's first phase-stable radio interforemeter, over a distance of . This was used to measure radio source positions to an accuracy of 100 milliarcseconds; it also enabled longer observation times on sources than before, which led to the measurement of radio emission from Cygnus A's parent galaxy. In the late 1970s he worked on radio links for MERLIN. At the same time he worked with Bernard Lovell and Ralph Spencer on observations of red dwarf flare stars using the Lovell Telescope (then the Mark I) and the Defford telescope as an interferometer, which led to an unambiguous detection of YZ Canis Minoris at radio frequencies. He developed a 5 GHz broadband interferometer using the Lovell and Mark II telescopes, with his then-student Steve Padin, detecting radio emission from symbiotic stars and novae. He studied 3C 273 in the 1980s and 1990s. Davis was Project Scientist for MERLIN, the telescope at Cambridge, and the upgrades of the Lovell Telescope. Davis studied the cosmic microwave background with the Very Small Array and the Planck satellite. He was the UK PI of Planck's Low Frequency Instrument, leading the development and construction of the 30 and 44 GHz low-noise amplifiers, as well as leading the UK post-launch support for the instrument. He spent over 15 years working on the Planck satellite. He authored over 150 scientific publications.

The house was built on land purchased from Robert B. Patterson on what had been part of the Rose Hill Farmstead. The main house was built in 1917, and is a 2 1/2-story, five bay, Colonial Revival style brick dwelling built for Col. Eugene C. Wharf. It has a side gabled tile roof. The south facade features a two-story portico with a second story sleeping porch. Also on the property are the contributing pump house (1917), carriage house (1917), and chicken house (c. 1945). Note: This includes and Accompanying photographs. During the American Civil War it was rumored that the Knights of the Golden Circle met on the hill where the house now stands as it was, at the time, a dense forest. The property became known as Rebel Hill. Colonel Wharf was a veteran of the Spanish–American War and very patriotic. He disapproved of the name and had the name Shadowwood recorded at the county court house. When Colonel Wharf died his widow, Mrs. Stella C. Wharf, conveyed the family home to Vincennes University as a memorial in 1957. The university did use the property for several years to house female students. The house was around ten miles from the university so it was impractical for its use. At the suggestion of Judge Curtis Shake, president of the VU Board of Trustees, university president Dr. Isaac K. Beckes worked to transfer the property to The Grand Chapter of the Sigma Pi fraternity for use as its national headquarters in August 1961. The fraternity had been founded at the university in 1897. Mrs. Wharf approved of the deal. The fraternity spent $11,500 in 1962 to upgrade the building's heating, plumbing, and electricity. The carriage house was converted into a lodge where the fraternity's traveling consultants could live.I Believe. Brentwood, TN: Sigma Pi Fraternity, International, 2010. Print. The building housed the International Headquarters of Sigma Pi Fraternity from 1963 to 2003. In 2005, the fraternity sold the property to a private individual.

As of 2015, the firm employs 16 people. Life In 1979, when Holden was five years old, Holden's family was denied permission to emigrate to the United States from Soviet Ukraine; this may have resulted in persecution for attempting to leave. However, seven years later the Chernobyl nuclear disaster led to mass evacuations, allowing the family to flee to Moldova, moving next to Italy, and finally the United States. In Italy, at 14, he missed a year of school to work in a farm. Holden later attended, but did not graduate from, the University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee. At the age of 27, Holden became the chief information security officer of Robert W. Baird & Co., a Milwaukee-based financial-services company that manages more than a hundred billion dollars of assets. Hold Security came into existence in February 2013, when a small security company called Cyopsis split in two. Company Profile Holden's firm Hold Security focuses on penetration testing and auditing for companies but also offers a unique service they call Deep Web Monitoring. In this service, the firm's analysts look for client's stolen login credentials, trade secrets, and any private employee or customer information that is circulating among hackers on the deep and dark web. Notable investigations =POS Vendor Breaches= In August 2016, Holden's firm discovers evidence leading to breach of Oracle's MICROS POS along with a number of other victims. Discovery details the indicators of compromise of MICROS and other victims and potential data that could have been stolen from them. =2016 Alleged Email Credentials Cache = In 2016, Holden claimed to have uncovered a major cache of 272 million unique email addresses along with the passwords to their webmail accounts. Holden's news release was criticized when subsequent investigation by the webmail providers showed that almost none of the passwords were valid. =97 Dating Websites Breached= During the summer of 2015, Russian hackers breached 97 websites mostly made up of dating sites. Ashely Madison, the most prominent of these sites, had sensitive company information, emails, internal documents, and details of 30 million users stolen in this breach. Holden's firm were the ones who discovered the stolen information which they found on a server the hackers were using. =JP Morgan Breach= In the summer of 2014, JPMorgan Chase was attacked by a gang of Russian hackers who stole information compromising 76 million households and seven million small businesses. Holden and his firm were crucial in helping discover this intrusion uncovering a billion of passwords and usernames that the gang had stolen. =2014 Russian Hackers= In 2014, Holden and his firm discovered that a group of Russian hackers possessed 542 million stolen email addresses with 1.2 billion email-and-password combinations, the largest cache of stolen credentials discovered to date. Hold Security did not publicly name the victims, but at the request of The New York Times, an independent expert confirmed for the Times that the cache was authentic. =CorporateCarOnline Breach= In November 2013, Holden's firm discovered that the limousine software-as-a-service company Corporatecaronline had been hacked exposing credit card and personal information of nearly 1 million customers. Some of these customers include politicians, star athletes, and corporate executives. But, there were no indications that any of the information the hackers stole was abused in any way afterwards. =PR Newswire Breach= In October 2013, the same hackers that breached Adobe earlier that year did the same to PR Newswire. This group of hackers stole the usernames and encrypted passwords of the marketing and press release distribution service's customers. Holden and his firm were vital in the discover of this breach and the analysis of the stolen data from PR Newswire. =Adobe Systems Breach= Holden worked with cybersecurity journalist Brian Krebs to alert Adobe of the 2013 Adobe data breach, a theft of 2.9 million customer accounts and of the source code to some of Adobe's products. Adobe Systems publicly acknowledge the breach thanking Holden and Krebs for incident discovery. =Lexis Nexis, Dun & Bradstreet, HireRight/Kroll, and NW3C Breach= In 2013, popular data brokers like Lexis Nexis and the non-profit organization National White Collar Crime Center (NW3C) were compromised when operations of the underground criminal identity theft service was discovered. Hackers compromised systems within Lexis Nexis, Dun & Bradstreet, HireRight/Kroll, and NW3C stealing data and information. Holden and his firm were instrumental in discovering and analyzing the attack servers and breaches. Credibility Issues There has been evidence to suggest that Alex Holden has inflated figures, combined breaches, and invented hacker groups in order to obtain press and speaking positions. This has been pointed out as early as the alleged 2014 breaches. He has at various times claimed to possess degrees that he did not possess, attend schools he did not attend, and have been employed by employers who never contracted/employed him.

It features 12th-century vaulted wine cellars, collections dedicated to wine-growing and local crafts as well as a medieval garden.  Site history  In the 12th century, Earl of Dreux Robert the First asked the Cistercian monks of Le Breuil-Benoît Abbey (located in Marcilly-sur- Eure) to found a Conventual priory in Dreux at the foot of his castle (situated where the current day Chapelle royale is) in order to grow wine. In the Middle Ages, 250 hectares were dedicated to wine-growing in Dreux and 7,249 in the county (department) of Eure-et-Loir (currently less than a hectare). The Earl of Dreux owned six grape presses, one of which operated at the priory. In the 12th century, a harbour was built on the Blaise river: ships used the (connecting) Eure river to transport wine and other goods to Rouen, Paris or England. The monks dug rib-vaulted cellars into the flint and chalky marl; they were reinforced with double arches based on stone corbels. They used special pickaxes whose notches can still be seen. The cellars were used to store tithe wine, and had side chambers which inhabitants used to take shelter in case of attack. Dreux was a stop-over on the way to Compostela: rolled maps deposited/put in the holes of the vaults' arch supports were available to the pilgrims. Some pilgrims would take small pieces of rock from the walls as a souvenir of their stay. One of the cellars seems to have been dug into the chalky cliff to house the press. The monks collected the tithe on wine-growing products until the French Revolution. In 1791, the priory was sold as a bien national (national property) and transformed into a rural inn. The chapel was razed in 1852. The ecomuseum set up a vineyard again in 1989 and organises a grape-harvest celebration in October.  Museum  Boat in courtyard of Dreux Wine-growers and Craftsmen Ecomuseum In the courtyard, a life-size reproduction of a 13th-century flat-bottomed boat was built by volunteers. This kind of boat could be towed when the river wasn't deep enough. The door of the king's tax collector's house (set on fire by wine- growers in 1789) can also be seen, as well as a cask, a cart and presses. An outbuilding has a display of a 19th-century habitat with a stable, a bakery, a laundry room and two living areas. Various collections can be seen inside. The ground floor section is dedicated to wine-growing tools and to vineyard work. The stained-glass windows that are exhibited here reproduce those of Chartres Cathedral, which represent, among other occupations, those of wine traders, coopers and wine-growers. A 17th-century wood and plaster statue called \\"Our Lady of the Bunch\\" can be seen. The first bunch of grapes was set in its hand for luck. Initially placed in a street of the town, it was sold to a Parisian second-hand goods dealer. Flora Gallica bought it thanks to a contribution. On the first floor, ancient bathroom linen and toiletries (curling iron, laces), wine watercolours and clockmaker tools are displayed. The \\"craftsmen's attic\\" houses various spaces showing the traditional trades and their tools (clog maker, saddler, blacksmith, potter etc.) Another room houses a restored apothecary.  Medieval garden  In the Middle Ages, the Saint-Thibault priory owned a garden cultivated according to Hildegard of Bingen's rules. The ecomuseum has recreated a medieval garden on a plot on the hill with ancient plants which had been used for aromatic, textile and medicinal purposes.

Life Ricketts was a survivor of the Battle of Nsamankow in 1824, where Sir Charles MacCarthy was defeated. He was Governor of the Gold Coast 15 November 1826 – 11 October 1827, and 5 June 1828 – 25 June 1828. This was the period of the First Anglo-Ashanti War, which took place in the years 1824 to 1831. Ricketts describes the circumstances of his first appointment in his account of that war. Charles Turner, the previous Governor, had died in March 1826. Sir Neil Campbell had been appointed Governor of Sierra Leone, where he arrived in August. He sailed on in HMS Lively, and arrived in September on the Gold Coast. A battle had been fought at Dodowa Forest. Campbell disembarked at Cape Coast Castle, and gave Edward Purdon, who had earlier served as Governor and was acting in the post, leave to return to the United Kingdom. He named Ricketts, then an army Captain, as the new Governor. Promoted Major, Ricketts was ordered to sail to Sierra Leone in January 1828. He was required to return to the Gold Coast in June of that year, to oversee the hand-over of forts to merchants, and to evacuate the garrison. These moves were part of Dixon Denham's efforts to obtain peace with the Ashanti Empire. Ricketts was then Governor of Sierra Leone 1829–1830. In poor health, he returned to the United Kingdom. Ricketts, Sierra Leone, one of the Banana Islands, is named after him. In 1831 Ricketts transferred from the Royal African Corps to the 58th Regiment of Foot. He died at the Cape of Good Hope in 1838, on a journey from Ceylon.

YedZ homologues exhibit conserved histidyl residues in their transmembrane domains that may function in heme binding. Some of the homologues encoded in the genomes of various bacteria have YedZ domains fused to transport, electron transfer and biogenesis proteins. One of the animal homologues is the 6 TMS epithelial plasma membrane antigen of the prostate (STAMP1) that is over-expressed in prostate cancer. Some animal homologues have YedZ domains fused C-terminal to homologues of NADP oxidoreductases. YedZ homologues arose by intragenic triplication of a 2 TMS-encoding element. They exhibit statistically significant sequence similarity to two families of putative heme export systems and one family of cytochrome-containing electron carriers and have biogenesis. YedZ homologues can function as heme-binding proteins that facilitate or regulate oxidoreduction, transmembrane electron flow and transport. Homologues of YedZ are found in a variety of bacteria, including magnetotactic bacteria and cyanobacteria where YedZ domains are fused C-terminal to magnetosome transporters of the MFS superfamily (TC# 2.A.1) and to electron carriers of the DsbD family (TC# 5.A.1), respectively. YedZ homologues are found in animals where one includes a human 6 TMS epithelial plasma membrane antigen that is expressed at high levels in prostate cancer cells. Even more distant homologues may include the transmembrane domain within members of the gp91phoxNADPH oxidase associated cytochrome b558 (CytB) family (TC #5.B.2). Heme-containing transmembrane ferric reductase domains (FRD) are found in both bacterial and eukaryotic proteins including ferric reductases (FRE), and NADPH oxidases (NOX). Bacteria contain FRD proteins consisting only of a ferric reductase domain, such as YedZ and short FRE proteins. Full length FRE and NOX enzymes are mostly found in eukaryotes and possess a dehydrogenase domain, allowing them to catalyze electron transfer from cytosolic NADPH to extracellular metal ions (FRE) or oxygen (NOX). Metazoa possess YedZ-related STEAP proteins. Phylogenetic analyses suggests that FRE enzymes appeared early in evolution, followed by a transition towards EF-hand containing NOX enzymes (NOX5- and DUOX-like). NOX enzymes are distinguished from FRE enzymes through a four amino acid motif spanning from transmembrane domain 3 (TM3) to TM4, and YedZ/STEAP proteins are identified by the replacement of the first canonical heme-spanning histidine by a highly conserved arginine. Six-transmembrane epithelial antigen of the prostate 3 (Steap3) is the major ferric reductase in developing erythrocytes. Steap family proteins are defined by a shared transmembrane domain that in Steap3 has been shown to function as a transmembrane electron shuttle, moving cytoplasmic electrons derived from NADPH across the lipid bilayer to the extracellular face where they are used to reduce Fe3+ to Fe2+ and potentially Cu2+ to Cu1+. High affinity FAD and iron binding sites and a single b-type heme binding site is present in the Steap3 transmembrane domain. Steap3 is functional as a homodimer and utilizes an intrasubunit electron transfer pathway through the single heme moiety rather than an intersubunit electron pathway through a potential domain-swapped dimer. The sequence motifs in the transmembrane domain that are associated with the FAD and metal binding sites are not only present in Steap2 and Steap4 but also in Steap1 which lacks the N-terminal oxidoreductase domain, suggesting that Steap1 harbors latent oxidoreductase activity.

The first formal member of this family was Henry I the Bald, who took his seat in Harsefeld, part of the Duchy of Franconia, where he built a castle in 965. He was the grandson of the first Count of Stade, Lothar I, who was killed by the Great Heathen Army in the Battle of Ebstorf, and was recognized as one of the Martyrs of Ebsdorf by the Catholic Church. Henry's grandson Lothair Udo I was Margrave of Nordmark in 1056. Because of the Slav uprising of 983, the Northern March in 1056 was limited to today's Altmark, west of the Middle Elbe. After the Slavs were expelled and the march included the Lower Elbe, it was known as comitatus marchionis Udonis (the County of Margrave Udo). In the 1060s Emperor Henry IV looked to enlarge the empire's boundaries and that included the County of Stade. The Udonen settled this in the emperor's favor by agreeing to buy the county from the Archbishopric of Bremen, and ruled as vassals to the emperor as imperial princes. This continued until the deaths or deposition of brothers Udo IV, Rudolf II and Hartwig, which ended the male line of Udonids. Albert the Bear, Duke of Saxony, assumed power over the Margraviate of the Northern March while his successor ad duke, Henry the Lion, ruled the County of Stade from 1145 until forced out by Emperor Frederick Barbarossa. The County of Stade then came under the direct control of the Archbishops of Bremen, whereas Nordmark transitioned to the Margraviate of Brandenburg. The most reliable of the histories of the family is provided by Thietmar of Merseburg, son of Kunigunde von Stade, Henry's daughter, and her husband Siegfried I the Older, Count of Walbeck. Thietmar had two great-grandfathers, Lothar I of Walbeck and Lothar II of Stade, who died in the Battle of Lenzen in 929. The earliest mention of the Udonoids is in the annotations of a commemorative edition of the Ragyndrudis Codex associated with Saint Boniface. The latter annotations of the codex recount a Count Henry of Kahle and his son Henry II the Good. The account mentions Henry's second wife Hildegarde and their daughter Hildegarde who married into the Billung family, in particular Bernard I, Duke of Saxony. Thietmar claims that his grandfather Henry was related to Emperor Otto I, although this relationship has not been proven. The history of the family is clouded in the years after the death of Lothar at the Battle of Lenzen in 929, with the presence of Wichmann the Elder and his sons, but their criminal behavior soon resulted in the return of the Udonids. With the exception of the nondynastic Frederich, the family ruled the county and margraviate until the mid-12th century.

Joining the Bury firm of Peel, Yates and Co. as a book-keeper at the age of twenty, he eventually became a partner and amassed a considerable fortune from its success in the textile and calico-printing businesses. Amongst his partners at the firm was the businessman and politician Sir Robert Peel, whose son, also named Sir Robert Peel, served twice as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. Norris was reputedly a regular and welcome visitor at the latter's home in Whitehall Gardens. Upon his retirement to Howick House, Penwortham, in 1821, Norris purchased one half of the Lordship of Croston, and dedicated the remainder of his life to artistic and scientific pursuits. In addition to his acquisition of a valuable collection of old master paintings and rare coins, his interest in natural history was reflected by the compilation of an extensive collection of minerals, shells and insects. He was a founder member of the Entomological Society of London (in 1833) and a Fellow of the Astronomical Society of London as early as 1825, continuing as a Fellow of its successor body, the Royal Astronomical Society, from the granting of its charter in 1831 until his death in 1852. Taxonomic honours The importance to science of Norris's cabinet of curiosities was acknowledged by leading naturalists of the day, including G.B. Sowerby I, L.A. Reeve, J.O. Westwood, J.B.L. Buquet and F.E.

Thomas Norris's connection with this family is not entirely clear, but a cadet branch of the same name was present in the neighbouring village of Tarleton by the sixteenth century, and in the early seventeenth one of their number was the first Norris known to have acquired lands in Croston.Document DDHE/11/96 at Lancashire Archives In the early nineteenth century, the Norris family of Davyhulme Hall, Urmston, claimed descent from the Norris family of Tarleton, and through them from the Norrises of Speke Hall; any such claim would apply equally well to the Norris family of Croston, to whom Thomas Norris certainly belonged.

Thomas (April 2, 1930 – June 19, 2006) was an American test pilot, who flew the Tacit Blue, and several spin tests on the F-5F program, including the first flights on both aircraft for the Northrop Corporation. Early life and education Thomas was born on April 2, 1930, in Chautauqua County, New York, to parents L. Mary Thomas (; 1905–1974), a teacher (Sherman Teachers College), and Donald A. Thomas (1901–1973). He attended Mayville Central High School and graduated in 1948, in Mayville, NY. He attended Parks College of Engineering, Aviation and Technology, at St Louis University where he joined the fraternity, Alpha Delta Gamma (Beta chapter), and majored in Aeronautical Engineering, graduating with a Bachelor of Science degree. As a graduate of ROTC, he joined the United States Air Force as a Second Lieutenant in 1952 and earned his pilot wings in 1952. After graduating from Parks College, and leaving the USAF, he worked for Beech Aircraft Company (Beechcraft Corporation) in 1956 flying all models, and served with the Kansas Air National Guard from 1956 to 1961. Then he went onto the Boeing Company in 1958, in Wichita, Kansas, where he flew the B-47 and B-52. In 1961, Boeing sent him to the U.S. Naval Test Pilot School in Patuxent River, Maryland. He then left Boeing to join Northrop, in March 1963. Test Pilot Career Thomas was a test pilot for Northrop from 1963 until he retired from flying in 1986. He stayed with the company until 2000, his official retirement, and completed his career with Northrop as a Technical Director applying his knowledge to the B-2 flight test program. He was recognized as a Pioneer of Stealth in 2000, for his involvement in the Tacit Blue program, a plane that utilized stealth technology. All of the information gained on this program was directly transferred to the B-2 program, as well as other aircraft designs. Thomas also did many spin tests on the F-5 program, including the first flight on the F-5F, at Edwards AFB, September 25, 1974; with a total of 107 spin tests to his credit. His \\"hazardous high-angle-of-attack stall and spin testing (recovery maneuver) in the F-5 established procedures now followed by fighter pilots around the world.\\" Thomas flew envelope expansion flight tests on all models of the F-5 Freedom Fighter.the integrator, Northrop Grumman (newspaper), Volume 8, No. 12, June 30, 2006, page 8 article author: Carol Ilten. He also spent time in Madrid, Spain helping the Spanish Air Force flight test the CASA C-101 and flew the aircraft in the Farnborough International Airshow in July of 1978. Thomas was involved in an ejection over Mt. Whitney on November 4, 1965. His aircraft, an F-5A, went into an irrecoverable spin, as one aileron locked in full up position, due to FOD (foreign object damage) and he was forced to eject. On impact, his helmet was cracked and he was knocked unconscious; upon revival, his automatic parachute was opened and the plane had crashed below him in a ball of fire on the northeast side of Mt. Whitney. In 1964, he was assigned to fly the T-38 with three of the original Mercury Seven Astronauts, Gordon Cooper, Deke Slayton, and Wally Schirra to maintain proficiency and stay current. He also flew the T-38 with Neil Armstrong as well as Pete Conrad, Jr. During his time as a pilot for KANG (Kansas Air National Guard), he also survived a fiery crash in the T-33. In 1956, at McConnell AFB, unable to blow the canopy or jettison the fuel tanks, due to engine malfunction and electrical failure, he and the other pilot, Pat Windsor, had to hand crank the canopy to escape the burning jet. During his flying career, Thomas accumulated 8,000 hours flying more than 116 different aircraft. Tacit Blue Thomas flew one of the most successful, high technology demonstrator programs in the history of the U.S. Air Force, Tacit Blue a top secret project that flew out of Area 51. Though originally a highly classified project; President Bill Clinton declassified some of Tacit Blue in 1996 and Thomas was then able to tell some of his story. The Tacit Blue, also known as the \\"whale,\\" applied composite material and curvilinear surfaces to deflect radar. The aircraft was unstable in pitch and yaw, and employed a fly-by-wire technology. The first flight February 5, 1982, was flown by Thomas, the only civilian test pilot on the project. He flew 70 of the 135 flights that were completed, including the 100th sortie in 1984. Four other pilots included in the program were USAF pilots. Only a single plane was built, as it was a technology demonstrator aircraft, and it is now housed in the National Museum of the U.S. Air Force, (Wright Patterson Air Force Museum) in Dayton, Ohio. Death Thomas died on June 19, 2006 after complications from Parkinson's disease. He was 76 years old. Personal life Thomas married in 1958 to Cynda Thomas (née Smith) and had three children. He moved to the Antelope Valley in 1963, to work for Northrop Grumman at Edwards Air Force Base. Honors Thomas became a member in 1964, and was elected a (Fellow) in 1981, of the Society of Experimental Test Pilots, (SETP). He was also a recipient of the Herman R. Salmon Award in 1977, awarded for best technical paper published in Cockpit Magazine (for the F-5 test program). He received the Iven C. Kincheloe Award in 1996 (for Tacit Blue retroactively, 1982). He was named a Pioneer of Stealth in 2000, for work on Tacit Blue. He was honored and named an \\"Eagle\\" in 2004, at the Gathering of Eagles – Flight Test Historical Foundation, Edwards, California. He was recognized by the Aerospace Walk of Honor in 2005, (monument located at Boeing Plaza), in the city of Lancaster, California. He also received an induction into the Nevada Aerospace Hall of Fame, in 2015 at Nellis AFB, for his work in Nevada on Tacit Blue at Area 51, including Groom Lake, and the Tonopah Test Range.

Having no musical experience, she learned how to use an EML 101 Synthesizer and began creating her own compositions. Later, she began doing her own Field recordings − bats, oil pumps, trains, parrots, frogs − which she mixed with her synthetic sounds, her own and others' voices, and solo improvisations by musicians such as violinist Aurora Manuel (\\"Piece for Oil Pump and Violin\\"); cellist Deidre Murray (\\"Dracula's Wives\\"); and accordionist Guy Klucsevek (\\"North Country\\"). In 2018 Thorington presented the project Turbulance.org(1996) at The New Art Fest in Lisbon.Information about the project at a patrimoniocultural.gov.pt, a website of the Governement of Portugal Thorington describes her approach to sound this way: \\"My focus ... has been on radiophonic space. One of the things that distinguishes the electronic media is the ability to separate sound from its source, to remove environmental sound from its location, vocal sound from a person; to be able to cut, manipulate, and alter it in the creation of another kind of work. I liken this to the science of gene manipulation. We've reduced — or, I as a practicing radio artist, reduce — sound to sound data. I am not concerned that it's music, that it's an environment, that it's voice.\\" Laskin.

He was the longest serving chairman of Thoothukudi (Tuticorin) Municipality and is considered the father and architect of Modern Tuticorin. He was elected to the chairmanship of Tuticorin municipality five times between 1909 and 1927. He was awarded the title of RAO BAHADUR by the Government and was elected to the Madras Legislative Assembly. The Municipality building (Rao Bahadur Cruz Fernandez Building) is named after him. His statues are installed in front of the Municipal Building and also in the midst of the Town Tuticorin. Drinking Water Scheme In 1873 an open channel of 6.4 km length was excavated by the Public Works Department at cost of Rs. 4,000/- for diverting the water of the Korampallam irrigation tank to a reservoir in the outskirts of the town. From this reservoir water was distributed to several wells in the town by means of conduits and earthenware pipes laid by the Municipal council at a cost of Rs. 9380/- in 1896 a comprehensive water supply scheme was recommended by the Sanitary Board. It consisted of two portions and the execution of the first portion took place in 1906 at a cost of Rs. 1,17,780/- and the second in April 1908. Later, it was found that the improvement of the Korampallam tank interfered with the irrigation interests of the ryots. But due to contamination in the drinking water, cholera and other water borne diseases occurred frequently and affected hundreds of people. In order to control these epidemic diseases, Cruz Fernandez who was the Chairman of the Municipality during 1909, 1910, 1912, 1919 and 1925 introduced a novel scheme. it was a joint water supply scheme for the three towns namely Tuticorin, Tirunelveli and Palayamkottai from the Thamirabarani River near Vallanadu which is 38 km from Tuticorin at a cost of Rs. 18,23,275/- in 1932. Both these Municipalities and the public works departments plunged in action during 1914 to 1915. but the break of World War I affected its further progress and the work was kept in abeyance. In 1925 and 1926 the expenses of the project was escalated to Rs. 27,83,765/-. Cruz Fernandez got this amount as grant and as loan and completed the scheme in 1938 and enabled the people of Tuticorin, to get good drinking water. Before the completion of this scheme when there was scarcity of water, Cruz Fernandez arranged bringing of water to this town by train from Kadambur and by Thonis (Country Boats) from Sri Lanka. Water tax was also levied on the people. Though initially it was criticized by the people, the success of the programme changed their mind to accept it without opposition.

The event is noted by an observer, typically the infant's caregiver. It is characterized by one or more concerning symptoms such as change in skin color, lack of breathing, weakness, or poor responsiveness. By definition, by the time they are assessed in a healthcare environment they must be back to normal without obvious explanation after the clinician takes the appropriate clinical history and physical examination. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) clarified the use of both terms in a 2016 consensus statement that recommended the term BRUE be used whenever possible as it is more specifically defined. Thus, it is more useful for assessing risk of further events. The cause for BRUEs is often unknown, although some of the more common causes include gastroesophageal reflux, seizure, and child maltreatment. Evaluation after an ALTE or BRUE is diagnostically important, as some events represent the first sign or symptom of an underlying medical condition. In most cases, assuming the infants are otherwise healthy and no underlying medical issue is found, the infants who suffer a BRUE are unlikely to have a second event and have an even smaller risk of death. Presentation  A BRUE is a description of a self-limited episode. Usually a BRUE lasts for less than 1 minute. By definition, the episode must have resolved by the time the infant is evaluated by a medical professional. The caregiver may report observation of bluish skin discoloration, called cyanosis. Breathing abnormalities, such as lack of breathing, slow breathing, or irregular breathing may be noted. Differences in muscle tone, such as transient floppiness or rigidity can also be characterized as a BRUE. Changes in level of responsiveness such as abnormal eye contact or inability to interact can also fulfill the classification. A BRUE is a term used by a clinician to characterize an infant's self-limited episode witnessed by someone else. The AAP defines a BRUE as a sudden, brief episode that occurs to infants less than 1 year of age, lasts less than one minute, and resolves completely on its own prior to being evaluated by a health professional. The event must include at least one of the following: * skin color change to blue (cyanosis) or pale (pallor) * abnormal breathing * muscle weakness * decreased responsiveness  Causes  Most infants who have a BRUE are never diagnosed with a definitive cause for the event. However, we use the literature on ALTEs, which is more extensive, to help explain the cause of a BRUE. These causes may also be considered conditions that can be confused with a BRUE. = Gastroesophageal Reflux = Vomiting or choking during feeding can trigger laryngospasm that leads to a BRUE or ALTE. This is a likely cause if the infant had vomiting or regurgitation just prior to the event, or if the event occurred while the infant was awake and lying down. In healthy infants with a suggestive GER event, no additional testing is typically done. In infants with repeated episodes of choking or repeated acute events, evaluation with a swallowing study can be helpful. = Seizure = An event can be suggestive of a seizure if the infant was noted to have muscle rigidity or abnormal eye movements without choking or gagging. Evaluation with video electroencephalography (EEG) is useful. = Child Maltreatment = Concerning history or physical examination findings can result in discovery of child abuse. Unexplained bruises in an infant (especially if the infant is not crawling yet) or other trauma should trigger a more thorough medical evaluation. This may include x-rays, social work involvement, or child protective services. = Other Causes = Other causes that are less common include meningitis, urinary tract infection, breath-holding spells, congenital central hypoventilation syndrome, cancer, intracranial bleed, apnea of infancy, periodic breathing of infancy, choking, obstructive sleep apnea, factitious disorder imposed on another (formerly Munchausen syndrome). Diagnosis Taking the history of the event is vital in the evaluation of a BRUE. The first step is determining whether this is truly a BRUE by looking for presence of abnormal symptoms or vital signs. If this is the case, then it cannot be labelled as a BRUE and the healthcare professional should treat accordingly. = Low-Risk Infants = The next step in evaluation is distinguishing whether this BRUE is low or high- risk. The American Academy of Pediatrics classifies an infant as low risk if they have a BRUE and meet the following characteristics: * infant is of age greater than 60 days * gestational age greater than or equal to 32 weeks * infant has had no prior BRUEs * this BRUE did not occur in a cluster * cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) by a medical provider was not required * no concerning features on history * no concerning physical examination findings * duration less than 20 seconds = High-Risk Infants = If the infant does not meet all of these criteria, the BRUE is considered high-risk, and more likely represents an underlying medical condition. Characteristics of the infant that make this more likely include history of similar events or clustering, history of unexpected death in a sibling, need for CPR by a trained medical professional, ongoing lethargy, suspicion for child abuse or maltreatment, or existence of genetic syndrome or congenital anomalies.  Management  If the infant meets criteria for a low-risk BRUE and the clinician feels there are no concerning findings otherwise, treatment often involves simple short observation in the emergency department with pulse oximetry. For the cases where parents complain of specific symptoms at the time of the event, then follow-up testing may be done for the related conditions or diseases. Other tests are not typically recommended for low-risk infants. For infants that have concerning features on history or physical, and are thus categorized as high-risk, further evaluation is warranted. This will vary greatly depending on the infants symptoms, but may include, urinalysis, complete blood count, imaging with chest x-ray, and laboratory screening for ingestion of medications or poisons. Also, for infants in the high-risk category, clinicians should consider admission to the hospital for extended observation, depending on the benefits and risk of the case. The course of the admission provides an opportunity to witness a second event to better characterize it and narrow the list of possible diagnoses. The observation of infants at home with the help of medical devices after discharge is not recommended. CPR training for families of patients who suffer from a BRUE, however, is recommended. Most cases, whether low or high-risk, warrant a follow-up visit to the pediatrician.  Prognosis  The risk of death of patients who suffer from a BRUE has been studied by using the literature about ALTEs, since this data is more abundant. The studies concluded that there is no increased risk of death for these patients compared to the rest of the infant population. As for the prognosis of these infants into adulthood, research still needs to be conducted to assess for any long-term health effects.  History  In 1986, the National Institute of Health defined an apparent life-threatening event (ALTE ) as an observed frightening event of an infant that includes at least one component of lack of breathing (apnea), skin color change (such as cyanosis), weakness, choking, or gagging. The term was invented to avoid previously used terms such as \\"near-miss SIDS\\" to dissociate the event from SIDS, a separate condition in infancy. There had been literature discussion in the past about the increased risk of SIDS in these infants, but more recently the research has concluded that there is no direct relationship between an ALTE and SIDS. It also was defined as part of an attempt to characterize the different forms of apnea, or sudden lack of breathing, in infants. In 2016, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) published a clinical practice guideling recommending the replacement of ALTE with a new term, brief resolved unexplained event (BRUE). The guidelines state that the term ALTE is still applicable with key differences between ALTE and BRUE. The biggest difference is whether the infant is symptomatic at time of presentation to a health professional. If the infant is still showing symptoms, then the condition is termed an ALTE. In order to be considered a BRUE, the infant should be completely asymptomatic at time of presentation, which is more common. Because of this, a BRUE can also be considered as a subset of ALTE. The term change was also recommended in large part due to the \\"life-threatening\\" suggestion from the older term. The rate of death in infants following a BRUE has been studied and is relatively rare, about 1 in 800. Thus, the AAP felt the new term would relieve the stress on clinicians and parents of these infants.

Released on August 18, 2016, the film stars Ryu Seung-ryong, Shim Eun-kyung and Lee Joon in the lead roles. The film was shown at the 2016 Edinburgh International Film Festival. The film serves as a prequel to the live-action film Train to Busan, showing how the zombie epidemic began in South Korea before the latter's events. Taking place in and around Seoul station, a young runaway woman must try to survive in a world that sees her as disposable. The story revolves around two main characters: Suk-gyu, a father who searches for his runaway daughter (Hye-sun), who he finds is alive and currently a prostitute. Just as he is about to be reunited with her, a zombie epidemic breaks out in Seoul. Plot Hye-sun ran away from her former life in a brothel. She now lives with her good-for-nothing boyfriend, Ki-woong, who intends to pimp Hye-sun out again due to money problems. After a fight about this, the two separate and are caught in the chaos bursting out of Seoul Station. Hye-sun escapes with a few survivors into a police station and becomes trapped by a group of zombies within a jail cell, only to realize a surviving policeman in the cell with them has been bitten. Meanwhile, Hye- sun's father, Suk-gyu, approaches Ki-woong before interrogating him for his daughter's location. The two go to Hye-sun's home, only to find that the landlady had become a zombie. At the police station, the bitten officer calls for backup before succumbing to his infection. One of the survivors beats the officer unconscious, but the officer reanimates and bites another survivor in the cell. Help arrives and draws the infected away, allowing Hye-sun and an old man to escape the cell and get into an ambulance. The old man panics when he realizes they are en route to the hospital, where many reports of bite wounds appear to be coming in. He attempts to take the wheel from the driver and causes the vehicle to crash. Hye-sun and the old man flee through the subway. Outside the station, Ki-Woong calls Hye-sun but their conversation alerts the infected. The two are saved, only to realize they are placed in a quarantine by riot police. They learn from the authorities that they consider the crisis to be an insurrection. Survivors fighting in the quarantine slowly succumb to growing numbers of infected people. After a speech on his poor position in society, the old man tries to lead a revolt. He is quickly killed by gunfire, throwing the crowd into a panic as the infected consume them. Hye- Sun is able to escape. Hye-sun makes her way into an empty showroom. She notifies Ki-woong of her location before falling asleep. When Ki-woong and Hye-sun are reunited, she reveals that Suk-gyu is not her father but rather her previous pimp. As an argument erupts, Ki-woong tries to attack Suk-gyu with a knife but is killed instead. Hye-sun tries to flee but Suk-gyu subdues her on a bed. As he prepares to rape her, she loses consciousness. As Suk-gyu frantically applies CPR, he looks down and realizes Hye-sun was scratched on her foot and infected. As Hye-sun reanimates and kills Suk-gyu, the camera zooms past a dead Ki-woong and the infected overrunning the quarantine. Cast * Ryu Seung-ryong as Suk-gyu * Shim Eun-kyung as Hye-Sun * Lee Joon as Ki-woong Reception Clarence Tsui of The Hollywood Reporter called the film \\"a simple, thrilling ride through a fiend-infested world.\\" The review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reported that 100% of critics have given the film a positive review based on 15 reviews, with an average rating of 7.12/10.

The building was developed by Property Market Group and Madison Equities, and was designed by Tamarkin Co. History and construction Developers originally considered building a large tower in the northern portion of the lot, with the remainder set aside for a garden space. This configuration was originally replaced with a wedge-shaped design. The site was originally zoned for commercial development, until the developers appealed to the New York City Office of Administrative Trials and Hearings in order to change the zoning to residential. During construction and following the building's sluggish sales, 10 Sullivan was at the center of a bitter feud between the two developers, Madison Equities and Property Markets Group (PMG). Madison Equities principal Robert Gladstone sued his partner Kevin Maloney of PMG, claiming among other things that PMG had sabotaged their joint condo development through negligence and mismanagement that cost the partners to lose out on $30 million in profits. Gladstone's lawsuit also blamed PMG for 10 Sullivan's poor sales performance. The case was eventually dismissed. Design The building evokes the Flatiron Building in its shape, and is one of several triangular buildings in New York, including 47 Plaza Street West. Cary Tamarkin, the building's architect, has said the design is not an homage, but a necessary adaptation to the shape of the lot. The exterior of the building is brick, and reminiscent of historical buildings in SoHo. The New York Times has referred to the shape of the building as a \\"celebration\\". Usage and amenities The ground floor is commercial; the residential portion is split between apartments in the central building and townhouses in the northern portion of the lot. All units include high ceilings. Other amenities include a fitness center, storage spaces, and private elevators.

Named for Joseph Lombard pere, the purchaser of the plot of land for his son, the tract of land was acquired October 25, 1825. In a series of transactions, the land was sold back to Lombard to improve the land for $7,500. He then sold the improved land back to his son, Joseph Guilaume, with the plantation house for $13,000; the 1825-26 transaction records establish the value of the building was $5,500. The plantation property boundaries began with Mississippi River fronted property 96 acres (1.5 arpents) and 1.45 miles (40 arpents) towards Lake Ponchartrain. The sale to Guilaume included a kitchen house, 8 cows, 2 mules, carts, and 2 slaves. The Lombard family owned the plantation for less than a decade; the land and house was sold April 11, 1833 to Phillipe Guesnon for a lucrative sum of $50,000 for unknown reasons. The grounds were split between the heirs. On January 20, 1835 the house and land were auctioned off to Frenchman Jean Louise Grasse; the bill of sale to Grease described the property as \\"une belle maison...\\" Grasse died March 1843 in debt, his widow renounced her succession of the plantation in order to pay off the debt. The Durands (property owners from 1843 to 1864) re-assembled the property and continued to use the plantation for commercial agriculture. Charles Caffin controlled the plantation from 1864–1880; during his tenure he added a cast iron cornstalk fence to the property, which lasted until the 1960s. IN 1878 the building was auctioned, the parcel was subdivided again and within a decade shotgun houses were built within the property boundaries. In 1930, Heinrich Buthmann controlled the house as an art shop and residence. The next owner, Watkin Eschette, converted the basement into two rentals and sold off the backyard. In the mid to late 50s, the front yard was sold and developed as a cinder block bikers bar. In 2002 the bar and the lot were sold to the current owner, Frederick Starr. The bar was immediately demolished. After Hurricane Katrina, the owner was able to purchase the former backyard and reunited the immediate part of the property. Architectural description Lombard Plantation house in January 2008 The West Indian plantation home was most likely designed by Haitian Creole surveyor-architect Pilie. A raised house on pillars, in the 1950s the basement was filled in for rental units. The facade has plaster walls with five openings evenly spaced; the staircase in the center of the porch opens outwards to the yard and divides the six pillars supporting the overhangs. The roof is hipped with a central dormer on each elevation, it also has deep overhangs creating porches on the facade and the rear elevation. The building has a raised basement, a main floor with five rooms, and an attic. The rooms on the main floor are a reception room, dining room seating twelve, small dining room for family use, salon, bedroom, and an office. The attic best represents the best Norman trussing in North America. 4 cypress vertical beams come down from the roof. Rectangular connections at the base of the roof redistribute the tension to the exterior walls. There are no support beams that connect the roof to the floor plate. Each beam was inscribed with roman numerals and connected to one another with a mortise and peg system. Restoration Over the last decade the plantation home has been restored back to its initial construction by the current owner. The raised basement has a repointed foundation, excess wiring and plumbing were removed, the cypress beams were reinforced with iron. Wood windows were restored, paint was stripped in all rooms and colors close to the originals were chosen, including the \\"french blue\\" line beneath the ceilings of the main bedrooms and a good line in the dining room. Chemical analysis in the dining room revealed the turquoise color and the gold stenciling painted by local artist Patricia Cummings. The kitchen house was completely reconstructed from the 1843 notarial archives drawings by J.A. Pueyo and historic architect, Rick Fifield. The plan showed the ground plan of the kitchen and a painting of an overseer's cottage, allowing additional details and assumptions of the style and scale of the kitchen house. That plan pointed to the location of the kitchen house which lead to excavation of the site. Brick flooring, shutter hinges, and part of the fireplace were discovered. The owner and his consultants were able to examine the house for clues of how the kitchen house would have been built, for example, the chimney in the house was a reference point for the construction of the chimney where it meets the roof.

Many small tributaries form the river there. The river flows in an eastern direction. The river passes near Burnstick Lake (both the town and the lake), and then passes very closely to the Clearwater River, which is part of a different watershed altogether. It passes near the Clearwater Ricinus Natural Area. The river then starts to follow closely to Alberta Highway 54, yet never being crossed by it. It passes near Caroline and is joined by Beaver Creek which contains the artificial Beaver Lake. Alberta Highway 22 crosses the river. The river is then joined by the North Raven River at Raven and passes near the Raven Recreation Area before it sharply turns southwards. The river is joined by Crooked Creek near the Medicine River Wildlife Centre. The river then passes not far from Kevisville before emptying into the Red Deer River, which then enters into the artificial Gleniffer Lake formed by Dickson Dam.  Fish species  Raven river, especially its tributary the North Raven River, is a very popular spot for anglers. Brook trout, longnose sucker, white sucker, and stocked brown trout are the predominant species of fish located in the river.
