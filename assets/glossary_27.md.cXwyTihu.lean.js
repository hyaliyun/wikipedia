Physical Environment  Alor town is located within the triangle formed by the three main towns of Anambra State. Conceptually straightening out the roads connecting the towns, the northern side of the triangle is the Onitsha ‚Äì Awka road, whether the expressway or the old Enugu ‚Äì Onitsha road. The eastern or southeastern edge of the triangle is the connection from Awka through Agulu or Nimo, Neni, Oraukwu, Adazi Ani, Nnokwa, and Nnobi to Nnewi. The third side is Onitsha to Nnewi. Alor happens to still continue to be protected from that undesirable type of urbanization. Umuoji, Ojoto, Uke, Ideani and Abatete serve very well as such a buffer. = Geographical Location = Alor is located within latitudes 6o 4.00‚ÄùN (Alor/Nnobi boundary off Ichie Okua‚Äôs compound) and 6o 6.08‚ÄùN (Alor/Abatete boundary at Mmili Ezigbo bridge), and longitudes 6o 56.11‚ÄùE (Alor/Uke boundary at Mmili Obiaja bridge) and 6o 58.23‚ÄùE (Alor/Adazi- Ani boundary off Idi Akubeze and Onuselogu compounds). Infrastructure Alor has several functional road system that primes it from the surrounding communities, adequate water reticulation and street lights that grace the town at night. The main market day in Alor is NKWO, and on that day, traders from the villages and from neighboring towns converge at the market square (Nkwo- Alor) to trade. Government The Traditional government of Alor consists of the Igwe (King) followed by the Ndi-Ichie (Lords), Ndi-Idi, Ndi-Ozo (orzor), Ndi-Nze (Dukes) and other titled individuals and groups E.g.:, Umu-Nna, Umu- Ada, Otu Ogbo (Age Group), Ndi-Ikom, Ndi-Nne etc. However, there are other special sceptered branches that enforce order, they are:- the Igwe-In-Council, Alor Peoples Convention (APC), Alor Development Union (ADU), the vigilante groups etc. The Alor has numerous educated sons and daughters that are employed in manifold industries and trades both in Alor, Nigeria and overseas. Moreover, Animal husbandry, Block industries, Printing Press, Wine depot (palm wine), Palm oil mills, and Soap industries are among the few industries that can be found in Alor. Education Alorites originally are business men and women measured in textile materials, but today, many are educated and practicing professionals. Alor was known with a slogan \\"Alor London\\" even before major civilization came into the town and ever since, it lives up to the name. Alor is home to numerous nursery schools with seven primary schools and two high schools, plus other higher institutions like commercial colleges and evangelical seminaries. Culture The culture of Alor is equivalent to its neighboring communities which are in turn consistent with general Igbo culture. Place of worship Alor has multiple churches and denominations: Roman Catholic, Anglican, Save The Lost Mission, Deeper life, Cherubim and Seraphim, Dominion City, Grace of God Assemblies, Odozi-Obodo, Living Faith Church (Winners Chapel), Sabbath churches etc.  People  Some prominent people from Alor include; * Chief P.N.

Fru-2,6-P2 itself is synthesized and broken down by the bifunctional enzyme phosphofructokinase 2/fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase (PFK-2/FBPase-2). The synthesis of Fru-2,6-P2 is performed through a bifunctional enzyme containing both PFK-2 and FBPase-2, which is dephosphorylated, allowing the PFK-2 portion to phosphorylate fructose 6-phosphate using ATP. The breakdown of Fru-2,6-P2 is catalyzed by the phosphorylation of the bifunctional enzyme, which allows FBPase-2 to dephosphorylate fructose 2,6-bisphosphate to produce fructose 6-phosphate and Pi. Effects on glucose metabolism Fru-2,6-P2 strongly activates glucose breakdown in glycolysis through allosteric modulation (activation) of phosphofructokinase 1 (PFK-1). Elevated expression of Fru-2,6-P2 levels in the liver allosterically activates phosphofructokinase 1 by increasing the enzyme‚Äôs affinity for fructose 6-phosphate, while decreasing its affinity for inhibitory ATP and citrate. At physiological concentration, PFK-1 is almost completely inactive, but interaction with Fru-2,6-P2 activates the enzyme to stimulate glycolysis and enhance breakdown of glucose. Cellular stress as a result of oncogenesis or DNA damage among others, activates certain genes by the tumor suppressor p53. One such gene is for the expression of TP53-induced glycolysis and apoptosis regulator (TIGAR); an enzyme that inhibits glycolysis, monitors the cellular levels of reactive oxygen species, and protects cells from apoptosis. The structure of TIGAR is shown to be nearly identical to FBPase-2 on the bifunctional enzyme. TIGAR removes the allosteric effector, Fru-2,6-P2., therefore the activator does not enhance the affinity of the enzyme (PFK1) for its substrate (fructose 6-phosphate). Furthermore, TIGAR also removes the glycolytic intermediate fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, the product of the PFK catalyzed third reaction of glycolysis and the substrate for the following aldolase fourth reaction of glycolysis. Production regulation The concentration of Fru-2,6-P2 in cells is controlled through regulation of the synthesis and breakdown by PFK-2/FBPase-2. The primary regulators of this are the hormones insulin, glucagon, and epinephrine which affect the enzyme through phosphorylation/dephosphorylation reactions. Release of the hormone glucagon triggers production of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), which activates a cAMP-dependent protein kinase. This kinase phosphorylates the PFK-2/FBPase-2 enzyme at an NH2-terminal Ser residue with ATP to activate the FBPase-2 activity and inhibit the PFK-2 activity of the enzyme, thus reducing levels of Fru-2,6-P2 in the cell. With decreasing amounts of Fru-2,6-P2, glycolysis becomes inhibited while gluconeogenesis is activated. Insulin triggers the opposite response. As a phosphoprotein phosphatase, insulin dephosphorylates the enzyme, thus activating the PFK-2 and inhibiting the FBPase-2 activities. With additional Fru-2,6-P2 present, activation of PFK-1 occurs to stimulate glycolysis while inhibiting gluconeogenesis. Regulation of sucrose production Fru-2,6-P2 plays an important role in the regulation of triose phosphates, the end products of the Calvin Cycle. In the Calvin Cycle, 5/6th of triose phosphates are recycled to make ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate. The remaining 1/6 of triose phosphate can be converted into sucrose or stored as starch. Fru-2,6-P2 inhibits production of fructose 6-phosphate, a necessary element for sucrose synthesis. When the rate of photosynthesis in the light reactions is high, triose phosphates are constantly produced and the production of Fru-2,6-P2 is inhibited, thus producing sucrose. Fru-2,6-P2 production is activated when plants are in the dark and photosynthesis and triose phosphates are not produced.

WINR was founded by the Southern Tier Radio Service, Inc., a firm owned by Donald W. Kramer (1907‚Äì1986), a Binghamton attorney who later served as that city's mayor from 1950 until 1957. Early print advertisements for the station, such as in the Binghamton Press and Broadcasting magazine featured the likeness of locally-raised thoroughbred Exterminator, winner of the 1918 Kentucky Derby who served as the inspiration for the WINR call letters (\\"WINneR\\"). In April 1951 the Federal Communications Commission granted WINR permission to relocate from 1490 to its present dial location at 680 AM; the move occurred in early 1952. In August 1954 WINR was awarded a construction permit to build Binghamton's second television station, which became WINR-TV (channel 40) when it went on the air in November 1957. Several months earlier in January 1957, Southern Tier Radio Service sold WINR and its channel 40 permit to the Binghamton Press, an arm of the then- Rochester-based Gannett Company newspaper chain. Gannett split up the stations through separate sales in 1971: WINR radio was sold to a Mobile, Alabama-based broadcaster, while WINR-TV went to tower manufacturer Stainless, Inc., who changed that outlet's callsign to WICZ-TV. In recent years, WINR was host to the nationally syndicated nightly adult standards radio program \\"The Clinton Ferro Program\\" starring Clinton Ferro from 2000 to 2002.

It was also the twenty-second episode of the show's third season. It was written by Bob Daily and directed by Larry Shaw. The episode aired on May 13, 2007. Ricardo Antonio Chavira submitted this episode for consideration on his behalf in the category of \\"Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series\\" at the 2007 Emmy Awards. Episode recap Mike and Susan go out to dinner, the night exactly a year after he and Susan were meant to get engaged and Mike got run over. Susan waits for Mike to pop the question all night, but Susan is disappointed when he doesn't. On the way home, Susan tells Mike what she expected and when they pull up into Wisteria Lane the trailer Susan decorated on the night they intended to get engaged is waiting on her driveway. They live the experience they were meant to have that night and they get engaged. Susan calls around, telling everybody the wedding is back on, and that she plans to have the same arrangements as with her and Ian's wedding. She tells Gaby of their plans but Gaby tells her she's now booked her own wedding for that day. Susan learns she's taken the exact wedding she and Ian were supposed to have, which leads to an argument. They apologise to each other and Gaby cancels the flowers but leaves the same date. While talking, Gaby and Susan come up with the idea of sharing the wedding day, but the next day they realise they don't want to. To spare Gaby's feelings, she tells her Mike disapproves of the idea. When Gabrielle discusses it with Victor, she's shocked to learn the press will be at their wedding and that most of Victor's efforts is all about his image. Gabrielle becomes worried that marrying Victor will be a mistake. Edie becomes upset when Carlos laughs at the idea of them getting married, when suggested by Mike. Edie asks Carlos if they can move in together but Carlos rejects the idea, having already signed a lease with the owner of Mike's house, Lillian Simms, who's in a nursing home. In an attempt to undo this, Edie visits Lillian and lies about Carlos to get her to rip up the lease, which she does. Under the law she can change her mind within 72 hours of the agreement, Carlos is evicted and Edie offers him a place to stay. Carlos catches on to the fact she has had something to do with this, and she asks him why he won't commit to her. He reveals he's not in love with her, and she tells him she might be pregnant. The pregnancy test comes back negative, and Carlos finds himself disappointed. Finding a new way to keep Carlos, Edie suggests they try having a child even though they're not in love, and Carlos agrees. Edie, however, is still secretly taking her birth control pills. Lynette and Tom's marriage continues to decline and Lynette doesn't speak to Tom for five days. In an attempt to rebuild their marriage, Tom gets his old college friend and marriage counselor to try and speak to them without Lynette knowing, but she clocks on to Tom's actions and becomes even more frustrated with him. With Tom's doctor informing him on his back recovery, Tom suggests to Lynette they have sex as it's the only way they can communicate unless they talk instead. Lynette agrees to sex and refuses to talk but becomes violent with Tom. In a moment of anger, Tom seizes Lynette and asks why she's mad at him, and she reveals it's because he had lunch with Rick and because she had to fire him. Lynette then shoves Tom back onto the bed, hurting his back. Tom's back spasms and he moves suddenly causing Lynette to fall off the bed, banging her head on the side table. She goes to hospital for her injury and Tom finds out Lynette fell for Rick and misses him. The doctor performs a CT scan on Lynette and finds swollen lymph nodes and suggests they do a biopsy as it could be lymphoma. Cast Although credited, Bree Hodge (Marcia Cross), Julie Mayer (Andrea Bowen), Orson Hodge (Kyle MacLachlan), Andrew Van De Kamp (Shawn Pyfrom), and Danielle Van De Kamp (Joy Lauren) do not appear in this episode. This is the last episode not to feature Marcia Cross. Series continuity Lynette is warned by the doctor that tests may reveal she is suffering from lymphoma in the episode.

He was also a member of the Oakland Invaders of the United States Football League. He played college football at Northern Iowa and then played ten professional seasons for four teams from 1981‚Äì1992. He also appeared on Survivor: Redemption Island where he placed tenth and became the third jury member. Early years Wright attended Wayzata High School, where he practiced football, basketball, track and hockey. He was an All-American in the shot put and discus throw. He accepted a football scholarship from the University of Northern Iowa. He played offensive tackle during his first three years. As a senior he was switched to tight end, registering 8 receptions for 73 yards and one touchdown. In 1997, he was inducted into the Northern Iowa Athletics Hall of Fame. Professional career =Dallas Cowboys= Wright was signed as an undrafted free agent by the Dallas Cowboys after the 1981 NFL Draft. He appeared in 16 games, playing mainly on special teams and as a backup offensive tackle. In 1982, he was moved to the backup guard position. Because of an injury to Kurt Petersen, he was the right guard in the offensive line that blocked on Tony Dorsett's record 99-yard touchdown run against the Minnesota Vikings. Also while with the Cowboys, Wright additionally blocked for another future Survivor contestant, Gary Hogeboom (Survivor: Guatemala), who was the team's backup quarterback. =Baltimore/Indianapolis Colts (first stint)= On August 26, 1983, he was traded to the Baltimore Colts in exchange for a sixth round draft choice (#144-Kurt Ploeger). In his first year with the Baltimore Colts he started ten games at right guard. He missed 3 games with an ankle injury. In 1984, when the team moved to Indianapolis, he replaced an injured Chris Hinton at left tackle and started nine games. =Oakland Invaders (USFL)= In December 1984, he signed with the Michigan Panthers of the United States Football League. Before the start of the next season, the Panthers decided to merge with the Oakland Invaders. The team would reach the USFL Championship Game, losing to the Baltimore Stars. Wright, who wore #70 with the Invaders, scored a touchdown in a May game against the Denver Gold when Invaders quarterback Bobby Hebert completed a two-yard pass to Wright, who was tackle eligible on the play. =Indianapolis Colts (second stint)= On July 16, 1986, Wright returned to the NFL, signing with the Indianapolis Colts as a free agent. He was a surprise cut on August 18. =Los Angeles Raiders= In 1987, he signed with the Los Angeles Raiders and was released on September 7. After the players went on a strike on the third week of the season, those games were canceled (reducing the 16 game season to 15) and the NFL decided that the games would be played with replacement players. Wright was re-signed to be a part of the Raiders replacement team, that was given the mock name \\"Masqueraiders\\" by the media. He ended up playing well in those games as the starter at right tackle and was kept for the rest of the season playing mainly as a backup. He was waived on September first, 1988, before being re-signed during the second week of the regular season. In 1990, he became a full-time starter at right tackle after replacing an injured Bruce Wilkerson and keeping his job after Wilkerson returned and was moved to left tackle. In 1992, he missed nine games with a right shoulder injury. On August, 23, 1993, he was placed on the injured reserve list. He retired from professional football in June 1994 at the age of 35. Personal life Wright founded Cloudburst, a company that provides sideline misting systems. He sold the business in 2000. Today, Wright lives in Huntington Beach, California. In 2011, Wright appeared as a contestant on the 22nd season of the American competitive reality television series Survivor. On Day 30, he was the 13th person voted out of the main game and was sent to Redemption Island. He was eliminated on Day 31. He's best remembered for his disagreements with Phillip Sheppard throughout the season, where Phillip claimed their rivalry was racially motivated.

The game serves as a followup to the 2002 action-adventure game The Mark of Kri. On March 8, 2016 it was re-released on the PlayStation 4. Plot The story for the Rise of the Kasai centers on a band of warriors known as the Rakus and their battles against the evil sect of dark magicians known as the Kasai, led by the traitor of the Rakus, Maibisi, who plans to collect the six Marks of Kri and unleash a multitude of horrors in order to rule the world. The narrative focuses on a series of events that take place ten years prior to the events of The Mark of Kri and ten years afterwards. Levels taking place in the past feature the older generation of the Rakus, Baumusu, Rau's trainer from The Mark of Kri, and a new character named Griz, Baumusu's mentor. Meanwhile, future levels feature the new generation of the Rakus, Rau and Tati, Rau's younger sister who bears the Mark of Kri in order to stop Maibisi from unleashing world domination. Gameplay Gameplay consists of thirteen levels, in which the player, accompanied by a computer- controlled ally, must battle numerous enemies to progress through the story. Much like its predecessor, the combat system of Rise of the Kasai revolves around the use of Focus Beams, a gameplay mechanic used to lock on to single or multiple enemies from any direction. While the DualShock 2's left analog stick is used to maneuver the character, a sweep of the right analog stick will cause a beam of light to extend from the player's character. When this beam of light comes into contact with an enemy, an attack icon will be assigned to them. Attack icons are symbols that appear over the enemy's head and correspond with the X, square, and circle buttons on the controller. When an attack icon is assigned, the player can press the corresponding button to initiate a focused attack.Baumusu locked on to multiple enemies.This attack will vary depending on distance and the direction that the character is facing in relation to the focused enemy. When only one or two different attack icons are in use, the free button(s) becomes a Modifier that can be used to chain together attack combinations. In addition, some of these attack combos can lead to an instant kill if done correctly. While players may spend a majority of the game fighting enemies head on, there are many occasions where the player has the option to employ stealth tactics to avoid detection and quietly ambush the enemy. A stealth kill can be performed by sheathing the character's weapon and using the focus beam to assign a flashing attack icon onto an unsuspecting enemy. The player will be able to initiate a stealth kill once the enemy is in range and the attack icon becomes solid. To help remain undetected, the player can send out a spirit guide to a certain key-point to scope the environment ahead and monitor enemy positions, armaments, and patrol patterns. Using a spirit guide to scout ahead can also allow the player to devise battle strategies if stealth is not an option. Spirit guides vary between the four protagonists. Rau and Baumusu use Kuzo, a spiritual familiar that takes the form of a blackbird, as their spirit guide. Kuzo can be sent to various perches throughout the level to scout ahead. Tati and Griz summon the souls of the dead to scout ahead from the various corpses that litter the environment. Audio Rise of the Kasais musical score was composed by Jack Wall, Rod Abernethy, Jason Graves, and Mike Reagan with instruments provided by Michael Masley and Mr. Lee Vang. Reception Rise of the Kasai received mixed to positive reviews from critics, as GameRankings gave it a score of 70.65%, while Metacritic gave it 68 out of 100. While many critics praised the game's combat system, control scheme, and distinctive cinematics, others panned the game due to repetitious gameplay while expressing disappointment in the game's AI and lack of multiplayer options.

The Gustavo Capanema Palace (in Portuguese, Pal√°cio Gustavo Capanema), also known architecturally as the Ministry of Education and Health Building, is a government office building in the Centro district of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. As the first modernist project in Brazil, it is historically important to the architectural development of Modernism in Brazil and has been placed on Brazil's UNESCO tentative list. History It is one of the finest examples of Brazilian 1930s modernist architecture, designed in 1935 and 1936. It was designed by a team composed of Lucio Costa (future designer of the master plan of Brazil's modernist capital Bras√≠lia), along with Affonso Eduardo Reidy, Ernani Vasconcellos, Carlos Le√£o, Jorge Machado Moreira, and Roberto Burle Marx. Oscar Niemeyer, who became Brazil's best-known architect later, had a role as an intern in Costa's office. The group invited renowned Swiss-French Modernist architect Le Corbusier to oversee the project. Construction was begun by the Get√∫lio Vargas government in 1939 and was completed in 1943, to house Brazil's new Ministry of Education and Health. In 1960 the national capital moved to Bras√≠lia, and the building became a regional Rio office for the ministry. The Ministry of Education and Health has since been divided into three: the Ministry of Ministry of Education, Ministry of Health, and the Ministry of Culture, all in the building to the present day. Architecture Adjustable brises-soleil (sun- shades) on glass fa√ßade. Pilotis (pillars) and modernist azulejo mural, south view of main entrance. =Description= The building is named after author and educator , who was the first Minister of Education of Brazil. It is located at Rua da Imprensa, 16, in the downtown Rio area of Castelo. Delighted with the shape of Guanabara Bay, Corbusier suggested that the building should be located next to the sea, instead of on an inner downtown street, but the government declined The project was extremely bold for the time. It was the first modernist public building in the Americas, and on a much larger scale than anything Le Corbusier had built until then. Modernism as an aesthetic movement had a great impact in Brazil, and the building‚Äîwhich housed the office charged with cultivating Brazilian formal culture‚Äîincluded various elements of the movement. It also employed local materials and techniques, such as azulejos, blue and white glazed tiles linked to the Portuguese Colonial tradition, in modern wall murals. Despite being a large office building of 15 stories, the structure has a distinct lightness to it, as it is raised above the sidewalk on pilotis (pillars) with access unobstructed from surrounding sidewalks and pedestrian areas. The building embraces bold colours and contrasts of right angles and flowing curves, such as the vitreous blue curving structures on the roof hiding the water tanks and elevator machinery. An internal concrete frame allowed the two broad sides of the building to be entirely of glass. Tropical sunshine on northern glass walls is controlled by Corbusian brises-soleil (sun-shades) made adjustable in a system that was the first of its kind in the world.http://www.greatbuildings.com/buildings/Ministry_of_Education.html Great Buildings Modernist tropical gardens were laid out by the great landscape architect Roberto Burle Marx, and included native plants of Brazil the plant palette, unique at the time. A midlevel roof garden was designed to be seen 'in plan view' from the many floors of office windows above. Trees at ground level included majestic Imperial Palms (Roystonea oleracea). The building also included specially commissioned works of other Brazilian artists. Most notable are the mural tiles outside and large wall paintings inside by C√¢ndido Portinari, one of Brazil's most famous painters. =Historical importance= ;Aesthetics The building is especially important in the architectural history of Brazil. Modernism gained great momentum as a significant \\"turning of the page\\" aesthetic, from the \\"old\\" Brazil of Eurocentric post-colonial urban sensibilities, and a countrywide rural, undeveloped and impoverished, and conservative image. Members of the design group developed a uniquely Brazilian Modern architectural vocabulary, creating a style that became virtually official and predominant in the country into the 1980s. Beside Costa, Oscar Niemeyer, and Roberto Burle Marx, were responsible in the late 1950s and early 1960s for the master plan, architecture, and landscape design of the new national capital of Brasilia. Burle Marx designed the master plan of Flamengo Park (Aterro do Flamengo), the 1950s modernist park and grand urban open space along Guanabara Bay in Rio. Affonso Eduardo Reidy designed the Museum of Modern Art‚ÄîMAM (Museu de Arte Moderna, 1955) located there, and Burle Marx its gardens. ;Politics The Capanema Palace is also interesting and contradictory in political history. Le Corbusier and the European modernist architects formed various leftist schools of thought, and the Brazilian Modernist movement was also left-leaning, with some of its proponents, such as Oscar Niemeyer, active in the Communist Party of Brazil. Yet the ministry building was commissioned by a government of the \\"Vargas Era\\" that had taken power by force in 1930, and moved further right into outright dictatorship in 1937. Get√∫lio Vargas, interim president and dictator from 1930 to 1945, jailed leftists and copied elements of Italian fascism in his attempted re-founding of Brazil as an \\"Estado Novo,\\" or \\"New State.\\" This was just as fascism and dictatorship were reaching peak power in Europe, and Vargas dabbled with loyalty to the Axis. Brazil, however, ultimately sided with the Allies in Second World War. The Gustavo Capanema Palace was finished in mid-World War II (1943), as Brazilian soldiers were being sent to Italy to fight against fascism. The modernist Monument to the dead of World War II (1960) commemorating Brazil's participation and losses in the war, is in Flamengo Park. UNESCO List The building was added by Brazil to its UNESCO World Heritage tenative list in 1996, and indication the country intends to pursue full inscription under the cultural criteria. The UNESCO tenative list submission indicates the building was the first modernist structure in Brazil and that it influenced all future modernist projects in the country.https://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/37/ In media ;Film There is a footage of the setting of the first stone of the building, supposedly shot by Humberto Mauro, the most important Brazilian filmmaker of the time. In those scenes, minister Gustavo Capanema is shown delivering a speech. Also visible are modernist poet Carlos Drummond de Andrade, aide to Capanema, and the intellectual Roquette Pinto, among others. The footage is currently kept at the CTAv - Centro T√©cnico Audiovisual (Audiovisual Technical Center) archive, in Rio de Janeiro. It was included in the feature-length documentary Pampulha ou a inven√ß√£o do mar de Minas, directed by Oswaldo Caldeira. ;Publications The building, usually named as the 'Ministry of Education and Health Building,' has been a subject in numerous international architecture and landscape architecture survey and photo-centric books on Brazilian Modernism, and on the works of Lucio Costa, Roberto Burle Marx, and Oscar Niemeyer.Kenneth Frampton.

It is most noted for being the theme song to the American TV series Scrubs. Background and release \\"Superman\\" was first released on the soundtrack album for the film The Tao of Steve in 2000, a year prior to its first appearance in Scrubs, though it was not featured in the film itself. Zach Braff, the star of Scrubs, was impressed by the song and suggested the use of the song as the theme to executive producer Bill Lawrence. Scrubs proved to be successful and \\"Superman\\" was later issued on the first show soundtrack and as a promotional single. Around the same time, in September 2002, the song was released on Lazlo Bane's second studio album All the Time in the World. =Versions and structure= The soundtrack version of \\"Superman\\", both Scrubs' and The Tao of Steve, has duration 3:38 and omits the intro count-in which is present on the album All the Time in the World, making the duration of the latter 3:43. The single version of the song also doesn't have the count-in, but it is 5 seconds shorter than the soundtrack version due to slightly faster speed. The last episode of the eight's season of Scrubs \\"My Finale\\" features a portion of the acoustic instrumental version of \\"Superman\\". \\"Superman\\" samples the drum track of \\"Impeach The President\\" by '70s soul group The Honey Drippers. Music video Zach Braff directed the song's music video. It shows behind-the-scenes footage from the Scrubs set and features several of the show's cast members, including Zach Braff, Sarah Chalke and Ken Jenkins. The video was filmed at the abandoned North Hollywood Medical Center, which doubles as the show's location Sacred Heart Hospital. A small video productions company, Clay Cow Productions, made their own music video for the song, which was praised by Chad Fischer. The video illustrates the lyrics of the song with plasticine characters and set. Reception Chad Fischer, Tim Bright and Chris Link as composers of \\"Superman\\" along with Scrubs‚Äô composer Jan Stevens won BMI TV Music Award of 2003 and 2004 for the show's theme song and music. Superman was ranked No. 2 at the 2004 Just Plain Folks Music Awards in the category College Rock Song. In 2014 Mashable included the song in their list of 25 iconic TV theme songs of all time.

A Texas native, Saxon was the quarterback of the 1925 and 1926 Texas Longhorns football teams and was selected as an all-conference player in 1926. He also played minor league baseball in 1926 and 1927. From 1927 to 1941, he served as athletic director and coach at Texas School of Mines (now known as the University of Texas El Paso). He coached the school's football, baseball, basketball, and track teams at various times. In 13 years as the head football coach, he turned the program into a regional power, oversaw the construction of Kidd Field, led the team to its first bowl game, and compiled a 66‚Äì43‚Äì9 record. Saxon served in the United States Navy during World War II, supervising an athletic training program for naval flyers. He continued that work as a civilian employee of the Navy after the war before dying of a heart attack at age 47. Early years Saxon was born in 1901 in Palestine, Texas, and attended Temple High School in Temple, Texas. He initially attended Austin College in Sherman, Texas, before transferring to the University of Texas. At Texas, he was quarterback of the school's football team during the 1925 and 1926 seasons. He was selected as both the team captain and the most valuable player on the 1926 Texas Longhorns football team. At the end of the 1926 season, he was also selected as the most valuable player, best blocker, best defensive player, and best strategist in the Southwest Conference. Saxon also played professional baseball as a catcher for two years. He played for the Tyler Trojans in 1927 and for the Palestine Pals in 1927 and 1928. Coaching career In 1927, the Texas School of Mines hired E. J. Stewart, who had coached Saxon at Texas, as the school's new head football coach. Saxon joined Stewart in September 1927 as an assistant coach at Texas Mines. In December 1927, Saxon (at age 26) was named Texas Mines' new athletic director, retained his role as assistant football coach, and was also given responsibility to coach the track and baseball teams. He also coached the basketball team beginning in 1928. Stewart retired as the head football coach after the 1928 season, and Saxon was chosen to replace him. Prior to Saxon taking over as head coach, Texas Mines had only four winning seasons in program history and only one season with a record more than one game above .500. Saxon immediately turned the program around, leading his teams to records of 6‚Äì1‚Äì2 in 1929, 7‚Äì1‚Äì1 in 1930, 7‚Äì1 in 1931, and 7‚Äì3 in 1932. The popularity of the football program grew under Saxon's leadership, leading to the construction of Kidd Field. In 1935, he served as co-coach of the El Paso All-Stars in the first Sun Bowl game. In 1936, Saxon led his team to a 5‚Äì2‚Äì1 record in the regular season and a berth in the Sun Bowl game. He followed in 1937 with a 7‚Äì1‚Äì2 season. After the 1941 season, Saxon resigned his positions at Texas Mines. In 13 seasons as head coach, Saxon's football teams compiled a 66‚Äì43‚Äì9 record. As coach of the basketball team from 1928 to 1934, he tallied a mark of 34‚Äì61. He also coached the school's baseball team in 1928 and 1930, compiling a 17‚Äì4 record. Military service, family and later years In May 1941, with the United States at war, Saxon was commissioned as a lieutenant in the United States Navy. In September 1942, he was placed in charge of the physical fitness program at the Banana River Naval Air Station in Florida. He left active duty in 1945 with the rank of commander. After the war, Saxon remained affiliated with the Navy as a civilian employee in charge of the athletics training program. On June 1, 1934, Saxon was married to Mary Hilton, the former wife of hotel magnate Conrad Hilton. In May 1949, Saxon died at age 47 of a heart attack at his home in Arlington, Virginia.

He is widely acknowledged as the father of digital synthesis and as a trendsetter in the use of computer technology in the making of electronic music. Palm's interest in synthesis technology began as a keyboardist in various local bands in his hometown of Hamburg, Germany. His namesake corporation began operating as early as 1975, manufacturing modular synthesizers in small numbers for electronica act Tangerine Dream and other musicians. Palm is arguably most famous for the invention of wavetable synthesis, a concept which he developed in the late 1970s when he created his Minimoog-like synthesizer - the 1020 - featuring digitally controlled oscillators instead of the voltage controlled oscillators that his 1002 synthesizer and all other analog synthesizers of that time were using. He also created the 360 Wavecomputer that would later become the renowned PPG Wave series. Palm's design was the impetus for the creation of the highly successful PPG Wave synthesizer, which was used by numerous bands throughout the 1980s and beyond. The sounds in the PPG Wave inspired other manufacturers of digital synthesizers, such as Sequential Circuits and Ensoniq. Today, nearly every digital synthesizer is in some way based on the concept of wavetable synthesizers. Wolfgang Palm was also one of the first people to experiment with data transmission systems for exchange of data between digital synthesizers and sequencers. His early design of an 8-bit parallel bus system was later abandoned and replaced by MIDI.

She could be the queen mother (king's mother), grandmother, aunt, etc. The most famous of them all is the mother of King Madurantaka Uttama Chola Deva. She was one of the most powerful queens of the Chola empire who over a period of sixty years constructed numerous temples and gave generous gifts to many temples in South India. Her endowments are simply staggering and she figures as early as, if not before, Saka 901 during the reign of her son. According to an inscription dated 941, Sembiyan Mahadevi is said to have made an endowment so that a lamp may be kept permanently lit in front of the Shiva deity (perhaps not long after the crystallization of the Chidambaram Nataraja (NatarƒÅja) cult).A History of India by Hermann Kulke and Dietmar Rothermund (1998) p.134A History of India by Hermann Kulke (2004) p.145Siva in the Forest of Pines: An Essay on Sorcery and Self-Knowledge by Don Handelman and David Shulman (2004) p.88 The mother of Madhurantaka Uttama Chola She was the queen of Gandaraditya Chola (Sri-Gandaraditta deva tam-pirattiyar) and is always referred to as the mother of Uttama Chola, Uttama Chola devarai tiru-vayiru-vaiykka-udaiya pirattiyar Sri Sembiyan MƒÅdeyiar(the queen who had the fortune to bear Uttama Chola Deva alias the Great Queen of the Sembiyan (Chola))- in the inscriptions in order to differentiate her from the other queens who have borne the title before and after her. From various inscriptions we know that she was the daughter of a Mazhavarayar chieftain. In the beginning, she always refers to herself as the daughter of Mala-PerumƒÅnadigal.Early Cholas: mathematics reconstructs the chronology, page 39Lalit kalƒÅ, Issues 3-4, page 55 Patron of Art and Architecture She was very pious and was an avid temple builder and has built numerous temples some of which are at Kutralam, Virudhachalam, Aduthurai, Vakkarai, Anangur, etc.≈örƒ´nidhi·∏•: perspectives in Indian archaeology, art, and culture : Shri K.R.

During her lifetime, special celebrations marked her birthday in the Shiva(≈öiva) temple in the town of Sembiyan Mahadevi, named after her, and a metal portrait of the beloved queen was presented to the temple in her honor, possibly commissioned by her son. As such, it would have been recognized as Sembiyan Mahadevi by its use in processions celebrating her birthday. This highly stylized bronze image is an instance of the blurring of lines between royal and divine portraiture in ancient Indian art. The pose is reminiscent of the goddess Parvati. Indian artists often portray Hindu deities with great attention to arm/hand details to emphasize their omnipresence and omnipotence. A variety of hand gestures, known as mudras, are used to express the mood and meaning of the images of the gods. For instance, when the palm is raised to face the worshiper, it is the gesture of protection (abhaya), while a lowered hand with the fingers pointing downward signifies a promise to grant the devotee's wishes (varada). The contrapposto pose, known in India as tribhanga, or triple-bent, was a popular stance; it produced a sense of swaying movement, and most images, whether human or divine, are thus poised. Visual metaphor A metaphor in literature juxtaposes two seemingly unrelated things to highlight certain important aspects of one of them. The same is possible in visual art. With all exaggerated features, Sembiyan Mahadevi bronze is not meant to be taken literally. Sembiyan Mahadevi is a visual metaphor yet the most elusive from neuronal and aesthetic perspective. According to Ramachandran the exaggerated features of Sembiyan Mahadevi are meant to symbolyze specific divine attributes.A Brief Tour of Human Consciousness: From Impostor Poodles to Purple Numbers by V.

Her Vice-Chair Peter Lunenfeld wrote about her: ‚ÄúRebeca has won the three most significant awards in the field of design: The Cooper-Hewitt National Design Award in Communication Design, 2012, the AIGA Medal in 2017, and induction to the One Club Hall of Fame in 2017. This triple crown would be worthy enough on its own, more than worthy, absolutely exceptional, but when you add in that Rebeca is the first and only Latina to win each one of these, much less all three, the achievement is towering.‚Äù \\"M√©ndez has spent her career crossing the boundaries of culture, disciplines, and thought,\\" writes Margaret Andersen in the biography she wrote of her when M√©ndez was awarded the AIGA Medal. \\"She inhabits the worlds of design and art simultaneously, and it is this rare ability to migrate effortlessly between art gallery, ad agency, and university classroom that enables her dynamic point of view to emanate from everything she produces.\\"  Early life and education  Rebeca M√©ndez was born June 8, 1962, in Mexico City, Mexico. Her parents were both chemical engineers who she always saw investigating, experimenting and proving their work, which she has credited as inspiring the process for her art work. At the age of six M√©ndez began training as a gymnast, at ten she joined the Junior National Olympics Gymnastics team, and in 1979 she was the national champion of Mexico and on the team that was going to go to the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow. Then Russia invaded Afghanistan in December 1979. The United States boycotted the Olympics and Mexico did the same thing, which prevented her from becoming an Olympian. She relocated to the United States at 18 with the support and encouragement of her father and in 1984 received her BFA in Communication Design from Art Center College of Design in Pasadena, California. In 1989 she returned to Art Center as Designer of the College, and later its Design Director, a position she held until 1995. M√©ndez went on to earn her MFA in Media Design Practices from the same college in 1997. On December 20, 2019, she was bestowed with the honorary degree of Doctor of Fine Arts by her alma mater, ArtCenter College of Design, which honors her as an artist and designer who is able to include great skill and innovation, think in new ways, and move the social and cultural needle. In his introductory words the college's president Lorne Buchman spoke about the role artists and designers must play in the mess of a world they are inheriting, referring to a podcast interview he conducted with her earlier in the year: ‚ÄúOne of the most meaningful conversations I‚Äôve had in my life on the topic of creativity was with the incomparable Rebeca M√©ndez. She expressed what I am trying to convey in a far more eloquent way. ‚ÄòWe can get out of this mess we‚Äôre in,‚Äô she said, ‚ÄòIf we rage with love.‚Äù Before M√©ndez gave her commencement speech, Stephen Nowlin, director of the school‚Äôs Alyce de Roulet Williamson Gallery, introduced her with the following words: \\"Good art and design embody qualities that include great skill and innovation, are pleasing to the eye, grab the heart and elegantly meet a need or solve a problem. But, really good art and design is all that and more. Really good art and design incites a profound kind of mischief. Really good art and design is disagreeable and quarrelsome with what is doctrinaire. It‚Äôs subversive on how it overturns past assumptions, attacks clich√©s, dismisses good taste. It forges new vocabularies and rouses unexpected pathways of thinking. Really good art and design creates change and moves the social and cultural needle. Today we get to honor a really good artist and designer, Rebeca M√©ndez.\\"  Art and themes  One of M√©ndez's first designs was in her parents' home, where they allowed her to paint whatever she desired on the largest wall in their home. Her work mostly involves photography, video, 16mm film, typography, cartography, and architecture. Her work explores the nature of perception and media representation, specifically how cultures express themselves through the style of nature that they produce at a given time and the medium through which they construct this nature. Her artwork has been credited as making M√©ndez a strong asset to the fight against prejudice against women and intolerance due to her focus on women in society. Her art and design work has been exhibited and collected by institutions such as the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, The Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam, Jose Luis Cuevas Museum in Mexico City, El Paso Museum of Art and the Cooper-Hewitt, National Design Museum in New York. Her work has been featured in media such as The Los Angeles Times, The New Yorker and Graphis Magazine. M√©ndez is the founder and director of the CounterForce Lab, a research and fieldwork studio that harnesses the power of art and design to engage with the reality of global ecological crisis and its ties to environmental injustice. Counterforce lab is a collection of artists, designers, scientists, and thinkers working in trans-disciplinary collaboration to create new theoretical frameworks based on artistic fieldwork practices, in co-creation with community partners. Their use of art and design as vehicles for storytelling is central to their belief that mitigating ecological crisis requires a fundamental shift in how we understand ourselves in relation to each other and our place in the natural world.  Design career  In 1992 the silk-screen poster Exceso de Identidad by Rebeca M√©ndez was part of an international invitational collection of forty posters commissioned by the second International Biennial of the Poster, held in Mexico City, under the theme ‚ÄúAmerica Now, 500 years later.‚Äô Her poster explores identity issues, and features her own torso which represents the individual in both its strength and its vulnerability. M√©ndez attempted to dilute the celebration of Columbus‚Äôs so-called ‚Äúconquest‚Äù of the New World by reducing his ship to a decorative wallpaper element; the faint silhouette of the poodle serves as an example of how species ownership limits, traps and distorts identity. Since 1996 M√©ndez has run a private practice with her writer husband Adam Eeuwens. Rebeca M√©ndez Design specializes in work with cultural and socially-oriented clients, designing books on Bill Viola for the Whitney Museum and the Deutsche Guggenheim ; books with curator Alma Ruiz for MoCA ; projects with architects such as Thom Mayne/Morphosis, Frank Gehry and Greg Lynn; with the Swedish activist documentary maker Fredrik Gertten and with Danish director Pernille Rose Gr√∏nkj√¶r; with director Mike Figgis; visionary Bob Stein; author Ashton Applewhite; design theorist Benjamin H. Bratton, photographer Iwan Baan and musician Ben Frost , among others. In 1997 M√©ndez was brought in by Tony Arefin as a freelance art director for Wieden+Kennedy in Portland, Oregon, working on the Microsoft account, including a concept for Microsoft Store. Again introduced by Arefin, in 1999 she began working as the creative director at Ogilvy & Mather in New York, first on the IBM account with Chris Wall, then with Brian Collins at Brand Integration Group (BIG), who then asked her to set up and lead a BIG studio at Ogilvy in Los Angeles, a position she held until 2003. She worked on global brand identity projects for clients such as IBM, Motorola, Trend Micro, The One Club and Mattel. In 1998 her design work was recognized with the solo exhibition ‚Äò‚ÄòRebeca M√©ndez: Selections from the Permanent Collection of Architecture and Design,‚Äô at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, by Aaron Betsky, curator of Architecture and Design. In his introduction wall text he wrote: ‚ÄúM√©ndez is both an artist and a graphic designer. She is a master at organizing information into minimal yet clear blocks. What is distinctive about her work is what happens around and underneath this information.‚Äù The museum collected eight works into its permanent collection. In 1999 architect Thom Mayne and his office Morphosis commissioned M√©ndez to create a 25,000 square feet permanent art installation, a mural covering walls and ceilings, in the restaurant Tsunami in Las Vegas. Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum curator Ellen Lupton showcased the work in the first National Design Triennial in New York in 2000. In the catalogue ‚ÄòDesign Culture Now‚Äô she wrote: ‚ÄúRebeca M√©ndez enables two-dimensional surfaces to harbor illusions of depth, endowing them with such physical qualities as translucency and tension. From the tidy rectangle of the page to the immersive scenario of an architectural interior, she transforms images from static, self-contained objects to open, flowing fields for visual experience.‚Äù M√©ndez credits this collaboration with the moment she felt: \\"Ah, I'm a fine artist. This is what I want to do. That is really when I began working in parallel as both a designer and as an artist. Prior to that moment, I was very much a designer.\\" M√©ndez collaborated again with Morphosis in 2004 to create two murals for the student recreation center at The University of Cincinnati, and this work was exhibited at the Centre George Pompidou in Paris, France, as part of a 2006 retrospective of the work of Thom Mayne and Morphosis. This project was the first design to ever receive a Platinum Award at Graphis Magazine. It also received an AIGA 365 Award of Excellence in 2007. M√©ndez began teaching as fully tenured professor in the Design Media Arts department for UCLA School of the Arts & Architecture in 2003. In 2004, M√©ndez began working with the Los Angeles Commission on Assaults Against Women (LACAAW), which was relaunched as Peace Over Violence. Her work with the commission has been credited as prompting a 50% increase in donations and earning her an honor at the 45th Annual Humanitarian Awards Gala. In 2004 M√©ndez was invited to participate in a competition to design the user interface to the Microsoft Home, which she won. In 2018 M√©ndez was a co-chair for the 2018 National Design Awards.  Art Practice  In 2008, M√©ndez received a commission from the Los Angeles County Arts Commission, who wanted her to create a permanent public art installation. Mendez was one of many artists who participated in the first-ever TEDx conference at UCLA in 2011. In 2013 M√©ndez started work on her Exhibition \\"CircumSolar, Migration 1\\", a video installation projected at Glow, all-night arts event, in Santa Monica Beach. Shortly after, the Los Angeles County Arts Commission recruits her to create the \\"CircumSolar, Migration 2\\", public art installation that will permanently showcase at the Pico Rivera Library. The following year she produced \\"CircumSolar, Migration 4\\" for the Metro Art commission for Crenshaw/LAX, which will be public starting in 2020. In 2017 she received an artist residency in Mexico, where she focused on immigration issues and women's rights. That same year she served as a juror for the Pritzker Emerging Environmental Genius award and served in this capacity again the following year.  Awards  * 1996 I.D.

The album was his eleventh studio LP release, and was his last with Mercury, after switching to United Artists in late 1961. The album's theme was listing of songs about the heart, and contains his last #1 with Mercury Records from 1961, Tender Years. The LP release was Jones' fourth studio release during the 1960s, and lists many of his last recordings with Mercury, after 5 years on the label. Background Sings from the Heart was compiled from recordings during one of his last Mercury Records sessions, and some other sessions. The LP would be Jones' last release during his contract years with Mercury. The album includes his last #1 hit with Mercury titled, \\"Tender Years,\\" and all other songs were titled with 'heart' somewhere. It contains 10 exceptional ballads, and the album was one of many LP's released by George in 1962. Recording and composition =Side One tracks= The first track introduced on Sings from the Heart was \\"Achin', Breakin' Heart,\\" which was recorded on February 8, 1961, and released as a single on January 6, 1962, and written by Rick Hall. \\"Hearts in My Dreams\\" was written by Jones and Roger Miller (1 of many the two wrote together in the late 1950s), and recorded on April 23, 1957, and is the oldest track listed. \\"Candy Hearts\\" was a song written and recorded by Jones in April 1959, and later was released as the b-side to \\"Window Up Above\\" in June 1960. \\"Talk to Me Lonesome Heart\\" was written by James O'Gwynn, recorded in late August 1959, and was even included on his last LP release, Sings Country and Western Hits the previous year. The fifth track on the side was \\"With Half a Heart,\\" which was written by Leon Payne and recorded in early April 1960. The last track of the side was \\"Heartaches by the Number,\\" written by Harlan Howard, and recorded sometime in April 1960. =Side Two tracks= One of Jones' best Mercury recordings, however, largely unappreciated, was the opening track to side 2, \\"When My Heart Hurts No More,\\" a more than exceptional ballad listing. The song was written by Jones' childhood friend and an often co-pen, Darrell Edwards, and famed cowboy ballad songwriter Hugh Cross. It was recorded during the February 8, 1961 session, and was re-recorded with Musicor in 1967. \\"Cold, Cold Heart\\" was recorded for his 1960 album, Salute Hank Williams on April 21, 1960. \\"I've Got a New Heartache\\" was recorded sometime in 1957, written by Ray Price and Wayne Walker, and most recognizably, re-recorded as a duet with Gene Pitney. \\"I Gotta Talk to Your Heart\\" was another co-writing between Jones and Miller, and recorded on June 5, 1957. \\"Frozen Heart\\" was written by Jones and Jimmy Yancey, and recorded in October 1957. The last and most notable track listed was the \\"Tender Years,\\" which later became a #1 after being released as a single on June 5, 1961. The song became one of Jones' greatest ballads, and its greatest version was a 1967 re-recording with Musicor. Reception The album was received well by critics, and even sold well. Tender Years later became the most well known song on the album. In 1984, Jones biographer Bob Allen wrote that \\"The manner in which he sang the words to 'Tender Years' (which, in mid-1961, became his second number one single) was, in fact, just about enough to make the short hairs stand up on the back of one's head.\\" In 1994, country music historian Colin Escott agreed, writing that the song \\"just about defined the territory he carved out as his own in the years ahead...the song, the production, and the performance came together in a statement of soon-to-be classic George Jones.\\" Track listing External links * George Jones' Official Website * Record Label Category:1962 albums Category:George Jones albums Category:Albums produced by Shelby Singleton Category:Mercury Records albums ","title":"Sings from the Heart"},{"id":"10529091","text":"Paul Cotton (born Norman Paul Cotton February 26, 1943) is an American guitarist and singer-songwriter, most notable as a member of the band Poco and as the writer of the international hit song from that band, \\"Heart of the Night\\". History Most of Cotton's music career has been as songwriter, lead guitarist and lead singer for the band Poco. Cotton, who was born in Alabama but raised in Chicago, said in a September 2000 interview with Sound Waves magazine, \\"I'm just drawn to the South. Hey, I spent 25 winters in Chicago.\\" Cotton joined Poco in 1970, replacing Jim Messina. Cotton's best known song with Poco is \\"Heart of the Night\\", which was a major hit from the band's Legend album, released in 1978; the song is an evocation of the night life of the city of New Orleans. Cotton's experiences in New Orleans had been the basis for a previous composition, \\"Down in the Quarter\\", featured on the 1975 Poco album Head Over Heels, and Cotton has described a track from the 1982 Poco album Ghost Town, \\"Break of Hearts\\", as being a followup to \\"Heart of the Night\\"https://keywest.floridaweekly.com/articles/music-scene-33/(Cotton has cited \\"Down in the Quarter\\" and \\"Break of Hearts\\" as being his favorite overlooked compositions). In 1978, Cotton and Rusty Young, \\"got a little rehearsal hall, put together a band, and played...'Heart of the Night'\\" for ABC Records executives. Both tracks were credited to Poco. Cotton also penned such Poco classics as \\"Barbados\\", \\"Indian Summer\\", \\"Ride The Country\\", and \\"Bad Weather\\". Prior to Poco, he co-founded Illinois Speed Press with Kal David; the band released two albums. Cotton left Poco in early 2010 and now works and tours with seven different back-up bands across the nation. Since 2005 Cotton had resided in Key West, Florida where he goes fishing, sailing and sunning when not working on his music. Cotton was actively involved in the Key West community performing at various benefit shows in the area. Cotton has moved to Eugene, Oregon from Key West.

A native of New Bern, North Carolina, Mann played college football at Hampton Institute in 1942 and 1943 and at the University of Michigan in 1944, 1946 and 1947. Playing the end position, he broke the Big Ten Conference record for receiving yards in 1946 and 1947. After not being selected in the 1948 NFL Draft, Mann signed his first professional football contract with the Detroit Lions, where he stayed for two seasons. He later played for the Green Bay Packers for parts of five seasons until 1954. Mann broke the color barrier for both teams. Mann led the NFL in receiving yards (1,014) and yards per reception (15.4) in 1949. He was asked to take a pay cut after the 1949 season and became a holdout when the Lions opened practice in July 1950. He was traded to the New York Yanks in August 1950 and released three weeks later. Mann charged that he had been forced out of professional football for refusing to take a pay cut. He signed with the Green Bay Packers near the end of the 1950 NFL season and was the team's leading receiver in 1951. He remained with the Packers through the 1954 season. After his football career, Mann became a lawyer and practiced in Detroit. He was inducted into the Green Bay Packers Hall of Fame in 1988 and died on October 21, 2006, at the age of 82. He was posthumously inducted into the Michigan Sports Hall of Fame in 2016. Early years Bob Mann was born in New Bern, the county seat of Craven County, North Carolina, in 1924. At the time of his childhood, New Bern was a small town of about 10,000 and was still segregated. His father, William Mann, was a physician, and his mother, Clara Mann, was a supervisor of Craven County elementary schools. Mann began his football career at West Street High School in New Bern. College football =Hampton Institute= In 1941, Mann enrolled at Hampton Institute (now known as Hampton University), a historically black university located in Hampton, Virginia. He joined the school's football team, and as a sophomore, he scored 45 of Hampton's 99 points while playing at the left end position. He scored three touchdowns in Hampton's final game of the season against Virginia Union. =University of Michigan= alt=Mann in his football gear posing as if he is running Mann transferred to the University of Michigan in 1944, where his father hoped that he would attend the university's medical program. He joined the football team as a walk-on and was one of only two African American players (Gene Derricotte was the other) on the 1944 Michigan Wolverines football team. Mann served in the Navy from 1944 until the end of World War II, although he was stationed in Staten Island and was not deployed overseas. After his service, he returned to Michigan in 1946. Mann started two games at the left end for Fritz Crisler's 1946 Michigan football team. On November 16 against Wisconsin, he caught three passes for 74 yards and two touchdowns, while also gaining 26 yards on two end-around runs. Against Ohio State the following week, he had 101 yards receiving on 5 catches, 2 of which went for touchdowns. He added another 33 yards on two end-around runs. Despite seeing only limited action, his 1946 total of 13 receptions for 284 receiving yards set a new Big Ten Conference record. With 30 points on five touchdowns, Mann was also the second-leading scorer on the 1946 Michigan team, trailing only placekicker Jim Brieske. He also gained 114 yards on nine end-around runs in 1946, earning him a nickname as the \\"fifth man\\" in behind Michigan's four primary ball-carriers. As a senior, Mann started seven games at left end on Crisler's undefeated 1947 Michigan team. He caught 12 passes for 302 yards and three touchdowns and ran for 129 yards on 15 end-around plays. On October 4, against Stanford, Mann caught a 61-yard touchdown pass from Bob Chappuis on Michigan's second play of the game. Against Pitt the following week, he caught three passes for 105 yards and two touchdowns, including a 70-yard scoring play on a pass from Chappuis. After the 1947 season, Mann and fellow Michigan end, Len Ford, played in the East‚ÄìWest college all-star game at Gilmore Stadium in Los Angeles; both caught touchdown passes in the game. Mann was also selected by the Associated Press as a first-team end for its All-Big Nine team. He was also selected as a second-team All-American by the Associated Press and the Football Writers Association of America. Michigan coach Crisler called him \\"the greatest pass receiver he has ever coached\\". In 2016, Mann was posthumously inducted into the Michigan Sports Hall of Fame. Professional football =Detroit Lions= In February 1948, Mann traveled to New York and met with New York Yankees coach Ray Flaherty. Mann said at the time that he would like to play for the Yankees, but was reluctant to agree to any terms as he was expecting to receive interest from several other teams in the All- America Football Conference (AAFC) and National Football League (NFL). In April 1948, Mann signed with the Detroit Lions of the NFL; his first contract was for $7,500. He was also hired to a sales position at the Goebel Brewing Company, which was owned by Lions' president Edwin J. Anderson. At the time, Detroit's new head coach Bo McMillin said, \\"We're tickled to get Mann. We've been after his name on a Detroit contract ever since I came here as a coach. We know he will be a valuable professional performer\\". 1948 season Bowman football cardalt=A black and white photo of Mann posing catching a football with one hand As a rookie in 1948, Mann and halfback Mel Groomes became the first African Americans to play for the Lions. Even though team owners claimed that a ban on African American players did not exist, between 1933 and 1945 no African American played in the NFL. Teams in the rival AAFC were much more willing to sign African American players. Even after the NFL began signing African American players to their rosters, it took many years for them to be given the same opportunities as white players. Mann appeared in all 12 games for the Lions in the 1948 season, though none as a starter. Despite his role as a backup, Mann finished the season with 33 catches for 560 yards, ranking him seventh in the NFL in receiving yards and fourth in yards per reception. The Lions would finish the year with a record of , putting them in last place in the Western Division. In December 1948, Mann joined Jesse Owens' Olympians professional basketball team in Cleveland. Mann had played two years of college basketball at Hampton Institute. 1949 season In the preseason before the 1949 season, the Lions played an exhibition game against the Philadelphia Eagles in New Orleans. Coach McMillin met with the Lions' African American players, including Mann, and explained that due to racial issues, they would not be able to play in the game. On December 11, 1949, Mann was credited with eight catches for 182 yards and two touchdowns (including a 64-yard touchdown pass from Frank Tripucka in the first quarter and a 41-yard touchdown pass in the fourth quarter) against the Green Bay Packers. After the game, Mann's wife, described as \\"an ardent football fan,\\" told statistician Nick Kerbawy that her tally sheet showed that her husband caught nine passes. Kerbawy reexamined the play-by-play account and discovered she was right. The new total of nine receptions set a new Lions' record for a single game. During the 1949 season, Mann led the NFL with 1,014 receiving yards and 15.4 yards per catch. He also finished second in receptions with 66 (Tom Fears set an NFL record in 1949 with 77 receptions). At the time, Mann's season totals in receiving yards and receptions both ranked in the top five all-time. He also became the first Lions' player to eclipse 1,000 receiving yards in a season. Despite leading the NFL in receiving yards, Mann was not selected by the United Press (UP) for either its first- or second-team All-NFL team. Instead, he was named in its \\"Honorable Mention\\" team. During the off- season in 1950, the Lions asked Mann to take a $1,500 pay cut from $7,500 to $6,000. According to the Lions, the pay cut request was based on the larger pool of available players and the merger of the AAFC and NFL before the start of the season. Mann objected and refused to sign a 1950 contract. Further complicating the negotiations, the African American community in Detroit had called for a boycott of Goebel beer, after a bid by an African American group for a distributorship in Detroit's black community had been rejected. Mann recalled that Goebels/Lions president Anderson was under the mistaken impression that Mann had met with representatives of the boycott. =New York Yanks= On July 31, 1950, Mann became a holdout when he failed to show up on the first day of practice for the Lions. That same day, his position for Goebel was terminated. Four days later, he was sent to the New York Yanks in payment for quarterback Bobby Layne. The Lions had previously traded fullback Camp Wilson for Layne, but Wilson refused to report to the Yanks. Mann later recalled that Yanks' coach Red Strader was upset about the trade. Despite performing well during the team's training camp, Mann received little playing time in exhibition games. John Rauch, a rookie quarterback, told Mann that he had been ordered by coach Strader not to throw to him. Although it was unclear why he was not being thrown to, Mann understood the reason to be racially motivated. The day after Rauch threw a 50-yard touchdown pass to Mann in a pre-season game against the Washington Redskins, Mann was released by the Yanks. He was not picked up by any other team and officially became a free agent. Through October 1950, Mann was jobless. At the end of the month, Mann publicly charged that he had been \\"railroaded\\" out of professional football. After he objected to the Lions' proposed pay cut, he asserted that the NFL had taken a \\"hands off\\" policy toward him. Mann publicly stated, \\"I must have been blackballed ‚Äì it just doesn't make sense that I'm suddenly not good enough to make a single team in the league\\". The Lions' response to Mann's charge was a statement that they felt he was too small in stature to be an effective blocker. Mann filed a lawsuit against the NFL based on his belief that NFL owners colluded to avoid signing him. Commissioner Bert Bell disagreed, even though he was familiar with the way that team owners had worked together to not sign black players over the previous decade. =Green Bay Packers= alt=Bob Mann and Len Ford wearing suits standing next to each other 1950‚Äì1951 Mann was signed by the Green Bay Packers on November 25, 1950, ending his suit against the NFL. On November 26, 1950, he appeared in the Packers' final home game against the San Francisco 49ers and became--at the time--the first known African American to play for the team. It was later determined that Walt Jean, an offensive lineman for the Packers in the 1920s, was African American through his father's side of the family; this was not known by Jean's teammates at the time, thus the color barrier was officially broken for the Packers when Mann played his first game with the team. Mann ended up playing in three games for the Packers in the 1950 season, catching six passes for 89 yards and one touchdown. In the 1951 season, Mann led the Packers with 50 catches, 696 receiving yards, and eight touchdowns; he also ranked fourth in the NFL in both receptions and receiving yards that year. Mann's best performance in 1951 came in an October game against the Philadelphia Eagles; he caught three touchdown passes while the Packers upset the favored Eagles. The Packers ended the season with a record of , the fourth straight season they won three or fewer games. 1952‚Äì1955 In the 1952 NFL draft, the Packers selected Rice University end Billy Howton with their second round pick. Howton, who elicited comparisons to Hall of Famer Don Hutson, made an immediate impact on the Packers, leading the league in the 1952 season with 1,231 receiving yards. Even with Howton in the lineup, Mann had a productive year, recording 30 receptions for 517 yards and six touchdowns. The Packers improved their record to , finishing fourth in their conference. By the 1953 season, Mann and Howton were considered one of the best receiving duos in the league, though both players missed several games due to injury throughout the season. In ten games, Mann finished the year with 23 receptions for 327 yards and two touchdowns, all of which were second to Howton's totals for the season. Mann's best game in 1953 came in a 21‚Äì21 tie against the Chicago Bears; according to the Green Bay Press-Gazette, Mann \\"was open all afternoon as the Bears chased Howton\\" while catching six passes for 101 yards, including a 45-yard catch. The Packers ended the year in last place in their conference with a record of . In the 1954 season, Mann played in only two of the Packers' first four games. In those two games, he did not record a catch. He had sustained a knee injury during a preseason game against the Philadelphia Eagles and was subsequently released by the team six weeks later in October. In November 1955, Mann filed a $25,000 breach of contract suit against the Packers. Mann claimed his release was illegal because he was not given written notice by the team. Mann and the Packers ultimately settled the lawsuit for an undisclosed amount in 1957. Mann's knee injury forced him to retire from professional football. Race When Mann joined the Packers, the city of Green Bay, Wisconsin, had fewer than 20 African American residents. Despite this lack of diversity, Mann's time with the Packers was largely free of overt racial incidents. Racial issues did arise when Mann traveled to other cities with the team. Green Bay Press-Gazette sports writer Art Daley recalled a story involving Mann and teammate Dick Afflis, who later became known in professional wrestling as \\"Dick the Bruiser\\". The Packers stayed at a Baltimore hotel that would not allow Mann to stay with the team on account of its policy prohibiting African-American guests. When Mann left to go to another hotel, the Afflis left with him. When a cab driver told Afflis that he would not drive Mann because of his race, Afflis grabbed the driver by the shirt and said, \\"You will take him wherever he wants to go\\". Several white teammates reached out to Mann to welcome him after he signed with the Packers and coach Gene Ronzani gave him additional travel privileges to Milwaukee and Chicago. Overall, Mann enjoyed his time in Green Bay, saying \\"I never had any problems. Everyone treated me well\\". Legacy Mann compiled 109 catches for 1,629 yards and 17 touchdowns over his five seasons with the Packers. He was inducted into the Green Bay Packers Hall of Fame in 1988 in recognition of his contributions to the team. His impact was largely felt off the field though, the Detroit Free Press writing that Mann was a \\"pioneer\\" wherever he played football, breaking multiple color barriers and doing so in a \\"dignified and friendly manner\\" that showed his \\"strength and determination\\". Packers' team historian Cliff Christl noted that \\"Mann endured unimaginable obstacles just to gain [the] opportunity\\" to play professional football. Legal career and personal life After retiring from football, Mann returned to Detroit where he worked in real estate sales for the next decade. Mann was married twice, his first marriage ending in divorce. He remarried in 1956, and with his wife, Vera, had two daughters, Marjorie and Marilyn. In 1966, at age 43, Mann enrolled in night school at Detroit College of Law. He graduated from law school in 1970 and worked as a criminal defense lawyer for over 30 years in Detroit, heading the firm of Robert Mann & Associates. Mann's law office was located a few blocks from the Detroit Lions' Ford Field. At the Lions' first regular season game at Ford Field on September 22, 2002, Mann was the Lions' honorary captain. He died on October 21, 2006, aged 82.

The album was his second album release of the 1960s, and is one of the best sounding albums recorded with Mercury Records. Though the album didn't chart, however, it became one of his best sellers. All of the songs included were recorded by Hank Williams at some point in his short-lived career, and during this time of Jones' career, he had incorporated much of Williams singing style into his style. Background George Jones very often would cite Hank Williams as his biggest musical influence. Jones listened to him any chance he could get, and bought many of his records. He would even meet Williams during a radio show on KRIC in Beaumont, Texas where a young teenage Jones secured a gig backing old-timer country duet act Eddie and Pearl. In the liner notes to Cup of Loneliness: The Classic Mercury Years, Colin Escott quotes Jones telling his version of events to Ralph Emery: \\"Hank was appearing at the Blue Jean Club on the Port Arthur highway. A dee-jay on KRIC was a good friend of Hank's, so he asked Hank to come by that afternoon before the dance. I had an electric guitar. I knew he was coming by, and I had learned 'Wedding Bells'. He gets up to the microphone with the guitar, and he didn't let me kick it off. I had done all that figuring out. When he started singing, I loved his singing so much that I was dumbfounded. I never hit one note. My fingers just froze to the neck of the guitar.\\" In the 1989 video documentary, Same Ole Me, Jones admits, \\"I couldn't think or eat nothin' unless it was Hank Williams, and I couldn't wait for his next record to come out. He had to be, really, the greatest.\\" In his memoir, Jones recalled learning about Williams death on New Year's Day 1953 while he was serving a stint in the marines stationed in San Jose, California. After a friend showed him the headline in the paper, Jones wrote that he \\"lay there and bawled\\", adding that \\"Hank Williams had been my biggest musical influence. By that thinking you could say he was the biggest part of my life. That's how personally I took him and his songs.\\" Hank Williams, Audrey Sheppard Williams and the Drifting Cowboys band The songs on George Jones Salutes Hank Williams feature some of the late country star's biggest hits, including \\"Cold, Cold Heart\\" and \\"Hey, Good Lookin'\\". Jones would record a second Williams tribute album in March 1962 titled My Favorites of Hank Williams. Recording and composition =Recording= Salutes Hank Williams was recorded on April 21, 1960, at Bradley Film and Recording Studio in Nashville, TN. All the tracks were produced by Jones' manager, Pappy Daily. The first track recorded was \\"Settin' the Woods on Fire,\\" followed by \\"Window Shopping,\\" and \\"Howlin' at the Moon.\\" The next tracks recorded were \\"There'll Be No Teardrops Tonight,\\" \\"Hey Good Lookin,\\" and \\"Half as Much.\\" \\"Nobody's Lonesome for Me,\\" \\"Cold, Cold Heart, \\"Why Don't You Love Me?,\\" \\"Honky Tonkin,\\" \\"Jambalaya (On the Bayou),\\" and \\"I Can't Help It (If I'm Still in Love with You).\\" In an interview with the Country Music Hall of Fame, session guitar player Jimmy Capps recalled that all 12 sides were recorded in 3 hours, with George Jones singing live, and no playbacks. Other session personnel, according to Capps, were: Jimmy Day on steel guitar, Tommy Jackson on fiddle, and Buddy Killen on bass. =Composition= All the songs included on the album, but two, were written by Hank Williams. Williams himself, is widely regarded as the greatest songwriter in country music's history. Many of the songs on this album stand as a testament to that regard, the best songs including; Cold, Cold Heart, There'll Be No Teardrops Tonight, I Can't Help It (If I'm Still in Love with You), and novelty song Hey Good Lookin'. The only songs not written by Williams was Settin' the Woods on Fire, written by Fred Rose with Ed G. Nelson, and Window Shopping by Marcel Joseph. Track listing Reissue cover Reception The album became one of his very best sellers, and is some of Jones' best recordings during his time with Mercury Records from 1957-1962. Allmusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine writes: \\"George Jones Salutes Hank Williams was recorded at Mercury Records, toward the beginning of Jones' career. At this stage, George still sounded similar to Hank Williams, but he had begun to incorporate much of Williams' vocal techniques into a distinctive vocal style of his own. If Jones had recorded these songs while still at Starday, they wouldn't be as exciting as they are now -- since he had moved beyond mimicking into his own style, he's able to invest Williams' songs with grit and passion, instead of just copying Hank. It's an affectionate, entertaining tribute, featuring some of the greatest songs (\\"Cold Cold Heart,\\" \\"Hey Good Lookin',\\" \\"Half As Much,\\" \\"Jambalaya,\\" \\"Why Don't You Love Me,\\" \\"Honky Tonkin',\\" \\"Settin' the Woods on Fire\\") in country music. (The 1984 reissue is slightly shorter than the original issue and features liner notes by Elvis Costello).\\" References External links *George Jones' Official Website *Record Label Category:1960 albums Category:George Jones albums Category:Hank Williams tribute albums Category:Mercury Records albums Category:Albums produced by Shelby Singleton ","title":"George Jones Salutes Hank Williams"},{"id":"10529223","text":"is a Family Computer video game that involves golfing with popular Japanese golf pros. Summary There are three difficulty levels and the game is almost completely in Japanese. There are also three modes: leaderboard (similar to major PGA events), tournament (using a format found in most sports playoffs), and stroke play. Players have a crowd to play their round of golf into front of. In the hardest difficulty levels, players are confronted with wind levels approaching that of a hurricane while the wind is almost stagnant in the easiest difficulty level. One of the drawbacks of the game is that the player must determine the angle of their flight separately from the strength of their swing and the type of golf club that they will use.

Education and career as clergyman Born Garegin Hovsepian and originally from Artsakh (then part of the Elizavetpol Governorate of the Russian Empire), he studied at the Gevorgian Seminary of the Catholicosate of All Armenians in Etchmiadzin (1882-1890). During this period, he was ordained a deacon of the Armenian Church and joined the Congregation of the Holy See of Etchmiadzin. In 1892-1897, he studied theology and philosophy at the universities of Leipzig, Halle and Berlin. His doctoral dissertation was published in Leipzig in 1897. After his return from Germany, Karekin was ordained a celibate priest in Etchmiadzin. In 1917 he was ordained bishop, Until the outbreak of the First World War, he held a number of teaching and administrative positions within the jurisdiction of the Holy See, in Etchmiadzin, Yerevan,and Tbilisi; he was, at different times, head of the Echdmiazin library, Dean of the Gevorgian Seminary, and editor of the Catholicosate's journal, Ararat. Following the mass influx of refugees, escaping the Armenian Genocide in the Ottoman Empire in 1915-1916, he chaired the Commission of Brotherly Assistance, which looked after the fleeing orphans. Karekin was ordained a bishop in 1917, In May 1918, during the Ottoman invasion of Transcaucasia, he participated in the Battle of Sardarapat; he and fellow priests visited villages close to the battle-front to encourage both the Armenian soldiers and unarmed villagers to resist the invading army. His service was appreciated through subsequent decorations he received from both the Russian Commander of the Caucasian Front and the government of the Republic of Armenia (1918-1920). It also accorded him tremendous respect in Armenian nationalist circles, including the influential Dashnak Party. This proved crucial during pivotal moments in his subsequent career. In 1920, during the invasion of Armenia by the Turkish Kemalist troops, Karekin again volunteered to be at the frontline. This time, however, he fell captive when the Kemalists captured Kars on 30 October. He escaped on 19 January 1921, sought refuge in the city's American orphanage, and, on 21 March, he finally reached Armenian territory, where Soviet rule had already been established. Karekin witnessed from close range Soviet attempts to destroy organized religion, including the Armenian Church. As early as 1923, the Soviet secret police reported its unhappiness with his religious activities. In 1924, he toured other Armenian communities in the USSR and raised 120,000 roubles for Etchmiadzin. In 1924, he was appointed to the newly established Supreme Spiritual Council of Etchmiadzin and was later re-elected to serve on that body in both 1932 and 1941. In 1925, he was elevated to the rank of archbishop. He played a key role in collecting relief for the victims of the strong earthquake that hit Armenia's second largest city, Leninakan (now, Gyumri) in 1926. From 1927 to 1933, Karekin was the primate of the Diocese of Crimea and Nor Nakhichevan (a suburb of Rostov-on-Don), which covered Armenian Church parishes and institutions over vast stretches of Russian territory, including Moscow and Leningrad. He could do very little, however, to stop the continued closing of Armenian churches in those areas. In 1934 Catholicos Khoren I of Etchmiadzin appointed Karekin pontifical legate to travel abroad in order to raise funds for the reconstruction of the Etchmiadzin Cathedral and other expenses of the Catholicosate, as well solve administrative problems that had arisen in some dioceses of the Armenian Church outside the USSR, particularly in France and the USA. From 1935 Karekin visited nearly a dozen European and Middle Eastern countries, during which he raised some US$35,000. In 1936 Karekin reached the US in what proved to be the final leg of his mission. A serious schism had arisen in the Armenian Church in North America on the issue of cooperation with the Holy See of Etchmiadzin, which the dissidents complained was fully under Communist control in Soviet Armenia. Karekin failed to find a solution to this crisis. The Armenian Church Diocese, which had stayed loyal to Etchmiadzin, eventually elected him as its next primate. His election came despite repeated calls from Etchmiadzin for his return to the Holy See. Indeed, the locum tenens, Archbishop Gevorg Chorekchian, reported to the National Ecclesiastical Assembly (NEA) in Etchmiadzin in 1941 that the results of Karekin's mission abroad had not covered the financial needs of the Holy See. In 1938-1943 Karekin served as primate of the Eastern Diocese of the Armenian Church in North America. After the USSR and the USA became allies during World War II, he led efforts to collect $120,000 from Armenian-Americans to assist Armenian soldiers in the Red Army and Armenian civilians harmed by the ongoing war in Europe. Separately, he also helped raise another $85,000 for the formation of the David of Sasun Tank Unit for the Red Army. Karekin's religious career took an unexpected turn in 1943, when the competing pro- and anti-Soviet Armenian political factions agreed on his candidacy as the next Catholicos of the Great House of Cilicia, the second most important see of the Armenian Church. Wartime conditions made it impossible for Karekin to leave the US and reach the seat of this catholicosate in Lebanon until March 1945. In the meantime, he stayed in New York, raising $44,000 for the Catholicosate of Cilicia, plus receiving commitments to sponsor students in its seminary. In June 1945, Karekin briefly returned to Soviet Armenia (for the first time since 1935) to participate in the NEA, which elected Chorekchian as the next Catholicos of All Armenians. Karekin was the first Catholicos of Cilicia to participate in the election of the Catholicos of Etchmiadzin, and he personally consecrated the newly elected Gevorg VI. In 1946-1949, Karekin supported the Kremlin- backed campaign of repatriation of around 90,000 diasporan Armenians to Soviet Armenia. In 1946, Gevorg accorded him the unprecedented privilege of carrying a diamond cross on his hood, usually the sole prerogative of the Catholicos of All Armenians. Gevorg also asked Karekin to mediate a solution to an administrative dispute within the Armenian Patriarchate in Istanbul, which is traditionally outside the jurisdiction of the Catholicosate of Cilicia. Cold War pressures sharpened intra-Armenian political disputes in the Middle East in the last years of Karekin's reign. His relations with the anti-Soviet Dashnak party, which had supported his election, now cooled. After Karekin's health began to deteriorate from 1950, Soviet leaders in Moscow feared that a pro-Dashnak clergyman might end up being his successor. In 1951, they pushed Gevorg in Etchmiadzin to formally write to Karekin in Lebanon and suggest appointing and ordaining a successor (acceptable to the Soviets) during his own lifetime. Karekin refused this offer, seeing in it a violation of the internal freedoms traditionally enjoyed by the catholicosates of both Etchmiadzin and Cilicia. Indeed, Karekin's death in 1952 was followed by a four-year struggle over his succession, ending in a victory for the Dashnak- supported candidate. Career as a scholar Karekin is also remembered as a prominent scholar of Armenian Art at the end of the nineteenth and first half of the twentieth century. Initially, his scholarly interest focused on collecting and studying Armenian oral literature. He also produced some works on theology. Thereafter, he developed strong interests in the study of medieval Armenian manuscripts (especially their illuminations, colophons and paleography), as well as medieval literature, historiography, archaeology, architecture, epigraphy, and plastic arts. He authored a number of monographs and dozens of scholarly articles, mostly in Armenian, but also a few in Russian. During the tsarist period, he was elected a member of the Caucasian branch of the Imperial Archeological Society in Moscow, and the Imperial Archeological Society at St Petersburg. In the aftermath of the Armenian Genocide, he embarked upon establishing an Armenian ethnographic museum in Transcaucasia in 1917, collecting materials from refugees fleeing the Ottoman Empire. During the brief period of Armenian independence (1918-1920), he was appointed professor of Armenian Art History and Archeology at the newly established Yerevan State University. He also became a founder-member of the Committee for the Preservation of the Monuments of Armenia. Karekin continued his scholarly activities within state-supported academic and research institutions in the earliest years of Soviet rule, but the Communist regime's aggressive anti-religious campaign soon made it impossible for him to publish in Soviet academic journals. From the late 1920s, his studies appeared in various publications of the Armenian Diaspora. However, the Soviet Armenian Academy of Sciences posthumously published a two-volume anthology of his works, in 1983-1987. During his reign as Catholicos of Cilicia, Karekin also took tangible steps towards turning the Catholicosate's headquarters in Lebanon into an Armenian cultural center in the diaspora. In 1951, he published Hishatakarank Dzeragrats (in Armenian ’Ö’´’∑’°’ø’°’Ø’°÷Ä’°’∂÷Ñ ’Å’•’º’°’£÷Ä’°÷Å), a huge 1,255 page book about religious and historical references spanning from the 5th century to 1250 A.D. The information was gathered from ancient Armenian manuscripts that were located, among other places, at the Armenian Patriarchate in Jerusalem. He was assisted in this project by his Staff-Bearer (gavazanakir), seminary student Torkom Postajian, who traveled to Jerusalem with him and hand-copied and compiled the information from the original documents. Notes Shortly after the death of Karekin I in 1952, Neshan Sarkissian, an Armenian cleric, was ordained a priest taking the name Karekin in remembrance of the late Catholicos. Karekin Sarkissian later became Catholicos Karekin II of Cilicia and then Catholicos Karekin I of All Armenians. Secondary sources * Arzumanean, Rev.

Spare tire is generally a misnomer, as almost all vehicles actually carry an entire wheel with a tire mounted on it as a spare rather than just a tire, as fitting a tire to a wheel would require a motorist to carry additional, specialized equipment. However, some spare tires (\\"space-saver\\" and \\"donut\\" types) are not meant to be driven long distances.Toyota Corolla 2016, Page 529, The compact spare tire is identified by the label \\"TEMPORARY USE ONLY\\" on the tire sidewall. Use the compact spare tire temporarily, and only in an emergency Space-savers have a maximum speed of around .Toyota Corolla 2016, Page 530, \\"Do not drive at speeds in excess of 50 mph (80 km/h) when a compact spare tire is installed on the vehicle. The compact spare tire is not designed for driving at high speeds. Failure to observe this precaution may lead to an accident causing death or serious injury.\\" When replacing a damaged tire, placing the compact spare on a non-drive axle will prevent damage to the drivetrain. If placed on a drivetrain axle, the smaller-diameter tire can put stress on the differential causing damage and reducing handling. History The early days of motor travel took place on primitive roads that were littered with stray horseshoe nails. Punctures (flat tires) were all too common, and required the motorist to remove the wheel from the car, demount the tire, patch the inner tube, re-mount the tire, inflate the tire, and re-mount the wheel. To alleviate this time-consuming process, Walter and Tom Davies of Llanelli, Wales, invented the spare tire in 1904. At the time, motor cars were made without spare wheels. Their company, Stepney Iron Mongers, had agents distributing the United States, Belgium, France, and Italy. The word \\"stepney\\" is sometimes used interchangeably in countries that were once part of the British Empire such as Pakistan, Bangladesh, India, and Malta The first to equip cars with an inflated spare wheel-and-tire assembly were the Ramblers made by Thomas B. Jeffery Company. The Rambler's interchangeable wheel with a mounted and inflated spare tire meant the motorist could exchange it quickly for the punctured tire that could then be repaired at a more convenient time and place. The pre-mounted spare tire and wheel combination proved so popular with motorists that carrying up to two spare tires became common. Automakers often equipped cars with one or dual sidemounts. The spares were mounted behind the front fenders as they blended into the running boards (a narrow footboard serving as a step beneath the doors). In 1941, the U.S. government prohibited spare tires on new cars. Shortages of resources caused by World War II led to quotas and laws designed to force conservation, including rubber that was produced overseas and difficult to get. A similar ban was also implemented by the U.S. during the Korean War in 1951.  Usage in the 21st century  Contemporary vehicles may come equipped with full-size spares, limited use minispares, or have run-flat capability. * The spare tire may be identical type and size to those on the vehicle. The spare may either be mounted on a plain steel rim or a matching road wheel as found on the vehicle. Among passenger vehicles, full-sized spares are usually provided for sport utility vehicles and light trucks, since a \\"limited use\\" spare would adversely affect such vehicles with higher centers of gravity. Additionally, a \\"limited use\\" spare may not be safe on a fully loaded truck or one that is towing a trailer. Due to the size of the full-sized spare, it is often mounted on the outside, such as the rear door of SUVs, and occasionally on the front hood. * Many vehicles are provided with a \\"limited use\\" spare tire, also known as a \\"space-saver,\\" \\"donut\\", or \\"compact\\" spare tire -- in an attempt to reduce cost, lower the vehicle's weight, and/or to save on the space that would be needed for a full-size spare tire. As of 2017, temporary spares come standard on 53 percent of 2017 models in the United States. https://www.edmunds.com/car-buying/the-disappearing-spare-tire.html A space- saver is typically 7 kg lighter than a full-sized wheel and in some cars the so-called 'space-saver' may actually save little to no space. There is also the difficulty of transporting the full-sized wheel and tire once the space- saver has been fitted. The spare is usually mounted on a plain steel rim. They are typically smaller than the normal tires on the vehicle and can only be used for limited distances because of their short life expectancy and low speed rating. As well, due to the different size of a donut compared to regular wheel, electronic stability control and traction control systems will not operate properly and should be disabled until the original wheel is restored. Space saver spare tires could potentially compromise the braking (especially on cars not fitted with anti-lock brakes) and handling of the car. * In some cases, automobiles may be equipped with run-flat tires and thus not require a separate spare tire. Other vehicles may carry a can of tire repair foam, to repair punctured tires, although these often do not work in the case of larger punctures, and are useless in the event of a blow-out. Storage Spare tires in automobiles are often stored in a spare tire well ‚Äì a recessed area in the trunk of a vehicle, usually in the center, where the spare tire is stored while not in use. In most cars, the spare tire is secured with a bolt and wing-nut style fastener. Usually a stiff sheet of cardboard lies on top of the spare tire well with the trunk carpet on top of it to hide the spare tire and provide a pleasant look to and a flat surface for the trunk space. Other storage locations include a cradle underneath the rear of the vehicle. This cradle is usually secured by a bolt that is accessible from inside the trunk, for security. This arrangement has advantages over storing the tire inside the trunk, including not having to empty the contents of the trunk to access the wheel and this arrangement may also save space in some applications. However it has disadvantages because that tire gets dirty, making the act of changing the tire more unpleasant and the mechanism may also rust on older cars, making it difficult to free the spare. The cradle arrangement is usually only practical on front wheel drive cars, as the cradle would get in the way of the rear axle on most rear or four wheel drive cars. A similar arrangement is also often found on trucks where the spare is often stored beneath the truck bed. Many sport utility vehicles (SUVs) and off-road vehicles have the spare wheel mounted externally ‚Äì usually on the rear door, but others may mount them on the roof, the side, or even on the bonnet (hood). In mid-engined and rear- engined cars, the spare tire is generally stored in the front boot. Some vehicles stored the spare tire in the engine bay, such as the Renault 14, First generation Fiat Panda and older Subaru vehicles, such as the Subaru Leone. Vehicles like the Volkswagen Beetle used spare tires for ancillary purposes such as supplying air pressure to the windscreen washer system. Many models of Bristol cars - those from the 404 of 1953 to the Fighter of 2004 carried a full-size spare wheel and tire in a pannier compartment built into the left-hand wing. This not only increased luggage space and allowed easy access to the spare without having to unload the trunk but improved weight distribution by keeping as much mass as possible within the wheelbase and balancing the weight of the battery, mounted in a similar compartment in the right-hand wing.

It was released as a single three days after Richardson (The Bopper) died in a plane crash. \\"That's the Way I Feel\\" was recorded in September 1957 and was written by Jones, like most of the tracks on the album. Jones would write or co-write 10 of the songs and all of Side 2. \\"Life to Go\\" was one of Jones best compositions, written after Jones played the Old Time Fiddlers Convention in Crockett, Texas with Jackson and Ernest Tubb. There was a prison there and, while walking around the grounds with Jackson, they began chatting with an inmate. At one point they asked him how much time he had left to serve, to which the prisoner replied, \\"I been here for eighteen years and still got life to go.\\" \\"His remark chilled me to the bone,\\" Jones wrote in his 1996 autobiography I Lived To Tell It All. \\"I had hated the prison, but I knew I'd be leaving. That man hated it more and knew he'd never leave. I wanted to get that prison out of my mind. But I couldn't.\\" \\"Don't Do This To Me\\" was recorded on March 19, 1957 and written by Jones. \\"Wandering Soul\\" was recorded in September 1957 and was written by Bill Dudley and Jones. =Side Two Tracks= \\"Giveaway Girl\\" was written by Jones and Sid Kessel on March 19, 1957. \\"You're Back Again\\" was recorded and Jones and Hank Locklin, Locklin singing the backing-vocals for the track during an October 1956 session. \\"No Use to Cry\\" was recorded on April 23, 1957 and written by Jones. It was also included on his 1958 studio release: \\"Long Live King George.\\" \\"Nothing Can Stop Me\\" was released as the b-side to I'm With Wrong One in July 1958. It was written by Roger Miller and Jones and recorded on June 5, 1957. \\"Flame in My Heart\\" was recorded with fellow Mercury artists Virginia Spurlock on March 19, 1957. It was Jones third collaboration during his 50+ year career. \\"Jesus Wants Me\\" was the last song of the album and was a southern gospel song written by Jones with Eddie Noack, and was recorded on April 21, 1958. In his autobiography, Jones apologized to readers who might be disappointed that he had not provided more information in his book about his recording sessions because \\"I've worked so many of them too drunk to walk but not too drunk to sing. I can't remember much about them.\\" As he later explained to Billboard in 2006, \\"I would say 90% of the time I would be in pretty damn good shape when I went into the studio. I did have a little sense, not a whole lot. But I would still have to have a little build-up of courage, three or four drinks throughout the session time. I don't know, it seemed to mellow you out and relax you a little more, and you would even feel your songs better.\\" Track listing Reception White Lightning would go on one of Jones' biggest #1 hits. He would often perform it live throughout his career (being it was a big fan hit) and re-recording it multiple times. The album it produced was arguably the best of Jones' LP releases during his early career.

He played for Sheffield Cricket Club, whose team was sometimes called Yorkshire, and for other clubs in the county. Barker was born in Bakewell, Derbyshire. He was a right-handed batsman and a left-arm medium pace bowler using the roundarm style. He appeared in what is sometimes called the inaugural Yorkshire first- class match at the Hyde Park Ground, Sheffield, in 1833 against Norfolk, although at this time Yorkshire was still the Sheffield Club. In doing so, he became the first non-Yorkshire born player to play first-class cricket for a team called Yorkshire. Barker played in nine first-class matches from 1833 to 1849, scoring 121 runs at 11 with a top score of 37, and taking 38 wickets at an estimated 7.93, with a best analysis of five for 11.

Biography  Andrew Richard Matthew Garton was born on 19 May 1962 in Guildford. His grandmother, Jelena aka Elena (30 May 1903 ‚Äì 1972), had fled the Russian Revolution post-1917 and worked as a nurse in former Yugoslavia. Elena met and married Andre Garton, a Red Army guard, they had two sons, Alex and Igor (born 14 January 1920). The family initially relocated to Austria; Igor, his mother and other family members migrated to Australia on USAT General Haan in October 1949. Since the mid-1970s Garton participated in numerous independent and community media initiatives in Australia and South East Asia: from radio and public access video in his teens to computer networking in the late 1980s and 1990s with Pegasus Networks.About Andrew Garton, official home page Garton was motivated at an early age towards collaborative media art works, combining interests in music, performance and public media.Garton co-founded the new media arts group, Toy Satellite, in 1995. In the past twenty-five years he has written and performed plays, joined and formed bands, written scores for television documentaries, penned countless songs, piano and electronic compositions, experimented with recording and performance techniques. Garton began composing music in the late 1970s and studied composition with composer and pianist, Sykes Rose in the early 1980s. Garton went on to perform, write and record with numerous bands, ensembles and free improvisation groups including Private Lives. By 1983 the line-up was Garton on keyboards and Don Brown on drums (ex-Flowers); Bob Morton on saxophone; Phil Munro on bass guitar; and Jon Needham on guitar. In September that year, Shelley Dempsey of The Canberra Times felt the group were a \\"not in the least unpleasant sounding Sydney quintet, [they] feature a very stylish mix which is clever, but not too clever\\". His later groups were Astrobeatniks, Lingo Babel, White Punks on Hope and Back from Nowhere. In the mid-80s Garton began composing for film and stage. He completed scores for numerous documentaries produced by UK's Channel 4 and the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC), most notably, the award winning Anyone Can be A Genius and In Grave Danger of Falling Food, a three- part series investigating the life-time work of Permaculture founder, Bill Mollison. Garton and Nick Jeanes co-composed the music for Mollison's ABC-TV series, Global Gardener (1991). Garton's music for theatre is largely focused on his own solo works and spoken-word operas (Black Harlequin, Ausl√§nder ind Staatenlose), with commissions for Queensland's Omniscient Gallery and the Debacle Theater Company, most notably their landmark interpretation of Anthony Burgess' A Clockwork Orange (1994). Collaborations and commissions Garton contributed to several international and Australian collaborations with artists such as Stelarc, Ludwig Zeininger, Kazayuki Null, Hank Bull, Ollie Olsen, Brian Eno, Tetsuo Kogawa, Martin Breindl and Jimi Chen. Garton has performed with the International Theremin Orchestra and continues to be commissioned to produce sound works for both radio and Internet. 1997 saw the completion of his first major generative and online composition, the six-week opus, Sensorium Connect, commissioned by the ABC's, The Listening Room, and produced in collaboration with the performance artist, Stelarc. In 1999 Garton was awarded the John Bird Award for Excellence in an Online Multimedia Production for his piece, Ausl√§nder Micro, a virtual opera exploring the plight of Eastern European political refugees.Garton, A. Auslaender Micro, virtual opera. The work was part of his Masters project at RMIT University, Ausl√§nder ind Staatenlose (1995‚Äì98), with a libretto based on a short story by his grandmother, Elena Garton. By 1999 Garton was working on Ausl√§nder Micro at Toy Satellite with Justina Curtis, Bruce Morrison and John Power. Mid-2000, Garton's nine-day, generative composition and installation, Tat Fat Size Temple, a collaborative work produced by Toy Satellite, was released internationally by ORF/KunstRadio (Austria) as CD and Booklet of their landmark collaborative netcast, Sound Drifting. Other works include sound design for Bodyssey, an interactive CD-ROM by Gary Zebbington; STREET (e)SCAPE, a 24-hour generative soundscape commissioned by Alien Productions, KunstRadio and Polycollege Stobergasse, Austria; Sinawe, a performance produced in collaboration with video artist Kim Bounds, depicting numerous forms of traditional and contemporary Korean music for the Melbourne Fringe Festival. Works of note include sound design for the award-winning interactives, MEMO, by Matt Riley and Mud Map, by Sam Fermo. Garton was composer/producer and artistic director for the Toy Satellite production, Undercurrents, which premiered at the Taipei International Arts Festival, April 2001. Late 2001 Garton toured Undercurrents in Australia, performing at the Melbourne International Film Festival, Melbourne Fringe Fashion Awards, This is Not Arts Festival and the Multimedia Arts Asia Pacific Festival with support from the Australia China Council. Mid-2003 Garton completed a major work commissioned by the Australian Centre for the Moving Image - a video installation (From Drift to Derive) and prototype stop-motion narrative engine, D3, taking inspiration from Situationist theorists, including Guy Debord. In September that year The Ages Jenny Sinclair described D3 as a \\"combined exhibition and authoring engine\\" where users ‚Äì typically Melbourne tourists ‚Äì are able to \\"tap on a touch-screen map\\" to access \\"images from particular locations\\" and drop them into \\"a personal image repository\\". From 2005‚Äì2006 Garton curated Frequency Post, a series of five sound pieces from composers in Australia, Taiwan and China, for KunstRadio. The series was broadcast twice across the EU. You can listen to Garton's collaborative computer performance work Drift Theory 2 online at ABC Classic FM's classic/amp website. In October 2013 Garton presented his documentary, The Light Show, on Hugh McSpedden, a lighting and projection artist prominent from the 1960s to 1980s.

Synopsis A poor hunter loses his wife, and their pretty daughter decides to go seek her fortune as a servant. She gets a position with the queen, and works so hard that she becomes her favorite. The other maids, jealous, tell the queen that the girl claims to be able to spin a pound of flax in twenty- four hours. The queen sets her to do it. The girl begs a room for herself, but never having spun flax, despairs. Suddenly an old woman enters, gets the girl to tell her story, and on the promise that the girl will call her \\"Aunt\\" on her wedding day, finishes the spinning for her. The queen is pleased with the yarn, and the other maids become more jealous. They tell the queen the girl claims to be able to weave all the yarn into cloth in twenty-four hours, and the queen sets her to the task again. Another old woman comes to the girl's aid, for the same price. Then maids, still envious, now hold the girl can sew all the fabric into shirts in twenty-four hours, and a third old woman comes to help her for the same price. Pleased with all the handicraft, the queen offers her son's hand in marriage to the girl. At the wedding reception, the three old women arrive. They are old and tired, but the girl greets each as her \\"aunt\\". The prince wonders how his beautiful bride can have such ugly realatives, and the \\"aunts\\" explain that it is the strain of long lives of handiwork: the spinner has an extremely long nose, the weaver has a broad behind and the sewer has enormous running eyes. The prince then decrees that his bride will not spin, weave, or sew a day more in her life.

The LP includes multiple early gospel recordings by Jones on Starday. The album was released on January 20, 1959, and recorded from 1956-1958, listing Jones' first gospel recordings. The album, however, wasn't received well, and did not chart, due in large part to the lackluster sound of Starday and Mercury Records during the 1950s. The album was also Jones' debut album as a Mercury artist. Background Jones's fondness for gospel music is well documented. In the 1989 documentary Same Ole Me, Jones recalls that he learned how to play the guitar at the church where his mother Clara, a devout woman, played piano. The church was run by Brother Burl Stephen (with whom Jones would credit as co-writer of several songs on Country Church Time) and Sister Annie, who George remembered \\"taught me my first chords on the guitar, like C, G, and D and things like that, and I started hangin' out over there more often. She'd get her guitar and we'd pick and sing together...We used to do all the really old gospel songs.\\" Jones's love of gospel music actually predated his exposure to country music, which he would not hear until his family acquired their first radio. Recording and composition Jones recorded the oldest selections included on the 1959 LP in August 1956. The songs \\"Boat of Life\\" and \\"Taggin' Along\\" were cut while Jones was still with Starday. Jones wrote several of the songs with Burl Stephens, composing melodies to Stephen's poems. Both tracks were included on his debut album as well. His first recordings of 1957 were cut in January at the Gold Star Recording Studio in Houston (Jones was still with Starday). It was during this time that Jones also switched to Mercury, recording his first Nashville songs in the Bradley Film and Recording Studio on 16th Ave. South. In September 1957, Jones recorded two songs titled; \\"Wandering Soul\\" and \\"If You Want to Wear a Crown.\\" \\"Wandering Soul\\" was co-written with Bill Dudley, and If You Want to Wear a Crown was another lonesome-pen by Jones. ;April 21, September 1958 Recordings Jones gathered at the studio again on April 21, 1958 to record a series of southern hymns that he picked up and wrote. The first recording was \\"Good Ole Bible,\\" which was co-wrote with Burl Stephens. \\"We'll Understand It (Farther Along)\\" was recorded next, followed by \\"Will the Circle Be Unbroken?\\" After recording \\"Life to Go\\" (a song that became a #2 for Stonewall Jackson later that year), he cut \\"Jesus Wants Me\\" and \\"My Lord Has Called Me,\\" all three written by Jones alone. Reception Richie Unterberger of AllMusic writes that \\"if the lyrical scope might be more limited than his usual early efforts, sonically they're well in line with his approach as he started to reach his honky tonk prime, and anyone who likes late-'50s Jones should enjoy the plaintive performances here.\\" Amazon.com writes of the album: \\"Poignant church going gems perfect for Sunday morning worship plus just as many tunes for hungover reminiscing of what could have, would have or might have been. From early morning pulpit prayer to late night whiskey-soaked tales of regret, a fine collection of Jones at his most melancholy. All this from a man who rode his lawnmower to the bar when his wife hid his car keys. Genius! Righteous.\\" In the essay that accompanies the 1994 Mercury retrospective Cup of Loneliness: The Mercury Years, country music historian Colin Escott marvels at the \\"frightening intensity\\" of \\"Cup of Loneliness\\" and \\"Take the Devil Out of Me,\\" stating, \\"It's impossible not to believe that George was seeing demons and wizards when he wrote these.\\" Track listing References External links * George Jones' Official Website * Record Label Category:1959 albums Category:George Jones albums Category:Albums produced by Pappy Daily Category:Mercury Records albums Category:Southern gospel albums ","title":"Country Church Time"},{"id":"10529412","text":"Verne Clark Lewellen (September 29, 1901 ‚Äì April 16, 1980) was an American football player and executive.

Iwatsu Electric is a member of the Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFJ) keiretsu. History Originally starting up as a telephone manufacturer, Iwatsu had been a longtime supplier to the public Nippon Telegraph and Telephone company. The company has enjoyed growth along the public NTT, expanding its products to radio communication equipment, oscilloscopes, and in the year 1961, their first reprographic system. =Seiichi Iwasaki: Founder= Seiichi Iwasaki was born in 1895 in Shimane, Japan. As a teenager, he moved to Tokyo without his family. He worked by day to support himself and went to school by night. Whilst in school, he became the leader of a circle of like-minded friends, which they called Hatenkai. Together, they vowed to succeed in the future. Iwasaki dropped out of school in 1912 and began his military service in 1913 in Okayama‚Äîwhich he completed in three years. Then he moved to Hokkaid≈ç where he started his career as an entrepreneur. His ventures in Hokkaid≈ç stretched from railroads to coal mines, until the year 1933 when he changed his course and came back to Tokyo again. =1930s= Seiichi Iwasaki was running a small business called Iwasaki Kogyo in the Yoyogi neighborhood of Tokyo for manufacturing and selling cables. Iwasaki realized that in order to stay in business, he needed to follow the national policy and produce what the country needed at the time. The first focus was on anti-induction telephones. In the 1930s, the telephone infrastructure in Japan was primarily used by the railroad industry, the police, the utility industry and the mining industry. The telecommunications infrastructure was so poor that it had to rely on power lines and railway cables‚Äîupon which telephone signals were superimposed. Because the telephone signals were susceptible to inductive interference and noise and the defective wiring in the long lines caused too much signal loss, normal telephone conversations were difficult. Iwasaki Kogyo set out to develop an anti-induction telephone to solve this problem, whilst running the cable manufacturing operations. Similarly, Iwasaki Kogyo focused on secure, anti-tapping telephones. Motivated by these opportunities, he started looking for engineers. Luckily he knew engineers from the members of Hatenkai: Minoru Tokoha and Motosaburo Hashimoto. When he talked to them, they both showed strong interest. With the help of these two engineers, he set up a lab in his own house in Yoyogi to develop the two kinds of special-purpose telephones. After six months, Tokoha and Hashimoto introduced Iwasaki to Kokichi Hayakawa, the television research chief at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering at Waseda University. With the addition of Hayakawa, the development of special- purpose telephones speeded up and the anti-induction telephone and then the anti-tapping telephone were completed by the middle of 1937. (Hayakawa later became the first chief engineer/vice president of Iwatsu.) The sales of anti- induction telephones started in October 1937, and the police, the Ministry of Railway, the power industry, the railroad industry and the mining industry welcomed the product. Demand quickly outstripped capacity, forcing Iwasaki to extend the factory. Iwasaki knew that a privately owned business was not enough to meet such high demands and decided to incorporate a company. On August 14, 1938, the inauguration ceremony of Iwasaki Tsushinki (communication instruments) was held at Iwasaki's own house. (The name Iwatsu became the official abbreviation for Iwasaki Tsushinki in 1967.) Initially, there were 50 employees. They were manufacturing the said telephones and carrier-current telephones, plus components (relays, transformers, capacitors, etc.) necessary for making the telephones. Because the small factory, though extended, couldn't handle the increasing orders anymore, a new, bigger factory was built in 1939 in Karasuyama, Tokyo. The production department was moved to this new factory, leaving the other operations in Yoyogi. Around this time, the number of employees increased to approximately 200. =1940s= Iwatsu was one of the three companies (including Hitachi and NEC) ordered by the army to develop a radar warning system. Because the Karasuyama factory was already running at full capacity, Iwatsu had no choice but to build even bigger factories. Kugayama, Tokyo was selected as the site to build new factories along with the headquarters, which were completed in 1943. Kugayama is the location of the current Iwatsu headquarters. The development of the radar warning system was led by Chief Engineer Hayakawa, and after excruciating efforts by the engineers, a prototype was completed in 1944. The prototypes from the three companies were tested by the army, and Iwatsu's prototype got the honor of being the best in performance. Iwatsu was ordered to mass-produce the systems, which were installed across the country. As a high-school dropout, Seiichi Iwasaki knew the importance of education. Iwatsu began building schools on the corporate campus, providing young factory workers with education. The schools also served as a training center for future engineers of Iwatsu. The end of World War II was a huge turning point for Iwatsu. Seiichi Iwasaki laid down the company's future plan and gave the devastated employees a new hope. The plan was to make a quick transition to manufacturing consumer goods, starting with common-battery telephones. However, the transition did not go smoothly. Starting the development of new products (of which Iwatsu had no experience) from scratch was hard enough; rampant inflation and constant lack of materials did not help, either. When Iwatsu finally got the first approval for the common-battery telephone among other three products from the Ministry of Communications and made delivery in 1947, the employees' excitement reached its peak. It gave them hope in the days of confusion and starvation. However, the company's livelihood was in danger. Iwatsu was deep in debt, frequent demonstrations were held by a newly formed labor union, and many jobs had to be cut. Faced with the severe financial difficulties, Seiichi Iwasaki and other company officials decided to give up the fight to save the company. On March 10, 1949, Tadashi Adachi and Takao Yoshida were brought in to be the president and the senior executive vice president, respectively, in hopes of reviving the company. Drastic changes had to be made, such as selling off assets and properties and laying off employees, in order to lay the groundwork for a solid business base. =1950s= After World War II, rebuilding the devastated communications infrastructure was ordered by the General Headquarters of the Allied Forces (GHQ) and became one of the country's top priorities. Iwatsu took full advantage of the situation and focused on developing and manufacturing telephones. Iwatsu's production facilities made significant advancements with the introduction of quality control and belt conveyors. The foundation for increasing production was laid. Iwatsu established its position as a telephone manufacturer. Iwatsu delivered magneto telephones and dial telephones to the Ministry of Telecommunications, and aircraft radio communications accessories to the Defense Agency. Nippon Telegraph and Telephone (NTT) Public Corporation, founded by the Japanese government in 1952, opened a big market for subscriber telephones and became Iwatsu's biggest client. NTT also allowed telephone sets and PBX systems to be commercially available in Japan. Iwatsu opened one branch office after another across Japan over four years to build a nationwide sales network. Iwatsu was ready to venture into new challenges again. The Far East Air Material Command (FEAMCOM) in Tachikawa, Tokyo was in need of more oscilloscopes (which were scarce and not so advanced at the time) for testing their radar systems. The FEAMCOM cooperated with Iwatsu in developing Japan's first oscilloscope. This oscilloscope's greatest advantage was its ability to hold a waveform still on the CRT, making it easier for the user to observe and measure the waveform. Iwatsu named it Synchroscope, and the first model was delivered to the Ministry of Defense in 1954. TV broadcasting started in Japan in 1953. NHK (or Japan Broadcasting Corporation) requested Iwatsu to develop a new oscilloscope for TVs because oscilloscopes were essential for measuring TV signals and Iwatsu was the only domestic oscilloscope manufacturer at the time. Iwatsu's Synchroscope continued to evolve in response to new demands, such as larger CRTs and higher frequency ranges. President Adachi accepted his new position as the president of Radio Tokyo and resigned his position at Iwatsu. Yoshida became the third president and Kanichi Ohashi became the executive vice president of Iwatsu in 1955. During this high-growth period, Iwatsu's capital increased from 1,000,000 yen (in 1951) to 200,000,000 yen (in 1957). Iwatsu's stock price kept rising and started to get attention. Iwatsu went public in 1953 and became listed on the first section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange in 1957. President Yoshida, who had been the driving force behind Iwatsu's revitalization ever since he became part of the company, was also asked to serve as the president of Fuji Heavy Industries where he originally came from. It became extremely hard for him to look after two companies at the same time because Fuji Heavy Industries started their production of motor vehicles in full swing, so he remained as the president of Fuji Heavy Industries and became the chairman of the board of Iwatsu, in effect, stepping down from his active role at Iwatsu. Kanichi Ohashi assumed his position as the fourth president of Iwatsu in 1958. Ohashi's inauguration marked the end of Iwatsu's long postwar reconstruction period and the beginning of a new era. President Ohashi visited the United States in 1959 to see the trends in the American telephone industry. He found out key telephone systems were already in actual use and was convinced that the key telephone system was the next new thing in the telephone market in Japan. Iwatsu had been working on the development of a key telephone system and the first practical system (with five trunks and ten stations) was delivered to NTT Public Corporation that year. =1960s= Iwatsu was seeking the third signature product following telephones and oscilloscopes. After years of research in Europe and the U.S., Iwatsu took notice of RCA's electrostatic printer and copier technology (electrofax). Iwatsu signed a patent license with RCA and began research and development of what was seemingly unrelated to Iwatsu's then-existing technologies. The idea behind this decision was that there wasn't much difference in terms of communications, whether electronic or on paper. Iwatsu's first dry-type electronic reprographic machine ELEFAX PC 201 was introduced at Tokyo Business Show in 1960. The next model ELEFAX PC 301 was shown at International Trade Fair and officially released in 1961. Iwatsu was the 13th company in the world to undertake the research of electrophotographic technology, but Iwatsu came in fourth to actually release a product based on such technology. A new plating-and-coating plant was built in 1961 in order to modernize and streamline the plating/coating processes of ever-increasing telephone production. With the help of Fujikasui Engineering, the plant was designed with a proactive approach to prevent pollution, namely, an innovative wastewater treatment system. The plant became a model for such facilities, and thousands of people from various industries came to visit. President Ohashi placed emphasis on research and development, while Former President Yoshida had focused on increasing production capacity. Ohashi's belief led to the completion of a technical research lab in Hachioji, Tokyo in 1964. Still, Iwatsu's production facilities kept expanding in order to meet growing demands for subscriber telephones. The Iwatsu telephone production hit the 50,000 sets per month mark in June 1964. An accumulated total of 1,000,000 sets were manufactured by October 1965. An accumulated total of 2,000,000 sets were manufactured by June 1967. In December 1967, Iwatsu was producing 80,000 sets per month, and the number of employees increased to 2,800. The current Kugayama main building at the Iwatsu headquarters was completed in March 1966, replacing the old wooden building. The reinforced concrete building is five stories high with one basement level. It took strong determination and efforts to build such a building in the middle of a recession. The new main building was a testament to the endurance of employees who supported the company throughout postwar uncertainty. Iwatsu started branching out into overseas markets, doing business with Southeast Asian countries, Kenya, Dominican Republic, and Ireland. Iwatsu took part in trade shows in the United States, South Korea, Switzerland, Germany, and so on. The Trade Department was established in February 1966 to diversify export markets and expand overseas sales. An international bid was conducted by the Kuwaiti government in 1967 as part of its plan to expand telephone services. Iwatsu won the 50,000,000-yen bid, beating strong competitors from England, Belgium, Yugoslavia, Germany, etc. Iwatsu exported key telephone systems to Kuwait. It was Iwatsu's first mass-export of key telephone systems. Iwatsu celebrated its 30th anniversary in 1968. A commemorative exhibit showing all divisions' historic products was held in Tokyo. It drew in over 13,000 people. A big party was also held in Tokyo, inviting 750 prominent people from various fields. Seiichi Iwasaki, the founder of Iwatsu, died at the age of 74 on September 25, 1969. The corporate funeral for him was held four days later. Representatives from all walks of life came and paid their respects. Toshio Iwata became the fifth president of Iwatsu in November 1969. Ohashi became the chairman of the board. =1970s= Iwatsu continued to expand its production and export. Kyushu Iwatsu and Fukushima Iwatsu were established for manufacturing key telephone systems and associated components. Iwatsu Seimitsu was established for manufacturing and selling switches for measurement instruments. Iwatsu became partners with Rex Rotary of Denmark and exported ELEFAX to 77 countries. Iwatsu tied up with a Taiwanese company to export telephone manufacturing technologies and start production in Taiwan. The Trade Department under the supervision of the Sales Division became independent as the International Department in April 1974 for promotion of export and expansion into international markets. Although export to the U.S. marked a record high in 1973 (the year the energy crisis hit), accurate information from the U.S. distributors was not readily available, which was a problem for planning new products in Japan. Iwatsu decided to establish direct sales in America. Iwatsu America (now Iwatsu Voice Networks) was established in New Jersey in December 1975. A wooded area of Iwatsu headquarters premises was named Iwatsu Garden and opened to public in 1974 as a contribution to the community. It became a relaxation/recreation area for the people in the surrounding area.

JEOL's instruments are used by researchers around the world, including the University of Cambridge, University of Oxford, and MIT. It has been included in the Activest Lux Nanotech Mutual Fund and the WestLB Nanotech Fund. History Scientists in Japan began to collaborate as early as 1939 on the development of an electron microscope. Kenji Kazato and Kazuo Ito met while working at the Naval Central Institute in Tokyo during World War II. After the war, Kazato attracted Ito and a group of others to Mobara, Chiba Prefecture, Japan. This initial group developed a prototype magnetic field‚Äìtype electron microscope called the DA-1, which was sold to Mitsubishi in 1947. Because of differences over the direction of this early company, Kazato and Ito chose to found a new organization. The Japan Electron Optics Laboratory Company, Limited (Nihon Denshi Kogaku Kenkyujo) was founded in 1949 by Kenji Kazato and Kazuo Ito in Mitaka, Tokyo. It produced its first commercial model transmission electron microscope, the JEM-1, a year later. Overseas sales began in 1956 with the sale of a system to France. The company's strengths were the customization of orders to fit customer requests, and the provision of strong customer support. In 1961, the company was renamed JEOL, Limited. Its first overseas subsidiary, JEOL Company (USA) Inc., was established in 1962 and headquartered in Peabody, MA. JEOL was listed on the Second Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange by 1962, and on the First Section of the Tokyo Stock Exchange by 1966. The company expanded from electron microscopy to nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), releasing the first NMR system in Japan, the JNM-1, in 1956. They produced their first mass spectrometer in 1963, and their first scanning electron microscope in 1966. In 1968 they produced the first amino acid analyzer in the world, the JLC-5AH. The company also continued to develop its line of electron microscopes. The JEM-7, in 1964, was the first electronic microscope to include a mechanism for the electrical adjustment of the lens axis. The JEM-100B incorporated an electromagnetic deflection unit as well as an electromagnetic stigmator. The first photomicrograph of atomic arrangement in the world was taken by a JEOL electron microscope, in 1976. Kazuo Ito has expressed the company's philosophy as follows: In commemoration of JEOL's 20th anniversary, the Kazato Research Foundation was created to support electron microscopy research. Kenji Kazato retired as president of JEOL in 1975, but continued to act as an adviser to the company until his death in 2012. Kazuo Ito was JEOL's president from 1982 to 1987. The Pittcon Heritage Award was posthumously awarded to them in 2016 for their contributions to scientific instrumentation. Operations JEOL Ltd. has four business segments. Electron Optics manufactures scanning electron microscopes, transmission electron microscopes and scanning probe microscopes, along with related equipment. The Analytical Instruments section's products include mass spectrometers, nuclear magnetic resonance and electron spin resonance equipment.

He was fondly known as Reb Burech Hermanshtater. Born in Humenne, Slovakia (then Zempl√©n County, Kingdom of Hungary), as a young child he was already recognized by all who met him as an extremely devout and diligent student. He learned in Kisv√°rda by the famed author of the Arugas Habosem, Rabbi Moshe Greenwald and soon became one of the top students there. Reb Yechezkel Shraga Halberstam, the Shinover Rebbe, spoke very highly of Reb Boruch held him in high esteem. Rabbi Boruch Greenfield married Rivkah Weinberger in 1891 in Stropkov where he founded a small yeshiva at that time. Later he became the Dayan of Shebesh, Potneck, and Hermenshtat, where he founded the Orthodox Sephardic community he served as the interim Rabbi of Klausenburg (where he was also instrumental in founding the Orthodox Sephardic community) shortly before coming to the USA. In 1923 he immigrated to the United States where he served as the Rabbi in Scranton, Pennsylvania, Pittston, Pennsylvania, Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, The Bronx, New York City, and the Lower East Side at the 52 Cannon Street Shul. He was extremely upset with the laxness in which Torah Judaism was being led and he fought this laxness fiercely. In 1935 he moved to Palestine and upon his arrival was offered a number of high rabbinical posts. As in previous times during his life, due to his great humility he declined such positions, but was, however, one of the leaders of the Edah HaChareidis. Reb Borech was close with the Satmar Rebbe, Rabbi Yoel Teitelbaum, and they learned together daily for a period of time. He was also close to the Belzer Rebbe Rabbi Aharon Rokeach who highly respected Reb Borech and spoke well of him. Besides his fame as a great Torah Scholar, Rabbi Greenfield was talented musically and a baal tefillah Chazan. In 1975 a sefer with a small collection of his writings was printed under the name Ohel Boruch His Sefer on Shulchan Aruch Ohr Hachaim printed 1959 Reb Burech had five children that reached adulthood. The oldest was Mariam who married Reb Nusen Baumhaft, the a very big talmud chacham they lived in Klausenburg. Nusen, Mariam and fourteen of their children, perished in the Holocaust. One of Mariam's children, Sidonia, also known as Silka, survived. After the war Sidonia married Chaim Spitz and they had three children. Reb Burech's second child was Ruchel who married a fine Torah scholar named Reb Ahron Klausner. The Klausners had two children. His third child was Eidel, married to Reb Shimon Fischman; they were childless. His fourth child, Mirel, married Reb Chaim Pall. She died during childbirth and was left childless. His fifth child, Sarah, married Reb Dovid Yaakov Friedman and they had six daughters.

It was created by damming the Umiam River in the early 1960s. The principal catchment area of the lake and dam is spread over 220 square km. History Umiam Dam, which impounds the lake, was built by the Assam State Electricity Board in the early 1960s. The dam's original purpose was to store water for hydroelectric power generation. The Umiam Stage I powerhouse, north of the lake, has four 9-MW turbine-generators, which entered commercial operation in 1965. Umiam Stage I was the first reservoir-storage hydroelectric project commissioned in the northeastern region of India. (Umtru Hydroelectric Project, a run-of-river project with an original capacity of 8.4 MW, began operation in 1957.) Three more stages of the Umiam Project were subsequently built downstream.http://india- wris.nrsc.gov.in/wrpinfo/index.php?title=Umiam_Stage_-_I_Power_House_PH00820 Tourist destination The lake serves as a major tourist attraction for the state of Meghalaya.

Umiam Lake Ecological effect Apart from storing water for electricity generation, the lake also provides numerous ecosystem services at micro, meso and macro levels. Downstream irrigation, fisheries, and drinking water cater to local anthropogenic needs. Toxic threat and silting Due to the rising population of Shillong upstream of the lake, the lake is starting to become highly polluted. Also, there is the heavy problem of silting. An estimated of silt enters Umiam Lake every year. Causes range between upstream encroachments, deforestation, blockage of natural drainage systems, and unscientific mining et al. in the catchment area. Excessive silt load in the lake has lowered the storage.

Thompson (born ca. 1950) is a Wisconsin civil servant who was wrongfully convicted of federal corruption charges in 2006, then exonerated by an appeals court in 2007. Thompson is a Madison native, and graduated from Madison East High School in 1968. She was one of ten children; her father was a painter for the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison, and her mother was a janitor for the Department of Administration. She worked in the travel industry for 27 years, and lived in Waunakee. Thompson was hired in 2001 into the civil service by the state Department of Administration, when Republican Scott McCallum was Governor. Thompson was described as \\"apolitical\\", hard- working, and \\"intensely private\\". Travel contract controversy In 2005, Thompson was on a panel considering competitive bids for a state travel contract worth up to $250,000 annually over three years. The contract was awarded to Adelman Travel, whose bid was lower than the other finalist, Omega Travel of Virginia, although Omega's bid scored higher on a point formula used by the department. It emerged that during the 2006 re-election campaign of Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle, two Adelman executives including owner Craig Adelman had each contributed $10,000 to the Doyle campaign, even though in previous years, including Doyle's first gubernatorial campaign, they had never given more than $1,000. In January 2006, Thompson was indicted on charges that she steered the contract to Adelman as a reward for its campaign contributions. According to the indictment, Thompson \\"intentionally inflated her scores for Adelman and suggested that other committee members do the same.\\" After Omega still came out ahead, the indictment said, Thompson convinced the panel to do a \\"best and final\\" bid round between just the two companies, which Adelman won. Thompson was indicted on two felony counts, misapplication of funds and fraud. Later that month, Gov. Doyle cancelled the Adelman contract, but the campaign did not return the contributions. In June 2006, a federal jury convicted Thompson of both felony counts. According to United States Attorney Steven Biskupic, although there was no \\"pay to play\\" deal alleged, the contributions were part of an overall scheme that constituted honest services fraud. Trial testimony showed that Doyle and his aide Marc Marotta had meetings and phone contacts with Adelman executives during the bidding period; according to Doyle's top aide Steve Bablitch, no connection with the Governor was shown at trial. Members of the committee also testified that Thompson had told them that the contract needed to go to Adelman for \\"political reasons.\\" Doyle and Marotta were not charged. According to Doyle, Thompson acted on her own, and prosecutor Biskupic said the case was about \\"Georgia Thompson and Georgia Thompson alone.\\" Thompson had resigned her position before Doyle could fire her. Although Thompson faced a maximum of 20 years in federal prison, she was sentenced by U.S. District Judge Rudolph T. Randa to 18 months. The conviction led to heated charges in the 2006 gubernatorial campaign, with Republican candidate Mark Green proposing ethical reforms if elected and pro-Green political groups running television ads criticizing Doyle and tying him to Thompson. Democratic Party state chair Joe Wineke called the attacks \\"dishonest\\" and \\"hypocritical\\" and said that they were an attempt to distract voters from campaign contribution problems of Green. =Conviction reversed= A panel of judges from the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit immediately reversed Thompson's conviction on hearing oral arguments in the case on April 5, 2007. Without waiting until completion of a written decision, the judges ordered that Thompson be released from Federal Correctional Institution, Pekin in Pekin, Illinois without delay. Judge Diane Wood called the prosecution's evidence \\"beyond thin.\\" During oral arguments, the judges had pointedly questioned the Assistant U.S. Attorney defending the appeal, asking why Doyle or Adelman were not prosecuted, one asking, \\"Am I missing something?\\" Of the bid-scoring formula, another opined, \\"Because they flunked high school math doesn't mean a felony was committed.\\" Gov. Doyle, on hearing the news, said she was entitled to her job back, and said he looked forward to meeting her for the first time. According to her attorney, the prosecution and conviction cost Thompson over $300,000, including lost pay, her savings, her condo, and her pension, which she cashed in to pay for her legal defense. Democrats asked whether U.S. Attorney Biskupic was pressured by the White House or the Justice Department to prosecute Democrats, as other U.S. Attorneys allegedly were in the Bush administration Dismissal of U.S. attorneys controversy. Jurors defended their verdict, and some Democrats, including former Wisconsin Attorney General Peg Lautenschlager, who conducted a parallel investigation, said that Biskupic was not politically motivated. Thompson made no statement to the media. On April 10, Congresswoman Tammy Baldwin of Madison called on her colleagues to investigate the Thompson case as part of the overall U.S. Attorneys dismissal controversy. The Senate Judiciary Committee delivered a letter to United States Attorney General Alberto Gonzales asking for documents in the case. The Court of Appeals issued its written opinion in United States v. Thompson on April 20, 2007. The Wisconsin Department of Administration also announced that Thompson had been reinstated at her old salary but in a different job, and she would receive back pay dating from her resignation. She would also be eligible for reimbursement for legal expenses, but she would have to file a claim. By March 5, 2008, both houses of the state legislature voted without dissent to reimburse Thompson $228,792 in legal expenses.Marley, Patrick. \\"Payment OK'd for Georgia Thompson,\\" Journal Sentinel Online NewsWatch March 6, 2008, 1:11 a.m.  Awards and recognition  In 2008, after returning to her state job, Thompson was recognized with an Honorable Mention for the Virginia Hart Special Recognition Award from the Office of State Employee Relations, a privately funded award given each year \\"for exemplary performance and contribution to the citizens of the state.\\" See also *List of wrongful convictions in the United States References External links * Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals decision issued April 20, 2007 Category:1950 births Category:Living people Category:American civil servants Category:People from Madison, Wisconsin Category:Overturned convictions in the United States Category:People from Waunakee, Wisconsin Category:Madison East High School alumni ","title":"Georgia Thompson"},{"id":"10529586","title":"Victor Cha"},{"id":"10529600","text":"Ahisamakh (, lit.

It is well known for its collection of Southern California-style homes. The 174-home neighborhood got its start when a builder from California, Gustav Weber, filed plans to build a small subdivision in 1928. The homes were built in pastel colors with flat roofs, similar to Spanish-style homes in the Los Angeles area. Streets were named Los Angeles, San Diego, Pasadena and San Gabriel. However, one of Weber's problems was that the neighborhood landscaping and hardscaping features were not built to cope with the Northeastern winters. Plants native to Southern California and Moravian tile sidewalks were included in his plans. The plants died in the cold. The tile cracked and was replaced by concrete. As a result, modifications were made to the area after it was built. The neighborhood was never finished according to Weber's plans. Possible reasons ranged from the 1929 stock market crash to an unfaithful wife. A local developer finished the development in the 1940s.Landscape Change in Hollywood, Pennsylvania, Wayne Brew The Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission has listed the area as eligible for national registry.

There has been confusion about the various components of NGC 2366 and its neighbouring galaxy NGC 2363. At the southern end of NGC 2366 is the large, luminous HII region known as Markarian 71 (Mrk 71). To the west of Mrk 71 is another dwarf galaxy NGC 2363 which is interacting with NGC 2366. Corwins' notes remarks that there are two galaxies with two NGC numbers clearly attached to each one. \\"We shall just have to get used to calling the HII region \\"Markarian 71\\" (or one of its other names) since it is not N2363 as we've thought all these years.\\" Within the region known as Mrk 71, there are two super star clusters (SSC) which are named 'A' and 'B' or 'Knot A' and 'Knot B'. Other names for the above components include: NGC 2366-I, NGC 2366-II, NGC 2366-III, NGC2366-A, NGC 2366-B, NGC 2366-C, NGC 2363-A, NGC 2363-B. NGC 2366 is an outlying member of the M81 Group. Super star clusters within Mrk 71 HST view of NGC 2366 NGC/Mrk71 is home to numerous young, gigantic blue stars, which in gas-rich star-forming regions, emit ultraviolet radiation that excites the hydrogen gas, making it glow. At a distance of approximately 10 million light years, it is close enough for astronomers to discern its individual stars. Within Mrk 71 there are two super star clusters which will be referred to as Mrk 71 knot A (Knot A) and Mrk 71 knot B (Knot B). Knot A has total stellar mass of approximately 1.3‚Äì1.4 x 10^5 solar masses. The absence of Wolf-Rayet stars in its spectra might well indicate that its age is no more than 3 Myrs, while an age of less than 1 Myr is given in a study by Drissen et al. 2000. Knot A hosts a massive, enshrouded SSC in which no stellar features have been confirmed and that is still in its natal cloud. The hydrogen alpha luminosity measurement for Mrk 71, of which 90% is produced by Knot A, is given as 8.4 x 10^39 ergs/s in a study by James et al. 2016. Knot A might well contain 'very massive stars' (VMS), which are O-type supergiants of 150-300 solar masses. These have short lifespans of 1-3 Myr and have been suggested as a reason why there are extreme stellar temperatures. Knot B has a lower mass of 1.5 x 10^4 solar masses and an estimated age of 3‚Äì5 Myrs. UV spectral synthesis leads to the conclusion that there are approximately 800 B and 40 O stars present. Studies indicate that there might be up to 8 Wolf-Rayet stars present, which would set the age between 3‚Äì5 Myrs. A superbubble appears to have been generated with strong shell morphology to the east and a blow-out region to the north, with expansion velocities of approximately 20 km/s. This is consistent with the substantial mechanical feedback generated by a massive, somewhat evolved SSC. The Nearest Green Pea Analog In August 2017, a study was published in The Astrophysical Journal called: \\"Mrk 71/NGC 2366: The Nearest Green Pea Analog\\". This examines the links between NGC 2366 and the so-called Green Pea galaxies (GPs), some of which have recently been shown to be Lyman Continuum Emitters (LCEs). It presents a remarkable and serendipitous discovery that NGC 2366 is an excellent analog of the GPs. As NGC 2366 is located only 10 million light years away, it might provide a local example of an LCE. Finding LCEs is crucial in the study of the Big Bang, as Lyman continuum photons (LyC) emissions are thought to be a mechanism for the reionisation of the Universe. 5 'extreme' GPs have recently been shown to be viable LCEs, with a LyC escape fraction of between 6-13%. This discovery doubled the number of low-redshift star-forming LCEs, which have been notoriously hard to detect. Table 1 in Micheva et al. compares various properties of 'average' and 'extreme' GPs with NGC 2366/Mrk 71 using the wealth of existing data. Some examples are: i) The temperature of [OIII] (highly ionised oxygen) in extreme GPs is given as approximately 13,400 ‚Äì 15500 K, compared with values of between 14,000 and 16,000 K for the Mrk 71 components. ii) An extremely high equivalent width for [OIII] is shown in Knot A of 224.3 + or ‚àí 34.5 nm, compared with values of 80‚Äì200 nm for extreme GPs. iii) The ratio of oxygen to hydrogen, which gives a value for an object's metallicity, is 7.89 in NGC 2263/MRK 71 and between 7.76-8.04 for extreme GPs. The study concludes that NGC2366/Mrk 71 offers an unprecedentedly detailed look at the morphology and physical conditions of a potential LyC emitter, suggesting that LCEs might be numerous and commonplace. Dense CO in Mrk 71-A A study named: \\"Dense CO in Mrk 71-A: Superwind Suppressed in a Young Super Star Cluster\\" was published in the Astrophysical Journal Letters in November 2017.

Household Tales \\"Our Lady's Child\\" Notes Synopsis A poor couple had a baby girl. They wished to have the child christened, but could not pay the parson's fees. At last, the father found a beautiful lady who offered to get the child christened, but said that she would keep her as her own child afterwards. The father spoke to his wife about it, and his wife refused, but when the beautiful lady made the same offer the next day, his wife agreed that they should accept if they could not find anyone else. The child was christened, and the lady then took her home and treated her kindly. When the girl was old enough to know right from wrong, the lady left, forbidding her to go into certain rooms. The girl looked into one, and a star sprang out. Her foster mother was angry with her, but at her pleading, let her stay. The next time the foster mother went away, she opened the second door, and the moon sprang out. Again, the angry foster mother was appeased by the girl, but the third time, when she let out the sun, the foster mother insisted that the girl had to leave. Furthermore, she could speak and be ugly or be beautiful and mute. She chose to be beautiful. She wandered in the woods until nightfall, when she climbed a tree over water and slept there. Several female servants sent from the castle to fetch water saw her reflection, thought it was their own, and decided they were too beautiful to fetch water. Finally, the prince went himself, realized she was there, and coaxed her down to be his queen. His mother objected, arguing the girl could not speak and might be a witch. Nevertheless, he married her. When she was to have her first child, the prince set a watch about her, but they all fell asleep, and the foster mother came, took the baby, and smeared the queen's mouth with blood, saying she would be sorry as her foster mother had been when she let out the star. Everyone thought she had killed and eaten the child, and the prince's mother would have had her burned if the prince had not pleaded for her. The same thing happened the second time, though the watch was twice as strong; the foster mother decreed that the girl would be as sorry as the foster mother had been when she had let out the Moon. The third time, the watch was three times as strong, the foster mother decreed that she would be as sorry as the foster mother when she let out the Sun, and the prince was unable to save her. But when they were leading her to the fire, the foster mother reappeared with the children, restoring them to their parents, said that the girl had been sufficiently punished, revealed that she was the Virgin Mary, and restored her speech. Thereafter they lived happily, and even the prince's mother grew to love the young queen.

It was caused by an incident at the finals of the 1972 world men's curling championship, the 1972 Air Canada Silver Broom in Garmisch- Partenkirchen, Germany. History =Incident= The Canadian team, skipped by Orest Meleschuk was playing the American team skipped by Robert LaBonte in the finals. Canada had been undefeated up until this point, but was down by two points in the last end. They needed two points to tie the game. Meleschuk had the \\"hammer\\", the final shot of the end. When it was time for him to shoot, the Americans had shot rock on the button while Canada was sitting second shot right next to it. The U.S. was sitting third rock with a rock biting the 8-foot. To tie the game, Meleschuk had to hit the American rock and not roll further than this third rock. Meleschuk's rock made the hit, and it proceeded to roll into the 8-foot. When it stopped, it was close to being second, but the Americans thought otherwise, and U.S. third Frank Aasand jumped in the air to celebrate. In the meantime, Canada's third Dave Romano was still investigating which rock was second rock, and thus whether or not Canada had scored two to tie, or just one for the loss. While Romano was looking, LaBonte jumped in the air to celebrate as well, but slipped and accidentally kicked the Canadian stone. Romano had still not agreed on who was shot, and since LaBonte had kicked the rock closer than the American rock, Canada was awarded two points in the end. Canada then stole another point in the extra end to win the championship after LaBonte was heavy with a draw for the win. =Curse= It was later said that LaBonte put a \\"curse\\" on Canada, because Canada did not win another World Championship until 1980. Canadian journalist Larry Tucker is generally considered to have been given credit for inventing the hex in 1980 to describe Canada's victory that year. A secondary \\"curse\\", if interpreted in this way, is that a North Dakotan rink did not represent the United States again in the World Curling Championships until 1997, when Craig Disher of Langdon represented the United States. =Meleschuk's cigarette= Over time, the incident gained additional notoriety, due to being extensively replayed, because Meleschuk had delivered the crucial shot with a lit cigarette prominently dangling from his mouth. Due to curling's roots as a social game, it had long been associated with both alcohol and tobacco consumption, and even at elite levels of play smoking on the ice was neither prohibited nor widely frowned on. Over time, as both medical and public opinion turned increasingly against smoking, the governing bodies of curling came under pressure to clean up the game's image. In Canada, this effort was complicated by the fact its national men's championship had been sponsored by MacDonald Tobacco since its inception in 1927. Finally, in 1980, Macdonald was replaced as a sponsor (albeit by a major brewery, Labatt) and smoking on the ice was banned starting with the 1980 Labatt Brier - coincidentally or not, the same year the Curse of LaBonte was broken. Meleschuk himself later recalled that curlers were often reluctant to leave their cigarettes in an ashtray in order to deliver their shots for economic reasons - such cigarettes would often go out before they could be retrieved, rendering them unpalatable. However, he later admitted he felt \\"embarrassed\\" after seeing replays of himself smoking while delivering his famous shot, and quit smoking as a result.

He played college football at Clemson University. Early years Cone grew up in Pine Apple, Alabama, with a population around 100. He attended Moore Academy, a one-room school from kindergarten through high school. He didn't play football because there weren't enough people to field a team. Before going to college, he enlisted in the U.S. Army to take part of World War II, where he served in the Pacific as part of the 11th Airborne Division. College career When he returned to the United States in the summer of 1946, he read a newspaper advertisement about tryouts at Auburn University and decided to attend. His participation was cut short with an ankle injury that forced him to return home. During his recovery, a family friend turned out to be the sister of Frank Howard, the head coach at Clemson College. She helped Cone get a tryout and eventually he was able to make the team and receive a scholarship. As a sophomore, Cone was the starting fullback in a backfield that included Ray Mathews. The 1948 team accomplished a 10-0 undefeated season and beat the University of Missouri, 24‚Äì23, in the 1949 Gator Bowl. He scored two first-quarter touchdowns and had a critical fourth down conversion late in the game. He finished as the team's leading rusher with 635 yards and 7 touchdowns. As a junior, he registered 703 rushing yards and 9 touchdowns. As a senior, his 184 carries for 845 rushing yards, 15 touchdowns and 92 points at the time were all school season records. He also was a part of another undefeated season and against Auburn University, he rushed for 163 yards and scored 4 touchdowns. He played in the 1951 Orange Bowl, beating the University of Miami 15‚Äì14. He gained 81 rushing yards, scored one of the touchdowns, returned one kickoff and had 4 punts. Cone finished his college career with eight 100-yard career rushing games, 31 touchdowns and 189 points. He also was a kickoff specialist. In 1973, he was inducted into the State of South Carolina Athletic Hall of Fame and the Clemson Athletic Hall of Fame. He is a member of Clemson‚Äôs Ring of Honor. Professional career =Green Bay Packers= Cone was selected by the Green Bay Packers in the third round (27th overall) of the 1951 NFL draft. He was used as a fullback and placekicker. As a rookie, he led the team with 50 points, and was the second-leading rusher with 56 carries for 190 yards (3.4-yard average). He also made 5 of 7 field goal attempts and 29 of 35 extra points. Cone led the Packers in scoring in five of the next six seasons, including leading the league with 16 field goals made in 1955. In 1956, he announced his retirement, but was convinced by the team to return to play. In 1957, he was a part of the inaugural game at Lambeau Field, then known as City Stadium, contributing to an upset of the Chicago Bears 21-17, before a crowd of 32,132 people. He finished the season by leading his team in scoring with 74 points. Cone played for the Packers during a low point in the franchise history, never experiencing a winning season, which cost him the opportunity to earn more accolades for his play. In 1974, he was inducted into the Green Bay Packers Hall of Fame. =Dallas Cowboys= On May 12, 1960, he was signed as a free agent by the Dallas Cowboys after being out of football for two years, while coaching at University Military School in Mobile Alabama. He became the first starter at placekicker in franchise history. He also was a backup fullback and reunited with former college teammate Ray Mathews. He retired after the season. Personal life In his first two years in the NFL, he worked for the Packers during the offseason promoting season-ticket sales. He later accepted a job promoting beer with the Miller Brewing Company. He was an assistant football coach at the University Military School in Mobile, Alabama. In 1961, he joined the Clemson football coaching staff.

Career  Brass collected plant specimens for the Queensland Herbarium from the 1930s to the 1960s, as well as participating in several international expeditions to New Guinea, the Solomon Islands and Africa. Grave of Dr Leonard Brass in Cairns Martyn Street Cemetery From 1939 to 1966 Brass was an associate curator of the Archbold Expedition collections with the American Museum of Natural History. He was associated with the Archbold Biological Station at Lake Placid, Florida, for which he helped to formulate the organizational structure it has today, and also where he lived between expeditions. In the course of his many expeditions to New Guinea he was a major collector of plant specimens for the Arnold Arboretum in Massachusetts. He was especially interested in the relationship between the floras of Australia and New Guinea. Brass was director of field operations for an expedition in 1949‚Äì50 to tropical Africa, sponsored by the Upjohn and Penick companies, to find precursors for the manufacture of cortisone. Later he was an advisor to an Arnold Arboretum study to search for medical plants in the western Pacific, as well as serving on a National Science Foundation panel regarding botanical study of the islands of the Indian Ocean. Brass served in the Canadian army during the Second World War, became a naturalised citizen of the United States in 1947 and received an honorary doctorate from Florida State University at Tallahassee in 1962.

This enzyme has also been implicated in additional pentose and glucuronate interconversions. In Cupriavidus metallidurans two copies of the gene coding for PPE are known, one is chromosomally encoded , the other one is on a plasmid . PPE has been found in a wide range of bacteria, archaebacteria, fungi and plants. All the proteins have from 209 to 241 amino acid residues. The enzyme has a TIM barrel structure.  Nomenclature  The systematic name of this enzyme class is D-ribulose-5-phosphate 3-epimerase. Other names in common use include * phosphoribulose epimerase, * erythrose-4-phosphate isomerase, * phosphoketopentose 3-epimerase, * xylulose phosphate 3-epimerase, * phosphoketopentose epimerase, * ribulose 5-phosphate 3-epimerase, * D-ribulose phosphate-3-epimerase, * D-ribulose 5-phosphate wpimerase, * D-ribulose-5-P 3-epimerase, * D-xylulose-5-phosphate 3-epimerase, and * pentose-5-phosphate 3-epimerase. This enzyme participates in 3 metabolic pathways: pentose phosphate pathway, pentose and glucuronate interconversions, and carbon fixation. The human protein containing this domain is the RPE (gene).  Family  Phosphopentose epimerase belongs to two protein families of increasing hierarchy. This enzyme belongs to the isomerase family, specifically those racemases and epimerases which act on carbohydrates and their derivatives. In addition, the Structural Classification of Proteins database has defined the ‚Äúribulose phosphate binding‚Äù superfamily for which this epimerase is a member. Other proteins included in this superfamily are 5‚Äò-monophosphate decarboxylase (OMPDC), and 3-keto-l-gulonate 6-phosphate decarboxylase (KGPDC).  Structure  As of late 2007, 4 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , , and . = Overall = Crystallographic studies have helped elucidate the apoenzyme structure of phosphopentose epimerase. Results of these studies have shown that this enzyme exists as a homodimer in solution. Furthermore, Phosphopentose epimerase folds into a (Œ≤/Œ±)8 triosephosphate isomerase (TIM) barrel that includes loops. The core barrel is composed of 8 parallel strands that make up the central beta sheet, with helices located in between consecutive strands. The loops in this structure have been known to regulate substrate specificities. Specifically, the loop that connects helix Œ±6 with strand Œ≤6 caps the active site upon binding of the substrate. As previously mentioned, Phosphopentose epimerase is a metalloenzyme. It requires a cofactor for functionality and binds one divalent metal cation per subunit. This enzyme has been shown to use Zn2+ predominantly for catalysis, along with Co2+ and Mn2+. However, human phosphopentose epimerase ‚Äì which is encoded by the RPE gene - differs in that it binds Fe2+ predominantly in catalysis. Fe2+ is octahedrally coordinated and stabilizes the 2,3-enediolate reaction intermediate observed in the figure. = Active site = The Œ≤6/Œ±6 loop region interacts with the substrate and regulates access to the active site. Phe147, Gly148, and Ala149 of this region cap the active site once binding has occurred. In addition, the Fe2+ ion is coordinated to His35, His70, Asp37, Asp175, and oxygens O2 and O3 of the substrate. The binding of substrate atoms to the iron cation helps stabilize the complex during catalysis. Mutagenesis studies have also indicated that two aspartic acids are located within the active site and help mediate catalysis through a 1,1-proton transfer reaction. The aspartic acids are the acid/base catalysts. Lastly, once the ligand is attached to the active site, a series of methionines (Met39, Met72, and Met141) restrict further movement through constriction.  Mechanism  This is a mechanism by which phosphopentose epimerase converts ribulose 5-phosphate to xylulose 5-phosphate. The intermediate in 2,3-trans-enediolate. Phosphopentose utilizes an acid/base type of catalytic mechanism. The reaction proceeds in such a way that trans-2,3-enediol phosphate is the intermediate. The two aspartic acids mentioned above act as proton donors and acceptors. Asp37 and Asp175 are both hydrogen bonded to the iron cation in the active site. When Asp37 is deprotonated, it attacks a proton on the third carbon of D-ribulose 5-phosphate, which forms the intermediate. In a concerted step, as Asp37 grabs a proton, the carbonyl bond on the substrate grabs a second proton from Asp175 to form a hydroxyl group. The iron complex helps stabilize any additional charges. It is C3 of D-ribulose 5-phosphate which undergoes this epimerization, forming D-xylulose 5-phosphate. The mechanism is clearly demonstrated in the figure.  Function  = Calvin cycle = Electron microscopy experiments in plants have shown that phosphopentose epimerase localizes to the thylakoid membrane of chloroplasts. This epimerase participates in the third phase of the Calvin cycle, which involves the regeneration of ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate. RuBP is the acceptor of the carbon dioxide (CO2) in the first step of the pathway, which suggests that phosphopentose epimerase regulates flux through the Calvin cycle. Without the regeneration of ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate, the cycle will be unable to continue. Therefore, xylulose 5-phosphate is reversibly converted into ribulose 5-phosphate by this epimerase. Subsequently, phosphoribulose kinase converts ribulose 5-phosphate into ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate. = Pentose phosphate pathway = The reactions of the pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) take place in the cytoplasm. Phosphopentose epimerase specifically affects the nonoxidative portion of the pathway, which involves the production of various sugars and precursors. This enzyme converts ribulose 5-phosphate into the appropriate epimer for the transketolase reaction, xylulose 5-phosphate. Therefore, the reaction that occurs in the pentose phosphate pathway is exactly the reverse of the reaction which occurs in the Calvin cycle. The mechanism remains the same and involves the formation of an enediolate intermediate. Due to its involvement in this pathway, phosphopentose epimerase is an important enzyme for the cellular response to oxidative stress. The generation of NADPH by the pentose phosphate pathway helps protect cells against reactive oxygen species. NADPH is able to reduce glutathione, which detoxifies the body by producing water from hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Therefore, not only does phosphopentose epimerase alter flux through the PPP, but it also prevents buildup of peroxides.  Evolution  The structures of many phosphopentose epimerase analogs have been discovered through crystallographic studies. Due to its role in the Calvin cycle and the pentose phosphate pathway, the overall structure is conserved. When the sequences of evolutionarily-distant organisms were compared, greater than 50% similarity was observed. However, amino acids positioned at the dimer interface ‚Äì which are involved in many intermolecular interactions ‚Äì are not necessarily conserved. It is important to note that the members of the ‚Äúribulose phosphate binding‚Äù superfamily resulted from divergent evolution from a (Œ≤/Œ±)8 \\\\- barrel ancestor.  Drug targeting and malaria  The protozoan organism Plasmodium falciparum is a major causative agent of malaria. Phosphopentose epimerase has been implicated in the shikimate pathway, an essential pathway for the propagation of malaria. As the enzyme converts ribulose 5-phosphate into xylulose 5-phosphate, the latter is further metabolized into erythrose 4-phosphate. The shikimate pathway then converts erythrose 4-phosphate into chorismate. It is phosphopentose epimerase which allows Plasmodium falciparum to use erythorse 4-phosphate as a substrate. Due to this enzyme‚Äôs involvement in the shikimate pathway, phosphopentose epimerase is a potential drug target for developing antimalarials.

A loyal legate who expected to be awarded a consulship for his part in Sulla's campaign, he was executed when he tried to defy his master's dictate. Career Ofella was one of Sulla's legates during Sulla's second march on Rome. Apparently a trusted and talented general, Sulla entrusted the siege of Praeneste to him during the campaign, confident that Ofella could defeat Marius the Younger, trapped inside the city's walls. Ofella settled down to await the city's eventual surrender, confident that Sulla would win the rest of the campaign. During the Battle of the Colline Gate, the left wing of Sulla's army collapsed, and many of them fled all the way to Praeneste, panicked, shouting fearfully that Sulla was dead, Rome in the possession of the enemy, and that the siege of Praeneste must be lifted so they could all retreat. Ofella chose to stand pat, certain Sulla had not lost the battle. This proved the correct decision, as Sulla, ably assisted by Marcus Licinius Crassus, had won the battle and the city. Sulla, in control of the city and the Senate, forced them to appoint him dictator and continued his campaign to crush the last pockets of resistance. Ofella soon forced the surrender of Praeneste and presented his master with the head of the younger Marius. Sulla decided to dispense with elections during his dictatorship, selecting which candidates were to be elected. During the first of these mock elections, he passed over Ofella. Outraged, Ofella began to canvass for the consulship on his own, gathering support. Sulla attempted to stop him, but when Ofella entered the Forum with a large party, Sulla gave up. He sent one of his centurions down to execute Ofella. The centurion followed his orders to the letter and was seized by the crowd. Dragging the centurion to Sulla's tribunal atop the temple of Castor and Pollux, where the dictator had watched the deed carried out, the crowd demanded Sulla condemn the man. Sulla shrugged off the crowd, bidding them stop their noise, bluntly informing them that he had ordered the task to be done, and that the crowd release his centurion. He concluded his admonition with a cautionary tale: \\"The lice were very troublesome to a clown, as he was ploughing. Twice he stopped his ploughing and purged his jacket. But he was still bitten, and in order that he might not be hindered in his work, he burnt the jacket; and I advise those who have been twice humbled not to make fire necessary the third time.\\" See also * Lucretia (gens) External links *Plutarch's Life of Sulla Category:1st-century BC Romans Category:Senators of the Roman Republic Category:Ancient Roman generals Category:Executed ancient Roman people Category:People executed by the Roman Republic Category:1st- century BC executions Category:Year of birth unknown Ofella, Quintus ","title":"Quintus Lucretius Ofella"},{"id":"10529974","text":"Thomas William Brown (born December 12, 1940) is a former professional football player and major league baseball player. Brown briefly played for the Washington Senators of the American League early in the 1963 season, and then was a defensive back in the National Football League for six seasons with the Green Bay Packers and Washington Redskins. He played college football at the University of Maryland in College Park, where he also played for the baseball team. Early years Born in Laureldale, Pennsylvania, Brown graduated from Montgomery Blair High School in Silver Spring, Maryland, a suburb north of Washington, D.C. He then went to the University of Maryland in nearby College Park and played both baseball and football for the Terrapins. Baseball career Brown played outfield and first base for the Washington Senators in 1963. A switch hitter who threw left-handed, he was signed to a minor league contract in late February, played extremely well in spring training, batting .312, and earned a spot on the major league team. In the regular season, Brown batted a meek .147 in 61 games (23 as a starter), with 17 hits in 118 at bats, one home run, and four runs batted in. Sent down to the minors, he played parts of two seasons (1963‚Äì1964) in the Senators' farm system with the York White Roses of the Class AA Eastern League; in 470 at bats, he batted .223 with eight home runs and 47 RBI. He was recalled up to the big club in September 1963, when he hit his sole homer. Brown left the York team in early July 1964, after signing with the Green Bay Packers. Football career Brown was selected in the second round (28th overall) of the 1963 NFL draft by the Packers, and twentieth overall in the AFL draft by the Buffalo Bills. After his stint in baseball with the Senators, he played defensive back for Green Bay from 1964 through 1968 and for the Washington Redskins in 1969. In the 1966 NFL title game at the Cotton Bowl in Dallas, Brown intercepted a fourth- down pass in the end zone by quarterback Don Meredith in the final minute, preserving the Packers' 34‚Äì27 victory over the Cowboys. He was part of the Packers' unprecedented three consecutive NFL championship teams under Vince Lombardi which concluded with victories in the first two Super Bowls. He was traded to Washington in February 1969, the first trade by new Redskins head coach Lombardi. Brown played in only one game for the Redskins, the opener against New Orleans, and then had shoulder surgery. He was waived by the team in late August 1970, a week prior to Lombardi's death from cancer. Brown finished his NFL career with 13 interceptions and six fumble recoveries, including one for a touchdown, and also returned 27 punts and 7 kickoffs. His head coach for five seasons was Lombardi, four in Green Bay and one in Washington; the exception was in 1968, after Lombardi stepped down and was succeeded by Phil Bengtson. Brown led the Packers that season with four interceptions. Personal life From 1989 to 2015, Brown ran a little league in Salisbury, Maryland for children ages 5‚Äì12 called Tom Brown's Rookie League. The league was open to many ages. The sports included in the league were flag football, baseball and basketball.

Hart The John B. Stetson Company, founded by John B. Stetson in 1865, was the maker of the Stetson cowboy hats, but ceased manufacturing in 1970.Snyder, Jeffrey B. (1997) Stetson Hats and the John B. Stetson Company 1865‚Äì1970 1997 pg57 Stetson hats are now being manufactured in Garland, Texas, by Hatco, Inc., who also produce Resistol and Charlie 1 Horse hats.Snyder, Jeffrey B. (1997) Stetson Hats and the John B. Stetson Company 1865‚Äì1970, 1997, p. 71, Stetson resumed manufacturing in the 1980s, but the company went bankrupt in 1986. The factory equipment and the license to manufacture Stetson hats was purchased by Hat Brands, a company owned by Irving Joel.  History  The John B. Stetson Company was established in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in 1865 when John B. Stetson decided to mass-produce a hat like one he had fashioned for himself out of necessity during a lengthy Western expedition. Stetson's Boss of the Plains, with its high crown and wide flat brim, became the prototype for all other cowboy hat designs. A factory in St. Joseph, Missouri produced Stetson hats until parent company, Hatco Inc., closed it in 2004. The second factory in Galveston, Texas, continue to turn out the \\"Boss of the Plains,\\" along with over 100 variations for men and women.Kristin Palm Stetson Hat MadeHow website Retrieved August 7, 2007. = The early years = The Philadelphia factory, incorporated in 1891, produced dress hats for both women and men. Employing over 5,000 workers in various departments, the company turned out more hats than any other during the early 20th century. The Stetson Company was considered especially innovative for its time. The production of high-quality hat boxes became associated with the Stetson name. These hat boxes depicted Christmas imagery or famous Philadelphia institutions.Susan M. Ryan, \\"John B. Stetson: A Hatter Legacy\\" (paper prepared for the Academic Affairs Committee, Stetson University Board of Trustees, 2016). The Company also spread its reputation using marketing techniques and the recording of industrial films promoting its process and product. Hats and copies of the film Birth of a Hat, produced by the Company itself and showing the hat-making process, were distributed to merchants and popular conventions where feedback was recorded and used to make future product. The first significant change in the Company occurred after John B. Stetson's death in February 1906. His position as President of the Company was filled by J. Howell Cummings. = The later years = Stetson sales declined dramatically in the 1950s and 1960s. Between 1947 and 1968, revenues sharply dropped from around 29 million dollars to about 8 million dollars. Members of John B. Stetson's family eventually decided to sell company stock, Ira Guilden, who controlled Ramco Enterprises Inc., came into conflict with the Stetson family although by 1968, he would have majority interest in the Stetson Company. In the early 1970s, the factory in Philadelphia shut down. Even though the clock tower, gymnasium, auditorium, and fitting room were saved from destruction, they burned down in 1980.  Paternalism  John B. Stetson quickly gained a reputation as an employer driven by religious morals. He ran the Stetson Company in a paternalistic fashion designed to provide benefits for workers, increase profits, and discourage unionization. The Stetson Company provided many benefits for the time such as prizes, Christmas bonuses, shared stock, pensions, and membership to a building association as well as access to Stetson facilities. These facilities serviced several aspects of an employee's life. In the early 1900s, Stetson added a company library, dentist, hospital, auditorium, and athletic fields for recreational use. The John B. Stetson Building Association assisted over 1,000 employees to purchase homes, and over 2,000 children of employees attended Sunday School or Kindergarten on company grounds. One of the most anticipated events at the Company surrounded the Christmas holiday. Employees gathered at the factory auditorium for an annual celebration that featured speeches from the Company President or Santa Claus, and a distribution of awards, bonuses, and gifts. These gifts and awards varied according to one's position at the Company. Women received candy and gloves, married men received a Christmas turkey, and unmarried men were given hats.  Employees  Many Stetson employees were immigrant hat-makers with reputations of moving around where work was plentiful. The Stetson Company, to encourage yearlong work and a high retention rate, offered immigrants a portion of annual earnings as a Christmas bonus, increasing each successive year. Some of these immigrant workers were able to become U.S. citizens, partly due to the \\"Americanization\\" classes the Company offered that offered English among other subjects. Highly specialized positions in the factory utilized the apprentice system. Those recruited to an apprenticeship signed contracts valid until they had reached eighteen years old or completed three years of work. While under contract, they agreed to abstain from gambling or marriage. Pay was two dollars per week with an additional dollar for every week worked after the contract was fulfilled. Many apprentices became full-time employees and had the potential to become a foreman due to their loyalty to the Stetson brand. = Unions = John B. Stetson's tradition of providing annual bonuses, Christmas gifts, and facilities for employees were an active attempt to dissuade unions. However, there was a sizable number of union workers at the Philadelphia factory during the early 1900s. They were ordered to leave the factory by their union and work at shops instead. Some of these workers demanded to stay on until Christmas when they received their bonuses and this was generally allowed. However, the attraction of an end of year bonus was so great that many returned to the factory as non-union workers.  Stetson in popular culture  The Stetson has become \\"a symbol of Western pride and bravado, this hat, with its large crown and wide brim, has graced the heads of America's most treasured Western heroes, from old-time favorites like actors John Wayne, Clayton Moore as the Lone Ranger, Timothy Olyphant, as Raylan Givens and country singer Gene Autry, to modern-day popular artists like Garth Brooks and Larry Hagman as J.R. Ewing on the television series Dallas.\\" J.R.'s hat is now displayed in the Smithsonian National Museum of American History's contemporary Americana exhibit. Furthermore, the Stetson hat has also been worn by prominent country singers from Dale Evans to Trisha Yearwood, spurred on by legendary female maverick Annie Oakley, proving \\"that females can carry off this most essential Western look, too.\\" In 2006, when visiting the White House, President of South Sudan, Salva Kiir received a black stetson as a gift from the then-U.S. President George W. Bush. He reportedly liked it so much that he purchased several. He now seldom makes public appearances without a black cowboy hat.

He was noticed by many NBA scouts, but was never offered a contract by any team. When Benson left California, he started the 2006-2007 NBDL year with the Austin Toros. He had a game high of eight points on November 25, but averaged 2.4 points per game and was released by the team on January 3, 2007.

After three months of preparation in his home of California Rod Benson was picked up by the team of Bank of Taiwan of the Taiwanese Super Basketball League in December 2014. Having played just five games in the SBL, averaging 18 points and 11 rebounds, Rod Benson signed a deal with GlobalPort Batang Pier of the Philippine Basketball Association (PBA) in early January 2015.

In his first game after the short hiatus he scored 8 points, 9 rebounds and 2 assists in 25 minutes.  Art  After retiring from basketball in 2018, Benson began painting. Painting was one of the hobbies he took on to fill his new found free time, but he didn't take himself seriously as a fine artist. It wasn't until July 2018 when that began to change. While out one night in Las Vegas, he found himself the victim of racially charged police brutality. The next day, badly shaken, he locked himself in his hotel room and didn't leave. That night, he ordered 3 huge canvases. It was the breaking point that crystallized the purpose of his paintings; he realized he was painting a positive reflection of his own life, one not bound by the biases or expectations of anyone, one that was bigger and brighter than any pair of handcuffs could contain. Rod questions: can we relieve minorities of this burden simply by adding some vibrancy to their identity? He'd like to think the answer is yes. To be dark does not necessitate a need to be represented as dangerous. He has his debut solo show entitled \\"Neon Black\\" in September 2018 and received critical acclaim for his efforts.

The top one has the fragmentary inscription Zababa Uhub Ensi Kish-ki (\\"Goddess Zababa, Uhub Governor of Kish\\". The second fragment from the same vase mentions \\"Pussusu conqueror of Hamazi (, ha-ma- ziki)\\". British Museum (BM 129401) \\"Hamazi\\" in the inscription of Uhub. Hamazi or Khamazi (Sumerian: , ha-ma-ziki, or ·∏™a-ma-zi2ki )The Sumerian King List. Accessed 15 Dec 2010. was an ancient kingdom or city-state of some importance that reached its peak c. 2500-2400 BC. Its exact location is unknown, but is thought to have been located in the western Zagros mountains roughly between Elam and Assyria, possibly near Nuzi or modern Hamadan. Hamazi first came to the attention of archaeologists with the discovery of a vase with an inscription in very archaic cuneiform commemorating the victory of Uhub (or Utug ), an early king of Kish, over this place, causing fringe theorist Laurence Waddell in 1929 to speculate that it was to be identified with Carchemish in Syria. It is now generally considered to have been somewhere in the vicinity of the Diyala. One of the earliest references to Hamazi is found in the epic Enmerkar and the Lord of Aratta, where Enmerkar prays to Enki about the confusion of languages in the various inhabited lands, at the time of the building of the ziggurats in Eridu and Uruk. Hamazi is the only land mentioned in this prayer with the epithet \\"many-tongued\\". A sequel, Enmerkar and En-suhgir-ana also mentions that the sorcerer of Hamazi, Urgirinuna, went to Aratta after Hamazi \\"had been destroyed\\"; he is later sent by the Lord of Aratta on a failed mission attempting to bring Enmerkar into submission. According to the Sumerian king list, king Hadanish of Hamazi held hegemony over Sumer after defeating Kish, but was in turn defeated by Enshakushanna of Uruk. A clay tablet found in the archives at Ebla in Syria bears a copy of a diplomatic message sent from king Irkab-Damu of Ebla to king Zizi of Hamazi, along with a large quantity of wood, hailing him as a brother, and requesting him to send mercenaries in exchange. Hamazi was one of the provinces of Ur under the reign of Amar-Sin during the Ur III period; two governors or ensis during this reign were named Lu-nanna son of Namhani, and Ur-Ishkur. In ca. 2010 BC, the province was occupied and plundered by Ishbi-Erra of Isin as the Ur III empire was collapsing.

Mooney was a four-year starter at Princeton, starting all 107 games in his career and amassing 1,071 points, good for 20th place in program history. He finished second for Rookie of the Year in the Ivy League as a freshman and received honorable mention all-conference honors as a sophomore, First Team All-Ivy League honors as a junior and Second Team All-Ivy League honors in his senior year. Coaching career Mooney began his coaching career fresh out of college at Lansdale Catholic High School in Lansdale, Pennsylvania. In 1997, Mooney took the helm of the program at Beaver College, now known as Arcadia University. After three years at Beaver, Mooney took an assistant coaching position under Joe Scott at the United States Air Force Academy. When Scott left to take the head coaching position at Princeton University in 2004, Mooney was elevated to the head position at Air Force. After one season at Air Force, Mooney became head coach at the University of Richmond. The University of Richmond announced on March 27, 2011, following a run to the Sweet Sixteen in the 2011 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament that Mooney had signed a new contract running through the 2020‚Äì21 season.Mooney Signs 10-Year Contract At Richmond With an 84‚Äì74 win over Wake Forest on December 1, 2018; Mooney tallied his 240th win at Richmond, vaulting him past Dick Tarrant to become the winningest coach in Richmond history.

The tertiary structure of 6PGL employs an Œ±/Œ≤ hydrolase fold, with active site residues clustered on the loops of the Œ±-helices. Based on the crystal structure of the enzyme, the mechanism is proposed to be dependent on proton transfer by a histidine residue in the active site. 6PGL selectively catalyzes the hydrolysis of Œ¥-6-phosphogluconolactone, and has no activity on the Œ≥ isomer.  Enzyme Mechanism  6PGL hydrolysis of 6-phosphogluconolactone to 6-phosphogluconic acid has been proposed to proceed via proton transfer to the O5 ring oxygen atom, similar to xylose isomerase and ribose-5-phosphate isomerase. The reaction initiates via attack of a hydroxide ion at the C5 ester. A tetrahedral intermediate forms and elimination of the ester linkage follows, aided by donation of a proton from an active site histidine residue. The specific residue that participates in the proton transfer eluded researchers until 2009, as previous structural studies demonstrated two possible conformations of the substrate in the active site, which position the O5 ring oxygen proximal to either an arginine or a histidine residue. Molecular dynamic simulations were employed to discover that the residue that donates a proton is histidine, and that the arginine residues are only involved in electric stabilization of the negatively charged phosphate group. Electric stabilization of the enzyme-substrate complex also occurs between the product carboxylate and backbone amines of surrounding glycine residues. Proposed mechanism of 6-phosphogluconolactone hydrolysis by 6PGL.  Enzyme Structure  6PGL in Homo sapiens exists as a monomer at cytosolic physiological conditions, and is composed of 258 amino acid residues with a total molecular mass of ~30 kDa. The tertiary structure of the enzyme utilizes an Œ±/Œ≤ hydrolase fold, with both parallel and anti-parallel Œ≤-sheets surrounded by eight Œ±-helices and five 310 helices. Stability of the tertiary structure of the protein is reinforced through salt bridges between aspartic acid and arginine residues, and from aromatic side-chain stacking interactions. 6PGL isolated from Trypanosoma brucei was found to bind with a Zn+2 ion in a non-catalytic role, but this has not been observed in other organisms, including Thermotoga maritima and Vibrio cholerae.  Biological Function  6-phosphogluconolactonase catalyzes the conversion of 6-phosphogluconolactone to 6-phosphogluconic acid, both intermediates in the oxidative phase of the pentose phosphate pathway, in which glucose is converted into ribulose 5-phosphate. The oxidative phase of the pentose phosphate pathway releases CO2 and results in the generation of two equivalents of NADPH from NADP+. The final product, ribulose 5-phosphate, is further processed by the organism during the non-oxidative phase of the pentose phosphate pathway to synthesize biomolecules including nucleotides, ATP, and Coenzyme A. The enzyme that precedes 6PGL in the pentose phosphate pathway, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, exclusively forms the Œ¥-isomer of 6-phosphogluconolactone. However, if accumulated, this compound can undergo intramolecular rearrangement to isomerize to the more stable Œ≥-form, which is unable to be hydrolyzed by 6PGL and cannot continue to the non-oxidative phase of the pentose phosphate pathway. By quickly hydrolyzing the Œ¥-isomer of 6-phosphogluconolactone, 6PGL prevents its accumulation and subsequent formation of the Œ≥-isomer, which would be wasteful of the glucose resources available to the cell. 6-phosphogluconolactone is also susceptible to attack from intracellular nucleophiles, evidenced by Œ±-N-6-phosphogluconoylation of His-tagged proteins expressed in E. coli, and efficient hydrolysis of 6-phosphogluconolactone by 6PGL prevents lactone accumulation and consequent toxic reactions from occurring between the lactone intermediate and the cell.  Disease Relevance  Malarial parasites Plasmodium berghei and Plasmodium falciparum have been shown to express a bi-functional enzyme that exhibits both glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase and 6-phosphogluconolactonase activity, enabling it to catalyze the first two steps of the pentose phosphate pathway. This bifunctional enzyme has been identified as a druggable target for malarial parasites, and high-throughput screening of small molecule inhibitors has resulted in the discovery of novel compounds that can potentially be translated into potent antimalarials.

Its common names are musk daisybush, musktree, muskwood and silvershrub. It is found in Australia, specifically in New South Wales, Tasmania and Victoria. It grows as a tall shrub or tree characteristic of wet sclerophyll forest. Its leaves are large and broad (6‚Äì15 cm x 2‚Äì5 cm), coarsely toothed, green on top and silver-white underneath.Species reference, University of Tasmania. http://www.utas.edu.au/docs/plant_science/field_botany/species/dicots/astersp/oleaargo.html (accessed 11 September 2010). The grain of the wood is mainly straight, but burls near the base of the tree are prized for their brown swirls that often suggest the appearance of small faces or animals peering out of the wood, making them highly sought after by woodworkers.Yanni Rigos Wood Alchemy (with image) http://www.woodalchemy.com/woods/musk (accessed 11 September 2010).  Description  Olearia argopylla is an open to dense, medium to tall shrub or small tree (3-15m x 2-6m). Its bark is grey, fissured to ribbony, flaky and its branchlets covered in dense silvery hairs. It has large, alternate, ovate to broadly elliptic, shiny dark-green leaves with a silvery underside 6‚Äì15 cm long x 2‚Äì7 cm wide, often (but not always) with slightly serrated margins and roughly 25mm petiole. It has many pseudanthium 12-27mm in diameter, with 3-8 white ray florets and 3-8 yellow disc florets arranged in large terminal bunches. Flowers mainly between September‚ÄìApril.  Taxonomy  Botanical specimen from 1806 The first occurrence of Olearia argophylla was published in Flora Australiensis vol. 3. There are records, however, of earlier discovery of the plant under the synonym Eurybia argophylla in the French Dictionnaire des Sciences Naturelles Edn. 2, 37: 487 which dates back to 1825, and even earlier in Novae Hollandiae Plantarum Specimen 2(20-21) under the synonym Aster argophyllus (1806).  Distribution and habitat  Olearia argophylla grows commonly on cool moist sheltered slopes and in fern gullies, mostly in taller Eucalypt forests, and is found widespread across Victoria (Australia), Tasmania and Eastern New South Wales.  Cultivation  Olearia argophylla can be propagated from Seed, or sometimes from cuttings. It may be suitable as a screen or windbreak plant under established trees. Prefers moist well drained soils that are neutral or slightly acidic. It prefers partial to full shade and is frost tolerant.

It is an alternative rock song, featuring guitarist Dean DeLeo of Stone Temple Pilots. Lyrically, the song talks about all the 21 qualities that Morissette would like the most to find in a lover. \\"21 Things\\" received mixed reviews from critics, with many praising it as a standout track on the album, but others found issues with the song's lyrics. The song was only released in Brazil, charting on the Hot 100 chart, peaking inside the top fifty. A video for the song was also released there, featuring clips from the DVD Feast on Scraps and live shows. Morissette performed the track during the Toward Our Union Mended Tour (2002), So-Called Chaos Tour (2004) and the Guardian Angel Tour (2012).  Background and recording  Dean DeLeo plays guitar on the track. \\"21 Things I Want in a Lover\\" was all written, arranged and produced by Alanis Morissette, in the same vein of the entire album, Under Rug Swept. The song was mixed by Chris Fogel and features Dean DeLeo, guitarist of the Stone Temple Pilots, on the guitar. While writing the track, Morissette claimed that she's jokin in one part of the song, but in another she's \\"dead serious.\\" According to herself, \\"I went to Toronto to write and I didn't know whether I'd be writing songs for the record alone or with someone. I had no idea, but I started writing alone, and within the first week I'd written seven songs. So it was all really fast and accelerated [...] I'd have my little space station worked out where it was like a keyboard, an acoustic, an electric, my journal and a microphone set up, and we'd record it all onto DAT.\\"  Composition and lyrics  According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Universal Music Publishing Group, \\"21 Things I Want In a Lover\\" was written in the key of C major, with a moderately tempo of 96 beats per minute. The introduction follows the chord progression of C5‚ÄìC(5)‚ÄìF5/C-C. Morissette's vocal range span from the low-note of G4 to the high-note of C6. The Alternative rock song starts with a \\"toothy\\" guitar hook, played by Dean DeLeo, followed by Morissette listing the 21 things she wants in a lover, \\"not necessarily needs but qualities that [she] prefer[s].\\" Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine noted that the song \\"is structured in Morissette's distinct listy lyrical fashion,\\" citing the line \\"Do you have a big intellectual capacity but know that is does not equate wisdom?\\" as an example. For Nikki Tranter of PopMatters, the song \\"details exactly what Alanis is looking for in her perfect guy. According to the song, this guy would be eloquent and intelligent, sexually experimental and politically aware, self-deprecating and adventurous, athletic and free of addictions.\\" Ethan Browne of Metro New York called the list of requirements for a boyfriend, \\"dopey [...] with its unintentionally hilarious qualifier.\\" In an interview for Spin, Morissette commented that she had 673 things that she wanted in a lover, claiming that it needed \\"to be updated after every guy.\\" She also claimed, \\"I want someone who can be a complete dork with me and have no shame and be really disgusting. [...] So I can go, 'Oh, spirituality is very important to me, and this person, no matter how much I want to fuck him right now, does not believe in God.'

This fundamentalist offshoot often called \\"The Allred Group\\" has recently come into the Hollywood spotlight with the release of the hit Reality TV series Sister Wives aired in 2010 because his granddaughter Christine is one of the stars. Rulon was murdered on the orders of Ervil LeBaron, the head of a rival polygamous sect. Biography Having turned away from the polygamous religion of his father and grandfather as a young man, Allred's decision to take plural wives came in his twenties following what he described as a vision; the decision resulted in the estrangement of his first wife, Katherine Handy. Allred began to assume greater responsibilities in the Short Creek, Arizona, polygamous community following the paralytic stroke of its leader, Joseph White Musser. Allred was imprisoned for bigamy following Arizona governor John Howard Pyle's 1953 \\"Short Creek raid\\", but he resumed his polygamous lifestyle upon his release. During his imprisonment, he met the LeBaron group through correspondence and eventually fled to Mexico to live on their compound with promises of wealth, which never materialized. Allred ultimately assumed leadership of a polygamous group. In his later years, Allred made no attempt to hide his polygamous beliefs and openly spoke of his adherence to the principle of plural marriage on talk shows and in print interviews. Allred was the husband of at least seven wives and the father of forty-eight children. His daughter's biography reveals that after the original seven wives, Allred was pressured by his peers to be sealed to widows and other women requesting to be bound to \\"their prophet\\". At the time of his death, he had been sealed to 16 women in total. Though extremely conservative by the standards of outsiders, Allred's sect was far more moderate than the community headed by Rulon and Warren Jeffs and certainly more so than the organization headed by LeBaron. He was not on good terms with either of the rival sects, and he began receiving death threats from the LeBaron group in the 1960s. Allred's grandson, Lance Allred, who was born in 1981 and raised in Rulon's polygamist commune of Pinesdale, Montana, was the first legally deaf player in National Basketball Association history and is now a keynote motivational speaker. Regarding his grandfather, he has stated: \\"In the context of polygamist leaders, Rulon was actually very liberal, in that he encouraged his followers to go out into the real world and make money and bring it back, rather than keeping them all within a compound like the Jeffs and others do.\\" Lance Allred has also said: \\"Rulon was actually again, in the context, a very ethical man, in that he never introduced new doctrine. He tried to adhere strictly to Joseph Smith's teachings and never disclosed new 'revelation' whereas the LeBarons and Jeffs continually consolidated their power of their subjects with new and more radical doctrine.\\" = Death = On May 10, 1977, two women, both disguised by wigs and sunglasses, visited his office in Murray, Utah, and opened fire with handguns. Only Allred was injured; he died of his wounds the same day. One of the women was later identified as Rena Chynoweth, one of LeBaron's wives. Although acquitted (Chynoweth was found not guilty in a 9:3 jury ruling), Chynoweth later confessed to the crime in her memoir, The Blood Covenant. LeBaron was eventually convicted of association with several other murders, including that of his daughter, Rebecca. Allred's family is the subject of two memoirs written by one of his daughters, Dorothy Allred Solomon: In My Father's House and Predators, Prey, and Other Kinfolk: Growing Up in Polygamy. Samuel W. Taylor's I Have Six Wives was based on Allred's life. Allred's niece, Irene Spencer, writes of her uncle in her memoir Shattered Dreams: My Life As A Polygamist's Wife. Spencer, now a remarried monogamist, was the second of ten wives of LeBaron's younger brother and opponent, Verlan.

Analytic continuation along a curve of the natural logarithm (the imaginary part of the logarithm is shown only). In complex analysis, the monodromy theorem is an important result about analytic continuation of a complex-analytic function to a larger set. The idea is that one can extend a complex-analytic function (from here on called simply analytic function) along curves starting in the original domain of the function and ending in the larger set. A potential problem of this analytic continuation along a curve strategy is there are usually many curves which end up at the same point in the larger set. The monodromy theorem gives sufficient conditions for analytic continuation to give the same value at a given point regardless of the curve used to get there, so that the resulting extended analytic function is well-defined and single-valued. Before stating this theorem it is necessary to define analytic continuation along a curve and study its properties. Analytic continuation along a curve The definition of analytic continuation along a curve is a bit technical, but the basic idea is that one starts with an analytic function defined around a point, and one extends that function along a curve via analytic functions defined on small overlapping disks covering that curve. Formally, consider a curve (a continuous function) \\\\gamma:[0, 1]\\\\to \\\\Complex. Let f be an analytic function defined on an open disk U centered at \\\\gamma(0). An analytic continuation of the pair (f, U) along \\\\gamma is a collection of pairs (f_t, U_t) for 0\\\\le t\\\\le 1 such that * f_0=f and U_0=U. * For each t\\\\in [0, 1], U_t is an open disk centered at \\\\gamma(t) and f_t:U_t\\\\to\\\\Complex is an analytic function. * For each t\\\\in [0, 1] there exists \\\\varepsilon >0 such that for all t'\\\\in [0, 1] with t-t'<\\\\varepsilon one has that \\\\gamma(t')\\\\in U_t (which implies that U_t and U_{t'} have a non-empty intersection) and the functions f_t and f_{t'} coincide on the intersection U_t\\\\cap U_{t'}. Properties of analytic continuation along a curve Analytic continuation along a curve is essentially unique, in the sense that given two analytic continuations (f_t, U_t) and (g_t, V_t) (0\\\\le t\\\\le 1) of (f, U) along \\\\gamma, the functions f_1 and g_1 coincide on U_1\\\\cap V_1. Informally, this says that any two analytic continuations of (f, U) along \\\\gamma will end up with the same values in a neighborhood of \\\\gamma(1). If the curve \\\\gamma is closed (that is, \\\\gamma(0)=\\\\gamma(1)), one need not have f_0 equal f_1 in a neighborhood of \\\\gamma(0). For example, if one starts at a point (a, 0) with a>0 and the complex logarithm defined in a neighborhood of this point, and one lets \\\\gamma be the circle of radius a centered at the origin (traveled counterclockwise from (a, 0)), then by doing an analytic continuation along this curve one will end up with a value of the logarithm at (a, 0) which is 2\\\\pi i plus the original value (see the second illustration on the right). Monodromy theorem Homotopy with fixed endopoints is necessary for the monodromy theorem to hold. As noted earlier, two analytic continuations along the same curve yield the same result at the curve's endpoint. However, given two different curves branching out from the same point around which an analytic function is defined, with the curves reconnecting at the end, it is not true in general that the analytic continuations of that function along the two curves will yield the same value at their common endpoint. Indeed, one can consider, as in the previous section, the complex logarithm defined in a neighborhood of a point (a, 0) and the circle centered at the origin and radius a. Then, it is possible to travel from (a, 0) to (-a, 0) in two ways, counterclockwise, on the upper half-plane arc of this circle, and clockwise, on the lower half-plane arc. The values of the logarithm at (-a, 0) obtained by analytic continuation along these two arcs will differ by 2\\\\pi i. If, however, one can continuously deform one of the curves into another while keeping the starting points and ending points fixed, and analytic continuation is possible on each of the intermediate curves, then the analytic continuations along the two curves will yield the same results at their common endpoint. This is called the monodromy theorem and its statement is made precise below. : Let U be an open disk in the complex plane centered at a point P and f:U\\\\to \\\\Complex be a complex-analytic function. Let Q be another point in the complex plane. If there exists a family of curves \\\\gamma_s:[0, 1]\\\\to \\\\Complex with s\\\\in [0, 1] such that \\\\gamma_s(0)=P and \\\\gamma_s(1)=Q for all s\\\\in [0, 1], the function (s, t)\\\\in [0, 1]\\\\times[0, 1]\\\\to \\\\gamma_s(t)\\\\in \\\\mathbb C is continuous, and for each s\\\\in [0, 1] it is possible to do an analytic continuation of f along \\\\gamma_s, then the analytic continuations of f along \\\\gamma_0 and \\\\gamma_1 will yield the same values at Q. The monodromy theorem makes it possible to extend an analytic function to a larger set via curves connecting a point in the original domain of the function to points in the larger set. The theorem below which states that is also called the monodromy theorem. : Let U be an open disk in the complex plane centered at a point P and f:U\\\\to\\\\Complex be a complex-analytic function. If W is an open simply-connected set containing U, and it is possible to perform an analytic continuation of f on any curve contained in W which starts at P, then f admits a direct analytic continuation to W, meaning that there exists a complex- analytic function g:W\\\\to\\\\Complex whose restriction to U is f.

It is one of the largest mosques in Russiahttp://www.regnum.ru/news/1071117.html and is officially known as \\"The Heart of Chechnya\\" (Russian: –°–µ—Ä–¥—Ü–µ –ß–µ—á–Ω–∏, Serdtse Chechni; Chechen: –ù–æ—Ö—á–∏–π—á–æ—å–Ω–∞–Ω –¥–æ–≥). The mosque is named after Akhmad Kadyrov, the mufti of the self-proclaimed Chechen Republic of Ichkeria and the first president of the Republic of Chechnya, who commissioned its construction from the mayor of Konya. The mosque design with a set of -tall minarets is based on the Sultan Ahmed Mosque in Istanbul. On October 16, 2008, the mosque was officially opened in a ceremony in which Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov appeared and spoke with Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin. The mosque is located on the picturesque bank of the Sunzha River in the middle of a huge park (14 hectares) and is part of an Islamic architectural complex, which in addition to the mosque, consists of the Russian Islamic University, Kunta-Haji, and the Spiritual Administration of Muslims of the Republic of Chechnya. The mosque was built based on the classical Ottoman style. The central hall of the mosque is covered with a huge dome (diameter - 16 meters, height - 32 m). The height of the four minarets is 62 meters making them some of the highest minarets in southern Russia. The Exterior and interior walls of the mosque are made of marble, travertine, while the interior is decorated in white marble. The area of the mosque is 5000 square meters and has a capacity of more than ten thousand people. The same number of the faithful can pray in the mosque adjacent to the gallery and the area of summer. Features Interiors of Akhmad Kadyrov Mosque As a basis of architecture used in the Blue Mosque in Istanbul. During the construction of the mosque, the latest technologies have been used. The exterior and interior walls are of marble-travertine, and the temple interior is richly decorated with white marble, mined in the Marmara Adasi island in the Sea of Marmara (near Balikesir, Turkey). For patterned painting, synthetic and natural colors with special additives were used to increase the longevity of the colors (for a period of at least 50 years). Gold of the highest quality were deposited to produce the writing patterns displaying verses from the Quran. There are in total 36 chandeliers. Theirs forms remind of the three holiest sites of Islam - 27 of them imitating the Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem's Temple Mount compound, 8 are made in the appearance of the Green Dome in Medina's Masjid al-Nabawi and the biggest one measuring 8 meters in length and width, mimicking the Kaaba in Mecca. It took several tons of bronze and 2.5 kg of the highest quality of gold to create the chandeliers containing more than a million pieces and made of selectively designed Chechen ornaments and Swarovski crystals from Turkey. The prayer niche in the qiblah wall of the mosque is 8 meters high and 4.6 meters wide and made of white marble. The very niche creates the illusion of an infinite recess intersecting spaces. Calligraphy displaying verses from the Quran are skillfully woven into the overall pattern of the architectural decoration of the mosque. The main dome is inscribed with Surah 112 \\"al-Ikhl√¢s\\": \\"Say: He is God, the Single, Indivisible - God, the Eternal, Absolute. He begets not nor is He begotten - And there happens to be not a single one equal to Him.\\" The area of the mosque is 5000 m¬≤, height of minarets - 63 meters. The total area of the Islamic Center - 14 acres. The temple has a high seismic resistance. The adjacent area has multiple fountains, broken destinations, alley. Visual symbol of Russia In 2013, Russia held a competition \\"Russia 10\\", designed by popular vote to select the ten visual symbols of Russia. Once at the end of the second round the mosque took the second place, the head of Chechnya, Ramzan Kadyrov declared that removes the mosque \\"Heart of Chechnya\\" to participate in the competition. Take such a step head of Chechnya forced the election results, which in his opinion did not correspond to the actual number of votes cast. \\"We have every reason to be confident that the votes cast for the mosque\\" Heart of Chechnya \\"millions, not taken into account, despite the fact that the money came to the accounts of the operators of\\" MegaFon \\"and\\" Beeline \\",\\" - said Kadyrov. Almost throughout the voting Mosque \\"Heart of Chechnya\\" in the lead among the participants, but on the last day gave way to the first place of the Kolomna Kremlin. For \\"Heart of Chechnya\\" has been given more than 36.8 million votes, Kolomna Kremlin - almost 37.5 million. Head of the republic Ramzan Kadyrov, offended by the results of voting on the Internet, announced a boycott of the federal mobile operators \\"Beeline\\" and \\"Megaphone\\".

Origin  The tale was published by the Brothers Grimm in the first edition of Kinder- und Hausm√§rchen in 1812, and has been only slightly changed in the successive editions. Their source was Gretchen Wild (1787‚Äì1819). Synopsis A poor woodcutter and his wife had a three-year-old daughter that they could not feed. The Virgin Mary appeared to the woodcutter and promised to take care of the child, so they gave her the child. She grew up happily in Heaven. One day the Virgin had to go on a journey and gave the girl keys, telling her she could open twelve doors but not the thirteenth. She opened the first twelve and found the Apostles behind them. Then she opened the thirteenth door. Behind it was the Trinity, and her finger was stained with gold. She tried to hide it, lying three times, and the Virgin Mary said she could no longer remain for her disobedience and lying. She fell asleep and woke to find herself in a forest. Lamenting her misfortune, she lived in a hollow tree, ate wild plants, and tore all her clothing until she was naked. One day, a king found her looking beautiful but incapable of speech. He took her home and married her. A year later, she had a son. The Virgin Mary appeared and demanded that she confess to having opened the door. She lied again, the Virgin took her son, and the people whispered that she had killed and eaten the child. In another year, she had another son, and it went as before. The third year, she had a daughter, and the Virgin Mary took her to heaven and showed her her sons, but she would not confess. This time, the king could not restrain his councilors, and the queen was condemned to death. When she was brought to the stake, she relented and wished she could confess before she died. The Virgin Mary brought back her children, restored her the power of speech, and gave her happiness the rest of her life.

He also earned eight caps with the U.S. national team between 1988 and 1997. Youth Santel was born and raised in Saint Louis, Missouri. He played soccer from youth as a member of the renowned local club Scott Gallagher. He also attended Christian Brothers College High School where he played on the boys' soccer team, earning team MVP honors in 1985 as well as a NSCAA and Parade All- American. After graduating from high school, Santel attended Saint Louis University where he played on the men's soccer team. He was a 1989 Second Team and a 1988 and 1990 First Team All American. Professional In 1991, the Wichita Wings of Major Indoor Soccer League (MISL) drafted Santel number 1 overall in the 1991 MSL Draft. However, he actually played the 1991‚Äì1992 season with the St. Louis Storm (MISL). In 1992, he began playing for the Colorado Foxes of the American Professional Soccer League (APSL) and would remain with the team through the 1995 season. He was a member of both the 1992 and 1993 APSL champsionship teams. As Major League Soccer (MLS) prepared for its first season, it signed dozens of players to league contracts. In order to ensure an initial equitable distribution of talent, the league allocated high-profile players to each team. As part of this process, MLS allocated Santel to the Dallas Burn. In both 1996 and 1997, Santel was elected to the MLS All Star team. On December 4, 2000, the Burn traded Santel to the Kansas City Wizards for a third round draft pick. He spent one season with the Wizards, playing twenty-one games before retiring at the end of the season. National team In 1987, Santel was a member of the United States men's national under-20 soccer team at the 1987 FIFA World Youth Championship. Santel went on to earn thirteen caps, scoring one goal, with the senior U.S. national team between 1988 and 1997. His first game with the full national team came in a January 10, 1988 loss to Guatemala. He did not appear again with the national team until February 1, 1991. Then he played sporadically until his last game in 1997. His national team goal came in a November 14, 1993 shellacking of the Caymen Islands. Final score was 8‚Äì1. Post-playing career In 2002, the Lou Fusz Soccer Club of St. Louis hired Santel as its girls' program director. He is the head coach of the boys' soccer team and the girls' soccer team at Barat Academy. In December 2004, he was hired as the sales and marketing representative for Velocity Sports Performance, a sports training facility in Chesterfield, Missouri.

Frerichs (; born July 28, 1973) is the State Treasurer of Illinois, having taken office on January 12, 2015. Prior to being elected treasurer, he was a Democratic member of the Illinois Senate, representing the 52nd District from 2007 until 2015. The district, located in Champaign and Vermilion counties, includes all or parts of Champaign, Danville, Georgetown, Gifford, Rantoul, Thomasboro and Urbana. Early life and career Frerichs was born and raised in the small farming town of Gifford. Upon graduating from Rantoul Township High School, Frerichs attended Yale University and received his BA in 1995. He then attended National Cheng Kung University in Taiwan where he studied Mandarin Chinese while teaching English courses. Upon returning home, Frerichs began to teach at his alma mater and became involved in the community serving on his local volunteer fire department, on the board of a local non- profit nursing home, and as a member of the Urbana Rotary Club. Champaign County official In 1998, Frerichs ran against then-State Representative Tim Johnson and though he lost, it was the closest margin in Johnson‚Äôs political career. In 2000 Frerichs was elected to the Champaign County Board and reelected in 2002. Later that year, Frerichs was appointed to succeed Gerrie Parr as the Champaign County Auditor by his fellow board members. As Auditor he was responsible for preparing budget reports, maintaining financial records, ensuring the county meet state and federal reporting requirements, preventing fraud, and improving the financial health of the county. At the time, he was the only auditor in the state to become a Certified Public Finance Officer, a credential he continues to maintain. Two years later he was elected to the position. Illinois State Senator In 2005, Frerichs announced he would run for the 52nd Legislative District seat that includes most of Champaign County and Vermilion County to fill the vacancy caused by Rick Winkel‚Äôs retirement.

He also sat on the committees for Financial Institutions, Licensed Activities and Pensions, Public Pensions & State Investments and the Agriculture & Conservation. During his time in the Senate, Frerichs led efforts to eliminate the corrupt legislative scholarship program, advocated for the disclosure of chemicals used in fracking, and funded improvements at the University of Illinois, Parkland College and Danville Community College while fighting to reduce Illinois' disparities in education funding. After Governor Rod Blagojevich was removed from office for corruption, Frerichs moved to have the former governor barred from ever holding office again in Illinois. This motion carried unanimously. In the 98th General Assembly, Frerichs served as the chairman of the Higher Education committee and had previously served as chairman of the Agriculture & Conservation and Enterprise Zone Extensions committees. Treasurer of Illinois =2014 election= Frerichs announced his intention to run for the vacated office of Treasurer of Illinois in early January 2014, after incumbent Republican Treasurer Dan Rutherford had announced his intention to run for Governor of Illinois. Frerichs ran uncontested in the Democratic Party primary and faced Republican Illinois State Representative and former Illinois State House Minority Leader Tom Cross in the General Election on November 4. For more than two weeks after election day, the election was too close to call, but eventually Frerichs was declared the winner, defeating Cross 48.1% to 47.8%, as the election ended up being one of the closest in Illinois state history, being decided by only 9,225 votes out of more than 3.5 million ballots cast. =Tenure= He was inaugurated on January 12, 2015 and is serving as the 74th Treasurer of Illinois.

In 2015 and 2016 Treasurer Frerichs visited more than a dozen campuses across Illinois to talk with students and school administrators regarding the frustration and fear associated with the lack of funding for the Monetary Award Program (MAP) due to the State‚Äôs budget impasse. Consumer protection has played an important role in Frerichs administration, securing $2.3 million in uncashed rebate checks from Sprint and $140,000 from RadioShack and reconnecting the funds with Illinois residents via I-Cash, the State's unclaimed property program. Frerichs succeeded in leading the call to pass legislation supported unanimously by Democratic and Republican legislators requiring life insurance companies to use the federal Death Master File list to confirm if a policy holder has died and the death benefits have not been paid.

Principal‚Äìagent problems are situations where there are two players whose interests are not necessarily matching with each other, but where complete honesty is not optimal for one player. This will lead to strategies where the players exchange information based in their actions which is to some degree noisy. This ambiguity prevents the other player from taking advantage of the first. The game is closely related to signaling games, but there is a difference in how information is exchanged. In the principal-agent model, for instance, there is an employer (the principal) and a worker (the agent). The worker has a given skill level, and chooses the amount of effort he will exert. If the worker knows his ability (which is given at the outset, perhaps by nature), and can acquire credentials or somehow signal that ability to the employer before being offered a wage, then the problem is signaling. What sets apart a screening game is that the employer offers a wage level first, at which point the worker chooses the amount of credentials he will acquire (perhaps in the form of education or skills) and accepts or rejects a contract for a wage level. It is called screening, because the worker is screened by the employer in that the offers may be contingent on the skill level of the worker. Some economists use the terms signaling and screening interchangeably, and the distinction can be attributed to Stiglitz and Weiss (1989).

Synopsis In 2001, Japanese American painter Jimmy Mirikitani (born Tsutomu Mirikitani), over 80 years old, was living on the streets of lower Manhattan. Filmmaker Linda Hattendorf took an interest, and began to engage with him to create a documentary of his life. After the destruction of the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001, the debris- and dust-choked streets were deserted. When Hattendorf \\"found\\" Mirikitani, in his usual spot along the wall of a Korean Market, near the intersection of MacDougal and Prince Street in Soho, she offered him shelter in her small apartment. During this period a beautiful and curious friendship flowered, as Ms. Hattendorf began the long process of re-integrating Mr. Mirikitani into society, recovering, among other documents, his social security card and passport. Over the months they lived together, she uncovered his true identity and history. And ultimately, she reunited him with his niece, poet Janice Mirikitani, and his surviving sister and helped him find his own apartment in an assisted living facility. Over the course of the film, audiences learn about Mirikitani's past, including the injustice experienced by American-born Japanese during the Second World War, his career as an artist, his life among other artists, including Jackson Pollock. Ms. Hattendorf documents Mirikitani's epic journey, from California, to Hiroshima, back to California, to his imprisonment in an internment camp, to his sojourn across the country to Long Island and finally to New York City, where he was employed as a cook. When his employer died, Mirikitani became homeless, spending almost a decade in Washington Square Park. Later, he moved to the streets of Soho, where he created an atelier on the streets, and worked days and nights on his artwork. Hattendorf's highly personal film about justice deferred, loss, and redemption has won many awards in the United States and abroad, and in the end brought both Hattendorf and Mirikitani well- deserved and hard-won regard. (The \\"cats\\" in the title are featured in Mirikitani's artwork.) In May 2007 The Cats of Mirikitani aired on the award- winning PBS series Independent Lens. Mirikitani died October 21, 2012, at the age of 92. Director Linda Hattendorf and her collaborator, Masa Yoshikawa, were at Mirikitani's deathbed.

He played college football for Grambling State University, was the first NFL player from a predominantly black college, and was the first African American to become an NFL front-office administrator (scout and executive with the Rams until 1975). College career At Grambling, Younger started off as a tackle, but Coach Eddie Robinson soon recognized that Younger's skills better suited him to play in the offensive backfield and at linebacker. Younger earned the nickname \\"Tank\\" by deftly plowing over countless would-be tacklers. In 1945, as a freshman, Younger led the nation in scoring with 25 touchdowns. In his junior year, he rushed for 1,207 yards and scored 18 touchdowns. Younger also completed 43 of 73 pass attempts, 11 for touchdowns. When he graduated in 1948, his NCAA career total of 60 touchdowns (scored mostly on punt returns and end-around plays) was an all-time record. After his senior season, he was voted Black College Football's Player of the Year and named a member of the 1948 Pittsburgh Courier All-America team. Professional career Undrafted by an NFL team, Younger signed with the Los Angeles Rams as a free agent and became the first NFL player from an HBCU. He was a member of the Rams renowned \\"Bull Elephant\\" backfield (with \\"Deacon\\" Dan Towler and Dick Hoerner), and he is the sixth-leading rusher in Rams history with 3,296 yards. In his ten-year professional career with the Rams and the Pittsburgh Steelers, Younger was named to the Pro Bowl four times (1951, 1952, 1953, and 1955), rushed for 3640 yards on 770 carries, caught 100 passes for 1167 yards, scored 35 touchdowns (34 rushing, 1 receiving), and intercepted three passes on defense (also throwing an interception on his only NFL pass attempt). He was the first black player to play in an NFL All-Star Game and became the league's first black assistant general manager (with the San Diego Chargers, 1975‚Äì1987). In 2000, Younger was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame.

Other common names include: ash quandong, blue olive berry, fringe tree, lily of the valley tree, scrub ash, fairy Petticoats, koda, and perhaps even prima donna. The fruit‚Äôs edible outer skin and mesocarp (soft inner layer of the fruit) excluding the seed is safe to eat and is used in Australian Aboriginal Cuisine such as Bush tucker tea and is used in making jam. Its hard seed makes up most of the fruit in diameter. Botanically, the fruits are not true berries but drupes. It is especially grown to attract wildlife such as bees, nectar eating birds, seed eating birds, and butterflies.  Description and Distribution [Habitat]  This evergreen tree grows tall and wide. Although, when this large shrub or tree is situated in one of the Rainforests in New South Wales, or Queensland it can attain a height of 30 metres with the right climate conditions while competing for light with other taller trees.Floyd, A.G., Rainforest Trees of Mainland South-eastern Australia, Inkata Press 1989, Its most conspicuous features are the masses of white or sometimes pinkish cup-shaped flowers with fringed edges arranged in rows along the branch-let (A subdivision of a branch that is near or at the tip of the branch) which droop downwards giving them the dainty appearance of small hanging skirts. Another beautiful feature of this species is the round-oval drupaceous fruits, these are a stunning shade of bright blue and if you look closer there are a few tiny white yellowish spots all over the fruit's smooth surface, and would resemble small (1 cm long) olives. \\"The leathery leaves (to 12cm long) are lanceolate with a slightly elongate drip- tip apex and serrated margins. An interesting feature displayed in some of the leaves is a fine, whitish crust or film over the surface, giving the appearance of an evaporated salt layer. As the leaves age, they turn a bright red whilst still on the tree, providing an appealing colour contrast with the dark green foliage\\". When this blueberry ash tree is pruned new growth of leaves would start appearing up an attractive pinkish colour. This is a hardy plant native to eastern Australia grows under many conditions, however prefers warmer Temperate climate conditions along the coast. It descends from rainforest-like environments where it can be founded in southeastern Queensland, in eastern New South Wales, and on Flinders Island situated in Tasmania, but has shifted its range to include the drier climate of south- eastern Australia (its leaves have become harder for example). In New South Wales it grows in moist areas such as gullies and around watercourses as well as in tall Eucalyptus forests and sandy coastal scrub.  Cultivation and Uses  = Great tree for wildlife = The most commonly used name of Blueberry Ash is derived from these pretty fruits, which attract birds like the Regent bowerbird that collect them for their blue colour. Other birds that eat these fruits are Wonga Pigeons, Crimson Rosellas, Figbirds, White Headed Pigeons and Olive-backed Orioles. This tree is excellent for landscape restoration and wildlife. = Food & cultivation = From an ABC episode of Gardening Australia, Bernie shows Clarence some favourite fruit trees in Booderee Botanic Gardens. \\"This is Blueberry Ash (Elaeocarpus reticulatus). It grows all along this escarpment here. It's good bush tucker tea. You can get the berries off and eat that up, you can crush it and make it into jam. The birds love them too, so it's part of their staple diet as well.\\" It's a hard seed to germinate, the only way to propagate (cultivate) it is by lettings birds eat it and then collect the droppings which then would be use for cultivation of this tree. Watch the small snippet of the episode here on this ABC website. https://www.abc.net.au/gardening/factsheets/booderee-botanic-gardens/9435908.  Fire retardant  In a bush fire Elaeocarpus reticulatus (Blueberry ash) does not recover vegetatively (side shoots) after it is burnt so it must regenerate from seed either stored in the soil or from seed dispersed to the area by birds, related species cannot recover from fire as well. Elaeocarpus reticulatus is fire Retardant - Plants in which because of natural characteristics will not ignite easily in a moderate intense bush fire. In other words it's fire retardant although if it ignites during a big bush fire this tree would burn slower. However, it will not likely regrow back and will have to count on seeds already in the soil or from birds to grow back.

Famous for his courage and generosity, Zhang Ni made his name known while rescuing a magistrate's wife from bandits and leading her to safety. Often working with Ma Zhong He was instrumental in pacifying the indigenous tribes residing within and around the border of Shu. He spent at least 18 years dealing with the continuum of domestic uprisings around Yuexi/Yuesui and Ba commanderies though he was a talented general, Zhang Ni often looked for humane solutions and sought to make peace or negotiate with foreign tribes when he could. Thanks to his upright attitude, those tribes loved him, weeping and grabbing hold of his carriage when they learned he would be leaving. Feeling he was growing weak and old, Zhang Ni gave a stirring speech asking to give him a chance to repay his lord's largesse or die trying. Liu Shan was moved to tears by his speech. During one of Jiang Wei's Northern Expeditions, he was killed in battle by the Wei general Xu Zhi though he killed and injured numerous Wei soldiers. When they learned of his death, none among the Han or foreign clan of Yuexi did not weep with grief. After his death, they established a temple for him and brought offerings even in times of famine and hardship. Respected, even revered. Liu Shan compared him to the great heroes of antiquity and Chen Shou thought he was not so far. His name is sometimes rendered as Zhang Yi. Early life and career Zhang Ni was from Nanchong County(ÂçóÂÖÖÁ∏£), Ba Commandery Â∑¥ÈÉ°), which is present-day Nanchong, Sichuan. He started his career around the age of 19 as an Officer of Merit (ÂäüÊõπ) in the local county office. In 214, when the warlord Liu Bei seized control of Yi Province (covering present-day Sichuan and Chongqing) from its provincial governor Liu Zhang, some bandits used the opportunity to raid the county office. During the ensuing chaos, Zhang Ni engaged the bandits in close combat and protected the county magistrate's wife. He became famous for his courageous actions and was later summoned to the commander's office to serve as an Assistant Officer(Âæû‰∫ã).(ÂÖà‰∏ªÂÆöËúÄ‰πãÈôÖÔºåÂ±±ÂØáÊîªÂéøÔºåÂéøÈïøÊçêÂÆ∂ÈÄÉ‰∫°ÔºåÂ∂∑ÂÜíÁôΩÂàÉÔºåÊê∫Ë¥üÂ§´‰∫∫ÔºåÂ§´‰∫∫ÂæóÂÖç„ÄÇÁî±ÊòØÊòæÂêçÔºåÂ∑ûÂè¨‰∏∫‰ªé‰∫ã„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 43. Around this time, two scholars Gong Lu and Yao Zhou were appointed with a very important salary within the same prefecture as Ni. Lu and Zhou at the time enjoyed a good reputation and some fame, however both of them heard of Zhang Ni's accomplishment hence they respected him and became friends with him.(ÊôÇÈÉ°ÂÖßÂ£´‰∫∫ÈæîÁ•ø„ÄÅÂßö‰º∑‰Ωç‰∫åÂçÉÁü≥ÔºåÁï∂‰∏ñÊúâËÅ≤ÂêçÔºåÁöÜËàáÂ∂∑ÂèãÂñÑ„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 43. Around 227, when the Shu chancellor Zhuge Liang was assembling forces in Hanzhong Commandery in preparation for the first of a series of campaigns against Shu's rival state Wei, local bandits pillaged the villages in Hanzhong, Guanghan and Mianzhu commanderies. Zhang Ni, then holding the rank of an acting Commandant, led troops to deal with the bandits, who scattered and hid in different locations when they heard of Zhang Ni's approach. Zhang Ni could not force them to come out to fight him, so he pretended to offer to extend a heqin policy to the bandit chiefs, and then managed to coax them into attending a banquet to celebrate the peace. After the unsuspecting bandit chiefs got drunk, Zhang Ni ordered his men to kill all of them and then sent his troops to hunt down and eliminate the rest. The massacre lasted for about 10 days, after which the area was clear of bandits.(Â∂∑Â∫¶ÂÖ∂È∏üÊï£ÔºåÈöæ‰ª•ÊàòÁ¶ΩÔºå‰πÉËØà‰∏éÂíå‰∫≤ÔºåÂÖãÊúüÁΩÆÈÖí„ÄÇÈÖíÈÖ£ÔºåÂ∂∑Ë∫´ÁéáÂ∑¶Âè≥ÔºåÂõ†Êñ©ÊÖïÁ≠â‰∫îÂçÅÈ¶ÄÁ∫ßÔºåÊ∏†Â∏ÖÊÇâÊÆÑ„ÄÇÂØªÂÖ∂È¶ÄÁ±ªÔºåÊó¨Êó•Ê∏ÖÊ≥∞„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 43. Later after that, Zhang Ni fell seriously ill and unfortunately his family was too poor to afford a good treatment. However The Administrator of the Shu Command Guanghan who was He Zhƒ´(Âª£Êº¢) was known as a generous man and talented doctor hence Zhang Ni thought he should appeal to him. But Zhang Ni and he didn't know each other and so despite his illness, Zhang Ni personally took a carriage to visit him to entrust He Zhƒ´ with a treatment that could cure his illness. He Zhi knew of Zhang Ni's reputation as a brave and generous man, hence he did not spare any expense in to cure him. Finally, after several years the illness was cured. Both of them remained friends after this event.(ÂæåÂæóÁñæÁóÖÂõ∞ÁØ§ÔºåÂÆ∂Á¥†Ë≤ßÂå±ÔºåÂª£Êº¢Â§™ÂÆàËúÄÈÉ°‰ΩïÁ•óÔºåÂêçÁÇ∫ÈÄöÂéöÔºåÂ∂∑ÂÆøËàáÁñèÈóäÔºå‰πÉËá™ËΩùË©£Á•óÔºåË®ó‰ª•Ê≤ªÁñæ„ÄÇÁ•óÂÇæË≤°ÈÜ´ÁôÇÔºåÊï∏Âπ¥Èô§ÊÑà„ÄÇÂÖ∂Èª®ÈÅì‰ø°Áæ©ÁöÜÊ≠§È°û‰πü„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 43. When Zhang Ni's recovered, he was promoted to Officer of the Standard(ÁâôÈñÄÂ∞á) for his feats against the different bandits. And placed under Ma Zhong's command. In 232, They quickly quelled the rebelling Qiang tribes of the Wen Mount, allies of Wei in the north while in the south, they suppressed the foreign tribes such as Liu Zhou. Zhang Ni often led the vanguard and had numerous feats in battle and in planning. Zhang Ni and Ma Zhong instilled much fear in the restless local tribes throughout Shu territories.(ÊãúÁÇ∫ÁâôÈñÄÂ∞áÔºåÂ±¨È¶¨Âø†ÔºåÂåóË®éÊ±∂Â±±ÂèõÁæåÔºåÂçóÂπ≥ÂõõÈÉ°Ë†ªÂ§∑ÔºåËºíÊúâÁ±åÁï´Êà∞ÂÖã‰πãÂäü„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 43. Zhang Ni lead the vanguard with few troops about 300 men and horses. He worked under Ma Zhong in quelling the Qiang tribes. Zhang Ni led his own unit at the front separate from the main army and first to arrive to the village of TƒÅli. The location of the village makes it difficult to attack since it was atop a high mountain. However Zhang Ni climbed the mountains and set up his own camp four to five l«ê far of Tali. The Qiang knew there was danger and built a stone gate, atop the gate they set an elevated platform and gathered many stones atop it so that they could protect themselves while crushing the enemies. Zhang Ni judged that an assault on the gate would be complicated and so he sent an interpreter to inform them: When the elder leaders heard this command, they all quickly went out to meet with Zhang Ni and even provided provisions and let the army pass. Finally, the Shu army struck Tali and was victorious. When the rest of the Qiang tribes heard that Tali had already fallen, all of them were terrified and confused. Many among them welcomed the army and went out to surrender, while others fled into the valleys. Ma Zhong and Zhang Ni hunted those who fled and achieved total victory. In 233, the southern foreigner Liu Zhou led a massive revolt.Zhang Yi (Bogong) was unable to quell them so Ma Zhong was appointed Commander of Laijiang with the mission to defeat Liu Zhou, Zhang Ni again served under him and led the vanguard. Since Zhang Ni always led the army personally at the head, he thereupon beheaded Liu Zhou. With Liu Zhou's death most of the southern's tribes surrendered however in Zangge and Xƒ´nggu's command, the Liao tribes revolted again. So Ma Zhong send Zhang Ni to command the army to go quell them. Zhang Ni also enticed most of them to surrender and quickly two thousand men joined him and were all transferred to Hanzhong.(ÁõäÈÉ®ËÄÜËàäÂÇ≥Êõ∞ÔºöÂ∂∑ÂèóÂÖµÈ¶¨‰∏âÁôæ‰∫∫ÔºåÈö®È¶¨Âø†Ë®éÂèõÁæå„ÄÇÂ∂∑Âà•Áù£Êï∏ÁáüÂú®ÂÖàÔºåËá≥‰ªñÈáå„ÄÇÈÇëÊâÄÂú®È´òÂ≥ªÔºåÂ∂∑Èö®Â±±Á´ã‰∏äÂõõ‰∫îÈáå„ÄÇÁæåÊñºË¶ÅÂéÑ‰ΩúÁü≥ÈñÄÔºåÊñºÈñÄ‰∏äÊñΩÂ∫äÔºåÁ©çÁü≥ÊñºÂÖ∂‰∏äÔºåÈÅéËÄÖ‰∏ãÁü≥ÊßåÊìä‰πãÔºåÁÑ°‰∏çÁ≥úÁàõ„ÄÇÂ∂∑Â∫¶‰∏çÂèØÂæóÊîªÔºå‰πÉ‰ΩøË≠ØÂëäÊõâ‰πãÊõ∞Ôºö„ÄåÊ±ùÊ±∂Â±±Ë´∏Á®ÆÂèçÂèõÔºåÂÇ∑ÂÆ≥ËâØÂñÑÔºåÂ§©Â≠êÂëΩÂ∞áË®éÊªÖÊÉ°È°û„ÄÇÊ±ùÁ≠âËã•Á®ΩÈ°ôÈÅéËªçÔºåË≥áÁµ¶Á≥ßË≤ªÔºåÁ¶èÁ•øÊ∞∏ÈöÜÔºåÂÖ∂Â†±ÁôæÂÄç„ÄÇËã•ÁµÇ‰∏çÂæûÔºåÂ§ßÂÖµËá¥Ë™ÖÔºåÈõ∑ÊìäÈõª‰∏ãÔºåÈõñËøΩÊÇî‰πãÔºå‰∫¶ÁÑ°Áõä‰πü„ÄÇ„ÄçËÄÜÂ∏•ÂæóÂëΩÔºåÂç≥Âá∫Ë©£Â∂∑ÔºåÁµ¶Á≥ßÈÅéËªç„ÄÇËªçÂâçË®éÈ§òÁ®ÆÔºåÈ§òÁ®ÆËÅû‰ªñÈáåÂ∑≤‰∏ãÔºåÊÇâÊÅêÊÄñÂ§±ÊâÄÔºåÊàñËøéËªçÂá∫ÈôçÔºåÊàñÂ•îÁ´ÑÂ±±Ë∞∑ÔºåÊîæÂÖµÊîªÊìäÔºåËªç‰ª•ÂÖãÊç∑„ÄÇÂæåÂçóÂ§∑ÂäâÂÜëÂèàÂèçÔºå‰ª•È¶¨Âø†ÁÇ∫Áù£Â∫≤ÈôçË®éÂÜëÔºåÂ∂∑Âæ©Â±¨ÁÑâÔºåÊà∞È¨•Â∏∏ÂÜ†ËªçÈ¶ñÔºåÈÅÇÊñ¨ÂÜë„ÄÇÂπ≥Âçó‰∫ãË®ñÔºåÁâÇÁâÅËààÂè§Áç†Á®ÆÂæ©ÂèçÔºåÂø†‰ª§Â∂∑È†òË´∏ÁáüÂæÄË®éÔºåÂ∂∑ÂÖßÊãõÈôçÂæó‰∫åÂçÉ‰∫∫ÔºåÊÇâÂÇ≥Ë©£Êº¢‰∏≠„ÄÇ) Y√¨b√π Q√≠ji√π Zhu√†n Around 236, in Wudu on the border between Shu and Wei,though it belonged to Shu his hold was weak and mostly led by the Di tribes.

Zhang Ni was at Chengdu at this time and tried to appease Wan's worries: Several days later, news arrived and Zhang Ni's prediction was right.

But Shu had problems maintaining his authority over it. The situation degenerated when the rebels killed the two administrators G≈çng L√π and JiƒÅo Hu√°ng sent by the Shu government to govern Yuexi Commandery. With such hostilities from the locals, the subsequent administrator who would not enter Yuexi Commandery to assume their offices, could only reside at ƒÄnsh√†ng county, eight hundred l«ê away and could not assume office.

When he arrived, Zhang N√¨ led those he commanded in Yuexi and enticed the tribes with favor and generous treatment hence the foreigners all started to return to submission. However, the northern region of Zhuom«éa was the most rebellious. They were stalwart and strong therefore they would refuse to submit to authority quickly, so Zhang N√¨ led his army to quell them. Zhang Ni captured their leader Wei Lang alive but released him as a show of mercy to win over the trust of his kind. Later, he memorialized the court to have Wei Lang be given a fief as a city Marquis and have his tribe of three thousand households be officially recognized hence they were pacified. When the other tribes heard of this, they gradually surrendered to Zhang Ni. For his feats, the Shu government rewarded Zhang Ni by granting him the title of a Secondary Marquis.(ÊôÇË´ñÊ¨≤Âæ©ËàäÈÉ°ÔºåÈô§Â∂∑ÁÇ∫Ë∂äÂ∂≤Â§™ÂÆàÔºåÂ∂∑Â∞áÊâÄÈ†òÂæÄ‰πãÈÉ°ÔºåË™ò‰ª•ÊÅ©‰ø°ÔºåË†ªÂ§∑ÁöÜÊúçÔºåÈ†ó‰æÜÈôçÈôÑ„ÄÇÂåóÂæºÊçâÈ¶¨ÊúÄÈ©çÂãÅÔºå‰∏çÊâøÁØÄÂ∫¶ÔºåÂ∂∑‰πÉÂæÄË®éÔºåÁîüÁ∏õÂÖ∂Â∏•È≠èÁãºÔºåÂèàËß£Á∏±ÂëäÂñªÔºå‰ΩøÊãõÊá∑È§òÈ°û„ÄÇË°®ÊãúÁãºÁÇ∫ÈÇë‰æØÔºåÁ®ÆËêΩ‰∏âÂçÉÈ§òÊà∂ÁöÜÂÆâÂúü‰æõËÅ∑„ÄÇË´∏Á®ÆËÅû‰πãÔºåÂ§öÊº∏ÈôçÊúçÔºåÂ∂∑‰ª•ÂäüË≥úÁàµÈóúÂÖß‰æØ„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 43.

Wei Q√∫ and the Suqiyi had already surrendered but they rebelled while Zhang Ni was concentrating on matters in Zhuom«éa. Zhang N√¨ quickly defeated them and put to death F√©ng. However Dong Feng's wife was the daughter of another tribal leader, the ruler of the M√°oni√∫ tribe. In order to avoid rebellion from them, Zhang Ni concentrated to isolate them hence preventing their rebellion. But Dong Feng's brother Wei Q√∫ used this time to flee to the western frontier. He rallied the remnant Suqiyi. Wei Qu was a fierce and strong warrior hence the Suqiyi deeply feared him. Wei Qu sent two of his close relatives to feign surrender to Zhang Ni but in reality to obtain information. However Zhang N√¨ saw through this, and with great gifts, he convinced them to defect then Zhang Ni had the two men killed. With the death of their rebel leader Wei Qu, all the tribes were secure. After this, Zhang Ni turned his attention to the D≈´q√≠ leader L«ê Qi√∫ch√©ng, who previously had personally killed the former Administrator G≈çng L√π.

These counties had a pivotal role in Yuexi's revenue since they produced valuable commodities like salt, iron, and lacquer. These counties were on the western border and the foreign tribes had long seized it for themselves. Zhang Ni led his army to seize control of the counties and establish a Chief Clerk to oversee the production. However D√¨ngzu√≥ proved to be the most difficult, when Zhang N√¨ arrived. The chieftain's leader H√°o L√°ngc√©n, the P√°nm√π King's maternal uncle who was greatly trusted by the foreig tribes hated Zhang N√¨ for invading and would not go meet him. Rather than attack Dingzhuo, Zhang Ni decided to intimidate the tribes into surrendering. He sent several tens of strong warriors to go capture Hao L√°ngc√©n, beat and kill him. Then, Zhang Ni sent the body back to the tribes along with generous rewards, describing Hao L√°ngc√©n's evils crimes and also saying: When they heard this, the foreign people all dirtied their faces and bound themselves to apologize for their crimes. To reward them, Zhang Ni killed an ox for a great feast and did not harm them. Hence, Zhang Ni reaffirmed his grace and trust among the tribes.

Due to this, he sometimes found himself over his head and in dangerous situations, nearly being killed by Wang Shuang at Chencang before being rescued by Liao Hua and Wang Ping and being led into a trap and captured by Lady Zhurong during the Southern Campaign.

During Jiang Wei's Northern Expeditions, Zhang Ni often urged Jiang Wei to concentrate on internal affairs rather than attacking Wei.

Born in the late Eastern Han dynasty, Zhang Yi was a 10th-generation descendant of Zhang Liang. He started his career as a scribe under the warlord Liu Bei, who founded Shu later, and gradually rose to the positions of a county prefect and commandery administrator. In the early 230s, he served as an area commander tasked with maintaining the peace in Shu's southern commanderies. In 234, he led the Shu vanguard during the Battle of Wuzhang Plains against Shu's rival state Wei. From 238 to 259, Zhang Yi steadily rose through the ranks to become one of Shu's top generals. During this time, although he strongly opposed the Shu general Jiang Wei's aggressive stance towards Wei, he still accompanied Jiang Wei on his military campaigns against Wei. In 263, he surrendered to Wei forces along with the Shu emperor Liu Shan when Wei launched a large-scale invasion of Shu. In the following year, Zhang Yi was killed by mutineers during a rebellion by the Wei general Zhong Hui. Like Liao Hua and Zong Yu, Zhang was one of few officials who served the Shu-Han state throughout its entire existence.

Upon learning that Wei reinforcements led by Chen Tai were approaching Didao, Jiang Wei gave up on the fortress and retreated back to Zhongti (ÈêòÂ†§; south of present-day Lintao County, Gansu). Although Zhang Yi strongly disagreed with Jiang Wei's aggressive stance towards Wei and did not get along well with him, Jiang Wei still brought him along on his military campaigns against Wei. Zhang Yi also reluctantly participated in the campaigns.(Ëá™ÁøºÂª∫Áï∞Ë´ñÔºåÁ∂≠ÂøÉËàáÁøº‰∏çÂñÑÔºåÁÑ∂Â∏∏ÁâΩÁéáÂêåË°åÔºåÁøº‰∫¶‰∏çÂæóÂ∑≤ËÄåÂæÄ„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 45.

Death In 263, the Wei regent Sima Zhao ordered his generals Zhong Hui, Deng Ai and others to lead a large-scale invasion of Shu from three fronts. In response to the Wei invasion, the Shu generals Jiang Wei, Zhang Yi, Liao Hua, Dong Jue and others led their troops to resist the invaders. Zhang Yi and Dong Jue received orders to guard Yang'an Pass (ÈôΩÂÆâÈóú; a.k.a.

Zhang Yi later joined Jiang Wei and Liao Hua at the heavily fortified mountain pass Jiange to resist the Wei army led by Zhong Hui. In the winter of 263, the Shu emperor Liu Shan surrendered when the Wei army led by Deng Ai showed up unexpectedly outside Chengdu after taking a detour across dangerous terrain. As a result of Liu Shan's surrender, the Shu state's existence came to an end and it became part of Wei. After learning of Liu Shan's surrender, Zhang Yi and the other Shu generals at Jiange formally surrendered to Zhong Hui at Fu County (Ê∂™Á∏£; present-day Mianyang, Sichuan).([ÊôØËÄÄ]ÂÖ≠Âπ¥ÔºåËàáÁ∂≠Âí∏Âú®ÂäíÈñ£ÔºåÂÖ±Ë©£ÈôçÈçæÊúÉ‰∫éÊ∂™„ÄÇ) Sanguozhi vol. 45.

OHSU (343 Or 581) was a 2007 decision of the Oregon Supreme Court interpreting Oregon law on the potential tort liability of public employees. Background The plaintiff, Jordaan Michael Clarke, underwent successful heart surgery as an infant in 1998 at Oregon Health Sciences University (now Oregon Health and Science University, or OHSU) hospital, but suffered prolonged oxygen deprivation causing permanent and profound brain damage. His parents sued OHSU and the individuals treating him (several doctors, a respiratory therapist, and a nurse) on his behalf, seeking damages in excess of $17 million: $11,073,506 for lifetime medical and life care, $1,200,000 for lost earning capacity, and $5,000,000 for non-economic damages.Clarke v. OHSU, Oregon Supreme Court No. S53868 (slip op., Dec. 17, 2007). The trial court granted judgment on the pleadings on OHSU's motion. OHSU did not dispute negligence and argued that the statutory liability limits for suits against state agencies applied. Clarke was awarded a total of $100,000 economic damages and $100,000 non-economic damages in accordance with the limits.Clarke v. OHSU, 206 Or. App. 610, 138 P.3d 900 (2006). Or. Rev. Stat. ¬ß 30.270(1)(b). In 2006, the Oregon Court of Appeals reversed the trial court's ruling, holding that as to the individual defendants, the combination of applying the damage limits to claims against OHSU and allowing this substitution to supersede Clarke's common law claims against the individual defendants, resulting in an award of less than two percent of Clarke's damages, was not a sufficiently substantial substitution of remedies. Therefore, the court held, the limits violated a provision in the Oregon Constitution that \\"every man shall have remedy by due course of law for injury done him in his person, property, or reputation.\\" The Court of Appeals also held that the limits could constitutionally be applied to Clarke's claims against OHSU, reasoning that OHSU, as a public corporation, would have been entitled to governmental immunity from suit prior to enactment of the statute.Or. Const., Art. I, ¬ß 10. Oregon Supreme Court decision OHSU and the individual defendants requested discretionary review by the Oregon Supreme Court, and Clarke requested review of the Court of Appeals' ruling that the limits applied to OHSU. The Supreme Court granted the petitions for review, and, on December 27, 2007, affirmed the ruling of the Court of Appeals. The only significant distinction between the reasoning of the Court of Appeals and the Supreme Court is that the Supreme Court did not directly base its ruling of insufficiency of the remedy against the individual defendants on the ratio of the limits. Instead, it held that the elimination of claims against the individual defendants, when coupled with the limited remedy against OHSU, resulted in \\"an emasculated version of the remedy that was available at common law.\\" As a result, the case was remanded to the trial court for further proceedings against the individual defendants. Justice Balmer, joined by Justice Kistler, issued a concurring opinion to the Supreme Court decision, in which they called for the legislature to increase the statutory limits for damages against the government and indicated that they thought a less disproportionate limit might be constitutional.

During one of Julius Caesar's triumphs, he did not stand as the procession passed by. This irritated Caesar so much, he cried out: \\"Come then, Aquila, take back the republic from me, you tribune\\"Repete ergo a me Aquila rem publicam tribunus and for several days he would not make a promise to any one without adding, \\"That is, if Pontius Aquila will allow me.\\"Si tamen per Pontium Aquilam licuerit. This act probably resulted in a feud between the two, as Pontius became one of Caesar's assassins. After the Ides of March, he served Decimus Junius Brutus Albinus as a legatus in Cisalpine Gaul. He defeated T. Munatius Plancus, and drove him out of Pollentia. However, he fell in the Battle of Mutina, in which Aulus Hirtius decisively defeated Mark Antony. Aquila's anger stemmed from lost land in Naples that Caesar confiscated and gave to Servilia; later Caesar publicly taunted Aquila for not rising in his presence, adding insult to injury. https://www.jstor.org/stable/41540686  References  * Suetonius: The Life of Julius Caesar (J.

Alexander de Forbes fought at the Battle of Harlaw in 1411, and appears among the Scottish forces sent to the assistance of Charles, Dauphin of France, afterwards King Charles VII, and had a share in the victory obtained over the English at Beaug√©, in Anjou, on 22 March 1424. But soon after, at the desire of King James I of Scotland, then a prisoner in England, Forbes quit the French service and subsequently obtained three Safe-conducts at different times to visit England, with one hundred persons in his retinue each time, to wait upon his sovereign. He was created a Lord of Parliament sometime after 1436. The precise date of the peerage creation is not known (although Brown gives 1440), but in a Precept, dated 12 July 1442, he is already styled Lord Forbes.

Prior to his service in the Illinois Senate, he served as a member of the Madison County Board during the 1980s and as the Madison County State's Attorney from 1988 to 2002. Background and Early Education =Childhood= Haine was born on August 8, 1944 in Alton, Illinois to Mary Alice Moran and James Delos Hoare. James Hoare converted to Catholicism when he married the Irish-Catholic Mary Alice. In 1959 the family name was changed to \\"Haine\\". Prior to the change, the four Hoare sons ‚Äì Jim, John, Bill and Tom ‚Äì often came to blows with other boys over their phonetically unfortunate surname. William Haine was first encouraged to take up a career in politics and \\"make history\\" by Sister Geraldine, an Ursuline nun at St. Patrick's Grade School in Alton. After graduating from Marquette Catholic High School in 1963, he earned his B.A. from St. Louis University in History in 1967. In both high school and college, he became involved in local and state politics, including the races of Alton Mayor Clyde H. Wiseman, State Senator Paul Simon and U.S. Senator Paul H. Douglas. =Military Service and Law School= After college, Haine enlisted in the U.S. Army to serve in Vietnam. He was awarded the Bronze Star for Meritorious Service in Combat Operations after his tour as an enlisted army soldier in the First Cavalry Division (Air Mobile) from 1968 to 1969. He was still politically active while overseas, and from Vietnam he filed as a candidate for Alderman of the City of Alton, losing by only a narrow vote despite being unable to campaign. After his tour overseas, Haine attended St. Louis University Law School, where he served with distinction on the Board of Editors of the St. Louis Law Review and earned his J.D. in 1974. Two professors who mentored him there, Rev. Joseph Aloysius McCallin, S.J., and Dr. George D. Wendell, also encouraged him to pursue a career in politics. =Catholic Faith= During his law school years, Haine met Anna Schickel, an undergraduate French major at St. Louis University; they were married on August 7, 1971 in the Grailville Oratory in Loveland, Ohio. Haine and his wife have seven children and 31 grandchildren. They continue to reside in Alton, around the corner from his boyhood home. (designed by her father, the artist William Schickel). Haine refers to his wedding as the defining moment of his Catholic faith. Madison County Public Service After law school, Haine worked as an assistant public defender and maintained a small general practice on the side. He later partnered with trial attorney Randall Bono, and it was during their years together that Haine was elected a Madison County Board member and then State's Attorney. Already a member of the Madison County Board since 1978, Haine first ran for the office of State's Attorney in 1980. In the Democratic primary he faced former Assistant State's Attorney Dick Allen and incumbent State's Attorney Nick Byron. Though he lost the primary by 313 votes in a county of 260,000, Haine had established a Democratic base with the industrial north end of the county. Republican Don W. Weber, a former Assistant State's Attorney, won the general election in the Reagan landslide of 1980. With newfound political clout from the close primary race, Haine became a leader on the County Board and chaired the newly created Metro-East Transit District. The area-wide public exposure helped make his 1988 run for State's Attorney a success. =State's Attorney= In 1988, Haine became State's Attorney for Madison County, Illinois, a post he would hold for 14 years. In late 2002, he was appointed to fill the seat of retiring Senator Evelyn M. Bowles. State Senator After serving several months as an appointed Senator, Haine won re-election in 2002. His legislative record has established him as a pro-life, pro-gun and pro-labor legislator. Haine was an early supporter of Obama within the Democratic primary for U.S. Senator in 2004.https://www.usnews.com/usnews/news/articles/040802/2obama.htm He is currently the chairman of the Insurance Committee. Among Haine's most controversial bills was the Medical Malpractice Litigation Reform Act, which was supported by hospitals, doctors and nurses but strongly opposed by trial lawyers, including many of his friends in Madison and St. Clair Counties. Haine also was the chief sponsor of the Illinois Methamphetamine Precursor Control Act, the law requiring residents to provide identification when purchasing Sudafed, and limiting their purchases of it. Haine also guided the Compassionate Use of Medical Cannabis Pilot Program Act through the Illinois Senate, though it has not yet passed the House. More recently, Haine designed and sponsored a bill to enhance flood protection along the Mississippi River in his district. Now signed into law, the bill created a new tax district that can issue sales taxes to fund the renovation of local levees. The bill was supported by the Majority and Minority leaders, Democrat Emil Jones and Republican Frank Watson. Haine has maintained a 100% rating from National Right to Life.. In February 2011, Haine introduced a proposed Illinois constitutional amendment effectively banning same-sex marriage in the state.http://www.ilga.gov/legislation/billstatus.asp?DocNum=16&GAID;=11&GA;=97&DocTypeID;=SJRCA&LegID;=58185&SessionID;=84 The proposed amendment, which died in a Senate committee, was widely criticized by activists as being \\"anti- gay\\".http://www.windycitymediagroup.com/lgbt/Activists-Anti-gay-state- constitutional-amendment-dead/31248.html Haine announced he would not seek reelection to a sixth term on August 16, 2017. Rachelle Aud Crowe won the election to succeed Haine in 2018. Post-Senate career On May 16, 2019, Governor J.B. Pritzker nominated Haine for a position on the Illinois State Board of Elections for a term beginning July 1, 2019 and ending June 30, 2023. The Illinois Senate confirmed Haine unanimously on May 31, 2019.

He was considered one of the closest students of Rabbi Yitzchok Zev Soloveitchik (the Brisker Rov.) He was born in Brest, Belarus, then in Russia, to his father, Rabbi Yitzchok Paler. The family claimed descent from such Torah authorities as Rabbi Moses Isserles and Rabbi Meir ben Isaac Katzenellenbogen. Rabbi Yitzchok Paler, a full-time Talmudic scholar, was so well respected in the community of Brest that when the Brisker Rov was not available to serve as a Sandek at a Bris, Rabbi Yitzchok Paler served in that capacity instead. As a child, Rabbi Binyomin Paler gained a reputation as a child prodigy. He originally learned in the yeshiva in Brisk headed by Moshe Sokolowsky, author of Imrei Moshe. As he matured, he was allowed to join a small circle of select individuals who had the privilege to learn directly with the Brisker Rov. Even during World War II, Rabbi Binyomin Paler did not leave his beloved teacher, the Brisker Rov, rather, he followed the latter to Vilna to continue his studies. While learning in Brest, Rabbi Binyomin Paler's study partner was Rabbi Berel Soloveitchik. The duo learned eight folios of the Talmud every day. Rabbi Paler was reputed to have learned the entire Nezikin in one winter semester. He was also reputed to have been an expert in the all works of Maimonides and memorized the latter's works as well as the entire Gemara. Eventually, Rabbi Binyomin Paler joined the Mirrer yeshiva and escaped the horrors of the Holocaust in Europe by finding refuge with the Yeshiva in Shanghai. After the war, Rabbi Binyomin Paler joined his friend Rabbi Aryeh Leib Malin from the Mir in establishing Yeshivas Beis HaTalmud in Brooklyn, New York. The next year, he was appointed as a lecturer in Yeshivas Chasan Sofer, the yeshiva headed by his father-in-law, Rabbi Shmuel Ehrenfeld, the Mattesdorfer Rov. Rabbi Binyomin Paler eventually became the Rosh Yeshiva in his father-in-law's yeshiva. In America, Rabbi Paler was the emissary of the Brisker Rov in terms of funds needed for the various yeshivas in Israel, especially in Jerusalem. He also helped transmit the Brisker tradition to America. In 1965 he left Chasan Sofer to open his own yeshiva, Yeshiva Mekor Chaim. The name of his Yeshiva was given by Rabbi Moshe Feinstein to show that Rabbi Binyamin Paler was continuing the Talmudic tradition established by Rabbi Chaim Brisker. In 1976, a high school attached to the yeshiva was opened. Following his death, Rabbi Paler was succeeded as dean of Mekor Chaim by his three sons, Rabbi Yitzchok, Rabbi Simcha Bunim and Rabbi Zecharia.

Sullivan (born January 9, 1959) is an American politician and the former Director of the Illinois Department of Agriculture. Prior to this, he served as a Democratic member of the Illinois Senate for the 47th district of Illinois from 2003 to 2017. Early life and career John Sullivan was born in Macomb in 1959. He graduated from Quincy University with a bachelor's degree in history. He went on to work as an agricultural loan officer before joining Sullivan's Auctioneers, the family's successful auction and real estate business. He currently lives on the family farm north of Rushville with his wife, three sons and one daughter. State senator Sullivan was elected in 2002, defeating 22-year Republican incumbent Laura Kent Donahue in one of the closest and most expensive senate races that election cycle. The district, the largest in the state includes all of Adams, Brown, Cass, Hancock, Henderson, Mason, McDonough, Schuyler, Warren counties and portions of Fulton and Knox counties. Since he represented a historically Republican district, Sullivan was targeted for defeat by the Republicans in the 2004 election. However, he defeated Republican Tom Ernst with 61 percent of the vote. In March 2006 Illinois's 17th congressional district's congressman, Lane Evans, announced he would be retiring at the end of his 12th term shortly after he won the nomination for a thirteenth term. Sullivan, whose district was largely coextensive with the west-central portion of the congressional district, entered the special nominating election finishing second to a longtime aide of Evans, Phil Hare. Sullivan was unopposed for reelection in 2008. In 2012, Sullivan handily defeated Adams County Clerk Randy Frese. Senator Sullivan was Vice Chair of the Agriculture & Conservation committee and served on five other committees; Energy, Higher Education, Revenue, Transportation and Insurance. Senator Sullivan currently serves a Majority Whip. Proving just how Republican Sullivan's district was at most levels, for his entire tenure his associated Representatives in Districts 93 and 94 were both Republicans. In Illinois, state house districts are formed by dividing senate districts in half. This gave Sullivan the distinction of being the only State Senator to have two associated Representatives from the opposite party. On June 19, 2015, he announced that he would be retiring from the Illinois Senate at the end of his term in 2017. Underlining the Republican bent of his district, Republican Jil Tracy, who formerly represented District 93‚Äîthe western portion of the Senate district‚Äîwon the seat unopposed. Post legislative career In 2017, John Sullivan was named by J.B. Pritzker the co-chair of the latter's Agriculture Transition Committee. After the transition, it was announced on December 27, 2018 that Sullivan would be the next director of the Illinois Department of Agriculture. He will succeed Bruce Rauner-appointee Ray Poe. In January 2020, John Sullivan resigned from being Secretary of the Illinois Department of Agriculture at the request of Governor Pritzker due to the \\"rape in Champaign\\" email fallout.

The recently formed Palestine Strings ensemble performed with Nigel Kennedy in 2012, and toured the USA in 2011. Its youth orchestra - the PYO - has performed in Palestine, Italy, Jordan, Greece, Bahrain, Germany, Syria and Lebanon. It enjoys the support of international partner institutions including the Oslo Philharmonic Orchestra. The ESNCM's professional orchestra - the PNO - formed in December 2010, has performed in Palestine, Jordan and Indonesia. Both orchestras have an agenda of promoting music by living Arab composers. The ESNCM Orchestra, the only Palestinian symphony orchestra performing in Palestine today where all the musicians are drawn from the local communities, promotes concerts throughout the year in the main Palestinian towns and cities. It performs an eclectic mix of film western classical music, opera, arrangements of Arabic music and film music. The ESNCM has several resident Arabic music ensembles, student and professional, which have toured throughout the world, and its students have taken part in collaborative projects with well-known international musicians.  Festivals and Concerts  In addition to administrating two major festivals, the ESNCM promotes concerts of Arabic, western classical and jazz music throughout Palestine at all times of year. It is responsible for the annual Arabic music Layali Tarab fi Quds al Arab festival, and the mainly classical Jasmine Festival.  Background  In 1990, five Palestinian musicians and music teachers conducted a study on the status of music in Palestine upon a request by the Welfare Association. The preliminary findings of the study convinced the team that there was an urgent need to establish a music school to fill the huge gap in music education within the Palestinian society. In 1993, after three years of concerted efforts by these musicians, and with the support and encouragement of friends, foremost amongst whom were Edward Karkar, Munther Nabulsi, Huda Khoury and Linda Khalil Khoury, the conservatory was launched as the National Conservatory of Music, falling under the umbrella of the Board of Trustees of Birzeit University, who offered the Conservatory premises in the University Board building in Ramallah and appointed the following founders to the Supervisory Board at the Conservatory: Salwa Tabri, Rima Tarazi, Amin Nasser, Nadia Abboushi and Suhail Khoury. In October of that year, the first branch of the Conservatory opened in Ramallah. There were 40 students, three part-time teachers, a secretary, and a volunteer director ‚Äì one of the co-founders, Amin Nasser. A few years later, the Conservatory opened two other branches in Jerusalem and Bethlehem. And in summer of 2010 the launch of Nablus branch. In September 2004 as a tribute to the late Dr. Edward Said, an honorary member of the Board, the name of the Conservatory was officially changed to The Edward Said National Conservatory of Music.  Branches  There are currently five branches of the ESNCM, located in Jerusalem, Ramallah, Bethlehem, Nablus and Gaza City (inaugurated in 2012), with over 1000 students altogether. Each Branch has its own academic director and administrative manager who handle the day-to-day running of their schools. This setup makes room for the future opening of new branches on one hand, and on the other hand, it guarantees the same level of education and services to the students and community in whichever city the ESNCM has or opens a branch.  Academic Programs  The ESNCM offers two programs of study - the regular and the amateur program. \\"The Regular Program\\" The music program of study at the ESNCM has been designed to give regular students a broadly structured instrumental and theoretical musical education. It consists of three levels: #The Preparatory level. This is not a mandatory level. #The Elementary level. #The Intermediate level. After completing the three levels successfully, students will be eligible for a diploma that will qualify them to the university level program at the ESNCM (not open yet), which will train them to become professional musicians. Students would also be in a position to apply to any university or academy of music of their choice. = The Regular Program = consists of training in a Western or Arabic instrument, with examinations in 8 grades, each of which can be completed in a maximum of 20 months. It also includes theory, ear training, and history and appreciation of Arabic, classical, jazz and world music. The program also emphasizes group playing, choirs and group Arabic percussion. The program is set up in a manner to give students the broadest possible education in both Arabic and Western music cultures. = The Amateur Program = Private lessons are also offered to amateurs and music lovers without having to comply with the regular curriculum or to sit for exams. In some cases amateur students may register for other group courses subject to the approval of the teacher of the course, and provided that the student is at a level at which he/she could benefit from it. Students in the amateur program do not get credit or certificates for classes and courses that they have attended.

Following the capture of Lieutenant-Governor General Henry Hamilton, DePeyster is often credited as being the military leader of British and Indian forces in the Western American and Canadian frontiers. Early life De Peyster was a native of New York City, the son of Pierre Guillaume DePeyster (1707‚Äì1785) and Cornelia Schuyler (1715‚Äì1785). His maternal grandparents were Arent Schuyler (1662‚Äì1730) and Swantje Van Duyckhuysen (1679‚Äì1724), and his paternal grandparents were Catharina de Peyster and Abraham de Peyster (1657‚Äì1728), the 20th Mayor of New York City. His godparents were his uncles, Philip van Cortlandt (1683‚Äì1746) and Peter Schuyler (1707‚Äì1762) and his godmother was his aunt, Eva Schuyler Bayard (d. 1737). His nephew's son, Frederic de Peyster (1796‚Äì1882), was a noted New York City lawyer. He was educated in London and obtained a commission as ensign in time for the Seven Years' War. Career De Peyster joined the British Army in 1755, joining the 50th Foot Regiment, had been raised in America in 1748, by William Shirley, the Governor of the Province of Massachusetts Bay. In 1745, Shirley, along with de Peyster's uncle, Col. Peter Schuyler, had directed the Siege of Louisbourg. Next, he held a commission in the 51st Foot, a regiment formed by Lieutenant General Robert Napier in America, which at one point, had three Schuylers in it. During the Seven Years' War, he served under his uncle in upper colonial New York, gaining experience at frontier American warfare. He was captured, held as prisoner in France, and served out the war with the 8th Regiment of Foot in Germany after being exchanged. The 8th Regiment was assigned to Canada, and DePeyster enjoyed a series of promotions. In 1774, he was appointed commandant of Fort Michilimackinac, in present day Mackinaw, Michigan. DePeyster spent the next five years at the Fort. =American Revolution= When war broke out with the United States on April 19, 1775,Frothingham (1851), p. 312 DePeyster recruited Native Americans from the Great Lakes region to serve the British Crown, notably the effort under General John Burgoyne in his native colony of New York. He was rewarded with a promotion to major. In 1779, Major DePeyster took control of Detroit. The American Indian tribes of the Northwest Territory were then hostile to the British, but DePeyster, by his tact and the adoption of conciliatory measures, entirely weaned them from the colonists, and effectively managed his American Indian allies against American militia from Pennsylvania and Kentucky. Although Great Britain ceded control of Detroit to the United States at the end of the war, Detroit remained in British control until 1796. In November 1783, DePeyster was informed that he was promoted to Lieutenant-Colonel and was being transferred to Fort Niagara, situated at the connection of the Niagara River and Lake Ontario. However, he did not leave for Niagara until 30 May 1784, where he assumed command on 5 June 1784. In the summer of 1785, after the wars completion, he set sail and returned to England with his Regiment and continued to serve, eventually receiving a commission as colonel, on 12 October 1793. =Later life= He retired in 1794, due to illness, and sold his lieutenant-colonelcy to an associate of John Fane, 10th Earl of Westmorland, the then Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, who had failed to pay for it ten years later. After his retirement, DePeyster and his wife moved to Dumfries, where they settled down at Mavis Grove, a country estate. In 1795, when England was threatened by Napoleon, he again became actively involved with the militia. He had a large share in enlisting and drilling the 1st regiment of Dumfries volunteers, one of the original members of which was Robert Burns, the prominent Scottish poet, who dedicated to him his poem on \\"Life,\\" and with whom he once carried on a poetical controversy in the columns of the Dumfries Journal. DePeyster also published Miscellanies, by an officer in 1813. Personal life After the Seven Years' War, he was stationed in Scotland, where he married Rebecca Blair (d. 1827), a daughter of Robert Blair, Provost of Dumfries, and sister-in-law to Lieutenant-Colonel Bryce McMurdo. They married in 1757, and purportedly had a happy, but childless, marriage and were seldom apart. De Peyster died as the result of an accident on 26 November 1822 in Dumfries, Scotland. A large funeral was given in his honor, and he was buried in St Michael's Churchyard. His wife died on 20 February 1827.

He began serving as a pirate, one of the most famous of the 17th-century \\"Sal√© Rovers\\". Together with other corsairs, he helped establish the independent Republic of Sal√© at the city of that name, serving as the first President and Grand Admiral. He also served as Governor of Oualidia. Early life Jan Janszoon van Haerlem was born in Haarlem in 1575, which was in Holland, then a province ruled by the Habsburg Monarchy. The Eighty Years War between Dutch rebels and the Spanish Empire under King Philip II had started seven years before his birth; it lasted all his life. Little is known of his early life. He married Soutgen Cave in 1595 and had two children with her, Edward and Lysbeth. After her death, around 1600 he married or had a union with Margarita, a Moorish woman in Cartagena, Spain. They had four sons together: Abraham, Anthony, Phillip, and Cornelis. Anthony went on to be one of the first European settlers of New Amsterdam. Privateering In 1600, Jan Janszoon began as a Dutch privateer sailing from his home port of Haarlem, working for the state with letters of marque to harass Spanish shipping during the Eighty Years' War. Janszoon overstepped the boundaries of his letters and found his way to the semi-independent port states of the Barbary Coast of north Africa, whence he could attack ships of every foreign state: when he attacked a Spanish ship, he flew the Dutch flag; when he attacked any other, he became an Ottoman Captain and flew the crescent-moon and star flag of the Turks or the flag of any of various other Mediterranean principalities. During this period, he had abandoned his Dutch family.Karg and Spaite (2007): 36 Capture by Barbary corsairs Sail plan for a Polacca, first built by the Barbary pirates around the 16th century, many scholars believe the Polacca was extensively used by Jan Janszoon. The ship could sail with a large crew of 75 and was armed with 24 cannons. Janszoon was captured in 1618 at Lanzarote (one of the Canary Islands) by Barbary corsairs and taken to Algiers as a captive. There he \\"turned Turk\\", or Muslim. Some historians speculate that the conversion was forced.\\"Murad Rais\\", Pirate Utopias, p. 96, retrieved 29 Sept 2009. Janszoon himself, however, tried very hard to convert his fellow Europeans who were Christian to become Muslim and was a passionate Muslim missionary. The Ottoman Turks maintained a precarious measure of influence on behalf of their Sultan by openly encouraging the Moors to advance themselves through piracy against the European powers, which long resented the Ottoman Empire. After Janszoon's conversion to Islam and the ways of his captors, he sailed with the famous corsair Sulayman Rais, also known as Slemen Reis; he was a Dutchman named De Veenboer,\\"De Veenboer\\", Zeerovery, retrieved 29 Sept 2009. whom Janszoon had known before his capture and who\\"Murad Reis\\", p. 36 had converted to Islam. They were accompanied by Simon de Danser. But, because Algiers had concluded peace with several European nations, it was no longer a suitable port from which to sell captured ships or their cargo. So, after Sulayman Rais was killed by a cannonball in 1619, Janszoon moved to the ancient port of Sal√© and began operating from it as a Barbary corsair. Republic of Sal√© Sal√© in the 1600s In 1619, Sal√© Rovers declared the port to be an independent republic free from the Sultan. They set up a government that consisted of 14 pirate leaders and elected Janszoon as their President. He would also serve as the Grand Admiral, known as Murat Reis, of their navy.\\"Murad Reis\\", Pirate Utopias, p. 97, Retrieved 30 September 2009. The Sal√© fleet totaled about eighteen ships, all small because of the very shallow harbor entrance. After an unsuccessful siege of the city, the Sultan of Morocco acknowledged its semi-autonomy. Contrary to popular belief that Sultan Zidan Abu Maali had reclaimed sovereignty over Sal√© and appointed Janszoon the Governor in 1624, the Sultan acknowledged Janszoon's election as president by formally appointing him as his ceremonial governor.\\"Murad Rais\\", p.98 The walls of Marrakesh and El Badi Palace, by Adriaen Matham, 1640. Under Janszoon's leadership, business in Sal√© thrived. The main sources of income of this republic remained piracy and its by-trades, shipping and dealing in stolen property. Historians have noted Janszoon's intelligence and bravery, which were expressed in his leadership ability. He was forced to find an assistant to keep up, resulting in the hiring of a fellow countryman from The Netherlands, Mathys van Bostel Oosterlinck, who would serve as his Vice- Admiral.\\"Murad Rais\\", p. 98 Janszoon had become very wealthy from his income as pirate admiral, payments for anchorage and other harbor dues, and the brokerage of stolen goods. The political climate in Sal√© worsened toward the end of 1627, so Janszoon quietly moved his family and his entire operation back to semi-independent Algiers. =Plea from his Dutch family= Janszoon became bored by his new official duties from time to time and again sail away on a pirate adventure. In 1622, Janszoon and his crews sailed into the English Channel with no particular plan but to try their luck there. When they ran low on supplies, they docked at the port of Veere, Zeeland, under the Moroccan flag, claiming diplomatic privileges from his official role as Admiral of Morocco (a very loose term in the environment of North African politics). The Dutch authorities could not deny the two ships access to Veere because, at the time, several peace treaties and trade agreements existed between the Sultan of Morocco and the Dutch Republic. During Janszoon's anchorage there, the Dutch authorities brought his Dutch first wife and children to the port to try to persuade him to give up piracy. Such strategies utterly failed with the men.\\"Murad Rais\\", p.99 Janszoon and his crews left port with many new Dutch volunteers, despite a Dutch prohibition of piracy. Diplomacy =Dutch captives= While in Morocco, Janszoon worked to secure release of Dutch captives from other pirates and prevent their being sold into slavery. =Franco-Moroccan Treaty of 1631= Knowledgeable of several languages, while in Algiers he contributed to the establishment of the Franco-Moroccan Treaty of 1631 between French King Louis XIII and Sultan Abu Marwan Abd al-Malik II. Notable raids √ìlafur Egilsson was captured by Murat Reis the Younger =Lundy= In 1627 Janszoon captured the island of Lundy in the Bristol Channel and held it for five years, using it as a base for raiding expeditions. =Iceland= In 1627, Janszoon used a Danish \\"slave\\" (most likely a crew member captured on a Danish ship taken as a pirate prize) to pilot him and his men to Iceland. There they raided the fishing village of Grindav√≠k. Their takings were meagre, some salted fish and a few hides, but they also captured twelve Icelanders and three Danes who happened to be in the village. When they were leaving Grindav√≠k, they managed to trick and capture a Danish merchant ship that was passing by means of flying a false flag. The ships sailed to Bessasta√∞ir, seat of the Danish governor of Iceland, to raid but were unable to make a landing ‚Äì it is said they were thwarted by cannon fire from the local fortifications (Bessasta√∞askans) and a quickly mustered group of lancers from the Southern Peninsula.Vilhj√°lmur √û. G√≠slason, Bessasta√∞ir: √û√¶ttir √∫r s√∂gu h√∂fu√∞b√≥ls. Akureyri. 1947. They decided to sail home to Sal√©, where they sold their captives as slaves. Two corsair ships from Algiers, possibly connected to Janszoon's raid, came to Iceland on July 4 and plundered there. Then they sailed to Vestmannaeyjar off the southern coast and raided there for three days. Those events are collectively known in Iceland as Tyrkjar√°ni√∞ (the Turkish abductions), as the Barbary states were nominally a part of the Ottoman Empire.The Travels of Reverend √ìlafur Egilsson. Accounts by enslaved Icelanders who spent time on the corsair ships claimed that the conditions for women and children were normal, in that they were permitted to move throughout the ship, except to the quarter deck. The pirates were seen giving extra food to the children from their own private stashes. A woman who gave birth on board a ship was treated with dignity, being afforded privacy and clothing by the pirates. The men were put in the hold of the ships and had their chains removed once the ships were far enough from land. Despite popular claims about treatment of captives, Icelander accounts do not mention that slaves were raped on the voyage itself,\\"Murad Rais\\", p. 129 however, Gu√∞r√≠√∞ur S√≠monard√≥ttir, one of the few captives to later return to Iceland, was sold into sex slavery as a concubine. =Sack of Baltimore, Ireland= Having sailed for two months and with little to show for the voyage, Janszoon turned to a captive taken on the voyage, a Roman Catholic named John Hackett, for information on where a profitable raid could be made. The Protestant residents of Baltimore, a small town in West Cork, Ireland, were resented by the Roman Catholic native Irish because they were settled on lands confiscated from the O'Driscoll clan. Hackett directed Janszoon to this town and away from his own. Janszoon sacked Baltimore on June 20, 1631, seizing little property but taking 108 captives, whom he sold as slaves in North Africa. Janszoon was said to have released the Irish and taken only English captives. Shortly after the sack, Hackett was arrested and hanged for his crime. \\"Here was not a single Christian who was not weeping and who was not full of sadness at the sight of so many honest maidens and so many good women abandoned to the brutality of these barbarians\\". Only two of the villagers ever returned to their homeland.\\"Murad Rais\\", p. 121, 129 =Raids in the Mediterranean Sea= Murat Reis chose to make large profits by raiding Mediterranean islands such as the Balearic Islands, Corsica, Sardinia, and the southern coast of Sicily. He often sold most of his merchandise in Tunis, where he befriended the Dey. He is known to have sailed the Ionian Sea. He fought the Venetians near the coasts of Crete and Cyprus with a corsair crew consisting of Dutch, Moriscos, Arab, Turkish and elite Janissaries. Capture by Knights of Malta Fort Saint Angelo in Valletta, Malta In 1635, near the Tunisian coast, Murat Reis was outnumbered and surprised by a sudden attack. He and many of his men were captured by the Knights of Malta. He was imprisoned in the island's notorious dark dungeons. He was mistreated and tortured, and suffered ill health due to his time in the dungeon. In 1640 he barely escaped after a massive Corsair attack, which was carefully planned by the Dey of Tunis in order to rescue their fellow sailors and Corsairs. He was greatly honored and praised upon his return in Morocco and the nearby Barbary States. Escape and return to Morocco After Janzsoon returned to Morocco in 1640, he was appointed as Governor of the great fortress of Oualidia, near Safi. He resided at the Castle of Maladia. In December 1640, a ship arrived with a new Dutch consul, who brought Lysbeth Janszoon van Haarlem, Janszoon's daughter by his Dutch wife, to visit her father. When Lysbeth arrived, Janszoon \\"was seated in great pomp on a carpet, with silk cushions, the servants all around him\\".\\"Murad Rais\\", p.140 She saw that Murat Reis had become a feeble, old man. Lysbeth stayed with her father until August 1641, when she returned to Holland. Little is known of Janszoon thereafter; he likely retired at last from both public life and piracy. The date of his death remains unknown. Marriages and issue In 1596, by an unknown Dutch woman, Janszoon's first child was born, Lysbeth Janszoon van Haarlem. After becoming a privateer, Janszoon met an unknown woman in Cartagena, Spain, who he would marry. The identity of this woman is historically vague, but the consensus is that she was of multi-ethnic background, considered \\"Moorish\\" in Spain. Historians have claimed her to be nothing more than a concubine, others claim she was a Muslim Mud√©jar who worked for a Christian noble family, and other claims have been made that she was a \\"Moorish princess.\\"\\"Anthony Jansen van Salee\\", Pirate Utopias, p. 206, Retrieved 29 sept 2009. Through this marriage, Janszoon had four children: Abraham Janszoon van Salee (b.1602), Philip Janszoon van Salee (b. 1604), Anthony Janszoon van Salee (b.1607), and Cornelis Janszoon van Salee (b. 1608). It is speculated that Janszoon married for a third time to the daughter of Sultan Moulay Ziden in 1624.\\"VAN SICKELEN & VAN HOORN LINES continued\\" , Michael A. Shoemaker. PCEZ.

Choc√≥ argues that the territory belongs to its municipality Riosucio, but Antioquia claimed Bel√©n de Bajir√° as part of one of Mutat√°. In 2000 the authorities of Choc√≥ founded and approved the municipality in the limits with Antioquia, north-east of Choc√≥ and south of the Antioquean Urab√°. However, the Antioquean authorities in Medell√≠n stated that the new municipality was on Antioquean territory and demanded the case before the Council of State of Colombia in Bogot√°. By its part, Choc√≥ defended its decision stating that the municipality was legally on the chocoan side.

The Geographic Institute Agustin Codazzi (IGAC, Spanish acronym), which is the entity responsible of the basic cartography and laying out the country maps, issued a final concept requested by the government stating that the limits between the two departments are well defined and there is no doubt that Bel√©n de Bajir√° belongs to Choc√≥. The document issued by IGAC ratifies the geographical limits established in the Law 13 of 1947 which defined Choc√≥ as a department.

The municipality and town are located in the Atrato River basin, on the Chocoan side of Urab√°, a region spanning the departments Choc√≥ and Antioquia. Riosucio municipality is landlocked, being separated from the Pacific Ocean by the Chocoan municipalities Jurad√≥ and Bah√≠a Solano and from the Gulf of Urab√°, a large inlet of the Caribbean Sea, by the Antioquian municipality Turbo and the Chocoan municipality Ungu√≠a. Riosucio town is mostly inaccessible by roads and has no airport; the river is the main route for access to and transportation within the town. The Silent Scream, http://venturafilms.com  History  Before the Spanish arrival in the region now known as Choc√≥, the region was populated by indigenous Ember√° and Kat√≠o communities. Spanish exploration began in 1501, with Rodrigo de Bastidas, Vasco N√∫√±ez de Balboa, and Juan de la Cosa making the first efforts. Although Spanish invaders tried to gain control of the area, the indigenous population kept them away until the 18th century, when an increase in trade and the region's presence along potential north-south trade routes made the region again of interest to colonizers. The municipality and town are named Riosucio (in English \\"Dirty River\\") after the river of that name that joins the Atrato River. The town was founded by the Spaniard Domingo Bailon. In 1996, the town was the target of a violent operation of the Colombian military along with paramilitary groups, in response to organizing by Afro-Colombians and the subsequent law granting land rights to residents of Riosucio and other nearby towns.The Silent Scream, http://venturafilms.com Hundreds were killed, many disappeared, and over 22,000 survivors were forced to leave their lands and move to poor neighborhoods of big cities around the country.  Geography  Riosucio municipality is bordered by the country of Panam√° to the municipality's northwest and around a small northward-extending portion of its territory, by the Chocoan municipality Ungu√≠a along the northernmost part of Riosucio's northeastern border, by the Antioquian municipalities Turbo and Mutat√° along the central and southern parts of Riosucio's northeastern border, by the Antioquian municipality Dabeiba on the southeastern side of Riosucio's eastern tip, by the Chocoan municipality Carmen del Darien along most of an irregular border running roughly east-to-west in its eastern portion and northeast-to- southwest in its western portion, by the Chocoan municipality Bah√≠a Solano for a small distance along Riosucio's southern tip, and by the Chocoan municipality Jurad√≥ along the remainder of Riosucio's southern tip and along all of Riosucio's western border except the small northern portion shared with Panam√°. The municipality is rather forested and is located at the northern part of the department of Choc√≥ in a region called \\"Lower Chocoan Atrato- Urab√°\\" (Bajo Atrato-Urab√° Chocoano). This region is crossed by the Atrato, one of Colombia's main rivers, which is joined by tributaries including Rio Sucio and the Salaqu√≠ and Truand√≥ rivers. The municipality does not have an airport; although a forest road connects it with Chigorod√≥ and Mutat√° in Antioquia and with Bel√©n de Bajir√° in a region disputed between Antioquia and Choc√≥, the road is undeveloped. The Atrato provides access southward (upriver) to the department capital Quibd√≥ and northward (downriver) to the Gulf of Urab√° and its port Turbo. = Climate = Riosucio has a tropical monsoon climate with heavy rainfall in all months except January and February.  Economy  Located in a forest region of Darien, Riosucio is dedicated to wood exploitation, agriculture, and cattle husbandry. The African palm is one of the area's main economic products. Although the tourist industry is not well developed in the area due to lack of infrastructure and of general security, areas that attract tourist interest exist and include: * Los Kat√≠os National Park, a territory that is shared with Panam√° and that was declared a World Heritage Site in 1994 by UNESCO: The park protects not only a rich and fascinating natural environment with unique animal and plant species but also the ancestral culture of Kat√≠os and other indigenous peoples of the area. * The Afro-American and Indo-American rural communities of the region around the river and the sea, whose ancestral traditions and natural environment attract tourist attention  Culture  The region is populated mainly by Afro- Colombian communities and by indigenous communities whose ancestral groups include but are not limited to the Kat√≠os and the Ember√°s. Their food, feasts, religiosity and traditions are influenced by their identity. The Spanish language is the lingua franca, but several languages and language varieties are in use, especially among indigenous groups. Afro-Colombian groups have maintained the use of many African words and expressions but have also adopted loanwords from indigenous languages. The culture belongs to the river, and the region's music and dances are influenced by both African and indigenous cultural elements. The main feats in the municipalities are the Sweet Festival during Holy Week, the feast of Saint Isidore the Laborer in May, and the Carnival of Our Lady of Mount Carmel from the 6th to the 16th of July.

Related idiomatic sayings such as could not sleep a wink provide the mental picture of a wink being the shortest type of sleep available and \\"forty winks\\" therefore gives an indication of an appropriate short sleep. Use in literature To emphasize that forty winks was a nap not taken in a bed, Lewis Carroll used the idiom in his novel Sylvie and Bruno when the main protagonist is constantly nudged by the Master of Ceremonies who is saying, I can't let you sleep here! You're not in bed, you know!; he replies, I know I‚Äôm not, I‚Äôm in an arm-chair, whereupon the Master says, Well, forty winks will do you no harm and walks off. To emphasise that forty winks was just the right amount of sleep if a nap was to be taken F. Scott Fitzgerald in a short article titled \\"Gretchen‚Äôs Forty Winks\\", published in the Saturday Evening Post on March 15, 1924 has the main protagonist, Roger Halsey say to his wife Gretchen, Just take forty winks, and when you wake up everything'll be fine. The idiom is used in everyday language also as a way of saying that a person may be refreshed by such a sleep. For example, Frank De Silva, a member of the 6th Division rescued amongst 8,000 other troops from Greece in 1941 by HMAS Perth, tells of sitting next to a sailor who exhausted falls into a brief deep sleep next to his breakfast before being nudged by those around him. He immediately wakes and says, I just needed that forty winks, and then is able to return to his duties. Finally almost so as to emphasize the link between forty winks and its biblical relationship William Ernest Henley and Robert Louis Stevenson in their play \\"King‚Äôs Evidence\\", at Act III, have the characters Smith and Moore discussing the failings of a third person, Slink Ainslie. Smith says to Moore, Give him forty winks, and he'll turn up as fresh as clean sawdust and as respectable as a new Bible.

From 1921 the Catholicos wandered the Middle East from place to place with no permanent home.

One of these orphanages was in the town of Antelias near Beirut, Lebanon, which they leased to the Catholicos for one dollar a year. Sahak also sought to bring his dream for an Armenian theological seminary to life at this site, since all seminaries under his jurisdiction had been closed or fallen apart after the genocide.

The first Indian war of independence resulted due to the build- up of political, social, economic, religious and military grievance against the British. People of the hill provinces were not politically active as were the people in other states of the country. More or less they maintained distance and so did their rulers with the exception of Bushahr. Some of them even provided help to the British during the time of revolt. Among them were the rulers of Chamba, Bilaspur, Bhagal and Dhami. The sons of Raja Gobind Singh, ruler of Siba State, namely Raja Ram Singh and Sunder Singh, revolted against the British and killed some of them along with their cousin. As a result Sunder Singh left the throne and established an independent domain named Tantpalan. The rulers of Bushahr acted in a hostile manner to the interests of the British. However, the evidence is not clear whether they really aided the rebels or not. The British territories in the hills came under the direct control of the British Crown after Queen Victoria's proclamation of 1858. The provinces of Chamba, Mandi and Bilaspur made a good rate of progress in various fields during the British rule. During World War I, nearly all rulers of the hill states remained loyal and served in the British army during the war time.

Darebase holds some similarity to capture the flag in its basic premise of chase, capture, and conquer. It differs in that the game field consists of a large no-man's land with team bases occupying two opposite ends of the field and in the methods of achieving victory. A variation called \\"stealbase\\" uses an object that may be either touched or stolen (as in capture the flag) to achieve victory. The size of the game field typically ranges from between that of a basketball court and about half the size of a football or soccer field. Each base belongs to the team that starts on that side and if the distance between the bases is longer than the average player is able to sprint, game play will begin to suffer. Effective game play can be achieved with as few as ten players and up to a hundred or more just as long as the game field and base lines are large enough to accommodate them. Darebase is popular in many areas of the United States as a recess game and at summer camps in part because of its simplicity, flexibility, and capacity to accommodate players of varying age and ability, as well as its potential for rapid and dynamic play even when teams are evenly matched. Its popularity outside the United States is not known.  Achieving victory  Darebase can be won in four different ways. First, by capturing all of the opposing team's players. Second, by occupying the opposing team's base when the opposing team is absent from their base. Third, by having captured more of the opposing team's players when time has run out, though the game does not require a time limit in order to be played. One variation of darebase, in which bases represent islands in the no-man's, allow victory to be achieved when one player makes the ultimate dare by running all the way around the opposing team's base and back into their own without being tagged by the other team.  Being fresher  For a player to be captured they must be tagged by an opposing team's player that has entered no-man's land after that player, a condition commonly referred to as being \\"fresher.\\" Players can return to their base line at any time to become fresher. If they are able, they may also use the opposing team's base line to become \\"fresher\\" and to become safe from capture. In Hawaii, the concept of \\"fresher\\" is referred to as \\"mana\\" or power. One's mana decreases over time and can be recharged by returning to one's base. In another variation, a team member may transfer mana to another player, though this may lead to confusion in games with large numbers of players.  Dares and waves  Game play typically starts with players engaging in a series of feints, or dares. Dares take the form of a player approaching the opposite base and baiting opposing players into giving chase. The pursuer is then drawn towards the enemy line. The pursued must assess where their personal point-of-no-return lies based on a combination of factors: their own speed and agility, the speed of their pursuer, and the speed of anyone backing them up. Being able to get as close as possible to this point without crossing it affords the greatest tactical advantage and results in the most dynamic play. If players on both teams cautiously avoid the point-of-no-return and thus do not invite pursuit, a condition of stalemate may result. If a player's dare is accepted, the pursuer will often cross their own point-of-no-return in an attempt to capture their quarry. This usually results in one or more players from the team of the pursued crossing their lines to intercept the pursuer. Any time members of one team cross their own line, the opposing team tends to respond with fresher players. This causes waves of alternating advantage to converge in the center of the field. When a pursuer is faced with a fresher opponent, he or she may choose to retreat either to their own line or to the position of a fresher teammate, attempt to complete the capture, or attempt to cross the opposing team's base line at an undefended point.  Becoming a spy  Being able to cross the opposing team's base line affords a strong tactical advantage analogous to a flanking maneuver. A player who has achieved this position is sometimes referred to as a spy. A spy is able to chase opposing players from behind and must be guarded closely, effectively neutralizing one or more players in the process. A spy may choose to remain in place as a continuous threat. However, it is rare for such a player to remain in place for very long after they have rested. A player capable of crossing the opponent's line, especially early in the game, will almost always use their advantage to attempt to capture one of the opposing team's fastest players. This fact only serves to enhance the degree to which spies are treated with caution.  Jail and variations  When one player captures another player, both players become immediately inactive or neutral until the captor finishes escorting the captured player to jail. Each team's jail is located in a corner of the field and is represented by a specific marked point on the base line such as a field cone or an article of clothing. The jailed player must be in physical contact with the jail point to be eligible for rescue. They may stretch out or lay down to increase their cross section. If an additional player is captured and brought to jail, that player must be in physical contact with the first player and may also stretch out. As this chain of jailed players gets longer its end gets closer to its players base line. This makes it easier for would-be rescuers to reach the line without being caught themselves. To free players from jail, a rescuer must tag the jailed player. There are several variations of darebase that hinge on different rules for freeing captured players from jail. In one variation, only one person can be freed at a time: whichever player has been in jail the longest. In this variation, the most recently captured player joins the line at the point of the jail while the players that have been in jail the longer move towards the other end of the line. The most senior prisoner must be tagged in order to be freed. Another variation allows all players to be freed if any of the jailed players are tagged. Yet another variation is actually a hybrid of the two above. To free all players, the rescuer must tag the point of the jail. Alternately, a rescuer is able to free just the most senior prisoner who is at the end of the line by tagging them directly. Once a rescuer has freed one or more prisoners they and those who are freed are immune to capture until they return to their team's base. This is often referred to as a \\"free walk.\\"  Natural emergence of tactics  Darebase provides several key roles that players typically occupy with very little discussion or leadership. Some players choose to place themselves out front, attempting to draw chase from the opposing team's fastest players. This dueling eventually results in one team's fastest player(s) being captured, or in gaining the advantage of crossing the other team's base line. Other players, whose personal point-of-no-return is closer to their home base, naturally employ more defensive tactics such as guarding the line, the jail, or shadowing spies.  History of the game  Compared with more organized games such as soccer, baseball, and basketball, the origin of darebase is not universally known. Thus, its history is also subject to uncertainty. Dare-Base was the original title of the 1952 Nero Wolfe mystery novel, Prisoner's Base, by Rex Stout (1886‚Äì1975). The plot clearly references the game. \\"The title on my manuscript was Dare-Base, from a game we played in Kansas when I was a boy,\\" Stout told biographer John McAleer. \\"My publisher, Harold Guinzburg, said it was better known as prisoner's base.\\"McAleer, John, Royal Decree.

He is an attacking slow left arm orthodox bowler and left-hand tail-ender batsman. He currently plays for Hyderabad in the domestic Ranji Trophy and also has played for Bengal as a guest player in Ranji Trophy for couple of seasons (2015/16-2016/17). He has achieved World no 1 as his career best ranking in ICC Player Rankings. He is the first and one of the two spinners to ever win the Purple Cap in the Indian Premier League. He joined Bihar cricket team as a guest player for 2018/19 season of Ranji Trophy. He is one of the very few players who have taken more wickets than the runs they have scored in Test Cricket. Career Ojha made his debut in first class cricket in 2004/05 and represented India at the under-19 level as well. He finished the 2006‚Äì07 Ranji Trophy season with 29 wickets with an impressive average of 19.89 in just 6 games. The left arm spinner is known for his ability to flight the ball. His earliest pursuit in cricket was at the age of 10, when he went to Sahid Sporting Club for a summer camp in Bhubaneswar under Sasang S Das, while studying at D.A.V. Public School, Chandrasekharpur. Three years later, he moved to Hyderabad and joined Bhavan's Sri RamaKrishna Vidyalaya in Sainikpuri, Secunderabad and choose cricket as his profession under the guidance of his coach T Vijay Paul. Ojha represented Hyderabad Cricket Association in domestic cricket from 2004 till 2015, then played for Cricket Association of Bengal as a guest player for couple of seasons (2015/16-2016/17). He has previously played for Deccan Chargers and Mumbai Indians in the Indian Premier League. His high success in the first couple of seasons in domestic cricket and the IPL ensured his selection in the 15-man Indian squad for the Bangladesh tour and Asia Cup in 2008. He played his first One Day International match against Bangladesh on 28 June 2008 in Karachi and ended up with figures of 2/43. On 24 November 2009, Ojha made his Test debut in the Second Test against Sri Lanka in Kanpur, replacing Amit Mishra and gaining figures of 2/37 off 23 overs and 2/36 off of 15.3 overs in India's 100th Test win. He then took five wickets in the Third Test in another innings win for India, taking nine wickets at 28.66 in two Tests. Ojha became the 800th and final Test victim of Muttiah Muralitharan, the highest wicket-taker in Test history. In his T20 debut against Bangladesh on 6 June 2009, he took 4/21 in four overs. He was awarded Man of the Match for his outstanding and match-winning performance. He has performed exceedingly well in the six editions of IPL, earning him the praise of his captain Adam Gilchrist and Sachin Tendulkar. He was all the more successful in the second season, which ensured his selection in the 2009 ICC World Twenty20 in England. IPL 3 he was awarded the Purple Cap for picking up the most number of wickets in the tournament. He has been part of 3 IPL winning teams (1 for Deccan Chargers & 2 for Mumbai Indians) & 1 champions League for Mumbai Indians. In August, 2011 he signed to play for Surrey for the final few weeks of the 2011 season.[2] His 24 wickets in 4 games helped Surrey to promotion to Division One of the LV County Championship. In November, during the First Test of the West Indies Tour of India he staged a marvelous comeback taking 6 wickets for 72 runs in the first innings. In December, 2014 Ojha was barred from bowling in competitive cricket after his action was found to be illegal. Later on 30 January 2015 Ojha cleared the test and was allowed to resume his bowling. In a 2008 interview, Ojha said that Venkatapathy Raju, who was also a left-arm spinner, inspired him to play for India. Ahead of the 2018‚Äì19 Ranji Trophy, he transferred from Hyderabad to Bihar. On 21 February 2020, he has announced his retirement from all forms of cricket. He played 48 international matches - 24 Tests, 18 ODIs and 6 T20Is - from 2008 to 2013. In his last game for India, a Test against West Indies in 2013, which was Sachin Tendulkar's farewell match, he finished with match figures of 10 for 89 and was named the Man of the Match.  Personal life  Pragyan was born in Bhubaneswar, Odisha. He moved to Hyderabad at the age of 13 and since then he has been residing there with his family. His parents are Maheswar Ojha (retired State Govt. Officer) and Bidulata Ojha (M.A in Literature). On 16 May 2010 he married Karabee Baral , daughter of Kailash Chandra Baral and Chanchala Naik both professors at English and Foreign Languages University.

The Joshua tree forest covering Cima Dome and the adjacent Shadow Valley is the largest and densest in the world. Cima Dome Cima Dome is a broad sloping upland dome, the erosional remnant of granite plutons that formed deep under the Earth's surface 180‚Äì80 million years ago when the Farallon Plate was being subducted beneath the North American Plate.

It ranges from in elevation. These cinder cones range in size from in height above the volcanic plain and from in base diameters. Over 30 of these cinder cones and associated lava flows, are Pleistocene in age and are located in the southern portion of the volcanic field, with the rest from the Quaternary age.  Wildfires  Due to climate change and the intrusion of flammable red brome into the desert habitat, large wildfires have increasingly devastated the Joshua tree forests of the Cima Dome. A significant portion burned in August 2005, and an especially-dense old-growth Joshua tree forest burned in 2020; as these ecosystems are not fire-adapted, the damage is far more permanent than similar fires on the West Coast, which occur in fire-adapted ecosystems. It is possible that the unusual denseness of the burned Joshua tree forest originated from cattle that grazed in the area in the early 20th century, turning a savanna with scattered Joshua trees into a dense Joshua tree forest with an understory of flammable native plants like blackbrush and introduced grasses, setting the stage for devastating fires.

The Act provided that the FDA was entitled to collect a substantial application fee from drug manufacturers at the time a New Drug Application (NDA) or Biologics License Application (BLA) was submitted, with those funds designated for use only in Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) or Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research (CBER) drug approval activities. In order to continue collecting such fees, the FDA is required to meet certain performance benchmarks, primarily related to the speed of certain activities within the NDA review process. History The move towards imposing user fees to pay for the regulatory review of new medicines was the result of dissatisfaction among consumers, industry, and the FDA. All three groups felt that drug approvals were taking far too long. Pharmaceutical companies had to wait to begin to recoup the costs of research and development. The FDA estimated that a delay of one month in a review‚Äôs completion cost its sponsor $10 million. The FDA argued that it needed additional staff to end its back- log of drugs awaiting approval for market. The FDA had not received sufficient appropriations from Congress to hire them. For decades the FDA had asked for permission to implement user fees and the pharmaceutical industry generally opposed them, fearing that the funds would not be used to speed drug review. The 1992 law became possible when the FDA and industry agreed on setting target completion times for reviews and the promise these fees would supplement federal appropriations instead of replacing them. =AIDS epidemic= The length of the drug approval process fell under severe scrutiny during the early years of the AIDS epidemic. In the late 1980s, ACT-UP and other HIV activist organizations accused the FDA of unnecessarily delaying the approval of medications to fight HIV and opportunistic infections, and staged large protests, such as a confrontational October 11, 1988, action at the FDA headquarters which resulted in roughly 180 arrests. In August 1990, Louis Lasagna, then chairman of a presidential advisory panel on drug approval, estimated that thousands of lives were lost each year due to delays in approval and marketing of drugs for cancer and AIDS. Partly in response to these criticisms, the FDA introduced expedited approval of drugs for life- threatening diseases and expanded pre-approval access to drugs for patients with limited treatment options. All of the initial drugs approved for the treatment of HIV/AIDS were approved through accelerated approval mechanisms. For example, a \\"treatment IND\\" was issued for the first HIV drug, AZT, in 1985, and approval was granted 2 years later, in 1987. AIDS activists, desperate for new treatments, were outraged at the cost of those first drugs and the slow pace of drug development. These activists bombarded the government and drug companies with complaints and public protests. The activists won a major victory in 1989, when Burroughs Wellcome implemented a 20% price cut on AZT, then still the only treatment for HIV. Even after this price concession, the 12-pill-per-day AZT regimen cost patients $6,400 a year. AIDS activists expressed their anger by trashing booths at medical conventions and continuing vocal public protests. Gradually, drug companies established relationships with AIDS activists and the two sides came together to improve clinical trials. By August 1991, relations had warmed up so much that ACT-UP founder Larry Kramer wrote Bristol-Myers Squibb chief Richard Gelb a letter of congratulations on the imminent approval of Videx. AIDS groups fought for the reauthorization of the Orphan Drug Act and the passage of the Prescription Drug User Fee Act in 1992. =PDUFA I= The Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) was first enacted in 1992. PDUFA gives the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) a revenue source, fees paid by pharmaceutical companies seeking the approval of new drugs, to supplement but not replace direct appropriations from Congress. PDUFA was passed in order to shorten the length of time from a manufacturer‚Äôs submission of a New Drug Application or a Biologics License Application to an FDA decision approval or licensure. Congress created three kinds of user fees via PDUFA and required that they each make up one-third of the total fees collected. These include application review fees paid by the sponsor for each drug or biologic application submitted, establishment fees paid by manufacturers annually for each of its facilities, and product fees paid annually for each product on the market covered by PDUFA. For 1993, the application review fee was about $100,000. The law provided exemptions and waivers for applications from small businesses, drugs aimed at orphan diseases, or unmet public health needs. In order to avoid listing specific performance goals in statutory language Congress stated in the bill‚Äôs ‚ÄúFindings‚Äù that, \\"3) the fees authorized by this title will be dedicated toward expediting the review of human drug applications as set forth in the goals identified in the letters of September 14, 1992, and September 21, 1992, from the Commissioner of Food and Drugs to the Chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee of the House of Representatives and the Chairman of the Labor and Human Resources Committee of the Senate, as set forth at 138 Cong. Rec. H9099-H9100 (daily ed. September 22, 1992).\\" =PDUFA II= In its 1997 reauthorization of PDUFA, Congress enacted stricter performance goals, required increased transparency in the drug review process, and tried to facilitate better communication between drug makers and patient advocacy groups. Congress expanded the scope of the legislation to include the investigational phases of a new drug‚Äôs development. PDUFA II was passed as Title I of the Food and Drug Administration Modernization Act. When Congress was debating the legislation that implemented PDUFA II Rep. Billy Tauzin, who later became head of PhRMA and one of those leading the call for a further streamlined review process, told a story of how a family friend had to travel to Mexico to obtain drugs that helped him overcome prostate cancer. \\"We continue to have problems with the fact that approved medicines in other countries can't get approved here. But what I particularly can't understand at all are situations where you have people suffering terminal illnesses, and they can't get the experimental drugs that might save their lives.\\" In testimony before Congress, James Swire, an AIDS activist and health educator who became infected with HIV in 1990, said the FDA has dramatically reduced the time needed to approve life-saving drugs using the money from PDUFA. Swire said, \\"I'm here because people really pushed the review process for AIDS and HIV treatments. There still is not a cure, but because of some of the new drugs, a lot of us have been able to get back to work.\\" =PDUFA III= PDUFA III, part of the Public Health and Bioterrorism Preparedness Act, made appropriations for increased postmarket monitoring of new products and allowed the FDA to hire additional personnel to speed the reviews of new drugs. Another 2002 statute extended user fee policies to cover the approval process for medical devices. During the period that PDUFA III was in effect the FDA's requirement that drug companies pay user fees for 505(b)(2) applications to switch drugs from requiring a prescription to being sold over-the-counter became a source of controversy. The drug industry claimed that the FDA misinterpreted the section of PDUFA III authorizing user fees when deciding to charge for reviewing 505(b)(2) applications. Specifically, they said Congress only intended user fees to be paid on new indications for a new active ingredient and that switching a drug to over-the-counter status was an exception to the rule requiring user fees. In February 2007 the FDA exempted drugs used in the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) from user fees in order to reduce the financial burden of developing new AIDS drugs. =PDUFA IV= The FDA requested and received fee increases to cover increased reviewer workload and expanded post-marketing safety initiatives, as well as the authority to apply user fees to the monitoring of direct-to- consumer drug advertising. President Bush signed the reauthorization of PDUFA into law on 27 September 2007. In 2007, the FDA was expected to collect $259,300,000 in industry user fees. =PDUFA V= The reauthorization process for PDUFA V began with a public hearing in April 2010. The Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA) strongly supported reauthorization of PDUFA, saying at the time that ‚ÄúPDUFA V can play a critical role in making more life-saving medicines available to patients in a timely manner, strengthening the scientific base of the FDA and providing a steady, reliable stream of resources for Agency scientists.\\" PDUFA was reauthorized in July 2012. PDUFA's fifth reauthorization calls for upgrading benefit/risks assessments of new medicines as well as call for more patient perspectives in the review process. Effectiveness =Increased staffing= A 2002 U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) report found that PDUFA funds allowed the FDA to increase the number of new drug reviewers by 77 percent in the first eight years of the act, and the median approval time for non-priority new drugs dropped from 27 months to 14 months over the same period. =Review times= A major PDUFA goal is for the FDA to review and provide a ruling on applications within one year unless significant changes are made to the application during the last three months of the review cycle. In a 1997 speech given prior to leaving the FDA David Kessler said, \\"So far we have reviewed 95% of the 1995 group on time. We won't reach 100%, however, because we did make a mistake: we misread a deadline on a computer printout and we missed one deadline by three days.\\" The PDUFA goal for the 1995 group called for a 70% on-time record. The 95% on-time rate more than doubled the pre-PDUFA on-time level of about 40%. Kessler said the FDA achieved similar positive results with other PDUFA goals, including in its review time for efficacy supplements (requests to add a new indication or a new group of patients to an already approved drug), submissions for manufacturing supplements (for making significant changes in the way a drug is made or using a new manufacturing facility) and resubmissions (responses provided to questions or alleged deficiencies raised by the FDA). From 1993 through 1996, the years PDUFA I was in effect, the approval time for new drugs declined significantly while the number of new products increased. The approval time for NDAs in the 8 years before the implementation of PDUFA I was roughly 31.3 months. During this period, the approval time exceeded 30 months in every year except 1990 when it was 27.7 months and 1992 when it was 29.9 months. From 1993 through 1996, the average approval time fell to 20.8 months. During this period, the approval time for new drugs never exceeded 30 months. According to the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America drug review time was cut roughly in half after the passage of PDUFA I. =Drug launches= Faster drug approval times and other PDUFA-related changes have led to pharmaceutical companies targeting more drugs for first launch in the United States thus increasing patient access to new medicines. Faster drug review from 1990 to 2001 were found to increase the probability of a drug being launched first in the United States by 14%. Other changes made under PDUFA such as the increased probability of approval and shortened development periods increased the probability of a drug being first launched in the United States by 31 percent at the end of PDUFA I and 27 percent at the end of PDUFA II. During the eight years before PDUFA took effect, an average of 24 new drugs were approved each year. The number of approvals ranged from 20 in 1988 to 30 in 1991. During the four years that PDUFA I was in effect, an average of 32 drugs were approved each year, ranging from 22 in 1994 to 53 in 1996. The average number of new drugs approved by the FDA each year increased by one-third. First drug launches making use of new chemical entities in the United States increased from 44 from 1982 through 1992 to 156 in from 1993 through 2003 period. The increase in first drug launches in the United States from 1993 through 2003 is particularly interesting given that the European Union harmonized its regulatory regime for new drugs with those of other major markets in order to reduce barriers for drug approvals during the same period. =Regulator-industry communication= David Kessler described improved communication between the FDA and the drug industry on what data should be included in NDAs as an important benefit of PDUFA. He said, \\"For example, in fiscal year 1993, 34 of the new applications that came into the FDA were sent back to the company because they were poorly prepared or missing critical information. In fiscal year 1996 six applications were refused for these reasons ‚Äì a more than fivefold improvement.\\" PDUFA dates PDUFA dates are deadlines for the FDA to review new drugs. The FDA is normally given 10 months to review new drugs. If a drug is selected for priority review, the FDA is allotted 6 months to review the drug. These time frames begin on the date that an NDA is accepted by the FDA as complete. Scale of fees FDA calculates fees based on an annual basis. For fiscal year 2018, drug application fees are: : $2,421,495 per full application requiring clinical data, : $1,210,748 per application not requiring clinical data or per supplement requiring clinical data. : $304,162 for programs The FDA estimates that operating costs for the year 2017 will be $878,590,000. The FD&C; Act specifies that one-third of the total fee revenue is to be derived from application fees, one-third from establishment fees, and one-third from product fees (see section 736(b)(2) of the FD&C; Act). FDA estimates that in 2016, 2,646 products will have been billed for product fees and 523 establishments will have been billed for establishment fees. In 2015, 132.5 full application equivalents (FAEs) were charged an application fee. FAEs are calculated by counting a full application as one FAE and an application not requiring clinical data or a clinical data supplement as half an FAE. An application that is withdrawn, or refused for filing, counts as one quarter of the original FAE. For a full application this is one quarter FAE, and for an application without clinical data or a clinical data supplement this is an eighth of an FAE. FDA budget User fees imposed under PDUFA are expected to add $707 million to the FDA budget in 2011, roughly a quarter of the agency's total spending. User fees cover roughly 65 percent of the drug approval process.

Later the MV Nezhin, with the opium on board, leaves port for Vladivostok.Pirates of the 20th Century DVD Video ReviewRussian Learning Scenario: Pirates of the 20th Century Some distance into the voyage, a watchman cries \\"man overboard\\" and the captain orders the engines stopped to rescue the stranded swimmer. The boat from Nezhin picks up an Asian man who identifies himself as Salekh, the only surviving sailor from a foreign merchant ship. Salekh told the crew that his ship suddenly capsized during a heavy storm and his crewmates were fighting for places in rescue boats. Shortly after that the Soviet captain is informed of an unknown ship, drifting nearby. The ship, called the Mercury, is apparently abandoned, with no crew visible and no activity on deck. The captain of the Nezhin decides to send four men to explore the ship and offer assistance to possible survivors. However, the abandoned ship turns out to be a trap for the Soviets. Occupied with the Mercury, none of the Russian crewmen pays any attention to Salekh, who takes an axe from the ship's firefighting kit, enters the radio room of the Nezhin, and attacks a radio operator, killing him. After Salekh destroys the ship's radio equipment, the Mercury starts her engines and approaches the Nezhin. At that moment, the Nezhin's crew see the bodies of the boarding party, floating in the water behind the Mercury. The Soviet captain realizes that his ship is under attack by pirates. Their attempt to escape is foiled when the Mercury rams the ship and the pirates open fire with assault rifles and machine guns. The pirates board the Nezhin, brutally killing Russian crewmembers who fight them. Sergey, the chief-mate of the Nezhin, discovers the dead radio operator and decides to find Salekh. Chasing Salekh through the corridors of the ship, Sergey makes an attempt to stop him. Salekh shows impressive martial arts skills and quickly defeats the chief-mate. Soon after, the pirates lock the remaining Russians into crew compartments and begin to offload the opium to the Mercury. The pirate captain thanks Salekh for a successful mission and orders him to blow up the Nezhin together with her crew. The Soviets, left to die on a sinking ship, manage to escape and must fight the pirates for survival.

Lacey was previously the Labor member for the seat of Grey in the Australian House of Representatives from 1922 to 1931. Early life Of Irish Protestant heritage, Lacey was born in Terowie, South Australia to labourer George Lacey and his wife Mary Ellen, attended the local public school and became one of the area's leading sprinters before commencing work in the Port Pirie smelters. Politics Following his marriage to Helene Clara Welke on 13 October 1908, Lacey became increasingly involved in the trade union movement and was employed as the Australian Workers' Union organiser at the smelter from 1916‚Äì22. His high profile in the smelters led to his election to Port Pirie Municipal Council in 1920, a position he held until 1922 when he successfully stood as the Labor candidate for the Federal Division of Grey against the incumbent Alexander Poynton, a former Labor member who left the party over conscription in World War I. As a member of the opposition, Lacey was appointed in 1924 to the select committee investigating the operation of the Navigation Act, and served as a member of the Public Works Committee from 1925. Following the ALP victory at the 1929 election, Lacey was made Chair of the Public Works Committee. Lacey was unlucky enough to be in government when the Great Depression affected Australia. He was swept out in Labor's heavy defeat at the 1931 election, but remained involved in politics, being re- elected to Port Pirie Municipal Council in 1932 and elected to the South Australian House of Assembly Electoral district of Port Pirie at the 1933 state election. At this time, the Labor Party was split into three factions; Official Labor, Premiers' Plan Labor and Lang Labor, who all had different plans on combating the Depression. Lacey was leader of Official Labor, the largest Labor faction following the election, and became Leader of the Opposition. As leader, Lacey advocated nationalising the banks and greater support for the unemployed. Regarded as \\"an affable people's man\\", he also played a leading role in reuniting the three factions in 1934 and remained Labor leader until 1938 when he stepped aside to become deputy leader under Robert Richards. Death Lacey died of heart disease in 1946. Survived by his wife, two sons and a daughter, Lacey was buried in Centennial Park Cemetery in Adelaide. References * Hopgood, D.

Bergen (1991), \\"The plenoptic function and the elements of early vision\\", Computational models of visual processing 1.2 (1991).), such as image smoothing, the stereo correspondence problem, image segmentation, object co-segmentation, and many other computer vision problems that can be formulated in terms of energy minimization. Many of these energy minimization problems can be approximated by solving a maximum flow problem in a graphBoykov, Y., Veksler, O., and Zabih, R. (2001), \\"approximate energy minimization via graph cuts,\\" IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, 23(11): 1222-1239. (and thus, by the max-flow min-cut theorem, define a minimal cut of the graph). Under most formulations of such problems in computer vision, the minimum energy solution corresponds to the maximum a posteriori estimate of a solution. Although many computer vision algorithms involve cutting a graph (e.g., normalized cuts), the term \\"graph cuts\\" is applied specifically to those models which employ a max-flow/min-cut optimization (other graph cutting algorithms may be considered as graph partitioning algorithms). \\"Binary\\" problems (such as denoising a binary image) can be solved exactly using this approach; problems where pixels can be labeled with more than two different labels (such as stereo correspondence, or denoising of a grayscale image) cannot be solved exactly, but solutions produced are usually near the global optimum.  History  The theory of graph cuts used as an optimization method was first applied in computer vision in the seminal paper by Greig, Porteous and SeheultD.M. Greig, B.T. Porteous and A.H. Seheult (1989), Exact maximum a posteriori estimation for binary images, Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, Series B, 51, 271‚Äì279. of Durham University. Seheult and Porteous were members of Durham's much lauded statistics group of the time, lead by Julian Besag and Peter Green (statistician), with the optimisation expert Margaret Greig also notable as the first ever female member of staff of the Durham Mathematical Sciences Department. In the Bayesian statistical context of smoothing noisy (or corrupted) images, they showed how the maximum a posteriori estimate of a binary image can be obtained exactly by maximizing the flow through an associated image network, involving the introduction of a source and sink. The problem was therefore shown to be efficiently solvable. Prior to this result, approximate techniques such as simulated annealing (as proposed by the Geman brothersD. Geman and S. Geman (1984), Stochastic relaxation, Gibbs distributions and the Bayesian restoration of images, IEEE Trans. Pattern Anal. Mach. Intell., 6, 721‚Äì741.), or iterated conditional modes (a type of greedy algorithm as suggested by Julian Besag)J.E. Besag (1986), On the statistical analysis of dirty pictures (with discussion), Journal of the Royal Statistical Society Series B, 48, 259‚Äì302 were used to solve such image smoothing problems. Although the general k-colour problem remains unsolved for k > 2, the approach of Greig, Porteous and Seheult has turned outY. Boykov, O. Veksler and R.

Greig, Porteous and Seheult approaches are often applied iteratively to a sequence of binary problems, usually yielding near optimal solutions. In 2011, C. Couprie et al.Camille Couprie, Leo Grady, Laurent Najman and Hugues Talbot, \\"Power Watersheds: A Unifying Graph-Based Optimization Framework‚Äù, IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, Vol. 33, No. 7, pp. 1384-1399, July 2011 proposed a general image segmentation framework, called the \\"Power Watershed\\", that minimized a real-valued indicator function from [0,1] over a graph, constrained by user seeds (or unary terms) set to 0 or 1, in which the minimization of the indicator function over the graph is optimized with respect to an exponent p. When p=1, the Power Watershed is optimized by graph cuts, when p=0 the Power Watershed is optimized by shortest paths, p=2 is optimized by the Random walker algorithm and p=\\\\infty is optimized by the Watershed (image processing) algorithm. In this way, the Power Watershed may be viewed as a generalization of graph cuts that provides a straightforward connection with other energy optimization segmentation/clustering algorithms. Binary segmentation of images = Notation = * Image: x \\\\in \\\\\\\\{R,G,B\\\\\\\\}^N * Output: Segmentation (also called opacity) S \\\\in R^N (soft segmentation). For hard segmentation S \\\\in \\\\\\\\{0 \\\\text{ for background}, 1 \\\\text{ for foreground/object to be detected}\\\\\\\\}^N * Energy function: E(x, S, C, \\\\lambda) where C is the color parameter and Œª is the coherence parameter. * E(x,S,C,\\\\lambda)=E_{\\\\rm color} + E_{\\\\rm coherence} * Optimization: The segmentation can be estimated as a global minimum over S: {\\\\arg\\\\min}_S E(x, S, C, \\\\lambda) = Existing methods = * Standard Graph cuts: optimize energy function over the segmentation (unknown S value). * Iterated Graph cuts: # First step optimizes over the color parameters using K-means. # Second step performs the usual graph cuts algorithm. :These 2 steps are repeated recursively until convergence. * Dynamic graph cuts: Allows to re-run the algorithm much faster after modifying the problem (e.g. after new seeds have been added by a user). = Energy function = : \\\\Pr(x\\\\mid S) = K^{-E} where the energy E is composed of two different models (E_{\\\\rm color} and E_{\\\\rm coherence}):  Likelihood / Color model / Regional term  E_{\\\\rm color} ‚Äî unary term describing the likelihood of each color. * This term can be modeled using different local (e.g. texons) or global (e.g. histograms, GMMs, Adaboost likelihood) approaches that are described below. = Histogram = * We use intensities of pixels marked as seeds to get histograms for object (foreground) and background intensity distributions: P(IO) and P(IB). * Then, we use these histograms to set the regional penalties as negative log-likelihoods. = GMM (Gaussian mixture model) = * We usually use two distributions: one for background modelling and another for foreground pixels. * Use a Gaussian mixture model (with 5‚Äì8 components) to model those 2 distributions. * Goal: Try to pull apart those two distributions. = Texon = * A texon (or texton) is a set of pixels that has certain characteristics and is repeated in an image. * Steps: # Determine a good natural scale for the texture elements. # Compute non- parametric statistics of the model-interior texons, either on intensity or on Gabor filter responses. * Examples: ** Deformable-model based Textured Object Segmentation ** Contour and Texture Analysis for Image Segmentation  Prior / Coherence model / Boundary term  E_{\\\\rm coherence} ‚Äî binary term describing the coherence between neighborhood pixels. * In practice, pixels are defined as neighbors if they are adjacent either horizontally, vertically or diagonally (4 way connectivity or 8 way connectivity for 2D images). * Costs can be based on local intensity gradient, Laplacian zero-crossing, gradient direction, color mixture model,... * Different energy functions have been defined: ** Standard Markov random field: Associate a penalty to disagreeing pixels by evaluating the difference between their segmentation label (crude measure of the length of the boundaries). See Boykov and Kolmogorov ICCV 2003 ** Conditional random field: If the color is very different, it might be a good place to put a boundary. See Lafferty et al. 2001; Kumar and Hebert 2003  Criticism  Graph cuts methods have become popular alternatives to the level set-based approaches for optimizing the location of a contour (seeLeo Grady and Christopher Alvino (2009), \\"The Piecewise Smooth Mumford-Shah Functional on an Arbitrary Graph\\", IEEE Trans. on Image Processing, pp. 2547‚Äì2561 for an extensive comparison). However, graph cut approaches have been criticized in the literature for several issues: * Metrication artifacts: When an image is represented by a 4-connected lattice, graph cuts methods can exhibit unwanted \\"blockiness\\" artifacts. Various methods have been proposed for addressing this issue, such as using additional edgesYuri Boykov and Vladimir Kolmogorov (2003), \\"Computing Geodesics and Minimal Surfaces via Graph Cuts\\", Proc. of ICCV or by formulating the max-flow problem in continuous space.Ben Appleton and Hugues Talbot (2006), \\"Globally Minimal Surfaces by Continuous Maximal Flows\\", IEEE Transactions on Pattern Analysis and Machine Intelligence, pp. 106‚Äì118 * Shrinking bias: Since graph cuts finds a minimum cut, the algorithm can be biased toward producing a small contour.Ali Kemal Sinop and Leo Grady, \\"A Seeded Image Segmentation Framework Unifying Graph Cuts and Random Walker Which Yields A New Algorithm\\", Proc. of ICCV, 2007 For example, the algorithm is not well-suited for segmentation of thin objects like blood vessels (seeVladimir Kolmogorov and Yuri Boykov (2005), \\"What Metrics Can Be Approximated by Geo-Cuts, or Global Optimization of Length/Area and Flux\\", Proc. of ICCV pp. 564‚Äì571 for a proposed fix). * Multiple labels: Graph cuts is only able to find a global optimum for binary labeling (i.e., two labels) problems, such as foreground/background image segmentation. Extensions have been proposed that can find approximate solutions for multilabel graph cuts problems. * Memory: the memory usage of graph cuts increases quickly as the image size increases. As an illustration, the Boykov-Kolmogorov max-flow algorithm v2.2 allocates 24n+14m bytes (n and m are respectively the number of nodes and edges in the graph). Nevertheless, some amount of work has been recently done in this direction for reducing the graphs before the maximum- flow computation.Nicolas Lerm√©, Fran√ßois Malgouyres and Lucas L√©tocart (2010), \\"Reducing graphs in graph cut segmentation \\", Proc. of ICIP, pp. 3045‚Äì3048Herve Lombaert, Yiyong Sun, Leo Grady, Chenyang Xu (2005), \\"A Multilevel Banded Graph Cuts Method for Fast Image Segmentation\\", Proc. of ICCV, pp. 259‚Äì265Yin Li, Jian Sun, Chi-Keung Tang, and Heung-Yeung Shum (2004), \\"Lazy Snapping\\", ACM Transactions on Graphics, pp. 303‚Äì308  Algorithm  * Minimization is done using a standard minimum cut algorithm. * Due to the Max-flow min-cut theorem we can solve energy minimization by maximizing the flow over the network. The Max Flow problem consists of a directed graph with edges labeled with capacities, and there are two distinct nodes: the source and the sink. Intuitively, it's easy to see that the maximum flow is determined by the bottleneck. = Implementation (exact) = The Boykov-Kolmogorov algorithmYuri Boykov, Vladimir Kolmogorov: An Experimental Comparison of Min-Cut/Max-Flow Algorithms for Energy Minimization in Vision.

The art deco tower is 446 feet (136 m) tall at the roof, and is 493 feet (150 m) at its spire and contains 33 floors. The building was constructed in 1931 by the First National Bank and Trust Company of Oklahoma City and has of office space. First National Center is currently the third tallest building in Oklahoma City, after the Devon Tower and Chase Tower, respectively. The tower is the sixth tallest building in the state of Oklahoma. The tower has a notable architectural resemblance to the Empire State Building in New York City. The First National Center is connected to adjacent buildings in the downtown area via the Oklahoma City Underground series of tunnels and elevated walkways. In 2007, the building had a 40% occupancy rate. By 2016, the occupancy rate had dropped to less than 20%.http://journalrecord.com/2016/10/25/oconnor-historic- renovation-encourages-new-development-opinion History The owner of the building was the First National Bank Corporation for use by the First National Bank and Trust Company of Oklahoma City. The bank's president E.P. Johnson and stockholders S.M. Gloyd, W.T. Hales, H.R. Hudson, R.A. Vose, and H.M. Johnson comprised the building's ownership and underwrote the construction. The cost of the building was $5 million. Work began in September 1930, with the demolition of several smaller buildings on the site. By January 1931, the site was clear, and construction on the tower began February 1 and was completed by November of the same year. The bank moved into the building on December 14, 1931. When it was completed, the 33-story skyscraper was declared to be the fourth tallest building west of the Mississippi River. In September 1957, the 14-story First National Office Building was completed on the east side of the tower, and in October 1977 an adjoining 14-story L-shaped annex was added that went east to Broadway Avenue, bringing First National Center complex to its current state. Among many businesses of early day Oklahoma City, the Beacon Club was once located at the top of the building. The First National Bank Corporation ran into troubled times in the 1980s, and failed. However, due to Oklahoma's liberalization of interstate banking, First Interstate Bank of Los Angeles assumed the assets of First National upon its failure in 1985, and the opened under their new name the following day. At the time, First National's failure was the largest bank in the nation to have sought FDIC protection. First Interstate operated the bank until 1991, when they sold it off to Boatmen's Bancshares of St. Louis. In May 1992, Boatmen's announced it would vacate the building and the banking lobby. Boatmen's had acquired Leadership Bank, and chose to utilize their headquarters in Leadership Square to the immediate northwest of First National Center. Boatmen's was later acquired by NationsBank - now Bank of America - and retains the Leadership Square headquarters for their Oklahoma City operations. Since Boatmen's departure, no bank has utilized First National Center. The building was sold to a California buyer for $21 million, with plans of a major renovation of the property. The buyer was organized as two separate entities, First National I, LLC and First National II, LLC, both of which are part of the Milbank Real Estate Group, led by chief executive officer Aaron Yashouafar. Renovations were begun, with plans to restore it to its 1930s glory. The buyer, however, ran out of money and filed for bankruptcy in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Western District of Oklahoma in October 2010. Since filing for bankruptcy, restoration activities within the building have ceased, leaving the building in apparent disrepair due to the halfway completed construction projects. The famous \\"Great Banking Hall\\" is today used for various social events, galas, balls, and proms. In August 2015, state agencies that had leased space within the building announced emergency relocations due to deteriorating conditions, including non-functioning elevators and an imminent air conditioning cutoff due to unpaid bills.Lackmeyer, Steve. \\"State of Oklahoma verifies agencies' plan to make immediate emergency moves from First National Center,\\" The Oklahoman, NewsOK, August 24, 2015, Accessed September 3, 2015.

Coury Hospitality will be managing the future use of the hotel. The renovation will transform approximately 190,000 square feet of the 1932 First National Bank office tower into a hotel with 139 keys. The restoration will include repair to murals, decorative painted ceilings, stone columns, cast stone, metal finishes, vault doors and safes. The basement and ground floor will be a mixture of retail, restaurant and commercial spaces. The Great Banking Hall will be restored and will be utilized as a public lobby and event space. The naming for the hotel is planned to be 'The National'. Construction is estimated to take 3 years. Architecture First National Center was built with an Art Deco, Neoclassical style inside and out, featuring polished aluminum, granite, glass and several varieties of marble from around the world. Rising 446 feet above the sidewalk, the building was topped out with an aluminum aviation tower and a red beacon light above a polished aluminum notched roof line. The aviation tower originally housed a massive white rotating beacon that was visible for 75 miles. When radio navigation superseded visual navigation after WWII, the powerful white was replaced with a lower-power red warning light. The 32nd floor was a public observation deck. One of First National's most distinctive features is its night lighting, where the upper-story setbacks are lit white. There have been times when the lighting has changed - after 9/11, the setbacks were lit in red, white and blue tiers - which is still done on July 4. For many years, a cross was created by lighting office windows during Christmas. This is no longer done due to the fact that later construction obscures the First National from many views, but it has been taken up by the SandRidge and Chase Towers. The Weary & Alford Company of Chicago designed First National Center, as well as other bank buildings around the country. Manhattan Construction Co. built First National's tower, and F.H. Beaumont of Oklahoma City supervised the majority of the building's construction. Murals depicting Oklahoma's history in the four corners of the banking lobby were painted by Chicago artist Edgar Spier Cameron.Lackmeyer, Steve and Brianna Bailey. \\"Heat loss: Heat, humidity threaten artwork in First National's great hall,\\" The Oklahoman, NewsOK, September 3, 2015.

Until 19 June 2018, he served as Advisor to the Chief Minister of Jammu and Kashmir, with the status of a Cabinet Minister. Following the abrogation of Article 370 of the Constitution of India, he has offered a political roadmap for securing the future of Jammu and Kashmir. He has been a persistent advocate of multiculturalism and of reconciliation between Kashmiri Pandits and Kashmiri Muslims. Family, early life and education A son of the academic and writer Neerja Mattoo and the forester and civil servant Rajendra Kumar Mattoo, Amitabh received his early education at the Christian missionary Burn Hall School in Srinagar and then at the Jawaharlal Nehru University in New Delhi, following which he married Ajita, a member of the 1987 batch of the Indian Railway Accounts Service. He qualified for the Indian Police Service in 1987 and then IAS in 1988 through the combined civil service exam but preferred a career in academics. He went on to earn a DPhil in International Relations from the University of Oxford, writing a history of the campaign for nuclear disarmament. He describes the ten days of youth that he spent in Tihar jail as part of student protests at JNU as a 'life-shaping experience'. Mattoo comes from a well-known and progressive Kashmiri Pandit family of Srinagar, which never left the valley during the years of conflict. Before the land reforms in Jammu and Kashmir, his family were among the most influential feudal landlords, aristocrats and administrators in the region. Examining the recent social history of his own ethnic group, Mattoo remarks: Career Mattoo has been a visiting professor at Stanford University, the University of Notre Dame, and the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.

Mattoo became the youngest Vice-Chancellor of the University of Jammu in November 2002 and continued at this position until December 2008. As a patron of the arts, he was responsible for building a world-class auditorium in Jammu University, which also hosts an art gallery and a museum. Leading Indian artists, including the √âcole nationale sup√©rieure des Beaux-Arts- trained Bengali painter Jogen Chowdhury, have donated their work to the gallery. As President of the Jammu and Kashmir chapter of SPIC MACAY, Mattoo was responsible for the University becoming a nationally acclaimed centre of culture. Mattoo's attempts at conflict resolution and peace-building (combining theory with practice) have been publicly acclaimed. He was a member of the committee, appointed by the Governor of Jammu and Kashmir in 2008, which negotiated the Amarnath land transfer controversy, a series of political events that had led to uprisings in Jammu and Kashmir. On 26 June 2011, Jammu and Kashmir Chief Minister Omar Abdullah made an open offer to Mattoo to return to his home state and 'advise us' in his capacity as a noted political thinker and academic. On 21 August 2015, Mattoo was appointed as Advisor to the Chief Minister of Jammu and Kashmir. For over a decade, he chaired the Chaophraya Track 2 Dialogue between India and Pakistan, and is regarded as one of the most creative thinkers on conflict resolution and pathways to build sustainable peace in South Asia. Mattoo endorses forgiveness and reconciliation among conflict-embittered South Asian peoples. On 3 February 2011, in a meeting with India's Education Minister Kapil Sibal, Mattoo declined to be the Founding Vice-Chancellor of the Central University of Jammu ‚Äì for which he had been selected by a search committee of eminent academics and approved by the President of India ‚Äì citing personal reasons. Earlier, he was in the shortlist of three for the Vice-Chancellorship of Jawaharlal Nehru University. On 1 March 2011, the University of Melbourne appointed Mattoo as the inaugural director of the Australia India Institute. The chairman of the institute's Board, University of Melbourne Chancellor the Hon. Alex Chernov AO QC (erstwhile Governor of Victoria) announced: \\"We are delighted to have as Director a person of world-renowned academic and administrative calibre such as Professor Mattoo. He has a wealth of experience in areas concerned with university affairs, government and other institutions.\\" Mattoo also serves as Professor of International Relations in the Faculty of Arts at the University of Melbourne. Mattoo advocates greater economic and political cooperation between Australia and India. In January 2020, he wrote: \\"After more than six decades characterised by misperception, lack of trust, neglect, missed opportunities and even hostility, a new chapter in India‚Äôs relations with Australia has well and truly begun. Consider this: in 1955, Prime Minister Robert Menzies decided that Australia should not take part in the Bandung Afro-Asian conference. By distancing Australia from the ‚Äònew world‚Äô, Menzies (who would later confess that Occidentals did not understand India) alienated Indians, offended Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru, and left Australia unsure for decades about its Asian identity. India and Australia should bring this chequered past to a closure, and herald a new united front for the Indo- Pacific.\\" '' Awards Recognizing his contribution to education and public life, the President of India honoured Mattoo on the occasion of the Republic Day (2008) with the Padma Shri, one of India's highest civilian awards. This was the first time a Vice-chancellor in Jammu and Kashmir had been so honoured.

The goddess is commonly referred to as the Bhagavathy or Kodikkunnathamma. The word \\"kunnu\\" means hill in Malayalam language. Literally, Kodikkunnu Temple would thus mean the temple situated on top of the hill called \\"Kodi\\". Kodikkunnu is near to Pallippuram railway station and can be accessed from Valanchery, Pattambi and Thrithala, by road. The main deity is Amma means Mother and there is Siva also with almost same importance. To the left of Bhagavathy is the idol of Ganapathi. People come from distant places to worship the goddess. The temple has nada (holy entrance) from 3 directions, viz., north, east and west. The door towards the south is permanently closed. Vehicles can reach the immediate temple premises as there is road reaching the temple. From all three directions there are granite stone-paved steps to reach the temple. Mythology Chirankara Pooram, Ezhunnallathu, the holy processionAll believed in a legend that at some time in the past there was a poor widow and three children living in a house, across the river. She used to tend cows and every morning she would take the milk to the temple, which she exchanged for cooked rice for the day. Once the river was full and the boatman did not dare to make it across. The widow returned and told the children that there would not be any rice till the risen river-waters subsided. She gave boiled milk to the children and put them to bed. At midnight someone knocked on the front door and she found an old woman on the door step all covered up and drenched. The nocturnal visitor placed a brass vessel full of rice in front of the widow and commanded: \\"Wake the children up and feed them!\\" And the figure vanished. After the floods receded, the widow went to the temple with the usual supply of milk. When she discussed the incident with the priest, he was astonished. The priest found that the vessel the widow had left in the temple in which she used to collect the rice had been missing from the sanctum sanctorum for the last three days. Thara visiting houses during \\"Pooram\\" There is a grandmother too, the mother of Kodikkunnu Goddess. She is the chief deity of Muthassiar Kavu (literally, grandmother's temple) near Pattambi. According to one legend the Grandmother Goddess and her three beautiful daughters (including Kodikkunnathamma) were strolling along the river bed on a summer night. They saw a dance festival by the Harijans (low-caste Hindus) and the youngest daughter was so carried away by it, that she refused to go along when it was time to leave. The mother ordered her to be with the Harijans and perform as their guardian deity. This is the popular belief on the origin of Kanakkar Kavu (Kanakkar is a sect of Harijans). Chirankara Pooram, Thara On another occasion the two sisters quarreled after witnessing the ritual of an animal sacrifice. As the younger one was so much engrossed in the gory scene, the elder one parted company and settled down in Kodikkunnu. The younger sister shifted to Kodungallur where blood sacrifices were a common ritual until the recent past. And the two sisters are still angry with the other sister that they have closed their temple doors that face towards Kodungallur. So in Kanakkarkavu and Kodikkunnu Temple there is no \\"thekke nada\\" (entrance from south). Chirankara Pooram, Parappoothan Temple Festivals =Chirankara Pooram= . Chirankara Pooram, People bringing \\"Kettukalas\\" to the templeChirankara pooram (temple festival) is the main festival of Kodikkunnu Bhagavathy Temple. This festival is conducted at Chirankara Mahavishnu temple which is known as the \\"Keezhekkavu\\" of Kodikkunnathamma. Chirankara temple is dedicated to Vishnu and \\"pooram\\" festivals are normally conducted in Durga temples only. But this [Pooram] is conducted there on behalf of Kodikkunnathamma. The area under Pallippuram is divided into smaller administrative geographical units called \\"desam\\". From every desam people will send different type of dancers called \\"Pootan\\" and \\"Thara\\" for performance at the temple during the festival. Chirankara Pooram, Melam The main attractions during the pooram is Chenda melam, Thayambaka and Panchvadyam. From every desam people will bring \\"Kaala\\"(decorated artificial bullock pairs). At the end of the day there will be \\"Vedikkettu\\"(fireworks) which is a very enchanting sight to see. =Kathiratta Vela= The other important festival associated with the temple is the Kathiratta Vela (Festival of Harvest) that is celebrated after the every years harvest.

It is the southwesternmost point of Portugal and of mainland Europe.  History  Cape St. Vincent was already sacred ground in Neolithic times, as standing menhirs in the neighborhood attest. The ancient Greeks called it Ophiussa (Land of Serpents), inhabited by the Oestriminis and dedicated here a temple to Heracles. The Romans called it Promontorium Sacrum (or Holy Promontory). Strabo, in his Geography calls this cape the most western tip of the known world and reports the place was considered magical. Common people believed the sun sank here hissing into the ocean, marking the edge of their world, which Strabo qualifies as \\"common and vulgar reports\\" and attributes to Posidonius Strabo, Geography, III According to legend, the name of this cape is linked to the story of a martyred fourth- century Iberian deacon St. Vincent whose body was brought ashore here. A shrine was erected over his grave; according to the Arab geographer Al-Idrisi, it was always guarded by ravens and is therefore named by him ŸÉŸÜŸäÿ≥ÿ© ÿßŸÑÿ∫ÿ±ÿßÿ® (Kanƒ´sah al-GhurƒÅb, meaning \\"Church of the Raven\\"). King Afonso Henriques (1139‚Äì1185) had the body of the saint exhumed in 1173 and brought it by ship to Lisbon, still accompanied by the ravens. This transfer of the relics is depicted on the coat of arms of Lisbon. All existing buildings‚Äîincluding the Vila do Infante of Henry the Navigator‚Äîfell into ruins because of the Lisbon earthquake of 1755. The Franciscan friars who cared for the shrine stayed on until 1834, when all monasteries were disbanded in Portugal. =Naval battles= Several naval battles have been fought in the vicinity of this cape: * In 1337, a Castilian fleet defeated a Portuguese fleet in the Battle of Cape St. Vincent (1337). * In 1606, a Spanish fleet defeated a Dutch fleet in the Battle of Cape St. Vincent (1606). * In 1641, a Spanish fleet fought with a Dutch fleet in the Battle of Cape St. Vincent (1641). * In 1681, a Spanish fleet defeated a Brandenburger fleet in the Action of 30 September 1681. * In 1693, a French fleet defeated an Anglo-Dutch fleet in the Battle of Lagos (1693). * In 1719, a Spanish fleet defeated a British fleet in the Battle of Cape St. Vincent (1719). * In 1751, a Spanish fleet defeated an Algerian fleet in the Action of 28 November 1751. * In 1780, a British fleet defeated a Spanish fleet in the Battle of Cape St. Vincent (1780). * In 1797, a British fleet defeated a Spanish fleet in the Battle of Cape St Vincent (1797).https://www.thegazette.co.uk/London/issue/14012/page/474 * In 1833, a Loyalist fleet defeated a Miguelite fleet in the Battle of Cape St. Vincent (1833). Geography This cape is the southwesternmost point in Portugal. It forms the southwestern end of the E9 European Coastal Path, which runs for to Narva-J√µesuu in Estonia. Approximately six kilometers from the village of Sagres, the cape is a landmark for a ship traveling to or from the Mediterranean. The cliffs rise nearly vertically from the Atlantic to a height of 75 meters. The cape is a site of exuberant marine life and a high concentration of birds nesting on the cliffs, such as the rare Bonelli's eagle, peregrine falcons, kites, rock thrushes, rock pigeons, storks and herons. The present lighthouse is high and was built over the ruins of a 16th- century Franciscan convent in 1846.

Accessed 2 February 2018. Career Freed had wanted to be a painter, but began taking photographs in the Netherlands and discovered a new passion. He traveled in Europe and Africa before returning to the United States where he attended The New School and studied with Alexey Brodovitch, the art director of Harper's Bazaar. In 1958 he moved to Amsterdam to photograph its Jewish community. Through the 1960s he continued to work as a freelance photojournalist, traveling widely. He documented the Civil Rights Movement in America (1964‚Äì1965), the Yom Kippur War in 1973, and the New York City police department (1972‚Äì1979). His career blossomed during the American civil rights movement, when he traveled the country with Martin Luther King, Jr. in his celebrated march across the U.S. from Alabama to Washington. This journey gave him the opportunity to produce the book Black in White America (1968), which brought considerable attention. His work on New York City law enforcement also led to a book, Police Work (1980). Early in Freed's career, Edward Steichen purchased three photographs from him for the collection of the Museum of Modern Art. In 1967, Cornell Capa selected Freed as one of five photographers to participate in his Concerned Photography exhibition. Freed joined Magnum Photos in 1972. Publications to which he contributed over the years included Der Spiegel, Die Zeit, Fortune, Lib√©ration, Life, Look, Paris-Match, Stern, and The Sunday Times Magazine of London. In later years, Freed continued photographing in Italy, Turkey, Germany, Lebanon and the U.S. He also shot four films for Japanese, Dutch and Belgian television. Personal life Freed was born October 23, 1929 in Brooklyn, New York to Jewish, working-class parents of Eastern European descent. In 1956 he met Brigitte Kl√ºck, who became his wife, while on assignment for Look in Rome. They had a daughter, Elke Susannah. Freed died in Garrison upstate New York of prostate cancer on November 29, 2006. Publications *Joden van Amsterdam, Netherlands: De Bezige Bij, 1958. *Deutsche Juden Heute, Germany: R√ºtten u.

He spent months with the Amazonian Wapishana tribe and later obtained US patents for tipir and cunani, two chemicals derived from plants used by the tribe. In 1968 he travelled on a BBC-funded expedition in the Amazon with the explorer Robin Hanbury-Tenison, having a discussion with him that led to the foundation of Survival International. Patent controversy =Rupununine= Gorinsky patented tipir as rupununine (after the nearby Rupununi river), which is an antipyretic derived from the Greenheart tree. His patent claims it may be used to treat malaria and cancer. The Wapishana tribe grind this nut and use it to stop bleeding and as an abortifacient which provokes miscarriage. They wanted the patent rescinded, but Gorinsky replied: > \\"Tough, isn't it?\\", he says. \\"I was not the only person looking at the > greenheart.

The chemical is also known as ichthyothereol. =Controversy= The 1992 Convention on Biological Diversity, as part of its aim of protecting the knowledge of forest tribes from exploitation, nationalised plant resources and forbid individuals from patenting organic compounds from them.

The genealogy of Muhammad Shah is unclear, and is based on several historical sources and legends. Life The early life of Muhammad Shah is unknown. The current Sultanate of Brunei was formed by Muhammad Shah, with the help of his brothers Awang Pateh Berbai (also known as Ahmad of Brunei, the second Sultan of Brunei) and Awang Semaun. He ruled from 1368 to his death in 1402. He ruled as Raja Awang Alak Betatar until the early 1360s, at which point he converted to Islam to marry the daughter of the King of Temasik (Old Singapore, known as that time in Brunei as Johor). Muhammad Shah died in 1402, and was succeeded by Sultan Abdul Majid Hassan. It is unclear whom Muhammad Shah married, but it is reported either as the daughter of Iskandar Shah, or the daughter of Sang Nila Utama, both of the House of Sang Sapurba. It was noted that Muhammad Shah founded the Sultanate. He sent a mission to China in 1371; the Ming Shih (Book 325), a contemporaneous Chinese reference book, noted that the King of Brunei in 1370 was Ma-ho-mo-sa. Local Brunei historians take this to refer to \\"Muhammad Shah\\" the first Islamic Sultan of Brunei, however others take it to read as \\"Mahmud Shah\\". Another viewpoint is that Ma-ho-mo-sa could be pronounced as \\"Maha Moksha\\", which means Great Eternity, a Buddhist name; this is in keeping by the Chinese record of his successor also having a Buddhist name. His daughter, Princess Ratna Dewi, allegedly married a Chinese immigrant by the name of Ong Sum Ping also named Ong Sum Ping who started a trading station at Mumiang on the Kinabatangan River. For this he was conferred the nobility title of Pengiran Maharaja Lela and elected Chief of Kinabatangan.Pusat Sejarah Brunei Muhammad Jamil Al-Sufri.(1990).

Early life Fallowell was born on 26 September 1948 in London. His family later moved to Somerset and Essex before settling in Berkshire. While at St Paul's School, London, he established a friendship with John Betjeman, and through him, links to literary London. In 1967 he went to Magdalen College, Oxford (BA and MA in History). At the university he was a pupil of Karl Leyser, Hugh Trevor-Roper and Howard Colvin. He was also part of a group experimenting with psychedelic drugs. While an undergraduate he became a friend of the trans-sexual April Ashley, whose biography he later wrote.) and familiar with the \\"Chelsea Set\\" of Swinging London. Career In 1970, at the age of 21, Fallowell was given a pop column in The Spectator. He was subsequently the magazine's film critic and fiction critic. During the 1970s he travelled in Europe, India and the Far East, collaborated on the punk glossies Deluxe and Boulevard, and worked with the avant-garde German group Can. He began writing about Can's music in the British press in 1970 and visited the group in Cologne soon after. He explored other aspects of the German rock scene at the beginning of the 1970s, visiting Berlin, Munich and Hamburg. He wrote verbal covers to many of Can singer Damo Suzuki's non- linguistic vocals and when Damo left the band in 1973, Fallowell was asked if he'd like to take over as vocalist ‚Äì \\"after a long dark night of the soul\\", he decided against it. In 1979 he edited a collection of short stories, Drug Tales. This was followed by two novels, Satyrday and The Underbelly. Chris Petit, reviewing the second for The Times, wrote: \\"The author's pose and prose is that of dandy as cosh-boy.... The writing attains a sort of frenzied detachment found in the drawings of Steadman or Scarfe.\\"Petit, Chris (26 November 1987). The Times. During the 1980s Fallowell spent much of his time in the south of France and in Sicily, celebrated in the travel book To Noto. Patrick Taylor-Martin, reviewing it, called the author \\"stylishly at ease with the louche, the camp, the intellectual, the vaguely criminal. His prose combines baroque extravagance with a shiny demotic smartness.... He is particularly good on sexual atmosphere.\\"Taylor-Martin, Patrick (9 November 1989). The Listener. His second travel book: One Hot Summer in St Petersburg, was the outcome of a period living in Russia's old imperial capital. Michael Ratcliffe, literary editor of The Observer, made it his Book of the Year: it \\"combines, as exhilaratingly as Christopher Isherwood's Berlin writings, the pleasures of travel, reporting, autobiography.... There is candour of every kind... an absolute knockout.\\"Ratcliffe, Michael (11 December 1994). The Observer Review. Anthony Cross, Emeritus Professor of Slavonic Studies at the University of Cambridge, in his book St Petersburg and the British, wrote that Fallowell's \\"evocation of life in the new St Petersburg is a stunning tour de force... in the spirit of Nikolai Gogol.\\" It was while living in St Petersburg that he wrote the first draft of the libretto for the opera Gormenghast, inspired by Mervyn Peake‚Äôs trilogy. With music composed by Irmin Schmidt, this was first staged in 1998 at the Wuppertal Opera in Germany, which had commissioned it. Schmidt was a member of Can and Fallowell had already written the lyrics to two albums of his songs: Musk at Dusk (1987) and Impossible Holidays (1991). This work is also featured in Irmin Schmidt's compilation Villa Wunderbar (2013) and his collection Electro Violet (2015). A third novel, A History of Facelifting, draws on his experience of the Marches, the border country in Herefordshire and mid-Wales, which Fallowell discovered in 1972 when he first visited Hay-on-Wye at the invitation of Richard Booth. Fallowell has visited the area often since then, at times staying for long periods in remote cottages. A third travel book, Going As Far As I Can, recounted Fallowell's wanderings through New Zealand. Jonathan Meades described it as having the ghostly atmosphere of de Chirico's paintings: \\"The text has the movement of a dream,\\" he remarked in the New Statesman feature \\"Books of the Year 2008\\". His books have been controversial ‚Äì Bruno Bayley in Vice wrote that Fallowell has \\"penned novels that people seem to have a tendency to burn.\\"Bayley, Bruno, Vice, 2 December 2009. In the same interview, Fallowell told him, \\"Fiction is such a turn-off word, not because I am against imaginative work ‚Äì of course not ‚Äì but because there is so much crap published as fiction. I am interested in literature. I am not interested in some commercial idea that is simply verbalised. I want high performance language operated by an expert.\\" Roger Lewis dubbed Fallowell \\"the modern Petronius\\" in a recent book. As a journalist Fallowell identified with the New Journalism movement, which advanced a literary form variously taking in reportage, interview, commentary, autobiography, travel, history and criticism. He has only worked freelance. His writings have appeared in The Times, The Sunday Times, Observer, Guardian, Independent, The Daily Telegraph, The American Scholar, the Paris Review, Tatler, Vanity Fair, Marie Claire, Playboy, Penthouse, Encounter, Tages Anzeiger, The Age, La Repubblica, New Statesman, Vice, and many other publications. He has often contributed to the intellectual monthly Prospect and has had columns in The Spectator, the Evening Standard and several online magazines. A collection of Fallowell's interview-profiles, Twentieth Century Characters was described by Richard Davenport-Hines as \\"like Aubrey's Brief Lives in twentieth-century accents. The effect is of a rich, energetic frivolity and passionate curiosity about human types.\\"Davenport-Hines, Richard (4 November 1994). Times Literary Supplement. April Ashley's Odyssey, Fallowell's authorised biography of his friend, was published in 1982. In 2006 April Ashley published what purported to be a new book, her autobiography; but this was discovered to be mostly a reprint of the Fallowell book. After taking legal action, Fallowell received damages, costs, and the reaffirmation of his intellectual property rights; and a public apology from the authors and John Blake Publishing was printed in The Bookseller December 1st 2006. How To Disappear: A Memoir For Misfits was published in 2011 by Ditto Press, designed by Nazareno Crea; it was awarded the PEN/Ackerley Prize for memoir in 2012. Chairman of the judges Peter Parker commended it as \\"a subtle, beautifully written and often very funny example of autobiography by stealth.\\" Alan Hollinghurst, in the Guardian Books of the Year, called it 'brilliant and haunting'. The Independent on Sunday said Fallowell \\"writes like a spikier Sebald, alternating between acerbic witticisms and passages of voluptuous description.\\" He published his fourth novel London Paris New York in 2020 in electronic form via Amazon, at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. Fallowell has for many years conducted an epistolary relationship with the Surrealist Mexican artist Pedro Friedeberg. In an interview with Prospect magazine (May 2008), Fallowell said '. . . both Graham Greene and Harold Acton said that I belong to the 21st century. At the time I was rather distressed by that, as it seemed a form of rejection. But now I understand it a little better.'

The Academy discusses art-related issues, advises the Minister of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology on art-related issues, and promotes art (fine arts, music, literature, dance and drama though the annual Japan Art Academy Award (Nitten), the premier art exhibition in Japan. As a legal entity, it is an extraordinary organ of the Agency for Cultural Affairs. Its headquarters is in Ueno Park, Tokyo. The Japan Art Academy should not be confused with the Japan Art Institute, which is a completely different organization. History The Japan Art Academy was founded in 1907 as the Fine Arts Reviewing Committee (Bijutsu Shinsa Inkai) of the Ministry of Education. It was intended to provide quality standards and a venue for art exhibitions in Meiji period Japan. The first exhibition, or Bunten, was held in 1907. It was renamed the Imperial Fine Arts Academy (Teikoku Bijutsu-in) in 1911 and headed by Mori ≈ågai. The Bunten exhibition was correspondingly renamed the Teiten. After a period where it fell into inactivity, it was reorganized into the Imperial Art Academy (Â∏ùÂõΩËä∏Ë°ìÈô¢, Teikoku Geijutsuin) in 1937. In 1947, after World War II, the Imperial Art Academy became the Japan Art Academy, and its annual exhibition was correspondingly renamed the , which was abbreviated to Nitten (Êó•Â±ï). The government art exhibition Monten (Ministry of Education Art Exhibit) was founded in 1907 and amalgamated with the Teiten (Imperial Art Academy Exhibiion in 191. The Teiten was renames Shinmonten and has been known as Nitten since 1946. In 1958, there was further re- organization whereby the Japan Fine Arts Academy became a solely academic and consultative non-profit organization, and the organization of the Nitten annual exhibition was handled by a separate private company, the Nitten Corporation. Membership The Japan Art Academy is under the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology. It consists of a maximum of 120 members, who are appointed for life. Membership is divided into the following categories A. Fine Arts # Nihonga # Y≈çga # Sculpture # Crafts # Calligraphy # Architecture B.

The exhibition consists five art categories: Nihonga and Western Style Painting, Sculpture, Crafts and Calligraphy. During each exhibition, works of the great masters are shown alongside works of the new but talented artists. The Japan Fine Arts Exhibition decided not to award any of the top prizes in any of the 5 sections for 2013, following the revelation of fraudulent judging in the calligraphy section of the fiscal 2009 show.

Nanda Baba, the village chieftain, built the house atop a large hill to protect Lord Krishna from demons sent by King Kansa. Nanda Maharaja and other decided to move here from Gokula because of the turbulence caused by demons that were trying to kill Krishna. The hill on which the main temple is located is called the Nandisvara Hill. Lord Shiva had prayed to Krishna to be allowed to witness his transcendental pastimes. After Lord Shiva performed penances for many centuries, Lord Krishna asked him his wish. Lord Shiva told him that he wished to be a mountain at Nandgaon, so that the Gopis would step on him, leaving the dust of their feet on him. Krishna granted him this boon and Lord Shiva became the Nandisvara Hill, on which Nandgaon is situated. Nandgaon is a major religious and tourist destination owing to its association with Lord Krishna. Every year thousands flock to the town during Holi.

It is located in the western foothills of the Cascade Mountains in east central King County, Washington. It gets its name from the large amount of water it sometimes carries. The record discharge at the gaging station is over per second. The Raging is a salmon-bearing river and supports one-fifth of the Snoqualmie River's chinook runs. The river begins in the valley formed by Rattlesnake Ridge to the east and Taylor Mountain to the west in the Raging River State Forest, managed by the Washington Department of Natural Resources. It flows northwest, crossing State Route 18, and then continues north past Tiger Mountain, crossing Interstate 90 near Preston, Washington, and joining the Snoqualmie River near Fall City, Washington. The Raging River watershed is part of the larger Puget Sound drainage basin. The average annual flow in the river is per second and the drainage area is 32 square miles. History Until 2009, almost half of the Raging River basin was privately owned. In the spring of that year, the Washington Department of Natural Resources and King County partnered to purchase , filling a large gap in the Mountains to Sound Greenway. Hiking and biking The Preston-Snoqualmie Trail follows along the Raging River and Preston-Fall City Road for a 3¬Ω mile stretch and continues toward Snoqualmie Falls. The trail is bike and dog friendly. In the winter of 2012 the Washington Department of Natural Resources began a public planning activity to guide the development of recreation opportunities in the Snoqualmie Corridor, including specifically the Raging River State Forest. Kayaking The lower half of the Raging River from Preston to Fall City is long and has been rated as a class III+ (difficult) section for kayaking.

Costa M√©ndez was born into a privileged background in Buenos Aires, in 1922. He attended the University of Buenos Aires, graduating with a Law Degree in 1943. He went on to receive his juris doctor and opened a law practice.New York Times (3 August 1992) Costa M√©ndez served as the Argentine ambassador to Chile from 1962 to 1964, and charg√© d'affaires and ambassador to the Republic of China (Taiwan) from 1965 to 1966. He was appointed Foreign Minister by President Juan Carlos Ongan√≠a in 1966 and served in that post until 1969.Clar√≠n (31 March 2002) An avowed anti-Communist, Costa M√©ndez favored close ties with the United States. Costa M√©ndez returned to the Foreign Ministry under a later dictator, Gen. Leopoldo Galtieri, at the end of 1981, and remained in the post during the April-June 1982 Falklands War between the United Kingdom and Argentina.Caught in the Fallout, by Thomas A. Sanction: Time (14 June 1982) President Galtieri, a significant supporter of the Contras during the Nicaraguan Civil War, believed that support would be forthcoming from Reagan administration; when the United States and Western Europe sided with Britain during the conflict, however, Costa M√©ndez sought the support of the Communist bloc, flying to Cuba to attend a meeting of Non- aligned nations and to confer with President Fidel Castro. During meetings at the time of the United Nations Security Council and the Organization of American States, Costa M√©ndez depicted United States support for Britain in the Falklands War as a \\"betrayal to the rest of the Americas,\\" and following Argentine surrender on June 14, Galtieri and his Foreign Minister were removed. Costa M√©ndez's duplicity in his capacity as both the nation's chief diplomat and the junta's leading civilian adviser was highlighted by a local, 1983 official board of inquiry. The report documented that Costa M√©ndez had assured Galtieri that the United States would remain neutral in the event of war, despite an explicit message to the contrary from the American Secretary of State, Alexander Haig (by then, the British Royal Navy was advancing toward the islands). In popular culture Costa M√©ndez was portrayed by Vernon Dobtcheff in the 2002 BBC production of Ian Curteis's controversial The Falklands Play.

Life PetrePetre Family Crest and Name History (pronounced Peter) was born at the family estate of Coptfold Hall, near the village of Margaretting, Essex, to an old recusant family on her father's side; her mother was a convert. Her grandfathers were the 11th Baron Petre and the 4th Earl of Wicklow. Petre was educated privately. In her early twenties she experienced some religious doubts and as a remedy she was advised by her Jesuit confessor Fr. Peter Gallwey to go to Rome and study St Thomas Aquinas. Reflecting many years later on her decision to follow this advice, Petre concluded that \\"it was a fairly crazy idea\\". Nevertheless, in 1885, at the age of 22, she left for Rome where for a year, under the direction of accredited professors, she immersed herself in the thought of Aquinas and in the neo-scholastic manuals then in use. Her aunt Lady Lindsay informed friends that \\"Maude has gone to Rome to study for the priesthood\\".James T. Kelly (ed.) The Letters of Baron Friedrich von H√ºgel and Maude D. Petre. Leuven: Peeters, 2003. Introduction, p. xix. In 1890 Petre joined the Daughters of the Heart of Mary, a community founded in France during the Revolution and following patterns of life innovative with respect to the more traditional female religious institutes. In particular, it allowed members to live in their own homes and wear street clothing instead of habits. She was named local superior in 1896 and provincial in 1900. In 1900 she began a friendship with the Jesuit priest George TyrrellIvana Noble. \\"A Sketch of Divine Love: An Account of Friendship between George Tyrrell and Maude Petre\\" and they soon became part of a circle of questioning Catholic intellectuals. Petre already knew Friedrich von H√ºgel from her childhood, when he was one of her mother's most favoured visitors.Meriol Trevor. Prophets and Guardians: Renewal and Tradition in the Church. London: Hollis & Carter, 1969, p. 48. He introduced both her and Tyrrell to the work of Alfred Loisy.Trevor, 1969, p. 84 She had got to know Henri Bremond while visiting the headquarters of her religious community in Paris. Through her, Bremond and Tyrrell became acquainted.Trevor, 1969, p. 62 When Tyrrell was expelled from the Jesuits in 1906, Petre, who had bought Mulberry House in Storrington, Sussex, had a cottage built for him in the gardenTrevor, 1969, p. 71 and settled an annuity on him.Trevor, 1969, p. 73 In 1907, when Petre's book Catholicism and Independence: Being Studies in Spiritual Liberty was published, she was refused permission to renew her vows in the Daughters of the Heart of Mary. Peter Amigo, the then-Bishop of Southwark, refused Petre the sacraments in his diocese shortly thereafter. She dealt with this by worshipping regularly elsewhere.Trevor, 1969, p. 78 After the death of George Tyrrell in 1909, Maude Petre was concerned to compile his biography. In 1912 she published this in two volumes, although the first was in fact Tyrrell's own autobiography of his earlier years. The evident sympathy that she showed for Tyrrell in his quarrel with the authorities of the Roman Catholic Church led to her work being placed on the Index of Forbidden Books by the Holy See in 1913. This increased her own difficulties with the Catholic hierarchy, but her loyalty to Tyrrell's memory continued with her publication of his Essays on Faith and Immortality in 1914 and a collection of his letters in 1920. Her book on the Modernist movement, Modernism: Its Failure and Its Fruits (published 1918 but completed in 1914), was one of the earliest analyses of the Modernist movement. It is not an objective study, but shows considerable sympathy for the Catholic Modernists, many of whom she knew personally, and is highly critical of the anti-Modernist movement then dominant in the Catholic Church. In the Great War she was involved in nursing work in France and her writings show a growing interest in social and political themes. In her 1915 book Reflections of a Non-Combatant, she was critical of the unthinking patriotic euphoria of the early stages of the war and showed some sympathy for the ideals of pacifism. She wrote various articles during the war on similar themes. In 1918 she published Democracy at the Cross-Roads, in which she pointed to the limitations of democracy in a period when the suffrage was being considerably extended. In 1919 she published, with James Walker, State Morality and a League of Nations, a work on the then nascent League of Nations in which she analysed the practical difficulties behind the ideals of the League. But her 1925 book The Two Cities, or Statecraft and Idealism showed her commitment to internationalism and the need for a genuine reconciliation of peoples beyond mere political agendas in the post-war period. She is important as the only English Modernist to write on social and political matters. In the post-war period she revived her interest in theological and religious issues, continuing her commitment to the ideals of Catholic Modernism. This meant she was an isolated figure in the Catholic Church in this period, when Modernism was very much out of favour. Despite this, she never left the Church and indeed in her memoir My Way of Faith (1937) she spoke of her personal loyalty to the Church and her need of its spiritual guidance in her life. In 1928 she published The Ninth Lord Petre, a study of her ancestor Robert Petre, 9th Baron Petre (1742-1801), which showed him as being as critical of the Catholic Church in his generation as she was in her own. Later she published major studies of Modernist figures, especially von H√ºgel and Tyrrell in Von H√ºgel and Tyrrell: The Story of a Friendship (1937) and the French Modernist, Alfred Loisy, of whom she was a personal friend, in Alfred Loisy: His Religious Significance (published posthumously in 1944). She also published numerous articles on Modernism and related topics. Indeed, she continued to write almost up to her sudden death in London in December 1942 at the age of 79. She was accorded a Requiem Mass at the Assumption Convent, Kensington Square, and was buried at Storrington near to George Tyrrell.Kelly, 2003, p. xxxiii Owing to her unrepentant Modernist views, the bishop of her diocese, Amigo, would not allow a Catholic priest to officiate at her burial.

It is used to create guitar, bass and ukulele tablature scores, among many others. The current version uses the *.ptb file format. The Power Tab Editor is able to import MIDI tracks, and can export to ASCII Text, HTML, and MIDI formats. In addition, individual sections may be exported as bitmap files. The program allows for tablature scores to be created alongside standard musical notation. The software achieves this through the input of tablature. Each Power Tab file contains two scores: guitar and bass. Only one score needs to be used for a Power Tab file. For proper playback, it is required that the time signatures and tempo markers be consistent between the two scores. The latest version was released in 2000. In 2006, the author released an open-source wxWidgets based program named the PT Parser. This code contains useful information for developers who want to write software that can convert, view, play, or edit Power Tab (.ptb) files. The PT Parser project is hosted at Google Code . PowerTab 2.0 project There is a project on GitHub since July 2014 to develop a new version of Power Tab from the scratch, called PowerTab 2.0. It's a cross-platform (Windows, Linux, OS X) open-source solution. This new version can read the old PowerTab 1.7 files as well as GuitarPro files. A main change is that guitar and bass score are now in the same window. Currently (January 2015) the Alpha 6 version is published resp. . Features The software primarily uses tablature notation entry. This is very useful for guitarists who are not familiar with standard notation and for instructing proper positioning on the neck. Other than the expected buttons for normal notation (i.e. time signature, tempo markers, etc.), there are many others that are directed more at the guitarist. These include:Power Tab Editor - Free software downloads and reviews - CNET Download.com * Slurs - in the form of slides or hammer-ons/pull-offs * Vibratos and bends * Harmonics - natural and artificial * Mutes and palm mutes * Tremolos and arpeggiated chords * Whammy bar dips and dives These buttons can be used in either score and the guitar and bass scores are not restricted to the clef, either. It is possible to switch between treble and bass clefs. Power Tab also features several tools to enhance appearance, accuracy and playback for the transcribed music; * Score checker - this checks that there are no notation errors in the score * Score polisher - this aligns ('justifies') the written music so that it is evenly laid out with no gaps * Chord Identification - this tells you the possible names for the chords entered into Power Tab * Shifter tool - this moves groups of notes, whether chords or a melody, in pitch or around the fingerboard (maintaining pitch) * Tonality tools - gives the key signatures that fit best with the music entered * Chord/Tuning dictionary Limitations Some limitations of the software include: * Notes can only be inserted in tablature; it is not possible to enter music in standard modern music notation. * Power Tab Editor can only utilize up to a maximum of seven guitars across both scores (i.e. MIDI voices). * Pick-up measures, for example, are counted as errors although they are commonly used in music. * Swing/shuffle time with swing notes cannot be applied to start or stop part-way through a measure. Conversely, notes in 'even time' cannot be notated within a measure where swing time applies. * When using high and low melodies, redundant rests that are left out (as in regular notation) are counted as errors. * A Segno cannot be used for more than one D.S.. A Double Segno must be added in the same position. * The tremolo, reverb and chorus effects only work on computers where their MIDI drivers and hardware support it. Detailed bugs are listed in the Power Tab Knowledge Base.

Joan Hudson Brown is credited as the founder of the breed and was the first executive secretary of the breed registry. The original breeding goal was to combine the smooth gait of the Tennessee Walker with the small size and refinement of the Welsh pony. Any combination of the two breeds is acceptable for the registry. Foundation stock for the breed included BT Golden Splendor, the first stallion recorded with the registry, and the mare Browntree's Flicka, who was given registration number 1. The desired ambling gaits of the breed are smooth, called the Pleasure Walk and the Merry Walk. Ponies are also able to trot and canter, and have been exhibited in five-gaited competition. The gaitedness ability is hereditary, and promoters of the breed claim that it actually can execute seven gaits, stating that this ability is comparable to the famous Tennessee Walking Horse stallion Roan Allen, though the two additional gaits are not specified.

The airline ticket may be one of two types: a paper ticket, which comprises coupons or vouchers; and an electronic ticket (commonly referred to as an e-ticket). The ticket, in either form, is required to obtain a boarding pass during check-in at the airport. Then with the boarding pass and the attached ticket, the passenger is allowed to board the aircraft. Details Regardless of the type, tickets contain the following information: *The passenger's name *The issuing airline *A ticket number, including the airline's three-digit codeAirline and Airport Code Search at the start of the number *The cities between which the ticket is valid for travel *Flight for which the ticket is valid (unless the ticket is \\"open\\") *Baggage allowance. (Not always visible on a printout but recorded electronically for the airline) *Fare. (Not always visible on a printout but recorded electronically for the airline) *Taxes. (Not always visible on a printout but recorded electronically for the airline) *The \\"Fare Basis\\", an alphabetic or alphanumeric code that identifies the fare *Restrictions on changes and refunds. (Not always shown in detail, but referred to) *Dates for which the ticket is valid *\\"Form of payment\\", i.e. details of how the ticket was paid for, which will in turn affect how it would be refunded. *The exchange rate used to calculate any international parts of the fare and tax *A \\"Fare Construction\\" or \\"Linear\\" showing the breakdown of the total fare Times on airline tickets are generally for the local time zone where the flight will be at that moment.  Issuing an air ticket  An itinerary where multiple passengers are in same reservation with a ticket number for each passenger A revenue passenger on an airline must hold a valid issued ticket. In order for a ticket to be issued, there are two distinct processes; both of these are required: ; Reservation A reservation for an itinerary is made in the airline system, either directly by the passenger or by an agent. The itinerary includes all the above details needed for the issuance of an air ticket, except the ticket number. When the reservation is made, a passenger name record (PNR) will be created which is used to manage the reservation and check in. There can be multiple passengers in a single passenger name record provided that all passengers have the same itinerary and fare type. ; Issuance Having a reservation does not itself entitle the passenger to travel. Only when the airline receives the payment or a passenger redeems miles/points, a ticket is issued which is linked to the reservation and allows the passenger to travel. Historically, reservation and payment are separate steps, which the time between them are defined in the fare rules when the reservation is made. However, it has become more common to require immediate payment on online booking systems. Each passenger must have his/her own air ticket, as shown by an individual ticket number, even when the reservations are linked by a single PNR. Paper tickets A handwritten flight coupon for Biman Bangladesh Airlines A sample Northwest Airlines ticket, computer-printed on ARC-style stock. Note that the ticket's full designation is \\"passenger ticket and baggage check\\". For most of the history of commercial aviation, tickets for air travel were printed on paper. In time, the form of the paper ticket was standardized, with particular information shown in particular places on the ticket coupon. The Airlines Reporting Corporation (ARC) printed many of the standard ticket forms used by airlines and travel agents, and paper tickets were sometimes known as \\"ARC coupons\\" as a result.Airlines Reporting Corporation, \\"About Us\\" The tickets could be written by hand, or typed or printed. The individual sheets comprising the ticket, one per flight segment, could then be stapled together into a booklet with a cover and often with other documents, such as legal notices to the traveler. The ticket doubled as the official baggage check under the Warsaw Convention and Hague Protocol (see photo). Replacement of paper tickets IATA announced that as of June 1, 2008, IATA-member airlines would no longer issue any paper tickets. A ticket is generally only good on the airline for which it was purchased. However, an airline can endorse the ticket, so that it may be accepted by other airlines, sometimes on a standby basis or with a confirmed seat. Usually the ticket is for a specific flight. It is also possible to purchase an 'open' ticket, which allows travel on any flight between the destinations listed on the ticket. The cost of this is greater than a ticket for a specific flight. Some tickets are refundable. However, the lower cost tickets are usually not refundable and may carry many additional restrictions. The carrier (airline) is represented by a standardized two- letter code. In the example above, Thai Airways is TG. The departure and destination cities are represented by International Air Transport Association airport codes. In the example above, Munich is MUC and Bangkok is BKK. The International Air Transport Association is the standard setting organization. Only one passenger can use a ticket. If multiple passengers are traveling together, the tickets are linked together by the same record locator or reservation number, which are assigned, if the tickets were purchased at the same time. If not, most airlines can cross-reference the tickets together in their reservation systems. This allows all members in a party to be processed in a group, allowing seat assignments to be together (if available at the time of the assignment). Resale When paper tickets were still frequently used, some travellers resold their (person-specific) tickets to other travellers (often at discount prices) when their travel plans changed. The seller would then accompany the buyer to the airport at the time of departure. The original owner would check in under his own name, and would check in the buyer's baggage. The buyer then boarded the airplane. However, since most airlines check identification on boarding, this procedure is rarely functional. Using another person's ticket is also illegal in many jurisdictions.

Today, the Chinese-Malay-Indian-Others (CMIO) model is the dominant organising framework of race in Singapore. Race informs government policies on a variety of issues such as political participation, public housing and education. However, the state's management of race, as well as the relevance of the CMIO model, has been a point of contention amongst some in recent years.  Historical background  The practice of classifying the local population based on their races or ethnicities was born out of British colonial practices. Race categories were enshrined through local censuses and the issuance of identity cards. In the early British censuses of British Malaya, ethnic lines were often drawn by birthplace and linguistic or linguistic group. In these censuses, labels such as ‚ÄòHokkien‚Äô, ‚ÄòBoyanese‚Äô and ‚ÄòBengali‚Äô were being used. In the 1891 census, races began to be grouped into broader categories such as Chinese, Malay, and Indian. Up till the 20th century, the largely first and second-generation immigrant population retained strong ties to their respective homelands. These communities continued to be influenced by the ideological movements in their homelands. Such movements included the Chinese Civil War, the Indian independence movement, and the decolonisation efforts in peninsular Malaya and Indonesia. As such, each immigrant community maintained their own sense of nationalism. When Singapore was part of the Federation of Malaysia from 1963 to 1965, inter-racial tensions were rife, culminating in incidents such as the 1964 Race Riots. At the same time, Singaporean political leaders such as Lee Kuan Yew began to advocate for a ‚ÄúMalaysian Malaysia‚Äù, opposing the Malaysian Federal Government's vision of an ethnic-based Malay Malaysia. After Singapore's split from Malaysia, the Singapore government pushed for the development of a ‚ÄúSingaporean Singapore‚Äù identity based on racial equality, with race acting as a secondary identifier alongside the Singaporean national identity. Special rights for Malays were legislated into the Singapore Constitution, symbolically recognising the community as the indigenous people of the land. Singapore also formally adopted four official languages - English, Chinese, Malay and Tamil - and implemented a multilingual education policy. Government policies According to the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA), the child's race registered on their Birth Certificate ‚Äúcan follow that of the child's father, mother or an acceptable mixed race if the parents are of different races.‚Äù The race field cannot be left blank during registration. If parents cannot decide on their child's race at the time of registration, the child's race is provisionally recorded as the father's. The option to record a child's race as double-barrelled (e.g. Chinese-Indian) was introduced in 2010 by the Ministry of Home Affairs. Previously, mixed-race Singaporeans were allowed to choose between either of their parents' races and no allowance was made for mixed-race children, with the exception of Eurasians. For relevant Government policies (e.g. the Ethnic Integration Policy), the first component of a double-barrelled race is used. Singaporeans are allowed to change their race twice: once before the age of 21, and once at or after the age of 21. They would have to execute a Statutory Declaration stating their reason(s) for the change, and undertaking not to change their race again. =Constitution= Racial equality and non- discrimination are set out in Article 12 of the Singapore Constitution, which states: > \\"12.‚Äî(1) All persons are equal before the law and entitled to the equal > protection of the law. (2) Except as expressly authorised by this > Constitution, there shall be no discrimination against citizens of Singapore > on the ground only of religion, race, descent or place of birth in any law > or in the appointment to any office or employment under a public authority > or in the administration of any law relating to the acquisition, holding or > disposition of property or the establishing or carrying on of any trade, > business, profession, vocation or employment. (3) This Article does not > invalidate or prohibit ‚Äî (a) any provision regulating personal law; or (b) > any provision or practice restricting office or employment connected with > the affairs of any religion, or of an institution managed by a group > professing any religion, to persons professing that religion.\\" The Constitution also recognises the special position of Malays as the indigenous people of the land in Article 152: > \\"152.‚Äî(1) It shall be the responsibility of the Government constantly to > care for the interests of the racial and religious minorities in Singapore. > (2) The Government shall exercise its functions in such manner as to > recognise the special position of the Malays, who are the indigenous people > of Singapore, and accordingly it shall be the responsibility of the > Government to protect, safeguard, support, foster and promote their > political, educational, religious, economic, social and cultural interests > and the Malay language.\\" = Language policies = The four official languages (English, Chinese, Malay, Tamil) are recognised in Article 153 the Singapore Constitution. English is the language of administration, and is also seen as a common language for the different races to communicate with one another. Chinese, Malay and Tamil were designated as the ‚ÄòMother Tongues‚Äô of the three respective ethnic groups. The then-Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew, in particular, believed that learning one's Mother Tongue helped maintain one's understanding of cultural values. A bilingual education policy was also introduced, mandating that students learn English as their first language and their respective Mother Tongues (determined by their officially registered race). Today, all students are expected to learn an official Mother Tongue Language. However, Singaporeans who have lived abroad for extended periods, as well as international students, may be granted exemptions from the Mother Tongue language requirement on a case-by-case basis. =Presidential Council for Minority Rights (PCMR)= The Presidential Council for Minority Rights (PCMR) is a non-elected government body which examines legislation to ensure that they do not discriminate against any racial or religious communities. =Parliamentary and presidential elections= According to the Parliamentary Elections Act, each Group Representation Constituency (GRC) must include one member of the minority race such as a Malay or Indian. However, a by-election need not be held to fill a vacancy in any GRC triggered by the death or resignation of an MP, even if there are no other minority candidates in that GRC, or for any other reason. From 2017 onwards, the presidential elections will be reserved for a racial group if that racial group has not represented for five terms. If there are no eligible candidates from that group, the election would be opened to candidates of all races, and the ‚Äúreserved election‚Äù would be deferred to the next Presidential election. The first reserved Presidential Election was held in 2017. =Public housing= The Ethnic Integration Policy implemented by the Housing and Development Board (HDB) sets a quota on who can reside in a public housing flat in a particular block or neighbourhood. The policy was first introduced 1989 to prevent the formation of ethnic enclaves and encourage a balanced racial mix in HDB estates. According to the HDB, the proportion set for a block or neighbourhood ‚Äúis based on the ethnic make-up of Singapore‚Äù. =CPF contribution to community funds= By default, all employees are required to contribute to self-help groups‚Äô funds, namely: Chinese Development Assistance Council (CDAC) Fund, Mosque Building and Mendaki Fund (MBMF), Singapore Indian Development Association (SINDA) Fund and Eurasian Community Fund (ECF). Contribution to the self-help group depends on the race and/or religion of the employee which is indicated on the National Registration Identity Card (NRIC). Contributions are deducted from an employee's wages as well as their share of their Central Provident Fund (CPF) contribution. However, employees have the option of opting-out from contributing to their respective self-help groups. =National service= Malays were virtually excluded from conscription from the beginning of the draft in 1967 until 1977 and, after the policy was eased, were assigned mainly to serve in the police and civil defence (fire brigade), not active combat roles.A Question of Loyalty: Ethnic Minorities, Military Service and Resistance by Alon Peled, 3 March 1993. Seminar Synopses of the Weatherhead Center for International Affairs, Harvard. In The Roar of the Lion City (2007), military analyst Sean Walsh claimed that \\"official discrimination against the Malay population remains an open secret\\". The Ministry of Defence contests the charge, noting that there are \\"Malay pilots, commandos and air defence personnel\\", and stating that \\"the proportion of eligible Malays selected for specialist and officer training is similar to the proportion for eligible non-Malays.\\" = Racial Harmony Day = Racial Harmony Day is celebrated on 21 July, on the anniversary of the 1964 Race Riots. First launched in 1997 by the Ministry of Education in schools, the event has since expanded in reach. Today, grassroots organisations such as the People's Association and the Community Development Councils also celebrate Racial Harmony Day.  Debate  The Singapore state's treatment of race has also faced criticism from some academics. Scholar S. Velayutham argues that the state's constant focus on the ‚Äúspectre of racial violence has literally erased the notion of racism from public and official discourses‚Äù. Velayutham also argues and that ‚Äúthe need to maintain racial harmony, social cohesion and tolerance is repeatedly voiced to render racist practices as non-occurrences‚Äù. Other scholars such as N. Purushotam take issue with the orientalist underpinnings of the CMIO classification, and argue that continued adherence to the model merely avoids reconceptualisation of the term ‚Äúrace‚Äù. The ‚ÄúOthers‚Äù category has also been criticised, with scholar Elaine Ho contending that the grouping of ethnic groups into the category ‚Äúglosses over their social heterogeneity and different needs‚Äù. Nevertheless, CMIO framework retains majority mainstream support among Singaporeans. A 2016 joint survey by Channel NewsAsia and the Institute of Policy Studies showed that a majority of respondents believed that the CMIO classification helps build trust between the races (69%), fosters greater interaction between races (69%) and safeguards minority rights (71%). In a 2017 interview with local newspaper TODAY, the survey's lead researcher Mathew Mathews said that ‚Äú[t]he answer is not dismantling the framework, the answer is to ensure that all the communities continue to be embracing (of others).‚Äù  Academic Research  A literature review in 2018 found 13 studies that investigated racism in Singapore. Given the limitations of the studies, the review made four recommendations for future research: (a) develop a reliable and valid instrument to assess racism, (b) conduct experimental research to examine racism perpetuated by the majority or institutions, (c) examine the negative effects of racism, and (d) develop and evaluate interventions for racism. Following the recommendations, racism was examined in an experimental study. In a simulated hiring decision task, Singaporean Chinese participants rated a Malay job applicant as less competent, less suitable for the job, and recommended them a lower salary ($2890.94 vs $2992.73) than an equally qualified Chinese applicant. The study provided the first and only experimental evidence of racism in Singapore.

At the time Iranian military music had used only traditional drums (naqareh) and trumpets (karnay). On his return to Iran in 1867 the King asked his ambassador to France, Hassan-Ali Garrussi, to hire a French musician to reorganize his military orchestras along Western European lines. Adolphe Niel, then France's Defence Minister, selected Lemaire to take up the post. Once in Iran, Lemaire procured western instruments and organized the training of military musicians at the Dar ul-Funun, where one of his students was Darvish Khan. At the request of the King he also composed the first Iranian national anthem and other military pieces.Wright (2009) pp. 3-4 Lemaire was to spend the rest of his life in Iran but sent piano arrangements of classical Persian music back to Paris where the vogue for orientalism made them popular.

The township is located approximately south-west of the state capital, Melbourne. At the 2016 census, Lavers Hill had a population of 78.  History  Lavers Hill was named after two settlers from Gippsland called Stephen and Frank Laver. The first saw mill was opened in 1900 and so was the church next to the College. Old families from as far back as the 1880s still reside near Lavers Hill, e.g. Speight, Hampshire and Farrell. Development of Lavers Hill happened quickly. Lavers Hill depended on logging and agriculture for its income. It also is dependent on tourism. A bank was opened in 1906, the community hall was opened, a cheese factory and butcher shop were built and also a hotel. A lot of these businesses have closed down. The Community hall was literally blown over in 1930 and rebuilt in 1933. The hotel was burnt down in 1919 and again in 1930. The cheese factory closed and so did the butcher. = Lavers Hill School = The Lavers Hill school was opened in 1910 as a rented room in the cheese factory. Another school was built near the church in 1911. In 1953, Johanna school and this were consolidated. At one point, Lavers Hill school had 500 kids. Today it has around 100 students from Beech Forest, Ferguson, Gellibrand, Lower Gellibrand, Johanna and Hordernvale and was opened 1911. This school has recently celebrated its centenary on 2/3 April 2011.  Town Features  Tourist information is located at the newest establishment in Lavers Hill. Built from recycled local materials \\"The Shoppe\\" showcases the produce and products of the local residents and has an onsite cafe serving homemade pastries and great coffee. Lavers Hill Post Office opened around 1902. Its name is Yatzies and is currently owned by the Yates family. This town used to have a bakery called McDuff's, however it has ceased to function and is up for sale. There is a town hall, opened in 1933. Locals use it for CERT meetings, badminton matches, progress meetings and other uses like that. On the way to Port Campbell, along the right of the road, there is a police station. Opposite to the Police Station there is the roadhouse and the tavern. Lavers Hill is a favourite among tourist hotspots as it is only half an hour to the Twelve Apostles, an hour to Colac, is on the Great Ocean Road, is half an hour to the Otway Fly, and is less than an hour to Apollo Bay. It is the meeting point of the roads to Colac, Cobden, Apollo Bay and Port Campbell.

It has been greatly influenced by the British Riding Pony, the Thoroughbred and Arabian bloodlines.  Characteristics  These ponies are small copies of elegant show hacks, developed from English Riding Pony bloodlines. They range in height from in contrast to the Australian Pony breed, which does not exceed . Australian Riding Ponies have a free-flowing, lower action than many of the older pony breeds. Australian Riding Ponies are of one of the solid colors, with small heads and ears.Australian Riding Pony Stud Book Society  Breed history  Equids are not native to Australia. The imported foundation sires which contributed to the establishment of the Australian Riding Pony were: *Aristocrat of Flawforth, imported in 1973, who was out of the Thoroughbred/Welsh mare Chirk Catmint. *Treharne Talisman a son of Bwlch Valentino *The Laird, imported to South Australia, also a son of Bwlch Valentino. The Australian Riding Pony Stud Book Society was formed in about 1980 in the wake of interest aroused in the Riding Ponies that were shown in several Royal Shows. A foundation section was formed which required at least three crosses of animals from approved breeds before a pony could be entered in Section A. Originally there were four sections, but with the foundation firmly established some have been finished. Nowadays most of the major British and New Zealand bloodlines are represented in the Australian Riding Ponies. The use of artificial insemination has permitted even more bloodlines.  Uses  Today, the pony is mainly used as a children's show mount and for small adult riders. They compete in dressage, show jumping, combined driving, gymkhana, mounted games, and horse shows.

Even though Bose and Mohandas K. Gandhi had differing ideologies, the latter called Bose the \\"Patriot of Patriots\\" in 1942. Bose admired Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi and called him Bapu, recognising his importance as a symbol of Indian nationalism and giving him political expediency as told by Bose to Rash Behari Bose; called him \\"The Father of Our Nation\\" in a radio broadcast from Rangoon in 1944, in which he stated, \\"I am convinced that if we do desire freedom we must be prepared to wade through blood\\",\\"Father of Our Nation\\" (Address to Mahatma Gandhi over the Rangoon Radio on 6 July 1944) The Essential Writings of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose Edited by Sisir K Bose & Sugata Bose (Delhi: Oxford University Press) 1997 pp. 301‚Äì302 a statement somewhat at odds with Gandhi's philosophy of non-violence. Thus, although they shared the goal of an independent India, by 1939 the two had become divided over the strategy to achieve Indian Independence, and to some degree the form which the post- Independence state should take: Gandhi was hostile to industrialisation, while Bose saw it as the only route to making India strong and self-sufficient (in this he may have been influenced, like many other Indian intellectuals of the time, by reports of the success of the Soviet five-year plans). Jawaharlal Nehru disagreed with Gandhi on this point as well, though not over the tactics of protest. Bose was accused of collaborating with the Axis, after he fled to Germany in 1941 and offered Hitler an alliance. He criticized the British during World War II, saying that while Britain was fighting for the freedom of the European nations under Nazi control, it would not grant independence to its own colonies, including India. In 1937 he published an article attacking Japanese imperialism in the Far East, although he betrayed some admiration for other aspects of the Japanese regime.\\"Japan's Role in the Far East\\" (originally published in the Modern Review in October 1937): \\"Japan has done great things for herself and for Asia. Her reawakening at the dawn of the present century sent a thrill throughout our Continent.

She is extremely sensitive‚Äîand rightly so‚Äîabout her self- respect as an Asiatic race. She is determined to drive out the Western powers from the Far East. But could not all this have been achieved without Imperialism, without dismembering the Chinese Republic, without humiliating another proud, cultured and ancient race?

Bose & Sugata Bose (Delhi: Oxford University Press) 1997 p. 190 Bose's earlier correspondence (prior to 1939) also reflects his deep disapproval of the racist practices of and annulment of democratic institutions in Nazi Germany.Bose to Dr. Thierfelder of the Deutsche Academie, Kurhaus Hochland, Badgastein, 25 March 1936 \\"Today I regret that I have to return to India with the conviction that the new nationalism of Germany is not only narrow and selfish but arrogant. The recent speech of Herr Hitler in Munich gives the essence of Nazi philosophy.... The new racial philosophy which has a very weak scientific foundation stands for the glorification of the white races in general and the German race in particular. Herr Hitler has talked of the destiny of white races to rule over the rest of the world. But the historical fact is that up till now the Asiatics have dominated Europe more than have the Europeans dominated Asia. One only has to consider the repeated invasions of Europe by Mongols, the Turks, the Arabs (Moors), the Huns, and other Asiatic races to understand the strength of my argument....\\" The Essential Writings of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose Edited by Sisir K. Bose & Sugata Bose (Delhi: Oxford University Press) 1997 p. 155 He also, however, expressed admiration for the authoritarian methods (though not the racial ideologies) which he saw in Italy and Germany during the 1930s, and thought they could be used in building an independent India. Nevertheless, Bose's tenure as Congress Party President (1938‚Äì39) did not reflect any particular anti-democratic or authoritarian attributes. Nirad C. Chaudhuri, Anton Pelinka and Leonard Gordon have remarked that Bose's skills were best illustrated at the negotiating table, rather than on the battlefield.Subhash Chandra Bose and Muhammed Ali Jinnah of the Muslim League seen here together At the Tripura Congress session of 1939, he demanded giving the British Government a six- month deadline for granting independence and of launching a mass civil disobedience movement if it failed to do so. He believed that \\"... the country was internally more ripe for a revolution than ever before and that the coming international crisis would give India an opportunity for achieving her emancipation, which is rare in human history.\\" Bose's judgment in allying with the Japanese has been questioned, as many argue that he would have been unable to ensure an independent India had he ridden to power on Japanese bayonets, and was in danger of becoming a puppet ruler similar to the fate that befell Puyi, the last Chinese Emperor of Manchuria. In 1943 Rash Behari Bose had urged this on him during his last visit to Subhas Bose in Singapore, pointing out that the Japanese had claimed right of conquest in Manchuria and would do so in India, while Quit India had shown that this would not be accepted by the Indian Nation.; Nevertheless, given the Indian National Army's (INA) overwhelming dependence on Japanese military support, he would have been in a weak position. Bose also seems to have ignored the appalling treatment meted out by the Japanese to the Asian inhabitants of the lands they conquered as part of the Greater East Asian Co-prosperity sphere, which included the forcible recruitment of labour from the overseas Indian population to build projects such as the Burma Railway, and massacres of Malayan Chinese in Singapore where he spent most of the war. Bose has been branded as a fascist in some quarters. Others believe that Bose had clearly expressed his belief that democracy was the best option for India. Had either of the alliances he forged during the war resulted in Indian independence in the manner he envisaged, it would have been at the cost of an Allied defeat in the Second World War, a price that some Indians would argue is too high: Gandhi himself, in the immediate aftermath of the war, said that Bose had been \\"foolish in imagining, that by allying himself with the Japanese and the Germans, who were not only aggressive Powers, but also dangerous Powers, he could get Indian freedom\\". The alternative of non-violent protest within India espoused by Gandhi and the rest of Congress ultimately led to British withdrawal, albeit at the expense of the partition of the country along communal lines. Even before 1939, Congress had secured political concessions from the British in the form of elected provincial assemblies, and an agreement that the British taxpayer would foot the bill for Indian re- armament. Although it was rejected by Congress at the time, the 1942 Cripps mission's offer of full independence after the war could be considered the point at which the British departure became inevitable. Britain's weakness after the war, and domestic political pressure on the Labour Government also made British withdrawal more likely. Publicly at least, Bose never believed that this would happen unless they were driven out by force: as late as 1944, three years prior to independence, he announced that \\"I am honestly convinced that the British Government will never recognise India's demand for independence.\\"\\"Father of Our Nation\\" (Address to Mahatma Gandhi over the Rangoon Radio on 6 July 1944) The Essential Writings of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose Edited by Sisir K Bose & Sugata Bose (Delhi: Oxford University Press) 1997 p. 301 Nirad Chaudhuri considered it a backhanded tribute to Bose that the Congress tricolour and the Muslim League green flag flew together for the last time during the mutiny of the Indian navy in Bombay unleashed in 1946 partly at anger within the Navy at the trial of INA officers by the British. Judith Brown argues that the Mutiny of the Indian Navy was a minor factor in the British decision to leave compared to domestic political pressure, American hostility to any continuation of the Raj, and the breakdown of almost all networks of support and collaboration brought about by thirty years of Congress agitation. By 1946 over 50% of the members of the Indian Civil Service were Indians, and even Churchill recognised that the offer of independence made by the Cripps Mission in 1942 could not now be withdrawn. Quoted from page 326. In this interpretation concerns over the loyalty of the military were only one factor among many amid the general breakdown in authority: nor, it could be argued, did all this necessarily stem from the activities of Bose and the INA. The prospect of communalism infecting the armed forces worried the British just as much.Brown Modern India p. 325 Bose was considered a patriot even by some of his rivals in the Congress. Gandhi himself wrote that Bose's \\"... patriotism is second to none\\",Gandhi, Mohandas K. The Collected Works of Mahatma Gandhi (Ahmedabad: The Publications Division, Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, Government of India, Navajivan Trust, 1972‚Äì78), Volume LXXXIII, p. 135 and he was moved to proclaim after Bose's death that he was a \\"prince among patriots\\"‚Äîa reference, in particular, to Bose's achievement in integrating women and men from all the regions and religions of India in the Indian National Army. Bose wanted freedom for India at the earliest opportunity, and to some extent, he didn't care who he had to approach for assistance.

Early years F Shields, Factory Girls at the Old Clothes Fair, Knott Mill (1875; Manchester Art Gallery) Frederic James Shields was born in Hartlepool. He was brought up in extreme poverty, and as a young man was employed on hack-work for commercial engravers. He managed to study art briefly at evening classes in London and then in Manchester, where he settled in about 1848. He spent much of his artistic life in Manchester, and it was there that his drawings and watercolours were noticed and appreciated. Book illustrations F Shields. The Plague Cart. 1862 The Manchester Art Treasures Exhibition of 1857 made a great impression on Shields. His style became more elegant and minute. Inspired by Edward Moxon's illustrated edition of Poems by Alfred Tennyson (1857), he started to work in black-and-white as a book illustrator. His designs for Daniel Defoe's History of the Plague (1862) and John Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress (1864) were very successful and brought him admirers, among whose were John Ruskin and Dante Gabriel Rossetti. In May 1864 Shields went to London and met Rossetti, through whom he soon came to know the whole Pre-Raphaelite circle. Influenced by Rossetti and Ford Madox Brown, Shields was sensitive to the artistic legacy of William Blake who was admired by the Pre-Raphaelites. His portrayal of the room in which William Blake had died (Manchester Art Gallery, a version at Delaware Fine Art Museum, USA) inspired a poem by DG Rossetti.Letter to Frederick Shields, 21 May 1880 F Shields' design of the book by A Gilchrist, Life of William Blake. 1880Frederic Shields was deeply religious man. His faith influenced his artistic manner which was gradually becoming more mannered and mystical in theme. These changes can be seen in his most significant book design ‚Äì the second edition of Alexander Gilchrist's Life of William Blake (London: Macmillan, 1880. 2 vols). It was inspired by Rossetti about whom The New York Times wrote: > Rossetti shows increasing zeal in /‚Ä¶/ recommending others who would be > qualified to help with the work. Of Frederic Shields he says, 'Of course his > labour would be purely one of love. He is an ardent worshipper of Blake, and > no man could write better about him or with more practical exactness.'The > New York Times. 30.11.1919. Shields' binding can be considered today as a very fine example of early Art Nouveau style. In London In 1865, he was elected an associate of the Royal Watercolour Society, but it was not until 1876, after a visit to Italy, that he finally settled in London. All Saints Church, Birchington showing the grave and two stained glass lights in the little window commissioned by his mother His relations with the Rossetti family remained very close. He was in constant correspondence with Christina Rossetti, and in 1883, after the death of DG Rossetti, his mother commissioned from Shields \\"two lights in stained glass, to be placed in the little window which overlooks the grave of Dante Gabriel Rossetti in the churchyard at Birchington, near Margate.\\"Athen√¶um. 22 September 1883. P.181.'The Rossetti Windows The first light (left side) is Rossetti's own design adapted by Shields from The Passover in the Holy Family: Gathering Bitter Herbs (watercolour, 1855‚Äì56, Tate Gallery). The second light is designed by Shields and portrays Christ leading the Blind Man Out of Bethsaida. The inscription under the window reads: ‚ÄúTo the glory of God and in memory of my Son Gabriel Charles Dante Rossetti. Born in London 12 May 1828. Died at Birchington Easter Day 1882.‚Äù Shields's drawing of Rossetti's faceAn extract from Rossetti's brother's diary states a man from Bruccianis, London was commissioned to take a cast of Gabriel's face. This proved extremely disappointing. So the family requested Shields make a drawing of him, which he duly did. Shields recorded in his diary \\"Made two copies (in misery) of the drawing of Rossetti's face for Christina and Watts.‚Äù Shields also became a very close friend with the artist Emily Gertrude Thomson. He shared a stained glass commission with her named The Britomart Window at the Cheltenham Ladies' College based upon six pictures taken from Spenser's allegory The Faerie Queene. Emily produced a portrait of Frederic Shields (shown above) and when he finally retired to Morton in Surrey she frequently visited him. F Shields. Saturday Night from a drawing in red chalkShields made numerous chalk drawings. In 1864 he had begun to experiment with a certain French \\"compressed charcoal\\". He showed this medium to Rossetti who at once adopted this material alone for all his larger studies. F Shields. Charger. 1890sShields also undertook designing of three-dimensional objects of applied art. Several artefacts, designed, painted and signed by Shields are known. Shields however strived for large-scale projects of spiritual content. This might have been the reason that in 1879, when the murals on the history of Manchester for Manchester Town Hall were commissioned from both Ford Madox Brown and Frederic Shields, he withdrew, leaving Brown to complete all twelve works. Madox Brown did however immortalise Shields in one of the Manchester Murals: he made him sit for Wycliffe in the fresco of the Reformer's Trial. Shields' most important legacy is three successive series of designs for stained glass and mural decorations for the Chapel of Eaton Hall, Cheshire, seat of the Dukes of Westminster (1876‚Äì1888); for the private chapel of WH Houldsworth in Kilmarnock (1877‚Äì1879) and for the St Elisabeth's Church, Reddish, Stockport (1881‚Äì1883); and finally for the Chapel of the Ascension, Bayswater Road, London (1888‚Äì1910). Eaton Hall Chapel, Cheshire Eaton Hall Chapel, CheshireThe Eaton Hall, Cheshire was designed by Alfred Waterhouse and built in 1873‚Äì1874 for Hugh Lupus Grosvenor, 1st Duke of Westminster (1825‚Äì1899). From 1876‚Äì1888, Shields provided for its chapel designs for stained glass and stone mosaics on the theme 'Te Deum Laudamus'. Interior of the Eaton Hall ChapelF Shields. Stained glass at Eaton Hall ChapelThis large-scale commission helped him to clarify and formulate his thoughts on Art as applied to the Faith: \\"Nearly ninety subjects, all told, not isolated, but such as could be linked in blessed continuity ‚Äì to keep the heart hot, and the mind quick, with its grand purpose ‚Äì the Praise of God and of his Son Jesus Christ, from the lives of apostles, prophets, martyrs, and the Holy Church of all the ages.\\"Mills, Ernestine. Life and Letters of Frederic Shields. 1912. P.226. This work firmly established his international reputation. It was praised in Boston magazine The Atlantic Monthly in 1882: \\"It is in the interpretative function of art that Mr Shields has shown his great power; and the interpretation is not of a school of thought, nor of a historic tradition, nor of an individual fancy, but of a catholic and comprehensive conception of the spiritual life. The domination thought is in the vivifying power of the spirit, and the religious sentiment is unhesitating and profound.\\"Scudder, H E. An English Interpreter. The Atlantic Monthly. Vol.L. 1882 In 1884, the New York Times, commenting on Shields' Eaton Hall Chapel designs, wrote: \\"Mr Shields, who occupies a distinguished position as an artist in England, owes his reputation in part to the notice taken of his early works by Mr J. Ruskin and Rossetti and their judgement of his in his earliest efforts was not mistaken. Mr Shields‚Äôs career as an artist, shows, that from making lithographic prints for bedecking bolts of calico, he rose by hard work to be one of the leading painters of religious subjects in England.\\"The New York Times, 4 August 1884. The Private Chapel of WH Houldsworth in Kilmarnock and St Elisabeth's Church, Reddish, Stockport Frederic Shields. St John the Baptist. 1877‚Äì1878. Manchester Art GalleryIn 1877‚Äì79, Frederic Shields produced designs on the subject \\"The Triumph of Faith\\". They were to decorate the private chapel of the industrialist and mill-owner WH Houldsworth. Born in Manchester, he eventually made his home in Kilmarnock, Scotland, and it was there that Shields' designs meant to be. The design drawings were accomplished in 1878‚Äì1879. Alexander McLaren who saw them in April 1879, wrote: \\"Wealth of reverent thought and profound suggestiveness /.../ in power and harmony, in weighty meaning expressed in fair shape, in delightful and not too misty symbolism they seem to me to surpass all that you have done, so far as I know it. /.../ I only wish they were not going to be buried in a hole in Ayrshire.\\"A McLaren to F Shields. 30 April 1879.In: Ernestine Mills. The Life and Letters of Frederic Shields. London, 1912.P.239. The idea of using of Shields' designs at the Kilmarnock chapel was eventually abandoned. The designs were reworked and re-used a few years later, at St Elisabeth's Church, Reddish, Stockport, which was commissioned by WH Houldsworth from Alfred Waterhouse. The church was designed in Neo-Gothic style and built in 1881‚Äì1883. In comparison with the Kilmarnock chapel, the decorative scheme was much expanded, and Shields' cartoons provided designs for stained glass windows.Rev. F.Rothwell. The Triumph of Faith, being a Short description of the windows of this church. Reddish. 1909. The cartoons themselves were bought from Frederic Shields by Manchester cotton manufacturer Henry Steinthal Gibbs (1829‚Äì1894) and eventually found their way to Manchester Art Gallery.Gibbs, HS. Autobiography of a Manchester Cotton Manufacturer: or, Thirty Years Experience of Manchester. London: J. Heywood. 1887. The Chapel of the Ascension, London His intense religious feeling was expressed even more strongly in his last large-scale project: the cycle of murals that he painted in 1888‚Äì1910 for the Chapel of the Ascension in the Bayswater Road, London. The Chapel was commissioned by Emelia Russell Gurney, the widow of judge and politician, the Recorder of London Russell Gurney (1804‚Äì1878). It was envisaged as a little decorated hall inspired by Italian Renaissance architecture and paintings. Young architect Herbert Percy Horne (1864‚Äì1916) was to build the chapel, and Frederick Shields to decorate it. The initial idea was however developed and clarified under the strong influence of Shields' religious feelings and artistic views: \\"It involves great issues, and may lead to a new departure in the alliance or service of Art to Piety. Symbols affect men‚Äôs imagination and faith mightily still. The little spot should be pure ‚Äì so that anything that defileth ‚Äì if it entered ‚Äì should feel itself abhorred and reproved silently. I would wish it lit from the roof, shut out from all but heaven‚Äôs vault‚Ä¶\\"Mills, Ernestine. Life and Letters of Frederic Shields.1912. P.294. F Shields. Prophet Daniel. Wolverhampton Art GalleryMrs Russell Gurney suggested that Shields and Horne travel to Northern Italy for close study of examples of Renaissance architecture and decoration. In the autumn 1889, Shields and Horne visited Milan, Pisa, Lucca, Florence, Assisi, Rome, and Orvieto. As a result, Shields created a complex iconographical programme, in which Biblical subjects were mingled with more allegorical concepts. He wrote to G F Watts: \\"I should have to write a book to lay before you my scheme, but Prophets and Apostles, Christian Virtues and worldly vices, Gospel and Apostolic history, types and symbols all enter into it.\\"Mills, Ernestine. Life and Letters of Frederic Shields.1912. P. 306. For the Chapel of the Ascension, Shields re-used a number of images of prophets and apostles which had earlier been designed for the Eaton Chapel. But what had been realised at Eaton Chapel in medium of stained glass and stone mosaics (which he did not like), appeared at the Chapel of the Ascension as oil paintings on canvas. The harmony of decorative art and architecture which had been achieved by Horne and Shields was greatly appreciated by their much younger contemporary Frank Brangwyn. He would later describe Shields' decorations as \\"irrespective of fashion and the changing of artistic outlook. These decorations are, in every sense, the most complete examples of decoration done in England.\\"Belleroche, W. Brangwyn's Pilgrimage. London: Chapman & Hall, 1948. P.122 The Chapel of the Ascension was severely damaged during the Second World War and Shields' mosaics and paintings perished. Shields' designs however survived. They were recovered and secured by Frank Brangwyn in the late 1940s and given to several regional museums in England, namely Wolverhampton Art Gallery and William Morris Gallery, Walthamstow. St Ann's Church, Manchester North AisleSouth AisleAmongst other important commissions, Shields designed the windows in the Chancel of St Ann's Church, Manchester. He drew out a complete scheme for the church's stained glass based upon the theme of a Shepherd. The east windows behind the altar and the north and south aisles all have this theme, and were the work of Heaton, Butler and Bayne. The north aisle window was installed in commemoration of The Diamond Jubilee of Queen Victoria. After a bomb attack by the IRA on Manchester in 1996 the window was restored in memory of Maria Isabella Blythe ‚àí1898-1985. The inscription below the south aisle window reads ‚Äì To the Glory of God initiated by lay helpers of this parish, dedicated at the Coronation of King Edward VII (1902) Personal details In August 1874 in Manchester, Shields married Matilda Booth (b. 1856), a young girl who used to be his model. Matilda's little sister Jessie (b. 1870) was adopted by the Shields family soon after their marriage and sent to school for several years. The marriage was not successful. They did not have children and much of the time lived separately. He was buried in Merton Old Church, Merton, London SW19. Literature * Ernestine Mills.

It is a medium-sized honeyeater, about in length. Both sexes are a light greyish brown with dark brown centres to the feathers, which give the appearance of stripes. The stripes are particularly distinct on the head and back of the neck. While it is found mainly in inland eastern Australia where it inhabits the drier open forest, it is also found in coastal swamp forest from southeast Queensland to the central coast of New South Wales. Although a honeyeater, the striped honeyeater relies on insects as its major food source, and its bill has been adapted to an insect diet. When not breeding it has been recorded feeding and travelling in small groups, but it nests singly, laying around three eggs in a deep cup-shaped nest suspended from the end of drooping branches. It is widely distributed and common within its range, thus the population is listed as being of least concern for conservation by the IUCN. Taxonomy The striped honeyeater was first described by English ornithologist and bird artist John Gould in A Synopsis of the Birds of Australia and the Adjacent Islands, published in 1838. It is a member of the family Meliphagidae, the honeyeaters, and the sole member of the monotypic genus Plectorhyncha. Molecular studies indicate that this genus is closely allied to the monotypic genus Grantiella, though dissimilar in appearance. The painted honeyeater (Grantiella picta) and the striped honeyeater are part of a subclade that includes also Philemon and Xanthotis. The generic name Plectorhyncha is derived from the Ancient Greek plƒìktron 'spear-point' and rhynkhos 'bill' and refers to the fine-pointed bill. The species name lanceolata comes from the Latin for 'lance-shaped' in reference to the long, pointed feathers on the throat and breast. The bird is also referred to as the lanceolated honeyeater. Honeyeaters are related to the Pardalotidae (pardalotes), Acanthizidae (Australian warblers, scrubwrens, thornbills, etc.), and the Maluridae (Australian fairy-wrens) in the large superfamily Meliphagoidea.  Description  Gleaning in a eucalypt The striped honeyeater is a medium-sized honeyeater with a body length of , a wingspan of , and an average weight of . The upper parts are generally light greyish brown with dark brown centres to the feathers, giving the appearance of stripes. These stripes are marked on the head and nape, less distinct on the rump and almost absent from the upper tail coverts. The underparts are whitish with faint streaks on the belly. The feathers of the upper breast and throat are long and pointed, giving the head a spiky appearance. The wing and tail are both moderately long with rounded tips. The bill is short, with a sharp pointed appearance, dark blue-grey grading to a grey-black at the tip and around the nostrils. Legs and feet are blue-grey with black claws. The bare skin around the eye is dark brown and the iris a dark black-brown. Males and females are similar in appearance. Juvenile birds are slightly browner than the adults, with buff or brown edges to the feathers of the wings and back. Juveniles have a duller, less streaked appearance than adults. Juveniles moult into adult plumage at around one year old. There is no seasonal difference in the plumage of breeding birds. The striped honeyeater's song is described as a chirp, chirp, cherry, cherry, its contact call as a sharp ', and its alarm call as a shrill, whistling note. Distribution and habitat This species is found mainly in eastern Australia, predominantly inland. It inhabits the drier open forests, such as mallee and mulga, but also heathland and mangroves on the coast. An observer in 1923 was surprised to find a small number of striped honeyeaters nesting at Forster on the New South Wales mid- north coast, saying \\"it is a remarkable fact for this bird to leave its proper habitat so far inland, to come to the coast\\". However, the range has expanded, and contemporary accounts give its distribution as eastern Australia from central and southeast Queensland extending inland to southeast South Australia, and along the coast south to the Tuggerah Lakes, New South Wales. Small irruptions associated with weather patterns and habitat changes have been recorded in areas outside its usual range, including the Grampians and the Adelaide Plains. It occurs in a wide variety of habitats, including riparian woodlands such as river red gum, bimble box and black box with an understory of lignum or saltbush; mallee woodland, especially where mixed with thickets of broombush or emu bush; woodlands of native pine growing on sand ridges; and semi-arid scrubland dominated by Acacia including lancewood. On the coast, the striped honeyeater is found in swamp forests of paperbark and Casuarina, and in developed areas containing native and exotic trees and shrubs such as caravan parks, reserves, gardens, and farms and orchards.  Behaviour  =Feeding= Feeding on berries Although a honeyeater in origin, the striped honeyeater's food source is primarily insects, and its diet includes seeds and fruits as well as nectar. Its bill has evolved to a short, straight, sharply pointed shape more suited to probing crevices for insects, than to probing flower tubes. It has the honeyeater's brush tongue and takes nectar from shallow flowers such as eucalypt blossoms. It is arboreal, mostly feeding amongst the foliage in the canopy of trees. Most food is obtained from the leaves, and less often from the bark or flowers and fruit. The major foraging methods are gleaning from leaves and dead branches, probing under loose bark and in crevices, probing woody fruits of Black Oak, probing flowers of Yorrell (Eucalyptus gracilis) and sallying for insects. The striped honeyeater occasionally hangs upside-down to extract insects. =Social behaviour= The striped honeyeater has most often been observed singly or in twos, and occasionally in small flocks. When not breeding it has been recorded feeding in loose mobile groups, drinking in mixed groups with miners, and travelling in small groups. It engages in a high level of social activity, including perching closely and allopreening, and when feeding in groups chasing, calling and scolding. The non-breeding striped honeyeater is vocal, calling while feeding and perching, though only occasionally calling in flight. It has been recorded engaged in a display of wing-raising and calling, and performing duets or call-and-response song. Sitting on the suspended nest While the striped honeyeater aggressively defends its nest by dive-bombing people and animals who come too close, and has been observed singing from display perches, it is not known to be territorial. It often feeds near other species of honeyeater and no inter-species aggression has been noted. =Breeding= The striped honeyeater breeds throughout its distribution range, usually as simple pairs, with both sexes building the nest, incubating and feeding the young. However, cooperative breeding has been observed, with a third adult bird involved in feeding nestlings. It nests solitarily, and pairs use the same or adjoining trees for nesting over two or more seasons. The breeding season is from August to January, though dependent on local conditions. The nest site is usually in the drooping foliage of a tall shrub or low tree, such as Casuarina, Melaleuca, Acacia, and mallee eucalypts. The site is sometimes near to or overhanging water, and the nest is usually constructed at the end of a drooping branch, suspended from twigs or foliage. The striped honeyeater often nests in the vicinity of a nesting butcherbird. It builds a deep cup-shaped or bag-shaped nest, with thick walls and the lip of the opening turned slightly inwards. The nest is made from thin dry grass and coated with plant down, feathers or wool, such that the coating often completely obscures the grass framework. It is lined with spider webs, hair, wool or rootlets, and on occasion flowers and tissue paper. The striped honeyeater will commonly re-use material from previous nests. The eggs are an elongated oval by somewhat pointed at one end. They are a dull white, smooth and lustreless or slightly lustrous, and moderately blotched with reddish- brown marks over the whole shell, though more profusely towards and over the larger end. The striped honeyeater lays an average of three eggs at 24-hour intervals. The eggs are incubated by both parents who sit constantly in alternating periods of around 20 minutes for 16 or 17 days. The fledging period is also around 16 days. The nests of the striped honeyeater are parasitized by the pallid cuckoo (Cacomantis pallidus). Conservation status Because of its wide distribution and stable population, the conservation status of the striped honeyeater has been evaluated by the IUCN as being of least concern.

It was built during the high Middle Ages. Despite this, the castle is documented only in a few found texts, and much of the castle's history is not known. However, in the chronicle of Muri Abbey, a castle that could perhaps fit Ruine Wulp's description - a castle in proximity to Zurich and Lake Zurich - was mentioned, but this has not been confirmed by other findings and is mere speculation. Also, a person named Eghart of K√ºsnacht was mentioned in the chronicle and several other documents to be the owner of the castle in the late 11th century. History While no cemented and sure truth about the castle can be confirmed, progress has been made, including the finding of Bronze Age remnants after the excavation of the castle site, such as palisades. Another photograph of the ruined castle of Ruine Wulp Other items have been uncovered about the castle's past, such as the altering of the castle in the 13th century, when it is presumed that most or all of the castle was replaced with a single tower and a central building, with only sections of the main wall still existing. After an unknown period of time, the Barons von Regensberg are known to have assumed ownership of Ruine Wulp, and also are known to have made plans to completely renovate the castle, but the plans probably were never realised. =Excavation= The castle and the castle site were excavated and conserved in 1920 - 1923, 1961‚Äì1962, 1978 and 1980 - 1982. The task was performed by the adornment association K√ºsnacht, and in 1923, the area and castle were placed under the protection and responsibility of the federation. Downfall of the castle Several theories exist about how the castle may have come to an end, and historians are in debate. Some theories include: *The Barons von Regensberg destroyed the castle for an unspecified or unknown reason, or they demolished it with the intent of building a new castle that was never finished. *The castle was destroyed in 1267 by the inhabitants of Zurich. This theory is confirmed by several old documents, but by no other found evidence. *The castle was abandoned sometime in the late 13th century, and deteriorated over time.

The first president was Percy J. Marks. At the first business meeting of the Society, the then-president of the Royal Australian Historical Society K. R. Cramp expressed the view that the chief object of the Society should be the encouragement of individual research.Australian Jewish Historical Society Journal, Volume I, Part 1. (1939) In 1939, the Society published the first issue of the Australian Jewish Historical Society Journal (initially known as the Australian Jewish Historical Society, Journal and Proceedings). In 1949, a Melbourne branch was established, which was informally known as AJHS (Vic). This branch grew and eventually incorporated. There is no national executive, with the Sydney and Melbourne Societies being financially independent. Since 1988, the two Societies have shared the production of the Journal, with the June issues being produced by the NSW Society and the November issues being produced by the Vic Society. Currently, there are two issues of the Journal each year, with occasional Special Publications. The Society's website contains unique content relating to the story of Jews in Australia since 1788. All issues of the Society's Journal are online. Abstracts are freely available. Members ($AUD60 p.a.) and Subscribers ($AUD30) have full access to all articles. The website also has unique information on the history of Jews in Australia since 1788. Included are databases of births, deaths and marriages. A unique database of the names of all Jews who served in the Australian armed forces in the Boer (or South African) War, World War I and World War II is an invaluable tool for researchers and genealogists. AJHS (NSW) maintains extensive archives as well as a research library at the Sydney Jewish Museum in Darlinghurst NSW. A closed collection is also housed at the Archive of Australian Judaica located at Fisher Library in Sydney University. AJHS (NSW) has been charged by the NSW Jewish community to advise, collate and store the archives of the Sydney Jewish community. Professional archiving staff have been brought on board to manage this process. AJHS (Vic) has also collected extensive archives, which were placed on indefinite loan to the State Library of Victoria in 2004.Archives, Records, and Libraries of the Australian Jewish Historical Society Since 2012 the AJHS (Vic) has shared with the Australian Jewish Genealogical Society of Victoria a library including both books and archival records within the Lamm Jewish Library of Australia.Lamm Jewish Library of Australia In addition to the Sydney and Melbourne chapters, there is also a small Canberra-based affiliate and there are members in all states and overseas. From 1977 to 2006, AJHS (Vic) members under the leadership of Beverley Davis transcribed the headstones of over 40,000 Jewish graves in Australia and New Zealand, as well as Jewish War Graves overseas. This collection of burial data, called The Beverley Davis Burial Database (BD-BD), was placed online in June 2008. It has since been updated with more than 70,000 records based on information from Chevrei Kadisha around Australia and is now incorporated into the Australian Jewish Historical Society website burial database. In 2007, the Society under the leadership of AJHS (Vic) president Dr Howard Freeman made a notable but unsuccessful attempt to retain intact within Australia the so-called Gurewicz Archives.Community gets fresh chance to purchase Gurewicz Archive (29 May 2008) The Gurewicz Archives was collected by Rabbi Joseph Lipman Gurewicz, born in Vilna in 1885. Rabbi Gurewicz arrived in Australia in 1932, becoming the spiritual head of the United Congregations of Carlton. He was an authority in Halachic (legal) matters. The Archives consists of files of documents covering all matters related to Judaism and reflecting the variety of issues confronting Melbourne Jewry in the 1930s to 1950s. The New York purchaser removed much of the Holocaust material, rabbinic communications to Lithuania, Palestine, and material on the Dunera, and sold the remainder at auction to the Jewish Museum of Australia in June 2008.AJN: Jewish Museum buys Gurewicz Archive See also * History of the Jews in Australia * Australian Jewish Genealogical Society References External links * Australian Jewish Historical Society web site (New South Wales) * Australian Jewish Historical Society web site (Victoria) Category:Historical societies of Australia Category:Jewish Australian history Category:Jews and Judaism in Melbourne Category:Jews and Judaism in Sydney Category:1938 establishments in Australia ","title":"Australian Jewish Historical Society"},{"id":"10532825","text":"Jean-Pierre Worms (16 July 1934 ‚Äì 12 July 2019) was a French sociologist and former parliamentarian who was active in the associative sector.

Most of the population is Hindu, the town is well known for its temples in particular the sai baba temple near the ferry booking office which observes a number of devotees from nearby region mostly gathering on Thursdays. The town saw a boom during 1980s and 1990s because of fish exporting and smuggling, in which many of them created good wealth but after the Mumbai riots in early 1990s most of smuggling stopped and fishing again became primary source of income . The town is totally unplanned with poor sanitation system, it's because of being located over a hard rocky out crop, with limited scope of any improvement.

The term \\"Greco-Roman world\\" (also \\"Greco-Roman culture\\" or ; spelled Graeco-Roman in Commonwealth), as understood by modern scholars and writers, refers to geographical regions and countries that culturally and so historically were directly and intimately influenced by the language, culture, government and religion of the ancient Greeks and Romans. A better-known term is classical civilisation. In exact terms the area refers to the \\"Mediterranean world\\", the extensive tracts of land centred on the Mediterranean and Black Sea Basins, the \\"swimming pool and spa\\" of the Greeks and the Romans in which those peoples' cultural perceptions, ideas and sensitivities were dominant. That process was aided by the universal adoption of Greek as the language of intellectual culture and commerce in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea and of Latin as the languages of public management and forensic advocacy, especially in the Western Mediterranean. Greek and Latin never became the native languages of the rural peasants, the great majority of the empire's population, but those were the languages of the urban and cosmopolitan elites and the empire's lingua franca, even if only as corrupt or multifarious dialects to those who lived within the large territories and populations outside the Macedonian settlements and the Roman colonies. All Roman citizens of note and accomplishment, regardless of their ethnic extractions, spoke and wrote in Greek or Latin, such as the Roman jurist and imperial chancellor Ulpian, who was of Phoenician origin; the mathematician and geographer Claudius Ptolemy, who was of Greco-Egyptian origin; and the famous post-Constantinian thinkers John Chrysostom and Augustine, who were of Syrian and Berber origins respectively. Also, the historian Josephus Flavius was of Jewish origin but spoke and wrote in Greek. Cores A map of the ancient world centred on Greece. Based on the above definition, the \\"cores\\" of the Greco-Roman world can be confidently stated to have been the Italian Peninsula, Greece, Cyprus, the Iberian Peninsula, the Anatolian Peninsula (modern-day Turkey), Gaul (modern-day France), the Syrian region (modern-day Levantine countries of Israel, Central and Northern Syria, Lebanon and Palestine), Egypt and Roman Africa (corresponding to modern-day Tunisia, Eastern Algeria and Western Libya). Occupying the periphery of that world were the so-called \\"Roman Germany\\" (the modern-day Alpine countries of Austria and Switzerland and the Agri Decumates, the territory between the Main, Rhine and Danube Rivers), the Illyricum (modern-day Northern Albania, Montenegro, Bosnia and Herzegovina and the coast of Croatia), the Macedonian region, Thrace (corresponding to modern-day Southeastern Bulgaria, Northeastern Greece and the European portion of Turkey), Moesia (roughly corresponding to modern-day Central Serbia, Kosovo, Northern Macedonia, Northern Bulgaria and Romanian Dobrudja), and Pannonia (corresponding to modern-day Western Hungary, the Austrian L√§nder of Burgenland, Eastern Slovenia and Northern Serbia). Also included were Dacia (roughly modern-day Romania and Moldavia), Mauretania (modern-day Morocco, Western Algeria and Northern Mauritania), Jordan, Southern Syria and Egypt's Sinai Peninsula) and the Tauric Chersonesus (modern-day Crimea and the coast of Ukraine). The Greco-Roman world had another \\"world\\" or empire to its east, the Persians, with which there was constant interaction: Xenophon, The Anabasis, the March Up Country, the Greco-Persian wars, the famous battles of Marathon and Salamis, the Greek tragedy The Persians by Aeschylus, Alexander the Great's defeat of the Persian emperor Darius III and conquest of the Persian empire, or the later Roman generals' difficulties with the Persian armies, such as Pompey the Great, and of Marcus Licinius Crassus (conqueror of the slave general Spartacus), who was defeated in the field by a Persian force and was beheaded by them.Appian, The Civil Wars. Culture In the schools of art, philosophy and rhetoric, the foundations of education were transmitted throughout the lands of Greek and Roman rule. Within its educated class, spanning all of the \\"Greco-Roman\\" eras, the testimony of literary borrowings and influences are overwhelming proofs of a mantle of mutual knowledge. For example, several hundred papyrus volumes found in a Roman villa at Herculaneum are in Greek. The lives of Cicero and Julius Caesar are examples of Romans who frequented schools in Greece. The installation, both in Greek and Latin, of Augustus's monumental eulogy, the Res Gestae, exemplifies the official recognition of the dual vehicles for the common culture. The familiarity of figures from Roman legend and history in the \\"Parallel Lives\\" by Plutarch is one example of the extent to which \\"universal history\\" was then synonymous with the accomplishments of famous Latins and Hellenes. Most educated Romans were likely bilingual in Greek and Latin.  Architecture  Greco-Roman architecture in the Roman world followed the principles and style that had been established by ancient Greece. That era's most representative building of was the temple. Other prominent structures that represented that style included government buildings like the Roman Senate and cultural structures like the Colosseum. The three primary styles of column design used in temples in classical Greece were Doric, Ionic and Corinthian. Some examples of Doric architecture are the Parthenon and the Temple of Hephaestus in Athens, and the Erechtheum, next to the Parthenon, is Ionic. Politics The Romans made it possible for individuals from subject peoples to acquire Roman citizenship and would sometimes confer citizenship on whole communities and so \\"Roman\\" became less and less an ethnic and more and more a political designation. By AD 211, with Caracalla's edict known as the Constitutio Antoniniana, all of the empire's free inhabitants became citizens. As a result, even after the Fall of the Western Roman Empire, the people who remained within the empire continued to call themselves Romans even though Greek had become the empire's main language. They continued to call themselves Rhomaioi. (Hellenes had been referring to pagan, or non-Christian, Greeks until the Fourth Crusade.) The ensuing births of successor breakaways and the decisive and irreversible shrinking of Byzantine Greek realms finally led to the predecesdor of Greek nationalism through the Ottoman era and even into modern times.

Professional wrestling career = Early career (1955‚Äì1964) = Walker was trained by Tony Morelli and Pat O'Connor. He debuted in 1955 under the ring name Johnny Walker. After debuting as a wrestler, Walker spent a good portion of his early career (approximately from the late 1950s to the 1960s) as journeyman wrestler Johnny \\"Rubberman\\" Walker, a mainstay of Houston promoter Paul Boesch. Boesch gave him the nickname due to his flexibility. Walker retired in 1964. = The Grappler (1967‚Äì1972) = Walker came out of retirement in 1967. In the early 1970s, Walker wrestled on the independent circuit in Florida under a mask as the Grappler. = Mr. Wrestling II (1972‚Äì1984) = In 1972, Walker was semi- retired and running a gas station in Tennessee. Georgia promoter Paul Jones and his booker Leo Garibaldi asked him to return to wrestling as the masked Mr. Wrestling II. Introduced as the partner of the original Mr. Wrestling (Tim Woods), Walker would take his place in many instances. Eddie Graham, the owner of the NWA Florida promotion, was also a part owner of the Georgia promotion. Graham was sending talent back and forth between the two promotions, due to the promotional war that occurred in Atlanta over a dispute with Ray Gunkel's widow Ann Gunkel and her \\"outlaw promotion\\" All-South Wrestling Alliance. Walker as Mr. Wrestling II became an immediate top draw and legend for the territory, leading to ten reigns as the Georgia Heavyweight Champion. During Walker's time in Georgia as Mr. Wrestling II, he was considered one of the top five most-popular wrestlers in the United States. He also attracted a high- profile fan in Jimmy Carter, at the time the governor of Georgia. While most of his career during the 1970s and 1980s was focused on the southeastern corner of the United States, he also made a prominent appearance in Mid-South Wrestling during 1983 and 1984 as the coach and mentor of a young wrestler named Magnum T.A.. Vignettes aired on television, hosted by either Reisor Bowden or Jim Ross, in which Mr. Wrestling II was shown away from the ring with Magnum discussing his philosophy in taking on a rising young star in the role of a \\"coach\\" or showing training sessions with the two. As a tag team, they also won the promotion's tag team title from Butch Reed and Jim Neidhart on December 25, 1983. Subtle seeds of resentment were planted along the way, which led to the pair splitting and feuding. Mr. Wrestling II turned his back on Magnum in a tag team match against The Midnight Express, which saw Magnum bloodied. On the following week's program, Mr. Wrestling II threw in the towel to cost Magnum the match while he was participating in the tournament for the promotion's television title, claiming that Magnum was too badly cut to continue. Mr. Wrestling II had previously won the North American Championship from the departing Junkyard Dog, which Magnum won from him in Tulsa, Oklahoma on May 13, 1984. = World Wrestling Federation (1984‚Äì1986) = Walker was later signed by Vince McMahon for the World Wrestling Federation in 1984, as part of McMahon's national expansion.

Legacy  Jimmy Carter, the governor of Georgia and later president of the United States during Mr. Wrestling II's 1970s heyday, considered him his favorite wrestler, as well as his mother's favorite. Walker was invited to Carter's inauguration but declined the invitation. The United States Secret Service insisted that Walker appear unmasked for security reasons. Due to his popularity at the time under the mask, he couldn't justify the possible ramifications of his identity being exposed. Mr. Wrestling II did, however, on several occasions enjoy a private audience with Lillian Carter. He faced scrutiny from the Secret Service on these occasions as well, but they went off without incident.  Personal life  Walker had three sons, John Jr., Robert, and Mike, with his wife, Olivia. She was a seamstress and costume maker. Many of her clients were country music performers including Porter Wagoner. During an interview, Ric Flair stated that many of his robes were made by her. Olivia died in October 2000.  Death  On June 10, 2020, Bill Apter reported that Walker had died.

Scope and history While there have always been individual scientists interested in educating the public, science outreach has recently become more organized. For example, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) now requires all of its projects to organize suitable outreach activities. Also working to inform the public are organizations such as Communicating Astronomy to the PublicCommunicating Astronomy to the Public and the Washington Declaration on Communicating Astronomy to the PublicWashington Declaration on Communicating Astronomy to the Public that organize conferences for the public on science issues and make efforts to put outreach on a more general institutional footing. Recently, an increasing number of projects have hired designated outreach scientists (part- time or full-time) that handle public relations for their project. There are also specialized outreach providers such as the Education branch of the Space Science InstituteEducation branch of the Space Science Institute in Boulder, Colorado and the Education and Public Outreach Group at Sonoma State University which offer to organize a project's outreach activities on a contractual basis. In addition to outreach by research institutions, an important part of informal science education are outreach programs such as science museums and science festivals. Examples of science outreach activities Science outreach can take on a variety of forms. =Public talks/lectures/discussions= Universum f√ºr Alle: 70 short popular lectures at Heidelberg University. Lectures are probably the oldest form of science outreach, dating back to the 1820s when Michael Faraday organized the first of the Royal Institution's Christmas Lectures. Public talks can be part of a lecture series, given at a science festival or in cooperation with a special interest group such as a local astronomy club. Public presentations can have a variety of formats, including straightforward lecture formats with or without experimental demonstrations, guided live interviews, and discussions with several participants and a moderator. There are also less formal initiatives such as Caf√© Scientifique, in which a caf√© or bar is the venue for regular meetings involving guest scientists that come to talk about their work or take part in discussions with members of the public. =Visiting primary and secondary schools= School students and teachers are an important target group for science outreach. Outreach activities can include scientists visiting schools, giving talks at assemblies, discussions with students, or participation in events such as career fairs and science and technology camps. One organization that focuses on this kind of science outreach is Robogals. Many universities also have science outreach programs that are dedicated to building relationships between high school students, university scientists, and K-12 teachers. A few of the most prominent university science outreach programs include Carolina Science Outreach, the Vanderbilt Student Volunteers for Science, the Rockefeller University Science Outreach Program, the Present Your Ph.D. Thesis to a 12-Year Old Outreach Project at University of Texas in Austin, the Discover STEM Polymer Day and Energy and U at the University of Minnesota, and the Stanford University Office of Science Outreach. Using Canada as an example, it has been estimated that with sufficient organization, every classroom from kindergarten through graduation could in practice receive a visit from one or more scientists annually with participation from only 10-15% of the scientific enterprise.Bechara J. Saab, \\"Engaging the Clutch of the Science Communication Continuum ‚Äì Shifting Science Outreach into High Gear\\", Hypothesis Volume 8 Issue 1 (September 2010). Some examples of science outreach programs in Canada include: Let's Talk Science, Actua, The Chemical Institute of Canada, and Science Rendezvous. =Workshops/schools for teachers and/or students= ALMA radioastronomy manual. Inviting groups of school students to a research institution for a workshop is another popular form of outreach. Formats range from a one-day visit to more involved week-long events such as Perimeter Institute's International Summer School for Young Physicists, a two-week-long programs for a total of a hundred Canadian and international students from grade 11.International Summer School for Young Physicists Another method of science outreach invites school teachers to participate in workshops where they are able to learn effective strategies to engage students in science. This approach was especially embraced by the Canadian Space Agency which held an annual \\"Space Educators\\" conference up until 2012 to provides teachers with access to resources to educate their students in space-related science. =Supporting science fairs and similar events= One of the major goals of science festivals is to make science more accessible to general public. Cloud chambers are popular at science fairs for their capacity to visualize the otherwise invisible radiation which surrounds us. Besides organizing independent events, many outreach organizations sponsor existing events that promote sciences awareness. A notable examples are science fairs, public science events in which working scientists can participate both as judges and as sponsors of student projects. = Online aggregation of science activities, resources, and programs = The internet is a rich source of science activities, resources, and programs. For example, research laboratories often maintain educational outreach projects aimed at translating their science into something meaningful for the general public, often K-12 students, as an effort to increase research broader impacts required by funding agencies such as the NSF. These may include activities using fast-growing plants that exhibit distinctive mutants with unique phenotypes useful to teach K-12 students about both Mendelian and molecular genetics. Some institutions and organizations maintain large or small aggregations of their activity resources, outreach programs, upcoming events calendars, and partnering programs.

Early life Born in Quba of Baku Governorate in 1896, Baghirov studied pedagogy in Petrovsk. During 1915-1917, M J. Baghirov worked as a school teacher in a village in Khudat. During 1918 - 1921, he participated in the October Revolution and Russian Civil War in ranks of a commander of regiment, military commissar of Azerbaijani division, advisor of the Caucasus corps of the Russian military command, and the head of revolutionary tribunal of Azerbaijani division. After the Soviet takeover of Azerbaijan, Baghirov was appointed the Chairman of the Revolutionary Committee of Karabakh region of Azerbaijan. It was reported that Baghirov worked also for the Azerbaijan Democratic Republic's police. In 1927 through 1929, he served as the director of Department for Water Distribution of Transcaucasia. From February 1921 to May 1927 and December 1929 to August 1930, Baghirov was the head of state security services. First Secretary of Communist Party Party caucus, 1935. Left to right: Makharadze, Baghirov, Beria. In 1932, Baghirov became the People's Commissar of Azerbaijan SSR and from 1933 to 1953 he was the first secretary of the Central Committee of the Azerbaijan Communist Party. In 1953, the bureau of the Central Committee of the Azerbaijani Communist Party appointed Baghirov to head the Council of Ministers of the Azerbaijan SSR. After Stalin's death in March 1953, Baghirov was accused of conducting repression, arrested in 1954, and tried and sentenced to death by the Military Tribunal of the Soviet Union. In his final 17-minute speech before the court, he favored the sentence and refused to apply for any pardon. Baghirov was executed in 1956. Mir Jafar Baghirov is a controversial figure in Azerbaijani history. By 1940 an estimated 70,000 Azeris had died as a result of purges carried out under Baghirov. The intelligentsia was decimated, broken, and eliminated as a social force and the old guard Communist elite was destroyed. However, Baghirov was also successful in resisting the Armenian demands to cede the Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast of the Azerbaijan SSR to the Armenian SSR. He was credited for treating his junior son as an ordinary Soviet citizen. Baghirov sent his son, Vladimir (Jahangir) Baghirov, a military pilot, to the Soviet Army to fight against Nazi Germany. He was killed in battle in June 1943, after performing an aerial ramming.

It is the most populated suburb in the City of Ballarat with a total of 15,000 inhabitants living in the greater Wendouree, Lake Gardens and Miners Rest area. It is named after nearby Lake Wendouree, which derives its name from the Wathaurong word wendaaree, meaning \\"be off\\" (or \\"go away\\"). It incorporates the unofficial locality of Wendouree West. Wendouree has the second major commercial and business hub in Greater Ballarat, and is also the location of several Ballarat-based commercial and industrial firms. Landmarks of Wendouree include the Ballarat Sports and Events Centre, the home of the Ballarat Miners and Ballarat Rush; the Ballarat Showgrounds (Venue for the annual Ballarat Show); Eureka Stadium (Home ground of the North Ballarat (Australian Football) club and Australian Football League venue), the former St Mary's Redemptorist Monastery, Stockland Wendouree Shopping Complex, and the Wendouree Centre for the Performing Arts. History In 1838 a squatter called William Cross Yuille camped on the shores of the Black Swamp, now known as Lake Wendouree, the first Ballarat resident. The Yuille Pastoral Run developed during the mid-1800s. Wendouree Post Office opened on 17 February 1871. Significant urban growth in Wendouree began shortly after the Second World War, encouraged by the development of industrial areas to the west. The Howitt Street shopping centre opened in 1962, and Wendouree Village shopping centre (now Stockland) opened in 1978. The landmark St Mary's Redemptorist Monastery in Gillies Street was converted into apartments beginning in 2000. Commerce and Industry Howitt Street and the former St Mary's Redemptorist Monastery. Harvey Norman is on the left. Wendouree's main commercial area is along the western section of Howitt Street between Forest and Gillies Streets, and along Gillies Street between Howitt and Norman Streets. Located in this area are the Howitt Street Shopping Centre, the Wendouree Homemaker Centre and Stockland Wendouree, as well as fast-food restaurants, car dealerships, community and health-care facilities and a number of small office buildings. Newer industrial and commercial estates have recently commenced development on designated future growth zones to the West that will benefit from access to Ballarat's new western bypass road and planned redevelopment and expansion of the city's airport. Education Wendouree is home to Ballarat Grammar School in Forest Street and the Mount Rowan Secondary College. The suburb also has four primary schools (Wendouree, Forest Street, Our Lady Help of Christians Parish, and Yuille Park Community College). Ballarat Grammar is an independent Kindergarten to Year 12 school affiliated with the Anglican Church of Australia. It was opened by Bishop Green on the current site at the corner of Howitt and Forest Streets in 1911 as a school only for boys. In 1973 the school amalgamated with the Queens Grammar School for girls in Ballarat Central, with the girls making the move to the larger Wendouree campus. Mount Rowan Secondary College (located at the corner of Forest Street and Giot Drive) is located at the northern end of the suburb opened in 1978 as the Wendouree High Technical School. Its name changed to Wendouree Secondary College in 1990. In 1993 the school was amalgamated with Ballarat East Secondary College (originally High School) and Midlands Secondary College (originally Ballarat North Technical School) to form Ballarat Secondary College. The new campus, like that of the others, catered for years 7 to 10. Years 11 and 12 were accommodated at the Barkly Street, Ballarat Central, campus opened in 2000. It replaced the Midlands campus, which was subsequently closed and demolished. In 2017, the college was re-instated as a separate college again catering for years P7-12. Wendouree Primary School (PS 1813) is located on Howitt Street opposite the Howitt Street shopping centre. Forest Street Primary School (PS 4936) is located at the northern end of Forest Street near the secondary college. It opened in February 1966. Our Lady Help of Christians Parish Primary School is located on Gillies Street in the suburb's north-west. It was opened on 15 October 1961, with the foundation staff of Srs. Anne Gardan, Antoinette Russo, Paulinus Setford and Austin Connellan. Wendouree West Primary School (State School No 4701) opened in 1957. The Victorian Government Gazette 815http://gazette.slv.vic.gov.au/images/1956/V/general/815.pdf dated 26 September 1956 records the first Primary School originally being constructed as a six classroom, concrete veneer, timber framed building that cost 21,300 pounds to construct. The builder was the local Ballarat building firm A. V. Jennings Constructions. In 1972 the school was given a State award for having the best maintained school grounds in Victoria, with extensive plantings of flower beds and native trees. In 1975 a library, art room and multi-function hall complex was built at the expense of the removal of many of the best native flower and rose beds. In 1977 the primary school population peaked at 437 children. This number decreased significantly with the establishment of the temporary Yuille Primary School to the north in 1981. Wendouree West Primary was renamed Grevillea Park in the early 1990s. Yuille Park Community College (PS 5520), located on Violet Grove in the west of the suburb, opened in brand new buildings in 2007 as the merger of Yuille Primary School and Grevillea Park Primary School.http://www.thecourier.com.au/news/local/news/general/a-new-beginning- for-school-community/463531.aspx The Yuille Primary School buildings in McKenzie Drive are now used for running alternative education programs for disinterested students.  Healthcare and Community Services  Within Wendouree are a number of significant healthcare facilities. These include the Queen Elizabeth Village, an aged care complex next to Stockland Wendouree, in Gillies Street. It is a publicly owned service and part of the larger Queen Elizabeth Centres of the Ballarat Health Services. In Howitt Street near Wendouree Primary School is the Kelaston aged care centre and the Vision Australia Centre. Another facility, Mulvra Aged Care, is a privately run centre in Dowling Street, opposite the Wendouree Sports Complex. Along both Howitt and Gillies Streets are many medical practices, some offering specialist services, such as podiatry, paediatrics, pathology, and medical imagery.

Brown Reserve), outdoor netball courts and the Ballarat Sports and Events Centre. The latter is the home of Basketball and Netball in Ballarat. Other sports facilities include the Wendouree West Recreation Reserve off Holly Grove, which has two competition grade soccer fields and a BMX track; the large Ring Road reserve; and a number of small reserves within residential areas.  Neighbourhoods  =Wendouree West= The Ballarat West Estate, later renamed as Wendouree West, was first planned in 1949 as a large public housing scheme of the Housing Commission of Victoria, to deal with the post-war housing shortage. Demand was also anticipated with the increasing 'baby boom' and intake of post-war immigrants. The estate originally consisted of 750 prefabricated timber bungalows that were mostly built between 1952 and 1962. Initially many of its residents worked in nearby manufacturing plants producing building laminate, caravans and roller bearings. Wendouree West Post Office opened in February 1955. The post office was relocated to Wendouree Village Shopping Centre (now Stockland) in 1992. Early plans envisaged the estate to be an urban planning model, however development of infrastructure was considerably slower than the construction of housing, with many homes not being connected to sewerage or served by sealed roads until the late 1950s. During the 1950s an aggressive and active community development committee was established, and elements of this committee still remain today, promoting the ongoing development of the neighbourhood. In the mid-1950s a small shopping centre, playgrounds, a kindergarten and other amenities were built. During the 1970s a further 500, more substantial modern brick veneer homes were built to the north of the estate. By the late 1970s the population of the suburb peaked at approximately 5,000. Today, the estate has a resident population representing a mixture of cultures and age groups. The estate is noted as having low socio-economic resources due to higher-than-average unemployment, a high population of aged residents, and inter-generational social welfare dependency.Nothing comes easy in Wendouree west Attempts over the years to change the name of Wendouree West were met with mixed responses from residents throughout Ballarat. In the early 2000s, during a process to make official the boundaries of all cities, towns and suburbs in Victoria, it was determined that Wendouree West would exist only as an unofficial neighbourhood name. The name Wendouree West (or \\"Westie\\") was often used to stigmatise and as a term of derision, often placing its residents at a disadvantage when applying for employment and other positions in the wider Ballarat community. In large part, this historic stigmatisation has contributed to the ongoing disadvantage of its youths. The estate today is now included as part of Wendouree. In recent years attempts have been made to rejuvenate the estate including the removal of many of the early prefabricated cottages and the construction of retirement units and modern private and public housing. Some 300 of the original houses are to be retained and many have already undergone extensive renovation and modernisation, but in such a way that the historical character of the area remains intact. The original Wendouree West State School buildings were demolished in early 2007, with the new replacement school opening as Yuille Park Community College, the product of amalgamation with Yuille Primary School. The renewal program has also seen a lot of civic improvements including street-scaping, an upgrade of the shopping centre, new footpaths and fences, as well as new play equipment, toilets and barbecue facilities in the parks.

He last managed RC Strasbourg. He was the mentor of Ars√®ne Wenger.  Playing career  The striker began his professional football career in the city of his birth with RC Strasbourg, where the fans soon nicknamed him the \\"angel of la Meinau\\" (L'ange de la Meinau; Engel von der Meinau, Meinau is the stadium of the club). Briefly after first playing for Strasbourg (May 1960) the team were relegated to the second division, but returned after one year to Division 1, where Gress played until 1966 and his departure to VfB Stuttgart. Strasbourg were at the time only in mid-table of the division, but won the 1966 Coupe de France. During his time in Germany, he was called up for the first time to the France national football team. During the 1970‚Äì71 season, Gress returned to his homeland and joined Olympique Marseille, then two-time French champions. From 1973 to 1975, he came back to RC Strasbourg, before moving for one year to Neuch√¢tel Xamax in Switzerland and ending his playing career in 1977. Gress completed 290 matches (201 for Strasbourg, 89 for Marseille) in France and scored 28 goals; in the federal league he came on 149 times. = Player honours = ;Strasbourg * Coupe de France: 1965‚Äì66 ;Olympique Marseille * Ligue 1: 1970‚Äì71, 1971‚Äì72 = National player = In 1966, after having won the Coupe de France, Gress was not called up to the 1966 FIFA World Cup in England by national coach Henri Gu√©rin because Gress refused to shorten his long hair. Under the new coach Louis Dugauguez, Gress was first called up on 27 September 1967 (a 1‚Äì5 defeat against Germany in Berlin). Altogether Gress played only three times in the France national football team (1967, 1968 and 1971) and did not score any goals.  Coaching career  Since 1977, Gress has worked as a football manager, and it is hardly surprising that he received his first job in his home town at Racing Strasbourg, where he had won the 1979 French championship, and where he returned again in 1991 for three years. His popularity is expressed also in the establishment of a Gilbert Gress Fanclub. In addition, he worked in Belgium, Austria and in Switzerland, where in 16 years (including twelve with Neuch√¢tel Xamax) he won two national championships and the cup. In 1998, he was appointed Swiss national football coach. A debate preceded his resignation over his wages as a national coach. In the meantime, Gress had also accepted Swiss nationality. In June 2009, he was named RC Strasbourg manager, his third stint as manager of the club. and was released after only two games on 12 August 2009. = Coaching honours = ;Strasbourg * Ligue 1: 1978‚Äì79 ;Neuch√¢tel Xamax * Swiss Super League: 1986‚Äì87, 1988‚Äì88 ;FC Zurich * Swiss Cup: 1999‚Äì2000  References  Category:1941 births Category:Living people Category:France international footballers Category:French football managers Category:French footballers Category:French people of German descent Category:Sportspeople from Strasbourg Category:Neuch√¢tel Xamax FCS players Category:Olympique de Marseille players Category:VfB Stuttgart players Category:Ligue 1 players Category:Bundesliga players Category:RC Strasbourg Alsace players Category:RC Strasbourg Alsace managers Category:Neuch√¢tel Xamax FCS managers Category:Servette FC managers Category:Switzerland national football team managers Category:FC Metz managers Category:SK Sturm Graz managers Category:FC Z√ºrich managers Category:FC Sion managers Category:FC Aarau managers Category:Ligue 1 managers Category:Club Brugge KV head coaches Category:Association football midfielders Category:Association football forwards Category:Footballers from Alsace ","title":"Gilbert Gress"},{"id":"10533316","text":"Boeing 767-300ER(BCF) of ANA & JP Express (2009). , commonly abbreviated AJV, was a cargo airline based in the Shiodome City Center in Minato, Tokyo, Japan.\\"Principal Offices.\\" All Nippon Airways.

The Skewb Ultimate, originally marketed as Pyraminx Ball, is a twelve-sided puzzle derivation of the Skewb, produced by famous toy-maker Uwe Meffert. Most versions of this puzzle are sold with six different colors of stickers attached, with opposite sides of the puzzle having the same color; however, some early versions of the puzzle have a full set of 12 colors. Description The Skewb Ultimate is made in the shape of a dodecahedron, like the Megaminx, but cut differently. Each face is cut into 4 parts, two equal and two unequal. Each cut is a deep cut: it bisects the puzzle. This results in 8 smaller corner pieces and 6 larger \\"edge\\" pieces. The purpose of the puzzle is to scramble the colors, and then restore them to the original configuration. Solutions At first glance, the Skewb Ultimate appears to be much more difficult to solve than the other Skewb puzzles, because of its uneven cuts which cause the pieces to move in a way that may seem irregular or strange. Mathematically speaking, however, the Skewb Ultimate has exactly the same structure as the Skewb Diamond. The solution for the Skewb Diamond can be used to solve this puzzle, by identifying the Diamond's face pieces with the Ultimate's corner pieces, and the Diamond's corner pieces with the Ultimate's edge pieces. The only additional trick here is that the Ultimate's corner pieces (equivalent to the Diamond's face pieces) are sensitive to orientation, and so may require an additional algorithm for orienting them after being correctly placed. Similarly, the Skewb Ultimate is mathematically identical to the Skewb, by identifying corners with corners, and the Skewb's face centers with the Ultimate's edges. The solution of the Skewb can be used directly to solve the Skewb Ultimate. The only addition is that the edge pieces of the Skewb Ultimate are sensitive to orientation, and may require an additional algorithm to orient them after being placed correctly. Number of combinations The Skewb Ultimate has 6 large \\"edge\\" pieces and 8 smaller corner pieces. Only even permutations of the larger pieces are possible, giving 6!/2 possible arrangements. Each of them has two possible orientations, although the orientation of the last piece is determined by the orientations of the other pieces, hence giving us a total of 25 possible orientations. The positions of four of the smaller corner pieces depend on the positions of the other 4 corner pieces, and only even permutations of these positions are possible. Hence the number of arrangements of corner pieces is 4!/2. Each corner piece has 3 possible orientations, although the orientation of the last corner is determined by the orientations of the other corners, so the number of possible corner orientations is 37. However, the orientations of 4 of the corners plus the position of one of the other corners determines the positions of the remaining 3, so the total number of possible combinations of corners is only \\\\frac{4!\\\\times 3^6}{2}. Therefore, the number of possible combinations is: :\\\\frac{6!\\\\times 2^5\\\\times 4!\\\\times 3^6}{4} = 100,776,960. Rhombic dodecahedron version of the puzzle with equivalent mechanism.

The entity was registered as a Virginia Corporation in 1996. Principal customers included Apple Vacations, Go Go Tours, Liberty Travel, and World Technologies. Sky Trek flew charters primarily to the Caribbean, including Nassau, Aruba, Saint Martin, and Antigua. Other destinations included Canc√∫n, Mexico and Laughlin, Nevada. Ad hoc charters provided short notification lift during the NCAA basketball tournament and subservice to other airlines. Sky Trek's refurbished aircraft were leased primarily from Pegasus and maintained according to the Boeing Maintenance Document. Pilots were primarily from Eastern Air Lines via KIWI International Air Lines. Utilization of the aircraft averaged slightly above 200 hours per month per aircraft. According to the DOT/Bureau of Transportation Statistics, Air Carrier Financials: Schedule P-1.1's filed by Sky Trek, the carrier lost nearly $8 million under its first President Robert Iverson II, who had previously been removed as President of Kiwi International Air Lines. Sky Trek never had a positive yearly net income. In August 1999, Sky Trek International's Board of Directors elected Harris Herman President/CEO to replace Iverson who resigned. Herman had previously served as President/COO of the Pan Am Shuttle.The DBA name of the carrier was changed to Discovery Airlines. The Sky Trek' aircraft were removed from service and repainted in the Discovery livery. However, Herman was not able to make the carrier profitable and Sky Trek eventually declared bankruptcy and ceased operations less than 9 months later in May 2000 when it filed for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Act. This reorganization was converted to a Chapter 7 liquidation on June 22, 2000.

Among the delegates to the convention were future U.S. Presidents Thomas Jefferson and George Washington. Publication The speech was not published until The Port Folio printed a version of it in 1816.. The version of the speech that is known today first appeared in print in Sketches of the Life and Character of Patrick Henry, a biography of Henry by William Wirt in 1817. There is debate among historians as to whether and to what extent Henry or Wirt should be credited with authorship of the speech and its famous closing words.. Reception According to Edmund Randolph, the convention sat in silence for several minutes afterward. Thomas Marshall told his son John Marshall, who later became Chief Justice of the United States, that the speech was \\"one of the boldest, vehement, and animated pieces of eloquence that had ever been delivered.\\" Excerpt from Edward Carrington, who was listening outside a window of the church, requested to be buried on that spot. In 1810, he got his wish. The drafter of the Virginia Declaration of Rights, George Mason, said, \\"Every word he says not only engages but commands the attention, and your passions are no longer your own when he addresses them.\\" More immediately, the resolution, declaring the United Colonies to be independent of the Kingdom of Great Britain, was passed, and Henry was named as chairman of the committee assigned to build a militia. Britain's royal governor, Lord Dunmore, reacted by seizing the gunpowder in the public magazine at Williamsburg, Virginia's equivalent of the Battles of Lexington and Concord. Whatever the exact words of Henry were, \\"scholars, understandably, are troubled by the way Wirt brought into print Henry's classic Liberty or Death speech,\\" wrote the historian Bernard Mayo. \\"Yet... its expressions... seemed to have burned themselves into men's memories. Certainly, its spirit is that of the fiery orator who in 1775 so powerfully influenced Virginians and events leading to American independence.\\" Precursors There had been similar phrases used preceding Henry's speech. The 1713 play, Cato, a Tragedy, was popular in the American Colonies and well known by the Founding Fathers, who quoted from the play. George Washington had the play performed for the Continental Army at Valley Forge.. It contains the line, \\"It is not now time to talk of aught/But chains or conquest, liberty or death\\" (Act II, Scene 4). The phrase \\"Liberty or Death\\" also appears on the Culpeper Minutemen flag of 1775. The opera Artemisia (1657) has an aria called Dammi morte o libert√† (\\"Give me death or freedom\\") but the context is different since in the aria, \\"freedom\\" is not meant political freedom. Oronta is asking Amor, the personification of love, to free her from love's bonds or to kill her since love's pains are too hard for her to suffer. That is explained in the first stanza (\\"Give me death or freedom / Oh blind Amor, that so much sufferings, / So much troubles, so much chains / the heart can't bear\\"). In Handel's 1746 oratorio Judas Maccabeus, the hero sings, \\"Resolve, my sons, on liberty or death.\\" \\"Liberty or death\\" in other contexts Phrases equivalent to liberty or death have appeared in a variety of other places: The national anthem of Uruguay, \\"Orientales, la Patria o la Tumba\\", contains the line ¬°Libertad o con gloria morir! (\\"Liberty or with glory to die!\\").History about the Anthem of Uruguay Embassy of Uruguay in Argentina The national anthem of Chile, \\"Canci√≥n Nacional\\", contains the line Que o la tumba ser√°s de los libres / O el asilo contra la opresi√≥n (\\"That you will be either the tomb of the free or an asylum from oppression\\"). The 1320 Declaration of Arbroath made in the context of Scottish independence was a letter to the Pope that contained the line \\"It is in truth not for glory, nor riches, nor honours that we are fighting, but for freedom ‚Äì for that alone, which no honest man gives up but with life itself\\". It is commonly cited as an inspiration for the US Declaration of Independence by many, including the US Senate, and it is possible that Henry knew of the Declaration when he wrote his speech. The motto of Greece is \\"Liberty or Death\\" (Eleftheria i thanatos). It arose during the Greek War of Independence in the 1820s, when it was a war cry for Greeks who rebelled against Ottoman rule. A popular and possibly-concocted story in Brazil relates that in 1822, Emperor Pedro I uttered the famous \\"Cry from [the river] Ipiranga\\", \\"Independence or Death\\" (Independ√™ncia ou Morte), when Brazil was still a colony of Portugal. During the Russian Civil War, the flag used by Nestor Makhno's anarchist Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine had the dual slogans \\"Liberty or Death\\" and \\"The Land to the Peasants, the Factories to the Workers\\".Eikhenbaum, Vsevolod M. (Volin), The Unknown Revolution, 1917-1921: Book III: Struggle for the Real Social Revolution, Part II: Ukraine (1918-1921), Free Life Editions (1974), , In March 1941, the motto of the public demonstrations in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia against the signing of a treaty with Nazi Germany was \\"Better grave than slave\\" (Bolje grob nego rob). During the Indonesian National Revolution, the Pemuda (\\"Youth\\") used the phrase Merdeka atau Mati (\\"Freedom or Death\\"). In 1964, in the speech \\"The Ballot or the Bullet\\" in Cleveland, Ohio, Malcolm X said, \\"It'll be ballots, or it'll be bullets. It'll be liberty, or it will be death. The only difference about this kind of death -- it'll be reciprocal.\\" In 2012, in China, Ren Jianyu, a 25-year-old former college student \\"village official,\\" was given a two-year re-education through labor sentence for an online speech against the Communist Party of China. A T-shirt of Ren saying \\"Give me liberty or give me death!\\" (in Chinese) has been taken as evidence of his antisocial guilt. The phrase appearing as a graffito during the 2019‚Äì20 Hong Kong protests.

The victims were mostly embassy and CIA staff members, but also included several US soldiers and one US Marine Security Guard. It was the deadliest attack on a US diplomatic mission up to that time, and was considered the beginning of Islamist attacks on US targets. The attack came in the wake of an intervention in the Lebanese Civil War by the United States and other Western countries, which sought to restore order and central government authority. Bombing A view of the damage to the U.S. Embassy after the bombing. The car bomb was detonated by a suicide bomber driving a van packed with nearly of explosives at approximately 1:00 p.m. (GMT+2) April 18, 1983. The van, originally sold in Texas, bought used and shipped to the Gulf,Baer, Robert, See No Evil: The True Story of a Ground Soldier in the CIA's War on Terrorism, Crown Publishers, 2002, pp.67‚Äì68 gained access to the embassy compound and parked under the portico at the very front of the building, where it exploded. Former CIA operative Robert Baer's account says that the van broke through an outbuilding, crashed through the lobby door and exploded there.Baer, Robert, See No Evil: The True Story of a Ground Soldier in the CIA's War on Terrorism, Crown Publishers, 2002, p.66 The blast collapsed the entire central facade of the horseshoe-shaped building, leaving the wreckage of balconies and offices in heaped tiers of rubble, and spewing masonry, metal and glass fragments in a wide swath. The explosion was heard throughout West Beirut and broke windows as far as a mile away. Rescue workers worked around the clock, unearthing the dead and wounded. Robert S. Dillon, then Ambassador to Lebanon, recounted the attack in his oral history: > All of a sudden, the window blew in. I was very lucky, because I had my arm > and the T-shirt in front of my face, which protected me from the flying > glass. I ended up flat on my back. I never heard the explosion.

Death toll President Ronald Reagan and First Lady Nancy Reagan pay their respects and tribute to the 13 American civilian and 4 U.S. military personnel victims of the embassy bombing. A total of 63 people were killed in the bombing: 32 Lebanese employees, 17 Americans, and 14 visitors and passers-by. Of the Americans killed, eight worked for the Central Intelligence Agency, including the CIA's top Middle East analyst and Near East director, Robert Ames, Station Chief Kenneth Haas, James Lewis and most of the Beirut staff of the CIA. Others killed included William R. McIntyre, deputy director of the United States Agency for International Development, two of his aides, and four US military personnel. Janet Lee Stevens, an American journalist, human rights advocate, and scholar of Arabic literature, was also among the dead. Lebanese victims included clerical workers at the embassy, visa applicants waiting in line and nearby motorists and pedestrians. An additional 120 or so people were wounded in the bombing. Response =Responses= US President Ronald Reagan on April 18 denounced the \\"vicious terrorist bombing\\" as a \\"cowardly act,\\" saying, \\"This criminal act on a diplomatic establishment will not deter us from our goals of peace in the region.\\" Two envoys, Philip C. Habib and Morris Draper, continued their peace mission in Beirut to discuss Lebanese troop withdrawals with a renewed sense of urgency. The next day, Ambassador Robert Dillon, who had narrowly escaped injury in the bombing, said: \\"Paramount among the essential business is our work for the withdrawal of all foreign forces from Lebanon.\\" It is only by securing Lebanese government control over the country \\"that terrible tragedies like the one we experienced yesterday can be avoided in the future.\\" The President of Lebanon, Amine Gemayel, cabled President Reagan on April 18, saying, \\"The Lebanese people and myself express our deepest condolences to the families of the U.S. victims. The cross of peace is the burden of the courageous.\\" Meanwhile, Lebanon asked the United States, France, and Italy to double the size of the peacekeeping force. As of March 16, it numbered about 4,800 troops, including some 1,200 US Marines, 1,400 Italian soldiers, 2,100 French paratroopers and 100 British soldiers. Iran denied any role in the attack. Foreign Minister, Ali Akbar Velayati said, \\"We deny any involvement and we think this allegation is another propaganda plot against us.\\"Associated Press. \\"Iran Denies Any Involvement In Bombing of U.S. Embassy\\", The New York Times, 1983-05-20. Retrieved on June 13, 2008. On April 19, Prime Minister Menachem Begin of Israel sent President Reagan a message of condolence for the embassy bombing. \\"I write in the name of Israel when I express to you my deep shock at the terrible outrage which took the lives of so many of the American embassy in Beirut yesterday.\\" Defense Minister Moshe Arens, was quoted by Israeli radio that he told the cabinet the attack \\"justified Israel's demands for security arrangements in Lebanon.\\" Minister Yitzhak Shamir of Israel called the embassy bombing \\"shocking\\" but added that, \\"In Lebanon nothing is surprising. I think the lesson is simple and understood. The security problems in Lebanon are still most serious, and terrorist organizations will continue to operate there, at times with great success.\\" =US Congressional response= The House Foreign Affairs Committee April 19 voted to approve $251 million in additional economic and military aid for Lebanon, as requested by the administration. But it attached an amendment to the bill that would force the White House to seek approval for any expanded US military role. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee followed suit April 20, approving the aid request but attaching an amendment that required the president to obtain congressional authorization for \\"any substantial expansion in the number or role of US armed forces in Lebanon or for the creation of a new, expanded or extended multinational peacekeeping force in Lebanon.\\" If Congress did not act jointly on such a request within 60 days, however, the increase would then take effect automatically. The Senate amendment was sponsored as a compromise by the committee's chairman, Republican Charles H. Percy of Illinois. It prevented a move by the committee's ranking Democrat, Claiborne Pell of Rhode Island, to extend the 1973 War Powers Resolution to Lebanon. On April 20, Pell said he would have had the votes to apply the resolution to US Marines in Lebanon. The law limited presidential commitment of troops in hostile situations to a maximum of 90 days unless Congress specifically approved their use. Deputy Secretary of State Kenneth W. Dam, in a letter to the committee, had argued forcefully against use of the War Powers Resolution. Dam said it would \\"amount to a public finding that US forces will be exposed to imminent risk of involvement in hostilities\\", which \\"could give entirely the wrong public impression\\" of US expectations for Lebanon's future. Several influential congressmen had been urging an end to the US military role in Lebanon. After the embassy bombing, April 19, Republican Senator Barry Goldwater of Arizona said, \\"I think it's high time we bring the boys home.\\" Aftermath =Responsibility= A pro-Iranian group calling itself the Islamic Jihad Organization took responsibility for the bombing in a telephone call to a news office immediately after the blast. The anonymous caller said, \\"This is part of the Iranian Revolution's campaign against imperialist targets throughout the world. We shall keep striking at any crusader presence in Lebanon, including the international forces.\\" The group had earlier taken responsibility for a grenade attack in which five U.S. members of the international peacekeeping force had been wounded. Judge John Bates of the US District Court in Washington, D.C. on September 8, 2003, awarded in a default judgment $123 million to 29 American victims and family members of Americans killed in the bombing. Judge Royce Lamberth of the US District Court in Washington, D.C. on May 30, 2003, determined that the bombing was carried out by the militant group Hezbollah with the approval and financing of senior Iranian officials, paving the way for the victims to seek damages. Iran was not present in court to challenge witnesses nor present evidence of their own. =Other effects= Following the attack, the embassy was moved to a supposedly more secure location in East Beirut. However, on September 20, 1984, another car bomb exploded at this embassy annex, killing twenty Lebanese and two American soldiers. The April bombing was one of the first suicide attacks in the region. Other suicide car bombings over the next eight months included one against the US and French embassies in Kuwait, a second attack on Israeli Army's headquarters in Tyre, and the extremely destructive attacks on the US Marine and French Paratrooper barracks in Beirut on October 23, 1983. Along with the Marine Barracks bombing, the 1983 US Embassy bombing prompted the Inman Report, a review of overseas security for the US Department of State. This in turn prompted the creation of the Bureau of Diplomatic Security and the Diplomatic Security Service within the State Department.

One creation is extant as of 2008. The Blakiston Baronetcy, of the manor of Blakiston in the parish of Norton in the Bishopric of Durham, was created in the Baronetage of England on 27 May 1615 for Thomas Blakiston. He had no sons and consequently the title became extinct on his death in 1630.George Edward Cokayne Complete Baronetage Volume 1 1900 The Blakiston baronetcy, of Gibside in the Bishopric of Durham, was created in the Baronetage of England on 30 July 1642 for Sir Ralph Blakiston, son of Sir William Blakiston Kt. (1562‚Äì1641). Ralph was a third cousin of Sir Thomas (mentioned above). His son Sir William, the second Baronet, died childless in 1692 and was succeeded by his younger brother Sir Francis, the third Baronet. The baronetcy became extinct on the latter's death in 1713. The Blakiston Baronetcy, of the City of London, was created in the Baronetage of Great Britain on 22 April 1763 for Matthew Blakiston, Lord Mayor of London from 1760 to 1761. (He was 3rd cousin of Sir Thomas Blakiston of Blakiston and 4th cousin of Sir Ralph Blakiston of Gibside.) The title descended from father to son until the death of his great- grandson, the fourth Baronet, in 1883. He was unmarried and was succeeded by his nephew, Horace, the fifth Baronet. The latter died without issue in 1936 and was succeeded by his younger brother, Charles, the sixth Baronet. He also died childless and was succeeded by his nephew, Arthur, the seventh Baronet. He was also childless and on his death in 1974 the title devolved on his second cousin, Norman, the eighth Baronet. He was the grandson of Charles Robert Blakiston, youngest son of the third Baronet. As of 2008 the title is held by the eighth Baronet's eldest son, Ferguson, the ninth Baronet, who succeeded in 1977. Five other members of the family have also gained distinction. Thomas Blakiston, son of Major John Blakiston, second son of the second Baronet, was an explorer and naturalist. John Blakiston-Houston, son of Richard Blakiston-Houston, younger son of the second Baronet, was a Member of Parliament for Down North. His third son Charles Blakiston-Houston was Member of the House of Commons of Northern Ireland for Belfast Dock from 1929 to 1933 while his fifth and youngest son John Blakiston-Houston (1882‚Äì1959) was a Major-General in the British Army. Reverend Herbert Edward Douglas Blakiston, grandson of Reverend Peyton Blakiston, youngest son of the second Baronet, was President of Trinity College, Oxford, and Vice-Chancellor of Oxford University.

Water heat recycling (also known as drain water heat recovery, waste water heat recovery, greywater heat recovery, or sometimes shower water heat recovery) is the use of a heat exchanger to recover energy and reuse heat from drain water from various activities such as dish-washing, clothes washing and especially showers. The technology is used to reduce primary energy consumption for water heating. How it works Diagram showing how a Waste Water Heat Recovery unit can be installed into a house Heat Recovery schematic system within a Greywater recycling unit. Heat Recovery system incorporated within a Greywater recycling system. The cold water that is put into a water heating device can be preheated using the reclaimed thermal energy from a shower so that the input water does not need as much energy to be heated before being used in a shower, dishwasher, or sink. The water entering a storage tank is usually close to 11 ¬∞C but by recovering the energy in the hot water from a bath or dishwasher, the temperature of the water entering the holding tank can be elevated to 25 ¬∞C, saving energy required to increase the temperature of a given amount of water by 14 ¬∞C. This water is then heated up a little further to 37 ¬∞C before leaving the tank and going to the average shower. When recycling water from a bath (100-150 litres) or shower (50-80 litres) the waste water temperature is circa 20-25 ¬∞C. An in-house greywater recycling tank holds 150-175 litres allowing for the majority of waste water to be stored. Utilizing a built in copper heat exchange with circulation pump the residual heat is recovered and transferred to the cold feed of a combi-boiler or hot-water cylinder, reducing the energy used by the existing central heating system to heat water. Impact and cost Heating water accounts for 18% of the average household utility bill. Standard units save up to 60% of the heat energy that is otherwise lost down the drain when using the shower. Installing a water heat recycler reduces energy consumption and thus greenhouse gas emissions and the overall energy dependency of the household. Typical retail price for a domestic drain water heat recovery unit ranges from around $400 to $1,000 Canadian. For a regular household, water heating is usually the second highest source of energy demand. The energy savings results in an average payback time for the initial investment of 2‚Äì10 years according to Natural Resources Canada, Canadian Center for Housing Technology and US DOE. A 2-year independent study of waste water heat recovery systems installed into residential houses in the UK found savings of 380kWh and 500kWh per person per year., AIMC4 study by Barratt Developments PLC, Stewart Milne Homes, and Crest Nicholson. Industrial scale and HVAC A heat pump can be combined with municipal sewage lines to allow a large building's HVAC system recycle the winter heat or summer cool (compared to the outside air) of water flowing out of many homes and businesses. The reverse is also possible: heat from air conditioning and industrial chillers can be used to pre-heat water. Heat rejected by a chiller system for providing air-conditioning to larger buildings can be recovered by installing a heat-exchanger between the incoming domestic cold water, and condenser water return. A conventional chilled water system rejects heat gathered by the condenser water loop from the refrigerant to a cooling tower. By diverting a fraction of mass flow rate of condenser water away from the cooling tower, and through a heat-exchanger (usually plate heat-exchanger), incoming domestic cold water can be pre-heated before reaching the boiler. This reduces the required increase in temperature of the water before it can be supplied to the end user, and therefore lowering boiler fuel burn.

Directed by James Haupt, the show was produced by Frank and Anne Hummert, better remembered today for creating Ma Perkins and numerous other soap operas. Sponsored by Bayer Aspirin, the show highlighted performances by a variety of vocalists, instrumentalists, and vocal groups. When it began on October 11, 1931 on NBC, the lead vocalists were Frank Munn and Virginia Rea, two of early radio's top stars because of their previous appearances as \\"Paul Oliver\\" and \\"Olive Palmer\\" on The Palmolive Hour (1927‚Äì31). Ring Lardner observed, \\"under any name, they sound as sweet.\\" Lardner outlined his \\"perfect radio program\\" for The New Yorker magazine, and found a place for The Revelers along with Paul Whiteman and Fanny Brice. In the late 1930s, Munn was joined on the program by soprano Jean Dickenson (1937‚Äì51), \\"Nightingale of the Airwaves.\\" Another co-star with Munn during that period was Lucy Monroe, who sang The Star-Spangled Banner at every New York Yankees opening day and every Yankees World Series between 1945 and 1960.Belkin, Lisa. New York Times. \\"Lucy Monroe Dies,\\" October 16, 1987. Other singers featured on the program were Margaret Daum, Elizabeth Lennox, Vivian Della Chiesa, Donald Dame, and the dozen members of the Buckingham Choir. Vocalist Evelyn MacGregor (1899-1967) was also heard on The American Melody Hour. Walter Gustave \\"Gus\\" Haenschen, who led the orchestra, composed the opening theme song, \\"Dream Serenade,\\" with lyrics by Alfred Bryan. The line-up also included violin soloist Bertram Hirsch, the piano duo of Victor Arden and Phil Ohman, and a quartet billed as ‚ÄúThe Henchmen,‚Äù after Haenschen. The show's announcers were Andr√© Baruch, Howard Claney and Roger Krupp. The 30-minute show aired Sunday evenings at 9:00 p.m. until 1933 when it moved to 9:30 p.m. In 1938, the Hummerts did away with the studio audience after concluding that the music sounded better with fewer people in the studio, and fewer breaks due to applause. Musical Director and Conductor Gus Haenschen, who wrote many of the program's arrangements, ensured that the orchestra played softly as the announcer introduced each selection, thereby achieving a musical continuity from the opening to the close of each broadcast. In 1945, when Munn left the show for retirement, he was replaced by Frank Parker. In 1952, Parker was replaced by tenor Earl William, the stage name of Earl Sauvain. Baritone Michael Roberts and pianist Ernest Ulmer were also added to the cast in 1952. After the NBC run ended on November 19, 1950, the series moved a week later (November 26) to ABC where it was still broadcast Sundays at 9:30 p.m., continuing until the June 17, 1951 final network broadcast. From then until June 20, 1954, the orchestra, chorus and soloists toured the United States, and its performances were broadcast on local stations.

Audit sampling exists because of the impractical and costly effects of examining all or 100% of a client's records or books. As a result, a \\"sample\\" of a client's accounts are examined. Due to the negative effects produced by sampling risk, an auditor may have to perform additional procedures which in turn can impact the overall efficiency of the audit. Sampling risk represents the possibility that an auditor's conclusion based on a sample is different from that reached if the entire population were subject to audit procedure. The auditor may conclude that material misstatements exist, when in fact they do not; or material misstatements do not exist but in fact they do exist. Auditors can lower the sampling risk by increasing the sampling size. Although there are many types of risks associated with the audit process, each type primarily has an effect on the overall audit engagement. The effects produced by sampling risk generally can increase audit risk, the risk that an entity's financial statements will contain a material misstatement, though given an unqualified ('clean') audit report. Sampling risk can also increase detection risk which suggests the possibility that an auditor will not find material misstatements relating to the financial statements through substantive tests and analysis. Types of sampling risk =Typical scenarios= Auditors must often make professional judgments in assessing sampling risk. When testing samples the auditor is primarily concerned with two aspects of sampling risk: Risk of accepting incorrect data: the sample supports the conclusion that the recorded account balance is not materially misstated when it is materially misstated. Risk of incorrect rejection: the risk that the sample supports the conclusion that the recorded amount balance is materially misstated when it is not materially misstated. In addition, the auditor is concerned with sampling risk and its relationship with controls. Two types of sample risk/control risks are: Assessing too low: the risk that the assessed level of control risk based on the sample is less than the true operating effectiveness of the control. Assessing too high: the risk that the assessed level of control risk based on the sample is greater than the true operating effectiveness of the control. Sample selection When selecting a sampling approach there are two approaches to audit sampling: non-statistical and statistical approach. Three ways that statistical sampling can assist the auditor are: to maximize the productivity with minimum wasted effort in designing the sample, to measure the sufficiency of the evidence taken during the audit, and to analyze the results. The statistical approach allows the auditor to measure the risk that is being sampled to help in reducing it to an acceptable level. With respect to performing samples, statistical sampling involves different kinds of costs such as training the auditors, designing individual samples to meet the requirements, and choosing the items to be examined. If there is insufficient audit evidence it is the responsibility of the auditor to choose between non statistical or the statistical sampling approaches considering their effectiveness and related costs. Although exercising careful judgment is crucial during every step of the sampling process, it is extremely necessary when choosing the non-statistical approach. This method does not include the use of tables or statistical percentages, but rather it relies upon professional judgment on the part of the auditor as well as the policy implemented by the firm. Under this approach, it is common practice for most accounting firms to create universal guidelines for auditors in order to determine a proper sample size. For example, if a given client's control risk is high, a firm would typically require a high sample size when selecting records. In order to successfully gather a sample, it is important to consider the collection as a whole and the relevance of the particular items. The most common successful method is to select an even number of items which accurately represents the list as a whole. Selecting only large or small numbers could distort the sample which creates risk.

Early years and education Kossoff was born in Islington, London, and spent most of his early life living there with his Russian Jewish parents. In 1938, he attended the Hackney Downs School in London. In 1939, he was evacuated with the school to King's Lynn, Norfolk, where he lived with Mr and Mrs R.C. Bishop, who encouraged his interest in art. During this time, Kossoff made his first paintings. When he returned to London in 1943, Kossoff went to Saint Martin's School of Art, and studied commercial art. He also attended life drawing classes in the evenings at Toynbee Hall. He spent three years in military service with the Royal Fusiliers, attached to the 2nd Battalion Jewish Brigade, and served in Italy, Holland, Belgium and Germany. After his military service, he returned to the Saint Martin's School of Art in 1949, and at Borough Polytechnic, took special classes under David Bomberg from 1950 to 1952. He was also influenced by another one of his teacher's students, Frank Auerbach. Both young artists dealt with similar emotions and subject matter in their work, and employed heavy impasto in their paintings. Kossoff chose his subject matter mostly from the area of London where he was born. From 1950 to 1953, Kossoff's studio was located at Mornington Crescent; he then moved to Bethnal Green, where he lived until 1961. Kossoff studied at the Royal College of Art from 1953 to 1956. Career In 1956, Kossoff joined Helen Lessore's Beaux Arts Gallery, located on Bruton Place in London. In 1959, Kossoff began to teach at the Regent Street Polytechnic, the Chelsea School of Art, and the Saint Martin's School of Art, all in London. While teaching, he continued his artistic career, and soon started featuring in galleries and shows, along with his friend Frank Auerbach and other artists such as Francis Bacon, Lucian Freud and Keith Critchlow, a school friend from Saint Martin's. During this time, Kossoff moved his studio to Willesden Junction, and in 1966, moved his studio to Willesden Green. In 1995, Kossoff exhibited his artworks at the 46th Venice Biennale and in 1996 was the subject of a Tate Gallery retrospective. In 2007, London's National Gallery held an exhibition of Kossoff's work entitled \\"Leon Kossoff: Drawing from Painting\\".Leon Kossoff: Drawing from Painting, Studio International, UK. Kossoff declined appointment as a Commander of the Order of the British Empire. In 2010, Kossoff exhibited a travelling show of new paintings and drawings, beginning at Annely Juda Fine Art, London, then travelling to Mitchell-Innes & Nash, New York, and ending at L.A. Louver, Los Angeles. In 2013-14, Kossoff's urban landscapes were shown in a travelling international exhibition, titled \\"Leon Kossoff: London Landscapes\\". Kossoff died at the age of 92 on 4 July 2019 from complications of a stroke.

The theorem  Let H be a Hilbert space and L(H) the set of bounded operators on H. The following is the classical definition of a Fredholm operator: an operator T ‚àà L(H) is said to be a Fredholm operator if the kernel Ker(T) is finite- dimensional, Ker(T*) is finite-dimensional (where T* denotes the adjoint of T), and the range Ran(T) is closed. Atkinson's theorem states: :A T ‚àà L(H) is a Fredholm operator if and only if T is invertible modulo compact perturbation, i.e. TS = I + C1 and ST = I + C2 for some bounded operator S and compact operators C1 and C2. In other words, an operator T ‚àà L(H) is Fredholm, in the classical sense, if and only if its projection in the Calkin algebra is invertible. = Sketch of proof = The outline of a proof is as follows. For the ‚áí implication, express H as the orthogonal direct sum : H = \\\\operatorname{Ker}(T)^\\\\perp \\\\oplus \\\\operatorname{Ker} (T). The restriction T : Ker(T)‚ä• ‚Üí Ran(T) is a bijection, and therefore invertible by the open mapping theorem. Extend this inverse by 0 on Ran(T)‚ä• = Ker(T*) to an operator S defined on all of H. Then I ‚àí TS is the finite-rank projection onto Ker(T*), and I ‚àí ST is the projection onto Ker(T). This proves the only if part of the theorem. For the converse, suppose now that ST = I + C2 for some compact operator C2. If x ‚àà Ker(T), then STx = x + C2x = 0. So Ker(T) is contained in an eigenspace of C2, which is finite-dimensional (see spectral theory of compact operators). Therefore Ker(T) is also finite-dimensional. The same argument shows that Ker(T*) is also finite-dimensional. To prove that Ran(T) is closed, we make use of the approximation property: let F be a finite-rank operator such that F ‚àí C2 < r. Then for every x in Ker(F), :S*Tx ‚â• STx = x + C2x = x + Fx +C2x ‚àí Fx ‚â• x ‚àí C2 ‚àí F*x ‚â• (1 ‚àí r)x. Thus T is bounded below on Ker(F), which implies that T(Ker(F)) is closed. On the other hand, T(Ker(F)‚ä•) is finite-dimensional, since Ker(F)‚ä• = Ran(F*) is finite-dimensional. Therefore Ran(T) = T(Ker(F)) + T(Ker(F)‚ä•) is closed, and this proves the theorem. A more complete treatment of Atkinson's Theorem is in the reference by Arveson: it shows that if B is a Banach space, an operator is Fredholm iff it is invertible modulo a finite rank operator (and that the latter is equivalent to being invertible modulo a compact operator, which is significant in view of Enflo's example of a separable, reflexive Banach space with compact operators that are not norm-limits of finite rank operators). For Banach spaces, a Fredholm operator is one with finite dimensional kernel and range of finite codimension (equivalent to the kernel of its adjoint being finite dimensional). Note that the hypothesis that Ran(T) is closed is redundant since a space of finite codimension that is also the range of a bounded operator is always closed (see Arveson reference below); this is a consequence of the open-mapping theorem (and is not true if the space is not the range of a bounded operator, for example the kernel of a discontinuous linear functional).

Life before Knutby Helge Fossmo originated from the village of Bj√∂rneborg, close to Kristinehamn in V√§rmland County. His parents were Norwegian. The family was not particularly religious, but when he was about ten years old Helge joined the scouting organization of the Mission Covenant Church in Bj√∂rneborg. Not long before he turned twelve he became a \\"born again\\" Christian.Sj√∂berg, 62. He went to highschool in Kristinehamn. He volunteered in a Christian youth caf√©. At age 17 he met Hel√©ne Johansson, his future wife.Nordling, 60. In 1989 he joined the Pentecostal church of Kristinehamn, where Hel√©ne also was a member. After graduation, he studied in Karlstad to become a science teacher, but he dropped out. For a while he worked as a teacher in his old school in Bj√∂rneborg.Sj√∂berg, 63. In the spring of 1993, Helge Fossmo was involved with Jaspis. In Kristinehamn this was a small group inspired by Ulf Ekman's Livets Ord, part of the Word of Faith movement. After a few months, however, he left Jaspis and rejoined the pentecostal church. He was then employed as a youth pastor. In May 1995, he organized a march for Jesus. The Christian newspaper Dagen published Fossmo's experience of xenoglossy. Fossmo met √Ösa Waldau for the first time in August 1993. The main pastor Claes Frankner had invited her to Kristinehamn from Knutby. His son Samuel was already an adherent of Waldau's and moved to Knutby in 1994. The Fossmos moved there in August 1997 with their two children (a third child was born in Knutby). Work in Knutby In Knutby, Fossmo and Waldau started in 1997 a month-long training school, which has been held three times a year since then. It attracted young Christians from all over Sweden, some of whom would move to Knutby permanently. Fossmo also started the missionary foundation Aid for Nations. At first it tried to be active in Estonia. Later this foundation organized bible schools in Coimbatore (India) and in Hongkong. Fossmo's web page with Christian links is dominated by Word of Faith (Livets Ord, Morris Cerullo, Kenneth Hagin, Benny Hinn, John Avanzini, Kenneth Copeland), but also includes Pentecostalism (IBRA Radio, Kensington Temple, Oral Roberts) and others (Willow Creek Community Church, Ray Stedman). The web page also shows strong support for the State of Israel. Later, Fossmo was photographed with the Israeli ambassador, Zvi Mazel and the ambassador also invited Fossmo to the embassy as he was seen as a positive voice for Israel. The Fossmos moved to a house next to √Ösa Waldau, and Helge was spending most of his time with her. Reading the Bible, they found that the metaphorical interpretatation of Bride of Christ as the Church is not explicit in the New Testament texts. Fossmo told Waldau that if the Bride were a person, it would have to be her. Waldau then bought a gold ring with seven diamonds. On 29 March 1999, he was the only other person present at the ceremony where √Ösa Waldau was betrothed to Jesus. She became the Bride of Christ, and also assumed a new name: Tirsa. Fossmo said in court that he had to mediate Jesus to her, by satisfying her sexually with his hands, which Waldau denied. Murders, marriages and trials On 18 December 1999, Fossmo found his wife Hel√©ne dead in the bathtub. Although there was a hole in her skull and although there was a toxic concentration of dextropropoxyphene in her blood, her death was ruled an accident. Within a few months, Helge Fossmo had a new wife, Alexandra, Tirsa's youngest sister. In June 2001, Fossmo fell ill in an undiagnosed disease. He was nursed by Sara Svensson, who moved into his bedroom. She divorced her husband a year later, but √Ösa Waldau did not approve of Fossmo's liaison with her. She was put under church discipline and shunned ‚Äì in Fossmo's bedroom, where she said she was a sex slave. Pastor Fossmo then coveted his neighbour's wife, Anette Linde. They started an affair in the autumn of 2003. Soon thereafter, Sara Svensson started getting anonymous text messages, which she regarded as prophetic. Together with Fossmo's verbal instructions, these messages convinced her to try to kill Alexandra Fossmo. In the early morning of 8 November 2003, she attacked Alexandra with a hammer. Alexandra woke up and resisted the attack. She called her husband who was out in his car (with his lover, Mss. Linde), as well as some church elders. Sara Svensson was sent away from the community. The assault was not reported to the police, and the Fossmos took a plane to a Bible school in Hong Kong. Secretly, Fossmo and Svensson kept in touch. The anonymous text messages also resumed. Svensson was instructed to buy a handgun (not an easy task in Sweden). She was told to shoot Daniel Linde too. The shootings took place in the early morning of 10 January 2004. Alexandra was shot dead in the head in her bed. Daniel Linde was shot in the chest and in his mouth, but he managed to call emergency services and he survived. The district court sentenced Fossmo to life imprisonment for solicitation of murder of Alexandra and attempted murder of Daniel Linde, but acquitted him of the murder of Hel√©ne. Fossmo appealed the convictions and the prosecutor appealed the acquittal, but the verdict was upheld. Fossmo's appeal to the Supreme Court was denied. He wrote without success to the Chancellor of Justice. He then appealed to the European Court of Human Rights, but on 13 February 2007, the judges decided not to hear his case. Admission of guilt At the end of August 2006, Fossmo admitted guilt in an interview with TV4 and said that he would put his cards on the table for the police. Fossmo also had a new lawyer, Peter Althin. In March 2007, after three interviews, the police decided not to reopen the case. On 20 July 2007, Helge Fossmo got married in prison. In October 2009, he published an article where he said he was ashamed of what he had done in the cult. In October 2014, Fossmo got his sentenced time determined by a court after applying for it after serving 10 years of his life sentence, which meant he would have been released in 2020 on parole. In January 2015, the G√∂ta Court of Appeal repealed the decision, on the penalty requirement of at least 24 years of imprisonment for the severity of the crime, so that the application for parole was premature.

Christians in Laos number 150,000, divided approximately equally between Protestant and Catholics.Laos: Evolution of the religious situation, Religioscope, 14 February 2003 There are three major Churches in Laos: the Lao Evangelical Church, the Seventh-day Adventist Church and the Roman Catholic Church. The Laotian government has enacted legislation aimed against Christians, and heavily monitors all Christian activities. Protestantism Approximately 400 Protestant congregations conduct services throughout the country for a community that has grown rapidly in the past decade. Church officials estimate Protestants to number as many as 150,000. Protestant Church, Haiphong Road, Vientiane. Protestant Church, Luang Prabang Road, Vientiane. Many Protestants are members of ethnic Mon-Khmer groups, especially the Khmu in the north and the Brou in the central provinces. Numbers of Protestants have also expanded rapidly in the Hmong and Yao communities. In urban areas, Protestantism has many lowland Lao followers. Most Protestants are concentrated in Vientiane Municipality, in the provinces of Vientiane, Sayaboury, Luang Prabang, Xieng Khouang, Bolikhamsai, Savannakhet, Champassak, and Attapeu, as well as in the former Saisomboun Special Zone, but smaller congregations are located throughout the country. The LFNC officially recognizes only two Protestant groups ‚Äì the LEC and the Seventh-day Adventist Church ‚Äì and requires all non-Catholic Christian groups to operate under one of these organizations. Seventh-day Adventists number slightly more than 1,000 country-wide, with congregations in Vientiane Municipality as well as Bokeo, Bolikhamsai, Champassak, Luang Prabang, and Xieng Khouang provinces. Christian denominations that have some following in the country, but which are not recognized by the government, include the Methodists, Church of Christ, Assemblies of God, Lutherans, Baptists, Jehovah‚Äôs Witnesses and The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Official membership numbers are not available. All approved Christian religious groups own properties in Vientiane Municipality, although some of their properties are not officially recognized by the Government. In addition, the Protestant LEC maintains properties in the cities of Savannakhet and Pakse. Three informal churches, one for English-speakers, one for Korean- speakers, and one for Chinese-speakers, serve Vientiane's foreign Protestant community. In 2005, a Protestant church in Savannakhet Province was closed down by the government. Among the Hmong of Laos 20% were Christians in 1998. With around 300 congregations, Protestantism has grown rapidly in the last decade. Members of the Seventh-day Adventist Church in Laos are mainly Chinese and Meos. At the end of June 30, 2019 it had four churches and 1,419 members.Adventist Directory Retrieved March 29, 2019 =Religious freedom= According to the US government and other agencies there have been instances of the Laotian government attempting to make Christians renounce their faith, and have several times closed down Christian churches. They also say that there are two religious prisoners in Laos, both members of the Lao Evangelical Church, and that in 2005, a church in Savannakhet Province was closed down by the government. Lao officials have denied that they have closed any churches and say that Christians are imprisoned for other reasons. In 2010 Amnesty International called for the government to allow freedom of speech. Catholicism Sacred Heart Catholic Church (pro-cathedral, built 1928), Vientiane. Catholic Training Center in Thakhek. The Roman Catholic Church is officially recognized by the LFNC.United States Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor. Laos: International Religious Freedom Report 2007. This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the public domain. Roman Catholicism first entered Laos when Laos was a French colony. There are approximately 45,000 Catholics, many of whom are ethnic Vietnamese, concentrated in major urban centers and surrounding areas along the Mekong River in the central and southern regions of the country. The Catholic Church has an established presence in five of the most populous central and southern provinces, and Catholics are able to worship openly. The Catholic Church's activities are more circumscribed in the north. There are four bishops, two located in Vientiane and others located in the cities of Thakhek and Pakse. One of the two bishops resident in Vientiane oversees the Vientiane Diocese and is responsible for the central part of the country. The second bishop resident in Vientiane is the Bishop of Luang Prabang. He is assigned to the northern part of the country, but while the Government did not permit him to take up his post, it did permit him to travel to visit church congregations in the north. The church's property in Luang Prabang was seized after 1975, and there is no longer a parsonage in that city. An informal Catholic training center in Thakhek prepared a small number of priests to serve the Catholic community. Several foreign nuns temporarily serve in the Vientiane diocese. There are no dioceses in the country, but it is divided into four Apostolic Vicariates: the Vicariate Apostolic of Luang Prabang, the Vicariate Apostolic of Paks√©, the Vicariate Apostolic of Savannakhet, and the Vicariate Apostolic of Vientiane.

Both its men's and women's teams are annual contenders for the Dutch titles. The men's team won its maiden European Cup in 2005. Originally, the club was also playing bandy, as is still reflected in the club's name. History The club was founded in 1892 and is seen as the oldest hockey club of the Netherlands and the European mainland. In the early years bandy was the most important sport, when there was no ice in the summer they would play field hockey. Because of the 1928 Summer Olympics the regard towards hockey changed, the Netherlands national hockey team won the silver medal at the field hockey tournament. From this moment onwards field hockey became the most important sport for the club.

Tzilacatzin was a Tlatelolca warrior. A member of the Otomi or Otontin warrior class, he became famous as a hero during the Siege of Tenochtitlan. In an account that described the Spaniards' entry into Tlatelolco, Tzilacatzin was identified as one of the three brave warriors who led the Tlatelolca side, along with Tzoyectzin and Temoctzin. Bernardino de Sahag√∫n's Tlatelolca informants describe that during the siege Spanish brigantines led by Pedro de Alvarado landed on the island where Tlatelolco was situated. Initially the warriors did not dare attack them but Tzilacatzin who was strong of arm killed several Spaniards by throwing stones at them. The Spaniards focused their fire on Tzilacatzin but he cleverly evaded it and proceeded to disguise as a common soldier in order to not attract attention.Lockhart 1993 p. 202 He was also said to have used different implements to change his appearance such as a hairpiece made of eagle feathers and accessories (e.g. golden earplug, shell necklace, lip pendant). At other times he fought without armor or head protection in order to intimidate the Spaniards with his valor. Later when brigantines landed in the district called Xocotitlan, they were forced to return to the boats and flee by Tzilacatzin and his men.Lockhart 1993 p. 211 He is also described as one of only three warriors not being fearful when confronted by the Spanish invaders.

Earliest Processions The Valletta Easter procession is organised by the only Confraternity of the Risen Christ to exist in the Maltese Islands. This confraternity traces its origin to April 1, 1659, when a sodality was instituted in the Greek (Catholic) church of Valletta through a Papal Bull issued by Pope Alexander VII (the former Fabio Chigi, Inquisitor of Malta, 1634‚Äì1639). On June 5, 1892, its members were authorised to wear a white habit, a red girdle and a medallion of the Risen Christ, thus becoming a confraternity. On March 7, 1934, Archbishop Maurus Caruana permitted the transfer of this confraternity from the Greek Church to the Church of the Jesuits, also in Valletta, where it still has its seat today. It is traditionally held that the Valletta wooden statue of the Risen Christ (L-Irxoxt) is in the Melchiorre Caf√† genre which, if correct, would date it to the second half of the 17th century.

It was the most famous of several spa baths opened in Leamington between the late-18th and mid-19th centuries. People would travel from throughout the country, and indeed Europe, to benefit from treatments using the town's healing waters. When 'taking the waters' became less fashionable after the mid-19th century the Pump Rooms became Leamington's only surviving spa facility, later also being extended to include the town's public swimming pool. After a major redevelopment in 1997-99 the building now houses Leamington Spa Art Gallery & Museum, a public library, a Tourist Information Centre, cafe and assembly rooms. It is a Grade II listed building. History =Background and beginnings= By the time that a spring had been found at the site of the rooms in 1811 Leamington already had a reputation as an up- and-coming spa resort. Six wells had been discovered south of the River Leam in and around the village. The influx of tourists to bathe in these springs and 'take the waters' had led to speculators developing land to the north of the river. It was decided by these men that they needed to find a spring on their side of the river so that they could erect a suitably grand building to match the town they aimed to develop. Another spring was found in 1811 on the land of Mr Bertie Greatheed and the architectural work was undertaken by local man Charles S. Smith (who also designed The Regent Hotel and the Upper Assembly Rooms in the town) in the Classical style. The building named The New Pump Rooms and Baths was opened three years later in July 1814. Within months of opening however the baths proved so popular that the building needed to be extended. The building was finally complete two years later in 1816. Including the wings at the north and south end the building was 166 feet long with 17 hot baths and 3 cold baths. The total development cost was a fraction under ¬£18,000. One of the most interesting, although not at the time most famous or notable, parts of the development were the pumps which were manufactured by the engineering giants Boulton and Watt of Smethwick, Birmingham. It also included the world's first gravity fed piped hot water system in modern times, which was designed and installed in 1815 by the engineer William Murdoch. =Hard times= From the 1840s onwards the British spa town tourist industry began to wane thanks to the growing popularity of spas in continental Europe, notably Belgium and France. Faced with the decline in demand for spa health treatments the decision was made in 1860 to close the Pump Rooms with a view to demolishing them and selling the land. However a group of local investors clubbed together and bought the building in October 1861. After spending ¬£17,000 refurbishing the building, including adding a Turkish Bath and swimming pool, the Pump Rooms re-opened in 1863. However, it proved impossible to operate at a profit and it was sold to the Local Board of Health in 1868. Since that time the building has remained in the public sector and in 1875 the Royal Pump Room Gardens next to the building were opened to the public under the management of George Elson. In 1889 a further large public swimming pool was opened. An annexe was added to the south of the main assembly room in 1910 and another to the north some years later. Around 1950 the tower added in the 1860s was demolished. In 1989 the swimming pool was closed and relocated to a new leisure centre building in Newbold Comyn. =Redevelopment= After a number of different schemes to redevelop the Royal Pump Rooms had been considered, in 1997 work began on a major project to reuse it as a cultural complex. This opened after two years of redevelopment led by Warwick District Council in partnership with Warwickshire County Council, South Warwickshire Tourism Ltd and a catering company. The Leamington public library and public art gallery were relocated here from their former \\"Old Library\\" and annexe site on Avenue Road. The main swimming hall was used to house the library, the smaller swimming hall and Turkish Baths converted to house Leamington Spa Art Gallery & Museum. Popular culture During the dormant 1990s period the video for the Mick Jagger song \\"Sweet Thing\\" was filmed in the baths.

It was created from the 19th Infantry Division. The division fought exclusively on the Eastern Front, except for a brief period of refitting in the Netherlands in mid-1944. It took part in the battles of Moscow and Kursk as well as in the crushing of the Polish uprising at Warsaw. It eventually surrendered to Soviet forces in Czechoslovakia in May 1945. History The division was formed in November 1940 from the 19th Infantry Division, gaining the 27th Tank Regiment and in turn giving up the 59th Infantry Regiment to the new 20th Panzer Division. The new division was part of Operation Barbarossa which began in June 1941, suffering such heavy casualties in the first two months that one of its three tank battalions had to be disbanded by August. Among other operations, it fought around Velikiye Luki against the Soviet 29th Territorial Rifle Corps. The division took part in the advance in the central sector of the Eastern Front and participated in the Battle of Moscow.Mitcham, p. 149 Further losses during the defensive operations in the winter of 1941‚Äì42 forced the division to disbanded another tank battalion, reducing it to just one. The 19th Panzer Division remained in the central sector until late 1942, when it was sent south to support the Italian 8th Army. The division took part in defensive battles after the collapse of the German southern front following the encirclement of the 6th Army at Stalingrad. It participated in the unsuccessful German offensive during the Battle of Kursk, suffering heavy casualties while operating in the area of Belgorod. In October 1943 it was reinforced with an additional tank battalion.Mitcham, p. 150 The division was part of the German defensive operations and retreat through the Ukraine in late 1943 and early 1944. It was part of the successful escape of the 1st Panzer Army from the Kamenets- Podolsky pocket in April 1944. The 19th Panzer Division, almost destroyed in the previous defensive battles, was sent to the Netherlands in May 1944 to be refitted.Stoves, p. 130‚Äì133 In the aftermath of Operation Bagration, the Soviet offensive that destroyed the center of the German Eastern Front, the division was sent by rail from the Netherlands back to the Eastern Front. It took part in the defence of Warsaw and the crushing of the Polish uprising. After the Soviet Vistula‚ÄìOder Offensive in January 1945, the division was pushed south-west by the Soviet advance, first towards Breslau and then into Czechoslovakia.

Outside of special cases, the surface of a molten metal is covered with a thin, solid layer of oxide. If the surface of the liquid happens to fold in on itself, or if a separate droplet falls into it, there will be a solid-on-solid interface between the two films. This can happen as a consequence of any kind of turbulence during the processing of the molten metal. Once solidified, this interface become functionally indistinguishable from a crack. The presence of such crack-like entrainment in solid metal articles constitutes a metalworking defect. The continuous casting process used in the initial forming of most wrought alloys is also susceptible to entrainment. Any entrainment defects thus formed are inherited by the wrought products. When the entrainment is initially formed, it contains some amount of trapped air. This pocket of air, however, will be chemically consumed over time. The oxygen in this pocket of air will be used up by further thickening of the oxide layer. The nitrogen may then be converted into nitrides, although this process depends on which metal it happens in. When liquid metal is subjected to high pressure, as during die casting, liquid metal may be forced through the oxide film. This phenomenon is able to partially bond the two facing oxide surfaces, thus reducing the severity of the defect. See also *Non-metallic inclusions References * Castings by J.

He played five games for the Boston Red Sox in 1931. Nicknamed \\"Whoops\\", he batted left-handed but threw right-handed and was listed at and . Signed by the Red Sox without having previously played any minor league baseball, Creeden made his debut on April 14, 1931. In eight at bats, he failed to amass a single hit and committed two errors. He played his final game on April 21, exactly a week after his debut. He never played professional baseball again and died on April 20, 1992 in Brockton, Massachusetts. Early life Creeden was born on May 23, 1906 in Newburyport, Massachusetts. His father, Jeremiah Creeden, was a master plumber; his mother was Margaret (n√©e Leary). While his maternal and paternal grandfathers were from Massachusetts, his grandmothers were both immigrants from Ireland. He had an older sister‚Äîwho worked in the family's plumbing business as a bookkeeper‚Äîand a younger brother. Although his family originally resided in West Newbury, they moved to Brockton when Creeden started attending school. He graduated from Brockton High School in 1926. He proceeded to attend college at Boston College, where he played both football and baseball for the Boston College Eagles. Creeden played the position of left halfback and was viewed as the \\"freshman star\\" of the team during his first year. He was eventually appointed captain in 1930, the year he graduated from college. During his tenure with the team, he earned the nickname \\"Brockton flash\\". In baseball, he played as second baseman for the Eagles until his senior year. After graduating in 1930, Creeden coached the Fordham College freshman football team. In 1924, while still a student at Brockton High, Creeden began playing summer baseball for Hyannis in the Cape Cod Baseball League. He returned to the league in 1925 to play for Chatham, then he was back to Hyannis in 1926, where he played each summer through 1930. After playing briefly for the Red Sox in 1931, he returned to play for the Cape League's Barnstable team for the remainder of that season. He was a member of Hyannis' 1926 and 1927 league championship clubs, and was reportedly a \\"very smart ball player, especially fast on his feet and one of the league's leading base stealers.\\" Professional career In the winter of 1930, the Boston Red Sox signed Creeden and announced the move on December 20, even though he had no prior experience in minor league baseball. In spring training of , Creeden's promising performance led the Associated Press to suggest that he could replace Bobby Reeves as the team's starting second baseman. Although Reeves started the Red Sox's Opening Day game against the New York Yankees (leaving Creeden consigned to the bench), he was still able to make his major league debut in the same game when he entered as a pinch-hitter for shortstop Rabbit Warstler in the eighth inning and struck out in his first at bat. After pinch-hitting for two more games against the Yankees, Creeden was finally given a chance to make his fielding debut on April 20 against the Washington Senators. Although he drew a walk, he remained hitless with two more at bats, committed a throwing error and was eventually replaced by Reeves, prompting the Boston Herald to criticize Creeden's lackluster performance. The following day, he again started the game and executed what the Washington Post described as a \\"snappy double play,\\" but went 0 for 3 at the plate and made an error which loaded the bases. It was the last major league game he played and he ended his career hitless with an 0 for 8 batting average, 1 walk and 3 strikeouts. Personal life After his Major League career ended, Creeden went on to enlist in the US Navy during World War II. From September 1942 to March 1946, he served as physical education class instructor and occasionally fought in the front line as well.

She became interested in Etruscan studies while stationed in Rome as the Minister- Counsellor of the Turkish Embassy, did research on the subject during her stay in Italy and wrote down her findings in a number of books, in Turkish and in French. What is spectacular about her texts on Etruscans and renders them of interest is that she posits the Etruscans as Turkic, a proposition that is as controversial today as it was during her lifetime. Ayda was also known in Turkey as an outspoken parliamentarian during her stint as a member of the Turkish Senate, which she had joined on appointment, as one of the small number of appointed senators, called \\"kontenjan senat√∂r√º\\" in Turkish, after her retirement from the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Ayda had an eventful professional life. She left the Ministry of Foreign Affairs soon after she joined it, and taught French literature first at the Ankara then Istanbul universities, penned a number of studies as an academic, in Turkish and in French, before returning once again to the Ministry.  Biography  Ayda's personal life was not less eventful. She was born Gadile Sadreyevna Maksudova (, ) in Saint Petersburg while her father the Tatar Sadri Maksudi was a member of the Duma, serving as a representative of the Ittifaq al- Muslimin party, close Kadets. In 1917, her father became the leader of the first state formation in the Idel-Ural since the territory of the Kazan Khanate was occupied by the Russians in 1552. She left Russia during the famine of the 1920s as a small child, when her mother Kamile, the daughter of the gold-mining Ramiev family of Orenburg, took her and her younger sister Naile along to cross the Russo-Finnish border clandestinely. They reunited in Finland with Sadri Maksudov, who himself had left the country dressed as a mujik, after the Bolsheviks had put an end to his government in 1918. The family then spent a year in Germany, where Adile started school; then moved to France where they settled. An invitation by Turkey's founding president Atat√ºrk to her father to come and work in Turkey, and the latter's accepting the invitation, brought about a radical change in Adile's life. Once in Turkey, Adile became Adile Arsal as her father took on a new surname according to the law. She went on with her education in Istanbul, at a French nuns' school, Lyc√©e Notre Dame de Sion Istanbul, and so continued the French education she had been introduced to in Paris. Raised thus in the French intellectual tradition, Adile became, and remained to the last, a French intellectual at heart, unable to suffer fools. She then attended the law school in Ankara where her father was teaching. She was also a staunch Kemalist throughout her life. Known for her strong personality, she was in fact one of the many formidable women the modernizing efforts of the Turkish Republic would bring to the fore. Ayda was married twice. Her first marriage, to a physician, was very brief. Her second husband was Re≈üid Mazhar Ayda (1900‚Äì1986), a United States-educated mechanical engineer whom she married in 1942. He was the descendant of an old Ottoman family of Istanbul. The Aydas had two daughters and five grandchildren.

Biography Penance was born from the ashes of Dream Death, when several members decided to pursue a more traditional doom direction. Dream Death existed during mid eighties and played a mixture of doom, hardcore and thrash metal. Founders of Penance were drummer Mike Smail and guitarist Terry Weston (both previously members of Dream Death) and they were the core of the band from its early days to the disbanding. The band changed various line-ups, and one of their most notable members were Mary Bielich (Novembers Doom). Penance's debut The Road Less Travelled, featuring Brian Lawrence (who was also previously a member of Dreath Death) on vocals and guitar, was released 1992, under Lee Dorrian's label Rise Above Records. Alongside with Revelation's debut, it was a first doom metal album released on this label. They embarked on a European tour in support of Cathedral and Sleep. Their second album, Parallel Corners, was released 1994, by the European metal label Century Media. Many fans consider this the band's best album, and it's also considered one of the classics of 1990s (traditional) doom metal. On the next releases Penance adopted a slight range of psychedelic influences, but still remained fairly closed to their traditional doom roots. Spiritualnatural (2003) was the band's final album. They embarked on a European tour in 2004 partnered with Well of Souls and Orodruin. They split that same year. The Road Revisited was released in 2005, which is the unreleased original recorded version of the first album. Mike Smail went on to join Internal Void and doom legends Pentagram.

Characteristics  The American Warmblood is usually between high and may come in any color, though the solid colors are the most common. Horses of nearly all bloodlines are eligible for registration as American Warmbloods, as long as they are of a sport horse or warmblood type, and are able to meet the appropriate studbook selection or performance criteria. The emphasis is on the quality of each individual horse, for both registration and breeding approval. While the ideal horse for registration is already a warmblood type, there are no breed restrictions for American Warmbloods. Horses which are 100% hot or cold blooded are not typical, but can be registered if they are able to meet the registry's performance standards (this would include draft horses, Arabians, and Thoroughbreds). Gaited horse breeds (like the Tennessee Walker, Missouri Fox Trotter, or Icelandic horses) are also non-typical, though if they are able to perform walk-trot-canter in the appropriate levels of the accepted disciplines, they too can be eligible for registration. Horses which fail to meet or have yet to meet these performance criteria may still be issued recording papers, but are not considered registered American Warmbloods until they satisfy performance or inspection standards. Breeding stock must be approved for breeding through studbook inspection, which requires mares and stallions to meet even more stringent inspection and/or performance criteria.  Breed history  There are two registries in the United States which recognize American Warmbloods - the American Warmblood Society & Sporthorse Registry and the American Warmblood Registry, both of which are recognized by the World Breeding Federation for Sport Horses (WBFSH). The American Warmblood is more of a \\"type\\" than a \\"breed\\". Like most of the European warmbloods, the American Warmblood has an \\"open\\" book. There is more emphasis on producing quality sport horses, rather than the preservation of any particular bloodlines, which allows for much diversity in the bloodlines of American Warmbloods. The American Warmblood has been influenced by the European warmbloods, the Thoroughbred and the Arabian, as well as some draft horse breeds. Both registries have also begun sport pony books, creating similar performance registries for North American ponies.

Ordered in 1931, the ship was constructed by Palmers Shipbuilding and Iron Company, and entered naval service in 1932. Diana was initially assigned to the Mediterranean Fleet before she was transferred to the China Station in early 1935. She was temporarily deployed in the Red Sea during late 1935 during the Abyssinia Crisis, before returning to her duty station where she remained until mid-1939. Diana was transferred back to the Mediterranean Fleet just before the Second World War began in September 1939. She served with the Home Fleet during the Norwegian Campaign. The ship was transferred to the Royal Canadian Navy in 1940 and renamed HMCS Margaree. She served for just over a month with the Canadians before being sunk in a collision with a large freighter she was escorting on 22 October 1940.

A rare horse breed today, it is recognized by its cream color, known as \\"gold champagne\\", produced by the action of the champagne gene upon a chestnut base color, and by its amber eyes, also characteristic of the gene; the only other color found in the breed is chestnut. Like several other breeds of draft horses, the American Cream is at risk for the autosomal recessive genetic disease junctional epidermolysis bullosa. The breed was developed in Iowa during the early 20th century, beginning with a cream-colored mare named Old Granny. The Great Depression threatened the breed's existence, but several breeders worked to improve the color and type of the breed, and in 1944 a breed registry was formed. The mechanization of farming in the mid-20th century led to a decrease in the breed's population and the registry became inactive for several decades. It was reactivated in 1982 and population numbers have slowly grown since then. However, population numbers are still considered critical by The Livestock Conservancy and the Equus Survival Trust. Characteristics American Creams have refined heads, with flat facial profiles that are neither concave nor convex. They have wide chests, sloping shoulders and short, strong backs. Their ribs are well sprung, and they are short-coupled with well-muscled hindquarters and with strong well-proportioned legs set well apart. They are sure-footed with strong hooves, and their movement is free and easy. According to enthusiasts, the breed has a calm, willing temperament, particularly suited for owners who are new to handling draft horses. Mares stand high and weigh , while stallions and geldings stand and weigh or more. The ideal coat color for the breed is a medium cream with pink skin, amber eyes and a white mane and tail. The characteristic cream color of the breed is produced by the champagne gene. Recognized colors include light, medium and dark cream, with amber or hazel eyes. A cream mare with dark skin and a light mane and tail may be accepted by the registry as foundation stock, while stallions must have pink skin and white manes and tails to be registered. Purebred American Cream foals that are too dark to be accepted into the main breed registry may be recorded into an appendix registry. The appendix will also accept half-bred Cream Draft horses crossed with other draft bloodlines if they meet certain requirements, and the registry provides an upgrade system that uses appendix horses to strengthen genes, increase breed numbers, and allow more diversified bloodlines. =Color genetics= The champagne gene produces diluted color, and the gold champagne body color, light skin, light eyes, and ivory mane and tail associated with the American Cream Draft are produced by the action of the champagne gene on a chestnut base coat. In the adult horse, the skin is pink with abundant dark freckles or mottling, and the eyes are hazel or amber. The eyes of champagne foals are blue at birth, darkening as they age, and a foal's skin is bright pink. The breed registry describes foals' eyes as \\"almost white\\", which is consistent with the nature of the champagne blue foal eye, which is creamier than other types of blue eye. Skin freckling is slightly visible around the muzzle of this resting horse Champagne is a dominant trait, based on a mutation in the SLC36A1 gene. The mapping of the gene was announced in 2008, and the American Cream Draft cross was among the breeds studied. The authors of this study noted that it was difficult to distinguish between homozygous and heterozygous animals, thus distinguishing champagne from incomplete dominant dilutions such as the cream gene. However they noted that homozygotes may have less mottling or a slightly lighter hair color than heterozygotes. Anecdotal reports also note mild differences, including lighter freckling, skin and hair coat, though eye color remains the same. Dark-skinned American Cream Draft horses are actually chestnuts, as the breed is not homozygous for the champagne gene; only one allele is needed to produce the proper color. Champagne dilutes any base coat color, and in the American Cream Draft, the underlying genetic base color is chestnut. As of 2003, scientists have not found the breed to carry the cream gene, even though breeders refer to the desired color as \\"cream\\". The American Cream Draft is never cremello or white, and though the gold coat color with a white mane and tail resembles palomino, the breed's defining characteristics are the result of the champagne gene. =Junctional epidermolysis bullosa= The autosomal recessive genetic disease junctional epidermolysis bullosa (JEB) has been found in some American Cream Drafts. This is a lethal genetic disorder that causes newborn foals to lose large areas of skin and have other abnormalities, normally leading to euthanasia of the animal. It is most commonly associated with Belgian horses, but is also found in other draft breeds. A DNA test was developed in 2002, and JEB can be avoided as long as two carriers are not bred to one another. The American Cream registry states that it has \\"been pro- active in testing its registered animals since JEB was discovered\\". Breed history Head and shoulders of an American Cream The American Cream is the only breed of draft horse developed in the United States that is still in existence today. The breed descends from a foundation mare named Old Granny. She was probably foaled between 1900 and 1905, and was first noticed at an auction in Story County, Iowa, in 1911 and purchased by Harry Lakin, a well- known stock dealer. She was eventually sold to Nelson Brothers Farm in Jewell, Iowa. Her breeding is not known, but she was cream-colored and many of her foals were as well; they sold for above-average prices because of their color. Her cream-colored coat, pink skin and amber eyes are defining standards for the breed, and the color is now known as gold champagne. In 1946, two years after the breed registry was formed, 98 percent of the horses registered could be traced back to Old Granny. In 1920, a colt of Old Granny's named Nelson's Buck No. 2 impressed veterinarian Eric Christian to the point that Christian asked the Nelsons not to geld him. They agreed to let him remain a stallion, and he sired several cream-colored foals, though only one was registered: a colt named Yancy No. 3, whose dam was a black mare of Percheron breeding. Yancy sired Knox 1st, born in 1926 to an unregistered bay mare of mixed Shire ancestry. From this sire line, in 1931, a great-great-grandson of Nelson's Buck was born, named Silver Lace No. 9. Silver Lace was to become one of the most influential stallions of the American Cream breed. His dam was a Belgian mare with light chestnut coloring, and she is credited with Silver Lace's size ‚Äì at he weighed considerably more than most of his bloodline. Silver Lace quickly became a popular stallion in Iowa. However, stallions standing for public stud service in Iowa were required to be registered with the Iowa Department of Agriculture, and this agency only allowed horses of recognized breeds. As Silver Lace was not registered with any breed registry, his owners created a breeding syndicate, and mare owners who bought shares in the \\"Silver Lace Horse Company\\" could breed their mares to him. However, his main breeding career coincided with the economic struggles of the Great Depression, and Silver Lace was at one point hidden in a neighbor's barn to prevent his sale at auction. Another significant foundation stallion was Ead's Captain, whose bloodlines appear in about one-third of all American Cream Drafts. Around 1935, despite the Depression, a few breeders started to linebreed and inbreed cream-colored horses to fix their color and type. In particular, C.T. Rierson began buying cream-colored mares sired by Silver Lace and developing the American Cream breed in earnest. In 1944, a breed association, the American Cream Association, was formed by 20 owners and breeders and granted a corporate charter in the state of Iowa. In 1950, the breed was finally recognized by the Iowa Department of Agriculture, based on a 1948 recommendation by the National Stallion Enrollment Board. The mechanization of farming in the mid-20th century led to a decrease in the overall draft horse population, and with Rierson's death in 1957, American Cream Draft numbers began to decline. By the late 1950s there were only 200 living American Creams registered, owned by only 41 breeders. The registry became inactive until 1982 when three families who had retained their herds reactivated and reorganized the registry. In 1994, the organization officially changed its name to the American Cream Draft Horse Association (ACDHA). =1990s to the present= In 1982, owners began blood-typing their horses, and by 1990, genetic testing found that \\"compared with other draft breeds and based upon gene marker data, the Creams form a distinct group within the draft horses.\\" The American Cream Draft was found to have a genetic relationship with the Belgian breed that was no closer than the ones it had with the Percheron, Suffolk Punch and Haflinger breeds. Registry records dating to the early 20th century show no bloodlines other than draft breeding. As of 2000 there were 222 registered horses, a number that increased to 350 as of 2004. Of these, 40 were \\"tracking horses\\" ‚Äì either purebred American Creams that did not meet color requirements or crossbred horses that mix American Cream and other draft blood, but still meet the physical requirements for the registry. These tracking horses are allowed by certain regulations to be used as breeding stock, with the resulting foals able to be registered as purebred American Creams. Around 30 new horses are registered each year. The Livestock Conservancy considers the breed to be at \\"critical\\" status, meaning that the estimated global population of the breed is less than 2,000 and there are less than 200 registrations annually in the US. The Equus Survival Trust also considers the population to be \\"critical\\", meaning that there are between 100 and 300 active adult breeding mares in existence today. To help replenish numbers, the ACDHA has developed regulations to permit foals to be registered when produced via methods such as artificial insemination and embryo transfer. Careful use of the appendix registry also allows numbers to increase. The American Creams that live in Colonial Williamsburg have been called \\"the most famous of all American Cream Draft horses\\". In the village they are used for wagon and carriage rides, and as of 2006 there is a breeding program run by Colonial Williamsburg that is working to increase breed numbers.

It has smooth greyish brown bark sometimes with ribbony bark near the base, egg- shaped to lance-shaped adult leaves, flower buds in groups of three, red, pinkish or creamy white flowers and down-turned, conical fruit with prominent ribs. Description Eucalyptus pyriformis is a straggly mallee that typically grows to a height of and to a width of and forms a lignotuber. In nature, it tends to be multi-stemmed but in cultivation it is more likely to be single stemmed. The bark is smooth, grey or salmon-pink coloured, often shedding in ribbons at the base. Young plants and coppice regrowth have leaves that are arranged alternately, dull bluish green, egg-shaped to broadly lance- shaped, long and wide and petiolate. Adult leaves are the same shade of dull bluish or greyish green on both sides, egg-shaped to lance-shaped, long and wide, tapering to a petiole long. Mature buds are oval, long and wide with ribs on the sides and a beaked operculum. Flowering occurs between May and October and the flowers are red, pinkish or creamy white flowers. The fruit is a woody, pendent, conical capsule long and wide on a pedicel long and with prominent ribs on the sides. Taxonomy Eucalyptus pyriformis was first formally described by the botanist Nicolai Stepanovitch Turczaninow in 1849 in the journal, Bulletin de la Soci√©t√© Imp√©riale des Naturalistes de Moscou.

Laurentii Salvii. i‚Äìii, 1‚Äì824 pp DOI: 10.5962/bhl.title.542: 400. the common glow-worm of Europe (see also \\"glowworm\\"), is the type species of beetle in the genus Lampyris and the family Lampyridae. Lampyris noctiluca presents a conspicuous sexual dimorphism. The males are winged, with brown elytra, a clearer pronotum and a large brown spot in the middle, while females are larviforme, wings are missing and they are often twice the size of the males (up to in length). These beetles use their bioluminescence to attract mates. The adult females are mostly famed for their glow, although all stages of their life cycle are capable of glowing. In Britain, this species is fairly common compared to its cousin Phosphaenus hemipterus ‚Äì the lesser glow worm ‚Äì which is very rare. Distribution The range of this beetle stretches from Portugal and Ireland in the west, right across Europe, Africa and Asia to China in the east. It also survives further north than any other firefly, almost reaching the Arctic Circle. It is not found in North America, South America, South Asia, Australia and Antarctica. Light production Female Lampyris noctiluca Light production is vital for Lampyris noctiluca. With it they have greater chances of mating, so there is a complex process involved. They emit yellowish-green light from the translucent underside of their last three abdominal segments to attract the smaller males, which are winged. They will glow for two hours and then retreat back into their hiding place until the next night, or stop glowing as soon as they find a mate. The females can survive for at least 10 consecutive nights doing this. The light can be seen by males up to 50 yards away. The light is emitted continuously, although they will wave their abdomens from side to side, which gives the impression of it brightening and dimming. Larvae are sometimes seen to glow, although they seem able to turn off their light more easily than the female, especially when disturbed. The insect can regulate its light production by controlling the oxygen supply to the light emitting membranes containing luciferin. The chemical reaction producing the light from luciferin is catalysed by luciferase, the exact chemical structure of which is determined by the glow worms' individual genetic structure, which in turn determines subtle differences in the light produced from individual to individual. Virtually all of the energy produced is light; only 2% is heat. The brightness of the glow is used by the males as an indicator of female fecundity. Males are more likely to fly to a brighter female, because it is larger and has more eggs. Due to this, females compete against each other for matings. The males are sometimes attracted to man-made light fixtures. The peak glowing period is evenings in June and July. Habitat They are found in old-growth grassland, especially on chalk and limestone soils. They are also found in verges, hedgebanks, and on heaths. The larvae live in sheltered places ‚Äì under rocks and wood, but do crawl over different terrains. Lifecycle Lampyris noctiluca ‚Äì larva feeding Larva feeding on snail - dorsal view Female and two male glow worms mating. Once the females have attracted the males with their glow, they mate, lay eggs, and die. Typically, 50‚Äì100 are laid over three days, with the adult not surviving to see them hatch. They are laid in fairly moist places, e.g. stem of grass or under moss. The eggs are pale yellow, 1 mm across. They may glow faintly yellow and take between 27 and 45 days to hatch depending on the weather (colder=longer). The eggs hatch after two or three weeks. Larvae and adult females look similar, but larvae have bright spots on each of 12 segments, whereas adult females have a completely black back. The predatory larvae feed for two or three years on slugs and snails which they inject with a brown, toxic, digestive fluid, delivered by a series of nips and bites. The poison takes a while to work, and the larva has to be careful not to become stuck to any protective mucus that its prey may secrete. The prey is gradually paralysed and the digestive fluid turns part of it into a brown broth that the larva can lap up. The prey remains alive, and some partially eaten victims have been known to crawl away after the meal. The slugs and snails are often 200 times the weight of the beetle larva. The larvae are nocturnal, and are most active during moist conditions, when their prey are most active. The larvae may moult four to five times in their lifetimes. They spend their winters under logs, stones, wood holes, or leaf litter, their bodies drawn in like concertinas, hibernating as their food source becomes increasingly hard to find. They wake up in spring, and the cycle is repeated for one more year, or possibly two. They become adults from May to July or sometimes later, surviving on food reserves built up during time as a larva, and dying after reproducing. Threats to species numbers Threats include habitat destruction, habitat fragmentation, pesticide over-use, pollution, distraction by artificial lights, insufficient grazing and climate change.

He was a Rector of the University of Arts in Belgrade (1979‚Äì1983). He was a composer, music writer, and pedagogue, active primarily in the Republic of Serbia. He composed significant chamber and concertante works, but his most considerable contribution to Serbian music belongs to the genre of symphonic music. His oeuvre consists of over two hundred works. Apart from music, Obradoviƒá expressed his creativity through visual arts and writing. His paintings, conceived predominantly in watercolor technique were displayed at one individual and several group exhibitions, the former entitled Color, Sound, Word (Kolarac University, Belgrade, November 27, 1997). The book of his selected poetry Somewhere inside me was published the same year (1997).  Biography  Aleksandar Obradoviƒá was born in 1927 in Bled, Slovenia. Following the completion of composition studies at the Music Academy in Belgrade with Professor Mihovil Logar, he continued his education with L. Berkeley in London and with V. Ussachevsky in the United States, where he turned to the examination of electronic music. He began teaching at the music school ‚ÄúStankoviƒá‚Äù during the academic year 1953-54, followed by a position at the Belgrade Music Academy where he taught theory disciplines, orchestration, and composition. Obradoviƒá was President of the Composers Association of Yugoslavia from 1962-66, Rector of the Belgrade University of Arts from 1979-83, and Chair of the Department of Composition and Orchestration at the School of Music in Belgrade. As a music writer and critic he published articles in Politika, Borba, and Literary magazine (Knji≈æevne novine), and periodicals Pro musica and The Sound (Zvuk). Obradoviƒá authored the textbook An Introduction to orchestration (Uvod u orkestraciju) (University of Arts, Belgrade, 1978), published in two editions and translated into the Italian language. He is also a recipient of the October Award for his composition The Symphonic epitaph (1959) and the July 7th Work Life Legacy Award (Sedmojulska nagrada) in 1980.  Works  Symphonic music occupies the most important place in the oeuvre of Aleksandar Obradoviƒá, considered one of the most significant Serbian symphonicists during the second half of the 20th century. Obradoviƒá composed eight symphonies, Prelude and fugue for string orchestra (1954), Ascesis for large string orchestra and celesta, suite Through the universe, and Epitaph H for symphonic orchestra and tape. Among his notable orchestral works are also: Concerto for clarinet and strings, Concertino for piano and strings, Symphonic scherzo in D, Scherzo-Overture, and the Komitaji dance (Komitska igra). He composed music for ballet the Spring reveille; two cantatas, A Symphonic epitaph (in two versions, for string and wind orchestra, each with choir and soloists) and Sutjeska; a solemn, commemorative spectacle The Student days ≈†umarica (ƒêaƒçko doba ≈†umarica); and several song cycles (The Wind of Flame (Plameni vjetar) for voice and orchestra being the most extensive among them, and Stradun, the three musical pastels after poetic impressions entitled The Green Knight (Zeleni vitez) by Miroslav Beloviƒá). Obradoviƒá's body of works also includes chamber pieces (Quintet for flute, clarinet, violin, viola, and cello, Intermezzo for string quartet, and Scherzo for string quintet), piano pieces (Little variations and Sonatina), choral works (Little choral suite, Marika, and An Ohrid impression (Ohridska impresija)), and music for film and radio-dramas. An important place in his work belongs to the editing and instrumentation of the Cantata to Dositej Obradoviƒá by Josif Marinkoviƒá and the Heroic oratorio by Vojislav Vuƒçkoviƒá. Obradoviƒá's Electronic toccata and fugue from 1967 is one of the first works of Serbian music realized in electronic medium.  Musical Language  The musical language and creative poetics of Aleksandar Obradoviƒá could be interpreted as dominantly modernist, whereas the composer covers the stylistic realm from neoclassicism (The First symphony) to neo-expressionism (Microsymphony). One of the main features of Obradoviƒá's craft is his sense for clear and perspicuous form and structural architectonics, grounded in traditional formal schemes. These forms, replete with harmonies based on expanded tonality and chromaticism, nonetheless imply certain clearly discernible tonal anchors. The complex counterpoint evident in many of Obradoviƒá's works often impels polytonality, with apparent clusters, elements of twelve-tone technique, Aleatory, and parallel motions of convoluted chord structures. Obradoviƒá's music is also characterized by rich and multifarious orchestral sound and utilization of electronic medium. The composer's tendency toward broadening and enhancing traditional forms is evident in his Second symphony (1964) and Epitaph H (1965) that feature the twelve-tone technique, or in the Microsymphony (The Third symphony, 1967) enriched by the use of electronic medium. Epitaph H is conceived as a symphonic inscription on an imaginary tomb in the wake of a vast catastrophe of mankind. As a unique motto for this composition Obradoviƒá chose verses from Lucretius‚Äô epic poem On the Nature of Things. The contrast between the twelve-tone row, varied intricate rhythms, and polytonality on one side, and a recording of Beethoven‚Äôs Symphony no. 9 that ‚Äúsymbolizes a compassionate humanistic message from the past‚Äù on the other, serves as an unequivocal admonition to mankind. Obradoviƒá's Concerto for Piano and Orchestra (1999) also offers a similar programmatic background. The bold musical means that fringe on atonality, especially in the tempestuous first and third movements, reinforce ideological references from the concerto's subtitle Pro libertate. In the opening part, marked by tempo and character Allegro risoluto e con colera, prominent are complex clusters, which, according to the composer represent ‚Äúa reverberation of tumultuous micro-polyphony.‚Äù In context of the 1999 NATO bombing of Serbia during which this work was contrived, noteworthy seems the inspiration for the concerto's slow second movement Obradoviƒá found in a melody from Mokranjac's Octoechos. The melody's modal structure insofar effectuated tonal and modal centricity of this movement and the quasi-improvisatory treatment of the adopted melody- theme. The ultimate revelation of the composer's pursuit of freedom emerges in the final movement, in the theme delivered by trumpets, in which Obradoviƒá in Morse code conveys the word libertas‚Äìfreedom. In Ascesis, composed on occasion of the 70th anniversary of the Belgrade Philharmonic, Obradoviƒá, as indicated by the work's title, utilizes minimalist compositional techniques. The entire composition unfolds rendering reduced musical material‚Äîthat is‚Äîuntil the appearance of a lilting theme in the violin, only eight measures before the work's end. The employment of such sharp contrasts underscores yet another characteristic of Obradoviƒá's musical language and could be interpreted in the context of his continual search for new expressive solutions. The last work of Aleksandar Obradoviƒá, Passacaglia for strings (2001) also reveals a certain aspect in use of contrasts. Composed after the tune Crni goro (from the Mokranjac's song-wreath), the Passacaglia is based on a combination of a simple folk tune and complex counterpoint, mixtures, and copious orchestration. Given the fact that the folk-originated themes were not the focus of Obradoviƒá's attention and affinities, this work, completed only several months before the composer's death represents a somewhat unexpected shift in his oeuvre.

It does this by concomitantly inhibiting the serotonin transporter (SERT), norepinephrine transporter (NET), and dopamine transporter (DAT), respectively. Inhibition of the reuptake of these neurotransmitters increases their extracellular concentrations and, therefore, results in an increase in serotonergic, adrenergic, and dopaminergic neurotransmission. SNDRIs were developed as potential antidepressants and treatments for other disorders, such as obesity, cocaine addiction, attention- deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and chronic pain. They are an extension of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin- norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) whereby the addition of dopaminergic action is thought to have the possibility of heightening therapeutic benefit. However, increased side effects and abuse potential are potential concerns of these agents relative to their SSRI and SNRI counterparts. The SNDRIs are similar to non-selective monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) such as phenelzine and tranylcypromine in that they increase the action of all three of the major monoamine neurotransmitters. They are also similar to serotonin-norepinephrine-dopamine releasing agents (SNDRAs) like MDMA (\\"ecstasy\\") and Œ±-ethyltryptamine (Œ±ET) for the same reason, although they act via a different mechanism and have differing physiological and qualitative effects. Cocaine is a naturally occurring SNDRI with a fast onset and short duration (about two hours) that is widely encountered as a drug of abuse. Although their primary mechanisms of action are as NMDA receptor antagonists, ketamine and phencyclidine are also SNDRIs and are similarly encountered as drugs of abuse. Indications =Depression= Major depressive disorder (MDD) is the foremost reason supporting the need for development of an SNDRI. According to the World Health Organization, depression is the leading cause of disability and the 4th leading contributor to the global burden of disease in 2000. By the year 2020, depression is projected to reach 2nd place in the ranking of DALYs. About 16% of the population is estimated to be affected by major depression, and another 1% is affected by bipolar disorder, one or more times throughout an individual's lifetime. The presence of the common symptoms of these disorders are collectively called 'depressive syndrome' and includes a long-lasting depressed mood, feelings of guilt, anxiety, and recurrent thoughts of death and suicide. Other symptoms including poor concentration, a disturbance of sleep rhythms (insomnia or hypersomnia), and severe fatigue may also occur. Individual patients present differing subsets of symptoms, which may change over the course of the disease highlighting its multifaceted and heterogeneous nature. Depression is often highly comorbid with other diseases, e.g. cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction, stroke), diabetes, cancer, Depressed subjects are prone to smoking, substance abuse, eating disorders, obesity, high blood pressure, pathological gambling and internet addiction, and on average have a 15 to 30 year shorter lifetime compared with the general population. Major depression can strike at virtually any time of life as a function of genetic and developmental pre-disposition in interaction with adverse life-events. Although common in the elderly, over the course of the last century, the average age for a first episode has fallen to ~30 years. However, depressive states (with subtly different characteristics) are now frequently identified in adolescents and even children. The differential diagnosis (and management) of depression in young populations requires considerable care and experience; for example, apparent depression in teenagers may later transpire to represent a prodromal phase of schizophrenia. The ability to work, familial relationships, social integration, and self-care are all severely disrupted. The genetic contribution has been estimated as 40-50%. However, combinations of multiple genetic factors may be involved because a defect in a single gene usually fails to induce the multifaceted symptoms of depression. =Pharmacotherapy= There remains a need for more efficacious antidepressant agents. Although two-thirds of patients will ultimately respond to antidepressant treatment, one-third of patients respond to placebo, and remission is frequently sub-maximal (residual symptoms). In addition to post-treatment relapse, depressive symptoms can even recur in the course of long-term therapy (tachyphylaxis). Also, currently available antidepressants all elicit undesirable side-effects, and new agents should be divested of the distressing side-effects of both first and second-generation antidepressants. Another serious drawback of all antidepressants is the requirement for long-term administration prior to maximal therapeutic efficacy. Although some patients show a partial response within 1‚Äì2 weeks, in general one must reckon with a delay of 3‚Äì6 weeks before full efficacy is attained. In general, this delay to onset of action is attributed to a spectrum of long-term adaptive changes. These include receptor desensitization, alterations in intracellular transduction cascades and gene expression, the induction of neurogenesis, and modifications in synaptic architecture and signaling. Depression has been associated with impaired neurotransmission of serotonergic (5-HT), noradrenergic (NE), and dopaminergic (DA) pathways, although most pharmacologic treatment strategies directly enhance only 5-HT and NE neurotransmission. In some patients with depression, DA-related disturbances improve upon treatment with antidepressants, it is presumed by acting on serotonergic or noradrenergic circuits, which then affect DA function. However, most antidepressant treatments do not directly enhance DA neurotransmission, which may contribute to residual symptoms, including impaired motivation, concentration, and pleasure. Preclinical and clinical research indicates that drugs inhibiting the reuptake of all three of these neurotransmitters can produce a more rapid onset of action and greater efficacy than traditional antidepressants. DA may promote neurotrophic processes in the adult hippocampus, as 5-HT and NA do. It is thus possible that the stimulation of multiple signalling pathways resulting from the elevation of all three monoamines may account, in part, for an accelerated and/or greater antidepressant response. Dense connections exist between monoaminergic neurons. Dopaminergic neurotransmission regulates the activity of 5-HT and NE in the dorsal raphe nucleus (DR) and locus coeruleus (LC), respectively. In turn, the ventral tegmental area (VTA) is sensitive to 5-HT and NE release. In the case of SSRIs, the promiscuity among transporters means that there may be more than a single type of neurotransmitter to consider (e.g. 5-HT, DA, NE, etc.) as mediating the therapeutic actions of a given medication. MATs are able to transport monoamines other than their \\"native\\" neurotransmitter. It was advised to consider the role of the organic cation transporters (OCT) and the plasma membrane monoamine transporter (PMAT). To examine the role of monoamine transporters in models of depression DAT, NET, and SERT knockout (KO) mice and wild-type littermates were studied in the forced swim test (FST), the tail suspension test, and for sucrose consumption. The effects of DAT KO in animal models of depression are larger than those produced by NET or SERT KO, and unlikely to be simply the result of the confounding effects of locomotor hyperactivity; thus, these data support reevaluation of the role that DAT expression could play in depression and the potential antidepressant effects of DAT blockade. The SSRIs were intended to be highly selective at binding to their molecular targets. However it may be an oversimplification, or at least controversial in thinking that complex psychiatric (and neurological) diseases are easily solved by such a monotherapy. While it may be inferred that dysfunction of 5-HT circuits is likely to be a part of the problem, it is only one of many such neurotransmitters whose signaling can be affected by suitably designed medicines attempting to alter the course of the disease state. Most common CNS disorders are highly polygenic in nature; that is, they are controlled by complex interactions between numerous gene products. As such, these conditions do not exhibit the single gene defect basis that is so attractive for the development of highly-specific drugs largely free of major undesirable side- effects (\\"the magic bullet\\"). Second, the exact nature of the interactions that occur between the numerous gene products typically involved in CNS disorders remain elusive, and the biological mechanisms underlying mental illnesses are poorly understood. Clozapine is an example of a drug used in the treatment of certain CNS disorders, such as schizophrenia, that has superior efficacy precisely because of its broad-spectrum mode of action. Likewise, in cancer chemotherapeutics, it has been recognized that drugs active at more than one target have a higher probability of being efficacious. In addition, the nonselective MAOIs and the TCA SNRIs are widely believed to have an efficacy that is superior to the SSRIs normally picked as the first-line choice of agents for/in the treatment of MDD and related disorders. The reason for this is based on the fact that SSRIs are safer than nonselective MAOIs and TCAs. This is both in terms of there being less mortality in the event of overdose, but also less risk in terms of dietary restrictions (in the case of the nonselective MAOIs), hepatotoxicity (MAOIs) or cardiotoxicity (TCAs). =Applications other than depression= * Alcoholism (c.f.

However, it appears to act as a prodrug in vivo to metabolites that are considerably more potent and possess different ratios of monoamine reuptake inhibition in comparison, and in accordance, sibutramine behaves contrarily as an SNRI (73% and 54% for norepinephrine and serotonin reuptake inhibition, respectively) in human volunteers with only very weak and probably inconsequential inhibition of dopamine reuptake (16%). Venlafaxine (Effexor) is sometimes referred to as an SNDRI, but is extremely imbalanced with values of 82 nM for SERT, 2480 nM for NET ,and 7647 nM for DAT, with a ratio of 1:30:93.

In this regard, the p m-dichloro phenyl analog of venlafaxine was dropped from further development after its potential mutagenicity was called into question. The mutagenicity of this compound is still doubtful though. It was dropped for other reasons likely related to speed at which it could be released onto the market relative to the more developed compound venlafaxine. More recently, the carcinogenicity of PRC200-SS was likewise reported. (+)-CPCA (\\"nocaine\\") is the 3R,4S piperidine stereoisomer of (phenyltropane based) RTI-31. It is non addictive, although this might be due to it being a NDRI, not a SNDRI. The Œ≤-naphthyl analog of \\"Nocaine\\" is a SNDRI though in the case of both the SS and RR enantiomers. Consider the piperidine analogs of brasofensine and tesofensine. These were prepared by NeuroSearch (In Denmark) by the chemists Peter Moldt (2002), and Frank W√§tjen (2004‚Äì2009). There are four separate isomers to consider (SS, RR, S/R and R/S). This is because there are two chiral carbon sites of asymmetry (means 2 to the power of n isomers to consider where n is the number of chiral carbons). They are therefore a diastereo(iso)meric pair of racemers. With a racemic pair of diastereomers, there is still the question of syn (cis) or anti (trans). In the case of the phenyltropanes, although there are four chiral carbons, there are only eight possible isomers to consider. This is based on the fact that the compound is bicyclic and therefore does not adhere to the equation given above. It is complicated to explain which isomers are desired. For example, although Alan P. Kozikowski showed that R/S nocaine is less addictive than SS Nocaine, studies on variously substituted phenyltropanes by F. Ivy Carrollhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZCNaQFVkhs et at. revealed that the Œ≤Œ≤ isomers were less likely to cause convulsions, tremor and death than the corresponding trans isomers (more specifically, what is meant is the 1R,2R,3S isomers). While it does still have to be conceded that RTI-55 caused death at a dosage of 100 mg/kg, it's therapeutic index of safety is still much better than the corresponding trans isomers because it is more potent compound. In discussing cocaine and related compounds such as amphetamines, it is clear that these psychostimulants cause increased blood pressure, decreased appetite (and hence weight loss), increased locomotor activity (LMA) etc. In the United States, cocaine overdose is one of the leading causes of ER admissions each year due to drug overdose. People are at increased risk of heart attack and stroke and also present with an array of psychiatric symptoms including anxiety & paranoia etc. On removal of the 2C tropane bridge and on going from RTI-31 to the simpler SS and RS Nocaine it was seen that these compounds still possessed activity as NDRIs but were not powerful psychostimulants. Hence, this might be viewed as a strategy for increasing the safety of the compounds and would also be preferable to use in patients who are not looking to achieve weight loss. In light of the above paragraph, another way of reducing the psychomotor stimulant and addictive qualities of phenyltropane stimulants is in picking one that is relatively serotonergic. This strategy was employed with success for RTI-112. Another thing that is important and should be mentioned is the risk for serotonin syndrome when incorporating the element of 5-HT transporter inhibition into a compound that is already fully active as a NDRI (or vice versa). The reasons for serotonin syndrome are complicated and not fully understood. Addiction Drug addiction may be regarded as a disease of the brain reward system. This system, closely related to the system of emotional arousal, is located predominantly in the limbic structures of the brain. Its existence was proved by demonstration of the \\"pleasure centers,\\" that were discovered as the location from which electrical self-stimulation is readily evoked. The main neurotransmitter involved in the reward is dopamine, but other monoamines and acetylcholine may also participate. The anatomical core of the reward system are dopaminergic neurons of the ventral tegmentum that project to the nucleus accumbens, amygdala, prefrontal cortex and other forebrain structures. There are several groups of substances that activate the reward system and they may produce addiction, which in humans is a chronic, recurrent disease, characterized by absolute dominance of drug-seeking behavior. According to various studies, the relative likelihood of rodents and non-human primates self-administering various psychostimulants that modulate monoaminergic neurotransmission is lessened as the dopaminergic compounds become more serotonergic. The above finding has been found for amphetamine and some of its variously substituted analogs including PAL-287 etc. RTI-112 is another good example of the compound becoming less likely to be self- administered by the test subject in the case of a dopaminergic compound that also has a marked affinity for the serotonin transporter. WIN 35428, RTI-31, RTI-51 and RTI-55 were all compared and it was found that there was a negative correlation between the size of the halogen atom and the rate of self- administration (on moving across the series). Rate of onset was held partly accountable for this, although increasing the potency of the compounds for the serotonin transporter also played a role. Further evidence that 5-HT dampens the reinforcing actions of dopaminergic medications comes from the co- administration of psychostimulants with SSRIs, and the phen/fen combination was also shown to have limited abuse potential relative to administration of phentermine only. NET blockade is unlikely to play a major role in mediating addictive behavior. This finding is based on the premise that desipramine is not self-administered, and also the fact that the NRI atomoxetine was not reinforcing. However, it was still shown to facilitate dopaminergic neurotransmission in certain brain regions such as in the core of the PFC. =Relation to cocaine= Cocaine is a short-acting SNDRI that also exerts auxiliary pharmacological actions on other receptors. Cocaine is a relatively \\"balanced\\" inhibitor, although facilitation of dopaminergic neurotransmission is what has been linked to the reinforcing and addictive effects. In addition, cocaine has some serious limitations in terms of its cardiotoxicity due to its local anesthetic activity. Thousands of cocaine users are admitted to emergency units in the USA every year because of this; thus, development of safer substitute medications for cocaine abuse could potentially have significant benefits for public health. Many of the SNDRIs currently being developed have varying degrees of similarity to cocaine in terms of their chemical structure. There has been speculation over whether the new SNDRIs will have an abuse potential like cocaine does. However, for pharmacotherapeutical treatment of cocaine addiction it is advantageous if a substitute medication is at least weakly reinforcing because this can serve to retain addicts in treatment programmes: > ... limited reinforcing properties in the context of treatment programs may > be advantageous, contributing to improved patient compliance and enhanced > medication effectiveness. However, not all SNDRIs are reliably self-administered by animals. Examples include: * PRC200-SS was not reliably self-administered. * RTI-112 was not self-administered because at low doses the compound preferentially occupies the SERT and not the DAT. * Tesofensine was also not reliably self- administered by human stimulant addicts. * The nocaine analog JZAD-IV-22 only partly substituted for cocaine in animals, but produced none of the psychomotor activation of cocaine, which is a trait marker for stimulant addiction. Legality Cocaine is a controlled drug (Class A in the UK; Schedule II in the USA); it has not been entirely outlawed in most countries, as despite having some \\"abuse potential\\" it is recognized that it does have medical uses. Brasofensine was made \\"class A\\" in the UK under the MDA (misuse of drugs act). The semi-synthetic procedure for making BF uses cocaine as the starting material. Naphyrone first appeared in 2006 as one of quite a large number of analogs of pyrovalerone designed by the well-known medicinal chemist P. Meltzer et al. When the designer drugs mephedrone and methylone became banned in the United Kingdom, vendors of these chemicals needed to find a suitable replacement. Mephedrone and methylone affect the same chemicals in the brain as a SNDRI, although they are thought to act as monoamine releasers and not act through the reuptake inhibitor mechanism of activity. A short time later, mephedrone and methylone were banned (which had become quite popular by the time they were illegalized), naphyrone appeared under the trade name NRG-1. NRG-1 was promptly illegalized, although it is not known if its use resulted in any hospitalizations or deaths. Role of monoamine neurotransmitters =Monoamine hypothesis= The original monoamine hypothesis postulates that depression is caused by a deficiency or imbalances in the monoamine neurotransmitters (5-HT, NE, and DA). This has been the central topic of depression research for approximately the last 50 years; it has since evolved into the notion that depression arises through alterations in target neurons (specifically, the dendrites) in monoamine pathways. When reserpine (an alkaloid with uses in the treatment of hypertension and psychosis) was first introduced to the West from India in 1953, the drug was unexpectedly shown to produce depression-like symptoms. Further testing was able to reveal that reserpine causes a depletion of monoamine concentrations in the brain. Reserpine's effect on monoamine concentrations results from blockade of the vesicular monoamine transporter, leading to their increased catabolism by monoamine oxidase. However, not everyone has been convinced by claims that reserpine is depressogenic, some authors (David Healy in particular) have even claimed that it is antidepressant. Tetrabenazine, a similar agent to reserpine, which also depletes catecholamine stores, and to a lesser degree 5-HT, was shown to induce depression in many patients. Iproniazid, an inhibitor of MAO, was noted to elevate mood in depressed patients in the early 1950s, and soon thereafter was shown to lead to an increase in NA and 5-HT. Hertting et al. demonstrated that the first TCA, imipramine, inhibited cellular uptake of NA in peripheral tissues. Moreover, both antidepressant agents were demonstrated to prevent reserpine-induced sedation. Likewise, administration of DOPA to laboratory animals was shown to reverse reserpine induced sedation; a finding reproduced in humans. Amphetamine, which releases NA from vesicles and prevents re-uptake was also used in the treatment of depression at the time with varying success. In 1965 Schildkraut formulated the catecholamine theory of depression. This was subsequently the most widely cited article in the American Journal of Psychiatry.http://www.fa.hms.harvard.edu/about-our-faculty/memorial- minutes/s/joseph-j-schildkraut/ The theory stated that \\"some, if not all, depressions are associated with an absolute or relative deficiency of catecholamines, in particular noradrenaline (NA), at functionally important adrenergic receptor sites in the brain. However, elation may be associated with an excess of such amines.\\" Shortly after Schildkraut's catecholamine hypothesis was published, Coppen proposed that 5-HT, rather than NA, was the more important neurotransmitter in depression. This was based on similar evidence to that which produced the NA theory as reserpine, imipramine, and iproniazid affect the 5-HT system, in addition to the noradrenergic system. It was also supported by work demonstrating that if catecholamine levels were depleted by up to 20% but 5-HT neurotransmission remained unaltered there was no sedation in animals. Alongside this, the main observation promoting the 5-HT theory was that administration of a MAOI in conjunction with tryptophan (precursor of 5-HT) elevated mood in control patients and potentiated the antidepressant effect of MAOI. Set against this, combination of an MAOI with DOPA did not produce a therapeutic benefit. Inserting a chlorine atom into imipramine leads to clomipramine, a drug that is much more SERT selective than the parent compound. Clomipramine was a predecessor to the development of the more recent SSRIs. There was, in fact, a time prior to the SSRIs when selective NRIs were being considered (c.f. talopram and melitracen). In fact, it is also believed that the selective NRI nisoxetine was discovered prior to the invention of fluoxetine. However, the selective NRIs did not get promoted in the same way as did the SSRIs, possibly due to an increased risk of suicide. This was accounted for on the basis of the energizing effect that these agents have.http://www.healyprozac.com/Book/Introduction.pdf Moreover, NRIs have the additional adverse safety risk of hypertension that is not seen for SSRIs. Nevertheless, NRIs have still found uses. Further support for the monoamine hypothesis came from monoamine depletion studies: * Alpha-methyl-p- tyrosine (AMPT) is a tyrosine hydroxylase enzyme inhibitor that serves to inhibit catecholamine synthesis. AMPT led to a resurgence of depressive symptoms in patients improved by the NE reuptake inhibitor (NRI) desipramine, but not by the SSRI fluoxetine. The mood changes induced by AMPT may be mediated by decreases in norepinephrine, while changes in selective attention and motivation may be mediated by dopamine. * Dietary depletion of the DA precursors phenylalanine and tyrosine does not result in the relapse of formerly depressed patients off their medication. * Administration of fenclonine (para-chlorophenylalanine) is able to bring about a depletion of 5-HT. The mechanism of action for this is via tryptophan hydroxylase inhibition. In the 1970s administration of parachlorophenylalanine produced a relapse in depressive symptoms of treated patients, but it is considered too toxic for use today. * Although depletion of tryptophan ‚Äî the rate-limiting factor of serotonin synthesis ‚Äî does not influence the mood of healthy volunteers and untreated patients with depression, it does produce a rapid relapse of depressive symptoms in about 50% of remitted patients who are being, or have recently been treated with serotonin selective antidepressants. =Dopaminergic= There appears to be a pattern of symptoms that are currently inadequately addressed by serotonergic antidepressants ‚Äì loss of pleasure (anhedonia), reduced motivation, loss of interest, fatigue and loss of energy, motor retardation, apathy and hypersomnia. Addition of a pro- dopaminergic component into a serotonin based therapy would be expected to address some of these short-comings. Several lines of evidence suggest that an attenuated function of the dopaminergic system may play an important role in depression: * Mood disorders are highly prevalent in pathologies characterized by a deficit in central DA transmission such as Parkinson's disease (PD). The prevalence of depression can reach up to 50% of individuals suffering from PD. * Patients taking strong dopaminergic antagonists such as those used in the treatment of psychosis are more likely than the general population to suffer from symptoms of depression. * Data from clinical studies have shown that DA agonists, such as bromocriptine, pramipexole and ropinirole, exhibit antidepressant properties. * Amineptine, a TCA-derivative that predominantly inhibits DA re-uptake and has minimal noradrenergic and serotonergic activity has also been shown to possess antidepressant activity. A number of studies have suggested that amineptine has similar efficacy to the TCAs, MAOIs and SSRIs. However, amineptine is no longer available as a treatment for depression due to reports of an abuse potential. * The B-subtype selective MAOI selegiline (a drug developed for the treatment of PD) has now been approved for the treatment of depression in the form of a transdermal patch (Emsam). For some reason, there have been numerous reports of users taking this drug in conjunction with Œ≤-phenethylamine. * Taking psychostimulants for the alleviation of depression is well proven strategy, although in a clinical setting the use of such drugs is usually prohibited because of their strong addiction propensity. * When users withdraw from psychostimulant drugs of abuse (in particular, amphetamine), they experience symptoms of depression. This is likely because the brain enters into a hypodopaminergic state, although there might be a role for noradrenaline also. For these drugs to be reinforcing, they must block more than 50% of the DAT within a relatively short time period (<15 minutes from administration) and clear the brain rapidly to enable fast repeated administration. In addition to mood, they may also improve cognitive performance, although this remains to be demonstrated in humans. The rate of clearance from the body is faster for ritalin than it is for regular amphetamine. =Noradrenergic= The decreased levels of NA proposed by Schildkraut, suggested that there would be a compensatory upregulation of Œ≤-adrenoceptors. Despite inconsistent findings supporting this, more consistent evidence demonstrates that chronic treatment with antidepressants and electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) decrease Œ≤-adrenoceptor density in the rat forebrain. This led to the theory that Œ≤-adrenoceptor downregulation was required for clinical antidepressant efficacy. However, some of the newly developed antidepressants do not alter, or even increase Œ≤-adrenoceptor density. Another adrenoceptor implicated in depression is the presynaptic Œ±2-adrenoceptor. Chronic desipramine treatment in rats decreased the sensitivity of Œ±2-adrenoceptors, a finding supported by the fact that clonidine administration caused a significant increase in growth hormone (an indirect measure of Œ±2-adrenoceptor activity) although platelet studies proved inconsistent. This supersensitivity of Œ±2-adrenoceptor was postulated to decrease locus coeruleus (the main projection site of NA in the central nervous system, CNS) NA activity leading to depression. In addition to enhancing NA release, Œ±2-adrenoceptor antagonism also increases serotonergic neurotransmission due to blockade of Œ±2-adrenoceptors present on 5-HT nerve terminals. =Serotonergic= 5-Hydroxytryptamine (5-HT or serotonin) is an important cell-to-cell signaling molecule found in all animal phyla. In mammals, substantial concentrations of 5-HT are present in the central and peripheral nervous systems, gastrointestinal tract and cardiovascular system. 5-HT is capable of exerting a wide variety of biological effects by interacting with specific membrane-bound receptors, and at least 13 distinct 5-HT receptor subtypes have been cloned and characterized. With the exception of the 5-HT3 receptor subtype, which is a transmitter-gated ion channel, 5-HT receptors are members of the 7-transmembrane G protein-coupled receptor superfamily. In humans, the serotonergic system is implicated in various physiological processes such as sleep-wake cycles, maintenance of mood, control of food intake and regulation of blood pressure. In accordance with this, drugs that affect 5-HT-containing cells or 5-HT receptors are effective treatments for numerous indications, including depression, anxiety, obesity, nausea, and migraine. Because serotonin and the related hormone melatonin are involved in promoting sleep, they counterbalance the wake-promoting action of increased catecholaminergic neurotransmission. This is accounted for by the lethargic feel that some SSRIs can produce, although TCAs and antipsychotics can also cause lethargy albeit through different mechanisms. Appetite suppression is related to 5-HT2C receptor activation as for example was reported for PAL-287 recently. Activation of the 5-HT2C receptor has been described as \\"panicogen\\" by users of ligands for this receptor (e.g., mCPP). Antagonism of the 5-HT2C receptor is known to augment dopaminergic output. Although SSRIs with 5-HT2C antagonist actions were recommended for the treatment of depression, 5-HT2C receptor agonists were suggested for treating cocaine addiction since this would be anti-addictive. Nevertheless, the 5-HT2C is known to be rapidly downregulated upon repeated administration of an agonist agent, and is actually antagonized. Azapirone-type drugs (e.g., buspirone), which act as 5-HT1A receptor agonists and partial agonists have been developed as anxiolytic agents that are not associated with the dependence and side-effect profile of the benzodiazepines. The hippocampal neurogenesis produced by various types of antidepressants, likewise, is thought to be mediated by 5-HT1A receptors. Systemic administration of a 5-HT1A agonist also induces growth hormone and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) release through actions in the hypothalamus. Current antidepressants Most antidepressants on the market today target the monoaminergic system. =SSRIs= The most commonly prescribed class of antidepressants in the USA today are the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). These drugs inhibit the uptake of the neurotransmitter 5-HT by blocking the SERT, thus increasing its synaptic concentration, and have shown to be efficacious in the treatment of depression, however sexual dysfunction and weight gain are two very common side-effects that result in discontinuation of treatment. Although many patients benefit from SSRIs, it is estimated that approximately 50% of depressive individuals do not respond adequately to these agents. Even in remitters, a relapse is often observed following drug discontinuation. The major limitation of SSRIs concerns their delay of action. It appears that the clinical efficacy of SSRIs becomes evident only after a few weeks. SSRIs can be combined with a host of other drugs including bupropion, Œ±2 adrenergic antagonists (e.g., yohimbine) as well as some of the atypical antipsychotics. The augmentation agents are said to behave synergistically with the SSRI although these are clearly of less value than taking a single compound that contains all of the necessary pharmacophoric elements relative to the consumption of a mixture of different compounds. It is not entirely known what the reason for this is, although ease of dosing is likely to be a considerable factor. In addition, single compounds are more likely to be approved by the FDA than are drugs that contain greater than one pharmaceutical ingredient (polytherapies). A number of SRIs were under development that had auxiliary interactions with other receptors. Particularly notable were agents behaving as co-joint SSRIs with additional antagonist activity at 5-HT1A receptors. 5-HT1A receptors are located presynaptically as well as post-synaptically. It is the presynaptic receptors that are believed to function as autoreceptors (cf. studies done with pindolol). These agents were shown to elicit a more robust augmentation in the % elevation of extracellular 5-HT relative to baseline than was the case for SSRIs as measured by in vivo microdialysis. =NRIs= Norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (NRIs) such as reboxetine prevent the reuptake of norepinephrine, providing a different mechanism of action to treat depression. However reboxetine is no more effective than the SSRIs in treating depression. In addition, atomoxetine has found use in the treatment of ADHD as a non- addictive alternative to Ritalin. The chemical structure of atomoxetine is closely related to that of fluoxetine (an SSRI) and also duloxetine (SNRI). =NDRIs= Bupropion is a commonly prescribed antidepressant that acts as a Norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor (NDRI). It prevents the reuptake of NA and DA (weakly) by blocking the corresponding transporters, leading to increased noradrenergic and dopaminergic neurotransmission. This drug does not cause sexual dysfunction or weight gain like the SSRIs but has a higher incidence of nausea. Methylphenidate is a much more reliable example of an NDRI (the action that it displays on the DAT usually getting preferential treatment). Methylphenidate is used in the treatment of ADHD, its use in treating depression is not known to have been reported, it is presumed owing to its psychomotor activating effects and it functioning as a positive reinforcer. There are also reports of methylphenidate being used in the treatment of psychostimulant addiction, in particular cocaine addiction, since the addictive actions of this drug are believed to be mediated by the dopamine neurotransmitter. =SNRIs= Serotonin‚Äìnorepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) such as venlafaxine (Effexor), its active metabolite desvenlafaxine (Pristiq), and duloxetine (Cymbalta) prevent the reuptake of both serotonin and norepinephrine, however their efficacy appears to be only marginally greater than the SSRIs. Sibutramine is the name of an SNRI based appetite suppressant with use in the treatment of obesity. This was explored in the treatment of depression, but was shown not to be effective. Both sibutramine and venlafaxine are phenethylamine-based. At high doses, both venlafaxine and sibutramine will start producing dopaminergic effects. The inhibition of DA reuptake is unlikely to be relevant at clinically approved doses. =MAOIs= Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) were the first antidepressants to be introduced. They were discovered entirely by serendipity. Iproniazide (the first MAOI) was originally developed as an antitubercular agent but was then unexpectedly found to display antidepressant activity. Isoniazid also displayed activity as an antidepressant, even though it is not a MAOI. This led some people to question whether it is some property of the hydrazine, which is responsible for mediating the antidepressant effect, even going as far as to state that the MAOI activity could be a secondary side-effect. However, with the discovery of tranylcypromine (the first non-hydrazine MAOI), it was shown that MAOI is thought to underlie the antidepressant bioactivity of these agents. Etryptamine is another example of a non-hydrazine MAOI that was introduced. The MAOIs work by inhibiting the monoamine oxidase enzymes that, as the name suggests, break down the monoamine neurotransmitters. This leads to increased concentrations of most of the monoamine neurotransmitters in the human brain, serotonin, norepinephrine, dopamine and melatonin. The fact that they are more efficacious than the newer generation antidepressants is what leads scientists to develop newer antidepressants that target a greater range of neurotransmitters. The problem with MAOIs is that they have many potentially dangerous side-effects such as hypotension, and there is a risk of food and drug interactions that can result in potentially fatal serotonin syndrome or a hypertensive crisis. Although selective MAOIs can reduce, if not eliminate these risks, their efficacy tends to be lower. MAOIs may preferentially treat TCA-resistant depression, especially in patients with features such as fatigue, volition inhibition, motor retardation and hypersomnia. This may be a function of the ability of MAOIs to increase synaptic levels of DA in addition to 5-HT and NE. The MAOIs also seem to be effective in the treatment of fatigue associated with fibromyalgia (FM) or chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS). Although a substantial number of MAOIs were approved in the 1960s, many of these were taken off the market as rapidly as they were introduced. The reason for this is that they were hepatotoxic and could cause jaundice. =TCAs= The first tricyclic antidepressant (TCA), imipramine (Tofranil), was derived from the antipsychotic drug chlorpromazine, which was developed as a useful antihistaminergic agent with possible use as a hypnotic sedative. Imipramine is an iminodibenzyl (dibenzazepine). The TCAs such as imipramine and amitriptyline typically prevent the reuptake of serotonin or norepinephine. It is the histaminiergic (H1), muscarinic acetylcholinergic (M1), and alpha adrenergic (Œ±1) blockade that is responsible for the side-effects of TCAs. These include somnolence and lethargy, anticholinergic side-effects, and hypotension. Due to the narrow gap between their ability to block the biogenic amine uptake pumps versus the inhibition of fast sodium channels, even a modest overdose of one of the TCAs could be lethal. TCAs were, for 25 years, the leading cause of death from overdoses in many countries. Patients being treated with antidepressants are prone to attempt suicide and one method they use is to take an overdose of their medications. Another example of a TCA is amineptine which is the only one believed to function as a DRI. It is no longer available. Failure of SNDRIs for depression SNDRIs have been under investigation for the treatment of major depressive disorder for a number of years but, as of 2015, have failed to meet effectiveness expectations in clinical trials. In addition, the augmentation of a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) or serotonin- norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor with lisdexamfetamine, a norepinephrine- dopamine releasing agent, recently failed to separate from placebo in phase III clinical trials of individuals with treatment-resistant depression, and clinical development was subsequently discontinued. These occurrences have shed doubt on the potential benefit of dopaminergic augmentation of conventional serotonergic and noradrenergic antidepressant therapy. As such, skepticism has been cast on the promise of the remaining SNDRIs that are still being trialed, such as ansofaxine (currently in phase I trials), in the treatment of depression.

In 2007, researchers found 34 bone fragments belonging to a single individual at the Tianyuan Cave near Beijing, China. Radiocarbon dating shows the bones to be between 42,000 and 39,000 years old, which may be slightly younger than the only other finds of bones of a similar age at the Niah Caves in Sarawak on Borneo. Isotope analysis suggests that a substantial part of the diet of these individuals came from freshwater fish. Tianyuan man is considered an early modern human. It lacks several mandibular features common among western Eurasian late archaic humans, showing its divergence. Based on the rate of dental occlusal attrition, it is estimated he died in his 40s or 50s. DNA tests published in 2013 revealed that Tianyuan man is related \\"to many present-day Asians and Native Americans\\". He had also clearly diverged genetically from the ancestors of modern Europeans. He belonged to mitochondrial DNA haplogroup B. Tianyuan man exhibits a unique genetic affinity for GoyetQ116-1 from Goyet Caves that is not found in any other ancient individual from West Eurasia. He shares more alleles with today's people from the Surui and Karitiana tribes in Brazil than other Native American populations, suggesting a population related to Tianyuan man was once widespread in eastern Asia. His Y haplogroup was K2b.

The broad central parts of continents are called cratons, and are subject to epeirogeny. The movement may be one of subsidence toward, or of uplift from, the centre of the Earth. The movement is caused by a set of forces acting along an Earth radius, such as those contributing to isostasy and faulting in the lithosphere. Epeirogenic movement can be permanent or transient. Transient uplift can occur over a thermal anomaly due to convecting anomalously hot mantle, and disappears when convection wanes. Permanent uplift can occur when igneous material is injected into the crust, and circular or elliptical structural uplift (that is, without folding) over a large radius (tens to thousands of km) is one characteristic of a mantle plume. In contrast to epeirogenic movement, orogenic movement is a more complicated deformation of the Earth's crust, associated with crustal thickening, notably associated with the convergence of tectonic plates. Such plate convergence forms orogenic belts that are characterized by \\"the folding and faulting of layers of rock, by the intrusion of magma, and by volcanism\\". Epeirogenic movements may divert rivers and create drainage divides by upwarping of the crust along axes. Example of this is the deflection of Eridanos River in the Pliocene Epoch by the uplift of the South Swedish Dome or the present-day drainage divides between Limpopo and Zambezi rivers in southern Africa. Examples Epeirogenic movement has caused the southern Rocky Mountain region to be uplifted from 1300 to 2000 m since the Eocene. This followed and is distinct from the creation of the Rocky Mountains during the Laramide Orogeny during the Late Cretaceous‚Äìearly Cenozoic. The uplift is interpreted as due to lithospheric heating resulting from thinning and the intrusion of widespread middle Tertiary batholiths of relatively low density.Eaton, Gordon P., Epeirogeny in the Southern Rocky Mountains region: Evidence and origin, Geosphere; October 2008; v. 4; no. 5; p. 764‚Äì784; The South Swedish Dome has been uplifted and subsided multiple times by epeirogenic movements since the Cambrian leading to the uplift, tilting and partial erosion of the Sub-Cambrian peneplain. The doming has resulted in the formation of a piedmonttreppen relief in southern Sweden.

During her career, she sang at most of the world's important opera houses, including performances throughout Europe, North and South America. She forged important long-term artistic partnerships with two opera houses during her career: the National Theatre in Belgrade and the Vienna State Opera. Biography Bakoƒçeviƒá was born in Guƒça, Luƒçani, Kingdom of Yugoslavia. She studied singing at the Academy of Music in Belgrade (now the University of Arts) with Nikola Cvejiƒá and then continued further studies at the school for young opera singers at La Scala. She made her professional opera debut in 1955 at the National Theatre in Belgrade as Mimi in Giacomo Puccini's La Boh√®me. Earning rave reviews, she became a regular performer at that opera house. In 1958 Bakoƒçeviƒá earned Second Prize at the Belgrade International Competition of Young Artists. In 1962 she won the Geneva International Singing Competition and in 1964 she won the L√ºttich International Singing Competition. These competition wins brought her to the attention of the international opera community and she was soon engaged to perform in the world's leading opera houses. In 1967 Bakoƒçeviƒá made her debut at the Teatro Lirico Giuseppe Verdi in Triest the Olga in Nikolai Rimsky- Korsakov's The Maid of Pskov. That same year she joined the roster at the Vienna State Opera where she sang regularly through 1982 in such roles as Minnie in Puccini's La fanciulla del West, Elisabetta in Giuseppe Verdi's Don Carlos and Maddalena in Umberto Giordano's Andrea Ch√©nier among many others. She made her San Francisco Opera debut on October 15, 1968 as Leonora in Il trovatore. She joined the Metropolitan Opera in New York City for the 1968-1969 season, singing there Cio-Cio-San in Madama Butterfly, Leonora, Marguerite in Faust, Micaela in Carmen and Mim√¨. In 1969 she made her first appearance at the Deutsche Oper Berlin as Maria in Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky's Mazeppa. In 1972, Bakoƒçeviƒá made her first appearance in Paris at the Palais Garnier as Norma. She returned many times to Paris during the 1970s, performing in all of the major houses in that city. In 1973 she made her debut with the Philadelphia Lyric Opera Company as Amelia in Un ballo in maschera with Pl√°cido Domingo and Bernab√© Mart√≠ alternating as Riccardo, Cornell MacNeil as Renato, Lili Chookasian as Ulrica and Patricia Wise as Oscar. Her last opera performance was in 1982 in the title role of Puccini's Turandot at the Deutsche Oper am Rhein, a role she repeated in Dublin in December 1986. Bakoƒçeviƒá's many other appearances between 1965 and 1982 included performances at the Bavarian State Opera, the Bolshoi Theatre, the Grand Th√©√¢tre de Bordeaux, the Grand Th√©√¢tre de Gen√®ve, the Hamburg State Opera, the Hungarian National Opera, La Fenice, the Liceu, the Op√©ra National de Paris, the Palacio de Bellas Artes, the Polish National Opera, the Romanian National Opera, Bucharest, the Teatro Col√≥n, the Teatro Comunale Florence, the Teatro dell'Opera di Roma, the Teatro di San Carlo, the Teatro Massimo, the Teatro Nacional de S√£o Carlos, the Teatro Regio di Parma, and the Teatro Regio di Torino to name just a few. A spinto soprano, Bakoƒçeviƒá sang a wide repertoire that encompassed works from the 17th through the 20th century. She particularly excelled in portraying Puccini and Verdi heroines and was also admired for a handful of roles in operas by Strauss and Wagner. She also sang in a number of Russian and Czech operas by composers like Rimsky-Korsakov, Smetana, and Tchaikovsky. She sang three roles in French; Giulietta in Jacques Offenbach's Les Contes d'Hoffmann, Marguerite in Charles Gounod's Faust and Micaela in Georges Bizet's Carmen. She did, however, possess a flexible enough voice to tackle several bel canto roles by Bellini and Donizetti. Since retiring from the stage, Bakoƒçeviƒá works as a professor of singing at several universities. Currently, she is a member of the voice faculty at the University of Arts in Belgrade where she also served as the university's Rector from 1998 to 2000. She is also a member of the Association of Musical Artists of Serbia.

Professional career  Yolchiyeva was born in 1960 in the Fergh√¢na valley near Tashkent, and from an early age it was obvious she had a great gift as a singer. This nearly resulted in her being channelled into a career as an opera singer, but she was inexorably drawn towards the slow, aching music of her own ancient culture, something that seemed almost pre-ordained by her name, which means 'ascent to God' or simply 'prayer'. She is frequently accompanied by her mentor, the famous rubab player, Shawqat Mirzaev . Her repertoire includes many of his compositions, and she usually performs with his ensemble. Typically the group use local instruments such as the dutar (two stringed lute), the tanbur (3-stinged lute), a gidjak spike fiddle, doira frame drum, ney flute and at times the chang zither. Those lucky enough to attend one of her rare concerts abroad will witness a sumptuously dressed performer of startling gravitas and charisma, with long pigtails trailing down to her waist.

Lee and Mary Anna Randolph Custis, and the sixth of their seven children. He became a soldier during the American Civil War, and later was a planter, businessman, and author. Early life Rob Lee was born and raised at Arlington House across the Potomac River from Washington, D.C. He was close to his father, who he was named after, and his sister, Mildred Lee. He attended boarding schools during much of the 1850s, while his father, a career U.S. Army officer, was serving in the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War and as Superintendent of the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York. Unlike his father and two older brothers, Rob apparently never envisioned a military career, never serving in the United States Army. In 1860, he enrolled at the University of Virginia. Civil War When the American Civil War broke out in 1861, his father and his two older brothers, Custis and Rooney, all chose to serve Virginia in the Confederate Army. To his mother's dismay, Rob joined them in 1862, enlisting in the Rockbridge Artillery as a private. During the Battle of Sharpsburg in September 1862, young Robert watched his father ride up to his artillery battery, which had already been heavily engaged. Junior stood by expecting to hear a few words of affection from his father, but Lee did not recognize his own son, hidden by the grime of black powder on his face. When Junior finally spoke up to ask if they would be thrown back into the fight, the general recognized him by his voice. \\"Yes, my son. You must do what you can to drive those people back,\\" Lee said.Johnson, Clint.

After the war, Lee lived and farmed Romancoke Plantation on the north bank of the Pamunkey River in King William County, which he inherited from his maternal grandfather George Washington Parke Custis. Romancoke was located approximately four miles from the Town of West Point. Lee also became a writer, gathering his memories of his family and life in Recollections and Letters of General Robert E. Lee (1904). The first-hand account provides a valuable source of information on day-to-day life at Arlington House during his youth, and includes many items of interest regarding his father's entire life. Robert E. Lee Jr. died in 1914. He was interred with his parents and siblings in the Lee Chapel in Lexington, Virginia, where his father and brother Custis each had served as a president of the college now known as Washington and Lee University. Marriage and family Rob married twice. On November 16, 1871, he married Charlotte Haxall (October 23, 1848 ‚Äì September 22, 1872). No children survived her. On March 8, 1894, in Washington D.C., Rob Lee married Juliet Carter (April 6, 1860 ‚Äì November 17, 1915), who was 16 years younger than he. They had two daughters, Anne Carter Lee (b. July 21, 1897) and Mary Custis Lee (b. December 23, 1900). Lee's mother, Mary Anna Randolph Custis Lee, was the only surviving child of George Washington Parke Custis and Mary Lee Fitzhugh.

Having an effective school system does not just come from the curriculum, it strives in many ways from every aspect of the school itself. The staff and families are also extremely important in student success. The purpose of Comprehensive School Reform is \\"to provide financial incentives for schools to develop comprehensive school reforms, based upon scientifically based research and effective practices that include an emphasis on basic academics and parental involvement so that all children can meet challenging state academic content and academic achievement standards.\\"No Child Left Behind Act of 2001, Sec. 1601 The CSR program made its last award in 2005, although it continued to appropriate funds to one school in 2006-2008.Archived: Funding Status - Comprehensive School Reform Program Elements of Comprehensive School Reform A successful reform program is one that includes all of these elements in a cohesive way. See more in Comprehensive School Reform. Coordination of resources This is how the program will bring together the aspects of a school, from local to federal levels. Effective research methods and strategies Comprehensive school reform takes action based upon strategies and methods that have been proven to work through research and reliability. Alignment The methodology imposed works through the community, into homes, and also straight up to our government. This technique is significant as it provides a connection to all things from curriculum to technology. Development Ensuring that the staff, and those who have high influence in the school systems are properly educated and updated on these programs is essential. Measurable goals As the state has set standards, regularly students will be checked to see if they have reached the benchmarks that they should have in order to achieve the goal. School support All associated within the school should be supportive, such as staff, faculty and administrators. Involvement Including the community in the school is very important as the classroom should carry on outside of the room itself. Families are encouraged to be involved, and communities are encouraged to take part in activities. External support Usually there is a higher support system, for example a university, that provides support and expertise in how to improve. Evolution There must always be room for growth and change, and each program should be set with the intent to evolve as time progresses. Comprehensive School Reform Demonstration In order to begin the school- wide reform, in 1977 Congress implemented the Comprehensive School Reform Demonstration which reached out to schools that had at least 50 percent student disadvantage and gave them the opportunity to improve to receive program grants. Some of the elements that the CSRD provided were: Professional development for teachers and staff; Greater parental and community involvement in school improvement activities; Identification of resources to sustain the reform effort; measurable goals for student achievement; and annual evaluation of both implementation and student-achievement results. No Child Left Behind Act The four pillars of this bill include accountability, flexibility, research-based evidence, and parental options. This bill also requires each state to have standards, and perform state testing under federal requirements. Models Success for all Created in 1987, this reading intensive curriculum has been adopted by about 1,500 schools. ‚ÄúThe SFA model also includes assessment every eight weeks, cooperative-learning activities among students, tutoring for those in need of extra help, and a family-support team that works to increase parental involvement.‚Äù This model has also been proven to help students read at an above average rate, at younger ages. Direct Institution This was developed in 1968 helps in many ways. This model consists of, ‚Äúfield- tested reading, language arts, and math curricula, scripted instructional strategies, extensive training, and schoolwide analysis of student performance data‚Äù. Through research this model has been proven to increase both vocabulary and oral readings. Implementation While there are several other programs, these two in particular have been seen to work well. Success for All has been implemented in schools in 48 states and 4 other countries (SFAF) and Direct Instruction has been implemented in schools in 22 states, Guam, and Australia. Success with these programs can mostly be seen in elementary and younger grade schools. New American Schools A non profit organization that develops models to be implemented by low performing schools. Their ideas are comprehensive of the whole school system, therefore, rather than raising up just one educator, all educators come together to create a stronger school unit. (philanthropynewsdigest) Current Programs Through the Education Performance Network, there are two sets of services, 1. State and District Services, and 2. New School Services. Together they apply 4 basic components: needs assessment, strategic planning, implementation assistance, and quality assurance and feedback.

Following the 1986 NFL season, Johnson was traded to the San Diego Chargers. He was routinely late to practice as a result of his blossoming crack cocaine addiction and was subsequently cut two weeks later. In 1989, after years of homelessness and addiction, Johnson sold his Super Bowl XXI ring at a pawn shop in Nashville, TN for $250. Johnson has been clean since 2002. In 2016, Lee Einsidler, a sports fan, led the charge to reunite Johnson with his ring.

Team history Amarillo's first minor league club, the Gassers, appeared in 1923. While the minor leagues weathered the economic troubles of the Great Depression, Amarillo was frequently unrepresented in professional baseball. But in 1939, Amarillo joined the WT-NM League as the Gold Sox when the loop expanded from six to eight clubs. The Gold Sox played in the league until the circuit suspended operations due to World War II on July 5, 1942. In 1946, the postwar West Texas‚ÄìNew Mexico League was reborn as a Class C league and the Gold Sox returned to the field. In 1948, led by skipper Buck \\"Leaky\\" Fausett, the team won its first league playoff title. (It would win the playoffs again in 1952.) In 1953, Alvin Lakind played for the team and batted .300; his grandson Jared Lakind went on to play minor league baseball 60 years later.\\"Lakind named Sun Baseball Player of the Year\\" - Houston Chronicle\\"Alvin Lakind Register Statistics & History\\"  Baseball-Reference.com In 1955, Amarillo won the regular-season pennant and led the WT-NML in attendance, but it was a Pyrrhic victory, as the league folded for good at the close of the season. The Gold Sox, however, remained alive by moving up to the Western League as an unaffiliated club. It enjoyed success on the field, winning the 1956 regular- season title, and at the gate, leading the league in attendance in its final season, 1958. In 1959, the Texas League admitted Amarillo as a farm system affiliate of the Baltimore Orioles. From 1960‚Äì1962, the Gold Sox were the Double-A farm club of the New York Yankees, winning the 1961 regular-season title. In 1963, the Chicago Cubs were the Gold Sox' parent team. But the Gold Sox disappeared from the baseball map when the 1964 Texas League contracted, and when Amarillo returned to the TL in 1965, it was known as the Sonics from 1965‚Äì1967 and the Giants from 1968‚Äì1974. In 1975, the franchise moved to Lafayette, Louisiana, te become the Lafayette Drillers and Amarillo was again left out of the Texas League. But after only one season without professional baseball, in 1976, the Amarillo Gold Sox returned to the circuit, as the San Diego Padres moved their Double-A farm club from Alexandria, Louisiana. In their first season back in the Texas League under their old nickname, the Gold Sox won the West Division title and playoff championship, but a series of last-place teams and only one other division title followed through 1982. The Gold Sox moved to Beaumont, Texas prior to the 1983 season and became the Beaumont Golden Gators. In 1981 the Gold Sox roster included future major leaguers Tony Gwynn, Mark Thurmond, Andy Hawkins and Dave Dravecky. In 2009, an Amarillo age 7 and under select baseball team affiliated with the YMCA paid homage to the former team by continuing the Gold Sox name.

Uses This essential water has traditionally been used as an aromatizer in many Mediterranean traditional dessert dishes, such as in France for the gibassier and pompe √† l'huile or in Spain for the Rosc√≥n de Reyes (King cake), or the Samsa in Tunisia or in Moroccan coffee, but has more recently found its way into other cuisines. For example, orange flower water is used in Europe to flavor madeleines, in Mexico to flavor little wedding cakes and Pan de muerto, and in the United States to make orange blossom scones and marshmallows. Orange flower water is also used as an ingredient in some cocktails, such as the Ramos Gin Fizz. In Malta and many North African as well as Middle Eastern countries, orange blossom water is widely used as medicine for stomach ache and given to small children as well as adults.Taste of Beirut. Accad, Joumana. Orange flower water has been a traditional ingredient used often in North African as well as in Middle Eastern cooking. In Arab variants of baklava, orange blossom water is often mixed with the sweet syrup for flavor. Orange blossoms are believed to be used in this manner because they are seen as the traditional bridal flower and, therefore, symbolize purity (white, small and delicate). It is also added to plain water in the Middle East to mask high mineral content and other unpleasant flavors (for example, those arising from storage in a qulla, a type of clay jug that keeps water cool in a manner similar to the zeer); some add the fragrance irrespective of the taste of the plain water. By country and region In Greece and Cyprus orange blossom water is called anthonero (Œ±ŒΩŒ∏œåŒΩŒµœÅŒø) while in Malta it is known as Ilma ≈ªahar. In the Levant, orange blossom water is known as May Zahr, in Morocco Ilma Zhar and in Algeria and Tunisia Ma Zhar, in the North African dialects meaning \\"orange blossom water\\",zhar, in standard Arabic blossoms, means specifically orange blossoms in the Maghreb. See Harrell, Richard S.: Dictionary of Moroccan Arabic (Washington DC: Georgetown University Press) in contrast to May Ward or Ilma Ward, which is rose blossom water. Orange blossom water serves two purposes in the Maghreb: one usage is as a perfume or freshener, usually given to guests to wash their hands upon entering the host house or before drinking tea. It is put in a special silver or metal container, recognizable in the typical Maghrebi tea set. However, this old custom is fading away in the present day. The second usage of orange blossom water, however, is in Algerian cuisine, Tunisian cuisine, and Moroccan cuisine, especially as an ingredient for traditional sweets and sometimes to aromatize drinks such as coffee.

Cooney. The series focuses on a young woman's attempts to discover the truth about her background after seeing her own image on a milk carton.  Series  =The Face on the Milk Carton= While at lunch one day, Janie grabs a friend's milk carton which changes her life. She noticed the \\"missing person\\" photo on the back of the milk carton; it happens to be herself when she was very young. The milk carton says that Jennie Spring was kidnapped when she was three years old. Janie believes the carton must be some type of joke because her parents are very loving parents. Janie tries to put it out of her mind, but she begins having flashbacks of events and people that don't fit in with her life. =Whatever Happened to Janie?= Janie is forced to leave the home of her adoptive parents and live with her biological family. Although all of the Spring family is eager to include her, she desperately misses her adoptive parents, so she is emotionally aloof. She also has some trouble adjusting. She goes to a new school and lives in very close quarters with her new brothers and sister. As things start to improve and Janie starts to feel more at home, though, they experience a setback when the FBI shows up. Janie ends up returning to her old family. =The Voice on the Radio= Reeve Shields is in college, and Janie is very anxious to finish high school so she can go to college with him. One day, Reeve gets a spot on the local college radio. Embarrassed at having nothing to talk about because he doesn't know a subject, Reeve begins discussing the story of Janie's kidnapping, meeting her new family, and returning to her adoptive parents. However, when Janie decides to visit Reeve in Boston (where his college is) with her brother and sister, she hears one of his college broadcasts. That same night, Reeve receives a call in from a woman claiming to be Hannah, but Reeve disconnects her before she can say much else. After that call, Reeve receives a call from Brian, asking him to come to the hotel room. There, the three confront Reeve, furious at him for selling them out on the radio. Janie breaks up with Reeve, refusing to speak to him again. The rest of the novel deals with Reeve's efforts to talk to Janie, though she continuously refuses because he sold her out on the air along with her biological and adoptive families. When Pammy and Cordell suggest that he forgets about her and focus on getting a career as a professional radio disc jockey, Reeve is forced to return home to seek his parents' advice on what to do. When visiting her biological mother in New Jersey, Janie breaks down crying, and tells her everything. Mrs. Spring suggests that, though it might be difficult, Janie should forgive Reeve. When Reeve visits his family for Thanksgiving break, Janie holds out her hand and asks to talk to Reeve, and he reaches for it. Before the end of the novel, it is revealed that Hannah died many years ago in California, though by the fourth novel, it was revealed that this was not true. =What Janie Found= Frank Johnson has had a heart attack and stroke and Janie is asked by the distraught Miranda to help with the bills. Janie finds a folder marked 'H.J' in her father's files and wants to read it by herself, but her brother Brian and Reeve want to be included. They find out that Frank had been sending money to his supposedly dead daughter Hannah. They find an address, where Hannah may be living in Boulder, Colorado. Janie's older brother Stephen is currently going to college in Boulder so the three decide to go visit Stephen, all making up their own reasons to visit the area. While they are there, Brian and Reeve decide finding Hannah is a bad idea. Janie takes the longest to convince but eventually after she has a talk with Stephen she decides it would be best not to find Hannah, as it would be too painful for everyone. Janie mails Hannah the rest of the money and tells her to break off contact with the Johnson family. Meanwhile, Janie and Reeve repair their romantic relationship and Brian becomes much closer with Janie and her adoptive parents. =Janie Face To Face= By this time Janie is going to college under her legal name, Jennie Spring, though she prefers to remain Janie to her friends and acquaintances. She chooses a school away from both her families, in New York. She decides to move on from Reeve, her old boyfriend, and date someone else, only to find out he was a creep who was betraying her. She goes back to Reeve, who proposes marriage, and she accepts. Meanwhile, Hannah, the kidnapper, wants revenge: the girl she kidnapped was having a better life than the one she was living herself. Hannah doesn't know whether or not she should ruin the best day of Janie's life, her wedding to Reeve, or attack her parents, the ones who \\"ruined her life.\\" At the same time, a writer is trying to gather information on Janie and her family for his book by sending several assistants to meet Janie and her family and friends (including the creepy guy who tried to \\"date\\" her). Everyone is told to ignore the writer, but Brendan, Janie's brother, meets with one of the writer's assistants, only to find out the man who was supposedly the author of the book didn't even know about the book himself. The book also contains interludes describing the reasons why Hannah did what she did and how she lived between turning over Jennie to her parents and the present day. Hannah ultimately decides to ransack her parents' home during Jennie's wedding to Reeve (at which both sets of parents are present), and when Jennie is alerted, she immediately calls the police and Hannah is arrested at last. With this, Jennie permanently abandons her 'Janie' identity. Adaptations In 1995, The Face on the Milk Carton was combined with Whatever Happened to Janie? and made into a for-television film called The Face on the Milk Carton, distributed by Fox Family (now Freeform), directed by Waris Hussein and starring Kellie Martin.

At one point of time it was counted among the few biggest cities of Oudh, but declined rapidly in later period and now reduced to a town.  History Shahabad is a city and a municipal board in Hardoi district in the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh. At one point of time it was counted among the few biggest cities of Oudh, but declined rapidly in later period and now reduced to a town. It is the site of the Tomb of Diler Khan, a governor in the time of Shah Jahan and Aurangzeb. The town of Shahabad has many references in history sources. It was founded in 1680 A.D. by Nawab Diler Khan, an Afghan officer of Shah Jahan, who was sent to suppress an uprising in Shahjahanpur. The same man overthrew Pande Parwar bandits of Angni Khera. Joseph Tiefenthaler, one of the earliest European geographers to write on India, visited the town in 1770 and described it as a town of considerable circuit, with a palace of bricks in the middle strengthened by towers like a fortress, with a vestibule and a covered colonnade. This palace used to be known as Badi Deorhi. Although the palace no longer exists, the two grand gateways are still standing. Nawab Diler Khan also erected Jama Masjid and his own mausoleum. Both of them are built in kankar blocks and the upper story contains bands of florid decoration in red stone, a style very common to architecture of that period. He also built a grand pond near the mausoleum, known as Narbada. In colonial period the city declined rapidly. In 1824, Reginald Heber, Bishop of Calcutta traveled to Shahabad and described it as a \\"considerable town or almost city with the remains of fortifications and many large houses.\\"Nevill, H.R. ed., Hardoi - A Gazetteer, 1904, Govt. Press United Provinces, pp. 266-274 The descendants of Nawab Diler Khan Daudzai also moved to a nearby area which under the zamindari and named this place as Wazirabad which is now known as village HARRAI, comes under Tehsil Shahbad, District Hardoi.

His independence of mind as a politician gave rise to the somewhat misleading nickname \\"Slippery Sam\\".Ball, F. Elrington The Judges in Ireland 1221-1921 John Murray London 1926 Vol. II p.168 He was the second son of Sir Simon Bradstreet, 1st Baronet of Kilmainham, Dublin and his wife and first cousin Ellen Bradstreet, daughter of Samuel Bradstreet of Gowran, County Kilkenny and Elizabeth Agar. In 1773, Samuel succeeded his older brother Simon as third baronet. He was educated at Trinity College, Dublin and was then called to the Bar by the Middle Temple in 1758, becoming King's Counsel in 1767 In 1766, he became Recorder of Dublin. Bradstreet entered the Irish House of Commons as Member of Parliament (MP) for Dublin City in 1776, representing the constituency until 1784, when he was appointed Fourth Justice at the Court of King's Bench (Ireland). Ironically, like several of his colleagues, Bradstreet as a politician had opposed increasing the number of High Court judges: Elrington Ball remarked cynically that an increase in the salary and a guarantee of security of tenure soon convinced him of the error of his ways. Unlike most of his colleagues, he was able to work harmoniously with his Chief Justice, John Scott, 1st Earl of Clonmell, who called him \\"my assistant\\".Ball p.168 He was a good and frequent speaker in Parliament: though loosely associated with the Irish Patriot Party he clashed on occasion with Henry Grattan, and claimed that the liberties granted by the Constitution of 1782 were insufficient. He prided himself on independence of mind; according to Ball his nickname \\"Slippery Sam\\" did not mean that he was corrupt or untrustworthy but rather that no party could ever count on his support. He was described as firm and decisive in character, rough in manner, and enormously fat (Chief Justice Scott, who was himself rather heavy, flippantly called him \\"the double man\\"). On 19 January 1771, he married Elizabeth Tully, daughter of Dr. James Tully, a Dublin physician, and his wife Bridget Netterville, a distant cousin of Viscount Netterville, and had by her four sons. Bradstreet died at his home in Booterstown in County Dublin. He was succeeded in the baronetcy by his oldest son Simon. His widow died in 1799.

It aired on May 2, 2007. The episode was written by Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse and directed by Eric Laneuville. The character of John Locke (Terry O'Quinn) is featured in the episode's flashbacks, focusing on his time with The Others. Plot =Flashbacks= Flashbacks show the past eight days from Locke's perspective. Locke asks Ben and Tom why his father, Anthony Cooper (Kevin Tighe), is on the island and, when he ungags him, Cooper viciously bites him. As they leave, Ben invites Locke to join them as they prepare to abandon their living quarters, and Locke accepts. A few days later, Locke and the rest of the Others set up camp in a clearing in the middle of the jungle. As Locke helps Cindy Chandler (Kimberley Joseph) put up her tent, she tells him that the Others are excited that he's here with them. Ben summons Locke that night and tells him that he must kill Cooper in order to become one of them. The Others have gathered to watch, but Locke is unable to kill Cooper, despite his father's contemptuous taunting of him. The next morning, while Locke is on a hillside overlooking the camp, Richard Alpert (Nestor Carbonell) joins him. He explains that Ben knew he wouldn't be able to kill Cooper and wanted to embarrass him. He tells Locke that if he won't kill his father, then someone else should: Sawyer. The next day, Locke wakes to find that the Others have packed up and are ready to move on. Ben tells him they will leave a trail for him, that he must stay behind with Cooper and \\"clean up his mess\\", and that if he doesn't bring his father's body with him, then not to bother following. =In the Jungle/In the Black Rock= Kate Austen (Evangeline Lilly) wakes up during the night next to James \\"Sawyer\\" Ford (Josh Holloway), she explains she can only sleep in her own tent. She kisses him goodnight and leaves. Sawyer slips a handgun into his waistband and steps outside to urinate. He briefly converses with Hugo \\"Hurley\\" Reyes (Jorge Garcia) and Jin-Soo Kwon (Daniel Dae Kim), who are standing outside a tent. Inside the jungle, Sawyer is confronted by Locke, who has been gone for a week. Locke tells him that he has infiltrated the Others' camp and has taken their leader, Ben Linus (Michael Emerson), hostage, and needs Sawyer to kill him. Sawyer questions why Locke would come to him, and Locke explains that, thanks to the files the Others have on all of the Flight 815 survivors, he knows that Sawyer killed a man (Jeff Perry) in Sydney (this scene was shown in an episode from season one). Locke turns and leaves, and Sawyer reluctantly follows, barefooted. As Locke and Sawyer trek through the jungle, Locke proceeds to reel off certain points of Sawyer's life, provoking Sawyer to attack him and threaten him with a knife. Locke admits that he cannot bring himself to kill Ben, whereas Sawyer reveals that he killed the wrong person by mistake and he didn't mean to kill the man he killed. Locke leads Sawyer to the Black Rock, the derelict slave ship seen in a previous episode, taking him inside to the brig where a man sits chained, gagged and hooded. Locke locks Sawyer in the brig with the prisoner, ignoring Sawyer's enraged pleas to unlock the door. Danielle Rousseau (Mira Furlan) enters the Black Rock and is surprised to see Locke. She explains she is looking for dynamite. Locke does not give an explanation for his presence or for Sawyer's banging on the door, but he does point her to the dynamite; she takes a crate and leaves. In the brig, Sawyer threatens to shoot Locke through the door if he won't open it, but Locke tells him that if his gun had bullets he would have threatened him with it, and not a knife, in the jungle. An angered Sawyer removes the prisoner's hood and is startled to see it is not Ben, but in fact Anthony Cooper, John's father. Both are equally confused, but Cooper explains that he was involved in a car collision and the last thing he remembers is being lifted into the ambulance as the paramedics placed an I.V. needle in him. In accordance with what island newcomer Naomi claims, Cooper comments that Oceanic Flight 815 crashed in the middle of the ocean killing all those onboard, meaning that Locke is supposed to be dead; Cooper has surmised that he is in Hell given that he is now seeing his supposedly dead son. Cooper explains to Sawyer that he is Locke's father, and that he conned Locke out of a kidney and pushed him out an eighth story window because he was a \\"nuisance\\". Suspicious, Sawyer asks the prisoner for his name. Cooper tells him a con man has many names, and begins to list his, including Tom Sawyer. Upon questioning by Sawyer, Cooper reveals that he has been to Jasper, Alabama (apparently Sawyer's home town). Sawyer realizes Cooper is the \\"Sawyer\\" that he has been seeking all his life; Cooper is the man who conned Sawyer's mother out of her life savings, which caused Sawyer's father to kill Sawyer's mother before committing suicide. Sawyer orders Cooper to read the letter he wrote as a young boy; after reading the beginning, Cooper admits he took Sawyer's mother's money out of her own request, and tries to convince Sawyer that it is completely Sawyer's dad's fault for what he did to Sawyer's mother and himself. Enraged, Sawyer demands Cooper finish reading, but he tears the letter to pieces. Sawyer then chokes Cooper to death with his chains. Locke frees Sawyer, who vomits outside. Locke tells him that Juliet is a spy for the Others who know Sun is pregnant, and are planning to raid the camp in 3 days; Locke gives him her tape recorder as proof to present to the other survivors. He tells Sawyer he is not returning with him, because he is on his own journey now. Sawyer asks Locke if his father threw him out of a window and if John was a cripple. John answers \\"Not anymore\\". As the episode ends, Locke throws over his shoulder a sack with his father inside and heads into the jungle. =On the Beach= Charlie Pace (Dominic Monaghan) encounters Jack Shephard (Matthew Fox) when he goes into the kitchen tent to collect food for Naomi Dorrit (Marsha Thomason), whose presence in the camp remains unknown to all except Charlie, Hurley, Jin and Desmond Hume (Henry Ian Cusick). Charlie explains that the camping trip with Desmond, Jin and Hurley was \\"male bonding\\". Jack tells Charlie that if they plan another one to count him in. Back in the tent, Jin gives Naomi the food while Desmond questions whether Jack's loyalties lie with the survivors or with the Others, namely Juliet Burke (Elizabeth Mitchell). Because Naomi still needs medical attention, the four men decide to let Sayid Jarrah (Naveen Andrews) in on their secret. On the beach, Sayid tells Charlie he admires his decision not to tell Jack about Naomi. Sayid questions Naomi. She explains that Penny Widmore (Sonya Walger) hired her to search for Desmond, though she has not met her. She also repeats that the wreckage of Flight 815 was found off the shore of Bali, four miles underwater, and ROVs revealed that all passengers on board were dead. While searching for Desmond, she received coordinates which took her to the middle of the ocean. However, on her return to the search vessel, the island mysteriously appeared out of cloud cover, and her helicopter lost power as she managed to bail out. Sayid doubts her story and asks for the whereabouts of her helicopter. Naomi, apparently offended, gives Sayid her satellite phone and quips that she will not rescue him. Back on the beach, Sayid and Hurley try to fix Naomi's radio. Sayid says the technology is more advanced than any he has ever seen. He manages to fix it but the signal is blocked. The noise of the static attracts a curious Kate. At first, Sayid is reluctant, but seeing no other choice, he tells Kate about Naomi, and asks her not to tell Jack. Kate, however, goes straight to Jack who is sitting with Juliet on the beach. She asks to speak privately to him but he says that whatever she has to say can be said in front of Juliet. Kate tells them about Naomi and that he wasn't told because no one on the beach trusts him anymore. Jack and Juliet then debate whether or not to tell Kate something. Juliet wants to, but Jack replies, \\"Not yet\\". Reception 12.33 million American viewers watched this episode.

Life Osanna was the daughter of the nobles Niccol√≤ Andreasi, whose family had originated in Hungary,Blessed Osanna of Mantua by Prof. Plinio Corr√™a de Oliveira and of Agnese Gonzaga.It is not known if her mother was related to the Mantuan ruling family: see A. L. Redigonda, ‚ÄòAndreasi, Osanna‚Äô, Dizionario biografico degli italiani (DBI). She was reported to have had a vision of angels at age six.A Sister of the Congregation of St. Catherine of Siena. Short Lives of the Dominican Saints, p.208, Kegan Paul, Trench, Trubner & Co., Ltd., London, 1901 Feeling called to consecrated life, she rejected a marriage arranged by her father. Unable to explain her attraction to religious life to her father, in 1463, at the age of 14, she secretly received the religious habit of the Third Order of St. Dominic. She had been drawn to this Order from her admiration of two members of the Order, Catherine of Siena, and her contemporary, Friar Girolamo Savonarola, who both represented to her lives of strict self-denial.Vita della Beata Osanna Andreasi by Roberta Ghirardini Returning home, Osanna explained that she had made a religious vow and had to wear it until she had fulfilled her promise., which is an ancient custom. She waited 37 years to complete her vows so she could care for her brothers and sisters after the death of her parents. A legend states that Osanna, like Catherine of Siena, miraculously learned to read and write. One day she saw a piece of paper with two words and said, \\"Those words are 'Jesus' and 'Mary.'\\" Allegedly, from that time on, anything relating to the spiritual was within her grasp. When Osanna was thirty years old, she received the stigmata on her head, her side and her feet. She also had a vision in which her heart was transformed and divided into four parts. For the rest of her life, she actively experienced the Passion of Jesus, but especially intensely on Wednesdays and Fridays. Osanna confided these things in her biographer and \\"spiritual son,\\" the Olivetan monk, Dom Jerome of Mount Olivet, as well as the fact that for years, she subsisted on practically no food at all. Osanna Andreasi - 16th century painting Osanna was a mystic who would fall into ecstasies whenever she spoke of God, and a visionary who saw images of Christ bearing his cross. She bore stigmata along with red marks, but there was no bleeding. She helped the poor and sick and served as spiritual director for many, spending much of her family's considerable fortune to help the unfortunate. She spoke out against decadence, and criticized the aristocracy for a lack of morality. She was a friend of another member of her Order, Columba of Rieti, and is recorded to have sought counsel from another, the Stephana de Quinzanis. These phenomena brought Ossana to the attention of Mantua's ruling family. Most notably, she was sought by Francesco II Gonzaga and his wife, Isabella d'Este, as both a spiritual guide and a counselor on matters of state. She frequently foretold correctly events which later came to pass, and gained the reputation of a seer. When she died in Mantua on 18 June 1505, all the members of the nobility and clergy attended her funeral, as her body was taken in procession to the Church of St. Dominic, where it was enshrined. Later her remains were transferred to the Cathedral of St. Peter, where they are still venerated.Ghirardini Relationship with Girolamo de Monte Oliveto Her confidant, Dom Jerome (), wrote a vita (biography) of her life in 1507, very shortly after her death. Although Jerome noted that Osanna was not quick to discuss her spiritual experiences, in the last years of her life she adopted Jerome as a \\"spiritual son,\\" \\"conceived in the Blood of Christ.\\" Jerome's account is especially unique due to his intimate relationship with his subject. The biography takes the form of a detailed report of his conversations with Osanna. Jerome appended to his account Latin translations of twenty-four letters from Osanna, accompanied by documents certifying their authenticity. According to Father Benedict Ashley, these letters express an \\"intense and constant physical and inner suffering\\" made bearable only by \\"sublime experiences of union with God which [Osanna] cannot describe except in broken and inadequate language.\\" A special source of misery for Osanna was the degradation of the Church under the abusive pontificate of Alexander VI. Veneration In a response to a request by the Marchesa Isabella d'Este while on a visit to Rome, through a papal brief of 8 January 1515 Leo X authorised the celebration of her feast day in the City of Mantua. Her local cultus was confirmed by Pope Innocent XII with a Papal bull of 24 November 1694, and extended to the whole of the Dominican Order two months later.DBI. Works The content of the literary corpus of the Blessed Osanna ranges from mystical reflection to considerations on contemporary social and political questions. Her works consist of: *Lettere, an index of correspondence, addressed to a varied readership, including her fellow Dominicans and members of Mantua's ruling family; *Colloqui Spirituali, or dialogues on spiritual subjects between the Blessed Osanna and Girolamo Girolamo de Monte Oliveto Scolari.

Accessed12 August 2020. , which chronicles the history of the Selma Voting Rights Movement, including the 1965 Selma to Montgomery marches and Bloody Sunday. Chestnut was born in Selma, and attended Howard University Law School. He returned home as Selma's only black attorney, and represented civil rights demonstrators at trial there when the Selma Movement began in the 1960s. In 1986, Chestnut was one of the founders of the New South Coalition, along with Birmingham, Alabama Mayor Richard Arrington, when the Alabama Democratic Party refused to endorse Jesse Jackson for the Democratic presidential nomination.Reeves, Jay, LaRouche Contact Shocks Judge England, The Tuscaloosa News, September 30, 1994 In 1994, Chestnut was active in protesting the jailing of political activist Lyndon LaRouche. He was interviewed in the Tuscaloosa News saying that when he met LaRouche, \\"I told him that he might as well be black and in Alabama.\\" He died, aged 77, of kidney failure, after an illness lasting several months in a hospital in Alabama.  Career  J. L. Chestnut Jr. was the first African American lawyer in Selma, Alabama. He was well known for being an attorney for Martin Luther King Jr. and other respected civil rights leaders in the 1960s among civil rights protest, speeches, and marches. He was a major contributor that helped lead change for African Americans. He made advancements for African Americans voting rights and integration into law professions. On March 7, 1965, nonviolent activists gathered protesters at Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma to march together to Montgomery. This march was to bring awareness and recognition to the discrimination, segregation and neglection of African American and other minority citizen, exercising their right to vote and be heard. Alabama state troopers attacked these civil-rights protesters, physically beating them, and using tear gas. This day is known as Bloody Sunday and is a major landmark for the civil rights movement. The event was nationally televised and spread awareness around the United States, igniting change. The widespread support from the nation provoked congress to act, and a few months later in August, the 1965 Voting Rights Act was passed.  Early life  J. L. Chestnut Jr., born in Selma, Alabama, was the son of J. L. Chestnut Sr., who owned a grocery store. His mother was an elementary school teacher. His father was forced to shut down his grocery store due to an accumulation of unpaid taxes. When he was young, he had a mentor named John F. Sheilds, who was an elementary school teacher. Shields advised him to \\"go get a law degree and fight the system.\\" He said this because Chestnut Jr. expressed frustration with outdated textbooks and the differences in different institutions due to segregation and discrimination. In 1953, Chestnut obtained his undergraduate degree at Dillard University in New Orleans. Here he earned a bachelor's degree in Business Administration. Shortly after, he attended law school at Howard University, located in Washington D.C. His practices were heavily influenced by the work of Thurgood Marshall and other accomplished civil rights leaders. He was married to Vivian Chestnut of Selma. They were married for 56 years and had six children before Chestnut Jr. died.  Death  J. L. Chestnut Jr. died on September 30, 2008 at St. Vincent's Hospital located in Birmingham, Alabama. He died as the result of an infection that subsequently developed after a surgery he had, causing his kidneys to fail. He died at the age of 77 years old. His memory remains influential the Selma black community and many other black communities as well.

Tancoigne describes his experience in Kƒ±z-Dervent (located farther east, between ƒ∞zmit and ƒ∞znik) as follows: The Bulgarian presence in northwestern Anatolia was studied in more detail by the ethnographer Vasil Kanchov who visited the area in the late 19th century. According to his data, there were 20 Bulgarian villages in Anatolia, for each of which he provided the number of Bulgarian houses.

It is the story of a character in a black-and-white silent film, who transcends the medium and in doing so changes with it. Written and directed by Adam White, the story pays homage to the era of film when silent pictures were being superseded by talkies. On a more simple level, it is a love story about the possibilities of change. The film was shot on Super16 in studios and locations in Melbourne during September and October 2004. Since screening to cast and crew at the Capitol Theatre, Melbourne in March 2005, A Black and White World has been selected to screen at various international film festivals including the Brisbane International Film Festival (Australia), the Telluride Film Festival (US), the Palm Springs International Festival of Short Films (US), the Manhattan Short Film Festival (US), the Calgary Film Festival (Canada), the Cardiff Film Festival (Wales), and Flickerfest (Australia).

It is based in the film of the same name. Layout The game uses three full-size flippers, two of which are at the bottom in the normal position while the third is located farther up the table. Other features include two regular-size triangular slingshots at the bottom of the table, along with an 'alive' kickback ball save at the left outlane. There are no under-the-playfied tunnels, however, but the game features two scoops; the Geneva scoop (lower) and the Sarcophagus scoop (upper). Four pop-bumpers can be found on the left side of the table, near an 'Ice-cave'; a small hole which, when targeted, will give the player a random bonus as well as relighting the alive kickback (if, already, unlit). There is a ramp at the back of the table which feeds the left inlane. Next to that there is the \\"North Pole\\" VUK (Vertical up Kicker) which kicks up into a ramp that feeds the right inlane. The toy in this game is a model of Frankenstein's monster which, during 'Creature Multiball,' will throw a ball down onto the playfield. Gameplay *The purpose of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein pinball is to finish eight scenes indicated in a circular pattern on the playfield in order to engage a 6-ball multiball wizard mode after finishing all other modes: *Frankenstein Millions: Shoot all 12 FRANKENSTEIN letters within 30 seconds. *Stoning: Shoot a total of around 50-60 switches to collect a CREATION letter. *Creature Feature: You have 30 seconds to spell CREATURE by shooting the ramp eight times. *Lynch Justine: Shoot the Left Lane for 3 consecutive hurry-ups. *North Pole: Shoot the North Pole VUK for a hurry-up starting at 90M. *Light Extra Ball: Extra ball is lit at the North Pole. *Voltage Mode: Shoot the ramp for 20M, then the North Pole for 30M, then the Ice Cave for 40M, then the Left Lane for 50M. *Graveyard: Make a monster by collecting two arms, two legs, a torso, and a head from the various holes. As well as these modes there are also two separate multiball modes. 'Geneva multi-ball' is a three ball multi- ball mode, and is started by shooting the ball into the 'Geneva' scoop while the Geneva light is activated. 'Creature multiball' is begun by looping the 'Creature ramp' a number of times and then shooting 'North Pole.' This triggers two ball multi-play which can, then, be upgraded to as much as a six ball multi-ball by shooting for the 'North Pole' once again followed by any jackpot shot. Digital versions Mary Shelley's Frankenstein has been published as a licensed table of The Pinball Arcade in October 2015. Some SEGA logos (such as the Sonic the Hedgehog cameo, aside from the Sonic CD-esque Sound effect) were removed because of suggestions from Stern Pinball to avoid legal issues with SEGA (except on the flyer), however the song \\"Frankenstein\\" by Edgar Winter Group is included in this version. The table was also released for Stern Pinball Arcade for free. As in The Pinball Arcade, Sega logos and Sonic the Hedgehog cameos were removed, except for the Edgar Winter song \\"Frankenstein\\".

Elementary education is free and compulsory although this is not strictly enforced. Many children are not able to attend if their families need to have them work. Communities on the Atlantic Coast have access to education in both Spanish and the languages of the native indigenous tribes that live in the more rural areas of Nicaragua. Higher education has financial, organic and administrative autonomy, according to the law. Freedom of subjects is recognized.Nicaragua's President, Daniel Ortega to enforce free education The school year runs from February through November.  The higher education system  The oldest institution of higher education in Nicaragua is the Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Nicaragua, which was founded in 1812, which dates back to the Spanish colonial period. Nicaragua became a part of the Central American Federation in 1821 and declared its independence from Spain. It left the Federation in 1838 for full independence. There are many commercial schools and eight universities throughout the country. Between 2002 and 2003, a total of 100,363 Nicaraguan students attended universities and other institutions of higher learning. The National Council of Universities is the body responsible for strategic planning in Nicaragua.The Europa World of Learning 2010. Volume 2, 60th edition. P. 1500-1502 Admission to higher education is on the basis of the Bachillerato, the leading secondary school qualification. Students are also subject to an entrance examination. The Licenciado, the main undergraduate degree, is a four- or five-year course of study. A professional title may be awarded depending on the subject. Following the Licenciado, the first postgraduate degree is the Maestria, which lasts two years and culminates with the submission of a thesis. Institutions of higher learning can offer two- or three-year courses in technical and vocational education. The main qualification studied for is the Tecnico Superior. There are over 30 public universities and over 75 private institutions. Education during the Sandinista era When the Sandinistas came to power in 1979, they inherited an education system that was one of the poorest in Latin America. Under the Somozas, limited spending on education and generalized poverty forced many adolescents into the labor market and constricted educational opportunities for Nicaraguans. In the late 1970s, only 65% of primary school-age children were enrolled in school; of those who entered first grade only 22% completed the full six years of the primary school curriculum. Most rural schools offered only one or two years of schooling, and three-quarters of the rural population was illiterate. Few students enrolled in secondary school, in part because most secondary institutions were private and too expensive for the average family. By these standards, the 8% of the college-age population enrolled in Nicaraguan universities seemed relatively high. Less surprising was that upper-class families typically sent their children abroad for higher education. Boys at the American Nicaraguan School in Managua By 1984 the Sandinista government had approximately doubled the proportion of GNP spent on pre-university education, the number of primary and secondary school teachers, the number of schools, and the number of students enrolled at all levels of the education system. At the college level, enrollment jumped from 11,142 students in 1978 to 38,570 in 1985. The Sandinistas reshaped the system of higher education: reordering curricular priorities, closing down redundant institutions and programs and establishing new ones, and increasing lower- class access to higher education. Influenced by Cuban models, the new curricula were oriented toward development needs. Agriculture, medicine, education, and technology grew at the expense of law, the humanities, and the social sciences. Literacy campaign A 1980 literacy campaign, using secondary school students as volunteer teachers, reduced the illiteracy rate from 50% to 23% of the population. (The latter figure exceeds the rate of 13% claimed by the literacy campaign, which did not count adults whom the government classified as learning impaired or otherwise unteachable.) In part to consolidate the gains of the literacy campaign, the Ministry of Education set up a system of informal self-education groups known as Popular Education Cooperatives. Using materials and pedagogical advice provided by the ministry, residents of poor communities met in the evenings to develop basic reading and mathematical skills. The key large-scale programs of the Sandinistas included a massive National Literacy Crusade (March‚ÄìAugust 1980), social program, which received international recognition for their gains in literacy, health care, education, childcare, unions, and land reform.Background History of Nicaraguaglobalexchange.org Report on Nicaragua One of the hallmarks of Sandinista education (and favored target of anti-Sandinista criticism) was the ideological orientation of the curriculum. The stated goal of instruction was the development of a \\"new man\\" whose virtues were to include patriotism, \\"internationalism,\\" an orientation toward productive work, and a willingness to sacrifice individual interests to social and national interests. Textbooks were nationalist and prorevolutionary in tone, giving ample coverage to Sandinista heroes. After the 1990 election, the Chamorro government placed education in the hands of critics of Sandinista policy, who imposed more conservative values on the curriculum. A new set of textbooks was produced with support from the United States Agency for International Development (AID), which had provided similar help during the Somoza era. Despite the Sandinistas' determined efforts to expand the education system in the early 1980s, Nicaragua remained an undereducated society in 1993. Even before the Contra War and the economic crisis that forced spending on education back to the 1970 level, the education system was straining to keep up with the rapidly growing school-age population. Between 1980 and 1990, the number of children between five and fourteen years of age had expanded by 35%. At the end of the Sandinista era, the literacy rate had declined from the level attained at the conclusion of the 1980 literacy campaign. Overall school enrollments were larger than they had been in the 1970s, however. Especially in the countryside, access to education had broadened dramatically. But a substantial minority of primary school-age children and three-quarters of secondary school-age students were not in school, and the proportion of students who completed their primary education had not advanced beyond the 1979 level. Even by Central American standards, the Nicaraguan education system was performing poorly. Grading system Academic grading in Nicaragua works on a 100-point scale. For primary school and high school levels, a 60 is good enough to pass, while for further levels the pass grade is 70. Students who attain from 60 to the pass grade get the chance to take one extra test that reviews the year's topics and in which a 70 is needed to achieve a pass grade.

The album was long thought to be a studio release, however, it is a late Starday Records compilation of Jones recordings throughout the mid to late-1950s. The album features many of Jones' early gems, including many of his earliest hits, \\"You Gotta Be My Baby\\" from 1956, \\"Seasons of My Heart\\" from 1955, and Jones' first chart single \\"Why Baby Why\\" in 1955. It even lists a track from his third collaboration attempt in 1957 with Virginia Spurlock titled: \\"No, No, Never.\\" Background and composition In late 1956, there were shakeups in some of the top management jobs in Nashville and part of this realignment saw Starday Records, an independent country music label founded in Houston by Jones's producer and mentor H.W. \\"Pappy\\" Daily and Jack Starnes, absorbed into Mercury Records. As Colin Escott writes in the liner notes to the Jones retrospective Cup of Loneliness: The Classic Mercury Years, Daily and Starday president Don Pierce were approached to take over Mercury's country roster to form the Mercury-Starday label but \\"the clincher was the success of George Jones. After 12 years in the business, Mercury hadn't found one country artist who had promised or delivered half of what George had.\\" By July 1958, Mercury-Starday dissolved with Pierce assuming control of Starday and Jones remaining at Mercury with Daily producing him. Jones wrote or co- wrote all of the selections on Long Live King George. Two selections, \\"Nothing Can Stop My Love\\" and \\"Tall, Tall Trees\\", were co-written with Jones's friend Roger Miller, the latter becoming a chart-topping country hit for Alan Jackson in 1995. Jones also collaborated with J.P. Richardson (better known as the Big Bopper) on the upbeat \\"If I Don't Love You (Grits Ain't Groceries)\\" (Richardson would also compose \\"White Lightnin'\\", which would become Jones's first number one in 1959). Long Live King George includes several songs, such as his first chart hit \\"Why Baby Why\\", that appeared on his 1957 debut album Grand Ole Opry's New Star. As Jones star continued to rise in the country music field, Starday would continue to release albums featuring recordings by Jones culled from its archive, including several rockabilly sides that the singer detested. Starday would continue this practice into the 1970s. Jones would later explain to Nick Tosches in 1994, \\"There was no such thing as production at Starday. We‚Äôd go in with the band, we‚Äôd go over the song, I‚Äôd look over and tell the steel player to take a break or kick it off, and I‚Äôd get the fiddle to play a turnaround in the middle. I‚Äôd just let them know if we were going to tag it or not. We‚Äôd just go through it. We didn‚Äôt take the pains of making several takes. Back then, over three or four takes, they‚Äôd say, 'My God, this is costing us money.' So we‚Äôd just get it down as good as we could. If we went a little flat or sharp in a place or two, they‚Äôd say, 'The public ain‚Äôt going to notice that, so put it out.' So we did, and it wasn‚Äôt too successful, so I think maybe the public did notice it.\\" Track listing References Category:1958 compilation albums Category:George Jones compilation albums Category:Albums produced by Pappy Daily Category:Starday Records compilation albums ","title":"Long Live King George"},{"id":"10534908","text":"The following lists events that happened during 1873 in Australia.

It forms Swalecliffe ward of City of Canterbury Council. History The Doomsday book provides an early record of Swalecliffe: There is no mention of a church, but when the old church was demolished in 1875 there were traces of an earlier building. This may have been an early phase of the Norman church, but Whitley says that \\"it seems highly probable that the original church was a Saxon Foundation\\". Sketches of the old church appear to show Norman windows along with later features. Throughout the later middle ages there are records of gifts to the church for a variety of purposes. There is little other information about the village. The church records do however record periods of frost, floods and gales to which a sea-facing, low-lying land would be subject. In the winters of 1812 and 1813 the sea froze in the Thames Estuary. Swalecliffe's only mention in Hasted's monumental history of Kent records the gift in 1581 of a farm called \\"Bodkin's\\" (worth ¬£11 6s 8d) to Gonvyle and Caius college in Cambridge University. Most of the money (¬£10 13s 4d) was used to fund four scholars. In 1861 the parish was in extent with a population of 168.1861 Census. Summary quoted in The description in the National Gazetteer of 1868 reads: Transport The Ramsgate branch of the Chatham Main Line runs south of Swalecliffe which is served by Chestfield & Swalecliffe railway station. The A2990 Thanet Way runs between Swalecliffe and the neighbouring settlement of Chestfield and provides access to the main transport network. There used to be an aerodrome at Swalecliffe, but its location is unknown. According to the Airfields of Britain Conservation Trust it functioned from prior to August 1946 up to , however there is a picture taken on 28 June 1934 which purports to be at Swalecliffe Aerodrome. There is a report of a \\"Flying Circus\\" visiting the aerodrome in 1935. Recreational facilities The ponds, stream and sea are all centres for birdwatching. In 2016 158 species of birds were recorded by members of Kent Ornithological Society. To the north of the village the links provide a recreational resource and include a skateboard park. Part of the Saxon Shore Way footpath runs along the coast here.See Ordnance Survey maps of the area.

He was a backup outfielder in Major League Baseball who played for the Boston Red Sox and Philadelphia Athletics. Listed at , Weight 167 lb., Cicero batted and threw right-handed. He was born in Atlantic City, New Jersey and attended Atlantic City High School. An all- around high school athletic standout, Cicero spent most of his 19-year baseball career in minor league baseball, with two brief stops in the major leagues 15 years apart. He signed a contract with the Boston Red Sox when he was only 16, and reached the majors in 1929 with Boston, hitting .312 with a .500 slugging average in just 10 games, an especially impressive accomplishment given that Cicero was the youngest player in the major leagues that season at age 18. The next season, he hit .167 and also lost his youngest player title to Hank Greenberg. After that, he spent the next 14 years in the minors. In May 1944, while playing for the Newark Bears of the International League, Cicero hit three home runs in a single game, including two grand slams and 10 RBI, to lead his team to a 17‚Äì8 victory over the Montreal Royals. At the end of the season he was signed by Philadelphia Athletics, appearing for them in 12 games during 1945, his last major league season. In 1945 he set a (post-1914) record for a gap of over 14 years between major league hits.http://www.insidesocal.com/dodgers/2015/07/22/chin-hui-tsao-didnt-bat-in- a-major-league-game-for-almost-12-years-what-happened-next-is-crazy/ In three major league seasons, Cicero hit .222 (18-for-81) in 40 games, including eight RBI, 14 runs, three doubles, and four triples without home runs. A vision problem prevented Cicero from serving in the military during World War II. During the baseball off-season he played semipro football, played winter league baseball in Panama until 1952, and served as a scout for the Brooklyn Dodgers between 1953 and 1954.

Produced by Jones' manager Pappy Daily, the album was recorded during early sessions in 1954, throughout 1955, and other sessions in 1956. It is also the first album to be released on the Starday label, a label only four years old. Despite its mediocre sound (due in large part to the inadequate sound of Starday recordings), the album has become a huge collector's item. Online sales of original copies have ranged up from $200 to $500. On October 15, 2013, the album was reissued by Reserve Records, with the first 250 copies cut on blue vinyl and included a rare 45 of Jones' \\"Thumper Jones\\" releases. Background Starday Records was an independent record label in Houston that was co-founded by Jones's producer and mentor H. W. \\"Pappy\\" Daily and Jack Starnes. Jones's first recording, the self-penned novelty \\"No Money in This Deal\\", had appeared in February 1954 and in 1955 he scored his first hit with \\"Why Baby Why\\", which would be the lead track on Grand Ole Opry's New Star. The title reflected Jones's 1956 appearance on the Grand Ole Opry, which solidified his emerging status in the country music world. Extant copies of Grand Ole Opry's New Star are rare, and collector's prices are $400 and up. Recording and composition Jones wrote or co-wrote all fourteen songs on the album, which included three of his early top-10 country hits: \\"Why Baby Why\\", \\"What Am I Worth\\", and \\"You Gotta Be My Baby\\". The singer had performed \\"You Gotta Be My Baby\\" during his first appearance on the Grand Ole Opry in 1956. The first three songs written for the album, \\"Play It Cool\\", \\"Hold Everything\\", and \\"Boat of Life\\", were recorded between January and August 1954 at Starnes's Studio in Beaumont, Texas; the remainder of the songs were recorded in Houston at Gold Star Studio between March 1955 and August 1956. ;Why Baby, Why Jones's first chart hit, \\"Why Baby Why\\", has gone on to become a country standard, having been covered by Red Sovine and Webb Pierce (a number one duet in 1956), Hank Locklin (1956), Charley Pride (another number one in 1983), Waylon Jennings and Willie Nelson (1983), Palomino Road (1992) and Patty Loveless (2008). In the liner notes to the retrospective Cup Of Loneliness: The Classic Mercury Years, country music historian Colin Escott observes that part of the song's appeal \\"lay in the way a Cajun dance number was trying to break free of a honky tonk song.\\" Jones recorded the backing vocal himself, with help from innovative techniques from engineer Bill Quinn, after a planned appearance by more established singer Sonny Burns did not materialize due to the latter's drinking. According to the book George Jones: The Life and Times of a Honky Tonk Legend, Jones's frequent songwriting partner Darrell Edwards was inspired to write the words after hearing an argument between a couple at a gas station. Jones and Edwards also collaborated on \\"Seasons Of My Heart\\", which would go on to be a hit for Johnny Cash and was also recorded by Jerry Lee Lewis and Willie Nelson. Former Starday president Don Pierce later explained to Jones biographer Bob Allen that \\"Pappy realized George's strength as a balladeer long before I did. He felt that 'Seasons Of My Heart' was a big song. I knew that, in those days, it took much longer to sell a ballad, because it had to make it on the radio first...I also knew that an upbeat song like 'Why, Baby Why' would be easier to sell directly to the jukebox distributors for the beer-drinkin' trade.\\" ;Ragged But Right & Yearning \\"I'm Ragged But I'm Right\\" is a defiant statement of blue collar pride that actually dates back to a 1929 blues record by the Blue Harmony Boys. It was later cut by stringband veteran Riley Puckett in 1934 but, as Colin Escott speculated in 1994, \\"George probably picked it up from the Gulf Coast legend Moon Mullican, who played the same spots.\\" The song would remain a favorite of Jones's, who would rerecord it several times (the last being for his 1983 album You've Still Got A Place In My Heart). Grand Ole Opry's New Star also features the ballad \\"Yearning\\" with Jeanette Hicks, the first of countless duets Jones would record over his long career which would cement his place as one of country music's greatest harmony singers. =Sound quality= In later years, Jones would have little good to say about the music production at Starday, recalling to NPR in 1996 that \\"it was a terrible sound. We recorded in a small living room of a house on a highway near Beaumont. You could hear the trucks. We had to stop a lot of times because it wasn't soundproof, it was just egg crates nailed on the wall and the big old semi trucks would go by and make a lot of noise and we'd have to start over again.\\" In 2013, Grand Ole Opry's New Star was reissued for the first time. The first 250 copies of this album were pressed on blue vinyl and came with a bonus reissue of Jones's only rockabilly record, an ultra-rare 45 rpm he cut under the name \\"Thumper Jones\\" in the wake of Elvis Presley's explosion in popularity in 1956. In his autobiography the singer joked, \\"During the years, when I've encountered those records, I've used them for Frisbees.\\" However, as Nick Tosches notes in his 1994 Texas Monthly article \\"The Devil in George Jones\\", \\"Though Jones would never acknowledge it, the rockabilly impulse of the early fifties had affected his sound as much as the lingering voices of Acuff and Williams. 'Play It Cool, Man, Play It Cool,' recorded by Jones in 1954, several months before Elvis's debut, had bordered on pure rockabilly...\\" In the 1989 Jones documentary Same Ole Me, Johnny Cash insisted, \\"George Jones woulda been a really hot rockabilly artist if he'd approached it from that angle. Well, he was, really, but never got the credit for it.\\" \\"What Am I Worth\\" was covered by Sammy Kershaw on 1991's Don't Go Near the Water.

Together with Kaiserliche Werft Kiel and Kaiserliche Werft Wilhelmshaven it was one of three shipyards responsible for maintenance, repair and construction of warships for the Imperial German Navy. Kaiserliche Werft Danzig closed in 1918 after the end of World War I, but soon opened when Danziger Werft was founded on its site in 1919. History The history of the Danzig shipyard started 1844 when some area on both sides of the river Tote Weichsel at Danzig became property of the Royal Prussian Government. Named Marinedepot (1849‚Äì54) it was first only used as a depot and anchoring space for the few Prussian warships at the time. At the end of 1853 it became K√∂nigliche Werft Danzig (1854 - 1871), and was subsequently named Kaiserliche Werft Danzig (1871 ‚Äì 1918) with the proclamation of the German Empire in 1871. In 1848 when Prussia started to enlarge its navy, own development and construction of warships got higher priority which required greater shipyards for these means. In 1850 additional new grounds were bought, further constructions followed and in the late 1870s once more there was a large extension of the facilities. However, the disadvantage of the KWD was the narrow channel of the river (Weichsel) as well as some restrictions imposed by the Danzig municipality. This limited, of course, both the quantity and the dimensions of the built. The delivered tonnage of the KWD was only about 60% of that of Imperial Kiel Shipyard (Kaiserliche Werft Kiel) and only 40% of that of the Imperial Wilhelmshaven Shipyard (Kaiserliche Werft Wilhelmshaven) in the period 1898 to 1904. The construction of larger warships ended consequently 1909 with the commissioning of the light cruiser . After that time the KWD concentrated the activities on the construction of auxiliary ships and later on submarines/u boats as well as maintenance and repair of warships. Beginning in 1908 parts of the yard were enlarged and more buildings rose on these grounds for U-boat construction. The KWD was the only of the three imperial shipyards which built U-boats for the Kaiserliche Marine. Beginning with in 1906‚Äì1908 altogether 62 boats were built, but only 44 between 1914 and 1918, which was about 12% of total German submarine production, few compared to privately owned German shipyards at that time. With end of World War I the shipyard was closed but soon after opened again under different names and with different owners. Merged with the former Schichau-Werft Danzig, it belongs to Poland today, named Stocznia Gda≈Ñsk Sp√≥≈Çka Akcyjna resp. in German Werft Danzig AG (since 1990). =Ships built by Kaiserliche Werft Danzig (selection)= *1871, Gun boat *1872, Corvette *1875, Armoured corvette *1877, Corvette *1896, Armoured ship , first , total two units *1890, Unprotected cruiser , first of six equal type ships *1899, Protected cruisers und *1906, Light cruiser *1908, Light cruiser *1908 - 1918, total 46 U-boats of different types completed, additional 27 planned but not completed ** Type U-2: SM U-2 ** Type U-3: SM U-3, SM U-4 ** Type U-9: SM U-9, SM U-10, SM U-11, SM U-12 ** Type U-13: SM U-13, SM U-14, SM U-15 ** Type U-17: SM U-17, SM U-18 ** Type U-19: SM U-19, SM U-20, SM U-21, SM U-22 ** Type U 27: SM U-27, SM U-28, SM U-29, SM U-30 ** Type U 43: SM U-43, SM U-44, SM U-45, SM U-46, SM U-47, SM U-48, SM U-49, SM U-50 ** Type UE 1: SM U-73, SM U-74 ** Type U 87: SM U-87, SM U-88, SM U-89, SM U-90, SM U-91, SM U-92 ** Type U-127: SM U-135, SM U-136, SM U-137, SM U-138 ** Type UC II: SM UC-55, SM UC-56, SM UC-57, SM UC-58, SM UC-59, SM UC-60 ** Type UC III: UC 80 - UC 86, UC 139- UC 152 (never completed) ** Type Mittel U: U 213-218 (never completed) =Aircraft= *Kaiserliche Werft Danzig 404 *Kaiserliche Werft Danzig 467 *Kaiserliche Werft Danzig 1105 *Kaiserliche Werft Danzig 1650  References   External links *Summary of Kaiserliche Werft Danzig's U-boats Category:Shipbuilding companies of Germany Category:German companies established in 1852 Category:Defunct companies of Germany Category:History of Gda≈Ñsk Category:Companies based in Gda≈Ñsk Category:Companies of Prussia Category:1852 establishments in Prussia ","title":"Kaiserliche Werft Danzig"},{"id":"10535041","text":"The following is a list of schools in Nicaragua.

It consists of a red shield and a black pale with three silver Saint Andrew's Crosses, the Imperial Crown of Austria, two golden lions, and the motto of Amsterdam. Several heraldic elements have their basis in the history of Amsterdam. The crosses and the crown can be found as decorations on different locations in the city.  Heraldic elements  = Escutcheon = In the coat of arms of Amsterdam, the field of the escutcheon (heraldic shield) is red. The field is charged with three vertically ordered silver or white Saint Andrew's Crosses on top of a black pale. The field and the pale result in three vertical bands in the colours red and black. The crosses probably have their origin in the shield of the noble family Persijn. The knight Jan Persijn was lord of Amstelledamme (Amsterdam) from 1280 to 1282. In the escutcheons of Dordrecht and Delft, two other cities in Holland, the pale refers to water. In analogy with this, the black pale in the escutcheon of Amsterdam would refer to the river Amstel. Both the colours and the crosses are also found in the escutcheons of two towns near Amsterdam: the village of Ouder-Amstel on the banks of the river Amstel to the southeast, and Nieuwer- Amstel (now the suburb Amstelveen) to the southwest. Both villages were also the property of the Persijn family. The escutcheon forms the basis for the flag of Amsterdam, but the bands and crosses are positioned horizontally on the flag instead of vertically. The three Saint Andrew's Crosses are used in the logo of the city government and also as decorations on the typical Amsterdam bollards called Amsterdammertjes. = Imperial Crown = The Imperial Crown of Austria placed upon the escutcheon During the Hook and Cod wars in Holland in the 15th century, the Holy Roman Emperor Maximilian I supported the bourgeoisie in the cities (Cod) in their fight against the nobility in the countryside (Hook). During these wars Amsterdam loaned large amounts of money to Maximilian I. In 1489, the emperor gave Amsterdam the right to use his personal imperial crown in its coat of arms, out of gratitude for these loans. When his successor Rudolf II created a new personal crown, Amsterdam changed the crown accordingly. After the Reformation, the Protestant Amsterdam continued to use the crown of the Catholic emperor. In 1804, the crown of Rudolf II became the Imperial Crown of Austria. In the coat of arms of Amsterdam, the Imperial Crown is positioned on top of the escutcheon. The Imperial Crown can be found independently at several locations in Amsterdam. The tower of the Protestant church Westerkerk is crowned with the Imperial Crown and the bridge Blauwbrug is decorated with several Imperial Crowns. = Golden lions = The supporters of the escutcheon are two rampant golden lions. The compartment the lions stand on is a stone pedestal. The lions were added to the coat of arms in the 16th century. = Motto = A painter painting the new coat of arms of Amsterdam with motto on one of the city's trams in 1948 During the 1941 February strike in Amsterdam, non-Jewish people protested against the persecution of Jews by the Nazi regime. Queen Wilhelmina wanted to remember the role of the citizens of Amsterdam during World War II and created a motto consisting of the Dutch words \\"Heldhaftig, Vastberaden, Barmhartig\\", meaning \\"Valiant, Steadfast, Compassionate\\". On March 29, 1947, Wilhelmina presented the motto as part of the coat of arms of Amsterdam to the city government. > Never will I forget the emotion that overwhelmed us, when eyewitnesses first > notified us in London of how the entire population had actually turned > against the inhumanity of the cruel tyrant. > > --Wilhelmina of the Netherlands In the coat of arms of Amsterdam, the motto is written on a silver scroll. This scroll is positioned on top of the compartment under the escutcheon.  Usage  The coat of arms displayed on the Stopera (city hall and opera building) As a coat of arms of a Dutch municipality, the coat of arms of Amsterdam is registered with the Hoge Raad van Adel (cf. College of Arms). These coats of arms are all effectively in the public domain, as the municipalities cannot claim copyright. In contrast, actually using the coat of arms to suggest any kind of official endorsement is restricted, more comparable to a trademark than a copyright. The coat of arms may only be used by others than the city with the explicit permission of the municipal government. In general permission is not granted to others, because the coat of arms designates the city of Amsterdam. Individual elements, such as the three Saint Andrew's Crosses or the escutcheon may be used by others without permission.

It is considered the work \\"of a master\\" of ancient Egyptian art, and can be seen at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston.Berman, Lawrence, Freed, Rita E., and Doxey, Denise. Arts of Ancient Egypt. Museum of Fine Arts Boston. 2003. p.78. . Its catalog number is Museum Expedition 27.442. Description It depicts a mature man and was therefore likely made during the reign of Khafre (circa 2520‚Äì2494 BC). One of the earliest ‚Äì and even after four and a half thousand years, still among the finest ‚Äì true sculptured portraits, it is an almost unprecedented depiction of the unidealised features of an actual man. Sculptures portraying true likenesses of people (rather than highly stylized portrayals) are rare in Ancient Egyptian art, both before and after the creation of Ankhhaf's bust.Berman, Lawrence, Freed, Rita E., and Doxey, Denise. Arts of Ancient Egypt. Museum of Fine Arts Boston. 2003. p.78. . Plaster covers a limestone core, which has been painted red, a colour commonly given to males in both sculpture and in reliefs (figures of women were typically painted yellow). The face is stern, with a slightly uneven mouth which makes him appear as though he is smirking from one side, and aloof and impersonal from the other. There is a slight droop to the eyelids, whose eyes were once painted white with brown pupils. The figure once had a beard and ears, which were broken away in antiquity along with part of the figure's nose.Berman, Lawrence, Freed, Rita E., and Doxey, Denise. Arts of Ancient Egypt. Museum of Fine Arts Boston. 2003. p.78. . Site of discovery The bust was discovered in his tomb, installed within a small chapel oriented to the east and facing the chapel's doorway. His arms may have been sculpted on the small pedestal on which it sat, though these have been lost. It was evident that it had once been the focus of a funerary cult, as the bust had crushed several small pottery vessels of the type used for offerings when it fell in antiquity from its pedestal.Roehrig, Catherine H. \\"The Reserve Heads of the Old Kingdom: A Theory\\", Egyptian Art in the Age of the Pyramids. Yale University Press. The Metropolitan Museum of Art. 1999. p.234 Method of discovery The bust was discovered by a museum expedition funded jointly by the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston and Harvard University, and under the contract of the time, such a fine piece would normally have found a home at the Egyptian Museum in Cairo. However, this piece was awarded as thanks for the extensive work done by this expedition and the discovery of the intact royal tomb of Queen Hetepheres, who was Ankhhaf's aunt, a sister of his father. More recently, Zahi Hawass, the chief of Egypt's Supreme Council of Antiquities, has asked that this piece be repatriated to Egypt, as one of five key items belonging to Egypt's cultural heritage, a list which also includes the iconic bust of Nefertiti in the Egyptian Museum of Berlin, a statue of the Great Pyramid architect Hemiunu in the Roemer-und-Pelizaeus-Museum in Hildesheim, Germany, and the Dendara Temple Zodiac in the Louvre in Paris.\\"Antiquities wish list\\" Al-ahram Weekly Online 14 - 20 July 2005 Gallery of images Image:BustOfPrinceAnkhhaf- PartialProfile1_MuseumOfFineArtsBoston.pngThe bust of Prince Ankhhaf seen in partial profile from his right, on display at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston Image:BustOfPrinceAnkhhaf-CloseUp- PartialProfile_MuseumOfFineArtsBoston.pngThe bust of Prince Ankhhaf seen close-up and in partial profile from his left, on display at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston Image:BustOfPrinceAnkhhaf- PartialProfile2_MuseumOfFineArtsBoston.pngThe bust of Prince Ankhhaf seen in partial profile from his left, on display at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston References Category:Sculptures of ancient Egypt Category:Sculptures of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston Category:Art and cultural repatriation Category:Sneferu Category:3rd-millennium BC works Category:Limestone sculptures in the United States Category:Busts in Massachusetts Cf.

Geison went on to earn a doctorate in Yale University's Department of the History of Science and Medicine in 1970 and then joined the Princeton faculty, where he was a professor in the history department and the Program in History of Science. \\"He wrote two books, The Private Science of Louis Pasteur (1995) and Michael Foster and the Cambridge School of Physiology: The Scientific Enterprise in Late Victorian Society (1978), and edited four more. In addition, he wrote about 40 scholarly essays and book reviews and contributed 20 articles to the Dictionary of Scientific Biography. At Princeton, Geison served as director of the Program in History of Science from 1980 to 1986 and was the program's director of graduate studies for many years. He was associate dean of the college from 1977 to 1979, master of the Graduate College from 1982 to 1985, and secretary of the Committee on the Course of Study from 1977 to 1979. He received many honors and invitations to lecture on his work. The American Association for the History of Medicine awarded its 1996 William H. Welch Medal to Geison's book on Pasteur. He was a visiting scholar at the Institute for Advanced Study, a visiting historical scholar at the National Library of Medicine and a visiting senior Wellcome fellow at the Wellcome Institute for the History of Medicine in London. He received a Howard Foundation fellowship in 1979-80. Early in his academic career, Geison was a postdoctoral fellow at the Institute of the History of Medicine at Johns Hopkins University and a research fellow at the University of Minnesota Medical School. Geison was a member of the editorial board of the Journal of the History of Medicine (1996), a contributing editor of Osiris (1984‚Äì1991), and advisory editor of Isis (1979‚Äì82).

Geison used Pasteur's laboratory notebooks and published papers to described some of the most famous episodes in the history of science‚Äîincluding their darker sides, such as the human risks entailed in Pasteur's haste to develop the rabies vaccine. A reviewer wrote in the New England Journal of Medicine that the book 'requires us to reevaluate our heroes and consider the complexities of science instead of merely clinging to comforting and heroic myths.' \\" * \\"A quite different (from Bruno Latour's) approach to Pasteur has recently been taken by Gerald L. Geison in The Private Science of Louis Pasteur. Geison utilizes the French national hero‚Äôs private laboratory notebooks to reveal striking discrepancies between them and his public pronouncements. Although Geison‚Äôs aim is not to detract from Pasteur‚Äôs greatness as a scientist, but rather to present a ‚ÄúPasteur for our times,‚Äù his book has been criticized by scientists who apparently feel that any de- hagiographication of this towering figure amounts to an attack on science as such\\" * \\"the finally published book of the only historian really specialized in the history of Pasteur.Bruno Latour, Pasteur : guerre et paix des microbes, Paris, 2001, p. 10.\\" * Max Perutz came to a very unfavorable conclusion about Geison's life of Pasteur: \\"Toppling great men from their pedestals, sometimes on the slenderest of evidence, has become a fashionable and lucrative industry, and a safe one, since they cannot sue because they are dead. Geison is in good company, but he, rather than Pasteur, seems to me guilty of unethical and unsavory conduct when he burrows through Pasteur‚Äôs notebooks for scraps of supposed wrongdoing and then inflates these out of all proportion, in order to drag Pasteur down. In fact, his evidence is contrived, and does not survive scientific examination.\\" New York Review of Books, December 21, 1995 References Category:1943 births Category:2001 deaths Category:Institute for Advanced Study visiting scholars Category:Historians from Illinois Category:People from Savanna, Illinois ","title":"Gerald L.

Together with Kaiserliche Werft Danzig and Kaiserliche Werft Kiel it was one of three shipyards which solely produced warships for the Preu√üische Marine and the following German Kaiserliche Marine. With the end of World War I all three imperial shipyards were closed, but the Wilhelmshaven shipyard was reopened in 1919, first as Reichsmarinewerft Wilhelmshaven, and after 1935 named Kriegsmarinewerft Wilhelmshaven.  History  Kaiserliche Werft Wilhelmshaven was a German shipbuilding company in Wilhelmshaven, a coastal town in Lower Saxony - North Germany - on the western side of the Jade Bight, a bay of the North Sea. The predecessor of the Kaiserliche Werft was founded 1853 under an agreement of the Grand Duchy of Oldenburg and the Kingdom of Prussia. The object of this agreement was a protection of Oldenburg's merchant fleet by Prussian navy on the one hand, on the other to enlarge the Prussian sphere of influence in the western part of Germany. When the Jade Treaty was signed about 3.10 km¬≤ of Oldenburgian territory at the Jade Bight was ceded to Prussia. The first years the naval base was only used as an arsenal, depot and repair facility for the developing Prussian fleet. Building up of necessary harbours, slipways, dockyards, workshops, etc. followed some years later. After the Prussian victory over Austria in the 1866 Austro-Prussian War, the North German Confederation was founded and the shipyard was handed over from Prussia to this new confederation. The shipyard was officially opened 1869 by the Prussian King Wilhelm I. First known as K√∂nigliche Werft, the shipyard was now named Marinewerft des Norddeutschen Bundes (Naval Shipyard of the North German Confederation). With the proclamation of the German Empire in 1871 it received the final name Kaiserliche Werft Wilhelmshaven. Forced by the needs of the rapidly growing German imperial navy it became necessary to enlarge shipbuilding capacities. Under the reign of Kaiser Wilhelm II and his fleet commander Grand Admiral Alfred von Tirpitz the shipyard was immediately extended. It soon became the greatest and most important of the three German imperial shipyards, beginning with about 3000 co-workers in 1880 and at last about 21,000 end of 1918, capable to build the largest and strongest warships of that time. With the end of World War I the shipyard was closed for a short time, after that it was opened again, now named Reichsmarinewerft Wilhelmshaven and at last, some years later Kriegsmarinewerft Wilhelmshaven.

Life and writings Born in March 1937 at Hawkhurst, Kent, Kedward spent his early life in Goldthorpe (Yorkshire), Tenterden (Kent) and in Bath, where he obtained a scholarship to attend Kingswood School. He then studied at Worcester College and St Antony's College, Oxford, before being recruited as a lecturer at the University of Sussex in 1962. He became professor of history in 1991. Kedward specialized in the history of Vichy France and of the Resistance. Oral history formed a central part of Kedward's historical approach, as he has interviewed hundreds of ordinary Frenchmen and women about their experience of being in the Resistance. He has also published a general history of 20th-century France, under the title La Vie en Bleu (740 pages). =Major works= Resistance in Vichy France When Resistance in Vichy France was published in 1978 its quality was widely applauded. Joanna Richardson found it \\"solid and imaginative\\", Maurice Larkin described it as \\"stimulating and unpretentious\\" and John Horne praised its \\"admirable subtlety\\". For G. M. Hamburg the book had captured Vichy France in all of its complexity: \\"Kedward‚Äôs study of French idealism and opportunism gives a more complicated, but a more accurate picture of the motivations behind the resistance than is available in other histories\\". Critics particularly enjoyed Kedward's linking of the history of the distant and recent past. M. R. D. Foot underlined that: \\"Mr Kedward‚Äôs great advantage when he writes about politics is that he understands history. One of his book‚Äôs main virtues is that he shows how much people of southern France in those years of defeat and despair were conscious of, and sustained by, the knowledge of previous national catastrophes and of the traditional remedies for them.\\" This view was reiterated by an anonymous reviewer in The Economist: \\"he thoroughly understands French history, and is able to show how people in a country in difficulties can come to terms with their present by reflecting on their past\\". This same reviewer was full of praise for the book's methodology finding in Kedward: \\"an exemplar to scholars of how to treat almost intractable material\\". Using oral history had given considerable vitality to the study in the eyes of the Times Higher Education Supplement, \\"Kedward brings the period alive as a result of his many interviews with former r√©sistants\\". Kedward had attempted to allow different voices to emerge but for Maurice Larkin he had been a little bit over-indulgent in accepting the Communist party's stance: \\"He tries very hard to be fair to everyone ‚Äì perhaps, some may think, a little too benignly in his account of communist behaviour in 1940‚Äì41\\". Kedward was given support in France by Henry Rousso who described it in 1982 as a \\"little known work, full of original ideas\\". Rousso, although from a French family, had been born in Egypt and lived in New York, so spoke fluent English. The book had to wait over ten years for a French translation. Julian T. Jackson explained the long wait by the fact that at that time the French academic community was much more focused on the study of Vichy which Robert Paxton had revitalised than on reviewing the history of the Resistance. Paxton, he explained, \\"wrote the right book at the right time, Kedward the right one at the wrong time\\". When a French translation was published, Jean-Pierre Az√©ma wrote a preface for it. Az√©ma began this by listing all the reasons why the book had not so far been bedtime reading in France. The first was obviously a linguistic one with few French scholars of Az√©ma's generation showing much inclination to read in English. But there were also reasons related to the subject matter- Resistance in Vichy France was a book limited geographically to the study of the unoccupied zone and chronologically to the years 1940‚Äì1942 which most would consider as the nadir of Resistance activity. Az√©ma went on to highlight the originality of the book, describing it as \\"a book of the highest quality which will become a reference\\". He ended the preface by thanking the publisher for having given the French public access to a truly \\"pioneering study\\". A similar baton was taken up by French reviewers once this translation became available. Jean- Pierre Rioux in Le Monde of 20 October 1989 described it as \\"a work which appeared in 1978 and has become a classic in the eyes of specialists and all praise must go to Champ Vallon for having at last commissioned its translation\\". He praised its challenge to received ideas and its \\"remarkable understanding\\" of historical situations. In Search of the Maquis In the mid-1980s Kedward suffered a heart problem which almost killed him. The research on his next major monograph which was drawing to a close at that point was put on hold and it was not until 1993 that In Search of the Maquis came out. Again the reviews were very positive. Douglas Johnson (historian) underlined that it was a \\"book that is not only remarkably well-documented but also perceptive and moving\\". The writer Francis Hodgson described the text as a \\"Maquisard history of the Maquis, and a very fine one\\". According to John Simmonds \\"Kedward has written an extraordinary book, which maintains strong elements missing from much history of the times, such as the role of women in the Resistance\\". Simmonds underlined the skill with which Kedward conjoined different periods of history, his \\"ability to link this type of refusal with the revolts of the 18th Century Camisards in the C√©vennes and the radicalism of 19th and 20th century rural movements\\". Sarah Fishman described the book as an \\"exceptional historical analysis\\". She praised its \\"nuanced and rich portrait of life in Vichy France\\" and underlined that \\"Kedward‚Äôs sensitivity to issues of rhetoric and discourse leads to rich descriptions of the complexities and subtleties of public opinion\\". For Fishman \\"Kedward‚Äôs work, in sum, is an eloquent and subtle example of the third phase into which historiography is moving. From mythmaking to mythbreaking\\". Again the book was well received in France where it was translated more rapidly than his previous monograph under the title A la recherche du Maquis. In Lib√©ration on 23 September 1999, Olivier Wieviorka predicted classic status would befall A la recherche du Maquis. Laurent Douzou in his review of the Maquis book for Le Monde of 10 September found it astonishing that a foreign historian should have such an intimate understanding and knowledge of rural France. Perceptively he added: \\"To pull off such a triumph, without doubt one must love this history, its actors and the countryside in which it was performed\\". =Later life= Kedward has obtained numerous awards including the Prix Philippe Viannay (2005) for his book A la recherche du maquis. The French government awarded him the title of Chevalier dans l'Ordre des Palmes Acad√©miques in recognition of his services to French history. Some of his former students and colleagues grouped together to put together a festschrift for him. This came out with the publisher Berg in 2005 under the title Vichy, Resistance, Liberation, co-edited by Hanna Diamond and Simon Kitson. Despite retiring in 2002 he is continuing his research into twentieth century France. Kedward is now Emeritus Professor of History at the University of Sussex. He is the grandson of Roderick Morris Kedward (1881‚Äì1937), Liberal MP for Ashford, Kent between 1929 and 1931.

The station was privately owned by Henry Serafin. History The station signed on the air on August 1957 under the ownership of permittee Louis W. Skelly, who received the permit to build the station on August 27, 1956. Studios and offices were located at 15 East Main Street in Fredonia. The station operated at a daytime-only power of 250 watts. Skelly, a native of Austintown, Ohio, sold the station to Dunkirk-Fredonia Broadcasting, Inc., which also owned the Dunkirk-Fredonia Observer newspaper. The transaction was finalized on January 1, 1959. On April 4, 1963, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) granted permission to move the station to 2 West Main Street in Fredonia, with the transmitting equipment and tower located on Clinton Avenue. The station would remain at this address until July 6, 1973, when a fire damaged the building, prompting a temporary relocation to 60 West Main Street, and then 27 East Main Street after a permanent studio location could be obtained. Later in September of that same year, the station received pre-sunrise authorization to operate at 90 watts from 6am to local sunrise. Catocin Broadcasting Corporation, a company owned by Washington D.C. communications attorney Lauren Colby and Henry Serafin, purchased the station on March 12, 1973. Five years later, Colby's interest in the company was acquired by Serafin, who became the sole stockholder. WBUZ relocated its studios and offices in 1985 to 14 Water Street in Fredonia. By the end of the decade, the station received authorization to operate at night with a limited power of 143 watts. Catocin, under Serafin's control, maintained ownership until the station fell silent after its license was canceled by the FCC on June 1, 1991. Revocation of licenses Public objection to WBUZ's license renewal first surfaced on May 6, 1981. FCC records indicate the filing of an \\"Informal Objection to License Renewal\\" by attorney Andrew Schwartzman, who filed the objection on behalf of Chautauqua County Rural Ministry, the Dunkirk-Fredonia League of Women Voters, and the Dunkirk branch of the NAACP. The objections arose out of Serafin's alleged refusal to hire an African- American woman as a secretary, and his refusal to grant equal time to opposing views surrounding matters concerning public housing, local police, and a water fluoridation project as required under the Fairness Doctrine of the era. In September 1985, the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers revoked WBUZ's license to play songs by ASCAP artists due to Serafin defaulting on royalty payments. WBUZ continued to air the songs, prompting ASCAP to sue. Residents also complained that Serafin was running contests and not awarding the stated prizes. In April 1987, the FCC's board recommended the cancellation of WBUZ's license. When Serafin said he needed time to try finding a buyer for the station, federal judge Walter Miller offered Serafin the option of additional time by selling under the FCC's 'distress sale' policy, which allows discounted sales to minorities. Serafin reportedly refused the offer, and the station fell silent in 1989.http://www.apnewsarchive.com/1987/FCC-Board-Recommends-Revoking-License- of-N-Y-Radio-Station-Owner/id-b995c8bb43edcde230461c6eacdb3cce The WBUZ calls would end up on a short-lived AM station in Terre Haute, Indiana, in 2000 (see WBOW (1230 AM). The station, in the midst of its own license revocation proceedings, closed the next year. There now a WBUZ FM licensed in the Nashville, Tennessee, area.
