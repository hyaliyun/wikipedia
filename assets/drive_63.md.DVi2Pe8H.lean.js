AirCheck profile of Roger Scott He was best known for presenting an afternoon radio show on London's Capital London from 1973 until 1988 and was also best known for presenting his late night Sunday show, Scott on Sunday on BBC Radio 1 until his death from cancer. Born in London in 1943, Roger Scott developed an early love of the rock and roll music being created at the end of the 1950s and early 1960s. As a teenager, he began playing records out the window of his suburban London home and watching the reaction of passers-by to the music. Early career After a brief time as a merchant seaman, Scott found his way to the United States and joined the radio station WPTR in Albany, New York in 1966. Scott's job, based on his British accent, was to be 'friend of the Beatles', and Scott learned the craft of disc jockey, working with Boom Boom Brannigan and other legendary names at the station. Eight months later he left WPTR to become the evening presenter at the Montreal station 1470 CFOX. From 1967 to 1971 he was known by listeners for his on-air antics and for his passionate love of music. Notable during this time was his participation in \\"Give Peace a Chance\\", recorded by John Lennon with Yoko Ono during their Bed-In for Peace at the Queen Elizabeth Hotel in Montreal. Anticipating the launch of legal land-based commercial radio, Scott returned to the UK in 1971, only to find the introduction was not as advanced as he had anticipated. Meanwhile, he secured a position at UBN, a closed-circuit station broadcasting music to all the United Biscuits factories nationwide. It was about this time he also had a brief stint on BBC Radio 1 but, anticipating a future in commercial radio, he did so under the pseudonym 'Bob Baker'. In 1975 he and Tim Rice were resident team captains on a short-lived BBC television pop quiz programme, 'Disco!', hosted by Terry Wogan and broadcast on Sunday afternoons. He did not enjoy working on television, and the show finished after only one series. Capital London In 1973 Scott joined the original on-air line-up of London's Capital London. His afternoon drive-time shows became immensely popular with Londoners, generating such landmark features as the 'Three O'Clock Thrill' and the daily 'Hitline', together with the jingle 'Grab a little piece of heaven' by David Dundas. In 1976 his regular Friday rush-hour oldies show \\"Cruising\\" acquired a cult following, largely owing to his introduction of obscure rock-a-billy records to his London audience for the first time. He was also one of the first people in the British media to popularise the music of Bruce Springsteen. It was also during this time that Roger Scott helped champion the Knebworth Rock Festival in 1980. The Festival's Headliner was the Beach Boys who had just released their latest album titled \\"Keeping the Summer Alive\\". Scott was always a big supporter of the West Coast Beach Boys influence on modern popular music and in anticipation of the Rock Festival and also a series of two concerts at the Empire Pool (now the Wembley Arena), Scott had listeners vote on their all time 15 top Beach Boy Hits of all time. Two subsequent Fridays were used to play back the top songs coupled with some excellent interviews with all the then band members including some insightful interviews with band member, and producer at the time, Bruce Johnston. Additionally Scott included one of the Wembley concerts in his Friday night live concert series. Scott disdained the standardised playlists, market and audience research and other techniques introduced by the commercial stations in the 1980s. The Leaked Beatles Session Tapes Roger Scott was also the source of many unreleased Beatles session tapes that were issued on bootlegs. Scott was working alongside EMI engineer John Barrett on a media presentation called The Abbey Road Video Show in 1982-83. Barrett had already done a full review of all existing Beatles session tapes and during production, Barrett compiled several tapes for the presentation. Roger Scott was chosen to narrate the special. It's this project that Scott worked on that gave him access to the tapes. In later years Barrett, who died in 1984 (and also Beatles historian Mark Lewisohn) had been accused as the source of the leaked recordings. Barrett (nor Lewishohn) never leaked anything--it was his compilations of tapes, copies of which were made by Scott, that got leaked. Scott actually used some of the tracks from these dubs in 1984 for a 12-hour radio show on the Beatles entitled \\"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\\". This material subsequently appeared (taken directly from the radio show syndication transcription discs) on the bootleg NEMS release \\"Not For Sale\\" in early 1985. After Scott got diagnosed with cancer, he sold the tapes to some bootleggers for some extra cash shortly before his death. The majority of the leaked Beatles EMI material came from Scott. One set has been confirmed to have been sold to Dieter Schubert of bootleg label The Swingin' Pig. BBC Radio 1 In June 1988, after fifteen years of broadcasting with Capital, he moved to commercial-free BBC Radio 1. There, he reached a national audience for the first time, presenting a Saturday afternoon show The Saturday Sequence and a late night Sunday show, Scott on Sunday. The Saturday show featured interviews with many artists, and during this time Scott interviewed Dion, Jackson Browne, Don Henley and many others. The Sunday shows were more eclectic, featuring 1950's rock'n'roll, soul, classic rock and more contemporary music. In 1989 he also began the Classic Albums series for Radio 1. The show and Scott were remembered on a dedicated Radio 1 Vintage tribute show introduced by Richard Skinner on 30th September 2017. Roger Scott finished his final Radio 1 show, broadcast on 8 October 1989, with 'Heroes and Villains' by the Beach Boys, and his last words were: \\"Thank you for your company, thank you for your support and thank you for your kindness. I hope I'll see you next weekend but there are no guarantees\\". Having been diagnosed with cancer, he died at the end of the month, eight days after his 46th birthday. In December 1989 a tribute to him was recorded and broadcast on Radio 1, compered by Alan Freeman, with performances from Cliff Richard, Dave Edmunds and Nick Lowe, Mark Knopfler, Chris Rea, and Mark Germino, whose single 'Rex Bob Lowenstein' had been a particular favourite of Scott. Tribute In 2010, the internationally syndicated radio show It's Only Rock 'n' Roll broadcast a 2 part tribute to Roger Scott. Hosted by Alex East and featuring interviews with his friends and former colleagues: Jan Ravens, Dave Cash, Marc Denis, John Sachs, Mick Brown, Nicky Horne and Paul Burnett. It aired on radio stations around the world in the spring of 2010.

It was filmed from March 9 to May 1, 1953. Money From Home is also the only Martin and Lewis film made in 3-D, having been shot with Technicolor's 3-D camera rig, which exposed six strips of film in synchronization. It was the second and final time the rig was used. The film was also the third and last time one of the team's features was available with a Western Electric, 3-track stereophonic soundtrack. This soundtrack is now lost. The film was premiered on New Year's Eve, 1953 as a special preview in 322 theaters. Because of a technical issue at Technicolor, pairs of prints necessary for 3-D were not available, so the film was previewed in 2-D. The film went into general release in February, 1954. Lewis received an additional on-screen credit: \\"Special Material in Song Numbers Staged by Jerry Lewis.\\" It was the only time during the team's productions that Lewis received creative credit, despite co-writing and co-directing several of the pictures.

From its southern terminus at Kitts Point, which lies at the intersection of Knox, Union and Grainger counties near Blaine, Tennessee, it runs in a generally east-northeasterly direction to Garden Mountain near Burke's Garden, Virginia. It separates the Clinch River basin, to the north, and the Holston River basin, to the south. Geography US-25E descending the south slope of Clinch Mountain Clinch Mountain is a long ridge, about in length. It runs generally southwest-northeast, with numerous curves. Its north-south extent is , and east-west . Due to its size it is sometimes called a mountain range or complex. The ridge includes the sub-range of Knob Mountain, as well as four summits above 4,000 feet (Beartown Mountain, Flattop Mountain, Morris Knob, and Chimney Rock Peak). For its entire length, Clinch Mountain has only one true gap through which the ridge is completely sliced in half and continues as Clinch Mountain on either side, divided by Big Moccasin Creek. It is named Moccasin Gap and runs between Weber City and Gate City, Virginia. The Norfolk Southern Railway and U.S. Highways 23-58-421 utilize that gap because there is no elevation in the division of the mountain. Moccasin Gap is currently planned to undergo major mountain removal to accommodate a planned highway project. The natural appearance of the gap will be altered significantly. 30 miles northeast of Moccasin Gap, in Russell County, U.S. Highway 58 Alternate crosses Clinch Mountain at Brumley Mountain, between Hansonville and Abingdon. All other transportation crossings, as noted below, require an elevation climb to the top of the Clinch Mountain. When U.S. Highway 25E was realigned into a four-lane highway northwest of Bean Station, Tennessee in the 1980s, it was necessary to cut a new gap into the top of Clinch Mountain, which lowered the original gap elevation by 200 feet. That realignment, along with the lowering of Interstate 26-U.S. Highway 23 at Sams Gap on the Tennessee-North Carolina border, are the only instances of a highway gap in Tennessee actually lowering an original gap where a state or federal highway was built through. (Sams Gap was lowered by 150 feet to accommodate the new Interstate 26 highway). History Clinch Mountain is named after the Clinch River, which was named after an 18th-century explorer. The earliest known reference to the name is in the 18th-century journal of Dr. Thomas Walker: \\"Clinch's River, from one Clinch a hunter\\" (Stewart, 1967:146). The Wilderness Road to the Cumberland Gap crossed Clinch Mountain at Moccasin Gap, which Moccasin Creek flows through to join the Holston River to the south. Signal Point peak situated near Kitts Point, the southern terminus of Clinch Mountain, was used to signal troops during the Civil War. The mountains along the Clinch Mountain Ridge also played an important role in the Battle of Bean's Station. Apart from battles, the mountains in Grainger County, Tennessee had prominence in the late 1800s when the mineral springs in the area drew notable visitors from around the globe. Tate Springs, as the town and resort were named, included an enormous hotel, golf course and mineral baths. The seasonal resort even had its own spur on the railroad, so visitors could easily make the trip from all over the country. Notable guests included the Fords, Studebakers, Mellons, Firestones and Rockefellers. Because of a devastating fire and the Great Depression, only a few buildings survive today. Music \\"Way Up on Clinch Mountain,\\" a folk song based on a 17th-century Scottish ballad, was recorded by Woody Guthrie as \\"Rye Whiskey,\\" and is included in Carl Sandburg's American Songbag. The song is credited by him with inspiring the legion of \\"Bang Bang Lulu\\" variants.Sandburg, Carl. American Songbag, pp. 307 ff. 1927. Accessed 13 Jan 2014. The Carter Family immortalized the American mountain in their 1928 \\"My Clinch Mountain Home.\\" A fiddle tune called \\"Clinch Mountain Backstep\\" (attributed to Ralph Stanley) is in the Appalachian folk repertoire. Literature Clinch Mountain is also the referenced home of one branch the Sackett family tree, a fictional family that Louis L'Amour made famous with a series of seventeen books. Liberty University in Lynchburg, Virginia produced an original work in 2018 based on several individuals and families from this area. Bloodroot: The Ballad of Clinch Mountain, was created by the Women's Writing Project at Liberty. The play is based on actual events ranging from the 18th to the 20th century.

One year later in 1930, Moorman married Mary Caroline Trevelyan (1905-1995). In 1935 he was appointed Rector of Fallowfield in Manchester. During the Second World War, Moorman resigned his living and worked as a farmhand in Wharfedale, and during this period completed his thesis Church Life in England in the Thirteenth Century for a doctorate of divinity (Cambridge University, 1945). In 1945 he went to Lanercost Priory and in 1946 re-opened Chichester Theological College. While there, he also served as chancellor of Chichester Cathedral. In 1956 he resigned to concentrate on his Franciscan writings. In 1959 he was appointed Bishop of Ripon. He was a frequent visitor to the Vatican and led a delegation of Anglican observers to the Second Vatican Council. In 1967 he became the chairman of the Anglican commission which led to the Anglican-Roman Catholic International Commission. He remained a member until 1981. He died aged 84 in Durham.

Most commonly they are prepared by filling the peppers with a mixture of minced meat, rice and several spices. Traditionally in Bulgaria the filling is made of rice steamed in advance, onions, minced meat and spices, heat-treated and crammed into pre-cleaned, washed and riddled with needle peppers. After filling of peppers, they are put in a baking dish, water is added and the dish is baked in the oven. If raw egg is added to the cooled stuffing, filled peppers can be cooked in a pan, as the pods are boiled almost steamed. Besides minced meat and rice, other fillings may be used, such as vegetables (for example leek) and rice, beans, or fresh cheese and eggs. The peppers themselves can be either fresh or dried. Dried red peppers are used especially in southeastern Serbia around Pirot and Dimitrovgrad, often in winter.

It is the seat of the Bishop of Viterbo and is dedicated to Saint Lawrence. The church is an imposing Romanesque structure situated high on the hill which the city climbs, but it lacks much of the spectacular decoration with which it was originally adorned, thanks to an ill-advised sixteenth-century reconstruction.  History  = Site = Interior According to legend, the cathedral was built on the site of an Etruscan temple of Hercules. Etruscan and Roman foundations can be seen on several of the buildings facing the Piazza di San Lorenzo where the cathedral is situated. Before the 12th century, a parish church dedicated to Saint Lawrence had occupied the site of the cathedral. Even as this church was constructed, the town was already spreading northwards down the hill, leaving the plaza somewhat isolated on the highest edges of town, thus restricting its attraction to the townsfolk, a disadvantage which the local bishops for years attempted to reverse by granting the cathedral special religious privileges. = Use as a Papal residence = The cathedral was at the height of its significance during the middle and end of the thirteenth century, when it and the attached Palazzo dei Papi di Viterbo was the home of the papal throne following its flight from Rome and prior to its resettlement in Avignon. Two popes were buried in the duomo: the first was Pope Alexander IV, whose tomb was bizarrely demolished during sixteenth-century renovations, and the location of his remains are now unknown; Pope John XXI is more clearly marked despite several relocations, with a handsome tombstone originally laid over him following his death in 1277 (when his study's ceiling in the papal palace attached to the cathedral suddenly collapsed into the room below due to structural weaknesses as he slept).  Construction  The cathedral as built in the twelfth century is east-facing and sits high on the hill with the attached Papal palace overlooking the town spread below. Its fa√ßade oddly contrasts with surrounding buildings as it is not built from local stone, but was instead constructed with imported materials during Gambarra's reconstruction. It is sparsely decorated, but at its centre is a rose window, although without any form of stained-glass decoration. There are two similar but smaller windows positioned further down over two smaller entrances aside the main entrance, again undecorated. Therefore, in total there are 33 windows. The only indication of the original decoration of the cathedral can be seen on the neighbouring campanile, which is clad in alternating bands of local white travertine and blue-green basalt stone in a manner similar to the entire Orvieto Cathedral. = Reconstruction = The choir of the Canons, with frescos by Giuseppe Passeri (2683) During the mid-16th century, the cathedral was controlled by Cardinal Gambarra, scion of a wealthy Italian family, who paid for extensive reconstruction, including the demolition of the fa√ßade, roof and central apse (including a Papal tomb). He also created new chapels and replaced much of the internal art, wood and stone decorations as well as the stained glass windows. Prominent amongst his new decorations were depictions of seafood, especially lobsters and prawns, giving the land-bound cathedral a strangely nautical look. (His name Gambarra translates as prawn from the Italian, and seafood featured heavily on his coat of arms). In 1861, a further bishop also replaced the ceiling, lowering it to disguise the intricate truss and beam work of Gambarra's creation. Many of these additions were later removed or replaced with what remains of original furnishings, especially following the Second World War, during which the cathedral and the city were heavily damaged.  Art  Resurrected Christ and Four Saints, by Girolamo da Cremona or Liberale da Verona The renovations of the cathedral along the centuries eliminated most of the original frescoes. The main works along apse are 18th-century pieces by the local painter Giovanni Francesco Romanelli and contemporaries. Only two notable early artworks survive, a Redentore benedicte (Christ giving a blessing) (1472) attributed to Gerolamo da Cremona and a 12th-century Madonna and Child by an unknown artist; the work appears to be an earlier version of a famous painting in the Basilica di Santa Maria Maggiore in Rome. It has been moved here from a local parish church. The cathedral also possesses a baptismal font (1470) constructed initially by Francesco da Ancona with later additions.  Piazza di San Lorenzo  The piazza itself, although dominated by the cathedral and its campanile also possesses several other important buildings, including the town's oldest hospital in a medieval building which once housed the cathedral administration offices as well as providing a fortified townhouse for one of Italy's numerous feuding medieval families. The Etruscan foundations of this building are clearly visible from street level. To the south of the square, the House of Valentino della Pagnotta received a direct hit from an Allied bomb in World War Two but was reconstructed to original specifications. The ground floor now houses the cathedral's gift shop. The piazza boasts several small fountains and a number of other medieval buildings, but it is dominated on its north- facing side by the Palazzo dei Papi di Viterbo, which was enlarged and reconstructed in 1266 following the Papal move to the city. The Palazzo was the original location of the initiation of the conclave tradition, taken from the Latin cum claves or with keys. The cardinals were taking so long picking a new pope following the death of Pope Clement IV in 1268 that their presence was bankrupting local businesses. This drove the infuriated local people to lock the cardinals inside the palace and to steal the roof, exposing those inside to the elements. They only returned the slates and unlocked the door once a decision had been reached. The rest of the piazza is taken up by the ruins of the palace's loggia, half of which tumbled into the valley below around 1300 and was never repaired.

She was princess consort of the United Principalities and the wife of Alexander John Cuza. Biography { align=\\"left\\"  Royal Monogram of Princess Elena Cuza of Romania } The daughter of postelnic Iordache Rosetti, a high-ranking boyar of the Rosetti family, she was also closely related to the Sturdzas and other families of boyars. Born in Ia≈üi, she married Cuza in 1844 -- their relationship soured soon after, as Elena was not able to bear a child. However, she later raised as her own children his two sons by his mistress, Elena Maria Catargiu-Obrenoviƒá. She remained, however, very devoted to her husband in their public life, and was responsible for securing his flight from the country in 1848, after Prince Mihail Sturdza began arresting participants in the Moldavian revolutionary movement. They returned after the start of Grigore Alexandru Ghica's rule, but Elena suffered from depression after Cuza began engaging in adulterous affairs and left for Paris, France until 1853. After her return, she became almost completely estranged from her husband, who kept as his mistress Elena Maria Catargiu-Obrenoviƒá, the mother of Milan Obrenoviƒá (future Prince of Serbia). The Cuza family Palace in Ruginoasa Elena left for Paris and remained there until 1862, long after the ad hoc Divan had elected Cuza ruler; she had been persuaded to do so by the writer and political figure Vasile Alecsandri, who tried to extinguish the scandal provoked by Cuza's marital neglect. As wife of the head of state, she became noted for her charity work (the building of the Elena Doamna Asylum in Cotroceni, Bucharest) and adopted orphans, including the illegitimate children of her husband -- Alexandru Al. Ioan Cuza and Dimitrie Cuza; Elena Cuza took over, furnished, and maintained the private residence in Ruginoasa, Ia≈üi County, and was responsible for the Neo-gothic style of its decorations. During the coup d'√©tat against her husband (22 February 1866), she was isolated in her apartments by the conspirators, who burst in on Cuza as he was spending the night with Maria Catargi-Obrenoviƒá. Both she and Maria joined Cuza in his European exile. After her husband's death in 1873, she took care of their children, and lived to see the death of her two adoptive sons (Alexandru, was the husband of Maria Moruzi - she was later married, for just one day, with the National Liberal leader Ion I.

The complex is shared by the IRT Broadway‚ÄìSeventh Avenue Line and the BMT Broadway Line. It is served by the: * 1 and R trains at all times * N train during late nights only * W train during weekdays only The complex originally consisted of two separate stations. In 1905, the Interborough Rapid Transit Company (IRT) opened a double balloon loop at South Ferry, serving the IRT Broadway‚ÄìSeventh Avenue and IRT Lexington Avenue Lines. The Brooklyn‚ÄìManhattan Transit Corporation (BMT) opened its station at Whitehall Street in 1918. Despite their proximity, the stations remained separate for 91 years. In the early 2000s, as part of the recovery effort from the September 11, 2001, attacks, a new South Ferry terminal for the Broadway‚ÄìSeventh Avenue Line was proposed. That station opened in 2009, replacing the loop station and providing a connection between the Broadway‚ÄìSeventh Avenue Line's 1 train and the Broadway Line's N, R, and W trains. The new terminal for the Broadway‚ÄìSeventh Avenue Line was severely damaged during Hurricane Sandy in 2012, and the MTA temporarily re-opened the loop station between 2013 and 2017, adding a temporary connection between the IRT Broadway‚ÄìSeventh Avenue Line's loop and the BMT Broadway Line's platforms. The newer terminal reopened in June 2017 following extensive renovations and waterproofing work. This station complex is the third on the site to bear the name South Ferry. The first was an elevated station located nearby, which was open from 1877 to 1950 and served the former IRT Ninth, Sixth, Third, and Second Avenue elevated lines. The second was the old South Ferry loop station, located above the existing station complex. Station layout =Exits= An entrance to South Ferry/Whitehall Street, seen in June 2017 Entrances and exits are located at the following places: * Two staircases at the west side of Whitehall and Stone Streets, east of the Alexander Hamilton U.S. Custom House (National Museum of the American Indian) * One staircase at the northeast corner of Whitehall and Stone Streets * Two staircases at the southwest corner of Whitehall and Water Streets * One set of staircase/escalators and one elevator northwest of the Whitehall Terminal * One set of staircase/escalator outside of the bus stop at the southeast corner of Water and State Streets * One staircase on the southwest side of State Street, south of the intersection with Pearl Street IRT Broadway‚ÄìSeventh Avenue Line platforms There are two separate stations on the IRT Broadway‚ÄìSeventh Avenue Line, which are individually named South Ferry due to their connection to Manhattan's South Ferry. The name \\"South Ferry loops\\" is used for the Old South Ferry platforms, while the newer platforms are called \\"New South Ferry.\\" The newer island platform station was first used by the Broadway‚ÄìSeventh Avenue Line's 1 service from 2009 to 2012 until it was damaged by Hurricane Sandy, and was again placed into use in 2017. The outer loop platform was reopened on April 4, 2013, to provide temporary replacement service, and closed again in 2017 when the newer station reopened. =Old South Ferry station (1905‚Äì2009, 2013‚Äì2017)= The South Ferry loops consist of two side platforms on curved balloon loop tracks. The outer platform was operational until 2017, when it was permanently replaced by the new South Ferry station. The inner platform was in operation until 1977, and was subsequently walled off. However, free transfers were unavailable between the platforms and each platform was meant to be served by its own line. The most recent configuration using both tracks consisted of the IRT Broadway‚ÄìSeventh Avenue Line on the outer loop platform and the IRT Lexington Avenue Line on the inner loop platform. Outer platform On July 10, 1905, the outer South Ferry platform was the first of the two platforms to open and was an extension of the original trunk line of the Interborough Rapid Transit Company. The inner track existed when the station was built, but only as a storage track. When the \\"H\\" system of the IRT opened on July 1, 1918, Broadway‚ÄìSeventh Avenue Line trains used the outer platform while the inner platform was opened for IRT Lexington Avenue Line trains which used the original trunk line in Lower Manhattan. Only the end doors of each car of the five-car trains could platform at the station, because of the large gap between the middle doors and the platform, owing to the severe curve of the station. This problem was remedied in January 1959 when gap fillers were installed. Services on the Broadway‚ÄìSeventh Avenue Line, including the 1 and 9 trains (the latter of which was a rush-hour skip-stop duplicate of the former from 1989 to 2005), used the outer platform as a terminal station for more than a century since its inception, except for two relatively short periods of time. The first period was between September 2001 and September 2002 since the main branch south of Chambers Street was impassable after the September 11 attacks. The second was from March 16, 2009, when the new South Ferry station opened for 1 train passengers, to April 4, 2013, when the outer platform reopened with a transfer to the BMT section of the station complex. The newer station, located underneath this one, allowed a free transfer to the BMT station whereas neither of this station's platforms originally did. =Station features= Looking down the platform The platform is smaller than most others in the system, having only of surface area, and it was originally served from two stairs leading from the Staten Island Ferry's Whitehall Terminal. The radius of the curve is only , meaning that the platform curves approximately 77.5 degrees between its front and back ends. The platform accommodates the first five cars of a train, but the rear five cars of a 10-car 1 train cannot load or unload. In addition, spray nozzles are required to lubricate the track to reduce the friction caused by the tight curve, which slows train operation and generates a loud metallic scraping noise. Because of the curve, gap fillers were required, and are still used, to bridge the gap between the platform and the doors. The now-automated gap fillers previously required manual operation, with a foreman and at least two train crew, all of whom could directly see each other; the train crew had to give a signal to the foreman, who pulled a tall wooden lever to manually extend and retract the gap fillers. The gap fillers were also unreliable, as they needed 15 days of maintenance for every 6 months in service. The platform featured an oak ticket booth and an oak-cased clock from the Self Winding Clock Company. Evidence of the now-demolished ticket booth is a Beaux Arts design engraved on the ceiling. The platform also features station tiling by Heins & LaFarge, who designed the station plaque in a sans-serif font. The walls are made of small white rectangular tiles, except for the bottom , which is marble. There are also fifteen ceramic plaques toward the top of the platform wall, all of which depict a sloop in the New York Harbor to signify the station's location and use. The top of the wall also includes festooned garlands and station monograms, in addition to ceramic trim where the wall intersects the ceiling. The station artwork on the original exit's landing is a 1990 mural, \\"South Sails\\", by former MTA Arts & Design director Sandra Bloodworth. During the 2004 Finding Of No Significant Impact for the station, it was determined that the station was eligible for National Register of Historic Places status. =Replacement and restoration= The South Ferry loop station proved to be a service bottleneck. Operationally, the loop station functioned an intermediate station rather than as a true terminal, as trains would simply proceed back to Rector Street without the motorman needing to go to the reverse end of the train. Additionally, unlike most terminal stations in the system, there were neither layup tracks nor an additional track to store terminating trains, and there were no additional layup tracks along the line until at least 34th Street‚ÄìPenn Station. This meant that trains could not dwell at the station for longer for 90 seconds (including the 5 to 10 seconds each that it took to extend and retract the gap fillers). Any trains that went out of passenger service at the station could have caused major delays along the rest of the line. Finally, trains could only proceed through the station at slow speeds, adding 30 to 60 seconds to travel time compared to a \\"regular\\" terminal station with two tracks and a full-length platform. This ensured that 1 trains were delayed at the Chambers Street station, three stops north, for up to two minutes in both directions. In order to eliminate this special operation, the new station was built as a two-track, 10-car-long island platform on a less severe curve, permitting the operation of a typical terminal station. The MTA stated that the new station saved four to six minutes of a passenger's trip time and increased the peak capacity of the 1 service to 24 trains per hour (or one every 2 minutes 30 seconds), as opposed to 16 to 17 trains per hour (or one every 4 minutes) with the loop station. The successor station is fully accessible (although its transfer to the BMT Broadway Line is not), with the main entrance located across from the Staten Island Ferry terminal building's entrance. After Hurricane Sandy in late October 2012, the outer loop was brought back into service in order to turn trains uptown after terminating at Rector Street, as the replacement station suffered extensive flooding damage and closed for repairs. After a few months, the MTA decided to reopen the loop station as an interim terminal to restore the connection from 1 service to the Staten Island Ferry. The South Ferry loop station was the first permanently-closed subway station to reopen since the founding of the MTA. The station reopened on April 4, 2013, with a connection to the Broadway Line platforms, and remained open until June 27, 2017. Inner platform The closed inner platform as seen from the outer platform The inner platform opened for IRT Lexington Avenue Line passengers on July 1, 1918. Service from that line was moved from the outer platform, and the outer platform was used for trains on the newly opened Broadway‚ÄìSeventh Avenue Line. This platform has an even sharper curve than the outer platform, and only the center doors opened here, with special arched openings in a wall between the platform and track at the locations of the doors. In the late 1950s, when the IRT division began to use mostly R-type cars which could not have only the center doors opened, 5 trains (which ended at South Ferry evenings and weekends only) and 6 trains (which ended at South Ferry late nights) were rerouted to the outer loop. The Bowling Green‚ÄìSouth Ferry shuttle, which ran weekdays and at first also late nights, continued to use the inner loop, running to the west platform at Bowling Green until 1977, when the inner platform was closed and Lexington Avenue trains stopped using the outer loop. Specially modified R12 cars were used starting in the late 1960s until the service ended. These cars had two different door controls; the first opened the outer two sets of doors while the second opened the center set of doors only. There was no free transfer between the inner loop and the outer loop platforms, which meant that passengers must pay another fare when moving from one loop to the other. No regular service has been at the inner loop station since February 13, 1977, although the inner track is still used as a turning loop for 5 trains when they terminate at Bowling Green on weekday evenings and weekends. =South Ferry station (2009‚Äì2012, 2017‚Äìpresent)= The South Ferry station, which serves the IRT Broadway‚ÄìSeventh Avenue Line exclusively, has two tracks and one island platform, and is the only IRT platform currently in use. The new station's platform has a slight curve, but unlike the loop stations, can fit all 10 cars of a full-length train without significant platform gaps or gap fillers. The two tracks end at bumper blocks at the south end of the platform. This station was built as a replacement for the loop station, which was relegated to being used for turn-arounds once the new station opened. Unlike the loop station, this station is accessible only by IRT Broadway‚ÄìSeventh Avenue Line local trains, and does not connect with the Lexington Avenue Line. It allows 24 trains per hour (or one every 2 minutes and 30 seconds) to terminate at the station. The new station offers three street entrances, with the main entrance located across from the Staten Island Ferry terminal; the loop station originally had only one entrance within the terminal itself before it reopened with a connection to the South Ferry‚ÄìWhitehall Street complex in 2013. It also added a free transfer to the Whitehall Street‚ÄìSouth Ferry station on the BMT Broadway Line. Landscaping for Peter Minuit Plaza, which is above the station, was completed in May 2010. Construction On September 11, 2001, a terrorist attack destroyed the World Trade Center, located slightly to the north of South Ferry and the Battery. Since the entire WTC site was destroyed in the attacks, this meant that the segment of the IRT Broadway‚ÄìSeventh Avenue Line that ran through the WTC, including the Cortlandt Street station two stops north of South Ferry, was also destroyed. This resulted in service changes to the 1, 2, and 3 routes and led to reduced service in Manhattan and Brooklyn until the WTC section of the line reopened in September 2002. Concurrent with the rebuilding of that section of the line, MTA officials recognized the need to build a more efficient terminal for the 1 and 9 trains at South Ferry, since it was anticipated that the line would be heavily used in the long-term aftermath of the attacks. This also coincided with the renovation of Battery Park. In 2003, money was allocated for the new station's construction, and in 2005, construction commenced on the new station. The station was originally budgeted at $400 million, with most of the money being a grant from the Federal Transit Administration earmarked for World Trade Center reconstruction. Initially, the station's construction had been opposed because of the high cost and low perceived time savings. Community leaders acquiesced after being told that some of the money was going to be used to renovate Battery Park, and the South Ferry Terminal Project was allowed to proceed. The FTA issued a Finding of No Significant Impact on August 30, 2004. During planning, the FTA evaluated several alternatives, including extending the existing loop platform northward; building the terminal with an extra track and platform; building a two-track terminal underneath the loop; building a two-track terminal directly under Water Street, to the east; building a two-track terminal along the waterfront under South Street, to the southeast; building a three-track terminal below the BMT Broadway Line's Whitehall Street station, under the namesake street; and building the terminal diagonally under Peter Minuit Plaza. Of these seven options, the last one was chosen because any other alternative would have been either too expensive or logistically infeasible. The project was split up into three parts: construction of bellmouths, a fan plant, and track junctions from the existing line; approach tunnels to the station; and the station itself. The bellmouths' construction would require that of the original tunnel would have to be rebuilt to accommodate the new junction. The fan plant, located to the east of the existing line, would facilitate ventilation from the new deep-level station, which would be located below three exiting subway lines (the loop platform, the IRT Lexington Avenue Line's Joralemon Street Tunnel, and the BMT Broadway Line's Montague Street Tunnel). The two new approach tunnels would be single-track tunnels connecting to a cavern where a double crossover switch would be installed. The new station, located at a depth of , would contain a platform, a new mezzanine level, escalators, and an elevator. In late 2005, New York City authorities announced that builders working on the new station had found the remains of a 200-year-old stone wall. After archaeological analysis, it was widely reported to be the oldest man-made structure still in place in Manhattan. Four walls and over 250,000 individual artifacts were found in the excavation of the subway station. A portion of one wall was placed on temporary display inside Castle Clinton. The platform view as seen shortly after opening in 2009 In December 2008, news sources reported that the new station was essentially finished. However, the following month, the opening was delayed because the tracks were too far from the edge of the platform, and the gap between the platform and the train did not meet ADA standards. Other delays were attributed to leaks in the station, which were caused by the station's high water table. The problem was corrected and the station opened on March 16, 2009,New and Old Downtown: Wall Street and South Ferry. Forgotten NY. Retrieved June 11, 2014. a year behind when it was originally set to open. At $530 million, the new South Ferry station ended up being $130 million over budget. It was the first new subway station completed since 1989 when the IND 63rd Street Line stations opened. On April 16, 2009, MTA Capital Construction awarded a $19.2 million contract to Tully Construction Company to reconstruct Peter Minuit Plaza. After the station opened, a long portion of the excavated historic wall was embedded permanently into the wall of the entrance to the newly constructed station. \\"This wall most likely is a portion of the gun batteries that once protected the city in the late 17th and 18th centuries and gave rise to the modern park name,\\" said Robert Tierney, chairman of the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission. The city and the New York City Transit Authority plan to work together to preserve the remains, which were described as \\"an important remnant of the history of New York City.\\" The station's mezzanine and escalator shafts feature monumental artwork titled See it split, see it change, which consists of fused glass wall, stone mosaic, and a stainless steel fence. The artwork, by Doug and Mike Starn, depicts Manhattan topography and was installed in the mezzanine over a period of three years. At the time of the work's installation, it was the most expensive MTA Arts for Transit work ever installed, with a price tag of $1 million. Post‚ÄìHurricane Sandy Station condition after Hurricane Sandy On October 29, 2012, the new South Ferry station suffered extensive flooding damage caused by Hurricane Sandy. The station was flooded in up to of salt water, submerging it from the track level to the mezzanine, and turned the station into a \\"large fish tank,\\" as then-MTA chairman Joseph Lhota described it. As a result, this section of the complex was closed until further notice. The MTA estimated that repairs would cost $600 million and might continue until 2016. The terminal for the routes serving the station was moved back to Rector Street until the old loop station could be put back into service. The old loop station reopened on April 4, 2013, as a temporary replacement until the new station could be restored to revenue service. The connection between the loop station and the rest of the station necessitated the temporary removal of a section of the See it split, see it change artwork. The station underwent renovations, signal room relocations, and extensive waterproofing work. The $194 million contract was awarded in November 2014 to Judlau Contracting, and the station underwent extensive reconstruction until its reopening. Some undertaken tasks included the installation of retractable floodgates at exits and entrances, the sealing of vents, manholes, hatches, conduits, and ducts, and the cleaning up of the station. These improvements necessitated the closure of the station complex's main entrance for almost a year starting in October 2015. The renovation cost $345 million. The station reopened on June 27, 2017, four years and eight months after Hurricane Sandy. The opening occurred in time to accommodate new service patterns due to a long-term weekend closure of the Clark Street Tunnel, which diverted weekend 2 trains to South Ferry for one year. = Gallery = File:NYCS IRT Bway7thAve SouthFerry-Gapfiller.jpgMovable gap filler at station File:Old South Ferry Monitors vc.jpgConductor controls the whole length of the curved platform using monitors File:Old South Ferry Reopens (8619068743).jpgPassageway to BMT platforms as seen from end of loop platform File:South_Ferry_loop_mosaics.jpgMosaic tile name tablet File:South Ferry IRT stair jeh.JPGArtwork on the left File:South Ferry ship relief 2 vc.jpgOne of the many boat mosaics within the station File:South Ferry artwork 1 vc.jpgNew artwork File:South Ferry artwork 3 vc.jpgExcavated wall File:11. Station Being Pumped out (8152151223).jpgFlooded station after Hurricane Sandy  BMT Broadway Line platforms  Whitehall Street‚ÄìSouth Ferry on the BMT Broadway Line has three tracks and two island platforms. The outer tracks continue south into the Montague Street Tunnel to the BMT Fourth Avenue Line in Brooklyn, and are used by late-night N trains and daytime R trains. The center track, used to terminate late-night R trains from Brooklyn and weekday W trains from Queens, merges with the outer tracks at both ends of the station. The station is deep because of two factors: the line goes under the East River directly southeast of the station, and the station exists immediately to the south of the shallower Bowling Green station, which crosses the Broadway Line. The fare control area and transfer to the IRT Broadway‚ÄìSeventh Avenue Line platforms are at the extreme south end of the station, with additional exits at the north end. South of this station, a pair of bellmouths exists, allowing for a connection to a never-built East River tunnel south of the Montague Street Tunnel, going towards the proposed DeKalb Avenue bypass, using the old LIRR Atlantic Avenue Tunnel or under another street in Brooklyn. Further south is a flying junction joining from Broad Street on the BMT Nassau Street Line (). When this station opened on September 20, 1918, it was the terminal for the Broadway Line. The connection to Brooklyn opened on August 1, 1920. On January 6, 1994, Automated Fare Collection turnstiles went into service at this station, and at the Wall Street station.

Competing with KFC and Popeyes, many locations today are co- branded with Nathan's Famous, many of which are also co-branded with sister chain Arthur Treacher's, and have several locations in the New York metropolitan area. It is famous for its skinless fried chicken products and for their signature fried chicken having 25% less fat than traditional fried chicken. History Pudgie's Famous Chicken was founded in 1981 in Bethpage, New York by George Sanders, who developed a secret batter recipe and skinning process. This concept was spread throughout Long Island and by 1989 Pudgie's became a franchise company. TruFoods Systems, Inc., bought the trademark in 2002, and as of 2011, TruFoods operates the Wall St. Deli, Ritter's Frozen Custard, Arthur Treacher's, and Pudgie's. Today, this concept is exclusive to Nathan's Famous, and as such, many of these are cobranded with Nathan's. On July 21, 2014 the first rebranded \\"Pudgie's Naked Chicken Co.\\" opened in Massapequa, New York. TruFoods President, Gary Occhiogrosso, said he is reinventing the Pudgie's brand which still offers skinless fried chicken but also offers fresher ingredients. Its menu has been modernized to spotlight what Ochiogrosso called ‚Äúgrilled and healthier options.\\" Nothing is frozen, and all items ‚Äî including fries and roasted vegetables ‚Äî are freshly prepared, as much to order as possible.

The Sport Boat is designed to be rowed, sailed, or powered by an outboard motor, and is among few designs to be fairly efficient at all three. It can also be poled or paddled, but is too wide for efficient paddling. It is manufactured in a fashion similar to an aircraft, made of a stressed skin aluminum, riveted together, and weighs slightly over 110 pounds. In current production, it is rated for 805 pounds capacity and a outboard motor. It can plane with as little as a 3.5 hp motor, and has been used with as much as a 25 hp motor. Moving a lone operator forward to the middle seat enables planing performance over 10 mph with as little as 2.5 hp. Ballasting the bow greatly improves operation under power. As a canoe, the Grumman Sport Boat was originally rated for an 1,100 pound payload. Due to its unusual planing ability, the United States Coast Guard in the 1970s applied a different rating rule. Without any changes to the boat, the payload rating dropped to 550 pounds. Evolving rules for planing boats, requiring level flotation when swamped with maximum payload and rated engine, led to the demise of production by Grumman in 1979. The inaugural issue of Small Boat Journal decried the end of Grumman's Sport Boat production in a black-bordered article evocative of a eulogy. The Grumman Sport Boat was named by the editors of Small Boat Journal as one of the 10 best small boats of all time. Boatbuilder and designer Robb White wrote of one in his essay \\"The Chicken Feed Boat,\\" and made a strip-planked wood variant and sold the plans. Small Boat Journal founding editor David Getchell wrote a feature SBJ article about the SportBoat and bought one, and mentioned it again in \\"Outboard Boater's Handbook: Advanced Seamanship and Practical Skills.\\" Early models included the mast base clip and gunwale holes to use with the Grumman factory sail kit, with either a gunter or lateen rig. Sail kits are long out of production. 1986 also saw the Grumman Boats‚Äô purchase of an assembly plant in Minong, WI. All units produced at this location were assembled with parts supplied in the flat, shipped from either Marathon, NY or Arkadelphia, AR. This was done to achieve lower freight costs to dealers and consequently better sales penetration in the North Central and Northwestern market areas of the country. This strategy had been employed to a lesser degree some years earlier with limited success at Grumman sister locations in Carmichaels, PA and Corcoran, CA. SportBoats remain popular in the Great Lakes and midwest, and are a favorite of duck hunters, frequently camouflaged with the oarlock sockets removed to eliminate hang-ups in grass. Except on Alaskan rivers, Sport Boats are uncommon west of the Rockies. The University of Washington Aquatic Recreation Center has a dozen or so heavily used and extensively repaired SportBoats in its rowing fleet on Lake Washington at the Montlake Cut. The Marathon Boat Group, a company of former Grumman managers and investors, reintroduced production of the Sport Boat with sheathed flotation under the gunwales to comply with the level-flotation rule. Originally, the Sport Boat featured twin sets of oarlock sockets, but the current version has only one, and the sheathed flotation makes retrofitting the second set difficult. Marathon continues to make the Sport Boat and other Grumman canoes, and in 2000 acquired rights to use the Grumman name and logo. (see also \\"Discussion\\" in this category). L. Manser, England.

Cricket career  Heygate's conventional cricket career can be dismissed in a few sentences. Educated at Epsom College, he was a right-handed opening batsman who played five times in first-class matches for Sussex between 1903 and 1905. Only in one match, against Kent at Tonbridge in 1905, when he scored 80 and an undefeated 68, did he show any particular talent. After 1905, he did not play again in the years leading up to the First World War, though he appeared for Canada against the United States in 1908.  The Heygate Incident of 1919  Heygate's enduring fame rests on a single final appearance for Sussex in the match against Somerset at the County Ground, Taunton in May 1919. County cricket in England resumed immediately after the First World War but first-class matches in the County Championship were restricted to two days only, and several sides struggled for players as servicemen waited to be discharged. Sussex travelled to Taunton short of a player and Heygate, there as a spectator, was pressed into service. Since his last first-class cricket 14 years before, though, he had sustained leg wounds during the war and suffered badly from arthritis (rheumatism, according to Wisden Cricketers' Almanack). The extent of his injuries became apparent as he was first excused fielding while Somerset made 243, and then batted at No 11, being bowled by Jack White for 0 as Sussex replied with 242. On the second day, according to the recollection of Jack MacBryan, recounted in David Foot's history of Somerset cricket, Sunshine, Sixes and Cider, Heygate remained in a blue serge suit with the implication that he would take no further part in the match. But Sussex then dismissed Somerset in the second innings for 103 and, wanting 105 to win the match, themselves faded to 48 for six wickets. There was then a pugnacious partnership of 55 that took the score to 103, when two wickets fell in successive deliveries. Another run was scored, bringing the two sides level, and then the ninth wicket was taken. At that point, there was a hiatus, and accounts between Foot and Wisden vary. Both agree, however, that after some minutes had elapsed without Heygate appearing to bat, someone on the Somerset side appealed, and umpire Alfred Street, a respected Test match official, ruled that Heygate was out timed out, the Sussex innings was over and the match was a tie. Foot's account has Heygate with pads strapped on top of his blue serge suit making a valiant but fruitless attempt to reach the wicket. Wisden, less detailed, merely remarked: \\"Whether or not Heygate would have been able to crawl to the wicket, it was very unsportsmanlike that such a point should have been raised.\\" The decision caused controversy in the press and elsewhere, much of it centring on the lack of civility to a wounded ex- serviceman. But an MCC committee upheld the umpire's decision and the result of the match stood. There being no \\"Timed Out\\" dismissal at the time ‚Äì the Law was not introduced until 1980 ‚Äì Heygate was recorded as \\"out, absent\\". More recent scorecards have shown him as \\"absent hurt\\". Perhaps not surprisingly, Heygate did not play first-class cricket again. His obituary in the 1938 Wisden makes no reference to the 1919 incident.  The Timed Out Rule  MCC ruled that umpire Street was correct under the then Law 45 of the Laws of Cricket. At the time, this Law was part of a list of duties addressed to the umpires, and stated: \\"They shall allow two minutes for each striker to come in\\". Unlike the present Law 31, which allows for a specific dismissal method of \\"Timed Out\\", the old Law in 1919 did not specify what happened when an individual batsman failed to reach the wicket in the time allowed.

In the same way that the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders assesses and facilitates research on mental disorders, CSV is intended to provide a theoretical framework to assist in developing practical applications for positive psychology.  Definition of strengths and virtues  CSV identifies six classes of virtue (i.e. \\"core virtues\\") comprising 26 measurable \\"character strengths\\". The organization of the six virtues and 26 strengths is as follows: # Wisdom and Knowledge: creativity, curiosity, open-mindedness, love of learning, perspective, innovation # Courage: bravery, persistence, integrity, vitality, zest # Humanity: love, kindness, social intelligence # Justice: citizenship, fairness, leadership # Temperance: forgiveness and mercy, humility, prudence, self control # Transcendence: appreciation of beauty and excellence, gratitude, hope, humor, spirituality CSV in its opening chapterSee CSV's first chapter (\\"Introduction to a 'Manual of the Sanities'\\"), section entitled \\"Criteria for a Strength of Character\\" (pp. 16-28). defined character strengths as satisfying most of the ten following criteria: * contributes to individual fulfillment \\"for oneself and others\\";\\"Criterion 1 A strength contributes to various fulfillments that constitute the good life, for oneself and for others\\" (CSV, p. 17). * intrinsically valuable, in an ethical sense (gifts, skills, aptitudes, and expertise can be squandered, but character strengths and virtues cannot); * non-rivalrous; * not the opposite of a desirable trait (a counterexample is steadfast and flexible, which are opposites but are both commonly seen as desirable); * trait-like (habitual patterns that are relatively stable over time); * not a combination of the other character strengths in the CSV; * personified (at least in the popular imagination) by people made famous through story, song, etc.; * observable in child prodigies (though this criterion is not applicable to all character strengths); * absent in some individuals; * and nurtured by societal norms and institutions. The introduction of CSV suggests that these six virtues are considered good by the vast majority of cultures and throughout history and that practicing these traits leads to increased happiness. Notwithstanding numerous cautions and caveats, this suggestion of universality hints that in addition to trying to broaden the scope of psychological research to include mental wellness, the leaders of the positive psychology movement are challenging moral relativism and suggesting that virtue has a biological basis. These arguments are in line with the science of morality. Each of the 28 character traits is defined behaviorally, with psychometric evidence demonstrating that it can be reliably measured. The book shows that \\"empirically minded humanists can measure character strengths and virtues in a rigorous scientific manner.\\" Practical applications of positive psychology include helping individuals and organizations correctly identify their strengths and use them to increase and sustain their respective levels of well-being. Each trait \\"provides one of many alternative paths to virtue and well-being.\\" Therapists, counselors, coaches, and various other psychological professionals can use the new methods and techniques to build and broaden the lives of individuals who are not necessarily suffering from mental illness or disorder. Finally, other researchers have advocated grouping the 28 identified character traits into just four classes of strength (Intellectual, Social, Temperance, Transcendent) or even just three classes (without Transcendence). Not only is this easier to remember, but additionally there is evidence that these adequately capture the components of the 28 original traits.Jessica Shryack, Michael F. Steger, Robert F. Krueger, Christopher S. Kallie (2010). The structure of virtue: An empirical investigation of the dimensionality of the virtues in action inventory of strengths. Elsevier. Perspective and wisdom (personified for example by Ann Landers): the coordination of \\"knowledge and experience\\" and \\"its deliberate use to improve wellbeing.\\" Many, but not all, studies find that adults' self-ratings of perspective/wisdom do not depend on age. This stands in contrast to the popular notion that wisdom increases with age. Relation to virtue ethics The virtues presented to some extent mirror the cardinal virtues and theological virtues of Aristotle and Aquinas: hope, faith, charity, prudence, justice, fortitude and temperance, and their respective parts.

It has a mass of . Oxygen-16 is the most abundant isotope of oxygen and accounts for 99.762% of oxygen's natural abundance. The relative and absolute abundance of 16O are high because it is a principal product of stellar evolution and because it is a primordial isotope, meaning it can be made by stars that were initially made exclusively of hydrogen. Most 16O is synthesized at the end of the helium fusion process in stars; the triple-alpha process creates 12C, which captures an additional 4He to make 16O. The neon- burning process creates additional 16O. Solid samples (organic and inorganic) for 16O studies are usually stored in silver cups and measured with pyrolysis and mass spectrometry.

The primary is a flare star that shows periodic increases in activity. The primary star in this system spins at a rate 50 times that of the Sun, and consequently has a strong magnetic field. It has a greater number of star spots than the Sun. These can cause the luminosity of the star to appear to vary over each orbital cycle. Measurements of the spin rate of this star at its equator have shown that it varies over time due to the effect of this magnetic field. (The AB Dor Picture Gallery) The system has four components consisting of a pair of binary star systems separated by an angle of about 9‚Ä≥. The binary star AB Doradus Ba/Bb orbits the primary AB Doradus A at an average distance of 135 astronomical units (AUs). AB Doradus C, is a close-in companion that orbits the primary at a distance of 2.3 AU, and has an orbital period of 11.75 years. The latter star is among the lowest-mass stars ever found. At an estimated mass 93 times Jupiter's, it is near the limit of 75‚Äì83 Jupiter masses below which it would be classified as a brown dwarf. This system is a member of the eponymous AB Doradus Moving Group, a loose stellar association of about 30 stars that are all approximately the same age and moving in the same general direction. It is likely that all of these stars formed in the same giant molecular cloud.

Technology  Claude Langlais, the technical director of Ubisoft Montreal, says that modeling is done in 3ds Max for environments and ZBrush for characters.\\"Exclusive: Assassin's Creed Q&A; \\\\- The Scimitar Engine\\" The engine uses Autodesk's HumanIK middleware to correctly position the character's hands and feet in climbing and pushing animations at run-time. Anvil has been improved for Assassin's Creed II. Features added include a full night and day cycle, enhanced draw distance, the same vegetation technology used in Far Cry 2, improved lighting, reflection and special effects, new cloth system, and a new AI and NPC navigation system.\\"Assassin's Creed 2: Engine detailed\\" Assassin's Creed: Lineage short films made by Hybride Technologies (a post-production VFX studio acquired by Ubisoft) and Ubisoft Digital Arts used assets from Anvil to recreate the environment in which the live actors are filmed. In 2012 an updated version was released called AnvilNext; which was developed for Assassin's Creed III and beyond featuring a number of enhancements. Firstly, AnvilNext adds support for a new weather system, which allows for specific weather settings as well as an automatically cycling mode as seen in Assassin's Creed IV. Secondly, the renderer was rewritten for higher efficiency and support for additional post- processing techniques, enabling up to 3,000 non-playable characters to be rendered in real time (compared to the few 100s in the previous Anvil engine). Finally, AnvilNext adds technology from Far Cry 4 to support a more dynamic sandbox environment and new water technology, where the game world could change over time depending on player actions and progression. This means enemy settlements on both land and sea may appear/disappear relating to the events in the game, and water effects could be adjusted accordingly. More importantly, AnvilNext starting with Assassin's Creed Unity is capable of generating structures in a flexible and automatic manner while following specific design rules and templates, which reduces the amount of time and manual effort required for artists and designers to create an intricate urban environment. Specific landmarks, such as the Notre Dame de Paris, are still designed by hand but now could be rendered at an almost 1:1 ratio to its real- life counterpart. AnvilNext also features improved AI for non-playable characters.  Features  The engine received a variety of significant upgrades, including pre-baked Global Illumination, reflection mapping, volumetric fog, dynamic weather, and dynamic foliage to name but a few examples. For Unity there has been a similar upgrade, advanced control mechanics with Physically Based Rendering (PBR) being the stand-out addition, enabling materials, objects and surfaces to look and react more realistically to lighting, shading and shadowing. Furthermore, the Global Illumination system is now more realistic with the addition of volumetric technology, physics-led objects react more realistically, and cloth behaves in a realistic manner on the protagonist, in the environment, and on other characters. The world now supports larger landmasses, more objects, bigger buildings, building interiors that can be accessed without loading screens, and many other additions that enhance visual fidelity, immersion, and the gameplay.

It featured work by writer-artists Neal Adams, Jim Steranko, Johnny Craig, and Wally Wood, writer-editor Stan Lee, and artists John Buscema, Gene Colan, Tom Sutton, Barry Windsor-Smith (as Barry Smith), and Bernie Wrightson. The stories were generally hosted by Digger, a gravedigger; Headstone P. Gravely, in undertaker garb; or one of the artists or writers. After the 10th issue, the title was changed to Creatures on the Loose, publishing a mixture of sword and sorcery features, horror/fantasy reprints, and the science- fiction werewolf feature \\"Man-Wolf.\\" Original series Designed to compete with DC Comics' successful launches of House of Mystery and House of Secrets, Tower of Shadows, like its companion comic Chamber of Darkness, sold poorly despite the roster of artists featured. After its first few issues, the title, published bimonthly, began including reprints of \\"pre-superhero Marvel\\" monster stories and other SF/fantasy tales from Marvel's 1950s and early 1960s predecessor, Atlas Comics. After the ninth issue, the title changed to Creatures on the Loose, and the comic became a mix of reprints and occasional sword and sorcery/SF series. \\"At the Stroke of Midnight\\", writer-artist Jim Steranko's lead story in the premiere issue (Sept. 1969), won a 1969 Alley Award for Best Feature Story. Its creation had led to a rift between the celebrated Steranko and editor Lee that caused Steranko to stop freelancing for Marvel, the publisher that had showcased his highly influential work. Lee had rejected Steranko's cover, and the two clashed over panel design, dialog, and the story title, initially \\"The Lurking Fear at Shadow House\\". According to Steranko at a 2006 panel Dead link; pertinent passages reprinted at and elsewhere, Lee disliked or did not understand the homage to horror author H. P. Lovecraft, and devised his own title for the story. After much conflict, Marvel and freelancer Steranko parted ways. Lee phoned him about a month later, after the two had cooled down, and Steranko would return to produce several covers for Marvel from 1972 to 1973. In a contemporaneous interview, conducted November 14, 1969, Steranko reflected on the tiff: A Lovecraft story, \\"The Terrible Old Man\\", appeared two issues later, adapted by writer Roy Thomas and penciler Windsor-Smith. Additionally, Thomas and Tom Palmer ‚Äì a renowned inker in a rare example of his penciling and inking ‚Äì adapted the Lovecraft story \\"Pickman's Model\\" in issue #9 (Jan. 1971). Marvel also published the all-reprint Tower of Shadows King-Size Special #1 (Dec. 1971). Creatures on the Loose Retitled Creatures on the Loose with issue #10 (March 1971), this version led off with a seven-page King Kull sword-and- sorcery story by Thomas and artist Bernie Wrightson. The book included new stories by artists Herb Trimpe in #11, Syd Shores in #12, and Reed Crandall in #13, then became all-reprint until issue #16 (March 1972). There, writer Thomas and the art team of Gil Kane and Bill Everett introduced the feature \\"Gullivar Jones, Warrior of Mars\\", starring an interplanetary Earthman created by author Edwin L. Arnold in his 1905 book Lieut. Gullivar Jones: His Vacation. Following another issue by Thomas and one by Gerry Conway, science fiction novelist George Alec Effinger wrote the final three installments. Effinger continued as writer for the series that immediately followed, in issue #22 (March 1973): \\"Thongor! Warrior of Lost Lemuria!\\", adapting a sword- and-sorcery barbarian character created by author Lin Carter. Following writers Tony Isabella and Gardner Fox, Carter himself co-wrote (with Steve Gerber) the final two installments.Thongor at the Appendix to the Handbook of the Marvel Universe Thomas, Marvel's associate editor at the time, recalled in 2007 that Thongor had been the company's first choice when Marvel decided to published a licensed fantasy character, rather than the eventual hit Conan the Barbarian. Publisher Martin Goodman \\"authorized us to go after a character. I first went after Lin Carter's Thongor, who was a quasi-Conan with elements of John Carter of Mars, partly became editor-in-chief Stan Lee liked that name the most ... I soon got stalled by Lin Carter's agent on Thongor (he was hoping I'd offer more than the $150 per issue I was authorized to offer), and I got a sudden impulse to go after Conan\\". The title's last series, \\"Man- Wolf\\", starred John Jameson, the werewolf son of Spider-Man supporting character J. Jonah Jameson. It ran from issue #30‚Äì37 (July 1974 -Sept. 1975). Its writers were Doug Moench, Isabella, and David Anthony Kraft, with art by pencilers George Tuska and George P√©rez. The series depicted Jameson as a god to an alien race. The series was finally finished years later in Marvel Premiere #45‚Äì46 (Dec. 1978 and Feb. 1979).

Production This attempt to adapt Goon humour to the big screen was written by Harry Booth, Jon Penington and regular Goon show co-writer Larry Stephens, from a story by Stephens, with additional material by Sellers and Milligan. Emery replaced Harry Secombe, who was too expensive for the film's low budget. The budget of ¬£4,500 was raised from Archway Film Distributors (¬£1,500); Peter Weingreen, who worked with Michael Deeley and Harry Booth on The Adventures of Robin Hood (¬£1,500); and Joseph Sterling, who wanted to direct (¬£1,500). Peter Sellers was paid ¬£900. Release The film was unable to secure a release in the US but screened widely as a supporting short in British cinemas.

Ford started his career in the minor league with Bluefield and Miami in 1975, pitching 52 and 12 innings respectively for the two clubs. In 1976, while playing for Charlotte of the Southern League, he pitched 212 innings, posted a 17-7 record, and had an ERA of 2.50 over 27 games.

Knockengorroch is a world music festival held annually among the Carsphairn hills in Kirkcudbrightshire Scotland. Originally there were two festivals held each year - the World Ceilidh, usually held around the end of May, and The Hairth, held in mid September. As of 2010, Knockengorroch ceased hosting two festivals each year and instead focused its attention on the Knockengorroch World Ceilidh festival. The festival started in 1998 and has licensing for around 3000 fans. The early years In mid-summer 1998 a 'rainbow gathering' was held on the Knockengorroch Farm in Galloway with the agreement of Simon and Liz Holmes. The festival is now an established event in the region. It has grown since its beginnings while still remaining an intimate and hospitable experience, welcoming people from all over Scotland, the UK and beyond for a relaxed, inspiring and riotous four days. The festival has grown from an audience of 300 locals to 2700, including international visitors. The origin of the festival's name is unclear, but in Gaelic ‚Äòknock‚Äô (Cnoc) means a hill and ‚Äògorroch‚Äô has a variety of meanings. The featured artists originate from Celtic, world and roots music genre and the festival has been held in various other locations as the Forest of Ae near Dumfries, and Talnotry near Newton Stewart. Knockengorroch today The festival now takes place in the Dumfries and Galloway hills, in a natural greenfield amphitheatre. The festival features outdoor and covered stages, a dance marquee, a recreated Iron Age Longhouse venue, a Ceilidh, a children‚Äôs marquee and procession, puppet shows, cabaret, fire shows, open mic, workshops, camping, real ale, food and shopping stalls. There is an emphasis on as much environmentally sound practice as possible, with a rigorous recycling policy, use of biodegradable products and alternative sources of power wherever possible, and both green and heritage workshops are available to participate in during the day. The object of Knockengorroch artistic direction is to establish progressive linkage between the celebration of the natural amphitheatre of its venues and the now far- flung Celtic diaspora, once rooted in such homely places. It is Knockengorroch‚Äôs remit not only to celebrate ethnic diversity and fusion, but to make the music home in its natural home. On the still wider contemporary seas of world-music the aim is primarily to promote multi-cultural forms and musical genres, highlighting the connection between roots music and the land that gave birth to that music and its people. Music from all continents is therefore booked alongside the best in Scottish, and European, talent to showcase Celtic and World music in both traditional and contemporary fields. In 2015, Knockengorroch was one of 12 events to be recommended to be funded by Dumfries and Galloway Council's Major Events Strategic Fund. Others on the list included the Eden Festival and the Lockerbie Jazz Festival.

It depicted Margaret Thatcher's second term of office as Prime Minister, but with the politicians shown as British soldiers or Nazi officials, as in a comic of the Second World War. The strip was attributed to Monty Stubble, which was a nom de plume of editor Ian Hislop, and to his artistic collaborator Nick Newman. Publication history The name \\"Monty Stubble\\" is a play on the film-title I Was Monty's Double; the film being based upon the career of M. E. Clifton James, an actor who was employed during the Second World War to impersonate General Montgomery for the purposes of espionage and to confuse the enemy. Battle For Britain appeared in Private Eye between 1983 and 1987. The series ended after the 1987 general election; this was explained by Private Eye as happening because Stubble \\"was tragically lost in action in the last week of the war, believed to have been hit by a stray pencil sharpener\\". The collected strips were then published in book form by Andr√© Deutsch. Synopsis In a tank Herr Thatchler leads the charge; Jock Steel and Doc \\"Killer\\" Owen are helplessly entrenched; and \\"Fatty\\" Heffer looks cynically on as \\"Taffy\\" Kinnock leads the retreat The strip is considered to rank alongside the best to appear in the magazine. It was a satirical presentation of the struggles of the Labour Party opposition led by Neil Kinnock against the Conservative government led by Mrs Thatcher. The style borrowed liberally from Fleetway's War Picture Library comic series, and also D. C. Thomson & Co.'s Commando. In such comics the Germans were typically portrayed as one- dimensional stereotypes, uttering phrases such as \\"Dummkopf\\", \\"Der Teufel\\", \\"Donner und Blitzen\\", \\"Gott in Himmel\\", \\"Schweinhund\\", etc. seemingly spoken in the accents used by Nazi villains in British war films. This was reflected in Battle for Britain. The background There were three groups of protagonists. *The Conservative government is shown as a Fascist regime ruling the \\"Fatherland\\". Margaret Thatcher is depicted as the F√ºhrer, \\"Herr Thatchler\\", a paranoid megalomaniac, served by her grovelling henchmen who include von Gummer (John Gummer), von Tebbit (Norman Tebbit), Helmut Lawson (Nigel Lawson), von Porkinson (Cecil Parkinson‚Äîthe word \\"pork\\" being a play on Parkinson's affair with Sara Keays), Rudolph Hesseltine (a fusion of Michael Heseltine and Rudolf Hess) and Lord Howe-Howe (a play on Geoffrey Howe and Lord Haw-Haw, the wartime collaborator who was hanged for treason). *The Labour Party opposition is portrayed as a platoon of British soldiers referred to as \\"the Marauders\\", battling against superior forces and always being defeated. They are led by the inexperienced Corporal \\"Taffy\\" Kinnock (Neil Kinnock‚Äî\\"taffy\\" is common slang for Welshman) and the turban-wearing \\"Darky\\" Chatterjee (Roy Hattersley, who was MP for Sparkbrook, a multi-racial constituency in Birmingham). The platoon is usually depicted as backbiting, inept, insubordinate and uncooperative, which is the main reason for its constant defeats. Much of Taffy's woe originates among his own followers, especially from left-wingers such as \\"Barmy\\" Benn (Tony Benn) and \\"Fatty\\" Heffer (Eric Heffer), whose \\"cruel cockney humour\\" often has the last word, lowering morale on his own side, and is a feature in almost every instalment. *The SDP-Liberal Alliance (made up of the Social Democratic Party led by David Owen, and the Liberal Party led by David Steel) is referred to as \\"the Allies\\", led by Doc \\"Killer\\" Owen of the paramedics and \\"Wee\\" Jock Steel, the Tartan Terror. As in many satirical presentations (such as Spitting Image), Steel is shown as a weakling overshadowed by the dominant Owen. After failing to impress in the 1987 general election, the two parties merged to form the Liberal Democrats in 1988; the \\"jokey\\" image of the Alliance put across by satirists was a major factor in what was seen as a search for more \\"gravitas\\". The humour The humour in the strip relied heavily on puns and put-downs, with characters often making cynical and unpleasant remarks at others on their own side. \\"Taffy\\" Kinnock in particular is always mocked by \\"Fatty\\" Heffer's cruel cockney humour. Meanwhile, von Gummer and later Jeffroech Archer (Jeffrey Archer) are referred to by Thatchler's other henchmen as \\"Gumkopf\\" and \\"Archcreep schwein\\". Hislop and Newman skilfully portrayed events in contemporary political life in terms of the fictional battle stories as depicted in the comic-books: *By-election campaigns were shown as the liberation of French towns; Chesterfield (1984) became \\"Chester-le-Field\\" and Greenwich (1987) became \\"Greneviche\\". * When government ministers were dismissed from office, Thatchler is shown ordering them to be taken out and shot. *The UK miners' strike (1984‚Äì1985) is shown as \\"Sapper\\" Scargill (Arthur Scargill) leading Taffy's Marauders through some treacherous minefields. *The campaign to abolish the Greater London Council (a body led in 1985 by Ken Livingstone) was fronted by Environment Secretary Patrick Jenkin. Monty Stubble depicted this as The Blitz‚Äîa raid on London led by bomber commander \\"Patroech Junkers\\" (a pun on Junkers Ju 88, a wartime German aircraft), opposed from RAF South Bank (a reference to County Hall, the GLC headquarters on London's South Bank) by Spitfire ace \\"Red\\" Ken (with \\"Red\\" a reference to Livingstone's far-left wing attitude‚Äîand, in real life, a frequent nickname for him). Example Cartoon from 1986 This particular example of the strip was published in Private Eye in July 1986, at about the time when Parliament was about to go into recess. *Labour had just won the Newcastle-under-Lyme by- election.Newcastle-under-Lyme - Description on the BBC website Kinnock (holding the flag) was in the middle of a struggle to assert his authority as party leader in the face of an attempted takeover by the entryist Militant group, and had recently managed to expel leading Militant activist Derek Hatton from the party.On this day: Labour expels Militant Hatton - BBC website Hatton (carrying the bag) is shown with fellow left-wingers (but not Militant members) Tony Benn (in the dress) and Eric Heffer. *The Alliance had failed to gain the seat by about 800 votes. They had complained that the media were not giving them as much coverage as they felt their campaign deserved, which they alleged cost them a famous win. *Thatcher was being heavily criticised by other Commonwealth leaders for her mildly lukewarm support for sanctions against the apartheid regime in South Africa led by President P.W. Botha.South Africa Going Part of the Way - Time Magazine 18 August 1986 *As a result, half the eligible participant countries boycotted the 1986 Commonwealth Games being held in Edinburgh. *The Conservative Party was worried about its standing in the opinion polls, especially as speculation was starting to grow that a general election was likely to be held the following year. Aftermath When the series ended in 1987, it was replaced by Dan Dire, Pilot of the Future?, which took a similar comic-book view of politics. This time, the model was Frank Hampson's artwork for Dan Dare, as seen in the popular 1950‚Äì1969 comic for boys Eagle. In keeping with the science fiction theme, Kinnock became \\"Dan Dire\\" (the questioning title was over whether or not he would ever be Prime Minister); Mrs Thatcher became \\"The Maggon\\" in reference to Dan Dare's arch- enemy The Mekon; and Owen became \\"Doctor Whowen\\", a reference to BBC sci-fi hero Doctor Who.

David Jenkins (1582 ‚Äì 6 December 1663) was a Welsh judge and Royalist during the English Civil War. Jenkins was born at Pendeulwyn (English: Pendoylan), Glamorgan, son of a well-established gentry family. He was educated at St Edmund Hall, Oxford, admitted to Gray's Inn on 5 November 1602 and called to the bar in 1609. In March 1643 he was appointed, against his will, as puisne judge of the Carmarthen circuit of the court of great sessions. He was a strong supporter of the Royalist cause in the civil war and, later that year, was involved in raising money for the siege of Gloucester. He indicted several prominent parliamentarians for high treason. Jenkins was captured by the parliamentarians in December 1645 in Hereford and imprisoned in the Tower of London, Newgate Prison and latterly in Wallingford and Windsor Castles. Whilst in prison in the 1640s, Jenkins wrote a number of political tracts which were collectively published in 1648 as: The Works of the Eminent and Learned Judge Jenkins upon divers Statutes concerning the King's Prerogative and the Liberty of the Subject. Jenkins was brought before parliament in April 1647, but argued that it had no power to try him in the absence of the king. His arguments were expounded in his scholarly work, Lex Terrae Jenkins, David. Lex Terrae (Classics of English legal history in the modern era). Garland 1979 which cited important authorities. The nub of his case, against the legitimacy of parliament in appointing justices and passing laws, was that such acts could only be performed with the explicit authority of the king and that the claim that the king was 'virtually' present in proceedings of the two Houses of Parliament was false. On 22 February 1648, Jenkins was brought to the House of Commons to face charges including the writing of treasonous pamphlets. He refused to kneel at the bar of the house and was fined ¬£1000 for contempt. In 1650 Jenkins was amongst other prisoners that the Rump Parliament considered executing. He said that if he was to go to the scaffold he would be \\"hanged with the Bible under one arm and Magna Carta under the other\\". Jenkins was eventually released in 1657 prior to the restoration of the monarchy. His estate at Hensol had been sequestered in 1652, but he regained it (estimated to be worth ¬£1500 p.a.) and lived there, becoming patron of the bards. He died in 1663 and was buried at Cowbridge. The obituary for Jenkins is apparently the first of its kind in the English- speaking world, published in The Newes on 17 December 1663 by Charles II's Surveyor of the Press, Roger L'Estrange. Part of it read: > \\"... that Eminent, Loyall, and renowned Patriot, Judge Jenkins, Departed > this Life at his House in Cowbridge, [at] 81..in perfect Sence and Memory. > He dyed, as he lived, preaching with his last Breath to his Relations, and > those who were about him, Loyalty to his Majesty, and Obedience to the Lawes > of the Land.

It is the site of the Battle of Athens. The historic site and open-air museum interpret the battle and its aftermath. It is one of the northernmost places in the state. History The once-thriving river village of Athens, Missouri, had up to fifty businesses and a large mill in antebellum times. In July 1861, it was occupied by pro- Union forces of the Missouri Home Guard. Wanting to seize the strategically important village for the Confederacy, elements of the pro-Southern Missouri State Guard attacked on August 5, 1861. Despite being outnumbered by more than 3-to-1, the Home Guard emerged victorious. A small action when compared to other battles, with casualties light, nonetheless it holds the distinction of being the northernmost Civil War battle west of the Mississippi River. Following the battle, many bitter feelings remained among residents. This along with the coming of railroads and less reliance on river shipping sealed the fate of Athens. By the turn of the 20th century Athens was a veritable ghost town. In 1962, remaining area residents worked together to create the Battle of Athens Park, which was donated to the state of Missouri in 1975.

It was notable for its high-performance cars, especially the Type 35 Raceabout. Early history 1916 Mercer 22/72 Touring 1917 Mercer Raceabout There was considerable talent and backing for the Mercer Automobile Company; Ferdinand Roebling, son of John A. Roebling, was the president, and his nephew Washington A. Roebling II was the general manager. The Roeblings had extensive success with wire rope manufacturing and suspension bridge design; engineering was not a recent concept for them. The secretary-treasurer was John L. Kuser, who, with his brothers Frederick and Anthony, had amassed a fortune from banking, bottling and brewing. Washington A. Roebling II was friends with William Walter, who had been making a small number of high-quality automobiles in New York City. The Kusers owned a vacant brewery in Hamilton, New Jersey, and brought Walter and his car factory there in 1906. However, Walter found himself deeply in debt by 1909, so the Roeblings and Kusers bought him out in a foreclosure sale. They changed the company name to Mercer, named after Mercer County, New Jersey. Talented designers and race drivers contributed to the new effort, and the focus became proving their product in competition. Type 35R Raceabout The result was one of the most admired sports cars of the decade; the 1910 Type-35R Raceabout, a stripped-down, two-seat speedster, designed to be \\"safely and consistently\\" driven at over . It was capable of over . The Raceabout's inline 4-cylinder T-head engine displaced and developed at 1,650 revolutions per minute. It won five of the six 1911 races it was entered in, losing only the first Indianapolis 500. Hundreds of racing victories followed. The Raceabout became one of the premier racing thoroughbreds of the era- highly coveted for its quality construction and exceptional handling. In the 1914 road races in Elgin, Illinois, two Raceabouts collided and wrecked. Spencer Wishart, a champion racer who always wore shirt and tie under his overalls, was killed along with the car's mechanic, John Jenter. This prompted the company to cancel its racing program. The Raceabout's designer left the company that year, and subsequent designs did not live up to the glory and appeal the Type-35R had earned. Harold Higgins (far left) and workers, including driver Eddie Pullen - tool room at Mercer Automobile Co., c. 1910. Photo donated by Janelle Higgins Jones Earlier in February 1914, Eddie Pullen, who worked at the factory from 1910, won the American Grand Prize held at Santa Monica, California, by racing for in a Raceabout. Later that same year, Eddie also won The Corona Road Race held in Corona, California, on November 26. For winning the big car event, Pullen won $4,000 and an additional $2,000 for setting a new world road race record. His average speed of broke the record of set by Teddy Tetzlaff at Santa Monica in 1912. A similar model 1913 Mercer Raceabout, known as a Model 35J, is on permanent display at the Simeone Foundation Automotive Museum in Philadelphia, PA, USA. Demise In October, 1919, after the last involved Roebling brother died (Washington A. Roebling II perished in the 1912 Titanic disaster), the company was obtained by a Wall Street firm that placed ex-Packard vice- president Emlem Hare in charge, organizing Mercer under the Hare's Motors corporate banner. Hare looked to expand, increasing Mercer's models and production, and also purchasing the Locomobile & Crane-Simplex marques. Within a few years, the cost of these acquisitions and the economic recession took a financial toll on Hare's Motors. Locomobile was liquidated and purchased by Durant Motors in 1922, and Mercer produced its last vehicles in 1925, after some 5,000 had been built. An independent effort to revive the marque in 1931 resulted in only 3 vehicles being constructed and displayed. The company is currently owned by Schaeffer & Long.

In 1972, in a close vote, students selected the nickname Bearcats over Thoroughbreds as the school mascot along with its present-day colors, royal blue and gold. In 1978, the school relocated to its current campus in eastern Louisville on Springdale Road near Old Brownsboro Road. Since this move, the campus has expanded several times, including the construction of a new upper school building in 2000 and a theatre in 2010. Traditions While KCD has been in existence since 1972, many traditions from its predecessors remain. The school's honor code was adopted from Kentucky Military Institute. The football team's Monohan Field is named after the field at Aquinas Prep. \\"The Rock\\" donated by Jack T. Irwin from the original Locks in Louisville from the Ohio River, is located under the KCD football scoreboard, it is touched by KCD football players before entering the field, just as it was at Aquinas Prep in the 1960s. Graduation ceremonies at KCD involve the senior class carrying roses through the school. In addition, girls wear long white dresses, a tradition from KHS carrying yellow roses, and the boys wear white jackets, a tradition from LCD. A junior class tradition involves the \\"Junior Class Ring Ceremony\\" where each student receives a class ring preceded by a speech from an alumnus. Every student receives a yearly schoolbook, called the Fleur De Lis, a name tracing back to the name of the LCD yearbook. A fleur de lis is affixed to both school's official seals as the French royalty symbol also symbolizes the City of Louisville where the school's campus is located. Academics KCD requires a low student-to-teacher ratio where classrooms are limited to eighteen students. Each grade totals seventy-two students, being proportionally designed to contain four units of eighteen students. Every high school student is required to use a personal computer as the entire campus has a wireless network. KCD became the second high school in Jefferson County to establish this mandate. Several instructional courses provide advanced placement courses, where a majority of students take at least one course. An average of over 11% of junior class students are named National Merit Scholar semifinalists since 2004. As of 2009-10 year some students are taking the Merit Scholar tests for middle-school and high school. The school possesses a Cum Laude Society, a society crafted for vigorous secondary school institutions. As a college preparatory institution, most students take college testing exams and matriculate into post-secondary institutions. Athletics KCD is a member of the Kentucky High School Athletic Association (KHSAA), competing in Class \\"A\\" for the three sports that are classified by enrollment: football, track, and cross country. Several sports, most notably basketball and soccer along with volleyball, baseball, and softball, compete in All \\"A\\" tournaments which serve as de facto state championships for the state's smallest schools, though not officially recognized by the KHSAA. The Bearcat athletic program has garnered 17 Kentucky state championships and 29 state runner-up honors. The most recent state titles include the 2004 field hockey, 2007 All \\"A\\" boys' soccer, and the 2008, 2010, 2012, 2015, 2016, 2017, and 2018 girls' lacrosse teams. State runner-up finishes include field hockey in 2006 and 2007, girls lacrosse in 2006, 2007, and 2009 and boys' tennis in 2001 and 2008. There have been 128 individual state champions (60) and runners-up (68). These state champions include 16 boys' swimming and diving, 18 girls' gymnastics, 5 boys' track and field, 6 girls' swimming and 3 boys' tennis individual medals. The most recent individual state champions include swimmer Will Heyburn (50 freestyle) in 2006 and track and field athlete Marc Speed (discus) in 2009. Arts A minimum of two student performances are conducted annually by both the upper and middle school divisions. Historically, these performances occurred either in the school's commons room (middle school) or at the Clifton Center (upper school), a nearby theater in Louisville from Spring 1980 to Spring 2010. Beginning in Fall 2010, all performances are staged at the new theatre building. Endowment There are several endowments dedicated to the institution and its students. Some of these endowments provide financial assistance, training for faculty, athletic enhancements and improvements regarding school maintenance. The most recent endowment to be announced (May 2009) was a two million dollar grant from the Malone Foundation.

Founded in 1915, the school enrolls 640 students at 2427 Glenmary Avenue. Collegiate is a community rich in history, tradition, innovation and academic excellence. Founded on progressive ideals Collegiate is welcoming, accessible and proud of all of its students who stand out for their exceptional academic preparation, outstanding character and confident leadership. History Louisville Collegiate School opened its doors on September 23, 1915 in a house at 512 West Ormsby Avenue, becoming the first school in Kentucky committed to preparing young women for college. Virginia Perrin Speed (1879‚Äì1968) and her husband William Shallcross Speed (1873‚Äì1955) were the principal founders and sustainers of the school, and are largely responsible for the school's success Needing more land to grow, Collegiate moved in 1927 to its current home on Glenmary Avenue in the historic Highlands, just east of downtown Louisville, in what is now the Lower School. Although the school initially accepted boys in the primary grades, it remained traditionally a girls' school until 1972 when the Lower School became coeducational. In 1980, Collegiate's Board of Trustees established coeducation in the Upper School. To accommodate the increase in enrollment, Willig Hall was built in 1983 to house the Upper School. The first coed class graduated in 1987. As part of the school's Master Plan, Collegiate launched a campaign in 2001 to expand its Upper School because of the growth Collegiate was experiencing. Collegiate expanded its Upper School into a 62,500-square-foot (5,810 m2) building that houses 17 classrooms, seven study areas, three science labs and two computer labs. In 2008, Collegiate launched a Junior Kindergarten. Academics Louisville Collegiate School has a long tradition of academic excellence and creativity within an exceptionally warm and supportive environment. It is divided into a lower school (Jr. Kindergarten- Grade 5), middle school (Grades 6-8), and upper school (Grades 9-12). Each division has its own administrative head and core faculty. Many faculty members teach in more than one division of the school. The students and faculty enjoy the advantages of a small-school environment while benefiting from the stimulation a college preparatory school can provide. The atmosphere at Collegiate is shaped by the close interaction of the student body and a sense of community within the school. Louisville Collegiate School is the only Global Online Academy (GOA) member in the state of Kentucky. Global Online Academy connects students to a global network of people and resources. Students and teachers come from more than sixty of the best independent schools around the world. Just by taking a GOA class, you will meet and collaborate with people you might never otherwise know.

Walden School offers Kindergarten through twelfth grade education. It is the 11th largest K-8 private school in Louisville. The school promotes itself as emphasizing small class sizes, limiting the lower grades to no more than 16 students, and the other grades to 18 students. In practice, the school's classes are usually closer to a dozen students per class in the lower grades. The student/teacher ratio is 8:1 in grades K-8 and in the High School division. History Walden School was founded in 1975 on the former campus of the Kentucky Military Institute on LaGrange Road. The school was founded by Dr. Edward F. Vermillion, a former principal in the Oldham County school district and a member of the Anchorage School Board. Though the 1970s was a time of great experiments in education, Dr. Vermillion said that he wanted to take the best parts of traditional education, but to combine them some of the gentler aspects of more experimental techniques. \\"At Walden,\\" he said, \\"we've married the traditional school to concepts of love, compassion.\\"The Voice, September 16, 1976. Vermillion's obituary in 2004 noted that the school \\"stresses a nurturing environment, small classes, a college-preparatory curriculum and parental involvement.... In its early days, the school was noted for its unorthodox teaching methods -- one shop class learned carpentry by building its own classroom out of an old Quonset hut. A history class studied the first Thanksgiving by re-creating it in a meadow.\\" The school was named Walden after the classic work by Henry David Thoreau. Thoreau's 1854 book Walden; or, Life in the Woods is about his experiences living in a cabin he built near Walden Pond for 2 years, 2 months, and 2 days. Henry inspired many of the school's ideas and beliefs, and many of his quotes are painted on the walls. The Walden School is now housed on Westport Road, near Hubbards Lane. The school moved into a building that was once a public school, Stivers Elementary, after it closed in 1980. Two large expansions have been added on to the older building by the school, including a gym and high school, dedicated in February 2004, cost $1.8 million. The second addition, a library and music hall, was added in March of 2019. Sports In October 2010, Walden dedicated a new track and field facility, designed to be one of the premier tracks in the state, including several state-of-the-art features. Walden's decision to invest in this facility reflects the school's high participation rate in the sport. About 70 percent of Walden's middle school students, and about 50 percent of its high school students participate in the school's competitive track and field teams. (Lower School students also participate in track and field \\"clinics.\\")The Walden Ponder, 2011. Tuition Walden's average tuition ranks as one of the highest in the LISC association schools, mostly due to its small size. About 30 percent of Walden's students received financial aid. Walden has approximately 300 students throughout all grades, with an actual capacity of 312 total in the Lower and Middle Schools and 100 in the High School. Academics Walden is divided into three divisions. The Lower School serves K-4th grade, the Middle School serves 5th through 8th grade, and the High School serves 9th through 12th grade. All three divisions emphasize strong academics, according to the school's website. Walden High School teachers are certified to teach 18 Advanced Placement program courses, designed to prepare a student to do college-level work. Walden Students *Demonstrate a willingness to work hard *Appreciate and respect diversity in classmates *Are college-bound and motivated *Respond well to personal attention from teachers *Are of average to above-average ability *Are respectful and demonstrate sensitivity to others *Thrive in an environment with encouragement to make good choices In 2009, 94 percent of Walden students earned a 3 or higher, including 100 percent of the students taking Science, Human Geography and European History exams; of the students taking Physics, Calculus AB and Calculus BC exams, 100 percent scored a five.The Walden Ponder, Winter 2010. In the 2015-2016 academic year, 75 percent of Walden high school students had taken at least one AP exam. In 2009, according to the website, Lower School students taking the Stanford Achievement Test averaged in the 81st percentile in Reading and Math, and the 85th percentile in Science. This means that Walden students scored in the top 19 percent nationally in Reading and Math and in the top 15 percent in Science. That same year, the school reported that about half of their middle school students scored in the 95th percentile (or above) in at least one of the Stanford Achievement subtests (math, reading, science or social studies) and qualified for the Johns-Hopkins Center for Talented Youth Program. Louisville Magazine 2016-'17 School Guide reported that 100 percent of Walden High School students take the ACT, with an average score of 25.5. This was the second-highest score listed for any school in which all students took the test. Traditions In Walden's 40-plus years, it has developed several traditions. They include: * \\"Beatrix Potter Tea Party\\" for Kindergarten Students. * Sit-down Thanksgiving dinner, in which the entire school eats at the same time.

The name comes from the way that a pencil could naturally be drawn along these corners. It is sometimes called a rolling ball toolpath. Often a constant step-over passes are derived from single pencil pass to create parallel pencil passes that are very good for cleaning up corners and fillets where excess material remains from a bigger cutter.  Generating pencil toolpaths  There are several alternative algorithms for generating pencil passes.http://www.cnccookbook.com/CCCAMToolpaths.htm The method most commonly published in the academic literature involves creating tool surface offsets of the model surfaces and intersecting them to find the common line where the cutter would be in contact with two surfaces at once. An example of this implementation uses the ZMap method described by Park, et al. The industrial method, used in commercial CAM software, differs substantially and works by detecting double-contact points and linking them up into a chain to form a toolpath. A double-contact point is a pair of cutter locations displaced by a tiny distance horizontally, but with a large difference in height or sudden change in contact point. These positions can be located very precisely by binary subdivision, where a cutter location created between a pair of close cutter locations will almost always be continuous with one or the other side.

He was the first technical advisor on the rules and supervisor of officials for the National Football League (NFL) from 1938 to 1952. He was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1966. Early years Ray was born in Highland Park, Illinois, in 1884. He was the son of John Thompson Ray and Emily S. (Light) Ray. He attended the Crane Manual Training High School in Chicago. He began his college education at Lewis Institute (now part of the Illinois Institute of Technology) from 1901 to 1903. He next attended the University of Illinois where he received a bachelor of science degree in mechanical engineering. He played baseball, football, and basketball at Illinois and was captain of the 1905‚Äì06 Illinois Fighting Illini men's basketball team. Ray also reportedly beat University of Chicago football star Walter Eckersall in a 100-yard dash while attending Illinois. According to his biography at the Pro Football Hall of Fame, Ray was five feet, six inches tall and weighed only 136 pounds. Teaching and officiating career After graduating from the University of Illinois, Ray served as the athletic director at the Smith Academy in St. Louis from 1907 to 1908. In 1909, he was hired as a mechanical drawing instructor at Wendell Phillips High School in Chicago. He continued teaching mechanical drawing in Chicago high schools for more than 30 years. In addition to his work as a teacher, Ray worked as a football official in Big Ten Conference games in the 1920s and 1930s. He also officiated in basketball and baseball games. Ray helped organize the Athletic Officials Association (AOA) and organized rules clinics and written tests that were mandatory for members of the AOA. He was also the author of the high school football code and invented and copyrighted the \\"Play Situation Book\\" now called the \\"Case Book\\" The \\"Play Situations Book\\" taught the Officials, Coaches, and Players the rules through example and standardized their implementation. According to the Pro Football Hall Of Fame, \\"many experts concede that Shorty did much to save the game during the dark days [in the 1920s] when football was under a cloud of mounting injuries, outmoded rules, haphazard officiating and draggy contests.\\" NFL technical adviser George Halas persuaded the NFL to hire Ray in 1938 to rewrite its rules book and train its officials. In 1947, Ray was given a five-year contract as Technical Advisor on the Rules and Supervisor of Officials to the NFL and resigned from the Chicago public schools to devote his full efforts to his job with the NFL. He served as a technical adviser to the NFL and supervisor of officials until his retirement in 1952. Ray has been credited with making the forward pass \\"an effective weapon by redesigning the ball.\\" Ray also sought to increase the speed of play. He said, \\"The faster you play, the more plays you create.\\" He directed officials to be prompt in recovering the ball and getting it into play again and insisted that the 30 seconds allowed to put the ball in play be strictly enforced. With Ray's emphasis on faster play, the average number of plays per touchdown decreased from 48 in 1938 to 24 in 1945. Ray was also responsible for numerous rules changes, including the following: * He changed the rules so that an incomplete pass was not a loss to the passing team. * He developed the rule that the clock stops from the moment an incomplete pass hits the ground until play resumes. Ray's biography at the Pro Football Hall of Fame calls him pro football's \\"unknown hero\\" who \\"helped save an often-unexciting game from extinction.\\" According to that biography, \\"Shorty insisted his officials became absolute masters of the rules book. He gave them written tests and demanded that they score better than 95 percent every time. George Halas said in 1949 that his role in hiring Ray was \\"my greatest contribution to the National Football League,\\" and later said of Ray: \\"He was the smartest man in rules ever. He was a genius.\\" In his later years, however, Ray was criticized for becoming overly technical, \\"inundating his officials with memoranda,\\" urging them to speed up play, call all fouls, and stop the clock. Under his guidance to speed up play, the NFL played a record 10,451 plays during the 1947 NFL season. However, penalties also increased to an average of 13 per game in 1951. Frustrated with the growing rate of penalties, a group of owners sought to have Ray fired, but loyalists including George Halas defended Ray. Ray resigned as the NFL's technical adviser in May 1952; he said at the time that he no longer felt he could physically do the job. Family, later years and posthumous honors Ray was married to Charlotte Johnson (sometimes known as \\"Lottie\\") in October 1908. They had four children: Charlotte (born 1912), Hugh Jr. (born 1913), Edith Virginia (born 1918), and Mary Jane (born 1921). Ray moved to Los Angeles after retiring from his position with the NFL. He died at a sanitarium there in September 1956 after suffering a cerebral hemorrhage at age 72. He was buried in Chicago. In March 1966, Ray was posthumously elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame as part of its fourth class of inductees. At the induction ceremony in September 1966, Ray's son, Hugh L. Ray Jr., accepted the honor on his father's behalf. To the present day, Ray is the only inductee in the Hall of Fame for contributions to officiating. In 2014, Ray's grandson, James W.

In 2005, he became an emeritus professor of politics at the University of Oxford and an emeritus fellow of St Antony's College, Oxford, where he served as a professor of politics and director of St Antony's Russian and East European Centre. He has written widely on Soviet and Russian politics, on communist politics more generally, on the Cold War, and on political leadership.  Career  Brown was born in Annan, Scotland, and educated at Annan Academy and at Dumfries Academy, before studying as both undergraduate and graduate student at the London School of Economics (LSE). He taught at the University of Glasgow from 1964 to 1971, during which time he was a British Council exchange scholar at Moscow State University for the academic year 1967-68.Archie Brown's St Antony's College Biography He has been a visiting professor at Yale University, the University of Connecticut and Columbia University. He was also a visiting professor and holder of the Frank C. Erwin, Jr. Centennial Chair of Government at the University of Texas, Austin. In 1998, he was a distinguished visiting fellow of the Helen Kellogg Institute for International Studies at the University of Notre Dame in Indiana. At Oxford University, Brown was university lecturer in Soviet institutions from 1971 until 1989, when he became professor of politics. He held that position from 1989 to 2005. Concurrently, he was a sub- warden of St Antony's College between 1995 and 1997 and director of the Russian and East European Centre twice (from 1991 to 1994, and again from 1998 to 2001). He was director of graduate studies in politics for Oxford University between 2001 and 2003.  Publications  Brown has written and edited numerous books on Soviet and Communist politics, and his articles have covered a wide range of subjects, including the end of the Cold War, British politics, post-Soviet Russian politics, political leadership, political culture, and 18th-century political and social thought. Several of his books deal with the Soviet perestroika and the role of Mikhail Gorbachev in the transformation of the Soviet system and the ending of the Cold War. They focus both on the power of ideas and on the power of institutions, putting Gorbachev's innovative leadership in its political context. For The Gorbachev Factor (1996), the Political Studies Association of the UK awarded Brown the W.J.M. Mackenzie Prize for \\"best political science book of the year\\". That book also shared the Alec Nove Prize of the British Association for Slavonic and East European Studies (BASEES) for \\"best book or article in any discipline on Russia, Communism or Postcommunism\\". In Seven Years that Changed the World: Perestroika in Perspective (2007; paperback 2008), Brown returned to these themes, making use of new and extensive archival material, including the records of Soviet Politburo meetings. Archie Brown's book, The Rise and Fall of Communism (2009; UK paperback 2010; US paperback 2011) deals with communism worldwide ‚Äì from its 19th-century origins to the fall of communism in Europe in 1989 and its adaptation and mutation in China. This book earned Brown the 2010 Mackenzie Prize of the Political Studies Association, making him the recipient of \\"best political science book of the year\\" award for a second time. It also won the Nove Prize awarded by BASEES. In addition to its separate American, British and Canadian editions, the work has been published in translation in nine other countries. Brown followed that with a still broader comparative-historical book ‚Äì on political leadership worldwide since the dawn of the 20th century ‚Äì The Myth of the Strong Leader: Political Leadership in the Modern Age (2014; paperback, 2015). Bill Gates named it as one of the five best books he read in 2016.https://www.gatesnotes.com/About- Bill-Gates/Best-Books-2016?WT.mc_id=00_00_00_share_em Compare: https://www.gatesnotes.com/Books/The-Myth-of-the-Strong-Leader It has been translated into Arabic, Chinese (Taiwan), Czech, German, Japanese, Korean, Russian and Spanish. His most recent book addresses the part played by political leadership in ending the Cold War. The Human Factor: Gorbachev, Reagan, and Thatcher, and the End of the Cold War was published in 2020. Honours Elected a Fellow of the British Academy (FBA) in 1991, Brown chaired the Academy's Political Studies Section from 1999 to 2002 and was a member of the Council of the British Academy, 2014‚Äì2017. In 1999 he was chosen as a founding member of the Academy of Social Sciences, and he has been an international honorary member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences since 2003. He was appointed as a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George (CMG) in the Queen's Birthday Honours list in 2005 \\"for services to UK- Russian relations and to the study of political science and international affairs\\". In 2010 he became one of three scholars to receive the Diamond Jubilee Award for Lifetime Achievement in Political Studies.

He previously became both Archbishop of Munich and Freising and a cardinal in 1977. He resigned as archbishop in early 1982, in light of his new duties as prefect. While continuing to be prefect, Ratzinger was promoted within the College of Cardinals to become cardinal bishop of Velletri-Segni in 1993, and became the College's vice-dean in 1998 and dean (senior cardinal) in 2002. He was elected Pope Benedict XVI in 2005, becoming pope emeritus on his retirement in 2013. Role in the 1980s In office, Cardinal Ratzinger fulfilled his institutional role, defending and reaffirming official Catholic doctrine, including teaching on topics such as birth control, homosexuality, and inter-religious dialogue. During his period in office, the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith took disciplinary measures against some outspoken liberation theologians in Latin America in the 1980s and Jesuit priest Anthony de Mello. In 1983, he issued the Declaration on Masonic Associations which drew on Clarification concerning status of Catholics becoming Freemasons (itself issued by the Congregation 9 months before his becoming its prefect). The Congregation condemned liberation theology twice (in 1984 and 1986), accusing it of Marxist tendencies and of inciting hate and violence. Leonardo Boff, for example, was suspended, while others were reputedly reduced to silence. Cardinal Ratzinger also upheld the teaching against the ordination of women and stated that it belonged to the deposit of the faith, meaning that it was beyond the jurisdiction of any pope to change it. From 1986 to 1992 he presided over the drafting committee that wrote the Catechism of the Catholic Church, along with Jos√© Manuel Estepa Llaurens, William Joseph Levada and Estanislao Esteban Karlic with Christoph Sch√∂nborn, O.P. serving as the secretary of the group. Archives of the Holy Office Many saw in a contrasting light Ratzinger's planning and overseeing of the opening of the long-sealed Inquisition archives, making available at the beginning of 1998 all materials up to the 1903 death of Pope Leo XIII. However, the lag behind availability of other Vatican archives (at that point open up to the 1922 death of Pope Benedict XV and, since Ratzinger became Pope himself, up to the 1939 death of Pope Pius XI), has led to some criticism; it is still unclear what the Vatican's plan for future accessibility to post-1903 Holy Office archives is, nothing having been said since 1998 regarding whether and when they will be made available to scholars. Dominus Iesus In 2000, the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith published a document entitled Dominus Iesus, which reaffirmed the historic doctrine and mission of the Church to proclaim the Gospel. The document, in paragraph 4, pointed out the danger to the Church of relativistic theories which seek to justify religious pluralism by denying that God has revealed truth to humanity. Paragraph 22, addressing the question that one religion is as good as another (syncretism or indifferentism), states, \\". . . followers of other religions can receive divine grace, it is also certain that objectively speaking they are in a gravely deficient situation in comparison with those who, in the Church, have the fullness of the means of salvation.The deliberate omission of the \\"filioque\\" clause (\\"and the Son\\"), an article of Catholic Faith, in the first paragraph is seen by some as an outreach to the Greek Orthodox Church which has been in conflict with the Latin Catholic Church over its addition to the Nicene Creed for about one thousand years, although the Filioque clause confirms the inherent ordered nature of The Blessed Trinity,\\"The Filioque: A Church-dividing Issue? An agreed statement of the North American Orthodox- Catholic Theological Consultation\\", North American Orthodox-Catholic Theological Consultation, October 25, 2003. German abortion case After the German reunification the united German government decided to merge the abortion laws. It would be legal within the first twelve weeks of pregnancy but only after the woman received counseling on her decision. If she still decided to proceed she would have to present a certificate saying she had completed the counseling sessions. The German Bishops' Conference established counseling centres that saw 20,000 women. After being counseled, roughly 5,000 decided not to have the abortion. In 1997 Pope John Paul II ordered the German bishops to withdraw the counseling support. Cardinal Ratzinger, as prefect of the Congregation for the Faith, was given the task of carrying out John Paul's instructions. In 1999 the German bishops unanimously rejected the demands of the CDF. Only in 2000 did the bishops conference end the counseling service. Lutheran Dialogue His most significant ecumenical achievement as CDF Prefect was the Joint Declaration on the Doctrine of Justification signed with the Lutheran World Federation in 1999. Bishop George Anderson, head of the Evangelical Lutheran Church of America, publicly acknowledged that it was ‚ÄòRatzinger who untied the knots‚Äô when it looked as though the document would be shipwrecked by officials from the Pontifical Council for Promoting Christian Unity. Cardinal Ratzinger got the agreement back on track by organising a meeting with the Lutheran leaders at his brother‚Äôs house in Regensburg. Included in this agreement was the notion that the goal of the ecumenical process is unity in diversity, not structural reintegration. Ratzinger and Fatima Until her death, L√∫cia dos Santos, the last surviving of the three Fatima visionaries, was forbidden to discuss the Fatima revelations publicly unless given leave by Cardinal Ratzinger. He was one of seven people known to have read the actual Third Message put into writing in 1944, and is the author of the Theological Commentary on the Third Message, published with the message itself in 2000. In 1984, an interview with Ratzinger was published in the Pauline Sisters newsletter which stated that the message deals with \\"dangers threatening the faith and the life of the Christian and therefore of the world\\", while stating that it marks the beginning of the end-times. A year later, the interview was re-published in The Ratzinger Report, although several statements were omitted. In October 1987 he stated that \\"the things contained in [the] Third Secret correspond to what has been announced in Scripture and has been said again and again in many other Marian apparitions; first of all, that of Fatima in what is already known of what its message contains, conversion and penitence are the essential conditions for salvation\\". In 1997, Ratzinger and Capovilla publicly denied a rumor that the Third Message was being withheld for fears it would condemn the changes of the Vatican II council. On June 26, 2000, following the release of the text of the prophecy, Ratzinger issued a statement that the third and final chapter of Mary's prophecy had been fulfilled in 1981 in a failed attempt on Pope John Paul's life. He was quoted in the media as stating, \\"No great mystery is revealed; nor is the future unveiled. A careful reading of the text will probably prove disappointing.\\" Response to sex abuse scandal As Cardinal Ratzinger was Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith (CDF), the sexual abuse of minors by priests was his responsibility to investigate from 2001, when that charge was given to the CDF by Pope John Paul II.Jamie Doward, \\"The Pope, the letter and the child sex claim,\\" The Guardian, April 24, 2005. Before given this charge, Cardinal Ratzinger was theoretically privy to all sexual abuse cases within the Church. As Prefect of the CDF, Canon Law directed Bishops to report sexual abuse cases involving priests in their diocese to Cardinal Ratzinger. However, due to the obscurity of canon Law, even within the Church, it is unknown whether this directive was actually followed. As part of the implementation of the norms enacted and promulgated on April 30, 2001 by Pope John Paul II,Sacramentorum sanctitatis tutela, The Vatican, April 30, 2001. on May 18, 2001 Ratzinger sent a letter to every bishop in the Catholic Church.Epistula ad totius Catholicae Ecclesiae Episcopos aliosque Ordinarios et Hierarchas interesse habentes de delictis gravioribus eidem Congregationi pro Doctrina Fidei reservatis, The Vatican, May 18, 2001.CONGREGATION FOR THE DOCTRINE OF THE FAITH - LETTER - sent from the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith to Bishops of the entire Catholic Church and other Ordinaries and Hierarchs having an interest - REGARDING THE MORE SERIOUS OFFENSES reserved to the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, Unofficial English translation of original Latin.

Josie Trent Born on July 28, 1988, Josie Trent (Emma Taylor-Isherwood) is a human whirlwind, skate-punk-girl and the fire behind the Science Club. She is driven by intense curiosity, a determination to rebel against authority, and a need to seem independent. Josie also happens to be very good at science. Josie has never been close to her mother, Kelly Trent, whose top-secret job drives a wedge between them, and she hasn't been told much about her father. Because of this, she finds it difficult to let her guard down and to trust people. Despite the distance between them, however, mother and daughter do love each other. Josie's rebellious nature causes a great deal of trouble; it results in frequent conflict with Principal Durst and puts a strain on her friendship with roommate Corrine Baxter. Coupled with her curiosity, Josie's disregard and distrust for authority spurs her on to get to the bottom of the Blake Holsey mystery. She would sacrifice almost anything to discover what Victor Pearson is really up to. However, Josie generally wishes to do good through her actions, to be a hero and not merely a rebel. She has a volatile relationship with Vaughn Pearson, the son of Victor Pearson. She is pulled by the strings of trust and distrust. Since the Brainwaves episode, Josie's relationship with Lucas Randall has become more complicated. While it's clear that she does care for Lucas at least as a friend, his attempts to sabotage Vaughn irk her. Lucas also has a crush on her. Josie and Vaughn have been part of the strange things happening around Blake Holsey. After Vaughn was caught with her Chi Ball, Vaughn and Josie had exchanged intelligence and then memories. Vaughn gained enhanced intelligence, but returned it back to Josie with a kiss, when it became apparent he was actually sucking the energy out of her brain - nearly killing her. Josie gained a number of specific memories from Vaughn, including a repressed one from infancy, when Sarah Lynch gave Vaughn a pendant which Victor was to hold onto until the proper time. The pendant was the key to a holographic message to Vaughn that could only be opened using the biometrics of Josie and Vaughn. Josie and Vaughn learned that they have the same DNA helix. When Josie thought Vaughn went into the wormhole to find his mother, she went after him, but landed in the past, when Blake Holsey High was newly built. She was later rescued by the student Science Club members, but Vaughn was temporarily stranded in 1977. Josie went after him and brought him back to the present. Josie decided to use the wormhole to travel back to the past, before Victor Pearson and Sarah Lynch used the Chi Ball in Pearadyne. Josie took the Chi Ball and returned to the future, hoping something good will come out of it. She was dead wrong. It turned out that Blake Holsey High was abandoned, the students and teachers were gone, and only she was left in this alternate reality of the future of her timeline, observed by the Janitor, and Josie's Clone. For over a year, Josie was trapped in the alternate world, where she found the pendant that Sarah Pearson left behind in the past. Josie was eventually rescued by her clone, who traded places with her in the universe. Josie returned to her world and learned that Andreas Avenir is her father. She managed to stop him and his evil plot. At the end of everything, Josie meets up with her mother who's very excited to see her. Corrine Baxter The daughter of a psychiatrist and a neurosurgeon, Corrine Baxter (Shadia Simmons) enrolled at Blake Holsey High in 2000. Corrine describes herself in \\"Wormhole\\" as a Science Geek with a 172 IQ whose main contributions to the Science Club are her amazing intellect, which she uses to rationalize the weird things that are going on, and her steadying influence in trying to keep the Science Club out of trouble. She considers herself a perfectionist, but her roommate Josie Trent prefers the term \\"neat freak\\" ‚Äì in Corrine's world, there's a place for everything, and if everything is not in its place, there's trouble. Her frequently rigid-seeming personality causes clashes with Josie, who takes a much more relaxed view of neatness, homework, rules and almost everything Corrine stands for. This does not stop them from being best friends, though, and despite the wobbles and upsets, Corrine will usually try to help Josie out whenever she can. Corrine likes to do things her way, and is not big on compromising her vision - she insists on getting the highest grades and keeping her permanent record clean, and has a very strong competitive streak. However, her respect for authority generally makes her polite and helpful. Corrine appears to put herself under a lot of pressure - she assumes that her parents expect her to be perfect and failing to achieve that will be letting them down. She eventually learns in the episode \\"Equation\\" that her parents have no intention of pressuring her directly. Corrine is the first member of the school's Science Club to enter the wormhole and travel in time. Arriving just before the accidental explosion at Pearadyne Labs, Corrine sees Sarah Lynch behave somewhat ruthlessly in her attempt to get back to the future. To stop Corrine from remembering what she saw, Sarah uses a device to erase that part of her memory. Corrine is then rescued and brought back to the present by Josie Trent and Professor Z. Although it takes a while for her to admit it, Corrine has a romantic interest in Marshall. When Corrine goes to a mirror universe where Blake Holsey High is a school for the Arts, she shares a kiss with the Marshall of that universe. During this experience she learns that she need not be rigidly \\"left-brained\\" in her approach to life. After Josie's disappearance, Corrine is left without a roommate. Her boyfriend Marshall is also gone, having been taken out of Blake Holsey in the general panic over the missing student. However, Corrine maintains contact with Marshall and consoles with Vaughn Pearson through this time. When she learns that Avenir wants Vaughn to bring him the floating Chi Ball, Corrine takes the ball herself and hides it, hoping to prevent further trouble. However, when Vaughn explains that this is his only chance to find his mother, Corrine gives Vaughn the ball, and asks him not to forget who his friends are. Following Avenir's extermination by Josie, Corrine plans to go to university and possibly backpack through Europe. Lucas Randall A bit of a conspiracy theorist, Lucas Randall (Michael Seater) suspects that there is something deeply strange about Blake Holsey High long before his best friend and roommate, Marshall Wheeler, or the third member of the school Science Club, Corrine Baxter. Lucas claims to have once seen a woolly mammoth in the school's swimming pool, but the others don't believe him. Of all the members of the Science Club, Lucas is the most driven in his determination to discover the school's secrets. He is an excellent chess player, but not very good (or at least unlucky) at Hearts. Lucas is the last person to see Professor Middleton before Middleton disappears at midnight, during which Lucas see a strange light shining through Middleton's door. When Josie Trent arrives at Blake Holsey, she quickly comes up with a theory that Middleton disappeared through a vortex or black hole. They soon discover the wormhole in the science office, after which Lucas starts referring to the school as Black Hole High. Smart and tall but athletically hopeless, Lucas is regularly picked on by Stew Kubiak and other school bullies. At one point, Lucas is impatient to grow up and no longer have to deal with such indignities ‚Äì and he gets his wish. Lucas temporarily becomes an adult after being bitten by a mayfly, which has an exceedingly short lifespan. This \\"adult\\" Lucas, played by Andrew Tarbet of The Famous Jett Jackson, poses as a substitute math professor, hangs out with Principal Amanda Durst, and even berates Victor Pearson for not treating Durst with more respect. Lucas lacks confidence in his love life, except during one wormhole-assisted bout of bravery, during which he suavely secures a date with a beautiful new student from Italy, even speaking to her in Italian. However, she is not Lucas's main love interest. Clearly smitten with Josie, Lucas shows considerable jealousy toward Vaughn Pearson, who has an on again, off again relationship with her. This fuels Lucas's suspicion that the younger Pearson is involved in the clandestine activities of his father, Victor Pearson. Nevertheless, Lucas saves Josie and even occasionally Vaughn from disaster. It is Lucas who finds a way to bring Josie back into sync with normal time after her time-slowing watch breaks, and it is Lucas who casts the deciding vote to allow Vaughn to return his mother's pendant to her in the mysterious holographic device from the future. Most of the time, however, Lucas is highly suspicious of both Vaughn and Victor. Lucas lies about his father's availability in order to stay at Blake Holsey over a school break, so that he can investigate the school, the Pearsons and the wormhole with less interference. During this investigation he finds himself back in Middleton's office, learns of a tesseract device, and sees Middleton's disappearance firsthand. Despite the tesseract incident, Lucas has a good relationship with his own father, and often goes fishing with him when not at school. After Josie's disappearance, Lucas never gives up on finding her and bringing her home. When Josie's clone allows herself to be trapped in a pocket universe in order to free Josie, Lucas becomes determined to find a way to rescue the clone as well. He eventually decides to become Z's sidekick and stay at Blake Holsey High. Marshall Wheeler Marshall Wheeler (Noah Reid) is extremely smart, witty, and enlightened student at Blake Holsey High. He is passionate about science and loyal to his friends. Marshall is also sensitive and compassionate. He has a moral code of his own: he does not mind breaking the rules, however he is against lying and cheating. He believes that the perils and odd occurrences at Blake Holsey are best faced together, rather than different members of the Science Club acting on their own. Despite this, Marshall sometimes feels unappreciated and ignored by others. On one occasion, these feelings manifest in Marshall becoming invisible. Much of this insecurity stems from his feeling eclipsed by his older brother, Grant Wheeler, who happens to be more popular, talented, good looking, and intelligent than Marshall. When Grant visits the school on the day of his job interview at Pearadyne, Marshall's feelings cause him (and eventually Grant) to take on properties of different elements in their ascending order on the Periodic Table. A talented musician and keyboard player, Marshall becomes the frontman for the local three-piece rock band Magnet 360. Marshall is also an ambitious entrepreneur, selling modified cell phones and networking computers to raise money for college. Unfortunately, these attempts to earn some cash usually backfire rather badly. Corrine describes him as a person who is especially good at chemistry and somewhat of a hustler, but doesn't talk about his emotions often. Marshall develops a romantic relationship with Corrine Baxter, but resents it when she tries to overschedule their time together. In another universe where Blake Holsey teaches the fine arts, Marshall's counterpart praises Corrine's \\"great look\\", and kisses her before she returns home. The incident teaches her to take a more relaxed, less regimented approach in her relationship with the Marshall of this universe. After Josie Trent disappears down the wormhole and does not return, Marshall is taken out of Blake Holsey by his parents and placed in another school. However, he still maintains contact with Lucas and Corrine. He returns to visit his friends at their graduation and so is present when Josie returns, he is with his pals when Josie obliterates Avenir. When Corrine contemplates backpacking through Europe before attending university, he suggests that he join her, which Corrine welcomes. Vaughn Pearson Born on June 17, 1987, Vaughn Pearson (Robert Clark) is the son of Victor Pearson and Sarah Lynch Pearson, both of whom attended Blake Holsey High before becoming scientists at Pearadyne Labs. His mother disappeared in an explosion at Pearadyne on October 4, 1987, and was presumed dead. Following Sarah's disappearance, Victor brought up Vaughn on his own. Whereas his parents displayed prowess in academic subjects such as science, Vaughn expressed more interest in sports such as football, softball and wrestling. Victor often pressures both Vaughn and the teaching staff of the school to improve Vaughn's performance in all of his subjects, and this may be one of the reasons that his father has almost always kept Vaughn at arm's length. It is unknown whether or not Victor knows that Vaughn suffers from dyslexia. Vaughn develops into a popular male student at Blake Holsey High, but also something of a bully, making snide remarks in passing about members of the Science Club in particular. Following the arrival of Josie Trent at the school in 2002, Vaughn accidentally peeks at Josie's journal, which mentions suspected wormhole activity on the school grounds, as well as the accident at Pearadyne labs that killed Vaughn's mother. Vaughn informs his father of this, who orders Vaughn to steal Josie's journal and bring it to him. Vaughn reluctantly does so, but it is stolen out of his bag by the Janitor. Victor then asks Vaughn to join the Science Club to spy on Josie and the other students, and report back to him. Vaughn initially does not like the idea of being a member of the Science Club at all, much less to spy on his classmates. He eventually warms to the Club as he witnesses the interesting consequences of life on top of a wormhole, which he would not have been aware of otherwise. His participation in the Club's activities and discussions, as well as friendships with each of its members, boost his self-esteem. Longing to learn more about his mother, Vaughn travels through time, using the wormhole, to 1977, followed by Josie. There, Vaughn meets the future Principal Durst, as well as his parents as teenagers, before they met each other. But when he takes something to remind him of his mother, he accidentally creates a grandfather paradox and changes the course of history, as Victor would never meet Sarah, and Vaughn would never be born. Vaughn returns to normal reality when Josie is able to set everything right. Though he continues to relay conversations that took place in the Science Club, Vaughn develops a friendship with Lucas Randall, as Vaughn admits that he envied Lucas and Marshall Wheeler being roommates. In a show of friendship, Lucas gave him cheat codes to a computer game that they play. Vaughn manages to keep his conflicting feelings about his father and his friends to himself until they manifest as a series of storms directly above his head. As the Science Club come to realize that he is hiding something, Vaughn is forced to admit that he had stolen Josie's journal and told his father about their conversations. Lucas never fully trusts Vaughn again. Vaughn and Lucas come to a better understanding of each other's lives, however, after they switch bodies as the result of one of Lucas' experiments. They discover and deal with each other's strengths and weaknesses until Marshall and Professor Z fix the device that caused the problem and switch them back. While in Lucas's body, Vaughn is finally able to read easily, without having dyslexia, and shares a kiss with Josie in a scene from Romeo and Juliet. Vaughn's relationship with Josie later elevates above the platonic level. After a date with Josie, Vaughn insists to his father that Josie is not a threat to him, but Victor reveals the floating Chi Ball, saying that Josie wants it. Vaughn cancels his next date with Josie to learn more about the ball, but Josie uses her time-slowing stopwatch to allow her enough time to switch the floating Ball with the ordinary one from her room. This brings tension and distrust between Vaughn and Josie, as well as the rest of the Science Club (and especially Lucas), as Vaughn neglected to tell them about the Ball. Josie does not learn until her series of \\"waking dreams\\", which happen to be Vaughn's memories, that Vaughn was defending her when Victor had showed him the Floating Ball. By that time, Vaughn has moved out of his dormitory and back into his home. He is, however, able to convince Lucas to come back to the Science Club. On October 4, 2004, the 17th anniversary of the Pearadyne accident, a device comes through a wormhole in the sky and lands on the grounds of Blake Holsey. The device opens when Josie touches it, and is activated when Vaughn touches it. It contains a holographic message from Vaughn's mother, that can only be played when a pendant that she had left for Vaughn shortly before her disappearance is placed in it. Vaughn persuades his reluctant father to give him the pendant without telling him about the device. In her recorded message, Sarah Pearson reveals that she is still alive, and instructs Vaughn to leave the pendant in the device so that she will know that he received the message. Josie suggests that the sender of the device may be an impostor, but Vaughn chooses to follow his mother's instructions. When Josie is about to leave the school following the disintegration of her relationship with Professor Z after his rapid personality change, Vaughn expresses his true feelings for her in order to make her stay, although it is comments from Principal Durst that finally convince her. Shortly after the problem is resolved, Josie and Vaughn learn that they have the same DNA structure; they both have left-twisting DNA, whereas it is supposed to be right-twisting. This leads to a brief paranoia that the pair of them are related, and they speculate that they may be the only two people in the world with that DNA structure. Vaughn cannot stop thinking about the possibility that his mother is alive, and eventually begins to pressure Corrine Baxter, who was present at the Pearadyne Labs accident after being sucked through the wormhole, to give him answers. Friction develops between the two, which then causes them to be stuck together due to the strange forces at work in Blake Holsey. Vaughn and Corrine explore the old Pearadyne building, and Corrine recalls a brief encounter with Vaughn's mother. Shortly before her disappearance, Sarah had been arguing with Victor about the dangers involved in the experiment that will transported in the future, which threaten the lives of all the Pearadyne employees, including Victor. She tricks Victor into leaving her during the destruction of Pearadyne, and subsequently uses a device to erase Corrine's memories of what she saw and heard. In other words, she planned to leave her family on purpose, something that Vaughn did not know until that point. Vaughn's sadness at the revelations about his mother lead Josie to consider that he might enter the wormhole to reach 1987. When Lucas' gravity sensor picks up wormhole activity, she assumes Vaughn has done this and follows him, only to find herself stuck in 1879. Vaughn and the Science Club members track Josie down and come to rescue her, but find themselves being pursued by the authorities. Vaughn allows his friends to travel through the wormhole as he helps Blake Holsey prevent a police officer from entering the room. He dives into the wormhole at the last moment, and arrives in 1977, at a critical point in the history of Pearadyne and Blake Holsey High. Josie returns for him and they arrive home safely, but Josie made a headstrong decision to try to prevent the Pearadyne accident by stealing back the Chi Ball. When she returns to the present, Blake Holsey High is deserted (and has been since 1987), and Vaughn and the other Science Club members are nowhere to be seen. However, the regular universe continues without Josie. Vaughn develops a closer friendship with Corrine as his relationship with his father falls apart entirely. Broke and despondent, Victor has lost everything, including, Vaughn thinks, his sanity. Bitter at all the lies, secrets and manipulations of their mutual past, Vaughn turns on his father, and is vulnerable to Andreas Avenir's promise to find Sarah if Vaughn will bring Avenir the Chi Ball. Vaughn is finally reconciled with his father after Josie returns to defeat Avenir, bringing Sarah home in the process. Professor Noel Zachary Dubbed \\"Z\\" by the science club students, Professor Noel Zachary (Jeffrey Douglas) is the kind of teacher that any student would want. He believes that his students will learn better if he engages their enthusiasm through unconventional teaching methods, rather than relying on straightforward lectures and harsh discipline. Because of this, Principal Durst doesn't exactly like him much. Noel Zachary grew up without a father, whom he eventually met but who wanted no part of him. As a preteen he played the guitar, but lost interest in it when he discovered a love for science. However, other subjects in school were \\"a little fuzzy\\" for him, and he was not at all sure he would be able to attend college. This changed when he received a college scholarship from Pearadyne Industries. Zachary also interned at Pearadyne as a condition of the scholarship. Years later, Victor Pearson personally hired Zachary to teach at Blake Holsey High after the previous teacher, Professor Middleton, mysteriously disappeared. Like his students, Z is curious to find out what is causing the strange events that always seem to be surrounding the school. Although many of the events that take place in Blake Holsey High are too weird to understand fully, Professor Zachary never forgets to think like a true scientist. It is revealed during a Semi-Annual Teacher Review, Professor Zachary attended the University of Pennsylvania, graduated magna cum laude, and is proud of his alma mater ‚Äì to the point of shouting \\"Go Quakers!\\" during the review. It is also revealed that his doctoral dissertation is about the modeling of ion implantation induced transient deactivation disjunction activities in Boron. The floor of Professor Z's office intermittently connects to a wormhole, the probable source of everything strange that happens at the school. Although Professor Z has been through it himself, he cautions the Science Club against exposing themselves to its dangers, preferring to investigate more scientifically and safely by sending a toy called Mr. Bunnypants through the wormhole with a camera attached. After Josie disappears and fails to return, Professor Z forbids anyone from going into his office at all. Following the end of the series, Z stays on at Blake Holsey High in order to study the after side effects of the wormhole's destruction. Principal Amanda Durst A veteran science teacher, Principal Amanda Durst (Valerie Boyle) attempts to bring order and discipline to Blake Holsey's chaos, and is a reluctant conspirator in Victor Pearson's activities. Amanda Durst's career at Blake Holsey High began in 1977, when she became the school's new science professor (portrayed by Lindy Booth). Although she probably did not know this at the time, the floor of her office (which later became Professor Middleton's office, and then Professor Noel Zachary's office) connected to a wormhole. The first student Durst ever \\"yelled at\\" was young Victor Pearson. The fact that she enjoyed this set the tone for her tenure as an educator and administrator. As the school principal, Durst sets a high value on rules, and hands out detention as punishment when students break them. She has a rule book that dates back to the early years of the school, which she expects Professor Zachary and other teachers to help enforce. Some of this strictness has more to do with keeping the school's secrets and preventing disaster than with maintaining order, as when Lucas is shooed away from Middleton's office immediately after Middleton's disappearance, or when Durst makes attendance at a pizza party mandatory to keep students away from an investigation Victor is conducting in front of the school. Although the members of the school's Science Club tend to think of the principal as an obstacle, someone to punish them if they get caught, there is much more to Amanda Durst than they realize. She is an expert tracker and mountain climber, and like Josie Trent she always hated all the female victims of literature. When her uninhibited side takes over after an experiment in chirality, it becomes clear that she enjoys science and is highly competent as a science professor. Furthermore, she genuinely cares about the students. Even after \\"Professor D\\" returns to normal, she takes it upon herself to design an independent study course for Josie, to fuel her \\"original thoughts.\\" On another occasion, she shows sympathy for Josie's sensitivity to being teased about her height, likening it to her own problems with her weight. Principal Durst's main problems on the job have less to do with students' misbehavior than with Victor Pearson and the wormhole. As the head of the school's board of directors, Pearson has the power to replace Durst as principal, and has done so on at least one occasion. Also, Durst knows as well as Pearson that the school's future depends on parents and other outsiders not knowing about the strange things that happen at Blake Holsey. This fear of discovery turns out to be well-founded, as Josie's year-long disappearance causes a major drop in enrollment, so that ultimately the school is closed. For these reasons, she reluctantly cooperates with Pearson's secret experiments and investigations, lies about the disappearances of teachers and students, and proclaims, against all evidence to the contrary, that \\"There is nothing wrong at Blake Holsey High.\\" Victor is less than sympathetic to Amanda's situation, and often threatens or belittles her. Durst tries to relieve this stress by reassuring herself with affirmations, and by talking back to a ball with Victor's face drawn on it. When Lucas Randall temporarily becomes an adult after a mayfly bites him, he becomes aware of Durst's hard work and dedication, and encourages her to have more fun. Posing as a substitute teacher, Lucas also berates Victor for not treating Principal Durst with more respect. Amanda Durst is not the first person from her family to serve as the school's administrator. When it first opened in 1879 under the name New Chichester Preparatory Academy, Blake Holsey High had a headmistress named Durst, who bore a striking resemblance to the present-day principal. Victor Pearson Bald, ruthless and seemingly untrustworthy, Victor Pearson (Lawrence Bayne) resembles Lex Luthor in DC Comics and Lionel Luthor in Smallville. Victor is the head of the Blake Holsey school board, and exerts a great deal of coercive influence over Principal Amanda Durst. He is the father of Vaughn, husband of Sarah, ex-colleague of Kelly Trent, and nemesis of Josie Trent. Victor was once a nice, inventive, and nerdy student at Blake Holsey High (portrayed by David Reale). He was in love with Sarah Lynch. Victor stole Josie Trent's Floating Chi Ball when she followed Vaughn through the wormhole to 1978. This pleased Sarah, who turned out to be a time traveler herself. Victor eventually married Sarah, and Sarah gave birth to Vaughn. At the culmination of the couple's time travel experiments using the Chi Ball, when Sarah was to leave the present to return to the future, she left Victor with a pendant to give to Vaughn. Victor always had a plan and was known to work on secret projects that would seem dangerous. He used the mysterious Chi Ball to power his devices. The Science Club was deeply suspicious of Victor's activities, and often investigated or interfered with them. Victor attempted to use Vaughn to learn information from the Science Club, but Vaughn decided not to spy for him. Distrust between father and son grew, as Vaughn demanded the pendant with no explanation, and Victor failed to explain that his experiments were largely directed at finding Sarah and bringing her home. Nor did Victor tell his son that Vaughn's signature on certain financial documents was the only way to continue to fund this effort. A year after Josie went missing, Victor had lost his fortune and seemingly become a madman, still driven to continue his search for Sarah but lacking a means to do so. It was not until Josie's clone returned and openly supported Victor's efforts that the Science Club learned that Victor was not the villain they had assumed him to be. The Janitor An all-knowing figure at Blake Holsey High. The Janitor (Tony Munch), like Josie's clone, was transported to some era through a wormhole due to the explosion at Pearadyne. He knows what is to happen and is supportive of Josie Trent. He always seems to help Josie at the time she needs it most, yet at the same time confuses her with his all-knowing. Josie, however, loses her trust in him when in one episode where Vaughn, instead of returning to the present, is sent to 1977. When she returns through the black hole for him, the janitor refuses to tell her where Vaughn is. He is cryptic and intends to not stray from the point, making sure that his true identity and reason for being remains with him and only him. He exists outside of time and intends to keep the timeline in clean and perfect order, without letting anyone know, outside of the Science Club, about the Wormhole in the Science Office. No one seems to know his name. For most of the series, the Janitor is morally ambiguous. This ambiguity is resolved in \\"Conclusions\\" when Josie's clone reveals that the Janitor is an observer of observers. The observers are a people to guard and maintain the time stream against those who would manipulate time travel and alter history for their own ends. While the Josie Clone was also trained as an observer when the Janitor took her to the future it is made clear in \\"Conclusions\\" that he is from a much more distant point in the future and acts as the observer of the other observers. When the series concludes he reveals that he will never be able to return to his home and that it is his sacrifice. =Messages= ;Season one * Shrink: The greatest threat to Victor... ;Season two * Wormhole2: ...is Josie. * Pheromones: Josie's future will be difficult.

Everything happens for a reason. Sarah Lynch Pearson Sarah Lynch Pearson (Jenny Levine) was born on January 16, 1961. She attended Blake Holsey High in 1977 (portrayed by Michele Popovich). She developed a romantic relationship with Victor Pearson, another student at the school. Like the Janitor and Mr. Avenir, she had knowledge of significant events that had not yet occurred, especially when Victor had taken the Floating Ball away from Josie Trent, a future student at Blake Holsey who had travelled in time from 2004 using a wormhole located in the school's science office. Sarah and Victor later married, and she gave birth to their first son, Vaughn. She disappeared in the explosion at Pearadyne Labs on October 4, 1987, and was presumed dead. Prior to her disappearance, she had been to see Vaughn as a baby, and told her son that what she and his father were doing would change the world for the better. She also left him a pendant for him to learn the use of it. Vaughn, who was brought up by Victor, would follow in his parents' footsteps by attending Blake Holsey High. On October 4, 2004, the anniversary of the Pearadyne accident, a wormhole opened above the grounds of Blake Holsey High, depositing a device that contained a holographic message from a woman claiming to be Sarah Pearson. The message could only be accessed by using the pendant, which Vaughn, who was present at the time along with other members of the Blake Holsey Science Club (including Josie Trent), had to retrieve from his father's safe quickly. The message contained a request to insert the pendant into the device before it automatically sent itself back through another wormhole, so that she knew that her son had received the message. Vaughn's friends at the Science Club considered the possibility that the message had been sent by an impostor, but it was eventually decided that the pendant must return with the device. Corrine Baxter, a student at Blake Holsey from 2000 onwards and member of the Science Club, was present at the Pearadyne Labs accident after being sucked through the wormhole in the science office. Until soon after viewing Sarah's hologram message, she had believed that her time in 1987 had lasted a couple of minutes at most, but after Vaughn enquired about what else she could recall, memories surfaced of a brief encounter with Vaughn's mother. Shortly before her disappearance, Sarah had been arguing with Victor about her plans to open a way to be transported in the future, which would endanger the lives of all the Pearadyne employees, including Victor. She was so ambitious that she claimed the entire project as her own, and had tricked Victor into leaving her during the destruction of Pearadyne. She used a device to erase Corrine's memories of what she saw and heard. In other words, she planned to leave her family on purpose. Others * Emma Taylor- Isherwood and Sally Taylor-IsherwoodAccording to Jim Rapsas, Sally Taylor- Isherwood (Emma Taylor-Isherwood's younger sister) appeared as Emma's double throughout the series and in the finale, though her face was not seen. as Josie's clone ‚Äì Accidentally created from Josie's DNA in a piece of chewing gum using energy from the wormhole, Josie's clone possesses average human intelligence with an enlightened personality. Unlike the original Josie, she likes to keep things neat. The Janitor sends her through a wormhole in the basement to the future, where she trains to be a time traveling \\"observer.\\" A year later, when Josie steals the Qi Ball away from Victor Pearson, the clone intervenes and returns it to Victor, reminding him that he has the ball for a reason. She knows how the past and the future are supposed to happen, and, like the Janitor, she hangs around to make sure nothing disrupts the future. Josie's clone also returns after Tyler Jessop went through the wormhole, and when Vaughn finds out about Sarah and Victor. The clone and the Janitor are able to exist outside of time, for when reality changes, they retain their memories of the event; however, they might not be able to return to the future from which they came. At the end of \\"Conclusions\\", the clone Josie is trapped in a parallel timeline, having traded places with the original Josie so that the original Josie could return and fulfill her destiny. However, it is implied that some hope remains for rescuing the clone Josie. In the extended version, clone Josie comes back to original Josie's reality again and begins to date Lucas. * Steve Jackson as Professor Middleton, Professor Zachary's immediate predecessor as Blake Holsey's science teacher. On the night before Josie arrives at Blake Holsey, Professor Middleton disappears into the wormhole located in his office, an event that is witnessed by only Lucas. When the school begins to fold upon itself like a tesseract, a future Lucas arrives in the science teacher's office right before Middleton disappears through the wormhole and briefly witnesses himself in the past. Middleton seems to know much more of what is to happen around Blake Holsey, and tries to warn future Lucas about the Pearsons and the agents of the future. * Christopher Tai as Tyler Jessop, an arrogant bully at Blake Holsey High. Tyler is a show-off and has beliefs of self-importance (due to his older brother being a highly successful executive, and the senior students considering him one of them). Rather than using physical force like Stew Kubiak, Tyler instead uses his influence among the seniors and presence to get his own way and became a recurring antagonist for Marshall in particular. Tyler is also a womanizer, and has an attraction for Josie. Tyler, at one point, became curious of the Science Club's dealings with the wormhole, and, after its energy granted him the ability to alter his physical form (to anyone else's) and camouflage himself (to the point no-one could see him) he successfully found and journeyed through the wormhole. Though Tyler was only gone a few seconds, Tyler went to many places in both the past and future, learning a great deal about future events. A side-effect of the journey caused him to lose his shape-changing ability, though he retained his camouflage. After this, Tyler repeatedly went out into the forest, and spoke to voices in the sky (implied to be Avenir), and then left Blake Holsey to accept an internship at the Avenir Institute to aid in Avenir's plans to gain power. * Lori Hallier as Doctor Kelly Trent, Josie's mother, and is a physicist and engineer in the employ of secret organizations, causing her to be moved around a lot. Perhaps inevitably, Kelly sent Josie to Blake Holsey High. Josie's repeated separations with her mother have left her somewhat estranged with her, though they care about each other and gradually repair their relationship as time goes on. Kelly is at one point recruited by Victor Pearson into Pearadyne II, but her motives are as ambiguous as Victor's. At various times she appears to be working both for and against Victor, making it difficult to discern whether she is a friend or enemy. At the end of \\"Conclusions\\", it is revealed Avenir is Josie's father, having, years ago, (regretfully) deceived Kelly into working against Victor. She eventually turned against Avenir, but not before the two conceived Josie. When Josie returns from the parallel timeline and defeats Avenir, Kelly is reunited with her daughter. * Dru Viergever as Stewart Kubiak, a star athlete, usually referred to simply as \\"Kubiak\\" or \\"Stew\\". He often bullies Lucas and mocks the Science Club's activities. He isn't so smart, but will sometimes surprise the science class with unexpected knowledge. On one such occasion, he revealed an understanding of why chameleons change colors, explaining that, \\"I had a pet chameleon once. His name was Rainbow\\". * Talia Schlanger as Madison, a stuck-up cheerleader and student at Blake Holsey High. She has been known to be very mean and snobby toward Josie. She frequently tries to get Vaughn's attention and was the previous Student Council President. * Liam Titcomb as Will, plays in Magnet 360, Marshall Wheeler's band. A student at Blake Holsey. * Marc Devlin as Jarrod, plays in Magnet 360. A student at Blake Holsey. * Aaron Poole as Grant Wheeler, Marshall's popular older brother and a former student at Blake Holsey High. He and Marshall have a strained relationship, each apparently misperceiving his brother's understanding of him; Marshall believes that he has been living in Grant's successful shadow while Grant has envied Marshall's natural tendency to find true friends who see him for who he actually is. Grant later works for Victor Pearson at Pearadyne II. * Rothaford Gray as Coach Kennedy, a physical education teacher at Blake Holsey High. * John Ralston as Andreas Jack Avenir. Avenir is the mysterious benefactor of Blake Holsey High, somehow appearing in very different eras in the school's history. Avenir was responsible for commissioning the construction of the school, based on his own explicit (yet unusual) design, and was aware of the existence of the wormhole and Josie's identity when she arrived from the future, and later manipulates the architect's son and one of the students; Blake Holsey, into becoming headmaster of the school. A century later, Tyler Jessop is sent as an intern to the Avenir Institute, to somehow aid Avenir in his plans. In \\"Conclusions\\", Avenir is revealed to have assumed Victor Pearson's position on the school's board of governors, and then announced the school's closure. When Josie returns from the parallel timeline, Avenir is waiting to greet her, and reveals that he is her biological father. A rogue observer from the future, he has attempted to gain power over the universe by manipulating the existing timeline; with each failure, he has returned to various points in time to make adjustments and try again. Avenir attempts to convince Josie to help him, though she refuses and appears to have destroyed him in the series finale.

The play is about a man named Dauphine who creates a scheme to get his inheritance from his uncle Morose. The plan involves setting Morose up to marry Epicoene, a boy disguised as a woman. It was originally performed by the Blackfriars Children, or Children of the Queen's Revels, a group of boy players, in 1609. Excluding its two prologues, the play is written entirely in prose. The first performance of Epic≈ìne was, by Jonson's admission, a failure. Years later, however, John Dryden and others championed it, and after the Restoration it was frequently revived‚ÄîSamuel Pepys refers to a performance on 6 July 1660, and places it among the first plays legally performed after Charles II's accession. Characters *Morose: A gentleman that loves silence *Sir Dauphine Eugenie: A Knight, Morose's nephew *Ned Clerimont: A Gentleman, Dauphine's friend *Truewit: Dauphine's other friend *Epicoene: A young Gentlewoman, supposedly the silent woman *Sir John Daw: A Knight, Epicoene's servant *Sir Amorous la Foole: A Knight *Thomas Otter: A land and sea Captain *Cutbeard: A barber, also aids in tricking Morose *Mute: One of Morose's servants *Madame Haughty: Ladies Collegiates *Madame Centaure, Ladies Collegiates *Mistress Mavis, Ladies Collegiates *Mistress Trusty, The Lady Haughty's woman *Mistress Otter, The Captain's wife *Parson *Pages *Servants Plot The play takes place in London, primarily in the home of Morose. Morose is a wealthy old man with an obsessive hatred of noise, going as far as to live on a street too narrow for carts to pass and make noise. He has made plans to disinherit his nephew Dauphine by marrying. This is due to the schemes and tricks Dauphine has played on him in the past. To combat this, Dauphine concocts a plan with Cutbeard, Morose's barber. Cutbeard presents Morose with a young (and supposedly) silent woman to marry. When Morose meets Epic≈ìne, he tries to find out if she's really a silent woman, testing her obedience. He tells her not to succumb to the temptations of the court and tells her about the virtues of silence. Under the assumption that his fianc√©e, Epic≈ìne, is an exceptionally quiet woman, Morose excitedly plans their marriage. Unbeknownst to him, Dauphine has arranged the whole match for purposes of his own. At the same time there is an alliance of women with intellectual pretensions called the Ladies Collegiates. They are married women who live away from their husbands and speak their minds. They talk about how women can use sex to control their husbands. Truewit, hoping to secure his friend's inheritance, attempts to persuade Morose that marriage would not be good for him. Truewit says that no matter what, Morose will find himself unhappy in marriage, regardless of if she is pretty, ugly, rich, poor, or even if Morose loves her. Truewit tells Morose that it is not the women's fault; all of them are corrupted. He also tells Morose to kill himself instead of getting married. The couple are married despite the well-meaning interference of Dauphine's friend Truewit. Morose soon regrets his wedding day, as his house is invaded by a charivari consisting of Dauphine, Truewit, and Clerimont; a bear warden named Otter and his wife; two stupid knights (La Foole and Daw); and an assortment of Collegiates. The house is overrun with noise and clamor, much to Morose's chagrin. Worst for Morose, Epic≈ìne quickly reveals herself to be a loud, nagging mate. Mistress Otter has a dominant personality compared to her husband. She has the same characteristics as Katherine from The Taming of the Shrew. She is intimidating and in charge of domestic resources. She yells at him in front of Truewit and his friends and she tells him he's sullying her image. It appears that she had great options in life but she ended up settling for him. Desperate for a divorce, Morose consults two lawyers (who are actually Dauphine's friends Cutbeard and Otter in disguise), but they can find no grounds for ending the match. Finally, Dauphine promises to reveal grounds to end the marriage if Morose agrees to give him his inheritance. The agreement made, Dauphine strips the female costume from Epic≈ìne, revealing that Morose's wife is, in fact, a boy, and therefore their marriage cannot be upheld. Morose is dismissed harshly, and the other ludicrous characters are discomfited by this revelation; Daw and Foole, for instance, had claimed to have slept with Epic≈ìne. Sources Jonson utilised a variety of sources to write Epic≈ìne. While most details of characterisation and plot are his own invention, the scenario originates from two orations by Libanius: in one, a groom in Morose's situation argues for permission to commit suicide to escape his marriage, while in the other an elderly miser plans to disinherit a nephew who laughed at him. The coup de th√©√¢tre of Epic≈ìne's unveiling, while traditionally viewed as derived from the Casina of Plautus, is closer both in spirit and in execution to Il Marescalco of Aretino. Finally, the comic duel between La Foole and Daw is usually seen as an echo of the mock-duel between Viola and Aguecheek in Shakespeare's Twelfth Night. Some more local details are also borrowed from the classical misogynistic tradition. Truewit's speeches condemning marriage borrow from Ovid's Ars Amatoria and Juvenal's Satire VI. John Aubrey's claim that Morose was modelled on Elizabethan businessman Thomas Sutton is no longer credited. Stage history and reception Unlike many of William Shakespeare's plays, which would have been performed in the open aired Globe Theatre, this play's reliance on controlled sound would have required that it be performed in a small, contained venue like the Whitefriars Theatre. The intended audience of this play would have been wealthier than Shakespeare's crowd. This can be seen through the play's use of Latin phrases, which would have required the audience to possess advanced education in order to understand all of the jokes and references. The play premiered at the Whitefriars Theatre in either December 1609 or January 1610, and was originally performed by the Children of the Queen's Revels. The cast was led by Nathan Field (who may have played either Truewit or Dauphin). Little heed is now given to the Victorian critic F. G. Fleay's hypothesis that Jonson himself played Morose. Jonson hinted to William Drummond that the play failed; he mentioned certain verses calling the title appropriate, since the audience had remained silent at the end. A report from the Venetian ambassador shows that at least one person spoke up in response to the play: Arbella Stuart, who complained of a personal reference to a recent intrigue involving the prince of Moldavia. Whatever trouble this complaint may have caused was apparently smoothed over by Stuart's subsequent marriage to William Seymour. Despite these issues, there is evidence that the play remained popular, as suggested by a Stationer's Register entry in 1612, which indicates the intention to publish a quarto of the play. The play influenced at least two minor plays before the interregnum: Peter Hausted's Rival Friends (1631) and Jasper Mayne's The City Match (1639). After the Restoration, Epic≈ìne was frequently revived and highly appreciated; in the course of a lengthy analysis, Dryden calls it \\"the pattern of a perfect play.\\" The play was one of the first to be performed in London after the theatres reopened in 1660. Samuel Pepys's diary records several viewings of the play. The first, in early summer of 1660, seems likely to have been among the first plays performed after Charles II's return to London. Pepys saw the play again in January 1661, with Edward Kynaston in the title role. In 1664, Pepys saw the play at the Theatre Royal with Elizabeth Knepp in the title role; this was probably the first performance in which a woman played Epic≈ìne. Over the next century, a number of celebrated actresses, including Anne Oldfield and Sarah Siddons, performed the part. Siddons, however, was directly associated with the play's departure from the stage. David Garrick and George Colman's updated version (1752), featuring Siddons, was a disastrous failure. Bonnell Tyler, echoing Reformation comments on the play, condemned Morose as ludicrously unnatural, and other reviewers were no kinder. Garrick replaced Siddons with a boy, responding to ill-informed complaints that a female Epic≈ìne was ludicrous. The revamped casting did not save the production, and Epic≈ìne vanished from the boards for over a century, a victim of the falling popularity of non-Shakespearean Renaissance dramas. In 1935, Richard Strauss's opera Die schweigsame Frau, with a libretto by Stefan Zweig based on Jonson's play, premiered in Dresden. Notable performances =Epic≈ìne in America= Major American revivals of Epic≈ìne have been rare. In Washington D.C., the Shakespeare Theatre Company produced the play in 2003, with Daniel Breaker starring as Truewit. The play has been performed only twice in New York in recent years: once in the 1980s at Jean Cocteau Repertory theatre and in 2010 as part of the \\"Anybody But Shakespeare Classics Festival\\" by (re:) Directions Theatre Company. =Adaptations= The play was adapted for radio by the BBC and featured Marius Goring, Laidman Browne, Gabriel Wolf, Norman Shelley, Vivienne Chatterton, June Tobin, and David Spenser.

The species is the largest of the \\"tegu lizards\\".www.wildherps.com It is an omnivorous species which inhabits the tropical rain forests, savannas, and semi-deserts of eastern and central South America. Tegus are sometimes kept as pets. They are notable for their unusually high intelligence and can also be house-broken. Like other reptiles, tegus go into brumation in autumn when the temperature drops. They exhibit a high level of activity during their wakeful period of the year. Tegus fill ecological niches similar to those of monitor lizards, and are an example of convergent evolution. Etymology The specific name, merianae, is in honor of German-born naturalist Maria Sibylla Merian. Description A black and white tegu seen in Florian√≥polis, Santa Catarina, Brazil. As hatchlings, Salvator merianae has an emerald green color from the tip of its snout to midway down its neck with black markings. The emerald green becomes black several months after shedding. As a young tegu, the tail is banded yellow and black; as it ages, the solid yellow bands nearest the body change to areas of weak speckling. Fewer solid bands indicates an older animal. A tegu can drop a section of its tail as a distraction if attacked. The tail is also used as a weapon to swipe at an aggressor; even a half-hearted swipe can leave a bruise. Tegus are capable of running at high speeds and can run bipedally for short distances. They often use this method in territorial defense, with the mouth open and front legs held wide to look more threatening. Adult males are much larger than the females and can reach 3 ft (92 cm) in length at maturity. They may continue to grow to lengths of 4.0‚Äì4.5 ft (120‚Äì140 cm). The females are much smaller, but may grow up to 3 ft in length, from nose to tail. They have beaded skin and stripes running down their bodies. Adult females can reach a weight of 2.5‚Äì7.0 kg (5.5‚Äì15.4 lb).http://www.uco.es/organiza/servicios/publica/az/php/img/web/17_12_32_15NotaRendimientoBasso.pdf p. 346 The skull is heavily built with a large facial process of the maxilla, a single premaxilla, paired nasals, a single frontal bone, and a single parietal bone. Biomechanical analyses suggest the posterior processes of the parietal might be important for dealing with torsional loads due to posterior biting on one side. In the large adult animals, the posterior teeth are larger and more rounded than the anterior teeth. =Sex= When a tegu reaches about 8 months old, which is commonly referred to as the beginning of their juvenile age, you can easily determine their sex on your own by sight. Their vent at the base of the tail will bulge when it is a male and lie flat as a female. Breeders generally can do such a thing by sight and feel, telling you before purchasing one, though if you have to make the assumption on your own, this is when you will start to notice the difference. If anything, you may always refer to their jowls. Adult males have substantially developed jowls, a result of hypertrophic lateral pterygoideus muscles. Females' jawlines are more streamlined. =Blue tegu= An immature blue tegu resting The blue tegu is a variant known for its light blue coloration, which is most intense in the adult males. Even immature animals can be easily distinguished from other mostly black and white tegu species by the \\"singe mark\\" on their nose. They are among the more suitable tegus for pets, and can be easily tamed but in the wild will either try to run away or react aggressively if provoked. There is much controversy about the correct scientific classification of this animal. Large-scale taxon sampling of the teiids has not led to any strong resolutions based on morphological and genetic data; the majority of data about the blue tegu comes from hobbyists. Some believe it is a mutation of the Argentine black and white tegu, while others, including the original importer, believe it is sufficiently different to have its own classification. The first blue tegu to be exported from South America was in a wholesale shipment of tegus from Colombia. The coloring of a blue tegu can range from a simple black and white animal to albino to a powder blue to even \\"platinum\\" which is basically a high white morph of the species. The blue coloration is typically most vivid on mature males and doesn't tend to appear until the animal reaches sexual maturity around the age of 18 months or 2 feet or more in size. Just like the Argentine black and white tegu, the blue tegu has a very quick growth rate, almost reaching 75% of its full length in a year. Their adult length can vary from 2.5 feet in females to sometimes even longer than 4 feet in adult males. Unlike other lizards these are very heavily built animals ranging from 7 to 12 pounds or more when fully grown. Size is relative to genetics as well as husbandry and diet. Warm-bloodedness Salvator merianae has recently been shown to be one of the few partially warm-blooded lizards, having a temperature up to higher than the ambient temperature at night time. However, unlike true endotherms such as mammals and birds, these lizards only display temperature control during their reproductive season (September to December), so are said to possess seasonal reproductive endothermy. Because convergent evolution is one of the strongest lines of evidence for the adaptive significance of a trait, the discovery of reproductive endothermy in this lizard not only complements the long known reproductive endothermy observed in some species of pythons, but also supports the hypothesis that the initial selective benefit for endothermy in birds and mammals was reproductive. Diet Tegus are omnivorous. Juvenile tegus in the wild have been observed to eat a wide range of invertebrates, including insects, spiders, and snails. They also eat fruits and seeds. As they grow they become more predatory and the protein content of their diet rises. They may seek out eggs from other reptiles and from birds' nests, and will eat small birds and other vertebrates. In adulthood tegus continue to eat insects and wild fruits, and it is assumed that such components include desirable or essential nutrients. In captivity, tegus commonly are fed high protein diets that include raw or cooked flesh such as ground turkey, canned & dry dog food, commercial crocodile diet, chicken, eggs, insects, and small rodents. The inclusion of fruit in the diet is recommended. Though some captive tegus do not readily eat fruit, others enjoy banana, grapes, mango, and papaya. However, there is evidence that, as in most husbandry of carnivores, it is good practice to cook most of the egg in the diet, so as to denature the protein avidin, that occurs in the albumen. Raw avidin immobilises biotin, so excessive feeding of raw eggs may cause fatal biotin deficiency. As adults, they have blunted teeth and exaggerated lateral pterygoidal muscles which allow them to be generalist feeders. In captivity, they have been observed eating various feeder insects like mealworms, superworms, earthworms, silkworms, crickets and roaches, as well as vertebrate prey like mice, rats, fish, turkey (offered in a ground form), rabbit, quail, and chicks. Crustaceans such as crayfish are also readily consumed. Like all lizards, blue tegus need a properly balanced diet; incomplete prey items such as insects or ground meat require dusting with a mineral/multi-vitamin supplement. Vitamin deficiencies can lead to trouble shedding skin, lethargy and weight loss; a calcium deficiency can lead to metabolic bone disease, which can be fatal. Predators of tegus are pumas, otters, jaguars, snakes, and birds of prey. As household pets Tegus make amenable pets, as they tend to become acclimated to their owners and are generally quite docile as adults. They are intelligent and can even be house- broken. A healthy tegu can live for 15 to 20 years in the wild, and possibly even longer in captivity. However, as with most reptiles, if they are not handled regularly, they show more aggressive behaviour; their bite can be painful and damaging due to strong jaws (1000 N bite force, stronger than a dwarf caiman, partly due to the short, deep skull) and sharp incisor teeth in the upper jaw. Tegus do not produce venom. Tegus will perform a threat display if they are upset or stressed. The first stage is huffing, or very heavy breathing, which means \\"be careful\\". Further interference causes the animal to start lashing its tail, somewhat like a moving snake. In wild animals, a third stage of stamping the front feet or \\"dancing\\" is seen. If these hints are ignored, then the tegu can charge and may bite, which will require hospital/veterinary attention depending on the victim. =Captive husbandry= To accommodate their size, a lone adult should be housed in nothing smaller than a 6'x3'x2' size cage, with the largest floor size possible. For a pair, you need to double that size. They must have tons of floor space. About six inches of substrate should be used to allow for burrowing, as well as a substrate that holds humidity well. Most owners use Cyprus Mulch mixed with Coconut Fiber, as it retains humidity extremely well, and is commercially available. Use only organic substrates, as anything with pesticides or additives, much like what you would commonly find at a hardware store, will cause many health issues with your tegu, including death. A good UVA and UVB bulb is imperative to keeping a tegu in good health. They need UVB to produce Vitamin D in their bodies, as well as metabolizing calcium. If they are not allowed exposure to UVB on a daily basis, they can experience severe pain and/or deformities from diseases such as Metabolic Bone Disease. Along with UV a blue tegu also needs a temperature gradient. This means that one side of the cage must be cooler, while the other is much warmer and provides a basking spot. This is so they can regulate their body temperature by going to whatever temperature works for them at the moment. Ambient temps on the cooler side should be around 75 degrees Fahrenheit (23C) and the warmer side should be about 90 degrees Fahrenheit (32C). They also need the surface of their basking spot to meet specific temperature requirements. As juveniles and younger, they need it around 100F (37C), though as they get older it can go up to 110F-120F (43C-48C). For healthy shedding a humidity of 60-80% is preferred. Like most lizards, fresh water should be provided daily. Like other tegus you should make sure your tegu has enough water to soak in if they wish. Some tegus are also known to enjoy swimming and since they grow to about 1 meter long or more, a medium to large kitty litter box can be used as an appropriate sized water dish. Never allow water level to be above shoulder height for a tegu, as many tegus commonly drown when left without supervision. Distribution =Invasive distribution= As the name would suggest this tegu is native to Argentina, but also Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay. They have also escaped the pet trade in Florida and are now an invasive in Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina. The first sighting of Argentine Black and Whites in Berkeley County was on September 10 2020. That makes eight total sightings in SC as of the 10th. Breeding Blue tegus, like other tegus, may breed up to twice a year. They only lay between 18 and 25 eggs in a 'clutch', sometimes more dependent upon animal size and husbandry as well as individual health of the gravid female. Taxonomy loreal scales between the eye and nostril of this black and white tegu, plus its round pupil, identify it as belonging to the genus Salvator. In 1839, this species of tegu was originally described as Salvator merianae. However, beginning in 1845 and continuing for 154 years, it was confused with Tupinambis teguixin, and was considered a synonym of that species. In 1995, it was again given species status as Tupinambis merianae because subsequent studies had shown that the gold tegu, Tupinambis teguixin, is distinct from it. In 2012, the black and white tegu was reassigned to the resurrected genus Salvator as Salvator merianae. S. merianae is called the \\"Argentine black and white tegu\\" to distinguish it from the \\"Colombian black and white tegu\\", which is another name for the gold tegu. Unscrupulous or incompetent pet dealers sometimes pass off gold tegus as black and white tegus. S. merianae and T. teguixin can be distinguished by skin texture and scale count: *S. merianae has two loreal scales between eye and nostril. *T. teguixin has only a single loreal scale between eye and nostril. *S. merianae has round pupils, whereas Tupinambis species have reniform pupils.

The Union victory has the distinction of being the most northerly of Civil War Battles fought west of the Mississippi, and also of being the only such battle fought along the Iowa border. Missouri Home Guard Col. David Moore  Background  As Brigadier General Nathaniel Lyon pursued the secessionist Missouri State Guard to the southwest portion of the state, loyal Home Guard companies were forming throughout the state, while at the same time stranded secessionists were still attempting to organize. At Kahoka, Missouri, Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War veteran David Moore was elected colonel of the 1st Northeast Missouri Home Guard Regiment. Colonel Martin E. Green called up the 2nd Division of the Missouri State Guard to a training camp on the Horseshoe Bend of the Fabius River. There he formed the 1st Cavalry Regiment, 2nd Division, Missouri State Guard. The lieutenant colonel was Joseph C. Porter and the major was Benjamin W. Shacklett. Moore was faced by a growing secessionist force and by dissension in his own command. He determined to strike local secessionists, then fall back to Athens, Missouri (pronounced \\"Aythens\\"Cooper-Wiele, Jonathon K., Skim Milk Yankees Fighting, Camp Pope Bookshop, 2007, page 13) where he would be close to the Croton, Iowa supply depot and Iowa militia support. On July 21, with the help of a company of Illinois militia and a company of Iowa Home Guards he attacked the village of Etna in Scotland County, Missouri and drove off Shacklett's MSG cavalry. He then fell back to Athens. Colonel Green responded by entering Edina in Knox County, Missouri on July 31‚Äîstampeding the local Home Guards. He then proceeded toward his target, Moore's Unionist regiment in Athens. Meanwhile, several hundred of Moore's regiment received Springfield rifled muskets. On August 4 Green bivouacked seven miles west of Athens. While Moore attempted to prepare for attack, several of his company commanders allowed men to visit home. Moore called for reinforcement from Croton and Keokuk, Iowa, but they would not cross the river in time to participate in the engagement. Defeated commander Martin E. Green.  Battle  On 5 August 1861, Colonel Martin Green's force of about 2,000 Missouri State Guardsmen with three cannons tried to capture the town from about 500 Missouri Home Guard. Moore's pickets warned of the secessionists' advance at 5 AM, and Moore called out the regiment to begin assembling it for battle. Between men still absent on weekend leaves and removing the sick across the river, Moore had only 333 men in line. Green's much larger force surrounded the town on three sides, with the river behind the Unionists. Lieutenant Colonel Charles S. Callihan commanded the Union left flank. He found himself facing Major Shacklett's cavalry and James Kniesley's three gun battery. The Unionists had no artillery. However, Kniesley's guns were a motley assortment (a 6-pounder, a 9-pounder, and a hollowed log) supplied with only a few solid shot and improvised canister. While the artillery spooked a cavalry scout, it had little other impact on the battle. The first shot from the artillery passed over the defenders, across the river and into the Croton railway depot. Another passed through the Benning house and into the river. Predictably, the log cannon flew apart on its first fire and played no further part in the battle. As the secessionists advanced, firing became general. Other than the lack of artillery, Moore's small force was much better armed with rifled muskets and bayonets versus shot guns and squirrel rifles. Green's force contained many poorly equipped, untrained and untested recruits. Captain Hackney's Home Guard drove the rebels away from Stallion Branch. However, Callihan was unnerved by the sight of Major Shacklett's large force advancing. Callihan fled toward the river with one of the Home Guard's cavalry companies. Other troops held their positions. The advance faltered as they approached through a cornfield. Shacklett was wounded in the neck and his demoralized men began falling back. Seeing this, Moore commanded his men to fix bayonets. Then he ordered, \\"Forward! Charge! Bayonets!\\" This counterattack sent the Missouri State Guardsmen into headlong retreat. Kniesley withdrew his artillery. Most of the Union force was on foot so the pursuit was very short. Although a few shots were fired at long range across the river by some Iowa militia, they played no real part in the battle. By the time a relief force reached Athens the rebels had already begun a general retreat.  Aftermath  Moore's small force succeeded in driving off a much larger force with few casualties. Moore reported three dead and twenty wounded. The full extent of Missouri State Guard losses are unknown although Moore captured twenty men, most of them wounded. Moore estimated 31 Missouri State Guard killed and wounded. Others claimed large numbers of dead. What is known is that Moore captured 450 horses with bridles and saddles, hundreds of arms, and a wagon load of long knives. The defeat was demoralizing for the state guard's efforts in Northeast Missouri. They lost the initiative and were obliged to continue avoiding capture by pursuers. Had they captured Moore's force they would have obtained a supply of high quality muskets from their captives, and they would have retained the initiative versus the Missouri Unionists. The war was hard on the town of Athens; and the emergence of rail transport after the war led to the demise of this river port.

This was a compromise height between the platform heights on the two lines. The cars were ordered in 1914, but construction was delayed by The First World War. As a result, the first cars were not delivered until early 1920. A total of 72 cars were built by Metropolitan Carriage and Wagon: 36 motor cars, 24 trailers, and 12 driving trailers. They were formed into six- car trains, and for the first time a motor car was used in the middle of the train.

The Automobile Club of France, also known in French as \\"ACF\\" or \\"l'Auto\\", was initially located near the Paris Opera and benefited from a villa in the Bois de Boulogne. In 1898, the club moved to the exceptional site of the former \\"Place Louis XV\\" (currently Place de la Concorde) in order to offer its members more comfort in a prestigious setting. The club still occupies more than 10,000 square meters in the Hotels du Plessis-Belli√®re and Moreau, both located between the H√¥tel de Crillon and the H√¥tel de Coislin, where France signed a treaty by which it became the first nation ever to recognize the independence of the United States. The members of the Automobile Club of France enjoy several lounges, a swimming pool, a gym, a library containing more than 50,000 references, a movie theatre, bars, and dining rooms. Numerous activities are offered, including yoga, squash, shooting, billiards, and fencing. The facilities also include a hair salon and a travel agency. On January 16, 1906, the French Automobile Club licensed the d√©partement of Sarthe to organize an auto race. Their historical action marked the beginning of the 24 Hours of Le Mans and the French Grand Prix. Organized Grand Prix motor racing evolved to become the Paris-based Formula One organization. The 100th anniversary of the event was marked by the government of France issuing a commemorative coin. From 1906 to 1914 the Club regulated major races in France and established the rules for the annual national race dubbed a Grand Prix that was open to competitors from any country. World War I disrupted racing in France until 1921 at which time the national event returned under the official name \\"ACF Grand Prix\\" (French: Grand Prix de l'A.C.F.). This name was used until 1967 when it was changed to French Grand Prix. Today, the club maintains its head office and facilities on the Place de la Concorde in Paris.

The Indian Act is a federal law enacted under the British North America Act, 1867, which gives jurisdiction over Aboriginals to the federal government. The Court found that the Indian Act's statement that provincial laws may apply to Aboriginal peoples in Canada as long as they apply to other people protects laws even if these laws affect Aboriginals more than others. Background Jacob Kruger and Robert Manuel were Penticton First Nations people in British Columbia who killed deer outside hunting season. This was the land on which their tribe usually hunted, and it now belonged to the Crown. Since the hunting violated the provincial Wildlife Act, they were charged, but they appealed citing their Aboriginal rights under the Royal Proclamation, 1763. The British Columbia Court of Appeal upheld the convictions, pointing to section 88 of the Indian Act. Section 88 stipulates that, \\"all laws of general application from time to time in force in any province are applicable to and in respect of Indians in the province, except to the extent that such laws are inconsistent with this Act or any order, rule, regulation or by-law made thereunder, and except to the extent that such laws make provision for any matter for which provision is made by or under this Act.\\" The Court of Appeal found that this section allowed the Wildlife Act to apply to Aboriginals. Decision Justice Brian Dickson, writing for a unanimous Court, decided against Kruger and Manuel. Dickson first found that if hunting rights have been denied, it is not necessarily true that compensation must be provided in turn. No property was confiscated, as the Wildlife Act was geared toward a different purpose. Dickson also said that he would not reconsider the landmark Aboriginal case Calder v. Attorney General of British Columbia (1973) to determine how Aboriginal title is properly extinguished. Turning to the general questions in the case, Dickson cited The Queen v. George to state that section 88 of the Indian Act protected provincial laws with provincial purposes. In pith and substance, the law must apply to all people and not just a specific people for it to be a \\"general application\\" under section 88. It did not even matter if the law, while applying to all, had a more significant impact on Aboriginals than other people; Dickson said that \\"There are few laws which have a uniform impact.\\"Page 110. Dickson then noted that the Wildlife Act's purpose did not specifically address Aboriginals, and that it covered all people. As Dickson quoted another judge as saying, \\"no statute of the Provincial Legislature dealing with Indians or their lands as such would be valid and effective; but there is no reason why general legislation may not affect them.\\"Page 111. Dickson also found that there was no evidence regarding an Aboriginal-related motive to the legislation. Thus, the Wildlife Act's purpose, Dickson concluded, was to preserve a natural resource, namely the wildlife, and was not meant to limit Aboriginal rights. Regarding whether hunting is an Aboriginal right, Dickson noted that \\"However abundant the right of Indians to hunt and to fish, there can be no doubt that such right is subject to regulation and curtailment by the appropriate legislative authority.\\"Pages 111-112. This case could be distinguished from an Aboriginal victory in R. v. White and Bob (1965). In the Kruger case, there was no treaty that would trump the provincial law under section 88. Finally, Dickson stated that if section 88 can incorporate the Wildlife Act (instead of the Wildlife Act being effective in its own right), the Aboriginals would have the burden of proof that the Wildlife Act was inconsistent with the Indian Act. Commentary As Professor Peter Hogg writes, Indianness (primary Aboriginal issues under federal jurisdiction), should include hunting on a reserve. This was demonstrated in R. v. Jim (1915) and R. v. Isaac (1976). Outside a reserve, hunting as Indianness is more debatable; as this was what happened in the Kruger case, it appeared such hunting is not Indianness, but in Dick v. The Queen (1985), the Supreme Court assumed such hunting is Indianness.Hogg, Peter W. Constitutional Law of Canada. 2003 Student Ed. Scarborough, Ontario: Thomson Canada Limited, 2003, page 595.

The galaxy has a prominent nuclear bulge crossed by a wide, knotty, dark lane of dust and gas. The spiral arm structure appears to be elevated above the galaxy's plane and obscures the upper half of the bulge. Discovered on December 19, 1783 by William Herschel from his home in Slough England. It is a binary system together with the bright spiral galaxy M77 (NGC 1068). These two are the largest galaxies of a small galaxy group that also includes NGC 1073, and five other small irregular galaxies. NGC 1087, NGC 1090, and NGC 1094 appear close, but they simply appear in the field of view and are background galaxies. Based on the published red shift, (Hubble Constant of 62 km/s per Mpc) a rough distance estimate for NGC 1055 is 52 million light-years, with a diameter of about 115,800 light-years. The separation between NGC 1055 and M77 is about 442,000 light-years. NGC 1055 is a bright infrared and radio source, particularly in the wavelength for warm carbon monoxide. Astronomers believe that this results from unusually active star formation. It most likely has a transitional nucleus, however, there is a small chance that it could be a LINER.

Born in Somers Town, London, Bannister made his first- class debut on 7 May 1900 against Yorkshire. Although Worcestershire lost by an innings, Bannister made an immediate impact, taking 5-30 in the Yorkshire first innings; his first victim was Test cricketer Ted Wainwright, and he also claimed the scalps of three other England players including Yorkshire captain Lord Hawke. However, his achievement was rather overshadowed by Yorkshire's Wilfred Rhodes, who took 7-20 in Worcestershire's second innings. Two matches later, against Hampshire, Bannister enjoyed what was to remain his best bowling performance, when he turned in an outstanding innings analysis of 20.4-8-29-7; 1900 was the first year in which six-ball overs were used in England. Another excellent effort came in August, when he took five wickets in each innings (his only ten-wicket match haul) against Kent, despite his county slipping to a 231-run defeat. Bannister ended the season with 65 wickets at 20.47 to top the county's bowling averages.First-class Bowling for Worcestershire in 1900 , CricketArchive. Retrieved 26 August 2006. 1901 was a rather less successful season for Bannister: he picked up only 26 wickets in 15 games at an average of more than 31, and never managed more than four wickets in an innings. He did however manage his highest score with the bat when he hit 44 in the first innings against the touring South Africans in July; his part in a ninth-wicket stand of 60, as well as his unbeaten 15 in the second innings, proved crucial as the game ended in a tie, with South Africans' Robert Graham taking a career-best 8-90. After that summer, he was to play only two more first-class games, with his final appearance coming against Yorkshire in July 1902; he took only a single wicket, that of Irving Washington. Later in life he became an umpire, altogether standing in 20 first-class matches in 1910 and 1911. He died in Islington, London at the age of 83.

Fintry is located in the north of the city with Mill o' Mains to the west and Whitfield to the east. On the north, Fintry is bordered by farmland, including the Powrie Farm and Powrie Castle (from which one of the pubs in the area derives its name). Local parks include Powrie Park (at the north of the scheme) and Finlathen Park (in a deep valley to the south of the scheme, through which runs the Dighty Burn). Fintry has a population of 6592.http://cos.churchofscotland.org.uk/church_finder/index.php Customarily, the borders of the scheme are accepted as being: Forfar Road on the west side with Mill O'Mains, Longhaugh Road on the east side with Whitfield and the Dighty Burn on the southern side (inside Finlathen Park). On three of the four sides, and (formerly) half of the north side (see section on Cheviot Crescent and Grampian Gardens), Fintry's borders are defined by three to four storey high tenement blocks. Fintry is served by bus routes 26A, 32, 32B, 33, 33A and 33B known as the Fintry Shuttle. Fintry is in the North East ward of Dundee City Council, represented since May 2012 by Councillors Steven Rome and Willie Sawers of the Scottish National Party, and Councillor Gregor Murray, who is an Independent. Fintry has two bars, the Powrie Bar at Cheviot Crescent and the Dolphin on Fintry Road. Fintry also has two chip shops, two Chinese takeaways known as the Blue Lagoon and Friendlies, and three Indian takeaways, often referred to as the Tartan Tandoori, Mazaydar and the Red Chilli. There are two churches, Fintry Parish Church of scotland and Our Lady of Sorrows Roman Catholic Church. The 22nd Dundee Scouts operates from a hall in the grounds of Fintry Parish Church, and there is also a Girls' Brigade company in the church itself. Other facilities in the community include the Finmill Community Centre on Findcastle Street, and the Library also on Findcastle Street. Fintry is served by three Primary Schools: Fintry Primary (non-denominational, on Findcastle Terrace) and Longhaugh Primary (non-denominational) and St Francis (Catholic school), the latter two both part of the North East campus, opened in 2018, on Lothian Crescent. Fintry is in the catchment area for Braeview Academy Secondary School (non-denominational) and St. Paul's R.C. Academy (Catholic school). There is a Nursery School on the same site as Fintry Primary, and Quarry View nursery is part of the new North East campus on Lothian Crescent. The new Fintry Primary school was completed in around 2010, funded as a Public‚Äìprivate partnership, replacing a \\"temporary\\" building originally erected in the 1950s. History Construction of the scheme began in the late 1940s; previously the area had been farmland. Two buildings from this time survive, one being a former farm cottage on Longhaugh Road which is in private ownership, the other being a farmhouse which now sits on Fintry Road and was until around 2010 the Fintry Nursery School. This building is owned by City of Dundee, and is currently vacant (February 2015). At the time of construction, part of the plan was that all streets in Fintry would begin with the prefix \\"Fin\\". However, since the scheme was built there have been some deviations from this plan; all of these are detailed in the section below. Cheviot Crescent and Grampian Gardens Cheviot Crescent (formerly Fincraig Street) and Grampian Gardens (formerly Fingarth Street) were renamed in the early 1970s due to their poor image (these two streets were blocks of densely populated tenements with a poor reputation and their names made it difficult for the council to attract new tenants into the flats). Some time after their construction, surveyors found that the tenements had been built with inadequate foundations for the ground conditions, and were beginning to subside. After all the tenants were moved out to houses elsewhere in the city, almost the whole north side of Cheviot Crescent was demolished (two blocks were left standing at the east end of the street). Several blocks on the south side, and in Grampian Gardens, were also demolished. Since these demolitions some limited rebuilding involving small bungalows has taken place on parts of the land formerly occupied by the tenements. Amond Way and Amond Gardens, built in the early 2000s, are named after the late PC Trevor Amond who was known in the area for his community work. These occupy land where nos. 7-12 Grampian Gardens once stood. Cheviot Rise is a small back street behind Cheviot Crescent, where the access road and part of the car parks were behind 45/47/49 Cheviot Crescent. Grampian Close is situated at the west end of Grampian Gardens.

He founded or co-founded several organizations including Witness for Nonviolence, the Midwest Treaty Network, and the Wisconsin Green Party.Rona Moore, \\"Honoring the Elders\\", Pipekeepers, March 1999, Wisconsin State Legislature Early life and education  Walter Bresette was born in 1947 and was an enrolled member of the Red Cliff Band of Lake Superior Chippewa in Wisconsin; he was a member of the Loon clan. He served in the United States Army and was stationed in Japan. After he returned to Red Cliff, he operated a trading-goods store. He was a skilled graphic artist, designing a series of Ojibwe \\"moon cards\\" and other traditional art. He was a gifted oral storyteller, spiritual elder, and keeper of Gitchi Gummi. Protests against tribal spearfishing In 1988, a US District Court ruled that the Ojibwe had treaty fishing rights to conduct traditional fishing off reservation during the spawning season of walleye. Protests in the following years became violent as sports fishermen protested what they saw as an unfair advantage, in what became known as the Wisconsin Walleye War. The Red Cliff Band was not as active as others, but Bresette emerged as among the most eloquent and outspoken defenders of the Native American cause of treaty rights fishing. To document the acts of the protesters and inaction by local law enforcement, and to protect the spearfishers, Bresette organized the group Witness for Nonviolence. They organized sympathetic \\"witnesses\\" as observers to record on video events at the boat landings, the sites of protests. During this period, Bresette operated a retail store in a mall in Duluth, Minnesota. Esther Nahgahnub was selling dream catchers from the store, which was raided by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service personnel, who seized several feathers of migratory birds that are protected from commercial exploitation. Bresette and Nahgahnub claimed the right to possess and sell these items due to treaty rights \\"Bresette & Nahgahnub vs USFWS\\" aka \\"Feathergate\\". In a decision that helped clarify the rights of Ojibwes to possess feathers, a US District Court judge returned the feathers to her. Observers speculated that the seizures were politically motivated, but in the end, the case helped the cause of treaty rights. Bresette later wrote about these events in Walleye Warriors: An Effective Alliance Against Racism and for the Earth (1993), a book co-written with Rick Whaley. Mining protests During the 1990s, Bresette focused on opposing proposed sulfide mines in Northern Wisconsin because of expected environmental damages. In each mining battle, Bresette pressed the case of treaty rights and of Ojibwe sovereignty over resources in ceded territory. He co-founded Anishinabe Niijii to oppose mining; he claimed it brought environmental destruction that threatened several key watersheds, including that of Lake Superior. The group unsuccessfully attempted to block operations at a sulfide mine near Ladysmith, Wisconsin. During these protests, Bresette struck mining equipment with the war club of the famous Sauk chief Black Hawk, a gift given to Bresette for his work. The group did stop the proposed Lynne mine in Oneida County. The primary target of protest during this period was the proposed Crandon mine in Forest County. The zinc sulfide deposits were targeted for extraction by Exxon and other companies, but Bresette and others pointed out the potential danger to the Wolf River watershed and the Mole Lake Ojibwe reservation. At the height of the Crandon controversy, Bresette learned of another mining proposal. The White Pine mine in Michigan was a mostly defunct copper mine that was to have sulfuric acid poured into its shafts to leach out remaining copper without United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) oversight. Citing concerns over degradation to nearby Lake Superior, Bresette resigned an EPA position he held at the time. He became a spokesperson for the group Anishinabe Ogitchida as they staged a protest stopping the tanker cars from carrying the sulfuric acid across the Bad River Ojibwe reservation in Ashland County, Wisconsin. The Bad River Train Blockade brought media scrutiny to EPA process and the eventual end to any attempts to revive the mine. Bresette lived long enough to see the Wisconsin legislature pass a mining moratorium to postpone the Crandon project indefinitely. He died before two nearby tribes purchased the mine in 2003 to preserve it from development.  Other political activities  Bresette was also highly active in politics at the local, state, and national levels. With a close associate, Frank Koehn of Herbster, Wisconsin, in the 1980s he started the Lake Superior Greens, one of the earliest green parties in the United States. It successfully ran Koehn for the Bayfield County board of supervisors in 1986. This was the first instance of a Green Party candidate winning any elected office in the United States. Bresette and Koehn were key founding members of the Wisconsin Green Party, which held its first convention in 1988. During the 1990s, Bresette pushed for the Seventh Generation Amendment, also known as the Common Property Amendment, to the United States Constitution. To promote the amendment, Bresette helped organize several protestors to walk completely around Lake Superior. He was active in promoting environmental, treaty rights and human rights issues until his 1999 death of a heart attack in Duluth.

Discovered and described by Sir Thomas Mitchell and John Lindley in 1848, it gained its name from its bulbous trunk, which can be up to diameter at breast height (DBH). Reaching high, the Queensland bottle tree is deciduous, losing its leaves between September and December. The leaves are simple or divided, with one or more narrow leaf blades up to long and wide. Cream-coloured flowers appear from September to November, and are followed by woody boat-shaped follicles that ripen from November to May. No subspecies are recognised. As a drought-deciduous succulent tree, B. rupestris adapts readily to cultivation and is tolerant of a range of soils and temperatures. It is a key component and emergent tree in the endangered central semi-evergreen vine thickets‚Äîalso known as bottletree scrub‚Äîof the Queensland Brigalow Belt. Remnant trees are often left by farmers on cleared land for their value as shade and fodder trees. Description Brachychiton rupestris grows as a succulent tree reaching (rarely ) in height, though plants in cultivation are usually shorter. The thick trunk is tall, with a diameter at breast height (DBH). It has dark grey bark and is marked by shallow tessellation and deeper fissures. Smaller branches are light green or grey, as are the trunks of immature trees. Like those of all members of the genus, the leaves are alternately arranged along the stems. B. rupestris is deciduous. Trees in their native habitat are typically leafless between September and December; the timing, duration and extent of leaf drop may be affected by extremes of rainfall or drought. Sometimes trees shed leaves from only some branches. On every tree, the leaves vary in shape, ranging from narrow and elliptic to deeply divided. The upper surface is glossy, contrasting with a pale undersurface. The adult leaf blades are long and wide with pointed (acuminate or apiculate) tips. They have a raised midrib on the upper and lower surface, with 12‚Äì25 pairs of lateral veins that are more prominent on the upper surface, arising at 50‚Äì60 degrees from the midrib. The compound juvenile leaves have 3‚Äì9 spear-shaped (lanceolate) or linear lobes. These each measure long and wide. Panicles of creamy-yellow flowers with red markings appear from September to November in the species' native range. These arise from axillary buds on end branches. Each panicle contains 10‚Äì30 flowers and is long, and each flower is long and wide. The length of the lobes of the perianth is more than half the perianth diameter. Like all Brachychiton species, B. rupestris is monoecious‚Äîeach plant has distinct male and female flowers. Male flowers have 15 stamens, with pale yellow anthers, while female flowers have cream or white stigmas surrounded by rudimentary stellate (star- shaped) carpels, which sit atop the ovaries. Groups of 3 to 5 woody boat- shaped follicles, each containing 4 to 8 (or occasionally up to 12) seeds, develop from November to May. The follicles, smooth on the outer surface and hairy inside, split along their length to reveal seeds. The seeds, which are ovoid with a smooth surface, and long by wide, are covered by a hairy coating known as the exotesta. The closely related Proserpine bottle tree (Brachychiton compactus) that occurs only in the vicinity of the town of Proserpine can be distinguished by its more oval leaves, more compact flower heads, and longer ellipsoid follicles. The undescribed Ormeau bottle tree has brighter lime-green new foliage and leaves but is otherwise similar to the Proserpine bottle tree. Taxonomy and naming The species came to the attention of the scientific community when explorer Sir Thomas Mitchell observed the trees on his expedition through Queensland in 1848 and published an account in Journal of an Expedition into the Interior of Tropical Australia in the same year. He came across them as he ascended Mount Abundance near present-day Roma, remarking that \\"The trunk bulged out in the middle like a barrel, to nearly twice the diameter at the ground, or of that at the first springing of the branches above. These were small in proportion to their great girth, and the whole tree looked very odd In the same publication, English botanist John Lindley provided the first formal description. Lindley placed it in the genus Delabechea as the sole representative‚ÄîDelabechea rupestris. The genus name was selected by Mitchell to honor the director of the Geological Survey of Great Britain, Henry De la Beche, while the Latin specific epithet rupestris (meaning living among rocks) alludes to the rocky hilltop habitat of specimens observed by Mitchell. Ferdinand von Mueller, the Government Botanist in Victoria, renamed it Brachychiton delabechei in 1862, incorporating the genus Delabechea into Brachychiton. In his landmark Flora Australiensis, English botanist George Bentham published the first key for the nine described species of Brachychiton, and relegated them to a section of Sterculia. Hence the Queensland bottle tree became Sterculia rupestris. Von Mueller maintained his recognition of Brachychiton as a separate genus. German botanist Otto Kuntze challenged the generic name Sterculia in 1891, on the grounds that the name Clompanus took precedence. He republished the Queensland bottle tree as Clompanus rupestris. German botanist Karl Moritz Schumann gave it its current binomial name in 1893, which was accepted by Achille Terraciano of the Orto botanico di Palermo and subsequent authorities, and remains current. In 1988 Gordon Guymer of the Queensland Herbarium published a taxonomic revision of Brachychiton; he classified B. rupestris in the section Delabechea along with the related and newly described Proserpine bottle tree. A third species, from southeast Queensland, has been recognised but not yet described. Unique to the section, all three species have bulbous trunks and can have large cavities in the vertical wood parenchyma. The genus Brachychiton lies within an Australasian clade within the subfamily Sterculioideae (previously family Sterculiaceae) in a large broadly defined Malvaceae. It is only distantly related to Sterculia, belonging to a different clade within the Sterculioideae. The name of the genus is derived from the Greek brachys, short, and chiton, tunic, a reference to the loose seed coats. Brachychiton was for many years misconstrued as being of neuter gender‚Äîfirst by the genus describers Heinrich Wilhelm Schott and Stephan Endlicher and later by von Mueller and others‚Äîwith the specific names then incorrectly amended. Thus the bottle tree's binomial was recorded as Brachychiton rupestre, now regarded as an orthographical variant. Besides \\"Queensland bottle tree\\", common names for the species include \\"narrow-leaved bottle tree\\" and \\"bottle tree\\". Brachychiton √ó turgidulus is a naturally occurring hybrid cross of B. rupestris with the kurrajong B. populneus subsp. populneus. It is particularly prevalent east of Boonah. Distribution and habitat Female flower Brachychiton rupestris is found in central Queensland from latitude 22¬∞ S to 28¬∞ S, with the western limits of its range defined by the 500 mm rainfall isohyet. It grows on the tops and slopes of hills or ridges in low hilly country, in clay, shale, or basalt soils. It is an emergent tree in forests dominated by brigalow (Acacia harpophylla), hoop pine (Araucaria cunninghamii), or ooline (Cadellia pentastylis). It is always present in the Central semi-evergreen vine thicket‚Äîalso known as Bottletree Scrub‚Äîof the Brigalow Belt. Other common species include broad-leaved bottle tree (Brachychiton australis) and belah (Casuarina cristata). The bottle tree is replaced by the kurrajong in similar communities in New South Wales. =Conservation= Although the species status under Queensland's Nature Conservation Act is \\"least concern\\", it is an emergent tree species in an endangered ecosystem known as \\"semi-evergreen vine thickets of the Brigalow Belt (North and South) and Nandewar bioregions\\", listed under the Commonwealth EPBC Act, and is declining across its range. Furthermore, the health of trees in cleared areas may be compromised. The species is conserved within its natural habitat in a number of National Parks including Auburn River, Benarkin, Bunya Mountains, Coalstoun Lakes, Dipperu, Good Night Scrub, Humboldt, Isla Gorge and Tregole. Ecology Brachychiton rupestris has been recorded as a host plant for the mistletoe species Dendrophthoe glabrescens. Insects hosted by the species include the pale cotton stainer bug, a pest of cotton crops, and the kurrajong leaf roller caterpillar that chews on the foliage and rolls individual leaves, within which it then pupates. Bottle tree scrub is a key habitat of the near threatened black-breasted buttonquail. Brachychiton rupestris can withstand bushfires and responds by flowering and putting forth new foliage afterwards. Uses Aboriginal people made use of the trees through eating the roots of young plants and by consuming secretions from the trunk that were induced by wounds. Fibre obtained from the species was used to make nets. The leaves have also been used for fodder, and Queensland farmers often leave bottle trees as a potential food source when land is cleared. During drought conditions, whole trees have been felled to feed stock. The soft edible pulp inside the trunk is exposed by removing the bark. The pulp is energy-rich but protein-poor, and occasional cases of nitrate poisoning have led to cattle deaths. Cultivation Open follicles split longitudinally to reveal seeds inside. The follicle interior is lined with hairs that can irritate skin. Bottle trees are commonly found planted in streets and parks, on farms, and as features in gardens. An avenue in Roma, Queensland, was planted between 1918 and 1920, each tree representing one of 93 local men killed in World War I. The species has been cultivated as an indoor plant and a bonsai subject. Bottle trees grow best in well-drained, slightly acidic soil, in full sunshine. They are suited to cultivation in regional climates equivalent to USDA hardiness zones 9 to 12. In the first stages of growth, the bottle tree is very slow-growing, and the formation of the unique bottle shape is not visible until the tree is about 5 to 8 years old. Mature trees transplant easily, and can withstand intervals of up to three months between digging and replanting without detriment. Bottle trees grown from seed may take up to 20 years to flower. Flowering takes place after adult leaves have appeared. Plants are readily propagated from seed. As seed is surrounded by irritating hairs within the pod, extraction requires care. Stem cuttings of semi-mature growth can be taken in late summer and require the application of rooting hormones and bottom heat.

She continued operations in Far Eastern waters until returning to San Diego on 22 June 1947. For the next 14 months Hollister engaged in training exercises and fleet maneuvers along the West Coast. Hollister departed on 1 September 1948 for her second deployment in the western Pacific where she joined the 7th Fleet on peacekeeping operations. She returned to Long Beach on 24 April 1949 and operated in California waters until July 1950. Immediately after North Korea invaded South Korea in June 1950, the United States committed its military might to halting aggression. Hollister was among the first reinforcements rushed to the battle area, departing San Diego on 5 July. Operating with Fast Carrier Task Force 77 (TF 77), she served as a screening ship and performed plane guard duty. In mid-September Hollister engaged in support of the highly successful landing at Inchon. The 3d Battalion, 5th Marines landed at 06:33, 15 September. Later that day General Douglas MacArthur praised the performance saying that \\"The Navy and Marines have never shone more brightly than this morning.\\" A week later Hollister took Rear Admiral Ewen (TF-77) for a conference with Commander 7th Fleet. In a message to his command, Admiral Ewen echoed MacArthur in praising its work: \\"The performance of Task Force 77 throughout the Inchon operations has added another page to the glorious history of our Navy and its airpower. It has been made possible only through the determination, the relentless effort and the esprit de corps of a team that is really great. Task Force 77 will sail for the high seas soon and will stay at sea until the North Korean Communists have their bellies full ...\\" In late September the destroyer was detached for diversionary bombardment in Communist-held areas, effectively weakening enemy positions as American forces smashed north. In early November 1950, Hollister sailed with the Formosa Straits patrol, returning to Korea in mid-December for support of the H≈≠ngnam evacuation. She continued support operations, anti-junk patrols and shore bombardment before returning to San Diego on 11 April 1951. Hollister operated in the San Diego area until she returned to Korean action a year later. In late April 1955, she resumed duties with Task Force 77, including fire-support missions, patrol, antisubmarine warfare (ASW) exercises and screening duty. Hollister joined the Formosa patrol in August, but resumed operations in Korea before returning to San Diego on 18 November. The veteran ship operated out of San Diego until 21 July 1953 when she sailed for another Far Eastern tour. Hollister engaged in patrols both off Korea and Formosa to make clear America's objective of protecting her allies. After six months in this area she returned home on 19 February 1954. In September, she was deployed to the Western Pacific at a time when the Chinese Communists were stirring trouble in the South China Sea. During the next three months she engaged in hunter-killer operations off Japan and had patrol duty in the South China Sea. In late January 1955, Hollister accompanied the 7th Fleet in the evacuation of Chinese Nationalists from the Tachen Islands. Constant aerial coverage from this powerful carrier force enabled the Nationalists to move from an untenable position. This was considered by some as \\"the most forthright U.S. action against communism since the Korean War.\\" She returned to San Diego on 13 March for local operations. Another deployment to the Far East from 27 September 1955 to 11 March 1956, saw Hollister resume her important peace keeping operations in this explosive area. Only six months passed before departing on another tour of duty with the 7th Fleet, this time visiting Samoa, New Zealand, Manus, and Guam en route to the South China Sea. In January and February 1957, she operated with the Formosa Patrol and conducted training out of Japan before returning to San Diego 24 March. Hollister deployed on 25 October on her ninth Western Pacific tour. In the early months of 1958 she operated with units of the 7th Fleet on Formosa Patrol. Units in this area were placed on alert as a crisis in Indonesia threatened the existing government. The presence of U.S. seapower exerted a powerful influence; the crisis subsided. The destroyer returned to San Diego 23 April but sailed again for the Western Pacific on 18 December to operate with the 7th Fleet. Returning San Diego on 13 June 1959, Hollister spent the remainder of the year engaged in tactical exercises out of San Diego. Hollister departed on 6 February 1960 for her 11th Western Pacific deployment and began patrol duty in the Formosa Straits. This tour of duty also saw her engaged in various antisubmarine warfare exercises with the Philippine Navy. She returned to San Diego on 14 June to resume training and readiness operations.  1961‚Äì1967  Hollister entered the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard on 15 March 1961 for FRAM (Fleet Rehabilitation and Modernization) overhaul, remaining there through the end of the year for an addition of a helicopter deck and hangar aft. After refresher training, she departed Long Beach, California on 7 June 1962 for duty with the 7th Fleet. This cruise came after the Laos crisis and Communist insurgency threatened Thailand. She remained in the Far East until 21 December 1962 when she returned to Long Beach. During 1963 Hollister engaged in shore bombardment exercises and antisubmarine training off the coast of California and in Hawaii water. In the first half of 1964, Hollister engaged in antisubmarine exercises on the American West Coast. On 19 June, she departed Long Beach, California, with an antisubmarine group bound for Pearl Harbor, arriving on 27 June. After passage to Japan, she took up a station for contingency operations in the South China Sea on 4 August, and received the Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal for her patrol services off Vietnam. After continuing these operations intermittently until 17 November, Hollister began transit from Yokosuka, Japan, to Long Beach on 23 December, arriving on 6 January 1965. With three months of overhaul complete, the ship engaged in continuous training exercises from 28 May to 20 August. Deploying again to the western Pacific in August, Hollister was ordered to Taiwan Patrol duty on 14 September. By 22 September, she returned to Subic Bay, Philippine Islands, to commence plane guard and anti-submarine screen duties supporting . Hollister accompanied the aircraft carrier on \\"Yankee Station\\" off Vietnam, giving valuable support to the naval operations exercised in opposing the North Vietnamese Communists. On 19 December she left the station and arrived in Yokosuka on 30 December, prior to her departure for the United States the following day. Southerland at Puget Sound, 1981. After a six-month repair and training period, Hollister left Long Beach on 25 June for the Far East once again. Arriving on 15 July, she screened carriers and prevented infiltration of supplies to the Viet Cong. Hollister remained in the Far East, where she was on station in May 1967.  1967‚Äì1973  After completing a Fleet in-depth overhaul in 1972, Hollister again departed Homeport, this time for her eighteenth deployment to the Western Pacific, carrying a new missile configuration. On 10 August 1972 Hollister became the first U.S. Naval Vessel to ever fire a Surface-to-Surface missile in anger. The missile silenced a North Vietnam Radar site. Only a day before, while on a three ship daylight raid on the Quang Yien storage complex, Hollister received at least 250 rounds of hostile fire. The Task unit destroyed a huge ammunition cache with Hollister returning 193 rounds of fire against enemy shore batteries on the heavily fortified island of Hon Me. This was considered the most daring Destroyer operation of the Vietnam War. The target was destroyed and the Task Unit retired without damage or a single casualty. Hollister returned from the Western Pacific for the last time in February 1973. Hollister's record included completing 21 Western Pacific deployments and action in two major conflicts. In September 1973 \\"Hollister\\" was entered into the Reserve Fleet unit Desron 27, NAVSUPACT, Long Beach, California, with four other ships, the USS McKean DD784, USS Higbee DD806, USS DeHaven DD727 and the USS Henderson DD785. She operated as a training vessel for approximately 124 Naval Reservists. She had an active duty crew of approximately 212. During her reserve assignment she maintained high standards of preparedness to meet any assignment to which she was called. Hollister was decommissioned in September 1979. She was stricken from the Naval Vessel Register on 31 August 1979.  ROCS Shao Yang (DDG-929)  On 3 March 1983, Hollister was transferred to the Republic of China (Taiwan). She served in the Republic of China Navy as ROCS Shao Yang (DDG-929). She was scheduled for decommissioning on 1 June 2004 at Kaohsiung, Taiwan.

Early life, education, and political activism Richards was born in Waco, Texas, and is the daughter of former Texas Governor Ann Richards (n√©e Willis), an American politician and activist. Her father, David Richards, practiced law and had built a practice dealing with civil-rights plaintiffs, newspapers, and labor unions. He also won several landmark cases, including a voting-rights lawsuit that went to the Supreme Court. Cecile Richards initially went to public school, but, in ninth grade, she was disciplined for protesting the Vietnam War, after she wore a black armband. She then attended the progressive St. Stephen's Episcopal School for the remainder of high school. Richards' parents were immersed in political activism from her early years on. At the age of 16, she helped her mother campaign for Sarah Weddington, the attorney who won Roe v. Wade, in her bid for the Texas state legislature. Richards graduated with a bachelor's degree in history from Brown University (1980). After graduation, she became a labor organizer for service workers across several states, running union campaigns for garment workers, nursing home workers, and janitors. When she was 30, she moved back to Texas to help with her mother, Ann Richards', campaign for governor. She is currently on the board of the Ford Foundation, a global private foundation with the mission of advancing human welfare. She was one of the founders of America Votes, a 501(c)4 organization that aims to co-ordinate and promote progressive issues, and is currently serving as president. Before that, she was deputy chief of staff to Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic Leader in the U.S. House of Representatives. She has also worked at the Turner Foundation. In 1996, she founded the Texas Freedom Network, a Texas organization formed to counter the Christian right. She also serves on the board of advisors of Let America Vote, an organization founded by former Missouri Secretary of State Jason Kander that aims to end voter suppression.

The name arises from the arrangement of rows and columns of identical cages connected together, in a unit, as in an artillery battery. Although the term is usually applied to poultry farming, similar cage systems are used for other animals. Battery cages have generated controversy between advocates for animal welfare and industrial producers. Battery cages in practice Battery cages are the predominant form of housing for laying hens worldwide. They reduce aggression and cannibalism among hens, but are barren, restrict movement, prevent many natural behaviours, and increase rates of osteoporosis. As of 2014, approximately 95% of eggs in the US were produced in battery cages. In the UK, statistics from the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) indicate that 50% of eggs produced in the UK throughout 2010 were from cages (45% from free-range, 5% from barns). =The EU ban on caged hens= The European Union Council Directive 1999/74/EC banned conventional battery cages in the EU from January 2012 for welfare reasons. This has led to a significant decrease in the number of eggs from battery cages in the EU. The 2012 battery cage ban was publicised as heralding an end to caged hens throughout Europe, but it created a widely held misconception that all laying hens in the UK are now either free range or barn birds. That is not the case; although battery cages are illegal, farmers have skirted the ban by providing slightly bigger cages with \\"enrichment\\" such as perches. The hens in these conditions are now called \\"ex- cage colony hens\\".Circular from the British Hen Welfare Trust. = Other examples of caged animals= Battery cages also used for mink, rabbit, chinchilla and fox in fur farming, and most recently for the Asian palm civet for kopi luwak production of coffee.

A chicken coop from the 1950s An early reference to battery cages appears in Milton Arndt's 1931 book, Battery Brooding, where he reports that his cage flock was healthier and had higher egg production than his conventional flock. At this early date, battery cages already had the sloped floor that allowed eggs to roll to the front of the cage, where they were easily collected by the farmer and out of the hens' reach. Arndt also mentions the use of conveyor belts under the cages to remove manure, which provides better air control quality and reduces fly breeding. Original battery cages extended the technology used in battery brooders, which were cages with a wire mesh floor and integral heating elements for brooding chicks. The wire floor allowed the manure to pass through, removing it from the chicks' environment and reducing the risk of manure-borne diseases. Early battery cages were often used for selecting hens based on performance, since it is easy to track how many eggs each hen is laying if only one hen is placed in a cage. Later, this was combined with artificial insemination, giving a technique where each egg's parentage is known. This method is still used today. Video advertising the system in the early history of the battery cage Early reports from Arndt about battery cages were enthusiastic. Arndt reported: > This form of battery is coming into widespread use throughout the country > and apparently is solving a number of the troubles encountered with laying > hens in the regular laying house on the floor. > In the first edition of this book I spoke of my experimental work with 220 > pullets which were retained for one year in individual cages. At the end of > this year it was found that the birds confined in the batteries outlaid > considerably the same size flock in the regular houses. The birds consume > less feed than those on the floor and this coupled with the increased > production made them more profitable than the same number of pullets in the > laying house. > A number of progressive poultrymen from all over the United States and some > in foreign countries cooperated with me in carrying on experimental work > with this type of battery and each and every one of them were very well > satisfied with the results obtained. In fact, a number of them have since > placed their entire laying flocks in individual hen batteries. In 1967, Samuel Duff filed a patent for \\"battery cages\\" in patent US3465722. The use of laying batteries increased gradually, becoming the dominant method somewhat before the integration of the egg industry in the 1960s. The practice of battery cages was criticized in Ruth Harrison's landmark book Animal Machines, published in 1964. A simple battery cage system with no conveyors for feed or eggs In 1990, North and Bell reported that 75% of all commercial layers in the world and 95% in the United States were kept in cages. By all accounts, a caged layer facility is more expensive to build than high-density floor confinement, but can be cheaper to operate if designed to minimize labor. North and Bell report the following economic advantages to laying cages: # It is easier to care for the pullets; no birds are underfoot. # Floor eggs are eliminated. # Eggs are cleaner. # Culling is expedited. # In most instances, less feed is required to produce a dozen eggs. # Broodiness is eliminated. # More pullets may be housed in a given house floor space. # Internal parasites are eliminated. # Labor requirements are generally much reduced. They also cite disadvantages to cages: # The handling of manure may be a problem. # Generally, flies become a greater nuisance. # The investment per pullet may be higher than in the case of floor operations. # There is a slightly higher percentage of blood spots in the eggs. # The bones are more fragile and processors often discount the fowl price. Disadvantages 1 and 2 can be eliminated by manure conveyors, but some industrial systems do not feature manure conveyors. Legislation Efforts are undertaken to prohibit battery cages in countries around the world, including Bhutan, India, Brazil, Costa Rica and Mexico. =Australia= Attempts to change the law have been an object of contention; RSPCA Australia has been officially campaigning to abolish both battery cages and furnished cages and to prohibit the sale of cage eggs ever since the 2001 revision of the Poultry Code. The 2009 'Code of Practice' permits the use of battery cages. A written commitment by the Federal government to review the practice was scheduled in 2010; there was no further communication. During 2013 the state government of Tasmania was planning to phase out battery cages and budgeting for financial compensation for affected farmers but this was scrapped following the 2014 election.http://www.abc.net.au/news/2012-05-18/tasmania-to-ban-battery-hen- farming/4019200M ABC Tasmania to ban Battery Hen Farming The Australian Capital Territory prohibited battery cages in early 2014. The Greens were committed to also legally prohibit them in late 2014 in Victoria. In 2019, New South Wales Legislative Council member Emma Hurst established and chaired a NSW Parliamentary Inquiry into the Use of Battery Cages for Hens in the Egg Production Industry. The Inquiry recommended that all food products containing eggs from caged hens should be clearly labelled for the benefit of consumers, and a phase-out of battery cage hen farming in NSW. = Bhutan = Bhutan outlawed battery cages in 2012. = Canada = In February 2016, 90% of egg- laying hens in Canada lived in battery cages. That month, negotiations between egg farmers, animal welfarists and the government resulted in a moratorium on construction of new battery cages from 1 April 2017 and a gradual 15-year phaseout of battery cages towards enriched cage or cage-free systems by 2036. Activist group Mercy for Animals was glad with the announced phaseout, but called the timetable \\"simply outrageous\\" and argued that more urgency was required; some food companies such as Cara Foods, Tim Hortons, Burger King, McDonald's, Wendy's, Starbucks, and Subway announced they would phaseout non- cage-free eggs much sooner than 2036. =European Union= In 1999, the European Union Council Directive 1999/74/EC banned the conventional battery cage in the EU from 2012, after a 12-year phase-out. In their 1996 report, the European Commission's Scientific Veterinary Committee (SVC) condemned the battery cage, concluding: > \\"It is clear that because of its small size and its barrenness, the battery > cage as used at present has inherent severe disadvantages for the welfare of > hens\\". The EU Directive allows \\"enriched\\" or \\"furnished\\" cages to be used. Under the directive, enriched cages must be at least 45 cm high and must provide each hen with at least 750 cm2 of space; 600 cm2 of this must be \\"usable area\\" ‚Äì the other 150 cm2 is for a nest-box. The cage must also contain litter, perches and \\"claw-shortening devices\\". Some animal welfare organisations, such as Compassion in World Farming, have criticised this move, calling for enriched cages to be prohibited as they believe they provide no significant or worthwhile welfare benefits compared with conventional battery cages. Germany banned conventional battery cages from 2007, five years earlier than required by the EU Directive, and has prohibited enriched cages from 2012. Mahi Klosterhalfen of the Albert Schweitzer Foundation has been instrumental in a strategic campaign against battery cages in Germany. = India = In 2013, the Animal Welfare Board of India concluded that battery cages were in violation of Section 11 (1)(e) of the 1960 Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, and issued an advisory to all state governments stating that battery cages should not be used and existing ones should be phased out by 2017. This interpretation has been followed by several states and confirmed by several courts such as the Punjab and Haryana High Court (March 2014) and the Delhi High Court. Yet, some battery cages have been found to continue operating illegally after 1 January 2017. = New Zealand = On 7 December 2012, as part of a new welfare code for the poultry industry, the New Zealand government implemented a ban on the construction of new battery cages, and initiated a 10-year phaseout of all battery cages in the country by 2022. As an intermediate goal, 45% of battery cages were to be removed by 2018. = Norway = In April 2010, the Norwegian grocery chain Rema 1000 decided to stop selling eggs from both battery and furnished cage hens by the year 2012, to coincide with the scheduled EU-wide prohibition on battery cages.Fj√∏rfe nr. 3, 2010. Norwegian law followed EU legislation and on 1 January 2012 also prohibited battery cages (known as tradisjonelle bur or 'traditional cages' in Norwegian), making funished cages (known as milj√∏bur or 'environmental cages' in Norwegian) the minimum legal requirement. Several more industry groups have decided to voluntarily phase out furnished cages as well, such as NorgesGruppen by 2019 and Nortura by 2024, while in April 2017 the Green Party proposed to ban furnished cages throughout the country by 2025. =Switzerland= Switzerland banned battery cages from 1 January 1992; it was the first country to impose such a ban. =United States= As of March 2020, California, Massachusetts, Washington, Michigan, Ohio, and Rhode Island had passed laws banning the use of battery cages, and the former three additionally banned the sale of eggs produced in battery cages. Michigan's ban of battery cages and the sale of non-cage-free eggs in the state, adopted in November 2019, will enter into force at the end of 2024. The passage of California Proposition 2 (2008) aimed, in part, to reduce or eliminate the problems associated with battery cages, by setting the standard for space relative to free movement and wingspan, rather than cage size. Battery cages are also illegal in Michigan due to HB 5127, passed in 2009, which mandates that certain farm animals have enough room to stand up, lie down, turn around and extend their limbs, rather than being confined in tiny cages. In Ohio, there is a moratorium on permits for the construction of new battery cages as of June 2010. Oregon SB 805 also banned battery cages and set forth a transition to enriched colony cages, doubling the space per egg-laying hen. This law served as the model for a national agreement between the Humane Society of the United States and the United Egg Producers. Welfare concerns There are several welfare concerns regarding the battery cage system of housing and husbandry. These are presented below in the approximate chronological order they would influence the hens. =Chick culling= Due to modern selective breeding, laying hen strains are different from those of meat production strains. Male birds of the laying strains do not lay eggs and are unsuitable for meat production, therefore, they are culled soon after being sexed, often on the day of hatching. Methods of culling include cervical dislocation, asphyxiation by carbon dioxide and maceration using a high speed grinder. Animal rights groups have used videos of live chicks being placed into macerators as evidence of cruelty in the egg production industry. Maceration, together with cervical dislocation and asphyxiation by carbon dioxide, are all considered acceptable methods of euthanasia by the American Veterinary Medical Association.AVMA Guidelines for the Euthanasia of Animals Executive Board meets pressing needs - September 15, 2006 Consumers may also be appalled simply by the death of animals that are not subsequently eaten. =Beak-trimming= To reduce the harmful effects of feather pecking, cannibalism and vent pecking, most chicks eventually going into battery cages are beak-trimmed. This is often performed on the first day after hatching, simultaneously with sexing and receiving vaccinations. Beak-trimming is a procedure considered by many scientists to cause acute pain and distress with possible chronic pain; it is practised on chicks for all types of housing systems, not only battery cages. =Cage size= Battery cage At approximately 16 weeks of age, pullets (hens which have not yet started to lay) are placed into cages. In countries with relevant legislation, floor space for battery cages ranges upwards from 300 cm2 per bird. EU standards in 2003 called for at least 550 cm2 per hen.Chickens: Layer Housing, M.C. Appleby, Encyclopedia of Animal Science. In the US, the current recommendation by the United Egg Producers is 67 to 86 in2 (430 to 560 cm2) per bird. The space available to each hen in a battery cage has often been described as less than the size of a sheet of A4 paper (624 cm2). Others have commented that a typical cage is about the size of a filing cabinet drawer and holds eight to 10 hens. Behavioural studies showed that when turning, hens used 540 to 1006 cm2, when stretching wings 653 to 1118 cm2, when wing flapping 860 to 1980 cm2, when feather ruffling 676 to 1604 cm2, when preening 814 to 1240 cm2, and when ground scratching 540 to 1005 cm2.Stamp Dawkins, M. and Hardie, S., (1989). Space needs of laying hens. British Poultry Science, 30: 413-416. A space allowance of 550 cm2 would prevent hens in battery cages from performing these behaviours without touching another hen. Animal welfare scientists have been critical of battery cages because of these space restrictionsNicol, C.J. and Dawkins, M., (1989). No room for manoeuvre. New Scientist, 16 September 1989 and it is widely considered that hens suffer boredom and frustration when unable to perform these behaviours. Spatial restriction can lead to a wide range of abnormal behaviours, some of which are injurious to the hens or their cagemates. =Light manipulation= Battery cages - note the low light intensity beyond range of the camera flashgun To reduce the harmful effects of feather pecking, cannibalism and vent-pecking, hens in battery cages (and other housing systems) are often kept at low light intensities (e.g. less than 10 lux). Low light intensities may be associated with welfare costs to the hens as they prefer to eat in brightly lit environmentsPrescott, N.B. and Wathes, C.M., (2002). Preference and motivation of laying hens to eat under different illuminances and the effect of illuminance on eating behaviour. British Poultry Science, 43: 190-195 and prefer brightly lit areas for active behaviour but dim (less than 10 lux) for inactive behaviour.Davis, N.J., Prescott, N.B., Savory, C.J. and Wathes, C.M., (1999).

Being indoors, hens in battery cages do not see sunlight. Whilst there is no scientific evidence for this being a welfare problem, some animal advocates indicate it is a concern.Against Animal Cruelty Tasmania (AACT) - Battery Hen Campaign Prevent Cruelty to Chickens in the Egg Industry by Adopting a Vegan Diet  ChooseVeg.com Furnished cages and some other non-cage indoor systems would also prevent hens seeing natural light throughout their lives. =Osteoporosis= Several studies have indicated that toward the end of the laying phase (approximately 72 weeks of age), a combination of high calcium demand for egg production and a lack of exercise can lead to osteoporosis. This can occur in all housing systems for egg laying hens, but is particularly prevalent in battery cage systems where it has sometimes been called 'cage layer osteoporosis'. Osteoporosis leads to the skeleton becoming fragile and an increased risk of bone breakage, particularly in the legs and keel bone. Fractures may occur whilst the hens are in the cage and these are usually discovered at depopulation as old, healed breaks, or they might be fresh breaks which occurred during the process of depopulation. One study showed that 24.6% of hens from battery cages had recent keel fractures whereas hens in furnished cages, barn and free-range had 3.6%, 1.2% and 1.3% respectively. However, hens from battery cages experienced fewer old breaks (17.7%) compared to hens in barn (69.1%), free-range (59.8%) and furnished cages (31.7%).Sherwin, C.M., Richards, G.J and Nicol, C.J., (2010).

World's Poultry Science Journal, 64: 65-75 This temporary starving of the hens is seen as inhumane and is the main point of objection by critics and opponents of the practice. The alternative most often employed is to slaughter the hens instead of moulting them. Improving welfare for egg producing hens The Scientific Veterinary Committee of the European Commission stated that \\"enriched cages and well designed non-cage systems have already been shown to have a number of welfare advantages over battery systems in their present form\\". Supporters of battery husbandry contend that alternative systems such as free range also have welfare problems, such as increases in cannibalism, feather pecking and vent pecking. A recent review of welfare in battery cages made the point that such welfare issues are problems of management, unlike the issues of behavioural deprivation, which are inherent in a system that keeps hens in such cramped and barren conditions. Free range egg producers can limit or eliminate injurious pecking, particularly feather pecking, through such strategies as providing environmental enrichment, feeding mash instead of pellets, keeping roosters in with the hens, and arranging nest boxes so hens are not exposed to each other's vents; similar strategies are more restricted or impossible in battery cages.

The history of chocolate began in Mesoamerica. Fermented beverages made from chocolate date back to 450 BC. The Aztecs believed that cacao seeds were the gift of Quetzalcoatl, the god of wisdom, and the seeds once had so much value that they were used as a form of currency. Originally prepared only as a drink, chocolate was served as a bitter liquid, mixed with spices or corn puree. It was believed to be an aphrodisiac and to give the drinker strength. Today, such drinks are also known as \\"Chilate\\" and are made by locals in the South of Mexico. After its arrival to Europe in the sixteenth century, sugar was added to it and it became popular throughout society, first among the ruling classes and then among the common people. In the 20th century, chocolate was considered essential in the rations of United States soldiers during war. The word \\"chocolate\\" comes from the Classical Nahuatl word XocolƒÅtl, and entered the English language from the Spanish language. History An Aztec woman generates foam by pouring chocolate from one vessel to another in the Codex TudelaCultivation, consumption, and cultural use of cacao were extensive in Mesoamerica where the cacao tree is native. When pollinated, the seed of the cacao tree eventually forms a kind of sheath, or ear, 20\\" long, hanging from the tree trunk itself. Within the sheath are 30 to 40 brownish-red almond- shaped beans embedded in a sweet viscous pulp. While the beans themselves are bitter due to the alkaloids within them, the sweet pulp may have been the first element consumed by humans. Cacao pods grow in a wide range of colors, from pale yellow to bright green, all the way to dark purple or crimson. The skin can also vary greatly - some are sculpted with craters or warts, while others are completely smooth. This wide range in type of pods is unique to cacaos in that their color and texture does not necessarily determine the ripeness or taste of the beans inside. Evidence suggests that it may have been fermented and served as an alcoholic beverage as early as 1400 BC. Cultivation of the cacao was not an easy process. Part of this was because cacao trees in their natural environment grow to 60 feet tall or more. When the trees were grown in a plantation; however, they grew to around 20 feet tall. While researchers do not agree on which Mesoamerican culture first domesticated the cacao tree, the use of the fermented bean in a drink seems to have arisen in North America (Mesoamerica‚ÄîCentral America and Mexico). Scientists have been able to confirm its presence in vessels around the world by evaluating the \\"chemical footprint\\" detectable in the micro samples of contents that remain. Ceramic vessel with residues from the preparation of chocolate beverages have been found at archaeological sites dating back to the Early Formative (1900‚Äì900 BC) period. For example, one such vessel found at an Olmec archaeological site on the Gulf Coast of Veracruz, Mexico dates chocolate's preparation by pre-Olmec peoples as early as 1750 BC. On the Pacific coast of Chiapas, Mexico, a Mokayanan archaeological site provides evidence of cacao beverages dating even earlier, to 1900 BC. A study, published online in Nature Ecology & Evolution, suggests that cacao‚Äîthe plant from which chocolate is made‚Äîwas domesticated, or grown by people for food, around 1,500 years earlier than previously thought. In addition, the researchers found cacao was originally domesticated in South America, rather than in Central America. ‚ÄúThis new study shows us that people in the upper reaches of the Amazon basin, extending up into the foothills of the Andes in southeastern Ecuador, were harvesting and consuming cacao that appears to be a close relative of the type of cacao later used in Mexico‚Äîand they were doing this 1,500 years earlier,‚Äù said Michael Blake, study co-author and professor in the University of British Columbia department of anthropology. The researchers used three lines of evidence to show that the Mayo-Chinchipe culture used cacao between 5,300 and 2,100 years ago: the presence of starch grains specific to the cacao tree inside ceramic vessels and broken pieces of pottery; residues of theobromine, a bitter alkaloid found in the cacao tree but not its wild relatives; and fragments of ancient DNA with sequences unique to the cacao tree.https://news.ubc.ca/2018/10/29/sweet-discovery-new-ubc-study-pushes-back- the-origins-of-chocolate/ Pueblo people, who lived in an area that is now the U.S. Southwest, imported cacao from Mesoamerican cultures in southern Mexico between 900 and 1400. They used it in a common beverage consumed by everyone in their society. = Archaeological evidence of Cacao in Mesoamerica = Nature Ecology & Evolution reported probably the earliest cacao use from approximately 5,300 years ago recovered from the Santa Ana (La Florida) site in southeast Ecuador. Another find of chemically traced cacao was in 1984 when a team of archaeologists in Guatemala explored the Mayan site of R√≠o Azul. They discovered fifteen vessels surrounding male skeletons in the royal tomb. One of these vessels was beautifully decorated and covered in various Mayan glyphs. One of these glyphs translated to \\"kakaw\\", also known as cacao. The inside of the vessel was lined with a dark-colored powder, which was scraped off for further testing. Once the archaeologists took this powder to the Hershey Center for Health and Nutrition to be tested, they found trace amounts of theobromine in the powder, a major indicator of cacao. This cacao was dated to sometime between 460 and 480 AD Cacao powder was also found in beautifully decorated bowls and jars, known as tecomates, in the city of Puerto Escondido. Once thought to have been a very rare commodity, cacao was found in many more tecomates than once thought possible. However, since this powder was only found in bowls of higher quality, it led archaeologists to believe that only wealthier people could afford such bowls, and therefore the cacao. The cacao tecomates are thought to have been a centerpiece to social gatherings between people of high social status. = Olmec use = Earliest evidence of domestication of the cacao plant dates to the Olmec culture from the Preclassic period. The Olmecs used it for religious rituals or as a medicinal drink, with no recipes for personal use. Little evidence remains of how the beverage was processed. = Mayan use = The Mayans, (in Guatemala), by contrast, do leave some surviving writings about cacao which confirm the identification of the drink with the gods. The Dresden Codex specifies that it is the food of the rain deity Kon, the Madrid Codex that gods shed their blood on the cacao pods as part of its production. The Maya people gathered once a year to give thanks to the god Ek Chuah who they saw as the Cacao god. The consumption of the chocolate drink is also depicted on pre-Hispanic vases. The Maya seasoned their chocolate by mixing the roasted cacao seed paste into a drink with water, chile peppers and cornmeal, transferring the mixture repeatedly between pots until the top was covered with a thick foam. There were many uses for cacao among the Maya. It was used in official ceremonies and religious rituals, at feasts and festivals, as funerary offerings, as tribute, and for medicinal purposes. Both cacao itself and vessels and instruments used for the preparation and serving of cacao were used for important gifts and tribute. Cacao beans were used as currency, to buy anything from avocados to turkeys to sex. A rabbit, for example, was worth ten cacao beans, (called ‚Äúalmonds‚Äù by the early sixteenth-century chronicler Francisco Oviedo y Vald√©s), a slave about a hundred, and the services of a prostitute, eight to ten ‚Äúaccording to how they agree,‚Äù. The beans were also used in betrothal and marriage ceremonies among the Maya, especially among the upper classes. ‚ÄúThe form of the marriage is: the bride gives the bridegroom a small stool painted in colors, and also gives him five grains of cacao, and says to him ‚ÄúThese I give thee as a sign that I accept thee as my husband.‚Äù And he also gives her some new skirts and another five grains of cacao, saying the same thing.‚Äù Maya preparation of cacao started with cutting open cacao pods to expose the beans and the fleshy pulp. The beans were left out to ferment for a few days. In some cases, the beans were also roasted over an open fire in order to add a smoky flavor to it. The beans then had their husks removed and were ground into a paste. Since sweeteners were rarely used by Maya, they flavored their cacao paste with additives like flowers, vanilla pods, and chilies. The vessel used to serve this chocolate liquid was stubbier by nature to help froth the liquid better, which was very important to the Maya. The vessels also tended to be decorated in intricate designs and patterns, which tended to only be accessible by the rich. = Aztec use = By 1400, the Aztec Empire took over a sizable part of Mesoamerica. They were not able to grow cacao themselves, but were forced to import it. All of the areas that were conquered by the Aztecs that grew cacao beans were ordered to pay them as a tax, or as the Aztecs called it, a \\"tribute\\". The cacao bean became a form of currency. The Spanish conquistadors left records of the value of the cacao bean, noting for instance that 100 beans could purchase a canoe filled with freshwater or a turkey hen. The Aztecs associated cacao with the god Quetzacoatl, whom they believed had been condemned by the other gods for sharing chocolate with humans. Unlike the Maya of Yucat√°n, the Aztecs drank chocolate cold. It was consumed for a variety of purposes, as an aphrodisiac or as a treat for men after banquets, and it was also included in the rations of Aztec soldiers. History in Europe =Early history= Until the 16th century, the cacao tree was wholly unknown to Europeans. Christopher Columbus encountered the cacao bean on his fourth mission to the Americas on August 15, 1502, when he and his crew seized a large native canoe that proved to contain among other goods for trade, cacao beans. His son Ferdinand commented that the natives greatly valued the beans, which he termed almonds, \\"for when they were brought on board ship together with their goods, I observed that when any of these almonds fell, they all stooped to pick it up, as if an eye had fallen.\\" But while Columbus took cacao beans with him back to Spain, it made no impact until Spanish friars introduced chocolate to the Spanish court. A Lady Pouring Chocolate by Jean-√âtienne Liotard (1744) Spanish conquistador Hern√°n Cort√©s may have been the first European to encounter chocolate when he observed it in the court of Montezuma in 1519. In 1568, Bernal D√≠az, who accompanied Cort√©s in the conquest of Mexico, wrote of this encounter which he witnessed: > From time to time they served him [Montezuma] in cups of pure gold a certain > drink made from cacao. It was said that it gave one power over women, but > this I never saw. I did see them bring in more than fifty large pitchers of > cacao with froth in it, and he drank some of it, the women serving with > great reverence.The Bernal Diaz Chronicles, translated and edited by Albert > Idell, published by Doubleday Dolphin, 1956, p.160 Jos√© de Acosta, a Spanish Jesuit missionary who lived in Peru and then Mexico in the later 16th century, described its use more generally: > Loathsome to such as are not acquainted with it, having a scum or froth that > is very unpleasant taste. Yet it is a drink very much esteemed among the > Indians, wherewith they feast noble men who pass through their country. The > Spaniards, both men and women that are accustomed to the country are very > greedy of this chocolate. They say they make diverse sorts of it, some hot, > some cold, and some temperate, and put therein much of that \\"chili\\"; yea, > they make paste thereof, the which they say is good for the stomach and > against the catarrh. After the Spanish conquest of the Aztecs, chocolate was imported to Europe. In the beginning, Spaniards would use it as a medicine to treat illnesses such as abdominal pain because it had a bitterness to it. Once sweetened, it transformed. It quickly became a court favorite. It was still served as a beverage, but the addition of sugar or honey counteracted the natural bitterness. The Spaniards initially intended to recreate the original taste of the Mesoamerican chocolate by adding similar spices, but this habit had faded away by the end of the eighteenth century. Within about a hundred years, chocolate established a foothold throughout Europe. According to the authority on the Spanish language, the Royal Spanish Academy, the Spanish word \\"chocolate\\" is derived from the Nahuatl word \\"xocolatl\\" (pronounced ), which is made up from the words \\"xococ\\" meaning sour or bitter, and \\"atl\\" meaning water or drink. However, as William Bright noted the word \\"chocolatl\\" doesn't occur in central Mexican colonial sources making this an unlikely derivation. Santamaria gives a derivation from the Yucatec Maya word \\"chokol\\" meaning hot, and the Nahuatl \\"atl\\" meaning water. More recently Dakin and Wichman derive it from another Nahuatl term, \\"chicolatl\\" from Eastern Nahuatl meaning \\"beaten drink\\". They derive this term from the word for the frothing stick, \\"chicoli\\". The word xocoatl means beverage of the maize. The words \\"cacaua atl\\" mean drink of cacao. The word \\"xocolatl\\" does not appear in Molina's dictionary, Vocabulario en Lengua Castellana y Mexicana y Mexicana y Castellana. =Expansion= An early 20th-century chocolate advertisement The new craze for chocolate brought with it a thriving slave market, as between the early 17th and late 19th centuries the laborious and slow processing of the cacao bean was manual. Cacao plantations spread, as the English, Dutch, and French colonized and planted. With the depletion of Mesoamerican workers, largely to disease, cocoa beans production was often the work of poor wage laborers and African slaves. 1729 - The first mechanic cocoa grinder was invented in Bristol, UK. Walter Churchman petitions king of England for patent and sole use of an invention for the ‚Äúexpeditious, fine and clean making of chocolate by an engine.‚Äù The patent was granted by His Majesty King George II to Walter Churchman for a water engine used to make chocolate. Churchman probably used water-powered edge runners for preparing cacao beans by crushing on a far larger scale than previously . The patent for a chocolate refining process was later bought by J. S. Fry & Sons in 1761. Wind-powered and horse-drawn mills were used to speed production, augmenting human labor. Heating the working areas of the table-mill, an innovation that emerged in France in 1732, also assisted in extraction.Wilson & Hurst, \\"Chocolate and Health: Chemistry, Nutrition and Therapy\\", p. 219, Royal Society of Chemistry, 2015 The Chocolaterie Lombart, created in 1760, claimed to be the first chocolate company in France, ten years before Pelletier et Pelletier. New processes that speed the production of chocolate emerged early in the Industrial Revolution. In 1815, Dutch chemist Coenraad van Houten introduced alkaline salts to chocolate, which reduced its bitterness. A few years thereafter, in 1828, he created a press to remove about half the natural fat (cacao butter) from chocolate liquor, which made chocolate both cheaper to produce and more consistent in quality. This innovation introduced the modern era of chocolate. Known as \\"Dutch cocoa\\", this machine-pressed chocolate was instrumental in the transformation of chocolate to its solid form when in 1847 Joseph Fry learned to make chocolate moldable by adding back melted cacao butter. Milk had sometimes been used as an addition to chocolate beverages since the mid-17th century, but in 1875 Daniel Peter invented milk chocolate by mixing a powdered milk developed by Henri Nestl√© with the liquor. In 1879, the texture and taste of chocolate was further improved when Rodolphe Lindt invented the conching machine. Lindt & Spr√ºngli AG, a Swiss-based concern with global reach, had its start in 1845 as the Spr√ºngli family confectionery shop in Zurich that added a solid-chocolate factory the same year the process for making solid chocolate was developed and later bought Lindt's factory. Besides Nestl√©, several chocolate companies had their start in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Cadbury was manufacturing boxed chocolates in England by 1868. In 1893, Milton S. Hershey purchased chocolate processing equipment at the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago and soon began the career of Hershey's chocolates with chocolate-coated caramels. Due to improvements in machines, chocolate underwent a transformation from a primarily a drink to food, and different types of chocolate began to emerge. At the same time, the price of chocolate began to drop dramatically in the 1890s and 1900s as the production of chocolate began to shift away from the New World to Asia and Africa. Therefore, chocolate could be purchased by the middle class. Due to the lower cost of chocolate, it happened a problem that forced child labor. In 1900‚Äì1907, Cadbury's fell into a scandal due to their reliance on West African slave plantations. Although it was men leading the charge towards mass production of chocolate for everyday people, advertisements also targeted women, who ‚Äúwere charged with providing wholesome cocoa for respectable consumption within the family,‚Äù. Women were also targeted by advertising campaigns within courtship rituals, though most early advertising was aimed more at housewives and mothers than at single women. Modern use Roughly two-thirds of the world's cocoa is produced in Western Africa, with Ivory Coast being the largest source, producing a total crop of 1,448,992 tonnes. Ghana, Nigeria, and Cameroon are other West African countries among the top 5 cocoa-producing countries in the world. Like many food industry producers, individual cocoa farmers are at the mercy of volatile world markets. The price can vary from between ¬£500 ($945) and ¬£3,000 ($5,672) per ton in the space of just a few years. While investors trading in cocoa can dump shares at will, individual cocoa farmers can not ramp up production and abandon trees at anywhere near that pace. Only three to four percent of \\"cocoa futures\\" contracts traded in the cocoa markets ever end up in the physical delivery of cocoa. Every year seven to nine times more cocoa is bought and sold on the exchange than exists.

It is part of the Gwinnett County Public Schools. It serves the cities of Norcross and Peachtree Corners. Norcross High School occupies a facility at 5300 Spalding Drive which opened in August 2001. William Bishop is the current school principal. Norcross is the only high school in the Gwinnett County school system to have the IB Diploma Programme (1999). History =The 1900s= Municipal bonds were issued for a new modern brick schoolhouse in 1903, and another bond issue approved an additional school in 1914. These buildings stood side by side on College Street for many years in the center of Norcross and were preceded by an old wooden building at the same site. Before this older wooden school was destroyed, it became very unsteady. After the second red-brick building was constructed as a grammar school, the first building became Norcross High School. Both of the brick schools were demolished several years ago, although the first building was in use until 1970. According to a booklet compiled in 1923 and recently reprinted, the rural schools surrounding Norcross were Beaver Ruin with 60 students, Glover with 172, Mechanicsville School with 87, and Pittman with 60. Crabapple School, which was located at Pinckneyville, had apparently closed earlier. In 1933, a report printed in Flanigan's History, Volume I stated, \\"Norcross has three buildings valued at $60,000, and used thirteen teachers. For many years this has been one of the best schools in the county and is accredited first class.\\" A school for black children was located near Hopewell Baptist Church at that time, according to Clara Nesbit. Norcross Elementary School was built in 1939, and the Board of Trustees of the Norcross Consolidated School System listed on the cornerstone were H. L. Sudderth, J. Howard Webb, B. F. Summerour, B. W. Westbrook and C. A. Garner. This school is still in use, although many additions have been built through the years. With the completion of the new elementary school, the two older buildings \\"on the hill\\" became Norcross High School. When West Gwinnett High School was built in 1957, parents of Duluth students objected to consolidation and fought successfully to have a new high school built in Duluth. The citizens of Norcross later asked to have the name West Gwinnett changed back to Norcross High School. The school colors, blue and white, and the school mascot, the Blue Devil, were chosen by the students in 1957 when football was played as a school sport for the first time. =Present-day= Norcross High School front entrance Norcross High School opened a facility at 5300 Spalding Drive in Norcross in August 2001. This land was purchased by the Gwinnett County Public School System because a 1998 tornado cleared the land of trees. The new building shared the same design as its Gwinnett County neighbor, Peachtree Ridge High School. The former facility at 2595 Beaver Ruin Road was renamed Buchanan High School of Technology, which until July 2013 housed the Gwinnett Online Campus and GIVE Center West, a grade 6-12 alternative school. In January 2013, the Gwinnett County Board of Education voted to move GIVE and the online center to a new location, and the original Norcross High School was demolished. All existing buildings with the exception of the 1996 gymnasium were removed making way for the relocated Summerour Middle School, which opened for the 2015-2016 school year. The previous Summerour building had been next to the old NHS, and was itself torn down to make way for the new Baldwin Elementary. The school opened with a student population of 2,400, and as of 2015 had an estimated 4,000, one of the largest high schools in the state. It has since slightly decreased since the opening of nearby Paul Duke STEM High School in the 2018-2019 school year, which opened in part to relieve overcrowding at Norcross. Demographics The demographic breakdown of the 3,817 students enrolled in 2017-2018 was: *Male - 49.9% *Female - 50.1% *Native American/Alaskan - 0.2% *Asian/Pacific Islander - 6.8% *Black - 28.5% *Hispanic - 47.8% *White - 13.8% *Two or More Races - 2.8% 65.4% of the students were eligible for free or reduced lunch. Athletics Norcross competes in Region 7-AAAAAAA. The school's mascot is the Blue Devil. The school competes in football, baseball, softball, lacrosse, track and field, cross country, swimming and diving, wrestling, golf, soccer, tennis, volleyball, marching band, and competitive cheerleading. Norcross varsity boys' basketball team won the Class AAAAA Georgia state championship in 2006, 2007, 2008 and 2011, and the Class AAAAAA state championship 2013. The girls won the basketball state championship in 2010 and 2011. Norcross's football team won the 2012 and 2013 state championships.

The campaign ended in an Allied victory. It is one of the large-scale battles of the War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression, located in the border area between Yunnan Province, China and northern Myanmar, starting at the beginning of December 1943. The purpose of the battle is to open up the China-India Highway. At the end of March 1945, the Chinese Expeditionary Force, the British Army, and the Merrill's Marauders joined forces in Muse, Burma (Myanmar), while the Japanese Army lost the North Burma Stronghold. The Allied Forces were jointly formed by the troops of China, the United States and the United Kingdom. Among them, the Chinese participating forces included the Chinese Army in India and the Chinese Expeditionary Force. The commander-in-chief of the campaign was General Wei Lihuang of the Chinese National Army, and the deputy commander of the campaign was General Joseph Stilwell of the US Army. The main force of the Japanese army was the Japanese Burmese front. The commander of the battle was Masakazu Kawabe, then Heitaro Kimura, later Shinichi Tanaka and others. The total strength was more than 400,000 for Allied and 150,000 for Japan.. The Battle of Northern Myanmar and Western Yunnan lasted one and a half years. At the cost of 31,443 people killed and 35,948 wounded, the Allies killed more than 25,000 Japanese soldiers, opened the southwest China's international transportation line-the Burma Road, and recovered all the lost land on the west bank of the Salween River in western Yunnan. Background At the turn of spring and summer in 1942, the Japanese army captured Burma and immediately prepared to attack west Yunnan. They were expected to fight along Burma Road, conquer Yunnan and threaten Chongqing. On May 4, 1942, the Japanese army invaded Longling County, and at the same time dispatched 54 aircraft to carry out a violent bombing of Baoshan, Yunnan, the Millennium Ancient City; on the 10th, the Japanese army invaded the border city of Tengchong. At this point, a large area west of the Salween River (Nu River) fell into the hands of the Japanese army. The 71st Army of the Chinese Expeditionary Force set up defenses on the east bank of the Nu River, repeatedly frustrated the Japanese army‚Äôs attempt to move eastward, and thus stabilized the war situation, and confronted it across the river for two years. At that time, after the Burma Road, which was once the only land international transportation artery, was cut off, a large amount of military supplies to China could only be transported by the US Air Force through \\"The Hump\\" with much difficulty and no security. In order to regain control of the Burma Road, the six divisions of the Chinese Expeditionary Forces in India and the British and Indian forces jointly launched a counterattack against the Japanese army in northern Myanmar in late October 1943, and achieved initial results. On April 17, the following year, the Chinese Expeditionary Force carried out a counter-attack plan for crossing the river.

The company, founded by Leonard Spira, was a move into grand opera by the then amateur Gilbert and Sullivan-oriented Victorian Light Opera Co. The name changed to the Victorian Opera Company in 1964 in a move to enable the company to perform a broader repertoire. Early years Victoria Opera 1962‚Äì1976 An attempt to professionalise the company as the Victorian Opera Co was made by Alfred Ruskin, foundation chairman and Peter Burch, general manager (1970‚Äì1974), who in 1971 appointed Dame Joan Hammond to the board. In 1972 she brought Richard Divall to Melbourne. Richard Divall was to remain with the company as Music Director until 1996. In 1976 Dame Joan Hammond accepted a position at the Victorian College of the Arts and was replaced as chairman by John Day (1976‚Äì1982). Richard Divall instantly made his mark on the company, raising it to a new level of professionalism with a landmark production Of Monteverdi‚Äôs Coronation of Poppea directed by Rod Anderson and starring Marilyn Richardson. Through these early years the company made a major contribution to the popularization of Opera through its highly successful schools touring productions of specially commissioned works employing and giving work and experience to younger singers from the company. Another highlight of these years was a production of Donizetti's Maria Stuarda in July 1976, directed by Robin Lovejoy with a cast including Nance Grant and June Bronhill conducted by Richard Divall. This was to be the last opera produced under the Victoria Opera Company banner. Victoria State Opera 1976‚Äì1995 1996 Company letterhead of the Victoria State Opera In 1976 the new chairman John Day added the word 'State' to its title to become Victoria State Opera. He is quoted in The Age on 29 July 1976, saying that the new title had \\"more prestige\\" and \\"a more official cachet.\\" He stated further that, \\"The State Opera would not seek to emulate the lavishness of Australian Opera Company productions.\\" It would concentrate on attracting younger audiences with modern and experimental productions combining opera with music and drama. The subsidy from the Victorian State Government in 1975 was AUD165,000. In 1976 the VSO sought an increase to AUD$280,000 with an unchanged Federal Government subsidy of AUD56,000. The first production under the new banner was Gluck's Orfeo and Eurydice, starring Margaret Field, which opened at the National Theatre, St Kilda on 30 July 1976. Significant appointments in these early years include: * Ken Mackenzie-Forbes who joined the company as general manager in 1976 * Jeffrey Sher QC became chairman from 1979 to 1982 * Sir Rupert Hamer AC KCMG ED was chairman from 1982 to 1995Rupert Hamer In 1977 Robin Lovejoy was appointed Artistic Advisor to the Victoria State Opera. VSO productions he directed include: * Monteverdi's L'Orfeo (1977) Princess Theatre, Melbourne * Debussy's Pell√©as et M√©lisande (1977) Princess Theatre, Melbourne * Mozart's Idomeneo, designed by John Truscott, starring Australian tenor, Ronald Dowd (1978) Princess Theatre, Melbourne * Bizet's The Pearl Fishers, John Truscott (1979) Princess Theatre, Melbourne * Monteverdi's The Return of Ulysses (1980) Princess Theatre, Melbourne * Johann Strauss' Die Fledermaus, for which he also adapted the dialogue (1981) In 1982 Sir Rupert Hamer, the former premier of Victoria, became Chairman of the Victoria State Opera and was to remain in this position until 1995. It was a fitting appointment as Sir Rupert had been a vigorous supporter of the building of the Arts Centre Melbourne complex. From 1984 the company performed in the newly built State Theatre, part of the Arts Centre Melbourne, where it presented at least four to five operas a year over two seasons, which eventually rivalled those of the Australian Opera given in the same space. At its height, the VSO had over 13,000 season subscribers. In 1985 Brian Stacey was appointed as Head of Music. Other notable production highlights include appearances by Suzanne Steele, most notably in the lead role of La belle H√©l√®ne and as Eurydice in Orpheus in the Underworld. There were also Don Giovanni, Tannh√§user, The Pearl Fishers (which toured to Sydney), The Tales of Hoffmann, Faust, Aida, Il trovatore, The Barber of Seville, The Magic Flute, Andrea Ch√©nier, Turandot, Madama Butterfly (the traditional production by Andrew Sinclair or the Ken Russell production in 1986, as part of the Spoleto Festival) and a production of Lohengrin produced by August Everding. As the VSO designed their productions for the State Theatre, a 2077-seat theatre with one of the largest stages in the world, they were able to make full use of the facilities i.e. revolving stage, hydraulic stages and were able to create imaginative and exciting effects in their productions. Their first opera in the State Theatre was the new John Copley production of Verdi's Don Carlos in 1984. The curtains remained open during set changes so the audience could marvel at the machinery.

In that merger Richard Divall was appointed Principal Resident Conductor of Opera Australia from 1996 until 2001, Lindy Hume was appointed Associate Artistic Director with overall control, remaining in Sydney with Moffatt Oxenbould. That merger, which was to cover opera in New South Wales and Victoria, was not a success, and the newly named Opera Australia cut back the staff in Melbourne, and, while retaining an office in Melbourne, returned the great majority of its operations to Sydney. The Elizabethan Trust Melbourne Orchestra, formed in 1969 to support the Australian Opera and the Australian Ballet, survived the merger. In 1987 it was renamed the State Orchestra of Victoria (now Orchestra Victoria) and continues to support opera and ballet in the State Theatre. Opera Australia took on the responsibilities of performing opera in both the states of Victoria and New South Wales. More recently, the Victorian Opera has been formed with funding from the Victorian government to provide an opera company for Melbourne and Victoria.

It has the capability to perform shoreline reconnaissance when the risks may be deemed too high, or conditions unsuitable, for human operators. The Talisman system comprises a vehicle and remote control console. The vehicle can be re- programmed in mid-mission by satellite and features a carbon fibre hull giving it a stealth-like profile and low observability. Talisman can carry a wide variety of payloads, such as image capture, environmental sensors or mine counter measures. Programme history The Talisman programme was launched in late 2004, and was developed and managed by BAE Systems Underwater Systems and went from paper to initial trials in less than a year. Talisman has undergone a series of trials in the Irish Sea, with 100 per cent success rate. During further trials in late 2006, Talisman has become the first UUV to successfully fire and control weapons at sea during trials off the South Coast of England. The first remote sea launch of the Archerfish mine disposal system from Talisman was successfully completed during the trials. The mine neutraliser then acquired Talisman and subsequently simulated target eradication. In another deployment, also from the Talisman UUV, Archerfish successfully identified and acquired BAE Systems' versatile exercise mine system (VEMS). The vehicle The Talisman vehicle is based on an innovatively shaped carbon fibre composite hull, with internal pressure vessels containing the electronics systems and payload. The stealthy hull design was based on BAE Systems‚Äô aircraft technology. The vehicle weighs 1800kg, is approximately 4.5m long by 2.5m wide, can dive to 300m and has a top speed of 5 knots (9 km/h). It is fitted with vectorable thruster pods, which allow it to manoeuvre very accurately in difficult conditions, including strong currents, and over an extended period of time: the Talisman can be deployed 50 miles offshore and remain in operation for 24 hours. The precise handling in all directions comes from six thrusters, two at the front, and four at the back in two pairs. A rotary actuator is used to vector each pair of thrusters and to operate the hydroplanes. Talisman has been designed with a software architecture, which allows easy and rapid re-configuration of the mission systems. All mission parameters are pre-settable before launch, for full autonomous operation, with the possibility of operator intervention throughout the mission. Communications to and from the vehicle are via RF while the vehicle is surfaced and via acoustic communications systems when the vehicle is underwater. Payloads As standard the vehicle is equipped with a suite of environmental sensors. Other payloads are mission or role specific and can include sonar systems, mine countermeasures and even other UUVs such as Archerfish.

She saw service during the Napoleonic Wars, though is best known for her time spent as a prison ship. She was broken up in March 1854. Service history HMS York was one of many British warships ordered after they were most needed. Although the major naval battles of the Napoleonic Wars had already occurred by the time of her launching, York was employed on some notable campaigns. After her launch, York was under the command of Captain Robert Barton, and as part of Sir Samuel Hood's squadron, she participated in the occupation of Madeira. In 1809, York was on the West India Station, and was involved in the capture of Martinique. In April a strong French squadron arrived at the √éles des Saintes, south of Guadeloupe. There they were blockaded until 14 April, when a British force under Major-General Frederick Maitland and Captain Philip Beaver in , invaded and captured the islands. York was among the naval vessels that shared in the proceeds of the capture of the islands. In July‚ÄìAugust 1809 York was involved in the disastrous landings at Walcheren. York was later with the Mediterranean Squadron off Toulon. On 17 December 1813 York captured Marie Antoinette. Fate In 1819, York entered Portsmouth harbour, where she was stripped of her masts and guns, and converted into a prison ship. HMS York is best remembered in this state, thanks to a contemporary drawing by Edward William Cooke, which shows her fully converted, and with laundry above her decks where sails once would have been. She would have typically contained approximately 500 convicts. After many years at this harbour service, she was finally broken up in March 1854.

Although the score does not contain a key attribution, the symphony is usually described as being in D minor; much of it is in fact in the (modern) Dorian mode. A typical performance lasts about 25 minutes. The composer called the work \\"cold spring water\\" in opposition to many contemporary \\"cocktails\\"‚Äîa reference to the modernist gestures in post- war music. The symphony was premiered by the Helsinki Philharmonic Orchestra, conducted by the composer, on 19 February 1923 and had other performances under his direction in the following months.Barnett 2007, pp.299‚Äì303 The music The last three symphonies by Sibelius abandon traditional development and are more a matter of structured emotional urges; in the words of a 1912 diary entry, ‚ÄúI intend to let the musical thoughts and their development determine their own form in my soul.‚ÄùHepokoski 2001, p.322 This was echoed in his interview in the Svenska Dagbladet after a performance of the Sixth in Stockholm in March 1923: ‚ÄúI do not think of a symphony only as music in this or that number of bars, but rather as an expression of a spiritual creed, a phase in one‚Äôs inner life.‚ÄùBarnett 2007, pp.301‚Äì302 Although the symphony was completed only in 1923, musical ideas incorporated into it were being developed in his notebooks from 1914 onward, at the same time as he was also working on his Fifth Symphony; by 1918 it was taking more definite form, when he was working on the Seventh as well.Hepokoski 2001 By January 1923 his diary notes the final completion of the first three movements of the Sixth. He conducted the premiere on 19 February of that year. The work is scored for 2 flutes, 2 oboes, 2 clarinets, bass clarinet, 2 bassoons, 4 horns, 3 trumpets, 3 trombones, harp, timpani and strings. It has four movements: The symphony was dedicated to his Swedish musical advocate, the composer and conductor Wilhelm Stenhammar.

As they did, for example, for Benjamin Britten, converting him from a fixation on the avant-garde composers who influenced him when younger.Benjamin Britten, On Music, Oxford University 2003, p.277 It has also been claimed that one of the influences on the symphony was Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina, whose music the young Sibelius had studied.Tomi M√§kel√§, Jean Sibelius, The Boydell Press, 2011, p.4 The first commercial recording of the Sixth Symphony was made by Georg Schn√©evoigt with the Finnish National Orchestra on 8 June 1934 for HMV's Sibelius Society.Available on You Tube References Bibliography * * Barnett, Andrew, Sibelius, Yale University 2007, pp.299‚Äì303 * Hepokoski, James, ‚ÄúRotations, sketches and the Sixth Symphony‚Äù, Sibelius Studies, Cambridge University 2001, pp.322‚Äì51 \\"Sixth symphony op. 104 (1923)\\", Article at official Sibelius website External links * Symphony 6 Category:1923 compositions Category:Compositions in D minor ","title":"Symphony No. 6 (Sibelius)"},{"id":"6694026","text":"The Ohio Valley Electric Railway was a street railway and interurban system that ran between Huntington, West Virginia, and Ashland, Kentucky.

It is most commonly performed to treat tumors, especially craniopharyngioma tumors. Sometimes it is used to treat Cushing's syndrome due to pituitary adenoma or Simmond's disease It is also applied in neurosciences (in experiments with lab animals) to understand the functioning of hypophysis. There are various ways a hypophysectomy can be carried out. These methods include transsphenoidal hypophysectomy, open craniotomy, and stereotactic radiosurgery. Medications that are given as hormone replacement therapy following a complete hypophysectomy (removal of the pituitary gland) are often glucocorticoids. Secondary Addison's and hyperlipidemia can occur. Thyroid hormone is useful in controlling cholesterol metabolism that has been affected by pituitary deletion.  Methods of Hypophysectomy  Hypophysectomies can be performed in three ways. These include transsphenoidal hypophysectomy, open craniotomy, and stereotactic radiosurgery. Each of these methods differ in the method in which the pituitary gland is removed. = Transsphenoidal hypophysectomy = In a transsphenoidal hypophysectomy, the pituitary gland or section of the pituitary gland is removed through the sphenoid sinus and out through the nose. = Open Craniotomy = In an open craniotomy, a cavity is opened within the skull to reach the pituitary gland. Once the cavity is open, the pituitary gland is removed through the cavity. = Stereotactic Radiosurgery = in stereotactic radiosurgery, a headframe is applied to a patient. MRI or CT scans are then administered on the patient to allow a map of the head/brain to be formed. This map will then be used as a guide to allow correct orientation of the lasers administering radiation to specifically destroy the pituitary gland or part of the pituitary gland. Complications Hypophysectomy performed at any age causes atrophy of the thyroid and adrenal glands as well as asthenia and cachexia. When the procedure is performed before sexual maturity, the reproductive tract remains undeveloped and non-functional. There is also a general lack of growth. If performed after sexual maturity, there will be a loss of reproductive function along with atrophy of gonads and accessory reproductive structures. There is a risk of cerebral spinal fluid leak due to penetration of the basal skull and risk of increased cerebral spinal fluid pressure that may lead to central nervous system changes. Post surgery, patients may have a severely altered self-image that may lead to an increased risk of suicide. There is also an increased risk of hemorrhage and infection secondary to the surgical procedure.Swearingers.

At some point Levy sets out to amass information about the various alternate Earths so as to be able to travel through them more safely. To this end he contacts alternate versions of himself from hundreds of parallel Earths, and convinces them to help him. Next Levy frees the supervillains the Mauler Twins from prison on the condition that they help him create a machine that would allow him to copy the memories of his alternate reality counterparts into his own brain. With the aid of versions of themselves from other realities, the Mauler Twins are able to construct the machine. Levy is in the process of uploading the memories of his alternate selves when the process is interrupted by Invincible who is trying to apprehend the Maulers. The Maulers are on the verge of killing Invincible when Levy halts the machine to try to stop them, causing it to overload and explode. Unbeknownst to Invincible, Levy survives the explosion but is horribly mutated and suffers internal organ damage. Levy has been driven insane by his mutation and the influx of memories from his alternate selves and now believes that it was Invincible who stopped the machine. =Revenge= Surgeons are able to rebuild and even enhance Levy's body but are unable to correct his monstrous appearance. Levy is left with a burning hatred of Invincible whom he blames for the accident. He discovers that Invincible is really Mark Grayson by travelling to realities where his identity is public knowledge. Levy takes Mark's mother and his toddler baby brother hostage in their home and lures Mark in with a phone message. When Mark arrives to rescue his family, Levy sends him into various other realities (including the Marvel Universe and the DC Universe). While Mark is away, Levy mistreats his family, tossing the baby around and breaking his mother's arms in retaliation for a failed attack with a lamp. Levy's plan is to wear Mark down, and then kill him, then kill his family and all the alternate Marks. Mark tricks Levy into entering a portal while he is stranded on an abandoned wasteland of an Earth. Overestimating the success of Levy's enhancements, Mark seemingly beats him to death by accident. Mark is rescued from this wasteland by future versions of his friends, who had traveled through time and space to find him. =Return= At the end of Invincible #51, Angstrom is revealed to be spying on Mark as he sits atop his roof, via a small robotic camera. He is shown sitting in a room with many monitors, all with videos of Mark playing, and also with small electrical globes attached in his head. He has adopted a super villain style costume, complete with cape and new scars on his face from the previous encounter with Invincible. After spying on Mark for a number of months, Levy reveals his plan: gather evil versions of Invincible from other dimensions, and unleash them upon the first Mark's world. While this creates worldwide panic and death, the main goal is to ruin Invincible's reputation and cause him suffering. The world's superheroes unite, some giving their lives to battle and kill the murderous doubles of Invincible. In the end, Levy's plan fails as the Earth, though devastated, is not conquered. He escapes, but loses a limb, and upon arrival to the dimension of his doctors, loses their support and is informed that he now 'works for them'. Levy returns in Invincible #104, taking Eve hostage and again sends Mark to the alternate dimension where the evil Invincibles were exiled. Only two of the evil Invincibles remain - having eaten each other. A battle ensues between Mark and the primary cannibal Invincible, with Mark being aided by the other evil Invincible. In the meantime, Eve has a passionate discussion with Angstrom reminding him of his initial desire to help humanity which had become perverted due to the influx of memories from his alternate selves. Angstrom repents, and opens a portal to bring Mark home. Mark returns through the portal, accompanied by the one surviving evil Invincible. Angstrom explains to both of them that he wishes to pay for his crimes and help humanity, and opens a portal for the evil Invincible to return home. Seeking revenge, the evil Invincible grabs Angstrom and drags him through the portal with him, with Mark unable to speed to him in time to save him.

History alt= A picture from the side through the cockpit areas of several BMW C1 scooters which are parked side by side in perfect alignment Black BMW C1 Executive scooter parked on a pedestrian area in a city street BMW's intention with the C1 was to appeal to car drivers in crowded city streets. The idea was to offer the convenience of a scooter or motorbike but without many of the associated dangers or hassles. The C1's most innovative design feature was its emphasis on safety. However, being secured by a seat belt could make slow speed handling and manoeuvring rather tricky until experience is acquired. BMW added passive safety and car-like crash testing to the scooter. It claimed that in a head-on collision, the C1 offered a standard of accident protection comparable to a European compact car. That was the prime marketing strategy to convert car buyers; the C1 was claimed to be so safe that the rider did not need to wear a helmet to ride it. This was achieved by using two shoulder-height roll bars, a crumple zone around the front wheel and an aluminium roll cage creating a car-like safety cell. It also had twin seatbelts reminiscent of an aviation style four-point harness to keep the rider in place. Many countries deemed the use of seatbelts in conjunction with wearing a helmet to be unsafe. The added strain on the rider's neck from the added weight of the helmet could cause significant injury to the restrained rider even in a low speed head-on collision. Germany, Switzerland, Italy, France, Israel and Spain authorities were quick to allow an exception to the helmet law for the C1. However, poor C1 sales in the United Kingdom may in part be attributable to the British government's refusal of BMW's request to change helmet regulations for C1 riders. Another country that requires C1 riders to wear a helmet is Sweden, although wearing the seat-belts is voluntary. However both seat belts must be secured for the vehicle to move. After selling 10,614 units in 2001, BMW only sold 2,000 units in 2002, and ceased production of the C1 in October 2002. It was never made available in the United States.

Dressler (born 22 December 1939) is a polyglot Austrian professor of linguistics at the University of Vienna. Dressler is a scholar who has contributed to various fields of linguistics, especially phonology, morphology, text linguistics, clinical linguistics and child language development. He is an important representatives of the 'naturalness theory'. Career After studying linguistics and classical philology in Vienna (1957‚Äì1962), Dressler spent time in Rome and Paris, works both at the Austrian Academy of Sciences and the Department of Linguistics of the University of Vienna, finishing his habilitation in 1968. He joined the Department of Linguistics in Vienna in 1964. In 1970, he went to the United States, working as associate professor, and returned to Vienna in 1971, when he was appointed professor for general and applied linguistics at the University of Vienna. Since then, Dressler has been based there, while still travelling and teaching at other universities. Publications Dressler has written more than 400 publications, among them: *Dressler, W.U. & R. de Beaugrande 1981: Introduction to Text Linguistics. London, Longman 1981. Einf√ºhrung in die Textlinguistik. T√ºbingen, Niemeyer. *Dressler, W.U. 1985: Morphonology. Ann Arbor, Karoma Press. *Dressler, W.U. & W. Mayerthaler, O. Panagl, W.U. Wurzel 1988: Leitmotifs in Natural Morphology. Amsterdam, Benjamins. *Dressler, W.U. & Lavinia Merlini Barbaresi 1994: Morphopragmatics. Berlin: Mouton de Gruyter 1994. Linguistic research In the beginning of his career, Dressler worked on Indo-European topics. After 1969, he began publishing in the field of text linguistics. After a few publications within the then new framework of generative grammar, he permanently turned away from this model and has become a profound critic with a strong science-theoretical and semiotic background. Around the same time, Dressler worked on Breton language from a phonological, text linguistic and sociolinguistic perspective ('language death'). At that time morphology, phonology and morphonology were also of interest to him. Since 1972, what was later called 'sociophonology' has been developed, first as 'fast speech rules', later in a refined model on 'casual speech' and competing phonological processes and rules. From 1973 onwards, in search of 'external evidence' for linguistic theoretical assumptions (as opposed to generative models, but as an important science-theoretical background for theoretical arguments), Dressler became interested in the disturbed speech of aphasia. Similarly, he started to work with psychologists on a model of psychological '(de)activation' for phonological processes and, with his background in IE studies, he compared historical evidence with his phonological theory, making conclusions about rules, processes and the boundaries of phonological theory towards morpho(no)logy. In his contributions in morphology, Dressler established, together with Wolfgang Wurzel and Oswald Panagl, a subtheory of 'Natural Morphology' based on the establishment of more or less \\"natural\\" operations on universal, typological, or language-specific levels, respectively. In a monograph on morphonology, he proved morphonology to be a subtype of morphology, contrary to contemporary claims in generative phonology of its being treated as a phonological phenomenon. Dressler proposed a model of morphological operations between lexical and grammatical functions, thereby establishing a gradual scale between derivational and inflectional processes. His theory explains why derivational rules apply before inflectional rules, and why 'unprototypical' derivation such as diminutive and 'unprototypical' inflections such as plural formation sometimes get mixed in the middle: cf. German \\"Kind-er-chen\\" (child-PL-DIM), in which derivation occurs after inflection. For Dressler, language phenomena interact at different levels of linguistic organisation with more or less \\"natural\\" operations or states which might, however, lead to competition between them, so that an \\"ideal\\" state of the system is unlikely to be reached‚Äîwhich in turn may explain the usual grammaticalization channels in language change and language use. Therefore, Dressler coined the term 'polycentristic theory' of word formation in 1977, then in 1983 'polycentristic language theory'. Due to his science-theoretical interests, Dressler introduced a semiotic model (following Charles Sanders Peirce) into linguistic theory. This 'semiotic model' reappears in Dressler's publications time and again as prerequisite for theoretical assumptions in various fields. Dressler finally adopted the model of 'Natural Phonology' as developed by David Stampe and Patricia Donegan, but refined it with his semiotic science-theoretical considerations. This may seem an unnecessary addition, but in fact firmly puts the model on a very solid meta-theory. Following this new trend, together with Willi Mayerthaler, Oswald Panagl and Wolfgang U. Wurzel, Dressler coined the term 'Natural Morphology' for their way to look at morphological processes. Here again, a semiotic foundation of the model strongly influenced his explanations, much more than with the other authors. Dressler has to be named a typologist. Both in phonology and morphology, he sees the common ground of languages in more general principles of how signs can be used (= semiotics). Then, Dressler turned towards morphopragmatics, the pragmatic uses of morphological elements. He investigated the uses of diminutives and similar phenomena, again creatively combining formal and semantic (or pragmatic) aspects in innovative ways. Finally, Dressler developed a new model of language development, that of pre- and proto-morphology. Dressler assumes that language is self-organising in the child, thereby passing through a stage 'before' morphology and then through a stage of a very simple morphology, until finally the child learns to adapt to the adult target model of grammar. In other words, a child neither inherits nor learns a grammatical function, but is able to gradually derive the full morphological meaning from fewer and more concrete functions which are developed and discovered first.

The novels, set in turn of the 20th century Boston and pre-World War I Paris, are The Vanished Child (1992), The Knowledge of Water (1996), and A Citizen of the Country (2000). Reisden is an Austrian baron and chemist with an unexplained gap in his childhood memories. His 1905 return to America solves both the question of the murder of William Knight and the eighteen-year-old disappearance of Knight's grandson Richard. Reisden discovers that he is, in fact, Richard Knight. His grandfather was physically abusive and Richard shot him. Unable to deal with what he had done, the child stowed away on a ship that was bound for Africa. There, he lived the life of a street child, sometimes sleeping under a bridge or working for a junk seller. At age 10, Reisden was discovered by Count Leo von Loewenstein, a wealthy Austrian aristocrat and diplomat who was looking for children with just such an uncertain background whom he could raise to spy on upper crust radicals. Reisden was given a new identity as Baron Alexander von Reisden, the son of an Austrian couple who emigrated to Africa and then died. Having forgotten his earlier identity as Richard Knight, he was educated as an Austrian aristocrat and juvenile spy. Eventually, he rebelled against his guardian, married an actress and became a chemist. After his wife died in a car accident, Reisden had a nervous breakdown and attempted to kill himself. A few years later, he was mistaken for Richard Knight and went to Boston. After the events of The Vanished Child, Reisden decides to keep silent about his newly discovered identity and returns to Paris, where he eventually marries Perdita Halley, a visually impaired pianist who is close to Gilbert Knight, Reisden's recently re-discovered uncle. But Reisden's uncle and other associates of the Knight family continue to intrude upon Reisden's life in Paris. He is called upon to solve other mysteries while he attempts to integrate his memories of Richard Knight with his life as Reisden.

She was sporadically tutored by Henning Tideman, the teacher of her brother Anders Nordenflycht (1710‚Äì1740), in Latin and German, and studied philosophy and theology as an autodidact, being otherwise only educated in domestics and accomplishments.Hedvig Charlotta Nordenflycht, urn:sbl:8227, Svenskt biografiskt lexikon (art av Torkel St√•lmarck), h√§mtad 2015-11-22. In 1734, she was engaged against her will to Johan Tideman (1710‚Äì1737), a pupil of Christopher Polhem and supporter of the Wolffian philosophy. Johan Tideman and his naturalism and philosophy made a great impact upon her development and satisfied her intellectually, but she opposed their engagement because she did not find him physically attractive. The engagement was, however, broken by the early death of Tideman. On 23 April 1741 she married Jacob Fabricius (1704‚Äì1741), who had been her French language teacher, and was appointed chaplain of the admiralty at Karlskrona prior to their marriage. This marriage was not arranged and is described as a mutually happy love match: it was in fact opposed by her brother, who wished for a more socially and economically advantageous marriage which could benefit his own career, but she was supported by her mother.Hedvig Charlotta Nordenflycht, urn:sbl:8227, Svenskt biografiskt lexikon (art av Torkel St√•lmarck), h√§mtad 2015-11-22. She had no children during her marriage. Before here departure to Karlskrona, she wrote the poetic collection Cronstedtska poemboken, which was a gift to her friend countess Margaretha Beata Cronstedt. The death of her spouse in December 1741, only a couple of months after their wedding, caused a severe depressive chock. She retired to a rented cottage at Liding√∂ outside Stockholm to mourn, during which she wrote the Den s√∂rgande turtur-dufvan, poems describing her longing for her lost love and the nature of sadness and loss.Hedvig Charlotta Nordenflycht, urn:sbl:8227, Svenskt biografiskt lexikon (art av Torkel St√•lmarck), h√§mtad 2015-11-22. Nordenflycht returned to Stockholm after her mourning period, where she settled. Her economic situation had at that point deteriorated: her late spouse had no fortune and the inheritance after her father had been wasted by her brother. She was forced to support herself and decided to do so through her literary talent. In 1742, she debuted as a published author with Svenska fruntimrets klagan (The Lament of the Swedish Woman), a poem over queen Ulrika Eleonora. The same year she applied for a pension from the admiralty after her late spouse. Her application was granted the following year by an intervention from the king, who referred to the talent of her literary production.Hedvig Charlotta Nordenflycht, urn:sbl:8227, Svenskt biografiskt lexikon (art av Torkel St√•lmarck), h√§mtad 2015-11-22. She wrote poems for the royal house at several occasions, and was in 1747 granted a small allowance from crown princess Louisa Ulrika. Aside from the allowance from the crown princess and the small pension from the admiralty, she supported herself by writing poems on commission, and established herself as a successful writer. She courted Polhem, Linn√© and Abraham B√§ck with poems, and lived for long periods in the home of her personal friends, count and countess Cronstedt, in whose household she functioned as somewhat as a court poet.Hedvig Charlotta Nordenflycht, urn:sbl:8227, Svenskt biografiskt lexikon (art av Torkel St√•lmarck), h√§mtad 2015-11-22. After the Great Stockholm Fire of 1759 she and her mother lost their home, after which she successfully appealed to the Riksdag of the Estates for help, making a spectacular appeal in person to the clergy estate. She was granted an annual allowance for life in 1752, after which her economy was settled and she could concentrate on her writing without having to concern herself with monetary problems.Hedvig Charlotta Nordenflycht, urn:sbl:8227, Svenskt biografiskt lexikon (art av Torkel St√•lmarck), h√§mtad 2015-11-22. On 14 April 1753, Nordenflycht was inducted in Tankebyggarorden, a literary academy in Stockholm under the leadership of Carl Fredrik Eckleff, founded shortly before based on French role models, which had the purpose to reform the contemporary Swedish literature.Hedvig Charlotta Nordenflycht, urn:sbl:8227, Svenskt biografiskt lexikon (art av Torkel St√•lmarck), h√§mtad 2015-11-22. Nordenflycht's name as a member of the academy was \\"Uranie\\", and she made it a center of a literary salon. In the academy, she became closely affiliated with Gustaf Philip Creutz and Gustaf Fredrik Gyllenborg, but her conflicts with Olof von Dahlin is well known.Hedvig Charlotta Nordenflycht, urn:sbl:8227, Svenskt biografiskt lexikon (art av Torkel St√•lmarck), h√§mtad 2015-11-22. Nordenflycht has been described as hostile to other women writers. This description originates from an allegation of Olof von Dahlin, who describes an incident where he claims that she became enraged when she was at one point asked why she was the only female member of the Tankebyggarorden, because she considered herself the only female worthy of such an honor. These ideas are also upheld by the fact that she failed to promote several other female writers during her time in the Order (√ñfversigt af fru Nordenflychts franska period. Kruse) It must be pointed out, however, that von Dahlin and Nordenflycht were known antagonists who made several negative accusations toward and about each other during their lifetime. This is also contradicted by the behavior of Nordenflycht during her lifetime: she was a friend and correspondent of fellow feminist writer Catharina Ahlgren, and enthusiastic in her support of other female writers, such as the group of female writers in Norrk√∂ping, Charlotta L√∂fgren, Hedvig L√∂fwenski√∂ld, Hedwig Walldorff and Margareta Gryzell, the first of whom she addressed in her original sketch of Fruentimrets f√∂rsvar .Sven G. Hansson (1991). Satir och kvinnokamp. I Hedvig Charlotta Nordenflychts diktning.. Carlsson Bokf√∂rlag. In 1762, Nordenflycht settled in a small villa she had built in the country side near Skokloster, which she called Lugnet (Calmness). At this point, she was in love with Johan Fischerstr√∂m, seventeen years her junior.Hedvig Charlotta Nordenflycht, urn:sbl:8227, Svenskt biografiskt lexikon (art av Torkel St√•lmarck), h√§mtad 2015-11-22. Johan Fischerstr√∂m, born in 1735, was a student from Lund University with radical ideas and literary interests, who had made her acquaintance in the circles of the Tankebyggarorden. When Nordenflycht moved to Lugnet, she arranged for Fischerstr√∂m to be given a position at the Sj√∂√∂ Castle, the home of her personal friend Cath√©rine Charlotte De la Gardie.Hedvig Charlotta Nordenflycht, urn:sbl:8227, Svenskt biografiskt lexikon (art av Torkel St√•lmarck), h√§mtad 2015-11-22. Her last poems took place during which was evidently a love triangle between Nordenflycht, Fischerstr√∂m and De la Gardie during the winter of 1762‚Äì63.Carin √ñsterberg: Svenska kvinnor: F√∂reg√•ngare, nyskapare (Swedish women: Predecessors, pioneers) 1990 (Swedish) Johan Fischerstr√∂m became the inspector of the estate and courted De la Gardie, which made the situation unbearable for Nordenflycht.Carin √ñsterberg: Svenska kvinnor: F√∂reg√•ngare, nyskapare (Swedish women: Predecessors, pioneers) 1990 (Swedish) The prose Fr√∂jas r√§fst portray pastoral love, while her famous poem √ñfver en hyacint describes clear sighted resignation in the midst of the disappointment of love.Hedvig Charlotta Nordenflycht, urn:sbl:8227, Svenskt biografiskt lexikon (art av Torkel St√•lmarck), h√§mtad 2015-11-22. Her death gave rise to rumors that she had committed suicide.Hedvig Charlotta Nordenflycht, urn:sbl:8227, Svenskt biografiskt lexikon (art av Torkel St√•lmarck), h√§mtad 2015-11-22. According to contemporary legend, she attempted to swim over the water separating her from her beloved, which failed but resulted in a cold which took her life.Hedvig Charlotta Nordenflycht, urn:sbl:8227, Svenskt biografiskt lexikon (art av Torkel St√•lmarck), h√§mtad 2015-11-22. Whether she did commit suicide is unknown, but whatever the case, she suffered from an illness by the time of her death, the symptoms which are described and are similar to the symptoms of cancer.Hedvig Charlotta Nordenflycht, urn:sbl:8227, Svenskt biografiskt lexikon (art av Torkel St√•lmarck), h√§mtad 2015-11-22. Literary career She published the Den s√∂rgande turtur-dufvan in 1743, and the works of her late spouse, Amaranter, the following year. In 1746, she courted the Riksdag of the Estates with the patriotic poem Den fr√§lsta Swea. With her poem Vigtiga fr√•gor til en l√§rd, in which she asked Ludvig Holberg to bring order in the confusion between religion and science, she became known outside of Sweden.Hedvig Charlotta Nordenflycht, urn:sbl:8227, Svenskt biografiskt lexikon (art av Torkel St√•lmarck), h√§mtad 2015-11-22. Nordenflycht had a feminist approach early in her production.Hedvig Charlotta Nordenflycht, urn:sbl:8227, Svenskt biografiskt lexikon (art av Torkel St√•lmarck), h√§mtad 2015-11-22. In her first published poem, the funeral poem over the late queen, she made herself the spokesperson of her own sex. She named her collected works of four volumes Qvinligit tankespel (Female Reflections). Initially using the pseudonym En Herdinna i Norden (Shepherdess of the North), she continued by publishing under her own name, which was at the time not common. Her willingness to play a public role as a literary woman could be regarded as a step in her defense of women's right to be intellectually active, and disprove the traditional disbelief in women's intellectual capacity by making herself an example.Hedvig Charlotta Nordenflycht, urn:sbl:8227, Svenskt biografiskt lexikon (art av Torkel St√•lmarck), h√§mtad 2015-11-22. Already in her non published Cronstedtska poemboken, she included the poem Fruentimbers plikt at up√∂fva deras vett (The Duty of Women to use their wit), and her defense of women's intelligence are often displayed in her work, most notably in her famous Fruentimrets f√∂rsvar (Defense of Women) from 1761, written in opposition to the misogyny of Rousseau.Hedvig Charlotta Nordenflycht, urn:sbl:8227, Svenskt biografiskt lexikon (art av Torkel St√•lmarck), h√§mtad 2015-11-22. In Friarekonsten (Art of proposing), she warns women, that men's assurances of friendship often turned to a demand of obedience after marriage.Christensson, J. (red.) (2007). Signums svenska kulturhistoria. Gustavianska tiden. Stockholm: Signum. In parallel to being a supporter of the scientific age of enlightenment, however, she was somewhat skeptic to the idea that the knowledge of science (in oppose to the emotional mysticism of religion) in itself could give happiness, a doubt she expressed in Till Criton (1754), written to Carl Klingenberg.Hedvig Charlotta Nordenflycht, urn:sbl:8227, Svenskt biografiskt lexikon (art av Torkel St√•lmarck), h√§mtad 2015-11-22. Her cousin Carl Klingenberg (d. 1757) was until his death important as a representative of rational science, and his death caused her a severe depression. In close cooperation with the other academy members of Tankebyggarorden, Gustaf Philip Creutz and Gustaf Fredric Gylleborg, she published two volumes of Witterhets arbeten (1759‚Äì62), which has been referred to as the breakthrough of the literary classicism in Sweden.Hedvig Charlotta Nordenflycht, urn:sbl:8227, Svenskt biografiskt lexikon (art av Torkel St√•lmarck), h√§mtad 2015-11-22. During the 1750s, her style became more in the line of classicism, during which she became known and appreciated in Germany, and was awarded by Empress Elizabeth of Russia for her poem to the Russian heir to the throne.Hedvig Charlotta Nordenflycht, urn:sbl:8227, Svenskt biografiskt lexikon (art av Torkel St√•lmarck), h√§mtad 2015-11-22. As a poet, Nordenflycht is known for describing the existential conflict between religion and science during the age of enlightenment, and for her depictions of the emotional symptoms of human love and sorrow.Hedvig Charlotta Nordenflycht, urn:sbl:8227, Svenskt biografiskt lexikon (art av Torkel St√•lmarck), h√§mtad 2015-11-22. Known as sensitive and emotional person, she was also practical, logical and strong willed when it came to her defense of her own literary position, and her ideological defense of women's intellectual capacity.Hedvig Charlotta Nordenflycht, urn:sbl:8227, Svenskt biografiskt lexikon (art av Torkel St√•lmarck), h√§mtad 2015-11-22.

Hartwig for Rapid-Film/Intercontinental Filmgesellschaft.Munden, 2007. p.549 The film stars Alexander D'Arcy as Gary Webster, a talent agent who invites several girls to a club in Singapore. Their plane ride ends abruptly when they crash-land into the ocean. Webster and the women make their way to an island where they find a larger spider web. A giant spider sinks its teeth into Webster which turns him into a mutant. The film was released in the United States in 1962, and has been released with various English titles including It's Hot in Paradise, Hot in Paradise, Girls of Spider Island and Spider's Web. It was featured on the television series Mystery Science Theater 3000 in 1999. Plot Gary Webster (Alexander D'Arcy), a nightclub manager, flies a group of women from New York City to dance in his club in Singapore. While flying over the Pacific Ocean, their plane catches fire, splits in half, and plummets into the ocean; oddly enough, no one in Gary's group is killed. We next see the group a few days later, suffering from dehydration on a life raft, before they finally spot a small island and stagger to dry land. Shortly thereafter, they discover fresh water and decide to go exploring. They are quickly relieved to find a cabin, but delight turns to horror when they open the door to discover a dead man hanging from a gigantic spider web. According to his journal, the man was a Professor Green researching and mining for uranium, but he feared something terrible was about to happen to him. There's no indication how long the professor planned to be on the island, but the women estimate there is enough food to last them about a month. That night, Gary proceeds alone out onto the island where he is bitten by a giant spider and turns into some type of spider-man beast. He flees into the woods, leaving the women to wonder what has happened to him. The next day, seemingly possessed by uncontrollable violent urges, Gary kills one of the girls. The remaining women, still unaware of what has happened to him, have no idea that he is the one who has done this. Twenty-eight days pass, and the women are running low on food when they spot a ship on the horizon. They are unable to signal it before it leaves, but two men arrive in a rowboat with supplies for the professor. They soon find the women, who tell them the professor is dead. As they all wait for the ship to return, they celebrate their last night on the island with a wild party. One of the men sneaks off to rendezvous with a woman, but both end up being killed by Gary. Finally aware of Gary's fate, the remainder of the group hunts him down with torches until he flees into quicksand and dies. Yet before he dies, he releases his spider eggs, which are sent off into the island.

The film was featured on the television series Mystery Science Theater 3000 in 1999. Reception Horrors of Spider Island received mostly negative reviews from critics upon its release, with many criticizing the film for its poor quality, although some have noted the same aspects of the film contributed to its inept charm. Author and film critic Leonard Maltin awarded the film 1.5 out of 4 stars, calling it a \\"well-photographed sex film, typical of the period\\", with sci-fi elements almost casually tossed in. Allmovie also gave the film 1.5 out of 5 stars, stating that \\"while the primary purpose of this German-made oddity is to show scantily clad women imperiled by a decidedly male beast, it's also attractively photographed, and several scenes (most notably, Gary's first post-bite attack, and his final flight through a swamp) deliver a frisson not usually found in nudie-cutie/monster movie hybrid\\". Brett Gallman from Oh, the Horror! panned the film, writing, \\"No matter which mode it‚Äôs in, the film is mostly incompetent. Shots are staged with little imagination, the (presumably) stock music is often incongruous with what‚Äôs on the screen, and the acting turns are woeful\\". Gallman also criticized the film's poor dubbing, monster design and frequent day for night sequences. Mondo Digital.com gave the film a mixed review, complimenting its atmosphere while acknowledging the film's faults, stating, \\"While watchable even in its shortest version, Horrors of Spider Island becomes a delirious experience with the added nude swimming footage. The atrocious dubbing contains some of the more quotable one-liners around, while D'Arcy's weird but decidedly non-threatening monster makes up for the decided lack of actual arachnids on screen\\". George R. Reis from DVD Drive-In.com gave the film a positive review, commending the film's climax as \\"moody\\" and \\"well-photographed\\".

On August 19, 1861, Union forces led by Col. Henry Dougherty were able to destroy a Confederate camp. There had been a number of clashes in the Charleston and Bird's Point area for the previous week between pro-Union forces and secession groups. Battle Colonel Dougherty, commanding the 22nd Illinois Infantry and Lieutenant Colonel Ransom of the 11th Illinois, which was stationed at Bird's Point, took 250 men and went by train to Charleston, where a force of Confederate infantry and cavalry belonging to the Missouri state troops was stationed. When near the city the troops were divided into two parties, one commanded by Dougherty and the other by Lieutenant Colonel Hart. About 100 yards from the public square the cavalry, numbering about 200, was drawn up to halt the progress of the Federals. One volley drove them into a cornfield. Dougherty then ordered the men forward at the double-quick to the public square, where the main body of the infantry was encountered. The enemy took shelter behind the houses and poured a heavy fire on the Union troops. In the meantime the cavalry had been rallied and attacked Hart, who faced his men both ways and succeeded in dispersing them. Col. J. H. Hunter, commanding the Confederates, then retreated and was afterward placed under arrest. =Capture of Fish Lake Camp= Captain R. D. Noleman along with 50 men of the Centralia Cavalry advanced upon Charleston; passed through the streets without any resistance and captured two rebels, who informed the Captain that the forces under Colonel Dougherty had preceded them and had engaged the enemy. They also informed the Captain that there was an encampment of mounted rebels at a point near or upon what is called Fish Lake, 5 miles east of Charleston, and about 2¬Ω miles north of the railroad. Taking one of the captured men for a guide, Noleman took up the line of march in the direction indicated. Noleman came upon the enemy's camp, which was situated in a dense wood which surrounded an open space of some eight acres. Day was just breaking and Noleman's men fired some forty shots and the enemy replied. The rebels then laid down their arms and surrendered. Noleman's men took 33 men prisoners, captured 38 horses, and took possession of about the same number of rifles and shotguns, together with accouterments and ammunition.

After establishing herself as the host of MMUSA's Tastemakers program, Juliya Chernetsky, along with network producers, created Uranium as an outlet for the broad range of heavy metal subgenres. Debuting in 2002 and hosted by a 19-year-old Chernetsky, it served as Fuse TV's equivalent to MTV's Headbangers Ball, a long-canceled series that was revived shortly after Uranium's debut. With new episodes premiering Friday nights at 9pm ET, the program traditionally ran a half-hour featuring an interview with a band and music videos. Uranium ended in 2006 due to Juliya's departure from Fuse TV, but reruns still occasionally air late at night. Current airings often consist entirely of video blocks without interview segments. Over the years, Fuse TV has introduced various new programs in place of Uranium, and Chernetsky has continued her career in heavy metal journalism. Format and style Although basic camera equipment was used on Uranium, Juliya was always equipped with her digital camcorder throughout the show. This gave the effect of a video diary appropriately known as Juliya's Diary. As she interviewed bands, talked to fans, and attended live concerts, the view would switch back and forth from the conventional camera to the black & white view of Juliya's camcorder. Perhaps due to the annoyance it presented, band members would often tease Juliya about her camcorder and occasionally take it away from her during interview segments. One of the first (if not the first) episodes of the program featured Juliya simply asking heavy metal fans what bands they think have been the most influential in the past ten years. The episode featured music videos by Metallica and Linkin Park as well as other mainstream groups of the general metal genre, in contrast to the show's more underground approach it would eventually lean toward. Throughout its time on the air, the show featured a black & orange color scheme and a stylized devil horn hand gesture as its official logo. Music videos A wide variety of heavy metal music videos aired on Uranium, including those by bands of the underground scene. Some videos, such as Cradle of Filth's bondage themed \\"Babalon AD (So Glad For The Madness)\\" and the brutally violent \\"D.O.A.\\" by The Haunted, were virtually exclusive to the show due to the stricter censorship regulations of MTV. Although more mainstream styles of music were not commonly featured on Uranium, occasionally, bands like Audioslave and Velvet Revolver managed to find exposure on the program. Notable interviews Throughout its time on the air, Uranium had its share of memorable interviews. Just prior to their official reuniting, New York City band Life of Agony accepted an interview by Juliya with lead vocalist Keith Caputo being interviewed separately from the rest of the group. The band had a profound impact on Juliya, and toward the end of the interview, which was held in a restroom, Juliya became misty eyed and cracked up, receiving hugs from the band members. Serj Tankian and Daron Malakian of the alternative metal band System of a Down were interviewed on their tour bus in 2002. The interview was notable for the sarcastic answers of the two members much to Juliya's dissatisfaction. Serj Tankian actually commented on her interview: Wow. Much time you got. In one of the final Uranium episodes in 2005, all members of System of a Down would be interviewed. They would prove even more indifferent to the second interview ‚Äì so much that, during the end credits, production crew members began disputing with them over their lack of conformity.Bowar, Chad Mistress Juliya Interview About.com. Retrieved on 2-20-09 During Marilyn Manson's promotion of the album The Golden Age of Grotesque, he agreed to an interview with Juliya. The record dealt heavily with a 1930s German burlesque theme, and not long into the interview, Manson took the camcorder from Juliya, pointing at her cleavage and then attempting to aim it up her skirt. Despite Juliya's sultry on-camera persona, this proved too much for her, and she immediately pushed the camcorder away with a bashful grin. Possibly the most hyped interview for the program was that with Metallica which premiered October 24, 2003. This offered a rather rare TV interview with the group post St. Anger, and considering the traditionalist metal fan base of Uranium, Juliya made sure to ask the trying questions on many fans' minds in regards to Metallica's new musical approach. Unlike the typical format, this particular edition of Uranium gave total devotion to the interview and featured no music videos whatsoever. The original airing was followed by an edition of Uranium Classics consisting entirely of Metallica videos.Metallica on Fuse's Uranium Metallica.com (October 13, 2003). Retrieved on 2-20-09.

Spin-offs and aftermath For the early part of the 2000s (decade), Uranium offered one of the only TV programs for heavy metal fans. Even after the revival of Headbangers Ball on May 10, 2003, Uranium continued to thrive as one of the most popular shows on Fuse TV. In 2003, it created a spin-off, Uranium Classics, a solid block of heavy metal and hard rock music videos from the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s. This program commonly followed immediately after an episode of Uranium. As Uranium became less of a priority on Fuse TV, Juliya began hosting a new show entitled Metal Asylum. This short- lived program largely consisted of music videos but rarely featured interviews. By 2006, the status of Uranium was in question, and Juliya finally publicized her departure from Fuse, making certain the show's fate. She would go on to host another interview program, Thrash Talk, for Dovetail TV. In November 2007, Fuse TV aired an episode of Talking Metal On Fuse, allegedly the #1 metal podcast on iTunes. The program returned in February 2008 as a regular program on Fridays at midnight ET. Hosted by Mark Strigl and John Ostronomy, it features exclusive interviews and field packages in the podcast‚Äôs signature style.Richiedude \\"Talking Metal on FUSE TV\\" TheDailyRock.com (March 3, 2008).

Impact Uranium certainly helped launch the career of Juliya Chernetsky, as it was her first major television role. The show's popularity, in a time where few TV programs featured in-depth heavy metal coverage, may also be considered highly influential if not directly responsible for MTV2's need to revive the long-ceased Headbangers Ball over eight years after its initial cancellation. At one point, rumors even surfaced that Juliya would \\"jump ship\\" to host Headbangers Ball.MTV Headbangers Ball Returns The W (April 29, 2003). Retrieved November 29, 2007. These allegations were finally acknowledged and denied by Juliya herself on an episode of IMX.

Launched by Rear-Admiral Horatio Nelson on 22 July 1797, the assault was defeated, and on 25 July the remains of the landing party withdrew under a truce, having lost several hundred men. Nelson himself had been wounded in the arm, which was subsequently partially amputated: a stigma that he carried to his grave as a constant reminder of his failure. Background: Cape St. Vincent and C√°diz In February the British defeated a Spanish fleet near Cape St. Vincent but failed to strike a solid blow against the Spanish Navy in the uneven struggle. Admiral John Jervis sailed for Lisbon after the engagement, frustrated at the escape of several valuable prizes including the Sant√≠sima Trinidad. New orders from the Admiralty demanded that he subdue and blockade the Spanish port of C√°diz, where much of the battered Spanish squadron had sought shelter. The First Sea Lord thought that the ease of Jervis' victory over Jos√© de C√≥rdoba y Ramos guaranteed a successful attack on that southern harbour. Events proved otherwise. Jervis' ships besieged C√°diz but were repelled by unexpected Spanish resistance. The Spaniards, under Vice-Admiral Mazarredo, organized a flotilla of small gunboats converted from yachts. With a clear advantage in the harbour's shallow waters, these vessels manoeuvred in the darkness and savaged Jervis' heavy ships of the line, striking at their vulnerable areas with impunity.San Juan (2005), p. 92 Coastal batteries opened fire, joined by Spanish warships anchored at harbour, and drove the attackers back, causing the British to lose grip over the blockade and allowing several merchant convoys to slip in and out of the port. An air of mutiny spread over the British crews as their long stay at sea stretched on without results. In April Jervis shifted his gaze to Tenerife upon hearing that Spanish treasure convoys from America arrived regularly at that island. The admiral sent two reconnoitring frigates which surprised and caught two French and Spanish vessels in a night-time raid. Encouraged by this success, Jervis dispatched a small squadron under recently promoted Rear Admiral Horatio Nelson with the aim of seizing Santa Cruz by means of an amphibious attack. Execution On 14 July Nelson sailed for the Canaries aboard his flagship HMS Theseus, (Captain Miller), leading a squadron composed of HMS Culloden (Captain Troubridge), HMS Zealous (Captain Hood), all 74-gun ships; and the frigates HMS Seahorse (38 guns), commanded by Captain Fremantle, HMS Emerald (36 guns) led by Captain Waller, and HMS Terpsichore (32 guns) under Captain Bowen; as well as the hired armed cutter Fox under Lieutenant John Gibson, and a mortar boat, the Ray, under Lieutenant Crompton. (50 guns), under Captain Thompson, joined the flotilla once the attack had started. The expedition counted 400 guns and nearly 4,000 men. They arrived in the vicinity of Santa Cruz on 17 July. At Santa Cruz, Lieutenant General Antonio Guti√©rrez de Otero y Santayana, who had already twice defeated the British, hastened to prepare a defence following the British raid in April. Forts were rebuilt, field works expanded, and the batteries enlarged by doubling their emplacements to 91, with earth sacks piled around. From the city's soldiers, partisans, local hunters, militia, artillery, and sailors from the French gun-brig Mutine, which the British had captured in May while most of her crew was ashore, General Guti√©rrez scraped together a force of 1,700 men. =British plans= Nelson's plan called for a night-time landing under Troubridge: The frigates would approach the shore in stealth and disembark troops with a view to falling on the Spanish batteries north east of the harbour. Ray was then to open mortar fire on the city. Nelson's ships of the line would enter the harbour at break of dawn and seize the Spanish merchant ships and their cargo. Nelson sent a note to the Spanish authorities demanding the surrender of all Spanish cargo, and threatening the destruction of the city. On 20 July, Troubridge went aboard Theseus to finalize the plans. The attack would take place in two phases. The first phase involved 1000 seamen and marines landing at Valleseco beach, some two miles north of Santa Cruz harbour, from where the troops would surround and capture Fort Paso Alto. If the city had not surrendered at this point, then the landing party would march on the port and launch the final attack. Each ship of the line provided 200 men and each frigate 100, supported by 80 artillerymen. The battle The plan began the next evening. In the clearness of the summer Canary night, citizens realised that blurry figures were sailing towards the pier: the British boats, carrying the troops, were on their way. They were in two groups: one of 23 boats and launches heading for the Bufadero cliff; the other, 16, coming right into the city. Authorities were updated as adverse currents held the British back. No marine bombardment was likely as ships could not get any closer and even though frigates could, the frigates' naval guns could not be elevated sufficiently for their shot to reach the city. The British had just one mortar which, however, could inflict little damage. They had no howitzers, and carronades too were of no use in this situation. Spanish cannons began firing heavily on the boats, wrecking some of them. The currents were too strong and the British decided to go back to the ships. In a second attempt, boats towed frigates close to the Bufadero, where they anchored. Despite the Paso Alto castle firing on them, the contrary currents, and the lack of animals to carry the artillery, 1,000 British soldiers landed on Valleseco beach with some equipment. In the middle of the night, some of the boats did not reach the beach and ended up strewn around, as no British officers knew its location. During 23 July a heavy cannonade and musketry duel took place. Guti√©rrez managed to recruit more effectives and station them in the castle, as well as moving the forces from the Sta. Cruz fortress, now unnecessary, on to Paso Alto. The British, who lost two men, were under pressure and had a difficult time. Nelson, from the Theseus, called the troops back. Once they were on board, the three frigates slipped before the Candelaria beach and the Barranco Hondo, firing into the cliffs, intending to frighten and silence the defenders. With the British thwarted in Valleseco, Guti√©rrez guessed Nelson's next move and brought most of the artillerymen to the port batteries, leaving just 30 militia men in Paso Alto. The British could not see the Spanish troops' movements from one place to another, so they deemed the Spanish force larger than it actually was. Sir Horatio Nelson when wounded at Teneriffe by Richard Westall. Oil on canvas. The Castle of San Andr√©s played an important role in the battle. Enraged by the failure of the first stage of his plan, Nelson called his captains on board Theseus and explained how he himself would lead the next move ahead of a boat group followed by five more boats led by captains Troubrige, Miller, Hood, Waller and Thompson straight to the San Crist√≥bal castle, in Sta. Cruz harbour, where Guti√©rrez had by now assembled his best troops. In order to reduce the noise, cloth-padded oars propelled the boats at 10:30 p.m. on 24 July from around the Zealous into the harbour. The Spanish frigate San Jos√©, anchored 500 metres away from the pier, fired an alarm shot when sailors on board heard the disembarking troops getting closer. Troubled waters were against the British, who amounted to 700 in the boats, supported by 180 in the cutter Fox and 80 in a Canary sloop taken earlier. In addition to San Crist√≥bal castle, General Guti√©rrez split his force over four strategic points: Pila square, Santos stream, Carnicer√≠as beach and Santo Domingo monastery. At around 23:00 a rain of cannonballs and musket bullets from the batteries of Paso Alto, San Miguel, San Antonio and San Pedro fell on the approaching British whose own ammunition was damp with seawater. Several shots reached the cutter's hull. Some of the boats reached the beaches and marines managed to spike a couple of cannons, yet others drifted away. Spanish mortars and cannons focused on the successful sailors and swept them away. Many British casualties were left scattered on the beach. An immense line of fire, ranged from Paso Alto to San Telmo castle, targeted the small vessels. Before midnight the cutter Fox was hit by crossfire from the heights and sunk, with Gibson and 17 of his men being drowned. British forces led by Bowen rushed the battery covering the harbour, captured it and spiked its guns. They began to pursue the fleeing Spanish into the town, but were swept by a hail of grapeshot. Bowen, his first lieutenant (George Thorp), and several of his men were killed, while Nelson, who was just landing from his boat, was hit in the right arm. Those soldiers who succeeded in reaching the beach were riddled with bullets from house terraces and windows. The citizens were so closely involved in repelling the attack to the point that, after the victory, some were given honours and medals. Nelson was bleeding copiously and his stepson, Lieutenant Nisbet, cut a piece of his own neck handkerchief and tied it tightly around Nelson's arm to stop the bleeding. The admiral refused to use the frigate Seahorse that was stationed close by, to be taken back to his flagship, as it would imply that Captain Fremantle would have to hoist a flag of distress and thereby demoralise the crews. Instead, the sailors of his boat rowed hard back to the Theseus. The surgeon had been warned of the contingency and got his instruments ready. Nelson was cited as saying, as he pointed to his right arm \\"Doctor, I want to get rid of this useless piece of flesh here\\". Nelson's operation was quick and aseptic, and most of the arm was amputated. The limb was thrown overboard (as was common practice in the day), despite the admiral's wish to keep it. The batteries increased the cannonade when they noticed that almost half of the thousand British soldiers had managed to land on the Carnicer√≠as beach and were attempting to slip into the city. Captains Troubridge and Hood, leading 350 men, accomplished the taking of La Consolaci√≥n convent. However, the rest of the troops were defeated when they tried to assault the San Crist√≥bal fortress from behind. Troubridge was aware of his desperate situation with no support from ships or more reinforcements coming to his aid, but sent a message to Gutierrez demanding the surrender of the San Jose or he would burn the town. Guti√©rrez, a veteran soldier, refused. In the meantime, the Spanish general ordered the fire on the besieged British to be increased while he brought more artillerymen to the batteries closer to La Consolaci√≥n. The rest of the British forces achieved disembarkation in Las Carnicer√≠as and proceeded through the Santos cliff. Despite the heavy fire from the Spanish fortresses, these men succeeded in joining Troubridge after being bottled up in Sto. Domingo square. Guti√©rrez had the Canarias battalion blockade the pier so that Troubridge could not make any escape back, nor could any support come in. Two columns headed for the harbour, one behind the Sto. Domingo square in order to hinder the British advance inside the city and the other along the coast. In the morning, a convalescent Nelson attempted to reinforce Troubridge by sending 15 boats into the pier. At around 1:00 am, Spanish gunfire swept the small squadron. Three of them were sunk with more than 30 drowned, the rest rowed back shocked. Captain Troubridge sent another message to Guti√©rrez through Captain Hood, requesting honourable terms for a withdrawal. Gutierrez agreed to this, and by 7.00 am a truce was signed that allowed the remaining British forces to return to their ships with full military honours. For his part Hood undertook not to burn the town, or make any further attacks on Tenerife or the Canary Islands. Conclusion The Spanish suffered only 30 dead and 40 injured, while the British lost 250 dead and 128 wounded. The journey back to England was difficult, as Nelson had lost many men. Guti√©rrez lent Nelson two schooners to help the shot-torn British on their way back. The Spanish general also allowed the British to leave with their arms and war honours. At his return to England, Nelson sent a thank you letter to Guti√©rrez for his compassion, along with some beer and English cheese. Guti√©rrez responded with another letter to Nelson, and some Spanish wine and cheese. This acts of chivalry led to a courteous exchange of letters between Nelson and Guti√©rrez. Nevertheless, Nelson would later remark that Tenerife had been the most horrible hell he had ever endured--and not only for the loss of his arm. Nelson's letter offering a cheese as a token of his gratitude is actually on display at the new Spanish Army Museum in Toledo. Nelson agreed to report news of the attack back to the Peninsula; the frigate Esmeralda approached C√°diz in late July carrying reports of Guti√©rrez's victory. Jervis had expected the Union Jack to be flying over Santa Cruz and was furious when he learned about the fiasco: The Admiral apparently saw no difference between well-defended Spanish port cities such as C√°diz or Santa Cruz and the Spanish ships his squadron had beaten in February. Haughtiness and a lack of proper material and human resources for an invasion had drawn the British fleet to a painful defeat. The British never again tried to capture Santa Cruz. Current celebration Every year in July, the Recreation Gesta July 25 takes place in Santa Cruz de Tenerife, in which soldiers, wearing faithful reproductions of uniforms and weapons of the time, recall the victory of Santa Cruz de Tenerife over British troops. In Santa Cruz, where the remains of the ruins of the Castle of San Crist√≥bal are located, the plaza has a small museum where the canon that is reputed to have been the one that injured Nelson, El Tigre, is displayed.

Leroux. 1882. p. XI. Synopsis A king and a queen had no children. One day, the king was travelling (hunting to forget his childlessness in the Polish, inspecting his country in the Russian), and grew thirsty. He found a spring with a cup floating in it. Trying to grab the cup did not succeed; it always evaded his hands. When he dropped to drink directly, a creature in the well (the King Kostiei in Polish), grabbed his beard and would not free him until he promised to give it something: in Polish, the most precious thing in his palace, which was not there when he left it; in the Russian, something he knew nothing about, and which he would find on his return home. He promised. On his return, he found his wife had a son. He told no one of the exchange, but when the prince was grown, an old man appeared to him in the woods and told him to tell his father to make good on his bargain. When he told the king, the king told him the truth. The prince set out to pay it. He came to a lake where thirty ducks (Russian) or twelve geese (Polish) were swimming, and where there were clothes on the shore. He took one. The birds came ashore, changed into women, and dressed themselves, except the one whose dress he had. That one, as a bird, looked about, and begged the prince to give her back her clothing. He did so. She was grateful, told him that she was the youngest daughter of the man he had been promised to, and promised to aid him. She told him that when he reached her father, he was to approach him on his knees, without any fear. He obeyed her, although her father gave fearful yells. When he had nearly reached him, her father laughed and said it was well that he had not been frightened. In the morning, he ordered the prince to build him a marble palace in a day. He went to his room, the daughter came to him as a bee, and promised to do it for him, and the next day, the palace was built. The next day, he demanded that the prince pick out his youngest daughter from her sisters. She told him she would be the one with the ladybug on her eyelid (Polish) or fly on her cheek (Russian), and he was able to find her. The third day, he told the prince to make him a pair of boots. The prince was no shoemaker, and the youngest daughter told him that they must flee. She spat on the ground (Polish) or breathed on the window and made frost (Russian), and they fled. When the servants came for the prince, the spit or frost answered for them. Finally, he ordered the door broken, which revealed their flight. The servants chased them. The maiden turned herself into a river, the prince into the bridge, and put three roads into the forest over the bridge. The servants, not knowing which way to go, turned back. Her father told them that they had been the bridge and river. When the servants returned, the maiden turned herself and the prince into a dense forest, with many paths, and the servants became lost and could not find them. When they returned, her father decided to chase them himself. The maiden said that he could go no further than the first church. She demanded his cross. With it, she made herself a church and the prince a priest. Her father demanded if the priest had seen them, and he said that they had passed and had sent their greetings. Her father had to turn back. The shorter Polish version ends here. =Other variants= In the Russian and the longer Polish variants, they came to a town. The prince insisted on going to see it. She warned him that the king and queen would lead out a little child, but he must not kiss it, or he would forget her. She turned into a milestone to await him, but he kissed the child and forgot her. She turned herself into a flower to be trampled. An old man transplanted her, and found that whenever he left, the housework was done. A witch advised him to wait and throw a cloth over whatever moved. This revealed her, and he told that the prince was to marry. She went to the feast and got the cook to let her make the wedding cake. When it was cut, two doves flew out, and one of them begged the other to not abandon it, as the prince had abandoned the maiden. The prince got up at once, found her, found his horse, and rode off with her to his father's kingdom. Translations Andrew Lang included the Russian version King Kojata, in The Green Fairy Book. A. H.

The Bee Girl and Insect Woman) is a 1959, independently made, American black-and-white science fiction-horror film, produced and directed by Roger Corman, that stars Susan Cabot, Anthony Eisley, Michael Mark, and Barboura Morris. The film was originally released by Filmgroup as a double feature with Beast from Haunted Cave.http://www.goldenageofscifi.info/1959/wasp_woman.htmlDecember 24, 1959 issue of The Plain Speaker from Hazleton, Pennsylvania, Page 37 To pad out the film's running time when it was released to television two years later, a new prologue was added by director Jack Hill. Plot In Hill's prologue, a scientist, Dr. Eric Zinthrop (Michael Mark), is fired from his job at a honey farm for experimenting with wasps. The founder and owner of a large cosmetics company, Janice Starlin (Susan Cabot), is disturbed when her firm's sales begin to drop after it becomes apparent to her customer base that she is aging. Zinthrop has been able to extract enzymes from the royal jelly of the queen wasp that can reverse the aging process. Janice agrees to fund further research, at great cost, provided she can serve as his human subject. Displeased with the slowness of the results, she breaks into the scientist's laboratory after hours and injects herself with extra doses of the formula. Zinthrop becomes aware that some of the test creatures are becoming violent and goes to warn Janice, but before he can reach anyone, he gets into a car accident. He is thus temporarily missing and Janice goes through great trouble to find him, eventually taking over his care. Janice continues her clandestine use of the serum and sheds 20 years in a single weekend, but soon discovers that she is periodically transformed into a murderous, wasp-like creature. Eventually, Zinthrop throws a jar of carbolic acid at her face, and another character, using a chair, pushes her out of a high window, the impact killing her.

The station, owned by Rogers Communications, airs an Adult hits format, branded as Jack 103.1. The station placed 7th (last) in the fall 2018 Numeris Diary Survey for Victoria.http://assets.numeris.ca/Downloads/2018_Fall_Radio_DI_TopLineReports.pdf History CHTT began broadcasting on April 1, 1923 on the AM band as CFCL, airing on 410 meters (later on 910 kHz) with 500 watts of power, initially broadcasting a religious format under the ownership of the Centennial Methodist Church. In 1924, the CFCL studios relocated from the church to the Fletcher Brothers store on Douglas Street in Downtown Victoria. CFCL dropped its religious programming in 1925 when George Deauville bought the station and acquired a new licence for it, changed its call letters to CFCT and moved its studios to the Bank of Toronto (now part of Toronto-Dominion Bank) building on Douglas Street. CFCT moved around on the AM band several times during the next 16 years as it switched to 630 kHz in 1928, to 1430 (with a power reduction to 50 watts) in 1933, and then to 1450 in 1935. It increased power back to 500 watts in 1939 before settling at 1480 AM on March 29, 1941 (following the Havana Treaty). The Victoria Times-Colonist bought CFCT on October 1, 1941 and sold a half-interest in the station to Taylor, Pearson & Carson Ltd., with the two entities forming the Island Broadcasting Co. as CFCT's parent company and changing its calls to CJVI; it became a charter affiliate of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation's Dominion Network shortly after its formation in January 1944. When the Dominion Network dissolved in 1962, the station transferred its affiliation to the main CBC radio network. CJVI moved to 900 AM on May 15, 1945. Taylor, Pearson & Carson acquired majority ownership of CJVI in 1951, and its studios relocated to its present location at 817 Fort Street in downtown Victoria in 1952. CJVI increased its power to 5000 watts on July 28, 1954 at 2:26 PM to increase its coverage up Vancouver Island to north of Nanaimo, south to Seattle and east to the Lower Mainland as far as Chilliwack. Power was further increased to 10,000 watts in April 1957. Harold Carson, part of the Taylor, Pearson & Carson firm that owned CJVI, died in 1959, and his company became Selkirk Communications that year. In 1970, Selkirk acquired 100% ownership of CJVI, which switched to a country music format in November 1972 and began branding as VI 90 on January 22, 1979. The country format was dropped for a mix of adult contemporary and adult standards music in January 1984 as CJVI began broadcasting in AM stereo, but the format went fully AC about a year later. More oldies music was gradually brought into the programming until CJVI had an all-oldies format by 1988. Maclean-Hunter Ltd. bought CJVI parent Selkirk Communications in 1989 and transferred the ownership to Rogers Media immediately afterward. CJVI dropped its CBC affiliation in 1991 (one of the last privately owned former affiliates to do so). On September 1, 1995, CFMS-FM was purchased by Rogers from then-owner Capital Broadcasting, paired up with CJVI and renamed CIOC-FM on December 11. On April 1, 1997, CJVI dropped its oldies format for a news/talk format, identifying on-air as \\"Victoria's Information Superstation\\", but dropped that format and returned to oldies music on July 10, 1999. On September 2, 2000, CJVI moved to the FM band,Decision CRTC 2000-215 switching frequencies and bands with Camosun College station CKMO as it moved to 103.1 MHz and became CHTT, with a Top 40/CHR format branded as Hot 103; the first song played was \\"Bye, Bye, Bye\\" by N'Sync. In 2003, the format shifted to hot adult contemporary. On January 29, 2004, after playing \\"Love Song\\" by Sky, CHTT flipped to adult hits branded as Jack FM. The first song played on \\"Jack\\" was \\"Sharp Dressed Man\\" by ZZ Top. On February 24, 2015, CHTT flipped back to CHR as KiSS 103.1. The last song played on \\"Jack\\" was \\"Hit the Road, Jack\\" by The Stampeders, while the first song on \\"KiSS\\" was \\"Uptown Funk\\" by Mark Ronson and Bruno Mars.http://www.pugetsoundradio.com/2015/02/24/victorias-jack-fm- flips-kiss/ On August 7, 2019, all of the \\"KiSS\\" on-air staff were let go, and the station began promoting a major change to come the following week.

The Central London Railway opened in 1900 with electric locomotives hauling wooden carriages, but the heavy locomotives caused vibrations that could be felt in the buildings above the route. Following investigation it was found that conversion to electric multiple units solved the problem, so new motor cars were bought and replaced all the locomotives by June 1903. Trains normally ran with six-cars, four trailers and two motor-cars, although some trailers were equipped with control equipment to allow trains to be formed with 3 cars. Work started in 1912 on an extension to Ealing Broadway, and new more powerful motor cars were ordered. These arrived in 1915, but completion of the extension was delayed due to the outbreak of World War I, and the cars were stored. In 1917, they were lent to the Bakerloo line, where they ran on the newly opened extension to Watford Junction. They returned in 1920/21 when, formed with trailers converted from the original stock, they became the Ealing Stock. In 1925‚Äì28 the trains were reconstructed, replacing the gated ends with air-operated doors, allowing the number of guards to be reduced to two. After reconstruction of the Central London Railway tunnels, the trains were replaced by Standard Stock and the last of the original trains ran in service in 1939. Subsequently, a number of motor cars were rebuilt as sleet locomotives. Original trains Initially the Central London Railway (CLR) purchased 168 carriages from Ashbury Railway Carriage & Iron Co. and Brush. Made in 1900/01 and weighing 14 tons, these seated 48 passengers, 32 on longitudinal seating with 16 on transverse seating in the centre. The cars were high and wide, to run in tubes with a diameter of . The wooden carriage bodies were long on underframes, with wide platforms at each end. Sliding doors at the ends of the carriage led to these platforms that had lattice gates either side. Gatesman rode on the platforms between the cars and operated the gates. Locomotive and carriages at Shepherd's Bush tube station. The Board of Trade refused to allow trains with an electric locomotive at the head and tail as this would require power lines the length of the train so thirty-two larger locomotives were ordered, although the CLR only received 28. These were camel backed with four motors mounted on two bogies. Manned in the centre cab by a driver and second man, who would uncouple and couple the locomotive at the end of each journey, the locomotives took power from a positive centre rail at 500‚Äì550 V DC. Soon after opening, the company received complaints that vibration was felt in the buildings above the route. The Board of Trade appointed an investigating committee in January 1901, which reported in May that the problem was due to the large unsprung mass of the 44-ton locomotives, and the track. An experiment in August showed the vibrations could be reduced by rebuilding locomotives to reduce the unsprung mass to tons. The following month, after four of the carriages had been converted into motor cars and fitted with British Thomson-Houston control equipment that had been invented by Frank J. Sprague in Chicago, an electric multiple unit was tested. Electric multiple units The report, published February 1902, found that the multiple unit was superior, and in May 1902 the CLR ordered 64 motor cars, 40 from Birmingham Railway Carriage and Wagon and 24 from Metropolitan Amalgamated Railway Carriage & Wagon. Seating 42 passengers, 24 in transverse bays and 18 on longitudinal seating, these were powered by two GE66 traction motors. Deliveries started in January 1903 and by June the railway had converted its fleet. The locomotives were offered for sale, and 24 sold for scrap in 1906. Two were kept by the CLR for shunting in the depot yard, the last withdrawn in 1942. In 1904, six additional trailers from Birmingham arrived and sixty-six trailers were converted into control trailers. Normally trains were formed of six cars with motor cars at either end and control trailers in the centre, although sometimes seven-car trains were formed. Between 1912‚Äì14 tripcocks and deadman handles were fitted to the motor cars and control trailers; before then there were two men in the cab. Ealing Stock Great Western Railway had permission for a line from Ealing Broadway to a station near to CLR's Shepherd's Bush station, with a connection to the West London Railway and in 1911 there was agreement to connect the line to the Central London Railway and for the CLR to run trains to Ealing. Construction started in 1912 and the CLR ordered 24 new all-steel motor cars from Brush for the Ealing services. These were long and equipped with an incompatible traction control system, with automatic acceleration, controlling more powerful GE212 motors. Seating 32 in a heated saloon accessed by centre and end swing doors, these were the first tube cars without end gates. However, work on the line was stopped by the outbreak of World War I in 1914 and the 22 vehicles that had been received in 1915 were stored until 1917 when they were lent to the Bakerloo line. These ran on the extension to Watford Junction with Piccadilly line trailers until 1920/21 when they returned to the Central London. Trailer cars were modified with new control cables compatible with the new motor cars and heaters, as the line to Ealing was not in tunnel, and two groups of stock formed, known as Tunnel (or Local) Stock and Ealing Stock. As traffic to Ealing increased, in 1925/26 eight of the original motor cars were modified to augment the Ealing Stock. Services were mainly provided by 6-car trains, although off-peak 3-cars were provided west of Wood Lane. Seven car trains using the 1903 motor cars were considered under-powered, but an only few peak-hour seven car services were operated with Ealing Stock. Reconstruction Stock with air-doors first entered service on the London Underground in 1921, and from 1923 Standard Stock operated on the Hampstead line, and these allowed staff to be reduced to front and rear guards and a driver. A Central London car was experimentally rebuilt with air-doors in 1925, and by 1928 all cars had been converted, the work being carried out at the Union Construction Company at Feltham. The end platforms were enclosed and trailer cars were equipped with two openings with a single leaf sliding doors on each side. Motor cars had a single larger opening with a double-leaf sliding door and a guard's compartment with a hinged door. The sliding doors were pneumatically operated, later assisted with electrically controlled exhaust valves to speed up opening. In 1926/27, while the conversion was in progress, two six-car trains of 1906 Stock and 1920 Stock were borrowed from the Piccadilly line, the trailers fitted with smaller wheels to allow them to run in the smaller Central London tunnels. Fitting the air-doors reduced the number of seats, from 48 to 40 in the trailers and 42 to 30 in the motor cars. Replacement and withdrawal Motor cars were converted into sleet locomotives, and one is preserved at the London Transport Museum In 1933, the CLR passed with the rest of the Underground Electric Railways Company of London to the newly formed London Passenger Transport Board (LPTB). The 1935‚Äì40 New Works Programme included the extension of the Central London (renamed the Central line in 1937) to West Ruislip in the west and to Epping and Ongar in the East. The stations and tunnels were enlarged to take 8-car trains of Standard Stock, the first 6-car trains running in 1938. The 3 rail electrical system was converted to the system's standard 4 rail system in 1940. The Central London Stock was retired from service, with the last run in regular service being on 10 June 1939, followed by a farewell special on 12 July 1939. Afterwards, 36 of the cars were rebuilt into 18 sleet locomotives, numbered ESL100‚ÄìESL117, the driving ends of each car joined to make one double-ended vehicle. One of these trains can be found at the London Transport Museum Acton Depot.

Playing as a winger, Carter featured for Crystal Palace, Queens Park Rangers, Millwall, Liverpool, Arsenal, Oxford United and Portsmouth throughout his career. Following his retirement from football, Carter has been heavily involved in the world of property investment. Since 2015 Carter has been a member of the commercial sales team at Millwall. Career Carter began his professional career with brief spells at Crystal Palace and Queens Park Rangers, but failed to make a league appearance for either club. Millwall bought Carter in 1987 for ¬£15,000 from Queens Park Rangers and gave him his Football League debut in a 0‚Äì0 draw with Oldham at The Den in the Second Division. He quickly established himself in the Millwall first team and was an integral part of the team which gained Millwall promotion to the top flight in 1987‚Äì88, the first time ever in Millwall's 100-year history. Millwall in 1989 Carter was part of a side that included players such as Teddy Sheringham, Tony Cascarino and Terry Hurlock. Millwall made a strong start to the 1988‚Äì89 season where went top of the league at the beginning of October and remained in the top four most of the season, before a failure to win any of their final 10 league games saw them slip to tenth, their lowest position all season. They were relegated in bottom place the following season, but Carter initially stayed with Millwall. Carter left Millwall on 10 January 1991, when Kenny Dalglish signed him for Liverpool for a fee of ¬£800,000. Dalglish resigned shortly after, with Ronnie Moran taking temporary charge of the team for two months until Graeme Souness took over in April. Carter would play just eight first team games for Liverpool, and after just nine months at Anfield he was sold in a ¬£500,000 deal to Arsenal, the club he supported as a young boy, on 8 October 1991. He spent nearly four years at Highbury, but was never a regular first team player. Anders Limpar, Eddie McGoldrick and Glenn Helder were Arsenal's regular players in Carter's preferred position during his time at Arsenal. during his time there, Arsenal won the FA Cup and the League Cup in 1993 and in 1994 went on to win the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup, but Carter played no part in those finals, nor in the less important European Super Cup or FA Charity Shield matches. By contrast, he played the entirety of the club's surprise cup defeat to Wrexham in January 1992. In the following season Carter was loaned out to Oxford United. In all the winger made 29 appearances for the Gunners, scoring two goals. In the summer of 1995, with Graham having left the club for disciplinary reasons in February and new manager Bruce Rioch rebuilding the team, Carter signed for Portsmouth, where he spent three years. In 1998, Carter re-signed for Millwall, but did not have the same impact as his first spell there, with the club now languishing in Division Two. He was forced to retire from football at the end of the 1998‚Äì99 season as a result of a serious back injury. Carter made 149 appearances for Millwall, scoring 13 goals in all for the Lions. Carter has appeared for Arsenal in the Masters Cup Football competition for veteran players shown live on Sky Sports. He also plays for the Arsenal Charity Team, a team of ex Arsenal players and celebrities. Personal life Carter is of mixed ancestry, with his father originating from Lucknow in India. He was the first British Asian to play in the Premier League, although this was not known at the time as Carter did not publicly disclose his background and his name did not make it obvious.

During his posting as a war artist (August 1944 ‚Äì May 1946), he painted the movements of an aircraft carrier in the waters of Scotland and the activities of mine sweepers and motor torpedo boats in the English channel off Normandy. After the war, he obtained a grant from the Department of Veterans Affairs to study art in Mexico. He taught for several years in San Miguel de Allende, north of Mexico City. On 12 August 1950 he and his wife Reva, as well as Stirling Dickinson and five other American teachers, were deported from Mexico. The official reason was that they did not have proper work visas but the cause may have been a falling out with the owner of a rival art school. Leonard Brooks was eventually able to get the deportation order lifted through his contact with General Ignacio M.

Life  Starkey was born in Cheshire, probably at Wrenbury, to Thomas Starkey and Maud Mainwaring. His father likely held office in Wales and was wealthy enough to pay for his son's education. His mother, Maud, was a daughter of Sir John Mainwaring, one of the wealthiest men in the palatinate. He attended the University of Oxford and gained an MA at Magdalen College in 1521. He went to Padua with Thomas Lupset in 1523. Here he studied the works of Aristotle and admired the government of Venice. By 1529 he had entered the service of Reginald Pole as secretary. Together with Pole, Starkey went to Avignon in 1532 where he studied civil law, before returning to Padua. Starkey returned to England in late 1534 and caught the eye of Thomas Cromwell, chief minister to Henry VIII, in early 1535. Cromwell used Starkey to handle intelligence from Italy and as a royal propagandist. His deep ties to Reginald Pole proved somewhat detrimental to his career, especially after a manuscript of Pole's De unitate, a savage attack on Henry VIII, arrived in England in 1536. These same ties to Pole and his family made him a subject of investigation in the 1538 Exeter Conspiracy. He died on 25 August 1538, perhaps of plague.  Works  Between 1529 and 1532 Starkey wrote his A Dialogue between Pole and Lupset, later known as Starkey's England. Cast as a dialogue between Reginald Pole and Thomas Lupset, the Dialogue is one of the most significant works of political thought written in English in the first half of the sixteenth century. In 1536 he published An Exhortation to the People instructing them to Unity and Obedience, a defence of Royal Supremacy and commissioned by Thomas Cromwell. References *Kathleen M.

It is a predominantly rural highway that travels north- south, from NC 55, west of Newton Grove, to the Virginia state line near Virgilina, Virginia, where it continues on as Virginia State Route 96. It also connects the cities of Smithfield, Selma, Zebulon, Youngsville and Oxford. Route description Much of NC 96's route is through undeveloped and rural areas, though it travels through (and thus connects) the cities and towns of Virgilina, Oxford, Youngsville, Zebulon, and the Smithfield/Selma area along the way. NC 96 begins at NC 55 at a quiet rural intersection in the far northern edge of Sampson County. From there, NC 96 almost immediately enters Johnston County and winds primarily northward through southern Johnston County; crossing over NC 50 in Peacocks Crossing and Interstate 40 just north of Peacocks Crossroads along the way. Near Four Oaks, NC 96 turns northeastward to parallel Interstate 95 before intersecting and converging with US 701 and crossing over I-95 alongside it. From there, the highways immediately run into US 301, where NC 96 joins US 301 (while US 701 terminates there), crosses over the far eastern edge of Holts Lake, and enters the Smithfield area. NC 96 goes directly through the downtown districts of both Smithfield and Selma, crossing over Business Route US 70 and the main US 70 highway itself and being joined by NC 39 along the way. NC 96 leaves its concurrency with US 301 and NC 39 almost immediately after traveling through downtown Selma and continues its northbound trek. The rest of the highway's journey through Johnston County is mostly rural, with intersections with NC 42 and NC 231 (the latter in the small town of Hocutts Crossroads). NC 96 enters eastern Wake County and soon enters Zebulon. The highway crosses over NC 97 in Zebulon's downtown district and crosses over US 64\\\\US 264 on the other side of town. NC 96 then cuts a northwesterly path through the northeastern part of the county, crossing over US 401 near Rolesville and NC 98 near Wake Forest. NC 96 enters the southwestern side of Franklin County, soon entering Youngsville. In Youngsville, NC 96 takes a sharp western turn to join US 1 Alternate for a brief concurrency. Outside of town, NC 96 splits off from US 1 Alternate and crosses over the main US 1 highway before winding a mostly northwestern path through rural Franklin County and Granville County farmland. Shortly after entering Granville County, NC 96 takes a sharp turn northward at a four-way intersection near Brassfield and heads north to an intersection with NC 56 in Wilton. NC 96 continues northward from here until its intersection with Interstate 85 herald's the highway's arrival in Oxford. In Oxford, NC 96 joins US 15 to go through Oxford's downtown district before both highways join Business Route US 158 to head northward out of town. NC 96 and Business 158 split off from US 15 to head westward for about a mile before NC 96 splits off northward, where the highway crosses over mainline US 158 before beginning the rest of its almost entirely solo journey through rural northwestern Granville County. NC 96 passes through the tiny unincorporated community of Oak Hill before joining NC 49 less than a mile away from the North Carolina/Virginia border. Together, the two highways continue into Virgilina, where they continue on as Virginia State Route 96 and Virginia State Route 49 respectively. SR 96 ends at US 501 just south of Cluster Springs, Virginia shortly afterwards. History The current NC 96 was established in 1940 as a renumbering of NC 562; it ran from NC 56, in Wilton, to Virgilina, Virginia. In 1952, NC 96 was extended south as a new primary routing to Youngsville, replaced NC 98 and NC 264 to Zebulon, new primary routing to Selma, concurrency with US 301 to Four Oaks, and finally new primary routing to end at NC 55\\\\. Around 1960, NC 96 was adjusted in the Four Oaks area to accommodate I-95; it was placed on concurrency briefly with US 701, leaving behind part of US 301 and Boyette Road (SR-1182). The first NC 96 existed from 1930-1940; it originally traversed from NC 90, near Taylorsville, south to NC 17, in Hickory. In 1934, it was extended further south to NC 73, in Propst Crossroads, replacing part of NC 17\\\\. Between 1931-1936, NC 96 was rerouted at the Catawba River onto a new crossing at Shiloh Church Road. In 1940, the entire route was renumbered to NC 127\\\\. =North Carolina Highway 562= North Carolina Highway 562 (NC 562) was established as a new primary routing from NC 56, in Wilton, to Virgilina, at the Virginia state line. In 1940, NC 562 was renumbered in favor of NC 96 to match Virginia (which renumbered).

After refitting the vessel, the Union used it as a hospital ship during the American Civil War. Red Rover became the U.S. Navy's first hospital ship, serving the Mississippi Squadron until the end of the American Civil War. Her medical complement included nurses from the Catholic order Sisters of the Holy Cross, the first female nurses to serve on board a Navy ship. In addition to caring for and transporting sick and wounded men, she provided medical supplies to Navy ships along the Western Rivers. Service under the Confederacy Red Rover was a side-wheel steamer built in 1859 at Cape Girardeau, Missouri. The Confederacy purchased her on 7 November 1861, and initially put her to use as a barracks ship for the floating battery at New Orleans, Louisiana. Serving from 15 March 1862, at Island No. 10, near New Madrid, Missouri, she was holed by Union fire during a bombardment of that island sometime before 25 March, leading the Confederates to abandon her as a barracks ship. Captured by the Union Army When the island fell to Union forces on 7 April, the Union gunboat captured Red Rover. The Union forces repaired her, fitting her out as a summer hospital ship for the Army's Western Flotilla. Her role was to augment the limited Union medical facilities, to minimize the hazards to sick and wounded in fighting ships, and to facilitate delivery of medical supplies to and evacuation of personnel from forward areas. Civil War care of the sick and wounded Hospital ward on Red Rover At the time of Red Rovers commissioning as a hospital ship, the Union was already using steamers such as the City of Memphis as medical transports to carry casualties upriver. However, these transports lacked necessary sanitary accommodations and medical staff, and thus were unable to prevent the spread of disease. Barges, housed over or covered with canvas, were ordered for the care of contagious diseases, primarily smallpox, and were moored in shady spots along the river. Rapid mobilization at the start of the Civil War had vitiated efforts to prevent the outbreak and epidemic communication of disease on both sides of the conflict. Vaccination was slow; sanitation and hygiene were generally poor. Overworked military medical personnel were assisted by voluntary societies coordinated by the U.S. Sanitary Commission founded in June 1861. But by 1865, typhoid fever, typhus, dysentery, diarrhea, cholera, smallpox, measles, and malaria would claim more lives than gunshot. Conversion to hospital ship Red Rover Red Rover, serving first with the Union Army, then with the Union Navy, drew on both military and voluntary medical personnel. Her conversion to a hospital boat, begun at St. Louis, Missouri, and completed at Cairo, Illinois, was undertaken by the Western Sanitary Commission with both sanitation and comfort in mind. A separate operating room was installed and equipped. A galley was put below, providing separate kitchen facilities for the patients. The cabin aft was opened for better air circulation. A steam boiler was added for laundry purposes. An elevator, numerous bathrooms, nine water closets, and gauze window blinds \\" ... to keep cinders and smoke from annoying the sick\\" were also included in the work. Civil War service =Mound City hospital service= On 10 June 1862, Red Rover was ready for service. Her commanding officer was Captain McDaniel of the Army's Gunboat Service. Assistant Surgeon George H. Bixby became Surgeon in Charge. On 11 June, Red Rover received her first patient, a cholera victim and American Union seaman from the gunboat USS Benton named David Sans who became the first patient taken aboard the first hospital ship in American history. By the 14th, she had 55 patients. On the 17th, Mound City exploded during an engagement with Confederate batteries at St. Charles, Arkansas. Casualties amounted to 135 out of a complement of 175. Red Rover, dispatched to assist in the emergency, took on board extreme burn and wound cases at Memphis, Tennessee, and transported them to less crowded hospitals in Illinois. =Vicksburg, Mississippi, hospital service= From Mound City, Illinois, the hospital ship moved down-stream again and joined the Western Flotilla above Vicksburg, Mississippi. Through the summer, she treated the flotilla's sick and wounded while the Ram Fleet engaged at Vicksburg and along the Mississippi River to Helena, Arkansas. While off Helena, Red Rover caught fire, but ‚Äî with assistance from the gunboat ‚Äî she extinguished the blaze and continued her work. =Transferred to the Union Navy's Mississippi operating area= In September 1862, Red Rover ‚Äî still legally under the jurisdiction of an Illinois prize court ‚Äî was sent to Cairo, Illinois, to be winterized. The Navy purchased her on the 30th. The next day, the Union transferred the vessels of the Western Flotilla, with their officers and men, to the Navy Department to serve as the Mississippi Squadron under acting Rear Adm. David Dixon Porter. The Navy Medical Department of Western Waters was organized at the same time under Fleet Surg. Edward Gilchrist. In December Red Rover, used during the fall to alleviate crowded medical facilities ashore, was ready for service on the river. On the 26th, she was commissioned under the command of Acting Master William R. Wells, USN. Her complement was 47, while her medical department, remaining under Assistant Surgeon Bixby, was initially about 30. Of that number, three were Sisters of the Order of the Holy Cross, later joined by a fourth member of their order and assisted by lay nurses' aides. These women were the forerunners of the U.S. Navy Nurse Corps. The Western Sanitation Commission, which also donated over $3,000 worth of equipment to the ship, coordinated the work of these and other volunteers. Five of the women who served as nurses on the ship with the Sisters were five former slaves, including Ann Bradford Stokes, who had volunteered their service to the Navy. In December 1862, Fleet Surg. Ninian A. Pinckney relieved Fleet Surg. Gilchrist. Pinckney imposed such strict standards on the department's day-to-day activities and ran them so well run from his headquarters in Red Rover that by 1865, he was able to claim > there is less ... sickness in the Fleet than in the healthiest portion of > the globe. =Supporting the White River expedition= On the 29th, Red Rover headed downstream. During January 1863, she served with the expedition up the White River. While the expedition took the Post of Arkansas (Fort Hindman), she remained at the mouth of the river to receive the wounded. On her departure, she was fired on and two shots penetrated into the hospital area, but caused no casualties. From February to the fall of Vicksburg early in July, she cared for the sick and wounded of that campaign and supplemented her medical support of Union forces by provisioning other ships of the Mississippi Squadron with ice and fresh meat. She also provided burial details and sent medical personnel ashore when and where needed. Red Rover continued her service along the river, taking on sick and wounded and delivering medicine and supplies until the fall of 1864. In October of that year, she began her last supply run. After delivering medical stores to ships at Helena and on the White, Red, and Yazoo Rivers, she transferred patients to Hospital Pinckney at Memphis, Tennessee and headed north. Post-war decommissioning Arriving at Mound City, Illinois on 11 December, she remained there, caring for Navy patients, until she was decommissioned on 17 November 1865. Having admitted over 2,400 patients during her career, she transferred her last 11 to on that date. On 29 November, she was sold at public auction to A. M. Carpenter. Legacy When accessioned recruits to the United States Navy arrive at Recruit Training Center, Great Lakes, Illinois, the first Branch Medical Clinic they visit is named BMC Red Rover. It is there that recruits get their first inoculations, immunizations, optometry screenings, female examinations, and dental screenings.

Speed limit sign in Malaysia for expressways only although other signage is adopted for 80 or 90km/h areas Had Laju Kebangsaan (National Speed Limits) is a set of speed limits applicable on Malaysian expressways, federal roads, state roads and municipal roads. The National Speed Limits was enforced on 1 February 1989 following the National Speed Limit Orders 1989 (Perintah Had Laju Kebangsaan 1989). Like any other countries in the world, failing to obey the speed limit on Malaysian roads and expressways is an offence as subject to Malaysian Road Safety Act 1987, which can be fined up to RM300, depending on the difference between the speed limit and the driven speed.  Default speed limitsMalaysian Parliamentary Debates (House of Representatives) - 20 June 1991  * Expressways: 110 km/h (68 mph) by default, but may be reduced to 80 or 90 km/h (50-56 mph) at dangerous mountainous stretches, crosswind areas and urban areas with high traffic capacity. * Federal roads: 90 km/h (56 mph) by default (reduced to 80 km/h during festive seasons),Road Transport Act 1987 - National Speed Limit (Temporary Cessation) 2006 60 km/h (37 mph) in town area. * State roads: 90 km/h (56 mph) by default (reduced to 80 km/h during festive seasons), 60 km/h (37 mph) in town area.  Speed limits for heavy vehicles  Special speed limits are applied to heavy vehicles, and all heavy vehicles have speed limit stickers describing the allowed speed limits. However, many heavy vehicles especially express buses do not obey these speed limits. The speed limits for heavy vehicles are as follows:- * Expressways: 80‚Äì90 km/h (50-56 mph) * Federal and state roads: 70‚Äì80 km/h (43-50 mph) by default, 60 km/h (37 mph) in urban areas  Other speed limits  For school areas, the speed limit of 35 km/h (22 mph) is applicable during rush hours. Besides, cars with trailers apply the same speed limit as heavier vehicles (80 km/h (50 mph) on expressways and 80 km/h (50 mph) on other roads). Starting from the 2006 Hari Raya Aidilfitri, the Malaysian Police began enforcing lower speed limits during festive seasons for all federal and state roads, from the default 90 km/h (56 mph) down to 80 km/h (50 mph).  Speed penalties  Speeding over the enforced speed limits can be fined up to RM300 and offenders may also receive demerit points as subject to KEJARA System by Malaysian Road Transport Department. The speed penalties are given according to the difference of the driven speed and the enforced speed limit as follows:- # 1 ~ 25 km/h: RM80 (6 demerit points) # 26 ~ 40 km/h: RM150 (8 demerit points) # Over 40 km/h: RM300 (10 demerit points)  Speed limit issues  = Higher speed limit on expressways (130 km/h) = In 1991, a proposal to increase the speed limit on Malaysian expressways to 140 km/h (87 mph) was made but was finally rejected in 2005 by Minister of Works, Datuk Seri S. Samy Vellu, stating that most drivers often drive 10 to 30 km/h faster than the stated speed limit on the expressways. Over the years, several attempts to set higher speed limit for the expressways were being made by certain quarter of the public. However, each attempt was successfully turn-down citing safety as one of the main reason for the rejection. On the basis of fatality per 100 km length of road, Malaysian expressways recorded more than three times higher number of fatality when compared to that of the federal roads. = Lower speed limit during festive seasons (80 km/h) = Starting from the 2006 Hari Raya Aidilfitri festive season, the Malaysian police enforced lower speed limits on federal and state roads during festive seasons, from the default 90 km/h (56 mph) to 80 km/h (50 mph) as a preventive measures to reduce accidents during festive seasons. However, many road users complain about the viability of the lower speed limit because the accident rate during festive seasons continue to rise even with lower speed limits, as the lower speed limit doesn't seem to bring any significant effects of reducing the accident rate; therefore, lower speed limit alone is not the effective deterrent of fatal accidents during festive seasons.

It is thought that a discarded cigarette butt accidentally ignited the gasoline on the field. Flames quickly spread to the storage area, resulting in a raging fire that engulfed the wooden framework of the stadium. No one died in the blaze; however 106 to 222 were reported injured when the grandstand area collapsed.Mack Park/Fairview Homes. Retrieved 2010-03-17.

Formerly the Galeville Military Airport, it was decommissioned in 1994 and turned over to the United States Fish and Wildlife Service in 1999. It serves as a waypoint for grassland-dependent migratory birds. History The refuge first became federal property in the early 1940s, when the Army bought what was then swampland and filled it in with soil from the nearby flood plains to build Galeville Army Air Field to train pilots as a result of World War II. It stopped using the field years after the war, in the early 1970s and in later years it would be used by the nearby United States Military Academy. FBI agents also trained there.Rothbaum, Rebecca; June 20, 2002; \\"Wildlife lives on in Shawangunk Grasslands \\"; Poughkeepsie Journal; retrieved July 18, 2007. as did the U.S. Marshals Service.CCP, 3-6. \\"The recent past of the refuge has included a history as a farm field, use as an airport, and a role as a training location for U. S. Marshals.\\" In 1994 the Department of Defense decided it no longer needed the property. Five years later, it was conveyed to the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), which had wanted to protect the land as one of the state's top ten areas for grassland-dependent migratory birds. It is today managed as a subunit of the Wallkill River National Wildlife Refuge, to the south. Recently the FWS has begun to mow and deshrub the that make up the refuge's core grasslands. This prevents the grasslands from returning to wooded swamp. Shawangunk Grasslands NWR seen from , looking S-E. Geography The Shawangunk Grasslands National Wildlife Refuge is situated in the central portion of the town of Shawangunk, closer to the hamlet of Wallkill than Walker Valley. It is a roughly rectangular parcel that sits slightly west of the Wallkill River, just north of the crest of the divide between it and its tributary Shawangunk Kill, itself a relatively unspoiled stream and important habitat the FWS has been working to protect.Shawangunk Kill, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, retrieved from training.fws.gov, July 21, 2007. \\"The Shawangunk Kill is a relatively undisturbed Hudson River tributary. Its low nutrient levels, cool water, and lack of a major water control structure allow the lower Shawangunk Kill to support a regionally rare biological community.\\" The site is roughly bounded by Hoagerburgh Road (Ulster County 18) on the west, Albany Post Road (Ulster County 9) on the east, Long Lane (Ulster County 18A) on the north and Bates Lane to the south. Public access is provided near the southwest corner, off Hoagerburgh. The central area of the property, the former airport, is bounded on all sides by woodland and shrubland (except for a small corridor around the main public access road) which makes up 165 acres (66 ha) of the total. The 400 acres (160 ha) that account for the core grassland also boast the former airport's 3,500-foot‚Äìlong (1,067 m) runways and equivalent taxiways, taking up about 30 acres (12 ha) along the southern and western bounds of the grasslands. From this open space, it is possible to see the Shawangunk Ridge to the west. Geology Like much of the Hudson Valley, the Shawangunk Grasslands show the signs of glaciation during the last Ice Age, even though they were created much more recently through human action. The topsoil in the grasslands contains a high level of clay, which forms a barrier to most water filtering downward. Throughout the entire refuge, the water table is at least 3 feet (1 m) below the surface. Frequent freezing and melting during the winter results in pit-and-hummock topography throughout much of the refuge. Ecology and biology The grasslands created by the airport's construction are one of only two such locations in the region that can support the 12 species of birds dependent on them. Some of them, according to the FWS, need at least , per nesting pair. 190 bird species, 58 of which breed there, have been documented in the refuge.CCP, 3-15. \\"More than 141 species of birds, including 58 breeding species, have been documented.\\" =Fauna= The Shawangunk Grasslands are especially important to these grassland-dependent species: * Bobolink * Eastern meadowlark * Grasshopper sparrow * Horned lark * Northern harrier * Savannah sparrow * Short-eared owl * Upland sandpiper *Henslow‚Äôs sparrow In addition several hawk and falcon species (not grassland-dependent) have been seen at the site,CCP, 3-17. and black-billed cuckoo and wood thrush have been nesting in the woodland portions. , 4-19; U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, retrieved July 17, 2007. \\"136 acres of the refuge are composed of woodland or shrubland in transition to woodland, which cannot be converted effectively to grassland habitat. Black-billed cuckoo and wood thrush are declining species that nest in these small woodland patches.\\" Non-bird species that have settled into the habitat include several turtle species, small-mouthed bass and sunfish in the one small pond on the siteCCP, 3-14. and white-tailed deer in the woodlands. The FWS has also been alerted to the possibility that Indiana bats, a federal endangered species, may be exploiting opportunities provided by the refuge. A hibernaculum of 30,000 bats has been reported to the northeast, and there is evidence that some have roosted closer to the refuge. The agency has been monitoring the refuge to see if any Indiana bats have begun to use dead trees as roosting sites or begin to forage on the site.CCP, 3-11, 3-12. \\"However, in August 2005 we learned from our Ecological Service‚Äôs New York Field Office that a hibernaculum of 30,000 Indiana bats (Myotis sodalis), a Federal endangered species, lies in Ulster County 18 miles to the northeast of the refuge. In addition, there is documented summer roosting by these bats nine miles to the north and south of the refuge. This new information indicates that the refuge could provide potential roosting and foraging habitat for these bats since they appear to be in the vicinity ... We will continue to work with our New York Field Office to obtain the latest information on where bats are located, and to assess the implications to our refuge management.\\" The FWS has been mowing a year to maintain the grassland since 2002 Shawangunk Grasslands in summer =Flora= While the refuge is protected primarily for the bird life, several rare or uncommon plant species have also been found in the grasslands, where Kentucky bluegrass is the dominant speciesCCP, 4-14. \\"Approximately 400 acres of the refuge is composed of grassland dominated by Kentucky bluegrass.\\" Frank's sedge, small-flowered agrimony, purple milkweed, small white aster, Bush's sedge, coontail and watermeal.CCP, 3-12. \\"Stevens documented one of the most noteworthy, Frank's sedge (Carex frankii), which is ranked endangered by the NYSDEC and S1 by the New York Natural Heritage Program (NYNHP) (Stevens 1992). Stevens also documented small-flowered agrimony (Agrimonia parviflora), purple milkweed (Asclepias purpurascens), small white aster (Aster vimineus), Bush's sedge (Carex bushii), coontail (Ceratophyllum echinatum), and watermeal (Wolffia brazilinsis). A few tree species, such as white ash, American elm, eastern red cedar, and pin oak, also flourish in those sections. The woodlands on the periphery are dominated by several oak species, red maple, sugar maple, shagbark hickory and tulip trees. The grasslands have also been inviting for several invasive species, most notably purple loosestrife, mugwort and gray dogwood. FWS's mowing and other grassland-preservation efforts are aimed at removing or controlling those species. Management In 2002, the Fish and Wildlife Service finished its first final Comprehensive Conservation Plan for the Shawangunk Grasslands. Its primary goal in managing the area is to preserve and, where possible, extend the existing grassland.CCP, 4-10. \\"Our goal will be to create a diverse mosaic of grassland habitat structure capable of sustaining the full complement of grassland-dependent birds during all seasons. We will manage the various grassland structural types (short, medium, tall) as a shifting mosaic over time. We will also increase the available grasslands by up to 30 acres through the restoration of the asphalt and concrete runways and taxiways.\\" By mowing, deshrubbing and continuing to work with local farmers who are allowed to graze animals on the land and hay it under special use permits, it hopes to maintain a diverse enough selection of grasses for all species.CCP, 4-10 through 4-15. Similarly, one mature tree per 10 acres (4 ha) of grassland will be maintained for predatory bird species.CCP, 4-16. \\"In the mosaic of grasslands, maintain scattered mature trees (1 tree /10 ac) for wintering raptor hunting and roosting perches.\\" Abandoned runway, already slowly returning to grassland. Yellow cross indicates to aircraft that the airport is officially closed. In the longer term, FWS plans to create up to 30 acres (12 ha) of additional grassland by removing the runway pavement and restoring the original cover. An 8-foot (2 m) wide strip of concrete would be left for use as a public trail. While grasses are already beginning to grow through cracks in the runways, the agency would prefer not to wait as aircraft continue to make illegal landings at the refuge, disturbing the birds, despite markings on the runways themselves and on aviation charts of the area indicating that the facility is closed. It has not yet determined how this will be done in the most environmentally sensitive fashion.CCP, 4-17 and 4-18. \\"Altering the pavement is also an essential step to eliminating illegal landings and low-altitude overflights by small airplanes, which are highly disturbing to breeding birds. The current sectional aeronautical chart for the area indicates that the runways on the refuge are closed, and markings on the runways communicate this closure to pilots flying overhead ... We have not fully developed our restoration plan as we continue to explore options for recycling the asphalt and concrete. Similarly, it hopes to restore the original stream pattern through the property by removing the culverts and other reroutings made during construction of the airfield.CCP, 4-20, 4-21. Some of the woodlands at the edge of the refuge. Since the woodlands surrounding the grasslands cannot be converted into grasslands, FWS will maintain them as such. The 26 acres (10 ha) of grass and shrublands within the woods, which also have become important habitat, will be allowed to return to woodland. FWS has also committed itself to exploring a number of ways to control the invasive plant species in the refuge, such as herbicides, releasing beetle and weevil species that feed on the invaders and annual prescribed burns in addition to the methods it already employs. Its goal is to reduce their presence to less than 10% of the refuge within 10 years. Some of its employees have expressed concerns about whether any pollutants might be left over from previous military use of the site, particularly around a communications center demolished in 1973. While the agency does not presently believe there is any cause for concern, it will be monitoring the situation and plans an environmental assessment. =Partner organizations= The FWS has credited other organizations, public and private, with helping it to fulfill its goals for the refuge. The former is represented by its state-level counterpart, the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (NYSDEC), which has shared data with it, participated in the planning process and works with local communities to protect wildlife habitat. Among the latter, the local and state Audubon Society chapters advocated strongly for the area's protection, since the society had declared the airport site an Important Bird Area in 1998.CCP, 3-9, 10.. Other organizations have played supporting roles by helping to perform management tasks and raising awareness. There is a Friends of Shawangunk Grasslands National Wildlife Refuge, which was formed in 2017. This refuge is staffed by two FWS volunteers. The existing public access point and parking lot, which FWS would like to expand. Recreation While the refuge is easily accessible to the public, activities within it are strictly limited to those that are wildlife- dependent: walking, nature photography, birdwatching and, in winter, snowshoeing and cross-country skiing. Jogging is not allowed, nor is any activity that would bring other animals (such as dogs or horses) or motorized vehicles into the area, since that would likely disturb the nesting birds.CCP, 4-5. \\"We will continue to prohibit the walking of pets, jogging, bicycling, riding horses, driving all-terrain vehicles, model airplane flying and competitions, and the touching down, taking off, or acrobatic flying of aircraft on the refuge ... We have observed the activity disturbing wildlife to a greater degree than impacts generated from visitors who's purpose is to watch or photograph wildlife\\" All visitors must remain on the paved roads, parking areas, trails or the observation platform. The refuge is open sunrise to sunset year-round.CCP, 4-9. \\"We will open the refuge for public use from 1 hour before official sunrise to 1 hour after official sunset, seven days a week, to ensure visitor safety and protect refuge resources.\\" Among the motorized vehicles banned from the refuge as are radio-controlled aircraft and drones. Model airplane enthusiasts, who took to the site and its abandoned runways before it was transferred to FWS, had hoped to continue to be allowed to do so under its management. Many of them wrote in with public comments favoring their hobby, saying wild birds and model airplanes could indeed coexist as they had for 30 years of model aviation at the former airport. , retrieved July 21, 2007. While eventually 90% of the comments that addressed it supported model airplaning, FWS did not believe that it was compatible with the goal of preserving a safe habitat for the birds, and officially banned it. Academy of Model Aeronautics president Carl Maroney charged that the agency had made up its mind before soliciting public input. Three years later, the controversy had still not faded as Eastern U.S. Free Flight Conference president Robert Langelius told Congress that the USFWS had been \\"completely intransigent\\" and that many enthusiasts had given up the sport for lack of available space. FWS was also criticized by animal rights groups for its decision to allow bowhunting of deer on the refuge during the state season in the fall, the only hunting it decided was compatible with the refuge's mission. Most bowhunters, it responded, will be using tree stands on the perimeter and will only need to enter the site briefly to retrieve any kills., retrieved July 23, 2009. It will be administered under a special fee permit system. Catch-and-Release Fishing will also be permitted in the refuge's pond, but it will not be stockedCCP, 4-6. although it may be expanded if it proves to be a popular enough activity.CCP, 4-29 Sign for town park Currently, the agency estimates the refuge receives about 20,000 visitors a year, contributing $257,840 to the local economy. The FWS also makes annual revenue sharing payments to the town at various amounts between $2‚Äì3,000 a year. Most visitors have been birdwatchers, many drawn by the chance to watch the short- eared owl, one of the few owls that hunt in daylight. Ultimately the agency hopes to provide a more complete trail system, possibly connecting to an adjacent town park and allowing better wildlife viewing. It would like to expand the current parking area and provide an interior contact point for the public, with one employee at the refuge at all times.CCP, maps 4-1 and 4-2, pages 4-11, 12.

It airs a contemporary hit radio (CHR/Top 40) radio format and is owned and operated by iHeartMedia, Inc. The station's studios and offices are located on Gandy Boulevard in South Tampa. Local DJs are heard on weekdays, with syndicated shows, including American Top 40 with Ryan Seacrest, the iHeartRadio Countdown, the Remix Top 30 with Hollywood Hamilton and On The Move with Enrique Santos, heard on weekends. WFLZ has an effective radiated power (ERP) of 100,000 watts, the maximum for non-grandfathered FM stations. The transmitter is off Rhodine Road in Riverview, Florida, amid other towers for Tampa-area TV and FM stations. WFLZ-FM broadcasts in the HD Radio format; the HD2 subchannel carries Pride Radio, an iHeart service for LGBTQ listeners, while the HD-3 subchannel carries Evolution, iHeartMedia's dance music/EDM service. History =Early Years= In 1948, the station signed on as WFLA- FM, one of Tampa Bay's and Florida's earliest FM stations.Broadcasting Yearbook 1950 page 116 (An early FM station at 105.9 in Tampa that is today 100.7 WMTX went on the air in 1947.) WFLA-FM mostly simulcast the programming from AM sister station WFLA. WFLA-AM-FM were affiliates of the NBC Red Network, carrying its dramas, comedies, news and sports. The stations were owned by the Tribune Company, which also owned the daily newspaper, The Tampa Tribune. In 1955, a TV station was added, WFLA-TV, which carried NBC television programming, since the radio stations were NBC affiliates. In the 1960s, WFLA-FM ended the simulcast with the AM, switching to beautiful music. It played quarter hour sweeps of instrumental cover versions of popular songs, Broadway and Hollywood show tunes. In 1966, the Tribune and its three stations were sold to Richmond Newspapers, which became Media General in 1969. =Country, AC and Oldies= In 1981, it changed to a country music format, as WOJC, \\"Orange Country 93\\". However, it was unable to compete against country powerhouses at the time, WSUN and WQYK-FM. In 1984, it changed again to adult contemporary music, bringing back the WFLA-FM call sign and using the name \\"93 FLA\\". While it was a little more successful, it still faced competition from WNLT and WIQI. It was then reformatted into WPDS (\\"Paradise 93\\") in 1986, playing soft adult contemporary music. WFLA-AM and WPDS were purchased by Jacor Broadcasting in 1988.Broadcasting Yearbook 1989 page B-70 The FM station changed its call letters to WFLZ and soon flipped to 1960s and 70s oldies, as \\"Z93\\". The oldies format lasted only a year. The Tampa Bay radio landscape change was influenced by a St. Petersburg Times \\"Favorite DJ\\" contest. A disc jockey on a small AM station, WHBO, won. Most radio insiders thought one of the DJs from popular Top 40 station WRBQ, known as \\"Q105\\", would gather the most votes. The executives at Jacor saw that WRBQ, which, up to that point, had been the dominant FM Top 40 leader in Tampa for about 15 years, might be vulnerable from another full-power FM station playing contemporary hits. =The Power Pig= During a week of stunting in September 1989, including an hour of an urban contemporary micro-format, Z93 DJs demanded that Q105 pay them up to $4 million if they wanted to remain the only Top 40 station in the Tampa Bay market. Q105 ignored the demands of Z93, as well as daily newspaper and TV news coverage that the ransom request was receiving. At 8:15 a.m. on September 25, Z93 DJs Jack Harris and Dr. Don Carpenter called Q105's owner, Gary Edens, at a private hotel room on the West Coast (5:15 a.m. Gary's time), waking him up to offer him one last chance to pay the $4 million ransom to keep Z93 from switching to Top 40. Live on 93.3 then, Gary responded: \\"Come on guys! Looking forward to it. Let's go! Have a happy day!\\" At that point after Z-93's last moments containing clips of \\"The Last Time\\", \\"Hello, Goodbye\\", \\"Too Late to Turn Back Now\\", and Na Na Hey Hey Kiss Him Goodbye along with various sound effects such as a radio buzz and pigs squealing, Power 93, The Power Pig was launched, with \\"Cold Hearted\\" by Paula Abdul being the first song played.WFLZ Becomes The Power Pig from Format Change Archive September 25, 2014 The station aggressively targeted Q105 with promotions such as handing out \\"Screw The Q\\" T-shirts at various on the street events. Within 71 days of the format flip, \\"The Power Pig\\" had overtaken \\"Q105\\" in the Tampa market ratings, and would eventually lead to WRBQ flipping to country in June 1993. =93-3 FLZ= In March 1995, The Power Pig dropped its aggressive image and re-branded as \\"93-3 FLZ\\", using the slogan \\"The New Music Revolution\\". WFLZ disc jockey Bubba the Love Sponge had his show also airing for a couple of hours a day on a station in Jacksonville. For a few months, WFLZ was simulcast on co-owned KHTS-FM in San Diego while a new CHR format was created for that market. In 1998, Jacor Broadcasting was acquired by Clear Channel Communications. That put WFLZ under the same roof as its former competitor, WRBQ, until that station was sold off to Infinity Broadcasting in 1999. This created an awkward situation, as some of the staff of WRBQ, who were subject to personal attacks from WFLZ, had moved to higher positions in Clear Channel that oversaw their old rivals at WFLZ. In 2000, the station underwent a slight re-imaging, adopting a new logo and the slogan \\"The #1 Hit Music Channel.\\" Longtime morning man and operations manager BJ Harris left WFLZ for a station in Cincinnati to do afternoons and PD work. WFLZ was the flagship station for the MJ Morning Show hosted by Todd Schnitt, which was also played on other Clear Channel FM stations in Florida and Missouri. In 2004, it earned the \\"CHR Station of the Year\\" and \\"CHR Personality of the Year\\" (for Kane) awards in the Radio Music Awards. In 2011, it was named FMQB \\"CHR Station of the Year\\". On January 19, 2012, Clear Channel announced that after 18 years, the MJ Morning Show would be discontinued. The final broadcast was on February 17, 2012. Clear Channel announced that the Kane Show would take over the morning spot.\\"MJ Calls It A Day At WFLZ\\" from All Access (January 19, 2012). On April 4, 2014, radio DJs Jeff Daly and Josh Foreman, also known as Ratboy and Staypuff, announced they would be moving to Philadelphia to host an afternoon- drive slot from 3 to 7 pm at co-owned Top 40 station WIOQ. They thanked fans for listening for many years. Radio DJ Nathan \\"Brody\\" Halegua took over the slot from 7 pm to midnight on April 7. On October 30, 2015, at 3:00 p.m., WFLZ temporarily changed its name to \\"Taylor 93.3\\" to honor Taylor Swift.

At the start, it was launched as an extension of WFLZ's popular weekend mix show The House Party. In 2015 the subchannel switched to the \\"Evolution\\" EDM brand, but customized for Tampa-area listeners, billed as \\"Evolution 93.3 Tampa Bay.\\" The subchannel also served as a reporter to Billboard's Dance/Mix Show Airplay Chart, in part due to having more of a local content apart from the national \\"Evolution\\" network. On June 26, 2019, WFLZ-FM-HD2 flipped to iHeart's \\"Pride Radio\\" format targeting the LGBTQ community while Evolution moved to a newly created HD3 subchannel.iHeartMedia Expands Pride Radio to 12 Additional Markets References External links  *The Power Pig WFLZ Tribute site. 200+ audio clips, stories, pictures and more.

A shape-up, also called a line-up or an edge-up, is a hairstyle that involves cutting along the natural hairline to straighten it. Shape-ups or edge-ups are the fundamental outline for haircuts today . Edge-ups are typically found among men and short- haired women. The haircut grew in popularity during the 1980s, typically among those who have Afro-textured hair, and became the precursor to other stylish haircuts, such as the high-top fade, low fade, and designs such as crescent moon parts, side parts, and waves in hair. The shape-up is influenced by hip- hop and pop culture and is common among entertainers and basketball players.  History fresh line up with waves Matt Dumba with a buzz cut and line up During the 1970s and the era of disco, most African-Americans sported an afro to reflect their cultural identity and their pride in their hair. In the 1980s, feeling that the afro looked dated, people began to cut their afros off in search of something more clean and neat. The shape-up was first introduced in the mid- or late 1980s. Influential hip-hop artists such as Eric B, Rakim, and Big Daddy Kane popularized the high-top fade with the shape-up. With the arrival of the 1990s and the decline of the high-top fade, the demand for the shape-up remained. The low-top fade was the next adaptation to the shape-up's arsenal. This ushered in a new wave of options on how to be laced with an edge-up, including Caesar cuts with the grain and against the grain. = Equipment = hair clippers The shape-up is usually produced by an electric razor blade, though some barbers prefer to use a single hand razor blade for more precision. The electric razor is traced along the natural hairline to create a neat trim. The outcome is a clean and professional stylish look. The form of the shape-up could be rounded, but on most customers it is sleeker and sharper. Popularity and influence As the shape-up became more popular, so did the culture surrounding it. Men's visits to the barbershop became the venue for conversations about politics, sports, movies and gossip. Movies and television shows depict this practice, such as rapper Ice Cube's production of the movie \\"Barbershop\\", a story of barbers and their shape-up clients.

It supplies the grey and white posterior columns of the spinal cord. Structure It passes posteriorly to descend the medulla passing in front of the posterior roots of the spinal nerves. Along its course it is reinforced by a succession of segmental or radiculopial branches, which enter the vertebral canal through the intervertebral foramina, forming a plexus called the vasocorona with the anterior vertebral arteries. Below the medulla spinalis and upper cervical spine, the posterior spinal arteries are rather discontinuous; unlike the anterior spinal artery, which can be traced as a distinct channel throughout its course, the posterior spinal arteries are seen as somewhat larger longitudinal channels of an extensive pial arterial meshwork. At the level of the conus medullaris, the posterior spinals are more frequently seen as distinct arteries, communicating with the anterior spinal artery to form a characteristic \\"basket\\" which angiographically defines the caudal extent of the spinal cord and its transition to the cauda equina. Branches from the posterior spinal arteries form a free anastomosis around the posterior roots of the spinal nerves, and communicate, by means of very tortuous transverse branches, with the vessels of the opposite side. Close to its origin each posterior spinal artery gives off an ascending branch, which ends ipsilaterally near the fourth ventricle. The posterior spinal artery can often originate from the posterior inferior cerebellar artery, rather than the vertebral.  Functions  Most cranially, the posterior spinal artery supplies the dorsal column of the closed medulla containing fasiculus gracilis, gracile nucleus, fasciculus cuneatus, and cuneate nucleus. At the spinal cord level, the posterior spinal artery supplies the dorsal and lateral column as well as the peripheral part of the anterior and central column.  Clinical significance  Disruption of blood supply to this particular artery in the medulla would result in a number of sensory deficits. If occlusion occurs above the level of sensory decussation, it would affect the proprioception, vibration, and two-point discrimination of the contralateral side of the body. When occurs below the level of sensory decussation, however, it would cause the effect on the ipsilateral side instead. Particularly at the upper cervical spinal cord where the posterior spinal artery supplies some parts of the ventral column, lesion might extend to the anterolateral system and triggers the loss of pain and temperature sensation on the contralateral side of the body.

The seat of the municipality is in Kassandreia.Kallikratis law Greece Ministry of Interior Municipality The municipality Kassandra was formed at the 2011 local government reform by the merger of the following 2 former municipalities, that became municipal units (communities in brackets): *Kassandra (Afytos, Fourka, Kalandra, Kallithea, Kassandreia, Kassandrino, Kryopigi, Nea Fokaia) *Pallini (Agia Paraskevi, Chaniotis, Nea Skioni, Paliouri, Pefkochori, Polychrono) The municipality has an area of 334.280 km2, the municipal unit 206.097 km2. History Headland of Pallene in ancient Chalcidice Pallene () is the ancient name of the westernmost of the three headlands of Chalcidice, which run out into the Aegean Sea. It is said to have anciently borne the name of Phlegra ()Herodotus. Histories, vii. 123. and to have witnessed the conflict between the gods and the earthborn Gigantes.Pind. Nem. i. 100, Isthm. vi. 48; Apollod. i. 6. ¬ß 1; Lycophron 1408; Strabo vii. p. 330; Steph. B. s. v. The modern name of the peninsula is Kassandra, which, besides affording excellent winter pasture for cattle and sheep, also produces an abundance of grain of superior quality, as well as wool, honey, and wax, besides raising silkworms.William Martin Leake, Northern Greece, vol. iii. p. 163. In antiquity, Pallene was the site of numerous towns: Sane, Mende, Scione, Therambos, Aege, Neapolis, Aphytis, which were either wholly or partly colonies from Eretria. Strabo( VII.27 Fragments ) mentions the following five cities of Pallene in the 1st century BC (Cassandreia, Aphytis, Mende, Scione and Sane). After the founding of the Roman colony of Cassandreia (43 BC), the entire peninsula of Pallene was included in the colony territory. D. C. Samsaris, The Roman Colony of Cassandreia in Macedonia (Colonia Iulia Augusta Cassandrensis) (in Greek), Dodona 16(1), 1987, p. 353-362 In Late Antiquity, the center of the peninsula was the city of Cassandreia, located at the site of ancient Potidaia. A polis and a bishopric, Cassandreia was destroyed by the Huns in 539 or 540 AD. After this, Emperor Justinian I built a wall at the entrance of the peninsula, but it is not until the 10th century that a sizeable settlement‚Äîdescribed as a township (polichnion) and later as a fortress (kastron)‚Äîre-appears in the peninsula and that the bishopric is mentioned again, as a suffragan of Thessalonica. The area prospered due to its fertility, and both Thessalonians as well as the monks of the growing monastic community at nearby Mount Athos had estates there. In the winter of 1307/08, the peninsula and the city were seized and held by the Catalan Company during their move from Thrace to southern Greece. The 14th-century historian Nikephoros Gregoras describes Kassandreia as \\"abandoned\\" during his time, and sometime before 1407, Emperor John VII Palaiologos rebuilt the old fortifications of Justinian. As a de facto annex of Thessalonica, the peninsula shared the city's fate and came under a brief Venetian control in 1423, before being captured by the Ottoman Empire in ca. 1430. Kassandra () was one of the places that rebelled against the Ottomans in 1821. Because it managed to stop the Turkish army from fighting the south Greece rebels it was burnt from edge to edge. The refugees moved with fishing boats to the islands of Skiathos, Skopelos, Alonissos and Evoia. Nobody lived in the peninsula for more than 30 years. Then the population started to gather again. In 1912 it became a part of Greece. The peninsula was lined with paved road in the mid-20th century. Tourism also arrived after the war period of World War II and the Greek Civil War. More paved roads were added in the 1970s and the 1980s and tourism developed rapidly. Agriculture shifted to tourism and other businesses as the primary industry of the peninsula in the 1980s. On August 22, 2006, the peninsula was struck by a major forest fire that affected the central and the southern parts of the peninsula, on the day of the heatwave when temperatures soared to nearly 40 ¬∞C. Several houses were destroyed including villas and hotels, and one campground disappeared, while the natural beauty was erased. It burnt large areas of forests including some farmlands. The cause of this tremendous fire was dry lightning which occurred throughout the evening. The forest fire lasted nearly five days and devastated the economy and the peninsula. Villages that were affected were Chanioti, Nea Skioni, Polychrono, Pefkochori, Kriopigi and Kassandrino. The forests began to recover by 2015.

Until December 29, 1971, it was a first-run movie house and office space, and then after that, the theatre saw sporadic usage until 1973. The United Artists Theatre, designed in a Spanish-Gothic design, sat 2,070 people, and after closing served from 1978 to 1983 as the Detroit Symphony Orchestra's recording theater. After the theater closed, the office block struggled as tenants moved to suburbs. It finally closed in 1984. An original 10-story, vertical UA sign was replaced in the 1950s with a marquee that remained until 2005. The building once shared a lot with the now demolished Hotel Tuller.

Dylan first performed the song during his debut at The Town Hall in New York City on April 12, 1963. Dylan is known to sing the song only rarely in concert. Lyrics The lyrics address the tendency of Americans to believe that God will invariably side with them and oppose those with whom they disagree, thus leaving unquestioned the morality of wars fought and atrocities committed by their country. Dylan mentions several historical events, including the slaughter of Native Americans in the nineteenth century, the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, the American Civil War, World Wars I and II, The Holocaust, the Cold War and the betrayal of Jesus Christ by Judas Iscariot; the song made no explicit reference to the Vietnam War until live renditions in the 1980s, when an additional verse ran thus: Music critic Tim Riley once wrote: \\"'With God on Our Side' manages to voice political savvy mixed with generational naivete\\" as it \\"draws the line for those born long enough after World War I to find its issues blurry ('the reasons for fightin'/I never did get') and who view the forgiveness of the World War II Germans as a farce.\\" The words from the song ‚Äúwhether Judas Iscariot had God on his side‚Äù inspired Tim Rice to write the lyrics of Jesus Christ Superstar from Judas‚Äôs perspective, although that was not, obviously, the point Dylan was making in the song. Controversy over composition The melody of \\"With God on Our Side\\" is essentially identical to the traditional Irish folk song \\"The Merry Month of May\\", which was also used by Dominic Behan in his song \\"The Patriot Game\\". The opening verse is also similar to the second verse of Behan's song, in which the narrator gives his name and age. Behan criticized Dylan publicly by claiming the melody as an original composition. Behan took the view that the provenance of Dylan's entire body of work must be questioned. Behan exercised the same folk tradition as Dylan in writing the song, having himself borrowed the melody. =Incidents of censorship= Anthony B. Herbert, Vietnam War veteran and psychologist, reported an incident related to Joan Baez's 1963 recording of \\"With God on Our Side\\" in a 1984 interview with David Barsamian: Live recordings Dylan and Joan Baez performed the song as a duet at the Newport Folk Festival in July 1963 and July 1964, and their July 27, 1963 performance was released on Newport Broadside: Topical Songs at the Newport Folk Festival 1963 (Vanguard VSD-79144). The liner notes by Stacy Williams mention Dominic Behan's \\"Patriot Game\\", which Williams points out that Behan had borrowed from the traditional \\"The Merry Month of May\\". Another live recording of Dylan and Baez performing \\"With God on Our Side\\", recorded on October 31, 1964, can be found on the album The Bootleg Series Vol. 6: Bob Dylan Live 1964, Concert at Philharmonic Hall, released in 2004. A rare post-1960s performance of the song, recorded on November 4, 1975, with extra lyrics, was included on the bonus disc in the box set The Rolling Thunder Revue: The 1975 Live Recordings (2019). Conversely, Dylan's performance of the song on the album Bob Dylan Unplugged, released in 1995, significantly omits verses about the Germans and the Holocaust, and the Russians and the Cold War, for unspecified reasons. Use in films and documentaries *\\"With God on Our Side\\" plays over the closing credits of two films, Oren Jacoby's 2007 documentary on anti-Semitism, Constantine's Sword, and Oliver Stone's 2008 biography of George W.

Control of Guangzhou (Canton) and the Pearl River Delta would provide a base to make the blockade of Guangdong province more effective by seizing southern China's major port and isolate the British port of Hong Kong.  Background  By the end of 1937, south China was crucial to the Republic of China as a means of maintaining contact with the outside world. Guangzhou and Hongkong served as vital centers of transportation and international aid to Chiang Kai-Shek. Approximately 80 percent of supplies from abroad to the Chinese forces in the interior passed through Guangzhou. Imperial General Headquarters believed that a blockade of Guangdong province would deprive China of essential war material and the ability to prolong the war. In 1936 the Hankow-Canton (Hankou- Guangzhou) railway was completed. With the Kowloon-Canton (Hong Kong- Guangzhou) railway, this formed a rapid all-rail link from south China to central and northern China. For the first sixteen months of the war about 60,000 tons of goods transited per month through the port of Hong Kong. The central government also reported the import of 1.5 million gallons of gasoline (4,100 tons) through Hong Kong in 1938. More than 700,000 tons of goods would eventually reach Hankou using the new railway. For comparison, the Soviet Union was more willing to provide direct military support to prolong the war. In addition to the Sino-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact signed in August 1937, a barter agreement was negotiated to trade munitions for strategic materials such as tungsten and antimony. Starting in 1937 Soviet war material was transported through Xinjiang (Sinkiang) to Lanzhou (Lanchow) using 20,000 camels. Chinese raw materials would travel back the same way or via Hong Kong to Vladivostok. By 1940, 50,000 camels and hundreds of trucks were transporting 2,000-3,000 tons of Soviet war material per month into China. Japanese planning for operations began in early November 1937. The objectives of the blockade could be achieved by seizing a portion of Daya Bay and conducting air operations from there. In December 1937, the 5th Army with the 11th Division, the Formosa Mixed Brigade and the 4th Air Brigade were activated in Formosa under the command Lt. Gen. Motoo Furusho to accomplish this objective. Due to the proximity of Daya Bay to Hongkong, the Japanese Government feared that trouble might break out between Britain and Japan. The operation was subsequently suspended and the 5th Army was deactivated. By June 1938, the Battle of Wuhan caused the Imperial General Headquarters to realize that it could not localize the fighting. Imperial General Headquarters reversed policy and began preparations to capture Guangzhou and expedite the settlement of the war.  Prelude  = 4th War Area Army = The 4th War Area Army under the command of He Yingqin in 1938 was assigned to the defense of south China. General Yu Hanmou was in command of the 12th Army Group defending Guangdong province. Eight divisions and two brigades of regular army troops were deployed in the vicinity of Guangzhou. Another five divisions of regular army troops were deployed in Fujian province. The 4th War Area Army totalled about 110,000 regular army troops. Most regular army units in Guangxi province and four divisions from Guangdong had been transferred north to participate in the Battle of Wuhan. In addition to regular army troops, two militia divisions were deployed in the vicinity of Guangzhou and the Guanxi militia consisted of five militia divisions in Guangxi province. The militia divisions would generally be recruited from the local civilian population and disbanded as the army moved through new areas. These divisions were generally employed for security, supply transportation and reconnaissance. The main strength of the Chinese forces in Guangdong were concentrated in Guangzhou and to the immediate east of the city. Other elements defended Chaozhou and western Guangdong. Chinese defensive installations included the Humen fortress overlooking the mouth of the Pearl River and three defensive lines near Daya Bay. Three batteries of four three-inch guns, a battery of three 120mm guns and Soviet 37mm guns were stationed in Guangzhou for anti-air defense. = Japanese Blockade = Prior to the Canton Operation, the Imperial Japanese Navy conducted an aerial and naval interdiction campaign against China's communication lines to neighbouring regions. Japan believed that the blockade would hasten the end of the war. Disruption of the Chinese logistics network was the primary Japanese objective in Guangdong province from August 1937 until October 1938. The 5th Fleet's 10th Division blockaded and patrolled the coast from Haimenchen, Zhejiang to Shantou and the 5th Destroyer Squadron patrolled the coast south of Shantou. Occasionally Japanese units from the Marianas were deployed in support of coastal blockade operations in south China. These usually consisted of cruisers accompanied by a flotilla of destroyers. One or two aircraft carriers and fleet auxiliaries would also be on station. Naval interdictions focused on stopping junks ferrying military supplies from Hong Kong to coastal China. The first recorded attack occurred in September 1937 when eleven junks were sunk by a Japanese submarine. Although the Japanese were able to blockade Chinese shipping and ports, foreign shipping could still enter and depart from Hong Kong. The central government had setup Hong Kong as a warehouse for munitions and supplies to pass through. Aerial interdictions directed bombers against Chinese railway bridges and trains in Guangdong. Starting from October 1937, the Japanese launched air raids against the Sunning railway. The attacks targeted government facilities and bridges in Jiangmen (Kongmoon) and towns along the railway. By 1938, airstrikes against the Kowloon-Canton railway became a common occurrence with damaged trains found periodically along the railway. An air defense early warning system was established to shunt trains during air raids into forested areas that provided overhead concealment. In May 1938 the Colonial Office and the Foreign Office approved a Chinese request to construct and operate a locomotive repair yard within the New Territories to keep the railway operational. Airstrikes conducted against rail facilities in Guangzhou were designed to interrupt rail supplies from Hong Kong so that Japan would not be required to commit to land operations in south China. However, the air raids had failed to severely impede railway operations or stop supplies moving through Hunan or Guangxi. The blockade in south China also included attacks against aircraft flying out of Hong Kong. In November 1937, a Royal Navy aircraft from HMS Eagle encountered Japanese naval anti-aircraft fire off the coast of Hong Kong. In December 1937, fifteen Japanese bombers overflew Lantau Island and the Taikoo docks. In August 1938 Japanese naval aircraft shot down a China National Aviation Corporation passenger plane and another two passenger planes from the Eurasia Aviation Corporation were shot down the following month. In addition to airstrikes against military targets, the Japanese conducted politically motivated terror bombing in Guangzhou. Bombing of Guangzhou intensified starting from May to June 1938 with the employment of incendiary munitions and low-level strafing attacks against ships. The IJN air service operating from bases in Taiwan (Formosa) and the aircraft carrier Kaga conducted about 400 airstrikes during this period and continued into July. By the end of summer only 600,000 of the original 1.3 million residents remained in the city of Guangzhou. From August 1937 to October 1938 casualties in Guangzhou were estimated at 6,000 killed and 8,000 injured.

At the beginning of the season, Glouchkov impressed the Suns with his strong rebounding and became a regular member of the team's playing rotation; as the year went on, however, Glouchkov began gaining weight, and his productivity decreased. Some Suns' staff members attributed his weight gain to his taste for American fast food and candy, but rumors also surfaced that he was experimenting with steroids. He ended the 1985-86 NBA season with averages of 4.9 points and 3.3 rebounds per game.https://www.basketball- reference.com/players/g/gloucge01.html. Retrieved 25 August 2006.

The Suns never determined the cause of his weight fluctuations, but after a poor performance in summer league competition, the Suns advised him to return to Europe.AP Sports Wire. August 20, 1986.

The large white space on the right is the Forbidden City. The Imperial City () is a section of the city of Beijing in the Ming and Qing dynasties, with the Forbidden City at its center. It refers to the collection of gardens, shrines, and other service areas between the Forbidden City and the Inner City of ancient Beijing. The Imperial City was surrounded by a wall and accessed through seven gates and it includes historical places such as the Forbidden City, Tiananmen, Zhongnanhai, Beihai Park, Zhongshan Park, Jingshan, Imperial Ancestral Temple, and Xiancantan.The Imperial City Art Museum China Through A Lens  Construction  Location of the Imperial City within the walled city of Beijing in the Qing dynasty. Gate of China, formerly the formal gateway to the Imperial City. This view is from the Zhengyangmen. Behind the Gate of China is Tiananmen and the Forbidden City. Tiananmen, the southern gate of the Imperial City The Beihai Park, a former imperial garden centred on one of the lakes which cover most of the western part of the former Imperial City. The Altar of Earth and Harvests in the Imperial City, built in 1421. The altar compound is now Zhongshan Park. Jingshan Hill, an artificial hill with five peaks located to the north of the Forbidden City. In the Yuan dynasty, Beijing was known as Dadu, and the Imperial City formed the centre of the city. In 1368, the Ming armies conquered Dadu, and changed its name to \\"Beiping\\" (the two characters meaning \\"north\\" and \\"peace\\" or \\"pacified\\"), with the capital moved to Nanjing. Because the Imperial City was untouched by battle, most of the Imperial City survived the war; however, in 1369, the Hongwu Emperor ordered that the Imperial City be demolished. In 1370, the Hongwu Emperor's fourth son Zhu Di was created Prince of Yan, with seat in Beiping. In 1379 he built a princely palace within the Yuan Imperial City. In 1399, Zhu Di launched a coup d'√©tat and ascended to the throne to become Yongle Emperor in 1402. In 1403, the name of Beiping was changed to Beijing (literally \\"the Northern Capital\\"), and in 1406 a plan was drafted to move the capital to Beijing. In 1406, construction of the Forbidden City began, copying the layout of the existing palaces in Nanjing. The new imperial palace was placed in the site of Yuan palace. Earth dug up from construction of the moat were used to construct Jingshan Hill to the north of the imperial palace. On the basis of the Yuan Imperial City, the area was expanded to encompass the lakes of Zhongnanhai and Beihai and a significant area beyond.  Ming dynasty  The Imperial City centres on the Forbidden City. To the west of the Forbidden City are the Zhongnanhai and Beihai, which were surrounded by imperial gardens and collectively known as the Western Park or Xiyuan. To the north of the Forbidden City is Jingshan Park contains Jingshan Hill and Shouhuang Hall. To the south of the Forbidden City are the Imperial Shrine of Family or Imperial Ancestral Temple and Altar of Earth and Harvests. Further to the south was the \\"Corridor of a Thousand Steps\\" outside Chengtianmen Gate, to either side of which are the offices of the various government ministries. There are seven gates in the walls of the Imperial City. To the south is the Great Ming Gate (later renamed the Great Qing Gate, Gate of China). Behind the Great Ming Gate was the Chengtianmen Gate, (later renamed the Tian'anmen, \\"Gate of Heavenly Peace\\"). To either side of the Chengtianmen were the Left Chang'an Gate and the Right Chang'an Gate. To the east was Dong'anmen Gate (\\"Gate of Eastern Peace\\"); to the west was the Xi'anmen Gate (\\"Gate of Western Peace\\"). To the north was Bei'anmen (later renamed the Di'anmen, \\"Gate of Earthly Peace\\"). Also housed in the Imperial City were a number of service buildings for the imperial palace, warehouses, Taoist temples, and a palace for the Imperial Grandson.  Qing dynasty  After the fall of the Ming Dynasty, the rulers of the Qing removed most of the service buildings. Apart from a narrow area surrounding the lakes of Zhongnanhai and Beihai, the western parts of the Imperial City were given to princes and members of the Eight Banners as residential land. Likewise, apart from a small number of warehouses, the eastern parts of the Imperial City were also given to members of the Eight Banners as residential land. To the collection of temples in the Imperial City was added a Catholic church on the western shore of Zhongnanhai.  Republic of China to present  After the fall of the Qing dynasty in 1912, the Republic of China government took over the Imperial City. Zhongnanhai was, for a time, converted into the Presidential Palace for Beiyang Government. The Imperial Ancestral Temple became a part of the Palace Museum. Beihai and Jingshan became public parks. Most of the former temples and imperial warehouses gradually became private residences. In 1912, during a coup by warlord Cao Kun, the Dong'anmen gate was destroyed by fire. In 1914, the Corridor of a Thousand Steps was demolished to make way for Zhongshan Park, named after Sun Yat-sen. In 1915, in order to improve traffic, much of the wall surrounding the Imperial City was demolished except the southern wall along Chang‚Äôan Avenue. After the capital was moved to Nanjing, Zhongnanhai became a public park. In 1949, the People's Republic of China was established in Beijing. In the next few years, Gate of China, Left Chang'an Gate, Right Chang'an Gate, the three remaining eastern and western gates, and Di'anmen were demolished. Zhongnanhai became the presidential palace of the new government, housing the central headquarters of the Communist Party of China and the State Council. Many of the surviving buildings in the former garden were demolished. The area to the west of Beihai Park were occupied by the Department of Defence, with a large office building now dominating the park skyline. Most of the temples in the Imperial City were occupied by units of the People's Liberation Army. Some of these buildings remain occupied and are in severe disrepair. In recent decade, the Beijing municipal government has restored several of these temples, and established a park around the remaining sections of the Imperial City wall. Plans were drawn up to gradually move out institutions occupying various historical buildings. In 2004, a 1984 ordinance relating to building height and planning restriction was renewed to establish the Imperial City area and the northern city area as a buffer zone for the Forbidden City. In 2005, a proposal was released to include the Imperial City and Beihai as extension items to the Forbidden City as a World Heritage Site.

The Great Western Cattle Trail was used during the late 19th century for movement of cattle and horses to markets in eastern and northern states. It is also known as the Western Trail, Fort Griffin Trail, Dodge City Trail, Northern Trail and Texas Trail. It replaced the Chisholm trail when that closed. While it wasn't as well known, it was greater in length, reaching railheads up in Kansas and Nebraska and carried longhorns and horses to stock open-range ranches in the Dakotas, Wyoming, Montana, and two provinces in Canada. It took almost one hundred days to reach their destination. The Great Western Trail ran south of and roughly parallel to the Chisholm Trail into Kansas. The cattle were taken to towns located on major railroads and delivered north to establish ranches. Although rail lines were built in Texas, the cattle drives north continued because Texas rail prices made it more profitable to trail them north..  History  The Great Western Cattle Trail was first traveled by Captain John T. Lytle in 1874 when he was transporting 3,500 longhorn cattle up from Southern Texas into Nebraska. In five short years, it became one of the most traveled and famous cattle trails in U.S. history. Despite its popularity, traffic along the trail began to decline in 1885 due to the spreading use of barbed wire fences and legislation calling for a quarantine of Texas cattle due to the \\"Texas Fever\\", a disease spread by ticks. The last major Cattle drive up the trail was on its way to Deadwood, South Dakota, in 1893. By that time an estimated six to seven million cattle and one million horses had traversed the trail. The Texas Trail was used by the XIT Ranch for trail drives connecting Tascosa to Dodge City until 1885. Afterwards, the Northern Trail connected Buffalo Springs to the XIT range on Cedar Creek, 60 miles north of Miles City, Montana. The trail passed through Lamar, Colorado, Kit Carson, Colorado, and Lusk, Wyoming. That trail was used from 1886 until 1897. Over a period of 3 months, some 10,000 to 12,500 steers were moved from the Yellow Houses, at the south end of the XIT Ranch, 1000 miles north to Cedar Creek. There they would graze for two years before being shipped to Chicago. Later, in order to commemorate the significance of the cattle-drive era, two markers were erected in the 1930s at Doan's. Doan's was seen as the last \\"stepping-off point\\" before entering Indian Territory that sold supplies, firearms & ammo, tobacco, provisions, Stetson hats, and anything else that would be required on the long trek. C.E. Doan had kept a meticulous record of the companies and trail bosses along with the number of cattle that crossed his path each year, allowing for numbers and history to be preserved, so a marker was fitting. In 2003 a new project was launched in order to place cement markers every six to ten miles along the trail, from the Rio Grande to Ogallala, Nebraska. Oklahoma set the first post south of the city at Altus. Texas placed its first marker at the Doan's adobe house during the 121st Doan's May Day Picnic of 2005. The picnic was first held in 1884 on the first Saturday of May at the now-ghost town of Doans, north of Vernon, Texas. A barbecue lunch and T-shirts are available for purchase, and a king and queen are crowned at the event. One of the shirts for 2017 features a design by Harold Dow Bugbee, former curator of the Panhandle-Plains Historical Museum in Canyon, Texas, which depicts longhorns and a cowboy crossing the Red River at Doan's Crossing. There the postmaster Corwin F. Doan (1848-1929) also operated a store to supply the cowboys.Thomas Lindsay Baker, Ghost Towns of Texas (Norman: University of Oklahoma Press, 1986). Bugbee's sculpture is part of the 1931 Trail Drivers Monument at Doans. During the event, riders cross the river each year from Oklahoma and usually arrive just before noon. The adobe house, built in 1881, is the oldest in Wilbarger County, and is open for tours during the picnic. Markers were also placed in another major stopping point of the Great Western Cattle Trail, Seymour, Texas. One marker was erected in 1972 by the Seymour Historical Society, another four have been added since. Seymour was historically a popular campsite for cowboys since it was a major supply center. In fact, cowboys and Indians mingled in peace. In part due to the Great Western Cattle Trail's traffic, Seymour was seen as an ideal place to host a cowboy reunion. Jeff Scott was the retired cowboy who broached the idea and it 'took'. In 1896 the Cowboy's Reunion was organized and had 10,000 spectators. The following year, 1897, Native American chief Quanah Parker attended the Reunion, where he performed war dances with 300-500 of his braves. The tradition of the cowboy reunion still continues today, except that it is now called the Seymour Rodeo and Reunion, and occurs on the second weekend of each July.  Landmarks on the trail  Due to the project launched in 2003 it is easy for people to find where the Great Western Cattle Trail was since there are now cement markers every six to ten miles along the way. It was not always so, however. Cowboys used to have to find their way using landmarks. The major ones were Mt. Tepee, Big Elk Crossing, and Soldier's Spring. Mt. Tepee is actually Mount Webster, but it looked like a giant white Tepee standing out against the rest of the Wichita Mountains, and so was a useful landmark. It wouldn't be long before they reached Big Elk Creek, and needed to cross it. Big Elk Crossing was an ideal place to get the job done. Most of the time river crossings are unfortunate because they will bog down the cattle in mud that will be difficult to push lagers and sore-footed animals through at the end. There also is the danger that an animal will break a leg. Finding a stone crossing such as Big Elk was ideal. It was placed at a horseshoe bend in the creek, which acted like a natural corral to contain and herd the animals during the crossing. After crossing, it would take maybe a day or so to reach the next landmark: Soldier's Spring. Soldier's Spring is not as easily found today. It was a huge, red, sandstone bluff that was taller than a man's head, with spring water spilling out of its face and pooling at the bottom. The reason it was called Soldier's Spring was that it reportedly had names and ranks cut into it and the surrounding rocks. It was a fantastic place to camp while along the trail. All that remains of it today is a few broken rocks and a small, spring-fed pool. Despite the apparent languidness of the journey, there were always dangers. One of the major ones was stampeding. If a herd got spooked, that would mean that as many as 3,000 longhorn cattle would be in a panic-induced stampede. At that point the only thing that could safely stop them would be to corral them till they were all running in one big circle. Then the herd could let off steam safely and calm down while causing as little damage as possible. Cowboys had to be able to jump on their horses at a moments notice during the night in case of such an instance. Naturally there were precautions taken against such things. First off there was the response tactics aforementioned, but Cowboys would also sing softly to their cattle while on watch in order to cover up any sharp, unexpected noises that could cause the herd to spook, and they were extra careful when the weather turned stormy. But it wasn't only natural noises that could cause a herd to stampede. During the time of the Great Western Cattle Trail there was also the forced relocation of Native Americans to the Cheyenne-Arapaho Reservation, effectively destroying native way of life. There are no reports of Natives being hostile to earlier Cattle Drivers, but as the Trail grew in traffic and popularity the Natives began demanding payment for the excellent grazing their territory provided. Of course, the Trail Boss never did give the usual 7 to 8 heads the Natives asked for, but usually gave 3 to 4 of the cattle that would either die on the trail, not fetch as good a price as others at market, or was one of the stragglers from a different drive. The Natives weren't exactly in a place to and didn't usually complain upon receiving beef. If they did not receive their beef, however, they would spook and stampede the herd during the night. This was not only problematic for everyone involved in the Cattle Drive, but it also meant greater potential loss than if they had peacefully paid the Native's toll, and could cause lasting damage to settlers. When hostilities got particularly bad, the Soldiers assigned to the Washita River Crossing by Edwardsville Rock was in charge of escorting Cattle Drives from the Red River's Doan Crossing to the Washita River. Fort Elliot troops took it from there. The Washita River soldiers were believed to be the ones who carved on Soldier's Spring during their patrols, though no one has ever confirmed it. Even in cities the dangers of the trail continued. Cowboys who spent weeks on the trail were spoiling for trouble, and they found it in places such as Dodge City. With Saloons, alcohol and pent up energy, it wasn't surprising that more than a few Cowboys got involved in duels or shootings of one kind or another. The Boot Hill Cemetery at Dodge City was soon populated by Cowboys and the civilians and occasional town marshal they put there.

United States, 516 U.S. 137 (1995), was a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court interpreted a frequently used section of the federal criminal code. At the time of the decision, (c) imposed a mandatory, consecutive five-year prison term on anyone who \\"during and in relation to any... drug trafficking crime... uses a firearm.\\" The lower court had sustained the defendants' convictions, defining \\"use\\" in such a way as to mean little more than mere possession. The Supreme Court ruled instead that \\"use\\" means \\"active employment\\" of a firearm, and sent the cases back to the lower court for further proceedings. As a result of the Court's decision in Bailey, Congress amended the statute to expressly include possession of a firearm as requiring the additional five-year prison term.  Background  In May 1989, Bailey was stopped in the District of Columbia for not having a front license plate on his car. Bailey could not produce a driver's license, and the officers ordered him out of the car. As Bailey was exiting the car, the officers saw him stuff something between the seat and the front console. A subsequent search of the passenger compartment revealed 27 plastic bags containing a total of 30 grams of cocaine. In the trunk of the car the officers found a loaded nine-millimeter pistol. In June 1991, Robinson was the target of two controlled purchases of cocaine. The police then obtained a search warrant and searched Robinson's one-bedroom apartment, where they found an unloaded .22 caliber pistol and 11 grams of crack cocaine. They also found a marked $20 bill from one of the prior controlled purchases. Both Bailey and Robinson were charged with numerous crimes, including violations of 18 U.S.C. ¬ß 924(c)(1), which forbade using or carrying a firearm during and in relation to a drug crime. At Bailey's trial, a government witness testified that drug dealers frequently carry a firearm to protect both the drugs and themselves. There was similar testimony at Robinson's trial. Bailey and Robinson were both convicted of all the charges against them, including the ¬ß 924(c) charge. They each appealed their convictions to the District of Columbia Circuit. A three- judge panel of the court affirmed Bailey's ¬ß 924(c) conviction, but another three-judge panel reversed Robinson's. To correct this disparity, the court consolidated both cases and reheard them en banc. It held that \\"one uses a gun, i.e., avails oneself of a gun, and therefore violates [¬ß 924(c)(1)], whenever one puts or keeps the gun in a particular place from which one (or one's agent) can gain access to it if and when needed to facilitate a drug crime.\\" Because in both Bailey's and Robinson's cases the gun was sufficiently accessible and proximate to the drugs that the jury could have concluded that the gun was there to protect the drugs. The Supreme Court agreed to review the case to resolve a split of authority among the federal courts of appeals about the meaning of the word \\"use\\" in ¬ß 924(c).  Opinion of the Court  The Supreme Court rejected the interpretation of the D.C. Circuit, and held that \\"use\\" of a firearm requires \\"active employment\\" of the firearm, \\"a use that makes the firearm an operative factor in relation to the predicate offense.\\" Context is important because the word \\"use\\" has so many meanings--\\"I use a gun to protect my house, but I've never had to use it.\\" The statute did not impose liability for mere possession, though Congress could easily have done so if it had wanted to. Accordingly, the D.C. Circuit's mistake stemmed from its defining \\"use\\" by \\"accessibility and proximity,\\" a standard that in practice swept up more than active employment but most instances of mere possession. \\"In practice, nearly every possession of a firearm by a person engaged in drug trafficking would satisfy the standard.\\" Because Congress did not draft the statute to criminalize mere possession, the D.C. Circuit's gloss ran contrary to Congress's intent. But the language of the statute by itself did not answer the real question at the heart of the case--if use was not the same as mere possession, what else beyond mere possession would the government have to prove to make out a violation of ¬ß 924(c)? Webster's Dictionary and Black's Law Dictionary defined \\"use\\" as \\"[t]o convert to one's service,\\" \\"to employ,\\" \\"to avail oneself of,\\" and \\"to carry out a purpose or action by means of.\\" These definitions implied action and implementation. Furthermore, the statute also made it illegal for someone to carry a firearm in relation to a drug crime, and the Court assumed that \\"carrying\\" was meant to supply an alternative basis for a ¬ß 924(c) charge. By limiting \\"use\\" to \\"active employment,\\" the Court left room for someone to use a firearm without carrying it, as by brandishing the gun or bartering it, and to carry a firearm without using it, as by hiding it in clothing during the transaction. Defining \\"use\\" as \\"active employment\\" required the Court to remand the cases for further proceedings. Bailey's gun was in the trunk of his car; there was no evidence that he was actively employing the gun at the time of his arrest. Similarly, Robinson's gun was in a locked footlocker in her bedroom closet. But the court of appeals had not considered whether the \\"carry\\" prong supported the convictions, so the Court remanded the case for further proceedings.  Subsequent developments  After Bailey was issued, however, Congress responded by broadening the statute, essentially overruling the Court's decision by statutory amendment. The statute now criminalizes using or carrying a firearm in connection with a drug trafficking offense or crime of violence, as well as the mere possession of a firearm in furtherance of such an offense. This did not affect the Bailey defendants themselves, or any defendant whose \\"crime\\" had occurred before Congress amended 18 U.S.C. ¬ß 924(c) since the Constitution forbids enactment of ex post facto law. A cascade of sentence reductions and collateral appeals followed the decision, since it effectively held that the conduct to which thousands of defendants had pleaded guilty did not constitute a crime at the time that conduct was undertaken.

Located in the Cass Corridor of Detroit, Michigan, at 500 Temple Street, the building serves as a home to various masonic organizations including the York Rite Sovereign College of North America. The building contains a variety of public spaces including three theaters, three ballrooms and banquet halls, and a clear-span drill hall. Recreational facilities include a swimming pool, handball court, gymnasium, bowling alley, and a pool hall. The building includes numerous lodge rooms, offices, and dining spaces, as well as a hotel section. Although the hotel rooms are available to any noble of the mystic shrine or blue lodge mason, none is currently in usable condition. Architect George D. Mason designed the whole structure as well as the Masonic Temple Theatre, a venue for concerts, Broadway shows, and other special events in the Detroit Theater District. It contains a stage, one of the largest in the country. The Detroit Masonic Temple was designed in the neo-gothic architectural style, using a great deal of limestone. The ritual building features 16 floors, stands tall, with 1,037 rooms. It dominates the skyline in an area known as Cass Corridor, across Temple Street from Cass Park, and Cass Technical High School. It is within walking distance of the Little Caesars Arena and the MotorCity Casino Hotel. History Masonic Temple, circa 1920s The Masonic Temple Association was incorporated in Detroit in 1894. It moved into its first temple, on Lafayette Boulevard at First Street, in 1896. Outgrowing these quarters, the Association purchased land on Bagg Street (now Temple Avenue) to build a new temple that would also include a public theater. Fund-raising for construction of the building raised $2.5 million (equivalent to $ million in ), and ground-breaking took place on Thanksgiving Day, 1920.Zietz, Karyl Lynn (1996). The National Trust Guide to Great Opera Houses in America, p. 103. John Wiley & Sons, Inc. The cornerstone was placed on September 19, 1922, using the same trowel that George Washington had used to set the cornerstone of the United States Capitol in Washington D.C.. The building was dedicated on Thanksgiving Day, 1926. The horseshoe-shaped auditorium originally had a capacity of 5,000. Due to poor sight lines along the sides of the stage, nearly 600 seats were removed (or never used), reducing maximum seating to 4,404. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980, and is part of the Cass Park Historic District, which was established in 2005. In April 2013, the building was reported to be in foreclosure over $152,000 in back taxes owed to Wayne County. The debt was paid off in May 2013, and in June 2013, it was revealed that $142,000 of the bill was footed by singer-songwriter Jack White, a Detroit native known for his work with The White Stripes. He wanted to help the temple in its time of need as they had helped his mother in a time of need: the temple gave her a job as an usher in the theater when she was struggling to find work. In response, the Detroit Masonic Temple Association renamed its Scottish Rite cathedral the Jack White Theater. Architecture Masonic Temple, 2019 The Detroit Masonic Temple has been the largest Masonic Temple in the world since 1939, when the Chicago Masonic Temple was demolished. The stage of the auditorium is the second largest in the United States, having a width between walls of 100 feet (30 m) and a depth from the curtain line of 55 feet (17 m). The large complex includes a 16-story ritual building connected to a 10-story wing for the Ancient Arabic Order of the Nobles of the Mystic Shrine, now known as Shriners International, by the 7-story Auditorium Building. In between these areas are a 1,586-seat Scottish Rite Cathedral, and a drill hall used for trade shows and conventions. The drill hall is also home to Detroit Roller Derby. The drill hall has a floating floor, where the entire floor is laid on felt cushions. This type of construction, also known as a sprung floor, provides 'give' to the floor which tends to relieve the marchers. The building houses two ballrooms: the Crystal Ballroom; and the Fountain Ballroom, the latter of which measures and accommodates up to 1,000 people. An unfinished theatre located in the top floor of the tower would have seated about 700. Seven \\"Craft Lodge Rooms\\" all have different decorative treatments, the motifs of decoration being taken from the Egyptian, Doric, Ionic, Corinthian, Italian Renaissance, Byzantine, Gothic, and Romanesque styles. All of the artwork throughout the building, especially the decorated ceilings, was done under the direction of Italian artists. The building includes Royal Arch room, as well as a Commandery Asylum for the Knights Templar. The Scottish Rite Cathedral has a seating capacity of 1600. Its stage is 64-feet (19.5 m) wide from wall to wall, with a depth of 37 feet (11 m) from the foot lights. Architect George D. Mason designed the theatre, which contains a 55-foot- by-100-foot (17 x 30 m) stage. Detroit Masonic Temple was designed in the neo- gothic architectural style, and is faced with Indiana limestone. Although few Masonic buildings are in the Gothic style, the architect believed that Gothic best exemplified Masonic traditions. Much of the stone, plaster, and metal work in the interior of the building was designed and executed by architectural sculptor Corrado Parducci. The three figures over the main entrance were by Leo Friedlander, while the rest of the considerable architectural sculpture on the exterior was by Bill Gehrke.

Robert and Barbara remained married until 1553, when shortly after Mary I of England came to the throne she imprisoned Holgate on various charges, with his being a married clergy being central to these. In 1554 Holgate renounced his marriage claiming he had only entered it to avoid suspicion as a papist. In January 1555 Holgate was released from prison, but he was not restored to priestly office. He died later that year.A. G.

Winner of two American Book Awards, her work is often associated with the Language School, the poetry of the New York School, phenomenology, and visual art. She is married to the painter Richard Tuttle, with whom she has frequently collaborated. Personal life Berssenbrugge was born in Beijing to Chinese and Dutch-American parents, and grew up near Boston, Massachusetts. She was educated at Barnard, Reed, and Columbia University. After receiving her M.F.A. from Columbia in 1974, she settled in rural northern New Mexico, which has remained her primary residence ever since. Poetry After receiving her degree, Berssenbrugge became active in the multicultural poetry movement of the 1970s along with Leslie Marmon Silko as well as Ishmael Reed, theater director Frank Chin, and political activist Kathleen Chang. Berssenbrugge taught at the Institute of American Indian Art in Santa Fe, where she co-founded the internal literary journal Tyuonyi. Traveling frequently to New York City, Berssenbrugge became engaged in the rich cultural flourishing of the abstract art movement, and was influenced by New York School poets John Ashbery, Barbara Guest, James Schuyler and Anne Waldman, and then the Language poets, including Charles Bernstein, as well as artist Susan Bee.Hinton, Laura.\\"Three Conversations with Mei-mei Berssenbrugge\\" Jacket, Issue 27, 2005 She later joined the contributing editorial board for the literary journal Conjunctions. Berssenbrugge's poetry is known for its mix of philosophical meditation and personal experience, and for moving quickly between abstract language and the concrete particulars of immediate perception. Her poems often contain subtle shifts of grammar and perspective, and Berssenbrugge often works with collage to produce unexpected juxtapositions. Her work is also known for its exploration of the complexities of cultural and political identity, an interest informed by her own experience of cultural and linguistic displacement. =Fish Souls= Fish Souls is Berssenbrugge's first published collection of poems. It was published by Greenwood Press in 1971. Only 100 numbered copies were published. Information about this volume is scarce. =Summits Move With the Tide= Summits Move With the Tide, subtitled (on the cover of the second edition) Poems and a Play, is Berssenbrugge's second collection of poems. It was published by the Greenfield Review Press in 1974, and later in 1982. The acknowledgments page indicates that some of the poems previously appeared in First Issue, Intro 3, East-West Journal, Cathedral, Ash Tree, Gidra, and Greenwood Press. In contrast to her later books, most the poems in the collection are short, with only a few carrying over to new pages. Additionally, only two poems are broken into numbered stanzas, a format Berssenbrugge would use in later poems. The poems in the collection are organized into four groups: three groups of poems, and one play, One, Two Cups. The book contains the following poems: Group 1: Aegean; Finn Song To the Bear Ghosts; Bog; Book of the Dead, Prayer; El Bosco; Spirit; Hopi Basketweaver Song; Beetle is Born, Lives ...; Los Sangre de Cristos; In Bhaudanath; Snow Mountains; Red Backs & Autumn Leaves ...; and Ghost. Group 2: Old Man Let's Go Fishing In ...; Travelling [sic] Through Your Country; Propeller Sleep; Fish & Swimmers & Lonely Birds ...; Spaces are Death; The Second Moment; The Third Moment; Perpetual Motions; Leaving Your Country; The Old Know By Midsummer; and Abortion. Group 3: Written Before Easter in New York; Chronicle; Tracks; On The Winter Solstice; Blossom; Hudson Ice Floes; Poor Mouse; Sky; and March Wind. Group 4: The play, One, Two Cups. =Random Possession= Random Possession was published by I. Reed Books in 1982. On the contents page the poems are separated spatially into five unnumbered groups (with only the first three listed on the contents page). The pagination bears out the scheme, with one empty page between the groups. The book contains the following poems: Group 1: Chronicle. Group 2: The Membrane; Rabbit, Hair, Leaf; On the Mountain with the Deer; The Suspension Bridge; Numbers of the Date Become the Names of Birds; Spring Street Bar; Heat Wave; The Intention of Two Rivers; For The Tails of Comets; and Sleep. Group 3: The Field for Blue Corn; The Reservoir; The White Beaver; Breaking the Circumference; A Deer Listening; You and You; and Goodbye, Goodbye. Group 4: The Scientific Method (for Walter); Walter Calls It a Dream Screen; The Constellation Quilt; Run-off and Silt; The Translation of Verver; and Commentary. Group 5: Tail. =The Heat Bird= In The Heat Bird, Berssenbrugge shifted to a long-verse format. The book contains only four poems, all several pages long and broken into numbered stanzas: Pack Rat Sieve; Farolita; Ricochet Off Water; and The Heat Bird. The verso indicates that some of the poems in the book were previously published in Conjunctions, Contact II, Roof, and Telephone. =Empathy= Empathy was published by Station Hill Press in 1989, and contains three numbered groups of poems. The verso indicates that some of the poems appeared in Bridge, Calaban, Conjunctions, Parnassus, Temblor, and Tyuonyi. The book is dedicated to Bradford Morrow and Sheffield Van Buren, and contains the following poems: Group 1: The Blue Taj; Tan Tien; Alakanak Break-Up; Texas; Duration of Water; The Star Field; and Chinese Space. Group 2: Jealousy; Recitative; The Carmelites; The Margin; Naturalism; and Fog. Group 3: War Insurance; Empathy; The Swan; Forms of Politeness; and Honeymoon. =Sphericity= Sphericity was published by Kelsey Street Press in 1993, and was her second collaboration with Richard Tuttle. The first edition of Sphericity was limited to 2000 copies, with the first 50 signed by Berssenbrugge and Tuttle and hand-colored by Tuttle. The book consists of six long poems, all with several numbered stanzas: Ideal; Size; Combustion; Sphericity; Experience; and Value. =Endocrinology= Endocrinology is an artists' book made in collaboration with visual artist Kiki Smith. Forty copies were produced by Universal Limited Art Editions from a maquette made by Berssenbrugge and Smith.Hinton, Laura.\\"Three Conversations with Mei-mei Berssenbrugge\\" Jacket, Issue 27, 2005 The Kelsey Street Press edition, a facsimile of the original book, was limited to 2,000 copies, with the first 60 signed and numbered. The book contains a single poem: Endocrinology.

It includes theorems (and lemmas, corollaries, conjectures, laws, and perhaps even the odd object) that are well known in mathematics, but which are not named for the originator. That is, these items on this list illustrate Stigler's law of eponymy (which is not, of course, due to Stephen Stigler, who credits Robert K Merton). *Benford's law. This was first stated in 1881 by Simon Newcomb, and rediscovered in 1938 by Frank Benford. The first rigorous formulation and proof seems to be due to Ted Hill in 1988.; see also the contribution by Persi Diaconis. *Bertrand's ballot theorem. This result concerning the probability that the winner of an election was ahead at each step of ballot counting was first published by W. A. Whitworth in 1878, but named after Joseph Louis Fran√ßois Bertrand who rediscovered it in 1887.. A common proof uses Andr√©'s reflection method, though the proof by D√©sir√© Andr√© did not use any reflections. *B√©zout's theorem. The statement may have been made first by Isaac Newton in 1665. The matter of a proof was taken up by Colin MacLaurin (c. 1720) and Leonhard Euler as well as √âtienne B√©zout (c. 1750). However, B√©zout's \\"proof\\" was incorrect. The first correct proof seems to be due mostly to Georges-Henri Halphen in the 1870s. *Burnside's lemma. This was stated and proved without attribution in Burnside's 1897 textbook, but it had previously been discussed by Augustin Cauchy, in 1845, and by Georg Frobenius in 1887. *Cayley‚ÄìHamilton theorem. The theorem was first proved in the easy special case of 2√ó2 matrices by Cayley, and later for the case of 4√ó4 matrices by Hamilton. But it was only proved in general by Frobenius in 1878.. *Cramer's paradox. This was first noted by Colin Maclaurin in 1720, and then rediscovered by Leonhard Euler in 1748 (whose paper was not published for another two years, as Euler wrote his papers faster than his printers could print them). It was also discussed by Gabriel Cramer in 1750, who independently suggested the essential idea needed for the resolution, although providing a rigorous proof remained an outstanding open problem for much of the 19th century. Even though Cramer had cited Maclaurin, the paradox became known after Cramer rather than Maclaurin. Georges Halphen, Arthur Cayley, and several other luminaries contributed to the earliest more or less correct proof. See for an excellent review. *Cramer's rule. It is named after Gabriel Cramer (1704‚Äì1752), who published the rule in his 1750 Introduction √† l'analyse des lignes courbes alg√©briques, although Colin Maclaurin also published the method in his 1748 Treatise of Algebra (and probably knew of the method as early as 1729). *Frobenius theorem. This fundamental theorem was stated and proved in 1840 by Feodor Deahna. Even though Frobenius cited Deahna's paper in his own 1875 paper, it became known after Frobenius, not Deahna. See for a historical review. *Heine‚ÄìBorel theorem. This theorem was proved in 1872 by √âmile Borel, not by Eduard Heine. Borel used techniques similar to those that Heine used to prove that continuous functions on closed intervals are uniformly continuous. Heine's name was attached because Sch√∂nflies noticed the similarity in Heine's and Borel's approaches. In fact, the theorem was first proved in 1852 by Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet, but Lejeune Dirichlet's lecture notes were not published until 1904. *L'H√¥pital's rule. This rule first appeared in l'H√¥pital's book L'Analyse des Infiniment Petits pour l'Intelligence des Lignes Courbes in 1696. The rule is believed to be the work of Johann Bernoulli since l'H√¥pital, a nobleman, paid Bernoulli a retainer of 300 francs per year to keep him updated on developments in calculus and to solve problems he had. See L'Analyse des Infiniment Petits pour l'Intelligence des Lignes Courbes and reference therein. *Maclaurin series. The Maclaurin series was named after Colin Maclaurin, a professor in Edinburgh, who published this special case of the Taylor series in 1742, but never claimed to have discovered it. *Marden's theorem. This theorem relating the location of the zeros of a complex cubic polynomial to the zeros of its derivative was named by Dan Kalman after Kalman read it in a 1966 book by Morris Marden, who had first written about it in 1945. But, as Marden had himself written, its original proof was by J√∂rg Siebeck in 1864. *Morrie's law. The name is due to physicist Richard Feynman, who used to refer to the identity under that name. Feynman picked that name because he had learned the law during his childhood from a boy with the name Morrie Jacobs.W.A. Beyer, J.D. Louck, and D. Zeilberger, A Generalization of a Curiosity that Feynman Remembered All His Life, Math. Mag. 69, 43‚Äì44, 1996. *Pell's equation. The solution of the equation x2 ‚àí dy2 = 1, where x and y are unknown positive integers and where d is a known positive integer which is not a perfect square, is ascribed to John Pell. It seems to have been discovered by Fermat, who set it as a challenge problem in 1657. The first European solution is found in a joint work in 1658 by John Wallis and Lord Brouncker; in 1668, a shorter solution was given in an edition of a third mathematician's work by Pell; see ref. (reprint of fifth edition, 1891). The first rigorous proof may be due to Lagrange. The misnomer apparently came about when Euler confused Brouncker and Pell; see This is Whitford's 1912 Ph.D. dissertation, written at Columbia University and published at his own expense in 1912. for an extensive account of the history of this equation. *Poincar√© lemma. This was mentioned in 1886 by Henri Poincar√©, but was first proved in a series of 1889 papers by the distinguished Italian mathematician Vito Volterra. Nonetheless it has become known after Poincar√©. See for the twisted history of this lemma. *P√≥lya enumeration theorem. This was proven in 1927 in a difficult paper by J. H. Redfield. Despite the prominence of the venue (the American Journal of Mathematics), the paper was overlooked. Eventually, the theorem was independently rediscovered in 1936 by George P√≥lya. Not until 1960 did Frank Harary unearth the much earlier paper by Redfield. See for historical and other information. *Stokes' theorem. It is named after Sir George Gabriel Stokes (1819‚Äì1903), although the first known statement of the theorem is by William Thomson (Lord Kelvin) and appears in a letter of his to Stokes. The theorem acquired its name from Stokes' habit of including it in the Cambridge prize examinations. In 1854 he asked his students to prove the theorem in an examination; it is not known if anyone was able to do so. *Zorn's lemma is named for Max Zorn. Much work on the theorem now known as Zorn's lemma, and on several closely related formulations such as the Hausdorff maximal principle, was done between 1907 and 1940 by Zorn, Brouwer, Hausdorff, Kuratowski, R. L. Moore, and others. But the particular theorem now known as \\"Zorn's lemma\\" was never proved by Zorn, and in any event Zorn's results were anticipated by Kuratowski. The theorem was discovered by Chevalley in 1936, and published and attributed to Zorn by him in Bourbaki's Th√©orie des Ensembles in 1939. A very similar result was anticipated by S. Bochner in 1928.

She joined the revue in 1991, became the top star in 2002 and resigned from the company in 2007. She is from Komae, Tokyo, her birthday is December 15, 1972. Her nicknames are Osa and Masa-chan (as called by Jun Sena), both are from her real name Masako Osada (Èï∑Áî∞ÈõÖÂ≠ê Osada Masako). She is the first otokoyaku of her class to reach the top (followed by classmate and former troupe-mate Hikaru Asami by 3 months). Troupe History * Flower Troupe: 1991‚Äì2007 General information Following the examples of Mira Anju, Miki Maya and Mire Aika she became the top star of the troupe she had always been with, without any troupe transfer. (Although Hibiki Takumi had almost all her Takarazuka career in the Flower troupe, she had been in Senka for 2 years before she became the top star of the Troupe.) Also, another uniqueness of her career is that her status of being the second man was a short-lived one, because Hibiki Takumi became severely ill with myelitis during the Grand Theater performance. Haruno took over the leading role for the Tokyo performance, and at that point she unofficially became the top star of the troupe. However, it is Elisabeth that is considered as her official top star d√©but without top star overlap. With this production of Elisabeth, she is the first top star to perform as Der Tod as her d√©but. Considered as the traditional type of otokoyaku, she is praised as one of the best singers along with other legends like Asato Shizuki She was one of the promising young stars promoted by the company in 1999, along with Jun Sena, the current top star for Moon Troupe; Hikaru Asami, the former top star for Snow Troupe; Kei Takashiro, the former top star for Cosmo Troupe; Kei Aran, the current top star for Star Troupe, Natsuki Mizu, the current top star for Snow Troupe and Y≈´ga Yamato, the current top star for Cosmo Troupe. She is the only top star who has three top star partners (Rei Ootori, Miyo Fuzuki and Ayane Sakurano), which is quite rare in an otokoyaku's case. Even as a top star, she has maintained a good friendship with fellow stars (as well as former troupe-mates) such as Jun Sena, Hikaru Asami and Rira Maikaze. In 2006, she had special appearance in the Snow production of Rose of Versailles, this was the first performance with classmate and former troupe mate Hikaru Asami since the troupe transfer for Asami in 1998, and was also the last given the resignation of latter. She is the second star after Saki Asaji who has portrayed Der Tod from Elisabeth and Prince Rudolph from Mayerling, who was being attached to Der Tod in the previous musical. She wanted to be a musumeyaku when she first entered Takarazuka. This story related to her classmate and legend Mari Hanafusa: when Haruno went for the entrance exam of Takarazuka Music School, she saw another beautiful girl (Hanafusa) and thought about being a musumeyaku beside this beautiful girl.

The anime is technically based on the PlayStation game, even though the anime started airing before the game was officially released. Plot The Legend of Himiko is probably based on an ancient Japanese tale told in the Chinese history book Sanguo Zhi. The nation of Yamatai is under threat from the overseas kingdom of Kune (probably based on the nation of Kunekoku). In an attempt to stave off an invasion, the people of Yamatai attempt to install a Queen to rule over their kingdom, which is to be chosen by the mysterious Bokka. However, the Kune army attacks Yamatai before the selection of the Queen can be completed, and the Bokka disperse the six queen candidates across the nation. The Bokka themselves take shelter in a newborn girl named Himiko and the pendant she is wearing and transport her to modern times, where she is found by Masahiko Kutani. Several years in the future, Himiko and Kutani attend high school together. When the two are wandering around an archeological dig, Himiko's pendant activates, sending both back into ancient Japan where they are found by Imari, one of the queen candidates, and Iga within Kune's place in Yamatai, three years after Kune's initial attack. Both Himiko and Kutani learn about the Bokka and what relationship they have with it. The six queen candidates also finally all join back together, for the first time since they were dispersed when Kune first attacked. They eventually fight against Shikara, the governor-general of Yamatai and the son of the king of Kune, in order to free Yamatai from Kune's rule.

Background Hainan Island lies midway between French Indochina and Hong Kong, occupying a position south of the Leizhou Peninsula across the Strait of Hainan. It is also near Kwangchowan, a French-leased territory on the southern coast of China. The 33,920 km2 (13,100 sq mi) Hainan Island had a population of 2,200,000 at the time. The island was guarded by the 152nd Division, approximately 25,000 strong, under the command of Yu Hanmou, who was in charge of peace preservation in Kwangtung Province. The Japanese Navy, after the capture of Canton (Guangzhou) the previous year, had maintained a formidable blockade all along the coast of south, central and north China. However, loopholes were found in the southern end of the blockade line. These included the supply route to Chiang Kai-shek with Hong Kong and Northern French Indo- China as relay points and the direct routes through Hainan Island and Kwangchowan areas. Because of these loopholes, as well as the necessity to conduct air operations deep into the interior as far as the Kunming area, the Japanese Navy came to feel the necessity for establishing air bases on Hainan Island. The Central Authorities of the Navy advocated this move. Operations were carried out by the Special Naval Landing Forces with Army elements supporting them. Operation Escorting a convoy, the South China Naval Force (Fifth Fleet) commanded by Vice Admiral Kondo Nobutake entered and anchored in Tsinghai Bay on the northern shore of Hainan Island at midnight on 9 February 1939 and carried out a successful landing. In addition, Navy land combat units effected a landing at Haikou at 1200 on 10 February. Thereafter, the Army and Navy forces acted in concert to mop up the northern zone. On 11 February the land combat units landed at Samah (Sanya) at the southern extremity of Hainan Island and occupied the key positions of Yulin and Yai-Hsien. Thereafter, the units engaged in the occupation and subjugation of the entire island. The Communists under Feng Baiju and the native Li people of Hainan fought a vigorous guerrilla campaign against the Japanese occupation, the Japanese killed large numbers of Li in western Hainan (eg. Sanya, Danzhou). Furthermore, numerous foreign slave labourers were also killed. There are mass graves of tens of thousands of Korean slave labourers in Sanya and throughout the island. Of the 100,000 slave labourers from Hong Kong only 20,000 survived the war. Occupation Later, Hainan Island became a naval administrative district with Hainan Guard District Headquarters established at Samah. Strategically, the island was built as a forward air base as well as an advance base for blockading Chiang. At the same time, the iron and copper resources of the island were exploited. Control of Hainan Island provided a base of operations for the invasion of Guangdong province and French Indochina, as well as providing airbases that permitted long-distance air raids of routes into China from French Indochina and Burma. The Occupation of Hainan lasted until the Surrender of Japan in September 1945.

She also served other types of duty, such as that of dispatch vessel and convoy escort.  Built in West Virginia in 1862  The first ship to be named Signal by the Navy‚Äîa wooden-hulled, stern-wheel steamer built in 1862 at Wheeling, Virginia (now West Virginia)‚Äîwas purchased by the U.S. Navy on 22 September 1862 at Saint Louis, Missouri.  Civil War service  = Mississippi River operations = Although no record of her commissioning has been found, it is known that she was in operation on 22 October 1862, when she departed Carondelet, Missouri and headed down the Mississippi River to join in the campaign against the Confederate river fortress at Vicksburg, Mississippi. Acting Volunteer Lieutenant John Scott was mentioned as her commanding officer in an order issued on 14 November and presumably commanded the ship from the start of her service. Signal's first weeks were devoted to duty as a dispatch vessel. On 29 November, she and Marmora entered the Yazoo River on a reconnaissance expedition and ascended that stream some 21 miles. From time to time, riflemen fired upon the ships from the river banks; but, in each instance, the ships shelled and dispersed the attackers. That afternoon, the ships returned to the Mississippi unharmed. = Yazoo River operations = Signal's work for the day steaming up and down shallow, winding streams in hostile territory was a sample of the service she would perform throughout her career. She and Marmora again ascended the Yazoo on 11 December to obtain information needed for a projected joint Army-Navy expedition in that area to outflank Vicksburg, Mississippi. They discovered Confederates had placed torpedoes (mines) in the channel and returned to report and to volunteer to destroy the explosive devices. The next morning, accompanied by , , and , they returned up the Yazoo to destroy the \\"infernal machines.\\" During this early mine sweeping operation, one of the torpedoes exploded under Cairo, and she sank 12 minutes later. Cairo was the first of over 40 Union ships to be torpedoed during the Civil War. The expedition returned to the Mississippi after dark that evening bringing the survivors from Cairo. = Operations on the White River = On 4 January 1863, Signal got underway in an expedition up the White River to attack Fort Hindman, which surrendered on the 11th, after a three-day battle. About a month later, Signal made a reconnaissance up the White River and brought back information of the military situation at Little Rock, Arkansas. Late in February, Signal returned to the Yazoo and devoted most of her time probing that stream until Vicksburg fell on 4 July. = Return to Mississippi patrolling = Steamer Henry Von Phul During the ensuing months, Signal served as a dispatch vessel and patrolled the Mississippi to interdict Confederate commerce especially from the Red River. On 8 December 1863, Signal and defended disabled merchant steamer Henry Von Phul, which had been shelled by a Southern shore battery. On 19 April 1864, Signal was ordered to ascend the Red River to Alexandria, Louisiana to protect coal and provision barges waiting there for the use of the flotilla of gunboats Rear Admiral David D. Porter had led farther upstream in the campaign known as the Red River Expedition. On 4 May, Signal was ordered \\"to take on board a bearer of dispatches from Mayor General Nathaniel Prentice Banks and proceed down the river...\\" About 20 miles down stream, the ship was fired upon by Confederate cavalrymen, and she returned the fire with her starboard guns. The engagement continued intermittently until she reached and Army transport John Warner some four more miles below. = Signal burns and crew is captured = USS Signal Signal rounded to and made fast to the stern of Covington, and both ships continued to engage the Confederates throughout the day and night. At daylight, the three ships got underway; but, upon rounding Dunn's Bayou, John Warner's whistle signaled \\"enemy in sight.\\" Artillery and small arms fire soon disabled the transport which drifted ashore blocking the channel below the gunboats. In the ensuing battle, Signal was disabled and ran aground where she was reluctantly set afire and abandoned by her crew which was captured ashore. The two other ships were also lost. However, most of the crew of Covington, along with Covington's captain, managed to escape and make its way back to safety at Alexandria, Louisiana. = Fate of the crew = Signal's captured crew was held at the Camp Ford prisoner of war camp near Tyler, Texas. The prisoner exchange lists show thirty-nine men from this vessel as being exchanged from this camp. Six of the crew members, Quarter Gunner Charles Asten, Gunner's Mate George Butts, Seaman John Hyland, Seaman Timothy O'Donoghue, Boatswain's Mate Michael McCormick, and Pilot Perry Wilkes, were awarded the Medal of Honor for their conduct during the ship's final engagement on the Red River.

It was first performed on 2 April of that year and first published in the October number of Samhain. Lady Gregory wrote the naturalistic peasant dialogue of the Gillane family, while Yeats wrote Cathleen Ni Houlihan‚Äôs dialogue. Maude Gonne portrayed Cathleen ni Houlihan in the play's first performances at the Abbey Theatre. The play centres on the 1798 Rebellion. The play is startlingly nationalistic, in its last pages encouraging young men to sacrifice their lives for the heroine Cathleen ni Houlihan, who represents an independent and separate Irish state. The title character first appears as an old woman at the door of a family celebrating their son's wedding. She describes her four \\"beautiful green fields,\\" representing the four provinces, that have been unjustly taken from her. With little subtlety, she requests a blood sacrifice, declaring that \\"many a child will be born and there will be no father at the christening\\". When the youth agrees and leaves the safety of his home to fight for her, she appears as an image of youth with \\"the walk of a queen,\\" professing of those who fight for her: \\"They shall be remembered forever, They shall be alive forever, They shall be speaking forever, The people shall hear them forever.\\"W. B. Yeats, Nine One-Act Plays (1937), p. 36. The premiere of Cathleen Ni Houlihan initially confused Dublin audiences who had expected a comedic play due to the actor Willie Fay‚Äôs prior association with comedies. However, Gonne's reputation as an ardent nationalist helped them to understand the ‚Äútragic meaning‚Äù of her role, as described by Yeats. By the third night the theatre was so crowded that customers had to be turned away. Yeats later expressed reservations about the play's nationalistic rhetoric of blood sacrifice, asking in a later poem, \\"The Man and the Echo,\\" \\"Did that play of mine send out / Certain men the English shot?\\"  Characters  Peter Gillane, a farmer Michael Gillane, his eldest son Patrick Gillane, his youngest son Bridget Gillane, Peter‚Äôs wife Delia Cahel, Michael‚Äôs fianc√©e The Poor Old Woman / Cathleen Ni Houlihan Neighbours  Synopsis  The play is set in Killala in 1798. The Gillane family are discussing the upcoming marriage between their son Michael and his fianc√©e Delia. Peter and Bridget are concerned with obtaining Delia‚Äôs dowry. They hear cheering outside but are unconcerned with its cause. Michael enters and tells his parents that he has visited the priest to arrange the wedding ceremony for the following day. He gives the dowry to his parents. The family is visited by a mysterious old woman. She tells them that her \\"four beautiful green fields\\" have been stolen from her. She sings about patriots who have died for Ireland and reveals herself as Cathleen Ni Houlihan. She tells them that many men have died for her and that more must make sacrifices in order to help her regain her fields and banish the strangers who stole them. Neighbours enter the house and Patrick tells his family that the French ships have landed at Killala bay. The 1798 Rebellion is taking place. Michael is enchanted by Cathleen's words and vows to join the French army, abandoning his parents and his fianc√©e despite their pleas. Cathleen leaves, saying that \\"They shall be speaking for ever, / The people shall hear them forever.\\" Peter asks his son Patrick if he saw an old woman leaving, but Patrick tells him that he saw a young girl who had \\"the walk of a queen.\\"  Themes  The play has themes of nationalism and blood sacrifice. Colm T√≥ib√≠n describes Michael as an \\"idealistic, inspirational\\" male hero in the tradition of Lady Gregory's plays The Rising of the Moon and Gaol Gate, and the Irish mythological hero Cuchulainn, because he is willing to sacrifice his life for his newfound nationalistic beliefs, unaffected by the \\"land- hunger\\" which occupies his family. Susan Cannon Harris contrasts the play's depiction of the \\"male patriot\\" who makes a blood sacrifice which \\"symbolically regenerates\\" Ireland, with the female peasant characters who face the arduous tasks of economic reality which make this regeneration possible. Michael abandons the everyday concerns of dowries, wedding clothes and land purchases in order to follow Cathleen and give up his life for the nationalist cause. Cannon Harris describes the significance of Maud Gonne's performance as Cathleen Ni Houlihan in expressing the play's nationalist themes. Gonne's reputation as a nationalist campaigner and public speaker added to the play's popular appeal. Her disguise as an elderly woman illustrates that the Poor Old Woman is only a veneer who conceals the \\"uncorrupted essence\\" of Irish freedom. Nicholas Grene examines the trope of \\"strangers in the house\\" which is used in different contexts throughout the play. The British invaders have stolen Cathleen Ni Houlihan's land and exiled her, forcing her to wander the roads in search of help. The French invaders are seen as \\"necessary catalysts\\" for the banishment of the British, while Cathleen herself is a disrupting presence when she visits the Gillane family's home and presents them with a past vision of Irish independence which could be achieved in future.

The wooden boy magically brought to life in the story by Carlo Collodi, he was among those Fables who fled to the mundane world and formed a community in New York City. Personality The readers first see Pinocchio during the Remembrance Day gala scene in \\"Legends in Exile,\\" where he reveals to a fellow Fable that he is angry at the Blue Fairy for granting his wish to be a real boy in such a way that he would never grow up into a man. He is over three hundred years old but hasn't hit puberty. He attends the celebration every year in the hopes that she will show up so that he can finally give her a piece of his mind (and boot). Appearance Pinocchio is always shown as a very short person with short dark hair, but other specifics of his appearance vary depending on the artist. In \\"A Wolf in the Fold\\" and \\"Around the Town,\\" he is drawn as a typical prepubescent child with a slender frame and a receding chin, but most other chapters show him with thick shoulders, a square jaw and a heavy brow. Nevertheless, in \\"A Two-Part Caper,\\" Bigby describes Pinocchio as looking like a little boy. Mark Buckingham, one of the primary artists on the series, draws Pinocchio with a jutting lower lip and, even when speaking, always with his mouth closed; Buckingham depicts all wooden characters in this same way. Character history =Pinocchio and Geppetto= In \\"March of the Wooden Soldiers,\\" Pinocchio realizes that his father Geppetto must still be alive. He concludes that he has been enslaved by the Adversary and forced to carve wooden armies for him. Pinocchio wishes to return to the Homelands to find his father, but is beheaded during the Battle of Fabletown, reverting immediately to his original wooden form. He is later carried back to the Homelands by his friend Boy Blue and restored to life by Geppetto, who turns out to be the Adversary himself. As Boy Blue escapes Geppetto's clutches, he offers Pinocchio a chance to return to Fabletown. Pinocchio, very confused, opts to stay with his father, possibly because of the loyalty geas Geppetto had placed on him. As such, despite any misgivings that he might have, Pinocchio becomes unable to act against his father's interests. During an incursion by Bigby Wolf, it is revealed Pinocchio is also protected magically against multiple forms of harm. An explosion only served to confuse him. =The imperial conference= In \\"Sons of Empire,\\" Pinocchio attends the imperial conference with his father, where he is expected to provide details of Fabletown's population and defenses, having been a longtime resident. When the Snow Queen describes an apocalyptic plans for dealing with the mundane world: a series of plagues, fires and then a three-year winter to wipe out the mundy civilization and reduce any survivors to barbarism, Pinocchio is appalled. After a discussion with Sir Rodney Greenwood, he finds himself in the position of having to make a counter-proposal. He responds by saying that an attack of that magnitude would prompt Fabletown to reveal its existence to the mundys (mundane peoples), would be so angry at the Empire's use of biological weapons that they would immediately unite with Fabletown and with each other, using their combined infrastructure and technology to invade the Homelands using magic, automatic weapons and fighter jets. As such, Geppetto decides that the Snow Queen's three-year plan will not work. The others believe Pinocchio, for he is magically compelled to only have the Adversary's best interests at heart. Secretly, Geppetto tells the Snow Queen that they must wipe out Fabletown without first attacking the mundys. =\\"War and Pieces\\"= Pinocchio later escapes from the Imperial homeworld and makes it to Fabletown, where he negotiates a deal to end the war with the Empire. The terms of the deal are that Pinocchio would reveal the location of five hidden gates to the Fables and, in exchange, Geppetto would be allowed to sign the Fabletown Compact and offered the same general amnesty for past deeds as Bigby and Frau Totenkinder. Pinocchio is able to seemingly go against Geppetto's wishes and ally with his father's enemies because he believes himself to be acting in Geppetto's best interests. Attempting to cheer his father up, Pinocchio finds an old set of wooden soldiers Geppetto had worked on centuries before and gives them to his father as a present. Geppetto is pleased and Pinocchio is happy that he's helped his father, unaware that the soldiers are alive and Geppetto plans to use them as his spies.

It is native to western Asia and southeastern Europe and widely introduced elsewhere. Description Whitetop Whitetop is a perennial herb that reproduces by seeds and by horizontal creeping roots. The stem is stoutish, erect or spreading, 10 to 80 cm tall, branched, covered sparsely with ash-colored soft hairs to heavily covered. The leaves are alternating, simple, and mostly toothed. The basal leaves are 4 to 10 cm, have a slight stem (petiole), and are long and flat, lance-shaped to egg-shaped, with the narrow end attached to the stalk. On the upper part of the stem the leaves are attached directly to the stalk (sessile), are 2 to 6.5 cm long, and are oblong or tapering the point, with broad bases that clasp the stalk. Whitetop has slightly domed flower clusters in which the individual flower stalks grow upward from various points off the branch to approximately the same height (corymb-like). The petals are white, clawed, and 3 to 5 mm long, about twice the length of the sepals. Distribution It is native to western Asia and southeastern Europe and is an invasive species in North America, introduced by contaminated seeds in the early 1900s. Also known as Cardaria draba, hoary cress is a weed in much of south-east and south-west Australia as well. =Distribution in United States= left References External links *Species Profile - Whitetop (Lepidium draba), National Invasive Species Information Center, United States National Agricultural Library.

However, the Alfred E. Smith Building surpassed it the following year. That building has since been surpassed by the Erastus Corning Tower, which since its construction in 1973 has held the title of Albany's tallest building. Nevertheless, the Home Savings Bank Building has remained the tallest private building in Albany since its construction. The building features unusual stylized Art Deco images of Native Americans and colonial settlers near its roof and ground-floor street entrance. The artwork of unique decorative metal and terra cotta is by Rene Paul Chambellan. Also of architectural note is the original street-level banking floor with its various historic seals, rich marble walls and incredibly high ceilings. In recent years, the building has been extensively renovated as a combination downtown central business district office building and high tech telecommunications facility. As of 2010, the bank lobby is being leased to a formal event catering company, who uses the facility for banquets and wedding receptions. In 1980, when the Downtown Albany Historic District was listed on the National Register of Historic Places, the building was included as a contributing property. As of 2010, the Home Savings bank building was owned by New York City-based Heights Real Estate Company.

Lumley has reinterpreted the traditional vampire legend. In his stories, a vampire is a leech-like parasite from an alien world which forms a symbiotic relationship with a host creature, usually a human or sometimes a canine such as a wolf or fox (werewolf). While the symbiosis puts great demands on the host (such as requiring to feed on blood to survive), the benefits include increased strength, speed, and resilience, a seemingly infinite lifespan that stretches into millennia, magnified senses, base emotional stimulation, access to latent psychic power such as ESP or telepathy, metamorphic flesh allowing flight or disguise, and certain narcotic effects. The vampires in the story have great control over people who are weak-minded, and could easily dominate the Earth if allowed to achieve their full potential. They also have the ability to produce lesser breeds of vampires for different purposes. Life cycle The vampiric leech begins its original life cycle as a fungus similar to a mushroom, formed from the decomposed flesh and fats of a deceased vampire. When a suitable host is detected (the ‚Äòmushrooms‚Äô seem to have some form of awareness), the caps burst open, releasing a cloud of spores that are inhaled (or otherwise absorbed) by the victim. The transformation is slow, as the spores must first adapt the body to suit the growth of a leech. The only other means of infection are from direct transmission or bodily fluids from a vampire (usually sex or biting), or by absorbing a leech‚Äôs egg, and becoming a full-blown \\"eggson\\" (or ‚Äìdaughter), or to be born the BloodSon/BloodDaughter of a vampire. The process is slow, and the actual time between infection and full-blown vampirism varies greatly from host to host. Early symptoms include an aversion to light, red tinting of the eyes, a propensity for rare or uncooked meat, as well as developing allergies to silver and garlic. When the body has grown enough to undergo the first change, or if the infecting vampire has personally seen to their becoming infected (via bite or sex), the host enters a catatonic ‚Äòdeath‚Äô state. They awaken a thrall, and are psychically bound to their creators. This stage is skipped by Egg children, blood Children, and spore transformed, though in the case of egg children they often lose consciousness for a few hours due to the pain of the egg merging with their internal physiology. This becomes the first stage of vampirism. Thralls possess enhanced speed, strength, and agility, but require more feeding than full-grown vampires. Typically though weak for vampires, thralls are significantly stronger and with greater stamina than when they were human. Some thralls possess other abilities, usually ones characterized in their masters. Thralls are also psychically slaved to their creators. Vampires who are spore created or Bloodsons/daughters or are created with an egg skip this phase and go directly to full fledge ‚Äú-son‚Äù stage. At this point, the vampire takes one of two paths. It either ascends into a Lieutenant, or stops developing and remains as a thrall. This is usually based on the predilection of their master, and the strength of the host. Should it ascend then it will find life much longer and easier in general than general thralls do. Occasionally it occurs that a vampire either during early infection, or through deliberate and intense self- control during intercourse, fathers mostly human children, however these children typically do have either esp, vampiric mindsets, or both. There are two known cases of vampires fathering mostly human offspring in the Lumley novels, one was Faether Ferenczy fathering Janos, who at least in his early years was human but with strong esp and a vampires lusts and amorality, and Jasef an old seer in the tribe of the Szagany Lidesci, whose father had been recently vampirized but hadn't yet shown symptoms. Stages of Vampirism Lesser vampiric creatures. Wamphyrii are well known for creating, either deliberately or by accident, lesser vampiric creatures. These include Siphoneers, flyers, warriors, werewolves, gas beasts, and multiple other types of creature. These creatures are sometimes accidents where a vampire attempts to feed on an animal and it escapes, or an animal becomes infected by spores, a leech, or an egg, and at other times they are deliberate acts of breeding a creature for a specific purpose. Thralls. Thralls are the lowest form of humanoid vampire. While faster, stronger, and harder to kill than humans they pale in comparison to later types. These are the cannon fodder of Wamphyrii wars, often newly created. Their powers are generally limited, unless bred specifically for a task (such as being a telepathic watchman) in which case they might have significant abilities in the areas related to that task. Lieutenants. The next phase are vampire Lieutenants, who are basically vampire thralls with increased attributes and abilities. Lieutenants often put on mass similarly to, though not as extensively as, lords do. Additionally, their lifespans extend far beyond those of generic thralls, often extending into Centuries. They are stronger, larger, heal better, and live much longer. In some cases a Lieutenant can even develop into full Wamphyri without any further infusion (such as an egg) if allowed long enough (usually centuries). Eggson's/Eggdaughters. - Egg transformed offspring typically pass out when the egg is infused. They skip the thrall stage, as well as lieutenant stage and go to being full-blown Wamphyrii, though not quite lords/ladies in their own right quickly, sometimes in a matter of days. They add on mass rapidly, as well as fully developing powers much more quickly than other means of transformation. They are prone to rapid development though the precise speed is variable, ranging from days to a few months or years for full transformation and final form to settle in. Bloodsons/Blooddaughters. - These are born vampires, as such there is, as a rule, no transformation period, though their development is often slower than that of eggchildren in terms of powers. This is largely due to having to mature as opposed to being \\"born\\" with an already mature host. They are often weaker than egg children. Additionally, in some cases such as that of Janos Ferenczy, it is shown that powerful sires can control, at least to an extent, how much vampirism infects them. Lords and Ladies. The most powerful of vampires are known as Lords and Ladies, and are referred to as true ‚ÄúWamphyri.‚Äù They possess a wide range of abilities: enhanced transformational skills, psychic powers, extreme physical prowess, and a host of other skills. They have fully adult Leeches. They have exaggerated effects from sunlight, garlic and silver, but are more capable of recovery (unless the leech itself is damaged). These are truly monstrous creatures. Vampire leeches produce only a single egg in their lifetime, except for \\"mothers,\\" who are highly feared due to their ability to produce a prodigious number of eggs and thus create many true eggsons/daughters to compete with the existing Wamphyri. However, becoming a \\"mother\\" is also a highly feared phenomenon, because the leeches of \\"mothers\\" (according to the legend of the one vampire \\"Mother\\") produce eggs until the vampire was drained to a lifeless husk. Unless the leech is fully destroyed, the vampire remains immortal, and can regenerate itself multiple times, although the regeneration process from grievous injuries leaves the creature more vampire than humanoid. The leech itself is a snake-like creature, resembling a shovel-headed worm with fangs and no eyes. If fed, the leech can survive without a host, but lacks high-level intelligence. Leeches can leave doomed hosts (only in extremely dire situations) and seek new hosts, including animals, but animals can only be vampirized so long before they die. Vampire powers Vampires in Lumley's work enjoy a number of superhuman abilities. The specifics vary from vampire to vampire, but as a rule, the higher in vampire society or evolution, the more powerful a vampire becomes. Age also brings greater skill in use of the powers they possess as a rule. Some of the powers vampires possess in the world Lumley created are as follows: Longevity Superhuman strength Superior healing Hypnosis/Mesmerism Telepathy Empathy Prognostication/Oneiromancy Necromancy Scrying (locating) The ability to conjure a mist to hide Metamorphosis for fighting or flight Evil eye It is not uncommon for lords and ladies to specifically breed certain thralls, or shape their transformation, for specific powers such as telepathy. However, the mutation caused by vampirism is not entirely controllable even by the greatest Wamphyri. This fact leaves a certain element of chance to what the end result may be. Secondary Vampire Creatures Warriors. Created by the Wamphyrii as their primary battle creatures warriors can best be summed up as living flying biological tanks. Rivalling small tanks in size, built with armored hides for war, and the ability to fly through the use of gas bladders and exhausts these creatures are armed with pincers, claws, mandibles, and every possible biological tool to inflict carnage at their lords command. Warriors typically eat raw meat and have very limited intellect. Flyers. Flyers are aerofoil, manta like flying beasts that the Olden and Turgosheim Wamphyrii breed as a means of transportation for themselves and their troops. While Flyers are typically lightly armored at most there have been exceptions which were more heavily armored and even armed. Even these armed flyers are no match for even small warriors though. Flyers, as a rule, are mostly fed vegetable matter. Siphoneers. Used to transport water from the wells in the Aeries of starside lords and run it through pipes throughout the aerie. Gas Beasts. Gas beasts are used to create heat and light for the aeries, being fed grains and bred to generate massive amounts of methane, they are the fuel that lights and warms the Aerie's of starside. Werewolves. Infected foxes and wolves can shapeshift, assuming a somewhat human appearance to lure human prey, however, despite carrying leeches and eggs, they are not true Wamphyrii. They have cunning but not sapient intelligence, and as such are a lesser form of vampiric creature. When deliberately bred these creatures are in general bred within certain \\"rules\\" of Vampire society. Limits on intelligence, size, etc. are commonplace, due to raw materials, the prevention of an uncontrolled arms race, and also the wisdom of not bringing anything into the world which you cannot put down. While the rules are rarely broken it should be noticed that occasionally they are, with results often being horrific even by the most grotesque of standards. Identifying a Vampire Thralls and vampires can pass for humans if their appearance is unaltered. Here are the most obvious signs of an infected person: * Aversion to sunlight, garlic and silver. * Eating raw or extremely rare meats in large quantities. * Red or yellow eyes. In some cases, the eyes also glow. * Exaggerated jaw lines, and pointed teeth, especially canines. * Cold, clammy skin. Psychics can identify infected persons of any stage by a thing known as \\"mindsmog.\\" This clouds the vampire's mind, and makes their thoughts unreadable in most cases. Vampire Diet The mainstay of the Wamphyri diet is blood, however, all vampires are omnivores to some extent or another. Specifics of diet vary from faction to faction and individual to individual based on tastes, faction, and circumstances. There are three different \\"factions\\" of Wamphyri, each adhering to different general dietary standards though. See vampire society's section below for further discussion. Vampire Diseases Leprosy - the hundred years death. Leprosy is particularly feared by vampires as it is typically a slow, but unavoidable death by depletion. Infected vampires can, in some cases, take centuries to die from it, growing ever weaker and more ostracized as they do. Bubonic Plague - As seen in the Jake Cutter trilogy, and in Necroscope the Lost Years, bubonic plague is also known to be lethal to vampires, though slower than how it progresses in humans. Other possible infections - It is possible, though unconfirmed, that other diseases could infect a vampire. Given their healing ability though such diseases would need to be particularly virulent and resistant to immune response, potentially including syphilis, AIDS, and the common cold, though in the latter case the vampire could easily compensate by simply causing the release of additional hormones. Agromaly - Uncontrolled growth, either in general such as with Fess Ferenc, or in specific body parts, such as with Vasagi the Suck before he tore out his jaw and formed his proboscis, is a common \\"defect\\" amongst the Wamphyri. Uncontrolled metamorphosis - While rare some vampires over time lose control of their metamorphosis, this condition is not fatal directly but can reduce a vampire so afflicted to a blob like creature with little or no skeletal structure, and unable to pass for human or beast. This makes the afflicted vampire uniquely vulnerable, and complicated feeding for it. Dwarfism - while rare amongst the Wamphyri it is not unheard of for some lords, especially those descended from trog Wamphyri, to be far shorter than average. While they would still be average height for a man, they would, among Wamphyri, have to be considered dwarf. Bestial traits - Some Wamphyri, without being lycanthropes, show extreme signs of bestial traits such as bat like ears or muzzles like wolves. This may be due to distant ancestry from an infected animal, or simply due to the leech adapting features its host considers beneficial or desirable. Lycanthropy - Vampires really have two types of lycanthropy in Lumley's world. The first type, an infected wolf or fox, is discussed under lesser vampiric creatures. A true lycanthrope Wamphyri is a humanoid vampire whose sire - either by blood, egg, or bite, was an infected wolf/fox, or was descended from one. Examples of this include Radu Lycan, Canker Canison, and their thralls and lieutenants. Wamphyrii societies =Olden Wamphyri= Olden Wamphyri diet consists of blood and human flesh in copious amounts. For dining and the entertaining of another Lord or Lady, roasted quail, wolf, or smoked hearts, and the occasional small child roasted over an open spit are considered a delicacy and looked upon highly. Additionally, the Wamphyri diet includes normal human fare, such as fruits, honey, and wine. The Olden Wamphyrii are mostly in control of their world, having cowed MOST of the szagany (gypsy) human population. However, some tribes, such as the Szagany Lidesci, fought back fiercely, even killing some Lieutenants and lords on occasion so their rule was not entirely unchallenged. =Zolteist Wamphyri= Zolteist Wamphyri out of Turgosheim, allot themselves human flesh and blood on an equal basis, a \\"tithe system,\\" the equality of which is based on social stature. Standard fare is more typical to be roasted wolf, or other animals, cooked in its own blood along with honey, fruits, grains, and wine. Blood and flesh are considered a delicacy as they strive to maintain a modicum of their former, more human, selves. Zolteist Wamphyrii had completely cowed the szagany in their region into subservience to the tithe system and as such did not have to hunt at all anymore. =Earth Born Wamphyri= Earth Born Wamphyri are descended from the banished lords/ladies of starside, as such they philosophically resemble the Olden Wamphyrii, but have lost much of their \\"history\\" and are far more solitary owing to the more vulnerable status of Wamphyrii on earth due to shorter days and higher levels of technology among humans. Blood and human flesh are the preferred food, but taken in secrecy and thus in some degree of moderation, as the earth vampires never had the numbers to take control of humanity in the way the Olden Wamphyrii did in Starside. As even the strongest castles owned by any earth vampire than a starside lords aerie is (not least because of the shorter nights) earth vampires were forced to learn that secrecy and longevity were inescapably intertwined. Vampire Habitat Whether in starside or on earth the Wamphyrii seek luxurious, and fortified, homes. Seeking this for safety from enemies as well as the luxuries provide the key difference lies in extent. Starside Vampires reside in Aeries which are built to the maximum size and impressiveness the Lord can support, on Earth Vampires live in castles and/or mansions, but tend to favor small fortresses which are difficult to attack but draw less attention as opposed to lavish palaces. Castles - Earth vampires tend to prefer small castles and fortresses in isolated mountain ranges. Tibet, Romania, Russia, Greece, Sicily, Australia. Invariably these are built in isolated areas, with heavily fortified defenses. This serves the purposes of remaining relatively anonymous, as well as maintaining defenses. Additionally by building into the sides of mountains and cliffs it assists Wamphyrii in attaining flight in the event that they need to retreat swiftly from their home. Aeries - Starside vampires in ancient history began construction of the Aeries of starside. These natural castles were much larger, and built over generations, using both natural and metamorphic construction. Using various creatures in the maintenance of these giant stacks, they were large beyond the concept of even the most ambitious human structures on earth. Their vast labyrinths and structures supported hundreds, perhaps thousands of thralls at any give time as well as lieutenants and the Wamphyrii themselves and all their myriad beasts. Vampire Psychology Wamphyrii psychology is based around a combination of their intensified emotional states and fear. As a predatory species they are without doubt apex predators, but seldom social with equals, and therefore constantly fearful of anyone they consider a threat. This results in various behaviors, depending on circumstances, ranging from murdering threats, to hiding their nature, to avoidance or others of their own kind except for slaves, and even in many cases to not even being able to trust their own slaves. Lesser vampires also are frequently ambitious to rise in rank, partly out of lust for power, but also partly from desire to be less subject to the abuse higher ranking vampires heap on lesser. Vampire society rather resembles the pack structure of wild social predators. Needing social interaction, but also within rigid structures of control and dominance, and fearful of rivals. Some members of the Wamphyrii, especially early on, strive to maintain as much of their humanity as possible. While this usually does not last, it is possible, if one's will is strong enough, to control the vampire urges to a remarkable degree. Examples of this include Turgo Zolte, The Dweller, Harry Keogh, and others. Vampires in Lumley's novels are most often bisexual to some extent and frequently engage in various forms of incest and abuse with their offspring either by blood or by egg. Among Wamphyrii culture, the most desired treat is to eat another vampire's leech, or drink the blood of another vampire, so cannibalism is also common. Killing a vampire The only sure ways to kill a vampire are beheading or complete immolation, a combination of the two being most desirable. Given enough time starvation or suffocation MAY also kill a vampire. Vampires can be killed with normal means such as gunfire, but the level of violence required is several orders of magnitude greater than for a human, additionally in such cases, the leech can often still escape from the host. * Silver causes a paralytic effect on vampires, and can leave burn-like wounds and scars. * Garlic causes tremendous nausea, inflammation of infected areas, and debilitating illness, especially if ingested or absorbed. * Sunlight causes explosive immolation to the affected body parts. * Fire is a powerful tool, as vampiric flesh is noticeably weak against it. * Piercing the leech with a some sort of object, often a wooden stake, will trap the vampire until the offending object is removed. Vampires are especially susceptible to leprosy, and it is one of only two known mortal conditions capable of killing a vampire (of any stage), the other being the black death which affected Radu Lykan, one of the first Wamphryi. Vampiric flesh is eaten by leprosy at a nearly visible pace, and once the Leech is infected, death is assured. It is a very slow and painful way to die. Even after immolation, vampire ashes are still dangerous. Strong Wamphyri maintain their psychic powers to some degree after death, and if enough of the vampire's body remain in the soil, the vampire can eventually be reborn in the fungus stage, with consciousness intact. Vampirism is highly infectious, and even small touches can eventually cause conversion. In the case of Lady Karen, if denied sustenance long enough, the Leech may make a desperate bid for survival and flee the human host, leaving them in a mostly human state (presumably, if the leech fled a host in a transformed or mutated form, the host would stay in that form). The loss of the leech and the enhanced emotional states it provided can cause extreme psychological damage, and a grave feeling of weakness, emptiness and inferiority. The exact lifespan of a leech-less vampire is unknown. There is also the exceptional case of Vasagi the Suck, whose leech was killed but he survived, taking on a mutated form much akin to his dead leech.

Although it is a privately owned office tower, much of the building is occupied by New York State government offices. Its lobby features several restaurants. One Commerce Plaza was completed in 1971 and was designed by Julius Tauss in the Modernist style. It originally had a black glass and white marble exterior. For a few years in the 2000s, the building was draped in white plastic sheathing. This preceded an exterior renovation, when the marble panels of the original facade were replaced with metal composite ones because the marble was too thick for exterior use. On April 30, 2007, a chunk of marble fell off One Commerce Plaza, injuring three people. It was reported that high wind gusts were responsible for the chunk letting loose from the building, which was under renovation at the time.

Fighting lasted from 22 to 26 September 1940, simultaneous with the Battle of South Guangxi in the Sino-Japanese War. The main objective of the Japanese was to prevent China from importing arms and fuel through French Indochina along the Kunming‚ÄìHai Phong Railway, from the Indochinese port of Haiphong, through the capital of Hanoi to the Chinese city of Kunming in Yunnan.Jean-Philippe Liardet, L'Indochine fran√ßaise pendant la Seconde Guerre mondiale Although an agreement had been reached between the French and Japanese governments prior to the outbreak of fighting, authorities were unable to control events on the ground for several days before the troops stood down. Per the prior agreement, Japan was allowed to occupy Tonkin in northern Indochina and effectively blockade China. Background In early 1940, troops of the Imperial Japanese Army (IJA) moved to seize southern Guangxi and Longzhou County, where the eastern branch of the Kunming‚ÄìHai Phong Railway reached the border at the Friendship Pass in Pingxiang. They also tried to move west to cut the rail line to Kunming. The railway from Indochina was the Chinese government's last secure overland link to the outside world. On 10 May 1940, Germany invaded France. On 22 June, France signed an armistice with Germany (in effect from 25 June). On 10 July, the French parliament voted full powers to Marshal Philippe P√©tain, effectively abrogating the Third Republic. Although much of metropolitan France came under German occupation, the French colonies remained under the direction of P√©tain's government at Vichy. Resistance to P√©tain and the armistice began even before it was signed, with Charles de Gaulle's appeal of 18 June. As a result, a de facto government-in-exile in opposition to P√©tain, called Free France, was formed in London. Franco-Japanese negotiations On 19 June, Japan took advantage of the defeat of France and the impending armistice to present the Governor- General of Indochina, Georges Catroux, with a request, in fact an ultimatum, demanding the closure of all supply routes to China and the admission of a 40-man Japanese inspection team under General Issaku Nishihara. The Americans became aware of the true nature of the Japanese \\"request\\" through intelligence intercepts, since the Japanese had informed their German allies. Catroux initially responded by warning the Japanese that their unspecified \\"other measures\\" would be a breach of sovereignty. He was reluctant to acquiesce to the Japanese, but with his intelligence reporting that Japanese army and navy units were moving into threatening positions, the French government was not prepared for a protracted defense of the colony.Gunn (2014), pp. 38‚Äì40. Therefore, Catroux complied with the Japanese ultimatum on 20 June.Boissarie (2015), 233‚Äì34. Before the end of June the last train carrying munitions crossed the border bound for Kunming. Following this humiliation, Catroux was immediately replaced as governor-general by Admiral Jean Decoux. He did not return to France, however, but to London.Boissarie (2015), 233‚Äì34.Marr (1995), p. 14. On 22 June, while Catroux was still in his post, the Japanese issued a second demand: naval basing rights at Guangzhouwan and the total closure of the Chinese border by 7 July. Issaku Nishihara, who was to lead the \\"inspection team\\", the true purpose of which was unknown, even to the Japanese, arrived in Hanoi on 29 June. On 3 July, he issued a third demand: air bases and the right to transit combat troops through Indochina. These new demands were referred to the government in France.Marr (1995), p. 15. The incoming governor, Decoux, who arrived in Indochina in July, urged the government to reject the demands. Although he believed that Indochina could not defend itself against a Japanese invasion, Decoux believed it was strong enough to dissuade Japan from invading. At Vichy, General Jules-Antoine B√ºhrer, chief of the Colonial General Staff, counselled resistance. The still neutral United States had already been contracted to provide aircraft, and there were 4,000 Tirailleurs s√©n√©galais in Djibouti that could be shipped to Indochina in case of need. In Indochina, Decoux had under his command 32,000 regulars, plus 17,000 auxiliaries, although they were all ill-equipped. On 30 August 1940, the Japanese foreign minister, Y≈çsuke Matsuoka, approved a draft proposal submitted by his French colleague, Paul Baudouin, whereby Japanese forces could be stationed in and transit through Indochina only for the duration of the Sino-Japanese War. Both governments then \\"instructed their military representatives in Indochina to work out the details [although] they would have been better advised to stick to Tokyo‚ÄìVichy channels a bit longer\\". Negotiations between the supreme commander of Indochinese troops, Maurice Martin, and General Nishihara began at Hanoi on 3 September.Marr (1995), p. 17. During negotiations, the government in France asked the German government to intervene to moderate its ally's demands. The Germans did nothing. Decoux and Martin, acting on their own, looked for help from the American and British consuls in Hanoi, and even consulted with the Chinese government on joint defence against a Japanese attack on Indochina. On 6 September, an infantry battalion of the Japanese Twenty-Second Army based in Nanning violated the Indochinese border near the French fort at ƒê·ªìng ƒêƒÉng. The Twenty-Second Army was a part of the Japanese Southern China Area Army, whose officers, remembering the Mukden incident of 1931, were trying to force their superiors to adopt a more aggressive policy. Following the ƒê·ªìng ƒêƒÉng incident, Decoux cut off negotiations. On 18 September, Nishihara sent him an ultimatum, warning that Japanese troops would enter Indochina regardless of any French agreement at 22:00 (local time) on 22 September. This prompted Decoux to demand a reduction in the number of Japanese troops that would be stationed in Indochina. The Japanese Army General Staff, with the support of the Japanese Southern China Area Army, was demanding 25,000 troops in Indochina. Nishihara, with the support of the Imperial General Headquarters, got that number reduced to 6,000 on 21 September.Marr (1995), p. 18. Seven and a half hours before the expiration of the Japanese ultimatum on 22 September, Martin and Nishihara signed an agreement authorizing the stationing of 6,000 Japanese troops in Tonkin north of the Red River, the use of four airfields in Tonkin, the right to move up to 25,000 troops through Tonkin to Yunnan and the right to move one division of the Twenty-Second Army through Tonkin via Haiphong for use elsewhere in China. Already on 5 September, the Japanese Southern Army had organized the amphibious Indochina Expeditionary Army under Major-General Takuma Nishimura, it was supported by a flotilla of ships and aircraft, both carrier- and land-based. When the accord was signed, a convoy was waiting off Hainan Island to bring the expeditionary force to Tonkin.Marr (1995), p. 19. Invasion The accord had been communicated to all relevant commands by 21:00, an hour before the ultimatum was set to expire. It was understood between Martin and Nishimura that the first troops would arrive by ship. The Twenty-Second Army, however, did not intend to wait to take advantage of the accord. Lieutenant-General Aketo Nakamura, commander of the 5th (Infantry) Division, sent columns across the border near ƒê·ªìng ƒêƒÉng at precisely 22:00. At ƒê·ªìng ƒêƒÉng there was an exchange of fire that quickly spread to other border posts overnight. The French position at the railhead at L·∫°ng S∆°n was surrounded by Japanese armour and forced to surrender on 25 September. Before surrendering, the French commanders had ordered the breechblocks of the 155mm cannons thrown into a river to prevent the Japanese from using them. During the Sino-French War of 1884‚Äì1885, the French had been forced into an embarrassing retreat from L·∫°ng S∆°n in which equipment had likewise been thrown into the same river to prevent capture. When the breechblocks of 1940 were eventually retrieved, several chests of money lost in 1885 were found also. Among the units taken captive at L·∫°ng S∆°n was the 2nd Battalion of the 5th Foreign Infantry Regiment that contained 179 German and Austrian volunteers, whom the Japanese in vain tried to induce to change sides.Porch (2010), p. 511. On 23 September, the French Government protested the breach of the agreements by the IJA to the Japanese government. On the morning of 24 September, Japanese aircraft from aircraft carriers in the Gulf of Tonkin attacked French positions on the coast. A French Government envoy came to negotiate; in the meantime, shore defenses remained under orders to open fire on any attempted landing. On 26 September, Japanese forces came ashore at Dong Tac, south of Haiphong, and moved on the port. A second landing put tanks ashore, and Japanese planes bombed Haiphong, causing some casualties. By early afternoon the Japanese force of some 4,500 troops and a dozen tanks were outside Haiphong. By the evening of 26 September, fighting had died down. Japan took possession of Gia Lam Airbase outside Hanoi, the rail marshaling yard on the Yunnan border at Lao Cai, and Phu Lang Thuong on the railway from Hanoi to L·∫°ng S∆°n, and stationed 900 troops in the port of Haiphong and 600 more in Hanoi. Aftermath The Japanese tendered an official apology for the incident at L·∫°ng S∆°n on 5 October 1940. The Japanese-occupied towns were returned to French control and all French prisoners were released. The occupation of southern French Indochina did not happen immediately. The Vichy government had agreed that some 40,000 troops could be stationed there. However, Japanese planners did not immediately move troops there, worried that such a move would be inflammatory to relations between Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Furthermore, within the Japanese high command there was a disagreement over what to do about the Soviet threat to the north of their Manchurian territories. The tipping point came just after the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union in late June 1941. With the Soviets tied down, the high command concluded that a \\"strike south\\" would solve Japan's problems with the United States, most notably the increasing American concerns about Japan's moves in China, and the possibility of a crippling oil embargo on Japan. To prepare for an invasion of the Dutch East Indies, some 140,000 Japanese troops invaded southern French Indochina on 28 July 1941. French troops and the civil administration were allowed to remain, albeit under Japanese supervision. With the Allied invasion of France in 1944, Japan suspected that the French authorities in Indochina might assist any Allied operations in the region. Therefore, a Japanese coup d'√©tat in French Indochina deposed the French authorities in the spring of 1945.

Gap Hill lies along its northwestern side. The village is located at the northeastern end of the gap, around the source of Swabia Creek. The Catasauqua and Fogelsville Railroad was extended to the village in 1865, to carry magnetite from the mines in the vicinity, largely owned by the Thomas Iron Company. These mines were among those selected by Thomas Edison for experiments in magnetic beneficiation of iron ore, by which he hoped to make iron mining in the northeastern US cost-effective. The availability of cheap Mesabi Range ore defeated his plans, and the mines and railroad were abandoned after World War I. The geological origins of the deposits have been the subject of recent research. With the closing of the iron mines, the community lost its principal support.

In 2011, the CCHS football team, undefeated at the time, was caught up in controversy when it was accused of using an ineligible player for nine games and therefore had to forfeit those games. It appealed the forfeits to the Alabama High School Athletic Association, but the appeal was denied. It later took the case to the Jefferson County Circuit Court, where it was granted an injunctive relief and allowed back in the AHSAA playoffs. However, the Etowah County School System challenged the court's decision in order to put Gadsden City High School, who was the 4th seed in region 7 when CCHS forfeited the wins, back in the playoffs.

History =Pre-contact through the mid-19th century= =Treaty with the United States= Sign of The Confederated Tribes In 1855, Joel Palmer, Oregon Superintendent of Indian Affairs, negotiated a treaty with the Coquille and surrounding tribes that set aside of coastline extending from the Siltcoos River to Cape Lookout to form the Coastal (or Siletz) Indian Reservation near present-day Florence. The Coquille people were forcibly marched to the reservation in 1856; however, the treaty was never ratified by Congress. Disease and overcrowding were problems on the reservation, which was eventually reduced to a fraction of its former size. The remnants of the original Coastal Indian Reservation are contained in the Siletz Reservation and associated tribally owned lands. Over the years many Coquilles returned to their traditional homeland and fought for acknowledgement of the Treaty of 1855. =Termination and restoration= The U.S. federal government terminated its recognition of the Coquille as part of the Western Oregon Indian Termination Act. In 1989 the tribe regained its federal recognition. With restoration came tribal sovereignty, which gives the tribe authority to form its own government and have jurisdiction over tribal lands, businesses, and community members. Coquille Indian Reservation The Confederated Tribes of Siletz, based in Siletz, Oregon, recognize the Coquille people as one of the tribes that make up their confederation. The Confederated Tribes of Siletz continue to live on the Siletz Indian Reservation. In addition, by an Act of Congress in 1996, the Coquille Tribe now has reservation area totaling . The 2000 census listed the reservation's official resident population as 258 people. The reservation's lands are located in numerous non-contiguous parcels of land in southern Coos County, mostly in and to the southeast of the Coos Bay-North Bend urban area. Parts of the communities of Bandon, Barview, Coos Bay, and North Bend extend onto reservation lands. =Forest management= The \\"Oregon Resources Conservation Act of 1996\\" (part of Public Law 104-208) restored to the Coquille Tribe approximately 5,400 acres of forest in Coos County, Oregon. The act's author, Oregon Senator Mark Hatfield, said of the Coquille Forest: \\"I hope this proposal, with its relatively modest acreage and the required adherence to the most environmentally friendly forest management plan ever implemented in the Pacific Northwest--President Clinton's forest plan--is successful and can become a model for how our Nation deals with other claims by native American tribes.\\"Congressional Record: August 2, 1996 (Senate)] [Page S9649-S9660] The Forest was formally taken into trust for the Tribe by the U.S. government on September 30, 1998. The Coquille Forest comprises fourteen separate parcels of former BLM timberlands in eastern Coos County. Unlike other forests held in trust for and managed by federally recognized tribes, under the National Indian Forest Resources Management Act, the Coquille Forest has the additional requirement of meeting the \\"standards and guidelines\\" of adjacent federal forests, such as the Northwest Forest Plan. While most federal forests have not met their timber production expectations under the Northwest Forest Plan, the Coquille Forest is widely considered the only entity to meet both the ecological and economic outputs of the Northwest Forest Plan. In 2011, the U.S. Secretary of Interior endorsed the first component of the landscape management proposal in which the Coquille Indian Tribe and the BLM would work together to develop a demonstration timber sale pilot in coordination with professors Norm Johnson and Jerry Franklin. This pilot will demonstrate the professors' ecological principles of variable retention regeneration harvest in the Oregon Coast Range. The timber sale will be designed under the Northwest Forest Plan and comply with all BLM requirements. Management of the Coquille Forest has earned recognition for being environmentally sound and sustainable. The Forest Stewardship Council certified the Coquille Forest in September 2011.Newsletter of the Coquille Indian Tribe , August 2011. Government The tribal government is based in North Bend. In 2008 the tribe legalized same-sex marriage. Although the Oregon voters approved an amendment to the Oregon Constitution in 2004 to prohibit such marriages, the Coquille are not bound by the Oregon Constitution, because they are a federally recognized sovereign nation. The Coquille Indian Tribe Library contains an extensive amount of information on the Coquille Indian Tribe and other Tribes of southwest Oregon including the Confederated Tribes of Coos, Lower Umpqua, and Siuslaw Indians.

A three- judge panel convicted Fox of aggravated murder and kidnapping and sentenced him to death on June 27, 1990. He spent 12 years, 7 months, and 17 days on death row as his case was appealed through the state and federal court systems. The crime The crime for which Fox paid with his life was his first criminal conviction, but Fox had been increasingly aggressive toward women in the months before the murder of 18-year-old Leslie Renae Keckler, testimony at his trial revealed. In fact, it was the victim of a previous encounter with Fox who helped police break the case. On September 14, 1989, Leslie Keckler applied for a waitress job at a Bowling Green restaurant where Fox worked as a grill cook. As Keckler was filling out her job application, Fox pointed out Keckler to a coworker and said \\"I'd like to have some of that\\", the coworker testified later. Fox gleaned Keckler's telephone number from the application and asked her to meet him for an interview for a restaurant supply sales job. On September 26, Keckler went to a local motel where Fox had arranged the job interview. Keckler's boyfriend saw her just before she left and Keckler told him she might be gone for two or three hours. When Keckler did not return that night, her boyfriend and her mother filed a missing persons report with police. Police found the car Keckler had been driving abandoned at a local mall. Four days later, two boys riding bicycles found Keckler's body in a rural drainage ditch. Keckler was still wearing her new black dress and leather jacket. However, a clasp on her brassiere was broken, her belt was unbuckled, two dress buttons were missing, and her pantyhose was torn in the crotch. Aside from a nearby shoe, police found no other evidence at the scene. Wounds The autopsy revealed that Keckler had died as a result of asphyxia from ligature strangulation and multiple stab wounds. She had been stabbed six times in the back; three stab wounds penetrated her lungs. Her right wrist had a deep defensive wound gash, and her face had bruises on her left eye, upper lip, and nose consistent with blunt force injury. The coroner found no signs of sexual assault. Previous attack When the story of Keckler's murder was publicized, another Bowling Green woman came forward with a nearly similar story. She had applied for work at a restaurant and received an invitation for an interview for a different position from a man referred to as \\"Jeff Bennett\\" but who was later positively identified as Fox. He asked her to come to a local motel--the same one that Keckler was headed--to discuss the job opportunity. After meeting Fox, she agreed to accompany him in his car that evening to discuss the job. They drove for a while and then parked. Fox began making suggestive comments and told the woman he thought her dress was too long. She realized that she had been duped and informed Fox that she was not interested in any job. In response, Fox asked what the woman would do if someone \\"pulled a knife\\" on her and asked her for money, or asked her \\"to do other things\\". At that moment, the woman jumped out of the car as Fox tried to grab her and said \\"come back\\" and that he \\"wasn't finished with [her] yet\\". She made a safe getaway, but did not report the incident to police until after Keckler disappeared. The woman provided police with a sketch of her assailant. Investigation A check of the employees at the restaurants where the two women applied for jobs revealed an interesting coincidence: Fox was employed at both places. Other circumstantial evidence made Fox their prime suspect. On October 2, an acquaintance of Fox told police that the composite sketch resembled Richard Fox of Tontogany. Police confirmed that Fox matched the description of \\"Bennett\\" and Fox's car also matched the description of \\"Bennett's\\" car. That same day, police secured a search warrant for Fox's car and found some \\"suspicious items\\". They asked Fox to come to the station to answer a few questions and he voluntarily accompanied them. Before Fox was placed under arrest, he admitted that in early May he had worked at a restaurant where his first intended victim had applied for a job, that he met her at the motel, and that he took her for a drive and discussed her skirt length. Arrest and admissions After his arrest and after being advised of his Miranda rights, Fox admitted he knew Keckler and claimed they had met and spoke at the restaurant where he worked and met again a couple of days later. He described his encounter with Keckler at the motel on September 26 as a date. Later, at the mall, \\"he saw Leslie and they talked and ended up taking a drive in his car\\". Fox said that he and Keckler parked, and \\"things were getting warmed up\\". However, \\"then Leslie did not want to participate\\". Unwittingly, Keckler triggered something in Fox's psyche as she tried to get away from him. She called him \\"an asshole\\" and started to get out of the car. Fox told detectives, \\"no one calls me an asshole\\". Fox grabbed the woman by the coat as she was standing up to get out of the car and pulled her back in, then he pulled the coat up over her head. Fox told police he got a knife out of the glove compartment and stabbed Keckler in the back, after which he got a rope out of the trunk \\"just to make sure she was dead\\" and strangled her. He took police to a rural location outside Bowling Green where he dumped Keckler's purse and other property. Clemency hearing and execution At Fox's clemency hearing where the parole board listens to arguments why it should or should not recommend that the governor commute a death sentence, it was revealed that Fox had written a letter apologizing to the Keckler family for his actions: : \\"If I could, I would sit down with my victim's family and try and share how sorry I am, how I have changed and how I wish I could change what happened. I am sorry, and I must pay for my actions, if it be with a life in prison or if it be by my life, I will do what is required as I know I must pay for my mistakes!\\" Neither that letter nor his teenage daughter's tearful plea not to be made an orphan (her mother had earlier committed suicide) swayed the parole board. Fox was sentenced to death, and the next 12 years, 7 months, and 17 days on death row at the Southern Ohio Correctional Facility in Lucasville. On Wednesday, February 12, 2003, Fox was executed by lethal injection. Fox made no statement before he was injected with the deadly chemicals. The execution took a total of 13 minutes from the time the first chemical was started until Fox was pronounced dead.

Despite some popular support for the cause of the Confederate States of America, Maryland would not secede during the Civil War. Because the state bordered the District of Columbia and the strong desire of the opposing factions within the state to sway public opinion towards their respective causes, Maryland played an important role in the war. Newly elected 16th President Abraham Lincoln (1809‚Äì1865, served 1861‚Äì1865), suspended the constitutional right of habeas corpus in Maryland; and he dismissed Chief Justice Roger B. Taney of the U.S. Supreme Court's \\"Ex parte Merryman\\" decision in 1861 concerning freeing John Merryman, a prominent Southern sympathizer from Baltimore County arrested by the military and held in Fort McHenry (then nicknamed the \\"Baltimore Bastille\\"). The Chief Justice, (but not in a decision with the other justices), had held that the suspension was unconstitutional and could only be done by Congress and would leave lasting civil and legal scars. The decision was filed in the U.S. Circuit Court for Maryland by Chief Justice Roger Brooke Taney, a Marylander from Frederick (and sometimes in Baltimore) and former protege of seventh President Andrew Jackson who had appointed him two decades earlier. The first fatalities of the war happened during the Baltimore Civil War Riots of Thursday/Friday, April 18-19, 1861, on the waterfront piers adjacent to Pratt and President Street, between the President Street Station and the Camden Street Station. A year and a half later, the single bloodiest day of combat in American military history occurred during the first major Confederate invasion of the North in the Maryland Campaign, just north above the Potomac River near Sharpsburg in Washington County, at the Battle of Antietam on September 17, 1862. Preceded by the pivotal skirmishes at three mountain passes of Crampton, Fox and Turner's Gaps to the east in the Battle of South Mountain, Antietam (also known in the South as the Battle of Sharpsburg), though tactically a draw, was strategically enough of a Union victory in the second year of the war to give 16th President Abraham Lincoln the opportunity to issue in September 1862, the Emancipation Proclamation, taking effect January 1, 1863, which declared slaves in the rebelling states of the Confederacy (but not those in the areas already occupied by the Union Army or in border slave states like Maryland, Delaware, Kentucky, and Missouri) to be \\"henceforth and forever free\\". Later, in July 1864, the Battle of Monocacy near Frederick, Maryland in the third and last major Southern invasion, was also fought on Maryland soil. Monocacy was a tactical victory for the Confederate States Army but a strategic defeat, as the one-day delay inflicted on the attacking Confederates under Gen. Jubal Early by Federal General Lew Wallace's units hastily sent west on the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad with reinforcements from Baltimore with their stout resistance cost rebel General Early his chance to capture the Union capital of Washington, D.C. during the subsequent attack on the outlying northwestern fortifications near Fort Stevens, witnessed by President Lincoln himself in the only time that a Chief Executive came under hostile fire. Across the state, some 50,000 citizens signed up for the military, with most joining the United States Army. Approximately a tenth as many enlisted to \\"go South\\" and fight for the Confederacy. The most prominent Maryland leaders and officers during the Civil War included Governor Thomas H. Hicks who, despite his early sympathies for the South, helped prevent the state from seceding, and Confederate Brigadier General George H. Steuart, who was a noted brigade commander under Robert E. Lee in the Army of Northern Virginia. Abolition of slavery in the State of Maryland came before the end of the war, with a new third constitution voted approval in 1864 by a small majority of Radical Republican Unionists then controlling the nominally Democratic state. Animosity against Lincoln would remain, and Marylander John Wilkes Booth would assassinate President Lincoln on April 14, 1865, crying \\"sic semper tyrannis\\" the Virginia state motto as he did so in Washington's Ford's Theater, then fleeing and hiding in southern Maryland for a week hunted by Federal troops before slipping across the Potomac and later shot in a Virginia barn. The approach of War =Maryland's sympathies= 8th Massachusetts regiment repairing railroad bridges from Annapolis to Washington. Maryland, as a slave- holding border state, was deeply divided over the antebellum arguments over states' rights and the future of slavery in the Union. Culturally, geographically and economically, Maryland found herself neither one thing nor another, a unique blend of Southern agrarianism and Northern mercantilism. In the leadup to the American Civil War, it became clear that the state was bitterly divided in its sympathies. There was much less appetite for secession than elsewhere in the Southern States (South Carolina, Mississippi, Florida, Georgia, Alabama Louisiana, Texas, Virginia, North Carolina, Arkansas, Tennessee) or in the border states (Kentucky and Missouri),Andrews, p506 but Maryland was equally unsympathetic towards the potentially abolitionist position of Republican candidate Abraham Lincoln. In the presidential election of 1860 Lincoln won just 2,294 votes out of a total of 92,421, only 2.5% of the votes cast, coming in at a distant fourth place with Southern Democrat (and later Confederate general) John C. Breckinridge winning the state.Andrews, p.505 In seven counties, Lincoln received not a single vote. The areas of Southern and Eastern Shore Maryland, especially those on the Chesapeake Bay (which neighbored Virginia), which had prospered on the tobacco trade and slave labor, were generally sympathetic to the South, while the central and western areas of the state, especially Marylanders of German origin, had stronger economic ties to the North and thus were pro-Union.Field, Ron, et al., p.33, The Confederate Army 1861‚Äì65: Missouri, Kentucky & Maryland Osprey Publishing (2008), Retrieved August 2012 Not all blacks in Maryland were slaves. The 1860 Federal Census1860 Census Information, U.S. Census Bureau showed there were nearly as many free blacks (83,942) as slaves (87,189) in Maryland, although the latter were much more dominant in southern counties. However, across the state, sympathies were mixed. Many Marylanders were simply pragmatic, recognizing that the state's long border with the Union state of Pennsylvania would be almost impossible to defend in the event of war. Maryland businessmen feared the likely loss of trade that would be caused by war and the strong possibility of a blockade of Baltimore's port by the Union Navy.Mitchell, p.12 Retrieved November 2012 Other residents, and a majority of the legislature, wished to remain in the Union, but did not want to be involved in a war against their southern neighbors, and sought to prevent a military response by Lincoln to the South's secession. After John Brown's raid on Harpers Ferry in 1859, many citizens began forming local militias, determined to prevent a future slave uprising. =Baltimore Riot of 1861= The Baltimore Riot of April 1861 Thomas Hicks The first bloodshed of the Civil War occurred in Maryland. Anxious about the risk of secessionists capturing Washington, D.C., given that the capital was bordered by Virginia, and preparing for war with the South, the federal government requested armed volunteers to suppress \\"unlawful combinations\\" in the South.Andrews, p.511 Soldiers from Pennsylvania and Massachusetts were transported by rail to Baltimore, where they had to disembark, march through the city, and board another train to continue their journey south to Washington.Andrews, p.512 As one Massachusetts regiment was transferred between stations on April 19, a mob of Marylanders sympathizing with the South, or objecting to the use of federal troops against the seceding states, attacked the train cars and blocked the route; some began throwing cobblestones and bricks at the troops, assaulting them with \\"shouts and stones\\".Andrews, p.514 Panicked by the situation, several soldiers fired into the mob, whether \\"accidentally\\", \\"in a desultory manner\\", or \\"by the command of the officers\\" is unclear. Chaos ensued as a giant brawl began between fleeing soldiers, the violent mob, and the Baltimore police who tried to suppress the violence. Four soldiers and twelve civilians were killed in the riot. The disorder inspired James Ryder Randall, a Marylander living in Louisiana, to write a poem which would be put to music and, in 1939, become the state song, \\"Maryland, My Maryland\\" (it remains the official state song to this day). The song's lyrics urged Marylanders to \\"spurn the Northern scum\\" and \\"burst the tyrant's chain\\" ‚Äî in other words, to secede from the Union. Confederate States Army bands would later play the song after they crossed into Maryland territory during the Maryland Campaign in 1862. After the April 19 rioting, skirmishes continued in Baltimore for the next month. Mayor George William Brown and Maryland Governor Thomas Hicks implored President Lincoln to reroute troops around Baltimore city and through Annapolis to avoid further confrontations.Andrews, p.517 In a letter to President Lincoln, Mayor Brown wrote: Hearing no immediate reply from Washington, on the evening of April 19 Governor Hicks and Mayor Brown ordered the destruction of railroad bridges leading into the city from the North, preventing further incursions by Union soldiers. The destruction was accomplished the next day.Harris (2011) pp. 46-47 One of the men involved in this destruction would be arrested for it in May without recourse to habeas corpus, leading to the ex parte Merryman ruling. For a time it looked as if Maryland was one provocation away from joining the rebels, but Lincoln moved swiftly to defuse the situation, promising that the troops were needed purely to defend Washington, not to attack the South.Andrews, p.518 President Lincoln also complied with the request to reroute troops to Annapolis, as the political situation in Baltimore remained highly volatile. Meanwhile, General Winfield Scott, who was in charge of military operations in Maryland indicated in correspondence with the head of Pennsylvania troops that the route through Baltimore would resume once sufficient troops were available to secure Baltimore.Harris (2011) pp. 51-52. Harris states that Lincoln may or may not have been aware of this communication. =To secede or not to secede= Despite some popular support for the cause of the Confederate States of America, Maryland would not secede during the Civil War. However, a number of leading citizens, including physician and slaveholder Richard Sprigg Steuart, placed considerable pressure on Governor Hicks to summon the state Legislature to vote on secession, following Hicks to Annapolis with a number of fellow citizens: Responding to pressure, on April 22 Governor Hicks finally announced that the state legislature would meet in a special session in Frederick, a strongly pro-Union town, rather than the state capital of Annapolis. The Maryland General Assembly convened in Frederick and unanimously adopted a measure stating that they would not commit the state to secession, explaining that they had \\"no constitutional authority to take such action,\\"Scharf, p.202 Retrieved November 2012 whatever their own personal feelings might have been.Andrews, p.520 On April 29, the Legislature voted decisively 53‚Äì13 against secession,Mitchell, p.87Radcliffe, George Lovic-Pierce, Governor Thomas H. Hicks of Maryland and the Civil War, The Johns Hopkins Press, Nov- Dec 1901, pp. 73-74. though they also voted not to reopen rail links with the North, and they requested that Lincoln remove Union troops from Maryland. At this time the legislature seems to have wanted to avoid involvement in a war against its southern neighbors. =Imposition of martial law= Cannon on Federal Hill, aimed at downtown Baltimore On May 13, 1861 General Benjamin F. Butler entered Baltimore by rail with 1,000 Federal soldiers and, under cover of a thunderstorm, quietly took possession of Federal Hill. Butler fortified his position and trained his guns upon the city, threatening its destruction. Butler then sent a letter to the commander of Fort McHenry: Butler went on to occupy Baltimore and declared martial law, ostensibly to prevent secession, although Maryland had voted solidly (53‚Äì13) against secession two weeks earlier, but more immediately to allow war to be made on the South without hindrance from the state of Maryland,Andrews, p.521 which had also voted to close its rail lines to Northern troops, so as to avoid involvement in a war against its southern neighbors. By May 21 there was no need to send further troops. After the occupation of the city, Union troops were garrisoned throughout the state. By late summer Maryland was firmly in the hands of Union soldiers. Arrests of Confederate sympathizers and those critical of Lincoln and the war soon followed, and Steuart's brother, the militia general George H. Steuart, fled to Charlottesville, Virginia, after which much of his family's property was confiscated by the Federal Government.Brugger, Robert J., Maryland, A Middle Temperament: 1634‚Äì1980. p.280 Retrieved Feb 28 2010 Civil authority in Baltimore was swiftly withdrawn from all those who had not been steadfastly in favor of the Federal Government's emergency measures.Andrews, p.524 During this period in spring 1861, Baltimore Mayor Brown,Mitchell, p.207 the city council, the police commissioner, and the entire Board of Police, were arrested and imprisoned at Fort McHenry without charges.Mitchell, p.291 Retrieved November 2012 One of those arrested was militia captain John Merryman, who was held without trial in defiance of a writ of habeas corpus on May 25, sparking the case of Ex parte Merryman, heard just 2 days later on May 27 and 28. In this case U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice, and native Marylander, Roger B. Taney, acting as a federal circuit court judge, ruled that the arrest of Merryman was unconstitutional without Congressional authorization, which Lincoln could not then secure: The Merryman decision created a sensation, but its immediate impact was rather limited, as the president simply ignored the ruling.Andrews, p.522 Indeed, when Lincoln's dismissal of Chief Justice Taney's ruling was criticized in a September 1861 editorial by Baltimore newspaper editor Frank Key Howard (Francis Scott Key's grandson), Howard was himself arrested by order of Lincoln's Secretary of State Seward and held without trial. Howard described these events in his 1863 book Fourteen Months in American Bastiles, where he noted that he was imprisoned in Fort McHenry, the same fort where the Star Spangled Banner had been waving \\"o'er the land of the free\\" in his grandfather's song. Two of the publishers selling his book were then arrested. In all nine newspapers were shut down in Maryland by the federal government, and a dozen newspaper owners and editors like Howard were imprisoned without charges. On September 17, 1861, the first day of the Maryland legislature's new session, fully one third of the members of the Maryland General Assembly were arrested, due to federal concerns that the Assembly \\"would aid the anticipated rebel invasion and would attempt to take the state out of the Union.\\"William C. Harris, Lincoln and the Border States: Preserving the Union (University Press of Kansas, 2011) pp.71 Although previous secession votes, in spring 1861, had failed by large margins, there were legitimate concerns that the war-averse Assembly would further impede the federal government's use of Maryland infrastructure to wage war on the South. One month later in October 1861 one John Murphy asked the United States Circuit Court for the District of Columbia to issue a writ of habeas corpus for his son, then in the United States Army, on the grounds that he was underage. When the writ was delivered to General Andrew Porter Provost Marshal of the District of Columbia he had both the lawyer delivering the writ and the United States Circuit Judge, Marylander William Matthew Merrick, who issued the writ, arrested to prevent them from proceeding in the case United States ex rel. Murphy v. Porter. Merrick's fellow judges took up the case and ordered General Porter to appear before them, but Lincoln's Secretary of State Seward prevented the federal marshal from delivering the court order.Inside Lincoln's White House: The Complete Civil War Diary of John Hay, p. 28 (SIU Press, Michael Burlingame and John R. Turner Ettlinger eds. 1999). The court objected that this disruption of its process was unconstitutional, but noted that it was powerless to enforce its prerogatives.. The following month in November 1861, Judge Richard Bennett Carmichael, a presiding state circuit court judge in Maryland, was imprisoned without charge for releasing, due to his concern that arrests were arbitrary and civil liberties had been violated, many of the southern sympathizers seized in his jurisdiction. The order came again from Lincoln's Secretary of State Seward. The federal troops executing Judge Carmichael's arrest beat him unconscious in his courthouse while his court was in session, before dragging him out, initiating a public controversy. In another controversial arrest that fall, and in further defiance of Chief Justice Taney's ruling, a sitting U.S. Congressman Henry May (D-Maryland) was imprisoned without charge and without recourse to habeas corpus in Fort Lafayette.The Bastille in America; or Democratic Absolutism. London: Robert Hardwicke, 1861, p. 12.Mitchell, Charles W., ed. Maryland Voices of the Civil War. JHU Press, 2007, p. 237. May was eventually released and returned to his seat in Congress in December 1861, and in March 1862 he introduced a bill to Congress requiring the federal government to either indict by grand jury or release all other \\"political prisoners\\" still held without habeas.Jonathan White, \\"Abraham Lincoln and Treason in the Civil War: The Trials of John Merryman\\", LSU Press, 2011. p. 106 The provisions of May's bill were included in the March 1863 Habeas Corpus Act, in which Congress finally authorized Lincoln to suspend habeas corpus, but required actual indictments for suspected traitors.Jonathan White, \\"Abraham Lincoln and Treason in the Civil War: The Trials of John Merryman\\", LSU Press, 2011. p. 107 =Marylanders fought both for the Union and the Confederacy= Arnold Elzey, colonel of the 1st Maryland Infantry, CSA, promoted by Confederate President Jefferson Davis to brigadier general after the First Battle of Manassas. Although Maryland stayed as part of the Union and more Marylanders fought for the Union than for the Confederacy, Marylanders sympathetic to the secession easily crossed the Potomac River into secessionist Virginia in order to join and fight for the Confederacy. During the early summer of 1861, several thousand Marylanders crossed the Potomac to join the Confederate Army. Most of the men enlisted into regiments from Virginia or the Carolinas, but six companies of Marylanders formed at Harpers Ferry into the Maryland Battalion. Among them were members of the former volunteer militia unit, the Maryland Guard Battalion, initially formed in Baltimore in 1859.Field, Ron, et al., The Confederate Army 1861‚Äì65: Missouri, Kentucky & Maryland Osprey Publishing (2008), Retrieved March 4, 2010 Maryland Exiles, including Arnold Elzey and brigadier general George H. Steuart, would organize a \\"Maryland Line\\" in the Army of Northern Virginia which eventually consisted of one infantry regiment, one infantry battalion, two cavalry battalions and four battalions of artillery. Most of these volunteers tended to hail from southern and eastern counties of the state, while northern and western Maryland furnished more volunteers for the Union armies.Andrews, p.543 Captain Bradley T. Johnson refused the offer of the Virginians to join a Virginia Regiment, insisting that Maryland should be represented independently in the Confederate army. It was agreed that Arnold Elzey, a seasoned career officer from Maryland, would command the 1st Maryland Regiment. His executive officer was the Marylander George H. Steuart, who would later be known as \\"Maryland Steuart\\" to distinguish him from his more famous cavalry colleague J.E.B. Stuart. The 1st Maryland Infantry Regiment was officially formed on June 16, 1861, and, on June 25, two additional companies joined the regiment in Winchester. Its initial term of duty was for twelve months.Andrews, p.544 It has been estimated that, of the state's 1860 population of 687,000, about 4,000 Marylanders traveled south to fight for the Confederacy. While the number of Marylanders in Confederate service is often reported as 20-25,000 based on an oral statement of General Cooper to General Trimble, other contemporary reports refute this number and offer more detailed estimates in the range of 3,500 (Livermore)Thomas Livermore, Numbers and Losses in the Civil War, Boston, 1900. See chart and explanation, p. 550 to just under 4,700 (McKim)Randolph McKim, Numerical Strength of the Confederate Army, New York, 1912. See discussion and tabulation on pp. 62-65. Of the Trimble count, McKim states The estimate above alluded to, of 20,000 Marylanders in the Confederate service, rests apparently upon no better basis than an oral statement of General Cooper to General Trimble, in which he said he believed that the muster rolls would show that about 20,000 men in the Confederate army had given the State of Maryland as the place of their nativity. How many were citizens of Maryland when they enlisted does not appear. Obviously many natives of Maryland were doubtless in 1861 citizens of other States, and could not therefore be reckoned among the soldiers furnished by Maryland to the Confederate armies., which latter number should be further reduced given that the 2nd Maryland Infantry raised in 1862 consisted largely of the same men who had served in the 1st Maryland, which mustered out after a year. While other men born in Maryland may have served in other Confederate formations, the same is true of units in the service of the United States. The 1860 Census reported the chief destinations of internal immigrants from Maryland as Ohio and Pennsylvania, followed by Virginia and the District of Columbia. Population of the United States in 1860, G.P.O. 1864. See Introduction, p. xxxiv A similar situation existed in relation to Marylanders serving in the United States Colored Troops. Indeed, on the whole there appear to have been twice as many black Marylanders serving in the U.S.C.T. as white Marylanders in the Confederate army.See, e.g., C. R. Gibbs' Black, Copper, and Bright, Silver Spring, Maryland, 2002. This history of the 1st U.S.C.T., credited to the District of Columbia contains roster on pp. 228-259 listing more than 300 men born in Maryland. Similarly, Robert Beecham, in his memoir, As If It Were Glory, Lanham, Maryland, 1998, p. 166, says of the 23rd U.S.C.T. that \\"the 23rd was made up of men mostly from Washington and Baltimore\\" though the regiment was credited to the state of Virginia. Overall, the Official Records of the War Department credits Maryland with 33,995 white enlistments in volunteer regiments of the United States Army and 8,718 African American enlistments in the United States Colored Troops. A further 3,925 Marylanders, not differentiated by race, served as sailors or marines. The War of the Rebellion, Series III, Volume 4, pp. 69-70. One notable Maryland front line regiment was the 2nd Maryland Infantry, which saw considerable combat action in the Union IX Corps. Another was the 4th United States Colored Troops, whose Sergeant Major, Christian Fleetwood was awarded the Medal of Honor for rallying the regiment and saving its colors in the successful assault on New Market Heights. William A. Dobak, Freedom by the Sword, Skyhorse Publishing, 2013 =A state divided= Not all those who sympathised with the rebels would abandon their homes and join the Confederacy. Some, like physician Richard Sprigg Steuart, remained in Maryland, offered covert support for the South, and refused to sign an oath of loyalty to the Union.Helsel, David S., p.19, Spring Grove State Hospital Retrieved February 26, 2010 Later in 1861, Baltimore resident W W Glenn described Steuart as a fugitive from the authorities: Civil War =Battle of Front Royal= Crossing the Potomac into Maryland on 6th September 1862 Because Maryland's sympathies were divided, many Marylanders would fight one another during the conflict. On May 23, 1862, at the Battle of Front Royal, the 1st Maryland Infantry, CSA was thrown into battle with their fellow Marylanders, the Union 1st Regiment Maryland Volunteer Infantry. This is the only time in United States military history that two regiments of the same numerical designation and from the same state have engaged each other in battle.Andrews, p.531 After hours of desperate fighting the Southerners emerged victorious, despite an inferiority both of numbers and equipment. When the prisoners were taken, many men recognized former friends and family. Major William Goldsborough, whose memoir The Maryland Line in the Confederate Army chronicled the story of the rebel Marylanders, wrote of the battle: Among the prisoners captured by William Goldsborough was his own brother Charles Goldsborough.Goldsborough, W.W., Introduction, The Maryland Line in the Confederate Army, Butternut Press, Maryland (1983) On 6 September 1862 advancing Confederate soldiers entered Frederick, Maryland, the home of Colonel Bradley T. Johnson, who issued a proclamation calling upon his fellow Marylanders to join his colors. Disappointingly for the exiles, recruits did not flock to the Confederate banner. Whether this was due to local sympathy with the Union cause or the generally ragged state of the Confederate army, many of whom had no shoes, is not clear.Andrews, p. 539 Frederick would later be extorted by Jubal Early, who threatened to burn down the city if its residents did not pay a ransom. Hagerstown too would also suffer a similar fate. =\\"Bloody Antietam\\"= Battle of Antietam by Kurz and Allison. Confederate dead at Antietam. One of the bloodiest battles fought in the Civil war (and one of the most significant) was the Battle of Antietam, fought on September 17, 1862, near Sharpsburg, Maryland, in which Marylanders fought with distinction for both armies. The battle was the culmination of Robert E. Lee's Maryland Campaign, which aimed to take the war to the North. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia, consisting of about 40,000 men, had entered Maryland following their recent victory at Second Bull Run.Andrews, p.539 While Major General George B. McClellan's 87,000-man Army of the Potomac was moving to intercept Lee, a Union soldier discovered a mislaid copy of the detailed battle plans of Lee's army, on Sunday 14 September.Andrews, p.541 The order indicated that Lee had divided his army and dispersed portions geographically (to Harpers Ferry, West Virginia, and Hagerstown, Maryland), thus making each subject to isolation and defeat in detail - if McClellan could move quickly enough. However, McClellan waited about 18 hours before deciding to take advantage of this intelligence and position his forces based on it, thus endangering a golden opportunity to defeat Lee decisively.McPherson, p. 109. The armies met near the town of Sharpsburg by the Antietam Creek. Losses were extremely heavy on both sides; The Union suffered 12,401 casualties with 2,108 dead. Confederate casualties were 10,318 with 1,546 dead. This represented 25% of the Federal force and 31% of the Confederate. More Americans died in battle on September 17, 1862, than on any other day in the nation's military history. The Confederate General A. P. Hill described Although tactically inconclusive, the Battle of Antietam is considered a strategic Union victory and an important turning point of the war, because it forced the end of Lee's invasion of the North, and it allowed President Lincoln to issue the Emancipation Proclamation, taking effect on January 1, 1863. Lincoln had wished to issue his proclamation earlier, but needed a military victory in order for his proclamation not to become self- defeating. As Lincoln himself stated, five days before the battle: Lee's setback at the Battle of Antietam can also be seen as a turning point in that it may have dissuaded the governments of France and Great Britain from recognizing the Confederacy, doubting the South's ability to maintain and win the war.Gallagher, p.vii Retrieved January 2013 =March to Gettysburg= The Confederate 2nd Maryland infantry charge Union lines at Gettysburg In June 1863 General Lee's army again advanced north into Maryland, taking the war into Union territory for the second time. Maryland exile George H. Steuart, leading the 2nd Maryland Infantry regiment, is said to have jumped down from his horse, kissed his native soil and stood on his head in jubilation. According to one of his aides: \\"We loved Maryland, we felt that she was in bondage against her will, and we burned with desire to have a part in liberating her\\".Tagg, p.273 Quartermaster John Howard recalled that Steuart performed \\"seventeen double somersaults\\" all the while whistling Maryland, My Maryland.Goldsborough, p.98. Such celebrations would prove short lived, as Steuart's brigade was soon to be severely damaged at the Battle of Gettysburg (July 1‚Äì3, 1863), a turning point in the war and a reverse from which the Confederate army would never recover. =Battle of Monocacy= In 1864, elements of the warring armies again met in Maryland, although this time the scope and size of the battle was much smaller. The Battle of Monocacy was fought on July 9, just outside Frederick, as part of the Valley Campaigns of 1864. Confederate forces under Lt. Gen. Jubal A. Early defeated Union troops under Maj. Gen. Lew Wallace. The battle was part of Early's raid through the Shenandoah Valley and into Maryland, attempting to divert Union forces away from Gen. Robert E. Lee's army under siege at Petersburg, Virginia. However, Wallace delayed Early for nearly a full day, buying enough time for Ulysses S. Grant to send reinforcements from the Army of the Potomac to the Washington defenses. Prisoners of war Thousands of Union troops were stationed in Charles County, and the Federal Government established a large, unsheltered prison camp at Point Lookout at Maryland's southern tip in St. Mary's County between the Potomac River and the Chesapeake Bay, where thousands of Confederates were kept, often in harsh conditions. Of the 50,000 Southern soldiers held in the army prison camp, who were housed in tents at the Point between 1863 and 1865, according to the Maryland Department of Natural Resources, (Maryland Park Service) nearly 4,000 died, although this death rate of 8 percent was less than half the death rate among soldiers who were still fighting in the field with their own armies.Point Lookout History, Maryland Department of Natural Resources Retrieved August 2012 The harshness of conditions at Point Lookout, and in particular whether such conditions formed part of a deliberate policy of \\"vindictive directives\\" from Washington, is a matter of some debate.Gillipsie, p.179 Retrieved January 2013 The state capital Annapolis's western suburb of Parole became a camp where prisoners-of- war would await formal exchange in the early years of the war. Around 70,000 soldiers passed through Camp Parole until Lt. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant assumed command as General-in-Chief of the Union Army in 1864, and ended the system of prisoner exchanges.Arnett, p.81 Retrieved January 2013 Slavery and emancipation Those who voted for Maryland to remain in the Union did not at first contemplate the emancipation of Maryland's many slaves, or indeed those of the Confederacy. In March 1862 the Maryland Assembly passed a series of resolutions, stating that: In other words, as far as Marylanders were concerned, the war was being fought over Union, not over slavery. And, because Maryland had remained in the Union, the state was not included under the Emancipation Proclamation of January 1, 1863, which declared that all slaves within the Confederacy (but not those in border states like Maryland) would henceforth be free. It was not until 1864 that a constitutional convention was held which would address the issue of slavery in Maryland. =Constitution of 1864, and the abolition of slavery= The issue of slavery was finally confronted by the constitution which the state adopted in 1864. The document, which replaced the Maryland Constitution of 1851, was largely advocated by Unionists who had secured control of the state, and was framed by a Convention which met at Annapolis in April 1864.Andrews, p.553 Article 24 of the constitution at last outlawed the practice of slavery. One feature of the new constitution was a highly restrictive oath of allegiance which was designed to reduce the influence of Southern sympathizers, and to prevent such individuals from holding public office of any kind. The new constitution emancipated the state's slaves (who had not been freed by President Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation), disenfranchised southern sympathizers, and re-apportioned the General Assembly based upon white inhabitants. This last provision diminished the power of the small counties where the majority of the state's large former slave population lived. The constitution was submitted to the people for ratification on October 13, 1864 and it was narrowly approved by a vote of 30,174 to 29,799 (50.31% to 49.69%) in a referendum widely characterised by intimidation and fraud.Andrews, p.554 This was a controversial result, given the state's Confederate ties and sympathies. Those voting at their usual polling places were opposed to the Constitution by 29,536 to 27,541. However, the constitution secured ratification after Maryland's soldiers' votes were included in the count. Marylanders serving in the Union Army were overwhelmingly in favor (2,633 to 263). Maryland soldiers who were fighting for the Confederacy, and therefore could not vote, would likely have overwhelmingly opposed it. The new constitution came into effect on November 1, 1864 and, while it emancipated the state's slaves, this did not mean equality for them, in part because the franchise continued to be restricted to white males. However, the abolition of slavery in Maryland did precede the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which outlawed slavery throughout the United States, and did not come into effect until December 6, 1865. Emancipation did not immediately bring citizenship for former slaves. The Maryland legislature refused to ratify both the 14th Amendment, which conferred citizenship rights on former slaves, and the 15th Amendment, which gave the vote to African Americans. The right to vote was eventually extended to non-white males in the Maryland Constitution of 1867, which remains in effect today. The Constitution of 1867 overturned the registry test oath embedded in the 1864 constitution. Assassination of President Lincoln Marylander John Wilkes Booth assassinates President Lincoln The issue of slavery may have been settled by the new constitution, and the legality of secession by the war, but this did not end the debate. On April 14, 1865 the actor John Wilkes Booth assassinated President Abraham Lincoln at Ford's Theatre in Washington, D.C. Booth was born in Harford County, Maryland, a northern county on the Pennsylvania border, which had few slaves.https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:MarylandSlavePop.jpg After he shot Lincoln, Booth shouted \\"Sic semper tyrannis\\" (\\"Thus always to tyrants\\").http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/lincolnconspiracy/boothdiary.html Other witnesses ‚Äî including Booth himself ‚Äî claimed that he only yelled \\"Sic semper!\\"Diary Entry of John Wilkes Booth Some didn't recall hearing Booth shout anything in Latin.

In a letter explaining his actions, Booth wrote: Legacy Most Marylanders fought for the Union, but after the war a number of memorials were erected in sympathy with the Lost Cause of the Confederacy, including in Baltimore a Confederate Women's Monument, and a Confederate Soldiers and Sailors Monument.

It owned and published over 100 magazine brands, including its namesake Time, Sports Illustrated, Travel + Leisure, Food & Wine, Fortune, People, InStyle, Life, Golf Magazine, Southern Living, Essence, Real Simple, and Entertainment Weekly. It also had subsidiaries which it co-operated with the UK magazine house Time Inc. UK (which later sold and since has been rebranded to TI Media), whose major titles include What's on TV, NME, Country Life, and Wallpaper. Time Inc. also co-operated over 60 websites and digital-only titles including MyRecipes, Extra Crispy, TheSnug, HelloGiggles, and MIMI. In 1990, Time Inc. merged with Warner Communications to form the media conglomerate Time Warner (now AT&T-owned; WarnerMedia). This merger lasted until the company was spun off on June 9, 2014, going public under the ticker TIME. In November 2017, competing publisher and media company Meredith Corporation announced that it would acquire Time Inc. for $2.8 billion. The acquisition was completed on January 31, 2018. History =Beginnings= Nightly discussions of the concept of a news magazine led its founders Henry Luce and Briton Hadden, both age 23, to quit their jobs in 1922. Later that same year, they formed Time Inc. Having raised $86,000 of a $100,000 goal, the first issue of Time was published on March 3, 1923, as the first weekly news magazine in the United States. Luce served as business manager while Hadden was editor-in-chief. Luce and Hadden annually alternated year-to-year the titles of president and secretary-treasurer. Upon Hadden's sudden death in 1929, Luce assumed Hadden's position. Luce launched the business magazine Fortune in February 1930 and created/founded the pictorial Life magazine in 1936, and launched House & Home in 1952 and Sports Illustrated in 1954. He also produced The March of Time radio and newsreel series. By the mid-1960s, Time Inc. was the largest and most prestigious magazine publisher in the world. (Dwight Macdonald, a Fortune staffer during the 1930s, referred to him as \\"Il Luce\\", a play on the Italian dictator Benito Mussolini, who was called \\"Il Duce\\".) Once ambitious to become Secretary of State in a Republican administration, Luce penned a famous article in Life magazine in 1941, called \\"The American Century\\", which defined the role of American foreign policy for the remainder of the 20th century, and perhaps beyond. President Franklin D. Roosevelt, aware that most publishers were opposed to him, issued a decree in 1943 that blocked all publishers and media executives from visits to combat areas; he put General George Marshall in charge of enforcement. The main target was Luce, who had long opposed FDR. Historian Alan Brinkley argues the move was \\"badly mistaken\\", for had Luce been allowed to travel, he would have been an enthusiastic cheerleader for American forces around the globe. But stranded in New York City, Luce's frustration and anger expressed itself in hard-edged partisanship. Luce, supported by Editor T. S. Matthews, appointed Whittaker Chambers as acting Foreign News editor in 1944, despite the feuds Chambers had with reporters in the field. In 1963, recommendations from Time Inc. executive David Brumbaugh based on how it delivered magazines led to the introduction of ZIP codes by the United States Post Office. In the 1950s, Brumbaugh made presentations to the Post Office Department to explain how Time Inc. was using a zoning system to speed the delivery of its magazines. Although the Post Office Department had instated zones in 1943, they were inconsistently applied. As cited in FYI, Time Inc.‚Äôs internal newsletter ‚Äú‚ÄòFewer than 40% of the cities were properly zoned,‚Äô he recalls. ‚ÄòI went to the Post Office Department and showed them how we were making the zone system work.‚Äô‚Äù Luce, who remained editor-in-chief of all his publications until 1964, maintained a position as an influential member of the Republican Party. Holding anti-communist sentiments, he used Time to support right-wing dictatorships in the name of fighting communism. An instrumental figure behind the so-called \\"China Lobby\\", he played a large role in steering American foreign policy and popular sentiment in favor of Nationalist leader Chiang Kai-shek and his wife Soong Mei-ling in their war against the Japanese. (The Chiangs appeared in the cover of Time eleven times between 1927 and 1955.) =Merger with Warner Communications= The merger of Time Inc. and Warner Communications was announced on March 4, 1989. During the summer of that same year, Paramount Communications (formerly Gulf+Western) launched a $12.2 billion hostile bid to acquire Time Inc. in an attempt to end a stock swap merger deal between Time and Warner Communications. This caused Time to raise its bid for Warner to $14.9 billion in cash and stock. Paramount responded by filing a lawsuit in a Delaware court to block the Time/Warner merger. The court ruled twice in favor of Time, forcing Paramount to drop both the Time acquisition and the lawsuit, and allowing the formation of the two companies' merger which was completed on January 10, 1990. However, instead of the companies becoming defunct, the impact of the merger and its resultant financial shock wave gave off a new corporate structure, resulting in the new combined company being called \\"Time Warner\\".Bill Saporito,\\"The Inside Story of Time Warner\\",Fortune,November 20,1989 In 2008, Time Inc. launched Maghound, an internet-based magazine membership service that featured approximately 300 magazine titles from both Time Inc. brands and external publishing companies. On January 19, 2010, Time Inc. acquired StyleFeeder, a personal shopping engine. In August 2010, Time Inc. announced that Ann S. Moore, its chairman and chief executive, would step down as CEO and be replaced by Jack Griffin, an executive with Meredith Corporation, the nation's second-largest publisher of consumer magazines. In September 2010, Time Inc. entered into a licensing agreement with Kolkata-based ABP Group, one of India's largest media conglomerates, to publish Fortune India magazine and the yearly Fortune India 500 list. Griffin was ousted after a brief tenure, eventually being replaced by Laura Lang, who served about a year. =Split= On March 6, 2013, Time Warner announced plans to spin-off Time Inc. into a publicly traded company. Time Warner's chairman/CEO Jeff Bewkes said that the split would allow Time Warner to focus entirely on its television and film businesses, and Time Inc. to focus on its core print media businesses. It was announced in May 2014 that Time Inc. would become a publicly traded company on June 6 of that year. The spinoff was completed on June 9, 2014. As of September 13, 2016, Rich Battista was promoted to president and CEO, replacing Joseph A. Ripp. Time Inc. purchased American Express Publishing Corporation's suite of titles, including Travel + Leisure, Food & Wine, Departures, Black Ink and Executive Travel on October 1, 2013. On January 14, 2014, Time Inc. announced that Colin Bodell was joining the company in the newly created position of Executive Vice President and Chief Technology Officer. However, he was let go May 19, 2016 On February 5, 2014, Time Inc. announced that it was cutting 500 jobs with most of the layoffs at American Express Publishing. From April 2014 to mid-2017, the Chairman of Time Inc. was Joseph A. Ripp, who had been Chief Executive since September 2013 and continued as Executive Chairman when replaced as CEO by Battista. Though Ripp had intended to remain Executive Chairman until 2018, he wound up leaving the board in 2017 and John Fahey served as non-executive chairman for the months prior to the company's sale to Meredith. On May 28, 2015, Time Inc. announced the purchase of entertainment and sports news site . In July 2015, Time Inc. acquired League Athletics in Tucson, SportsSignup in Saratoga Springs, and iScore in Los Alamitos. The three companies will be a part of Sports Illustrated Play. After attempting a few TV shows in 2014 and 2015, the company formed Time Inc. Productions in 2016 as its in-house production company. On February 11, 2016, Time Inc. announced that it has acquired Viant, a leading people based marketing platform and owner of MySpace. = Sale to Meredith = In February 2017, it was reported that Meredith Corporation and a group of investors led by Edgar Bronfman Jr. were considering purchasing Time Inc. In 2016, Time Inc. acquired Bizrate Insights. On April 28, 2017, the company's board of directors dropped the plan of selling the company and instead focus on growth strategies. On November 26, 2017, it was announced that Meredith Corporation would acquire Time Inc. in a $2.8 billion deal. $640 million in backing will be provided by Koch Equity Development, but the Koch family will not have a board seat or otherwise influence the company's operations. Prior to the sale closing in January 2018, Time Inc. sold Essence Communications to Richelieu Dennis, the founder of hair- and skin-care products maker Sundial Brands. In January 2018, Meredith removed signage and references to Time, Inc., and Time, Inc. website was redirected to the Meredith's website. In March 2018, only six weeks after the closure of the deal, Meredith announced that it would lay off 1,200 employees, and explore the sale of Time, Fortune, Money, and Sports Illustrated. The company felt that these brands did not align with its core, lifestyle-oriented properties. Howard Milstein had announced on February 7, 2018, that he would acquire Golf Magazine from Meredith, and Time Inc. UK was sold to the British private equity group Epiris (later rebranded to TI Media) in late February. In September 2018, Meredith announced that it would re-sell Time to Marc Benioff and his wife Lynne for $190 million. Although Benioff is the chairman and co- CEO of Salesforce.com, Time will remain separate from the company, and Benioff will not be involved in its daily operations. In November 2018, Meredith announced to sell Fortune to Thai businessman Chatchaval Jiaravanon for $150 million. Leadership In the early years, when the company was just Time magazine, Luce served as business manager while Hadden was editor-in-chief, and they annually alternated the positions of president and secretary- treasurer. On Hadden's sudden death in 1929 Luce took his position and business management was entrusted to Roy E. Larsen, who had been one of their first hires. Luce cultivated a philosophy of \\"church and state\\", where the editorial and business management were separate up to the board of directors level. (This was functionally ended with the departure of McManus from the Time Warner board, and formally by Ripp in 2013). =Editors-in-chief= * 1929‚Äì1964 Henry Luce (then \\"Editorial Chairman\\" to his death in 1967) * 1964‚Äì1979 Hedley Donovan * 1979‚Äì1987 Henry Anatole Grunwald * 1987‚Äì1994 Jason McManus McManus left the board of what had become Time Warner shortly before retiring, and his replacement Norman Pearlstine and successors John Huey (2006-2012) and Martha Nelson (2013) were never directors of the parent.

Records Overview, New York University Library corporate entity diversified out of publishing in the 1970s and 1980s, purchasing what was later spun off as Temple-Inland paper company and various broadcasting and cable television operations such as HBO and what became Time Warner Cable. As the distinction between the overall corporation and the magazine operation grew, the position that had been \\"Group Vice President, Magazines\\" or \\"Executive Vice President, Magazines\\" became president and chief executive of a \\"magazine group\\" in 1985 (under Kelso F. Sutton to 1986,and then Reginald K. Brack Jr.) and then became president and CEO of a newly incorporated subsidiary,\\"The Time Inc. Magazine Company\\" in 1988 (initially with John A. Meyers as chairman). In 1992, Time Warner reorganized so that the non-magazine parts of Time Inc. came directly under the parent and the Time Inc. name was downgraded to only include the magazine company, so the officers of the \\"Magazine Company\\" became the officers of what was now Time Inc. Later that year, CEO Brack shifted to chairman with Don Logan as president; he stepped down in favor of Logan as CEO in 1994 and chairman in 1997. Logan moved up to a group oversight position including additional Time Warner operations in 2002 (Ann S. Moore succeeding him at the magazine operation) and left the company in 2005. Leaders after Moore are noted above.

She was also known as Virginia Tunstall, Virginia Clay, and Mrs. Clement Claiborne Clay. She took on different responsibilities after the Civil War. As the wife of US Senator Clement Claiborne Clay from Alabama, she was part of a group of young southerners who boarded together in the capital in particular hotels. In the immediate postwar period, she worked to gain her husband's freedom from imprisonment at Fort Monroe, where Jefferson Davis, former president of the Confederacy, was also held. In the late 19th century, Clay-Copton (who remarried after her first husband died) became an activist in the United Daughters of the Confederacy, a group established after the Civil War that was instrumental in shaping public discussions about the war and role of the South. She worked to raise funds for Confederate cemeteries and memorials. She also worked for women's suffrage. Clay-Copton was one of a number of Southern women to publish her memoir at the turn of the 20th century; these women's accounts became part of the public discourse about the war. The United Daughters of the Confederacy specifically recommended her book as one of three for serious discussion by the membership. Such works helped shape memories of the antebellum years and the Lost Cause. Early life Virginia Caroline Tunstall was born in 1825, in Nash County, North Carolina. Her parents were Anne Arrington and Dr. Peyton Randolph Tunstall. She was reared by several of her mother's numerous half-siblings after her mother died when Virginia was three years old. Her father left her to her mother's family and moved to Alabama. The girl lived first with the Drakes in North Carolina. At the age of six, Virginia was taken to Tuscaloosa, Alabama, where she lived with her maternal aunt and her husband Henry W. Collier, later appointed to the State Supreme Court.A Belle of the Fifties: Memoirs of Mrs. Clay, of Alabama, Covering Social and Political Life in Washington and the South, 1853-66, New York: Doubleday, Page & Company, 1905, c1904, full online text available at Documenting the American South, University of North Carolina In 1837 he was made Chief Justice. More than a decade later, in 1849 he was elected by an overwhelming margin as the governor of the state, and served for two terms.\\"Henry Watkins Collier\\", Alabama Archives and History, accessed 19 May 2012 After four years, Virginia's aunt was suffering failing health. Virginia went to live with her maternal uncle, Alfred Battle, and his family on their plantation outside Tuscaloosa. Virginia was tutored but also had much time to play with her cousins and have the run of the property. During this period, she became close to her father's brother, Thomas B. Tunstall, Secretary of State for Alabama, who took her under his wing, introducing her to literature, poetry and music. With her uncle Thomas, she visited her father in Mobile, where the two Tunstall men took Virginia to the theatre and other events. At about fifteen, she was sent to the Female Academy in Nashville, Tennessee to finish her education at a private girls' school. As the capital, Tuscaloosa was a city of 6,000, and attracted people from all over the state, generating lively social events. Marriage and family Tunstall married Clement Claiborne Clay (1816-1882), an attorney and young legislator, whom she had met at her uncle Henry Collier's home. They were quickly engaged after her return from the Female Academy and married a month later in 1843; she was 18 years old and he was 27. She moved with him to Huntsville, Alabama, where his family was based. In 1849 her uncle Henry Collier was elected governor of Alabama. When her husband was elected by the legislature as a U.S. Senator in 1853, Virginia Clay moved with him to Washington, DC. On the train they met numerous other people from the state who were going to be part of Congress and the administration, forming friendships that lasted. In the capital, they were part of the political social life of the elite. That first winter Clay gave birth to her only child, who died soon after. Within a year, she was fully participating in the many events of the city. In rounds of dinners, Virginia Clay met other Congressmen and their wives, as well as members of the diplomatic corps and President Franklin Pierce's administration. During these years in Washington, she and her husband and numerous other Southerners lived at Brown's Hotel on Pennsylvania Avenue. For a couple of winters they shifted to the Ebbitt Hotel, but returned to Brown's, where many of their friends stayed during Congressional sessions. The hotel was an extension of their social life. American Civil War With growing tensions over sectional differences[citation ?], in 1861, Alabama seceded from the Union and the Clays returned to the state. Clement Claiborne Clay represented his state in the Confederate legislature, and the couple moved to the capital of Richmond, Virginia. Postwar years Clement Clay and his wife Virginia were among Southerners imprisoned at Fort Monroe after the war; they were suspected of being involved in the assassination plot against President Abraham Lincoln. Also held at that prison was Jefferson Davis, their friend and former president of the Confederacy. They became even closer friends during this time. Varina Howell Davis used to visit her husband, bringing their youngest daughter. The Clays were released in 1866, but Davis was not let go until 1867. The families had some continued contact after the Clays returned to Huntsville, Alabama. About this time, Jefferson Davis is believed to have fallen in love with Virginia Clay, carrying on a passionate correspondence with her for three years. In 1871 he was reported by newspapers across the country as having been seen on a train with an unidentified woman, and the incident gained him unwanted attention.\\"Varina Howell Davis (1826‚Äì1906)\\", Encyclopedia of Virginia, 2 Jun 2014, accessed 29 June 2015 Virginia Clay's husband Clement died in 1882. In 1887, she married Judge David Clopton, and became known as Mrs. Clay-Clopton. He died in 1892. During these years Virginia Clay-Clopton became active in the women's suffrage movement and the United Daughters of the Confederacy, founded in 1894. Beginning with women's groups arranging for burial and commemoration of the Confederate dead, the chapters grew rapidly into the twentieth century, when membership reached into the hundreds of thousands.Drew Gilpin Faust, This Republic of Suffering: Death and the American Civil War, New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 2008, pp. 237-247 UDC activities and intervention into textbook content strongly shaped memory and public opinion about the Civil War.David W. Blight, Race and Reunion: The Civil War in American Memory, Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 2001 In 1904 Clay-Clopton published a memoir entitled, A Belle in the Fifties, covering her life from girlhood through her confinement at Fort Monroe. It was one of three memoirs recommended by the UDC to its membership for serious study, together with those of Sara Agnes Rice Pryor and Louise Wigfall Wright. In the postwar years, some of the earliest books by Southern women had been histories or biographies of historical figures, such as that by Varina Davis of her husband. The UDC encouraged women to write their own stories. Such memoirs became part of the public discourse about the war, so that women's roles and sacrifices were acknowledged. Their accounts of antebellum society became part of an idealized past. At the turn of the century, a dozen memoirs by Southern women were published.Sarah E. Gardner, Blood And Irony: Southern White Women's Narratives of the Civil War, 1861-1937, University of North Carolina Press, 2006, pp. 128-130 Clay-Clopton is buried in Maple Hill Cemetery in Huntsville, Alabama near her first husband.

Westfield High School is part of the Westfield Washington School District, and is commonly abbreviated as \\"WHS.\\" History The shamrock was chosen to represent the school's athletic teams due to the significant population of Quakers living in the community who preferred a nonviolent mascot. From 1968, up until 1997, the school was on the south side of Hoover Street. The former high school is still standing, and forms the west end of Westfield Middle School. Before the old high school was built, WHS was located by S.R. 32, east of U.S. 31. This school at one time served grades Kindergarten and 7-12. In 1970, the auditorium and gymnasium were burnt down. The school still served as the junior high, although there was no auditorium or gym. A new middle school was built in 1976. In the fall of 1997, the school relocated to its current location at the intersection of Hoover and Union Streets, just north of the old school. In 2014, Riverview Health agreed to pay $1.5 million over 10 years for the naming rights to Westfield High School's football stadium.

The 1861 Alabama Constitution granted citizenship to current U.S. residents, but prohibited import duties (tariffs) on foreign goods, limited a standing military, and as a final issue, opposed emancipation by any nation, but urged protection of African slaves, with trial by jury, and reserved the power to regulate or prohibit the African slave trade. The secession convention invited all slaveholding states to secede, but only 7 Cotton States of the Lower South formed the Confederacy with Alabama, while the majority of slave states were in the Union. Congress voted to protect the institution of slavery by passing the Corwin Amendment on March 4, 1861, but it was never ratified. Even before secession, the governor of Alabama defied the United States government by seizing the two federal forts at the Gulf Coast (forts Morgan and Gaines) and the arsenal at Mount Vernon in January 1861 to distribute weapons to Alabama towns. The peaceful seizure of Alabama forts preceded by three months the bombing and capture of the Union's Fort Sumter (SC) on April 12, 1861. Alabama was politically divided, voting to secede 61-39%, with most opposition by Unionists in northern Alabama, and citizens subsequently joined both Confederate and Union forces. Issues of slavery also were divided, with emancipation denied, but slaves protected, allowed trial by jury same as free whites, and African Slave Trade was discouraged in the 1861 Ordinances. Alabama provided a significant source of troops and leaders, military material, supplies, food, horses and mules. At the southern coast, the Alabama ports remained open (with Union blockades, but guarded by forts, floating mines and obstacle paths) for almost 4 years using blockade runners, until the Battle of Mobile Bay (Aug 1864) and the Battle of Fort Blakeley (April 1865) forced Mobile to surrender the last major Confederate port. Secession After the election of Abraham Lincoln from the anti-slavery Republican Party in 1860, plus the prior secession declarations of South Carolina, Mississippi, and Florida, Alabama delegates also voted to secede from the United States, on January 11, 1861, in order to join and form a slaveholding Southern republic, mostly of the Cotton States. The Alabama Secession Convention invited delegates from the fourteen slaveholding states to join at Montgomery, on February 11, 1861, when seven Cotton States of the Lower South formed the new republic, with Montgomery as Confederate capital and former Mississippi U.S. Senator Jefferson Davis as President of the Confederacy. In December 1860, Stephen F. Hale, Alabama's commissioner to Kentucky, wrote a letter to that state's governor about Alabama's justification for secession. In it, he voiced support for the Dred Scott decision, condemned the Republican Party for opposing slavery, and stated that the state's secession, which would perpetuate slavery, was the only way to prevent prospective African-American freedmen, whom Hale referred to as \\"half- civilized Africans\\" from waging a race war (noting the 1804 Haiti massacre): At the state secession convention in January 1861, one delegate stated that the state's declaring of secession was motivated by slavery: In an 1861 speech delivered by Alabama politician Robert Hardy Smith, he said that the state of Alabama had left the United States over the issue of slavery. In the speech, he praised the Confederate constitution for its un-euphemistic protections of the right of its citizens to own slaves: The 1861 Alabama Constitution Ordinance 20 (approved January 28, 1861) insisted the planned Confederacy oppose what it called the \\"African Slave Trade\\" and not consider to re-open the issue. Newspapers in Alabama also supported secession to preserve slavery. According to one newspaper in Montgomery, slavery was a benevolent \\"religious institution\\" allowing care of slaves who might perish in other regions. Upon its secession Alabama adopted a new state constitution. In it, it forbade the emancipation of slaves by the state itself, or by \\"any other country\\", such as the United States of America, which Alabama viewed itself as having left, but also the power to oppose the \\"African Slave Trade\\": Alabama joins the war effort Antebellum Governor Andrew B. Moore energetically supported the Confederate war effort. Even before hostilities began in April 1861, he seized U.S. forts on the Alabama Gulf Coast (Morgan and Gaines) and the arsenal in Mount Vernon, in January 1861, sent agents to buy rifles in the Northeast, and scoured the state for weapons. Despite strong resistance in the northern part of the state, Alabama seceded by vote 61-39 and formed the Confederate States of America. Congressman Williamson R.W. Cobb, a Unionist, pleaded for compromise. He ran for Congress, but was soundly defeated (he was subsequently elected in 1863 on a wave of anti-war sentiment, with war-weariness growing in Alabama). The new nation brushed Cobb aside and set up its provisional capital in Montgomery and selected Jefferson Davis as president. In May the Confederate government left Montgomery before the sickly season began and relocated to Richmond, Virginia, after Virginia had seceded in April 1861. =Transportation difficulty= Some idea of the severe logistical problems the Confederacy faced, with the capital city at Montgomery, can be seen by tracing the difficult journey into Alabama which Jefferson Davis made to the Confederacy's provisional capital from his home in Mississippi, the next state over, to assume the presidency on February 16, 1861. From his plantation on the river, he took a steamboat down the Mississippi to Vicksburg, boarded a train to Jackson, where he took another train north to Grand Junction, then a third train east to Chattanooga, Tennessee, and a fourth train southeast to Atlanta, Georgia. Yet another train took Davis west, back to the Alabama border, where a final train took him to Montgomery. He was in a hurry, but it took five days.William J. Cooper, Jefferson Davis, American (2010). pp. 352-53. As the war proceeded, internal transportation became much more difficult. The Union seized the Tennessee and Mississippi rivers, burned trestles and railroad bridges, and tore up track; the frail Confederate railroad system faltered and virtually collapsed for want of repairs and replacement parts. For example, The Mobile and Ohio Railroad connected the main port at Mobile to points north, ending in Columbus, Kentucky. Historian James Doster reports that when the war ended, \\"Only a fourth of the rolling stock remained, and that was in bad condition. The repair shops were ruined. The 184-mile roadway from Okolona to Union City was damaged by decay and destruction of bridges, trestlework, crossties, and water stations\\".James F. Doster, \\"Were the Southern Railroads Destroyed by the Civil War?.\\" Civil War History 7.3 (1961): 310-320 at p 313-14. The port of Mobile was blockaded by the U.S. Navy, but some small, fast blockade runners got through at first, carrying out cotton and bringing in luxuries, food and munitions.Arthur W. Bergeron Jr, Confederate Mobile (LSU Press, 2000) ch 9 =Weakening economy= At the outbreak of war, the state's economy was weak; during the war it declined further. Before the war, most people worked in agriculture. The largest industry was the railroads, followed by gristmills then sawmills. Perhaps 17% of the state's White population was in military service, but this was skewed to a much larger percentage of the economically valuable young men. The full crops planted in 1861 were harvested by those left behind, but the 1862 planting was smaller. Further, many counties suffered a drought in 1862, which further reduced harvest production. In Coosa County, corn production was down by 150,000 bushels from 1861. Twenty counties (of 67) were unable to produce any surplus of corn. This brought hunger to families left behind by many Confederate soldiers. Wartime conditions made it difficult to move food from areas of surplus to those that were suffering. Poverty became widespread as shortages drove up food prices. During the war, the legislature provided almost twelve million dollars in poverty relief funds. In 1861, the state recorded 7% of White families as indigent. In 1862 the figure was 34%, it rose to 39% the following year. Harsh conditions at home encouraged many soldiers to desert. A November 1864 list shows some 7,994 men had left their units. Later, bread riots hit Mobile in both April and September 1863. By 1864, roving bands of \\"corn women\\" wandered the state begging and stealing. Military endeavors The state raised five regiments for the U.S. Army, four of them for Black troops (Union U.S.C.T.). In addition, there were Confederate troops in sixty-five infantry regiments, plus sixteen cavalry and three of artillery, that fought against the government. A large number of irregular units were also organized locally. Alabama was protected by Confederate troops against most major military operations, except the Battle of Mobile Bay (August 1864) and final conflicts of the War at Spanish Fort and Fort Blakeley (April 9, 1865), the last major battle of the Civil War. The state contributed about 120,000 men to the Confederate service, practically all the white population capable of bearing arms. Most were recruited locally and served with men they knew, which built esprit and strengthened ties to home. Medical conditions were severe; about 15% died of disease, and 10% from battle. Alabama had few well-equipped hospitals, but it had many women who volunteered to nurse the sick and wounded. Soldiers were poorly equipped, especially after 1863, and often resorted to pillaging the dead for boots, belts, canteens, blankets, hats, shirts and pants. Uncounted thousands of slaves worked with Confederate troops; they took care of horses and equipment, cooked and did laundry, hauled supplies, and helped in field hospitals. Other slaves built defensive installations, especially those around Mobile. They graded roads, repaired railroads, drove supply wagons, and labored in iron mines, iron foundries and even in the munitions factories. As they were enslaved, the labor of slaves was involuntary, their unpaid labor was forcibly impressed from their unpaid masters. About 10,000 slaves escaped and joined the Union Army, along with 2,700 white men who had remained loyal to the Union. Thirty- nine Alabamians attained the ranks of general or admiral, most notably Admiral Raphael Semmes. Josiah Gorgas was the Chief of Ordnance for the Confederacy. He located new munitions plants in Selma that employed 10,000 workers until Union raiders in 1865 burned down the factories. The Selma Arsenal made most of the Confederacy's ammunition. The Selma Naval Ordnance Works manufactured artillery, turning out a cannon every five days. The Confederate Naval Yard built ships and was noted for launching the CSS Tennessee in 1863 to defend Mobile Bay. Selma's Confederate Nitre Works procured niter for gunpowder from limestone caves. When supplies were low, it advertised for housewives to save the contents of their chamber pots, as urine was a rich source of organic nitrogen. A notable Confederate officer from Alabama was Col. William Calvin Oates. He was an instrumental commander during the attack at Little Round Top during the Battle of Gettysburg. Alabama soldiers fought in hundreds of battles. The state's losses at Gettysburg were 1,750 dead plus even more captured or wounded; the famed \\"Alabama Brigade\\" took 781 casualties. In 1863 Federal forces secured a foothold in northern Alabama in spite of spirited opposition from Confederate cavalry under General Nathan B. Forrest. Mobile Bay From 1861 the Union blockade shut Mobile Bay, and in August 1864 the outer defenses of Mobile were taken by a Federal fleet during the Battle of Mobile Bay. On April 12, 1865, three days after the surrender of Robert E. Lee at Appomattox Courthouse, the city of Mobile surrendered to the Union army to avoid destruction following the Union victories at the Battle of Spanish Fort and the Battle of Fort Blakeley. The Magee Farm, north of Mobile, was the site of preliminary arrangements for the surrender of the last Confederate States Army east of the Mississippi River. Confederate General Richard Taylor negotiated a ceasefire with Union General Edward Canby at the house on April 29, 1865. Taylor's forces, comprising 47,000 Confederate troops serving in Alabama, Mississippi and Louisiana, were the last remaining Confederate force east of the Mississippi River. Union occupation of northern Alabama After the Tennessee and Cumberland rivers were taken, Union forces temporarily occupied Northern Alabama until the fall of Nashville (February 1862) allowed permanent occupation of counties north and west of the Tennessee River, while the Union blockade applied pressure in the southern part of the state. =Unionists in northern Alabama= There was a small loyalist element in northern Alabama that needed Union military support to survive.Margaret M. Storey, Loyalty and Loss: Alabama's Unionists in the Civil War and Reconstruction (LSU Press, 2004). On the one hand, with Union troops present, Southern Unionists were finally able to come out of hiding, join the Union Army if desired, and care for their families, who were now protected from Confederate partisans. On the other hand, Union troops doubled the amount of regional foraging compared to the Confederates. Federal foragers in Northern Alabama were, for the most part, an adventurous group that were aided by loyal Unionists, and they took all they needed for their vast forces, often raiding farms and homes previously struck by the Confederates.Margaret M. Storey. \\"Civil War Unionists and the Political Culture of Loyalty in Alabama, 1860-1861.\\" Journal of Southern History (2003): 71-106. in JSTOR Before the arrival of Federal troops, local Unionist resistance networks were based on underground cells that aided pro-Union Loyalists by means of finances, contacts, supplies, and much needed local intelligence. Recruits from Alabama who had joined Union regiments used their familiarity with the social network and physical geography of the homefront to locate, rescue, and recruit beleaguered Unionists still behind Confederate lines. Loyalists were given assurance of safety and a job if they were to give the U.S. forces supplies, information, contacts, and money. Some Loyalists were drafted, and some were volunteers. White Unionists used the army as a tool to defeat the forces threatening to destroy the old Union, and their families and neighborhoods along with it. The most well-known unit composed entirely of Alabama Unionists was the 1st Alabama Cavalry Regiment (Union). Of the 2,678 white Alabamians who enlisted in the Union Army, 2,066 served in it. Union partisans were motivated by a sense of duty and obligation to the Union cause and a need to protect their family and Unionist friends. They were also motivated by a desire for vengeance for all the wrongs they had suffered at Confederate hands throughout the war. Unionist guerrilla bands were typically fairly compact, numbering between twenty and a hundred men. They were independently organized, but were loosely associated and actively supported by occupying Union forces. Their missions included acting as spies, guides, scouts, recruiters behind enemy lines, and anti-guerrilla fighters to protect Union forces and infrastructure.Judkin Browning. \\"War's Desolating Scourge: The Union's Occupation of North Alabama.\\" Journal of American History 100#1 (2013): 212-213. =Women= Not only did the U.S. Navy's blockade shut down exports, it blocked essential imports, except with blockade runners. Women had charge of making do. They cut back on purchases, brought out old spinning wheels and enlarged their gardens with peas and peanuts to provide clothing and food. They used ersatz substitutes when possible, but there was no real coffee, and it was hard to develop a taste for the okra or chicory substitutes used. The households were severely hurt by inflation in the cost of everyday items and the shortages of food, fodder for the animals, and medical supplies for the wounded. Women had to manage the estates which the men had left behind. Another role the women played was managing the slaves while their husbands were away at war.Jessica Fordham Kidd. \\"Privation and Pride: Life in Blockaded Alabama\\". Alabama Heritage (2006) 82. pp. 8-15.Mary Elizabeth Massey. Ersatz in the Confederacy: Shortages and Substitutes on the Southern Homefront (1952) excerpt and text search. pp. 71-73. Jonathan Wiener studied the census data on plantations in black-belt counties, 1850‚Äì70, and found that the War did not drastically alter the responsibilities and roles of women. The age of the groom went up as younger women married older planters, and birth rates dropped sharply during 1863-68 during Reconstruction. However he finds that plantation mistresses were not more likely to operate plantations than in earlier years, nor was there a lost generation of women without men.Jonathan M. Wiener. \\"Female Planters and Planters' Wives in Civil War and Reconstruction Alabama, 1850-1870\\". Alabama Review (1977) 30#2. pp. 135-149. The women of the Alabama Unionists helped with long-distance communication networks, and they were able to move freely from town to town because of their gender. When these women lost their Unionist husbands, it was often a struggle to survive, as they were completely ostracized by the pro-Confederate women. Storey finds that their intense loyalty to kin, neighbors, and nation strengthened the Unionists against Confederate ideological pressures so much that they preferred to abandon the slave system and their high socioeconomic status in order to remain true to the Union.Margaret M. Storey. \\"Civil War Unionists and the Political Culture of Loyalty in Alabama, 1860‚Äì1861\\". Journal of Southern History (2003) 69#1. pp. 71-106 =Slaves= According to historian Margaret M. Storey, \\"Regardless of the Union's ambivalence toward slaves and slavery, black men and women in Alabama\\" saw the Union occupation as the surest path to freedom.Storey, Loyalty and Loss, p. 113. With regard to Union foraging and the practicing of hard war, while some slaves and free blacks \\"viewed the loss of goods as negligible in light of the security and opportunities\\", for others the \\"Federal occupation brought them loss of even small property [and] meant increased vulnerability to whatever white people won the war.\\"Storey. Loyalty and Loss, pp. 129-30. =Confederate partisans= Many of the Confederate guerrillas in northern Alabama were detached cavalry units that were used to great advantage in protecting the home front, as opposed to serving in the main army. The primary mission of the pro-Confederate guerrillas was to attempt to keep intact the Confederate social and political order. They assisted the war effort in their own backyards by hunting down and arresting Unionists, conscripts, and deserters. In addition, they terrorized Unionists by destroying their property and threatening their families. Confederate guerillas were made up of four types of fighters-the first half of these were under Confederate supervision, being either detached cavalry or enlisted men fighting close to home. The other units either fought disguised as noncombatants or were simply outlaws looking for blood-letting opportunities. These men were not under Confederate control and were as interested in profit as helping the Southern cause.Sean Michael O'Brien. Mountain Partisans: Guerrilla Warfare in the Southern Appalachians, 1861-1865 (Praeger Publishers, 1999). Unionists in southern Alabama Not all Union partisans were confined to the Union-occupied areas of Alabama. In the southeast Alabama counties of Dale, Coffee and Henry (which included present-day Houston County and Geneva County, as well), for instance, guerrillas led by local Unionist John Ward operated virtually at will during the last two years of the war, finding refuge in the vast pine forests that covered this region.See: Early History of S.E. AL, for a description of Ward, his unit and some of their activities. Retrieved on 2010-05-18. These renegades sometimes worked with regular U.S. forces based in Pensacola, Florida, and their depredations led several leading citizens of these counties to petition the governor, T.H. Watts, for military assistance against them.\\"Letter to Alabama Governor T.H.

Governor Lewis E. Parsons in July 1861 made a preliminary estimate of losses. Nearly all the white men had served, some 122,000 he said, of whom 35,000 died in the war and another 30,000 were seriously disabled. The next year, Governor Robert M. Patton estimated that 20,000 veterans had returned home permanently disabled, and there were 20,000 widows and 60,000 orphans. With cotton prices low, the value of farms shrank, from $176 million in 1860 to only $64 million in 1870. The livestock supply shrank too, as the number of horses fell from 127,000 to 80,000, and mules from 111,000 to 76,000. The overall population of Alabama remained nearly the same, as the growth that might have been expected was neutralized by death and emigration.Walter Lynwood Fleming, Civil War and Reconstruction in Alabama (1905). pp. 251-4 online edition Congressional delegations Deputies from the first seven states to secede formed the first two sessions of the 1861 Provisional Confederate Congress. Alabama sent William Parish Chilton, Sr., Jabez Lamar Monroe Curry, Thomas Fearn (resigned March 16, 1861, after first session; replaced by Nicholas Davis, Jr.), Stephen Fowler Hale, David Peter Lewis (resigned March 16, 1861, after first session; replaced by Henry Cox Jones), Colin John McRae, John Gill Shorter (resigned November 1861; replaced by Cornelius Robinson), Robert Hardy Smith, and Richard Wilde Walker. The bicameral First Confederate Congress (1862‚Äì64) included two senators from Alabama‚ÄîClement Claiborne Clay and William Lowndes Yancey (died July 23, 1863; replaced by Robert Jemison, Jr.). Representing Alabama in the House of Representatives were Thomas Jefferson Foster, William Russell Smith, John Perkins Ralls, Jabez Lamar Monroe Curry, Francis Strother Lyon, William Parish Chilton, Sr., David Clopton, James Lawrence Pugh, and Edmund Strother Dargan. Alabama's two senators in the Second Confederate Congress (1864‚Äì65) were Robert Jemison, Jr., and Richard Wilde Walker. Representatives were Thomas Jefferson Foster, William Russell Smith, Marcus Henderson Cruikshank, Francis Strother Lyon, William Parish Chilton, Sr., David Clopton, James L. Pugh, and James Shelton Dickinson. The CSA Congress refused to seat Representative-elect W.R.W. Cobb because he was an avowed Unionist; therefore his district was not represented. War practices War practices were controversial, with land mines at Fort Blakeley exploding on Union troops even after the battle ended. Almost immediately after the Confederacy surrendered, there were allegations that some Confederate soldiers were shot by the Union colored troops, however these allegations were never proven. Available evidence indicates that some Union soldiers may have fired on Confederates who had surrendered but there was no large scale massacre.

It tells the story of a Chinese immigrant, Lau Ah Leong, through the eyes of his daughter-in-law. Book structure The Money Dragon opens with a foreword by former U.S. Senator Hiram Fong. Also included in the book before the story is a family tree. After the story there is a glossary and images of several historic documents and photos, including Lau Ah Leong's immigration form and obituary. Plot introduction Phoenix, a Chinese girl, comes to the Kingdom of Hawaii in 1918 to marry Lau Tat-Tung, first son of Lau Ah Leong. Lau Ah Leong is a very prosperous merchant in Hawaii. Despite Phoenix's dreams of a good life as a rich merchant's wife, she soon learns that reality is not so golden‚ÄîLau Ah Leong has many conniving wives who control the family. While she fights to provide her children with a good life in this environment she learns more about Lau Ah Leong, who is the focus of the book. Plot summary Phoenix first heard of Lau Ah Leong when she was eight, never suspecting then that she would become his daughter-in-law. Ten years later, after the death of her father, L. Ah Leong's first son, Lau Tat-Tung, then aged 30, is suggested as a good match for her. Shortly afterward it is agreed that they should marry. Phoenix is excited and happy about the match. They are married at Ming Yang Tong, L. Ah Leong's largest China estate, having 118 bedrooms.Chun, Pam. The Money Dragon. Sourcebooks. . After the wedding they enjoy eight months at that estate, but are forced to move because the civil war in China is causing concern that Tat-Tung will be kidnapped by a faction desperate for money. Phoenix and Tat-Tung go to Hong Kong to find a boat to Hawaii. Unfortunately many other people have the same idea. Three months later their first child (though not Tat-Tung's oldest‚Äîhe has another by his late wife, and one adopted), Fung-Tai is born. She is another two weeks old before they manage to book passage to Hawaii. When they finally reach Hawaii, it seems a beautiful paradise, filled with beautiful women, a cheerful band, and many garlands of colorful flowers. However, immigration officials claim that it will take three weeks to get Phoenix processed‚Äîa worry, since she has no more milk for their baby. This was due to the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882. Hawaii had become part of the United States, and because of this act Chinese had to have a special Hawaiian Islands identification card and witnesses living in Hawai'i to testify for them upon exit or entry. Sometimes even Hawai'i born Chinese with papers in order and witnesses could be denied entry or exit. However, soon L. Ah Leong comes to clear things up, and pays a bribe of $1350 to get Phoenix off the boat after only an afternoon of waiting. This is the first time Phoenix meets L. Ah Leong face to face. L. Ah Leong began as a poor beggar in China, and through luck and hard work was noticed by his boss, Ahuna, who brings with him to open a plantation store in Hawaii. He also taught Ah Leong the art of coffee brewing and chose Ah Leong's first wife, Dai-Kam. Ah Leong starts a store in Kapa'au, which goes bankrupt. After his bankruptcy, in 1884, Ah Leong is referred to L. Ah Low for a stock boy and store cook. Dai-Kam is Ah Low's family cook. The store is in Honolulu, and Ah Leong lives there through the Bayonet Constitution and a bloody attempt by Hawaiians to return the monarchy to power in 1889. By 1891 Ah Leong's first son is born, and Ah Leong has become a full citizen of the Kingdom of Hawaii, one of only a few non-Hawaiians to do so. He used the dowry money from his first wife to purchase a shop in Kaka'ako. At first the community doubted he would succeed, as Kaka'ako was a predominantly white community, and Chinese usually patronized Chinese shops. This was lucky, because Ah Leong's shop was not burned when Chinatown was burned down after bubonic plague was discovered there. However, trade was very slow for him because many people lost everything to the flames. Ah Leong interpreted the fire, which burned everything so completely, as purifying the ground, and believed that it would cause him good fortune to build on this ground. Therefore, he opened a new store at 11 North King Street (where it can still be seen). His store soon became the busiest in Honolulu. Along with a rise in status and wealth, Ah Leong married three new wives. Dai-Kam was very unhappy about this, but Ah Leong was a charming man, and would talk his way around her. Ah Leong also used his wealth to build huge estates in his home area in China. Tat-Tung supervised construction. After the series of events, the first wife finally decided to take her children and return to China. His third and fourth wives died. Ah Leong was taken into court and fined for cohabitating with too many wives, since none of them were legally married in the United States. The second wife became the only one living in the house, and went behind Ah Leong's back to get a marriage license‚Äîshe was the only wife legally married to him. Ah Leong married another woman, who stayed in China to manage his property there. Dai-Kam returned from China, and in her absence Ah Leong's businesses grew even more. At this time Phoenix comes into the picture. After her arrival she is treated badly until she moves with her husband to a separate house. Tat-Tung is also harassed by his father, who claims that he is cheating him. This ends when Tat-Tung fights back by not coming to work. Then one day Ah Leong cuts his foot while trying to clip his nails with a knife. He believes that it will heal itself, and waits too long to get medical attention. It becomes so infected that doctors say they must amputate, but Ah Leong believes that he must go to death whole, so he dies after refusing the amputation. Before his death he repents making his will such that his second wife's children will inherit. After Lau Ah leong's death there is a lot of fighting over his money by the children of his second wife. At the time of his death in 1934, Ah Leong had amassed a fortune of approximately a million dollars. At first, Tat-Tung and his family are struggling because they no longer have as much money. However, one of his half-brothers eventually gets him a store to manage, and this assures Tat-Tung and Phoenix's future.

Massachusetts dominated the early antislavery movement during the 1830s, motivating activists across the nation. This, in turn, increased sectionalism in the North and South, one of the factors that led to the war. Politicians from Massachusetts, echoing the views of social activists, further increased national tensions. The state was dominated by the Republican Party and was also home to many Radical Republican leaders who promoted harsh treatment of slave owners and, later, the former civilian leaders of the Confederate States of America and the military officers in the Confederate States Army. Once hostilities began, Massachusetts supported the war effort in several significant ways, sending 159,165 men to serve in the Union Army and the Union Navy for the loyal North. One of the best known Massachusetts units was the 54th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry, the first regiment of African American soldiers (led by white officers). Additionally, a number of important generals came from Massachusetts, including Benjamin F. Butler, Joseph Hooker, who commanded the Federal Army of the Potomac in early 1863, as well as Edwin V. Sumner and Darius N. Couch, who both successively commanded the II Corps of the Union Army. In terms of war materiel, Massachusetts, as a leading center of industry and manufacturing, was poised to become a major producer of munitions and supplies. The most important source of armaments in Massachusetts was the Springfield Armory of the United States Department of War. The state also made important contributions to relief efforts. Many leaders of nursing and soldiers' aid organizations hailed from Massachusetts, including Dorothea Dix, founder of the Army Nurses Bureau, the Rev. Henry Whitney Bellows, founder of the United States Sanitary Commission, and independent nurse Clara Barton, future founder of the American Red Cross. Antebellum and wartime politics Grave stone monument of American Civil War era 25th Governor of Massachusetts John Albion Andrew (1818-1867, served 1861-1866), in Hingham, MassachusettsMassachusetts played a major role in the causes of the American Civil War, particularly with regard to the political ramifications of the antislavery abolitionist movement. Antislavery activists in Massachusetts sought to influence public opinion and applied moral and political pressure on the United States Congress to abolish slavery. William Lloyd Garrison (1805-1879), of Boston began publishing the antislavery newspaper The Liberator and founded the New England Anti-Slavery Society in 1831, becoming one of the nation's most influential editors and abolitionists. Garrison and his uncompromising rhetoric provoked a backlash both in the North and South and escalated regional tension prior to the war. By the late 1850s, the antislavery Republican Party became the dominant political organization in several northeastern states. Prominent Republican leaders from Massachusetts included U.S. Senators Charles Sumner and Henry Wilson who espoused Garrison's views and further increased sectionalism. In 1856, Sumner delivered a scathing speech in the United States Senate at the criticizing and insulting pro- slavery southern politicians. This prompted Representative Preston Brooks of South Carolina to later attack Senator Sumner on the Senate floor, severely beating him over the head and shoulders with a cane. Sumner was so severely injured that he did not return to his Senate duties for several months. The incident further heightened sectional tensions. By 1860, the Republicans controlled the Governor's office and the General Court of Massachusetts. During the 1860 presidential election, 63 percent of Massachusetts voters supported Abraham Lincoln and the Republican Party, 20 percent supported Stephen Douglas of the northern wing of the Democratic Party, 13 percent supported John Bell and the temporary third party Constitutional Union Party and 4 percent supported John C. Breckinridge. Support for the Republican Party increased during the war years, with 72 percent voting for Lincoln for reelection in the Election of 1864. The dominant political figure in Massachusetts during the war was 25th Governor John Albion Andrew a staunch Republican who energetically supported the war effort. Massachusetts annually re-elected him by large margins for the duration of the war‚Äîhis smallest margin of victory occurred in 1860 for his first election, with 61 percent of the popular vote and his largest later in 1863 with 71 percent. Recruitment Massachusetts sent a total of 159,165 men to serve in the war. Of these, 133,002 served in the Union army and 26,163 served in the navy. The army units raised in Massachusetts consisted of 62 regiments of infantry, six regiments of cavalry, 16 batteries of light artillery, four regiments of heavy artillery, two companies of sharpshooters, a handful of unattached battalions and 26 unattached companies. =Minutemen of '61= The 6th Massachusetts assaulted in Baltimore, April 19, 1861Governor Andrew took office in January 1861, just two weeks after the secession of South Carolina. Convinced that war was imminent, Andrew took rapid measures to prepare the state militia for active duty. On April 15, 1861, Andrew received a telegraph from Washington calling for 1,500 men from Massachusetts to serve for ninety days. The next day, several companies of the 8th Massachusetts Volunteer Militia from Marblehead, Massachusetts were the first to report in Boston; by the end of the day, three regiments were ready to start for Washington. While passing through Baltimore on April 19, 1861, the 6th Massachusetts was attacked by a pro-secession mob and became the first volunteer troops to suffer casualties in the war. The 6th Massachusetts was also the first volunteer regiment to reach Washington, D.C. in response to Lincoln's call for troops. Lincoln awaited the arrival of additional regiments, but none arrived for several days. Inspecting the 6th Massachusetts on April 24, Lincoln told the soldiers, \\"I don't believe there is any North...You are the only Northern realities.\\" Given that the 6th Massachusetts reached Washington on April 19 (the anniversary of the Battles of Lexington and Concord, which commenced the American Revolutionary War) and other Massachusetts regiments were en route to Washington and Virginia on that date, the first militia units to leave Massachusetts were dubbed, \\"The Minutemen of '61.\\" =Recruiting the three- year regiments= As the initial rush of enthusiasm subsided, the state government faced the ongoing task of recruiting tens of thousands of soldiers to fill federal quotas. The great majority of these troops were required to serve for three years. Recruiting offices were opened in virtually every town and, over the course of 1861, recruits from Massachusetts surpassed the quotas. However, by the summer of 1862, recruiting had slowed considerably. On July 7, 1862, Andrew instituted a system whereby recruitment quotas were issued to every city and town in proportion to their population. This motivated local leaders, increasing enlistment. =28th Massachusetts Infantry= The 28th Massachusetts Infantry Regiment was well known as the fourth regiment of the famed Irish Brigade, commanded by Brig. Gen. Thomas Francis Meagher. It was the second primarily Irish American volunteer infantry regiment recruited in Massachusetts for service in the American Civil War (the first being the 9th Massachusetts). The regiment's motto (or battle-cry) was Faugh a Ballagh (Clear the Way!). The men of the 28th Massachusetts saw action in most of the Union Army's major eastern theater engagements, including Antietam, Fredericksburg, Chancellorsville, Gettysburg, the Overland Campaign, and the Siege of Petersburg. The regiment was present for Gen. Robert E. Lee's surrender to Gen. Ulysses S. Grant at Appomattox Court House. =54th Massachusetts Infantry= 54th Massachusetts (Colored) Infantry One of the best-known regiments formed in Massachusetts was the 54th Massachusetts Infantry, the first regiment in the Union army consisting of African-American soldiers. It was commanded by white officers. With the Emancipation Proclamation in effect as of January 1, 1863, Andrew saw the opportunity for Massachusetts to lead the way in recruiting African-American soldiers. After securing permission from President Lincoln, Andrew, black abolitionist Frederick Douglass and others recruited two regiments of African American soldiers, the 54th and the 55th Massachusetts Infantries. The 54th, because it was the first such regiment, attracted tremendous publicity during its formation. To ensure the success of the experiment, Andrew solicited donations and political support from many of Boston's elite families. He gained the endorsement of Boston's elite by offering the regiment's command to Robert Gould Shaw, son of prominent Bostonians. The 54th Massachusetts won fame in their assault on Battery Wagner on Morris Island in Charleston Harbor, during which Col. Shaw was killed. The story of the 54th Massachusetts was the basis for the 1989 film Glory. =General officers= Maj. Gen. Joseph Hooker from Hadley, MassachusettsGenerals from Massachusetts commanded several army departments, and included a commander of the Army of the Potomac as well as a number of army corps commanders. One of the most prominent generals from Massachusetts was Maj. Gen. Joseph Hooker. Born in Hadley, Massachusetts and a graduate from the United States Military Academy at West Point, he served in the Regular Army during the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War. At the outbreak of the Civil War, he was commissioned brigadier general and steadily rose from brigade commander, to division commander, to commander of the I Corps, which he led during the Battle of Antietam. Following that battle, he was placed in command of the V Corps and then the Center Grand Division of the Army of the Potomac, consisting of the III and V Corps. On January 26, 1863, he was promoted to command of the Army of the Potomac. Although he was successful at reviving the esprit de corps of his army by better distributing supplies and food, he was unable to effectively lead the army in the field, and his inaction during the Battle of Chancellorsville led to his resignation of his command. Transferred to the Department of the Cumberland, he commanded the XI and XII Corps during several western campaigns and distinguished himself during the Battle of Lookout Mountain. Hooker resigned his command upon the promotion of Maj. Gen. Oliver O. Howard to the command of the Army of the Tennessee, a post to which Hooker felt entitled. Hooker served the remainder of the war in an administrative role, overseeing the Department of the North (consisting of army fortifications and troops stationed in Michigan, Ohio, Indiana and Illinois) and the Department of the East (which encompassed installations and troops in New England, New York and New Jersey). Maj. Gen. Nathaniel P. Banks, former governor of Massachusetts, was among the first men appointed major general of volunteers by President Lincoln. In July 1861, Banks came to command the Department of the Shenandoah. In May 1862, he was completely out- generaled by Stonewall Jackson and forced to abandon the Shenandoah Valley. He then commanded the II Corps during the Northern Virginia Campaign and was eventually transferred to command of the Department of the Gulf, coordinating military efforts in Louisiana and Texas. In this capacity, Banks led the successful and strategically important Siege of Port Hudson in the summer of 1863, but also the disastrous Red River Campaign in the spring of 1864, which he commanded under protest. The campaign ended his military career in the field. Another significant general from Massachusetts, Maj. Gen. Edwin Vose Sumner, born in 1797, was the oldest general officer with a field command on either side of the war. He had served in the Regular Army during the Mexican- American war and numerous campaigns in the West. Sumner commanded the II Corps during the Maryland Campaign and later the Right Grand Division of the Army of the Potomac during the Fredericksburg Campaign. Following the Battle of Fredericksburg, he resigned his command in January 1863 and was to be transferred to command the Department of the Missouri, but died of a heart attack en route on March 21, 1863. Other important generals from Massachusetts included Maj. Gen. Darius Couch, who commanded the II Corps and the Department of the Susquehanna, Maj. Gen. John G. Barnard, who organized the defenses of Washington, DC and became Chief Engineer of the Union Armies in the field, and Maj. Gen. Isaac Stevens, who had graduated first in his class at West Point and commanded a division of the IX Corps. War materiel The Springfield Armory, established in 1794The advanced state of industrialization in the North, as compared with the Confederate states, was a major factor in the victory of Union armies. Massachusetts, and the Springfield Armory in particular, played a pivotal role as a supplier of weapons and equipment for the Union army. At the start of the war, the Springfield Armory was one of only two federal armories in the country, the other being the Harpers Ferry Armory. After the attack on Fort Sumter and the commencement of hostilities, Governor Andrew wrote Secretary of War Simon Cameron, urging him to discontinue the Harpers Ferry Armory (which was at that time on Confederate soil) and to channel all available federal funds towards enhancing production at the Springfield Armory. The armory produced the primary weapon of the Union infantry during the war‚Äîthe Springfield rifled musket. By the end of the war, nearly 1.5 million had been produced by the armory and its numerous contractors across the country. Another key source of war materiel was the Watertown Arsenal, which produced ammunition, gun carriages and leather military accouterments. Private companies such as Smith & Wesson enjoyed significant U.S. government contracts. The Ames Manufacturing Company of Chicopee became one of the nation's leading suppliers of swords, side arms, and cannons, and the third largest supplier of heavy ordnance. Although Massachusetts was a major center of shipbuilding prior to the war, many of the established shipbuilding firms were slow to adapt to new technology. The few Massachusetts shipbuilders who received government contracts for the construction of iron-clad, steam powered warships were those who had invested in iron and machine technology before the war. These included the City Point Works, managed by Harrison Loring, and the Atlantic Iron Works, managed by Nelson Curtis, two Boston companies that produced Passaic class monitors during the war. The Boston Navy Yard also produced several smaller gunboats. Relief organizations Clara Barton was an independent battlefield nurse who earned the nickname, \\"The Angel of the Battlefield.\\"Several instrumental leaders of soldiers' aid and relief organizations came from Massachusetts. These included Dorothea Dix, who had traveled across the nation working to promote proper care for the poor and insane before the war. After the outbreak of the war, she convinced the U.S. Army to establish a Women's Nursing Bureau on April 23, 1861 and became the first woman to head a federal government bureau. Although army officials were dubious about the use of female nurses, Dix proceeded to recruit many women who had previously been serving as unorganized volunteers. One of her greatest challenges, given the biases of the era, was to demonstrate that women could serve as competently as men in army hospitals. Dix had a reputation for rejecting nurses who were too young or attractive, believing that patients and surgeons alike would not take them seriously. U.S. Army surgeons often resented the nurses of Dix's bureau, claiming that they were obstinate and did not follow military protocol. Despite such obstacles, Dix was successful at placing female nurses in hospitals throughout the North. Henry Whitney Bellows determined to take a different approach, establishing a civilian organization of nurses separate from the U.S. Army. Bellows was the founder of the United States Sanitary Commission and served as its only president. An influential minister, born and raised in Boston, Bellows went to Washington in May 1861 as head of a delegation of physicians representing the Women's Central Relief Association of New York and other organizations. Bellows's aim was to convince the government to establish a civilian auxiliary branch of the Army Medical Bureau. The Sanitary Commission, established by President Lincoln on June 13, 1861, provided nurses (mostly female) with medical supplies and organized hospital ships and soldiers' homes. Clara Barton, a former teacher from Oxford, Massachusetts and clerk in the U.S. Patent Office, created a one-woman relief effort. In the summer of 1861, in response to a shortage of food and medicine in the growing Union army, she began personally purchasing and distributing supplies to wounded soldiers in Washington. Growing dissatisfied with bringing supplies to hospitals, Barton eventually moved her efforts to the battlefield itself. She was granted access through army lines and helped the wounded in numerous campaigns, soon becoming known as the \\"Angel of the Battlefield.\\" She achieved national prominence, and high-ranking army surgeons requested her assistance in managing their field hospitals. Aftermath and Reconstruction era Antietam Battlefield In all, 12,976 servicemen from Massachusetts died during the war, about eight percent of those who enlisted and about one percent of the state's population (the population of Massachusetts in 1860 was 1,231,066). Official statistics are not available for the number of wounded. Across the nation, organizations such as the Grand Army of the Republic (GAR) were established to provide aid to veterans, widows and orphans. Massachusetts was the first state to organize a statewide Woman's Relief Corps, a female auxiliary organization of the GAR, in 1879. With the war over and his primary goal completed, Governor Andrew declared in September 1865 that he would not seek re-election. Despite this loss, the Republican Party in Massachusetts would become stronger than ever in the post-war years. The Democratic party would be all but non-existent in the Bay State for roughly ten years due to their earlier anti-war platform. The group most affected by this political shift was the growing Boston Irish community, who had backed the Democratic Party and were without significant political voice for decades. After the war, senators Sumner and Wilson would transform their pre-war antislavery views into vehement support for so-called \\"Radical Reconstruction\\" of the South. Their agenda called for civil rights for African Americans and harsh treatment of former Confederates. For a time, the Radical Republicans made progress on their agenda of dramatic reform measures. According to historian Eric Foner, Massachusetts state legislators passed the first comprehensive integration law in the nation's history in 1865. On the national level, Sumner joined with Representative Thaddeus Stevens from Pennsylvania and others to achieve Congressional approval of the Civil Rights Act of 1866, and the 13th, 14th and 15th Amendments to the U.S. Constitution, outlawing slavery and granting increased citizenship rights to former slaves. As early as 1867, however, a national backlash against Radical Republicans and their sweeping civil rights programs made them increasingly unpopular, even in Massachusetts. When Sumner attempted in 1867 to propose dramatic reforms, including integrated schools in the South and re-distribution of land to former slaves, even Wilson refused to support him. By the 1870s, Radical Republicans had diminished in power and Reconstruction proceeded along more moderate lines. Culturally speaking, post-Civil War Massachusetts ceased to be a national center of idealistic reform movements (such as evangelicalism, temperance and antislavery) as it had been before the war. Growing industrialism, partly spurred on by the war, created a new culture of competition and materialism. In 1869, Boston was the site of the National Peace Jubilee, a massive gala to honor veterans and to celebrate the return of peace. Conceived by composer Patrick Gilmore, who had served in an army band, the celebration was held in a colossal arena in Boston's Back Bay neighborhood designed to hold 100,000 attendees and specifically built for the occasion. A new hymn was commissioned for the occasion, written by Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr. and set to American Hymn by Matthais Keller. Spanning five days, the event featured a chorus of nearly 11,000 and an orchestra of more than 500 musicians. It was the largest musical gathering on the continent up to that time.

Fintech has offices in London and New York City, and he currently divides his time between those two cities. Described as \\"the most influential Mexican on Wall Street,\\" Mart√≠nez played a major role in the restructuring of Argentina‚Äôs sovereign debt and described himself in 2013 as having participated in nearly every restructuring of sovereign debt during the previous 25 years. His investments have been characterized as extending ‚Äúfrom New York to Patagonia.‚Äù He is a major holder of assets in Argentina, with Fintech Media LLC, a subsidiary of Fintech Advisory, owning ‚Äúmore than a billion dollars in financial assets‚Äù in Argentina alone. Early life and education David Mart√≠nez was born to Manuel Mart√≠nez and Julia Guzm√°n in Monterrey, Mexico. His family lived an average life until his father inherited a small fortune. Later, Mart√≠nez moved to Rome and enrolled in Legion of Christ Seminary to become a priest. After just six months he decided he was not suited for that vocation. The New York Times has noted that Mart√≠nez's hometown, Monterrey, ‚Äúis home to some of Mexico‚Äôs largest industrial companies,‚Äù with power being ‚Äúheavily concentrated among businessmen in the so-called Group of 10, a club that includes the Sada family.‚Äù Although Mart√≠nez ‚Äúwas not a part of that circle, he has cultivated deep connections to it,‚Äù helping the Sadas in 2004, for example, when one of their firms went bankrupt, and, later, becoming involved in the bankruptcy of the Sada-owned firm Vitro. According to one source, Mart√≠nez's ‚Äúpaternal great great grandmother was the sister of the paternal grandfather of Adrian Sada.‚Äù ‚ÄúAs a young man,‚Äù according to the New York Times, Mart√≠nez ‚Äúwas a member of Regnum Christi, an evangelical group related to the Legionaries of Christ, an influential Roman Catholic order in Mexico that includes among its benefactors the billionaire Carlos Slim.‚Äù After earning a degree in electrical engineering from the Instituto Tecnol√≥gico y de Estudios Superiores de Monterrey (ITESM or Tec de Monterrey), he ‚Äúmoved to Rome to study philosophy at the Pontifical Gregorian University and considered becoming a priest.‚Äù He soon decided, however, that he did not have a clerical vocation, and instead obtained a loan from a friend's father in order to study at Harvard Business School. There he excelled as a student, made important connections, and earned an MBA. Career After receiving his MBA, Mart√≠nez went to work for Citigroup, taking a position on the emerging-markets desk in New York. At Citigroup he began to work ‚Äúwith distressed debt in far-flung places.‚Äù In 1985, he left Citigroup. =Fintech= When he turned 30 in 1987, Mart√≠nez started Fintech, reportedly with the help of a US$300,000 loan from his grandmother, which he was able to repay with interest within a year. One of Mart√≠nez's most notable negotiations involved the restructuring of the debt of the Mexican chemicals and textile conglomerate Celulosa y Derivados, Sociedad An√≥nima (CYDSA), a company that had denied him a job when he was younger. CYDSA agreed to an exchange of debt for equity that would hand control of the company to creditors. Fintech bought US$400 million of CYDSA debt for US$40 million and thereby obtained 60% of the shares, taking control of the company from its founders, the Gonzalez Sada family. =Restructuring of Argentina‚Äôs debt= Mart√≠nez has been heavily involved in the Argentinian economy for many years. In 1994, he ‚Äúinvested in the wrecked Argentinean economy by buying government bonds with a maturity of 37 years for $834 million.‚Äù ‚ÄúFintech was one of the major participants in the exchange of 2005,\\" wrote William Dahill, a lawyer for Mart√≠nez. \\"He realized that the only way‚Äù that Argentina could recover from its economic crisis ‚Äúwould be through a reduction of its liabilities, which would allow the economy to grow and the country regain a minimum level of creditworthiness.‚Äù Between 2004 and 2006, according to Daniel Marx, a former Finance Secretary of Argentina, Mart√≠nez paid $100 million on the secondary market for Argentine bonds with a nominal value of $700 million. His ‚Äúwholesale‚Äù purchase of defaulted Argentinian bonds was considered an act of ‚Äúloyalty‚Äù to Argentina by Kirchner and others. During Argentina's worst economic times, he bought into ‚Äúalmost all‚Äù of the country's large firms, ‚Äúfrom Telecom to Transener.‚Äù Ties to Kirchner family Mart√≠nez has been described as being ‚Äúclosely linked‚Äù to the late Argentinian president Nestor Kirchner and as having been a ‚Äúfriend‚Äù of Kirchner's. According to one source, ‚Äúwhenever the former president traveled to the United States, he made a place in his schedule‚Äù for a meeting with Mart√≠nez. Describing Mart√≠nez as ‚ÄúKirchner‚Äôs Mexican friend,‚Äù Italy's leading newspaper, Corriere della Sera, has noted that the rise in Mart√≠nez's economic fortunes ‚Äúcoincided with the exceptional political cavalcade of the Kirchners after the collapse of the South American country in December 2001.‚Äù It is known that Guillermo Nielsen, then Secretary of Finance under Nestor Kirchner, met Mart√≠nez in Dubai in September 2003 to discuss the restructuring of Argentina's debt, and that the two men met six to 10 more times in New York, London, and elsewhere to continue the conversation. Over time, the ‚Äúrelationship between Mart√≠nez and the Kirchner government became stronger.‚Äù In 2006, Mart√≠nez met Kirchner himself at the Argentine Consulate in New York. Five days later, ‚ÄúMart√≠nez purchased 40 % shares of Cablevisi√≥n , the cable television system of Grupo Clarin, the largest media company in Argentina. Mart√≠nez can be seen sitting in the front row of the audience in a video of the 2007 inauguration of Cristina Fern√°ndez de Kirchner. =Cablevisi√≥n= Mart√≠nez bought Cablevisi√≥n ‚Äúwithout any concern for antitrust legislation,‚Äù and did so at a time when Nestor Kirchner ‚Äúdecided to put his electoral campaign in the hands of Grupo Clarin‚Äù and allowed the purchase by Mart√≠nez of 50% of Cablevisi√≥n. In 2005, Kirchner signed a decree extending broadcast licenses by 10 years; on December 7, 2007, three days before leaving office, he signed a decree permitting the merger of Clarin and Mart√≠nez's Cablevisi√≥n. After Mart√≠nez's purchase of Telecom Argentina, it was noted that his ownership of major stakes in both this firm and Cablevisi√≥n is illegal under Argentinian law. ‚ÄúMart√≠nez could be forced to sell Cablevisi√≥n,‚Äù reported Corriere della Sera. ‚ÄúBut Christina Kirchner will decide.‚Äù As of 2014, he held 40 percent of Cablevisi√≥n. =Vitro= The New York Times reported on October 11, 2012, on Mart√≠nez's involvement in the bankruptcy of Vitro, a 103-year-old Mexican glassmaking firm run by the Sada family, an event that was surrounded by ‚ÄúAllegations‚Ä¶of covert meetings, fraudulent debts and crooked courts‚Äù and that ended up with ‚Äúthe company in the hands of its shareholders, while costing bondholders as much as 60 percent of their investment.‚Äù The Times traced the story to 2009, when Mart√≠nez loaned Vitro $75 million in exchange for the title to several of its properties and an option to return them to Vitro later in exchange for a 24 percent stake in the firm. In 2010, Mart√≠nez ‚Äúwent to the different banks that Vitro owed money to and bought the claims,‚Äù thus becoming the firm's ‚Äúbiggest individual outside creditor, owning about $600 million worth of claims.‚Äù Vitro ‚Äúbegan taking big loans from its subsidiaries, in effect creating a fresh class of creditors outside of the hedge funds ‚Äî a group under its control, with the rights to approve any bankruptcy plan. Subsidiaries went from owing the parent company about $1.2 billion to being owed $1.5 billion.‚Äù With Mart√≠nez's help, Vitro ‚Äúoutvoted many other bondholders to approve a reorganization plan‚Äù that paid creditors about 40 to 60 percent of what they were owed and kept the Sada family in control. In response, American investor Paul Singer‚Äôs firm, Elliott Associates, and other hedge funds, which together owned about $700 million of Vitro‚Äôs old debt, claimed that Mart√≠nez had helped Vitro ‚Äúmuscle investors out of hundreds of millions of dollars through financial sleight of hand,‚Äù and accused Vitro of ‚Äúaudacity, brazen manipulation and greed.‚Äù Singer and the hedge funds sued Vitro and Fintech in the U.S., where a Dallas court ruled in their favor in summer 2012. An appellate court trial began in October. This legal battle, reported the Times, was ‚Äúdrawing back a curtain on Mr. Mart√≠nez‚Äôs secretive world‚Äù and ‚Äúcould have implications for other companies in the world‚Äôs fastest-growing economies.‚Äù Arturo Porzecanski, economist in residence at American University's School of International Service, told the Times that the case ‚Äúhighlighted apparent loopholes in the bankruptcy law of Mexico, through which Vitro ran an 18-wheel truck.‚Äù The Financial Times published an article by Mart√≠nez on March 7, 2013, in which he argued that Judge Griesa's ‚Äúinterference‚Äù might ‚Äúmake future sovereign restructurings impossible, setting a dangerous precedent for the world‚Äôs financial system.‚Äù Succumbing to ‚Äúthe demands of holdout creditors,‚Äù wrote Mart√≠nez, Griesa had ordered the Argentinian government to pay them $1.3 billion. Noting that the ‚Äúall sovereign restructurings‚Äù had been successful ‚Äúpartly because nations have most of their assets protected by law,‚Äù Mart√≠nez characterized ‚Äúholdout creditors‚Äù as ‚Äúfree riders‚Äù whom most nations pay off to avoid harassment; however, ‚ÄúArgentina‚Äôs leadership, which knows how to fight, opted to defend itself against the world‚Äôs most litigious funds, which now want to collect in full. These funds are seeking to reap the benefits of Buenos Aires‚Äô improved payment capacity ‚Äì a result of the losses accepted by the vast majority during the restructuring.‚Äù Mart√≠nez called it a ‚Äúscandal‚Äù that Griesa was forcing this majority ‚Äúto share the interest payments they accepted on their restructured bonds with the minority that litigated,‚Äù an arrangement which would doubly punish ‚Äúthose who contributed in favour of those who did not.‚Äù Mart√≠nez concluded: ‚ÄúNot only is Mr Griesa‚Äôs decision unfair ‚Äì it will also lead to society paying a price in the form of more protracted debt restructurings with less certain outcomes.‚Äù On March 11, the Financial Times ran a reply by Robert Shapiro of American Task Force Argentina, calling Mart√≠nez's article ‚Äúa disservice to the FT‚Äôs readers‚Äù and saying that Argentina's actions ‚Äúpose the real threat to global finance.‚Äù Shapiro explained that since Argentina's 2001 debt default, ‚Äúthe regimes of N√©stor Kirchner and Christina Kirchner Fernandez have rejected every tenet of global finance. They refused to negotiate with bondholders, took four years to issue a ‚Äòtake-it-or-leave-it‚Äô offer of 27 cents on the dollar or barely half the international norm, repudiated the debt of 25 per cent of bondholders who rejected that low-ball offer, and ignored more than 100 directives from US courts to honour their obligations.‚Äù Rejecting Mart√≠nez‚Äôs claim that Griesa had ordered ‚Äúthose who accepted the last restructuring‚Ä¶to ‚Äòshare‚Äô what is owed to them,‚Äù Shapiro stated that Griesa had ‚Äúsimply upheld Argentina‚Äôs own original contract‚Ä¶and noted that under US law the Argentine government cannot choose to pay some creditors and not others.‚Äù Shapiro commented that ‚ÄúThe real victims of the Kirchners‚Äô long campaign to ignore their nation's obligations are the Argentine people,‚Äù and quoted the recent statement by the Argentinian daily La Naci√≥n that ‚ÄúThe main impediment for ending the conflict with the holdouts is that the government is prioritising the media battle with the creditors over channelling its energy towards seeking a technical solution.‚Äù =Banco de Sabadell= In September 2013 it was reported that he had ‚Äúbought 5 percent of Banco Sabadell‚Äù.‚Äù He was appointed member of the Board of Directors on 27 March 2014 (re-elected on 19 April 2018). =Telecom Argentina= Bloomberg News reported on November 14, 2013, that Fintech Group had agreed to pay $860 million for Telecom Italia SpA's 68 percent holding in Sofora Telecomunicaciones, the controlling holding company of Telecom Argentina through Nortel Inversora, plus a direct minority stake, plus $100 million for related assets, for a total of $960 million. This deal pitted him ‚Äúagainst the mobile-phone business of Carlos Slim in South America‚Äôs second- biggest economy‚Äù and ‚Äúexpand[ed] Mart√≠nez‚Äôs bets beyond holdings such as cable assets and Argentina‚Äôs sovereign debt as he seeks to benefit from increasing Web and video use on mobile devices.‚Äù Bloomberg reported that ‚ÄúTelecom Argentina and the local unit of fellow Mexican billionaire Slim‚Äôs America Movil SAB (AMXL) each have about a third of the nation‚Äôs wireless market.‚Äù Noting that ‚ÄúFintech has investments in Argentina‚Äôs sovereign debt as well as in many restructured companies including a stake in the country‚Äôs largest cable company, Cablevisi√≥n SA,‚Äù Bloomberg quoted Mart√≠nez as saying, ‚ÄúWe see tremendous opportunities for growth in the Argentine market and are committed to an important investment program to take advantage of those opportunities.‚Äù A Wall Street Journal article, published on November 10, 2013, described Mart√≠nez's decision to invest in Argentina ‚Äúan unusual call,‚Äù given that ‚ÄúArgentina has been a cautionary tale for many investors since its 2001 default on $100 billion in sovereign debt‚Äù and that its last two presidents, N√©stor Kirchner and Cristina Kirchner, had ‚Äúrepeatedly gone mano a mano with big business,‚Äù nationalizing an oil company and seeking to force the Clarin media group to break up its business. The Journal described Mart√≠nez as ‚Äúpart of a small group of investors who are willing to overlook Argentina's status as a financial pariah and bet long term,‚Äù in the expectation that ‚Äúthe next government to be more pragmatic and less hostile to business.‚Äù =A joint exit= In March 2014 Mart√≠nez called together several representatives of funds with holdings in Argentine bonds, with the intention of beginning to negotiate a joint exit for the bondholders. Jos√© Luis Manzano, a media entrepreneur and former member of the Menem government, was also involved in the negotiations, and both he and Mart√≠nez ‚Äúassured their partners that they had the approval of the Government‚Äù to negotiate a deal. Reportedly, Mart√≠nez had asked JP Morgan to come up with an attractive offer for the bonds. Art collection Specializing in modern and contemporary works, David Mart√≠nez has been reported as also owning pieces by Mark Rothko, Pablo Picasso and Damien Hirst.Scott Reyburn (January 16, 2014), Martinez Is Said to Sell Bacon Estimated at $49 Million Bloomberg. In 2006 he reportedly set a record for the highest price paid for a piece of art with the purchase of a Jackson Pollock painting from David Geffen. Pollock's painting \\"No. 5, 1948\\" sold for US$140 million (¬£73m), on 1 November 2006. However, the auction expert Josh Baer stated that Martinez was not the buyer of the painting. In addition, Shearman & Sterling issued a press release on behalf of its client, David Martinez, to announce that contrary to articles in the press,Azam Ahmed (October 11, 2012), In Fight for a Mexican Company, a Peek Into a Tycoon‚Äôs World New York Times. Martinez does not own the painting or any rights to acquire it. In October 2012, however, the New York Times reported that despite these and other denials, ‚Äúseveral people with knowledge of‚Äù Mart√≠nez's collection have said that the Pollock work hangs in his New York apartment. Mart√≠nez was identified as the seller of a Mark Rothko's Untitled (1961) at Sotheby's in a 2010 lawsuit against him by Dallas art collector Marguerite Hoffman, who claimed breach of contract. Hoffman sold him the work privately in 2007 for a net $17.6 million, forgoing the $30 million to $40 million she said the painting could have fetched at public auction. She later said the deal's privacy agreement was broken when Studio Capital Inc., a Belize-registered companyMark Maremont (December 20, 2013), Art Figures Violated Secrecy Agreement Surrounding Rothko Sale, Jury Finds Wall Street Journal. she claimed is controlled by Mart√≠nez ‚Äúfor the purpose of maintaining the secrecy of his purchases and sales of art,‚Äù entered the Rothko in Sotheby's May 2010 auction in New York and marketing materials revealed her prior ownership. She claimed she could have sold the painting at auction herself and received far more, had she not wanted secrecy. The painting was auctioned for $31.4 million. Mart√≠nez was included in the 2012 ARTnews list of the world's 200 Top Collectors. In 2014, he sold Francis Bacon's Portrait of George Dyer Talking (1966), for $70 million to an American collector at Christie's London.Carol Vogel (February 13, 2014), Francis Bacon Work Sells for $70 Million at Christie‚Äôs Auction New York Times.

Has a two-story living room and a reflecting pool,‚Äù and a ‚Äúspecial system has been rigged to support one exceptionally heavy piece of art.‚Äù The Mexican media refer to Mart√≠nez as a ‚Äúghost investor.‚Äù One source calls him ‚Äúa discreet man‚Äù who despite his massive investments remains widely ‚Äúunknown.‚Äù Reportedly, only one photograph of him can be found on the Internet, which was taken by Kirchner's photographer, Bugge Victor, the official photographer for Argentina presidency, at Argentina's consulate in New York. ‚ÄúThere is barely any news about his moves, or pictures of him on the Internet,‚Äù reported IB Times. ‚ÄúThere is no estimate of his wealth, although many have said that he is following in the footsteps of fellow Mexican tycoon Carlos Slim to become the richest man in the world.‚Äù According to the New York Times, ‚ÄúMart√≠nez is, even to his associates, something of a mystery,‚Äù a man about whom ‚ÄúLittle is known‚Ä¶.In life as in business, Mr. Mart√≠nez treads lightly. He is fond of shell companies, whether to buy artwork or to pay household expenses. Those he hires often know him only as ‚Äòthe client.‚Äô‚Äù Noting that ‚Äúit is unclear‚Äù how much money Fintech controls, ‚Äúor even how many employees work there,‚Äù the Times has reported that when Elliott Associates and other funds sought to sue Fintech, they ‚Äúencountered one obstacle early on: they couldn‚Äôt find Mr. Mart√≠nez,‚Äù either at Fintech's Park Avenue offices or at his Time Warner Center apartment. Mart√≠nez reportedly ‚Äútravels to Monterrey every Christmas to be with his mother, Juliana Guzman Sepulveda, and his sister, Beatriz Mart√≠nez Guzm√°n.‚Äù In 1997 he ‚Äúbought a plot of 874 square meters in the municipality of San Pedro Garza Garcia,‚Äù on which his mother now lives.

It joined with six other southern slave-holding states to form the Confederacy on February 4, 1861. Mississippi's location along the lengthy Mississippi River made it strategically important to both the Union and the Confederacy; dozens of battles were fought in the state as armies repeatedly clashed near key towns and transportation nodes. Mississippian troops fought in every major theater of the American Civil War, although most were concentrated in the Western Theater. Confederate president Jefferson Davis was a Mississippian politician and operated a large slave cotton plantation there. Prominent Mississippian generals during the war included William Barksdale, Carnot Posey, Wirt Adams, Earl Van Dorn, Robert Lowry, and Benjamin G. Humphreys. Secession and Mississippian politics For years prior to the American Civil War, slave- holding Mississippi had voted heavily for the Democrats, especially as the Whigs declined in their influence. During the 1860 presidential election, the state supported Southern Democrat candidate John C. Breckinridge, giving him 40,768 votes (59.0% of the total of 69,095 ballots cast). John Bell, the candidate of the Constitutional Union Party, came in a distant second with 25,045 votes (36.25% of the total), with Stephen A. Douglas, a northern Democrat, receiving 3,282 votes (4.75%). Abraham Lincoln, who won the national election, was not on the ballot in Mississippi. According to one Mississippian newspaper in the late 1850s: Long a hotbed of secessionist sentiment, support for slavery, and southern states' rights, Mississippi declared its secession from the United States on January 9, 1861, two months after the Republican Party's victory in the U.S. presidential election. The state then joined the Confederacy less than a month later, issuing a declaration of their reasons for seceding, proclaiming that \\"[o]ur position is thoroughly identified with the institution of slavery--the greatest material interest of the world\\". Fulton Anderson, a Mississippian lawyer, delivered a speech to the Virginian secession convention in 1861, in which he declared that \\"grievances of the Southern people on the slavery question\\" and their opposition to the Republican Party's goal of \\"the ultimate extinction of slavery\\" were the primary catalysts of the state in declaring secession. Mississippian judge Alexander Hamilton Handy also shared this view, opining of the \\"black\\" Republican Party that: Along with South Carolina, Mississippi was one of only two states in the Union in 1860 in which the majority of the state's population were slaves.University of Virginia Library Historical Census Browser According to Mississippian Democrat and future Confederate leader Jefferson Davis, Mississippi joined the Confederacy because it \\"has heard proclaimed the theory that all men are created free and equal\\", a sentiment perceived as being threatening to slavery, and because the \\"Declaration of Independence has been invoked to maintain the position of the equality of the races\\", a position that Davis was opposed to. William L. Harris, one Mississippian secession commissioner, told a meeting of the Georgian general assembly that the Republicans wanted to implement \\"equality between the white and negro races\\" and thus secession was necessary for the slave states to resist their efforts. Fulton Anderson, another Mississippian, told the Virginian secession convention that the Republicans were hostile to the slave states themselves, thus accusing the Republican Party of having an \\"unrelenting and eternal hostility to the institution of slavery.\\" Enlistment Although there were small pockets of citizens who remained sympathetic to the Union, most famously in Jones County,Victoria E. Bynum, The Free State of Jones: Mississippi's Longest Civil War (2003). the vast majority of white Mississippians embraced slavery and the Confederate cause. Thousands flocked to join the Confederate military. Around 80,000 white men from Mississippi fought in the Confederate army; whereas some 500 white Mississippians remained loyal to the U.S. and fought for the Union. As the war progressed, a considerable number of freed or escaped slaves joined the United States Colored Troops and similar black regiments. More than 17,000 black Mississippian slaves and freedmen fought for the Union.Mississippi Soldiers in the Civil War There were regional variations, as Logue shows. almost all soldiers were volunteers. The likelihood of a man volunteering for service increased with a person's amount of personal property owned, including slaves. Poor men were less likely to volunteer. Men living near the Mississippi River, regardless of their wealth or other characteristics, were less likely to join the army than were those living in the state's interior. Many military-age men in these western counties had moved elsewhere. Union control of the Mississippi River made its neighbors especially vulnerable, and river-county residents apparently left their communities (and often the Confederacy) rather than face invasion.Larry M. Logue, \\"Who joined the Confederate army? Soldiers, civilians, and communities in Mississippi.\\" Journal of social history (1993): 611-623. Emancipation of slaves Portions of northwestern Mississippi were under Union control on January 1, 1863, when the Emancipation Proclamation went into effect. All of Mississippi had been declared \\"in rebellion\\" in the Proclamation, and Union forces accordingly began to free slaves in the U.S.-controlled areas of Mississippi at once.Ira Berlin et al., eds, Freedom: A Documentary History of Emancipation 1861‚Äì1867, Vol. 1: The Destruction of Slavery (Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press, 1985), p. 260 According to one Confederate lieutenant from Mississippi, slavery was the cause for which the state declared secession from the Union, saying that \\"This country without slave labor would be completely worthless ... We can only live & exist by that species of labor: and hence I am willing to fight to the last.\\" Mississippian towns during the war =Corinth= Corinth's location at the junction of two railroads made it strategically important. Confederate General P.G.T. Beauregard retreated there after the Battle of Shiloh, pursued by Union Maj. Gen. Henry W. Halleck. Beauregard abandoned the town when Halleck approached, letting it fall into Union hands. Since Halleck approached so cautiously, digging entrenchments at every stop for over a month, this action has been known as the Siege of Corinth. Maj. Gen. William Rosecrans moved to Corinth as well and concentrated his force with Halleck later in the year to again attack the city. The Battle of Corinth took place on October 3‚Äì4, 1862, when Confederate Maj. Gen. Earl Van Dorn attempted to retake the city. The Confederate troops won back the city but were quickly forced out when Union reinforcements arrived. Oxford On August 22, 1864 the city of Oxford, MS was burned to the ground by General A.J. Smith. Only the University of Mississippi and two shops were left standing. This action was taken because Nathan Bedford Forrest had taken refuge in Oxford. =Jackson= Despite its small population, Jackson became a strategic center of manufacturing for the Confederacy. In 1863, during the campaign which ended in the capture of Vicksburg, Union forces captured Jackson during two battles‚Äîonce before the fall of Vicksburg and again soon after its fall. On May 13, 1863, Union forces won the first Battle of Jackson, forcing Confederate forces to flee northward towards Canton. Subsequently, on May 15 Union troops under William Tecumseh Sherman burned and looted key facilities in Jackson. After driving the Confederates out of Jackson, Union forces turned west once again and soon placed Vicksburg under siege. Confederates began to reassemble in Jackson in preparation for an attempt to break through the Union lines now surrounding Vicksburg. Confederates marched out of Jackson to break the siege in early July. However, unknown to them, Vicksburg had already surrendered on July 4. Union Army general Ulysses S. Grant dispatched Sherman to meet the Confederate forces. Upon learning that Vicksburg had already surrendered, the Confederates retreated back into Jackson, thus beginning the Siege of Jackson, which lasted for approximately one week before the town fell. =Natchez= During the American Civil War, the Mississippian city of Natchez remained largely undamaged. The city surrendered to Flag-Officer David G. Farragut after the fall of New Orleans in May 1862. Mahan, A.T., Capt. USN. The Navy in the Civil War. Sampson Low, Marston, & Company, Ltd. London, UK. 1898. One civilian, an elderly man, was killed during the war, when in September 1863, a Union ironclad shelled the town from the river and he promptly died of a heart attack. Union soldiers sent by Ulysses S. Grant from Vicksburg occupied Natchez in 1863. The local commander, General Thomas Ransom, established headquarters at a home called Rosalie. \\"A Brief History of Rosalie Mansion\\" , Official Website Ellen Shields's memoir reveals a Confederate woman's reactions to Union occupation of the city. Shields was a member of the local elite and her memoir points to the upheaval of Confederate society during the war. According to historian Joyce Broussard, Shields's memoir indicates that Confederate men, absent because of the war, were seen to have failed in their homes and in the wider community, forcing the women to use their class-based femininity and their sexuality to deal with the Union Army.Joyce L.. Broussard, \\"Occupied Natchez, Elite Women, and the Feminization of the Civil War,\\" Journal of Mississippi History, Summer 2008, Vol. 70 Issue 2, pp 179‚Äì208 The 340 planters who each owned 250 or more slaves in the Natchez region in 1860 were not enthusiastic Confederates. The support these slaveholders had for the Confederacy was problematic because they were fairly recent arrivals to the Confederacy, opposed secession, and held social and economic ties to the Union. These elite planters also lacked a strong emotional attachment to the idea of a Southern nation; however, when the war started, many of their sons and nephews joined the Confederate army.William K. Scarborough, \\"Not Quite Southern,\\" Prologue, Winter 2004, Vol. 36 Issue 4, pp 20‚Äì29 On the other hand, Charles Dahlgren arrived from Philadelphia and made his fortune before the war. He did support the Confederacy and led a brigade, but was sharply criticized for failing to defend the Gulf Coast. When the Union Army came he moved to Georgia for the duration. He returned in 1865 but never recouped his fortune; He went bankrupt and in 1870 he gave up and moved to New York City.Herschel Gower, Charles Dahlgren of Natchez: The Civil War and Dynastic Decline (2003) Bishop Elder of Natchez A few residents showed their defiance of Union authorities. In 1864, the Catholic bishop of the Diocese of Natchez, William Henry Elder, refused to obey a Union order to compel his parishioners to pray for the U.S. president. In response, Union forces arrested Elder, convicted him, and jailed him briefly. The memory of the war remains important for the city, as white Natchez became much more pro-Confederate after the war. The Lost Cause myth arose as a means for coming to terms with the Confederacy's defeat. It quickly became a definitive ideology, strengthened by its celebratory activities, speeches, clubs, and statues. The major organizations dedicated to maintaining the tradition were the United Confederate Veterans and the United Daughters of the Confederacy. At Natchez, although the local newspapers and veterans played a role in the maintenance of the Lost Cause, elite women particularly were important, especially in establishing memorials such as the Civil War Monument dedicated on Memorial Day 1890. The Lost Cause enabled women noncombatants to lay a claim to the central event in their redefinition of Southern history.Melody Kubassek, \\"Ask Us Not to Forget: The Lost Cause in Natchez, Mississippi,\\" Southern Studies, 1992, Vol. 3 Issue 3, pp 155‚Äì170 =Vicksburg= Vicksburg was the site of the Battle of Vicksburg, a decisive victory as the Union forces gained control of the entire Mississippi River and cut the western states off. The battle consisted of a long siege, which was necessary because the town was on high ground, well fortified, and difficult to attack directly. The hardships of the civilians were extreme during the siege, with heavy shelling and starvation all around.Peter Franklin Walker, Vicksburg: a people at war, 1860‚Äì1865 (Broadfoot, 1960). Some 30,000 Confederates surrendered during the long campaign, but rather than being sent to prison camps, they were paroled and sent home until they could be exchanged for Union prisoners.Terry Whittington, \\"In the Shadow of Defeat: Tracking the Vicksburg Parolees.\\" Journal of Mississippi History 4 (Winter, 2002): 307-330. =Greenville= Greenville was a pivotal village for Grant's northern operations in Mississippi during the Vicksburg campaign. The area of the Delta surrounding Greenville was considered the \\"breadbasket\\" for providing Vicksburg's military with corn, hogs, beef, mules and horses. Beginning at the end of March 1863, Greenville was the target of General Frederick Steele's Expedition. The design of this expedition was to reconnoiter Deer Creek as a possible route to Vicksburg and to create havoc and cause damage to confederate soldiers, guerrillas, and loyal (Confederate) landowners. Highly successful, Steele's men seized almost 1000 head of livestock (horses, mules, and cattle) and burned 500,000 bushels of corn during their foray.\\"War of the Rebellion: A Compilation of the Official Records of the Union and Confederate Armies\\" (O.R.) Series I, Vol XXIV, Pt I, p 502. In addition to the damage done, the Union soldiers also acquired several hundred slaves, who, wishing to escape the bonds of slavery left their plantations and followed the troops from Rolling Fork back to Greenville. It was at this time that General Ulysses S. Grant determined that if any of the slaves chose to do so, they could cross the Union lines and become U.S. soldiers. The first black regiments were formed during the Greenville expedition, and by the end of the expedition nearly 500 ex-slaves were learning the \\"school of the soldier.\\" General Steele's activity in the delta around Greenville pulled the attention of the Confederate leaders away from the Union activities on the Louisiana side of the Mississippi River as they moved on Vicksburg. More importantly, it had serious consequences for the people and soldiers of Vicksburg who were now deprived of a most important source of supplies, food, and animals. In early May, as retaliation for Confederate artillery firing on shipping on the Mississippi River, Commander Selfridge of the U.S. Navy ordered ashore 67 marines and 30 sailors, landing near Chicot Island. Their orders were to \\"put to the torch\\" all homes and buildings of those citizens guilty of aiding and abetting Confederate forces. By the end of the day of May 9, the large and imposing mansions, barns, stables, cotton gins, overseer dwellings and slave quarters of the Blanton and Roach plantations were in ruins. Additional damage was done to Argyle Landing and Chicot Island and other houses, barns and outbuildings. The destruction of Greenville was completed on May 6 when a number of Union infantrymen slipped ashore from their boats and burned every building in the village but two (a house and a church).\\"War of the Rebellion: A Compilation of the Official Records of the Union and Confederate Armies\\" (O.R.) Series I, Vol XXIV, Pt II, p 144.Diary of Lt. Geo Hale, 33rd WisconsinDiary of Lt. Anthony Burton, 5th battery, Ohio Artillery =Choctaw County= During the war, Choctaw County Unionists formed a \\"Loyal League\\" allied with the U.S. to \\"break up the war by advising desertion, robbing the families of those who remained in the army, and keeping the Federal authorities advised.\\" =Others= Columbus was an important hospital town early in the war. Columbus also had an arsenal that produced gunpowder as well as cannons and handguns. Columbus was targeted by the Union on at least two different occasions, but Union commanders failed to attack the town, due to the activities of Nathan Bedford Forrest and his men. Many of the casualties from the Battle of Shiloh were brought there, and thousands were buried in the town's Friendship Cemetery. Canton was an important rail and logistics center. Many wounded soldiers were treated in or transported through the city, and, as a consequence, it too has a large Confederate cemetery. Meridian's strategic position at a major railroad junction made it the home of a Confederate arsenal, military hospital, and prisoner-of-war stockade, as well as the headquarters for a number of state offices. The disastrous Chunky Creek Train Wreck of 1863 happened 30 miles from Meridian, when the train was en route to the Vicksburg battle. After the Vicksburg campaign, Sherman's Union forces turned eastward. In February 1864, his army reached Meridian, where they destroyed the railroads and burned much of the area to the ground. After completing this task, Sherman is reputed to have said, \\"Meridian no longer exists.\\" A makeshift shipyard was established on the Yazoo River at Yazoo City after the Confederate loss of New Orleans. The shipyard was destroyed by Union forces in 1863. Then, Yazoo City fell back into Confederate hands. Union forces retook the city the following year and burned most of the buildings in the city.

She and two of her cousins were known as the \\"Cary Invincibles\\"; the three sewed the first examples of the Confederate Battle Flag. Harrison belonged to an old Virginia family related to the Fairfaxes and Jeffersons. Her home was destroyed during the American Civil War and consequently she witnessed much of the horrors of that struggle. After its close, she accompanied her mother to Europe and while in France. Upon her return to the United States, She married Burton Harrison, a lawyer and American democratic politician, who was at one time the Secretary of President Jefferson Davis. They moved to New York in 1876, and there she began her literary life. Harrison's first magazine article was A Little Centennial Lady, which attracted much attention, and thereafter, she wrote a great deal. Few literary women in New York were better known at the time, her home a social and literary center. She produced several plays, chiefly adaptations from the French. The work that probably gained her more reputation abroad was The Anglomaniacs, which appeared in The Century without her name. It ranked her at once among the best of the novelists. Some of her other works included, Golden Rod, The Story of Helen Troy, Woman's Handiwork in Modern Houses, Old- Fashioned Fairy Book, Bric-a-Brac Stories, Flower de Hundred, Miy Lord Fairfax of Greenway Court, The Homes and Haunts of Washington, The Russian Honeymoon, Sweet Bells Out of Tune, A Daughter of the South and Other Tales, Bar Harbor Days, and An edelweiss of the Sierras, Golden-rod, and other tales. Origins Constance Fairfax Cary was born at Port Gibson, Mississippi,\\"Mrs. Constance Cary Harrison,\\" in April 25, 1843 (or 1846) into a planter aristocrat family, to Archibald Cary and Monimia Fairfax. Archibald Cary was the son of Wilson Jefferson Cary and Virginia Randolph. Wilson Jefferson Cary was a descendant of the ancient and prominent English gentry family of Cary, lords of the manor of Clovelly in Devon and of Cockington and Tor Abbey, as is related in a genealogical work by Fairfax Harrison (1869-1938) of Belvoir House, Fauquier County, Virginia (son of Constance Cary Harrison) The Devon Carys, 2 vols., New York, 1920.https://archive.org/details/devoncarys01harr/page/n1/mode/2up Monimia Fairfax was the daughter of Thomas Fairfax, 9th Lord Fairfax of Cameron, and Margaret Herbert who was the granddaughter of John Carlyle and Sarah Fairfax. Her brother was Clarence Cary, who was prominent in New York society. Archibald Cary was a subscriber to the Monticello Graveyard (1837). They lived at Cumberland, Maryland, where he was editor of its leading newspaper, The Cumberland Civilian. When he died in 1854, her mother, Monimia, moved the family, in with her grandmother at Vaucluse Plantation in Fairfax County, Virginia, until the outbreak of the Civil War. Civil War years Confederate flag sewn by Constance Cary (reverse). Cary sewed her name on the blue stripe in the lower right of the flag After the seizure of Vaucluse and its demolition (to construct Fort Worth, as a part of the defenses of Washington, D.C.) she lived in Richmond, Virginia during the American Civil War and moved in the same set as Varina Davis, Mary Boykin Chesnut, and Virginia Clay- Clopton. She was published in Southern magazines under the pen name \\"Refugitta.\\" Constance Cary lived with her Baltimore cousins, Hetty and Jennie; her mother served as the girls' chaperone. The three young ladies became known as the \\"Cary Invincibles.\\" In September 1861, they sewed the first examples of the Confederate Battle Flag following a design created by William Porcher Miles and modified by General Joseph E. Johnston. According to her own account, one flag was given to General Joseph E. Johnston, one to Confederate general P. G. T. Beauregard, and hers to Confederate general Earl Van Dorn.Constance Cary Harrison, \\"Virginia Scenes in '61,\\" in 165. Later during the war, she assisted her mother as a nurse at Camp Winder. She later met Burton Harrison (1838‚Äì1904), a private secretary for Confederate President Jefferson Davis, and helped win his release from Fort Delaware after the war's end. After the war Harrison and her mother spent the winter of 1865 in Paris before returning to New York City in 1866. She and Burton Harrison were married on November 26, 1867, at St. Anne's Church, in Westchester County, New York. Their wedding breakfast was at Morrisania, the country home of her uncle, Gouverneur Morris. Burton Harrison held various public offices while Constance spent her time writing and being involved in the city's social scene. They were the parents of Fairfax Harrison (March 13, 1869 - February 2, 1938), who was a President of the Southern Railway Company, and Francis Burton Harrison (December 13, 1873- November 22, 1957), who served as a Governor- General of the Philippines. Among her other contributions to American literature, Constance Cary Harrison persuaded her friend Emma Lazarus to donate a poem to the fundraising effort to pay for a pedestal for the Statue of Liberty.Harrison, Recollections Grave and Gay, 314. In 1871, the Harrisons first visited Bar Harbor, Mount Desert Island, Maine, staying at the cottage of Captain Royal George Higgins.Harrison, Recollections Grave and Gay, 349. Sometime in the 1880s, they commissioned Arthur Rotch of the architectural firm Rotch & Tilden to build a seaside cottage called Sea Urchins, with a garden designed by Beatrix Farrand.http://www.coa.edu/assets/landscapemasterplan07/sitehistory.pdf The property now is owned by the College of the Atlantic, transformed into Deering Common, student center. Sea Urchins was the center of hospitality during the \\"Gilded Age\\" in Bar Harbor and she entertained many noted visitors there, including friend and neighbor James G. Blaine, who lived at Stanwood. The Harrisons' winter home was a mansion on East 29th Street, New York. Constance Cary Harrison died in Washington, D.C., in 1920, at the age of 77.

The bombardment of the beleaguered U.S. garrison at Fort Sumter in Charleston Harbor on April 12, 1861 is generally recognized as the first military engagement of the war. South Carolina was a source of troops for the Confederate army, and as the war progressed, also for the Union, as thousands of ex-slaves flocked to join the Union (the state had more slaves than freemen at the war's outset). The state also provided uniforms, textiles, food, and war material, as well as trained soldiers and leaders from The Citadel and other military schools. In contrast to most other Confederate states, South Carolina had a well-developed rail network linking all of its major cities without a break of gauge. Relatively free from Union occupation until the very end of the war, South Carolina hosted a number of prisoner of war camps. South Carolina also was the only Confederate state not to harbor pockets of anti- secessionist fervor strong enough to send large numbers of white men to fight for the Union, as every other state in the Confederacy did. Among the leading generals from the Palmetto State were Wade Hampton III, one of the Confederacy's foremost cavalry commanders, Maxcy Gregg, killed in action at Fredericksburg, Joseph B. Kershaw, whose South Carolina infantry brigade saw some of the hardest fighting of the Army of Northern Virginia and James Longstreet, the senior lieutenant general in the army, and Stephen D. Lee, the youngest lieutenant general. Background The white population of the state had strongly supported the institution of slavery since the 18th century. Political leaders such as Democrats John Calhoun and Preston Brooks had inflamed regional and national passions in support of the institution, and many pro-slavery voices had cried for secession. On the outbreak of war, South Carolina had the highest percentage of slaves of any U.S. state at 57% of its population enslaved; 46% of its white families owned at least one slave. For decades, South Carolinian political leaders had promoted regional passions with threats of nullification and secession in the name of southern states' rights and protection of the interests of the slave power.

Aldrich, a South Carolinian politician from Barnwell, stated that declaring secession would be necessary if a Republican candidate were to win the 1860 U.S. presidential election, stating that it was the only way for the state to preserve slavery and diminish the influence of the anti-slavery Republican Party, which, were its goals of abolition realized, would result in the \\"destruction of the South\\": In a January 1860 speech, South Carolinian congressman Laurence Massillon Keitt, summed up this view in an oratory condemning the \\"anti-slavery party\\" (i.e. the Republican Party) for its views against slavery. He claimed that slavery was not morally wrong, but rather, justified: Later that year, in December, Keitt would state that South Carolina's declaring of secession was the direct result of slavery: Secession On November 9, 1860 the South Carolina General Assembly passed a \\"Resolution to Call the Election of Abraham Lincoln as U.S. President a Hostile Act\\" and stated its intention to declare secession from the United States.\\"Resolution to Call the Election of Abraham Lincoln as U.S. President a Hostile Act and to Communicate to Other Southern States South Carolina's Desire to Secede from the Union.\\" 9 November 1860. Resolutions of the General Assembly, 1779‚Äì1879. S165018. South Carolina Department of Archives and History, Columbia, South Carolina. In December 1860, amid the secession crisis, former South Carolinian congressman John McQueen wrote to a group of civic leaders in Richmond, Virginia, regarding the reasons as to why South Carolina was contemplating secession from the United States. In the letter, McQueen claimed that U.S. president-elect Abraham Lincoln supported equality and civil rights for African Americans as well as the abolition of slavery, and thus South Carolina, being opposed to such measures, was compelled to secede: South Carolinian Presbyterian minister James Henley Thornwell also espoused a similar view to McQueen's, stating that slavery was justified under the Christian religion, and thus, those who viewed slavery as being immoral were opposed to Christianity: And again, the Southern Presbyterian of S.C. declared that: On November 10, 1860 the S.C. General Assembly called for a \\"Convention of the People of South Carolina\\" to consider secession. Delegates were to be elected on December 6.Cauthen, Charles Edward; Power, J. Tracy. South Carolina goes to war, 1860‚Äì1865. Columbia, SC: University of South Carolina Press, 2005. Originally published: Chapel Hill, NC: University of North Carolina Press, 1950. . p. 60. The secession convention convened in Columbia on December 17 and voted unanimously, 169-0, to declare secession from the United States. The convention then adjourned to Charleston to draft an ordinance of secession. When the ordinance was adopted on December 20, 1860, South Carolina became the first slave state in the south to declare that it had seceded from the United States. James Buchanan, the United States president, declared the ordinance illegal but did not act to stop it. A committee of the convention also drafted a Declaration of the Immediate Causes Which Induce and Justify the Secession of South Carolina which was adopted on December 24. The secession declaration stated the primary reasoning behind South Carolina's declaring of secession from the U.S., which was described as: The declaration also claims that secession was declared as a result of the refusal of free states to enforce the Fugitive Slave Acts. Although the declaration does argue that secession is justified on the grounds of U.S. \\"encroachments upon the reserved rights of the States,\\" the grievances that the declaration goes on to list are mainly concerned with the property of rights of slave holders. Broadly speaking, the declaration argues that the U.S. Constitution was framed to establish each State \\"as an equal\\" in the Union, with \\"separate control over its own institutions\\", such as \\"the right of property in slaves.\\" A repeated concern is runaway slaves. The declaration argues that parts of the U.S. Constitution were specifically written to ensure the return of slaves who had escaped to other states, and quotes the 4th Article: \\"No person held to service or labor in one State, under the laws thereof, escaping into another, shall, in consequence of any law or regulation therein, be discharged from such service or labor, but shall be delivered up, on claim of the party to whom such service or labor may be due.\\" The declaration goes on to state that this stipulation of the Constitution was so important to the original signers, \\"that without it that compact [the Constitution] would not have been made.\\" Laws from the \\"General Government\\" upheld this stipulation \\"for many years,\\" the declaration says, but \\"an increasing hostility on the part of the non-slaveholding States to the Institution of Slavery has led to a disregard of their obligations.\\" Because the constitutional agreement had been \\"deliberately broken and disregarded by the non-slaveholding States,\\" the consequence was that \\"South Carolina is released from her obligation\\" to be part of the Union. A further concern was Lincoln's recent election to the presidency, whom they claimed desired to see slavery on \\"the course of ultimate extinction\\": The South Carolinian secession declaration of December 1860 also channeled some elements from the U.S. Declaration of Independence from July 1776. However, the South Carolinian version omitted the phrases that \\"all men are created equal\\", \\"that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights\\", and mentions of the \\"consent of the governed\\". Professor and historian Harry V. Jaffa noted these omissions as significant in his 2000 book, A New Birth of Freedom: Abraham Lincoln and the Coming of the Civil War: Jaffa states that South Carolina omitted references to human equality and consent of the governed in its secession declaration, as due to their racist and pro-slavery views, secessionist South Carolinians did not believe in those ideals: On December 25, the day following South Carolina's declaration of secession, a South Carolinian convention delivered an \\"Address to the Slaveholding States\\": \\"Slavery, not states' rights, birthed the Civil War,\\" argues sociologist James W. Loewen. Writing of South Carolina's Declaration of Secession, Loewen writes that The state adopted the palmetto flag as its banner, a slightly modified version of which is used as its current state flag.Edgar, Walter. South Carolina: A History, Columbia, SC: University of South Carolina Press:1998. . p. 619 South Carolina after secession was frequently called the \\"Palmetto Republic\\".Cauthen, Charles Edward; Power, J. Tracy. South Carolina goes to war, 1860‚Äì1865. Columbia, SC: University of South Carolina Press, 2005. Originally published: Chapel Hill, NC: University of North Carolina Press, 1950. . p. 79. After South Carolina declared its secession, former congressman James L. Petigru famously remarked, \\"South Carolina is too small for a republic and too large for an insane asylum.\\" Paragraph 4 Soon afterwards, South Carolina began preparing for a presumed U.S. military response while working to convince other southern states to secede as well and join in a confederacy of southern states. On February 4, 1861, in Montgomery, Alabama, a convention consisting of delegates from South Carolina, Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, Georgia, and Louisiana met to form a new constitution and government modeled on that of the United States.Lee, Jr., Charles Robert. The Confederate Constitutions. Chapel Hill, NC: The University of North Carolina Press, 1963, 60. On February 8, 1861, South Carolina officially joined the Confederacy. According to one South Carolinian newspaper editor: South Carolina's declaring of secession was supported by the state's religious figures, who claimed that it was consistent with the tenets of their religion: American Civil War 1862 U.S. Coast Survey map of the Coast of South Carolina from Charleston to Hilton Head =Fort Sumter= Confederate flag after the fort's capture from the U.S. by the Confederacy. Six days after secession, on the day after Christmas, Major Robert Anderson, commander of the U.S. troops in Charleston, withdrew his men to the island fortress of Fort Sumter in Charleston Harbor. South Carolina militia swarmed over the abandoned mainland batteries and trained their guns on the island. Sumter was the key position for preventing a naval attack upon Charleston, so secessionists were determined not to allow U.S. forces to remain there indefinitely. More importantly, South Carolina's claim of independence would look empty if U.S. forces controlled its largest harbor. On January 9, 1861, the U.S. ship Star of the West approached to resupply the fort. Cadets from The Citadel, The Military College of South Carolina fired upon the Star of the West, striking the ship three times and causing it to retreat back to New York. Mississippi declared its secession several weeks after South Carolina, and five other states of the lower South soon followed. Both the outgoing Buchanan administration and President-elect Lincoln had denied that any state had a right to secede. Upper Southern slave states such as Virginia and North Carolina, which had initially voted against secession, called a peace conference, to little effect. Meanwhile, Virginian orator Roger Pryor barreled into Charleston and proclaimed that the only way to get his state to join the Confederacy was for South Carolina to instigate war with the United States. The obvious place to start was right in the midst of Charleston Harbor. On April 10, the Mercury reprinted stories from New York papers that told of a naval expedition that had been sent southward toward Charleston. Lincoln advised the governor of South Carolina that the ships were sent to resupply the fort, not to reinforce it. The Carolinians could no longer wait if they hoped to take the fort before the U.S. Navy arrived. About 6,000 men were stationed around the rim of the harbor, ready to take on the 60 men in Fort Sumter. At 4:30 a.m. on April 12, after two days of intense negotiations, and with Union ships approaching the harbor, the firing began. Students from The Citadel were among those firing the first shots of the war, though Edmund Ruffin is usually credited with firing the first shot. Thirty-four hours later, Anderson's men raised the white flag and were allowed to leave the fort with colors flying and drums beating, saluting the U.S. flag with a 50-gun salute before taking it down. During this salute, one of the guns exploded, killing a young soldier‚Äîthe only casualty of the bombardment and the first casualty of the war. In December 1861, South Carolina received $100,000 from Georgia after a disastrous fire in Charleston. =Fort Wagner= Fort Wagner was the scene of two battles. The First Battle of Fort Wagner, occurred on July 11, 1863. Only 12 Confederate soldiers were killed, as opposed to the Union's 339 losses.The 54th and Fort Wagner 54th Massachusetts Regiment charging towards Fort Wagner The Second Battle of Fort Wagner, a week later, is better known. This was the Union attack on July 18, 1863, led by the 54th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry, one of the first major American military units made up of black soldiers. Colonel Robert Gould Shaw led the 54th Massachusetts on foot while they charged, and was killed in the assault. Although a tactical defeat, the publicity of the battle of Fort Wagner led to further action for black troops in the Civil War, and it spurred additional recruitment that gave the Union Army a further numerical advantage in troops over the South. The Union besieged the fort after the unsuccessful assault. By August 25, Union entrenchments were close enough to attempt an assault on the Advanced Rifle Pits, 240 yards in front of the Battery, but this attempt was defeated. A second attempt, by the 24th Mass. Inf., on August 26 was successful. After enduring almost 60 days of heavy shelling, the Confederates abandoned it on the night of September 6‚Äì7, 1863. withdrawing all operable cannons and the garrison.Wittenburg, Eric J., The Battle of Tom's Brook North & South - The Official Magazine of the Civil War Society, Volume 10, Number 1, Page 30. =The war ends= The Confederates were at a disadvantage in men, weaponry, and supplies. Union ships sailed south and blocked off one port after another. As early as November, Union troops occupied the Sea Islands in the Beaufort area, establishing an important base for the men and ships who would obstruct the ports at Charleston and Savannah. When the plantation owners, many of which had already gone off with the Confederate army elsewhere, fled the area, the Sea Island slaves became the first \\"freedmen\\" of the war, and the Sea Islands became the laboratory for Union plans to educate the African Americans for their eventual role as full American citizens. Despite South Carolina's important role in the start of the war, and a long unsuccessful attempt to take Charleston from 1863 onward, few military engagements occurred within the state's borders until 1865, when Sherman's Army, having already completed its March to the Sea in Savannah, marched to Columbia and leveled most of the town, as well as a number of towns along the way and afterward. South Carolina lost 12,922 men to the war, 23% of its male white population of fighting age, and the highest percentage of any state in the nation. Sherman's 1865 march through the Carolinas resulted in the burning of Columbia and numerous other towns. The destruction his troops wrought upon South Carolina was even worse than in Georgia, because many of his men bore a particular grudge against the state and its citizens, whom they blamed for starting the war. One of Sherman's men declared, \\"Here is where treason began and, by God, here is where it shall end!\\"McPherson, James M. This Mighty Scourge: Perspectives on the Civil War. Oxford University Press, 2009 Poverty would mark the state for generations to come. In January 1865, the Charleston Courier newspaper condemned suggestions that the Confederacy abandon slavery were it to help in gaining independence, stating that such suggestions were \\"folly\\": On February 21, 1865, with the Confederate forces finally evacuated from Charleston, the black 54th Massachusetts Regiment marched through the city. At a ceremony at which the U.S. flag was once again raised over Fort Sumter, former fort commander Robert Anderson was joined on the platform by two men: African American Union hero Robert Smalls and the son of Denmark Vesey.

The state was fully restored to the United States on July 9, 1868. As part of the Compromise of 1877, in which Southern Democrats would acknowledge Republican Rutherford B. Hayes as president, Republicans would meet certain demands. One affecting South Carolina was the removal of all U.S. military forces from the former Confederate states. At the time, U.S. troops remained in only Louisiana, South Carolina, and Florida, but the Compromise completed their withdrawal from the region.

Located in Ma On Shan, Renaissance College serves primary and secondary students. The school was founded in 2006 to replace the Phoenix International School, another school run by ESF. Since its inception, the school has offered the IB Primary Years Programme, Middle Years Programme and Diploma Programme. Renaissance College began to offer the IB Career-Related Programme in 2014. As of September 2018, Renaissance College enrolls 2,094 students. Under the Private Independent School Scheme, at least 70% of the students of Renaissance College must be Hong Kong permanent residents when at full capacity.  History  Plans to establish Renaissance College as ESF's first private school began in 1999. Unlike other schools operated by ESF at the time, Renaissance College would not receive recurrent government subsidy. In 2001, the Education Department (now the Education Bureau) granted ESF a lot of land in Ma On Shan and in Discovery Bay to build two primary-cum-secondary schools under the Private Independent School Scheme. The Ma On Shan site would eventually become the campus of Renaissance College. On 29 October 2001, Canadian Overseas International College closed unexpectedly due to financial difficulties. According to the school's chancellor, the September 11 attacks forced the company that funded the school to file for bankruptcy. The Education Department was unaware of the financial difficulties that Canadian Overseas International College was facing, and was only informed by the school one day before its closure. The police investigated possible fraud at the school, after complaints from some parents. Jonathan Goodman, the supervisor of the Canadian school, was arrested in December 2001 for suspected theft but was not charged. The closure of the Canadian Overseas International College made 380 students unable to attend school. To resume tuition for the affected students, the Education Department established Phoenix International School (PIS) in 2001 as a temporary school operated by ESF. PIS occupied the former campus of Australian International School in Cheung Sha Wan and adopted the Ontario curriculum. The campus in Ma On Shan cost HK$297 million to build, of which HK$191.6 million was funded by the Hong Kong Government. Phoenix International School merged with Renaissance College after the latter began operating in August 2006. The first cohort of Renaissance College had 900 primary and secondary students, of which 340 were transferred from Phoenix International School. The school was granted the status of IB World School in 2007. It is known as a selective school with an acceptance rate of less than 4%. Technology The College partners with Apple Inc., spending HK$60,000 to 80,000 to provide iMacs and MacBooks, and MacBook Pros, running on Mac OS X operating system. Projectors and Apple TVs are also installed in most classrooms. Secondary students attending RCHK are required to bring charged laptops to school every day. Laptops can also be borrowed from the school ICT centre (Red Door) during the school day. There is wireless internet connection in the school, allowing students to have access to the internet within the boundaries of RCHK. Since the summer of 2011, all students from Years 6‚Äì11 are required to purchase a Mac laptop computer for their studies. Year 4 and 5 students are loaned Mac laptops which stay in school. Years 12 and 13 students were allowed to use any laptops they have on hand. Years 1‚Äì3 students are provided with iPads for their studies. ICT centre provides loaned computers only for students awaiting out of stock order or extended repair time. Students are also required to bring school issued smart cards. These cards serve as a gateway to other services the school offers. These include borrowing laptops, printing, borrowing books etc. The cards are also used to log attendance. Students are required to \\"slide into the dm's\\" of the school which is then logged onto ESF Gateway. From 1 November, E-mail notifications are sent to students to inform them of the exact time that they swiped in. This is in trial stages and will stay in effect until the end of December 2018. Primary school The primary section of RCHK, ages 4‚Äì11, follows the Primary Years Programme. It consists of 36 classes across Years 1 to 6. There are approximately 870 students and 40 teachers in the primary school. Teachers in the primary section are mostly international, local teachers mostly teaching Chinese. The Head of Primary is Jamie Schmitz. Classes run from 8:30 am to 3:00 pm, with 185 days in a school year. Lunch lasts 50 minutes (12:10 - 13:00) and recess lasts 20 minutes (9:50 - 10:10). There are 8 periods each day, each period being 40 minutes. Classrooms for primary school students are located in the school's primary school block, with Years 1 and 2 on the 1st floor, Years 3 and 4 on the 2nd floor, and Years 5 and 6 on the 3rd floor. There is a rooftop for leisure, used during lunch, recess or the occasional PE lesson, as well as a miniature field on the 3rd floor which is mostly used by primary students. Each floor consists of a hub area for each year group which is an indoor area connecting all the classrooms of one specific year level. The hubs are equipped with desktop computers, reading materials, couches, play areas and learning materials, each suited to the specific year level. Secondary school The secondary section of RCHK is attended by approximately 1,000 middle and high school students, ages 11 to 18. The middle school, Years 9 to 11, follows the Middle Years Programme, while high school students in Years 12 and 13 undergo the International Baccalaureate Diploma Programme. The secondary school runs from 8:30 am until 3:10 pm from Mondays to Thursdays, and 8:30 am until 1:00 pm on Fridays, with morning breaks from 10:40 am to 11:00 am and lunch breaks from 1:00 pm to 1:50 pm. In 2014, RCHK was authorised to offer the International Baccalaureate Career-related Programme (IBCP), the fourth IB programme.http://www.ibo.org This was a milestone, as Renaissance College became only the 8th school in the World to offer all four IB programmes and the first in East Asia to offer the IBCP. Learning at RCHK Renaissance College is an English medium international school and an accredited member of the International Baccalaureate (IB). RCHK is authorised to offer all four IB programmes: Primary Years Programme (PYP), Middle Years Programme (MYP), Diploma Programme (DP), and Career-related Programme (CP). Each IB curriculum programme promotes the education of the whole person, emphasising intellectual, emotional and social growth. This holistic approach encompasses the fields of Languages, Humanities, Sciences, Mathematics, Technology, Physical and Health Education and the Visual and Performing Arts. RCHK also offers one of the strongest Chinese language programmes in the international education system and is the only school in Hong Kong to offer the DP Theory of Knowledge (ToK) course taught in both Chinese and English. The school uniform that Years 1‚Äì11 wear have always been polo shirts, based on the colours of black, brown and khaki (unless an activity is issued on a specific day). Years 12‚Äì13 can wear casual clothing.

As with those of other states, the Declaration of Secession was not recognized by the US government at Washington, DC. Some Texan military units fought in the Civil War east of the Mississippi River, but Texas was more useful for supplying soldiers and horses for the Confederate Army. Texas's supply role lasted until mid-1863, when Union gunboats started to control the Mississippi River, which prevented large transfers of men, horses, or cattle. Some cotton was sold in Mexico, but most of the crop became useless because of the Union's naval blockade of Galveston, Houston, and other ports. Secession In the early winter of 1860, Texan counties sent delegates to a special convention to debate the merits of secession. The convention adopted an \\"Ordinance of Secession\\" by a vote of 166 to 8, which was ratified by a popular referendum on February 23. Separately from the Ordinance of Secession, which was considered a legal document, Texas also issued a declaration of causes spelling out the rationale for declaring secession. The document specifies several reasons for secession, including its solidarity with its \\"sister slave-holding States,\\" the U.S. government's inability to prevent Indian attacks, slave-stealing raids, and other border-crossing acts of banditry. It accuses northern politicians and abolitionists of committing a variety of outrages upon Texans. The bulk of the document offers justifications for slavery saying that remaining a part of the United States would jeopardize the security of the two. The declaration includes this extract praising slavery, in which the Union itself is referred to as the \\"confederacy\\": At this time, African Americans comprised around 30 percent of the state's population, and they were overwhelmingly enslaved. According to one Texan, keeping them enslaved was the primary goal of the state in joining the Confederacy: =Secession convention and the Confederacy= Following the election of Abraham Lincoln in 1860, public opinion in the cotton states of the Lower South (South Carolina through Texas) swung in favor of secession. By February 1861, the other six states of the sub-region had separately passed ordinances of secession. However, events in Texas were delayed, largely due to the resistance of Southern Unionist governor, Sam Houston. Unlike the other \\"cotton states\\"' chief executives, who took the initiative in secessionist efforts, Houston refused to call the Texas Legislature into special session to consider the question, relenting only when it became apparent citizens were prepared to act without him. In early December 1860, before South Carolina even seceded, a group of State officials published via newspaper a call for a statewide election of convention delegates on January 8, 1861. This election was highly irregular, even for the standards of the day. It often relied on voice vote at public meetings, although \\"viva voce\\" (voice) voting for popular elections had been used since at least March 1846, less than three months after statehood.An Act to direct the mode of voting in all popular elections, approved March 19, 1846. Unionists were often discouraged from attending or chose not to participate. This resulted in lopsided representation of secessionists delegates. The election call had stipulated for the delegates to assemble in convention on January 28. Houston called the Legislature into session, hoping that the elected body would declare the unauthorized convention illegal. Though he expressed reservations about the election of Abraham Lincoln, he urged the State of Texas to reject secession, citing the horrors of war and a probable defeat of the South. The convention removed Houston from the governorship, then promoted the Lieutenant Governor, Edward Clark. With gubernatorial forces routed, the Secession Convention convened on January 28 and, in the first order of business, voted to back the legislature 140‚Äì28 in that an ordinance of secession, if adopted, be submitted for statewide consideration. The following day, convention president Oran Roberts introduced a resolution suggesting Texas leave the Union. The ordinance was read on the floor the next day, citing the failures of the federal government to protect the lives and property of Texas citizens and accusing the Northern states of using the same as a weapon to \\"strike down the interests and prosperity\\" of the Southern people. After the grievances were listed, the ordinance repealed the one of July 4, 1845, in which Texas approved annexation by the United States and the Constitution of the United States, and revoked all powers of, obligations to, and allegiance to, the U.S. federal government and the U.S. Constitution. In the interests of historical significance and posterity, the ordinance was written to take effect on March 2, the date of Texas Declaration of Independence (and, coincidentally, Houston's birthday). On February 1, members of the Legislature, and a huge crowd of private citizens, packed the House galleries and balcony to watch the final vote on the question of secession. Seventy \\"yea\\" votes were recorded before there was a single \\"nay.\\" One of the negative votes is enshrined in Texas history books. James Webb Throckmorton, from Collin County in North Texas, in response to the roar of hisses and boos and catcalls which greeted his decision, retorted, \\"When the rabble hiss, well may patriots tremble.\\" Appreciating his style, the crowd afforded him a grudging round of applause (like many Texans who initially opposed secession, Throckmorton accepted the result and served his state, rising to the rank of brigadier-general in the Confederate army). The final tally for secession was 166‚Äì7. Other than in South Carolina, where the vote was unanimous, this was the highest percentage of any other state of the Lower South. On February 7, the Legislature ordered a referendum to be held on the ordinance under the direction of the convention.An Act to provide for submitting the Ordinance of Secession to a vote of the People, approved February 7, 1861. The decision was further affirmed on February 23 when a statewide referendum resulted in Texas voters approving the measure, 46,129 to 14,697. The last order of business was to appoint a delegation to represent Texas in Montgomery, Alabama, where their counterparts from the other six seceding states were meeting to form a new Confederacy. On March 4, the convention assembled again to formally declare Texas out of the Union and to approve the \\"Constitution of the Confederate States of America\\", which had been drawn up by its \\"Provisional Congress\\" (as it turned out, Texas had already been admitted into the fold on March 1). In March, George Williamson, the Louisianan state commissioner, addressed the Texan secession convention, where he called upon Texas and the slave states of the U.S. to declare secession from the Union in order to continue the institution of slavery: Governor Sam Houston accepted secession but asserted that the Convention had no power to link the state with the new Southern Confederacy. Instead, he urged that Texas revert to its former status as an independent republic and stay neutral. Houston took his seat on March 16, the date state officials were scheduled to take an oath of allegiance to the Confederacy. He remained silent as his name was called out three times and, after failing to respond, the office of governor was declared vacant and Houston was deposed from office. =Seizure of federal property and arms= After Texas passed its Ordinance of Secession, the state government appointed four men as \\"Commissioners of Public Safety\\" to negotiate with the federal government for the safe transfer of military installations and bases in Texas to the Confederates. Along with land baron Samuel A. Maverick and Thomas J. Devine, Dr. Philip N. Luckett met with U.S. Army General David E. Twiggs on February 8, 1861, to arrange the surrender of the federal property in San Antonio, including the military stores being housed in the old Alamo mission. As a result of the negotiations, Twiggs delivered his entire command and its associated Army property (10,000 rifled muskets) to the Confederacy, an act that brought cries of treason from Unionists throughout the state. Almost immediately, Twiggs was dismissed from the U.S. Army by President Buchanan for \\"treachery to the flag of his country.\\" Shortly afterwards, he accepted a commission as general in the Confederate Army but was so upset by being branded a traitor that he wrote a letter to Buchanan stating the intention to call upon him for a \\"personal interview\\" (then a common euphemism to fight a duel). Future Confederate general Robert E. Lee, then still a colonel in the U.S. Army, was in San Antonio at the time and when he heard the news of the surrender to Texas authorities, responded, \\"Has it come so soon as this?\\" Unionist sentiment and opposition to the Confederacy Despite the prevailing view of the vast majority of the state's politicians and the delegates to the Secession Convention, there were a significant number of Texans who opposed secession. The referendum on the issue indicated that some 25% of the (predominantly white) males eligible to vote favored remaining in the Union at the time the question was originally considered. The largest concentration of anti- secession sentiment was among the German Texan population in the Texas Hill Country, and in some of the counties of North Texas. In the latter region, most of the residents were originally from states of the Upper South. Some of the leaders initially opposed to secession accepted the Confederate cause once the matter was decided, some withdrew from public life, others left the state, and a few even joined the Union army. Confederate conscription laws forced most men of military age into the Confederate army, regardless of their sentiment. However, at least 2000 Texans joined the Union ranks. Many Unionists were executed. Conscription into the Confederate Army was unacceptable to many Unionists and some attempted to flee from Texas. Capt. James Duff, Confederate provost marshal for the Hill Country, executed two Unionists, prompting flight. In August 1862, Confederate soldiers under Lt. Colin D. McRae tracked down a band of German Texans headed out of state and attacked their camp in a bend of the Nueces River. After a pitched battle that resulted in the deaths of two Confederates and the wounding of McRae and eighteen of his men, the Unionists were routed. Approximately 19 Unionists were killed in the fighting. After the battle 9 to 11 of the wounded Unionists were murdered with shots to the head in what became known as the Nueces massacre. Another nine Unionists were pursued and executed in the following weeks. Future Republican congressman Edward Degener was the father of two men who were murdered in the massacre. The German population around Austin County, led by Paul Machemehl, was successful in reaching Mexico. In October 1862, approximately 150 settlers in and around Cooke County on the Red River were arrested by the 11th Texas Cavalry led by Colonel William C. Young on the orders of Colonel James Bourland, Confederate Provost Marshal for northern Texas. A court was convened in Gainesville to try them for allegedly plotting to seize the arsenals at Sherman and Gainesville and to kill their Confederate neighbors, seize their property, and to cooperate with Union army forces poised to invade northern Texas from Arkansas and/or Indian Territory. Several of the settlers were hanged in what is now downtown Gainesville during the first week of October. Nineteen additional men were found guilty and hanged before the end of the month. A total of about forty Unionists were hanged in Gainesville, two were shot while trying to escape, and two more were hanged elsewhere after being turned over to a military tribunal. Under the primitive conditions on the Texas frontier during the Civil War, evidence against the accused was questionable, and the legal proceedings were highly imperfect. A granite monument in a small park marks the spot where the hangings took place. The Confederacy's conscription act proved controversial, not only in Texas but all across the South. Despite the referendum result, some opponents argued that the war was being fought by poor people on behalf of a few wealthy slave owners. The Act exempted from the draft men who owned fifteen or more slaves.Texas in the Civil War: A Capsule History Draft resistance was widespread especially among Texans of German or Mexican descent; many of the latter went to Mexico. Potential draftees went into hiding, Confederate officials hunted them down, and many were shot or captured and forced into the army. =Sam Houston= Sam Houston was the premier Southern Unionist in Texas. While he argued for slave property rights and deplored the election of the Lincoln Administration, he considered secession unconstitutional and thought secession at that moment in time was a \\"rash action\\" that was certain to lead to a conflict favoring the industrial and populated North. He predicted: \\"Let me tell you what is coming. After the sacrifice of countless millions of treasure and hundreds of thousands of lives, you may win Southern independence if God be not against you, but I doubt it. I tell you that, while I believe with you in the doctrine of states rights, the North is determined to preserve this Union. They are not a fiery, impulsive people as you are, for they live in colder climates. But when they begin to move in a given direction, they move with the steady momentum and perseverance of a mighty avalanche; and what I fear is, they will overwhelm the South.\\" Houston rejected the actions of the Texas Secession Convention, believing it had overstepped its authority in becoming a member state of the newly formed Confederacy. He refused to take an oath of allegiance to the Confederacy and was deposed from office. In a speech he wrote, but did not deliver, he said: After his ouster from the governor's office, Houston maintained a low public profile until his death in July 1863. Before he died, Houston wrote a friend: \\"There comes a time a man's section is his country...I stand with mine. I was a conservative citizen of the United States...I am now a conservative citizen of the Southern Confederacy.\\" Military recruitment Over 70,000 Texans served in the Confederate army and Texas regiments fought in every major battle throughout the war. Some men were veterans of the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War; a few had served in the earlier Texas Revolution. The state furnished the Confederacy with 45 regiments of cavalry, 23 regiments of infantry, 12 battalions of cavalry, 4 battalions of infantry, 5 regiments of heavy artillery, and 30 batteries of light artillery. The state maintained at its own expense some additional troops that were for home defense. These included 5 regiments and 4 battalions of cavalry, and 4 regiments and one battalion of infantry. In 1862 the Confederate Congress in Richmond, Virginia, passed a conscription law that ordered all men from 18 to 45 years of age to be placed into military service except ministers, state, city, county officers, and certain slave owners; all persons holding 20 slaves or more were exempt from Confederate conscription under the \\"Twenty Negro Law\\". When the first companies of Texas soldiers reached Richmond, Virginia, Confederate President Jefferson Davis greeted them with the words: \\"Texans! The troops of other states have their reputations to gain, but the sons of the defenders of the Alamo have theirs to maintain. I am assured that you will be faithful to the trust.\\" \\"The Texas Brigade\\" (also known as \\"Hood's Brigade\\") was a unit composed of the 1st, 4th and 5th Texas infantry regiments augmented at times by the 18th Georgia Infantry and Hampton's (South Carolina) Legion until they were permanently teamed with the 3rd Arkansas Infantry. Often serving as \\"shock troops\\" of General Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia, the Texas Brigade was \\"always favorites\\" of General Lee and on more than one occasion Lee praised their fighting qualities, remarking that none had brought greater honor to their native state than \\"my Texans.\\" Hood's men suffered severe casualties in a number of fights, most notably at the Battle of Antietam, where they faced off with Wisconsin's Iron Brigade, and at Gettysburg, where they assaulted Houck's Ridge and then Little Round Top. \\"Walker's Greyhound Division\\" was a division composed of 4 brigades with Texan units; the only division in the Confederate States Army that maintained its single-state composition throughout the War. Formed in 1862 under command of Major General John George Walker it fought in the Western Theater and the Trans-Mississippi Department, and was considered an elite backbone of the army. Detached from the division in 1863, the 4th brigade fought at the Battle of Arkansas Post, where it became isolated and was forced to surrender. A new 4th brigade was added the division in 1865. Among the most famous mounted units were Terry's Texas Rangers, a militia of former rangers and frontiersmen, many of whom later became peacekeepers in the Old West; and the 33rd Texas Cavalry Regiment of Colonel Santos Benavides, which guarded the Confederate cotton trade lines from Texas into northern Mexico. Over 2,000 Texas men joined the Union Army. Notable among them was future Texas governor Edmund J. Davis who initially commanded the Union Army's 1st Texas Cavalry Regiment and rose to the rank of brigadier general. Texas's relatively large German population around Austin County led by Paul Machemehl tried to remain neutral in the War but eventually left Confederate Texas for Mexico. East Texas gave the most support to secession, and the only East Texas counties in which significant numbers of people opposed secession were Angelina County, Fannin County, and Lamar County, although these counties supplied many men to Texas regiments, including the 9th Texas Infantry Regiment; the 1st Partisan Rangers; 3rd, 4th, 9th, 27th, and 29th Texas Cavalry; and the 9th Texas Field Battery. In 1862, Abraham Lincoln named a former United States Congressman, Andrew J. Hamilton, as the Military Governor of Texas. Hamilton held the title throughout the War. During the early stages of Reconstruction Hamilton was named as the first provisional civilian governor. For a time thereafter, active-duty U.S. Army officers served as military governors of Texas. Years into the war, one Confederate soldier from Texas gave his reasons for fighting for the Confederacy, stating that \\"we are fighting for our property\\", whereas Union soldiers were fighting for the \\"flimsy and abstract idea that a negro is equal to an Anglo\\". Battles in Texas Texas did not experience many significant battles. However, the Union mounted several attempts to capture the \\"Trans- Mississippi\\" regions of Texas and Louisiana from 1862 until the war's end. With ports to the east captured or under blockade, Texas in particular became a blockade-running haven. Texas occupation Under the Anaconda Plan, the Union Navy blockaded the principal seaport, Galveston and the entire Gulf and Southern borders, for four years, and federal troops occupied the city for three months in late 1862. Confederate troops under Gen. John B. Magruder recaptured the city on January 1, 1863 and it remained in Confederate hands until the end of the war. A few days later the Confederate raider CSS Alabama attacked and sank the USS Hatteras in a naval engagement off the coast of Galveston. Anaconda Plan, Civil War Civilian Blockade Runners largely evaded the Union blockades, bandits, and Union-sympathetic Mexicans in order to smuggle cotton out of The Port of Bagdad, Mexico at a premium in exchange for goods on European and black markets, as Texas offered an unparalleled and significant opportunity to export Southern cotton out of the Confederacy. President Lincoln referred to the strategic importance of this economic movement through the Rio Grande to the Secretary of War, Edwin Stanton in 1863 stating, \\"no local object is now more desirable.\\" The Rio Grande Expedition, led by General Nathaniel P. Banks, was then sent forth to secure the ports near Brownsville and pushed 100 miles in-land, in order to impede the flow of cotton and deny freedom of movement. A few other cities also fell to Union troops at times during the war, including Port Lavaca, Indianola, and Brownsville. Federal attempts to seize control of Laredo, Corpus Christi, and Sabine Pass failed. By the end of the war no territory but Brazos Island and El Paso was in Union hands. The California Column occupied the region around El Paso from 1862 to the end of the war. The most notable military battle in Texas during the war happened on September 8, 1863. At the Second Battle of Sabine Pass, a small garrison of 46 Confederates from the mostly-Irish Davis Guards under Lt. Richard W. Dowling, 1st Texas Heavy Artillery, defeated a much larger Union force from New Orleans under Gen. William B. Franklin. Skilled gunnery by Dowling's troops disabled the lead ships in Franklin's flotilla, prompting the remainder‚Äî4,000 men on 27 ships‚Äîto retreat back to New Orleans. This victory against such overwhelming odds resulted in the Confederate Congress passing a special resolution of recognition, and the only contemporary military decoration of the South, the Davis Guards Medal. CSA President Jefferson Davis stated, \\"Sabine Pass will stand, perhaps for all time, as the greatest military victory in the history of the world.\\" In 1864, many Texas forces, including a division under Camille de Polignac, a French prince and Confederate general, moved into Northwestern Louisiana to stall Union Maj. Gen. Nathaniel Banks' Red River Campaign, which was intended to advance into Texas from its eastern border. Confederate forces halted the expedition at the Battle of Mansfield, just east of the Texas border. Union forces from Brazos Island launched the Brazos Santiago Expedition, leading to the last battle of the Civil War, the Battle of Palmito Ranch, fought in Texas on May 12, 1865, well after Robert E. Lee's surrender on April 9, 1865, at Old Appomattox Court House, Virginia. Collapse of Confederate authority in Texas In the spring of 1865, Texas contained over 60,000 soldiers of the Army of the Trans-Mississippi under General Edmund Kirby Smith. As garrison troops far removed from the main theaters of the war, morale had deteriorated to the point of frequent desertion and thievery. News of the surrender of Lee and other Confederate generals east of the Mississippi finally reached Texas around April 20. Local Confederate authorities had mixed opinions on their future course of action. Most senior military leaders vowed to press on with the war, including commanding general Kirby Smith. Many soldiers, however, greeted frequent speeches whose theme was \\"fight on, boys\\" with derision, or simply failed to attend them. The month of May brought increasing rates of desertion. News of Joseph E. Johnston's and Richard Taylor's surrenders confirmed that Texas, Louisiana, and Arkansas were now essentially alone to continue the Confederate cause. On May 14, troops in Galveston briefly mutinied, but were persuaded to remain under arms. However, morale continued to sink. Generals John B. Magruder and Kirby Smith (who had already corresponded with Union Maj. Gen. John Pope regarding surrender terms on May 9) no longer sought to rally their demoralized troops, but rather began discussing the distribution of Confederate government property. Magruder pleaded that the rapid disbanding of the army would prevent depredations by disgruntled soldiers against the civilian population. The haste to disband the army, combined with the pressing need to protect Confederate property from Union confiscation, created general mayhem. Soldiers began openly pillaging the Galveston quartermasters stores on May 21. Over the next few days, a mob demanded that a government warehouse be opened to them, and soldiers detained and plundered a train. Several hundred civilians sacked the blockade runner Lark when it docked on May 24, and troops sent to pacify the crowd soon joined in the plunder. On May 23, residents in Houston sacked the ordnance building and the clothing bureau. Riots continued in the city until May 26. Both government and private stores were raided extensively in Tyler, Marshall, Huntsville, Gonzales, Hempstead, La Grange, and Brownsville. In Navasota, a powder explosion cost eight lives and flattened twenty buildings. In Austin, the State Treasury was raided and $17,000 in gold was stolen. By May 27, half of the original Confederate forces in Texas had deserted or been disbanded, and formal order had disappeared into lawlessness in many areas of Texas. The formal remnants of Kirby Smith's army had finally disintegrated by the end of May. Upon his arrival in Houston from Shreveport, the general called a court of inquiry to investigate the \\"causes and manner of the disbandment of the troops in the District of Texas, New Mexico and Arizona.\\" The May 30 findings laid the blame primarily on the civilian population. Kirby Smith addressed his few remaining soldiers and condemned those that had fled for not struggling to the last and leaving him \\"a commander without an army‚Äì a General without troops.\\" On June 2, he formally surrendered what was left of the Army of the \\"Trans-Mississippi\\". Restoration to the Union Federal troops didn't arrive in Texas to restore order until June 19, 1865, when Union Maj. Gen. Gordon Granger and 2,000 Union soldiers arrived on Galveston Island to take possession of the state and enforce the new freedoms of former slaves. The Texas holiday Juneteenth commemorates this date. The Stars and Stripes were not raised over Austin until June 25. President Andrew Johnson appointed Union General Andrew J. Hamilton, a prominent politician before the war, as the provisional governor on June 17. He granted amnesty to ex-Confederates if they promised to support the Union in the future, appointing some to office. On March 30, 1870, the United States Congress permitted Texas' representatives to take their seat in Congress, although Texas did not meet all the formal requirements for readmission. Notable Civil War leaders from Texas A number of notable leaders were associated with Texas during the Civil War. John Bell Hood gained fame as the commander of the Texas Brigade in the Army of Northern Virginia and played a prominent role as an army commander late in the war. \\"Sul\\" Ross was a significant leader in a number of \\"Trans- Mississippi\\" Confederate armies. Felix Huston Robertson was the only native Texan Confederate general. Capt. TJ Goree was one of Lt. General James Longstreet's most trusted aides. John H. Reagan was an influential member of Jefferson Davis's cabinet. Col. Santos Benavides was a Confederate colonel during the American Civil War. Benavides was the highest-ranking Tejano soldier to serve in the Confederate military. The office of Governor of Texas was in flux throughout the war, with several men in power at various times. Sam Houston was governor when Texas seceded from the United States, but refused to declare any loyalty to the new Confederacy. He was replaced by Lieutenant Governor Edward Clark. Clark filled the rest of Houston's term in 1861, and narrowly lost re-election by just 124 votes to Francis Lubbock. During his tenure, Lubbock supported Confederate conscription, working to draft all able-bodied men, including resident aliens, into the Confederate army. When Lubbock's term ended in 1863, he joined the military. Ardent secessionist Pendleton Murrah replaced him in office. Even after Robert E. Lee surrendered in 1865, Murrah encouraged Texans to continue the revolution, and he and several supporters fled to Mexico. =Notable Civil War leaders (Confederacy) from Texas= Image:Francis lubbock.jpgGovernor Francis Lubbock Image:JohnHReagan.jpgPostmaster General John Henninger Reagan Image:ASJohnston.jpgGen.

However, Confederate Heroes Day is an official state holiday, and the month of April is recognized by the Texas Senate as Confederate History Month. Although not an official holiday, April 26 is, among Southern historical organizations within the state, often observed as \\"Confederate Memorial Day.\\" On the south lawn of the state capital in Austin is a Confederate monument, and several other memorials to individual Texas Confederate military units are nearby. In addition, most Texas county courthouse grounds feature a Confederate memorial. Texas' largest city, Houston, featured a monument to the Confederacy at its oldest city park, Sam Houston Park, titled \\"Spirit of the Confederacy.\\" It was sculpted in bronze by Louis Amateis in 1908. However, Houston mayor Sylvester Turner announced on June 11, 2020 that it will be removed. It was relocated to the Houston Museum of African American Culture on June 17, 2020.

The film was the feature film debut of the stars of The Goon Show, Spike Milligan, Harry Secombe and Peter Sellers. The film was directed by Tony Young, who later produced The Telegoons for BBC Television. Plot Secombe plays the part of Harry Flakers, a man who has a big win on the football pools. He and his friend Spike Donnelly (Milligan) decide to go to the same shabby seaside boarding house that they have always patronised for their summer holiday, but this year all the other guests (including two young women out to marry money, a dodgy investment advisor and a master forger and assistant) are intent on taking the fortune off them in one way or another. Ultimately the forgers manage to substitute fake five-pound notes for the real ones that Flakers keeps in his suitcase, but before they can abscond with the money one of the girls is given cash by Flakers to buy some cigarettes, and accused of passing false currency when the forgery is detected. A grand chase follows with half the characters pursuing the other half through a waxwork museum in which the true crooks have taken refuge. Justice is served when the chief forger boasts of his crime in front of what he thinks are two waxwork policemen, but who turn out to be real members of the force. In the final scenes Harry and Spike marry the two women. There are sequences featuring a night out at the theatre where a stage hypnotist mesmerises Flakers and the girl Christine into performing an operatic duet, he singing soprano and she baritone, and a scene in which Harry Secombe wordlessly mimes out an entire heart operation being carried out by a nervous surgeon.

Kalitta (February 18, 1962 ‚Äì June 21, 2008) was an American drag racer who competed in the Funny Car and Top Fuel classes in the National Hot Rod Association (NHRA) Full Throttle Drag Racing Series. He was killed at Old Bridge Township Raceway Park, after an accident during qualifying. He had 17 career Top Fuel wins and one career Funny Car win, and at his death he was one of 14 drivers to win in both divisions. Kalitta was son of veteran NHRA driver and crew chief Connie Kalitta, and cousin of teammate Doug Kalitta. Personal life He made his home in Snead Island, Florida, with wife, Kathy (married 11/1990) and two sons, Colin and Corey. He was a native of Ypsilanti, Michigan.NHRA's Scott Kalitta killed in crash, The Associated Press via The Houston Chronicle, June 21, 2008. Career Scott Kalitta's career began in 1982 at Old Bridge Township Raceway Park. His first career number-one qualifier happened at the Baton Rouge, Louisiana, event in 1988. He got his first win in 1989 in Funny Car at the event in Houston, Texas. He moved to Top Fuel during the 1990s. The next two years were big for Kalitta, as he won the Top Fuel championship both years. In 1994, he became the first Top Fuel driver to have four straight event wins (Columbus, Topeka, Denver, and Sonoma), and he won five events that season. He won six events and 45 rounds of competition in 1995 to win the championship. His 1996 season had him win the $100,000 Budweiser Shootout at Sonoma en route to a second-place points finish. He had the top speed at a series-best eight races that season. Kalitta won the Topeka event for a fourth straight year in 1997. He retired in October of that season. Kalitta came back in 1999, making one final round in 10 starts. Kalitta returned to Top Fuel in 2003 after a three-year layoff. He made two final rounds and set a speed record at , but did not certify the speed with a fast enough backup run to claim the national record. In 2004, he recorded one win in two final-round appearances. He was the top qualified at both Las Vegas events, and finished in the top five in season points. His 2005 season had him win two events. For 2006, Kalitta returned to Funny Car in a Chevrolet Monte Carlo, but did not have as much success as he had in Top Fuel the previous two years. In the season, Kalitta drove his Kalitta Air-sponsored Funny Car to a 13th-place points finish, well behind eventual champion John Force. Toward the end of the year, Kalitta switched from the Monte Carlo to the Toyota Solara, which he ran for the remainder of his career. Kalitta's 2007 Funny Car season was rather uneventful, as he qualified for 16 of 23 events in his DHL-sponsored Solara and missed the inaugural NHRA Countdown to the Championship. His best finish of the season was a semifinals appearance at Denver in July. In 2008, he made his 36th and last final-round appearance at Chicago, two weeks before his death. Death On June 21, 2008, Kalitta was fatally injured during the final round of qualifying for the Lucas Oil NHRA SuperNationals at Old Bridge Township Raceway Park. Kalitta's Funny Car was traveling about when the engine exploded in flames near the finish line. The parachutes were damaged and failed to slow the vehicle. According to the New Jersey State Police official news release, evidence discovered in Kalitta's lane revealed that he had applied mechanical braking and maintained steering control of the vehicle throughout the \\"shutdown\\" portion of the racetrack. Postcrash examination of the vehicle further revealed the clutch system to be locked, maintaining engine power to the rear wheels. Witnesses and audio recordings reveal the vehicle's engine was firing throughout the shutdown portion of the racetrack, which further reinforced the fact that the vehicle's engine was still providing power for some time. Kalitta's vehicle reached the end of the paved race track and went through a sand trap around . The vehicle went over the concrete retaining wall. The vehicle continued forward and impacted a piece of heavy equipment (JLG model 600S telescopic boom lift vehicle), which was positioned outside the \\"run-off\\" area by the ESPN television crew. This impact caused catastrophic damage to the vehicle and additional separation of chassis components and the vehicle's engine. The largest portion of the race vehicle came to rest in a grassy area south of the shutdown area. Kalitta was contained in this portion of the race vehicle and had sustained fatal blunt-force injuries. A review of information provided by Delphi, which was recorded by accelerometers mounted to the Kalitta vehicle, revealed multiple impacts producing over 100 g, with some approaching or exceeding 200 g. He was transported to the Old Bridge Division of Raritan Bay Medical Center and was pronounced dead on arrival. Post mortem toxicological analysis of blood obtained from Scott Kalitta during his autopsy revealed the presence of ethanol at a level of 23 mg/dl. This converts to a .02% blood alcohol content ) percentage. This level, 25% of the legal limit for intoxication in the State of New Jersey, remains in violation of NHRA rules (Section 1.7, I., B.1.), as well as N.J.S.A. Title 13 Chapter 62 New Jersey State Motor Vehicle Racetrack Regulations.https://www.njsp.org/news/pr091708.html The NHRA said on Kalitta's death that \\"Scott shared the same passion for drag racing as his legendary father, Connie. He also shared the same desire to win, becoming a two-time series world champion. He left the sport for a very long period of time, to devote more time to his family, only to be driven to return to the drag strip to regain his championship form.\\" At the time of his accident, Kalitta was not qualified for the following day's national event in the Funny Car class. The run qualified him 13th. The next day, in what would have been his opening elimination round event, the entire Kalitta team stood on the starting line on his designated side of the dragstrip as Robert Hight, who would have been his opponent, idled his car down the quarter-mile track as a sign of respect.2008 Lucas Oil NHRA SuperNationals: Event home page Legacy On July 2, 2008, the NHRA shortened Top Fuel and Funny Car races to in response to the ongoing investigation, and extra safety measures were placed at all tracks, including padded retaining walls at the end of sand traps, replacing the polymer nets held up by concrete posts. Although unpopular with the fans, the 1,000-foot distance is still in use for the Top Fuel and Funny Car categories. The FIA shortened the Mantorp Park, Alastaro Circuit, and Tierp Arena rounds of the European Drag Racing Championship because of track concerns, but drag races at Hockenheimring and Santa Pod remained at the distance because of its length until the end of the 2011 season. The 2012 FIA drag racing championships for Top Fuel will only be held at the 1,000-foot distance (although the Hockenheimring dragster round was cancelled following track treatment controversy as a result of Formula One officials scraping the entire drag strip in an effort to prevent drivers from using the drag strip launch pad for additional grip in the S√ºdkurve during the 2012 German Grand Prix two weeks before the Hockenheimring drag racing round); Adelaide International Raceway became Australia's first 1,000-foot drag strip. In 2017, the International Hot Rod Association changed to 1,000-foot racing for its Top Fuel cars starting with the 2017-18 ACDelco Thunder Nationals (first IHRA Top Fuel race of the 2017‚Äì18 IHRA 400 Thunder season). As a direct result of Kalitta's death, a solution was sought to eliminate engine backfire, the cause of the spectacular engine fires often associated with nitro burners. A solution was developed by Dave Lahey of Electromotion in Columbus, Ohio, with the help of 15-time Funny Car champion John Force, former Funny Car and Top Fuel champion Kenny Bernstein, and seven-time Top Fuel champion Tony Schumacher; they developed a sensor that in the event of an engine backfire will automatically shut down the fuel pump and deploy the parachutes. Although several NHRA drivers have expressed their displeasure at the introduction of the new sensor, they admit that it should reduce, if not eliminate, the circumstances that led to Kalitta's death. The device was made a mandatory safety requirement in 2009.

The state had formally rejected slavery by popular vote and vowed to fight on the side of the Union, though ideological divisions with neighboring Missouri, a slave state, had led to violent conflict in previous years and persisted for the duration of the war. While Kansas was a rural frontier state distant from the major theaters of war and its Unionist government was never seriously threatened by Confederate military forces, several engagements did occur within its borders, as well as countless raids and skirmishes between local irregulars, including the Lawrence Massacre by pro-Confederate guerrillas under William Quantrill in August 1863. Later the state witnessed the defeat of Confederate General Sterling Price by Union General Alfred Pleasonton at the Battle of Mine Creek, the second-largest cavalry action of the war. The decision of how Kansas would enter the Union was a pivotal one which forced the entire country to confront the political and social turmoil generated by the question of abolition and contributed to the strong division in sentiment that eventually erupted into war. The early violence there presaged the coming national conflict, and throughout the war Kansas remained a staunchly loyal Union stronghold at the western edge of a border region otherwise populated by uneven governments and mixed sympathies. Background After the Territory of Kansas approved the anti-slavery Wyandotte Constitution, it was admitted to the Union on January 29, 1861, in the midst of the national secession crisis: six states had already seceded, and five more would follow in the coming months. The Kansas‚ÄìNebraska Act of 1854 had rescinded the former Missouri Compromise and permitted the territories of Kansas and Nebraska to determine whether they would enter the Union as slave or free states by popular sovereignty. Violence between pro-slavery and anti-slavery groups began almost immediately. The conflict was especially bloody along the Kansas‚ÄìMissouri border, where Missouri Border Ruffians and Kansas Free-Staters formed bands of partisan rangers to raid and pillage opposition strongholds, earning it the name \\"Bleeding Kansas\\". Kansas' popular vote eventually chose against slavery, so Kansas would fight with the North. As the local military organizations had fallen into disuse, the state's government had no well-organized militia, no arms, accoutrements or supplies, nothing with which to meet Union Army demands except the united will of officials and citizens. Military units The first Kansas regiment was called on June 3, 1861, and the seventeenth, the last raised during the Civil War, on July 28, 1864. The entire quota assigned to Kansas was 16,654, and the number raised was 20,097, leaving a surplus of 3,443 to the credit of Kansas. About 1,000 Kansans joined Confederate forces, since a number of people from the nation's south had settled in Kansas. There are no statistics on those serving the Confederacy, since some joined guerrilla units. Statistics indicate that losses of Kansas regiments killed in battle and from disease are greater per thousand than those of any other State. This led to a 19th-century nickname for Kansas: the \\"Spartan State\\". Lawrence Massacre Quantrill's Raid into Lawrence, Kansas destroyed much of the city The first action in Kansas was not between the rival Union and Confederate armies; it was an 1863 guerrilla raid by pro-slavery \\"bushwhackers\\", led by William C. Quantrill, who descended on Lawrence, a center of anti-slavery Unionist sentiment, and proceeded to sack the town, burning numerous buildings and executing about 180 men and boys. As the raiders could be heard shouting \\"Remember Osceola!\\", the attack was taken to be a reprisal for an earlier raid by anti-slavery \\"Jayhawkers\\" on Osceola, Missouri. Some believed that it was also a response to the recent deaths of some of the raiders' imprisoned womenfolk, when their jailhouse collapsed, perhaps by design, though recent research shows that the collapse was almost certainly accidental.Harris, Charles F. \\"Catalyst for Terror: The Collapse of the Women's Prison In Kansas City\\", Missouri Historical Review, April 1995, pp. 302, 303 The massacre outraged the Confederate government, which had granted recognition to Quantrill under the Partisan Ranger Act, but now withdrew support from irregular forces. Later engagements The Battle of Baxter Springs, sometimes called the Baxter Springs Massacre, was a minor battle fought on October 6, 1863, near where the city of Baxter Springs now sits. On October 25, 1864, a series of three battles occurred, the first two in Linn County, Kansas, with the final in Vernon County, Missouri. The first was the Battle of Marais des Cygnes (also called the \\"Battle of Trading Post\\"), the second, a cavalry battle, was the Battle of Mine Creek, a significant battle between mounted cavalry for Confederate forces and several brigades of Union cavalry that were pursuing General Price. They were between Major General Sterling Price, leading the Missouri expedition, against Union forces under Major General Alfred Pleasonton. Price, after going south from Kansas City, was initially met by Pleasonton at Marais des Cygnes. At the end of the day, the Confederate army as an effective fighting force was decimated and forced to withdraw into Arkansas.

The state governor, Democrat Joseph E. Brown, wanted locally raised troops to be used only for the defence of Georgia, in defiance of Confederate president Jefferson Davis, who wanted to deploy them on other battlefronts. When the Union blockade prevented Georgia from exporting its plentiful cotton in exchange for key imports, Brown ordered farmers to grow food instead, but the breakdown of transport systems led to desperate shortages. There was not much fighting in Georgia until September 1863, when Confederates under Braxton Bragg defeated William S. Rosecrans at Chickamauga Creek. In May 1864, William T. Sherman started pursuing the Confederates towards Atlanta, which he captured in September, in advance of his March to the Sea. This six-week campaign destroyed much of the civilian infrastructure of Georgia, decisively shortening the war. When news of the march reached Robert E. Lee's army in Virginia, whole Georgian regiments deserted, feeling they were needed at home. The Battle of Columbus, fought on the Georgia-Alabama border on April 16, 1865, is reckoned by some criteria to have been the last battle of the war. Secession In December 1860, Georgia governor Joseph E. Brown, a passionate believer in slavery and southern states' rights, opined that the election of Abraham Lincoln, an anti-slavery Republican, to the U.S. presidency would result in the ending of slavery in the United States. Thus, Brown called upon Georgians to resist anti-slavery interventions, declaring that failure to do so would result in the emancipation of their slaves: The following month, in January 1861, the Georgia Secession Convention issued an Ordinance of Secession, in which it outlined the causes that motivated the state to declare its secession from the Union. The ordinance cited the views of U.S. president- elect Abraham Lincoln and that of the Republican Party against \\"the subject of African slavery\\", anti-slavery sentiment in northern free states, and perceived support among northerners for equality for African Americans as reasons for Georgia's declaring of secession: In a February 1861 speech to the Virginia secession convention, Georgian Henry Lewis Benning stated that the main reason as to why Georgia declared secession from the Union was due to \\"a deep conviction on the part of Georgia, that a separation from the North-was the only thing that could prevent the abolition of her slavery.\\" William L. Harris, one Mississippian secession commissioner, told a meeting of the Georgian general assembly that the Republicans wanted to implement \\"equality between the white and negro races\\" and thus secession was necessary for the slave states to resist their efforts. Contemporary Georgian religious leaders also supported slavery. One Georgian preacher condemned Republicans and abolitionists, stating that their anti-slavery views ran contrary to the teachings of the Christian religion, saying that such groups' views were \\"diametrically opposed to the letter and spirit of the Bible, and as subversive of all sound morality, as the worst ravings of infidelity.\\" Home front Governor Joseph E. Brown was a leading secessionist and led efforts to remove the state from the Union and into the Confederacy. A firm believer in state's rights, he defied the Confederate government's wartime policies. He resisted the Confederate military draft and tried to keep as many soldiers at home as possible to fight invading forces. Brown challenged Confederate impressment of animals, goods, and slaves. Several other governors followed his lead. During the war, Georgia sent nearly 100,000 men to battle for the Confederacy, mostly to the Virginian armies. Despite secession, many southerners in North Georgia remained loyal to the Union. =Unionism= Approximately 5,000 Georgians served in the U.S. Army in units such as the 1st Georgia Infantry Battalion, the 1st Alabama Cavalry Regiment, and a number of East Tennessean regiments. Georgia's Rabun County in particular, which did not declare secession from the Union,Rabun County Comprehensive Plan - Chapter 7 - Historical Cultural was highly Unionist, described by some as being \\"almost a unit against secession.\\" One of the county's residents recalled in 1865 that \\"You cannot find a people who were more averse to secession than were the people of our county\\", stating that \\"I canvassed the county in 1860‚Äì61 myself and I know that there were not exceeding twenty men in this county who were in favor of secession.\\" The dividing lines were often not as clear as they are sometimes viewed in Rabun county during this period. In A Separate Civil War: Communities in Conflict in the Mountain South, Jonathan Dean Sarris examines the wartime experiences of Fannin and Lumpkin counties. Within these two counties, Unionist and Confederate leaning factions fought brutally directly within the home front between 1861 and 1865. Sarris argues that there is a \\"complex web of local, regional, and national loyalties that connected pre- industrial mountain societies\\" and that these loyalties are among the major factors that determine the leanings of these mountain towns. The Madden Branch Massacre in Fannin county was one of several atrocities that occurred as the mountain counties divided into pro and anti-Confederate factions. On November 29, 1864, six Georgians trying to enlist in the U.S. Army - Thomas Bell, Harvey Brewster, James T. Hughes, James B. Nelson, Elijah Robinson, Peter Parris, and Wyatt J. Parton - were executed by the notorious Confederate guerilla John P. Gatewood, \\"the long-haired, red-bearded beast from Georgia.\\" While concentrated in the mountains and large cities, Unionism in Georgia was not confined to those areas and could be found in areas across the state. =Food shortages= By summer 1861, the Union naval blockade virtually shut down the export of cotton and the import of manufactured items. Food that normally came by rail from the Northern states were halted. The governor and legislature pleaded with planters to grow less cotton and more food. The planters refused because at first, they thought the Union would not or could not fight. The planters then saw cotton prices in Europe soared and they expected Europe to soon intervene and break the blockade. The legislature imposed cotton quotas and made it a crime to grow an excess, but the food shortages continued to worsen, especially in the towns. In more than a dozen instances across the state, poor white women raided stores and captured supply wagons to get such necessities as bacon, corn, flour, and cotton yarn. In some cases, Confederate armies forcibly seized food from Georgians and South Carolinians. The Georgian governor lamented that such seizures of food \\"have been ruinous to the people of the northeastern part of the State.\\" As conditions at home worsened late in the war more and more soldiers deserted the army to attend to their suffering farms and families. =Deserter and layout gangs= During the course of the war, some Georgians banded together to resist Confederate authorities. Some were Unionists in their beliefs, but others were anti-Confederate due to Confederate government's policy of impressment and conscription. Deserter gangs were made up of those who had deserted from Confederate forces. Layout gangs consisted of those who had avoided conscription by hiding out. Pro-Confederate Georgians often derided these groups as Tories. Some groups consisted of both deserters and draft evaders. The mountains of north Georgia were one location where many such groups operated. Others operated in the swamps of the Alapaha River in Berrien, Coffee, Echols County, Georgia, and Irwin counties. The Okefenokee Swamp was another location that several anti-Confederate forces occupied during the course of the war. Black Jack Island and Soldiers Camp Island are two locations within the swamp where over 1,000 deserters were reported to have hidden. By 1864, the Wiregrass Region of Georgia was no longer fully controlled by the Confederate government due to layout and deserter gangs. During the same time, the backcountry of Pulaski, Montgomery, and Telfair counties in the area of Gum Swamp Creek in modern-day Dodge County had become home to similar groups. =Debate over the use of slaves as soldiers= Late in the war, when it was suggested that the Confederacy use its slaves as soldiers, many Confederate newspapers, such as the Atlanta Southern Confederacy in Macon, vehemently objected to the idea of armed black men in the Confederate army, saying that it was incongruous with the Confederacy's goals and views regarding African Americans and slavery. The newspaper said that using black men as soldiers would be an embarrassment to Confederates and their children, saying that although African Americans should be used for slave labor, they should not be used as armed soldiers, opining that: Georgian Confederates such as Democrat Howell Cobb supported the Macon newspaper's view, saying that the Confederates using black soldiers was \\"suicidal\\" and would run contrary to the Confederacy's ideology. Opposing such a move, Cobb stated that African Americans were untrustworthy and innately lacked the qualities to make good soldiers, and that using them would cause many Confederates to quit the army: Despite these protests, a law to raise troops from the slave population was passed by the Confederate Congress on March 13, 1865. By mid-April, a few recruiting stations had been established in Macon, Georgia, but the results of these efforts are unknown.Clarence L. Mohr, On The Threshold of Freedom: Masters and Slaves in Civil War Georgia (LSU Press edition, 2001), pp. 283-284. Battles in Georgia Georgia was relatively free from warfare until late 1863. A total of nearly 550 battles and skirmishes occurred within the state, with the majority occurring in the last two years of the conflict. The first major battle in Georgia was a Confederate victory at the Battle of Chickamauga in 1863, which was the last major Confederate victory in the west. In 1864 Union general William T. Sherman's armies invaded Georgia as part of the Atlanta Campaign. Confederate general Joseph E. Johnston fought a series of battles, the largest being the Battle of Kennesaw Mountain, trying to delay Union armies for as long as possible as he retreated toward Atlanta. Johnston's replacement, Gen. John Bell Hood, attempted several unsuccessful counterattacks at the Battle of Peachtree Creek and the Battle of Atlanta, but Sherman captured Atlanta on September 2, 1864. =List of battles fought in Georgia= * Battle of Adairsville * Battle of Allatoona * Battle of Atlanta * Battle of Brown's Mill * Battle of Buck Head Creek * Battle of Chickamauga * Battle of Columbus * Battle of Dallas * Battle of Dalton I * Battle of Dalton II * Battle of Davis' Cross Roads * Battle of Ezra Church * Battle of Fort McAllister (1863) * Battle of Fort McAllister (1864) * Battle of Fort Pulaski * Battle of Griswoldville * Battle of Jonesborough * Battle of Kennesaw Mountain * Battle of Kolb's Farm * Battle of Lovejoy's Station * Battle of Marietta * Battle of New Hope Church * Battle of Peachtree Creek * Battle of Pickett's Mill * Battle of Resaca * Battle of Ringgold Gap * Battle of Rocky Face Ridge * Battle of Utoy Creek * Battle of Waynesboro The Atlanta Campaign Union Maj. Gen. William T. Sherman invaded Georgia from the vicinity of Chattanooga, Tennessee, beginning in May 1864, opposed by the Confederate general Joseph E. Johnston. Johnston's Army of Tennessee withdrew toward Atlanta in the face of successive flanking maneuvers by Sherman's group of armies. In July, Confederate president Jefferson Davis replaced Johnston with the more aggressive John Bell Hood, who began challenging the Union Army in a series of damaging frontal assaults. Hood's army was eventually besieged in Atlanta and the city fell on September 2, setting the stage for Sherman's March to the Sea and hastening the end of the war. Sherman's March to the Sea A map showing Sherman's March to the Sea from November to December 1864. In November 1864, Sherman stripped his army of non-essentials, burned the city of Atlanta, and left it to the Confederates. He began his famous Sherman's March to the Sea, living off the land then burning plantations, wrecking railroads, killing livestock, and freeing slaves. Thousands of escaped slaves followed him as he entered Savannah on December 22. After the loss of Atlanta, the governor withdrew the state's militia from the Confederate forces to harvest crops for the state and the army. The militia did not try to stop Sherman. Sherman's March was devastating to both Georgia and the Confederacy in terms of economics and psychology. Sherman himself estimated that the campaign had inflicted $100 million (about $1.4 billion in 2012 dollars) in damages, about one fifth of which \\"inured to our advantage\\" while the \\"remainder is simple waste and destruction.\\" His army wrecked of railroad and numerous bridges and miles of telegraph lines. It seized 5,000 horses, 4,000 mules, and 13,000 head of cattle. It confiscated 9.5 million pounds of corn and 10.5 million pounds of fodder, and destroyed uncounted cotton gins and mills. Sherman's campaign of total war extended to Georgian civilians. In July 1864, during the Atlanta campaign, Sherman ordered approximately 400 Roswell mill workers, mostly women, arrested as traitors and shipped as prisoners to the North with their children. There is little evidence that more than a few of the women ever returned home. The memory of Sherman's March became iconic and central to the \\"Myth of the Lost Cause\\" and neo-Confederates. The crisis was the setting for Margaret Mitchell's 1936 novel Gone with the Wind and the subsequent 1939 film. Most important were many \\"salvation stories\\" that tell not what Sherman's army destroyed, but what was saved by the quick thinking and crafty women on the home front, or by a Union soldier's appreciation of the beauty of homes and the charm of Southern women. County courthouses destroyed During the war, twelve county courthouses were destroyed by the U.S. Army. * The courthouse of McIntosh County at Darien was destroyed in June 1863 when the U.S. Army burned most of the town. * The Dade County courthouse was destroyed in 1863 during the Chattanooga Campaign. * The courthouses of Cherokee County, Clayton County, Cobb County, Polk County, and Whitfield County were destroyed in 1864 during the Atlanta Campaign. * The courthouses of Bulloch County, Butts County, Screven County, Washington County, and Wilkinson County were destroyed during Sherman's March to the Sea in 1864. The courthouse in Catoosa County at Ringgold was spared by U.S. General William T. Sherman when he learned it was also a Masonic lodge. Last battles In December 1864, Sherman captured Savannah before leaving Georgia in January 1865 to begin his Carolinas Campaign. However, there were still several small fights in Georgia after his departure. On April 16, 1865, the Battle of Columbus, was fought on the Georgia-Alabama border. In 1935, the state legislature officially declared this engagement as the \\"last battle of the War Between the States.\\" Re- entry to the Union The war left most of Georgia devastated, with many dead and wounded, and the state's economy in shambles. The slaves were emancipated in 1865, and Reconstruction started immediately after the hostilities ceased. Georgia did not re-enter the Union until July 15, 1870, as the last of the former Confederate states to be re-admitted. The state remained poor well into the twentieth century. Civil War sites in Georgia Trails sign Many of Georgia's Civil War battlefields, particularly those around Atlanta, have been lost to modern urban development. However, a number of sites have been well preserved, including Chickamauga and Chattanooga National Military Park and Kennesaw Mountain National Battlefield Park. Other sites related to the Civil War include Stone Mountain, Fort Pulaski, and the Atlanta Cyclorama. A number of antebellum mansions and plantations in Georgia are preserved and open to the public, particularly around Atlanta and Savannah. Portions of the Civil War-era Western & Atlantic Railroad have historical markers commemorating events during the war, including several sites associated with the Andrews Raid. The Civil War Heartland Leaders Trail includes 46 sites from Gainesville to Millegeville. Another area near Atlanta with Civil War history is in the Sweetwater Creek State Park in Douglas County, Georgia. At this location is one of the last standing buildings burned by General Sherman's army, New Manchester Mill.

They recorded singles beginning in 1965 in the transitional Beat to psychedelic music genre, later known as freakbeat. The band had varied line-ups; only drummer Keith Guster was a member throughout their history. They finally disbanded in 1969. Keyboardist Pete Sears went on to play with Sam Gopal Dream, and recorded on four early Rod Stewart albums including \\"Every Picture Tells a Story\\", and was a founding member of Jefferson Starship, going on to play with Hot Tuna for ten years, and working with artists like John Lee Hooker, Dr. John, and Harvey Mandel. Bassist Gordon Haskell would eventually replace Greg Lake in King Crimson before going on a successful solo career. Guitarist Bryn Haworth would move to the States and record an unreleased album under the name Wolfgang with a band including acclaimed bassist Leland Sklar. He would record solo albums in the 1970s for Island Records and A&M; Records, before continuing his solo career on Contemporary Christian Music labels. Fleur de Lys were managed by Atlantic Records' Frank Fenter, who had also discovered Sharon Tandy, the first white artist to record for Stax Records. Sweet Feeling's manager Howard Conder recruited the band to record the song \\"Reflections of Charles Brown\\", under the name 'Rupert's People'. This single, heavily reminiscent of Procol Harum's \\"A Whiter Shade of Pale\\", failed to chart (except in Australia where it reached No. 13 in August 1967) despite receiving airplay but became a collectable item according to Record Collector Magazine (Issue c. 1992).

It is named after the French town of Pithiviers, where the dish is commonly assumed to originate. The filling is always placed as a lump in the middle of the bottom dough layer, rather than spread on it, to prevent it liquefying and leaking during baking. The pie is traditionally finished with a distinct shine to the top of the crust, by egg-washing beforehand, or by caramelising a dusting of confectioner's sugar at the end of baking, or both. Made for Epiphany, it's similar to the galette des rois.

JNES is devoted to the study of the civilizations of the Near East from prehistory to the end of the Ottoman period in 1922. JNES embraces a uniquely broad scope of time, place, and topic, including contributions from scholars of international reputation on topics in Assyriology, Egyptology, Hittitology, Hebrew Bible, and allied ancient studies, as well as a second area of emphasis in early, medieval, and early-modern Islamic studies. The disciplinary range of the journal runs from history and language to religion and literature to archaeology and art history. The Journal of Near Eastern Studies was founded in 1884, with an original emphasis on Old Testament studies. The journal was renamed twice over the course of the following century, with each name change reflecting the growth and expansion of the fields covered by the publication. Originally titled Hebraica, the journal in 1895 became the American Journal of Semitic Languages and Literatures; the present title came about in 1942. JNES is published twice yearly by the University of Chicago Press. The journal evaluates manuscripts through a double-blind peer review process. Every issue includes new scholarly work as well as a book review section, which provides a critical overview of new publications by emerging and established scholars.

It is a Nationally Registered Historic Place because it influenced the territorial government's choice of the capital city's location. It also contains Florida's Prime meridian marker monument which is the foundation point for most land mapping throughout Florida. The park as conceived in 1971 had a stream and shallow waterfalls but it closed because of soil contamination and toxic waste left buried by the gasification plant that once occupied the site. It was cleaned up with Department of Environmental Protection funding in 2006 and construction on the new park was initiated in 2010 using money from the penny sales tax. The newly designed Cascades Park opened in 2014. Features of the new park include the Capital City Amphitheater, a fountain with light, music, splash pads, and ponds, and boulder climbing, beachscape and outdoor classroom area known as Discovery at Cascade Park that was privately funded. History A drawing by Comte Francis de Castelnau depicting the waterfall (1839) In 1821, Spain ceded Florida to the United States. A territorial government was established, but the two largest cities, Pensacola and St. Augustine, were too far west and east, respectively, for either to make a good permanent capital. Territorial governor William Pope Duval appointed two commissioners, one from Pensacola and one from St. Augustine, to choose a location roughly halfway between them to build the new capital. When they saw a beautiful waterfall in what is now Cascades Park, they chose a nearby hill as the location for the future city of Tallahassee. John Lee Williams, the commissioner from Pensacola, wrote of the waterfall: The Florida State Capitol stands approximately a quarter mile northwest of where the waterfall and sinkhole were located. The area was used as a meeting place in the earlier portion of the 19th century for hunters and travelers. During the early 20th century, it was home to Centennial Field, formerly used to play minor league baseball and football, as well as a Korean War memorial. In 1971, Governor Reubin Askew and the Florida Cabinet recognized the park's significance in a resolution. Contamination The city operated a manufactured gas plant in the southwest of the park from 1895 to the late 1950s, when they switched to natural gas and propane. As part of its normal operation, the MGP produced coal tar which was not valuable enough to be sold or reused, so it was simply discarded. Potentially harmful components of this coal tar, in particular polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and BTEX (benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylenes), have been detected in the soil and groundwater. A downward hydraulic gradient prevented the contaminants from spreading, but at the site itself, there was \\"a current or potential threat to public health and the environment\\". In addition, a landfill on the southern edge of the park was used to dispose of municipal solid waste. The landfill was originally intended for biodegradable lawn waste such as tree limbs, but later it was reportedly used for other trash including construction and automobile waste and ash from the city incinerator on the east side of the park. Remediation project In September 2005, the city made an agreement with WRS Infrastructure & Environment to clean up the site for $7.8 million. The plan was to excavate over 70,000 tons of contaminated soil and transport it to an EPA-approved landfill in Valdosta, Georgia, to remove three inches (76 mm) of sediment from of the stream and install a protective liner, and to place a clay cap over 5,750 square yards of the landfill. The project was completed in 2014. The park now includes an outdoor amphitheater, biking and walking trails, and historical monuments. A privately funded children's play area contains an outdoor classroom. Other features of the park are an interactive fountain, a waterfall, and several ponds, masking the park's other function, to serve as drainage for storm water, intended to reduce local flooding.

Events  After the battle of Klyastitsy and several minor losses, Oudinot's Corps retreated to Polotsk. In the early morning of 17 August, the 1st Infantry Corps led by Wittgenstein attacked the French positions near the village of Spas, forcing the French to retreat. Oudinot transported additional units to the sector of the attack and also counterattacked in the centre. By the night both the French and the Russians managed to keep their positions. Oudinot was wounded and had to hand over the command to Gouvion Saint-Cyr. The next morning Gouvion Saint-Cyr undertook a major offensive. He managed to mislead Wittgenstein about the area of the offensive, regroup his troops and suddenly attack the left flank and centre of the Russian positions. In the beginning the offensive was a major success, the French troops crushed the Russians and captured seven cannons. When defeat seemed imminent, Wittgenstein organized a cavalry counterattack. It caused a scare among the French, who ceased the offensive and retreated. Wittgenstein retreated to the Drissa. For the next two months both the French and the Russians did not attempt to upset the balance of powers. Wittgenstein managed with his much smaller force effectively halted two french corps trying to advance to Saint Petersburg, which deed later gave him russian general-in-chief post.

Other journalists to serve as editor were Jay Harris, Burle Pettit, Randy Sanders, Terry Greenberg and James Bennett. The Amarillo Globe-News Publishing Company, headed by Eugene A. Howe and Wilbur C. Hawk, would later own the majority of The Avalanche-Journal. In 1951, the Whittenburg family in Amarillo acquired the Avalanche-Journal, after their Panhandle Publishing Company was merged with Globe-News company. In 1972, both The Avalanche-Journal and The Amarillo Globe-News were acquired by Morris Communications of Augusta, Georgia. On Tuesday, May 12, 1970, the day after a massive F5 tornado had devastated much of downtown Lubbock ‚Äî including the Avalanche-Journal building at 8th Street and Avenue J ‚Äî the newspaper managed to publish an eight-page edition by dictating reports to its sister paper, the Globe-News, in Amarillo, Texas. That morning a print run of 60,000 copies bearing the page-one headline \\"Twister Smashes Lubbock, 20 Dead, Hundreds Injured,\\" the first printed news of the storm, went out from Amarillo, 100 miles north of Lubbock. The May 13 edition, listing names of the known dead, was published in the same manner, and by May 14 The Avalanche-Journal was again printed locally.Jeff Tinnell, \\"A-J's May 12 edition took the long way home\\", Lubbock Avalanche-Journal, 6 May 1990. During strikes over crop support prices in 1977, an editorial published in the Lubbock Avalanche-Journal infuriated farmers, who blockaded the newspaper's delivery docks with their tractors. The unsigned editorial accused farmers of using the \\"anti-social tactics of union goons.\\" Farmers demanded an apology and formed a tractor blockade, preventing trucks from delivering newspapers. Editor Jay Harris spoke with the farmers and indicated the editorial was not intended to imply that the farmers were goons.Farmers block newspaper. Ellensburg Daily Record. 21 December 1977. In 1997, The Avalanche-Journal went digital with its content at LubbockOnline.com. In 2008, The Avalanche-Journal led an investigation into the 1985 rape conviction of Tim Cole, a Texas Tech University student who had died in prison in 1999 at the age of thirty-nine. The A-J‚Äôs three-part series on Cole‚Äôs exoneration in light of DNA evidence, ‚ÄúHope Deferred,‚Äù helped prompt a legislative ruling in Texas permitting posthumous pardons, and on March 1, 2010, Governor Rick Perry granted the state's first posthumous pardon to Cole.Elliott Blackburn, \\"Governor makes Cole pardon official\\", The Lubbock Avalanche-Journal, 2 March 2010. The Avalanche-Journal launched a full-color lifestyle publication, Lubbock Magazine, in April 2008. The magazine is published eight times a year. In February 2011, The Avalanche-Journal became the first media company on the South Plains to launch an application for the iPad.Terry Greenberg, \\"A-J's iPad app ready to come out of shadows\\", The Lubbock Avalanche-Journal, 6 February 2011.

Early life George Barney was born in Wolverhampton, Staffordshire, England, the son of Joseph Barney, drawing master at the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, England, and Jane, n√©e Chandler (or Chambers). He entered the army at 16 as second lieutenant in the Royal Engineers. He served in the Peninsular War and for many years in the West Indies. He had several years experience of civil engineering in Jamaica. He was promoted to captain in 1825. Career in Australia In July 1834, New South Wales Governor Richard Bourke asked that a civil engineer should be sent to Sydney to take charge of the construction of a large circular quay at Sydney Cove and other public works. Captain Barney was selected, and came to Sydney on the British Sovereign with his wife and three children in December 1835. He also brought a detachment of Royal Engineers, with instructions that he was also to take charge of and superintend the buildings belonging to the military, and convict departments. Bourke stated in February 1836 that Barney was engaged in removing obstructions to the navigation of the Parramatta River, and asked that leave might be granted him to undertake the duty of colonial engineer at a salary of ¬£500 a year plus travelling charges. This was granted in September 1837, and in 1838 Barney brought forward a scheme for the sale of the barracks in Sydney, as the land was now valuable; the proceeds to be used for new buildings at Sydney and Newcastle, New South Wales. In 1839 he prepared a report on the defence of the harbours in the colony and made various recommendations. The English authorities, however, declined to consider the question until they had received plans and estimates of the proposed work. Governor George Gipps supported Barney and with the aid of convict labour the preparing of the ground for the guns was begun in 1840. In January 1843 Gipps spoke very highly of Barney, but stated he had so many other duties it was scarcely possible for him to give the required attention to his colonial appointment. Barney was appointed a member of the New South Wales Legislative Council from 17 July 1843, but resigned in August 1843. Barney returned to England in May 1844 and served at Woolwich. In May 1846, now a lieutenant- colonel, was appointed Lieutenant-Governor of North Australia. In 1822 John Bigge had recommended the establishment of a convict settlement at Port Curtis on the east coast of Queensland. The project had been revived several times, and as some difficulty was being experienced in finding work for time-expired convicts in Tasmania, it was now decided to try the experiment of sending them to a new area and giving them land and a certain amount of government help. Edward Smith-Stanley, 14th Earl of Derby and William Ewart Gladstone, successive secretaries of state for the colonies, had fathered the project, and Gladstone had selected Barney as a man used to authority and with previous experience in Australia. Barney arrived again in Sydney on 15 September 1846 in the William Hyde, and quickly surveyed the coast in a small steamer, and decided that Port Curtis was the most suitable place for a settlement. Returning to Sydney a barque, the Lord Auckland, was chartered, and on 8 January 1847 sailed with Barney and his family, various officials, and a small military force. The party arrived at an unfavourable period and there was much discomfort from the extreme heat. In the meantime there had been a change of ministries in England, Henry Grey, 3rd Earl Grey had succeeded Gladstone, and had promptly vetoed the whole project. News of this reached Barney on 15 April 1847 and the party returned to Sydney. Barney was criticised in some quarters, but the colony was never given a chance to succeed. In later years the thriving town of Gladstone, Queensland was established on the site, and the harbour is one of the finest in Australia. Late life Barney was appointed successively chief commissioner of crown lands on 1 January 1849, and Surveyor General of New South Wales on 11 October 1855. He was again appointed a member of the Legislative Council from 13 October 1851 to 29 February 1856. He died at Sydney on 16 April 1862 and was buried in St Thomas's cemetery (now St Thomas Rest Park). He was survived by his wife, Portia Henrietta Peale. Legacy Barney's North Sydney house, Wotonga, was later acquired by the Commonwealth and, after extensions, became Admiralty House, the Sydney residence of the Governor-General of Australia. There is a monument to George Barney in The Rocks, Sydney (). Mount Barney in the Scenic Rim Region of Queensland is named after him. The suburb of Barney Point in Gladstone, Queensland is named after him.

Reelected in 1998 and 2002, she lost her bid for another term in 2006 and her term ended in January 2007. Labor Commissioner =1994 election= Reneau and three others, Mike Fair, Milton Stavinsky, and Jim Marshall, sought the Republican nomination for Labor Commissioner in 1994. Fair was a State Senator and his friend Marshall was a Republican Party activist. Reneau had been a registered Democrat until switching to Republican on June 13, 1994, one month before filing to run, even though state law requires candidates to be a member of their party for at least six months prior to declaring themselves candidate. However, the only provision to remove a candidate for failing to meet the registration requirement is for another candidate for the same office to file a challenge within the two day protest period following the candidate registration deadline, and no one did so. Fair was challenged, by his friend and fellow candidate Jim Marshall, over a provision in the state constitution preventing state legislators from serving in any position where the salary was increased during the legislator's term. After the state election board upheld the challenge, Fair, Marshall and Reneau appeared at a press conference where Fair endorsed Reneau, as did Marshall even though Marshall would still be on the ballot as a candidate for the same office.\\"Fair Loses Attempt To Get on Ballot,\\" The Oklahoman, August 2, 1994.\\"Reneau's Party Switch Could Have Invalidated Candidacy,\\" The Oklahoman, November 5, 1995.

Services include hydraulic fracturing, coiled tubing, cementing and other well stimulation techniques designed to help increase the production of oil and natural gas.  Business  Based on horsepower, Calfrac is one of the largest hydraulic fracturing companies in the world. History Calfrac Well Services Ltd. (CWS) was founded in June 1999 as a private corporation by Ronald P. Mathison, Douglas Ramsay, Gordon Dibb, and Robert (Robbie) Roberts. At that time, Calfrac had a single coiled tubing unit and was based in Medicine Hat, Alberta. In December 2000, Calfrac acquired Dynafrac Well Services Ltd. and with it a two-pumper fracturing spread, a shallow coiled tubing unit, a high rate nitrogen pumper and four acid pumpers. By the spring of 2001, Calfrac had acquired and constructed seven fracturing spreads plus other well stimulation equipment. Early in 2002, CWS expanded to the U.S. Rocky Mountain region and started offering fracturing services through a field office in Platteville, Colorado. Calfrac continued to construct more fracturing spreads in 2002 and 2003, and had nine complete spreads by the start of 2004. In addition to building fracturing spreads in 2003, CWS also purchased four shallow coiled tubing units from private companies to increase its fleet of coiled tubing units to eight. In 2005, the company continued to expand and entered Russia to provide coiled tubing services. In 2007, Calfrac entered the Latin America market. Between 2007 and 2013, the company continued to expand through organic growth and strategic acquisitions. In 2015, Calfrac became the first pressure pumping company to receive the American Petroleum Institute's (API) Specification Q2.

By a 5‚Äì3 margin, the Court upheld the conviction of a Missouri man for selling heroin even though all the drug sold was supplied to him, he claimed, by a Drug Enforcement Administration informant who had, in turn, gotten it from the DEA. The majority held that the record showed Hampton was predisposed to sell drugs no matter his source.. The case came before the court when the defendant argued that while he was predisposed, it was irrelevant since the government's possible role as sole supplier in the case constituted the sort of \\"outrageous government conduct\\" that Justice William Rehnquist had speculated could lead to the reversal of a conviction in the court's last entrapment case, United States v. Russell.. Rehnquist was not impressed and rejected the argument in his majority opinion. The dissents agreed that the government's purported action was outrageous and that the conviction should be overturned on those grounds. The justices were among those who had said in Russell that the \\"subjective\\" entrapment standard adopted by the Court since it first recognized entrapment as a valid defense in Sorrells v. United States,. was less fair and appropriate than the \\"objective\\" standard of evaluating official conduct, which dissents and concurrences in entrapment cases over the years had argued for. However, this was the last entrapment case to feature that conflict. Background of the case In late February 1974, Hampton and a DEA informant known as Hutton were playing pool at the Pud bar in St. Louis when Hampton noticed the needle marks on Hutton's arms. He said he needed money and could obtain heroin to sell. Hutton responded that he could find a buyer. After the conversation, he called his handler, DEA agent Terry Sawyer, and reported the proposal. At 10 p.m. on February 25, Hampton and Hutton met the undercover Sawyer and another DEA agent, McDowell, and sold him a tiny packet of heroin for $145. Hampton told the agents that he could get more and gave him his phone number. Sawyer called the next day and arranged another deal. Later, in a parked car, Hampton gave Sawyer another packet, whereupon he said he had to get the money from the trunk. When he opened it, other agents moved in to arrest Hampton. Lower courts =Trial= Hampton's story was very different from the one presented by federal prosecutors. He claimed Hutton had, in response to his cash flow problems, come up with the idea to sell not heroin but a fake, perfectly legal, he thought. Previous to the deals with the DEA the two had, he said, already sold it to one gullible buyer and that he solicited the agents in order to make more money. At no time had he ever believed the two were actually selling heroin, he claimed. He raised the entrapment defense but proposed an alternate to the standard entrapment instruction. The jury chose not to believe him and convicted. =Appeal= The Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the conviction, relying on the Supreme Court's Russell holding. The Court thereby rejected Hampton's argument that, whatever his predisposition, the conduct of the government operatives in his narrative was outrageous enough to trump it.  Supreme Court case The Supreme Court granted certiorari on the entrapment question alone. =Decision= Majority Rehnquist said that Hampton had misunderstood his comments about outrageous government conduct in Russell, and then said it didn't apply here. \\"Admittedly petitioner's case is different from Russell's but the difference is one of degree, not of kind\\". He conceded that the government's role, at least in the defense case, was more significant but stuck with the admitted predisposition towards drug dealing in rejecting any entrapment claim. Again, he decisively rejected any effort to assert the objective standard. \\"The limitations of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment come into play only when the Government activity in question violates some protected right of the defendant\\", he wrote, in a comment read as scaling back his Russell aside. \\"(T)he police conduct here no more deprived defendant of any right secured to him by the United States Constitution than did the police conduct in Russell deprive Russell of any rights.\\" =Concurrence= While likewise rejecting Hampton's defense, Lewis Powell and Harry Blackmun took issue with what they saw as Rehnquist's overly broad assertion that (as they put it), \\"the concept of fundamental fairness inherent in the guarantee of due process would never prevent the conviction of a predisposed defendant, regardless of the outrageousness of police behavior in light of the surrounding circumstances.\\" \\"I do not understand Russell or earlier cases delineating the predisposition-focused defense of entrapment to have gone so far\\", Powell wrote. He noted that the jurisprudence was very limited, and that the Court had, for one, not yet had the opportunity to consider an entrapment claim from some source other than controlled-substance enforcement. \\"In these circumstances, I am unwilling to conclude that an analysis other than one limited to predisposition would never be appropriate under due process principles\\". Dissent William Brennan made the argument once again for the \\"objective\\" entrapment standard from previous concurrences and dissents, and said that this would necessitate overturning the conviction. He also said that he did not find the defendant predisposed to commit the crime either. \\"(T)he Government's role in the criminal activity involved in this case was more pervasive than the Government involvement in Russell ... In my view, the police activity in this case was beyond permissible limits.\\" He contrasted the two cases, noting that in the earlier case the government agent had merely supplied an ingredient for the manufacture of methamphetamine that was legal yet difficult to obtain, and one the defendant in that case had demonstrably been able to obtain from other sources than the government undercover agent. As well, in Russell the illegal manufacturing operation had been producing the drug well before the federal operation began. But in the instant case, not only was the heroin a completely illegal substance, it had been supplied wholly by the DEA. There was also no evidence introduced beyond his admission as such that Hampton had been dealing drugs prior to Hutton's approach. \\"The beginning and end of this crime thus coincided exactly with the Government's entry into and withdrawal from the criminal activity involved in this case, while the Government was not similarly involved in Russell's crime\\". He responded quite strongly to Rehnquist: > Whether the differences from the Russell situation are of degree or of kind > ... I think they clearly require a different result. Where the Government's > agent deliberately sets up the accused by supplying him with contraband and > then bringing him to another agent as a potential purchaser, the > Government's role has passed the point of toleration ... The Government is > doing nothing less than buying contraband from itself through an > intermediary and jailing the intermediary ... There is little, if any, law > enforcement interest promoted by such conduct; plainly it is not designed to > discover ongoing drug traffic. Rather, such conduct deliberately entices an > individual to commit a crime. That the accused is \\"predisposed\\" cannot > possibly justify the action of government officials in purposefully creating > the crime. No one would suggest that the police could round up and jail all > \\"predisposed\\" individuals, yet that is precisely what set-ups like the > instant one are intended to accomplish. In any case where an individual was prosecuted for selling drugs provided to him by a government operative, he said, conviction should be barred as a matter of law. Justice John Paul Stevens, then newly appointed to the Court, took no part in the case. Subsequent jurisprudence *Jacobson v. United States, . The Court finally does consider an entrapment case from outside drug enforcement, and narrowly overturns the conviction of a Nebraska man for ordering child pornography after two years of being cajoled by material created by postal inspectors. Held: the government must show that predisposition existed before the government became involved, and legal behavior does not constitute a predisposition to violate the law after such conduct becomes illegal.

In his capacity as the director of the Quimin Research Institute in Beijing, Li supported farmers in seeking compensation for confiscated farmland. He was arrested in 2004 following his involvement in the Tangshan protest, which led to international attention being paid to his plight by human rights groups. Li was the victim of a physical assault in 2016. He died in February 2018, with the Chinese government attributing his death to liver disease. This provoked controversy, with media outlets considering his demise to be \\"suspicious\\", given the Chinese government's track record on human rights. Biography Li was born in a mountain village in Jiahe County, Hunan province. He was the youngest son among seven children in poor family. When his father died Li was only 7 years old. Career =Teaching= Li studied Philosophy, Politics and Law at university, obtaining his Masters and Doctoral degrees from Peking University. In 1997, he became Professor of Law at Hainan University, but lost the role after being arrested the following year. =Tangshan protest= Li became known to the international community in 2004 as a result of his efforts to promote the rights of farmers in the Tangshan protest. Along with Yu Meisun and Zhao Yan, Li provided an advice to the farmers in Hebei Province who were resettled to make way for the Taolinkou reservoir, some east of Beijing. The farmers asserted that their compensation was not received as a result of corruption and misappropriation by officials from the local Government. Led by Zhang Youren, a peasant activist, more than 11,000 displaced farmers signed a petition calling for the dismissal of the Municipal Party Secretary, Zhang He. Boguang aided the peasants in the organization of the protest, gaining him international attention, and resulting in his arrest. However, he was subsequently released. As a direct result of the Tangshan Protest Zhang Youren was detained, and a crackdown on rights activists was instigated by the authorities. =Other farmers' protests= In the same year, Li published an article which examined the impact of corruption on the lives of farmers. The article, entitled \\"Can Citizens Dismiss a Mayor\\" was published in Modern Civilisation Pictorial, No 12.PRC: Arrest of Writers, International PEN, January 04, 2005, , Reportedly, Li Boguang also advised farmers in Fu‚Äôan, a coastal city in the North of Fujian Province. Once again, farmers sought to create and deliver a petition to the central government regarding a land dispute.PRC: Human Rights Defenders at Risk, Amnesty International, March 01, 2005 A hallmark of the protests in both Fujian and Hebei was the immense pressure that was put on villagers by the police force to denounce Li Boguang and his fellow activists. This culminated in December 2004, when Li was arrested by the police in Fu‚Äôan. He was charged with defrauding farmers. Police reportedly searched his home in Beijing, confiscating computers and documents. In March 2005, AFP reported that Li had been released on condition that he remain in Beijing and have no contact with farmers or others seeking to petition the government about abuses by local officials.Annual Report 2005, Committee of Concerned Scientists Chinese Authorities Release Farmers' Rights Activist, Congressional Executive Commission on China, March 14, 2005 The actual date of release was later reported as 21 January.List of imprisoned and detained petitioner activists, Human Rights Watch, December 2005 =Religious activism= There have been claims that Li was affiliated with the Fangzhou Congregation, a Chinese house church situated in Beijing's Chaoyang district. Other members of the influential church include Gao Zhisheng and Yu Jie, founder of the Chinese branch of International PEN.Writer held as China turns on intellectuals, The Guardian, December 22, 2004 He also defended multiple Christians who had been arrested by the government, protecting them from perceived persecution. =Book business= While proofreading in 1998, Li once read the Victorian era writer Samuel Smiles works and was touched by the author, so he decided to translate and publish the Samuel Smiles' works. Also he translated other writers like Robert A. Dahl, Niccol√≤ Machiavelli etc. and published the books through Chinese publishing houses. =Trip to the US= Li was invited to visit the United States of America by non-governmental organization \\"China Aid\\" and the Institute on Chinese Law & Religion to join the China Freedom Summit in May 2005. Then Li and other members of the summit met also with the President of United States George W. Bush in the White House on 11 May. =Baptism= Li was so touched by works by Samuel Smiles, so he started to read the Bible in 1999. He began to visit a Beijing church in 2005 and was baptized on 30 July 2005 there. Death Li Boguang's death was reported by the Chinese government on 26 February 2018, with the cause of death attributed to liver disease, despite his clear health record. Allegations of foul play However, this description courted controversy, with activists and media outlets alike considering his demise to be \\"suspicious\\", and allegations that the government report was not credible. Bob Fu, president of China Aid, demanded that the Chinese government provide a transparent account of Li's death. Christian Solidarity Worldwide also considered the death to be \\"suspicious\\", and refuted the official account as Li's health was very good prior to his death. The death served to return attention to China's human rights record and the welfare of those who oppose the authorities. The government's treatment of Li was already under scrutiny following the assault perpetrated by men with alleged ties to the Communist Party of China in 2016, and further threats which had allegedly been levied against him. International commentators remarked on the similarity between Li's death and that of Nobel Laureate Liu Xiaobo in 2017.

Such dancing is quite common to folk ritual in many parts of the world. Weapon dancing is certainly ancient; among the earliest historical references we have are those that refer to the pyrrhichios, a weapon dance in ancient Sparta, in which the dance was used as a kind of ritual training for battle. There are virtually no parts of the world left where the weapon dance is directly connected with imminent or recent combat. This is especially true of European states, which have long since moved away from the tribalism that usually gives rise to such folk dances. It is, however, also true of parts of the world where tribal traditions have succumbed to colonialism and the forces of globalism. The dances that one sees today are often part of general movements to preserve and rejuvenate tribal or local traditions. Some of these movements are quite strong now, such as those among native North American tribes and the aboriginal peoples of Australia. Related to weapon dances and war dances is the dance of the hunt. A very early reference to a weapon dance of the hunt comes in the form of a rock carving at √áatal H√∂y√ºk, the large neolithic settlement in south-central Anatolia. It depicts a hunting ritual involving dancers holding their bows; one figure has a bow in each hand, two perform artistic leaps and another holds a horn-shaped stick and is striking a frame drum. Function In the modern world, dance has come to be regarded as something one does for recreation, thus distancing dance from the important place it has held in many human cultures throughout history‚Äîthat is, a method of expression, preservation and transmission of the culture and history of a people. Many of the activities that humans have engaged in for millennia (religion and courtship, for example) have traditionally found expression in various kinds of dance. Another activity‚Äîcombat‚Äîhas obviously been central to the life of most human cultures; thus, one expects to find dances that celebrate skill in the use of weapons. Indeed, there is a wide range of such weapon dances in the world; they vary from general displays of prowess in the use of weapons to reenactments of real episodes of combat specific to a given culture. Examples =Europe= Early examples of sword and spear dances can be found amongst the Germanic tribes of Northern Europe, such as those mentioned by Tacictus, the Norse peoples and the Anglo-Saxon tribes. The Sutton Hoo is thought to show figures dancing with spears. Other references to such traditions include that in \\"Constantine VII Porphrogenitus‚Äô Book of Ceremonies\\" (from c. 953) which describes the Varangian Guard (a group made up of Norse and later English and Anglo-Danish warriors) dancing in two circles, with some wearing skins or masks, along with chants of ‚ÄúTo√∫l!‚Äù and clashing staves on shields.http://www.ormsgard.org/speardance.html Sword dancing exists in some parts of Europe. The weapon may be used to act out mock combat during the dance, or may be incorporated as an element of the dance itself, intertwining with other swords. In some places, sticks are used instead of swords. Iberian stick dances (paulitos, paloteos, ball de bastons) display two opposite rows of dancers. A common sword dance in Europe is the moresca in Spain, in which the dance recalls the strife between Christians and Muslims in that country from the 12th to 15th centuries. The gun parade of Moros y Cristianos also celebrates these battles, as does the British morris dance. In North Macedonia and Northern Italy, weapon dances may be used to exorcise evil spirits before a wedding. Sabre dancing exists in the Balkans; the most famous of these is from Albania, where two male rivals simulate a duel over a woman. Northern-Portuguese jogo do pau involves two rivals with long sticks. Other weapons, such as axes (or wooden versions thereof) may be used in some places. In parts of Europe, there are lance dances, dagger dances, and even rifle dances. In the Scottish Highlands, there are dances that used the Lochaber axe, the broadsword, targe & dirk, and the flail. The Highland Dirk Dance, resembles a combative dance similar to those of Indonesian pencak silat, which has the performer executing knife techniques combined with wrestling style kicks, trips, and sweeps. Boxing Day 2005 ‚Äì The Grenoside Sword Dance Captain holds aloft the sword lock before placing it around his neck Hilt-and-point sword dances exist in many places in Europe. In this kind of dance the swords interlock to form a ‚Äúrose,‚Äù or ‚Äúlock,‚Äù that is placed around the neck of a participant to simulate decapitation. As well, crossed-sword dances are common in Europe. Typically, dancers execute complicated patterns of steps over and between the swords. In some variations, clay pipes may replace the swords. Many European sword dances were appropriated by trade guilds, with tools replacing the swords. In Turkey and Greece there exists a butchers‚Äô dance called the hassapikos. It is now a social dance, but goes back to a battle mime in the Middle Ages performed with swords and performed by members of by the butchers' guild. Also in Turkey are the so-called ‚Äúguerrilla dances‚Äù, performed by dances arranged in a circle who make swishing and whiffling sounds with their swords (possibly to clear the area of evil spirits), followed by mock combat. Chain-sword dance is a group dance in which the dancers first use a sword or other implement (stick, stave, etc.) to link themselves in a chain. In the Hungarian tradition, the Erd≈ëb√©nye cooper dance represents this form of dance. More≈°ka, a sword dance on the Croatian island of Korƒçula in the Adriatic, recalls combat between Christians and Moros (Moors), though in the 19th century the dance changed from Christians vs. Moors to Turks vs. Moors. Historically, the Hungarian heyduck dance was a soldiers' dance that involved virtuoso whirling of weapons and free-form compositions with battle practice motifs. Such dances also appear in Gypsy, Slovak, Ruthenian, and Transylvanian folklore. In many of these areas, the so- called \\"stick dancing\\" of shepherds is a reenactment of combat with real weapons. In a few isolated sections of Europe, a rather savage male combat dance survives. In the villages of the Transylvania Alps and Carpathian mountains, before Twelfth Night and Whitsunday, nine men from nine villages assemble for the Joc de cƒÉlu≈üari or cƒÉlu≈ü, a rite of initiation. The men engage in fierce battle with sticks, which used to be bloody and sometimes fatal. Basque dances Dancers from Markina, Basque Country. Some of the Basque dances feature weapons. The ezpatadantzadantza: ezpatadantza and ezpatadantza in the Spanish-language Au√±amendi Encyclopedia. (\\"sword dance\\") comes from the Durango area and is danced for authorities and in the feast of Corpus Christi. After the dance, both opposing rows of dancers raise their weapons and form a corridor for the authorities. The ezpatadantza and the makildantza (\\"stick dance\\") employs makila (traditional Basque walking sticks), and ends with the dancers raising one of them, lying as a fallen warrior, over their heads. In the Basque province of Gipuzkoa in Spain, the Okrabario Dantza is performed in Legazpi‚Äîa sword dance in which a participant dances atop a grid of crossed swords held aloft. In Tolosa, on Midsummer Day, the Bordon-Dantza (\\"walking stick dance\\") is performed with the figures of the ezpatadantza; someBordon-dantza in the Spanish-language Au√±amendi Encyclopedia. point its origins to the border fights in the Middle Ages, when the Castilian troops from Gipuzkoa won an important victory over the troops from Navarre at the Battle of Beotibar. Sticks simulate some weapons, and halberds--a combination of a spear and a battle-axe--are also used. =Asia= Baris is a traditional dance of Bali, in which a solo dancer depicts the feelings of a young warrior prior to battle. Originally, Baris was performed as a religious ritual. The dancer may bear a kris, a spear, a bow, or other weapons, depending on the variant performed. The word \\"Baris\\" literally means \\"line\\" or \\"file\\", and referred to the line of soldiers who served the rajas of Bali. The dance is usually performed by men in a group with as few as four dancers and as many as sixty. The ritualistic function of the dance is to show physical maturity by demonstrating military skills, particularly the use of weapons. In China, dances with weapon have been recorded for a long time. The founder of the Han Dynasty Liu Bang was said to be fond of the war dance of the Ba people. Large-scale performances of the dance involved the brandishing of various weapons to the accompaniment of drums and songs in the Ba language. It remained popular through the Tang Dynasty and spread as far as Central Asia. The development of art dance, in general, in China reached its peak during the Tang dynasty and then was largely integrated into Chinese Opera practice. Tribal weapon dancing may also be present among the original aboriginal tribes on Taiwan (The Republic of China). The Shaolin martial arts employ weapons in ways that are sometimes enjoyed for aesthetic reasons, however, similar to a dance. Shaolin spear, Yezhan spear, Lanmen spear, and sword and stick exercises may be included. T'ai chi ch'uan also incorporates sword practise in a similar way. The Dayak people of Borneo are renowned for their solo sword dances, which show the skill of a young man using a sharp mandau. Also on the island of Borneo one finds the Lotud, an indigenous ethnic group residing in Sabah. The Lotud are well known for their very colourful costumes and their dances, one of which is the Bakanjar, a war-like dance with a man holding a sword and a shield, originally performed to portray the sword fight and heroic exploits of the headhunting days. In the Indian subcontinent, the sword dance Choliya or Saraon of the Kumaon region of the hills of the Indian state of Uttarakhand started partly due to their long martial tradition and also to give protection to marriage processions. It was also held auspicious and, according to Hindu tradition, warded off evil spirits. It has a very beautiful and graceful form and has techniques which give it the status of a martial art. Among the traditional weapon dances of India is the Shad Sukmynsiem, performed in the north-eastern state of Meghalaya. Both Christians and Hindus may take part as long as they belong to Khasi community. Young lads clad in colourful silk dhotis dance around with a sword or spear in one hand and a plume in the other. The move in a protective circle around an inner circle of young maidens. A popular dance in Mizoram in the north-east corner of India is Sawlakin, a word that \\"means spirit of the slain.\\" Traditionally, the dance was led by the warrior who had hunted a big game or killed a man. He would wear his best clothes and a plume of red feather. He would wield a gun or dao and a shield. He would be followed by other dancers in a row, who would also carry weapons, or cymbals or gongs. The Pashtuns of Afghanistan practice a wide range of weapon dances, including the Khattak Wal Atanrh ( named after the Khattak tribe) and the Mahsood Wal Atanrh (which, in modern times, involves the juggling of loaded rifles). A sub-type of the Khattak Wal Atanrh known as the Braghoni involves the use of up to three swords and requires great skill to successfully execute. =Middle East and Asia Minor= There are a number of Arab weapon dances, including the Razfah. It was originally practiced at Manga in Muscat, prior to going out on a raid; the object of the dance was to \\"warm up\\" for the combat to come. Also, on the Arabian peninsula a dance named Ardah recalls pre-Islamic tribal battles. Two rows of men face one another, clapping, singing, and dancing in a lively manner, accompanied by large frame drums. At the peak of the dance two swordsmen perform a duel between the rows of dancers. The Assyrian minority in Syria have a dramatic folk dance called Shora, which commemorates the bloody battles fought by the Ancient Assyrians back in their time consisting of a leader (usually a man) in front with a sword otherwise known as a saypa and a line of men joining together. Generally speaking, a number of dances (known as Razfah or Ayala) of Bedouin origin use weapons and have achieved modern popularity in the Arab states of the Persian Gulf and are associated with festive occasions among the non-Bedouin sedentary population. In Iran there exists the √á√ªb-B√¢z√Æ (\\"stick game\\"; or raqs-e √ß√ªb, \\"stick dance\\"), a dance form that probably has its origins in reenactments of combat. Essentially, an attacker and a defender duel with poles. The √ß√ªb-b√¢z√Æ is ‚Äú‚Ä¶both a dance and a show of skill and bravery; participants are judged by their abilities in the combat aspects, as well as by their grace in executing the dance movements.‚Äù =Africa= In South Africa, such dances as the Zulu Indlamu, the traditional dance most often associated with Zulu culture, is performed with drums and full traditional attire and is derived from the war dances of the warriors. Also, the military influence of the warrior King Shaka is reflected in demonstrations of stick fighting (umshiza) with which the male teenagers and men settle their personal differences in a public duel. The Jerusema (or Mbenede) dance of the Zezuru people in Zimbabwe is an interesting kind of hybrid war dance--\\"hybrid\\" in the sense that music and dance formed a part of the actual battle-field preparations, themselves, as well as of the ritual dance recalling the battle. (The Zezuru are one of the Shona peoples who were the builders of the great monuments of the Monomotapa kingdom in Zimbabwe between the 10th and 15th centuries.) The dance is a re-creation of a battle strategy developed by the Zezuru in the 19th century against incursions of other tribes in the wake of colonialist expansion of the Boers. The dance, itself, recalls the music and dance used as a diversionary tactic on the battlefield to distract the enemy while Zezuru warriors maneuvered into position; thus, the ritual dance involves the music and dance of the ‚Äúdistractors‚Äù as well as warriors with weapons moving into position. Ethiopia has a long, historical reputation as a place where the weapon dance plays an important cultural role. According to Lucian, a Greek writer from the 2nd century, ‚ÄúThe Ethiopians dance also during the battle. The Ethiopian never shoots his arrow without dancing and making a menacing gesture beforehand. He wants to frighten the enemy by his dance beforehand.‚Äù The broad range of weapon dances includes the hota jumping dance of Amharic males; the attack dance of the Hailefo; the stick-dance of the Kullo; the Beroronsi Hama Haban, a dramatic dagger dance of the Esa; and the shire, the saber dance of the Tigrean nomadic shepherds. The Lucian quote is cited in this source as being from ‚ÄúConversations About the Dance.‚Äù =Australia, New Zealand and Polynesia= Two MƒÅori men wielding taiaha. In Australia, Contains a thorough review of dance research in Australia. there are aboriginal dances that reenact hunting and combat using traditional weapons such as the boomerang. Sometimes two boomerangs are clapped together as a musical instrument to provide sounds for dances. In New Zealand, Maori have raised the martial art associated with the taiaha and mere to the level of a weapon dance. The haka could also be considered as a weapon dance, as it includes elements of warlike challenge to chanting and musical (sung) accompaniment. The Nifo oti, or Samoan fire knife dance, is also a kind of weapon dance. The kailao is a standing male war dance of Tonga. The kailao is performed by men (less commonly women also perform it with the men as a mixed dance), who carry clubs or fighting sticks. The performers dance in a fierce manner to emulate combat, all to the accompaniment of a slit drum or a tin box. Additional idiophonic percussion is provided by strung rattles worn on the anklets of the dancers, and the clashing together of the wooden implements of war, which today are either sticks or mock weapons. The dance is unusual for Tonga in that it lacks recited poetry as accompaniment, which fact is taken to mean that it was imported to Tonga from elsewhere. =North and Central America= So-called ‚Äúwar dances‚Äù of indigenous North American tribes may also be classified as weapon dances. Recent interest in preserving Native American traditions has led to such groups as The Warriors of AniKituhwa, a Cherokee dance group who recreate Cherokee dances, including the war dance, do research and offer dance workshops for their community. A dance such as the Comanche Sun Dance of the 1870s was an invocation of invulnerability to the White Man's bullets; the dance was a preliminary ritual to battle and would be a war dance and, hence, a weapon dance. Also, the moresca (or morisca) (above) exists in some areas in the Americas that used to be Spanish colonies--Mexico, for example. In the Jamiltepec region of Mexico, there exists perhaps the most colorful version of that kind of dance, the Chareos dance. It represents a battle between Moors, led by Pilate, and Christians, led by James, the apostle. Sixteen male dancers take part and the dancer who plays the part of James appears as a horse rider and wears a costume that incorporates a white horse. The dancers wear ostrich feathers on their heads, a peacock feather at the front, white cotton square over their shoulders, velvet trousers decorated with gold brocade over white cotton pants and carry a machete. In addition, the leader has a hat with a small mirror and a white feather headdress. Two men at the front carry two red flags and two white flags, red symbolizing the blood spilt by James' soldiers and white symbolizing the peace that reigned after the Christian victory. The sounds of drums and flutes accompany the dance. These dances that pit Christian against Moor are almost certainly Christianized versions of earlier, pre-Cortez dances that ritualized the battle between the tiger and the eagle. Though sources generally say \\"tiger\\" in the context of these dances, the reference is not to Felis tigris--the Asian tiger--but to Felis onca, the American big cat generally known by its native name, jaguar, from the Tupi language. Similar to the Moor-Christian confrontation of the morisca‚Äîwhether in Spain or in transplanted versions in Central America‚Äîthere are also elaborate ritual dances in Mexico such as the Danza de la Pluma that exploit the trauma of the Spanish conquest of indigenous America. Weapons employed may be swords (and shields) whips, even firearms. These representations take place over a large area of Mesoamerica and, in part, are an obvious adaptation of Spanish tradition, but in Mexico will pit the native Aztec against the Spanish invader. The most interesting aspect of these dances is that‚Äîdepending on where one sees them and under what conditions‚Äîit is plausible to read into the dances an outcome other than the historical Spanish victory. That is, indigenous performers may take inspiration from the fact that the natives of Spain drove out the Moorish invaders; thus, the natives of Mesoamerica, too, shall one day drive out the invaders. Some dances that abound at Carnival and Corpus Christi fiestas go back to pre-Conquest ritual combat dances of the Aztecs. For example, during the 15th month of the Aztec calendar, Huitzilopochtli, god of the sun and war was honored by real duels between slave victims and mimed battles among masked boy votaries. Also, among the N√°huatl-speaking people in the Pacific Ocean region of Michoac√°n, there is the cuauileros\\" dance (the cudgelers' dance). The performance of this dance represents a battle between Aztecs and Spaniards, and dancers perform with rattles made of thin metal plates and wooden cudgels. =South America= Capoeira or the Dance of War by Johann Moritz Rugendas, 1825, published 1835 The landscape of all dance in a large country such as Brazil is rich and complex due to the mixing of three separate traditions‚ÄîIndian native, Black African, and Portuguese. In Brazil, the African influence on Brazilian folkdances is considerable. For example, capoeira--a dance-like fighting style--and the maculel√™ fighting dance are strongly reminiscent of African dances. Capoeira is of particular interest. In the 19th century, Capoeira was played mostly by African slaves who had been brought from West Central Africa, making them the original capoeristas and making the art a complex form of social interaction, expressing the participants' physical skills and spiritual essence, involving the gods and the spirits of the ancestral fathers. The participants played during festivals and holidays, jumping and leaping in front of musical bands, military troops, and religious processions. This dance ‚Äúgame‚Äù was considered dangerous to public order and was eventually criminalized in the late 19th century. Today, capoeira has staged somewhat of a comeback and is even studied in dance academies as part of a general movement to rejuvenate folk traditions. Capoeira may be played unarmed or with blades held in the hands or feet. The sticks used as mock weapons in some of these dances also serve as percussion instruments. In the southern state of Rio Grande do Sul, the machete, a tool used to cut jungle brush, is used in a dance called dan√ßa dos fac√µes (dance of the machetes). In this dance (historically performed only by men, although this trend changes as the dance spreads), the dancers knock their machetes while dancing, simulating a battle. Machete are sometimes used in place of sticks in maculel√™. Weapon dance as art Since dance is already an art form, ‚Äúweapon dance as art‚Äù may seem redundant; yet, ‚Äúart‚Äù is used here to mean the re-creation, say, of a folk weapon dance in a more professional staged venue, such as a ballet, or when an Australian, Native American, or African troupe of professional musicians and dancers present a reenactment on stage of a weapon dance, or when the use of weapons is introduced in stylized dance enactments of fighting. For example, recent ballets such as the New York City Ballet‚Äôs version of Romeo and Juliet (to the music of Sergei Prokofiev) employ highly choreographed sword-fight/dance sequences. Additionally, there is overlap between weapon dance and stylized forms of stage combat, i.e., choreographed enactments of ‚Äúreal fights,‚Äù from bar-room brawls to sword- fighting to large-scale battle scenes. Stage combat uses the services of professionals called ‚Äúfight directors,‚Äù ‚Äúweapon choreographers,‚Äù etc. An early example of this kind of staged combat in Europe was in Italy in the late 19th century, where the term tramagnini came to be used generically in the sense of ‚Äúextra‚Äù or ‚Äústunt man‚Äù for those who fought on the stage in enactments of battle scenes in grand opera, for example. Tramagnini was originally a family name in Florence and referred to members of the family who started a gymnastics club and soon wound up appearing on stage in enactments of fighting, both bare-handed and with weapons. Elsewhere, the kabuki theater tradition in Japan employs ritualized representations of violence on the stage. While kabuki is technically theater and not dance, the movements, for example, of the sword-fighting termed tachimawari in kabuki are gymnastic to the point even of employing somersaults, and elaborate fight scenes are so deliberate and stylized that they provide at least an area of overlap between theater and dance. Also, the Communist revolution in China produced the view that art‚Äîincluding dance‚Äîmust support the ‚Äúarmed struggle of the proletariat.‚Äù By the 1970s, weapons commonly appeared in such works as \\"Red Detachment of Women,‚Äô‚Äô a ballet about a women‚Äôs revolutionary armed force in the 1930s in China. Interesting, perhaps, in the use of weapons in these recent ‚Äúrevolutionary‚Äù works is that they are, generally speaking, not reenactments of traditional folk dances. The introduction of weaponry into Chinese ballet‚Äîregardless of the revolutionary message‚Äîwas, itself, a revolution.

Jim (1915) 26 C.C.C. 236, was a decision by the British Columbia Supreme Court on Aboriginal (\\"Indian\\") hunting and provincial game laws. The Court found that Aboriginal hunting on Indian reserves is primarily federal jurisdiction, relating to section 91(24) of the British North America Act, 1867 which assigns \\"Indians, and Lands reserved for the Indians\\" to the federal government. Background The case involved an Aboriginal Chief named Edward Jim of the North Saanich tribe. In Victoria, British Columbia in 1914 a police magistrate convicted him of possession of a part of a deer in violation of the provincial Game Protection Act. Jim had hunted the deer on a reserve and used the meat in his home. Jim fought the charges against him by saying he had treaty rights, and that the British North America Act and federal Indian Act ensured the province could not apply this law to Aboriginals. Decision Justice Hunter, on the BC Supreme Court, found that the conviction should be overturned. He pointed to section 91(24) of the British North America Act to note that \\"Indians\\" are under federal jurisdiction. The federal government had then enacted the Indian Act, and it stated that \\"Indian lands\\" are \\"managed\\" by the Governor in Council. Hunter interpreted the word \\"managed\\" to be broad in its application, and it should include governing hunting and fishing on reserves (Indian lands). Hunter also noted the federal government did regulate Aboriginal hunting in other provinces, suggesting it would have jurisdiction in British Columbia as well. The fact that there was no such regulation in British Columbia at the time possibly related to treaties. Aftermath Generally, provincial laws apply to Aboriginals. Provincial laws do not apply when they affect \\"Indianness,\\" primary Aboriginal issues. As constitutional scholar Peter Hogg writes, \\"Hunting on a reserve is such a significant element of traditional Indian ways that it should probably be free of provincial regulation.\\" He points to R. v. Jim to back this up. As for hunting outside reserves, the Supreme Court of Canada case Kruger and al. v. The Queen (1978) suggested this was not \\"Indianness,\\" whereas Dick v. The Queen (1985) suggested it was.Hogg, Peter W. Constitutional Law of Canada. 2003 Student Ed. Scarborough, Ontario: Thomson Canada Limited, 2003, page 595.

LHPs are similar to heat pipes but have the advantage of being able to provide reliable operation over long distance and the ability to operate against gravity. They can transport a large heat load over a long distance with a small temperature difference. Different designs of LHPs ranging from powerful, large size LHPs to miniature LHPs (micro loop heat pipe) have been developed and successfully employed in a wide sphere of applications both ground and space-based applications. Construction The most common coolants used in LHPs are anhydrous ammonia and propylene.Loop Heat Pipe ‚Äì LHP LHPs are made by controlling the volumes of the reservoir carefully, condenser and vapor and liquid lines so that liquid is always available to the wick. The reservoir volume and fluid charge are set so that there is always fluid in the reservoir even if the condenser and vapor and liquid lines are completely filled. Generally small pore size and large capillary pumping capability are necessary in a wick. There must be a balance in the wick pumping capability and the wick permeability when designing a heat pipe or loop heat pipe. Mechanism In a loop heat pipe, first the heat enters the evaporator and vaporizes the working fluid at the wick outer surface. The vapor then flows down the system of grooves and then goes to the evaporator and the vapor line towards the condenser, where it condenses as heat is removed by the radiator. The two-phase reservoir (or compensation chamber) at the end of the evaporator is specifically designed to operate at a slightly lower temperature than the evaporator (and the condenser). The lower saturation pressure in the reservoir draws the condensate through the condenser and liquid return line. The fluid then flows into a central pipe where it feeds the wick. A secondary wick hydraulically links the reservoir and the primary wick. Motivation: limitations of heat pipes Loop heat pipes overcome some of the shortcomings of conventional heat pipes, which while being excellent heat transfer devices are mainly confined to transferring relatively small heat loads over relatively short distances when the evaporator and condenser are at same horizontal level. This limitation on the part of heat pipes is mainly related to the major pressure losses associated with the liquid flow through the porous structure, present along the entire length of the heat pipe, and viscous interaction between the vapor and liquid phases, also called entrainment losses. For the applications involving transfer of large heat loads over long distances, the thermal performance of the heat pipes is badly affected by increase in these losses. For the same reason conventional heat pipes are very sensitive to the change in orientation in gravitational field. For the unfavorable slopes in an evaporator-above-condenser configuration, the pressure losses due to the mass forces in gravity field adds to the total pressure losses and further affect the efficiency of the heat transfer process. As a result of these limitations, different solutions involving structural modifications to the conventional heat pipe have been proposed. Some of these modifications incorporate arterial tubes with considerably low hydraulic resistance for liquid return to the heat source (arterial heat pipes), while others provide spatial separation of the vapor and liquid phases of the working fluid at the transportation section (separated line heat pipes). Though these new forms of heat pipes are able to transfer significant heat flows and can increase heat transport length, they remain very sensitive to spatial orientation relative to gravity. To extend the functional possibilities of two-phase systems to applications involving otherwise inoperable slopes in gravity, the advantages provided by the spatial separation of the transportation line and the usage of non-capillary arteries are combined in a loop scheme. This scheme allows heat pipes to be created with higher heat transfer characteristics while maintaining normal operation in any directional orientation. The loop scheme forms the basis of the physical concept of Two-Phase Loops (TPLs). Origins Loop heat pipes were patented in USSR in 1974 by Yury F. Gerasimov and Yury F. Maydanik (Inventor's certificate ‚Ññ 449213), all of the former Soviet Union. The patent for LHPs was filed in the USA in 1982 (Patent ‚Ññ 4515209). Applications The first space application occurred aboard a Russian spacecraft in 1989. LHPs are now commonly used in space aboard satellites including; Russian Granat, Obzor spacecraft, Boeing‚Äôs (Hughes) HS 702 communication satellites, Chinese FY-1C meteorological satellite, NASA‚Äôs ICESat. LHPs were first flight demonstrated on the NASA space shuttle in 1997 with STS-83 and STS-94. Loop heat pipes are important parts of systems for cooling electronic components.

The first performance was at the Savoy Theatre, London, on 22 January 1903 and ran for 115 performances. The opera was the last new work produced by the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company at the Savoy Theatre, and is therefore considered by some to be the last Savoy opera. The original cast included a number of the famous Savoyards, including Louie Pounds, Robert Evett, Walter Passmore, Henry Lytton, and Rosina Brandram. After the original run at the Savoy, the show toured. After that tour, the cast mostly joined the new musical, The Earl and the Girl (also produced by Greet). The piece was given a Broadway production from August to October 1903.A Princess of Kensington at the IBDB Broadway Database, accessed 8 August 2010 Background Postcard, 1903 Following the successes of their earlier comic operas, The Emerald Isle and Merrie England, Basil Hood and Edward German collaborated once more. Despite a good reception from critics and Savoy opera devotees, the opera achieved a run of only 115 performances, owing partly to its dense plot and unwieldy libretto, and partly to the continued decline of comic operas in favour of George Edwardes-style musical comedies as the London theatregoing public's choice entertainment. Despite its relative failure compared to the other Savoy operas, A Princess of Kensington became popular enough to be one of the first operas to have original cast recordings of selections made during the original run. The recordings themselves were popular enough that a 1907 silent film of one of the songs, \\"Four Jolly Sailor Boys\\" [sic], was produced to be played synchronized to the recording. The fairy backstory of the plot is derived from a poem by Thomas Tickell entitled Kensington Garden, featuring the history of the characters Albion, Azuriel, Kenna, and Oberon.

Green and Louie Pounds as Joy * Act I ‚Äì Kensington Gardens ‚Äì Morning * Act II ‚Äì Winklemouth-on-Sea ‚Äì Afternoon The fairy prince, Azuriel, has been suffering from jealousy for a thousand years over the love shared by the lovely fairy Kenna (for whom Kensington is named) and the mortal Prince Albion. Although Albion is dead, the mischievous Puck has encouraged Azuriel's jealousy through the centuries. Puck, lying, claims that he taught Kenna a spell to awaken Albion after a thousand years. Azuriel's jealousy is inflamed at the thought that his rival might soon reawaken, and he demands that Albion be promptly married off to a mortal maiden. To calm the angry fairy prince, Puck and Kenna have to produce a false Albion and a false wedding. For their false Albion they choose a sailor, William Jelf, from the H.M.S. Albion. Jelf's cap conveniently bears the name \\"Albion\\". To provide a bride, Puck sees an opportunity in the appearance of two young lovers, Lieutenant Brook Green and Joy Jellicoe. Puck disguises himself as Sir James Jellicoe, Joy's father. He revokes Sir James's acceptance of Lt. Green as a husband for his daughter and encourages Jelf to woo the astonished Joy. An alehouse owner, Mr. Reddish, arrives with his daughter Nell, to whom Jelf is actually engaged. Reddish is anxious to get Nell off his hands as she is a prohibitionist reformer and has turned his pub into a coffee house, to the disgust of Mr. Reddish's cronies, one of whom happens to be Jelf's uncle. Reddish hopes to marry Nell to Jelf, if necessary by force. Reddish and Nell are unhappy with the state of affairs that they encounter. After additional complications, Azuriel is finally convinced that Albion is really dead, and the fairies can return to fairyland, where peace is restored. Joy can marry her lieutenant, and Nell decides to marry Jelf's uncle, her father's friend, who she believes deeply needs the benefits of her reforms.

The first high-speed craft were often hydrofoils or hovercraft, but in the 1990s catamaran and monohull designs become more popular and large hydrofoils and hovercraft are no longer built. Most high- speed craft serve as passenger ferries, but the largest catamarans and monohulls also carry cars, buses, large trucks and freight. In the 1990s there were a variety of builders, but many shipbuilders have withdrawn from this market so the construction of the largest fast ferries, up to 127 metres, has been consolidated to two Australian companies, Austal of Perth and Incat of Hobart. There is still a wide variety of builders for smaller fast catamaran ferries between 24 and 60 metres. Hulled designs are often powered by pump- jets coupled to medium-speed diesel engines. Hovercraft are usually powered by gas turbines or diesel engines driving propellers and impellers. The design and safety of high-speed craft is regulated by the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS) Convention, Chapter 10, High-Speed Craft (HSC) Codes of 1994 and 2000, adopted by the Maritime Safety Committee of the International Maritime Organization (IMO).

Unlike other Yamaha synthesizers of the time (SY77 and the SY99) the SY85 does not use FM synthesis. Instead, its sounds are based on samples, which can be layered and modified to create new sounds. User interface The workstation features a 61-note velocity-sensitive keyboard with aftertouch, a double density 3.5\\" floppy drive, a two line, 40 character LCD display, and a nine- track MIDI sequencer. It is a multitimbral synthesizer with 30-note polyphony and full MIDI capabilities. In addition to pitch and modulation wheels, the SY85 features eight continuous sliders that can be used to adjust various settings in real time. These sliders also function as faders when using the built-in sequencer. The SY85 features two independent effects units, which can be run in series or in parallel, each in turn providing either a single effect or two effects in parallel or cascade mode. Internal memory The SY85's internal voice memory holds 256 voices in four 64 slot banks. These can be played individually or layered, up to four at a time. The keyboard can be split to allow different voices or combinations of voices to be played only in particular regions. Up to 128 of these layered combinations can be stored in internal memory as 'performances' in two banks with also 64 slots each. The SY85 also features velocity switching, the ability to switch between two samples based on the speed with which a key is depressed. Voices can also be treated with a variety of filters, including a high-pass filter, low-pass filter, band-pass filter, and a band-elimination/band-stop filter. Sequencer The sequencer features eight standard tracks and a dedicated rhythm track. The tracks can be recorded in real or step time and quantized to 1/4, 1/6, 1/8, 1/12, 1/16, 1/24, and 1/32 values. The rhythm track is composed by combining any of 100 rhythm patterns, each of which can be edited independently. These patterns, however, are shared between songs. So changing a pattern will, for good or bad, change it in any song that uses it. The sequencer can store up to ten songs (20,000 notes, total) at a time. External memory Voice and sequencer data and samples can be loaded from or saved to 3.5\\" double-density floppy discs. Voices and performance combinations can also be loaded from or saved to Yamaha's proprietary MCD64 (64K RAM cards (one slot for such cards was provided, alongside one slot for a PCM 'waveform' ROM card). Yamaha and other manufacturers sold expansion sounds for the SY85 in both formats. The SY85 can also transmit and receive voice and sequencer data as MIDI sysex bulk dumps and load or send samples via the MIDI sample dump standard (SDS). Optional expansion As standard, 0.5MB of volatile user waveform RAM is provided, whose contents are lost when the device is switched off. It is expandable with one or two 512KB non-volatile, proprietary SYEMB06 RAM modules and up to 2MB of extra volatile RAM through standard SIMM modules. Users have reported using up to 8MB of volatile RAM successfully. Rack-mount version: TG500 Yamaha also offered a rack-mount version of the SY85 called the TG500. It lacks the keyboard, sequencer, floppy drive and continuous sliders but adds additional outputs, a further card slot of each kind (for four slots in total) and 2MB of waveform ROM for 50 additional internal waveforms for a total of 8MB over the 6MB of the SY85. It has four banks of preset (i.e. non-modifiable) voices (i.e. 252 preset voices and four drum voices in total) and two banks of preset performances (128 total) and only two banks of internal, user-modifiable voices (126/2) and one bank of internal performances (64). The TG500 lacks the waveform RAM of the SY85, but can be expanded with one or two SYEMB06 non-volatile waveform RAM modules. It also features 64 note polyphony, being one of the first commercial synthesisers to do so. Notable users The SY85 has been used by Gary Barlow, and can also be seen in the film School of Rock. The TG500 was used by George Michael.

Traditional honeypots are servers (or devices that expose server services) that wait passively to be attacked. Client Honeypots are active security devices in search of malicious servers that attack clients. The client honeypot poses as a client and interacts with the server to examine whether an attack has occurred. Often the focus of client honeypots is on web browsers, but any client that interacts with servers can be part of a client honeypot (for example ftp, ssh, email, etc.). There are several terms that are used to describe client honeypots. Besides client honeypot, which is the generic classification, honeyclient is the other term that is generally used and accepted. However, there is a subtlety here, as \\"honeyclient\\" is actually a homograph that could also refer to the first known open source client honeypot implementation (see below), although this should be clear from the context.  Architecture  A client honeypot is composed of three components. The first component, a queuer, is responsible for creating a list of servers for the client to visit. This list can be created, for example, through crawling. The second component is the client itself, which is able to make a requests to servers identified by the queuer. After the interaction with the server has taken place, the third component, an analysis engine, is responsible for determining whether an attack has taken place on the client honeypot. In addition to these components, client honeypots are usually equipped with some sort of containment strategy to prevent successful attacks from spreading beyond the client honeypot. This is usually achieved through the use of firewalls and virtual machine sandboxes. Analogous to traditional server honeypots, client honeypots are mainly classified by their interaction level: high or low; which denotes the level of functional interaction the server can utilize on the client honeypot. In addition to this there are also newly hybrid approaches which denotes the usage of both high and low interaction detection techniques.  High interaction  High interaction client honeypots are fully functional systems comparable to real systems with real clients. As such, no functional limitations (besides the containment strategy) exist on high interaction client honeypots. Attacks on high interaction client honeypots are detected via inspection of the state of the system after a server has been interacted with. The detection of changes to the client honeypot may indicate the occurrence of an attack against that has exploited a vulnerability of the client. An example of such a change is the presence of a new or altered file. High interaction client honeypots are very effective at detecting unknown attacks on clients. However, the tradeoff for this accuracy is a performance hit from the amount of system state that has to be monitored to make an attack assessment. Also, this detection mechanism is prone to various forms of evasion by the exploit. For example, an attack could delay the exploit from immediately triggering (time bombs) or could trigger upon a particular set of conditions or actions (logic bombs). Since no immediate, detectable state change occurred, the client honeypot is likely to incorrectly classify the server as safe even though it did successfully perform its attack on the client. Finally, if the client honeypots are running in virtual machines, then an exploit may try to detect the presence of the virtual environment and cease from triggering or behave differently. = Capture-HPC = Capture is a high interaction client honeypot developed by researchers at Victoria University of Wellington, NZ. Capture differs from existing client honeypots in various ways. First, it is designed to be fast. State changes are being detected using an event based model allowing to react to state changes as they occur. Second, Capture is designed to be scalable. A central Capture server is able to control numerous clients across a network. Third, Capture is supposed to be a framework that allows to utilize different clients. The initial version of Capture supports Internet Explorer, but the current version supports all major browsers (Internet Explorer, Firefox, Opera, Safari) as well as other HTTP aware client applications, such as office applications and media players. = HoneyClient = HoneyClient is a web browser based (IE/FireFox) high interaction client honeypot designed by Kathy Wang in 2004 and subsequently developed at MITRE. It was the first open source client honeypot and is a mix of Perl, C++, and Ruby. HoneyClient is state- based and detects attacks on Windows clients by monitoring files, process events, and registry entries. It has integrated the Capture-HPC real-time integrity checker to perform this detection. HoneyClient also contains a crawler, so it can be seeded with a list of initial URLs from which to start and can then continue to traverse web sites in search of client-side malware. = HoneyMonkey (dead since 2010) = HoneyMonkey is a web browser based (IE) high interaction client honeypot implemented by Microsoft in 2005. It is not available for download. HoneyMonkey is state based and detects attacks on clients by monitoring files, registry, and processes. A unique characteristic of HoneyMonkey is its layered approach to interacting with servers in order to identify zero-day exploits. HoneyMonkey initially crawls the web with a vulnerable configuration. Once an attack has been identified, the server is reexamined with a fully patched configuration. If the attack is still detected, one can conclude that the attack utilizes an exploit for which no patch has been publicly released yet and therefore is quite dangerous. = SHELIA (dead since 2009) = Shelia is a high interaction client honeypot developed by Joan Robert Rocaspana at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. It integrates with an email reader and processes each email it receives (URLs & attachments). Depending on the type of URL or attachment received, it opens a different client application (e.g. browser, office application, etc.) It monitors whether executable instructions are executed in data area of memory (which would indicate a buffer overflow exploit has been triggered). With such an approach, SHELIA is not only able to detect exploits, but is able to actually ward off exploits from triggering. = UW Spycrawler = The Spycrawler developed at the University of Washington is yet another browser based (Mozilla) high interaction client honeypot developed by Moshchuk et al. in 2005. This client honeypot is not available for download. The Spycrawler is state based and detects attacks on clients by monitoring files, processes, registry, and browser crashes. Spycrawlers detection mechanism is event based. Further, it increases the passage of time of the virtual machine the Spycrawler is operating in to overcome (or rather reduce the impact of) time bombs. = Web Exploit Finder = WEF is an implementation of an automatic drive-by-download ‚Äì detection in a virtualized environment, developed by Thomas M√ºller, Benjamin Mack and Mehmet Arziman, three students from the Hochschule der Medien (HdM), Stuttgart during the summer term in 2006. WEF can be used as an active HoneyNet with a complete virtualization architecture underneath for rollbacks of compromised virtualized machines.  Low interaction  Low interaction client honeypots differ from high interaction client honeypots in that they do not utilize an entire real system, but rather use lightweight or simulated clients to interact with the server. (in the browser world, they are similar to web crawlers). Responses from servers are examined directly to assess whether an attack has taken place. This could be done, for example, by examining the response for the presence of malicious strings. Low interaction client honeypots are easier to deploy and operate than high interaction client honeypots and also perform better. However, they are likely to have a lower detection rate since attacks have to be known to the client honeypot in order for it to detect them; new attacks are likely to go unnoticed. They also suffer from the problem of evasion by exploits, which may be exacerbated due to their simplicity, thus making it easier for an exploit to detect the presence of the client honeypot. = HoneyC = HoneyC is a low interaction client honeypot developed at Victoria University of Wellington by Christian Seifert in 2006. HoneyC is a platform independent open source framework written in Ruby. It currently concentrates driving a web browser simulator to interact with servers. Malicious servers are detected by statically examining the web server's response for malicious strings through the usage of Snort signatures. = Monkey-Spider (dead since 2008) = Monkey- Spider is a low-interaction client honeypot initially developed at the University of Mannheim by Ali Ikinci. Monkey-Spider is a crawler based client honeypot initially utilizing anti-virus solutions to detect malware. It is claimed to be fast and expandable with other detection mechanisms. The work has started as a diploma thesis and is continued and released as Free Software under the GPL. = PhoneyC (dead since 2015) = PhoneyC is a low-interaction client developed by Jose Nazario. PhoneyC mimics legitimate web browsers and can understand dynamic content by de-obfuscating malicious content for detection. Furthermore, PhoneyC emulates specific vulnerabilities to pinpoint the attack vector. PhoneyC is a modular framework that enables the study of malicious HTTP pages and understands modern vulnerabilities and attacker techniques. = SpyBye = SpyBye is a low interaction client honeypot developed by Niels Provos. SpyBye allows a web master to determine whether a web site is malicious by a set of heuristics and scanning of content against the ClamAV engine. = Thug = Thug is a low-interaction client honeypot developed by Angelo Dell'Aera. Thug emulates the behaviour of a web browser and is focused on detection of malicious web pages. The tool uses Google V8 Javascript engine and implements its own Document Object Model (DOM). The most important and unique features of Thug are: the ActiveX controls handling module (vulnerability module), and static + dynamic analysis capabilities (using Abstract Syntax Tree and Libemu shellcode analyser). Thug is written in Python under GNU General Public License. = YALIH = YALIH (Yet Another Low Interaction Honeyclient) is a low Interaction Client honeypot developed by Masood Mansoori from the honeynet chapter of the Victoria University of Wellington, New Zealand and designed to detect malicious websites through signature and pattern matching techniques. YALIH has the capability to collect suspicious URLs from malicious website databases, Bing API, inbox and SPAM folder through POP3 and IMAP protocol. It can perform Javascript extraction, de-obfuscation and de-minification of scripts embedded within a website and can emulate referrer, browser agents and handle redirection, cookies and sessions. Its visitor agent is capable of fetching a website from multiple locations to bypass geo-location and IP cloaking attacks. YALIH can also generate automated signatures to detect variations of an attack. YALIH is available as an open source project. = miniC = miniC is a low interaction client honeypot based on wget retriever and Yara engine. It is designed to be light, fast and suitable for retrieval of a large number of websites. miniC allows to set and simulate referrer, user-agent, accept_language and few other variables. miniC was designed at New Zealand Honeynet chapter of the Victoria University of Wellington.  Hybrid Client Honeypots  Hybrid client honeypots combine both low and high interaction client honeypots to gain from the advantages of both approaches. = HoneySpider (dead since 2013) = The HoneySpider network is a hybrid client honeypot developed as a joint venture between NASK/CERT Polska, and SURFnet. The projects goal is to develop a complete client honeypot system, based on existing client honeypot solutions and a crawler specially for the bulk processing of URLs.

Playing career James started his career as a left winger with Burnley, making his league debut in November 1970 against Nottingham Forest. In 1971, he won his first international cap against Czechoslovakia. Altogether, he played 54 times for Wales and scored 10 goals. In 1975, he signed for Derby County for a then club record fee of ¬£310,000, and in 1977 joined Queens Park Rangers in exchange for Don Masson. He made his QPR debut against WBA in October 1977 and went on to play 28 league games, scoring 4 goals. In 1978, he returned to play with Burnley but left when they were relegated to the third division and signed for Swansea City, helping them from the third division to the first. He had spells with Sunderland, Bury and Newport County before in 1986 he returned to Burnley for a third spell, as youth team manager and occasional player. He retired from playing in 1989 after being sacked as youth team manager. Managerial career James became a coach at Bradford City before succeeding Gary Simpson as manager of Gainsborough Trinity in October 1993.Tony Williams, Team Talk Magazine, Number 29, pp.72‚Äì73, December 1993. He was the manager at Morecambe but was sacked after only 5 months in charge. In October 1995 he was appointed manager of Southern League Premier Division side Ilkeston Town. After winning his first three matches in charge, the team then went 20 games without a victory and James left the club in February 1996 to be replaced by Keith Alexander. On 29 September 1997, James took over from Tony Greenwood as manager of Accrington Stanley. He spent five months in charge at the Crown Ground before resigning in February 1998 due to other work commitments. James also had two spells in charge of League of Wales club Llanelli, who he saw relegated in 2002‚Äì03. In 2001‚Äì02 he coached Garden Village of the Welsh Football League to the Second Division championship title with a final day victory at Chepstow Town. He currently works as a football pundit for BBC radio and television along with a regular programme on Real Radio. The BBC suspended James for a period due to controversial remarks made in a regular newspaper column regarding Cardiff City. In December 2009, James was appointed manager of Welsh Football League Division One side Aberaman Athletic. He was appointed as Director of Football at Welsh Football League Division One side Haverfordwest County in 2011 but resigned after less than 2 months.Home  Welsh Premier Football  Personal life  James' personal life has not been without controversy. In June 2007, the BBC reported that he was given a driving ban for driving while one and a half times over the legal alcohol limit. He caused further controversy in March 2008 by commenting in his column in the South Wales Evening Post that he would like Cardiff City to lose to Barnsley FC in the FA Cup semi-final 2008.South Wales Evening Post Although the rivalry between the football clubs of Swansea and Cardiff is well documented, James' comments angered someLeighton James in Cardiff FA Cup storm ‚Äì icWales because of his supposed impartiality as a pundit, and also for his staunch attitude that Welsh people should support Welsh teams in whatever sport, an opinion he has discussed at length on radio phone in programmes.

Laid down by the New York Shipbuilding Corporation of Camden, New Jersey, on 11 November 1913, she was launched on 2 March 1913, sponsored by Miss Helen W. Neel, granddaughter of Rear Admiral George W. Melville; and was first commissioned on 3 December 1915, Comdr. Henry Bertram Price in command. Service history =World War I= Assigned to the Atlantic Fleet, Melville reported to Newport, in January 1916. On 11 May 1917, a month after the United States entered World War I, the destroyer tender got underway for Queenstown, Ireland, arriving on the 22nd. She carried out repair and support operations and served as flagship for Vice Admiral William Sims, Commander of U.S. Naval Forces in European waters, from 10 September-4 January 1919. Melville departed Southampton, England, on 7 January 1919 with troops embarked for the east coast, arriving at New York on the 26th. She then operated at Newport and Guantanamo Bay, Cuba until 30 April, when she departed Tompkinsville, N.Y., for the Azores. There she prepared flying boat NC-4 for the final leg of her long transatlantic journey from New York to Europe and embarked crippled NC-3 for return to the east coast, reaching New York on 10 June. =Inter-war period= Reassigned to the Pacific Fleet, the destroyer tender stood out from Hampton Roads, Virginia, on 19 July for the west coast. En route one of her boilers exploded injuring six men, five of them fatally. The collier took her in tow for repairs at Balboa, Panama Canal Zone. On 31 October she arrived at her new home port, San Diego, California, for service along the west coast, alternating with training and fleet exercises in the Caribbean and off Hawaii for the next 21 years. =World War II= With the threat of American involvement in World War II, Melville steamed from the Caribbean for the east coast in November 1940. She arrived at Norfolk on 9 December for operations with the Patrol Force, U.S. Fleet, and was transferred back to the Atlantic Fleet on 1 February 1941. Following intensive training at Guantanamo Bay and Culebra, Puerto Rico, and three weeks of supply duties at Casco Bay, Maine, Melville continued on to Bermuda by 16 September to service neutrality patrol ships until returning to Norfolk on 28 November. Melville got underway on 12 January 1942 for Europe, reaching Derry, Northern Ireland on 31 January to begin tending escort ships of Allied convoys crossing the submarine infested Atlantic. In the next two years, she also based at Hvalfj√∂r√∞ur, Iceland; Recife, Brazil; and Rosneath naval base in Scotland, as well as Newport and Casco Bay, while continuing support services for warships ranging from battleships to landing craft and minesweepers. On 1 May 1944, Melville sailed from Rosneath for Portland, England to begin the massive task of preparing the Allied minesweepers and landing craft for the Normandy Landings of 6 June. For the next year, she was busy maintaining and repairing landing craft for the Allied push toward Germany. The destroyer tender was at Portland when Germany surrendered on 7 May 1945. Melville continued her support duties, now servicing the amphibious craft for final operations in the Pacific theater. On 7 July, Melville steamed for New York arriving the 20th to ready for assignment to the central Pacific. After Japan capitulated on 15 August, she sailed on 1 October for Jacksonville, Florida, where she assisted in the inactivation of escort ships. She got underway from Jacksonville on 13 July 1946 for Norfolk. Melville decommissioned there on 9 August, was struck from the Navy List on 23 April 1947, and was turned over to the Maritime Commission on 30 March 1948. On 19 August 1948 she was sold to Patapsco Scrap Corp., of Baltimore, Maryland, for scrapping.

The common characteristic of LNG Storage tanks is the ability to store LNG at the very low temperature of -162 ¬∞C (-260 ¬∞F). LNG storage tanks have double containers, where the inner contains LNG and the outer container contains insulation materials. The most common tank type is the full containment tank.Diagram of a full containment tank Tanks vary greatly in size, depending on usage. In LNG storage the pressure and temperature within the tank will continue to rise. LNG is a cryogen, and is kept in its liquid state at very low temperatures. The temperature within the tank will remain constant if the pressure is kept constant by allowing the boil off gas to escape from the tank.

Dobbin was launched on 5 May 1921 by the Philadelphia Navy Yard. She was commissioned on 23 July 1924, and served for 22 years before being decommissioned on 27 September 1946, and transferred to the United States Maritime Commission for disposal. Pre-World War II Dobbin (AD-3) was launched on 5 May 1921 at the Philadelphia Navy Yard, sponsored by Mrs. H. H. James, granddaughter of Secretary Dobbin. She was commissioned on 23 July 1924 with Commander D. C. Bingham in command. On 3 January 1925 Dobbin sailed for Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, by way of Newport, Rhode Island, and Hampton Roads, Virginia, where she loaded equipment and supplies for her mission as tender to Destroyer Squadron 14 of the Scouting Fleet. She joined that squadron at Guantanamo Bay, and took part in gunnery practice with the destroyers. From this base, on 13 February 1925, Dobbin steamed to the Panama Canal and crossed to the Pacific Ocean. After maneuvers at sea with the Scouting Fleet she arrived at San Diego on 9 March 1925 for 4 months of tender service along the west coast and at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. Dobbin returned to the east coast in July 1925 and operated in the Atlantic Ocean for the next 7 years. During this time she participated in radio experiments and continued her services to the destroyers of the Scouting Fleet. In 1932, Dobbin returned to San Diego, arriving 1 September, and operated out of that port until 5 October 1939. At that time she was transferred to Hawaii and based on Pearl Harbor. Missing captain In July 1941 Commander Thomas C. Latimore, Dobbins captain, disappeared while hiking the local Aiea Hills. His body was never found and was the subject of much local news coverage and rumor before being overshadowed by the Pearl Harbor attack. Commander Latimore was declared legally dead in July 1942. My father Lt Commander Jess Knight Dodge was serving aboard the Dobbin at this time. He told us that the ship sent crew members to look for Latimore as he like to hike around in the hills. He told us that the body was found with his throat cut wired to a fence with barbed wire, his face had been mutilated to make it appear as a huge ear to ear grin. He told us that the information was not released because of security concerns that it would alert spies that their presence was known. As he was serving aboard during the Pearl Harbor attack, he told us a lot about the events on board the ship and the rescue efforts of the many terribly burned and wounded that they saved. His own ship mates gave underwear. toiletries and clothing to these rescued men because the American Relief Agency there at the time required payment for these items. Since many of the men had been rescued stark naked and had nothing with which to pay the crew members did the humane thing. He would never in the rest of his life give to that agency which still exits today because of this treatment of survivors. Personal family History verbal communications. Anna V. (Dodge) Savelesky, born May 21, 1943 in Sydney, NSW, Australia Attack on Pearl Harbor USS Dobbin (AD-3) and destroyers at Pearl Harbor. Dobbin was present during the attack on Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941. At the time of the attack she was moored northeast of Ford Island with five destroyers, , , , and . Dobbins crew watched as Japanese planes targeted Battleship Row, but as the battleships each took heavy damage the Japanese pilots looked for other targets. Seeing that the ship had admiral flags, the aircraft tried to bomb Dobbin, but the ship only took shrapnel damage. Dobbins small craft spent the morning picking up survivors and taking the wounded to shore. The ship picked up hundreds of sailors from other ships, and when she left the harbor in search of the Japanese fleet, 200 men from alone were aboard. World War II After the attack, Dobbin served in the Hawaiian area until May 1942 and then she was sent to Sydney, Australia. Dobbin was one of several Allied vessels located in Sydney Harbor during the Japanese midget submarine attack of 31 May 1942. On 25 June 1943 she was sent to Brisbane, Mackay, Townsville, and Cleveland Bay, Australia, before arriving at Milne Bay, New Guinea, 30 September 1943.

Martin Croker, Bruce Campbell, Neil Peart and Chris Kattan. The film was theatrically released on April 13, 2007.

Warner Home Video released the film on a two-disc DVD on August 14, 2007.  Plot  Beginning in Egypt in a purposely indeterminable time, Master Shake, Frylock, and Meatwad break free from the Sphinx and are attacked by an oversized poodle who kills Frylock before Shake defeats it. Shake and Meatwad flee with Frylock's corpse and meet \\"Time Lincoln\\", who revives Frylock. When government agents break into his house, Time Lincoln helps the Aqua Teens escape in a wooden rocket ship. Time Lincoln is shot, changing the timeline and resulting in the Confederacy winning the American Civil War and the government agents being made slaves to a Black Kentucky Colonel. All this, however, is an elaborate story concocted by Shake to explain their origin to Meatwad. Meanwhile, a slice of watermelon named Walter Melon observes events of the Aqua Teens from his spaceship. When Shake plans to use his new exercise machine, Frylock notices that it is not assembled properly, and the instructions cannot be found. After searching for them online, he finds a message warning not to assemble the machine. Frylock calls the website's listed phone number, which is revealed to be that of Emory and Oglethorpe, the Plutonians. Before answering the phone, they discover the Cybernetic Ghost of Christmas Past from the Future on board with them. The Ghost explains to the two aliens that the machine, when assembled, will exercise a man into a super- being, who will attract all the women on Earth, leading to massive inbreeding and the eventual extinction of mankind. To prevent this, the Ghost travels to the past and steals a screw that holds the machine together. The Plutonians point out to him that the screw could easily be replaced. Back on Earth, Frylock finishes re-building the machine with a pencil in the screw hole, but he discovers the circuit board is missing. The trio visit Carl, from whom Shake had stolen the machine, to see if he has the missing piece. After Carl refuses to tell them, Meatwad finds the address in the machine's box. Dr. Weird is visited by Shake, Frylock, and Meatwad. Frylock retrieves the missing circuit board and installs it into the machine. Carl insists that as the rightful owner he should be the first to test the machine. The machine straps him in and transforms itself into a giant one-eyed robot. The robot plays techno music and heads for downtown Philadelphia, all while Carl is forced to exercise. Eventually, the robot begins laying metallic eggs, which hatch into smaller versions of the machine. The Aqua Teens, aided by an instructional workout video, find that the machine can be destroyed using music. The Aqua Teens have no choice but to have Shake play his music. Shake poorly plays his original song \\"Nude Love\\" on acoustic guitar, forcing the machine to commit suicide. Carl (now bulging with muscles) leaves with his newly found date, a bodybuilder named Linda, and they head back to her condo while the Aqua Teens try to figure out a way to stop the newly hatched machines from destroying the city. As they travel back to Dr. Weird, Frylock begins to tell the origin story of the Aqua Teens: they were created by Dr. Weird, along with a chicken nugget named Chicken Bittle. In the flashback, Dr. Weird proclaims that the Aqua Teens were created for one purpose: to crash a jet into a brick wall. Realizing the pointlessness of this mission, Frylock diverted the jet and set a course to Africa, where they would try to solve world hunger. Upon entering Africa, Bittle was eaten by a lion. After realizing they could not be much help, they returned to America and rented a house in New Jersey. Meanwhile, Carl and Linda recline in her room, where she reveals herself to be Dr. Weird in disguise. He cuts off Carl's muscles and grafts them onto his own body. Frylock and Dr. Weird do battle while they argue back and forth about who created whom. Dr. Weird claims that it was Frylock who created him, not the other way around. Dr. Weird shows Frylock a teddy bear filled with razor blades. Shake tries to take the teddy bear, but he loses his hand. Dr. Weird then reveals that the blue diamond on Frylock's back hides a VCR, in which a videotape with false memories of Dr. Weird creating Frylock had been playing in Frylock's head. Just then, Walter Melon arrives in his ship. Meatwad mentions he saw the ship earlier. Shake calls him a liar and shoots him with a shotgun. Shake gets concerned when Meatwad does not reform like always. Walter tells Neil to play the \\"Drum Solo Of Life\\" to bring Meatwad back to life. Meanwhile, Shake tries to pick up the teddy bear for the second time, losing his other hand. Melon explains he created the Aqua Teens and all the other characters, including the machine. His plan was that they would kill each other and Walter would inherit their real estate in order to create the \\"Insano-Gym\\". The others inform Walter that they rent and do not own property, proving Walter's plan pointless. Walter storms off. The Teens see their alleged mother standing before them, revealed to be a burrito. Shake suddenly jumps out the window upon hearing this news, Meatwad hugs her, and Frylock states, \\"That's neat\\".

More details were revealed at the 2005 Paley Television Festival, such as a possible cameo by 80s funk group Cameo, and Maiellaro described it as \\"an action piece that leads into an origin story that unfolds in a very 'Aqua Teen' way.\\" The creators revealed much more information in an interview with Wizard Entertainment. While they dodged many questions, they confirmed that the film would run 80 minutes, produced on a meager $750,000 budget, and features a plot detail about a \\"lost Aqua Teen\\", who is a large chicken nugget named \\"Chicken Bittle\\" (voiced by Bruce Campbell). They also confirmed more cameos, with Rush drummer and lyricist Neil Peart, voice actor H. Jon Benjamin and his comedy partner Jon Glaser, and Saturday Night Lives Fred Armisen to make appearances. Heavy metal band Mastodon stated in a Decibel article that they would be performing during the opening, and that the band would be animated as a bucket of popcorn, a soda, a hot dog, and a candy bar. They were actually animated as a pretzel, a pile of nachos, an \\"Icecaps\\" box, and a gumdrop. = Rating = R for \\"Crude and sexual humor, violent images, and language\\" by the MPAA. Regarding the film's rating, Maiellaro commented that \\"I think if [the movie is rated] R, it won't get the audience that watches it. But we don't know yet. We're still waiting to find out.\\" Following this, the released trailer advertised the film as rated R. The film is mostly uncensored; when censoring does occur, it is occasionally accompanied by a censoring beep that does not obscure the word. Censoring also occurs once during a flashback. As explained in the production feature, the inconsistency was an editing mistake, but left untouched for comic effect.  Soundtrack  The soundtrack was released on April 10, 2007, under the title Aqua Teen Hunger Force Colon Movie Film for Theaters Colon the Soundtrack. It features many previously unreleased songs, some recorded for the purpose of this album. In addition, the compilation features an intro/outro titled \\"Nude Love\\" by Aqua Teen character Master Shake, a track from former SPIN.com Artist of the Day MC Chris, skits and sound bites from the movie, and a new version of the Aqua Teen Hunger Force theme by rapper Schoolly D. The album features mix of musical styles ranging from heavy metal, indie rock, and hip-hop; and also features new, original music from Mastodon, Killer Mike and Unearth. Noticeably missing is \\"In the Air Tonight\\" by Phil Collins, which is prominently featured at the end of the film. # Master Shake ‚Äì \\"Nude Love\\" ‚Äì 1:27 # Soda Dog Refreshment Squad ‚Äì \\"Groovy Time for a Movie Time\\" ‚Äì 0:48 # Mastodon ‚Äì \\"Cut You Up With a Linoleum Knife\\" ‚Äì 1:50 # Early Man ‚Äì \\"More to Me Than Meat and Eyes\\" ‚Äì 3:11 # Schoolly D ‚Äì \\"Aqua Teen Hunger Force Theme\\" (Remix) ‚Äì 1:34 # Meatwad ‚Äì Skit ‚Äì 0:18 # Unearth ‚Äì \\"The Chosen\\" ‚Äì 3:50 # Andrew W.K. ‚Äì \\"Party Party Party\\" ‚Äì 1:56 # Carl Brutananadilewski ‚Äì Skit ‚Äì 0:15 # Nine Pound Hammer ‚Äì \\"Carl's Theme\\" ‚Äì 2:42 # Brass Castle ‚Äì \\"Bookworm Resin\\" ‚Äì 3:34 # Master Shake ‚Äì Skit ‚Äì 0:22 # Killer Mike ‚Äì \\"Blam Blam\\" ‚Äì 6:12 # Insane-O-Flex ‚Äì \\"I Like Your Booty (But I'm Not Gay)\\" ‚Äì 2:04 # mc chris ‚Äì \\"I Want Candy\\" ‚Äì 2:03 # The Hold Steady ‚Äì \\"Girls Like Status\\" ‚Äì 2:43 # Master Shake ‚Äì \\"Nude Love (Reprise)\\" ‚Äì 9:28 #* features hidden tracks #** Meatwad and Superchunk ‚Äì \\"Misfits and Mistakes\\" #** Master Shake and Nashville Pussy ‚Äì \\"Face Omelet\\" #** Carl Brutananadilewski ‚Äì Skit #** Matt Maiellaro ‚Äì Guitar Solo Note: Carey Means (Frylock) is absent from the skits, sound bites, and hidden tracks where the other Aqua Teens can be heard. Regardless, Carey Means still portrays Frylock in the film.  Marketing  The film's poster was illustrated by Julie Bell and Boris Vallejo, and parodies the \\"King of the Mountain\\" design. = Boston Mooninite panic = On January 31, 2007, police in Boston, Massachusetts received reports of devices resembling bombs in various places around the city. The devices turned out to be electronic signs similar to a Lite-Brite that displayed images of the Mooninites Ignignokt and Err giving the finger, and were designed to promote the Aqua Teen Hunger Force television show as part of a guerrilla marketing campaign authorized by Cartoon Network, the cartoon's parent company. The boards were present in several cities for weeks before the ones in Boston were reported. The Boston City Government sought a reimbursement for the money spent responding to the incident. The amount quoted was $500,000 initially, and then was increased to $750,000. On February 5, it was announced that Turner Broadcasting and the city of Boston have reached an agreement to pay $2 million to offset the cost of removing the devices: $1 million to cover the cost of the agencies involved and an additional $1 million in goodwill funding to homeland security. An episode from season five, entitled \\"Boston\\", was produced as the series creators' response to the scare, but Adult Swim pulled it to avoid further controversy surrounding the events of the bomb scare. = April Fools' Day television \\"premiere\\" = The heavily promoted April 1, 2007 airing of the movie on Adult Swim muted and featured in a small picture-in-picture screen in the bottom left hand corner during a simultaneous airing of the Family Guy episode \\"Peter's Two Dads\\", while a large and noisy on-screen graphic of Master Shake promotes the movie's airing. Adult Swim began running advertisements on March 25, 2007, advertising the television premiere of the movie the following Sunday, April 1, 2007. Its only reasoning behind this stunt, as stated in the advertisement, was, \\"because we're fucking crazy\\". While Adult Swim's TV listings on its website stated the movie would be shown, other TV listings reported the same Sunday block. The stunt was, in actuality, yet another one of Adult Swim's annual April Fools' pranks: though the first few minutes of the movie were shown normally, the remainder was shown in a small picture-in-picture box in the bottom left-hand corner, with no sound, over the normal programming and occasional giant pop-ups alerting viewers of its presence, as well as advertising the actual premiere. The advertising was shown again on one episode of the Family Guy marathon on July 6, 2007. The movie eventually was shown on Sunday, March 30, 2008. The day after the April Fools' joke, Cartoon Network showed another bumper, stating: \\"Sorry you will still have to pay to actually see the movie. But thanks for the ratings!\\" = Fake endings = In yet another promotional stunt, the \\"ending\\" to the movie was posted in various places including YouTube, KingColon.com (in the Worst Game Ever game), and fansite \\"Aqua Teen Central\\": each ending was completely different. Eventually, the Adult Swim website let it be known that none of the \\"endings\\" were real and presented seven more clips (which were fake as well) throughout the weeks following the film's release. These endings, now called the \\"fake.com endings\\", are available on the film's \\"Extras\\" DVD on the 2-Disc Collector's Edition. These endings are parodies of other films. For example, one of the endings spoofs The Terminator, featuring Meatwad as \\"The Determinator\\".  Release  = Home media = Warner Home Video released Aqua Teen Hunger Force Colon Movie Film for Theaters in a two-disc DVD edition on August 14, 2007. For the DVD release, the studio changed the title of the eighty-seven-minute full-length movie to Aqua Teen Hunger Force Colon Movie Film for Theaters for DVD, just like the film soundtrack's title. The DVD features include the ten fake endings as shown on the internet, a \\"making of\\" featurette, promos, the \\"Deleted Scenes\\" episode, a music video, and an eighty-minute animatic (rough cut) of the movie made out of the deleted scenes from the film and scenes from the \\"Deleted Scenes\\" episode as well as a commentary. Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductee Patti Smith is featured on the DVD commentary. The scene after the credits was removed from the UK DVD release. The set also features the season four episode \\"Deleted Scenes\\" (also known as \\"Star-Studded Xmas Spectacular\\"), which makes heavy references and parallels to the film that originally aired years prior to the film's release on December 18, 2005. The film is also available in HD and SD on the Xbox Live Marketplace.Aqua Teen Hunger Force Colon Movie Film for Theaters at Xbox Live Marketplace.  Reception  = Box office = The film was a box office success, making $5,520,368 domestically against its $750,000 budget. = Critical response = With 28 reviews compiled, Metacritic reported that Movie Film for Theaters has received an average rating of 54/100, indicating \\"mixed or average reviews\\".Aqua Teen Hunger Force Colon Movie Film for Theaters on Metacritic Rotten Tomatoes gave the film an approval rating of 48% based on reviews from 85 critics, with an average rating of 5.1/10. The website's consensus states: \\"The non sequitur humor of Aqua Teen Hunger Force will surely appeal to its built-in fanbase, but for the uninitiated, the premise wears thin\\". Reviews ranged from Glenn Kenny at Premiere magazine, who stated that he was tempted to refer to the film as \\"the most successful full-on surrealist film since Bu√±uel and Dal√≠'s 1930 L'√Çge d'Or\\", to Ty Burr of The Boston Globe, who called it \\"an act of terrorism against entertainment\\". The film was given a thumbs down on the television show At the Movies with Ebert & Roeper; Richard Roeper criticized the film's run time and calling it \\"unfunny\\", though he said the first five minutes of the film were funny. In response to such reviews, a commercial featuring the Mooninites began airing during the Adult Swim block. The two characters spend the entire commercial insulting a supposedly typical reviewer, \\"Lionel\\" of lionellovesmovies.com (the site merely leads back to the movie page). Other commercials recommend people see the film two or three more times to push the box office numbers up. Adult Swim also mentioned in one of its commercial bumpers that the review situation highlights the generation gap, and that most negative reviews came from much older critics.  Cancelled sequel  There has been mention of producing a sequel entitled Death Fighter. While little has been confirmed by Adult Swim in regards to the film, there have been many statements regarding it. On December 15, 2008, Dave Willis stated no script was written and that the film would be released in Spring 2009 (though, as he also stated that Death Fighter was a T-shirt he was working on, he likely wasn't being serious) Following this, in an April 2009 interview, Dave joked about the film lacking any sort of funding and being sold out of the back of his car. In a 2010 interview, staff members of Radical Axis confirmed that a sequel was indeed in production, and mentioned the possibility that the film might be made in 3D. When asked if the film was designed for a theatrical release, a Radical Axis staff member responded yes, but stated: \\"We're not sure if we have a distributor yet.\\" This was then followed by the statement: \\"Adult Swim will never make another movie ever again.\\" In 2012, Matt Maiellaro released more news regarding the film, that being: \\"It is all written and great. We are just trying to convince the network do it again. The first one was such a cash cow for them, not just box office but also ad sales in the movie. So it is kind of a no-brainer. So hopefully one day.\\" By 2014, the script had been completed and approved and would be released somewhere in mid 2015 and jokingly stated that the film was shelved as it was not G-rated; however, on April 25, 2015, at a C2CE convention panel, Willis indirectly stated that the project was scrapped, soon after announcing the show's cancellation.Dave Willis speaking at a C2CE convention panel on April 25, 2015 posted on Twitch He later mentioned on Reddit that it would cost $3.4 million to produce, and expressed interest in doing a Kickstarter to fund it. He also reportedly stated that the film could potentially be released in the next 2 years.Statement made by Dave Willis on June 16, 2015 on Reddit  See also  * List of adult animated films * South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut * Beavis and Butt-Head Do America * The Simpsons Movie  References   External links   * Category:2007 films Category:2007 animated films Category:2000s American animated films Category:2000s monster movies Category:Adult animated films Category:American films Category:American flash animated films Category:American computer- animated films Category:American black comedy films Category:English-language films Category:Aqua Teen Hunger Force Category:American monster movies Category:Giant monster films Category:Adult Swim films Category:Animated comedy films Category:Animated films based on animated series Category:Fictional depictions of Abraham Lincoln in film Category:Films based on television series Category:Films set in Egypt Category:Films set in New Jersey Category:Surreal comedy Category:Films about trans women Category:2007 black comedy films Category:2007 comedy films Category:Films about food and drink ","title":"Aqua Teen Hunger Force Colon Movie Film for Theaters"},{"id":"6697519","text":"Bigfoot trap - February 2007 What is believed to be the world's only Bigfoot trap is located in the Siskiyou National Forest in the southern part of Jackson County, Oregon, a few miles from the California state border. It was designed to capture a Bigfoot (or Sasquatch), the legendary hominid that is said to live in the forests of the Pacific Northwest. Description The trap is a wooden box made of 2x12 planks bound together by heavy metal bands and secured to the ground by telephone poles. A Forest Service special use permit was issued for its construction, but the door has been bolted open since 1980. Its location was originally remote and predicted to be a good place for a Bigfoot migration, but since the construction of the Applegate Dam, a road is now near the trap. History The trap was built in 1974 by the North American Wildlife Research Team (NAWRT), a now-defunct organization based in Eugene, Oregon, that was inspired to build a trap at the location by Perry Lovell, a miner who lived near the Applegate River, who claimed to have found 18-inch-long human-like tracks in his garden. NAWRT operated the trap, keeping it baited with carcasses for six years, but caught only bears. Since then the trap had been abandoned and started to deteriorate. In 2006 the United States Forest Service, under the Passport in Time program, began to repair the trap. The trap has become a tourist attraction over the past 30 years and hundreds of people visit it annually. At least one film has been shot on site. The Forest Service keeps an eye on the device, but otherwise does not maintain it. The Collings Mountain hiking trail passes by the Bigfoot trap.

He took part in excavations at the 'Placerias Quarry', in 1930 and the forty Shonisaurus skeleton discoveries of the 1960s, in what is now the Berlin-Ichthyosaur State Park. Camp served as the third director of the University of California Museum of Paleontology from 1930 to 1949, and coincidentally as chair of the UC Berkeley Paleontology Department between 1939 and 1949. Camp named a number of species of marine reptiles such as Shonisaurus and Plotosaurus, as well as the dinosaur Segisaurus. Camp was also an important bibliographer and historian of Western America. This aspect of his career is represented most notably by two works. The first is his biography of American pioneer James Clyman, which Bernard De Voto called \\"one of the half-dozen classics in the field.\\" The second work was the third edition of The Plains and the Rockies, published in 1953, which Camp annotated heavily. He was the 1970 recipient of the California Historical Society's Henry Raup Wagner Memorial Award.

The bird appears \\"displayed proper\\" with its wings outstretched and curved upwards. Although the image of the piping shrike is readily identified with South Australia, the bird in its own right has never been formally adopted as a faunal or bird emblem of the state. The term piping shrike for this species of Australian magpie is correct, yet uncommon. The term piping shrike is commonly mistaken to refer to the magpie-lark, which is incorrect.  Origins The piping shrike first appeared on the Governor's ensign in 1903, and was also on the State Badge which was proclaimed in 1904. The original reports credited it to H. P. Gill who was the director of the School of Arts, with some input and critique from the Governor General Hallam Tennyson, 2nd Baron Tennyson. The nephew of Robert Craig of the School of Arts claims that he was solely responsible for the original design. A similar argument is made by the relatives of the Adelaide artist Frances Jane Warhurst who claim that she based it on the eagle on the seal of the Prussian consul, a close friend of hers. There are also reports of a later version also credited to Gill in 1910. The badge design, which set the bird against a backdrop of the yellow risen sun of Australian Federation, was incorporated into the state flag (1904) and the Coat of Arms (1984). Identification of the bird Because the name piping shrike is not used to identify any bird, there has been some confusion over what bird it represents. While some think it resembles the magpie-lark (Grallina cyanoleuca), the original reports specify that it is based on the Australian magpie, and government sources specify the subspecies as the white-backed magpie (Gymnorhina tibicen leuconota). The connection of this bird to the name piping shrike can be seen in this early observation by explorer Charles Sturt in the 1840s: :\\"GYMNORHINA LEUCONOTA GOULD., The White-backed Crow Shrike. This bird is somewhat larger than, and very much resembles a magpie, but the proportion of white is greater, and there is no metallic or varied tint on the black feathers as on the European bird. In South Australia it is a winter bird, and his clear fine note was always the most heard on the coldest morning, as if that temperature best suited him. All the species of this genus are easily domesticated, and learn to pipe tunes. They are mischievous birds about a house, but are useful in a garden. I had one that ranged the fields to a great distance round the house, but always returned to sleep in it.\\" External links *State badge of South Australia *Government of South Australia: Use of the Piping Shrike (pdf) *Narrative of an expedition into Central Australia by Charles Sturt: Birds *http://birdlife.org.au/bird-profile/Magpie-lark Bird Life Australia Magpie Lark *http://www.abc.net.au/reslib/200908/r427423_2038331.pdf ABC Operation Magpie Fact Sheet 4 References Category:Emblems of South Australia Category:Passeriformes .

At the age of 15, she made her first stage appearance at the Taghiyev Theatre in Baku, performing a piece from Uzeyir Hajibeyov's Husband and Wife. In 1915, she got admitted to a post-secondary program at the Kiev Conservatory, where she met Reinhold Gli√®re, a Russian composer.

Later in 1934, he would compose his famous Shakh-Senem based on his impressions and experiences from this trip, and dedicate it to Mammadova. By that time, she would already be widely known as a talented opera singer.

Career =Early releases= Wolverine started out playing death-metal with melodic influences, but when they released their first EP, Fervent Dream, in November 1999, the music had evolved into progressive metal. Fervent Dream got an overwhelming reception all over the world and was soon sold out. The band also played outside Sweden for the first time in connection with the release of the album. The beginning of 2001 saw Fervent Dream re-released as a digi-pack, re-mastered, and with two bonus tracks. During the summer of that same year, the band traveled to Germany and recorded the follow-up to Fervent Dream ‚Äì The Window Purpose. The Window Purpose was released in December and the response was once again overwhelming; the album saw the band gain the accolade of Album of the Month during January 2002 from the Netherlands' metal magazine Aardschok. Once again Wolverine played around Europe to promote the album. =Elitist Records recordings= In 2003 the moody album Cold Light of Monday was released through Elitist Records. The album explored the really dark side of the band. The album scored really high notes in many of the biggest metal magazines, such as Kerrang and Metal Hammer. During 2003, Wolverine also opened up for Anathema in London. The band re-released The Window Purpose in the beginning of 2005, re-mastered and with renewed artwork as well as a new recording of an old track from Fervent Dream. Later that same year, Wolverine played the European edition of the ProgPower festival for the third time in their career. The band co-headlined the festival's second day together with Pain of Salvation. =Joins Candlelight= After splitting with Elitist/Earache Records in 2005, the band found a new home in Candlelight Records and the time has now come to release Still, Wolverine's fourth studio album. Recorded at the Spacelab Studio, Germany during the summer of 2005, the album holds nine tracks featuring Wolverine's unique sound. The music is probably best described as a mixture between The Window Purpose and Cold Light of Monday, powerful and filled with moods and nuances. =Communication Lost= The recording of the album took place on various locations around Sweden during the first half of 2010, and it was mixed by Jacob Hansen at Hansen Studios in Denmark. The album was mastered by Eroc and released on May 23, 2011. According to Marcus Losbjer, the songs on the album are more musically complex than before. To help create the desired atmosphere, electronic elements and effects were also utilised. He also states he feels it is the natural evolution and continuation from Still. Vocalist Stefan Zell has also noted that Communication Lost is the band's best production.  Current members  * Stefan Zell - clean vocals * Jonas Jonsson - electric guitar * Thomas Jansson - bass guitar * Marcus Losbjer - drums and death vocals * Per Henriksson - keyboard Stefan Zell also performed bass on Wolverine's first two albums. =Former members= * Mikael Zell - electric guitar * C-H Landegren - electric guitar and backing vocals * Per Broddesson - electric guitar * Andreas Baglien - keyboards  Albums  * 1999: Fervent Dream (EP)(re-issued in 2001) * 2001: The Window Purpose (re-released in 2005) * 2003: Cold Light of Monday * 2006: Still * 2011: Communication Lost * 2016: Machina Viva References  External links  *Official website *Wolverine on Myspace *Interview with Deathmetalbaboon.com Category:Musical groups established in 1995 Category:Swedish progressive metal musical groups Category:Earache Records artists ","title":"Wolverine (band)"},{"id":"6697677","text":"The Swatow Operation (June 21‚Äì27, 1939) was part of a campaign by Japan during the Second Sino-Japanese War to blockade China in order to prevent it from communicating with the outside world and importing needed arms and materials.

Order of battle Swatow Operation  Part of Goto Detachment and a part of Sasebo 9th SNLF landed on the east coast on June 21 near the airfield east Swatow. Other Japanese troops in more than ten motor boats proceeded up the Han river and landed at Mei-hsi (near modern Anbu) cutting the road between Swatow north to Chao-chow. A coordinated attack by the Japanese drove the Chinese defenders, Hua Chen-chung's brigade and local militia units, from the city of Swatow. They fell back to the Yenfu‚ÄìMeihsi line on June 23. The Japanese also had landed at Jiao Yu, the island south of Swatow, on June 22. They occupied the whole island by June 24. The Chinese fell back to Fuyang on the 24th to block the approaches to Chaochow as the Japanese landed reinforcements. Proceeding north in pursuit the Japanese also sent forces up the river and landed in the Chinese rear, part of the Chinese force then fell back into the city while the remainder moved into the mountains northwest of the city. The Japanese advancing from the west captured Chaochow by June 27 after heavy street fighting. Later the Chinese sent reinforcements of the 5th Reserve Division, and 1st Advance Column to block the Japanese from further advances and conduct guerrilla warfare on their positions and lines of communications.

In 1989, he set an ACC record for receiving yards by a tight end in a single season, with 634. Early years McGonnigal played high school football at Loyola High School where he helped the Dons end a long losing streak to archrival Calvert Hall in the annual Turkey Bowl game his senior year. MCGonnigal graduated in 1986. College career McGonnigal has become an integral part of football folklore at the University of Virginia, where many fans tell varying accounts of how McGonnigal was injured while searching for his girlfriend's dog, some time prior to the game against Georgia Tech in 1990. McGonnigal ruptured his spleen and received a concussion from the fall incurred during the nighttime search. The spleen injury sidelined him for the rest of the 1990 season. At the time of the accident, the Virginia Cavaliers football team was ranked #1 in both major polls. Without McGonnigal, the Cavaliers fell to eventual NCAA champion Georgia Tech, 41-38. Late in the game, with the Cavaliers trailing 38-35, quarterback Shawn Moore threw what would've been a go-ahead touchdown pass to new starting tight end Aaron Mundy; however, the play was overturned because a back-up tight end had not come onto the field causing there a penalty for too few players on the line of scrimmage. Coach George Welsh then elected to kick a tying field goal, but the Yellow Jackets then drove for the winning field goal. Many University of Virginia football fans speculate that had McGonnigal never been injured, the Virginia Cavaliers might have gone on to win at least a share of the NCAA national championship. Professional career McGonnigal was drafted in 1991 by the Pittsburgh Steelers in the 9th round, but ended up with the Cleveland Browns, where he saw little playing time and closed out his brief NFL career. After football McGonnigal took up a career in political campaign management after leaving the NFL.

OutNow had been published since 1992 from its headquarters in San Jose, California in the Silicon Valley. Every month the magazine had a different content focus such as health, relationships, home improvements, weekend getaways, Pride, sports, arts and entertainment, business and more. OutNow also features interviews with politicians, business leaders and actors. OutNow had a high non-gay readership for a gay publication since it also reported on culture, business, politics and housing topics that are ignored by other local press. The publisher estimated that two-thirds of the publication's events were not LGBT-specific so anyone could find the listings useful. Since the magazine had stories about local theater, events, politics, housing and culture, it also attracts non- LGBT readers. In online surveys conducted by the magazine, 23 percent of the readers identify as heterosexual. An electronic version of the magazine was offered on its website, along with daily news updates, blogs, feature stories on health, travel, sports and more. The calendar is the most popular section on the website, along with a business directory. As of 2004 over 5,000 copies of the online version were downloaded each month. OutNow sponsored many community events, such as singles night at a downtown restaurant and bar, receptions at local theater performances and after work professional networking events at Silicon Valley companies. And the magazine partners with organizations such as the Silicon Valley Gay Men‚Äôs Chorus and San Jose Pride to help promote the event and magazine. The annual San Jose Pride guide was printed as part of the June edition. In 2006 they made news by refusing to print a letter from then-governor Arnold Schwarzenegger for his vetoing a progay marriage bill in 2005. Many LGBT publications dropped the letter. With more than 300 distribution sites, thousands of subscriptions and the online magazine there were an estimated 30,000 or more readers in the region that includes Silicon Valley/San Jose, San Francisco, Oakland and Santa Cruz areas. In 2009 OutNow's subscription list was incorporated into a plotline of an LGBT thriller novel Gaph 2: The Reader by author B. Alan Bourgeois. History The publication was founded as OutNow! in 1992 in a newspaper format. The newspaper stopped publishing due to debt in 1997. The business went through bankruptcy when publisher Mark Gillard stepped in July 1998 printing the first issue under his leadership in October 1998. Gillard changed the name removing the exclamation mark believing that the coming out process should be treated as a personal issue and not dictated by outside forces. He also converted the product to a slick magazine and started incorporating his marketing experience into promoting the LGBT business community. In 1998 OutNow started using its annual anniversary dinner to salute prominent people who support the LGBT community. In 2004 the publication awarded former Billy DeFrank LGBT Community Center interim Executive Director Clark Williams, a politician serving as city councilor, and supervisor its 2004 Community Leadership Award. They also honored San Jose Mayor Ron Gonzales with the 2004 Best Friend of the LGBT Community award. In 2005 the publication was criticized by a Catholic reporter for having advertisements for bathhouses and pornographic videos, the publication was available at a national conference, National Association of Catholic Diocesan Lesbian and Gay Ministries, that met in San Jose. In 2008 the publication ran into a form of discrimination when a non-gay-owned business refused to let the free publication be placed in their cafe. The incident was reported by the publisher in an editorial for the June Pride issue. It was picked up by the San Francisco-based Bay Area Reporter as part of a story of similar incidents faced by other LGBT publications. The magazine also relocated offices into the Billy DeFrank LGBT Community Center, also in San Jose. In 2009 the economic climate led to ad cancellations and subsequent reduced pages of the magazine. OutNow reported that due to the state of California's budget woes they had lost major advertisers such as Santa Clara County's HIV prevention campaign, and the city of San Jose's ads aimed to getting gay people to move downtown. Another major advertiser American Musical Theater of San Jose went bankrupt owing thousands for previous ads. The publication lowered rates and used fewer freelancers. They also reduced the page count from 48 pages to 40. In 2009 the publication also retooled how it uses its sources online. Previously issues could be downloaded but they added news stories and articles as stand alone pages that can be linked by other web sites.

The light stands on the southern side of the entrance to Charleston Harbor, north of the City of Folly Beach. The lighthouse was named to the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. Although the lighthouse now stands several hundred feet offshore, it was originally inside a much larger island. When constructed in 1876, the light was approximately from the water's edge. However, the construction in 1889 of the jetties which protect the shipping lanes leading to Charleston Harbor altered ocean currents, resulting in the rapid erosion of Morris Island and the destruction of many structures and historical sites (such as Fort Wagner). By 1938 the shoreline had reached the lighthouse, forcing its automation as it was no longer safe or practical to keep it manned. In 1962 the Morris Island Light was decommissioned and replaced by the new Charleston Light, located on Sullivan's Island at the north end of the harbor. History The Morris Island Light, located on Morris Island, at the entrance to the harbor of Charleston, SC, was one of the colonial lights turned over to the Federal Government under the terms of the act of August 7, 1789. The light was in a brick tower, built by the Colony of South Carolina in 1767. On May 7, 1800, Congress appropriated $5,000 for repairing the lighthouse. In 1838 the light was described as a revolving light, the tower being from the base to the lantern. A new first-order lens was installed in the tower on January 1, 1858. Charleston Light Station, 1914 On December 20, 1860, on receiving reports from the lighthouse inspector at Charleston regarding the probable seizure of the lighthouse property by the Confederacy, the Secretary of the Lighthouse Board wrote the Secretary of the Treasury that he would not recommend \\"that the coast of South Carolina be lighted by the Federal Government against her will.\\" Ten days later the inspector at Charleston informed the Board that \\"the Governor of the State of South Carolina has requested me to leave the State. I am informed that forcible possession has been taken of the lights, buoys, etc., of this harbor, and that similar measures will be adopted in regard to all lights in the State.\\" Early in January 1861, the Rattlesnake Shoal Lightship was towed into Charleston and the lighthouse tenders were seized. By the latter part of April 1861, practically all lights were extinguished, lightships removed, and other aids removed or destroyed from the Chesapeake to the Rio Grande, with the exception of some of the lights on the Florida coast and reefs. In 1862 the Lighthouse Board reported \\"Charleston, lens and lantern destroyed.\\" In all, 164 lights were forcibly discontinued during the Civil War on the southern coasts. These were relighted from time to time, and by 1866, the greater part had been restored. The Charleston Channel was re-marked promptly on the occupation of the city by Union troops in February 1865. In 1865 the Lighthouse Board reported \\"that an almost total change had taken place, leaving no channel in the harbor as it was in 1860, and opening new ones. Under this altered state of things it became necessary to establish lights temporarily at such places as would be useful guides through existing channels and omit all other. On March 3, 1873, Congress made the first of three appropriations for a new lighthouse on Morris Island. $60,000 was granted on that date for \\"commencing the rebuilding of a first-order seacoast light on Morris Island destroyed during the war.\\" Two other appropriations totaling $90,000 in 1874 and 1875 were for completing the work. The new structure was to be at or near the same spot as the old tower, high and built of brick, with a first-order flashing light. Foundation piles were driven and the space between them filled with concrete thick. The new tower, when completed in 1876, was in height and the cost was $149,993.50. A first-order Fresnel lens was installed. In 1884 the illuminating apparatus was changed for the use of mineral oil instead of lard oil. The cyclone of August 25, 1885, destroyed the rear beacon of the Morris Island range, overturned part of the brick wall which enclosed the tower and dwelling of the main light, carried away the bridge between the beacons, and destroyed a large part of the plank walks connecting the several lights and dwellings, and overturned the boathouse. The range was reestablished 3 days later by a temporary beacon. A new wooden skeleton structure high was built in 1885. The 1886 Charleston earthquake threw the lens of the main light out of position and cracked the tower extensively in two places, but not so as to endanger its stability. The lens was replaced and the cracks repaired without delay. Erosion of land caused the Coast Guard to begin construction of a new Charleston Light in 1960. The new light was commissioned on June 15, 1962. The tower stands high on the north side of Charleston Harbor entrance on Sullivan's Island. = Decommissioned = Since being decommissioned, hurricanes have destroyed portions of the complex. In 1989, Hurricane Hugo struck Charleston, destroying the remaining buildings around the lighthouse, only leaving the actual tower standing. The dock remained until Hurricane Irma struck in 2017.  Save the Light, Inc.  In 1999 Save The Light, Inc. purchased the historic lighthouse for $75,000 in order to preserve it. In 2000, the lighthouse was transferred to the State of South Carolina through the Department of Natural Resources. The lighthouse was leased to Save The Light, Inc. for 99 years to coordinate the stabilization, erosion control, restoration and to raise the necessary funds for that work. Starting in 2007, Save The Light, Inc. has periodically lit up the lighthouse. = Restoration efforts = In August, 2010, a project was completed that stabilized the lighthouse by placing a ring of concrete around it at a cost of $734,313 (USD). In addition, 68 micropiles were placed through the existing foundation. After Hurricane Irma, efforts focused on repairing the dock which was repaired in 2019. Additionally, a study was done to determine the stability of one of the light house's stairs. Restoration costs are estimated to be $7 million.

As a player, he notably played in the Premier League for Arsenal, where he was understudy to David Seaman throughout the majority of his time at Highbury. He also played in the Football League for Wolverhampton Wanderers, Blackpool, Cheltenham Town, West Bromwich Albion, Bournemouth, Huddersfield Town and Gillingham. He is currently the development goalkeeping coach at Premier League side Southampton. Playing career Born in Birmingham, Bartram attended Hagley RC High School. His first professional club was Wolverhampton Wanderers who in 1985 signed him from a non-league team. Bartram made his first team debut on 23 August 1986 in a 2‚Äì1 home defeat to Cambridge United, which marked the club's first-ever game in the fourth tier of English football. However, this proved his only Wolves league outing until April 1991 as the club brought in Mark Kendall, and later Mike Stowell, of whom were both virtual ever-presents at the club. Instead, Bartram had loan spells with Blackpool, Cheltenham Town and West Bromwich Albion, before finally leaving Molineux for Bournemouth in July 1991 for ¬£35,000. He played 132 league games for Bournemouth before moving to Arsenal for ¬£250,000 in 1994. At Arsenal he was David Seaman's understudy, and played just 11 league games in four seasons (all in 1994‚Äì95). To gain playing time, he spent 12 games on loan with Huddersfield Town in late 1997. He signed for Gillingham on loan in March 1998 before the move was made permanent in the summer of 1998. He firmly established himself as the first-choice goalkeeper at the Priestfield Stadium and helped them to the Division Two play-off final in his first full season, where they lost out to Manchester City on penalties. The following season saw them go one step further as they beat Wigan Athletic in the play-off final to reach the second tier for the first time in the club's history. In total, he made over 200 appearances for the Gills, before his retirement from the game in February 2004 due to a wrist injury. The injury was caused by a collision with the opposition goalkeeper, Tony Warner, who had come upfield to try and score a goal from a last-minute corner. Coaching career Bartram is now a Level 3 FA Coach and is the \\"Goalkeeping Manager\\" at the Southampton academy. Personal life Bartram is married to Tracy, a former international netball player and the couple have two sons, Heath and Miles. Bartram also worked in the role of a summariser for BBC Radio Kent.

O'Sullivan sitting in Devil's Den after the Battle of Gettysburg. Alfred Rudolph Waud (w≈çd) (October 2, 1828 ‚Äì April 6, 1891) was an American artist and illustrator, born in London, England. He is most notable for the sketches he made as an artist correspondent during the American Civil War. Early life Waud was christened Alfred Robert Waud but used Rhudolph as a middle name while living in America. He was the eldest son of Alfred Waud Sr., born London 1796. Waud's mother was Mary (n√©e) Fitz-John, born 1806 in Lougher, near Swansea, South Wales. Waud had four siblings: Mary Pricilla, born 1829, William born 1831, Julia, born 1834, and Josephine, born 1840; the last two sisters were both spinsters, but Mary Pricilla married Augustus Cory Scoles in London in 1862. Waud sailed from London aboard the sailing ship Hendrik Hudson in 1850 for New York. His brother William followed in 1855 aboard the sailing ship Hermann, also for New York. Waud was naturalized as an American citizen on January 10, 1870. He married Mary Gertrude Jewell from New York circa 1855 or 1856. They lived in Orange, New Jersey, where they raised their family. Before immigration, Alfred Waud had entered the Government School of Design at Somerset House, London, with the intention of becoming a marine painter. This did not come to fruition, but as a student, he also worked as a painter of theatrical scenery. He intended to pursue that work in the United States, when he immigrated in 1850, seeking employment with actor and playwright John Brougham. In the 1850s, he worked variously as an illustrator for a Boston periodical, the Carpet-Bag, and provided illustrations for books such as Hunter's Panoramic Guide from Niagara to Quebec (1857). Civil War years \\"Kennesaw's Bombardment, 64\\", sketch of the Battle of Kennesaw Mountain, scanned from the original and digitally restored. The period during the American Civil War was a time when all images in a publication had to be hand drawn and engraved by skilled artists. Photography existed but there was no way to transfer a photograph to a printing plate since this was well before the advent of the halftone process for printing photographs. Photographic equipment was too cumbersome and exposure times were too slow to be used on the battlefield. An artist such as Waud would do detailed sketches in the field, which were then rushed by courier back to the main office of the newspaper they were working for. There a staff of engravers would use the sketches to create engravings on blocks of boxwood. Since the blocks were about 4 inches across they would have to be composited together to make one large illustration. The wood engraving was then copied via the electrotype process which produced a metal printing plate for publication. In 1860, Alfred Waud became an illustrator or \\"special artist\\" (a full-time paid staff artist) for the New York Illustrated News. In April 1861, the newspaper assigned Waud to cover the Army of the Potomac, Virginia's main Union army. He first illustrated General Winfield Scott in Washington, D.C., and then entered the field to render the First Battle of Bull Run in July. Waud followed a Union expedition to Cape Hatteras, North Carolina the next month and witnessed the Battle of Hatteras Inlet Batteries. That autumn, he sketched army activity in the Tidewater region of Virginia. Waud joined Harper's Weekly toward the end of 1861, continuing to cover the war. In 1864 Alfred's brother, William Waud (who up to that time had been working with \\"Frank Leslie's Illustrated Newspaper\\"), joined Alfred on the staff of Harper's and they worked together during the Petersburg Campaign. Alfred Waud attended every battle of the Army of the Potomac between the First Battle of Bull Run in 1861 and the Siege of Petersburg in 1865. Alfred was one of only two artists present at the Battle of Gettysburg. His depiction of Pickett's Charge is thought to be the only visual account by an eyewitness. Post Civil War work Waud continued to be a prolific illustrator, doing numerous illustrations for Harper's Weekly and other prominent publications, achieving his greatest fame in his post-War work. Waud died in 1891 in Marietta, Georgia, while touring battlefields of the South.

In August 1992, he joined Hyde United on loan, debuting in the 1-1 Northern Premier League draw at Goole Town on 22 August 1992 and appearing twice more for the club before returning to the Drill Field. He moved on to join Leek Town before signing for Barnsley in March 1997. He struggled to hold down a regular first team place and left for Macclesfield Town in 2000 on a free transfer. On 22 March 2001 he became Alan Buckley's first signing for Lincoln City when the Sincil Bank based club agreed to take over his contract until the end of the season. His debut came five days later in the 1‚Äì0 defeat at Hartlepool United but he failed to displace Alan Marriott permanently and, after one final appearance, was released by the club at the end of the season. He moved to Scotland to sign for Ross County in July 2001. A successful spell with County brought him a move to Dundee United in 2003, where his final game was the 2005 Scottish Cup Final defeat to Celtic, before he returned to England with Gillingham. After only five months with Gillingham, Bullock signed for St Mirren in January 2006, but he failed to cement a first-team place and was released in May 2007. He rejoined Ross County in June 2007, along with Stuart Golabek. Bullock was Steven Tweed's first signing for Montrose. He then signed for Dundee on a pre-contract agreement and joined his new teammates for pre- season training ahead of the 2009‚Äì10 season on 1 July 2009. After one season with the club, he was released by the club on 4 May 2010 along with 8 other players. Bullock signed for Livingston in 2010. In June 2012, Bullock signed for Arbroath in a player-coach role. On 25 September, Bullock left Arbroath, with manager Paul Sheerin saying \\"He has had a sense of frustration about football for a while now and reckons that it is best that he takes a break from it.\\" On 1 November 2013, Bullock signed for Scottish League One side Airdrieonians, making his debut the same day in a 3‚Äì0 defeat against Rangers in the Scottish Cup. This turned out to be his only appearance for the club and he then retired from playing and took up a role as their goalkeeping coach. He left Airdrieonians in October 2014. In June 2019, having been coaching at Broughty Athletic, he was appointed goalkeeper coach at Montrose which saw Bullock renew acquaintance with manager Stewart Petrie who he had played with at Ross County and coached with at Arbroath.

After a year off, he spent 1937 and 1938 with several minor league teams, primarily the Syracuse Chiefs. He was promoted to the Reds the following year and made his major league debut on April 26, 1939. Thompson played for the Reds between 1939 and 1942, earning 39 wins against 27 losses. He was 13‚Äì5 as a rookie, but lost Game 3 of the World Series against the New York Yankees as the Reds were swept.

Their sound blends pop and experimental elements, and is a combination of digital and electronic sounds and noises (including drum machine, keyboard, synthesizers and other devices) and analog equipment (including guitars and live drums). The band's music is mostly instrumental. On April 30, 2006, the Octopus Project performed at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival. They were offered the opportunity after a fan, unbeknownst to the band, entered them in a contest held by the festival on MySpace in which voters were to \\"nominate their favorite band for an open slot at the festival\\". In 2007, they supported underground hip hop star, Aesop Rock and indie electronic icons Stereo Total on their national tours. In 2008, the group performed at notable festivals such as Lollapalooza, All Tomorrow's Parties, and the Austin City Limits Festival. The Octopus Project composed and performed a series of unique, individual scores for short films played at Alamo Drafthouse in Austin, Texas in February 2009. For their performance at the South by Southwest festival in their hometown in March 2010, the band put together a multi-media show which involved them performing material from what was to be their upcoming release, Hexadecagon. The band performed surrounded by eight loudspeakers, while eight projectors projected videos corresponding to the music on tent ceilings above the stage and the audience. Later that same year, the Octopus Project played at Moogfest 2010 in Asheville, North Carolina. They were scheduled to play just prior to Devo's headlining set. Three days prior to the concert, Devo's guitarist, Bob Mothersbaugh, severely injured his hand and was unable to play. Since the band was receiving a Moog Innovation Award at the festival, and because they didn't want to disappoint their fans, the remaining two members of Devo enlisted the help of The Octopus Project, and together the two bands performed the Devo songs \\"Girl U Want\\" and \\"Beautiful World.\\" In 2011, the band snagged the opening spot on tours with Devo, Man or Astroman, and Explosions in the Sky. The band spent the rest of that year working on soundtracks for the feature film Kid-Thing, and the video game Thunderbeam. In 2012, The Octopus Project began work on what would be their fifth studio album, Fever Forms. The first single from the album, \\"Whitby\\", was released as an EP in November‚Äîcomplete with b-sides, a karaoke version, and a video directed by the band. In 2014, the band was awarded The Special Jury Award for Musical Score at the Sundance Film Festival for their work on the soundtrack to the film, Kumiko, the Treasure Hunter. In 2015, the band released two EPs of new music paired with handmade art objects -- the first, Mister, a stuffed animal & the second, Nelda, a resin sculpture. Excited about the new tunes, the band dove into writing what would become their next record, 2017's Memory Mirror. The album was mixed and recorded by Dave Fridmann and Danny Reisch. Their newest release, the soundtrack for the film Damsel (2018 film) (a western directed by the Zellner Bros. and starring Robert Pattinson & Mia Wasikowska) came out June 22nd, 2018 on Milan Records. Produced on period specific instruments -- banjo, musical saw, acoustic guitar, flute, wine glasses -- the score finds the band in unknown territory sounding at once both haunting and majestic. 2019 saw the band expanding further into art installation territory, with LOOM II -- an immersive, ambient surround sound & surround light performance, which premiered at the Fusebox Festival in Austin, TX. Current members Ryan Figg and Josh Lambert exchange guitars in the midst of a song in San Francisco, August 2008. All members are known to switch instruments live (for instance, Josh Lambert playing drums while Toto Miranda plays guitar, or Yvonne Lambert playing guitar while Josh Lambert operates the electronics), but each member can be said to play a primary instrument. *Josh Lambert: guitar, bass, keyboards, drums, vocals *Toto Miranda: drums, guitar, bass, vocals *Yvonne Lambert: samplers, keyboards, theremin, glockenspiel, guitar, bass, drums, vocals *Mari Rubio: guitar, keyboards, bass Discography =Studio albums= * Identification Parade (2002) * One Ten Hundred Thousand Million (2005) * Hello, Avalanche (2007) * Hexadecagon (2010) * Fever Forms (2013) * Memory Mirror (2017) =Splits, remixes, singles and EPs= * Christmas on Mars (EP, Soda Pop Productions, 1999) * Black Octopus Lipstick Project Foam Party (Peek- A-Boo Records, 2004) * The House of Apples and Eyeballs (Collaboration with Black Moth Super Rainbow, Graveface Records, 2006) * Wet Gold/Moon Boil (7\\" Peek-a-Boo records, 2007) * Golden Beds (EP, Peek-A-Boo Records, 2009) * Whitby EP (Digital EP, Peek-A-Boo Records, 2012) =Soundtracks= * 21 (2008) * Kid-Thing (2012) * Thunderbeam (2012) * Kumiko, the Treasure Hunter (2014) * Damsel (2018) See also *Music of Austin References Other sources * External links * The Octopus Project - official website * The Octopus Project Interview with thepaperbagwriter * The Octopus Project interview (Josh Lambert) * Interview with The Octopus Project's Josh Lambert Category:Musical groups from Austin, Texas Category:Musical groups established in 1999 Category:Nintendocore musical groups Category:1999 establishments in Texas ","title":"The Octopus Project"},{"id":"6697975","text":"Vincent Joseph \\"Vinnie\\" Gentile (born January 3, 1959) is an American politician who served in the New York City Council from the 43rd district from 2003 to 2017. He is a Democrat. The district includes Bath Beach, Bay Ridge, Bensonhurst, and Dyker Heights in Brooklyn. Life and career Gentile was born into an Italian-American family in the Bay Ridge neighborhood of Brooklyn. He attended Fort Hamilton High School, graduating in 1977 and, in 1983, became founding president of the school's alumni association. He went on to receive a B.A. in Government from Cornell University and a J.D. from Fordham University School of Law. He was first admitted to the New York state bar in 1986. Prior to his involvement in electoral politics, Gentile was a prosecutor in the office of the Queens County District Attorney. There he served for 11 years as an Assistant District Attorney under Richard A. Brown. Following losing an election for the New York Senate in 1994, Gentile first won public office in 1996, when he was able to capitalize upon internal divisions within the Republican Party and win a three-way race for the 23rd District in the New York State Senate. He served three terms before being defeated by then City Councilman Martin J. \\"Marty\\" Golden in 2002. Facing a tough campaign mostly due to redistricting, he lost 55% to 45%. Gentile was the Democratic candidate for New York's 11th congressional district special election in 2015. He lost to Republican Richmond County District Attorney Daniel M. Donovan, Jr.. Green Party candidate, James Lane, came in third. Gentile unsuccessfully sought the position of Kings County District Attorney in 2017. He lost the Democratic Party primary to Eric Gonzalez and then lost to Gonzalez again in the general election where Gentile ran under the Reform Party line. New York City Council Following his defeat for reelection to the Senate, Gentile entered into the special election to fill Golden's city council seat in 2003. In a field of five candidates, four of whom were Democrats, Gentile edged out a win against Republican Rosemarie O'Keefe by 31 votes. Gentile served in the New York City Council for 14 years until his successor was inaugurated in January 2018 due to Gentile‚Äôs term limits. He chaired the Select Committee on Libraries in the Council, and served on the Aging, Cultural Affairs, Finance, and Public Safety committees. He was also the chair of the Council's Italian-American Caucus. { class=\\"wikitable collapsible\\" - valign=bottom ! colspan=4  Election history - valign=bottom ! Location ! Year ! Election !

She was born Susan Jacob Clay in Frankfort, Kentucky to Charles Donald Clay and his wife, the former Mariah Hensley Pepper. Susan was raised on her father's thoroughbred farm outside of Lexington, Kentucky and in the strict Victorian homes of her grandmothers. She was a great-granddaughter of Henry Clay and a granddaughter of James Brown Clay. Much of her life she felt a deep ambivalence toward her heritage. On the one hand, she found that legacy a source of pride, satisfaction, and strength. At the same time, she felt constricted and obligated to live up to a name that carried high expectations in her native Bluegrass region of Kentucky. She also chafed under the restrictions placed on women of her class, time, and place. In the early 1920s Clay worked as a reporter and feature writer for the Louisville Herald newspaper. But on the advice of the writer Edna Ferber, Susan quit that job. Ferber had said that working as a reporter would not help Susan develop as a poet. On May 5, 1927 at age 29, Susan Clay shocked her family and local society by eloping with a divorced, much older Russian √©migr√© named Vassili (William) Sawitzky (1879 - February 2, 1947). He was an art historian and dealer. The couple lived in New York City and Connecticut. They had one child, who was stillborn. At nearly age 84, Susan Sawitzky died in New Haven, Connecticut. She lived alone in a dark, one-room apartment in a dangerous section of the city. Her ashes were scattered near a pond in Stamford, Connecticut. Art history William Sawitzky, an art dealer and art historian, was an authority on eighteenth-century American painting. Susan Sawitzky soon took to this subject with relish. Until he died from emphysema, she helped William with his research. Following William's death, Susan devoted much energy to carrying on his work. She wrote articles on Ralph Earl, Abraham Delanoy, and Reuben Moulthrop that were published by the New York Historical Society. Poetry Sawitzky wrote poetry for more than sixty years. Her earliest published poems and stories appeared in Town & Country, the New York Times, and in local Kentucky publications during the early 1920s. A book, Poems by Susan Clay, was published in 1923. She stopped publishing after her marriage, except for a poem that ran in a 1941 edition of Poetry magazine. In 1984 the Kentucky Poetry Review posthumously published a volume of her work entitled The Encircling Thread. Her poems are moving testaments to the lifelong tension she felt for the traditions which she both honored and rebelled against.

Clerks (1994) =Dante Hicks= Dante Hicks, played by Brian O'Halloran, is 22 (33 in Clerks II), works at the Quick Stop Market in Leonardo, New Jersey, and still lives with his parents. He feels that because he runs the store, he is responsible and successful in life, and yet, he is a push-over who often agrees to work when he doesn't have to (hence his catch phrase, \\"I'm not even supposed to be here today!\\"). He frequently gets into debates ranging from philosophy to Star Wars with his best friend, fellow clerk Randal Graves, who works at the adjacent RST Video Store. Dante is laid-back, personable, articulate, and logical (especially when compared with his best friend Randal), and is easily angered by Randal's actions or behavior, particularly when Randal's actions lead to negative consequences. For example, Dante often scolds Randal for disrespecting customers, while Randal often tries to defend his actions. The film centers on the surreal events of a day at the Quick Stop that Dante must deal with. Among other problems, Dante becomes the target of an anti-smoking mob who pelt him with cigarettes, and he is issued a summons and fined for selling cigarettes to a four-year-old, a crime Randal had in fact accidentally committed. In addition, he is continually stalked by Jay and Silent Bob (Jason Mewes and Kevin Smith), two drug dealers who loiter in front of the store all day and often like to go inside and steal. A running gag throughout the film is the scent of shoe polish on him, as he uses some to write a makeshift open sign to hang over the stuck window shutters of the store. The film also deals with Dante's stressful romantic relationships. He has difficulty dealing with his girlfriend Veronica, especially her extensive history of performing fellatio (on 37 different men, including him) ‚Äî even though she seems to genuinely love him, going so far as to bring him lasagna at work and help him fix a tire. At the same time, Dante is besotted with ex-girlfriend Caitlin Bree and seems intent on rekindling that relationship. In the end, Dante ends up with neither woman; Randal ends the relationship by telling Veronica that Dante never got over Caitlin, and Caitlin is hospitalized after accidentally having sex in a dark bathroom with a corpse, whom she had believed to be Dante. After an argument with Veronica, Dante gets into a physical altercation with Randal, and he rants about his anxieties including the loss of his girlfriend and Caitlin, as well as his overall miserable life. He is left speechless when Randal explodes at him, accusing him of blaming everyone else and not taking responsibility for his lack of initiative. The two reconcile and clean up the Quick Stop. In the final scene, he tells Randal that he is going to try and work things out with Veronica. It is implied that he will try to find direction in his life. In the film's original ending, after Randal leaves the Quick Stop to go home, a customer comes in, with Dante telling him that the store is closed. The customer responds by pulling out a gun and killing Dante before taking the money from the cash register and leaving. The scene is meant to reference Dante & Randall's earlier discussion; that \\"'Empire' was a better film, because it ended on such a down-note\\". Kevin Smith's mentors criticized this ending; under the advice of one of the mentors, John Pierson, Smith edited out that ending. Therefore, the theatrical version ends when Randal leaves. In Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back, Dante, like Randal, has a cameo early in the film in which the two clerks have Jay and Silent Bob arrested for loitering in front of Quick-Stop as well as for selling drugs in front of the store. As a result, a restraining order was placed on Jay and Silent Bob, who were not allowed within a hundred feet of the store. He and Randal attend the Bluntman and Chronic movie premiere, where Dante expresses chagrin that Judi Dench played him in the movie. In Clerks II, Dante and Randal are forced to work at a Mooby's fast food restaurant after Randal accidentally leaves a coffee pot on in the Quick Stop, causing the store to burn down. It is revealed that Dante is engaged and is planning to move to Florida with his fianc√©e Emma. This leaves Randal feeling depressed, but does not express his upset at Dante over the decision until near the end of the movie. Randal also expresses his fears of losing Dante; under the persuasion of Randal, Dante decides to stay in New Jersey. With the two having been fired for Dante's very unconventional bachelor party at Mooby's, the two purchase the Quick Stop and the RST Video, which they restore and co-manage. He also calls off his engagement with Emma in favor of his boss, Becky. Dante briefly appears twice in Jay and Silent Bob Reboot. The first is at the film's opening where he arrives at the Quick Stop to open the store and is quickly pulled aside by police officers. Not knowing what's going on, Dante assumes they are looking for Randal and offers to reveal his location. The second is at the film's end where he complains about the steel shutters being once again jammed with chewed gum, not even noticing Jay, Silent Bob and Jay's daughter Milly. Jay then revealed to Milly that he and Silent Bob had been pranking Dante by purposely putting in chewed gum in the locks for the past twenty-five years. =Randal Graves= Randal Graves, played by Jeff Anderson, is a clerk at RST Video, located next door to the Quick Stop convenience store in Leonardo, New Jersey. Chris Smith in The New York Times described this character as a \\"smart-ass\\", while multiple reviewers have described him as a \\"super slacker\\". In the first film and the cartoon, Randal is a prime example of the typical slacker: He works in a dead-end job, has a hatred for customers, and arrives at work late every day. He periodically closes the store (during work hours) to chat with his best friend Dante Hicks, a Quick Stop clerk. Whereas Dante believes that title dictates responsibility, Randal does whatever he pleases. Randal is usually quite aggressive and offensive (mainly to customers) and does not really seem to care much about what others think about him. He regularly arrives at the video store at least 15‚Äì30 minutes late and charges late fees to customers who have been waiting for the store to open. Often, he ignores customers' requests to recommend a movie, explaining that he does not meddle with other people's affairs (except perhaps those of Dante). He has been known to order porn movies for the store in front of children, spit water in customers' faces, and intrude on private conversations about sex. One of Randal's ancestors, who was Scots-Irish, immigrated to New Jersey in the 17th century. Randal is related to Brodie Bruce of Mallrats. The two share a mutual \\"Cousin Walter\\", who is known for performing bizarre sexual acts, such as masturbating on a crashing aircraft and eventually killing himself while attempting to perform auto-fellatio. Both Brodie and Randal also mention stories regarding their grandmother. Brodie once mentioned she became a lesbian on her sixtieth birthday, while Randal mentioned that she used racial slurs in front of him as a child. The latter scenario influenced Randal into using the term \\"porch monkey\\" in front of an African American couple while working at Mooby's. However, Randal did not know at that point that he used a racial slur and claimed he used the term \\"porch monkey\\" to refer to lazy people of all racial backgrounds in general. Randal's behavior at times appears contradictory; for example, he says that he hates people but loves social gatherings, and says \\"This job would be great if it weren't for the fucking customers\\". Such behavior spills into his relationship with Dante, whom he often coerces into highly unlikely, theoretical situations by manipulating him into feeling guilty. Randal goes off on an analytical theory of something outlandish, before going to the complete opposite. He might also perhaps be the worst friend of all time, frequently causing problems in Dante's personal life by spilling secrets to those he should not. Despite his toxic personality, Randal truly cares for his best friend Dante. He even once said to Dante's ex-girlfriend Caitlin \\"Hey Caitlin. Break his heart again, and I'll kill ya. Nothing personal.\\" to which Caitlin remarks he has always been very protective of Dante. Randal sees Dante as the \\"counterbalance\\" to the former's dislike of other people. Randal only goes to Quick Stop instead of staying in the video store to talk to Dante about whatever comes to mind. Randal does his best to offer whatever advice he can to Dante though Dante generally doesn't take it because of Randal's rather rough way of putting it. Randal has also attempted to do favors for Dante, although they often backfire. For example, in Clerks 2, Randal set up a donkey show as a going- away gift for Dante, who was to move to Florida with his then-fianc√©e, Emma. However, the show results in Dante and Randal getting arrested (alongside co- worker Elias, and Jay & Silent Bob), leading to a near-breakdown in their friendship. Another example was in Clerks in which after Randal told Veronica that Dante left her for his ex-girlfriend Caitlin Bree. However, not only was Randal unaware that Dante reconsidered his decision to leave Veronica for Caitlin, a fight occurs between Randal and Dante after Veronica told him what Randal told her. In Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back, Randal, like Dante, has a cameo early in the film in which the two clerks have Jay and Silent Bob arrested for loitering in front of Quick-Stop as well as for selling drugs in front of the store. As a result, a restraining order was placed on Jay and Silent Bob, who were not allowed within a hundred feet of the store. He and Dante attend the Bluntman and Chronic movie premiere, where Randal mentions putting up another restraining order on Jay and Silent Bob because he is going to give the movie a scathing review on the Internet. Randal's life centers on movies, video games and pornography. He often quotes dialogue and discusses films, goes to other video stores to rent porn, and is often depicted in Clerks: The Animated Series with a porn magazine. His love life is nonexistent (at least in a romantic sense). The few relationships he had never lasted; his ex-girlfriends were subsequently so fed up with men that they became lesbians. In contrast, it is implied he has a budding sex life, despite his overall aimless existence; he frequently has girls over to his house, and brings them over to the Quick Stop when his mother is home. In Clerks II, it is stated that many of his sexual exploits are with \\"barely legal pussy\\" (18-year-old girls), thanks in no small part to their willingness to take part in taboo sexual acts (such as what he and others refer to bluntly as ass-to-mouth). As evidenced in a scene in Clerks II, Randal's favorite band is King Diamond and he is a fan of 80s speed metal and black metal, and dislikes other music, such as the band The Time. He is a fan of the novel Catcher in the Rye because it \\"recognizes the sheer volume of phonies in the world\\" . Randal is also a fan of the Star Wars trilogy and Ranger Danger, and staunchly hates the Lord of the Rings and Transformers. Randal is also frequently the cause of the problems that he and Dante get into much to Dante's constant annoyance. The animated series shows this at least once per episode and it is mentioned in Clerks II that Randal is responsible for several of Dante's ruined relationships. This trait reaches its apex in the third episode of the Animated Series where he almost gets Leonardo Leonardo destroyed by the U.S. Air Force after he mistakes the villain's food poisoning for deadly motaba virus. It's also revealed here that he got his and Dante's jobs throughout the films and show because when Dante is teasing Randal for always being wrong. Randal retorts, \\"What about that time I told you about those two open jobs down the street? You know we'd stay there for a while, earn some money then move on with our lives.\\" He then realizes that they have spent practically a decade at their jobs and yells \\"Oh my God, you're right, I'm always wrong!\\". Randal is based on Smith's long-time friend Bryan Johnson. Randal does not appear in Jay and Silent Bob Reboot, but is mentioned by Dante at the beginning of the film when Dante offers to tell the police where Randal is, implying that Randal has, for undisclosed reasons, gone into hiding since the events of Clerks II. =Veronica Loughran= Veronica Loughran, played by Marilyn Ghigliotti, is Dante's girlfriend in the beginning of Clerks. She is currently attending college and frequently makes attempts to encourage Dante to quit his dead-end job at the Quick Stop. Tensions arise between the two during a conversation about sexual relations, when Dante admits to having sex with 12 different women (including Veronica) and Veronica reveals that she performed oral sex on 37 men, including Dante. Later, as an apology, Veronica returns to the Quick Stop with some lasagna for Dante. The relationship ends badly when Randal tells Veronica at the video store that Dante is dumping her to get back with Caitlin, despite the fact that Dante reconsidered this decision; as a result, Veronica storms in at the Quick Stop and attacks Dante before leaving. Veronica does not appear in the sequel, but she is mentioned in a deleted scene, where Randall calls out Dante for going to Brookdale Community College just to appease Veronica. This implies they made up after the argument in the first film but subsequently broke up. =Jay and Silent Bob= =Willam Black= Willam Black was played by longtime View Askew film editor and producer Scott Mosier in Clerks, Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back and Clerks II. He was played by Ethan Suplee in Mallrats. Willam is referred to as an \\"idiot man-child\\" by other characters in the View Askewniverse, mostly because of his limited intelligence and demeanor (glazed eyes, unkempt hair and beard, and lack of coordination). He has an oddly profane sexual taste, which includes snowballing, thus giving him his other nickname, \\"Snowball\\". He is often seen staring at ceilings and saying \\"That's beautiful, man!\\" =Caitlin Bree= Caitlin Bree first appeared in Clerks. She was portrayed by Lisa Spoonauer. She was one of Dante's old girlfriends. Both of them express a desire to restart their relationship. At the end of the film, however, she has sex with a corpse at the Quick Stop bathroom, believing it to be Dante. She is sent a mental institution to deal with her trauma afterward. It was revealed in Chasing Amy that Caitlin and Alyssa Jones had a homosexual relationship that included fisting. In the comic book Clerks: The Holiday Special, Dante visits Caitlin at the asylum located in Marlboro. Caitlin has not spoken a word since the incident, prompting Randal to suggest that Dante fornicate with Caitlin using a candy cane. Caitlin awakens from her state, but is furious and does not want to see him again. Caitlin was also mentioned in Clerks: The Lost Scene and Clerks II. In Kevin Smith's never-produced script Superman Lives, the governor is named Caitlin Bree. It is assumed, but not confirmed, to be the same Bree from \\"Clerks\\". Smith named the character after his favorite Degrassi character, Caitlin Ryan. =Julie Dwyer= Julie Dwyer was first mentioned in Clerks as an old high school friend of Dante Hicks and Randal Graves who died at a swimming pool at a YMCA. Her funeral scene was eventually shown (in animated form), in Clerks: The Lost Scene, which appeared on the Clerks X DVD set. In Mallrats (which takes place the day before Clerks.), Dwyer is told that the camera adds 10 pounds, so she over-exercises before her appearance on the game show Truth or Date, which leads to her death. She is mentioned in Chasing Amy as a friend of Alyssa Jones. She is referred to again in Clerks II, where Randal mentions going to her funeral and his claim that Dante said he needs to \\"shit or get off the pot\\" (which Dante claims was actually said by Randal). =Rick Derris= First appearing in Clerks, Rick Derris was played by Ernest O'Donnell, (a childhood friend of Kevin Smith). Rick is a sexual deviant in the Askewniverse. In Clerks, while bragging about being more physically fit than Dante Hicks, he reveals to Dante that he had sex with his ex-girlfriend Caitlin Bree during their five-year relationship. In Mallrats, Gwen Turner, T.S. Quint, and Brodie Bruce recall an incident at a costume party in which Derris and Turner had sex on a pool table. While Turner thinks it was a trivial event, Bruce and Quint remember the event very well because Derris and Turner were having sex on a pool table while dressed as Jackie Gleason and Burt Reynolds, respectively, from Smokey and the Bandit. In Chasing Amy, Derris and his friend Cohee London engaged in a three-way with Tricia Jones's older sister Alyssa Jones during high school, which gave her the nickname \\"Finger Cuffs\\". When Alyssa is confronted by Holden McNeil about this occurrence during Chasing Amy, Ernest O'Donnell makes a cameo sitting next to them and listening in. He was planned to be Jay's older brother, but as the movie in which this point would be addressed was never produced, Kevin Smith has stated that this is no longer the case. =Old Man= An unnamed elderly man, played by Al Berkowitz, approaches Dante and asks to use the restroom, which is normally for employees only. He disappears into the restroom after harassing Dante for a softer roll of toilet paper and a porno magazine to read. It is later on revealed that he dies of a heart attack while masturbating over the magazine; his body maintains an erection as a result of rigor mortis. Dante does not take notice of this due to him closing the store to play hockey on the roof and attend Julie Dwyer's wake. In addition, the restroom light shuts off automatically at 5:14 p.m. for reasons unknown. As a result, Caitlin Bree winds up having sex with the elderly man's corpse, mistaking it for Dante. =Chewlies Representative= A customer, played by Scott Schiaffo, pays for a cup of coffee and asks Dante if he can drink it beside the register counter. He then confronts a younger customer who is about to buy a pack of cigarettes, pulling out a cancer-ridden lung out of his handbag and showing him several effects of smoking before persuading him to buy a pack of Chewlies gum instead. Later on, he instigates a small demonstration in the store by calling Dante a \\"merchant of death\\" and encouraging customers to throw cigarettes at him. The revolt is stopped by Veronica, who sprays everyone with a fire extinguisher before stopping the customer from exiting. After discovering that he is a Chewlies representative, she tells him to leave before telling the other customers to go back to their jobs. =Olaf the Russian Metalhead= Olaf, played by John Henry Westhead, is introduced by Jay as Silent Bob's Russian cousin. He is from Moscow and speaks very little English, but according to Jay, he runs a heavy metal band back in Russia and is looking to do a gig in New York City. A running gag throughout the film is Olaf's song \\"Berserker\\". A shirt for Olaf's band is worn by Jay throughout Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back. Mallrats (1995) =Brodie Bruce= Brodie Bruce (Jason Lee) is an unemployed, lazy, comic book-obsessed, Sega-playing slacker, living with his parents and lacking the initiative and prospects appropriate to his age. Kevin Smith has said Walt Flanagan was the inspiration for the character. Brodie is named after the main character in Jaws (a favorite film of Smith's, and one the director frequently references in his work), while his surname, Bruce, was the nickname given to the animatronic shark in Jaws. His girlfriend, Rene Mosier, to whom Brodie's mother has never been introduced (out of fear on the part of Brodie), breaks up with him at the beginning of Mallrats and gives him a letter listing the reasons for doing so. At the end of the film they are back together, and it is mentioned that he went on to host The Tonight Show, with Rene as his band leader and having gained the approval from his mother. He makes a brief appearance in Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back in which he now owns his own comic book store called \\"Brodie's Secret Stash\\". =Rene Mosier= Rene Mosier (Shannen Doherty) is Brodie's girlfriend. She broke up with him prior to the events of the film and began dating Shannon Hamilton, a clothing store manager at the mall. Brodie confronts her about the relationship, an encounter that leads to the two having sex in an elevator. Shannon later assaults Brodie and claims that he and Rene will have sex in a \\"very uncomfortable place\\" (interpreted to be the back of a Volkswagen). However, this apparently never happens as Shannon is later arrested after Truth or Date for statutory rape, and Brodie and Rene reconcile. Later, when Brodie becomes the host of The Tonight Show, Rene serves as his bandleader. Rene's last name is a reference to frequent Kevin Smith collaborator and close friend Scott Mosier. As a nod to her actor, who was well known for her role as Brenda Walsh on Beverly Hills, 90210, she is mistakenly referred to as \\"Brenda\\" by Willam at one point. =Shannon Hamilton= Shannon Hamilton is a character from Mallrats played by Ben Affleck. In the film, Shannon is the manager of the Fashionable Male clothing store. He is the arch enemy of Brodie Bruce (Jason Lee), a local mallrat and a major character in the film. It is revealed that Shannon is dating Bruce's ex-girlfriend Rene Mosier (Shannen Doherty), who dumped Bruce that morning and also has \\"no respect for people with no shopping agenda\\". Shannon later abducts Bruce and beats him severely, saying that he likes comforting girls on the rebound of unsuccessful relationships so that he can \\"fuck them in an uncomfortable place\\", which Bruce asks if it's the back of a Volkswagen. This becomes a running joke in the film. Also, Tricia Jones (Renee Humphrey) reveals that she had sex with Hamilton as research for her book Borgasm: A Study of the 90s Male Sexual Prowess. She even taped their sexual encounter. During the Truth or Date game show, Bruce announces his love for Rene, which angers Hamilton. Just before he can assault Bruce, Silent Bob starts the video tape of Hamilton and Tricia Jones' sexual encounter that is played on the Truth or Date big screens. When Bruce tells the police that Jones is 15 years old, Hamilton is arrested for statutory rape (while protesting \\"I thought she was 36!\\"). During the conclusion, it is said that \\"Shannon made a lot of friends at the Rahway State Correctional Facility\\" and see a hand wrap around Hamilton's, with \\"Love\\" tattooed on his fingers. Shannon is mentioned in Chasing Amy, when Alyssa Jones says she had sex with him in college, only to have a tape of their sexual encounter be broadcast all over campus, thus retroactively making his comeuppance in Mallrats a case of poetic justice. In Clerks: The Comic Book, Shannon's face is seen on a milk carton which says he is missing. When Kevin Smith was talking about making a sequel to Mallrats with the comic book Mallrats 2: Die Hard in a Mall, he stated that Hamilton would be the main villain. =Tricia Jones= Tricia Jones first appeared in the film Mallrats. She was portrayed by Renee Humphrey. Tricia is the 15-year-old sister of Alyssa Jones and the author of Boregasm, a look into the sex drive of men between the ages of 14 and 30, which was later made into a movie. While writing the book, she kept a journal of all the men with whom she had sex, and video taped every experience. The archived videos were used to help Brodie Bruce win back his ex-girlfriend, Rene, from his nemesis Shannon Hamilton. Upon Brodie's urgent request, she gave Jay the tape of her sexual encounter with Shannon. Silent Bob was able to hack into the video output and play the tape during the live taping of Truth or Date. Shannon was thereafter arrested for statutory rape. In the comic series Chasing Dogma, Jay and Silent Bob are seen living with Tricia, only to be kicked out after months of loafing around (and after Jay spied on her in the shower). It is revealed that she had slept with Silent Bob (but not Jay, much to Jay's annoyance) as part of research for Boregasm. Tricia is briefly mentioned in Chasing Amy, when her sister Alyssa Jones informed Holden McNeil via telephone that her \\"sister is in town\\", to which McNeil replies, \\"the one who wrote the book?\\" Tricia also makes a brief appearance in Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back, where she discusses The Bluntman and Chronic Movie with Alyssa. =Gwen Turner= Gwen Turner is a supporting character in Mallrats. She was portrayed by Joey Lauren Adams. Turner was the ex-girlfriend of T.S. Quint, one of the main characters played by Jeremy London. Despite cheating on him constantly, she still maintains a soft-spot for him. Throughout Mallrats, Gwen is seen interacting with T.S. and Brodie. Her clothes shopping is often interrupted by Silent Bob crashing into her dressing room as she is changing. She also causes a major story point when she convinces Brandi Svenning (Claire Forlani) that T.S. was in fact a great boyfriend. Gwen has been mentioned in other View Askew media. In Chasing Amy, Alyssa Jones mentioned that she left her prom so that she could have sex with her 26-year-old date and Gwen in a limo her parents had rented (this is something of an in-joke, as both Turner and Jones were played by the same actress). Also, in the Clerks comic book Where's the Beef?, Randal mentions that Dante Hicks tried to impress Gwen by wearing a Batman costume and standing on a roof top. =LaFours= LaFours is a fictional character from the film, Mallrats, who works as chief security guard at the local mall. He was portrayed by Sven-Ole Thorsen. LaFours is considered (even by Jay and Silent Bob) as one of the most intimidating security guards on duty, due to his size and strength; in fact he's even got \\"two kills\\" on his record. Whilst attempting to get past LaFours in the destruction of the \\"Truth or Date\\" stage, Jay and Silent Bob mess up, resulting in both of them being pursued by him. We later see the chief security guard attempting to evict T.S. and Brodie from the mall, only to get hit from behind by Jay with a baseball bat. LaFours and his team attempt to take both him and Silent Bob down, but lose track of him when they use a grappling hook. He is also seen having sex with Tricia Jones later in the film. In the epilogue, he acquires a signed copy of Tricia's book (and perhaps even struck up a romance with her). We also see LaFours on a large Bluntman and Chronic front cover, as seen at the comic book convention in Chasing Amy. LaFours is a historical/movie reference to Joe LeFors from Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. Both characters wear white skimmers and both are portrayed as legendary law enforcers within their respective films. =T.S. Quint = T.S. Quint (referred to as T.S. by friends) is one of the main characters in Mallrats. He was portrayed by Jeremy London. In the film, T.S. is having trouble with his girlfriend Brandi Svenning (Claire Forlani) dealing with her authoritarian father (Michael Rooker). He tries to convince her to go to Florida, where he planned to propose to her at Universal Studios when \\"Jaws pops out of the water\\". This was ruined, however, when Brandi had to fill in for Julie Dwyer on her father's Truth or Date television pilot. T.S., showing his anger, causes Brandi to break up with him. Filled with grief, T.S. joins fellow newly dumped best friend Brodie Bruce (Jason Lee) on a road trip to the local mall. Amongst many activities, the two realize that Mr. Svenning's Truth or Date is being filmed live at the mall that evening. After being kicked out by mall security under Svenning's orders, Brodie and T.S. get sage-like advise from a topless psychic in a dirt mall and return to stop the dating show. The duo successfully sabotage the show and T.S. finally proposes to Brandi, ending up with the two sharing a kiss. In an epilogue to the film, it is revealed that T.S. and Brandi got married after they graduated at Universal Studios in Florida. They share their first husband-to-wife kiss just as Jaws pops out of the water. In the original opening scene of Mallrats, while at the 37th Annual Governor's Ball, T.S., dressed as a Revolutionary Soldier for a musical at the event, gets a musket tied up in Brandi's hair while on the roof of the high school where the event is being held. The governor's security believe it's an assassination attempt and the event turns into a shoot out. The governor is injured and ruins the chance of Svenning getting a check from her. Throughout this version, people in the mall recognize T.S. from television, to which he responds \\"I got a musket tied up in my girlfriend's hair for God's sakes\\". This line of the plot is referenced in the theatrical version of film when one of the television producers mentions the Governor's ball to Svenning. =Steve-Dave Pulasti and Walt Grover = Steve-Dave Pulasti (usually referred to as Steve-Dave) and Walt \\"the Fanboy\\" Grover made their first appearance in Mallrats. They are played by Smith's longtime friends Bryan Johnson and Walt Flanagan, respectively. Walt has a signature catchphrase; whenever Steve-Dave argues with a character, his comments will be followed by Walt saying \\"Tell 'em Steve-Dave!\\" According to Johnson, the character of Steve-Dave is based on the owner of a comic book store that Smith, Johnson, and Flanagan once frequented; \\"Walter could never remember if the guy's name was actually Steve or Dave. So the name Steve-Dave was coined.\\" Steve-Dave and Walt also appeared briefly in Dogma; they had scenes in Chasing Amy and Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back that were cut from the final edit. The duo have also appeared in most of the comic books based on the Askewniverse. They also appeared in a Jay and Silent Bob MTV short. The duo have been made into action figures. =Jared Svenning= Jared is the father of Brandi Svenning, T.S's girlfriend. He is portrayed by Michael Rooker. Jared is T.S's antagonist throughout the film, and Jared is seen being happy that Brandi and T.S. broke up. He is also in charge of the TV game show Truth or Date in which one of its shows was to take place at the local mall. After a confrontation with T.S. and during a new meeting with him, Brodie stinkpalms (In which Brodie inserted his own hand up his butt) Jared by shaking his hand and offering him chocolate pretzels (in which Jared holds every pretzel he eats with the hand that he shook Brodie's stink-palmed hand with). Jared unsuccessfully has Brodie and T.S. arrested, but they are rescued by Jay and Silent Bob. Jared becomes ill after getting stink-palmed, and his show is ruined. =Willam= Willam is a minor character in both Clerks (where he was portrayed by Scott Mosier) and Mallrats (portrayed by Ethan Suplee).http://www.avclub.com/article/ethan-suplee- deepwater-horizon-mallrats-and-not-kn-242980 Interview with Ethan Suplee Throughout the film he is seen trying to find a sailboat within an autostereogram, constantly failing at it while other characters, including T.S., Brodie, Rene, some kids, and Stan Lee, succeed. At the end of the film he finally snaps and wanders around the mall moaning about the sailboat, unknowingly hitting the stage at a crucial point when Silent Bob is trying to retrieve a video tape he dropped and causing it to go right back into Silent Bob's hands. During the credits it is revealed that Willam eventually found the sailboat, although Willam himself seems surprised. In subsequent comic books, Willam makes cameo roles, still lamenting about the sailboat. Chasing Amy (1997) =Holden McNeil = Holden McNeil is the main character in the film Chasing Amy. The character is played by Ben Affleck. Throughout the film he is trying to develop a working relationship with Alyssa Jones, who is a lesbian. He is the co-creator of the fictitious comic book Bluntman and Chronic. Kevin Smith has stated that Holden is the View Askewniverse character most similar to himself. Holden also appears in Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back, living in a small barnhouse and giving Jay and Silent Bob information about the internet. He was named after the lead character Holden Caulfield from Catcher in the Rye. =Banky Edwards= Banky Edwards is a major supporting character in Chasing Amy. He was played by Jason Lee. Banky is Holden McNeil's lifelong best friend and co-created the smash hit Bluntman & Chronic with him. Banky is very protective of Holden and finds his infatuation with Alyssa Jones to be disgusting. He also exhibits many examples of ignorant homophobic behavior throughout the film, which eventually leads to him and Holden breaking off their friendship, ending the comic. Banky returned in Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back. Having received exclusive movie rights for Bluntman and Chronic, Banky has allowed a film adaptation to go through production which sets Jay and Silent Bob on an adventure to stop this from taking place. Banky is on the set when Jay and Silent Bob arrive, attempting to make Hollywood connections. After arguing with the two stoners while a gun fight is taking place, Banky agrees to give the two of them part of his profits in exchange for the film going through. However, the film turns out to be a huge bomb which effectively ends Edwards' career. In Chasing Amy, Banky, an inker on Bluntman and Chronic, is accused by a comic book fan (Scott Mosier) of being \\"a tracer\\", which leads to a fight. In a deleted scene from Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back, the fan returns to call Banky a tracer once again, which results in another confrontation. =Hooper LaMante = Hooper LaMante (a.k.a. Hooper X) is a character from Chasing Amy played by Dwight Ewell. A gay man himself, he tells Holden to accept Alyssa's sexuality and try not to worry about it. Hooper is seen again at the end of Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back, walking out of the premiere of the Bluntman and Chronic: The Movie with Banky. While Banky is in shock of the fact that the movie will ruin him, Hooper says that the movie was like \\"watching Batman & Robin all over again\\". It's also implied that he has at least a sexual relationship with Banky; when Banky makes a remark about Hooper \\"taking shaft as opposed to being Shaft\\" Hooper replies \\"I don't hear you complaining.\\" In an extended deleted scene, we hear Hooper continuing, \\"Well, I don't hear you complaining nightly. In fact, all I hear from you is, 'Yes, Hooper. Cram the balls! Work the shaft! And...\\" To which Banky responds \\"Hey! Hey, HEY! What'd we say? Not in public.\\" =Alyssa Jones= Alyssa Jones is the main character in the film Chasing Amy. She is played by Joey Lauren Adams. In Chasing Amy, she meets Holden McNeil and Banky Edwards at a comic book convention in New York where the two men are promoting their comic Bluntman and Chronic. Holden is attracted to her, but soon learns that she is attracted to women. The two begin hanging out and both of them develop a deep friendship, however, Holden is no longer able to contain his feelings and confesses his love to Alyssa. She at first is initially angry with him, but that night, the two begin a romantic relationship. Their new relationship worsens the tension between Holden and Banky, who dislikes and distrusts Alyssa and is bothered by her and Holden's relationship. Banky investigates and uncovers Alyssa's past and he tells Holden that Alyssa participated in a threesome with two guys in high school which gave her the nickname \\"Finger Cuffs\\". Holden is deeply disturbed by this revelation, having believed that he is the first man Alyssa had ever slept with. Holden angrily confronts Alyssa while attending a hockey game. During a tearful argument, she admits to Holden about her \\"many\\" youthful sexual experimentations and apologizes for letting him believe that he was the only man she had been with, however, she refuses to apologize for her past actions, and Holden leaves feeling angry and confused. Inspired by Silent Bob's story, Holden devises a plan to fix both his relationship with Alyssa and his fractured friendship with Banky. Holden invites both of them over to his place and tells Alyssa that he would like to get over her past and remain as her boyfriend and also tells Banky that he realizes that Banky is in love with him; kissing him passionately to prove the point. Holden suggests that the three of them have a threesome. While Banky agrees to participate, however, Alyssa refuses, explaining to Holden that it will not save their relationship. Before leaving, Alyssa tells Holden that she loves him, but she will not be his whore. One year later, Alyssa is busy promoting her new comic at a convention in New York, where Banky (also promoting his comics in the same convention) gestures Holden to her booth and provides wordless encouragement to talk to her. They have a quiet, emotional conversation and Holden gives her a copy of his new comic \\"Chasing Amy\\", which is based on their relationship and tells her goodbye. After Holden leaves, Alyssa's new girlfriend arrives and asks who he was. A shaken, misty-eyed Alyssa replies, \\"Oh, just some guy I knew\\". Dogma (1999) =Bethany Sloane= Bethany Sloane is played by actress Linda Fiorentino. Bethany was born in 1961 (which makes her 38 during the events in Dogma), and was raised as a devout Roman Catholic. When she was five years old, a neighborhood kid named Bryan Johnson urinated in her hand (Bryan died of leukemia two years later). She didn't tell anyone about the incident, until it was revealed to her by Rufus 30 years later. Upon leaving high school, Bethany attended Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh with her high school sweetheart, Brett Waits. She gets pregnant sometime in 1981. After an argument on whether or not to have the child with Brett, Bethany gets an abortion. She tells him, however, that she had a miscarriage. Upon graduating from Carnegie Mellon, Bethany and Brett get married and attempt to start a family. However, Bethany had an infection inside her uterus stemming from her abortion years earlier, making her unable to have children. Upon finding out about this after Bethany confesses to Brett about what had really happened, Brett divorces Bethany and some time later, marries another woman. While Bethany is talking to her mother about her personal crises, Bethany loses her faith in God. Shortly afterwards, Bethany settles in McHenry, Illinois and works at an abortion clinic. However, her faith is restored when she is recruited by the Metatron to save existence from two renegade angels, simultaneously learning that she is the last living relative of Jesus Christ. The unique friendships she forms with various unknown figures from Christian history during her journey, and their insights into her past and the world around her, inspire Bethany to regain her faith and strength. At the film's conclusion, she becomes pregnant as a gift from God for her work in Her efforts. =Bartleby and Loki = Bartleby and Loki are two characters from Dogma. They were portrayed by Ben Affleck and Matt Damon, respectively. Bartleby's name comes from the short story \\"Bartleby, the Scrivener\\" and Loki's comes from the Norse god of the same name. Back during the earliest days of earth, Bartleby became friends with Loki, the Angel of Death. After Loki finished slaughtering the first born Egyptians, the two went out for a post-slaughter drink. During a drunken conversation, Bartleby convinces Loki that he should give up slaughtering humans in the name of God. Loki, taking the advice seriously, presents himself before God, throws down his fiery sword and gives God the finger. God, enraged by this act, banishes the two to a fate worse than Hell: spending eternity in Wisconsin (also decreeing that angels can no-longer drink alcohol). After a couple of millennia the two are anonymously clued-into a little-known loophole through plenary indulgence, thanks to a New Jersey church celebrating its centennial. The two decide to journey to New Jersey in hopes of getting into Heaven, not knowing that it will wipe out the omniverse in the process. After a mishap on a bus, the two end up getting an update from the demon Azrael (Jason Lee) about Heaven and Hell's search for them and the threat of the Last Scion (Bethany Sloan (Linda Fiorentino)). The two decide to take his advice to lie low. They take a train to New Jersey, which happens to have Bethany and her friends on it. When their identities are revealed, the two then fight the group until they are thrown out of the moving train by Silent Bob. This is where Bartleby suddenly changes his genial, easy-going attitude to one of angst-ridden revenge against the Lord, and Loki changes his attitude to a more pacifist, meek one. The two walk the rest of their way to Jersey and arrive just in time for the church's centennial celebration. Here, after interrupting, Bartleby and Loki starts to kill everyone at the event one-by- one, knowing their own souls will be clean once they enter the church. Bethany and company arrive at the scene to find a drunken, wingless Loki swirling around dead bodies while Bartleby flies above. When Bartleby announces his plan to his foes, a drunken Loki turns a new leaf and tries to stop Bartleby, because as a side effect of cutting his wings off and becoming human, Loki now has a conscience. Bartleby stabs Loki in the gut, killing him. After having his wings shot off by Jay, Bartleby heads for the church, but is interrupted by Metatron (Alan Rickman) and God Herself (Alanis Morissette). Kneeling before Her, Bartleby is killed by the sound of Her voice, with all other humans covering their ears at the time this happens remaining unharmed. Smith talked about making a one-issue comic book about Bartleby and Loki. It would show the story of how the two are banished to Wisconsin. As of October 2006, the comic is still on his agenda. A joke made by Ben Affleck in a Train Wreck video for Clerks II was turned into a rumor that Bartleby would return in said film via a brief cameo appearance. Affleck did make a cameo in the film, but as a new character. =Cardinal Glick = Cardinal Glick is a character from Dogma, played by George Carlin. Glick was the head minister of a local New Jersey church that is celebrating its centennial. In hopes to get publicity for this event, Glick announces the Catholicism WOW! campaign which he uses to update the Catholic Church for a younger generation. The leading symbol of the campaign is the Buddy Christ, which Glick describes as a more realistic depiction of Jesus Christ than the Christ-on-a-Cross depiction. His campaign is nearly put in jeopardy when the film's main characters Bethany, Rufus and Jay and Silent Bob try to stop the centennial celebration so that the two fallen angels Bartleby and Loki can't carry through with their plenary indulgence plan. Glick refuses to comply due to his needs for the WOW campaign. The two angels arrive during the celebration and kill all in attendance, including Glick. Glick can be seen briefly in a few panels of Chasing Dogma. Clerks: The Animated Series (2000) =Leonardo Leonardo= Leonardo Leonardo, voiced by Alec Baldwin, is a billionaire villain in Clerks: The Animated Series. In the series' first episode \\"Leonardo Leonardo Returns and Dante Has an Important Decision to Make\\", it is revealed that in the early 1800s, Leonardo's great-grandfather Bernardo Leonardo purchased the land that was to be Leonardo, NJ, from the Indians for $14.8 million. Leonardo himself achieved his fortune decades ago when he explored parts of Canada and acquired exclusive Canadian mineral rights in exchange for introducing the polio virus to the natives. Leonardo returns to his hometown and introduces the population to his superstore \\"Quicker Stop\\" in an attempt to put Dante and Randal out of business. His plan fails when the two clerks slash their prices by 75%. He also fails to bribe the clerks into working for him by offering them full benefits, stock options and enrollment in college. Dante and Randal later on discover Leonardo's true motives for returning to the town: he will replace all of the stores with a theme park-style Canadian goods shop, followed by a domed pleasure paradise made to be New Jersey's premier tourist destination. The clerks also discover that Leonardo's scheme involves decimating the town's population. Dante and Randal quickly thwart Leonardo's plan and the Quicker Stop is inadvertently destroyed by Jay and Silent Bob. =Mr. Plug= Mr. Plug, voiced by Dan Etheridge, is Leonardo Leonardo's butler. A parody of Oddjob from Goldfinger, Mr. Plug has a heavy-set Asian build; his voice, however, is somewhat high-pitched and feminine. It is revealed in the episode \\"Leonardo Is Caught in the Grip of an Outbreak of Randal's Imagination and Patrick Swayze Either Does or Doesn't Work in the New Pet Store\\" that Mr. Plug is actually a robot. =Lando= Lando, voiced by Mario Joyner, is an African- American character introduced by Dante and Randal in the episode \\"Leonardo Is Caught in the Grip of an Outbreak of Randal's Imagination and Patrick Swayze Either Does or Doesn't Work in the New Pet Store\\" in response to a viewer letter asking why the show does not have any black characters. Seen as a jab on tokenism (and sharing his name with Lando Calrissian, the token character from Star Wars), Lando sporadically appears in two episodes, often just walking across the screen. At the end of the aforementioned episode of his debut, he is about to share some words of wisdom with Dante and Randal when the scene suddenly cuts to Jay and Silent Bob's segment. =Charles Barkley= Charles Barkley voices a fictionalized version of himself. He appears in the show's ending segments trying to educate the kids. However, Jay and Silent Bob always chase him away. In one episode, he appears as part of a basketball team who make up the jury for a court trial between Jay and Dante. Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back (2001) =Marshal Willenholly = Federal Wildlife Marshal Willenholly is a character from Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back. His name comes from Land of the Lost's three main characters Rick Marshal, Will and Holly (in a deleted scene, Willenholly called an FBI agent named Sid N. Marty (played by comedian Adam Carolla), a reference to Sid and Marty Krofft, who created Land of the Lost). The character was portrayed by Will Ferrell, who would later portray the lead character Rick Marshall in the motion picture adaptation of Land of the Lost. After the film's heroes are framed for a jewel heist, Willenholly arrives to investigate the lesser crime that involved the two in the theft of an orangutan named Susanne from the Provasic animal testing facility. Willenholly, along with a slew of Utah state police officers (the lead played by Brat Pack member Judd Nelson) catch the three at the local Arena diner. When Jay and Bob come out with Susanne (dressed as a child), they claim that \\"he\\" is their gay love child. Willenholly lets them go, not realizing that the \\"kid\\" was a monkey until it is to late. Willenholly follows them into the sewers and into the duct of a dam. Susanne manages to trick Willenholly to jump out of the duct and into the water so that she, Jay and Bob can escape. Willenholly later arrives at the station house, soaked from head to toe. There, he receives information that Jay and Bob are going to Hollywood. He ends up on Miramax studios, searching for the two and has a few near fatal mishaps on the way. When Willenholly finds the two on the set of the Bluntman and Chronic film, he engages in a shootout with the female gang that actually pulled off the jewel heist. After knocking out the three other members of the gang, the fourth member Justice (Shannon Elizabeth) gives Willenholly the diamonds, confesses to the heist and asks for a reduced sentence so that she could get off to be with Jay. Willenholly, hoping it will boost his career, agrees. Willenholly and Justice are later seen walking out of the Bluntman and Chronic film premiere, Willenholly being the only character to say something positive about the film. He is also seen dancing at the Morris Day and the Time concert. Clerks II (2006) =Becky Scott = Becky (nicknamed Becks by Dante Hicks and Randal Graves), played by Rosario Dawson, is a lead female character in Clerks II. She is the manager of the Mooby's that Dante and Randal work at. Dante does her nails [like he did with Veronica in the first film] during his breaks. Becky does not believe in romantic love, instead deciding that life and relationships are about \\"fucking as much as possible\\"; accusing society of peddling marriage and families in order to sustain the economy. During the course of the film, she develops a relationship with Dante, as they talk to each other very often in the office. When Dante tells her he does not know how to dance, she offers to teach him some steps on the restaurant's rooftop to the tune of the Jackson 5's \\"ABC\\". During the dance, she reveals to him that she is pregnant, as they had a one night stand on a restaurant prep table a few weeks back. At the end of the film, Dante breaks off his engagement with Emma and proposes to Becky at Mooby's. She accepts and helps Dante and Randal reopen the Quick Stop. =Elias Grover = Elias Grover, portrayed by Trevor Fehrman is a 19-year-old born again Christian employee at Mooby's alongside Dante and Randal. Elias is obsessed with both The Lord of the Rings and Transformers, and is always subjected to Randal's jokes and abuse. Despite constantly harassing him, Randal insists that after Dante leaves for Florida, Elias will be Randal's new best friend. With the aid of Jay and Silent Bob, Elias gets high during the donkey show that Randal set up at Mooby's and despite his religious views, Elias is seen masturbating during the show, apologizing to God the whole time. At the end of the film, he applies for a job at RST Video and becomes a clerk after Dante and Randal reopen the Quick Stop. =Emma Bunting = Emma Bunting appears in a supporting role in Clerks II. (She is played by Jennifer Schwalbach Smith, Kevin Smith's wife.) In the beginning of the film, she is engaged to Dante and both are to drive to Florida the next day to live in a new house and run a car wash. She shows her affection for Dante by wearing a T-shirt that reads \\"Mrs. Hicks\\". Randal, however, sees Emma as a threat to his friendship with Dante. In the middle of the film, Dante falls for Becky. Emma arrives at the restaurant that night and sees them kissing. Angered by the scene, Emma throws her engagement ring at Becky and a cake at Dante and runs off. Emma was the typical popular, attractive, rich girl in high school, leading her to a series of disappointing relationships as she dated the popular guys. She eventually learned to seek the \\"unconventional\\" men for a relationship, leading her to Dante. =Lance Dowds= Lance Dowds appears in the film Clerks II. He was portrayed by Jason Lee. He was an arrogant student who was bullied frequently in high school, earning the nickname \\"Pickle Fucker\\" after taking part in a high school hazing which involved the seniors shoving a pickle up his anus. After graduating, he founded a search engine called MadDucats.com and sold it to Amazon.com for $20 million, making him an Internet multi-millionaire. He appears in just one scene where he criticizes Dante and Randal, who are still working in dead-end minimum wage jobs, before ordering food from them. In response to Lance's comments, Randal prepares his food by secretly placing dead flies on the hamburger and using ice from a urinal for the drink. Lance, however, gives the meal to Jay before leaving the restaurant. Jay and Silent Bob are seen eating the meal outside, with Jay asking Silent Bob, \\"This tastes like piss and flies don't it?\\" =The Sexy Stud= The Sexy Stud appears as a supporting role in Clerks II. He is played by Zak Charles Knutson. He appears near the end of the film during the donkey show Randal set up as a celebration for Dante's later canceled plans of moving during Florida. Randal at first believed a woman was going to have sex with the donkey, and also believed that the Sexy Stud was the pimp (Randal first thought that Kelly was the supposed name of the woman while the donkey was the Sexy Stud). However, the Sexy Stud revealed that the donkey is Kelly while he himself was the Sexy Stud. The Sexy Stud performed sexual acts on the donkey that both appall and fascinate Becky, Dante, Randal, Jay and Silent Bob. But Elias, who watched the show as well, was too drunk to be aware that there was no woman in the show.

And at first King's son called Anund, whose father had sent him to enlarge his kingdom, after arriving to Woman Land (patriam feminarum), whom we consider to be Amazons, was killed along with his army from poison, that they had mixed to the spring water.\\" (III 15) :\\"After that come the Swedes (Sueones) that rule wide areas up until Woman Land (terram feminarum). Living east of these are said to be Wizzi, Mirri, Lamiy, Scuti and TurciProbably Finnic tribes living in present-day northwestern Russia. Wizzi is usually regarded as Veps and Mirri as Merya. up until the border of Russia (Ruzziam).\\" (IV 14) :\\"Furthermore we have been told that there are many islands in that sea, one of which is called the Great Estland (Aestland) -- And this island is told to be quite close to the Woman Land (terrae feminarum), which is not far away from Birca of the Swedes.\\" (IV 17) :\\"In this sea there are many other islands, all full of savage barbarians, and that is why navigators avoid them. It is also told that there are Amazons on the coasts of Baltic Sea, which is the reason that they are called Woman Land (terra feminarum).\\" (IV 19) There is also \\"scholia 119\\" that is marked as an amendment to IV 19. The scholias are not written by Adam himself, but by later copyists. :\\"When Emund, the King of the Swedes (Sueones), had sent his son Anund to enlarge his powers, he arrived by sea to Woman Land (terram feminarum). The women immediately mixed poison to spring water and this way killed the king and his army. We have mentioned this earlier, and bishop Adalvard himself has assured us that this and the rest as well are true.\\" Source of Adam's information Adam had spent some time at the court of the Danish king Svend Estridson where he may have gathered information on northern people and events from various persons and now lost documents. Adam's information on Woman Land probably originated from a German bishop Adalvard the Younger (as hinted by IV 19's amendment scholia 119) who had been a bishop in Skara and spent time in Norway in the court of king Harald H√•rdr√•de, most probably in the then-capital Trondheim. This would also explain Adam's detailed knowledge about certain parts of Norway, since he mentions Trondheim (Trondemnis) several times (Gesta III 59, IV 16, 32, 33, 34) and even H√•logaland (Halagland) from northern Norway (IV 37). Sami people (Scritefinnis, Scritefingi) are also mentioned several times (IV 24, 25, 31) and usually at the same time when he discusses Norwegians. Woman Land and the Sami people are discussed altogether separately in Gesta. Background of the name The text gives no apparent reason for the name in its literal meaning. Adam and his colleagues themselves seem to have thought the name to derive from the legendary Amazons taken from classical Greek mythology. This is clearly said in the text itself to be their own thinking, even though Adam later in his publication seems to forget that and presents it as a common rumor originating from bishop Adalvard. Location of Woman Land The location of Woman Land is not given in exact terms, and several possible locations lie \\"quite close\\" to Estonia, reachable \\"by sea\\" from Sweden and also \\"not far\\" from Birka, and thus fall within Adam's loose words, with one of the possible locations being the small Estonian island of Naissaar, whose name means \\"women's island\\". Naissaar ‚Äî Nargen, Narg√∂, Terra Feminarum: Nature and nature conservation. Estonian Ministry of Environment, 1997. Historical consequences According to Gesta, Anund was the son of King Emund the Old who ruled Sweden 1050-60 AD. Anund's death in Woman Land led into a long-lasting internal chaos in Sweden, as Emund died without an heir apparent and so did the House of Muns√∂, the last branch of the Yngling family.

Starring Nick Blake and local New Zealand children, The Killian Curse tells the 21 stories of the students from Room 21, who must each face an evil curse placed on them by the sinister Charles Killian. Killian wants to get revenge on the people who caused his death shortly after founding the school in 1906. He needs to capture eleven souls to rise from the dead. There are two series which first aired in 2006 and 2008. Premise 1906 Room 21 Students The original students of Room 21 are caught doing a ritual led by Killian. The parents banished him, but a fire broke out during a struggle which eventually burned the interior of the classroom, killing Killian in the process. Before dying, he swore to get revenge by stealing the eleven souls needed to return from the dead. Killian also said that parents would be blind to the suffering of their children. It is only the other classmates of Room 21 who can see what is happening. One of the kids from present day Room 21 (and narrator of the events of 1906) happens to be the great, great grandson of the man directly responsible for Killian's death. The great, great grandfather and the others in the room at the time of Killian's death are presumed to be ancestors of the current kids in room 21. Shortly after, the room is sealed \\"forever\\", forever lasting until 2006, when the story begins. Some people who have watched it have been paranoid by the number 21 and have been seeing it quite a lot of times. 2006 Room 21 Students After 100 years, Room 21 is unsealed by a principal who does not believe in curses and it is up to the school janitor to tell the students about the curse.

They all split up and trap the wolf, but it was not after Owen. It was after Miles, who was not helping and was back at the camp. They ran back to the camp to find him tied up and his soul taken by the werewolf's wife. Billie showed everyone Karen's hand that had the rope burn because she pulled the rope too tightly when she was fixing her tent at the beginning if the episode. The traitor actually tied him up. \\"21\\" was shown on Johnny's digital watch. Shane ‚Äì His curse was a computer virus that affected him in the form of living mucus while he was home sick. He defeats it after he clicks 'Destroy virus' on his computer. The traitor is there, trying not to help Shane. \\"21\\" was found on the chat screen. Karen ‚Äì Continuing from Miles' 2nd curse, her possessed hand forces her to do bad things like hitting other students and destroying a gift from a sister school. She defeats it by pulling it off with a wood vice and dodging it so it flew out the window into a box of charity toys. The traitor locks her in a room but she manages to escape. \\"21\\" appeared when it was written on a piece of paper by Karen's possessed hand. =Shrinking/Game/Past= Johnny ‚Äì His curse is shrinking that at first attributes to his losing weight.

Elizabeth ‚Äì Her curse was a kendo video game. She and Karl attempted to play but Karl is quickly knocked unconscious, she defeated the oni that was sent after her. In the end, the Traitor attempts to take her soul but fails and retreats. Te Aroha ‚Äì Her curse was when she went back in time into the past years of Killian High. She met a spirit that warned her about three 19th- century bullies that Killian had sent. The bullies chased her onto a train where Killian asked her for her ticket, then the train pulled her into the world of lost souls where she saw Jack. The number 21 appeared when TP went past the number on a wall in graffiti. =Necromancer/Voodoo/Immunity= Lucy ‚Äì Her demon was a medium who was possessed by a necromancer and attacked most of the girls at the library then the demon went to Lucy's house. Karen tried to warn her but it was too late. The girls had set a seance near section \\"012-021\\" in the library. Will ‚Äì He brought back the voodoo doll from his last curse (when Karen made the voodoo doll of Keith but it ended up affecting Will) because he did not believe it was safe with the Traitor around and knew it still worked. The traitor took the doll, and pulled Will's legs and arm off and put them in the school furnace. Karen managed to save the doll and sew his arms and legs back on. \\"21\\" was found on top of The Anti-Killian Meeting door. David ‚Äì His curse was on Killian's Island (a nod to Survivor). He is tripped over during the chase for immunity and all the boys blamed him to be the traitor. They voted him out and Killian took his soul. The \\"credits\\" for Killian's Island read \\"Room 21\\". =Time/Dolls/Magic= Haley ‚Äì Her curse is when a time demon that can stop time with a clock that can go back or forward to any time by changing the time on it. Haley defeats the demon by snatching the clock from it and turning the time backwards to the time Haley found out about her curse and smashing it. The demon accidentally reveals that the Traitor is a girl. The number 21 was found on an encyclopedia in the library. Charlotte ‚Äì Her curse is when her china dolls come to life. First she takes a china doll off a girl and takes it home. The doll starts her curse. She tries to defeat them by smashing them but they shrink her. She wakes up as a doll herself, and another doll pulls her into the house and takes her soul. The number 21 was found on one of Charlotte's rulers. Karl ‚Äì His curse was at Shane's house on his birthday when the magician made Karl disappear. He then was taken to a different stage and was forced to perform the art of escapology. He was lifted into the air and dangled above a chainsaw while tied in chains. He had 30 seconds to escape but failed and had his soul removed. The number 21 appeared when the magician changed the track on the CD player to track 21. =Dead Man/Movies/Drawing= Owen ‚Äì His curse was a dead man under Killian's command, who tries to take his soul during his work experience at a funeral parlor. The dead man nails him into a coffin and tries to put him into a cremation furnace, but he gets his chain and loops it over a bolt on the conveyor. The traitor, however, takes it off, so Owen bangs his coffin off the conveyor, opening it again and defeating his curse. The number 21 was mentioned when he read that the man had died on 21 February 2007. Tabetha ‚Äì Her curse was when she was sent into a movie by Killian and had to fight her way past a Hookman-themed demon in a stereotypical horror movie plot. She ran away from the demon into the basement. The demon started to fire shots at her and eventually hit the main circuit board allowing Tabetha to escape and defeat the curse. The number 21 appeared when she sat in seat number 21. Katie and Keith ‚Äì Her curse was when she draws a demon taking Keith's soul. The next day it comes true and her classmates get suspicious. When a two-dimensional comic demon started attacking her and gives the headmaster a heart attack, she realises she can control the demon by drawing in her book. Katie then had to shrink the demon, step on him, and burn him alive. 21 was mentioned when Katie's pens rolled together to make 2 and 1. =Reflection Demon= Billie ‚Äì Billie was the last student to have to face her demon. Hers was a reflection demon that affected the real world. She confronted it in a school bathroom and it tried to take her soul. The rest of the class helped her get away. The traitor is then revealed to be Jen, who was possessed during the first episode. Then everyone whose soul was never taken went through the portal to Killian's world. After that Killian locked them with a Latin Spell and try to take their souls instead of the others, who had escaped, but eventually he disappeared when a giant rabbit (from Karl's curse) pulled him down when he was rising to go to earth and fought him. After they all looked up at the portal as it closed. They were stuck in Killian's world. *Chelsea did not get a curse because she went to live with Billie's family while Billie stayed with her family. =The Traitor= In the new year at Killian High, Killian warned the Room 21 students that there was a traitor among them. Since there was a new girl Billie, everyone thought it was her. Afterwards the traitor lets go of Byron but said he let go, shone a torch in Celia and Jack's eyes, took Will's Voodoo doll, tripped David over as he was running away from demons on Killian's Island, tried to stop Elizabeth exiting her cursed kendo game, ties up Miles, pushes Johnny off the desk when he shrunk, stealing Elizabeth's phone and then pretending to be Elizabeth before telling Te Aroha to go to the train station, takes off a chain to put Owen through a crematorium, locks the door when Karen is given her \\"punishment\\", locks the door of the bathroom and pushes Billie in through the mirror. Most people in Room 21 are accused of being the traitor, including Karen (because of the rope burn on her hand), Katie (because of her drawing made Keith lose his soul), Tabetha (calling Owen making the dead man find his hiding spot) and David (because he was thought to have taken Will's Voodoo doll) just to name a few. But Billie is normally the one who get the blame for the traitor's actions. If one was to watch closely you can tell it is not her for a number of reasons. *The Traitor always wears a jumper (or something that hides their face), and Billie does not wear a jumper until the last two episodes. *The Traitor drops a scarf in Elizabeth's curse, there is no evidence that Billie owns a scarf (All the kids in the first series wore scarfs). *In Miles' curse, someone is seen running away from the group during their chase in the woods. Their hair is blonde, but it is not curly (like Billie's) and it is plaited. In that situation only Jen and Karen's hair was plaited. *The Traitor has grey socks and proper school shoes (as seen in Will's curse). Billie wears white socks and ballet flats with her uniform until the last two episodes. *Billie's skirt is shorter than the other kids' skirts and shorts. In Will's curse one can see the back of the traitor. Their skirt/shorts are down to just above the knee. In the final episode the traitor was revealed to be Jen, although she was being controlled by a demon (that possessed her on the first episode, when she disappeared while with Byron) who would take her soul for themself instead of Killian having it. In the end when they defeated Killian with the demon from Karl's curse, the Rabbit, the whole of Room 21 was stuck in Killian's world even though he was defeated. It still looked as if they had their souls taken out as they could not get out as the portal closed. It looks like 10 of the 11 students of Room 21 will never get out. Home release The DVD release of The Killian Curse was due to have been around a week after the final episode was broadcast, but was delayed for unknown reasons. It was eventually released on 14 December 2006. The DVD differs from the broadcast version, as it is shown in 16:9 widescreen whereas free-to-air New Zealand television (as well as some of the pay TV channels) still broadcast in standard 4:3 format. There is currently no DVD of the second series.

In 1995, she released her first self-composed album Kamie≈Ñ and established herself as one of the most successful Polish singers with the subsequent releases of Zebra (1997) and Kayah i Bregoviƒá (1999). In the early 2000s, Kayah founded her own label, Kayax, which has signed many successful artists and released numerous critically acclaimed albums. She has sold more than one million copies of her records so far and remains one of the most awarded artists by the Polish music industry.  Career  Kayah was born in Warsaw, but grew up in Bia≈Çystok. Her father is Jewish. At the start of her career, Kayah sang in choirs and recorded backing vocals for a number of bands, such as Tilt. She made her solo debut with the song \\"C√≥reczko\\" (Little Daughter) in 1988 at the National Festival of Polish Song in Opole. The same year, her first full-length eponymous album was released. It was a commercial and artistic disappointment and today is not included in Kayah official discography. She released her first self-produced solo album, Kamie≈Ñ (Stone), in 1995. It was a great success, consisting of melancholy pop songs, deriving from soul and jazz traditions. In the same year, she was voted the Vocalist of the Year by the Polish music industry and received a Fryderyk award in recognition of her achievements. In 1997, she received another three Fryderyks, this time for the album Zebra as well as in the categories of Singer and Composer of the Year. With Zebra she changed her style, moving in the direction of American soul/funk music. The album spawned two hits, \\"Na jƒôzykach\\" (Tongues wagging) and \\"Supermenka\\" (Superwoman). In 1999, Kayah paired with the Yugoslav composer Goran Bregoviƒá to record what would become one of the most popular Polish albums ever, entitled Kayah i Bregoviƒá. Most of the music was composed by Bregoviƒá for the band Bijelo Dugme (White Button), which he had been a part of, and for movie soundtracks that he had worked on. The lyrics were both translations of and inspired by the original texts. The first two singles released from the album, \\"≈öpij kochanie, ≈õpij\\" (Sleep, my love, sleep) and \\"Prawy do lewego\\" (From right to left), became massive hits in Poland for many months and the record went on to sell in excess of 700,000 copies. In the same year Kayah was awarded another Fryderyk, in the category Vocalist of the Year. In 2000, she released the album Jaka ja Kayah (Kayah, like me) which featured pop, jazz and techno-influenced songs. She paired with Ces√°ria √âvora for a track \\"Embarcacao\\", sung in Crioulo, from the re-release of the album, newly entitled YakaYaKayah. Her next album, Stereo typ, was issued in August 2003 and featured a major hit single, \\"Testosteron\\". The record was nominated for 7 Fryderyk awards and in the autumn Kayah embarked on her Stereo Tour to promote the new album. 2005 saw the release of her first compilation, The Best & the Rest, a 2-disc set featuring all her greatest single hits as well as less popular tracks. It was promoted with two singles: \\"Pr√≥cz ciebie, nic\\" (Without you, nothing), recorded with Krzysztof Kilja≈Ñski, and \\"Jutro rano\\" (Tomorrow morning). Kayah then shifted focus to production and released a number of successful, critically acclaimed albums on her own label Kayax. In 2006 she released her first live album, MTV Unplugged. The following years saw her working on various soundtrack melodies. Kayah returned with her first studio album in six years in 2009. Ska≈Ça (Rock), musically similar to her 1995 debut album, became a bestseller in Poland. 2010 saw the release of two collaboration albums: Kayah & Royal Quartet with the Royal String Quartet, consisting of some of her previous songs in string arrangements, and Panienki z temperamentem (Ladies with attitude), on which Kayah and Polish singer Renata Przemyk presented their own interpretations of works by Kabaret Starszych Pan√≥w. In 2011, Kayah had a major commercial hit with her single \\"Za p√≥≈∫no\\" (Too late) and took part in the TV show The Voice of Poland as a member of the judging panel. In 2013, she released an album Transoriental Orchestra which was an exploration of Jewish music.

Previously known as Kallang River Reservoir or Peirce Reservoir, it was renamed Lower Peirce Reservoir after the creation of Upper Peirce Reservoir. It has a surface area of 6 hectares and the surrounding forest contains many trees that are over 100 years old. There is a Lower Peirce Trail, which is a 900-metre boardwalk that takes visitors through a mature secondary forest. The reservoir is the source of the Kallang River, the longest river in Singapore. History Originally known as the Kallang River Reservoir, Singapore's second reservoir was impounded across the lower reaches of the Kallang River in 1910. In 1922, it was renamed Peirce Reservoir in commendation of the services of Robert Peirce (engineer), who was the municipal engineer of Singapore from 1901 to 1916. In 1975, a major water supply project to develop new water resources was undertaken to support Singapore's rapid housing and industrialisation programmes. A dam was constructed at the upper reaches of the Peirce Reservoir, forming the Upper and Lower Peirce Reservoirs. Upper Peirce Reservoir was officially opened by then Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew on 27 February 1977.

He started his career articled to the late Mr. R. Vawser, M. Inst. C.E., of Manchester but spent several years in Birmingham, where he was engaged as resident engineer for the corporation working on the construction of cable tramways. Before arriving in Penang, Peirce was employed as assistant to Pritchard & Co., civil engineers, of London and Birminghamhttps://www.newspapers.com/newspage/35662095/ In Penang, Peirce was responsible for the design of the Queen Victoria clock after winning a design competition; Jalan Peirce is named after him.

He went so far as to raise the question as to whether the Municipal engineering staff (Peirce and his deputy Williams) may have colluded with the contractor to use sub-standard clay which resulted in leakage in the dam. There was extensive newspaper coverage over 3 days in April 1923 and discussion in the Municipal Commission. From his retirement, Peirce wrote a lengthy letter to defend the work. This is an interesting example of the open debate and discussion that occurred in the Municipal Commission and its willingness to use full media disclosure to address allegations of corruption.http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/straitstimes19230417-1.2.79.aspx Peirce died in 1933 in Gibraltar.

He survived the war, but died in 1920 while combating communist revolutionaries. Early career B√ºchner was born in Leipzig in the Kingdom of Saxony, the son of a businessman. He volunteered for the army in September 1914, aged 16. He served in the Royal Saxon 7th Infantry Regiment Nr. 106 (Kgl. S√§chsisches 7. Infanterie-Regiment K√∂nig Georg Nr. 106). After surviving a case of typhoid fever, he fought on both the Eastern and Western fronts. He was subsequently commissioned in 1916 shortly after his 18th birthday. He was wounded in combat in France on 3 April 1916. After his recovery, he transferred to the German Army Air Service, or Luftstreitkr√§fte, and was assigned as an observation pilot with FFA 270. Service as fighter pilot In March 1917 B√ºchner became a fighter pilot, joining the Prussian Jagdstaffel 9 where he scored his first and only victory with them, on 17 August. Upon his transfer to Jagdstaffel 13, he found his niche under Rudolph Berthold, one of Germany's most dedicated soldiers. However, it was several months before he scored again, on 15 October. With the introduction of the Fokker D.VII in 1918, B√ºchner came into his own; he flew at least three different machines during his career, scoring three victories in June and becoming Commanding Officer of the Jasta on 15 June. It was after his fifth victory that he landed and announced to his squadron colleagues that he had now learned how to win in aerial combat. It was a prescient statement. On 2 July, he shot down and killed \\"The Mad Major\\", Irish 5-victory ace Major Joseph Callaghan, CO of No. 87 Squadron, who was flying a Sopwith Dolphin in a solo attack on Jasta 13. Five days later, he followed up with Canadian ace Lieutenant Merrill Taylor (7 victories), killed in a Sopwith Camel of No. 209 Squadron. A Fokker D VII such as that which B√ºchner flew On 29 July 1918 B√ºchner shot an American Sopwith Camel down in flames with just 14 rounds. His wingman, Leutnant Werner Niethammer, cited this combat as an illustration of B√ºchner's skill as a marksman; according to Niethammer's account, B√ºchner had no sooner spotted the American than he had set the enemy aircraft on fire. This would be the last of his seven victories in July. On 10 August, B√ºchner's career nearly ended. While attacking and shooting down a two seater in bad flying weather, his plane's fuel tank was hit. Drenched in gasoline, he landed in no man's land and tagged along with two retreating German machine gunners. The incident does not seem to have slowed him down. It was the second of his eight victories in August. In September B√ºchner scored 17 victories, the top scoring German fighter pilot for the month. Above the Lines, Shores, page 239 On 10 October, B√ºchner survived a mid-air collision with fellow Jasta pilot Michaelis; both of them parachuted to safety. He brought his tally to 40 victories by 22 October 1918. Three days later he was awarded the Pour le M√©rite on 25 October 1918, one of the last awards before the Kaiser's abdication. Having downed 38 of his 40 victories in the Fokker D.VII, in a span of five months, he's the most successful pilot in the type. Post war service In the turbulent postwar period the 22-year-old B√ºchner flew against communist revolutionaries but was shot down and killed by members of the Spartacus League during a reconnaissance flight near his hometown of Leipzig on March 18, 1920, three days after Rudolf Berthold was murdered in Harburg.Above the Lines, Shores, page 86. Decorations and awards Besides the Pour le M√©rite, Prussia's highest military honor, B√ºchner also received the highest military honor of his home state, Saxony's Military Order of St. Henry (Milit√§r-St. Heinrichs- Orden), on October 7, 1918. B√ºchner's other decorations include the Prussian Iron Cross 1st and 2nd Class, the Knight's Cross with Swords of Prussia's Royal House Order of Hohenzollern, the Knight's Cross with Swords of Saxony's Merit Order, and the Knight's Cross with Swords of Saxony's Albert Order.

He began boxing at the age of 10 and soon came to be noticed by the local trainers, becoming an amateur boxer in the cruiser-weight division at the age of 17. He won various local championships and became vice-champion of France. He then came to be noticed by scouts for the French national team. Amateur career In 1990, his first international tournament in Medan, Indonesia, he was the gold medallist. When he returned home, he joined the Battalion of Joinville, E.I.S. (National Army School for Sports) reserved for the French sports elite. This year he also became the Heavyweight Champion of France. In 1991 he joined the National Institute for the Study of Sports and Physical Fitness (INSEP). There he studied for 5 years while representing France at various international meetings and tournaments collecting various medals and awards. At Almeria, Spain, he beat German Kraulenko and loses a decision to ≈Ωeljko Mavroviƒá (Croatia). The following month, a tournament takes place at Boulogne sur Mer. Christophe beats Raymond Meygerse (Germany) and Igor Andreev (Russia) to gain the silver medal. He loses a decision in the final bout to Arnold Vanderlijde (Holland). In Athens, Greece, at the Mediterranean Games of 1991, Christophe again faces ≈Ωeljko Mavroviƒá and loses in a decision. In Ankara, Turkey, he boxes Rebua and Georgi Kandelaki (Geo.) and wins Gold. The day after the final of the 1992 championship, he leaves for Halle, Germany, to take part in the qualifying tournament for the 1992 Olympic Games in Barcelona. This time, he will finish fourth and will not go to Barcelona. Disappointed, he leaves the French team and returns Home to Normandy. After a few months of reflection and soul searching, he joins the ranks of the Semi- professionals and wins two contests. In 1993, the French national team asked Christophe to rejoin to take part in several important competitions. In the Super Heavyweight division, he wins a bout against American, Allan Cromp, in Marseilles. In the Mediterranean Games of 1993 in B√©ziers, France Christophe won the Gold Medal in the Super Heavyweight category by beating Egyptian, Ahmed El Sayed and the Italian, Paolo Vidoz. In February 1994 Djakarta, Indonesia was the location of a qualifying bout for the 1996 Olympic Games. Christophe meets an Australian fighter, the famous Ukrainian Champ Vitali Klitschko and in the finals, the Pakistani Safarash Khan. Christophe won Gold. The following month, a tournament takes place in Venice, Italy. He is, again, the gold medallist of the super heavyweight class. Then, at the 1994 World Cup of Boxing, in Bangkok, Thailand, he fights the Cuban, Roberto Balado, the number One Super Heavyweight. In spite of a beautiful and dominating effort by Christophe, the Cuban wins on points. Subsequently, Christophe requested the national team return him to the Heavyweight class. He then meets the 1993 French title holder and finally wins the Heavyweight title. France was invited to take part in the 1994 Goodwill Games in St Petersburg, Russia. The first bout pitted Christophe against Cuban, F√©lix Sav√≥n. After a beautiful and well executed fight, the Cuban is declared victorious by a slim two point advantage. F√©lix Sav√≥n, during a TV interview (TV5), would go on to say that Christophe is the only boxer able to beat him. In 1995, Christophe Mendy is elected third best heavyweight boxer in the world by the A.I.B.A (International Association of Amateur Boxing). =Highlights= French National Championships (Heavyweight), Berck-sur-Mer, France, 1990: *1/8: Defeated Marc Alberola RSC 1 *1/4: Defeated Lezin Houessou PTS *1/2: Defeated Patrice Akam PTS *Finals: Defeated Jean-Michel Vauquelin PTS French National Championships (Heavyweight), Sedan, France, 1991: *1/8: Defeated Bruno Choppin RSC 2 *1/4: Defeated Dominique Delord PTS *1/2: Defeated Jean-Michel Vauquelin KO 1 *Finals: Defeated Roberto Leneuve PTS Tournoi France (Heavyweight), Boulogne, France, 1991: *1/4: Defeated Raymond Meygerse (Germany) PTS *1/2: Defeated Igor Andreyev (Russia) PTS *Finals: Lost to Arnold Vanderlijde (Netherlands) PTS Chemistry Cup (Heavyweight), Halle, Germany, 1992: *1/16: Lost to Kai Brannkarr (Finland) 7‚Äì21 French National Championships (Heavyweight), Li√©vin, France, 1992: *1/4: Defeated Said Bechari PTS *1/2: Defeated Stephane Allouane PTS *Finals: Defeated Carlos Guerreiro PTS Trofeo Italia (Heavyweight), Mestre, Italy, 1993: *Finals: Lost to Roland Raforme (Seychelles) by walkover European Championships (Super Heavyweight), Bursa, Turkey, 1993: *1/8: Lost to Gytis Ju≈°keviƒçius (Lithuania) 9‚Äì15 Mediterranean Games (Super Heavyweight), Narbonne, France, 1993: *1/2: Defeated Paolo Vidoz (Italy) KO 2 *Finals: Defeated Said Ahmed el-Sayed (Egypt) 6‚Äì0 President's Cup (Super Heavyweight) Jakarta, Indonesia, February 1994: *1/2: Defeated Vitali Klitschko (Ukraine) PTS *Finals: Defeated Safarish Khan (Pakistan) French National Championships (Super Heavyweight), Saint-Lo, France, 1994: *1/2: Defeated Norbert Ollhoff RSC 1 *Finals: Defeated Claude Bevis RSC 3 World Cup (Super Heavyweight), Bangkok, Thailand, 1994: *1/8: Lost to Roberto Balado (Cuba) 4‚Äì24 Trofeo Italia (Heavyweight), Mestre, Italy, 1994: *1/4: Defeated Lamon Brewster (United States) PTS *1/2: Defeated Roland Raforme (Seychelles) RSCI 3 *Finals: Defeated Erik Fuhrmann (Germany) 6‚Äì2 Goodwill Games (Heavyweight), Saint Petersburg, Russia, 1994: *1/4: Lost to F√©lix Sav√≥n (Cuba) 6‚Äì8 Copenhagen Cup (Heavyweight), Copenhagen, Denmark, 1994: *1/4: Defeated Sergey Mochalov (Russia) RSC 3 *1/2: Defeated Anders Elkj√¶r (Denmark) 17‚Äì5 *Finals: Defeated Dmitriy Lenkov (Belarus) by walkover Giraldo Cordova Cardin Tournament (Heavyweight), Matanzas, Cuba, 1995: *1/4: Defeated Alexis Echevarria (Cuba) RSC 1 *1/2: Lost to F√©lix Sav√≥n (Cuba) by walkover Trofeo Italia (Heavyweight), Mestre, Italy, 1995: *Finals: Defeated Jonas Dambrauskas (Lithuania) RET 3 USA‚ÄìFrance Duals (Heavyweight), Atlanta, Georgia, 1995: * Defeated Duwan Blanch (United States) PTS World Championships (Heavyweight), Berlin, Germany, 1995: *1/8: Defeated Tao Jiang (China) 16‚Äì5 *1/4: Defeated Wojciech Bartnik (Poland) 7‚Äì2 *1/2: Lost to F√©lix Sav√≥n (Cuba) 6‚Äì9 Vaclav Prochazka Tournament (Heavyweight), Ostrava, Czech Republic, October 1995: *Finals: Lost to Jan Bezvoda (Czech Republic) 6‚Äì8 Strandzha Cup (Heavyweight), Sofia, Bulgaria, 1996: *1/4: Defeated Tamer Erolov (Bulgaria) 6‚Äì1 *1/2: Defeated Georgi Kandelaki (Georgia) RET 2 *Finals: Lost to F√©lix Sav√≥n (Cuba) by walkover European Championships (Heavyweight) Vejle, Denmark, 1996: *1/16: Defeated Tamer Erolov (Bulgaria) 7‚Äì4 *1/8: Defeated Cathal O'Grady (Ireland) 10‚Äì6 *1/4: Defeated Georgi Kandelaki (Georgia) 7‚Äì2 *1/2: Defeated Kwamena Turkson (Sweden) 7‚Äì2 *Finals: Lost to Luan Krasniqi (Germany) 7‚Äì8 Summer Olympics (Heavyweight), Atlanta, Georgia, 1996: *1/8: Defeated Ovidiu Bali (Romania) RSCH 2 *1/4: Lost to David Defiagbon (Canada) DQ 3 Mendy finished his amateur career with 88 fights under his belt, 73 wins (31 KOs), 14 losses, 1 draw. While in amateurs, he was defeated four times by Cuban boxing legend F√©lix Sav√≥n. Cubans happened to be the toughest opponents for Mendy (he lost 5 out of 6 match-ups against Cubans.) Professional career Although Mendy fought professionally once in 1993 while classified as an amateur, he officially launched his pro career in 1995. He had limited success as a pro, and retired in 2000 after having won 14 (9 KOs,) lost 4 with 2 KO-losses, and 1 draw.

Originally owned by two iron companies, the railroad later became part of the Reading system, and parts of it remain in operation today. Origins From its founding in 1839 until the 1890s under the auspices of the Lehigh Coal & Navigation Company, the Lehigh Crane Iron Company -- the first enterprise in North America to successfully achieve anthracite charged iron smelting using the newly patented Scottish hot blast technology to produce a new, plentiful and inexpensive (even revolutionary) product anthracite iron -- obtained much of its ore supply from limonite deposits in southern Lehigh County. The ore had to be hauled over rural roads and across Biery's Bridge to reach the company's budding furnace and casting complex at Biery's Port (renamed Catasauqua in 1854), which early on, would have eight of the first ten successful blast furnaces producing anthracite iron in the Lehigh Valley. The wagons used to carry the heavy ore did great damage to the roads, and as the furnaces expanded, the deficiencies of this method of transportation became clear. The first successful anthracite blow and cast of iron occurred there on July, 4th 1840 about which Bartholomew & Metz note: The initial application to the Pennsylvania General Assembly for a railroad charter, around 1853, was met with fierce resistance by local farmers, who feared that trains would frighten livestock, set fires, and destroy the local farming districts. The iron company was forced to compromise and charter the Catasauqua and Fogelsville Plank Road on July 2, 1853. While plank roads were a popular improvement in transportation at the time, the short stretch that was constructed was found wholly inadequate for the haulage of ore. The heavily-loaded wagons rapidly damaged the road and rendered it dangerous for travel. The Crane Iron Company persevered, and on April 20, 1854, the plank road was issued a modified charter to operate as the Catasauqua and Fogelsville Railroad. The newly chartered Thomas Iron Company partnered with Crane in support of the railroad in March 1856, and construction began shortly thereafter. Crane Iron owned 60% of the railroad stock, and Thomas Iron 40%. Route The eastern terminus of the line was in West Catasauqua. Here, it connected with the private railroad of the Thomas Iron Company, which ran a short distance north to its furnaces at Hokendauqua, and that of Crane Iron, which crossed the Lehigh River to that company's furnaces at Catasauqua. It also connected with the Lehigh Valley Railroad, newly completed through the area. It ran westward through Whitehall Township, with stations at Mickleys and Seiple. It then turned southwestward to enter South Whitehall Township. The line crossed a high bridge over Jordan Creek to reach Guth's Station (later Guth), where there was a short spur to a local limestone quarry and ore pits. Leaving Guth, the railroad turned west, then south to climb across the shoulder of Huckleberry Ridge and reach Wulbert's Station (later Walbert), then ran southwestward into Upper Macungie Township. At Chapman's Station (named for Charles W. Chapman, superintendent of the railroad), it turned south again to reach Rupp's Station, a short distance southward. This was the extent of the first stage of the line, opened on July 14, 1857. Fogelsville was never directly reached by the line, but lay about west of Rupp's Station. The desire of the Thomas Iron Company to build a furnace in the southern part of the county resulted in a further extension in 1864. Construction continued southward from Rupp's Station, through Crane Station (named for the iron company) and Trexlertown. Entering Lower Macungie Township, the Catasauqua & Foglesville made a connection with the East Pennsylvania Railroad, completed 1859, at Alburtis. It crossed over the East Penn and passed alongside the proposed furnace site, just south of Alburtis at Lock Ridge. In 1865, the line was extended south, across Swabia Creek and into the mountains. Climbing southeast and then running southwest along the side of the ridge, the line entered Longswamp Township, Berks County. It entered Red Lion from the northeast and passed on to Rittenhouse Gap and the Thomas Iron Company's magnetite mines there. A turntable was built at the end of the line. In 1868, the furnaces at Lock Ridge went into operation, shipping and receiving over both the Catasauqua & Fogelsville and the East Penn. In addition to coal, ore and lime traffic, the railroad also operated passenger service from Alburtis to West Catasauqua, which would continue until September 29, 1935. Ore spurs and wharves The railroad could not run a spur to every mine site, and a number of \\"ore wharves\\" were constructed along the right-of-way. At the wharves, ore could be dumped from wagons into piles, and later transferred to railcars to be shipped to the furnaces. Important mines did, however, warrant the expense of constructing branch lines, authorized by a charter supplement of April 8, 1861. The longest of these left the main line at Trexlertown, and ran as far as Breinigsville on the unfinished Allentown Railroad right-of-way. There it diverged, and continued to Farmington, the site of a large ore wharf, and ended at the ore pits in the vicinity of Klines Corner. A shorter branch, originating at Crane, ran west and then turned sharply north to end at the Wallner iron mine near Haafsville. Finally, a switchback was built from the main line between Red Lion and Rittenhouse Gap in the late 1880s, which served the hematite mines near Seisholtzville. Another charter amendment of May 26, 1863, allowing the railroad to extend to Bath (northeast of Catasauqua and terminus of the Bangor and Portland Railroad) was never utilized. Reading control Most of the stock of the Catasauqua & Fogelsville was bought by the Reading in 1890, as iron ore from the Mesabi Range began to put pressure on local iron mining operations. It was leased to the Reading on December 8, 1893. Between 1916 and 1919, furnace slag was dumped under the Jordan Creek high bridge so that it could be replaced by a fill and culvert. Iron ore traffic continued to decline, and the local mines had all been shut down by the end of World War I. The mine branches remained in place, derelict, until the 1940s, when the three spurs and the main line south of Lock Ridge were abandoned. The Catasauqua and Fogelsville was formally mergedNew York Times, \\"Rail Merger Authorized\\" into the Reading on August 10, 1944, probably to simplify the corporate structure of that railroad and to save on taxes, as with a series of other mergers the next year.New York Times, \\"Reading Mergers Voted\\" Post-merger The line from Alburtis to the now-derelict furnaces at Lock Ridge remained in place to haul furnace slag until 1959, when it was abandoned. Otherwise, the line remained largely intact until after passing to Conrail. The connection in West Catasauqua with the Lehigh and New England Railroad (formerly the Crane Iron Company tracks) had been abandoned in 1961. Anticipating the abandonment of the former Lehigh Valley main line in February 1982, leaving only the moribund Ironton Railroad connection, the line east of Seiple was abandoned on December 21, 1981. The remainder survived the breakup of Conrail to become the Norfolk Southern C&F; Secondary. It is operated as a branch line from Alburtis, serving a number of industrial customers in the Chapman area. Field Survey from March 2010 shows almost all of the line from Alburtis to Rittenhouse Gap and Seisholtsville still easy to follow. Most posted \\"private property\\", but very evident and easy to trace with the help of Google Maps.

The division was first deployed to Gallipoli during World War I, the sent to the Middle East, and finally moved to the Western Front in March 1918. In 1921 it reformed in the Territorial Army (T.A.). Mobilised in 1939 for the Second World War it was deployed to France with the British Expeditionary Force, and was evacuated along with rest of the army from Dunkirk It was then trained in Britain as both an airlanding and a mountain division. However, it was deployed to mainland Europe finally in November 1944 as a conventional infantry formation and fought in North-Western Europe for the remainder of the war. The Territorial Army was reformed in 1947 and re-raised the 51st/52nd Scottish Division which was in existence until the T.A. was disbanded and reorganised as the TAVR in 1967. In 1968 the Division was split into two brigade level districts based in the Highlands and Lowlands, with the Lowland District Headquarters in Hamilton, near Glasgow. Latest formation The Brigade was reformed in 1982 from that Lowland District, as the 52nd (Lowland) Brigade. As the 52nd Lowland Brigade it consisted of the 1st and 2nd Battalions of the 52nd Lowland Volunteers, as well as other TA units in the Scottish Lowlands. The Brigade was retitled 52 Infantry Brigade on 1 April 2002, taking command of Regular Army units in Scotland and the North West of England and giving up its regional and TA responsibilities to 51 Scottish Brigade. This freed 52 Brigade to parent regular light role battalions for operational deployments. 52 Infantry Brigade was transferred to 3rd (UK) Division on 1 April 2007. The Brigade was only used once operationally, for a deployment to Afghanistan in 2007/08.

They had moderate success throughout Europe and Asia in the early 1980s, during the heyday of the new wave of British heavy metal movement. History =Early years = The band was formed in December 1979 in Bristol, England, through an advertisement published in a local newspaper by Jeff Cox and Garry Pepperd looking for a drummer. The original line-up consisted of Garry Pepperd (guitar), Jeff Cox (bass, vocals) and Chris Lovell (drums). The same year they went straight into Sound Conception Studios to record their first demo, which was finished on 22 March 1980. The songs recorded on their first demo were \\"Feel the Heat\\", \\"Battle Cry\\" and \\"Piledriver\\". In April 1980, they put out another advertisement for a vocalist, to which Rob Reiss answered joining the band. In December 1980, the band went into another studio, Studio 34, and recorded another demo, which they later put together with the previous demo tracks. The band added now three new demo tracks to the previous ones. The new tracks were \\"Stormchild\\", \\"Ain't no Fantasy\\" and \\"War Machine\\". Now the completed work consisted of six songs on a demo track tape. The songs were \\"Stormchild\\" (Cox); \\"Ain't No Fantasy\\" (Pepperd); \\"War Machine\\" (Pepperd); \\"Battlecry\\" (Cox/Pepperd) \\"Feel The Heat\\" (Pepperd); and \\"Piledriver\\" (Cox/Pepperd). The demo was sold to the public through an ad in the music magazine Sounds, starting in February 1981. The band sold about 540 demos this way. The Sounds ad put Jaguar in contact with the Dutch fan and promoter Frits Gijsbertse, who arranged multiple gigs for the band in the Netherlands. The local metal magazine Aardschok often featured Jaguar in its pages and the magazine's owner, a man named 'Metal Mike', became later the band's promoter in that country. In 1980, Jaguar sent their demo also to a Battle of the Bands competition and eventually a letter came through saying: \\"Congratulations, you've made it through to the Bristol heats!\\" Their first performance at that contest was on 2 May 1981 and they arrived to the final. Jaguar got a good reaction from the judges and they came fourth. This result and their demo earned Jaguar the chance to contribute with the song \\"Stormchild\\" to the compilation album Heavy Metal Heroes, released by Heavy Metal Records. The same label released in the second week of November 1981 the single \\"Back Street Woman\\", which went sold out within two months of its initial pressing of 4,000 copies. = Signed with Neat Records = At the beginning of 1982, after an appearance at a Dutch rock festival with Raven, Jaguar were noticed by Raven's manager and also owner of the indie label Neat Records Dave Wood, who proposed to release the band's next single through his label. Jaguar signed the deal with Neat Records and replaced Reiss with Paul Merrell, former vocalist from the band Stormtrooper, just in time for the recording of the single \\"Axe Crazy\\", which was released later in 1982. After intensive touring, in June 1983 Jaguar released their debut album, Power Games, which was a success with its no-nonsense high-speed approach. = Signed with Roadrunner Records = Their follow-up album This Time was released in 1984 by Roadrunner Records and marked a change of musical direction for the band, towards a more melodic and AORish sound. At this time they were supported by Mot√∂rhead¬¥s management, but by the end of the year Jaguar disbanded as Roadrunner did not fulfil the contract deal with the band. = Jaguar reformation = After a revival of interest in the new wave of British heavy metal in Europe and Japan, and the successful re-release of their first album in those regions, Jaguar reformed in 1999, with the modified line-up of Pepperd, Jeff Cox, Nathan Cox on drums and the new vocalist Jamie Manton. An appearance at Wacken Open Air Festival took place the same year. The album Wake Me followed in 2000, after which Jeff Cox left the band to concentrate on solo material and family life. He was replaced by Darren Furze. The next album, Run Ragged, appeared in 2003. In 2007, the band released two live albums. The first release was a recording from a show the band performed in the Netherlands in 1982, which originally saw only a limited release. The second was the first of three planned releases covering early, unreleased recordings. Entitled Archive Alive Vol.1, it covered the period of the band's successful period, the birth of the band and their rise to NWOBHM prominence. Sleeve notes were written by the band's guitarist, Garry Pepperd, and the album cover included rare photographs. = Current activities = Jaguar released their latest album, Metal X, in 2014. It was their first new material since 2003's Run Ragged. Jaguar did their Swedish debut at the Sweden Rock Festival in the summer of 2014. In September 2014, Jaguar parted company with their previous vocalist Jamie Manton. In November the same year, the band released Metal X on GoldenCore Records/ZYX Music, mixed by Mike Exeter. In August 2015, the band found L-G Persson, from the Swedish heavy metal/power metal band The Storyteller and ex Steel Attack from G√§vle, Sweden, to replace Manton. Persson had left the band by November the same year. Jeff Cox has recently formed a new progressive metal band called This Raging Silence, which released Isotopes and Endoscopes in 2015.  Music style  Jaguar played faster and more aggressively than any other band during the early days of the NWOBHM movement and, according to the band's history, they are considered among the inventors of the speed metal and thrash metal subgenres.

He has been described as \\"the father of Appalachian literature\\". Life and career John Ehle was born in Asheville, North Carolina, the oldest of five children of Gladys (n√©e Starnes) and John Marsden Ehle, an insurance company division director. His paternal grandparents emigrated from Wales and England, respectively. He enlisted in the United States Army during World War II, serving as a rifleman with the 97th Infantry Division. Following his military service, he went on to study at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, receiving a Bachelor of Arts degree in Radio, Television, and Motion Pictures in 1949 and later a Master of Arts degree in Dramatic Arts (1953). He also served on the faculty of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill from 1951 to 1963. During his tenure at UNC-Chapel Hill, he wrote plays for the American Adventure series that played on NBC Radio and began writing his first novel. Ehle's first novel, Move Over Mountain, was published by Hodder & Stoughton of London in 1957. The following year, he returned with a biography The Survivor: The Story of Eddy Hukov. In 1964, Harper & Row published perhaps his most well-known book, The Land Breakers.http://www.lib.unc.edu/mss/inv/htm/04555.html The book is a fictional account set in the late 18th century that traces the story of the first white pioneers to settle in the Appalachian wilderness of the mountains of Western North Carolina. The Land Breakers, out of print for several decades, was republished in 2006 by Press 53, a small imprint in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. With The Land Breakers, he started a seven-part series of historical fiction about the Appalachian region. Two of his eleven novels, The Winter People and The Journey of August King, have been adapted as films. Among his six works of non-fiction is the 1965 book, The Free Men, which is a first-person chronicle of the desegregation struggle in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, at the height of the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s.

As an extension of Governor Sanford's focus on education, Ehle was instrumental in the founding of both the North Carolina School of the Arts, and the North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics, among the first such state-supported high schools for the gifted and talented in the United States. He was also responsible for the founding of the North Carolina Governor's School, the first summer program of its kind for gifted students in North Carolina.

This played in Souji having a sense that is meant for greatness that makes him initially appear arrogant but is very compassionate. He often seems to follow monk-like philosophies of peace, using the kanji in his full name to in his formal instruction: or quoting amazingly appropriate zen-like phrases he supposedly learned from his grandmother. Having no job or college education despite being very talented, Souji normally stays home with Juka before becoming a regular customer at Bistro La Salle after meeting Hiyori Kusakabe, whom he recognized as both the girl he saved and a Native Worm whom he considers his little sister. This played in his ability to recognize Worms in disguise merely fights for his own needs to wipe the aliens out and provoking ZECT as a result. After defeating the Worms and ZECT's corrupted higher ups, Souji leaves Japan to travel to France. As Kamen Rider Kabuto, he is usually in his pupa-like armored before using the Kabuto Zector's to assume the sleeker and more combat-oriented which uses the to travel at near-light speeds to match the speeds of the Worms or for Kabuto to execute his tachyon-powered . Both modes use sidearm, able to switch from its ion-beam firing to either or , and the , a modified Honda CBR1000RR able to change from to .

ZECT ZECT is a mysterious organization that seemingly acts in order to destroy Worms, later revealed to have founded by the Native Worms who created both ZECT and the Masked Rider System to eliminate the Worms before conducting Negishi's own plans for humanity. =Arata Kagami= is the son of ZECT's leader Riku Kagami, unaware of the organization's true agenda while fighting for the betterment of humanity as . Having joined ZECT to avenge his younger brother Ryou Kagami, works with Hiyori at Bistro La Salle, Arata has a good heart but is impulsive oftens act without thinking. In the previous timeline, Kagami married a Hiyori Kusakabe before helping Souji alter the timeline so the damage caused by the Worms' meteor would be minimized in Shibuya. In the new timeline, Arata meets Souji all over again when the latter claimed the Kabuto Zecter that he was to upon its completion. Being the only member of ZECT to know Souji's identity as Kabuto, momentarily using TheBee Zecter after Yaguruma was relieved of his duty, Arata became torn between his duty to ZECT and seeing Souji as a friend. Arata eventually acquired the Gatack Zecter and, becomes Gatack in the current timeline while learning the truth behind ZECT. They managed to wipe out most of the Worms before helping the rebels against the compromised ZECT led by Masato Mishima and the Native-class Worm leader Negishi. After ZECT was defeated, Arata started a new life with his father in the police force. During the events of Kamen Rider Zi-O, learning he is one of the few to remember ZECT and the Worms due to a time distortion, Arata helps the titular protagonist prevent a new Worm invasion while representing Souji. As Kamen Rider Gatack, he is usually in his pupa-like armored Masked Form with shoulder mounted cannons with a shooting radius of 1 kilometer. Gatack can use using the Gatack Zector's Cast Off to assume the sleeker and more combat-oriented Rider Form, armed with both Clock Up ability to execute a Rider Kick and the shotel-like blades which he can combine into a scissor-like weapon for his .

Arata Kagami is portrayed by . =Shuichi Tadokoro= Yuzuki and Arata's direct superior in the field, is a very stern man who commands numerous ZECT Trooper platoons. It is hinted at that he was once the mentor of the first TheBee, Sou Yaguruma. He was seriously injured when he tried to use the Gatack Zecter in order to save Arata from being chosen. Despite his appearance, he does care a great deal about his team, especially Arata and Yuzuki and will do anything to help them. He has a younger brother who runs the buckwheat-noodle restaurant which was once his father's business. Although he was the better cook, his brother inherited it anyway. After shielding Arata, it became clear in episode 41 that his true form is a Native Worm. However, he has no intention of conquering humanity like Negishi. During the epilogue, it is shown that he has taken over the running of the aforementioned family business. Tadokoro is 35 years old. Shuichi Tadokoro is portrayed by . =Yuzuki Misaki= A 23-year-old technician and agent for ZECT, travels with Kagami in the field tracking the movements of the Worms. Later on, she is given the assignment to track Souji and the stolen Kabuto Zecter. At first she is a \\"by-the-book\\" tough as nails character; however, she soon begins to question the actions of ZECT and eventually gains respect for Souji after he rescues her from the Worms. However, she was still irritated by Souji when he implies that she and Arata make a cute couple. She used herself as bait by disguising herself as Phantom Thief Shadow and tended to Arata when the Gatack Zecter attacked him. She loves buckwheat soba, and can chow down entire ramen bowls in seconds. A Worm disguised as her was sent to attack Souji's sister, but ended up meeting Tsurugi. The Worm reminded Tsurugi of his dead sister, but he ended up destroying the Worm. However, because of this, he gained a strong attraction to Yuzuki. As the series progressed, Yuzuki slowly began to reciprocate to Tsurugi's feelings, and accepted his request to spend Christmas Day with him. Unfortunately, Tsurugi became aware of the fact he was Scorpio Worm and was eventually destroyed in battle by Kabuto, despite Misaki's please to stop. During the epilogue, Yuzuki becomes the head of Tsurugi's corporation to honor his name. Yuzuki Misaki is portrayed by . =Sou Yaguruma= is originally a ZECT agent who was the original user of the TheBee Zecter and the first, having command of his personal army of ZECT Troopers called during his time as . A perfectionist believing in a philosophy known as , his composure and strict teamwork ethic conceal his arrogance and temper which Souji exploited to reveal a security flaw within his group. Sou's obsession to take out Souji resulted with the TheBee Zecter abandoning him with his former subordinate Shun Kageyama firing him instead of keeping him in Shadow as an advisor. This led Sou into insanity as he developed a morbid ideology, later resurfacing as after acquiring a as he attacks Worms and Kamen Riders alike. After bringing Shun under his wing once more, Sou attempts to stir his partner on to see things as he does, seeing that Shun is only setting himself up for a fall at the slightest glimmer of hope while expressing a bit of envy because he could no longer feel any emotion. After all of the enemy Worms are wiped out, Yaguruma puts a mutating Shun out of his misery while seeking to honor his promise for them to see the northern lights. During the events of Kamen Rider Zi-O, Sou opposed the titular protagonist by becoming Another Rider to protect the new invading Worms so he can fulfill his promise with one that assumed Shun's form. The differences between his God Speed Love and TV series iterations are the wrist locations of the TheBee Brace when he was TheBee, whereas God Speed Love has him wore it on the right wrist like other Kabutech Riders, while in TV series has him and other former TheBee users wore it on the left wrist. As either TheBee or KickHopper, Sou uses a kick-based fighting style. As KickHopper, he uses the joints on his left leg to jump around or execute a Rider Kick. Sou Yaguruma is portrayed by . =Shun Kageyama= is a former ZECT member under Sou who was the final user of the TheBee Zecter until he was kicked out of ZECT. Since then, Shun formed a partnership with his former leader after receiving his own Hopper Zecter from him and becoming . As either TheBee or PunchHopper, Shun uses a punch-based fighting style. Shun Kageyama is portrayed by . =Masato Mishima= The aide of ZECT HQ's leader, Riku Kagami. At times, does communicate with Sou and Tadokoro to brief the ZECT teams about the Worms. Eventually, he was upset with Sou botching a mission and Tadokoro questioning him about ZECT's agenda. There's implication that he has no faith in Shun as TheBee, despite the latter being loyal to ZECT and is looked down upon by Tsurugi Kamishiro. He has no sense of taste, and finishes eating by taking a supplement. He forcefully became TheBee at one time despite the TheBee Zecter's attempt to reject him. He truly thinks Shun is an eyesore because he can only complain and has lost the TheBee Zecter. He also seems to have a connection to Rena Mamiya/Uca Worm and had always kept the Hyper Zecter with him. Renge manages to steal the case with the Hyper Zecter, but Uca Worm takes it back only to find that the case has been rigged with a bomb. Mishima tries to destroy the Hyper Zecter with the bomb. After the explosion, he taunts Souji for failing to obtain the Hyper Zecter, so he saved the Hyper Zecter when he used Clock-Up. However, he doesn't realize the power of the Zecter as it manages to finds its way to Souji, much to his chagrin. He then tosses his glasses to the ground in anger. He gradually loses respect for Riku Kagami's servile manner toward the Natives. After realizing Negishi found out about the Red-Shoes system, he makes a pact with Negishi and overthrows Riku Kagami as leader of ZECT. Using the Natives' pendants, he regains the ability to turn his true form named , the strongest Native. He is defeated by Hyper Kabuto's and Gatack's Rider Kick and then destroyed by the meteorite explosion that obliterated the studio set. Masato Mishima is portrayed by . =Riku Kagami= Arata and Ryo's father, is a high-ranked official in ZECT, and serves as a figurehead to hide their connection to the natives. Arata seems to despise him because of Ryo's disappearance, as well as the lack of concern or activity done in order to find Ryo. Arata is also unaware that his father is even part of the organization, ZECT, let alone the leader. A mysterious person who always quotes animal bibles, he is also the chief of police. He is a highly trained fencer and plays the cello. It seems that he has a very secret agenda and would even sacrifice his sons to achieve his goals. Tendou later confronted Riku; the confrontation ended with Riku telling him that Tendou's sister (actually refers to Hiyori, not Jyuka) was not in good hands, which naturally made Tendou lose his composure, and Riku walked off, joking about Tendou's \\"walking down the path to heaven to rule over all\\". During the end of episode 36, he displays that he indeed knows about the Hopper Riders, saying they have opened the Gates of Hell. He also says the Rider's grand plan will be completed by our sons, showing that he did indeed know Tendou's father. He tells Kagami of the secrets behind the Masked Rider System in episode 41, displaying his knowledge of the Natives and how they created the system. He also tells Tendou that his father was the one who installed the Red Shoes system in the Zecters, and in turn, Tendou decides to trust him because he too desires to walk the path his father took. He is overthrown from his leadership position at ZECT by Mishima after revealing to Negishi the Red-Shoes system implemented into the Zecters. He is still alive in the epilogue watching his son grow up. It is likely he is now simply the chief of police. 52 years old. Riku Kagami is portrayed by . =Renge Takatori= Formerly a BrighTrooper, is a trainee of ZECT and Tendou's second in command who was sent by Mishima in order to spy on and assassinate Tendou. However, she yearns for Tendou as a master after she tasted his delicious cooking. Prior to meeting Tendou, she had eaten nothing but dry boiled rice for the last seven years of her life, considering the concept of taste and deliciousness a sin. Tendou went out of the way to make sure she would be well fed. She was also the person that booted Kageyama out from the ZECT HQ. Afterwards, Mishima orders her to kill Tendou, but she is persuaded by Tendou to forget Mishima and help him steal the Hyper Zecter. She is eventually knocked over the building by the Uca Worm only to be saved by Tendou. Despite her sweet and innocent demeanor, she is a fearsome fighter armed with a wire which can cut through almost anything; however, she is still relatively weak against Worms, but tries to fight anyway. After accepting Tendou as her superior, she began to work at the Bistro la Salle, although she often misinterpreted recipes and created horrible dishes as a result. Due to her harsh bring up as a BrighTrooper, her perception of training is rough. This was seen in Episode 38 when she began to time Jyuka and her classmates in setting up tents before their camping field trip. She was hit by a bullet that ricocheted off Kabuto's Kunai Gun, but hitting her in the shoulder. As an apology, Tendou made a meal for her while she was recovering in the hospital, also giving her a letter to Kagami. During the epilogue, Renge continues to work at the Bistro la Salle. 18 years old. Renge Takatori is portrayed by . =Negishi= One of the leaders of the Natives, seems like a fun loving person despite the deep respect ZECT offers to him. When he first meets Tendou, he almost admires Tendou, asking if he can be Tendou's fan. Despite his innocent look, Negishi actually has his own agenda and later carries it out once the Worms had been almost decimated. Believing Natives and humans would be unable to co-exist, Negishi sets up the plan to turn all of humanity into Native and thus achieve his ideal peace. To that, he placed Mishima as leader of ZECT and disposes Riku Kagami. But Negishi didn't count on Tendou's words to sway his comrades to have second thoughts of his plan. In the end, Dark Kabuto manages to capture him, dragging him inside the TV studio explosion that killed them off. Negishi is portrayed by . =ZECTroopers= are foot soldiers of the organization ZECT, they are armed with the , a weapon that draws some concepts from Riderman's Machine Gun Arm and Power Arm. The weapon consists of an automatic machine gun with a retractable blade, which they use for close-quarters combat. In addition, they also carry a grenade launcher-like shotgun as a last resort and means of retreating, also they use flash bombs which disable Worms and seem to prevent them from molting. Like the Riotroopers from Kamen Rider 555, they're only Rider-like, acting as cannon fodder for emergencies when a Rider cannot arrive in time. They are transported to the Worm hotspots via black, white, or silver HUMVEEs. Unfortunately, as seen in the first episode, they lack any concern for civilians. The special team known as assists Kamen Rider TheBee. Unlike regular ZECTroopers, they have yellow pin stripes on their uniforms. Shadow is able to prevent the Worms from molting, enabling TheBee to kill them. During a training mission, the ZECTrooper trainees, , are revealed. They wear white armor instead of the standard black. During episode 41, the AM bomb is revealed, forcing current Worms disguised as humans back into their original forms. It's revealed that the majority of ZECTroopers are Native Worms. However, after a speech by Tendou, they turn on Negishi and Mishima, aiding the Riders. Hiyori Kusakabe is first shown as a co-worker of Kagami's at the Bistro la Salle. She was involved in the meteor crash seven years ago along with Tendou. Due to the accident, her parents were killed. She believed that they were murdered by a person wearing a Rider Belt, but after a period of uncertainty she concludes that Tendou, despite owning the belt, would never do something like that. After seeing Gatack wear another belt and discovering that he was Kagami, she also began to doubt him. In the end however, she decides to trust both of them as they have helped her so much. She carries a green crystal that originated from Area X, ground zero of the meteor crash. She seems to be able to talk with and read the emotions of inanimate objects, such as drawings and machines. She's quite clumsy and tends to zone out while working, resulting in complaints by customers. Through several mishaps and accidents, she was able to discover the identities of all the Riders besides Drake. Later in the series, it was discovered that Hiyori is the child of a Native Worm who impersonated Tendou's mother down to her pregnancy, and later gave birth to . This technically makes her Tendou's younger sister. During episode 33, the energy charge from the Hyper Zecter sent her along with the Souji Kusakabe to the edge of time and space. The Hyper Zecter later appeared in the normal dimension, showing one of Hiyori's drawings to Tendou and Kagami. She reappeared during episode 38, being led away by Kusakabe Souji, at the edge of time and space. She returns to the real world in episode 43 to defend Dark Kabuto from Hyper Kabuto, stating that she no longer desires to live in the human world. Ultimately however, after a compelling speech by Tendou saying that she will not be hated in the human world, even though she is a Worm, she abandons Kusakabe Souji and returns to the human world. However, she is then attacked by Dark Kabuto. After being saved by Tendou, she returns to an almost normal life, and begins making her own menu and dream of owning a restaurant come true. During the epilogue, she returns to her normal life in working at the Bistro la Salle, and now has Jyuka as a sister. As a human, she is 18 years old. Hiyori Kusakabe is portrayed by . As a child, Hiyori is portrayed by . Jyuka Tendou is presented as Souji's younger sister, but in truth she seems to be his younger cousin. They were both taken in by their grandmother after the Shibuya meteorite crash. She's really close to Souji, who she calls \\"older brother\\", and tends to act the same way he does; such as talking about her grandmother and pointing to the sky. She was injured in a car crash caused by Kamishiro, but blows it off to her brother's concern. She also assists her brother in running noodle carts across town. She has different ways of saying \\"Good Morning\\" to Tendou and loves his cooking. Lately, she has been targeted by ZECT and the Worms. So far two Worms, disguised as Misaki and Daisuke, tried to either kidnap or kill her. She seems to be aware of the Zecters as the Kabuto, TheBee, and Drake Zecters fly around the entire Tendou household, while the Sasword Zecter crawls on the dining table. It is unclear, however, whether she knows that Souji is a Kamen Rider. During the epilogue, it is shown that she has accepted Hiyori as her \\"sister\\" and is now working with her at the Bistro la Selle. 13 years old. Jyuka Tendou is portrayed by . Yumiko Takemiya Hiyori and Kagami's boss at the Bistro la Salle restaurant, seems to tolerate Hiyori's clumsiness and Kagami's tardiness.

Daisuke Kazama is a metro-sexual make-up artist who openly befriends women, seeing them as the treasure of life.

Gon Real name: , is a girl whom Daisuke has accompanied, she seems to have amnesia but at the beginning of episode 17, she slowly remembers time before she met Kazama Daisuke. Gon also pictures her mother , but cannot make out who it is. She always completes Kazama's sentences for him, usually after make-up sessions. She is incredibly mature for her age, often taking initiatives which surprise even Souji. In the end, after remembering her mother's face on the day that they were attacked at the bus by the same Worm that tried to kill her mother, she was finally reunited with her mother. Drake killed the Worm, and Gon completely remembered her past but unfortunately forgot about Daisuke and treated him as a complete stranger afterwards. However, she regained her memories of being Gon while reading an article on Daisuke in a teen magazine. She also helps Daisuke regain his Drake Zecter from his Worm imitation. She recently discovered the identities of the first five Riders, when they ganged up on Daisuke, who they believed was a Worm. In her latest appearance, she has given the Drake Grip to Souji after stealing it from Daisuke. She returns to help both Daisuke and Rena with the Hopper Riders by spraying them with a fire extinguisher; however, when Rena gains her Worm memories, she is attacked by Rena.

Tsurugi Kamishiro is a descendant of the English nobility of the Discabil family, calling himself \\"the man who replaces the gods (Kamishiro) with a sword's slash (Tsurugi)\\" in his introductions. He is Souji's equal in everything but cooking and normal social skills, quoting his butler Jiiya while expressing his intent to be the best at everything. But Tsurugi is unaware that he is actually the, a Worm that killed the real Tsurugi and assumed his form while killing the man's older sister Mika. However, the Scorpio Worm's mind was completely overridden by the real Tsurugi's memories, believing himself to be Tsurugi while haunted by Mika's death to the point of disassociating himself as a Worm while vowing to kill them all. Jiiya kept Tsurugi in the dark of his true identity as the Kamishiro fortune had severely dwindled, Tsurugi becoming ZECT's hired exterminator as . While Tsurugi is let go after Kagami becomes Gattack, he aids Souji after realizing Jiiya was teaching him to be a better person and the ways of noblesse oblige. Eventually learning of true nature as a Worm, a despairing Tsurugi aligns himself with the Worms to lead an all-out attack against the ZECT Riders. But this would turn out to be Tsurugi's plan to fulfill his promise by leading the Worms to slaughter, allowing Souji to fatally wound him with the Maximum Hyper Typhoon so Mika can be avenged before returning to his mansion to die in peace. Tsurugi can transform into Sasword by using sword with the , which quells his Worm instincts. His Masked Mode outfitted with tubing that supply performance enhancing chemicals, Sasword can enter Rider Mode to access his Clock Up ability or execute his Rider Slash attack. Tsurugi Kamishiro is portrayed by . Jiiya A butler who serves the Kamishiro family, serves Tsurugi and often acts as a parental figure to him. He remains loyal to Kamishiro despite many of his rude actions. It seems that the Kamishiro wealth is no more, but Jiiya hides this fact from Tsurugi, finding ways to get money such as getting monetary reward for Sasword's killing of Worms, and after that transaction was cancelled, opening a ramen shop (which Tendou decides to take over as he sees Jiiya as too worthy to be doing this). He tells Kagami about Kamishiro's sister and her death at the hands of the Scorpio Worm. He has a younger twin brother who keeps the Legendary White Knife. He knows that Scorpio Worm is Tsurugi's true form but has chosen not to tell him because Tsurugi, as the last of the famous British Discabil family, must, in one form or another, carry on its name. Jiiya is respected by Tendou who refers to him as \\"Humanity's Treasure\\" due to his incredible skill as a chef. He has several students who hold him and high respect, and has published a cook book, which Tendou carries a copy of at all times. During the epilogue, it is revealed that he is the head cook for the Discabil Restaurant, which is owned by Misaki and named in his master's honor. 65 years old. Jiiya is portrayed by . Souji Kusakabe is a Native who uses the Dark Kabuto Zecter, this mimic version of Tendou was actually a human infant that was captured by Mishima and used for his experiments after being turned into a Native.

Worms The are Arthropod-like alien lifeforms that came from a meteor that devastated the city district of Shibuya seven years prior to the series' current timeline, the meteor being part of a larger one that greatly devastated Earth in the previous timeline depicted in the film Godspeed Love. The Worms are motivated to subvert and replace the population of an area they invade, possessing the ability to replicate the appearance and memories of another being whom they kill off. Worms believe that the original will live on as a part of them, since they adopt their victim's personality traits. But there are setbacks to this process as the Worms are unable to fully replicate aspects of their victims like their scent and can forced into their true forms through certain chemicals like makeup, few having his minds overridden by the memories of the identity they stole. The most basic of the Worms are , green chrysalis-like creatures with an albino variant called a . When threatened or endangered, a Salis Worm molts into a stronger form that can move at blinding speeds which comes from their high metabolism. It would later be revealed that the current Worms are the second group to reach Earth, a previous group of Worms called the Natives came to Earth 35 years ago before the events of the series. Unlike their aggressive kin, the Natives learned to co-exist with humans with some creating their own human identities. They are also the ones who developed the Masked Rider System and ZECT for the purpose of fighting off the Worms. =Rena Mamiya= Her true form is , the first executive Worm. A cruel and clever planner, is the one who ordered a Worm to capture (or kill) Jyuka. In Worm form, she is very powerful and on her debut, she defeated both TheBee and Drake. She is also the only Worm to \\"truly\\" defeat Tendou and make him involuntarily power down. Soon after, she discovers the existence of the Hyper Zecter and attempts to retrieve it after she shoved Renge off a building. Despite retrieving the suitcase, Mishima sets off a bomb which seemingly destroys the Hyper Zecter. Despite the massive explosion, her Worm form was apparently enough to handle and survive the explosion. Her human form is a 25-year-old woman always dressed in black. At episode 39, she was hit by Hyper Kabuto's Hyper Sting finisher, causing amnesia with the persona of the very woman she imitated. The original Rena was a talented singer with a kind heart that wanted to help people. Believing herself to be Rena, she chases after her dream of being an opera singer until her Worm persona eventually resurfaced. She is able to sing one more requiem for Daisuke on stage, expressing her gratitude to him. Ultimately, she is fatally wounded by Kamen Rider Drake's using the Rider Shooting twice in their final battle, ending with Uca Worm ultimately dying in Daisuke's arms as a human. Rena Mamiya is portrayed by . =Reiji Nogi= is the boss class of the Worm army. He is dressed in a black trench coat and wields a cane which he uses in battle. Possessing uncanny martial art skills, he is powerful enough to take on Kagami and Tendou in his human form, while they are in their Rider forms. His first form, , has the capability of \\"Freeze\\", which is activated by clenching his left fist. Through this, he can completely stop the flow of time to the point in which even the power of Hyper Clock Up is purposeless. During his debut, he is able to completely neutralize Hyper Kabuto, even with the Perfect Zecter. He then later was destroyed by Hyper Kabuto's Maximum Hyper Cyclone. After his demise, he evolved into a stronger form by use of the ability, \\"Life of Immortality\\". In this form, he is able to absorb Worms and tachyon energy alike to gain their powers as shown when he absorbs two subordinate Worms and Gatack's Rider Kick. He later absorbs Sasword's Rider Slash, TheBee's Rider Sting, and Gatack's Rider Cutting; but failed to absorb a triple rider kick by Kabuto, Gatack, and KickHopper. He then later was destroyed by Hyper Kabuto's Maximum Hyper Cyclone. After his demise, he evolved split into two entities and assumes a new form of . When Tsurugi's Worm identity exposed, the Nogis tried to recruit Scorpio Worm as their minions, but instead Scorpio Worm turned them into his minions after showing he was superior to them in power.

Lyotard introduced the term 'postmodernism', which was previously only used by art critics, into philosophy and social sciences, with the following observation: \\"Simplifying to the extreme, I define postmodern as incredulity towards metanarratives\\".Lyotard, Jean-Fran√ßois (1979). La condition postmoderne: rapport sur le savoir. Paris: Minuit.Anderson, Perry (1998). The Origins of Postmodernity. London/New York: Verso, pp. 24‚Äì27.Quotation from the 1984 (reprint 1997); English translation by Geoffrey Bennington and Brian Massumi, University of Minnesota Press. Originally written as a report on the influence of technology in exact sciences, commissioned by the Conseil des universit√©s du Qu√©bec, the book was influential.Bruneault, Fr√©d√©rick (Autumn 2004). \\"Savoir scientifique et l√©gitimation\\", Revue PHARES vol. 5.Lyotard, Jean-Francois (1979). \\"Les probl√®mes du savoir dans les soci√©t√©s industrielles les plus d√©velopp√©es\\". Quebec: Conseil des Universit√©s. Original report available online at: http://www.cse.gouv.qc.ca/FR/Publications_CUniv/ Lyotard later admitted that he had a \\"less than limited\\" knowledge of the science he was to write about, deeming The Postmodern Condition his worst book. Summary Lyotard criticizes metanarratives such as reductionism and teleological notions of human history such as those of the Enlightenment and Marxism, arguing that they have become untenable because of technological progress in the areas of communication, mass media and computer science. Techniques such as artificial intelligence and machine translation show a shift to linguistic and symbolic production as central elements of the postindustrial economy and the related postmodern culture, which had risen at the end of the 1950s after the reconstruction of western Europe. The result is a plurality of language-games (a term coined by Ludwig Wittgenstein), of different types of argument. At the same time, the goal of truth in science is replaced by \\"performativity\\" and efficiency in the service of capital or the state, and science produces paradoxical results such as chaos theory, all of which undermine science's grand narrative. Lyotard professes a preference for this plurality of small narratives that compete with each other, replacing the totalitarianism of grand narratives. Reception The Postmodern Condition was influential. However, Lyotard later admitted that he had a \\"less than limited\\" knowledge of the science he wrote about, and to compensate for this knowledge, he \\"made stories up\\" and referred to a number of books that he hadn't actually read. In retrospect, he called it \\"a parody\\" and \\"simply the worst of all my books\\". The poet Frederick Turner writes that, like many post- structuralist works, The Postmodern Condition \\"has not worn well.\\" However, he sees it more readable than other post-structuralist works, and credits Lyotard with covering \\"a good deal of ground in a lively and economical fashion.\\"Turner, Frederick.

Women have been at the forefront of textual communication since early civilizations. History Among the first known female writers is Enheduanna; she is also the earliest known poet ever recorded. She was the High Priestess of the goddess Inanna and the moon god Nanna (Sin). She lived in the Sumerian city-state of Ur over 4,200 years ago.Gods, Demons, and Symbols of Ancient Mesopotamia: An Illustrated Dictionary by Jeremy Black and Anthony Green (1992, ), p. 134 (entry \\"Nanna-Suen\\"). Enheduanna's contributions to Sumerian literature, definitively ascribed to her, include several personal devotions to Inanna and a collection of hymns known as the \\"Sumerian Temple Hymns\\". Further additional texts are ascribed to her.Hallo and Van Dijk 1968, p. 3. This makes her the first named author in world history. She was the first known woman to hold the title of EN, a role of great political importance that was often held by royal daughters.J Renger 1967: \\"Untersuchungen zum Priestertum in der altbabylonischen Zeit\\", Zeitschrift f√ºr Assyriologie und vorderasiatische Arch√§ologie. Vol. 58, p. 118. She was appointed to the role by her father, King Sargon of Akkad. Her mother was probably Queen Tashlultum. Enheduanna was appointed to the role of High Priestess in a shrewd political move by Sargon to help secure power in the south of his kingdom, where the City of Ur was located.Franke, p. 831. =7th century B.C.E.= Sappho (; Aeolic Greek Psapph√¥; c. 630 - c. 570 BCE) was an archaic Greek poet from the island of Lesbos. Sappho is known for her lyric poetry, written to be sung while accompanied by a lyre. Most of Sappho's poetry is now lost, and what is extant has survived only in fragmentary form, except for one complete poem: the \\"Ode to Aphrodite\\". As well as lyric poetry, ancient commentators claimed that Sappho wrote elegiac and iambic poetry. Three epigrams attributed to Sappho are extant, but these are actually Hellenistic imitations of Sappho's style. =15th century= Christine de Pizan was the best known late medieval French writer, rhetorician, and critic, who wrote Book of the City of Ladies in 1405, a text about an allegorical city in which independent women lived free from the slander of men. In her work she included real women artists, such as Anastasia, who was considered one of the best Parisian illuminators, although none of her work has survived. Other humanist texts led to increased education for Italian women. 16th century Gulbadan Banu, daughter of Mughal Emperor Babur, wrote the biography of her brother, Emperor Humayun. =19th century= Angelica Kauffman, Literature and Painting, 1782, Kenwood House One of the best known 19th-century female writers was Jane Austen, author of Sense and Sensibility (1811), Pride and Prejudice (1813), Mansfield Park (1814) and Emma (1816), who achieved success as a published writer. She wrote two additional novels, Northanger Abbey and Persuasion, both published posthumously in 1818, and began another, eventually titled Sanditon, but died before its completion.

Unlike the main seam, the quarter seam has no stitching and is not raised above the surface of the ball. It is produced during the manufacturing process by the boundary between two pieces of leather forming each half of the ball. Some fielding sides have been accused of deliberately interfering with the quarter seam, which would constitute illegal ball tampering. Construction Ball tampering There have been accusations of ball tampering involving the quarter seam, which is against the laws of cricket and would constitute cheating. If fielding sides were to deliberately damage the quarter seam, it could alter the flow of air past the ball during a delivery, aiding swing bowling. Ball tampering with the main seam usually involves picking at the threads of its stitching to enhance conventional swing when the ball is only a few overs old. In contrast, lifting the quarter seam on one side of an older scuffed ball would produce reverse swing. A lifted quarter seam could potentially be pushed back to its normal position before the end of the over, when the ball is due to be inspected by the umpires. During the fourth Test between England and Pakistan at The Oval in 2006, umpire Darrell Hair adjudged Pakistan to have tampered with the ball. Hair was seen pointing to the quarter seam while discussing the issue with his fellow umpire, Billy Doctrove. The umpires imposed a five-run penalty and replaced the ball. Play continued until the end of the session, at which point Pakistan objected to the decision and refused to play on, forfeiting the match. The International Cricket Council subsequently upheld the umpires' decision and the result of the match, but banned Hair from umpiring in international cricket. The incident remains highly controversial.http://usa.cricinfo.com/engvpak/content/story/257046.html References Category:Cricket terminology ","title":"Quarter seam"},{"id":"6698703","text":"Don't Cry _Too_ Hard was the debut album by Canadian folk rock band Leslie Spit Treeo, released in 1990.

Photo by Hossam el-Hamalawy. Joel Beinin is Donald J. McLachlan Professor of History and Professor of Middle East History at Stanford University. From 2006 to 2008 he served as Director of Middle East Studies and Professor of History at the American University in Cairo. Education Beinin was raised as a Zionist in an American Jewish family. On graduating from high school, he spent six months working on a kibbutz, where he met his future wife. He studied Arabic at university, and received his B.A. from Princeton University in 1970. He spent the summer of 1969 studying Arabic at the American University in Cairo. Intending to move to Israel permanently, he joined other members of Hashomer Hatzair in living and working at Kibbutz Lahav. There, on encountering attitudes that struck him as being contemptuous of Palestinians,'I tended livestock on Kibbutz Lahav, which was established on the ruins of three Palestinian villages. The Palestinian inhabitants had been expelled and, because they are not Jewish, were unable to return. One day, we needed extra workers to help clean manure from the turkey cages. The head of the turkey branch said we should not ask for kibbutz members to do the work because, 'This isn't work for Jews. This is work for Arabushim'. Arabushim is an extremely derogatory racial term.' Joel Beinin, ' 'Silencing Critics Not Way to Middle East Peace.', in San Francisco Chronicle, February 4, 2007 he gradually became disenchanted with his early ideals. He returned to the United States in 1973, and took his M.A. from Harvard University in 1974, and, after working in auto plants in Detroit, obtained his A.M.L.S. and Ph.D. from the University of Michigan in 1978 and 1982, respectively. He has also studied at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.  Research and career  Beinin's research and writing focuses on workers, peasants, and minorities in the modern Middle East. Though initially interested in the rise of an Arab Working class in Mandatory Palestine, under his thesis supervisor's advice, he changed the topic of his doctoral thesis to a history of the Egyptian labor movement since 1936. That Ph.D. thesis was combined with one covering an earlier period of Egyptian labor history by his friend and colleague Zachary Lockman and resulted in the publication of Workers on the Nile: Nationalism, Communism, Islam and the Egyptian Working Class, 1882‚Äì1954 (1989). Among his later work is a study of the Jewish communities of modern Egypt which led to his major historical study, The Dispersion Of Egyptian Jewry: Culture, Politics, And The Formation Of A Modern Diaspora (1998), which examines the diversity of Egyptian Jewish identities in Egypt and in the diaspora. He has engaged in fieldwork to collect oral reports among many Egyptian Jewish communities dispersed throughout the world after the Suez War of 1956, among them the Karaites of San Francisco. In 2002 he served as President of the Middle East Studies Association of North America.Joel Beinin's personal web page. Last accessed January 31, 2007. He served as Director of Graduate Studies in the History Department at Stanford University in 2002‚Äì2004 and again in 2005‚Äì06, but then took a leave of absence from that institution in order to take up a position as Director of Middle East Studies at the American University in Cairo. At the time he said that Stanford was institutionally uninterested in the study and teaching of the modern Middle East. Beinin has written four books and co-edited three others and published many scholarly articles. He is also active as a commentator on issues regarding Israel, Palestine, and the Arab‚ÄìIsraeli conflict. He has been a contributing editor to Middle East Reporthttp://www.stanford.edu/~beinin/ and has published articles in, among others, The Nation and Le Monde diplomatique.

While there, he had a reggae segment inside a Saturday-night radio programme on Sveriges Radio P3. He then returned to the UK to study Philosophy at the Wivenhoe Park campus of the University of Essex. While studying at the University of Essex, and presenting two programmes on the student radio station, in 1987 Adebayo was elected President of the University of Essex Students' Union to serve in the 1987/1988 academic year. Standing as an independent, he defeated Labour Students candidate Asad Rehman. Adebayo revealed during an episode of Up All Night that his middle names were \\"Davey Moore\\". His parents were boxing fans and had given him these middle names because the boxer Davey Moore had boxed and beaten British-Nigerian Hogan Bassey a year earlier. He spoke about this during the show's \\"Virtual Jukebox\\" segment when the Bob Dylan song \\"Who Killed Davey Moore\\" had been selected by a listener.  Career  The American playwright Tennessee Williams chose Adebayo to play a small part in the world premiere of his last play, The Red Devil Battery Sign, in which Adebayo acted opposite Pierce Brosnan. Adebayo appeared in The Oblong Box at the age of eight, and Danish filmmaker Lars Von Trier's The Element of Crime. As well as claiming to have been the first black Teddy boy in London in his early teens, Adebayo also won a Rotary Club public- speaking award as a teenager, and worked for the BBC from the age of 12 on the radio programme Network Africa. Adebayo resigned as President of the University of Essex Students' Union within a few months to take up a job with The Voice, Britain's main black newspaper, where he was music editor until 1991. His columns and articles have been published in Pride Magazine and the New Nation, as well as broadsheet and tabloid newspapers such as The Guardian, The Independent, The Times, London Evening Standard and the News of the World. Some of these columns were compiled into Can I Have My Balls Back Please (2000) and its sequel Sperm Bandits (2002). He is working on his first novel, Promised Land, an epic saga spanning 50 years in the lives of Britain's richest black family. In 1993, while appearing on Channel 4's The Devil's Advocate opposite presenter Darcus Howe, he was spotted by GLR programme executive Gloria Abramov, who was looking for a new presenter for the Black London programme. His broadcasting work on BBC London 94.9 gave him the opportunity to present other programmes, such as the Saturday night reggae show, and he eventually \\"presented everything except travel!\\" On his half-week of the Up All Night show on BBC Radio 5 Live, he presents both the World Football Phone-In and the Virtual Jukebox: this was a replacement for his Virtual Bookshelf. Adebayo's television work includes writing and presenting the docudrama Sperm Bandits, the documentary White Girls Are Easy (both for Channel 4), and the weekly show Heavy TV. Adebayo founded the publishing company X Press, producing black fiction such as Baby Father, Victor Headley's Yardie (which became the first black British best-seller when it was published in 1992), and Cop Killer (which gained instant notoriety when 200 bullets were sent out to the press to promote the title). He is also responsible for the Nia imprint of literary black fiction, including titles such as J. California Cooper's In Search of Satisfaction, and the 20/20 imprint for current generic fiction such as the best-seller Curvy Lovebox. Adebayo also published the comic magazine Skank. Adebayo is co-founder of Colourtelly, Britain's first general-interest black internet television station. To save costs, Adebayo uses his own house as the studio. When it launched on 1 August 2007, he had the aim of attracting 6000 subscribers to break even. In September 2020, Adebayo became a co-presenter of On The Continent as part of the new Football Ramble Presents network, alongside Andy Brassell. Personal life Adebayo is married to singer Carroll Thompson, and they have two daughters. He supports Charlton Athletic FC. In October 1999, Adebayo was invited to Buckingham Palace to meet Queen Elizabeth II. Ten years later, he was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the Queen's Birthday Honours 2009.

In Japan, the case is also known as the . Abduction Fusako Sano, then a fourth grade elementary school girl, disappeared on November 13, 1990 at age nineKubota (2006) after watching a school baseball game in her home town of Sanj≈ç, Niigata Prefecture, Japan. A large police search failed to find the missing girl. Police even considered the possibility that she had been kidnapped by North Korean intelligence operatives. She had been kidnapped by Nobuyuki Sat≈ç (born 1963), then a 28-year-old mentally disturbed unemployed Japanese man, who forced her into his car, and subsequently held her in the upstairs floor of his apartment in a residential area of Kashiwazaki, Niigata Prefecture for 9 years and two months. The house is only 200 meters from a k≈çban (police substation), and 55 kilometers from the location where she was kidnapped. The missing years Whilst Sano was initially scared, according to her own statements, she eventually just gave up and accepted her fate. Allegedly, the kidnapper kept her tied up for several months and used a stun gun for punishments if she did not videotape the horse races on television. Sano was also threatened with a knife and beatings. Her kidnapper shared his men's clothes with her and gave her food three times per day, either instant food or meals cooked by his mother, who lived downstairs in the house. He also cut Sano's hair. Since there was no bath or toilet upstairs where Sano was confined, she was only able to take a bath infrequently, when permitted by her captor. She spent most of her time in captivity listening to the radio, and reportedly was allowed to watch TV only in the last year of her ordeal. While the door was never locked, Sano did not take a step outside for nine years. She later told the police: \\"I was too scared to escape and eventually lost the energy to escape.\\" Sat≈ç's mother lived downstairs and apparently had no contact with her son's captive since he became very violent whenever she tried to go upstairs. However, police believe the mother must have had some knowledge of Sano's presence; for example, it was alleged that she purchased feminine hygiene products for the victim. Discovery The mother of Nobuyuki Sat≈ç, then 73 years old, consulted the Kashiwazaki public health center in January 1996, because her son had been acting strangely and was violent to her. She called again on January 12, 2000, and again on January 19, requesting a visit to her home. Officials finally visited the home on Friday, January 28, 2000. Subsequently, Sat≈ç caused a disturbance that resulted in police being called to the scene. On this occasion, Sano, by then 19 years old, approached the officers and identified herself. She reportedly said: Upon her rescue Sano was found to be healthy, although extremely thin and weak due to lack of exercise: she could barely walk. She was also dehydrated. Due to the lack of exposure to sunlight, she also had a very light skin tone and suffered from jaundice. While her body was that of a 19-year-old woman, mentally she acted like a child. She also suffered from posttraumatic stress disorder. Soon after her release, Sano was reunited with her family. Her mother did not initially recognize her, since she had last seen her at age 9. The local newspaper compared the incident to the Yotsuya ghost story, based on the address of Sat≈ç. Aftermath =The victim= In the years following her release, Sano's physical health improved, and she now helps out in her family's rice paddy. As a result of her lack of normal social interactions during her captivity, she still has difficulties adjusting to normal life, has very few friends, and likes to take walks alone. She enjoys digital photography, especially of flowers, and obtained a driver's license. Neighbors comment that she is a fan of the local J. League Football (soccer) team Albirex Niigata, and goes to some of their games. The Sano family refuses to comment on her ordeal. In 2007, her father drowned in a pond, in her presence, where the two went for fun. =Prosecution= Nobuyuki Sat≈ç, then 37 years old, was hospitalized immediately on January 28, 2000, as mentally unstable. On February 10, 2000, his legal status was changed from suspect to criminal, and he was arrested on February 11, 2000. The Niigata court opened his trial on May 23, 2000. In the proceedings, the prosecutors acted very carefully to avoid further damage to Sano's mental health. The prosecution's case included even minor charges against Sat≈ç (for example, shoplifting of women's underwear) with the goal of putting him in jail for as long as possible. Following a defense claim of criminal insanity, on September 6, 2001, psychiatrists found Sat≈ç to be mentally fit to face the charges, and he subsequently admitted the main charges. In the first instance, on January 22, 2002, the Niigata District court sentenced him to 14 years out of a maximum of 15 years. The defense appealed on January 24, 2002, and the trial moved to the Tokyo High Court. On October 12, 2002, the Tokyo High Court judge sentenced Sat≈ç to 11 years, reducing the initial sentence. Both the prosecution and the defense appealed on December 24, 2002, and the case moved to the Supreme Court of Japan on December 10, 2002. On July 10, 2003, the Supreme Court judge accepted the prosecution's arguments, with the result that Sat≈ç is currently serving a 14-year prison sentence. Criticism of the police After the discovery and rescue of Sano, the police in Japan were heavily criticized. Sat≈ç was already known to police for inflicting violence against another girl on June 13, 1989, for which he was convicted on September 19, 1989. However, his name somehow disappeared from the list of criminals, and he was not considered a suspect in the abduction of Sano in 1990. At the time of Sano's rescue, Niigata Prefectural Police chief, Koji Kobayashi, did not show up to the police station to supervise the situation, but spent his evening playing mah-jong with the head of the Regional Police Bureaus. Due to this, and subsequent errors by the police, Kobayashi resigned on February 26, 2000, and the head of the Regional Police Bureaus resigned on February 29, 2000.

Home-improvement television shows touting do-it-yourself renovation techniques have made fixer-uppers more popular, but during a real-estate downturn with newer homes available at depressed prices, there is often reduced interest. Inexperienced buyers frequently underestimate the amount and cost of repairs necessary to make a home livable or saleable.

Before she was wrecked she participated in the capture of a noted French privateer. Service Saldanha was first commissioned in April 1810 under Captain John Stuart, who died on 19 March 1811. Captain William Pakenham then was assigned to command her, though in the Spring, Saldanha was temporarily under the command of Captain Reuben Mangin. On 11 October 1811, and Saldanha, under Pakenham, took the French privateer Vice-Amiral Martin. The privateer carried 18 guns and a crew of 140 men. On this cruise Vice-Amiral Martin was four days out of Bayonne and had not taken anything. Captain H. Vansitart of Fortunee remarked that Vice-Amiral Martin had superior sailing abilities that in the past had helped her escape British cruisers, and that though this time each of the British vessels was doing , she would have escaped if the British had not had two vessels. Loss Saldanha and the sloop-of-war were based together in Lough Swilly, Donegal when on 30 November they set out on a cruise to the west. Saldanha shipwrecked in a gale on the night of 4 December 1811 in the Lough while possibly attempting to return to her anchorage. There were no survivors out of the estimated 253 aboard, and some 200 bodies washed up on the shore at Ballymastocker Bay on the west side of the Lough.The ship's complement was 274 men, and 21 are known to have been off the ship at the time. (Actually, one man did make it to the shore alive but he died almost immediately thereafter.) Initial reports suggested that Talbot too had been wrecked but as it turned out these reports were mistaken. In August a servant at a house some 20 miles from the wreck site shot a bird that turned out to be a parrot with a collar engraved with \\"Captain Packenham of His Majesty's Ship Saldanha\\". Earlier, Pakenham had been captain of when she wrecked off the coast of Luzon in the Philippines on 4 October 1808. In that wrecking only one seaman died and the survivors reached Manila. Postscript On 4 December 2011 a special ceremony was held to mark the 200th anniversary of sinking in Lough Swilly of HMS Saldanha.

History  Beginning in the mid-19th century, Russian nobility visited Nice and the French Riviera, following the fashion established decades earlier by the English upper class and nobility. In 1864, immediately after the railway reached Nice, Tsar Alexander II visited by train and was attracted by the pleasant climate. Thus began an association between Russians and the French Riviera that continues to this day. The cathedral, consecrated in December 1912 in memory of Nicholas Alexandrovich, Tsarevich of Russia, who died in Nice, was meant to serve the large Russian community that had settled in Nice by the end of the 19th century, as well as devout visitors from the Imperial Court. Tsar Nicholas II funded the construction work. After 1917, Communist persecution of religion in Russia led some Russian Orthodox dioceses abroad to form jurisdictions not affiliated with Moscow. One of these, the Paris-based exarchate, later assumed control of the Nice Cathedral. On 20 January 2010, a French Court (the Tribunal of First Instance at Nice) ruled that the title to the Cathedral should be held by the Russian state. Legal dispute From 2005 till December 2011, there was a protracted ownership and church jurisdictional dispute over the church building as well as control over the parish, between the existing administration of the Exarchate (for legal purposes represented by the \\"association culturelle\\") on the one hand and the RF government on the other.–ö–æ–Ω—Å—Ç–∞–Ω—Ç–∏–Ω–æ–ø–æ–ª—å—Å–∫–∏–π –ø–∞—Ç—Ä–∏–∞—Ä—Ö–∞—Ç –æ–±–≤–∏–Ω—è–µ—Ç —Ä–æ—Å—Å–∏–π—Å–∫–∏–µ –≤–ª–∞—Å—Ç–∏ –∏ –±–∏–∑–Ω–µ—Å –≤ –ø–æ–ø—ã—Ç–∫–µ –∑–∞—Ö–≤–∞—Ç–∞ —Ö—Ä–∞–º–∞ –≤ –ù–∏—Ü—Ü–µ Interfax, Feb 15, 2006. The dispute partly stemmed from a conflict between old Russian nobility who had long since settled in Nice and newly arrived post-Soviet Russians. The Russian state, which in 2010 was recognised by the French court as the legal owner, decided in 2011 to turn the church building over to the Moscow Patriarchate.–ú–∏—Ç—Ä–æ–ø–æ–ª–∏—Ç –ò–ª–∞—Ä–∏–æ–Ω: –≤–æ–ø—Ä–æ—Å –æ –ø–µ—Ä–µ–¥–∞—á–µ —Ö—Ä–∞–º–∞ –≤ –ù–∏—Ü—Ü–µ –Ω—É–∂–Ω–æ —Ä–µ—à–∞—Ç—å —Å –ø–æ–º–æ—â—å—é –ø–µ—Ä–µ–≥–æ–≤–æ—Ä–æ–≤ On 10 April 2013, the Cour de Cassation, the highest civil court in France, refused to quash the decision of the Court of Appeal, with the result that the building itself and the parcel of land on which it stands were confirmed as the property of the Russian Federation.

It was formerly the seat of the Bishop of Saint-Omer, but the see was not restored after the French Revolution, being instead absorbed into the Diocese of Arras under the Concordat of 1801. The church is still commonly referred to as the \\"cathedral\\" however.  History  Originally a modest chapel from the 7th century, the church was built on the site around 1052. It was damaged around 1200 by a fire. The choir, the ambulatory and the radiant chapels were then rebuilt, and in 1263 the transept was built. Work progressed slowly and spread from the 13th to the 16th century. Afterwards the church became collegiate. The southern transept was extended from 1375 to 1379, and the nave was rebuilt. The lateral chapels of the nave date from 1386 to 1403. The oldest chapels were built in the south. The central nave was completed only in 1473, and its vaults in 1506. From 1449 to 1472, Jehan de Meldre, prime contractor, proceeded to extend the north cross-section of the transept. At that time the tower to the west which had remained Romanesque was consolidated and enhanced. From 1473 to 1521, the western tower was built around the Romanesque tower. It was re-dressed and decorated in the style of the abbey church of Saint-Bertin (built between 1431 and 1500). The sculptures of the western portal were realized from 1511 to 1515, by the sculptors of Bruges Jean and Josse Van der Poele. The arrow above the crossing dates from 1486. In 1553, the nearby town of Th√©rouanne, where the bishopric of Artois was located, was totally razed by the troops of Charles V, during a conflict which opposed it to the King of France Henry II. Salt was symbolically spread over the city floor. In the years that followed, it was decided to share the diocese of Th√©rouanne, in order to respect the borders between the kingdom of France and the Spanish Netherlands. Thus was created in 1559 the diocese of Saint-Omer and the collegiate Notre-Dame became cathedral in 1561.

Life Storck was baptized in the Noorderkerk, a Protestant church in the Jordaan. His father was the painter Jan Jansz Sturck (or Johannes Storck) (1603-1673), from Wesel; his mother was Teuntje (Apolonia) Jacobs. The couple married in 1628. Storck had two brothers, who were also painters using the name Sturckenburch until c. 1688 after which they started calling themselves Storck or Sturck.Biography of A. Storck, National Maritime Museum Greenwich It is likely they were all trained with their father in the family workshop and joined the local Guild of Saint Luke, otherwise it was impossible to sell any painting. Around 1666 Storck set up his own workshop producing naval, harbor scenes as well as landscape paintings and city scapes. In 1670 he traveled with his brother Jacob and worked in Germany. In 1694, being 49 years old, he married the widow Neeltje Pieters van Meyservelt. At the end of his life he lived on Kattenburg near the harbour.S.A.C.

Oxford Art Online. Oxford University Press. Web. 5 Jan. 2016 Storck, influenced by Jan Baptist Weenix, produced fantastical views of Mediterranean ports, which place merchant shipping a midst architectural ruins, depicted in the crystal-clear colours of Italian art of the period. This type of scene anticipated the popular 18th-century Italian capriccio. He depicted ships' rigging and technical details with considerable accuracy, which likely shows the influence of the van de Veldes. His Dutch harbour and river views often include recreational and ceremonial aspects of shipping. He paid particular attention to the display of pleasure yachts, ceremonial gatherings of ships, the passengers and the people watching.http://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/paintings/abraham-storck-a-river- view Storck painted some winter scenes, which are inspired by the example of Jan Abrahamsz Beerstraaten and his son Anthonie Beerstraaten, a selfportrait, and some allegories.

Protozoans have little in common with each other (for example, Entamoeba histolytica, a unikont eukaryotic organism, is more closely related to Homo sapiens, which belongs to the unikont phylogenetic group, than it is to Naegleria fowleri, a bikont eukaryotic organism) and so agents effective against one pathogen may not be effective against another. They can be grouped by mechanism or by organism. Recent papers have also proposed the use of viruses to treat infections caused by protozoa. Medical Uses Antiprotozoals are used to treat protozoal infections, which include amebiasis, giardiasis, cryptosporidiosis, microsporidiosis, malaria, babesiosis, trypanosomiasis, Chagas disease, leishmaniasis, and toxoplasmosis. Currently, many of the treatments for these infections are limited by their toxicity. Outdated terminology Once upon a time protists were considered protozoans, but of late the categorization of unicellar organisms has undergone rapid development, however in literature, including scientific, there tends to persist the usage of the term antiprotozoal when they really mean anti-protist. Protists are a supercategory of eukaryota which includes protozoa. Mechanism The mechanisms of antiprotozoal drugs differ significantly drug to drug. For example, it appears that eflornithine, a drug used to treat trypanosomiasis, inhibits ornithine decarboxylase, while the aminoglycoside antibiotic/antiprotozoals used to treat leishmaniasis are thought to inhibit protein synthesis.

It currently functions as a historic house museum. History Built from 1915 to 1918, the mansion was designed by Marius Dufresne and the Parisian architect Jules Renard in the Beaux-Arts style. The architects based their plans on the Petit Trianon on the grounds of the Palace of Versailles in France. The building has forty rooms covering about 20,000 square feet. The interior was decorated with a series of murals and ceiling paintings by Guido Nincheri in the 1920s and 1930s. Known for his piety and devout religious leanings, the secular subject matter of the Ch√¢teau Dufresne's interior decor is an exception to the rest of Nincheri's artistic career. Alfred Faniel, a Belgian-born artist, also decorated the house during the same period. The mansion was built as the residence of and , two wealthy French Canadian entrepreneurs who played a major role in the history of the city of Maisonneuve (now part of Montreal). The Ch√¢teau Dufresne was originally divided into two separate households, one for each brother. In 1948, the Dufresne family sold the property to the Congregation of the Holy Cross, which used it as a pavilion annex of the Holy Cross College. In 1957, the City of Montreal became the new owner of the estate. The Holy Cross College, however, remained as tenant until 1961. The mansion then housed the Montreal Museum of Contemporary Art from 1965 to 1968, and the Montreal Museum of Decorative Arts from 1976 to 1997. The Ch√¢teau Dufresne was declared a historic monument by the Quebec government in 1976. Beginning in 1999, the building has housed the Ch√¢teau Dufresne Museum, which was renamed the in 2014. Location Ch√¢teau Dufresne is located on Sherbrooke Street East, adjacent to the Olympic Stadium and Montreal Botanical Garden, near the Pie-IX subway station.

Lini's views on socialism were inspired by Julius Nyerere's experiments in African socialism in Tanzania. Lini believed that socialism was inherently compatible with Melanesian societies and customs, including the emphasis on communal welfare over individualism and the communal ownership and working of land. In this, Nyerere's influence is perceptible as the latter stressed the similarities between socialism and traditional African ways of life. Lini was an Anglican priest and believed that socialism held close similarities with Christian values and sought to combine the two as part of a Melanesian way. In this sense, socialism was not to be revolutionary, but instead fully in line with ni-Vanuatu tradition. Although he admired Nyerere and his government sought rapprochement with countries such as Cuba and Libya, Lini believed that socialism should not necessarily entail an alliance with the Soviet Union or the Eastern bloc. Indeed, he preferred for Vanuatu to remain non-aligned and to develop closer ties with its fellow Melanesian nations (such as Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands). In 1982, he expressed hopes for an eventual Melanesian federal union and spoke of the \\"renaissance of Melanesian values\\", including \\"Melanesian socialism\\". Lini also noted that in traditional Melanesian societies \\"'[g]iving' was based on one's ability to do so. 'Receiving' was based on one's need\\". In New Caledonia, the Kanak Socialist National Liberation Front (FLNKS), an alliance of pro-independence parties, advocates the implementation of socialism along with accession to sovereignty. Independent Melanesian nations (most notably Vanuatu) have expressed support for the FLNKS.

Life and marriage Khrueakaeo first met King Vajiravudh in 1924 during a dramatic production, in which they both acted. Soon after, Khrueakaeo was renamed Suvadhana and elevated to the rank of a minor consort. Later that same year they were married at the Grand Palace in Bangkok. Although King Vajiravudh initiated many Siamese nationalistic policies of the 1920s, his queen Suvadhana was of Khmer descent of Phratabong province (Battambang).

Not soon after the King fell gravely ill, on the 24 November 1925, Suvadhana gave birth to a daughter, Princess Bejaratana Rajasuda. Exile in England left The Princess and her daughter continued to live at the Dusit Palace, raising her daughter during the reign of her husband's younger brother King Prajadhipok. In 1938, as war looms, the Princess and her daughter emigrated to the United Kingdom, following the example of Prajadhipok who went in exile there in 1935. First she lived at Fairhill Villa in Camberley, Surrey, she later moved to Brighton. During the Second World War the Princess volunteered for the British Red Cross, donating winter clothes and other equipments to British soldiers; she later received a letter of recommendation from the organization. She would spend 22 years in England, she made her own living by investing in stocks and bonds; living a comfortable lifestyle with Thai servants. Return and later life The Princess and her daughter returned to Thailand permanently in 1957. They bought some land on Sukhumvit Road Soi 38, and build the Ruenruedi Villa Palace. During her later years she carried out many royal duties and became patron of many charitable organizations.

It was commonly known in Ireland as the Ryan Commission (previously \\"the Laffoy Commission\\"), after its chair, Mr Justice Se√°n Ryan. Judge Laffoy resigned on 2 September 2003, following a departmental review on costs and resources. She felt that: \\"...the cumulative effect of those factors effectively negated the guarantee of independence conferred on the Commission and militated against it being able to perform its statutory functions.\\" The commission's work started in 1999 and it published its public report, commonly referred to as the Ryan report, on 20 May 2009. The commission's remit was to investigate all forms of child abuse in Irish institutions for children; the majority of allegations it investigated related to the system of sixty residential \\"Reformatory and Industrial Schools\\" operated by Catholic Church orders, funded and supervised by the Irish Department of Education. The commission's report said testimony had demonstrated beyond a doubt that the entire system treated children more like prison inmates and slaves than people with legal rights and human potential, that some religious officials encouraged ritual beatings and consistently shielded their orders amid a \\"culture of self-serving secrecy\\", and that government inspectors failed to stop the abuses. Among the more extreme allegations of abuse were beatings and rapes, subjection to naked beatings in public, being forced into oral sex, and subjection to beatings after failed rape attempts by brothers. The abuse has been described by some as Ireland's Holocaust. The abuse was said to be \\"endemic\\" in the institutions that dealt with boys. The UK based Guardian newspaper, described the abuse as \\"the stuff of nightmares\\", citing the adjectives used in the report as being particularly chilling: \\"systemic, pervasive, chronic, excessive, arbitrary, endemic\\". The Report's conclusions section (Chapter 6) supports the overall tenor of the accusations without exception.Ryan Report, Chapter 6; Conclusions section But, the commission's recommendations were restricted in scope by two rules imposed by the Irish government, and therefore do not include calls for the prosecution or sanction of any of the parties involved. Thr Irish government excluded other institutions survivors at the time tried go get included such as Magdalene Laundries by deeming them private. Survivors during the child abuse redress process at the last stage was gagged, while the religious orders was given protection against prosecution. Background =Historical context= Chapter 2 of the Report outlines the history of institutional assistance for children in Ireland. UK Acts of Parliament had provided for: * Reformatory schools for younger criminals from 1858, and * Industrial schools for destitute and/or orphaned children from 1868, where they could learn life skills, and be fed and educated. This was considered an improvement on the Workhouse system of poor relief. The harsh system was improved over decades, particularly by the Children Act 1908 that was enacted by the Liberal government. Though the 2009 Report deals with each type of school separately, they and similar schools are referred to generally as \\"residential institutions\\". Where the children were from Catholic families, the Roman Catholic Church in Ireland insisted on supervising their care and upbringing by running most of these institutions in Ireland. A handful of Irish Catholic authors such as Michael McCarthySee Rome in Ireland London: Hodder & Stoughton 1904 and Frank Hugh O'DonnellSee O'Donnell's Paraguay on Shannon Hodges & Figgis, Dublin, 1908 criticised the Church's un-audited state funding, and the state's inadequate supervision in 1900‚Äì1910. They were generally ignored by the growing Nationalist movement that had firm support from the Church, and also by the British administration based in Dublin Castle. =Continuance by Irish Free State= After the establishment of the Irish Free State in 1922, little was done to update the 1908 Act or to ensure that its rules were observed, particularly those on corporal punishment. The purpose of the Act was to humanise reformatory and industrial schools and orphanages, and to reduce physical punishment. The 1908 Act regulations remained in force in Ireland almost unchanged until the 1970s, while elsewhere in Europe more progressive regimes developed, mainly after 1945. In contrast, the 1941 Children's Act, drafted while √âamon de Valera was briefly Minister of the Department of Education, reduced the minimum age of inmates to below 6 years, allowing small children to be detained because of their parents' poverty. From the 1850s on day-to-day management had passed to several Orders affiliated to the Irish Catholic Church, as it insisted on educating its younger members. Oversight was the duty of the British administration in Ireland, and then of the Irish Department of Education from 1922 on. 5 Protestant schools had also existed, with the last one closing in 1917. Maintenance costs were paid by the department on a capitation (head-counting) basis, but the internal accounts of each school were never published. Over decades the Orders would typically answer any official complaint by pointing to the low capitation amount. A major review of the system by Thomas Derrig in 1933-36 left it largely unchanged, as did the 1941 Children's Act. It has been suggested that Derrig refused to reform the system in line with the British reforms of 1923 and 1933 because of his strongly anti-British stance during the Irish independence process in 1916‚Äì23.Arnold, B. The Irish Gulag Gill & Macmillan, Dublin 2009. at page 41. The critical Cussen Report (1936) that followed, and a report in 1946-48 by the Irish-American priest Father Flanagan, were shelved. Archbishop McQuaid of Dublin sought a private report on Artane from Father Moore in 1962, but this was also shelved. Other bodies such as the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (ISPCC; before 1956 the NSPCC) were also involved in sending needy children to the institutions, for want of alternatives. Some 60% of their cases were referred by the parents. In the 1940s the Society had pointed out that higher social welfare payments to poor families would be cheaper than paying the capitation amounts to industrial schools. The numbers of child inmates peaked in the early to mid-1940s. Numbers declined after the introduction of \\"children's allowance\\" payments in the 1940s. The Adoption Act 1952 and increased wealth and other social welfare measures reduced the number of needy children in the 1950s. Family shame often sent the mothers of illegitimate children to similarly-run Magdalen Asylums. =Reform starts in the 1960s= The OECD reported on Irish schools and levels of education in 1962‚Äì68, as an essential part of the process of Ireland's 1973 accession into the EEC, providing the vital external stimulus for reform.Arnold B., op.cit., chapter 5. Finally the 1970 Kennedy Report, prepared in 1967‚Äì70, though flawed in parts, led to the abolition of the schools over the next decade, starting with Artane in 1969. In the interim, tens of thousands of children had been inmates, some from infancy. Despite frequent complaints and enquiries that called for reforms, the official line until the 1990s was that nobody in government, the church or the civil service really knew what was taking place. Notably, Micheal Martin stated on 13 May 1999 that: The concept of the child as a separate individual with rights came late to this country.Statement of 13 May 1999; see Arnold, B. op. cit., page 16. The CICA legislation, 1999-2005 A series of media revelations in the 1990s led to legal actions by former inmates that the government realised would succeed, resulting in substantial damages and legal costs. Principally the \\"States of fear\\" television series made by Mary Raftery for RT√â caused questions to be raised in the D√°il in April 1999. The Taoiseach Bertie Ahern promptly apologised in May 1999: On behalf of the State and of all citizens of the State, the Government wishes to make a sincere and long overdue apology to the victims of childhood abuse for our collective failure to intervene, to detect their pain, to come to their rescue. In April‚ÄìMay 2000 his government passed the \\"Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse Act, 2000\\". The institutions were renamed \\"residential institutions\\" inclusively comprising \\"a school, an industrial school, a reformatory school, an orphanage, a hospital, a children‚Äôs home and any other place where children are cared for other than as members of their families.'' *The CICA was initially envisaged as an independent statutory body for the former inmates to record their experiences. *A \\"Redress Board\\" was created alongside CICA under a 2002 Act, and would pay compensation as recommended. CICA's investigations were made through two sub-committees: * A Confidential Committee that allowed the complainants to recite their experiences \\"in a confidential setting\\". * A more pro-active Investigation Committee where witnesses could be compelled to attend.Ryan Report, sections 1.07-1.16. Though funded by the Department of Education, the CICA has found itself occasionally hindered by it and by various church bodies, particularly for lack of documents. As a result, its first chairman, Judge Laffoy, resigned in 2003, in part because of a lengthy review process that caused a 9-month delay. This review was sponsored by the Department and headed by Se√°n Ryan, a senior barrister, who then became CICA's next chairman. Mr Ryan's appointment was accompanied by a government comment by Noel Dempsey that he was also to be made a judge. This was a surprise at the time, as Irish High Court judges are limited in number by law, and no vacancies then existed.Arnold B., op.cit., pp. 215-216. Questions arose on the impartiality of CICA, but in the event its final Report has been thoroughly researched. CICA's limitations were imposed by the 2000 Act, and it reconsidered its approach and focus in the \\"Emergence Hearings\\" which began in mid-2004, requiring all the parties involved to complete a series of questionnaires.Emergence Hearings; Ryan Report section 2, 141-146. It also published a number of interim reports. Following the Emergence Hearings the 2000 Act was amended by a further Act in 2005. A principal reform (section 8) was to prohibit the identification of an alleged abuser unless convicted of the abuse in question. Notably, while every witness to the Commission gave evidence of frequent corporal punishment, applied contrary to the regulations and therefore criminally, no Church witness came forward to certify a single such case. Difficulties arose where complainants or the accused were involved in parallel criminal or civil cases, such as the vaccine trials performed on inmate children. With such divergent views the CICA's task has been difficult and contentious, but it has agreed with the evidence given by the complainants. Given Mr. Ahern's general apology in 1999, it would be hard to conclude otherwise.  Establishment and functions  The commission was first established on an administrative basis in May 1999, under Judge Mary Laffoy. The first objective set for the commission was to consider the broad terms of reference then provided to it, determine if these needed refining, and recommend to Government the powers and safeguards it would need to do its work effectively. The Commission reported to the Government in September and October 1999. The commission to Inquire into Child Abuse Act, 2000 (the Act) was enacted on 26 April 2000.Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse Act 2000, at www.irishstatutebook.ie The 2000 Act followed closely the recommendations in the reports of the non-statutory Commission, and was extended by the commission to Inquire into Child Abuse (Amendment) Act, 2005. The Statutory Commission established under the 2000‚Äì2005 Acts had four primary functions: * to listen to victims of childhood abuse who want to recount their experiences to a sympathetic forum; * to fully investigate all allegations of abuse made to it, except where the victim does not wish for an investigation; * to consider whether the way institutions were managed, administered, supervised and regulated contributed to the occurrence of abuse and * to publish a report on its findings to the general public, with recommendations to address the effects of abuse on those who suffered and to prevent future abuse of children in institutions. A \\"child\\" was defined to be anyone under the age of 18, an \\"institution\\" was any place where children were cared for other than as members of their families, and four types of abuse were included in the commission's mandate: * Physical abuse ‚Äì infliction of, or failure to prevent, physical injury to the child. * Sexual abuse ‚Äì the use of the child for sexual arousal or sexual gratification. * Neglect ‚Äì failure to care for the child which risks or causes serious impairment or serious adverse effects. * Emotional abuse ‚Äì any other acts or omissions towards the child which risk or cause serious impairment or serious adverse effects. The Commission worked through two complementary teams. The \\"Confidential Committee\\" provided a private forum for witnesses to \\"recount in full the abuse suffered by them in an atmosphere that is sympathetic to, and understanding of, them, and as informally as is possible in the circumstances.\\" [¬ß4 (b) of the 2005 Act]. This committee's report was not permitted to identify witnesses, or persons against whom they made allegations, or the institutions in which they alleged they were abused. There was \\"no opportunity for anyone involved to challenge the veracity of the statements made.\\" The \\"Investigation Committee\\" on the other hand heard evidence from witnesses who wished to have their allegations investigated. For this reason, respondents from Religious Orders and others could also give evidence and might be compelled to attend and/or produce documents required by the committee. All parties were entitled to legal representation and to cross examine. 26 public hearings were held in 2005 and transcripts published, but most hearings were held in private.  Public report  The commission's report was published on 20 May 2009 in five volumes with an executive summary containing 43 conclusions and 20 recommendations. =Conclusions= Conclusions included: Overall. Physical and emotional abuse and neglect were features of the institutions. Sexual abuse occurred in many of them, particularly boys' institutions. Schools were run in a severe, regimented manner that imposed unreasonable and oppressive discipline on children and even on staff. Physical abuse. The Reformatory and Industrial Schools depended on rigid control by means of severe corporal punishment and the fear of such punishment. A climate of fear, created by pervasive, excessive and arbitrary punishment, permeated most of the institutions and all those run for boys. Children lived with the daily terror of not knowing where the next beating was coming from. Sexual abuse. Sexual abuse was endemic in boys' institutions. The schools investigated revealed a substantial level of sexual abuse of boys in care that extended over a range from improper touching and fondling to rape with violence. Perpetrators of abuse were able to operate undetected for long periods at the core of institutions. When confronted with evidence of sexual abuse, the response of the religious authorities was to transfer the offender to another location where, in many instances, he was free to abuse again. The safety of children in general was not a consideration. The situation in girls' institutions was different. Although girls were subjected to predatory sexual abuse by male employees or visitors or in outside placements, sexual abuse was not systemic in girls' schools. Neglect. Poor standards of physical care were reported by most male and female complainants. Children were frequently hungry and food was inadequate, inedible and badly prepared in many schools. Accommodation was cold, spartan and bleak. Sanitary provision was primitive in most boys' schools and general hygiene facilities were poor. Emotional abuse. Witnesses spoke of being belittled and ridiculed on a daily basis. Private matters such as bodily functions and personal hygiene were used as opportunities for degradation and humiliation. Personal and family denigration was widespread. There was constant criticism and verbal abuse and children were told they were worthless. Supervision by the Department of Education. The system of inspection by the Department was fundamentally flawed and incapable of being effective. Complaints by parents and others made to the Department were not properly investigated. The Department did not apply the standards in the rules and their own guidelines when investigating complaints, but sought to protect and defend the religious Congregations and the schools. The Department dealt inadequately with complaints about sexual abuse, which were generally dismissed or ignored. =Limits of Scope= The scope of the CICA's recommendations was limited from the outset to two categories; a limitation that has been widely criticised. In essence, the Irish taxpayer is to pay for the commission's costs and any compensation, but without knowing who exactly was to blame, and without prosecutions for what were clearly criminal acts or omissions. CICA acknowledged that it .. was required to make recommendations under two headings: :(i)To alleviate or otherwise address the effects of the abuse on those who suffered :(ii)To prevent where possible and reduce the incidence of abuse of children in institutions and to protect children from such abuse. Name and shame. It was originally intended that abusers would be publicly named in the commission's report. However the commission was blocked from doing so by a legal challenge from the Christian Brothers. The Brothers sought and received permission to deal with abusers anonymously. Thus the report does not state whether all abusers were or were not members of the religious orders in charge of the schools, or whether external parties were involved. External impact. The report does not consider the effects of the abuse on the psychological welfare of the parents of children who were in the control of the system. That at least some parents were concerned about their children was clearly shown by the lengths to which one father went to obtain the return of his children in the celebrated case in re Doyle, which was the subject of the 2002 film Evelyn. Motivation. The conclusions of the report do not consider the motivations of the abusers; although the inclusion of a financial report by the accountancy firm of Mazars, and various financial references combine to create an impression of financial motivation, this is not discussed or challenged. The report refers to, but makes no attempt to explain, the enthusiasm of the judiciary and the ISPCC for incarcerating children. =Allegations and their extent= The report dealt with allegations collected over a period of nine years between 2000 and 2008. These related to experiences between 1914 and the opening of the commission. Hearings were held in Ireland, the UK and elsewhere. Of the approximately 25,000 children who had attended the institutions in the time period concerned, around 1,500 persons came forward with complaints to the commission. Commission records show that 474 claims of physical abuse and 253 claims of sexual abuse were made by boys against the institutions in that period. Records show that 383 claims of physical abuse and 128 claims of sexual abuse were made by girls against institutions over the years concerned. These claims covered all levels of abuse from the most serious down, and were made against both religious and lay personnel. The majority of sexual abuse claims by girls were against staff that should have been supervised by the religious orders. Among some of the strongest abuse claims: one person described how they attempted to tell nuns they had been molested by an ambulance driver, only to be \\"stripped naked and whipped by four nuns to 'get the devil out of you'\\". Another described how they were removed from their bed and \\"made to walk around naked with other boys whilst brothers used their canes and flicked at their penis\\". Yet another was \\"tied to a cross and raped whilst others masturbated at the side\\".  Reactions to the report  = Irish reaction = The Irish Times called the report \\"a devastating indictment of Church and State authorities,\\" and \\"the map of an Irish hell.\\" \\"The sheer scale and longevity of the torment inflected on defenceless children ‚Äì over 800 known abusers in over 200 Catholic institutions during a period of 35 years ‚Äì should alone make it clear that it was not accidental or opportunistic but systematic. Abuse was not a failure of the system. It was the system.\\" Irish President Mary McAleese called the abuse \\"an atrocious betrayal of love\\", saying: \\"My heart goes out to the victims of this terrible injustice, an injustice compounded by the fact that they had to suffer in silence for so long.\\" Irish Minister for Finance, Brian Lenihan, called for religious orders to increase their contributions to the State compensation fund. Irish Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Dermot Ahern, said the report would be examined by members of the Garda S√≠och√°na to check for possible criminal prosecutions. A book of solidarity was opened at the Mansion House in Dublin, with more than 2,000 people having signed it by 23 May 2009. Lord Mayor of Dublin, Eibhlin Byrne, described how citizens were approaching her to personally express their solidarity as well. Cardinal Se√°n Brady (leader of the Catholic Church in Ireland) said he was \\"profoundly sorry and deeply ashamed that children suffered in such awful ways in these institutions. This report makes it clear that great wrong and hurt were caused to some of the most vulnerable children in our society. It documents a shameful catalogue of cruelty: neglect, physical, sexual and emotional abuse, perpetrated against children.\\" He declared that anyone responsible for abusing children in Catholic-run institutions should be held to account. This was echoed by Most Reverend Vincent Nichols (leader of the Catholic Church in England and Wales) \\"no matter how long ago it happened\\". Father Michael Mernagh, the 70-year-old Augustinian priest who recently made a 272 km pilgrimage from Cobh to Dublin in atonement for the church's response to clerical child sex abuse said he was appalled at the extent and longevity of the abuse, \\"particularly at the role of the state and the government that seem to have colluded in actually encouraging children to be brought into these institutions to keep up the numbers.\\" The report itself cannot be used for criminal proceedings (in part because the Christian Brothers successfully sued the commission to prevent its members from being named in the report) and victims say they feel \\"cheated and deceived\\" by the lack of prosecutions, and \\"because of that this inquiry is deeply flawed, it's incomplete and many might call it a whitewash.\\" Counselling services reported a significant rise in calls following the release of the report, with some centres being inundated despite bringing in extra volunteers. Callers included people who had never spoken of their abuse before, publication of the report having re-opened their old wounds. On 25 May 2009, the Irish Times printed the reaction of Diarmuid Martin, the Archbishop of Dublin, who said (partially quoting a correspondent), > \\"'there is always a price to pay for not responding'. The church will have > to pay that price in terms of its credibility. The first thing the church > has to do is to move out of any mode of denial. Where the church is involved > in social care it should be in the vanguard. That is different to a > situation in which the church proclaims that it is in the vanguard.... in a > very short time another report on the sexual abuse of children will be > published, this time about how such abuse was managed in the Archdiocese of > Dublin of which I am archbishop.\\" On 10 June 2009 a solidarity march for victims of abuse was held in Dublin, going from the Garden of Remembrance in Parnell Square to Leinster House.Solidarity march for abuse victims, RT√â News, 10 June 2009 = Westminster controversy = The Catholic Archbishop of Westminster, Vincent Nichols, was quoted as saying: > I think of those in religious orders and some of the clergy in Dublin who > have to face these facts from their past, which instinctively and quite > naturally they‚Äôd rather not look at. That takes courage, and also we > shouldn‚Äôt forget that this account today will also overshadow all of the > good that they also did. The quote sparked controversy,Controversy over Nichols remark, √âanna √ì Caolla√≠, The Irish Times, 21 May 2009, retrieved 29 May 2009 with John Kelly of Irish Survivors of Child Abuse, saying it was an \\"outrageous statement to make\\". = International reaction = The findings were covered by media from across the world in the days following their publication. As of 23 May 2009, letters were still being sent to The Guardian in the UK and The Sydney Morning Herald in Australia, expressing horror at the revelations. The Canberra Times described the publication as a \\"major new report\\", reporting that Australia's clergy would be examined for any links to the \\"grim sexual abuse allegations\\" from Ireland. Arab News, an English language newspaper from the Middle East, said the report made \\"appalling reading\\". The Taipei Times reported on the \\"shocking scale\\" of sexual and physical abuse in Ireland's educational institutions. American networks, including ABC News and CNN, covered the story, as did the BBC, CBC, and Sky News. Time reviewed the \\"most depraved acts\\" committed in its coverage of the story. The front page of 21 May 2009 edition of The New York Times told of \\"Ireland's shameful tragedy\\", leading to reactions describing a \\"Nuremberg trial, Irish-style, with no names, no prosecution and no court appearances.\\" In June 2009, on a visit to the Vatican, bishops Martin and Brady heard from Pope Benedict XVI that he had: \\"... urged them to establish the truth of what has happened, ensure that justice is done for all, put in place the measures that will prevent these abuses happening again, with a view to healing for survivors.\\"  2002 Compensation deal and the question of blame  A further contentious aspect arises from an \\"indemnity deal\\" signed on 5 June 2002. This was between two representatives of the Conference of Religious of Ireland (Cori) (an umbrella group representing 138 religious congregations) on behalf of 18 religious Orders that had run the residential institutions, and the then Minister Michael Woods. This indemnified the Orders from legal action, whereby any costs would now be met by the Irish taxpayer, in return for a transfer of property and assets to the government worth ‚Ç¨128 million. No representatives of the victims were involved in these negotiations. The original plan was to provide adequate funds for the Redress Board, but in the interim an unexpectedly large number of claimants has come forward. Not only was the deal inadequate to cover the costs of CICA itself, let alone any compensation, but it remained secret until revealed by the media in January 2003. Further, the deal was completed under a caretaker government, at the time of the 2002 election, on the last day possible, and could thus neither be approved by Cabinet nor be debated in the D√°il. Given that Catholic Orders insisted on educating all the children in question , it unfairly imposes indirect costs on non-Catholic or non-Christian taxpayers. In the circumstances, and given a net cost to the Irish taxpayer approaching ‚Ç¨1,000,000,000, its legality may be questioned.Labour Party comment 2009 Mr. Woods was criticised by Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny amidst calls to reopen negotiations. The religious Orders involved initially refused to reopen compensation negotiation proceedings. Then in April 2010 an agreement was announced whereby another ‚Ç¨348m would be paid.Government statement 15 April 2010 This followed negotiations in late 2009 with 18 church groups, though it seems that the letters of offer were accepted as such by government, without proof of any effort to increase the amounts offered. The 2010 announcement also confirmed for the first time that the entire process since 1999 had led to \\".. costs of well over a billion euro being incurred by the State\\". The Republic of Ireland's government is also aware of the enormous compensation awards made in the US, where prosecution of alleged criminals is more robust\\"\\". Ireland is currently (2011) undergoing a financial crisis, making it much harder to justify the costs of prosecutions and compensation. Though still a matter for debate, the indemnity deal has complicated the question of ultimate blame. For decades the Government and Department of Education were to blame for lack of oversight, various parts of the Catholic Church refused to reform internal systems, the police generally ignored complaints, and the courts sent small children to the institutions with little concern for their rights. The 2002 deal has appeared in hindsight to be a well-intentioned but unsatisfactory attempt at a quick fix. In May 2009 CORI agreed to contribute more to the envisaged higher compensation amounts. Church of Ireland Institutions Campaigners are also engaged in trying to extend the redress scheme to victims of institutional abuse in places such as the Bethany Mother and Child Home in Rathgar. Often girls \\"in trouble\\" were brought to the home by a Protestant minister. While these were affiliated to the Church of Ireland, and used by its parishioners, it is claimed the home was not run by the church itself,Graves of Bethany children 'located at Mount Jerome' by Patsy McGarry Irish Times, 21 May 2010 however members of the church sat on the board of the home and the home was designated by the Church of Ireland as a suitable place for Protestant girls on remand,Bethany Home Church of Ireland link claimed BBC Website 8 October 2010 and recognised by the courts as a place of detention.Private Lives: First Person, Derek Leinster The Guardian, 16 September 2009 The Bethany Survivors Group continues to campaign to the newly elected government for inclusion in the redress scheme. Some residential institutions founded and run by members of the Church of Ireland such as Stewart's Hospital and Miss Carr's Children's Home, due to their connection with the Eastern Health Board do come under the remit of the redress board scheme and thus, victims are entitled to petition it for compensation. These were added to the redress list following complaints and campaigns that they were being excluded. Campaigners also campaigned for a number of Protestant run children's residences and former orphanages such as The Smyly Homes which were regulated by the state, and subject to departmental inspection, to be included in the Redress scheme. There are eleven Mrs. Smyly's homes which the government has been in dialogue with over some contribution to the redress fund.Page 32., 4.123., Report into the Residential Institutions Redress Scheme - D√°il √âireann Committee of Public Accounts., March 2005 Former residents of other homes and orphanages which were designated by the Church of Ireland for Protestant children such as Westbank Orphanage, Greystones and Ovoca House in Wicklow, have demanded inclusion in the 2002 redress scheme, and an apology.Protestant homes survivors want an apology BY Laura Larkin, The Hearld, 26 June 2014.

Supported by the Government of Bangladesh, BIDS functions as a think tank, helping formulate socio-economic policies. The institute conducts research and promotes study and education in development economics, rural development, demographics and social sciences. History The Bangladesh Institute of Development Studies had its origin in Pakistan, named as the Pakistan Institute of Development Economics (PIDE) and established in June 1957. The PIDE was moved to Dhaka in January 1971. After the emergence of independent Bangladesh in 1971, the Institute was called the Bangladesh Institute of Development Economics (BIDE). Later on, a Parliamentary Charter was awarded in 1974 and the Institute was renamed as the Bangladesh Institute of Development Studies (BIDS) to reflect its multidisciplinary focus of development research. It was incorporated as an autonomous body, governed by a high powered Board of Trustees under the Chairmanship of the Minister of Planning, Government of the People's Republic of Bangladesh. Since 1974, through a process of national level institutional restructuring, two other institutions‚Äì‚Äìthe Population Study Centre and the National Foundation for Research on Human Resources Development‚Äì‚Äì were merged with BIDS in 1982 and 1983 respectively. Initially, funding for BIDS was made through regular government budgetary support. In 1983, the Government created an endowment fund to ensure a source of recurring revenue for running the Institute, thereby reducing its dependence on regular budgetary support, and enabling BIDS to enjoy more functional autonomy. In 2009, the Government provided a Research Endowment Fund of Tk. 200 million to support core institutional research of BIDS. Some donor agencies and foundations also provide resources for its activities. Publications The Publication Section publishes books, journals, policy briefs, monographs, and other reports for promoting a wide dissemination of BIDS research activities and findings. The Section, with equipment to meet the Institute's publishing requirements, also provides sales services to its local and foreign customers and promotes BIDS publication through complimentary and exchange programs. The BIDS publications have wide circulation amongst researchers, policymakers and the general readers. The Bangladesh Development Studies (BDS) is the quarterly journal of the Institute. This is published in English. It enjoys international reputation and is currently in its 35th years of publication. The BDS carries research articles, notes, and book reviews by BIDS researchers as well as by national and international scholars. The Bangladesh Unnayan Samikkhya (BUS) is published annually in Bangla. It contains articles, notes, and book reviews. It is widely read by students and researchers as well as by people of different walks of life interested in development issues.

Written by the crusading editor W. T. Stead, the series was a tour de force of Victorian journalism. With sensational crossheads, such as \\"The Violation of Virgins\\" and \\"Strapping Girls Down\\", the Maiden Tribute threw respectable Victorians into a state of moral panic, and achieved, as a consequence, the implementation of the Criminal Law Amendment Act of 1885, which raised the age of consent for girls from 13 to 16, and also re-criminalised homosexual acts.  Overview  The first instalment took up six pages. Stead attacked vice with eye-catching subheadings: \\"The Violation of Virgins\\", \\"The Confessions of a Brothel- Keeper\\", \\"How Girls Were Bought and Ruined\\". He argued that while consensual adult behaviour was a matter of private morality and not a law enforcement issue, issues rife in London existed that did require legislative prohibition, listing five main areas where the law should intervene: # \\"The sale and purchase and violation of children. # The procuration of virgins. # The entrapping and ruin of women. # The international slave trade in girls. # Atrocities, brutalities, and unnatural crimes.\\" The theme of \\"Maiden Tribute\\" was child prostitution, the abduction, procurement and sale of young English virgins to Continental \\"pleasure palaces\\". Stead took his readers to the labyrinthine streets of London (intentionally recalling the Greek myth) to its darker side, exposing the flesh trade while exposing the corruption of those officials who not only turned a blind eye but also condoned such abuse. In particular, he drew a distinction between sexual immorality and sexual criminality, and criticized those members of Parliament who were responsible for the Bill's impending \\"extinction in the House of Commons\\" and hinted that they might have personal reasons to block any changes in the law. Describing himself as an \\"investigator\\" rather than an \\"informer\\", Stead stated that he would disclose actual names and identifying details only to the two UK Archbishops, one MP, two members of the House of Lords active in criminal legislation or child protection, and a past director of the CID. = Contents of the articles = The disclosure proper began in the July 6 publication, in which Stead reveals that he had asked if genuine maiden virgins could be procured, and being told it was so, asked whether such girls were willing and consensual, or aware of the intentions planned for them: : \\"But,\\" I continued, \\"are these maids willing or unwilling parties to the transaction‚Äìthat is, are they really maiden, not merely in being each a virgo intacta in the physical sense, but as being chaste girls who are not consenting parties to their seduction?\\" He looked surprised at my question, and then replied emphatically: \\"Of course they are rarely willing, and as a rule they do not know what they are coming for.\\" \\"But,\\" I said in amazement, \\"then do you mean to tell me that in very truth actual rapes, in the legal sense of the word, are constantly being perpetrated in London on unwilling virgins, purveyed and procured to rich men at so much a head by keepers of brothels?\\" \\"Certainly,\\" said he, \\"there is not a doubt of it.\\" \\"Why,\\" I exclaimed, \\"the very thought is enough to raise hell.\\" \\"It is true,\\" he said; \\"and although it ought to raise hell, it does not even raise the neighbours.\\" : \\"But do the girls cry out?\\" \\"Of course they do. But what avails screaming in a quiet bedroom? Remember, the utmost limit of howling or excessively violent screaming, such as a man or woman would make if actual murder was being attempted, is only two minutes, and the limit of screaming of any kind is only five... But suppose the screams continue and you get uneasy, you begin to think whether you should not do something? Before you have made up your mind and got dressed the screams cease, and you think you were a fool for your pains... Once a girl gets into such a house she is almost helpless, and may be ravished with comparative safety\\". Stead commented that \\"Children of twelve and thirteen cannot offer any serious resistance. They only dimly comprehend what it all means. Their mothers sometimes consent to their seduction for the sake of the price paid by their seducer. The child goes to the introducing house as a sheep to the shambles. Once there, she is compelled to go through with it. No matter how brutal the man may be, she cannot escape\\". A madam confirmed the story for him, stating of one girl that she was rendered unconscious beforehand, and then coercively given the choice to continue or be homeless afterwards: : \\"I engaged her to be my little maid at the lodgings where I was staying. The very next day I took her off with me to London and her mother never saw her again. What became of her? A gentleman paid me ¬£13 for the first of her, soon after she came to town. She was asleep when he did it‚Äìsound asleep. To tell the truth, she was drugged. It is often done. I gave her a drowse. It is a mixture of laudanum and something else. Sometimes chloroform is used, but I always used either snuff or laudanum. We call it drowse or black draught, and they lie almost as if dead, and the girl never knows what has happened till morning. And then? Oh! then she cries a great deal from pain, but she is 'mazed, and hardly knows what has happened except that she can hardly move from pain. Of course we tell her it is all right; all girls have to go through it some time, that she is through it now without knowing it, and that it is no use crying. It will never be undone for all the crying in the world. She must now do as the others do. She can live like a lady, do as she pleases, have the best of all that is going, and enjoy herself all day. If she objects, I scold her and tell her she has lost her character, no one will take her in; I will have to turn her out on the streets as a bad and ungrateful girl. The result is that in nine cases out of ten, or ninety-nine out of a hundred, the child, who is usually under fifteen, frightened and friendless, her head aching with the effect of the drowse and full of pain and horror, gives up all hope, and in a week she is one of the attractions of the house.\\" Stead quoted a former brothel-keeper who confirmed the nature of the trade: : \\"Maids, as you call them ‚Äì fresh girls as we know them in the trade ‚Äì are constantly in request, and a keeper who knows his business has his eyes open in all directions, his stock of girls is constantly getting used up, and needs replenishing, and he has to be on the alert for likely \\"marks\\" to keep up the reputation of his house. I have been in my time a good deal about the country on these errands. The getting of fresh girls takes time, but it is simple and easy enough when, once you are in it. I have gone and courted girls in the country under all kinds of disguises, occasionally assuming the dress of a parson, and made them believe that I intended to marry them, and so got them in my power to please a good customer. How is it done? Why, after courting my girl for a time, I propose to bring her to London to see the sights. I bring her up, take her here and there, giving her plenty to eat and drink‚Äìespecially drink. I take her to the theatre, and then I contrive it so that she loses her last train. By this time she is very tired, a little dazed with the drink and excitement, and very frightened at being left in town with no friends...\\" : \\"I offer her nice lodgings for the night: she goes to bed in my house, and then the affair is managed. My client gets his maid, I get my ¬£10 or ¬£20 commission, and in the morning the girl, who has lost her character, and dare not go home, in all probability will do as the others do, and become one of my \\"marks\\"‚Äìthat is, she will make her living in the streets, to the advantage of my house. The brothel keeper's profit is, first, the commission down for the price of a maid, and secondly, the continuous profit of the addition of a newly seduced, attractive girl to his establishment. That is a fair sample case of the way in which we recruit. Another very simple mode of supplying maids is by breeding them. Many women who are on the streets have female children. They are worth keeping. When they get to be twelve or thirteen they become merchantable. For a very likely \\"mark\\" of this kind you may get as much as ¬£20 or ¬£40...\\" =Ramifications= Background The 'Tribute' series is an example of 'Government by Journalism', since it led to the passage of the Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885, also known as the 'Stead Act' or 'Stead's Act'. From its inception, one of the goals of the series was to influence public policy. W. T. Stead wrote of the connection between the 'Tribute' series and his 'Government by Journalism' in his publication The Review of Reviews: \\"The Pall Mall Gazette, however, held its hand. Its object being to pass a new law, and not to pillory individuals, there was no need to mention names.\\" Aftermath Stead and several of his accomplices were later brought to trial as a result of the unlawful investigative methods they used (see the Eliza Armstrong case) and Stead himself served three months in prison. Stead's reports were an early but potent example of a 'new journalism' which was not afraid of creating a 'news-event' rather than just plain reporting. According to Roland Pearsall, \\"it was the death knell of responsible journalism\\".Roland Pearsall (1969) The Worm in the Bud: The World of Victorian Sexuality: 373 Stead's account was widely translated and the revelation of \\"padded rooms for the purpose of stifling the cries of the tortured victims of lust and brutality\\" and the symbolic figure of \\"The Minotaur of London\\" confirmed European observers' worst imaginings about \\"Le Sadisme anglais\\" and inspired erotic writers to write of similar scenes set in London or involving sadistic English gentlemen. Such writers include D'Annunzio in Il Piacere, Paul-Jean Toulet in Monsieur de Paur (1898), Octave Mirbeau in Jardin des Supplices (1899) and Jean Lorrain in Monsieur de Phocas (1901).Mario Praz (1970) The Romantic Agony. Oxford University Press: 443-451 The title evokes the Greek myth of the Minotaur's virgins tribute.

Situated in a Grade 2* listed building, it hosts five galleries and an exhibition programme that celebrates the best of historic and contemporary British art.  History  The Royal West of England Academy was the first art gallery to be established in Bristol, and is one of the longest-running regional galleries and art schools in the UK. Its foundation was initiated by the extraordinary Ellen Sharples, who secured funding from benefactors including Isambard Kingdom Brunel and Prince Albert, and the building was ultimately financed by a bequest of ¬£2,000 from her will in 1849. At first, the core of the Academy was a well-known group of artists in Bristol, known as the Bristol Society of Artists, who were mostly landscape painters, and many, such as William James M√ºller, Francis Danby, James Baker Pyne and John Syer were well known. In 1844, when the Bristol Academy for the Promotion of Fine Arts was founded, the Bristol Society of Artists was incorporated into it. At this time the president and committee was predominantly its patrons, rather than its artists. In 1913 King George V granted the academy its Royal title, with the reigning monarch as its Patron, and by 1914 a major extension to the front of the building, including the dome and Walter Crane lunettes, was completed. During World War II the academy building was taken over by various organisations including the Bristol Aeroplane Company and the U.S. Army. Immediately after the war ended the council applied for the release of the galleries but was informed that they would be occupied by the Inland Revenue until further notice. It was not until 1950 that the building was returned to its original function, after the intervention of the then prime minister, Clement Attlee. During the 1950s the Royal West of England Academy Schools became the West of England College of Art. This moved to the Bower Ashton campus in 1966, where it was then absorbed by the University of the West of England (School of Visual Studies), now the Department of Creative Industries, UWE, Bristol. The current president is the artist Fiona Robinson PRWA and Director (Chief Exec) is Alison Bevan BEM.  Collections  Among the paintings in the permanent collection are works by artists from the Newlyn, St Ives and Bloomsbury Schools and paintings by Elizabeth Blackadder, Bernard Dunstan, Mary Fedden, Matthew Hale, David Inshaw, Derek Balmer, Anne Redpath, George Swaish and Carel Weight.  Building  RWA Galleries Marble Gallery Friezes Walter Crane Lunettes The building is a grade II* listed building constructed in 1857 as the city's first public art gallery, also encompassing an art school. It opened in 1858. The interiors are by Charles Underwood and facade by JR Hirst, altered in 1912 by SS Reay and H Dare Bryan. The first floor is in 3 sections, the outer ones articulated by paired Corinthian pilasters flanking large shell head niches with statues of Flaxman and Reynolds. A large carving of 3 female figures - the three graces - crowns the parapet. The interior includes coloured marble and a replica of the Parthenon Frieze.

Career =Club= Born in Merryton, Lanarkshire, Cairns made his name in Junior football, helping Burnbank Athletic to the Scottish Junior Cup in 1911. He also appeared for Larkhall Thistle before earning an opportunity in the senior leagues. His first professional club was Bristol City where he played for two seasons from 1911. He joined Peebles Rovers in 1913 and had a short spell with St Johnstone before joining Rangers in November 1913. He made his debut against Hamilton Academical on 27 December 1913 and played a total of nine games in his first season as Rangers finished second to rivals Celtic in Division One. Cairns was a regular in the Rangers team the following season, missing just one league game. He continued to be a regular in the team for the next two seasons but it was in season 1917‚Äì18 that he won his first League title (Rangers' first for five years). Cairns was an ever-present and scored 11 goals.

Campo Ligure borders the following municipalities: Bosio, Masone, Rossiglione, Tiglieto.  Geography  It is located in the center of the intersection of the rivers Stura, Angassino and Ponzema, from Genoa, and part of its territory to the west is within the boundaries of the Parco naturale regionale del Beigua, while in the east borders the Parco delle Capanne di Marcarolo.  History  The place name refers to a 3rd-century AD Roman fortified settlement built during the reign of Emperor Aurelian, reinforced by the Byzantines in the 6th century. The first parish, San Michele, is probably dating back to the 10th century. Between the 12th and 13th century various families led the administration of Campo, until the year 1329, when it becomes a small fief within the Holy Roman Empire, surrounded by the territory of the Republic of Genoa. In July 1600 the Republic of Genoa increased control of the small enclave, banishing any local opposition to its rule. In the 18th century the town saw a gradual buildup of manufacturing activities (iron production and processing, silk spinning mills, paper mills, lime pits, forestry and agriculture), as well as the birth of the republican municipality, which joined the Ligurian Republic in 1797. In 1805 the town, then called Campo Freddo, was included in the French Empire of Napoleon I; after the 1815 Congress of Vienna it became part of the Kingdom of Sardinia. In 1884 the village's name was changed from Campo Freddo (derived from ‚Äúfeudo‚Äù -fief- or possibly the German word ‚Äúfrei‚Äù -free- ) to Campo Ligure. That year also saw the opening of the first goldsmith shop dedicated to filigree.  Economy  The country's economic activity is mainly connected to the processing of filigrana and crafts and the textile industry and mechanical engineering. The filigrana (filigree) is very fine gold and silver threads, hand crafted using simple pliers (the ‚Äúbruscelle‚Äù) and a welding torch: filigree is the centerpiece of typical Campo Ligure craft. The first shop was opened in 1884; then in a short span of time the town became the national center for this precious artistic production.

As a young artist, Bates was an understudy of Irene Beck. He also was a student of Natalie Hinderas at the Esther Boyer College of Music at Temple University in Philadelphia. While growing up, Leon Bates divided his time between two disparate passions: the pursuit of music and the physically demanding sport of body building. According to Karima A. Haynes, Leon Bates grew up defying stereotypes. Bates claims that the two disciplines have synergistic benefits. \\"The last piece on the program is the one that is the most demanding and dynamic. You don‚Äôt want to run out of energy as you are coming to the piece that demands the most from you. (Haynes qtd Bates 164).\\" Career Bates has toured the world, performing with many symphonies. In the United States, he has performed with both Philadelphia and Cleveland Orchestras, as well as New York and Los Angeles Philharmonics. He also performed with various symphonies such as Atlanta, Boston, Detroit and the San Francisco Symphonies. In Europe, he has performed with various orchestras including Vienna and Basel Symphonies, the Radio-Orchestra of Dublin, the Strasbourg Philharmonic, Orchestra Sinfonica dell‚ÄôAccademia Nazionale di Santa Cecilia, the Czech National Symphony Orchestra, Malm√∂ Symphony of Sweden and more. One of his most highly regarded performances was with Lorin Maazel at the Orchestra of France.
