(credited as Caltron Ind. Inc.), a Taiwan-based video game company which was either closely related to, or simply a pseudonym for, NTDEC. In Australia, it was published under the title Real Player‚Äòs Pak by HES. Dynacom released the cartridge as Multi A√ß√£o 6-in-1 for the Brazilian market. As its title suggests, 6 in 1 consists of six different games in various genres, which mostly are popular clones of the era. It's composed of: Cosmos Cop, Adam & Eve, Magic Carpet 1001, Balloon Monster, Porter, and Bookyman. These titles were all previously released as stand-alone Famicom format by NTDEC, often under their U.S. brand Mega Soft. The compilation has received poor reviews, with one reviewer claiming that all six games on the multicart are \\"uniformly awful [and] barely first-generation NES quality\\", even though they are more playable and are of \\"much higher quality\\" than other unlicensed video game compilations, specifically citing Active Enterprises' infamous Action 52 as the comparative example. Games * Cosmos Cop is a pseudo-3D into-the-screen shoot 'em up similar to Sega's Space Harrier. However, the game experiences a lot of image breakup on the screen due to the NES's limited capability of handling first-person scaling. * Magic Carpet 1001 is a horizontal scrolling shooter that was later released on pirate cartridges as Aladdin III, and with some graphical and sound modifications as Super Harry Potter. Besides being the only original title on the cartridge, it has been criticized for its steep difficulty curve. * Balloon Monster is a clone of Mitchell's arcade game Pang (Buster Bros. in North America). * Adam & Eve is a single-screen platform game similar to Balloon Fight by Nintendo (itself based on Joust by Williams Electronics), in which the player has to kill snakes by bursting the balloons attached to their heads. It also received criticism in that had very little relevance to the homonym biblical story. * Porter is a puzzle video game similar to Thinking Rabbit's Sokoban and Boxxle (the first was created by Hiroyuki Imabayashi), where the player has to move boxes into specifically‚Äìmarked places. Criticized for its controls; boxes can only be moved while holding down the A button, and if the B button is accidentally pressed, the level automatically restarts without any warning to the player. * Bookyman is a direct Brush Roller hack, the clone of another arcade game: Alpha Denshi's Crush Roller (Make Trax in North America and Europe), programmed by Hwang Shinwei in 1990. Both were considered inferior to their arcade counterpart. Myriad version Myriad 6 in 1 cartridge When Caltron Industries, Inc. was going out of business, a company based in Kingwood, Texas named Myriad Games, Inc., bought all of their existing inventory of tan cartridges. Myriad then took the carts and added a very generic (no graphic art) label. They were then packaged in custom boxes with a folded manual. Each Myriad cart and box were numbered individually. Myriad's only change to Caltron's product was to replace the label with their own. In fact, the edges of the Caltron label are still visible, as the Myriad label is slightly too small to cover it. No programming changes were done, hence the game is exactly the same, including the title screen which still reads \\"Caltron\\". The six games on the cart are identical to Caltron's release. Shortly after the release of 6 in 1, Myriad went out of business for unknown reasons. The game has become one of the rarest unlicensed games made for the NES. Collectors speculate that fewer than 100 copies of this game still exist, and even fewer are complete. The most valuable copies of the game are those with the box, instructions and cartridge with matching serial numbers. The lowest known serial number is 000003 and the highest is 000888. At least two sealed versions are known to exist.http://www.gamesniped.com/2009/10/14/myriad-games- caltron-6-in-1-nintendo-nes/ References Category:1992 video games Category:Nintendo Entertainment System games Category:Nintendo Entertainment System-only games Category:Single-player video games Category:Video game compilations Category:Unauthorized video games Category:Video games developed in Taiwan ","title":"Caltron 6 in 1"},{"id":"428749","text":"Jacob \\"Jake\\" Sisko is a fictional character in the Star Trek franchise. He appears in the television series Star Trek: Deep Space Nine (DS9) and is portrayed by actor Cirroc Lofton. He is the son of Deep Space Nine commanding officer, Benjamin Sisko. The character has also been utilized in various books, comics, and video games of the Star Trek franchise. Overview Jake was born in 2355 to Jennifer Sisko, who was killed in 2367 during the Battle of Wolf 359 when Benjamin Sisko served aboard USS Saratoga (Jake was portrayed by Thomas Hobson for the Saratoga scene). In 2369, he reluctantly moved with his father to space-station Deep Space Nine. Jake soon becomes friends with a Ferengi named Nog, son of Rom, despite the disapproval of both of their fathers. Jake and Nog become the first students to enroll in Keiko O'Brien's school. When Rom pulls Nog out of school, Jake secretly tutors him. The pair also briefly form the \\"No-Jay Consortium\\" as a front for their business schemes. Jake aspires to be a writer, though he declines a scholarship to the Pennington School (New Zealand) in 2371. He briefly dates a Bajoran dabo girl named Mardah against the approval of his father, who embarrasses Jake by revealing his penchant for dom-jot hustling and poetry. In 2372, Jake writes a draft of his first novel, Anslem, under the influence of Onaya, an alluring alien woman who feeds on creative neural energy by tactile absorption through the cranium (\\"The Muse\\"). As Jake becomes a young adult and feels the need for independence, he moves out of his father's quarters to become roommates with Nog, who is now a Starfleet Academy cadet on DS9 for field study. Jake's slovenliness and Nog's new-found neatness initially strain their friendship, until Benjamin Sisko, as Nog's commander and Jake's father, orders them to settle their differences. In an alternate timeline (\\"The Visitor\\"), Benjamin Sisko is thrust into an odd sub-space dimension after being struck by an errant energy bolt in the USS Defiant engine room. After the accident, Sisko is presumed dead, but he later appears to Jake several times throughout Jake's life. After a short but successful career as a novelist (including the publication of Anslem), Jake spends the rest of his life trying to understand and reverse the accident. Jake learns that since he and his father were in proximity when the accident occurred, a strange side effect has been causing Jake to act as a sort of anchor to his father in sub-space through the years, occasionally pulling Benjamin Sisko into the true world. Jake determines that if he takes his own life during one of these visits, the connection will be severed and Ben will return to the time of the accident. When he is dying (of natural causes, as an old man) Jake releases his father during a final \\"visit\\" and his father returns to the past, dodges the energy bolt and prevents this timeline from occurring (Jake as an older man is portrayed in this episode by Tony Todd). Jake introduces his father to Kasidy Yates, a freighter captain. The elder Sisko becomes romantically involved with Yates and marries her in the closing months of the Dominion War. During the Dominion occupation of Deep Space Nine, Jake remains there and serves as a reporter for the Federation News Service, though most of his work is suppressed by Weyoun and the Dominion authorities. Nevertheless, he is able to secretly send messages to his father through Morn. Jake Sisko does not have a counterpart in the Mirror Universe. Mirror counterparts of Benjamin and Jennifer exist there, but they separated before having a child. In the series finale, Benjamin Sisko joins the Prophets, and although Jake is still at DS9 for the final scene of the series, it is not clear if he remains there. In the season two episode \\"Shadowplay\\", Jake's age is stated as 15. This puts him at about 20 by the series end.

It has a population of about 300. It includes the nearby Britannia Creek, a small to mid-sized stream that flows into Howe Sound that was historically one of North America's most polluted waterways. The community first developed between 1900 and 1904 as the residential area for the staff of the Britannia Mining and Smelting Company. The residential areas and the mining operation were physically interrelated, resulting in coincidental mining and community disasters through its history. Today, the town is host to the Britannia Mine Museum, formerly known as the British Columbia Museum of Mining, on the grounds of the old Britannia Mines. The mine's old Concentrator facilities, used to separate copper ore from its containing rock, are a National Historic Site of Canada. History The first person to sail the South Western inlet of what is now British Columbia was George Vancouver in 1792. When surveying the waters, George Vancouver gave name to the area, Howe Sound, in honour of Admiral Richard Howe. Britannia Beach took its name from the nearby Britannia Range of mountains, which form the east wall of the mountainous shore of Howe Sound south of Britannia Beach. About 1859 Royal Navy hydrographer Captain Richards of HMS Plumper named the range of mountains for HMS Britannia, the third of a series of vessels to bear that name. The Britannia was never in these waters. Britannia Beach by Howe Sound =Copper mine (1888-1974)= Britannia Mine Museum, at Britannia Beach, BC A copper discovery on Britannia Mountain by Dr. A. A. Forbes in 1888 led to the development of the Britannia Mine. 10 years after Dr. A. A. Forbes discovered copper, Oliver Furry made 5 claims in the surrounding area. In 1899, a mining engineer named George Robinson was able to convince financial backers that the property had great potential. For several years, companies were formed, merged and dissolved in efforts to raise capital. Large scale mining began in 1903 with the completion of a concentrator that had a 200 ton capacity which was funded by Grant B. Schley. The Britannia Mining and Smelting Company, a branch of the Howe Sound Company, finally commenced mining in the early 1900s, and owned the site for the next sixty years. The first ore was shipped to the Crofton Smelter on Vancouver Island in 1904, and the mine achieved full production in 1905. A town had grown up around the mine and a post office opened on January 1, 1907 where it was named after the nearby mine. In 1912 John Wedderburn Dunbar Moodie was authorized to upgrade the operation and increase production from the mine. Improvements in the mineral separation processes stimulated plans for a new mill (No. 2), which was completed in 1916 and was capable of producing 2000 tons of ore per day. The onset of World War I increased the demand for copper and the price rose sharply. On March 21, 1915 an avalanche destroyed the Jane Camp. Sixty men, women and children were killed and it was a terrible blow to the tiny community. Construction began immediately on a new, safer town at the level above the Britannia Beach site. This portion of the community became known as the \\"Town site\\" or \\"Mount Sheer\\". In March 1921 during a brief period when the mine was shut down, mill No. 2 burnt to the ground. On October 28, 1921 after a full day of torrential rain, a massive flood destroyed much of that portion of the community and mine operations that existed on the lower beach area. 50 of 110 homes were destroyed and thirty-seven men, women and children lost their lives. The flood was caused because the mining company had dammed up a portion of the Creek during the construction of a railway, and when this dam gave way the town below was flooded. Carleton Perkins Browning directed the reconstruction of this portion of the community and the new No. 3 mill, which stands today. Being an isolated, close knit community which could only be accessed by boat, life in both of Britannia's towns was never dull. The Britannia Mining and Smelting Company tried to minimize turnover by providing amenities and implementing family-friendly policies. Facilities included libraries, club rooms, billiard rooms, swimming pools, tennis courts and even bowling. A thriving social calendar saw sporting events, theatrical productions, dances, movies and parties held throughout the year. The mine boomed in the late 1920s and early 1930s, becoming the largest producer of copper in the British Commonwealth by 1929, under the management of the mine manager C.P. Browning. In the 1940s there were talks to build an artist village in Britannia's hills, but that plan did not proceed. Miners unionized in 1946 and suffered through their first strike. Low copper prices saw the Britannia Mine Company reduced to seven employees, and in 1959 it went into liquidation. In 1963 the Anaconda Mining Company bought the property and production continued for the next eleven years. 300 employees managed to produce 60,000 tons of concentrate each year. Ferries services stopped around May 1965 after the highway and railway connections had been constructed. The connections made it easier to transport the copper, but high operating costs and taxes eventually forced the mine to close on November 1, 1974. The company did not attempt to clean up the mine and chemical wastes that it produced, since environmental protection laws had not yet been enacted and enforcement of the Fisheries Act was never applied. A newly elected labour government presented higher anticipated union costs and the ore vein had already been 'highgraded'. With the closure of the mine, the economy of the town diminished rapidly, and the railway station shut down soon after. Residents responded to the closure of the mine with a museum plan, preserving the copper concentrator and other historic buildings as part of the British Columbia Mining Museum [now Britannia Mine Museum].  Population (1888-1974)  Though the early settlers of Britannia Beach were primarily single white men, the company town was considered quite diverse. According to the Britannia Mine Museum: \\"Workers at the Britannia Mine came from far and wide. It was recorded that people from 50 nationalities came to work here. Most of those came from Canada and Europe - for example in 1948, 48% of workers were Canadian, 47% were European, 2% were classed as 'Oriental', and 1% was American.\\" Though there was a minor Asian population in Britannia Beach, they played a prominent role in the town. Since Bill No. 47 was passed in 1900 by the Canadian Government, Japanese and Chinese workers were not permitted to work underground, but were able to take jobs above the ground. Britannia Creek pollution Britannia Beach as seen from above Woodfibre. The Mount Sheer and Jane Basin camps sat in the high valley in the upper left of the photo. Ore was brought down by surface tramways and tunnels. Prior to the reclamation work undertaken by the University of British Columbia and the Provincial Government, the clear and transparent water in Britannia Creek suggested a pristine environment, however the clear water was actually an indication that no living creatures could survive in it. The water could not be consumed by humans either. Although mining at Britannia Creek stopped in 1974, runoff and rainwater that flow through the mine's abandoned tunnels combine with oxygen and the high sulfide content of the waste rock to create a condition called acid rock drainage (ARD). As a result of ARD, Britannia Creek became severely polluted. And, for close to a century prior to December, 2001, polluted run-off was being deposited directly into Howe Sound via Jane Creek and Britannia Creek; as much as 450 kilograms (close to one thousand pounds) of copper was entering Howe Sound daily. Britannia Beach pier debris in polluted waters of Howe Sound. The surviving piles of the Union Steamship dock. A strip of coastal waters along Britannia Beach was seriously polluted, affecting 4.5 million juvenile chum salmon from the Squamish Estuary. A federal fisheries report revealed that spring salmon held in cages off Britannia Creek died in less than 48 hours because of the toxic metals in the water, whereas fish held off Porteau Cove to the south, had a 100% survival rate. In the summer of 2001, the Province of British Columbia formally announced that a large-scale treatment plant would be built to neutralize the run-off coming from the old mine site. Although the treatment plant did not become fully operational until 2006, its construction marked a pivotal turning point for Howe Sound and the community of Britannia Beach. The plant, now operated by EPCOR Utilities, treats an average of 4.2 billion liters of run- off annually, removing an average of 226,000 kilograms of heavy metal contaminants. Tunnel Dam on Britannia Creek Engineers from the Centre for Environmental Research in Minerals, Metals, and Materials at The University of British Columbia also installed a concrete plug in the Level adit in December 2001 as the initial step in constructing a more substantial Millennium Plug. The idea for the installation was to create a laboratory to study ways to seal mine adits using bulk materials. At the same time the installation would immediately stop all pollution from the 2200 Level into Jane Creek, a tributary of Britannia Creek. Field monitoring done in 2003, using intertidal algae and mussels as ecological indicators, showed that the recovery of coastal biological communities was actually minimal. However, recovery of Britannia Creek was significant and the amount of copper and zinc in the total discharge waters declined by about 20%. As part of the reclamation work undertaken by the Provincial government, they are undertaking an environmental monitoring program the recovery of Britannia Creek and Howe Sound. Initial assessments show significant recovery, however, the Provincial government has not yet completed its comprehensive environmental impact assessment to confirm this conclusion. Following completion of the Water Treatment Plant it was estimated that 90% of the pollution to Howe Sound had been stopped. Optimization of the groundwater management system by 2008, further increased the reduction to 98-99%. In 2011, pink salmon returned to Britannia Creek for the first time in over a century. Other species that have returned to Howe Sound include killer whales and Pacific white-sided dolphins are now regularly seen near the creek's outlet.  Events and Activities  During its successful years, Britannia Beach had many events for people to enjoy. The first of these being Miners Day. This was a day of celebration to honour those who kept the town going, the miners. Many events took place during Miners day which included drilling, mucking, diving (aquatic), running, and bicycle decorating competitions. The second major event was the Copper Queen pageant which was held from 1926 to 1966 during Victoria Day celebrations in May. The school children voted who should be named as Britannia Beach's Copper Queen and with each new Queen came a different variation of the crown she was presented, making each year unique to their own. Being Copper Queen had some responsibilities too as they had to attend local events and holiday festivities during their reign. Although Britannia Beach was essentially remote until the 1950s, there were plenty of recreational activities for everyone. In an interview with the Vancouver Sun, former resident Frances McKilligan stated that \\"Sports clubs, amateur theatre, hobby clubs and annual community celebrations took place throughout the year. Dances, parties, movies and picnics were held and there were ample areas for hiking, swimming and fishing with the beautiful Howe Sound as a backdrop.\\" In the media The 2010 episode of the US TV show Psych, Dual Spires, was filmed almost entirely in Britannia Beach. In 2017, many scenes for The Crossing (TV series) were filmed in and around the village. In the same year, scenes for Travelers (TV series) were also shot in Britannia Beach. An important scene of The X-Files episode Paper Clip was filmed at Britannia Mine.

Rommel's policies were described as tolerant and liberal, and he was one of the most popular municipal politicians in Germany. He was the recipient of numerous foreign honours. He was the only son of Wehrmacht field marshal Erwin Rommel and his wife Lucia Maria Mollin (1894‚Äì1971), and contributed to the establishment of museums in his father's honour. He was also known for his friendship with George Patton IV and David Montgomery, the sons of his father's two principal military adversaries.The sons of wartime generals who became great friends Background and family Rommel was born in Stuttgart and entered service as a Luftwaffenhelfer (air force assistant) in 1943 at age 14, serving in an anti-aircraft battery. He considered joining the Waffen SS, but his father opposed it. On 14 October 1944, he was present at his parents' house when his father was led off to be forced to commit suicide for his alleged complicity in the 20 July plot to assassinate Adolf Hitler, which was publicly portrayed by the Nazi leadership as a death resulting from a war injury. In February 1945, Rommel was dismissed from air force service and in March was conscripted into the paramilitary Reichsarbeitsdienst service. Stationed in Riedlingen at the end of April, he deserted just before the French First Army entered the town. He was taken prisoner of war, was interrogated by (among others) general Jean de Lattre de Tassigny, and disclosed the truth about his father's death.Manfred Rommel: Trotz allem heiter. Stuttgart 1998, 3rd edition, p. 77‚Äì85. Post-war life and career In 1947, he took his Abitur while studying in Biberach an der Ri√ü and went on to study law at the University of T√ºbingen. He married Liselotte in 1954 and had a daughter named Catherine.Was Macht Eigenlich...: Manfred Rommel stern.de After a stint working as a lawyer, in 1956, Rommel entered the civil service and later became state secretary in the state government of Baden-W√ºrttemberg. In 1974, Rommel succeeded Arnulf Klett as Oberb√ºrgermeister (equivalent to Mayor) of Stuttgart by winning 58.5% of the votes in the second round of elections, defeating Peter Conradi of the Social Democratic Party. He was re-elected after the first round of elections in 1982 with 69.8% and in 1990 with 71.7% of the votes. As the mayor of Stuttgart, he was also known for his effort to give the Red Army Faction terrorists who had committed suicide at the Stuttgart-Stammheim prison a proper burial, despite the concern that the graves would become a pilgrimage point for radical leftists. While Oberb√ºrgermeister of Stuttgart, Rommel began a much-publicised friendship with U.S. Army Major General George Patton IV, the son of his father's World War II adversary, General George S. Patton, who was assigned to the VII Corps headquarters near the city. Additionally, he was also friends with David Montgomery, 2nd Viscount Montgomery of Alamein, the son of his father's other great adversary, Field Marshal Bernard Law Montgomery, a friendship viewed by some as a symbol of British-German reconciliation following the War and West Germany's admission into NATO. In a 1996 celebration at the W√ºrttemberg State Theatre, Manfred Rommel received the highest German civil distinction, the Bundesverdienstkreuz. In his speech, Helmut Kohl put particular emphasis on the good relations that were kept and built upon between France and Germany during Rommel's tenure as Oberb√ºrgermeister of Stuttgart. A few days after this distinction was given to Rommel, the city of Stuttgart offered him the Honorary Citizen Award. He risked his popularity when he stood out for the fair treatment of foreign immigrants, who were being drawn to Stuttgart by its booming economy.Dan van der Vat, Manfred Rommel obituary, The Guardian, 7 November 2013 As mayor, Rommel also exerted \\"tight control over the city's finances, reducing its debt and enabling a radical makeover of the local infrastructure, especially roads and public transport [while working]...to foster Franco- German relations.\\" Rommel's political position is described as tolerant and liberal.Manfred Rommel: Freundlich, ehrlich, demokratisch Der Tagesspiegel, vom 23. Dezember 2008. Outside politics Having retired from politics in 1996, Rommel was still in demand as an author and stirring speaker, despite suffering from Parkinson's disease. He wrote various political and humorous books. He was known for his down-to-earth and often funny sayings and quotations. Occasionally, he wrote articles for the Stuttgarter Zeitung. Rommel collaborated with Basil Liddell-Hart in the publication of The Rommel Papers, a collection of diaries, letters and notes that his father wrote during and after his military campaigns. He was awarded several foreign awards including the Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE), the French l√©gion d'honneur, the US Medal of Freedom and the highest grade of the German federal order of merit. He died on 7 November 2013, survived by his daughter Catherine.  Movies In the following movies about his father during the Second World War, Manfred Rommel was played by the following actors: * 1951: The Desert Fox: The Story of Rommel (German: Rommel, der W√ºstenfuchs) (Director: Henry Hathaway), William Reynolds as Manfred Rommel * 1962: The Longest Day (German: der l√§ngste Tag) (Director(s): Annakin/Marton/Wicki/Oswald/Zanuck), Michael Hinz as Manfred Rommel.

He served as Director of the Institute of Archaeology at University College London (UCL), and was a Fellow of both the Royal Anthropological Institute and the Society of Antiquaries. A controversial and divisive figure within archaeology, his life's work focused on eroding western dominance by broadening archaeological participation to developing countries and indigenous communities. Born in London to middle class German Jewish parents, Ucko attained his BA and PhD in the anthropology department of UCL, where he proceeded to work from 1962 to 1972, also publishing a number of significant books on archaeology. From 1972 to 1981 he worked as Principal of the Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies in Canberra, Australia, instituting measures to increase the participation of Indigenous Australian communities in their heritage. Returning to England in 1981 to teach archaeology at the University of Southampton, he became national secretary of the International Union for Prehistoric and Protohistoric Sciences (IUPPS) and was responsible for organising their eleventh congress in 1986; disagreements over whether to abide by the academic boycott of South Africa resulted in Ucko denouncing the IUPPS and founding the World Archaeological Congress (WAC), which focused on recognising current socio-political dimensions to archaeology. In 1996 he was controversially appointed director of the UCL Institute of Archaeology, overseeing largescale expansion to create the world's largest archaeology department. Also teaching there, he initiated reforms to the syllabus and forged links with the archaeological community in the People's Republic of China, co-founding the International Centre for Chinese Heritage and Archaeology. Retiring in 2005, he continued developing connections between the UK and China until his death from diabetes. Biography =Early life: 1938‚Äì1972= Peter Ucko was born in London on 27 July 1938 to German Jewish parents. His father was a professor of endocrinology who took a great interest in music, conducting orchestras and organising operas, while his mother was a child psychologist. He was sent to boarding school at Bryanston in Dorset, which he despised and left after displeasing the school authorities by refusing to play in a tennis double's match with a local girls school. Studying for a year at North West London Polytechnic, he completed his A-levels and met a number of students from developing countries, developing his staunch anti-racist views. From 1956 to 1959, he studied for an undergraduate degree in anthropology from University College London (UCL), opting for courses that focused on archaeology. Remaining at UCL, he proceeded to study for a PhD in the anthropomorphic figurines of the ancient Near East, completing it in 1962. Having placed a particular emphasis on Ancient Egypt, he came to be seen as an Egyptologist. Ucko worked in the UCL Department of Anthropology for the next decade, founding the School of Material Culture Studies. He organised two academic conferences there, which subsequently led to two edited volumes: The Domestication of Plants and Animals and Man, Settlement and Urbanism, both of which became \\"standard texts.\\" In 1967 he published Palaeolithic Cave Art, a book co-written with his girlfriend Andr√©e Rosenfeld, while the following year he published his doctoral research as a monograph titled Anthropomorphic Figurines of Predynastic Egypt and Neolithic Crete, which critiqued the claims regarding mother goddesses that had been popularised by Marija Gimbutas. =World archaeology: 1972‚Äì1996= In 1972, he was appointed Principal of the Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies in Canberra, Australia, negatively characterising it as an institution where white people were paid to study black people. Overseeing a rapid expansion, he sought to involve Indigenous Australians in the project, hiring them in the council and its committees and launching a project known as \\"Before It Is Too Late\\" to preserve indigenous culture and language. When he left to take up work elsewhere he insisted that his position be taken up by an Indigenous individual. In 1981, he was appointed Professor of Archaeology at the University of Southampton in England, taking up the position left vacant by Colin Renfrew. Pioneering new teaching methods, from 1993 to 1996 he was appointed Dean of Arts at Southampton, allowing him greater space to institute reform. Becoming national secretary of the International Union for Prehistoric and Protohistoric Sciences (IUPPS), Ucko was charged with organising the organisation's eleventh congress, which was due to take place at Southampton University in 1986. Beginning preparations in 1984, he decided to abide by the international academic boycott of South Africa and Namibia, which had been implemented to protest the apartheid system in those countries; this meant that South African and Namibian delegates would be prevented from attending the congress. The decision caused controversy in the international archaeological community and raised questions of academic freedom. Senior figures in the IUPPS argued that the congress must be open to all archaeologists \\"with no distinction of race, country or political persuasion\\", a position supported by the Society for American Archaeology. After IUPPS disavowed the conference, Ucko continued to stage it under a new banner as the World Archaeological Congress (WAC), thus developing a new international organisation committed to \\"the explicit recognition of the historical and social role, and the political context, of archaeological enquiry\\", which grew to become larger and more influential than IUPPS. =Directorship of the UCL Institute of Archaeology: 1996‚Äì2005= The entrance to the IoA. In 1996 he was appointed Director of the UCL Institute of Archaeology in central London, also taking on the role of Professor of Comparative Archaeology. His appointment to the former was not universally popular. His later successor as director, Stephen Shennan, would comment that Ucko went about his job \\"with characteristic forcefulness, making new appointments, overturning existing structures and overhauling the syllabus at all levels.\\" Ucko immediately implemented changes to the manner in which undergraduate courses were taught, based on his experiences at Southampton. Bringing in compulsory core courses for second and third years on such subjects as archaeological theory and public archaeology, he focused on generalisation at the undergraduate level, reserving specialisation for those students who went on to study at a master's degree level, expanding the number of master's degrees on offer. Taking a particular interest in the fields of public archaeology and cultural heritage studies, he appointed new staff members to teach courses in such topics, and was involved in founding the Public Archaeology journal, initially edited by honorary lecturer Neal Ascherson. Keen on increasing the IoA's publishing output, he oversaw the creation of Archaeology International, a journal that first appeared in 1998, combining the roles of the former Bulletin of the Institute of Archaeology and the Annual Report, edited by David R. Harris. After Cavendish Press, publishers of the UCL Press imprint, were bought out by Taylor and Francis, Ucko initiated successful talks with Left Coast Press for the IoA to publish future works through them. He also emphasised the importance of the artefact collections owned by UCL and IoA, believing that they had great potential as teaching aids and for public outreach. Having developed a keen interest in Chinese archaeology, he helped to forge greater links with archaeological departments in the People's Republic of China, and in conjunction with the School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS) created two joint teaching positions in Chinese archaeology. In co-operation with the School of Archaeology and Museology at Peking University, he helped UCL found the International Centre for Chinese Heritage and Archaeology (ICCHA), an institution devoted to promoting the exchange of archaeologists between Europe and China. Appointed director of ICCHA, it soon yielded several collaborative projects in training and research, and resulted in a number of scholarships for Chinese students to be trained in archaeology at UCL. Ucko retired from the position of director in 2005, at which time the UCL-IoA had become the world's largest archaeology department, with over 70 academic staff and 600 students from 40 countries. =Retirement: 2005‚Äì2007= Following his retirement, Ucko focused his attention on continuing dialogue between archaeological communities in the UK and PRC. In 2006 he travelled to ten Chinese cities with colleague Wang Tao, interviewing academic archaeologists about how they taught the subject; he planned to produce a book on this topic, but had not done so by the time of his death. A festschrift titled A Future for Archaeology, edited by Robert Layton, Stephen Shennan and Peter Stone, was produced in Ucko's honour in 2006. Ucko suffered from chronic diabetes, an ailment that caused his death on 14 June 2007. Personal life Ucko's grave in Highgate Cemetery, North London His obituary for The Telegraph described Ucko as a \\"combative, nervy man\\" who had a tendency to become aggressive under pressure and who viewed the world \\"in terms of friends and enemies\\". It furthermore noted that he was \\"genial and unpretentious\\" in the company of others, who often developed \\"strong affection\\" for him. Shennan opined that Ucko was a charismatic and dedicated figure who led by example, remarking that his actions inspired many archaeologists, including those who had fallen out with him. Shennan also considered him to have been extremely generous, exhibiting a \\"massive fund of human warmth.\\" His partner of 27 years was Jane Hubert, who supported him both emotionally and physically, sacrificing her own professional and personal interests to do so. The Peter Ucko Archaeological Trust The Peter Ucko Archaeological Trust was established in 2007, and focuses particularly on providing financial assistance for indigenous and economically disadvantaged people to gain education and training in archaeology, heritage management and associated disciplines, and supports activities that address inequalities and cultural conflict in the areas of archaeological heritage and cultural property. The Trust is administered by the UCL Institute of Archaeology.No author. 2007‚Äì2008. The Peter Ucko Archaeological Trust. Archaeology International 11, p. 14. DOI: The Ucko Collection The Ucko Collection consists of archaeological objects originally collected by Peter Ucko. On his death, ownership passed to his partner Jane Hubert, who later approached members of the Institute of Archaeology's staff with a desire to donate the collection to a public institution, an act which inspired the \\"Transitional Objects\\" project (UCL, 2014‚Äì2016).Vida, C. & Sully, D., (2015).

The tramway is the first commuter aerial tramway in North America, having opened in 1976. Since then, over 26 million passengers have ridden the tram. The tram consists of two capsules that run back and forth on two parallel tracks. It is one of the few forms of mass transit in New York City not run by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, but uses that system's MetroCard and has free transfers to that system. The tram is operated by LPOA (Leitner-Poma of America) on behalf of the Roosevelt Island Operating Corporation of the State of New York, a state public benefit corporation created in 1984 to run services on the island. History =Early history= An old tram car crossing the East River Roosevelt Island had been connected to Manhattan by a trolley (streetcar) line that crossed over the Queensboro Bridge from its opening in 1909. Trolleys to and from Queens stopped in the middle of the bridge to meet an elevator, which then took passengers down to the island. As the only connection to the rest of the city from the island, the trolley remained in service until April 7, 1957, long after most other trolley service had been dismantled in the city, and was the last trolley line in New York State; it was replaced by buses. At that time, a bridge to Queens was completed, requiring a roundabout trip to reach Manhattan. Beginning in the mid-1970s, Roosevelt Island was redeveloped to accommodate low- to mid- income housing projects, necessitating the construction of a new public transit connection to the city. The trolley tracks had deteriorated beyond repair and the Roosevelt Island subway station serving the island via the 63rd Street subway connection had not yet been completed. In 1971, the Urban Development Corporation retained Lev Zetlin Associates to select and design a transit connection to Roosevelt Island. James A O'Kon PE led the LZA team in carrying out a feasibility study and design. Three alternate modes were studied: a ferry, an elevator from the bridge, and the aerial tramway. The tramway was selected and the system was designed for bidding. Von Roll was selected to supply and erect the tram and its equipment. With the elevator to Roosevelt Island closed, the footpath on the bridge was shuttered in 1974, with the expectation that the tramway would open soon. The towers for the tram system were erected by July 1975, with completion projected for December of that year. The tram system was opened in July 1976 as a temporary solution for the island's commuting needs. As the subway project fell further behind schedule, the \\"tram\\" became more popular and was converted into a permanent facility, and the tram held a monopoly for service between Roosevelt Island and the rest of Manhattan until the subway connection to the island was finally completed in October 1989. Before the subway opened, though, there were two major disruptions in service: in 1978, for replacement of deteriorated cables, and in 1986, after the liability insurance policy for the tramway expired. After the 63rd Street Subway was completed, daily ridership declined sharply, from 5,500 daily riders in 1989 to 3,000 by 1993. The tram was closed from October 1993 to January 1994 for repairs. The tram was the last holdout for the use of tokens in the New York City transit system. Initially, it used a special token, which was later replaced by the standard variety for subways and buses. Although tokens were phased out in favor of the MetroCard by 2003, the tram did not start to accept MetroCards until March 1, 2004. The fare is the same as that on the buses and subways: U.S. $2.75 for a one-way trip, with free transfers to the subway and buses. During the 2005 New York City transit strike, the tramway was one of the few intra-city public transportation systems still in operation, since it was privately operated. =Breakdowns= One of the towers that supports the tramway On April 18, 2006, at about 5:22 p.m. EDT, the two trams were stuck over the East River for seven hours because of mechanical problems, trapping 69 people. Rescue baskets capable of holding up to 15 people were sent up to the stranded cable cars at 10:55 p.m., with children and elderly going first, and each rescue taking about 20 minutes. These baskets also carried supplies to the trams, such as blankets, baby formula, and food, for the remaining passengers.AP News, April 18, 2006, 10:44 p.m. (ET) Passengers on the Roosevelt Island‚Äìbound tram were rescued by about 2:55 a.m. on April 19, while those on the Manhattan-bound tram were not rescued until 4:07 a.m. The April 2006 incident had been the second time in eight months that the tram system lost power. On September 2, 2005, more than 80 people were trapped on the tram for over 90 minutes. After that incident, state inspectors cited the Roosevelt Island Tramway for not having an operational diesel backup, or motor-generator system. The State Department of Labor said the system did not pass electrical inspection and could not run when the April 18 power outage took place. The tramway suspended operations after the April 2006 incident, reopening on September 1, 2006. The tram's backup electrical systems were refurbished, and \\"in case of an emergency, each car now is equipped with blankets, water, food, and a toilet with a privacy curtain. Car attendants will carry cell phones with their radios.\\"AP News, September 1, 2006, 6:52AM (ET) =Renovation= The Roosevelt Island terminal under renovation On March 1, 2010, the tramway was closed as part of a $25 million project to upgrade and modernize the system. With the help of the French company Poma, all components were replaced except for the three tower bases. Among the improvements, the new tram cables and cars are now allowed to operate independently of each other in a \\"dual-haul\\" system. Prior to this, the cars had to travel at the same time, which presented maintenance and emergency response issues. The old cabins may be preserved on Roosevelt Island and/or in a museum. The tramway reopened November 30, 2010. The project was completed in nine months, two months longer than originally planned. Characteristics The Roosevelt Island Tramway contains two cabins that each run back and forth, suspended from their own pair of cables. Each cabin has a capacity of up to 125 people and makes approximately 115 trips per day. The tram moves at about and travels in 3 minutes. At its peak it climbs to above the East River as it follows its route on the north side of the Ed Koch Queensboro Bridge, providing views of the East Side of Midtown Manhattan. The tram runs every seven and half minutes from 6:00 a.m. to 2:00 a.m. (3:30 a.m. on weekends) and runs continuously during rush hours. The Roosevelt Island Tramway was the only aerial commuter tram in the US from 1976 until 2006, when the Portland Aerial Tram opened. Accessibility and transfers The Roosevelt Island Tramway's Manhattan entrance The tram is wheelchair accessible. Bicycles are permitted on the tram. In Manhattan, the entrance to the system is at Tram Plaza at 60th Street and Second Avenue, with transfers to the . The closest New York City Subway station is the complex at Lexington Avenue/59th Street, served by the . Lexington Avenue‚Äì53rd Street, served by the , and Lexington Avenue‚Äì63rd Street on the are also nearby. On Roosevelt Island, the \\"Red Bus\\" route meets the tram and offers transportation around the island for free. During the tramway reconstruction, the Red Bus was extended to Queens Plaza and the Manhattan side of the Queensboro Bridge. The publicly operated Q102 bus also provides transportation on the island. The Roosevelt Island subway station, serving the , is located north of the tramway entrance.

He also edited the works of Tobias Smollett. Life He was born on 10 October 1729 in Stirling, the son of Rev Charles Moore of Rowallan (d,1735) and his wife, Marion Anderson. The family moved to Glasgow in his youth and he was educated at Glasgow Grammar School. He was then apprenticed to Dr. John Gordon in Glasgow 1745 to 1747. After taking a medical degree at Glasgow, he served as a Surgeon's Mate with the army in Flanders during the Seven Years' War, then proceeded to London to continue his studies, and eventually to Paris, where became surgeon to the household of the British ambassador there. In 1751 he returned to Glasgow to rejoin Dr. John Gordon (also then practicing with Dr. Thomas Hamilton). From 1769 to 1778 he accompanied the Duke of Hamilton (who was linked to Thomas) on a Grand Tour of Europe. On his return he took up residence in London. In 1792 he accompanied Lord Lauderdale to Paris, and witnessed some of the principal scenes of the Revolution. His Journal during a Residence in France (1793) is the careful record of an eye-witness, and is frequently referred to by Thomas Carlyle. In 1784 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. His proposers were Andrew Dalzell, James Gregory, and John Robison. He died in Richmond in Surrey (now part of London) on 21 February 1802. He is buried in Stirling.https://www.geni.com/people/Doctor-John-Moore/6000000016433415447 Literary works John Moore His novel Zeluco (1789), a close analysis of the motives of a selfish profligate, produced a great impression at the time, and indirectly, through the poetry of Byron, has left an abiding mark on literature. Byron said that he intended Childe Harold to be a poetical Zeluco, and the most striking features of the portrait were undoubtedly taken from that character. Moore's other works have a less marked individuality, but his sketches of society and manners in France, Germany, Switzerland, Italy and England (A View of Society and Manners in France, Switzerland and Germany, London, W. Strahan & T. Cadell, in the Strand, 1779, 2 vol.; A View of Society and Manners in Italy, with anecdotes related to some eminent characters, London, W. Strahan & T. Cadell, 1781, 2 vol.) were also very popular during his lifetime and furnish valuable materials for the social historian. \\"Mordaunt. Character Sketches of Life, Characters, and Manners, in Various Countries; including the Memoirs of A French Lady of Quality\\" was a powerfully written anti-French Revolution novel in three volumes in the form of 34 character sketches of famous politicians, royalty, generals, the wealthy, and the celebrity of the day. It also offers detailed eyewitness accounts of John Moore's observations as he travelled throughout Europe in the last years of the 18th century. There are gripping accounts of the heroic feats of a dashing British Officer included, which were actually accounts of John Moore's son, General Moore. Zeluco is still (2018) available as a modestly priced reprint, and as a free ebook.

During his playing days, Burrell stood tall, weighing . He batted and threw right- handed. Burrell attended the University of Miami, where he won the Golden Spikes Award in 1998. On June 2, 1998, he was the first overall draft pick by the Philadelphia Phillies. After two years in the minor leagues, Burrell was called up by the Phillies in 2000, and he finished fourth in voting for the National League Rookie of the Year Award. After hitting 27 home runs (HR) in 2001 (the first of eight straight years in which Burrell would hit at least 20), he hit a career-high 37 home runs in 2002 and finished 14th in NL Most Valuable Player Award voting. In 2003, Burrell signed a six-year contract with the Phillies but batted a career-low .209, with 21 home runs. In 2004, he batted .257 with 24 home runs but missed several games with a wrist injury. Burrell hit 32 home runs in 2005 and finished seventh in NL MVP Award voting after he set a career high with 117 runs batted in (RBI). In 2006, he batted .258, with 29 home runs, and 95 RBI but was benched for a few games due to a slump after April. Burrell batted .256 with 30 home runs in 2007 as the Phillies reached the playoffs for the first time in his career. He hit a home run in the playoffs as the Phillies were swept in the first round. In 2008, Burrell hit 33 home runs as the Phillies reached the playoffs again, winning the World Series. After the 2008 season, Burrell became a free agent. He signed a two-year deal with the Tampa Bay Rays to be their designated hitter. In 2009, Burrell batted a disappointing .221 with 14 home runs. After he batted only .202 with two home runs in his first 24 games of the 2010 season, Burrell was designated for assignment by the Rays. He became a free agent and signed with the San Francisco Giants several days later. Burrell took over as San Francisco's left fielder and hit 18 home runs in 96 games for the Giants, helping to lead them into the playoffs. He had a key double versus his former team, the Phillies, as the Giants defeated them on their way to the World Series. That fall, Burrell got his second World Series ring as the Giants emerged victorious against the Texas Rangers. The following year, he signed a one-year deal to return for the Giants‚Äô 2011 season; however, Burrell ultimately lost his left field job, as he batted .230, with a career-low 7 home runs, in 92 games, while battling what would be a career-ending foot injury. Burrell filed for free agency on October 30, 2011. On April 12, 2012, it was announced that Philadelphia would sign him to a one-day contract, in order that he could finish his career as a Phillie. On May 19, 2012, at Citizens Bank Park, prior to the Phillies-Boston Red Sox game, Burrell threw out the ceremonial first pitch and subsequently retired. In March 2012, Burrell was named as a special assignment scout for the Giants and an assistant to General Manager (GM) Brian Sabean. High school career Burrell attended San Lorenzo Valley High School in Felton, California, as a freshman. After his freshman year, he transferred to Bellarmine College Preparatory in San Jose, where he played baseball and football. In the football program, playing quarterback, Burrell competed against Tom Brady, who played for rival Junipero Serra High School in San Mateo, California. He decided to concentrate on baseball in his senior year, however, and he was named the California Coaches Association Player of the Year after he batted .369 with 11 home runs. (Note: Click bio for information.) College career After graduating from high school in 1995, Burrell was drafted by the Boston Red Sox in the 43rd round of the 1995 Major League Baseball (MLB) Draft. Instead of signing, he chose to attend the University of Miami, where he played third base and was a teammate of Aubrey Huff. As a freshman, he was selected as a First-Team All- American by Baseball America and the Collegiate Baseball Newspaper. He was also named the Most Outstanding Player of the 1996 College World Series, joining Dave Winfield and Phil Nevin as the only players to win the award without winning the series. In the summer of 1996, he played collegiate summer baseball in the Cape Cod Baseball League for the Hyannis Mets. In his sophomore year, he was again named a First-Team All-American by Baseball America and the Collegiate Baseball Newspaper but also by the Sporting News this year. He was named Baseball America's Summer Player of the year in 1997. In 1998, as a junior, he won the Golden Spikes Award as the best player in college baseball. That year, he was drafted by the Philadelphia Phillies with the first overall pick in the 1998 MLB draft. Burrell finished his college career with 61 home runs, 187 runs batted in (RBI), and 170 walks in 162 games. His .442 batting average was seventh all-time by an NCAA player, and his slugging percentage of .888 was second only to Pete Incaviglia. In February 2008, Burrell was inducted into the University of Miami Sports Hall of Fame. Minor leagues On July 24, 1998 Burrell and the Phillies agreed to a five-year contract with a $3.15 million signing bonus. Upon signing, Burrell was assigned to the Class A-Advanced Clearwater Phillies of the Florida State League, and he was moved to first base because Scott Rolen, Philadelphia's third baseman in the major leagues, had just won the National League (NL) Rookie of the Year Award. With Clearwater in 1998, Burrell batted .303 with 7 home runs and 30 RBI in 37 games. Entering the 1999 season, Burrell was named the top prospect in the Phillies' organization by Baseball America, and they also named him baseball's 19th best prospect. He spent most of the season with the Double-A Reading Phillies of the Eastern League, batting .333 with 28 home runs and 90 RBI in 117 games. He was named to the Eastern League's post-season All-Star team and won the Eastern League Rookie of the Year Award. He also played 10 games with the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre Red Barons of the Triple-A International League, batting .152 with 1 home run and 4 RBI. In addition to playing first base, he was used as an outfielder with both teams. Burrell was named the Phillies' top prospect and the second-best prospect in baseball by Baseball America in 2000. He began the season with Scranton/Wilkes-Barre. Playing first base and the outfield, he batted .294 with 4 home runs and 25 RBI in 40 games. Major leagues =Philadelphia Phillies= 2000 On May 23, 2000, Burrell was called up by the Phillies. On May 24, he replaced Kevin Jordan (who had been filling in for injured Opening Day first baseman Rico Brogna) as the Phillies' first baseman. Making his major league debut that day, Burrell had two hits (his first coming against Octavio Dotel) and two RBI in a 9‚Äì7 victory over the Houston Astros. The following day, he hit his first career home run in a 10‚Äì6 loss to Houston. On June 20, with the Phillies trailing 2‚Äì1 against the New York Mets, Burrell hit a home run against Mets' closer Armando Ben√≠tez to make the score 2-2 in an eventual 3‚Äì2 victory for Philadelphia. The next day, Burrell had five RBI, two home runs, and his first career grand slam in a 10‚Äì5 victory for Philadelphia. On July 2, he had four hits and two RBI in a 9-1 victory over the Pittsburgh Pirates. Burrell remained the Phillies' first baseman when Brogna returned in July. He had five RBI, two home runs, and a grand slam on August 8 in a 10‚Äì4 victory over the San Diego Padres. On August 9, newly acquired outfielder Travis Lee was moved to first base, and Burrell was moved to left field for the rest of the year. On September 21, he had a game-winning single against Rick White in a 6‚Äì5 victory against the Mets. Burrell finished the season with 18 home runs, 79 RBI, and a .260 batting average in 111 games, and received the fourth most votes for the NL Rookie of the Year Award. 2001 On April 14, 2001, Burrell hit a game-winning home run in the sixth inning of a 2‚Äì1 victory over the Atlanta Braves. He had a game-winning two-RBI double in the ninth inning as the Phillies beat the Chicago Cubs, 6‚Äì3, on April 17. From May 19 to June 2, Burrell had a career-high 14-game hitting streak.

On August 10, as the Phillies beat the Los Angeles Dodgers, 10-5, Burrell hit his third career grand slam. He had a home run and three RBI in the final game of the season in a 4‚Äì1 victory over the Cincinnati Reds. Burrell finished the season with 27 home runs, 70 RBI, and a .258 batting average in 155 games. His 18 assists led NL outfielders and tied with Ra√∫l Mondes√≠ for most in the major leagues. However, his 162 strikeouts were the third-highest total in Phillies' history at the time, and they currently are the ninth-highest total. 2002 Burrell with the Philadelphia Phillies in September 2004 Burrell hit a leadoff walk-off home run on April 7, 2002, in the 11th inning, giving a 3‚Äì2 victory over the Florida Marlins. Three days later, Burrell hit a two-run, walk-off home run in the 11th inning to give the Phillies a 7‚Äì5 victory over the Braves. He was the first player in the major leagues to hit two such home runs in a four-day period since Albert Belle did it in 1995, and he was the first Phillie to hit two such in a season since Von Hayes hit two in 1989. In May, Burrell hit eight home runs, the most by a Phillie in May since teammate Mike Lieberthal hit eight in 1999. From June 2 through June 16, he had an 11-game hitting streak, his longest of the season. During the streak, on June 2, Burrell tied a career high with five RBI in an 18‚Äì3 victory over the Montreal Expos.

Burrell finished the season with career highs in almost every offensive category, including runs (96), batting average (.286), and games (157). He was the 12th Phillie with 30 home runs and 100 RBI in a season. His 37 home runs were seventh in the NL, and his 116 RBI were third, behind only Lance Berkman (128) and Albert Pujols (127). He was 14th in NL Most Valuable Player Award voting. 2003 On February 3, 2003, Burrell signed a six-year, $50 million contract with the Phillies. He had two home runs and five RBI (including the game-winner) on April 9 in a 16‚Äì2 victory over the Braves.

On September 28, he had the final hit in Veterans Stadium (a single against Jason Marquis) in a 5-2 loss to Atlanta. Burrell endured a season-long slump, and he was occasionally benched for a few games (often in favor of Ricky Led√©e) by Phillies' manager Larry Bowa. In 146 games, he batted .209 with 21 home runs and 64 RBI. However, his 21 home runs were still the second-highest total on the Phillies (teammate Jim Thome led the NL with 47). 2004 Burrell had four hits and three RBI on April 27, 2004, in a 7-3 victory over the Cardinals. He also made a leaping catch to take a home run away from Rolen, and he threw out Pujols trying to score from third base on a single by √âdgar Renter√≠a. On May 2, Burrell hit his first career pinch-hit home run: a two-run game-tying home run in the ninth inning against Matt Mantei of the Arizona Diamondbacks.

On May 11, Burrell hit two home runs and had five RBI in a 7-2 victory over the Cubs. Werth was injured at the end of June, however, and Burrell reclaimed his starting job by batting .435 in July, with six home runs and 22 RBI. (Note: Click bio for information.)

Burrell finished the 2007 regular season batting .256 with 30 home runs, 97 RBI, and 114 walks (a career high) in 155 games. Burrell, Ryan Howard, and Jimmy Rollins became the second trio of Phillies with 30 or more home runs (and the first since 1929). On defense, he led major league outfielders in errors, with 10, and his .948 fielding percentage was the lowest among left fielders. In 2007, the Phillies won the NL East and reached the playoffs for the first time since 1993 and the first time in Burrell's career. Burrell hit a home run against Jeff Francis in the first game of the NL Division Series (NLDS) but had only one other hit in the series as the Phillies were swept by the Colorado Rockies. 2008 Burrell batted .326 in April 2008, with 8 home runs and 24 RBI.

After the series, Burrell was chosen to lead the Phillies' World Series parade. Burrell filed for free agency on November 6. On December 16, the Phillies signed left fielder Ra√∫l Iba√±ez to a three-year contract, ending Burrell's tenure in Philadelphia. Burrell's 104 double plays grounded into were the seventh-most in Phillies history, and his 1,273 strikeouts were second only to Schmidt. However, Burrell was fifth in walks (785), eighth in RBI (827), and fourth in home runs (251) as a Phillie. His eight straight seasons with at least 20 home runs were topped only by Schmidt. =Tampa Bay Rays= Burrell during 2010 Spring training On January 5, 2009, the Tampa Bay Rays signed Burrell to a two-year, $16 million contract.

After batting .313 with one home run and six RBI in five games, he was called up to the Giants on June 4 to replace John Bowker, who was optioned to Fresno.

In the first game of a doubleheader against the Cubs on June 28, Burrell had a home run and three RBI in a 13-7 victory. He had a game-winning RBI single on July 7 in a 2-1 victory over San Diego. On July 15, Burrell was placed on the disabled list with a potentially career- ending foot injury. He returned from the DL on August 31, but he was not able to start regularly upon returning. For the final game of the year (a 6-3 loss to Colorado on September 28), Burrell started in left field after asking Giants' manager Bruce Bochy to put him in the lineup since it was potentially his final game. He finished the year batting .230 with career-lows in games (92), at bats (183), hits (42), home runs (seven), and RBI (21). On October 30, he filed for free agency. Burrell signed a one-day contract with the Philadelphia Phillies on May 19, 2012, so he could officially retire as a Phillie. It was announced on February 28, 2015 that Burrell would be inducted onto the Phillies Wall of Fame. He was subsequently inducted on Friday, July 31. He stated, \\"I always knew that the fans were behind me, even through the tough times. When David called and told me I had been voted in by the fans, it was overwhelming.\\" Burrell was the 37th inductee to the Wall of Fame. =\\"Met Killer\\"= Burrell showed a penchant for hitting home runs against the New York Mets. In 2007, Burrell hit four home runs in a four-game series sweep against the Mets in late August. In total, he hit 42 home runs against the Mets through the 2011 season, his highest total against any team, which ranked fifth all-time in home runs hit against the franchise at the time of his departure from Philadelphia (he has since fallen to sixth, having been passed by Chipper Jones.) Batting .264 at the Phillies' home parks against a .228 mark at Shea Stadium, Burrell nonetheless enjoyed playing in New York, citing the atmosphere and memorable home runs against Mets pitchers, including two in back-to-back games against then-closer Armando Ben√≠tez. Scouting and coaching After his playing career ended, Burrell became a special assignment scout for the Giants, based in Scottsdale, Arizona. Burrell is currently serving as Hitting Coach for the San Jose Giants of the California League, in the Giants‚Äô farm system. Personal life Pat had an English Bulldog named Elvis who was featured in the Phillies 2008 World Series Parade. Elvis died in September 2014.

He is best known as the author of the farce Noises Off\\"Michael Frayn British author and translator,\\" Encyclop√¶dia Britannica https://www.britannica.com/biography/Michael-Frayn Retrieved 6 August 2017. and the dramas Copenhagen and Democracy. His novels, such as Towards the End of the Morning, Headlong and Spies, have also been critical and commercial successes, making him one of the handful of writers in the English language to succeed in both drama and prose fiction. He has also written philosophical works, such as The Human Touch: Our Part in the Creation of the Universe (2006). Early life Frayn was born at Mill Hill (then in Middlesex) to Thomas Allen Frayn, a deaf asbestos salesman from a working-class family of blacksmiths, locksmiths and servants, in which deafness was hereditary, and his wife Violet Alice (n√©e Lawson). Violet was the daughter of a failed palliasse merchant; having studied as a violinist at the Royal Academy of Music, she worked as a shop assistant and occasional clothes model at Harrods. Frayn's sister would also later work at Harrods, as a children's hairdresser.My Father's Fortune, A Life by Michael Frayn, Faber and Faber, 2010, pp. 12-14, 28-29, 2252009 Interview in the Observer He grew up in Ewell, Surrey, and was educated at Kingston Grammar School. Following two years of National Service, during which he learned Russian at the Joint Services School for Linguists, Frayn read Moral Sciences (Philosophy) at Emmanuel College, Cambridge, graduating in 1957. He then worked as a reporter and columnist for The Guardian and The Observer, where he established a reputation as a satirist and comic writer, and began publishing his plays and novels. Works The play Copenhagen deals with a historical event, a 1941 meeting between the Danish physicist Niels Bohr and his prot√©g√©, the German Werner Heisenberg, when Denmark is under German occupation, and Heisenberg is‚Äîmaybe?‚Äîworking on the development of an atomic bomb. Frayn was attracted to the topic because it seemed to 'encapsulate something about the difficulty of knowing why people do what they do and there is a parallel between that and the impossibility that Heisenberg established in physics, about ever knowing everything about the behaviour of physical objects'. The play explores various possibilities. Frayn's more recent play Democracy ran successfully in London (the National Theatre, 2003-4 and West End transfer), Copenhagen and on Broadway (Brooks Atkinson Theatre, 2004-5); it dramatised the story of the German chancellor Willy Brandt and his personal assistant, the East German spy G√ºnter Guillaume. Five years later, again at the National Theatre, it was followed by Afterlife, a biographical drama of the life of the great Austrian impresario Max Reinhardt, director of the Salzburg Festival, which opened at the Lyttelton Theatre in June 2008, starring Roger Allam as Reinhardt.Fiona Maddocks, \\"The History Play Man; Daring: Frayn's Drama Slips in and out of Rhyming Couplets \\"To Blur the Distinction between Theatre and Life Just as Rheinhardt Did,\\" The Evening Standard, 3 June 2008. His other original plays include two evenings of short plays, The Two of Us and Alarms and Excursions, the philosophical comedies Alphabetical Order, Benefactors, Clouds, Make and Break and Here, and the farces Donkeys' Years, Balmoral (also known as Liberty Hall), and Noises Off, which critic Frank Rich in his book The Hot Seat claimed \\"is, was, and probably always will be the funniest play written in my lifetime.\\" His novels include Headlong (shortlisted for the 1999 Booker Prize), The Tin Men (won the 1966 Somerset Maugham Award), The Russian Interpreter (1967, Hawthornden Prize) Towards the End of the Morning, Sweet Dreams, A Landing on the Sun, A Very Private Life, Now You Know and Skios (long-listed for the Man Booker Prize in 2012). His novel, Spies, was long-listed for the Man Booker Prize and won the Whitbread Prize for Fiction in 2002. He has also written a book about philosophy, Constructions, and a book of his own philosophy, The Human Touch. His columns for The Guardian and The Observer (collected in The Day of the Dog, The Book of Fub and On the Outskirts) are models of the comic essay; in the 1980s a number of them were adapted and performed for BBC Radio 4 by Martin Jarvis. He has also written screenplays for the films Clockwise, starring John Cleese, First and Last starring Tom Wilkinson, Birthday, Jamie on a Flying Visit, and the TV series Making Faces, starring Eleanor Bron. He is now considered to be Britain's finest translator of Anton ChekhovDonald Rayfield, \\"Review: Chekhov: Four Plays and Three Jokes by Sharon Marie - adapting the four major plays\\", Translation and Literature Vol. 20, No. 3, Translating Russia, 1890-1935 (Autumn 2011), pp. 408-410? (The Seagull, Uncle Vanya, Three Sisters and The Cherry Orchard) as well as an early untitled work, which he titled Wild Honey (other translations of the work have called it Platonov or Don Juan in the Russian Manner) and a number of Chekhov's smaller plays for an evening called The Sneeze (originally performed on the West End by Rowan Atkinson). He also translated Yuri Trifonov's play Exchange, Leo Tolstoy's The Fruits of Enlightenment, and Jean Anouilh's Number One. In 1980, he presented the Australian journey of the BBC television series Great Railway Journeys of the World. His journey took him from Sydney to Perth on the Indian Pacific with side visits to the Lithgow Zig Zag and a journey on The Ghan's old route from Marree to Alice Springs shortly before the opening of the new line from Tarcoola to Alice Springs. Frayn's wife, Claire Tomalin, is a biographer and literary journalist.

The arrow shows the flow direction. Vertical lift check valve A check valve, clack valve, non-return valve, reflux valve, retention valve or one-way valve is a valve that normally allows fluid (liquid or gas) to flow through it in only one direction. Check valves are two-port valves, meaning they have two openings in the body, one for fluid to enter and the other for fluid to leave. There are various types of check valves used in a wide variety of applications. Check valves are often part of common household items. Although they are available in a wide range of sizes and costs, check valves generally are very small, simple, or inexpensive. Check valves work automatically and most are not controlled by a person or any external control; accordingly, most do not have any valve handle or stem. The bodies (external shells) of most check valves are made of plastic or metal. An important concept in check valves is the cracking pressure which is the minimum differential upstream pressure between inlet and outlet at which the valve will operate. Typically the check valve is designed for and can therefore be specified for a specific cracking pressure. Heart valves are essentially inlet and outlet check valves for the heart ventricles, since the ventricles act as pumps.  Technical terminology  Cracking pressure ‚Äì Refers to the minimum pressure differential needed between the inlet and outlet of the valve at which the first indication of flow occurs (steady stream of bubbles). Cracking pressure is also known as unseating head (pressure) or opening pressure. Reseal pressure ‚Äì Refers to the pressure differential between the inlet and outlet of the valve during the closing process of the check valve, at which there is no visible leak rate. Reseal pressure is also known as sealing pressure, seating head (pressure) or closing pressure. Back pressure ‚Äì a pressure higher at the outlet of a fitting than that at the inlet or a point upstream Types of check valves A ball check valve is a check valve in which the closing member, the movable part to block the flow, is a ball. In some ball check valves, the ball is spring-loaded to help keep it shut. For those designs without a spring, reverse flow is required to move the ball toward the seat and create a seal. The interior surface of the main seats of ball check valves are more or less conically- tapered to guide the ball into the seat and form a positive seal when stopping reverse flow. Ball check valves are often very small, simple, and cheap. They are commonly used in liquid or gel minipump dispenser spigots, spray devices, some rubber bulbs for pumping air, etc., manual air pumps and some other pumps, and refillable dispensing syringes. Although the balls are most often made of metal, they can be made of other materials; in some specialized cases out of highly durable or inert materials, such as sapphire. High pressure HPLC pumps and similar applications commonly use small inlet and outlet ball check valves with balls of (artificial) ruby and seats made of sapphire or both ball and seat of ruby, for both hardness and chemical resistance. After prolonged use, such check valves can eventually wear out or the seat can develop a crack, requiring replacement. Therefore, such valves are made to be replaceable, sometimes placed in a small plastic body tightly-fitted inside a metal fitting which can withstand high pressure and which is screwed into the pump head. There are similar check valves where the disc is not a ball, but some other shape, such as a poppet energized by a spring. Ball check valves should not be confused with ball valves, which is a different type of valve in which a ball acts as a controllable rotor to stop or direct flow. A diaphragm check valve uses a flexing rubber diaphragm positioned to create a normally- closed valve. Pressure on the upstream side must be greater than the pressure on the downstream side by a certain amount, known as the pressure differential, for the check valve to open allowing flow. Once positive pressure stops, the diaphragm automatically flexes back to its original closed position. Swing check valve opening and closing A swing check valve or tilting disc check valve is a check valve in which the disc, the movable part to block the flow, swings on a hinge or trunnion, either onto the seat to block reverse flow or off the seat to allow forward flow. The seat opening cross-section may be perpendicular to the centerline between the two ports or at an angle. Although swing check valves can come in various sizes, large check valves are often swing check valves. A common issue caused by swing check valves is known as water hammer. This can occur when the swing check closes and the flow abruptly stops, causing a surge of pressure resulting in high velocity shock waves that act against the piping and valves, placing large stress on the metals and vibrations in the system. Undetected, water hammer can rupture pumps, valves, and pipes within the system. The flapper valve in a flush- toilet mechanism is an example of this type of valve. Tank pressure holding it closed is overcome by manual lift of the flapper. It then remains open until the tank drains and the flapper falls due to gravity. Another variation of this mechanism is the clapper valve, used in applications such firefighting and fire life safety systems. A hinged gate only remains open in the inflowing direction. The clapper valve often also has a spring that keeps the gate shut when there is no forward pressure. Another example is the backwater valve (for sanitary drainage system) that protects against flooding caused by return flow of sewage waters. Such risk occurs most often in sanitary drainage systems connected to combined sewerage systems and in rainwater drainage systems. It may be caused by intense rainfall, thaw or flood. A stop-check valve is a check valve with override control to stop flow regardless of flow direction or pressure. In addition to closing in response to backflow or insufficient forward pressure (normal check-valve behavior), it can also be deliberately shut by an external mechanism, thereby preventing any flow regardless of forward pressure. A lift-check valve is a check valve in which the disc, sometimes called a lift, can be lifted up off its seat by higher pressure of inlet or upstream fluid to allow flow to the outlet or downstream side. A guide keeps motion of the disc on a vertical line, so the valve can later reseat properly. When the pressure is no longer higher, gravity or higher downstream pressure will cause the disc to lower onto its seat, shutting the valve to stop reverse flow. An in-line check valve is a check valve similar to the lift check valve. However, this valve generally has a spring that will 'lift' when there is pressure on the upstream side of the valve. The pressure needed on the upstream side of the valve to overcome the spring tension is called the 'cracking pressure'. When the pressure going through the valve goes below the cracking pressure, the spring will close the valve to prevent back- flow in the process. A duckbill valve is a check valve in which flow proceeds through a soft tube that protrudes into the downstream side. Back-pressure collapses this tube, cutting off flow. A pneumatic non-return valve. Multiple check valves can be connected in series. For example, a double check valve is often used as a backflow prevention device to keep potentially contaminated water from siphoning back into municipal water supply lines. There are also double ball check valves in which there are two ball/seat combinations sequentially in the same body to ensure positive leak-tight shutoff when blocking reverse flow; and piston check valves, wafer check valves, and ball- and-cone check valves. Applications =Pumps= The check valves on this steam locomotive are located under the small cover between the chimney and the main dome. Check valves are often used with some types of pumps. Piston-driven and diaphragm pumps such as metering pumps and pumps for chromatography commonly use inlet and outlet ball check valves. These valves often look like small cylinders attached to the pump head on the inlet and outlet lines. Many similar pump-like mechanisms for moving volumes of fluids around use check valves such as ball check valves. The feed pumps or injectors which supply water to steam boilers are fitted with check valves to prevent back-flow. Check valves are also used in the pumps that supply water to water slides. The water to the slide flows through a pipe which doubles as the tower holding the steps to the slide. When the facility with the slide closes for the night, the check valve stops the flow of water through the pipe; when the facility reopens for the next day, the valve is opened and the flow restarts, making the slide ready for use again. =Industrial processes= Check valves are used in many fluid systems such as those in chemical and power plants, and in many other industrial processes. Typical applications in the nuclear industry are feed water control systems, dump lines, make-up water, miscellaneous process systems, N2 systems, and monitoring and sampling systems. In aircraft and aerospace, check valves are used where high vibration, large temperature extremes and corrosive fluids are present. For example, spacecraft and launch vehicle propulsion propellant control for reaction control systems (RCS) and Attitude Control Systems (ACS) and aircraft hydraulic systems. The injectors in a fuel injection system are check valves with a high opening pressure (5‚Äì8 bar). Check valves are also often used when multiple gases are mixed into one gas stream. A check valve is installed on each of the individual gas streams to prevent mixing of the gases in the original source. For example, if a fuel and an oxidizer are to be mixed, then check valves will normally be used on both the fuel and oxidizer sources to ensure that the original gas cylinders remain pure and therefore nonflammable. In 2010, NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory slightly modified a simple check valve design with the intention to store liquid samples indicative to life on Mars in separate reservoirs of the device without fear of cross contamination. =Domestic use= When a sanitary potable water supply is plumbed to an unsanitary system, for example lawn sprinklers, a dish washer or a washing machine, a check valve called a backflow preventer is used to prevent contaminated water from re-entering the domestic water supply. Some types of irrigation sprinklers and drip irrigation emitters have small check valves built into them to keep the lines from draining when the system is shut off. Check valves used in domestic heating systems to prevent vertical convection, especially in combination with solar thermal installations, also are called gravity brakes. Rainwater harvesting systems that are plumbed into the main water supply of a utility provider may be required to have one or more check valves fitted to prevent contamination of the primary supply by rainwater. Hydraulic jacks use ball check valves to build pressure on the lifting side of the jack. Check valves are commonly used in inflatables, such as toys, mattresses and boats. This allows the object to be inflated without continuous or uninterrupted air pressure. History Frank P. Cotter developed a \\"simple self sealing check valve, adapted to be connected in the pipe connections without requiring special fittings and which may be readily opened for inspection or repair\\" 1907 (U.S. patent 865,631). Nikola Tesla invented a deceptively simple one-way valve for fluids in 1916, called a Tesla valve. It was patented in 1920 (U.S. patent 1,329,559).

Such highly valued concepts attract general approval and acclaim. Their appeal is to emotions such as love of country and home, and desire for peace, freedom, glory, and honor. They ask for approval without examination of the reason. They are typically used by politicians and propagandists. Origins The term dates from the mid-19th century in the American context. Advocates for abolition of slavery argued that the institution was contradictory to the United States Declaration of Independence's statements that \\"all men are created equal\\" and possessed natural rights to \\"life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.\\" Proslavery opponents countered that the Declaration was a collection of inspirational statements intended for revolution, rather than a concrete set of principles for civil society. Rufus Choate, a Whig senator from Massachusetts, likely brought the term into general discourse in his August 1856 public letter to the Maine Whig Committee. In the letter, Choate expressed fear that antislavery Whigs, inspired by the Declaration's \\"glittering and sound generalities,\\" would destroy the Union. The letter ‚Äì and especially Choate's phrase ‚Äì became the topic of much public debate in the northern press. However, it is unclear whether the phrase was originated by Choate or Franklin J. Dickman, a judge and legal scholar of that era.Bartlett's Familiar Quotations, 10th ed. 1919 Abraham Lincoln, in an April 6, 1859 letter to Henry L. Pierce, criticized political opponents of the day who slighted the foundational principles of Thomas Jefferson as \\"glittering generalities\\". Lincoln asserted that Jefferson's abstract ideals were not mere rhetoric, but the \\"definitions and axioms of free society.\\"Letter to Henry L. Pierce and others, 6 April 1859 The term then came to be used for any set of ideas or principles that are appealing but nonspecific. In the 1930s, the Institute for Propaganda Analysis popularized the term as one of its \\"seven propaganda devices\\". Qualities A glittering generality has two qualities: it is vague and it has positive connotations. Words and phrases such as \\"common good\\", \\"reform\\", \\"courage\\", \\"democracy\\", \\"freedom\\", \\"hope\\", \\"patriotism\\", \\"strength\\", are terms with which people all over the world have powerful associations, and they may have trouble disagreeing with them. However, these words are highly abstract and ambiguous, and meaningful differences exist regarding what they actually mean or should mean in the real world.

He studied with Kira Shashkina for six years at the Special Music School of the Kazan Conservatory, before entering the Moscow Central Music School at the age of 13, where he studied under Evgeny Timakin. In 1974, he entered the Moscow Conservatory, studying under Yakov Flier and Lev Vlassenko. At age 21, he won the Gold Medal at the VI International Tchaikovsky Competition in 1978, which earned him international recognition and drew great attention worldwide.Jean-Pierre Thiollet, 88 notes pour piano solo, \\"Solo nec plus ultra\\", Neva Editions, 2015, p.51. . The following year he made his debut in the United States. He also taught at the Moscow Conservatory. Pletnev has acknowledged Sergei Rachmaninoff as a particularly notable influence on him as a musician.Greene, Lynnda. \\"Beyond Borders\\" in International Piano Magazine November / December 2003 Pletnev conducting, 2017 In 1988, Pletnev was invited to perform at the superpower conference in Washington, D.C., where he met and befriended Mikhail Gorbachev. From this friendship, he gained the support to found two years later the Russian National Orchestra in 1990, the first non-government-supported orchestra in Russia since 1917, and became its first principal conductor. He and the orchestra made their recording debut on Virgin Classics, releasing Tchaikovsky's Sixth Symphony and Marche Slave in 1991. He stepped down as Principal Conductor in the late 1990s, but remained the orchestra's artistic director. Mikhail Pletnev was principal guest conductor of the Orchestra della Svizzera Italiana in Lugano, Switzerland from 2008 to 2010. Pletnev has made a number of recordings with Deutsche Grammophon. His recordings are mostly of Russian works, though in 2007 he recorded the complete Beethoven symphonies. The first works he recorded were for orchestra, including Tchaikovsky's The Sleeping Beauty, his Sixth Symphony and Manfred Symphony, and Rachmaninoff's Second and Third Symphonies. Pletnev's recording of Tchaikovsky's First Symphony (Winter Daydreams) received critical acclaim. His piano repertoire is extensive and includes The Seasons, many Scarlatti sonatas, Pictures at an Exhibition as well as his own transcriptions of suites from The Nutcracker and The Sleeping Beauty. With Pentatone, Pletnev has also recorded Russian works, such as all of Tchaikovsky's symphonies, Shostakovitch's symphonies no. 15 and 11, and Sergei Taneyev's At the Reading of a Psalm. In July 2010, Pletnev, a resident of Thailand, was arrested by Thai authorities in connection with allegations of child molestation. Pletnev, who was released on bail, denied the charges. He cancelled appearances at the BBC Proms and the Edinburgh International Festival in order to prepare his defense, but the charges were dropped on 28 September.

Associated Press. 2/15/07. Earl Pomeroy supported the House resolution opposing George W. Bush's troop surge plan in February 2007. He said in a floor speech,C-SPAN Iraq War Debate \\"We take care of our soldiers over [in Iraq] by making sure their deployments are only for acceptable periods and at acceptable intervals, with enough time at home in between to heal, to rest, and to train. But beyond these things, we take care of our soldiers over there when we as a Congress make certain the mission they have sent to perform has a reasonable chance of success. \\"In a war where so many tragic mistakes have been made, this Congress must not sit quietly by while additional plans are cooked up in Washington whose only certainty is to accelerate the loss of American lives, compound the already severe strain on our military capabilities, and accelerate the burn rate of American dollars spent in Iraq. ... Without the commitment between the warring parties in Iraq to stop the killing, and create a political agreement upon which a national government can exist, 20,000 more U.S. soldiers are not likely to bring about a lasting peace.\\" =Health care = Pomeroy voted for the Affordable Health Care for America Act in November 2009, stating that the bill was far from perfect, \\"but so is our present system.\\" =Adoption tax credit= Pomeroy strongly supported legislation allowing parents to deduct adoption expenses they incurred.
