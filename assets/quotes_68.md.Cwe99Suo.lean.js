Biography  The Head-dress (1911) Reader at the Window (1890), Soissons Museum Born in Mulhouse, into an Alsatian family of famous brewers, he was the son of Paul Sch√ºtzenberger (1829‚Äì1897), a French chemist. The painter Louis-Fr√©d√©ric Sch√ºtzenberger (1825‚Äì1903) was his cousin. Ren√© Sch√ºtzenberger studied at the Acad√©mie Julian, a private art school founded by Rodolphe Julian under Jean-Paul Laurens.Nos peintres et sculpteurs, graveurs, dessinateurs. Jules Martin. 1897. p.343; archive.org In 1891, he married Andr√©e-Marie Bouland in the town hall of the 6th arrondissement of Paris.. She was a writer and an art critique known as Andr√©e Myra. Sch√ºtzenberger started to exhibit at the Salon des Artistes Fran√ßais in 1889, at the Salon des Ind√©pendants from 1902 and at the Soci√©t√© Nationale des Beaux-Arts from 1907. He got an honourable mention at the Salon of 1897 and at the Universal Exhibition of 1900.. In 1911, Sch√ºtzenberger exhibited at the Exposition des Peintres du Paris moderne in the Gallery Georges Petit.. In 1912. and in 1915, he participated in the Exposition of group of artists called Cent Artistes in the Gallery Henri Manuel.. He died in Paris on 31 December 1916. He practiced genre painting, portraits, nudes and landscapes, treating the subjects of the daily life and intimate subjects. His style is close to the Post-Impressionism movement and was influenced by the Les Nabis group of Post-Impressionists, most of whom also studied at Acad√©mie Julian. Retrospective exhibition Salon des Ind√©pendants took place in 1926. Works by Ren√© Sch√ºtzenberger were exhibited at Grand Palais along with works by Paul C√©zanne, Vincent van Gogh, Amedeo Modigliani, Georges Seurat, Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, F√©lix Vallotton and other painters.

Friedrich von Schwerin, head of administration in Frankfurt/Oder and chairman of the Society for Inner Colonization stated, \\"The German people, the greatest colonizing people on earth, have again been given a great colonizing task. The current world war provides the opportunity for Germany to resume in a resolute way its colonizing mission in the East\\".

As a cricketer he was an opening batsman who played a part in Hampshire winning the County Championship in 1961, whilst in football he played at outside right. Early life Harrison was born at St. John's, Worcester, close to New Road, the home of Worcestershire County Cricket Club. He was educated at Peter Symonds College in Winchester, Hampshire and was a keen all round sportsman who excelled from an early age in both cricket and football. During his period of National Service he represented the army in both sports. Football career Crystal Palace Harrison was an England schoolboy international and in October 1952, he joined Portsmouth as a trainee, on amateur terms. Unable to break into the first team, he moved to Crystal Palace in October 1955. At Crystal Palace he was given a professional contract and made his first team debut in March 1956, as Palace finished second from bottom in the Third Division South and were forced to seek re-election. In the 1956‚Äì57 season, Harrison became established in the side, normally at outside-right with Johnny Byrne on the left, providing scoring opportunities for the front men, including Mike Deakin at centre forward and Peter Berry and Barry Pierce as the inside-forwards. Harrison himself contributed four goals, as Palace finished 20th in the table. In 1957, Soccer Star predicted that, once Palace's fortunes improved, Harrison would become \\"one of the most talked about wingers in the game\\". He was selected to play in the Third Division South representative team in 1957. In the following season, George Cooper took over at centre forward, scoring 17 goals. Harrison contributed seven goals as Palace improved their league position, finishing 14th. Unfortunately, this was two places below the cut-off point for the re-organisation of the league structure, and Palace played in the newly created Fourth Division in 1958‚Äì59. Harrison only managed 14 league games in the 1958‚Äì59 season, with Ron Brett or Gerry Priestley being preferred in the No. 7 shirt. In the summer of 1959, Harrison left Selhurst Park having made exactly 100 first team appearances, 92 in the League and 8 in the FA Cup, scoring 12 goals (all in league matches). Southampton Harrison was recruited for Southampton, then in the Third Division, by manager Ted Bates as cover for Terry Paine. Paine's fitness was such, however, that he never missed a match in the one season that Harrison spent at The Dell. Harrison's three appearances for the \\"Saints\\" came in October, when Paine switched first to the left to replace the injured John Sydenham, and then to inside right in place of George O'Brien. Harrison's first and last matches were both against Barnsley. The second match was at home to Swindon Town when Derek Reeves scored four, with one from Paine, in a 5‚Äì1 victory on 10 October 1959. The Daily Echo reported that \\"Bernard Harrison (did) well on the right wing\\". Despite this, Harrison was unable to displace Paine and spent the rest of the season in the reserves. In his biography, Kevin Smallbone argues that Harrison was \\"too talented for his own good\\" and Harrison said (in 2005) that he \\"was doing too many things, I didn't have time to train\\". Speaking to Paine's biographer, David Bull, Harrison commented that he \\"couldn't understand\\" why Ted Bates didn't switch Terry Paine to inside- left to accommodate him on the right. At the end of the season, Southampton were able to celebrate taking the Third Division title, whereas Harrison decided to try his luck elsewhere. Exeter City At the end of the 1959‚Äì60 season, Harrison moved along the coast to join Exeter City where he spent one season, making 18 appearances in the Fourth Division scoring four goals. Over the next few years, he played for a succession of non-league clubs, ending his career at Winchester City. Cricket career Harrison joined Hampshire and spent most of his career playing in the Second XI as an opening batsman, understudying Roy Marshall and Jimmy Gray. He made his debut for the first XI against Oxford University in June 1957, not making any significant contribution in a drawn match. His County Championship debut came in May 1958, against Worcester, scoring only a single and not being called on to bowl ‚Äì Hampshire won the match by 9 wickets. A strong right-hand batsman he achieved his top score of 110 versus Oxford University played at Portsmouth in July 1961. In this match, he shared with Mike Barnard in a stand of 119 for the second wicket. Six of his 14 county matches were against Oxford University, and both his fifties and his only first-class hundred also came against them. He contributed to the team led by Colin Ingleby-Mackenzie that won Hampshire's first County Championship in 1961 and played four times in 1962. He continued to appear infrequently for the Second XI, the last time in 1968. Later career Harrison was a qualified teacher, and amongst his positions was that of Sports and Mathematics teacher at Farleigh School, firstly at Basingstoke and from 1982 at Red Rice near Andover. Harrison's club cricket was with Basingstoke & North Hants Cricket Club, where he also coached. He also excelled at other sports, gaining county recognition in badminton and table tennis and could also have done so in hockey while at school but football took preference.

The biomechanics of jumping, the influence of the rider, and the heritability of jumping prowess have all been the focus of research. Jumping process A horse free jumping The airborne phase of the jumping process occurs between stance phases of the fore and hind limbs and is therefore biomechanically equivalent to a highly suspended or elevated canter stride. For this reason, horses typically approach obstacles at the canter. The jumping process can be broken down into five phases: Approach The \\"approach\\" is the final canter stride before the jump, during which the horse places all four legs for the optimal take-off. The horse reaches forward and down with his neck to lower the forehand and his center of mass. The forelegs are propped or strutted out in front of the body. This relatively sudden braking action allows momentum to carry the hindlegs further under the body of the horse than would be otherwise possible. While the action is more fluid, it is mechanically similar to the act of crouching down before jumping. They also use there back legs to lift them off. Take-off The \\"take-off\\" begins when the forelegs leave the ground and is completed when the hindlegs leave the ground. Once the horse leaves the ground, he is unable to influence the trajectory that his center of mass follows through the air, which makes take- off the most critical phase of the jumping process. Most of the energy required to clear an obstacle is produced by the hind legs. The longer the hindlegs are in contact with the ground, the greater their capacity for producing power; the further forward the hindlegs are placed under the body, closer to the obstacle, the longer this stance phase. Power is produced by the compression of the hindleg, which flexes at the hip, stifle, hock, and fetlock, and then releases energy like a spring. Flight, suspension, or airborne phase During \\"flight\\", the horse's center of mass follows a parabolic trajectory over which it has no control. The horse can change the position of its legs and body in relation to the center of mass, however, which is critical to clearing an obstacle safely. The horse's body rotates through the air, a quality called \\"bascule\\", to ensure that while the forehand clears the fence, the shoulders are the highest point of the body, and while the hind end clears the fence, the hips are the highest point of the body. The bascule is the horse's arc over the fence. A horse with a good bascule makes a rounded jump and helps the horse jump higher. The forelegs are drawn up towards the body and the hindlegs are \\"retroflexed\\" out away from the body to clear the obstacle. During flight, the rider has little impact on the actual trajectory of the horse's body. Foals frequently change leads when jumping. Landing The horse lands first with the trailing (non-leading) foreleg, and then with the lead foreleg. The hind limbs follow suit. The landing places a great deal of strain on the forelegs, which can lead to injuries or lameness over time. Recovery, getaway During the first stride after the jump, the horse re-balances itself. Horses sometimes react to discomfort or high emotion during the recovery, and may buck, bolt, or toss their heads. File:Complet- cysoing-cross-038.jpgApproach. File:IMG 8002.jpgBascule during flight. File:Praha, Tr√≥ja, k≈Ø≈à ve skoku.jpgRetroflexing of the hind legs during flight. File:Barre tombe.jpgLanding File:Lion d angers2007 sortie de gue.jpgRecovery Injuries associated with jumping Classic animation by Eadweard Muybridge of a horse and rider jumping Jumping is a very strenuous activity that places high physical demands on the horse. The primary stresses affect the suspensory apparatuses of the hind legs during take-off and the forelegs during landing, though the galloping and turning associated with jumping also place torque on the joints. Most injuries, chronic or acute, begin with strain; as structures in the horse's body absorb the shock of take- off and landing, they acquire small amounts of damage. Over time, this damage leads to inflammation of the tendons (tendinitis) and ligaments (desmitis). The most common injuries in the forelimb occur to the interosseous ligaments and the superficial digital flexor tendons and less commonly, the accessory ligament of the deep digital flexor tendon. Strain on the superficial digital flexors is greater when jumping higher fences, so horses may no longer be suitable for competitive jumping after damaging that apparatus. The effects of jumping on the hind legs can include injuries to the proximal, medial, or lateral branches of the suspensory ligaments. Jumping horses can also be at a higher risk of developing osteochondritis dissecans (OCD) or other arthritic conditions, even at a young age. Genetic and environmental components play roles in the development of OCD in horses: some families have weaker joints, but excessive growth over a short period of time, age-inappropriate exercise regimens and nutrition can also contribute. Jumping performance is especially influenced by the presence of arthropathic hocks. One study found that at breeding stock evaluations, horses with radiographically diagnosed athropathies of the hock joints scored significantly lower than their healthy peers for the quality of the canter, jumping technique, and ability and their character. The pain associated with arthropathic conditions likely makes the horses unwilling to push powerfully off their hindlegs, a quality necessary for jumping and cantering and which could make the horse appear lazy or unwilling to work. Indications of lameness in jumping horses typically come in the form of a change in habits: sudden or developing reluctance to turn, land on a certain lead, or \\"add\\" a stride and jump \\"deep\\"; difficulties altering the stride length or making the distances in a combination; and developing habits like rushing, stopping and refusing, or frequent lead changes. Unfortunately, many of these undesirable habits can also be the result of poor training, which challenges riders and owners to identify the causes of bad behavior. World records The world record high jump, completed by Huaso and Captain Alberto Larraguibel in 1949. The world record for the highest obstacle cleared by a horse and rider was set on February 5, 1949, by Huaso and his rider, Captain Alberto Larraguibel. The Thoroughbred stallion and his Chilean rider cleared a fence measuring high. This record has stood for 70 years. This record is held separately from the record height jumped in Puissance classes, regularly held high jump competitions at horse shows. The record for highest obstacle cleared by a horse and rider in a Puissance competition is held by Leonardo and his rider, Franke Sloothaak. In 1991, this pair jumped a puissance wall standing . Horses are also capable of jumping obstacles of great width. The world record long jump was set on April 26, 1975, by a horse named Something ridden by a Mr. Andre Ferreira. This pair jumped a distance of .

The title derives from a catchphrase of Barth's. Koch had previously written about Barth in her 1996 Off Broadway play Sophie, Totie, & Belle. Plot The musical presents a fictionalised 1961 rehearsal between Barth and her pianist, set shortly after an unsuccessful performance at Carnegie Hall. The Carnegie Hall show was a real event, at which Barth, under advisement, had toned down the ribald material in her act and received a disappointing reception. The musical shows Barth contemplating the changes she should make to return to success with a forthcoming Miami show. The musical features a series of comic songs and uses several of Barth's own trademark jokes. Cast The show featured Bethany Thomas as Barth, Courtney Crouse as a number of male characters representing men from Barth's life, and Gerald H. Bailey as Barth's pianist. Performances The musical was workshopped at the STAGES 2008 Festival of New Musicals before premiering at Chicago's No Exit Caf√©. In November 2008 it moved to the Theo Ubique Theatre, where it ran through December. Critical reception The Chicago Reader called Koch's script \\"derivative and forgettable\\" but praised the performance of Bethany Thomas as Barth. Time Out Chicago was also impressed with Thomas's acting, but criticized the script as slight.

Currier is an English former professional rugby league and rugby union footballer who played in the 1980s, 1990s and 2000s. A Great Britain national representative goal-kicking , he played most of his club rugby with Widnes as well as stints with Featherstone Rovers (Heritage ‚Ññ 711), Warrington Wolves (Heritage ‚Ññ 924) and the Australian team Balmain Tigers. At the time of his retirement, he was co-holder of the Widnes club record for most points in a match, with 34. He played out the last years of his career with English rugby union teams. Son of Harry Currier, who in 1969 founded Widnes-based rugby league club, Halton Simms, Andy Currier began his professional career with Widnes. He later helped them to consecutive championships in 1988 and 1989, and then to victory in the 1989 World Club Challenge. During the 1988 Great Britain Lions tour he was flown to Australia as a replacement for the injured Garry Schofield. Currier moved to Australia to play with Sydney club, the Balmain Tigers, and became the NSWRL's top point scorer for the 1989 season. Currier also played in the memorable 1989 Winfield Cup Grand Final loss against Canberra at the end of that season. Currier played right-, i.e. number 3, and scored a try in Widnes' 24-18 victory over Salford in the 1990 Lancashire County Cup Final during the 1990‚Äì91 season at Central Park, Wigan on Saturday 29 September 1990. Currier played right-, i.e. number 3, and scored a conversion in Widnes' 6-12 defeat by Wigan in the 1988‚Äì89 John Player Special Trophy Final during the 1988‚Äì89 season at Burnden Park, Bolton on Saturday 7 January 1989, and played right-, i.e. number 3, and scored a conversion in the 24-0 victory over Leeds in the 1991‚Äì92 Regal Trophy Final during the 1991‚Äì92 season at Central Park, Wigan on Saturday 11 January 1992. At the end of the NSWRL 1990 season Currier returned to England to continue playing for Widnes, helping them to the Challenge Cup Final in 1993. At the end of that season he was purchased by Featherstone Rovers along with two other test players in a bold recruitment drive. He later played for Warrington and South Wales before ending his rugby league career with his original club, Widnes. Currier also played rugby union for London Welsh and Worcester following his retirement from rugby league.

During this time that she became involved with 'Trinity Players', appearing in over 30 productions as well as producing, designing, directing and even lighting various others. She is remembered for her ability to juggle a demanding under- graduate lecture and exams schedule with full-time theatre commitment. Career Her interest in theatre and politics led her to follow an autodidactic post graduate education in literature, theatre, acting and directing on various courses in London, Paris and Italy. During which time she wrote a number of avant-garde plays and movement pieces which were variously produced in England and Ireland. Most acclaimed was probably her long-running stage adaptation of Brian Merriman's poem, \\"The Midnight Court\\". Returning to Ireland, she continued to work as an actor and playwright until invited to write screenplays by various producers in the emergent Irish film industry of the early 1990s. At this point, she set up her own company, Pembridge Productions, to develop and produce feature film projects. The company was active as a co-producer on many Irish feature films and also produced three pictures which she wrote and directed. Words Upon the Window Pane, (adapted from the play by WB Yeats), This Is the Sea, (an adaptation of her own play 'Hazel' and Best, (the life story of Northern Irish footballer George Best); all essentially Irish subjects rooted in her cultural heritage. In 2001, she established Pembridge Pictures in the UK to develop and finance a slate of pictures for a long-term international production strategy by accessing UK tax-incentive based funding in co-production with treaty partners of the UK such as the EU treaty countries and Canada. The first of these to commence principal photography was her adaptation of the Thornton Wilder classic, The Bridge of San Luis Rey, delivered in May 2004, which shot in Spain. More lately, she has turned her interest and attention to the exploration of innovative film-making techniques aimed at integrating a more collaborative style of production in order to prioritize performance values with the aim of making contemporary drama more compelling to audiences. Using a combination of modern script styles and extended character development work with collaborating actors who then improvise their own dialogue directly on set, the first film of her 'amorality' trilogy, Rag Tale, was conceived. Allied to the latest in digital photographic and post production technology, her process continues to redefine the conventional linear filmmaking process into a much more integrated and collaborative style of filmmaking as many of the cast and crew of Rag Tale joined her on Intervention in New Mexico in 2006 and on Inconceivable in London and Las Vegas in 2007. The company of cast and crew which evolved in the making of the trilogy have spent the last year making 'The Making of Plus One, with Kate, Cate and George, The Story of a Hollywood Nobody'. A sort of 'Plus One' to the 'amorality trilogy', the picture commenced principal photography during The Cannes Film Festival in 2008, which setting explores the incongruous clash of the creative and commercial aspects of independent feature film making. It was completed in May 2009. Personal life She was married to John Lynch in 1997. They separated in 2008.

Alcian blue () is any member of a family of polyvalent basic dyes, of which the Alcian blue 8G (also called Ingrain blue 1, and C.I. 74240, formerly called Alcian blue 8GX from the name of a batch of an ICI product) has been historically the most common and the most reliable member. It is used to stain acidic polysaccharides such as glycosaminoglycans in cartilages and other body structures, some types of mucopolysaccharides, sialylated glycocalyx of cells etc. For many of these targets it is one of the most widely used cationic dyes for both light and electron microscopy. Use of alcian blue has historically been a popular staining method in histology especially for light microscopy in paraffin embedded sections and in semithin resin sections. The tissue parts that specifically stain by this dye become blue to bluish-green after staining and are called \\"Alcianophilic\\" (comparable to \\"eosinophilic\\" or \\"sudanophilic\\"). Alcian blue staining can be combined with H&E; staining, PAS staining and van Gieson staining methods. Alcian blue can be used to quantitate acidic glycans both in microspectrophotometric quantitation in solution or for staining glycoproteins in polyacrylamide gels or on western blots. Biochemists had used it to assay acid polysaccharides in urine since the 1960s for diagnosis of diseases like mucopolysaccharidosis but from 1970's, partly due to lack of availability of Alcian and partly due to length and tediousness of the procedure, alternative methods had to be developed e.g. Dimethyl methylene blue (DMB or DMMB) method.Clinical Chemistry March 1989 vol. 35 no. 3 374‚Äì379 Prof. J. E. Scott, the first person outside the dye Industry to crack the chemical secret of this dye comments: :\\"Probably no other dyestuff has been applied to such wide variety of problems in biology and medicine. On the other hand, no other dyestuff had such a chequered history as AB.\\" In addition to its wide use as a stain Alcian blue has also been used in other diverse applications e.g. gelling agent for lubricating fluids, modifiers for electrodes, charged coating agents etc. Alcian blue stain highlighting the goblet cells of Barrett's esophagus History The Monstral blue found to coat the inside of copper vessels used to process phthalic acid derivatives had led to the discovery of Phthalocyanine in 1907. Attracted by the brilliance, stability and insolubility of this chromophore, attempts were made to reversibly modify it so that it would be carried into fabric in a solution and then easily precipitated (ingrained) into an unleachable but finely well dispersed deposit (hence the name \\"ingrain dyeing\\"). From this attempt, Alcian blue (Ingrain blue 1) was first synthesized by the ICI dyestuffs department under N. H. Haddock and C. Wood in the early 1940s and patented in 1947, originally as a textile dye. In 1950 it was used by Steedman as a selective dye for mucins. While the popularity of Alcian blue expanded exponentially, the difficulty involved in its production due to environmentally hazardous intermediate steps made its availability difficult and ICI stopped producing it by 1973. Many of the alternate sources sold similar looking color products with unreliable staining. Prof J. E. Scott worked to decipher the chemistry of Alcian blue, which was known only to the Industry but kept as a tight trade secret. After spending 3 man-years of effort in 1972 he published the structure of Alcian blue and was able to get ICI to confirm it in 1973, incidentally in the same time that ICI also had just stopped producing it. After the interim crisis since the 1970s when ICI had to stop, there have now been environmentally safe alternative industrial manufacturing of this dye that is supposed to work as well as 8GX but is called 8G since it is made differently. In attempt to answer what was the importance of discovering an alternative method of manufacturing this compound, a company (Anatech Ltd, USA) that remanufactured Alcian blue says: :\\"Alcian blue is highly selective for the tissue substances (given the proper solution pH), and forms insoluble complexes that withstand harsh subsequent treatment (like PAS) without destaining. That is what makes this dye so important. Do any other dyes have this attribute? Yes, two others to be exact, out of thousands listed in the Colour Index and Conn's Biological Stains.\\" These two are 'Alcian yellow' and basic red 18, which are again both equally unavailable and also lack the brilliant contrast of the blue. Etymology and capitalization of \\"Alcian\\" Halcyon Kingfishers whose name comes from a Greek myth where Alcyone was converted to this bird and caused the calmness of the seas during the Halcyon Days. The etymology of the name is not certain, and whether to capitalize it is an editorial style choice. Two major scientific and medical dictionaries use the lowercase styling, but there is also worthy support for the capitalized styling (discussed below). According to Elsevier's dictionary of chemoetymology, the Alcian in Alcian blue might have been coined by contraction (and slight alteration) of phthalocyanine.\\".Alexander Senning. 2007. Elsevier's dictionary of chemoetymology. Amsterdam: Elsevier. p. 11. Oxford online dictionary mentions that it was a trademark and also specifies :\\"1940s: Alcian perhaps from (phth)al(o)cyan(ine) with a phonetic respelling\\". This hypothesis is consistent with the name of Alcian green, which is a tetraphenyl-phthalocyanine with copper. However Prof. J. E. Scott who had cracked the Chemistry of Alcian blue himself and later received confirmation from the manufacturer (ICI) wrote that Alcian was a trademark that ICI preferred to be spelt starting with a capital \\"A\\", and he presumes it came from the old English word \\"halcyon\\", which has a \\"romantic and poetic associations with the kingfisher bird and calm seas\\". Prof. Scott also states that Alcian green was merely a mixture of Alcian blue and Alcian yellow and not a single compound, which is also supported by thin layer chromatography data from various sources e.g. works by another dye expert Prof. R. W. Horobin‚Äîone of the two chief editors of the 10th edition of the 75-year-old Conn's Biological Stains Manual published on behalf of the Biological Stain Commission. Alcian yellow is an azo dye having neither a phthalocyanine ring nor any of the colors of the Kingfisher, but in common with Alcian blue, has hydrolyzable charged thiouronium side-chains and similar stability of the final stained product. On the other hand, there are other phthalocyanine dyes such as Luxol fast blue and Durazol blue, which have not acquired \\"Alcian\\" as a part of their names. Physical properties Color The solid Alcian blue is obtained as greenish-black (or sometimes dark bluish violet) crystals with metallic sheen. The aqueous solution is bright greenish-blue. Though the compound alcian blue itself is unstable (see stability below) the staining it produces is stable and light fast . Paradoxic lack of Metachromasia Unlike tricyclic thiazines (e.g. toluidine blue, methylene blue and azure A etc.), which are metachromatic due to switching from monomeric to stacked aggregates, Alcian blue is apparently orthochromatic. In common with Astra blue and other similar dyes, this property that it does not change color either by change in concentration or by combination with substrates, makes it very suitable for microspectrophotometry. The apparent lack of metachromasia is not because it is truly orthochromatic but because \\"it is already fully metachromatic\\" in aqueous solution. =Absorption maximum affected by aggregation= In aqueous solution large numbers of Alcian blue molecules stack together as micelles of very large size, too large to be even dialysed. Thus even at a fairly high dilution, it has an absorption maximum at ~600‚Äì615 nm, which is actually not the absorption maximum of a dye monomer but that of the multimer. Since the absorbed light is of yellow orange spectrum, the transmitted/reflected light is perceived by our eye as the complementary color of slightly greenish blue or cyan. In aqueous solution Alcian blues continue to be metachromatic at molar concentrations one hundredth those at which toluidine blue is mainly orthochromatic. Only a very small shoulder of the absorption curve at 670‚Äì680 nm represent the monomeric dye, which is usually the minority and becomes even lesser minority (<108M) in presence of salts. However, when the solvent is DMSO‚Äîa non-protic solvent of moderately high dielectric constant, Alcian blue does not aggregate and a big monomeric absorption peak can be well visualized. A similar spectral shift to the longer monomeric peak is also observed when solvents like ethanol (or ethanol water mixture) is used as a vehicle or when nonionic detergents like Triton X-100 are used, that make exogenous micelles. Molar extinction coefficient Alcians blue carries Phthalocyanine one of the most highly colored chromophores yet known with a molar extinction of 120,000 i.e. Alcian blue is detectable at half the molar concentration of popular dyes like toluidine blue, tryarylmethanes (e.g. pararosaniline and the analogous Schiff bases used in PAS stain, Crystal violet in Gram stain) etc. Solubility It is water- soluble. When each of the pair of substituents on the pendant group nitrogens are toluyl, the solubility in water at 20 ¬∞C is about 9.5% w/w; and similarly a few other solubilities are: 6.0% in absolute ethanol, 6.0% in Cellosolve and 3.25% ethylene glycol, whereas it is practically insoluble in xylene. In relative/partitioning terms, Alcian Blue 8G has a log octanol-water Partition coefficient (Log P) of ‚àí9.7, suggesting it is rather water-soluble (lipid- soluble if Log P > 0, and good lipid stains generally have a Log P > 7). Methanol is an acceptable substitute for ethanol as a potential vehicle for Alcian blue, but isopropanol is not, because, within a few hours all of suspended Alcian blue precipitates if isopropanol is tried as a vehicle. Melting point The sample compound with Merck index number 218 has a melting point of 148 ¬∞C. Chemistry It is a tetravalent basic (cationic) dye with a copper (Cu2+, coordination 4 of 6, orbital configuration d9 with Jahn‚ÄìTeller distortion) phthalocyanine nucleus (CuPc) with three or four pendent isothiouronium side chains imparting its bulkiness and positive charges. In order to qualify as an alcian blue family member there has to be at least 2 side chains and the mixtures often have 3 chains in average to qualify as 8G. Four tetramethylisothiouronium groups per molecule are shown in the picture. ICI had claimed an average of about three side chains per molecule, but analyses by Prof Scotts lab suggested between three and four. Most of them are at the 2(3) positions, as in the formula and sometimes a cartoon representation uses the methylene bridge criss crossing across the bond between these two positions to indicate that it could bind either of these two positions. A large number of isomers, differing in the positions of the cationic groups, are possible. Alcian blue 7GX carries fewer isothiouronium groups than 8GX. Similarly 5GX and 2GX may have even fewer side groups but it was not rigorously proven. The phthalocyanine aromatic nucleus has a large conjugated system with a CBN (Conjugated bond number) of 48. However it is the charges on the isothiouronium side groups that still keeps it water-soluble. These side groups can carry bulkier alkyl or aryl substituents rather than the 8x2 methyl groups as in the image given. These groups split off from the macrocyclic ring during the washing at the end of staining or by rather mild conditions (e.g. pH above 5.6) or during spontaneous degradation. The metals in the Phthallocyanine nucleus and substituted groups directly attached to the aromatic nucleus determine colors of the members of the metal phthallocyanine family e.g. Alcian Blue and the copper phthalocyanine itself are blue, but brominated or chlorinated copper phthalocyanine and sulfonated copper phthalocyanine are green. Alcian Blue has a relatively high solubility in salt solutions and stains slower than other dyes. By changing pH or ambient salt concentrations characteristic staining patterns can be obtained. pH controlled staining At pH 1.0 it stains only sulfated polysaccharides and at pH 2.5 also stains carboxyl group containing sugars such as sialic acids and uronic acids intensify the stain of hyaluronic acids, which would also stain albeit relatively weakly by their half sulfate esters at pH 1.0. Electrolyte controlled staining A staining method where at a fixed pH of about 5.5, different critical salt concentration (classically MgCl2, but NaCl, KCl, LiBr are potential alternatives) can be used where the smaller (faster diffusing) salt cation competes with alcian blue to bind to the anionic sites. Target material specific critical electrolyte concentration (CEC) is supposed to selectively identify sulphated, carboxylated and phosphated structures for example as the targets. Stability According to John A. Kiernan‚Äîone of the editors of the 10th edition of Conn's Biological Stains\\" 10th ed 2002 published on behalf of the Biological Stain Commission: Alcian blue 8G differs from most other dyes in that it can deteriorate even in the solid state, changing to an insoluble pigment. Acidic solutions of alcian blue 8G are often stable for some years. Churukian's lab manual gives a recommended shelf life of 6 months. An alcian blue solution with a precipitate should be discarded and replaced, not filtered and used. Some dyes sold as alcian blue 8G are unstable in solutions at pH 5.6 and above; they precipitate in less than 24 hours. Batches of alcian blue that do not form stable solutions cannot be used in Scott's \\"critical electrolyte concentration\\" methods for histochemical characterization of different glycosaminoglycans, which require solutions at pH 5.7-5.8 with variable concentrations of MgCl2. The pyridine variant of alcian blue (Alcian Blue-tetrakis(methylpyridinium) chloride, CAS 123439-83-8, CB6503730, PubChem 24860335) is more stable than the original alcian blue dyes and may be just as good as a stain. Explanation of staining selectivity Nucleic acids are generally basophilic because they have a very high density of negative charge due to the sugar phosphate backbone. However, in contrast to other basic i.e. cationic dyes, Alcian blue usually (given the right pH and salt concentrations, and normal temperature and duration in minutes, not hours) preferably stains acidic glycosaminoglycans but not the chromatin and nissel substance, the mechanism of which had been a mystery for a long time and various theories were proposed. Though the presumed basis of the staining is its positive charge attracted to negative structures (e.g. acidic sugars), bulkiness (width 2.5‚Äì3 nm, compared to toluidine blue ~0.7 x1.1 nm) makes its diffusion very slow in less permeable parts of the tissue and thus prevent it from staining highly negative yet compact structures such as chromatin and nissl substance. However prolonged staining (few days at 25 ¬∞C) or DNA denaturing conditions may allow Alcian blue to also stain the nucleus. The isolation of the positive charge from the aromatic electron cloud by the intervening methylene bridges makes the localized positive charged regions \\"hard\\" ions in contrast to soft ions where the charge is delocalized over the whole aromatic pi cloud. When these hard cations encounter the hard anions e.g. in form of sulfate they form salts without regard for the precise chemical nature of the anion. The resulting salts are highly stable but can be slowly exchanged with high concentration of salts. Washing with water or alkali treatment after staining causes base catalyzed hydrolysis and removal of the pendant positively charged side chains and the resulting compound is Phthalocyanine Blue, which forms a blue water-insoluble dye precipitate. The precipitates are so robust that they withstand harsh conditions like PAS or other counterstaining and also dehydration and embedding treatments (in contrast toluidine blue is partially extracted away during dehydration). This unleachability is the chemical basis of the ingrain dyeing for which AB (Ingrain blue 1) was originally designed by the dye industry. Manufacturing and purity The historic Alcian Blue varied so much batch to batch that only the 8GX (e.g. not even the 8GS) batch produced by ICI was later decided to be the biologically useful ones. Commercially available batches usually contained about 49% of the actual dye and rest used to be Sulfate, boric acid, dextrin and other impurities and by various extraction methods up to 80% pure extracts can be made. Actually the dye does not necessary contain all 4 substituents but might contain 2 or 3 of them and have various geometric isomers. But anyhow the manufacture of 8GX by ICI had stopped by Mid-1970s because of environmental hazards and very small lots were available that were received from alternate sources. Only recently Alcian Blue has been re manufactured in bulk using safer procedures but the newer product does not have the suffix X (or S) since the manufacture process (and the exact product composition) is somewhat different. Material safety Alcian blue is an eye and respiratory tract irritant. Solid Alcian blue is a combustible powder and should never be handled close to heat or a naked flame. Heating Alcian blue produces toxic fumes of nitrogen compounds. It can react violently if mixed with oxidising materials. The solution of Alcian blue is a skin sensitiser and corrosive (partly due to the acidic pH needed to maintain it unhydrolyzed in solution) and harmful by skin absorption. Most vendor MSDS (Material safety datasheet) mention that effect of ingestion not known or target organ not known. However some do mention that potential target organs are teeth and kidneys. Uses in Dye Industry This stain was originally discovered by ICI in the 1940s as a member of the competitive dye industry for the purpose of industrial dying. It was used for some time for staining textiles, leather products and inks. ICI sold thousands of tons of alcian blue and filed multiple patents regarding its manufacturing process to keep its chemistry a tight secret. However ICI had had trouble with the dye's solubility under textile dyeing conditions, and various process changes in manufacturing were made during the 1950s and 1960s. Uses in biological staining Drug interference in staining Uses other than as a dye or stain In addition to its use as a dye or stain Alcian blue also finds other material science uses. Adhesive Alcian blue has been used as an adhesive to help stick glycol methacrylate sections to glass slides (which have negatively charged silicate groups). Coating agent Alcian blue carrying a large aromatic surface that can participate in Van der Waal's interaction as well as multiple localized charges. Thus it can be coated onto surfaces and significantly modify surface property and charge.

Some parts of the company evolved into the present Milacron, Inc. and Cincinnati Machine. CMM relied heavily on castings for the manufacturing of its machine tool products. The castings were produced at Cincinnati foundries owned by CMM (and later, Milacron, Inc.) and at foundries independent of CMM, between 1907 and 1988. Beginnings of CMM reliance on castings In 1884 the Cincinnati Screw and Tap Company was incorporated. The company was in the business of making screws and taps, but also began to make machine tools. A basic component in machine tools at this time was gray iron castings. The company bought castings from jobbing foundries for the machine tools it manufactured. Some of the Cincinnati local foundries which supplied to the machine tool company included the Blackburn Foundry, Buckeye Foundry Company, The Steel Foundry Company (Cincinnati) and others. In 1889 the screw and tap business was sold off, as the company focused on machine tool business. It was renamed as the Cincinnati Milling Machine Co. (CMM). CMM continued to operate in the central business district of Cincinnati and purchased castings from a number of local foundries. In 1905 the company was sold in total to Frederick A. Geier, who became president. Geier had been a partner in the concern previously. Until this time the company had had some problems with the locations in the business district: at least one flood and a fire had caused it to relocate. Relocation to Oakley A map showing the location of the Modern Foundry on the left side of the map, at the corner of Marburg and Disney Avenue. The Factory Power building is to the left. Rail tracks were laid to bring raw materials into the power station and the foundry, and to move products from the foundry. Click on image to enlarge. In October 1906 CMM announced plans for a new vertically integrated factory to be built in Oakley, a suburb of Cincinnati.The Foundry; Penton Publications; Cleveland, OH; October, 1906; page 137 A site was purchased which was named the Factory Colony. This site was developed to include a two-story administration building 62 x , a foundry building 62 x , a building for cleaning castings and storing 62 x , a charging building 62 x , and a pattern shop 62 x . These buildings would be all of brick and steel construction. A few months later the company announced the foundry would be 350 x , with the pattern shop to be 50 x . A power house would also be erected with a size of 75 x 100 feet.The Foundry, Penton Publications, Cleveland, OH, January, 1907, page 372 The foundry was planned to provide castings to all companies which would locate to the new industrial park. Geier reasoned a captive foundry operation was needed because ‚Äú‚Ä¶the uncertain supply of castings had been a great handicap to production at a time when demand was far greater than our ability to supply‚Ä¶ ‚Äù.1884‚Äì1984 Cincinnati Milacron, Finding Better Ways, The Hennegan Co. (1983), ASIN: B000CFLJ3K A few months after making the construction announcement, CMM announced they were leasing a foundry on Patternson Street in Cincinnati, to be occupied be the Modern Foundry until the construction was completed in Oakley.The Foundry, Penton Publications, Cleveland, OH, May, 1907; Industrial Notes, page 209 The Modern Foundry was the beginnings of what became the Foundry Products Operations of the Cincinnati Milling Machine Company. The foundry was erected by the Interstate Engineering Company,The Bridgemen's Magazine, Vol VII, No. I, p 342 opening in 1907. It was the first production facility in the new Industrial Park, as a separate organization called the Modern FoundryMemoirs of the Miami Valley, John Calvin Hover et al., published by Robert O. Law Company, Chicago, 1920 and was located at the corner of Marburg and Disney Street in Oakley. The new foundry was fully operational by 1908 and could melt 30 tons per day in its cupolas.1884‚Äì1984 Cincinnati Milacron, Finding Better Ways, The Hennegan Co. (1983), ASIN: B000CFLJ3K The foundry also organized with other foundries in Cincinnati: Lunkenheimer, Buckeye Foundry Company and the John B. Morris Foundry, to form the Associated Foundries of Cincinnati,The Cincinnati Industrial Magazine, Cincinnati, OH; July 1910 supplying castings to Cincinnati industry. The first manager of the Modern Foundry was Walter H. Geier. By the mid-1930s the Factory Colony was considered one of the world's largest manufacturers of machine tools and employed thousands of workers.Cincinnati, a Guide to the Queen City and Its Neighbors, by the Ohio Federal Writer's project, The Weisen-Hart Press, Cincinnati, OH 1943 Chosen to represent the foundry industry in a mural A mural at Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport, originally at the Cincinnati Union Terminal depicting Foundry products operations (Cincinnati Milling Machine) Winold Reiss was contracted to produce murals depicting workers in Cincinnati industries, for the new Cincinnati Union Terminal. To depict the foundry industry, he visited the Modern Foundry to get ideas and set a scene for one of the murals, called Foundry and Machine Shop Products. In this mural, a man (modeled by Joseph Schwope, 1898‚Äì1980) is skimming a ladle of iron, while an iron pourer (modeled by Bill Rengering, 1901‚Äì1985) pours a mold. A metallurgist (modeled by Emil Weston, 1900‚Äì1990) measures the metal temperature using an optical pyrometer. In the background a cupola tender (Bill Ennix, 1886‚Äì1944) watches over the work. One source credits the model for the cupola tender as being Howard Fredericks. A copy of the original photograph is shown in the book They Built a City: 150 Years of Industrial Cincinnati.They Built A City: 150 Years of Industrial City, published by The Cincinnati Post, 1938, page 182 After visiting the Modern Foundry for a couple days, and after everything was arranged as Reiss wanted to capture the depiction of the foundry industry, the photograph was taken during the pouring of a mold. Reiss made a sketch of the elements he wanted to include from the photograph, simplifying certain elements for his mural. He submitted this sketch to the Ravenna Mosaic Company of Italy for production into the tesserae medium of the mosaic. The glass tesserae pieces were attached to paper and shipped to Cincinnati Union Terminal. The paper-backed pieces were pressed into the plaster on the terminal wall. Interstitial places were filled with colored mortar. In 1973, when the terminal concourse was to be torn down, this mural and 13 others by Reiss were carefully removed and transported for display at Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport. Preparations for a new expansion, gearing up for war In the early 1930s Frederick V. Geier (son of Frederick A. Geier) was sent to Germany to explore the possibility of establishing an operation there for manufacturing machine tools. He was shocked by the scale of industrial development and concluded a war in Europe was imminent.Cincinnati Magazine, January 1994, page 33 He believed that the United States needed to make changes to support its needs and those of its allies. The foundry operation was licensed to produce iron under the Meehanite process in 1935 for the cupola operation. In 1937 the Blackburn Foundry was taken over to support production of large castings. In 1938, based on his studies of what was happening in Europe and despite a deep recession, Geier launched a program to double the plant size, including construction of a new foundry. New Foundry The New Foundry opened and poured its first heat by December 1940, about a year before the Attack on Pearl Harbor. With the opening of the New Foundry, the company tore down the old Modern Foundry. At this site, it developed additional machining and assembly space, which enabled a sevenfold increase in production during World War II. The Modern Foundry poured its last heat in 1941. The Metal Fabricating Division foundry, as it came to be called, supplied all the needs of the Cincinnati Milling Machine Company and its successor, Milacron, Inc. At least three buildings were constructed, totaling more than . Pouring a large mold is a fiery sight. To the left, flames are shooting from an escape hole -- caused by gas generated by the contact of iron with the relatively cool sand, graphite, linseed oil and other ingredients involved in the mold structure. The man at the left is wielding a skimmer to hold back any impurities floating on the surface of the ladle iron. This photo was taken in January 1942 by the Farm Security Administration but the foundry name was not published for security reasons. It is held in the Office of War Information Photograph Collection (Library of Congress). By 1942 the Cincinnati Milling Machine Company Foundry (CMM Co. Foundry) was producing 35,000 tons of castings, with an additional 32,000 tons being purchased from other sources. Melting in the New Foundry was done by up to four cupola furnaces. Production in the foundry was around the clock, seven days a week. Additional castings were needed, and the ‚ÄòMill‚Äô turned to outside Cincinnati local foundries. At total of 27 outside foundries were also supplying castings to the Mill.James J. Benes, \\"Machining for Freedom\\", American Machinist, August 1, 1998 Army-Navy ‚ÄòE‚Äô Award Cincinnati Milling Machine received the prestigious Army-Navy ‚ÄòE‚Äô Award on March 6, 1942, in part through the efforts of the New Foundry and the other local foundries in supplying thousands of castings, which were used to produce 17,511 machine tools in 1942 alone to gear up for war. Late in the World War 2 era, they dropped production considerably, to less than half of that amount, to about 15,000 tons per year. Post war At the end of the war and into the 1950s, production stabilized at about 12,000 tons per year, with purchased castings at about 3,000 tons per year. The CMM Co. Foundry also produced castings for direct sales to other customers, but at a low rate of about 1,000 tons per year. Because the foundry was wholly owned by CMM, other machine tool makers were reluctant to have their competitor making castings for them. In the late postwar period, Cincinnati local foundries had an excess production capacity. The production of castings was similar to the way they were made since the early days of founding. Molding was done with green sand until sometime in the 1960s or 1970s, when the furan molding process was adopted for medium and large sized castings. Melting continued using the cupola. Most requirements on the foundry were for gray iron, the material normally used in machine tool castings. With the discovery of ductile iron, the foundry began producing ductile in the 1950s, using open ladle treatments or the Gazal porous plug process. Not many machine tool parts were needed in ductile iron. Castings for overseas production facilities In 1964 Milacron constructed an entirely new foundry in England to supply castings for its European machine tool business. This foundry was known as Cincinnati Milacron Ltd, Foundry Operations, Tamworth, England.Mechanical Handling, Published by The L. Cassier Co., Ltd., 1966, v.53 1966 Jul-Dec In the 1970s and 1980s the company was the largest single employer in Biggleswade, Bedfordshire, England.Cincinnati Milacron Biggleswade's Biggest Employer\\", Biggleswade Today Change in the 1970s In the 1970s, great changes came to the machine tool industry, especially in Cincinnati, OH. Milacron diversified its interests by developing machines that made plastic products . A large part of its success in making machinery was in the use of ductile iron in the plastic injection machinery . No longer captive, the foundry is set free In 1988, Cincinnati Milacron, Inc. restructured and reorganized the company. It sold the Met-Fab Division facility, including the Oakley foundry.Foundry Management & Technology, Robert C. Rodgers, August 1988 In the previous ten-year period, Milacron had invested more than $8 million in the plant. The sale represented the end of the Foundry products operations (Cincinnati Milling Machine). The modernized New Foundry was adapted as a metalcasting operation that supplies many companies and customers with a full range of gray and ductile iron castings. Named Cast-Fab Technologies, Inc., this foundry continues in operation supplying castings for customers around the world. As of the end of the year 2012, the entire 100-acre site that once held the Cincinnati Milling Machine Company was cleared to bare ground.

After he returned to Sint Eustatius, he married Maria Heyliger, a daughter of the ruling Commander (Governor) Abraham Heyliger.

On 16 November 1776, at the beginning of the American Revolutionary War, the American navy ship USS Andrew Doria, with the American Declaration of Independence on board, arrived in St. Eustatius. Its captain fired a salute to the Dutch flag on Fort Oranje and Johannes de Graaff decided to answer the salute with eleven gunshots. And so the United States of America were for the first time recognized as a nation by this salute of eleven guns. The British were furious and De Graaff was called to the Netherlands following British protests to the Dutch government. He explained his deeds and was sent back to Sint Eustatius.

Maley started his career with Sunderland and progressed through the youth system at the club. He was loaned out to lower-league sides Blackpool, Northampton Town and York City, making a number of appearances in the Football League. His career was brought to an end after accidentally being shot in the eye by Sunderland teammate John Oster with an air gun in 2002. Club career Maley was born in Newcastle upon Tyne, Tyne and Wear and started his footballing career with Sunderland after progressing through their youth system. He made his first team debut after starting at right back in a League Cup first round second leg game against York City on 18 August 1998, which Sunderland won 2‚Äì1. This proved to be his only appearance of the 1998‚Äì99 season. He made another appearance in this competition the following season, starting in a 3‚Äì2 victory over Walsall, before being substituted for Michael Gray on 80 minutes. His third, and eventually final appearance for Sunderland came in a 3‚Äì0 victory over Luton Town in a second round League Cup tie on 19 September 2000. Less than a month later, he was loaned out to Third Division team Blackpool for a month. His debut came in a 2‚Äì2 draw with Southend United in a Football League game on 8 October and made one further appearance in a 2‚Äì0 defeat to Plymouth Argyle. He was soon sent out on loan again, joining Northampton Town for a month, and again made two appearances, featuring in defeats to Walsall and Swindon Town. He joined York City on an initial month's loan on 27 September 2001, which materialised as part of an agreement between the two clubs, with Sunderland loaning some players out to York. He made his debut two days later, playing at left back in a 3‚Äì1 victory over Lincoln City. The loan was extended for a second month in November and hinted he may have been interested in signing for the club permanently. He was handed the first red card of his career in a 2‚Äì0 defeat to Scunthorpe United. He suffered from a knee injury during an FA Cup tie against Colchester United on 17 November, which led to him undergoing a late fitness test for their game against Swansea City, and was able to play, entering the game as a substitute. The loan was extended for a third month on 22 November. It was extended until the end of the 2001‚Äì02 season on 18 December, but he was forced to return to Sunderland in March 2002 after suffering from a thigh injury. He finished his spell at the club with 17 appearances in all competitions. He was accidentally shot in the eye by Sunderland teammate John Oster with an air gun at Oster's home in April 2002, with neither believing the gun was loaded, which resulted in Maley undergoing emergency surgery. This led to Maley's career being brought to an end at the age of 21. The pair came to an out-of-court settlement over the incident in February 2007. International career Maley was an England schoolboy international and captained the England under-18 team.

Along with bands such as Backyard Babies and Buckcherry, they were called the new blood of glam punk. They were also mentioned in the introduction to Brett Callwood's biography of The Stooges. Characteristics Formed in 2006 by Mark Thorn, the former vocalist for Dead Famous, and Zuri Warsaw on bass guitar, the band quickly recruited Dead Famous' old drummer Mike Fury and Rich van Kerr on guitar. After an initial period with Thorn combining both singing and guitar duties and the recording of the EP 'St Valentine's Day Massacre' in 2007, Jonni Scarlett was recruited to play lead guitar. He was replaced before an Eastern European tour, which included concerts in Zagreb, Belgrade, Sofia and Plovdiv, by Tommy Vommit, the name being given to him by Rich van Kerr after a heavy night of drinking. In 2008 the song 'Rock 'n' Roll Loser' was featured on the cover CD \\"Sons of Guns III\\" for Classic Rock Magazine. During the same period, original drummer Mike Fury left the band and was replaced by Dave666 of B-Movie Vampires fame. They also featured on compilation CDs of the UK fanzine Bubblegum Slut and in 2009 supported L.A. Guns and Warrior Soul on their London dates. Their debut album 'Screwphoria!' was released in 2011.

The exact role and standing of examining magistrates varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction; common duties and powers of the examining magistrate include overseeing ongoing criminal investigations, issuing search warrants, authorizing wiretaps, making decisions on pretrial detention, interrogating the accused person, questioning witnesses, examining evidence, and compiling a dossier of evidence in preparation for trial. Examining magistrates have an important role in the French judiciary, and are also a feature of the Spanish, Dutch, Belgian and Greek criminal justice systems, although the extent of the examining magistrate's role has generally diminished over time. Several countries, including Switzerland, Germany, Portugal, and Italy, have abolished the position of examining magistrate outright. Role and description John Henry Merryman and Rogelio P√©rez-Perdomo have described the examining magistrate's role in civil-law systems as follows: Comparison to common-law systems The role of the examining magistrate is important in civil-law jurisdictions such as France, which have an inquisitorial system. In contrast, common-law jurisdictions such as England and the United States have an adversarial system and lack a comparable official. Frequent close interaction with police and prosecutors \\"may well condition examining magistrates to favor the long-term interests of regular participants over those of the accused.\\" This problem also affects common-law jurisdictions, although it has been noted that \\"in the United States, the focus of concern has been the independence of counsel for the defense, while in France, concern focuses on the independence of the examining magistrate.\\" The examination phase has been described as \\"the most controversial aspect of criminal procedure\\" in civil-law jurisdictions because of \\"[t]he secrecy and length of the proceedings, the large powers enjoyed by examining magistrates\\" and \\"the possibility for abuse inherent in the power of the individual magistrate to work in secret and to keep people incarcerated for long periods.\\" Some commentators, however, have compared the examining magistrate's role favorably to that of the grand jury in common-law systems. Scholar George C. Thomas III finds that while the grand jury as it exists in U.S. law is an effective investigative function, it lacks the screening functions that the French system has. Thomas notes that under U.S. Supreme Court precedent, U.S. prosecutors are not obliged to present exculpatory evidence to grand juries, and as a result grand jurors hear only evidence from the prosecution; by contrast, under the French system, the French examining magistrate operates as an investigator, and the indicting chamber acts as a screening body expressly responsible for seeking the truth. By country Use of the examining magistrate has declined in Europe over time. Spain, France, Croatia, the Netherlands, Belgium and Greece are among the countries to retain the practice, and in all of these nations the examining magistrate's role has been diminished, with a general trend of restricting the examining magistrate's involvement to only \\"serious crimes or sensitive cases\\" or having the examining magistrate share responsibility with the public prosecutor. Switzerland, Germany, Portugal, and Italy have all abolished the examining-magistrate system. France =History= √âric Halphen, formerly a French investigative judge In France, the investigative judge (', \\"judge of inquiry\\") has been a feature of the judicial system since the mid-19th century, and the preliminary investigative procedure has been a part of the judicial system from at least the 17th century. The sweeping powers traditionally entrusted to the ' were so broad that Honor√© de Balzac called the examining magistrate \\"the most powerful man in France\\" in the 19th century. In a celebrated although exaggerated passage, Balzac wrote that \\"No human authority, neither the king nor the minister of justice nor the prime minister can intrude on the power of the examining magistrate, no one can stop him, nobody gives him orders. He is sovereign, obeying only his conscience and the law.\\" Later, however, the authority of the examining magistrates in France diminished in a series of reforms. In 1985, French justice minister Robert Badinter proposed limiting the examining magistrate's role in making custody decisions; 's successor, Albin Chalandon made the same proposal two years later. In 1990, Justice Minister Pierre Arpaillange convened a Human Rights Commission ('), led by the legal scholar Mireille Delmas-Marty. The commission concluded that France's criminal procedure code violated human rights standards, noting that the examining magistrate combined investigative and judicial powers in a single person. The commission proposed a package of due process reforms, including the abolition of the post of examining magistrate and the creation of a \\"liberty judge\\" (') in its place. Under the proposed system, the prosecutor and the police would have sole responsibility for conducting the investigation, and the liberty judge would be charged with overseeing pre-trial investigations. This proposal prompted an outcry from the conservative judiciary, as well as from scholars and the media; \\"in the context of repeated investigations of Socialist Party officials, the proposition appeared self-interested.\\" Less extensive reforms were adopted instead; legislation coming into effect in 1994 provided a right to counsel for persons in police custody ('), and also transferred the decision on bail and pretrial detention \\"to a team of magistrates not involved in the particular case.\\" Almost immediately, however, opponents of the reforms mobilized, upset with the substantial changes to historic French practice; several magistrates resigned in protest. The new minister of justice, Pierre M√©haignerie, pledged repeal, and the reforms were reversed in August 1993, when a new law repealed the right to have counsel at the beginning of police detention (but retained the right to have counsel after 20 hours of detention); restored \\"the powers of the 'solitary' examining magistrate involved in the case to bail or remand\\"; and again restricted the accused's access to the investigative dossier. Reforms resumed in 2000, with the enactment of the Guigou Law, following the issuance of the report of the Truche Commission and a proposal for revision of the French code of criminal procedure by Mich√®le-Laure Rassat. Among other reforms, the 2000 law abolished the power of the examining magistrate to remand defendants into custody and created a new specialized judicial officer, the judge of liberty and detention (') to make these determinations. Renewed calls for further reform to abolish or diminish the powers of the French examining magistrate intensified after a series of botched investigations, including what became known as the Outreau scandal; in that case, more than a dozen people near Boulogne were wrongfully imprisoned (and about half wrongfully convicted) on false charges of child abuse after a flawed investigation by an inexperienced juge. In 2009 and 2010, President Nicolas Sarkozy unsuccessfully attempted to abolish the post of examining magistrate as part of a broader package of legal reforms. =Today= Today, examining magistrates (') are one of four types of French magistrates, the others being trial judges ('), public prosecutors ('), and policymaking and administrative magistrates at the Ministry of Justice. Each ' is appointed by the president of France upon the recommendation of the Ministry of Justice and serves renewable three-year terms. Magistrates \\"can move between these four categories, and their career prospects may be subject to the political interests of the government (although promotions must be approved by a high council of the magistrature chaired in the past by the President of the Republic and now by the president of the '.\\" This arrangement has prompted criticism on the ground that the judiciary is not fully independent of the government. In 1996, political scientist Herbert Jacobs described the still-extensive powers and authority of the examining magistrate: Examining magistrates initiate an investigation upon an order of the ' (public prosecutor), or upon the request of a private citizen. The ' may issue search warrants, order the seizure of necessary evidence, compel witnesses to appear and give evidence, and request expert testimony; at an investigative hearing, the ' may have witnesses confront each other or the accused. They may also authorize wiretaps. At a later plenary hearing in open court, the investigative judge may issue an order of ' (\\"no case\\") or, if the evidence is sufficient, will commit the case to the trial court. Charges of a serious misdemeanor or lesser felonies go to the criminal court directly. In contrast, major felonies are referred to the Court of Appeal for the pretrial hearing. The Court of Appeal decides whether to approve the 's recommendation, and if it does the case is turned over to the Assize Court. Examining magistrates are not involved at trials, although, in France, criminal trials are \\"in many respects a continuation of the pretrial investigation\\" with the trial judge acting as the leading figure in the examination of witnesses. In the year 2000, only about 7% of criminal investigations in France were directed by a '. By 2010, that number had declined further to 4%, with police overseeing the rest. Notably, in 2002, there were 562 investigating magistrates in France, with some 60,000 investigations ongoing at any given moment, so caseloads were large and individual attention to each was difficult. Nevertheless, examining magistrates \\"are seen as important, independent arbiters, examining the most sensitive and serious allegations.\\" A few examining magistrates, such as Renaud Van Ruymbeke, Thierry Jean-Pierre, and √âric Halphen have become widely known for their investigations into corruption and political scandals; such figures have investigated high-level government officials, including prime ministers, and made widely publicized visits to the headquarters of the major French political parties, reflecting their broad powers. In France, many magistrates belong to trade unions. About 60% belong to the Union syndicale des magistrats (USM), which is center-right, while about 30% belong to the leftist Syndicat de la Magistrature (SM). The unions represent the interests of magistrates, but by French law are barred from striking.Antoine Garapon & Harold Epineuse, \\"Judicial Independence in France\\" in Judicial Independence in Transition (ed. Anja Seibert-Fohr: Springer, 2012), p. 295. Spain In Spain, a ' is an examining judge, and a ' is the office of an examining judge. Each investigating judge is responsible for investigating \\"all kind of criminal cases committed in his district, except those cases that fall under the jurisdiction of the National Court (') or where another court has jurisdiction '.\\" In addition to investigating crimes of all sorts, \\"the investigating judges are competent to try petty offense cases.\\" Among the most famous Spanish investigating judges was Baltasar Garz√≥n, a polarizing figure known for investigating high-profile corruption and human rights cases. Garz√≥n was known for invoking the doctrine of universal jurisdiction to issue an international arrest warrant for Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet, leading to his apprehension in London in 1998. Garz√≥n also gained attention for overseeing an inquiry into atrocities committed during the Spanish Civil War (despite a 1977 amnesty act) and human rights abuses committed during the dictatorship of Francisco Franco. Garz√≥n was convicted of illegal wiretapping in 2012 and was suspended from the bench for 11 years.. Andorra The small European nation of Andorra has investigating magistrates; in 2018, for example, an investigating magistrate in the country issued indictments against 28 people, including former Venezuelan officials, on charges of money laundering.Aritz Parra, Andorra charges Venezuelan ex-officials for money laundering, Associated Press (September 13, 2018). Belgium and the Netherlands Both Belgium and the Netherlands retain the examining judge in some cases; examining judges investigate in 5% of cases in Belgium and 2% of cases in the Netherlands. In Belgium, criminal proceedings are usually initiated by the public prosecutor (' or '), who typically decides whether to issue a summons to a suspect ordering him or her to appear in court. However, in \\"more serious or complicated cases\\" the prosecutor can defer to matter to the examining magistrate (' or '), who is an independent judge and member of the tribunal of first instance (' or '). The ' has the power to question suspects, but not under oath; he or she may also question witnesses, issue search warrants, and issue detention orders. The ' generates a report on the outcome of the investigation and then refers it to the ', an arm of the court, to decide whether to dismiss the case, allow it to proceed, or (in certain circumstances) to refer it to another court. The role of the ' role is unusual, because he or she is simultaneously a judge and an officer of the '. In the Netherlands, the position of examining magistrate has existed since 1926, and the powers of the office were strengthened in 1999. Dutch public prosecutors are charged with supervising criminal investigations and ensuring the \\"legitimacy, fairness and overall integrity\\" of the investigation and pretrial proceedings. In addition to their investigative role, examining magistrate is also charged with making determinations as to the lawfulness of arrests and as to pretrial detention. The examining magistrate specifically reviews the public prosecutor's request to use some intrusive special investigative techniques when the prosecutor requests the magistrate to do so. For the most intrusive modes of investigation, such as wiretapping or other telecommunication intercepts, public prosecutors must secure the approval of the examining magistrate. Latin America In Latin America, the investigative (' or ') phase of a criminal prosecution was historically overseen by an examining magistrate, preceding the trial (') phase. In the first phase, an examining magistrate interviewed the witnesses, questioned the accused, examined evidence, and created a dossier before making a recommendation to the trial judge as to whether the defendant should be discharged or tried. Formerly, in Chile, Paraguay, Uruguay, and Venezuela, \\"no distinction was made between the examining magistrate, who is responsible for the investigation, and the judge, who issues the rulings. This distinction was considered very important in Europe, where these functions were separated to promote the impartiality of the court.\\" In Chile, for example, examining magistrates formerly had the \\"triple role\\" of overseeing the investigation, rendering a verdict, and passing a sentence. By the end of the 20th century, most Latin American countries followed Germany in eliminating the examination phase. In 1998, Venezuela enacted a legal reform that ended the secrecy of the sumario phase and bolstered the ability of accused persons to prepare a defense. Beginning in 2002, Chile began to incorporate more adversarial aspects into its inquisitorial system, and this reform was implemented fully by 2005. The transition to a separation of judicial and investigative roles meant that public prosecutors (fiscales) obtained many responsibilities that were historically performed by investigative magistrates. However, investigations in past human rights abuses in Chile have continued to use investigative magistrates at the first stage. Greece Greece, which follows a French-style legal system, has retained the investigative magistrate. In Greece, the investigative magistrate interviews witnesses, reviews the evidence, and refers cases to the public prosecutor, who makes the ultimate charging decision. Greek investigative magistrates can also issue arrest warrants. Countries where the position was abolished =Italy= Italy abolished the examining magistrate in 1989, as part of a broader overhaul of the Italian Code of Criminal Procedure. The reform transferred the investigative functions of the examining magistrate to public prosecutors, who in Italy are also considered judges. The reform transferred the oversight functions of examining magistrates to newly created judges of the preliminary investigation with specified duties, including the issuance of search warrants, the authorization of wiretaps, and the decision on pretrial detention. The replacement of examining magistrates was not the only element of the 1989 reform that \\"marked a departure from the inquisitorial French tradition and partly subscribed to adversarial assumptions\\"; the code revision introduced cross-examination and negotiation between the parties, although it preserved some elements of the continental legal tradition. =Switzerland= Carla Del Ponte Before 2011 Switzerland had four different models of inquiry: examining magistrate models I and II (') and public prosecutor models I and II ('). Different cantons of Switzerland used different models. Under \\"examining magistrate model I\\" an independent examining magistrate directed the police investigation directly, and the public prosecutor was only a party in the case. Under \\"examining magistrate model II\\" the examining magistrate and the public prosecutor jointly directed pre-trial proceedings; \\"the examining magistrate acted not independently, but was bound by the public prosecutor's instructions.\\" The \\"public prosecutor model I\\" followed the multiple-stage French system, in which (1) the public prosecution first directed the investigation by judicial police before transferring the matter to the independent examining magistrate; (2) the examining magistrate conducted examination independent of the prosecutor; and (3) at the end of the examining magistrate's inquiry, the case was returned to the public prosecutor, who made the ultimate decision on \\"whether to charge or discontinue the case.\\" Finally, under \\"public prosecutor model II\\" the examining magistrate was absent altogether and the public prosecutor being the \\"master of preliminary proceedings\\" responsible for conducting the investigation and examination, making the decision of whether or not to charge, and prosecuting the case. When the Swiss Code of Criminal Procedure came into effect in 2011, Switzerland adopted the latter model nationwide, abolished the position of examining magistrate that had previously existed in some cantons. One prominent Swiss investigative magistrate was Carla Del Ponte, who became prominent for her investigations into Sicilian Mafia crime in Switzerland. Del Ponte was later appointed public prosecutor and then federal attorney general of Switzerland, before becoming chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia and the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda. =Elsewhere= Poland historically had examining magistrates; Polish examining magistrate Jan Sehn investigated the Nazi atrocities at Auschwitz in preparation for the Auschwitz trials. However, in 1949, the Polish judiciary was restructured along Soviet lines, and the position of investigating magistrate was eliminated. West Germany abolished the examining magistrate at the end of 1974. Portugal abolished the examining magistrate in 1987.  In popular culture  The 1969 film Z stars an examining magistrate based on Christos Sartzetakis.

It is performed each year In March and October in Colquitt, the Miller County seat in south Georgia.  History  In 1990 Joy Jinks, a resident of Colquitt, met Richard Owen Geer by chance at a conference on community development in New York City. At that time Geer was a doctoral student in performance studies at Northwestern University. Jinks mentioned to Geer that her home community was in decline and that her and other members of Colquitt were considering making a play to celebrate the community's history. Geer explained to Jinks that his dissertation was research on how performance can be a community-building tool. He suggested that they work together to develop a play based on personal stories from the lives of Miller County residents. About half a year after this encounter, Geer came to Colquitt and met with the Colquitt/Miller Arts Council. The project was called \\"Swamp Gravy,\\" in honor of the soup made in southwest Georgia fishing camps comprising whatever vegetables are available, fried fish, a bit of fat, and whatever else might happen to be around. Story gatherers from the county were charged with the task of recording stories from black and white members of the community. Once the stories were gathered, they were transcribed and put together in a script by Tennessee playwright Jo Carson. Swamp Gravy Sketches was a musical first performed in the fall of 1992. It began as a one time event performed in the Miller County Elementary School auditorium to a sold out crowd. It received rave reviews and included an amateur cast of all local residents. During 1993 Swamp Gravy was performed over thirty times throughout Georgia. In 1994, the play earned a 1994 Cultural Olympiad Award in Atlanta. The play moved to a new location, an old cotton warehouse transformed to a performance space, the Cotton Hall, swamp Gravy Theater, in 1994. The hall has since become a state-of-the-art theater. In 1996 the play was performed in Atlanta at the Olympic Games, and then at the Kennedy Center in Washington, DC. Since then, it has grown into a seasonal run of thirty-two shows annually. A new show premieres each October with new stories from the town. Original music is added by local volunteers to complement the stories. As new stories are added, some old ones are replaced, and a new theme characterizes the new season's performances. In the early days the production stayed away from serious issues, but over the years difficult themes such as racism, spousal abuse and pedophilia have been broached. However the overall themes are still in celebration of life in rural America, such as work, religion, medicine, crime and punishment, local media, and marital and sibling relationships. The cast consists of over 100 volunteers. Many cast members have been with the project throughout its life. Swamp Gravy has become a national and international model for community theater. Delegates from Colquitt have traveled to nearly 15 states and several foreign nations in order to start other similar projects. The Arts-Council's flagstaff production, Swamp Gravy, has paved the way for other shows at Cotton Hall Theater including professional productions, variety shows, and youth theater shows.  Professional shows  December 3, 2003 saw the world premiere of Cotton Hall's first professional production, A Southern Christmas Carol with book, music and lyrics by Rob Lauer‚Äîwho also directed the production. A Southern Christmas Carol was staged with a cast of 10 professional actors, and received critical raves and was a box-office success. The theater staged it again in both 2004 and 2005. Due to the number of Holiday season tourists coming to Colquitt to see the show, sales at local shops and restaurants reached new highs for the months of November and December. During the three years that the show was produced at Cotton Hall, a number of professional actors were featured who have since had success on Broadway and in the music industry. Character actor Peter Lewis created the role of 'Old Man Scrooge' in 2003 and repeated it in 2004. Singer and actor Rubin Singleton created the role of 'Tiny' in 2003 and repeated it in 2004 before landing a recording contract and performing with Beyonc√© and Josh Groban. Karen Beyer, who also choreographed Swamp Gravy and Christmas Carol, created the role of 'Missionary Lady' before going on to appear as a regular in the Lifetime Channel's series Army Wives. Actress Marissa McGowen created the role of 'Fan' before going on to star in the Broadway revivals of \\"Les Miserables\\" and \\"A Little Night Music.\\" Andrew Frace played 'the Ghost of Christmas Past' in 2004 and went on to appear in the national tour of Disney's The Lion King and then star in the Las Vegas production of the Tony Awarding winning Best music of 2005, \\"Jersey Boys.\\" Michael Mahany played the role of 'the Ghost of Christmas Past' in 2005 and then went on appear in the original Off-Broadway production of \\"Spring Awakening\\" and as the male lead in Disney's High School On Stage, and in the film Sex In the City 2. Matt Gibson, who played Nephew Fred and Eb in the 2005 production, appeared with Patti LuPone in the Tony Award-winning 2008 Broadway revival of \\"Gypsy.\\" In the summer of 2004, Rob Lauer directed CMAC's second professional production Smoke on the Mountain The show featured Edmund Bagnell, who went on to star in the role of Toby opposite Judy Kaye in the first national tour of the 2005 Broadway revival of Sweeney Todd. In the summer of 2005, Rob Lauer wrote, designed and directed a new dramatization of Huckleberry Finn with music by Peter Lewis, and starring Edmung Bagnell. In 2006, after Rob Lauer's departure as Artistic Director, Richard Geer, of Community Performance Inc. went on to direct two more professional productions Gospel of the Rock and Swamp Gravy Songbook. These plays were penned by Jules Corriere. Gospel of the Rock told the story of the Anglin brothers- two of the only men ever thought to have escaped Alcatraz prison. Clarence and J.W. Anglin were good boys who just managed to find trouble. After escaping several smaller jails, and robbing an Alabama bank with a water gun, the brothers were sentenced to time in Alcatraz. Gospel of the Rock featured a cast of both locals and professional actors from Georgia and South Carolina. Three of the five cast members were Colquitt natives- one a state patrol man, one a farmer, and the other‚Äîa teacher. Swamp Gravy Songbook told a story of two families struggling to survive in a drought plagued area of farmland. The families, one black and one white, are forced to work together in order to live. This script was built around the catalog of songs written over the years from Swamp Gravy. The show featured mainly local actors. In place of Southern Christmas Carol, December 2006 saw the premiere of Cotton Hall Christmas, another show written by Corriere. Cotton Hall Christmas followed a format similar to Swamp Gravy, putting stories from the community together to make the play. May-Haw May- Haw , Colquitt's own variety show, showcases local musical talent as well as the humor of volunteer cast members. The production began in 2005 as a fundraiser for \\"Nuthin' But A Will,\\" the 11th mural to be painted in town as a part of CMAC's Millennium Mural Project, and has since become a staple of the Cotton Hall season. The show takes place in the studio of the WMHAW Radio Station, with hosts Floyd B. Loyd, Queezle Erskin, and Marvin Spitznargle. The motley trio grounds the show in a firm foundation of funny. They are assisted in their joke telling by a cast of volunteer comedians who are specially trained to tell the corniest jokes they know! Whereas Swamp Gravy generally boasts an audience of \\"out-of-towners,\\" May-Haw is more of a local favorite. As of 2010, May-Haw has continued to fund portions of the Millennium Mural Project, as well as contributing to the Youth Theater and other projects. May- Haw consistently plays to sold out crowds, and is one of the Arts-Council's most successful shows. May-Haw is now performed twice a year, in April and January. The April performances are scheduled to coincide with the National Mayhaw Festival. CMAC Youth The CMAC Youth Theater was begun in the summer of 2007. Its first production, Peter Pan, was directed by high school sophomore Will Murdock. The show boasted a cast of fifty volunteer actors ranging in age from five years old to adult. Since, the Youth Theater had produced Bridge to Terabithia, Willy Wonka, Christmastime at the Circus Marvello , and most recently Alice in Wonderland. Two-thousand and eight was a full year for the CMAC Youth Theater. Bridge to Terabithia was staged in the InterACT Building, a facility owned by the Arts-Council that was not in use at the time. Curtains, stages, chairs, and lighting were added to the empty building to create the temporary theater. The show opened in February, just prior to the Spring season of Swamp Gravy. Later that year, in June, Willy Wonka hit the stage. It was also directed by Murdock, with Susanne Reynolds and Preston Messer assisting. This show also boasted a large cast of more than fifty. December ushered in a third youth theater show for 2008. Christmastime at the Circus Marvello was written for Cotton Hall by Will Murdock. Marvello told the journey of seven runaway orphans as they try to put together a \\"traditional old fashioned Christmas.\\" Along the way they are antagonized by a brooding and lonely widow, the police, and an unusually aggressive turkey.

Ada means \\"first daughter\\" in NdiAniche-Uno in Arondizuogu, a clan among others of the Igbo People. Its equivalent for \\"first son\\" in the same clan is Tahitii and Okpara across all Igbo ethnic group in Nigeria. The Igbo people are one of the largest ethnic groups in Africa. Ada means \\"island\\" in Turkish, and it was the 10th most popular girls' name in Turkey in 2016. Finally, the name occurs in Greek mythology and was in use in Ancient Greece. The name has seen a slight increase in popularity in the United States in recent years, where it was the 646th most common name given to baby girls born there in 2007. It had been among the top 100 names for girls in the United States between 1880 and 1912 and remained in the top 1,000 names for girls until 1985. It first reappeared among the top 1,000 names for girls in 2004, after a 19-year absence. Finnish variant Aada was among the top ten most popular names given to newborn girls in Finland in 2013. The name is also commonly used in Norway, where it was the 66th most popular name for girls born in 2007. Its increase in popularity has been attributed to the popularity of other \\"simple, old-fashioned names beginning with a vowel\\" such as Ava and Ella Some of its popularity might also be attributed to Ada, Countess of Lovelace, the daughter of George Gordon, Lord Byron, who has been called the first computer programmer by some historians. Ada, a computer programing language, was named in her honor. St. Ada was also the name of an early saint and of several medieval queens and princesses.

Within the field of social evolution, Hamiltonian spite is a term for behaviours occurring among conspecifics that have a cost for the actor and a negative impact upon the recipient. Theories on altruism and spitefulness W. D. Hamilton published an influential paper on altruism in 1964 to explain why genetic kin tend to help each other.Hamilton WD 1964. The genetical evolution of social behaviour. Part I and II. Journal of Theoretical Biology 7: 1‚Äì16 and 17‚Äì52. He argued that genetically related individuals are likely to carry the copies of the same alleles; thus, helping kin may ensure that copies of the actors' alleles pass onto next generations of both the recipient and the actor. While this became a widely accepted idea, it was less noted that Hamilton published a later paper that modified this view.Hamilton WD 1970. Selfish and spiteful behaviour in an evolutionary model. Nature 228: 1218‚Äì20. This paper argues that by measuring the genetic relatedness between any two (randomly chosen) individuals of a population several times, we can identify an average level of relatedness. Theoretical models predict that (1) it is adaptive for an individual to be altruistic to any other individuals that are more closely related to it than this average level, and also that (2) it is adaptive for an individual to be spiteful against any other individuals that are less closely related to it than this average level. The indirect adaptive benefits of such acts can surpass certain costs of the act (either helpful or harmful) itself. Hamilton mentioned birds and fishes exhibiting infanticide (more specifically: ovicide) as examples for such behaviours. Briefly, an individual can increase the chance of its genetic alleles to be passed to the next generations either by helping those that are more closely related, or by harming those that are less closely related than relationship by chance.Vickery WL, Brown JS, FitzGerald GJ 2003. Spite: altruism‚Äôs evil twin. Oikos, 102, 413‚Äì16.Foster KR, Wenseleers T, Ratnieks FLW 2001. Spite: Hamilton‚Äôs unproven theory. Annales Zoologici Fennici 38: 229‚Äì38. Doubts about the adaptive nature of spiteful behaviour Though altruism and spitefulness appear to be two sides of the same coin, the latter is less accepted among evolutionary biologists. First, unlike the case with the beneficiary of an altruistic act, targets of aggression are likely to act in revenge: bites will provoke bites. Thus harming non-kin may be more costly than helping kins. Second, presuming a panmictic population, the vast majority of pairs of individuals exhibit a roughly average level of relatedness. For a given individual, the majority of others are not worth helping or harming. While it is easy to identify the few most closely related ones (see: kin recognition), it is hard to identify the most genetically distant ones. Most terrestrial vertebrates exhibit a certain degree of site fidelity, so levels of kinship tend to correlate negatively with spatial distance. While this may provide some cues to identify the least related individuals, it may also ensure that non-kin rarely if ever meet each other. Spiteful behaviour in animals Infanticide Many animal species exhibit infanticide, i.e. adults tend to kill the eggs or the offspring of conspecifics, even if they do not feed on them (in the absence of cannibalism).van Schaik CP, Janson CH (eds.) 2000. Infanticide by males and its implications. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge Univ Press. This form of spitefulness is relatively free from the threat of revenge ‚Äì provided that the parents and relatives of the target are either weak or far away. Infanticide may not be a form of spite as in many cases the loss of offspring to the female brings it back into estrous providing a mating advantage to an infanticidal male. This is seen in lions. Van Schaik, C. P., & Janson, C. H. (Eds.). (2000). Infanticide by males and its implications. Cambridge University Press. When infected by tuberculosis, badgers emigrate from their natal group. Aggression by means of pathogens An individual carrying a long-lasting infection of virulent pathogens may benefit from (1) channelling the flow of pathogens from its own body away from its kin and (2) directing them toward non-kin conspecifics. The adaptive nature of this behaviour has been supported by the analysis of theoretical models R√≥zsa L 1999. Influencing random transmission is a neutral character in hosts. Journal of Parasitology, 85, 1032‚Äì35.Dionisio F 2007. Selfish and spiteful behaviour through parasites and pathogens. Evolutionary Ecology Research, 9: 1199-1210 and also by the analyses of the behavioural repertoire of different animal species.R√≥zsa L 2000. Spite, xenophobia, and collaboration between hosts and parasites. Oikos 91: 396‚Äì400. Thus, tuberculosis-infected European badgers and rabies-infected dogs equally tend to emigrate from their natal ranges before starting to distribute the pathogens. Similarly, wild herds of Asian elephants tend to defecate into drinkwater holes apparently to keep rival herds away.Jog M, Watve M 2005. Role of parasites and commensals in shaping host behaviour. Current Science 89: 1184‚Äì91 Herod's alleged infanticide from a church in L√ºen. Spiteful behaviour in humans Wartime infanticide Throughout human history, war often emerges as a costly form of aggression typically targeting the non-kin enemy. Naturally, most wars appear to be motivated by potential benefits other than the genetic. Nevertheless, the widespread occurrence of rape and infanticide during periods of war indicates Hamiltonian elements as well. Infanticide is a biologically spiteful action in that it costs the killer time and energy, and opens the killer to the threat of revenge, without any direct compensating benefits. Rape, by contrast, is not, in the strict definition of the word, biologically spiteful as it is likely to have a direct fitness increase on the rapist (by increasing his number of direct descendants in the next generation, should the victim fall pregnant). Economy It was recently suggested that spiteful motivations may also play a role in economic decisions.Boari M 2007. The ethics of rationality.

DƒÖmbski participated actively in Poland's political life. In the 1674 royal elections, DƒÖmbski was leader of the anti-French faction, throwing his support behind hetman Jan Sobieski, who ascended the throne as Jan III (died in 1696). DƒÖmbski played a key role in the subsequent royal election, which has been described as \\"one of the most dismal episodes in Polish parliamentary history.\\"Adam Zamoyski, The Polish Way (New York: Hippocrene Books, 1990), p. 207. Initially DƒÖmbski backed the late king's son, Jakub Sobieski, however, Sobieski was in Silesia at the time of his father's death, and was immediately seized by Saxon troops. DƒÖmbski then joined supporters of the Russian-backed candidate, Friedrich August, Elector of Saxony. Despite enormous bribes paid by the Elector and his backers, the Elector's Protestantism aroused suspicions among the Polish nobility. Although the Elector promised to convert to Roman Catholicism, on 27 June 1697, the Polish nobility elected the French candidate, the Prince de Conti, and the Primate proclaimed Conti king.Norman Davies, God's Playground: A History of Poland, vol. I (New York: Columbia University Press, p. 492 Nevertheless, that same evening a group of dissenters, led by DƒÖmbski held a second vote, in the absence of the Primate, who had not returned to the election field. DƒÖmbski therefore proclaimed the Elector King of Poland.Mariusz TrƒÖba / Lech Bielski, W≈Çadcy i Krolowie Polski (Warsaw: Reader's Digest, 2005), p. 526 The Elector arrived in short order and on September 15, DƒÖmbski crowned the Elector king August II of Poland in Wawel Cathedral. It was the first time that a deceased monarch's son had not been elected to succeed him, that the rightful candidate had been disbarred from the throne by military force, and that the Poles had acquired a German king, which went against a long tradition of keeping German hegemony at arm's length.\\"Adam Zamoyski, The Polish Way (New York: Hippocrene Books, 1990), p. 207 A grateful King August II nominated DƒÖmbski bishop of Krakow on 30 March 1700.

Like the Idehan Ubari further north, the Idehan Murzuq is part of the greater Sahara Desert region. It is separated from the southern Sahara Desert by the Tibesti Mountains and the Tassili n'Ajjer. Dune pattern The ‚ÄúDraa‚Äù dunes (from the Arabic for ‚Äúarm‚Äù) are very large masses of sand in the western part of Libya's vast Murzuq Desert, and they appear in satellite images as a broad network of yellow-orange sand masses, with smooth-floored, almost sand-free basins between them. Geologists think that the draa of the Marzuq were probably formed by winds different from the prevailing north- northeast winds of today. Numerous smaller dunes have developed on the backs of the draa. Three distinct dune types are visible in satellite images of the region: *Longitudinal dunes, more or less parallel with the north winds. *Transverse dunes, usually more curved and formed at right angles to the wind. *Star dunes, in which several linear arms converge towards a single peak. The upwind sides of the sand masses appear smoother than the downwind side. Wind is moving sand grains almost all the time. This means that the draa and the dunes are all moving as sand is added on the upwind side and blown off the downwind side. Small sand masses move much faster than large sand masses. The draa are almost stationary, but the smaller dunes move relatively quickly across their backs. When the smaller dunes reach the downwind side of the draa, they are obliterated; their sand is blown across the basins as individual grains. Sand Dunes, Marzuq Sand Sea, Southwest Libya.

Army of Zero is both a card game and an armchair treasure hunt, similar in concept to Masquerade and The Key To The Kingdom. A cash prize was on offer to the person who could provide the best solution to the puzzle. Army of Zero was launched at Toy Fair 2009, held at ExCeL London in January 2009. The game includes two six-sided dice and a deck of ninety-nine cards. The cards are made up of eighty-four character cards, eight attack/defend cards, six cards defining the rules and one card which acts as an entry form into the puzzle competition. Card game The cards can be used to play a two-player game. Each player receives ten character cards, dealt at random. In each round, both players put forward one of their characters, and these two characters battle each other. In each round of combat, each player can choose to attack or defend, but no character can attack for more than two rounds in a row. Players can gain an advantage by successfully predicting whether their opponent will attack or defend. The outcome of each round is determined by the rolling of six-sided dice and adding the appropriate character statistics. Each character card has four statistics: speed, combat, weapon and armour. Each of these is an integer number, and each can range between -2 and +2. The statistics used to resolve combat depend on whether each player chose to attack or defend. When a character is defeated, he or she is out of the game. When all ten of a player's characters are defeated, the other player is the winner. Characters and puzzle Army of Zero has eighty-four character cards, depicting a series of odd fantasy characters. Each character is depicted as belonging to a particular \\"clan\\", each clan being named after an animal. The character designs are representative of the clans, so for example, the members of the Bat clan are all vampiric in appearance. Each character also has a name and a rank, or title. Each character's name is unique, but there are only five ranks; \\"Thegn\\", \\"Guardian\\", \\"Commander\\", \\"General\\" and \\"Lord\\". The design of the eighty-four character cards includes a series of interconnected puzzles. The objective is to work out what the objective of the puzzle is, to solve it, and to submit the answer to Point Zero Games. A prize of ¬£1,000 was on offer to the person providing the best solution by the closing date of April 30, 2010. The puzzle was solved by Tim Pickup. The objective was to discover the identity of an implied missing character, General Voleda of the Crocodile Clan. Solving the puzzle required all eighty-four character cards, and part of the solution was related to arranging the cards in a particular configuration.

As a workers co-op, it is controlled democratically by its member/owners, who run the business with a flat management structure and with an equal rate of pay. Ethics form the foundations of the business, and Unicorn's Principles of Purpose are the framework within which the business operates. Unicorn is closely connected to local sister company Glebelands City Growers in Sale and owns of peri-urban growing land at Glazebury, Cheshire. It sells fresh, dried and processed food and drink, much of it organic and with a focus on local and Fairtrade sourcing, as well as household, bodycare and general grocery items. Keeping prices in line with the supermarkets, Unicorn is one of the largest independent wholefood groceries in the UK and has an annual turnover of around ¬£7 million. In 2017 it won the BBC Food & Farming Awards 'Best Food Retailer'https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p05gz1qq/p05gyzwy. During 2008 it won two national awards, named BBC Radio's 'Best Local Food Retailer'http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/factual/foodawards2008.shtml and The Observer Food Monthly's 'Best Independent Retailer'  Business model and structure  Unicorn is based on a modelSawtell, R. 'Blueprint for 50 Co-ops'. Available at http://www.unicorn-grocery.co.uk/pdfs/Blueprint%20for%2050%20Co- ops%20(2006).pdf devised by Roger Sawtell, former chair of the Industrial Common Ownership Movement (ICOM), a co-operative federation that now forms part of Co-operatives UK.'Industrial Common Ownership Movement (ICOM)' http://www.cooperatives-uk.coop/live/cme2021.htm Roger has written at length on co-operative structure and employee participation and his model was first put into practice at Daily Bread Co-operative, a workers co-op in Northampton (now with a sister branch in Cambridge) . The idea to set up a similar company in Manchester came about in 1994, based on the experiences of Adam York, who had worked in the Northampton shop. The model revolves around direct, often bulk purchasing (directly from manufacturers where possible rather than distributors), on-site processing to add value, and competitive margins and pricing, matching supermarket prices.Food Prices Comparison http://www.eggbutnobacon.co.uk/2008/11/food-price-calculator/ Unicorn is based on the core principles of co-operative organisation,'Statement on the Co operative identity' in that is that the business is owned and democratically run by its employees, (the membership of the co-op), and they are the people who receive profits or other benefits generated by the business. There are no outside shareholders, executives or owners. The co-op is almost completely 'fully mutual', i.e. all staff are members of the co-operative. The exception being that between 5 and 10% of hours needed can be performed by 'casual' staff. Experiments with a third level of non-member 'shop assistants' proved unsuitable for the co-op.  Unicorn today  Unicorn Grocery The business occupies a site (including large storage and office space), has a turnover of around ¬£7 million, and employs around 65 co-op members plus casual staff. It sells unpackaged organic fruit and vegetables, basic dried ingredients, prepared foods, chilled and delicatessen goods, organic bread and alcohol and environmentally friendly body and household products. All are sourced with the shop's principles in mind, with a focus on local, organic and fair- trade.http://www.unicorn-grocery.co.uk/generalgrocery.php As well as groceries, the shop provides a kids play area, information about the products and what to do with them, and a 'Green Roof'.'How we did it ... Grocery roof becomes biodiversity showcase' http://www.planningresource.co.uk/resources/HowWeDidIt/772085/Grocery- roofbecomes-biodiversity-showcase/ In 2007 Unicorn members became land owners, purchasing of growing land from the shop in Glazebury, Cheshire, once again using loanstock to finance the purchase.'Unicorn's new way to secure affordable local produce' 'In the Spotlight' http://www.cooperatives- uk.coop/live/cme2522.htm Designed to improve and secure the shops's regional fresh supply, the land will be used to grow vegetables organically, for sale in the shop, cutting food miles significantly.  History  From an original working group of two people, the shop opened on 21 September 1996 with a working group of four members plus volunteers. Financial support and advice came from sources including the Industrial Common Ownership Finance Ltd (ICOF)ICOF http://www.icof.co.uk/ Co-op Finance Team, a Triodos Bank loan and loanstock (a form of fixed term bond raised from supporters and potential customers). Turnover began at ¬£4000 per year and reached ¬£4 million by 2007.Unicorn Annual Accounts 2007 This was matched by growth in staff, reaching 51 by 2007.

Growth has necessitated organisational changes within the co-op, the most significant being the creation of a 'representative structure', a departure from all members attending the fortnightly members decision-making meetings. After the group swelled beyond 15 people, members divided into teams, and individual co-op members are now represented by 'team overviews' at fortnightly 'forum' meetings.  Principles  Unicorn operate within a set of guidelines, known as its 'Statement of Purpose':Principles of Purpose http://www.unicorn- grocery.co.uk/principles.php *Secure Employment. The company aims to provide secure employment for its members. *Equal Opportunity. The company aims to reserve some employment for members with a learning disability. *Wholesome Healthy Consumption.

The northeast includes the western half of Hellas basin. The southeastern region contains Peneus Patera and part of the Amphitrites volcano. The Noachis quadrangle is one of a series of 30 quadrangle maps of Mars used by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) Astrogeology Research Program. The Noachis quadrangle is also referred to as MC-27 (Mars Chart-27).Davies, M.E.; Batson, R.M.; Wu, S.S.C. \\"Geodesy and Cartography\\" in Kieffer, H.H.; Jakosky, B.M.; Snyder, C.W.; Matthews, M.S., Eds. Mars. University of Arizona Press: Tucson, 1992. The Noachis quadrangle covers the area from 300¬∞ to 360¬∞ west longitude and 30¬∞ to 65¬∞ south latitude on Mars. It lies between the two giant impact basins on Mars: Argyre and Hellas. The Noachis quadrangle includes Noachis Terra and the western part of Hellas Planitia. Noachis is so densely covered with impact craters that it is considered among the oldest landforms on Mars‚Äîhence the term \\"Noachian\\" for one of the earliest time periods in martian history. In addition, many previously buried craters are now coming to the surface, where Noachis' extreme age has allowed ancient craters to be filled, and once again newly exposed. Much of the surface in Noachis quadrangle shows a scalloped topography where the disappearance of ground ice has left depressions. The first piece of human technology to land on Mars landed (crashed) in the Noachis quadrangle. The Soviet's Mars 2 crashed at . It weighed about one ton. The automated craft attempted to land in a giant dust storm. To make conditions even worse, this area also has many dust devils.Hartmann, W. 2003. A Traveler's Guide to Mars. Workman Publishing. NY, NY. Scalloped topography Scalloped Terrain at Peneus Patera, as seen by HiRISE. Scalloped terrain is quite common in some areas of Mars. Certain regions of Mars display scalloped-shaped depressions. The depressions are believed to be the remains of an ice-rich mantle deposit. Scallops are created when ice sublimates from frozen soil.McEwen, A., et al. 2017. Mars The Pristine Beauty of the Red Planet. University of Arizona Press. Tucson. This mantle material probably fell from the air as ice formed on dust when the climate was different due to changes in the tilt of the Mars pole. The scallops are typically tens of meters deep and from a few hundred to a few thousand meters across. They can be almost circular or elongated. Some appear to have coalesced, thereby causing a large heavily pitted terrain to form. A study published in Icarus, found that the landforms of scalloped topography can be made by the subsurface loss of water ice by sublimation under current Martian climate conditions. Their model predicts similar shapes when the ground has large amounts of pure ice, up to many tens of meters in depth. The process of producing the terrain may begin with sublimation from a crack because there are often polygon cracks where scallops form.

ESP 050728 1210scalloped.jpgScalloped topography, as seen by HiRISE under HiWish program  Dust Devil Tracks  Many areas on Mars experience the passage of giant dust devils. A thin coating of fine bright dust covers most of the Martian surface. When a dust devil goes by it blows away the coating and exposes the underlying dark surface creating tracks. Dust devils have been seen from the ground and from orbit. They have even blown the dust off of the solar panels of the two Rovers on Mars, thereby greatly extending their lives. The twin Rovers were designed to last for 3 months, instead they have lasted more than six years and are still going after over 8 years. The pattern of the tracks have been shown to change every few months. TA study that combined data from the High Resolution Stereo Camera (HRSC) and the Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) found that some large dust devils on Mars have a diameter of 700 meters and last at least 26 minutes. The image below of Russel Crater shows changes in dust devil tracks over a period of only three months, as documented by HiRISE. Other Dust Devil Tracks are visible in the picture of Frento Vallis.

Craters Impact craters generally have a rim with ejecta around them, in contrast volcanic craters usually do not have a rim or ejecta deposits. As craters get larger (greater than 10 km in diameter) they usually have a central peak. The peak is caused by a rebound of the crater floor following the impact. Sometimes craters will display layers. Craters can show us what lies deep under the surface. Image:Maunder Crater.JPGMaunder Crater, as seen by HiRISE.

Many ideas have been advanced to explain them. Formation by running water when the climate was different is a popular idea.

A study published in Planetary and Space Science found that this terrain was the youngest deposit of the interior of Hellas. They also suggest in the paper that banded terrain may have covered a larger area of the NW interior of Hellas. The bands can be classified as linear, concentric, or lobate. Bands are typically 3‚Äì15 km long, 3 km wide. Narrow inter-band depressions are 65 m wide and 10 m deep. Pictures of these features can look like abstract art.

In a career which lasted from June 1908 to April 1910 he ran thirteen times and won seven races. After showing moderate form as a two-year-old he improved to become one of the best colts in England in the early part of 1909. He won his first five races including the 2000 Guineas and The Derby. His win at Epsom Downs Racecourse made his owner King Edward VII the first reigning British monarch to win a Derby and was greeted with unprecedented celebration. Minoru's bid to win the British Triple Crown ended when he was beaten by Bayardo in the St Leger. He was retired to stud in 1910 and was soon afterwards exported to Russia, where he disappeared during the Revolution in 1917. A then popular game of chance, which simulates a horse race in miniature, had been named after Minoru. Background Minoru was a bay horse bred by Colonel William Hall-Walker (later Lord Wavertree) at his stud farm at Tully in County Kildare which today is the Irish National Stud. Minoru was a son of Cyllene, winner of the 1899 Ascot Gold Cup who sired three other Epsom Derby winners, but was exported to Argentina in January 1908, before his true quality as a stallion became evident. His dam was Mother Siegel, a daughter of the highly regarded multiple stakes winner, Friar's Balsam. The colt was leased by his breeder to King Edward VII along with five other yearlings. Minoru was trained by Richard Marsh at his Egerton House stable at Newmarket, Suffolk: Marsh was the established \\"Royal\\" trainer, having prepared both Persimmon and Diamond Jubilee to win the Derby for Edward when he was Prince of Wales. Racing career 1908: two-year-old season Minoru began his racing career impressively, by winning the five furlong Great Surrey Foal Stakes at Epsom, on 5 June, the day that Signorinetta won The Oaks. His subsequent performances in 1908 were disappointing. He finished second to Louviers when strongly fancied for the Coventry Stakes at Royal Ascot in June and was second again to Battleaxe in the July Stakes at Newmarket. After a break, Minoru returned to Newmarket in autumn for two further races. He finished third in the Hopeful Stakes, and third again in the New Nursery, a handicap race for two-year-olds. In the Free Handicap, an end-of-season ranking of the best two-year-olds Bayardo was ranked top with 126 pounds, while Minoru was unrated, meaning that he was at least twenty-two pounds behind the leader. At the end of the year he was considered \\"useful\\", but not top class. Marsh, however, thought highly of the colt: when asked to assess the six horses leased by the King from Colonel Hall-Walker, he commented, \\"I like Minoru best. He is a bit on the leg, but a fine and resolute goer.\\" 1909: three-year-old season =Spring= During the winter of 1908-1909, Minoru made exceptional progress, and although the King's racing manager, Marcus Beresford, was initially sceptical, Marsh decided to train the colt for the Classics. The cold weather early in the year delayed the preparation of many horses, including Bayardo, but the lightly- made Minoru took little work to reach peak fitness, giving him an advantage over most of his rivals. After performing impressively in a private trial race, Minoru made his debut in the Greenham Stakes at Newbury on 31 March and won from Valens under top weight of 136 pounds. In the 2000 Guineas at Newmarket on 28 April he started at odds of 4/1 against ten opponents and was regarded as the chief danger to the favourite Bayardo. Ridden by Herbert Jones he raced prominently before accelerating through a narrowing gap in the closing stages and won easily from Phaleron and Louviers, with Bayardo fourth, in a race record time of 1:37.8. According to press reports the victory was greeted with \\"intense enthusiasm\\". Minoru was given very little work by Marsh before his next run in the Derby. =Summer= Alfred Charles Havell At Epsom on 26 May, Minoru started at odds of 7/2 in a field of fifteen, with Bayardo and the American-bred Sir Martin, who started favourite, being seen as his main rivals. The crowd was smaller than usual on account of heavy rain on the morning of the race, but the King and Queen were in attendance. Minoru broke slowly on the inside but recovered quickly and by the beginning of the turn into the straight was in fourth place behind Louviers, Brooklands and Sir Martin, and just ahead of William the Fourth. At this point the race changed completely as Sir Martin, who had been traveling extremely well, stumbled in close quarters and lost his rider, badly interfering with William the Fourth. In the straight the race developed into a match between Minoru and Louviers who raced together throughout the last two furlongs, with first one and then the other appearing to have the advantage. The two colts crossed the line together, just ahead of William the Fourth who finished very strongly after recovering from the earlier incident, and looked an unlucky loser. After a long delay, the judge announced Minoru as the winner by a short head from Louviers, many of whose supporters were convinced that he had won. Valens finished fourth and Bayardo fifth. The victory for the \\"Royal\\" colt provoked \\"the wildest scenes of enthusiasm ever known in England\\", including a mass rendition of the National Anthem as the King led his horse to the winner's enclosure. Minoru himself was \\"swallowed up\\" by a crowd of supporters, several of whom attempted to obtain souvenirs by pulling hairs from his mane and tail, while his owner was informally congratulated with cries of \\"Good for you old sport!\\" and \\"Well done Teddy!\\". Minoru's victory was the first in the Derby for a reigning British monarch. The King received many congratulatory telegrams, his favourite reportedly being one which arrived from Argentina and read: \\"Minoru, England. Congratulations from your father- Cyllene.\\" Minoru followed up his win at Epsom by running in the St. James's Palace Stakes over one mile at Royal Ascot, in which he started at odds of 1/3 and won from The Story and Blankney II. Minoru was then sent to Goodwood on 29 July for the Sussex Stakes, another one mile race which at that time was restricted to three-year-olds. Minoru carried 134 pounds and won very easily from his two opponents, Prester Jack and Verney. =Autumn= On 8 September Minoru attempted to complete the British Triple Crown in the St Leger at Doncaster. Bayardo had meanwhile won four successive races including an easy win over Louviers at Sandown. Minoru started second favourite and finished fourth of the seven runners, six lengths behind Bayardo, who won from Valens and Mirador. Minoru had little luck in running, being unable to obtain a clear run along the rails, but appeared to have been well beaten on merit. Herbert Jones offered no excuses, and admitted that in view of Bayardo's superiority, Minoru had been \\"a lucky animal\\" to win the 2000 Guineas and Derby. On his final start of the season, he was sent to Newmarket in October for the Free Handicap, in which he defeated the filly Electra, the winner of the 1000 Guineas and Epsom Oaks, by a neck. As Jones had been injured the previous day, Minoru was ridden on this occasion by Danny Maher, who was presented by the King with a jewelled scarf-pin in recognition of his success. Minoru's performances in 1909 was the key factor in his sire Cyllene being the 1909 Leading sire in Great Britain & Ireland. His prize money of ¬£15,246 placed him second to Bayardo on the list of leading British money-winners. 1910: four- year-old season Minoru was kept in training as a four-year-old with the Ascot Gold Cup as his principal target, but began to develop problems with his eyes. He made his debut in the City and Suburban Handicap at Epsom on 26 April and started 3/1 favourite, but finished seventh of the fourteen runners behind Bachelor's Double. Shortly after Minoru's disappointing run at Epsom the King died and the ownership of the colt was returned to Colonel Hall-Walker. The King's death resulted in the cancellation of all sporting events, including a meeting at Kempton Park Racecourse, where Minoru had been entered in the Jubilee Stakes. The decision was made not to persevere with the horse and he was retired to stud. Assessment When a new racecourse was opened on Lulu Island, Richmond, British Columbia in 1909 it was named \\"Minoru Park\\" in honour of the Derby winner. The track was later renamed Brighouse Park and closed in 1941, although the name lives on in playing fields and an ice rink on the site under the name of \\"Minoru Park\\". In their book A Century of Champions, Tony Morris and John Randall rated Minoru an average winner of the 2000 Guineas and an inferior winner of the Derby. Stud record Minoru stood as a stallion at Hall-Walker's Tully Stud in County Kildare, Ireland at an initial fee of 98 guineas., Minoru produced the excellent broodmare Serenissima before being sold in 1913 to a breeding operation in Russia. Serenissima's foals included: * Selene (b. 1919) - outstanding broodmare, dam of Britain's Hyperion, and stallions Sickle and Pharamond II who were successful sires in the United States * Tranquil (b. 1920) - won the 1,000 Guineas Stakes and St. Leger Stakes * Bosworth (b. 1926) - winner of the Ascot Gold Cup Minoru disappeared during the turmoil of the 1917 Russian Revolution along with his racecourse rival Louviers and the 1913 Derby winner Aboyeur. Although there was speculation that he survived after being smuggled to Serbia, no trace of him was ever actually found. Pedigree *Minoru was inbred 3x4 to Hermit, meaning that the stallion appears in both the third and fourth generations of his pedigree.

FMAP's mission was to describe and synthesize globally changing patterns of species abundance, distribution, and diversity, and to model the effects of fishing, climate change and other key variables on those patterns. This work was done across ocean realms and with an emphasis on understanding past changes and predicting future scenarios. History FMAP emerged from a workshop held at Dalhousie University in 2002 and was funded from 2003 to 2010 by the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation. The project was led by Ransom A. Myers from 2002 to 2007 and from 2007 to 2010 was under the direction of Boris Worm, Heike Lotze and Ian Jonsen in the Biology Department at Dalhousie University. Core research topics * Marine animals: Spatial distribution and movement of marine animal. FMAP team members analyzed electronic tracking data for large marine animals in combination with environmental data to better understand how environmental change may influence the movement of animals and consequently patterns in their distribution. In addition to gaining mechanistic knowledge of movement behaviours and patterns, maps were created of species' seasonal distributions, inferred from the tracking data. * Marine biodiversity: Global patterns on marine biodiversity. FMAP researchers overlaid spatial diversity patterns for different species groups, searching for local hotspots and coldspots, regional overlap between different groups and global spatial gradients in marine diversity. Overlaying standardized species richness patterns for diverse animal groups enabled description of taxon-specific and cross-taxa patterns as well as driving factors. The work of FMAP also aimed to understand the underlying processes and causes of such patterns and the factors that may deter them. * Marine ecosystems: Long term changes in marine ecosystems. FMAP team members compiled data on historical changes in the abundance, distribution and diversity of marine species and analyzed them in combination with environmental and anthropogenic factors, in order to help determine the causes of long-term changes in marine biodiversity. The goal was to synthesize long-term trends and large-scale changes in marine animal populations and ecosystems to add a temporal dimension to spatial patterns and short-term dynamics in marine populations and diversity. Analyses of the underlying drivers and consequences of these changes were also explored in order to evaluate current and potential future trends in marine biodiversity. Contributions The FMAP project coordinated major data synthesis efforts to derive global trends and patterns in marine biodiversity. From 2003 to 2011, FMAP team members have contributed over 110 scientific articles to peer review journals, including numerous publications in top-tier journals such as Science and Nature. Publications by FMAP scientists have also included many book chapters, policy publications and outreach articles. Topics of research have included patterns of species abundance, distribution and diversity, and the effects of climate change, overfishing and other key human threats on these patterns. FMAP has performed analyses on a variety of organisms, including coral reefs, large pelagic fish, marine mammals, sea turtles and invertebrates. A major output of the project was the development of advanced statistical tools for analyzing observational data to study how marine biodiversity is distributed and changing over time, and to better understand the movements and distribution of marine predators. FMAP's research was presented as part of the culmination of The Census of Marine Life, which was celebrated in October 2010 in London, England. FMAP research formed an integral part of the overall findings of the program, which were disseminated through major media outlets around the globe. Scientific highlights * New discovered method estimates that Earth is home to 8.7 million species, of which 2.1 million live in the ocean. * Reported severe depletion of large marine animals over the past 50 to 500 years. An up to 90% reduction in the abundance of large, commercially exploited marine megafauna has occurred since human impacts began, along with a reduction of total animal biomass and the local extinction of particular species. * Identified ecosystem consequences of losing marine biodiversity: changes in abundance and diversity have negatively impacted ecosystem productivity and resilience, and compromised water quality, fishery yields and other ecosystem services. Conservation and management efforts over the last century have halted or even reversed the decline of biodiversity in some areas. Yet in areas where there are few management initiatives in place, the abundance and diversity of marine animal populations continues to decline, mostly in direct relation to multiple human impacts. * Discovered global patterns of biodiversity for tuna and billfish, sharks, and marine mammals, which are different from those generalized for terrestrial environments. * Used the entire Census database to identify global hotspots of marine biodiversity across 13 major taxa, and identified water temperature as the main environmental predictor of biodiversity patterns in the ocean. Sea surface temperature was found to be the primary oceanographic driver of marine animal distribution and diversity at global scales. * Reported a slow, global decline in plankton abundance since the beginning of oceanographic measurements in the late 19th century that appeared to be linked to gradual ocean warming and increased stratification of the water column. * Examined how marine biodiversity might change over the next 50 years. The future of marine animal populations is likely determined in large part by two key variables: the rate of ocean warming, and the rate of exploitation. Where those rates are low, it will increase the chance for adaptation and recovery. Where they continue to rise, the loss of marine biodiversity and associated services will be severe. * Developed new methods to better understand the dynamic movement and habitat use of marine animals. Results indicate that spatial patterns of animal behaviours are markedly discrete and predictable both seasonally and inter-annually, implying strong connections to environmental drivers and prey distribution.

He directed 15 films during his career. His 1982 film Pra Frente, Brasil was entered into the 33rd Berlin International Film Festival. Farias' brother Reginaldo Faria (the 's' was added to his surname due to an error at the registry) is also a film director and actor.Artigo Roberto Farias um artes√£o engajado - Jornal O Globo (May 14, 2018) Biography Brother of the actor Reginaldo Faria, had an \\"s\\" added to his surname by error of the notary. His mother took him as a baby when he went to the movies. Between one bottle and another, it was his first contact with what was happening on the screen. At the age of 8 he was making a \\"movie\\" at his house using shoe boxes. From cinema to photography was an easy jump and he came from Nova Friburgo to study Fine Arts in Rio de Janeiro or to do Architecture, but his destiny and preference was always the movies. Throughout his career, Roberto was an assistant, editor, screenwriter, producer and distributor, but he was never an actor. The beginning was in Atl√¢ntida Cinematogr√°fica where he was taken by Watson Macedo to be assistant of direction. The debut was in the drama Maior que o √ìdio, directed by Jose Carlos Burle. He made almost ten films as a director or production assistant until he made his debut as a director in 1957 with \\"Rico Ri √† Toa\\", a starring Z√© Trindade in who besides directing, also was the author of the script and the dialogues. In 1960, with Cidade Amea√ßada, he won several awards and became one of the most respected filmmakers in Brazil, a position he would consolidate with Assalto ao Trem Pagador, in 1962. In the 1960s he founded the R.F.Farias production company, one of the most important in the country. He became a popular director when filming the film trilogy with Roberto Carlos, which began in 1968 with \\"Roberto Carlos em Ritmo de Aventura\\" and ended in 1971 with \\"Roberto Carlos a 300 Quil√¥metros por Hora\\". Roberto was also president of the Sindicato Nacional da Ind√∫stria Cinematogr√°fica and the first filmmaker to direct Embrafilme. In TV Globo made, in 1965, C√¢mara Indiscreta; later directed the miniseries A M√°fia no Brasil, As Noivas de Copacabana, Contos de Ver√£o and Maria Moura Memorial; besides the programs \\"Voc√™ Decide\\", Brava Gente (1996), Sob Nova Dire√ß√£o and Fa√ßa a Sua Hist√≥ria.

History The station served the centre of the town, and was on the branch line between and Oldcastle, which was opened by the Dublin and Drogheda Railway in 1850 and became part of the Great Northern Railway in 1876. The station was one of two serving the town, the other being , which served as the main station and was on two separate routes. Navan station was much smaller, with a single bi-directional platform serving the single track. Navan station, along with the branch line, was closed in 1958 to passenger services. However, the station remains relatively intact, with several freight trains per day still serving the station to and from the Tara Mine.Navan station - eiretrains.com Proposals In 2007 the campaign group Rail Users Ireland called for the restoration of passenger services on the Oldcastle line - as a commuter service between Navan and Dublin. This was because the planned passenger Dublin-Navan railway line from Clonsilla, which is expected to use the Midland Great Western Railway alignment, will not reach Navan until undetermined future time. Rail Users Ireland's proposal was for Navan station to be reopened and two new stations (Navan East and Duleek) to be built, allowing a commuter service of 65 minutes into Dublin.Navan - Drogheda - Dublin, Navan Already Has a Rail Line to Dublin - Rail Users Ireland Rail replacement bus A rail replacement bus was introduced in 1958 and this route continues to this day as Bus √âireann route 188 (Navan-Slane- Duleek-Drogheda with a latter extension to Trim).

The Mare Boreum quadrangle is one of a series of 30 quadrangle maps of Mars used by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) Astrogeology Research Program. The Mare Boreum quadrangle is also referred to as MC-1 (Mars Chart-1).Davies, M.E.; Batson, R.M.; Wu, S.S.C. \\"Geodesy and Cartography\\" in Kieffer, H.H.; Jakosky, B.M.; Snyder, C.W.; Matthews, M.S., Eds. Mars. University of Arizona Press: Tucson, 1992. Its name derives from an older name for a feature that is now called Planum Boreum, a large plain surrounding the polar cap.Patrick Moore and Robin Rees, ed. Patrick Moore's Data Book of Astronomy (Cambridge University Press, 2011), p. 130. The quadrangle covers all of the Martian surface north of latitude 65¬∞. It includes the north polar ice cap, which has a swirl pattern and is roughly across. Mariner 9 in 1972 discovered a belt of sand dunes that ring the polar ice deposits, which is across in some places and may be the largest dune field in the solar system.Hartmann, W. 2003. A Traveler's Guide to Mars. Workman Publishing. NY NY. The ice cap is surrounded by the vast plains of Planum Boreum and Vastitas Borealis. Close to the pole, there is a large valley, Chasma Boreale, that may have been formed from water melting from the ice cap.Clifford, S. 1987. Polar basal melting on Mars. J. Geophys. Res. 92: 9135-9152. An alternative view is that it was made by winds coming off the cold pole.Howard, A. 2000. The role of eolian processes in forming surface features of the martian polar layered deposits. Icarus. 144: 267-288.Edgett, K. et al. 2003. Mars landscape evolution: influence of stratigraphy on geomorphology of the north polar region. Geomorphology. 52: 289-298. Another prominent feature is a smooth rise, formerly called Olympia Planitia. In the summer, a dark collar around the residual cap becomes visible; it is mostly caused by dunes. The quadrangle includes some very large craters that stand out in the north because the area is smooth with little change in topography. These large craters are Lomonosov and Korolev. Although smaller, the crater Stokes is also prominent. The Phoenix lander landed on Vastitas Borealis within the Mare Boreum quadrangle at 68.218830¬∞ N and 234.250778¬∞ E on May 25, 2008. The probe collected and analyzed soil samples in an effort to detect water and determine how hospitable the planet might once have been for life to grow. It remained active there until winter conditions became too harsh around five months later. After the mission ended the journal Science reported that chloride, bicarbonate, magnesium, sodium potassium, calcium, and possibly sulfate were detected in the samples analyzed by Phoenix. The pH was narrowed down to 7.7¬±0.5. Perchlorate (ClO4), a strong oxidizer at elevated temperatures, was detected. This was a significant discovery because the chemical has the potential of being used for rocket fuel and as a source of oxygen for future colonists. Also, under certain conditions perchlorate can inhibit life; however some microorganisms obtain energy from the substance (by anaerobic reduction). The chemical when mixed with water can greatly lower freezing points, in a manner similar to how salt is applied to roads to melt ice. So, perchlorate may be allowing small amounts of liquid water to form on Mars today. Gullies, which are common in certain areas of Mars, may have formed from perchlorate melting ice and causing water to erode soil on steep slopes.Hecht, M. et al. 2009. Detection of Perchlorate and the Soluble Chemistry of Martian Soil at the Phoenix Lander Site. Science: 325. 64‚Äì67 Much direct evidence was found for water at this location.Smith, P., et al. 2009. H2O at the Phoenix Landing Site. Science: 325, 58-61. Freezing of atmosphere Research based on slight changes in the orbits of spacecraft around Mars over 16 years found that when one hemisphere experiences winter, approximately 3 trillion to 4 trillion tons of carbon dioxide freezes out of the atmosphere onto the northern and southern polar caps. This represents 12 to 16 percent of the mass of the entire Martian atmosphere.

In March 2015, a team of scientists published results showing that this region was highly enriched with deuterium, heavy hydrogen, by seven times as much as the Earth. This means that Mars has lost a volume of water 6.5 times what is stored in today's polar caps. The water for a time would have formed an ocean in the low-lying Mare Boreum. The amount of water could have covered the planet about 140 meters, but was probably in an ocean that in places would be almost 1 mile deep. This international team used ESO's Very Large Telescope, along with instruments at the W. M. Keck Observatory and the NASA Infrared Telescope Facility, to map out different forms of water in Mars's atmosphere over a six-year period.https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/03/150305140447.htm.

Dunes Sand dunes have been found in many places on Mars. The presence of dunes shows that the planet has an atmosphere with wind, for dunes require wind to pile up the sand. Most dunes on Mars are black because of the weathering of the volcanic rock basalt.http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_016459_1830 Black sand can be found on Earth on Hawaii and on some tropical South Pacific islands.https://www.desertusa.com/desert-activity/sand-dune-wind1.html Sand is common on Mars due to the old age of the surface that has allowed rocks to erode into sand. Dunes on Mars have been observed to move many meters.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur_TeOs3S64https://uanews.arizona.edu/story/the- flowing-sands-of-mars In this process, sand moves up the windward side and then falls down the leeward side of the dune, thus caused the dune to go toward the leeward side (or slip face).Namowitz, S., Stone, D. 1975. earth science the world we live in. American Book Company. New York. When images are enlarged, some dunes on Mars display ripples on their surfaces.https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=6551 These are caused by sand grains rolling and bouncing up the windward surface of a dune.

The northern area contains relatively smooth plains; the central area, mesas and buttes; and, the southern area, numerous craters. The Ismenius Lacus quadrangle is one of a series of 30 quadrangle maps of Mars used by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) Astrogeology Research Program. The quadrangle is located in the northwestern portion of Mars‚Äô eastern hemisphere and covers 0¬∞ to 60¬∞ east longitude (300¬∞ to 360¬∞ west longitude) and 30¬∞ to 65¬∞ north latitude. The quadrangle uses a Lambert conformal conic projection at a nominal scale of 1:5,000,000 (1:5M). The Ismenius Lacus quadrangle is also referred to as MC-5 (Mars Chart-5).Davies, M.E.; Batson, R.M.; Wu, S.S.C. \\"Geodesy and Cartography\\" in Kieffer, H.H.; Jakosky, B.M.; Snyder, C.W.; Matthews, M.S., Eds.

The term is Latin for Ismenian Lake, and refers to the Ismenian Spring near Thebes in Greece where Cadmus slew the guardian dragon. Cadmus was the legendary founder of Thebes, and had come to the spring to fetch water. The name was approved by the International Astronomical Union (IAU) in 1958.USGS Gazetteer of Planetary Nomenclature. Mars. http://planetarynames.wr.usgs.gov/. There appeared to be a large canal in this region called Nilus. Since 1881‚Äì1882 it was split into other canals, some were called Nilosyrtis, Protonilus (first Nile),and Deuteronilus (second Nile).Blunck, J. 1982. Mars and its Satellites. Exposition Press.

However, a few large craters do stand out. The giant impact crater, Lyot, is easy to see in the northern part of Ismenius Lacus.U.S. department of the Interior U.S. Geological Survey, Topographic Map of the Eastern Region of Mars M 15M 0/270 2AT, 1991 Lyot Crater is the deepest point in Mars's northern hemisphere.http://space.com/scienceastronomy/090514--mars-rivers.html One image below of Lyot Crater Dunes shows a variety of interesting forms: dark dunes, light-toned deposits, and Dust Devil Tracks. Dust devils, which resemble miniature tornados create the tracks by removing a thin, but bright deposit of dust to reveal the darker underlying surface. Light-toned deposits are widely believed to contain minerals formed in water. Research, published in June 2010, described evidence for liquid water in Lyot crater in the past. Many channels have been found near Lyot Crater. Research, published in 2017, concluded that the channels were made from water released when the hot ejecta landed on a layer of ice that was 20 to 300 meters thick. Calculations suggest that the ejecta would have had a temperature of at least 250 degrees Fahrenheit. The valleys seem to start from beneath the ejecta near the outer edge of the ejecta. One evidence for this idea is that there are few secondary craters nearby. Few secondary craters were formed because most landed on ice and did not affect the ground below. The ice accumulated in the area when the climate was different. The tilt or obliquity of the axis changes frequently. During periods of greater tilt, ice from the poles is redistributed to the mid-latitudes. The existence of these channels is unusual because although Mars used to have water in rivers, lakes, and an ocean, these features have been dated to the Noachian and Hesperian periods‚Äî4 to 3 billion years ago.http://spaceref.com/mars/hot-rocks-led-to-relatively-recent-water-carved- valleys-on-mars.html Image:Lyot Mars Crater Gullies.jpgLyot Crater Gullies, as seen by HiRISE.

As craters get larger (greater than 10 km in diameter), they usually have a central peak.http://www.lpi.usra.edu/publications/slidesets/stones/ The peak is caused by a rebound of the crater floor following the impact. Sometimes craters will display layers in their walls. Since the collision that produces a crater is like a powerful explosion, rocks from deep underground are tossed unto the surface. Hence, craters are useful for showing us what lies deep under the surface.

Fretted terrain contains smooth, flat lowlands along with steep cliffs. The scarps or cliffs are usually 1 to 2 km high. Channels in the area have wide, flat floors and steep walls. Many buttes and mesas are present. In fretted terrain the land seems to transition from narrow straight valleys to isolated mesas.Sharp, R. 1973. Mars Fretted and chaotic terrains. J. Geophys. Res.: 78. 4073‚Äì4083 Most of the mesas are surrounded by forms that have been called a variety of names: circum-mesa aprons, debris aprons, rock glaciers, and lobate debris aprons.http://www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2000/pdf/1053.pdf At first they appeared to resemble rock glaciers on Earth. But scientists could not be sure. Even after the Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) Mars Orbiter Camera (MOC) took a variety of pictures of fretted terrain, experts could not tell for sure if material was moving or flowing as it would in an ice-rich deposit (glacier). Eventually, proof of their true nature was discovered by radar studies with the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter showed that they contain pure water ice covered with a thin layer of rocks that insulated the ice.Plaut, J. et al. 2008.

File:ESP 057020 2180fretterrain.jpgExample of frettered terrain, as seen by HiRISE under HiWish program Fretted terrain contains many wide, flat-floored valleys.  Glaciers  Glaciers formed much of the observable surface in large areas of Mars. Much of the area in high latitudes, especially the Ismenius Lacus quadrangle, is believed to still contain enormous amounts of water ice.http://www.esa.int/SPECIALS/Mars_Express/SEMBS5V681F_0.html In March 2010, scientists released the results of a radar study of an area called Deuteronilus Mensae that found widespread evidence of ice lying beneath a few meters of rock debris.http://news.discovery.com/space/mars-ice-sheet- climate.html The ice was probably deposited as snowfall during an earlier climate when the poles were tilted more.Madeleine, J. et al. 2007. Exploring the northern mid-latitude glaciation with a general circulation model. In: Seventh International Conference on Mars. Abstract 3096. It would be difficult to take a hike on the fretted terrain where glaciers are common because the surface is folded, pitted, and often covered with linear striations.http://www.uahirise.org/ESP_018857_2225 The striations show the direction of movement. Much of this rough texture is due to sublimation of buried ice. The ice goes directly into a gas (this process is called sublimation) and leaves behind an empty space. Overlying material then collapses into the void.http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/PSP_009719_2230 Glaciers are not pure ice; they contain dirt and rocks. At times, they will dump their load of materials into ridges. Such ridges are called moraines. Some places on Mars have groups of ridges that are twisted around; this may have been due to more movement after the ridges were put into place. Sometimes chunks of ice fall from the glacier and get buried in the land surface. When they melt, a more or less round hole remains.http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/PSP_006278_2225 On Earth we call these features kettles or kettle holes.Mendon Ponds Park in upstate New York has preserved several of these kettles. The picture from HiRISE below shows possible kettles in Moreux Crater. Image:Evidence of Glaciers in Fretted terrain.JPGThe arrow in the left picture points to a possibly valley carved by a glacier.

Climate change caused ice-rich features Many features on Mars, especially ones found in the Ismenius Lacus quadrangle, are believed to contain large amounts of ice. The most popular model for the origin of the ice is climate change from large changes in the tilt of the planet's rotational axis. At times the tilt has even been greater than 80 degrees Large changes in the tilt explains many ice-rich features on Mars. Studies have shown that when the tilt of Mars reaches 45 degrees from its current 25 degrees, ice is no longer stable at the poles. Furthermore, at this high tilt, stores of solid carbon dioxide (dry ice) sublimate, thereby increasing the atmospheric pressure. This increased pressure allows more dust to be held in the atmosphere. Moisture in the atmosphere will fall as snow or as ice frozen onto dust grains. Calculations suggest this material will concentrate in the mid-latitudes.Hauber, E., D. Reiss, M. Ulrich, F. Preusker, F. Trauthan, M. Zanetti, H. Hiesinger, R. Jaumann, L. Johansson, A. Johnsson, S. Van Gaselt, M. Olvmo. 2011. Landscape evolution in Martian mid-latitude regions: insights from analogous periglacial landforms in Svalbard. In: Balme, M., A. Bargery, C. Gallagher, S. Guta (eds). Martian Geomorphology. Geological Society, London. Special Publications: 356. 111‚Äì131 General circulation models of the Martian atmosphere predict accumulations of ice-rich dust in the same areas where ice-rich features are found. When the tilt begins to return to lower values, the ice sublimates (turns directly to a gas) and leaves behind a lag of dust. The lag deposit caps the underlying material so with each cycle of high tilt levels, some ice-rich mantle remains behind.Madeleine, J., F. Forget, J. Head, B. Levrard, F. Montmessin. 2007.

First investigated in the Deuteronilus Mensae region, but it occurs in other places as well. The remnants consist of sets of dipping layers in craters and along mesas.http://www.uahirise.org/ESP_048897_2125 Sets of dipping layers may be of various sizes and shapes‚Äîsome look like Aztec pyramids from Central America.

Fractures are believed to have started with small cracks from stresses. Stress is suggested to initiate the fracture process since ribbed upper plains are common when debris aprons come together or near the edge of debris aprons‚Äîsuch sites would generate compressional stresses. Cracks exposed more surfaces, and consequently more ice in the material sublimates into the planet's thin atmosphere. Eventually, small cracks become large canyons or troughs. ESP 028339 2245headarticle.jpgWell developed ribbed upper plains material. These start with small cracks that expand as ice sublimates from the surfaces of the crack. Picture was taken with HiRISE under HiWish program ESP 042765 2245cracks.jpgSmall and large cracks, as seen by HiRISE under HiWish program The small cracks to the left will enlarge to become much larger dues to sublimation of ground ice. A crack exposes more surface area, hence greatly increases sublimation in the thin Martian air. 42765 2245close.jpgClose-up of canyons from previous image, as seen by HiRISE under HiWish program ESP 042198 2235pyramid.jpgView of stress cracks and larger cracks that have been enlarged by sublimation (ice changing directly into gas) This may be the start of ribbed terrain.

Small cracks often contain small pits and chains of pits; these are thought to be from sublimation of ice in the ground.Morgenstern, A., et al. 2007Baker, D., J. Head. 2015. Extensive Middle Amazonian mantling of debris aprons and plains in Deuteronilus Mensae, Mars: Implication for the record of mid-latitude glaciation. Icarus: 260, 269‚Äì288. Large areas of the Martian surface are loaded with ice that is protected by a meters thick layer of dust and other material. However, if cracks appear, a fresh surface will expose ice to the thin atmosphere.Levy, J. et al. 2009. Concentric In a short time, the ice will disappear into the cold, thin atmosphere in a process called sublimation. Dry ice behaves in a similar fashion on the Earth. On Mars sublimation has been observed when the Phoenix lander uncovered chunks of ice that disappeared in a few days.Bright Chunks at Phoenix Lander's Mars Site Must Have Been Ice ‚Äì Official NASA press release (19.06.2008)http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/phoenix/news/phoenix-20080619.html In addition, HiRISE has seen fresh craters with ice at the bottom. After a time, HiRISE saw the ice deposit disappear. Image:Ice sublimating in the Dodo- Goldilocks trench.gifDie-sized clumps of bright material in the enlarged \\"Dodo-Goldilocks\\" trench vanished over the course of four days, implying that they were composed of ice which sublimated following exposure.

The upper plains unit is thought to have fallen from the sky. It drapes various surfaces, as if it fell evenly. As is the case for other mantle deposits, the upper plains unit has layers, is fine-grained, and is ice-rich. It is widespread; it does not seem to have a point source. The surface appearance of some regions of Mars is due to how this unit has degraded. It is a major cause of the surface appearance of lobate debris aprons. The layering of the upper plains mantling unit and other mantling units are believed to be caused by major changes in the planet's climate. Models predict that the obliquity or tilt of the rotational axis has varied from its present 25 degrees to maybe over 80 degrees over geological time. Periods of high tilt will cause the ice in the polar caps to be redistributed and change the amount of dust in the atmosphere.Head, J. et al. 2003.Madeleine, et al. 2014.  Deltas  Researchers have found a number of examples of deltas that formed in Martian lakes. Deltas are major signs that Mars once had a lot of water because deltas usually require deep water over a long period of time to form. In addition, the water level needs to be stable to keep sediment from washing away. Deltas have been found over a wide geographical range. Below, is a pictures of a one in the Ismenius Lacus quadrangle.Irwin III, R. et al. 2005. An intense terminal epoch of widespread fluvial activity on early Mars: 2. Increased runoff and paleolake development. Journal of Geophysical Research: 10. E12S15 Image:Delta in Ismenius Lacus.jpgDelta in Ismenius Lacus quadrangle, as seen by THEMIS.  Pits and cracks  Some places in the Ismenius Lacus quadrangle display large numbers of cracks and pits. It is widely believed that these are the result of ground ice sublimating (changing directly from a solid to a gas). After the ice leaves, the ground collapses in the shape of pits and cracks. The pits may come first. When enough pits form, they unite to form cracks. Image:Cole Fossae Pits.JPGColoe Fossae Pits, as seen by HiRISE. Pits are believed to result from escaping water.

These exhibit concentric fractures and large pieces of ground that seemed to have been pulled apart. Sites like this may have recently had held liquid water, hence they may be fruitful places to search for evidence of life.University of Texas at Austin. \\"A funnel on Mars could be a place to look for life.\\" ScienceDaily.

So, the thought is that they formed, were covered over, and now are being exhumed as material is being eroded. These features are quite noticeable with craters. When a crater forms, it will destroy what's under it and leave a rim and ejecta. In the example below, only part of the crater is visible. if the crater came after the layered feature, it would have removed part of the feature.

Sublimation is the direct change of solid ice to a gas. This is similar to what happens to dry ice on the Earth. Places on Mars that display polygonal ground may indicate where future colonists can find water ice. Patterned ground forms in a mantle layer, called latitude dependent mantle, that fell from the sky when the climate was different.Kreslavsky, M.A., Head, J.W., 2002.

The presence of dunes shows that the planet has an atmosphere with wind, for dunes require wind to pile up the sand. Most dunes on Mars are black because of the weathering of the volcanic rock basalt.http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_016459_1830 Black sand can be found on Earth on Hawaii and on some tropical South Pacific islands.https://www.desertusa.com/desert-activity/sand-dune-wind1.html Sand is common on Mars due to the old age of the surface that has allowed rocks to erode into sand. Dunes on Mars have been observed to move many meters.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur_TeOs3S64https://uanews.arizona.edu/story/the- flowing-sands-of-mars Some dunes move along. In this process, sand moves up the windward side and then falls down the leeward side of the dune, thus caused the dune to go toward the leeward side (or slip face).Namowitz, S., Stone, D. 1975. earth science the world we live in. American Book Company. New York. When images are enlarged, some dunes on Mars display ripples on their surfaces.https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=6551 These are caused by sand grains rolling and bouncing up the windward surface of a dune. The bouncing grains tend to land on the windward side of each ripple. The grains do not bounce very high so it does not take much to stop them.

J., Saunders, R. S. & Schneeberger, D. M. Transitional morphology in west Deuteronilus Mensae, Mars: Implications for modification of the lowland/upland boundary\\" Icarus 1989; 82, 111‚Äì145Clifford, S. M. & Parker, T. J. The evolution of the martian hydrosphere: Implications for the fate of a primordial ocean and the current state of the northern plains\\" Icarus 2001; 154, 40‚Äì79 Much evidence for this ocean has been gathered over several decades. New evidence was published in May 2016. A large team of scientists described how some of the surface in Ismenius Lacus quadrangle was altered by two tsunamis. The tsunamis were caused by asteroids striking the ocean. Both were thought to have been strong enough to create 30 km diameter craters. The first tsunami picked up and carried boulders the size of cars or small houses. The backwash from the wave formed channels by rearranging the boulders. The second came in when the ocean was 300 m lower. The second carried a great deal of ice which was dropped in valleys. Calculations show that the average height of the waves would have been 50 m, but the heights would vary from 10 m to 120 m. Numerical simulations show that in this particular part of the ocean two impact craters of the size of 30 km in diameter would form every 30 million years. The implication here is that a great northern ocean may have existed for millions of years. One argument against an ocean has been the lack of shoreline features. These features may have been washed away by these tsunami events. The parts of Mars studied in this research are Chryse Planitia and northwestern Arabia Terra. These tsunamis affected some surfaces in the Ismenius Lacus quadrangle and in the Mare Acidalium quadrangle.Cornell University. \\"Ancient tsunami evidence on Mars reveals life potential.\\" ScienceDaily.

They are believed to be caused by an impact into ice. The ice is covered by a layer of debris. They are found in parts of Mars that have buried ice. Laboratory experiments confirm that impacts into ice result in a \\"ring mold shape.\\" They are also bigger than other craters in which an asteroid impacted solid rock. Impacts into ice warm the ice and cause it to flow into the ring mold shape.

She is the co-founder and former president of thatgamecompany. Santiago was born in Caracas, Venezuela and was raised in Richmond, Virginia, where she played video games from a young age and was encouraged by her software engineer father to experiment with computers. While attending New York University's Tisch School of the Arts, she became active in experimental theater, and intended to pursue it after earning a master's degree in the Interactive Media Program of the School of Cinematic Arts at the University of Southern California. While there, however, she became involved in video game design, and produced Cloud, a game developed by Jenova Chen and a student team. Its success sparked her and Chen to found thatgamecompany upon graduating, and she became the president. Santiago produced the studio's first two games, Flow and Flower, moving more into her president role during the development of the company's third game, Journey. In addition to her work at thatgamecompany, Santiago is one of the backers of the Indie Fund, a group which invests in the development of independent video games, and is a TED fellow. She married fellow University of Southern California graduate Mike Stein in 2010. After the release of Journey in 2012, Santiago left the company; as of 2015, in addition to serving on several advisory boards, she works for Google Play Games. Biography Santiago was born in Caracas, Venezuela, and was raised in Richmond, Virginia. She played video games from a young age, cooperatively playing them with her younger brother; one of her earliest games was Sleuth, which she describes as \\"simple, but so effective and so evocative\\" in instilling emotion in the player. Her father, a software engineer, had a computer in the house from when she was young, and encouraged Santiago to experiment with it. She moved to New York City at the age of 18 to attend the Tisch School of the Arts of New York University, where she was involved in amateur theater. She focused in theater on developing new works, rather than adapting older ones, and was especially drawn towards incorporating interactive digital media into her works. She ascribes this to her father's work in software engineering and her experiments with computers, which drove her into using them in her performances as she had more experience than the others in her group. She moved to Los Angeles in 2003 when she was 24, and studied towards a master's degree in the Interactive Media Program of the School of Cinematic Arts at the University of Southern California. Her intention was to remain in theater, but in her second semester took a class taught by Tracy Fullerton on the history of game design, which inspired her to focus her studies on video game design instead. The class caused her to realize \\"how much hadn't been done\\" in the realm of communication and expression in video games and the lack of established structure and rules as to how it was best to make games, which appealed to the part of her that was interested in experimental theater. While at school she produced the award- winning game Cloud, developed by Jenova Chen and a student team, and also worked on other video games such as Darfur is Dying. Cloud was intended as an experiment by the group to see if they could create a game that \\"expressed something different than video games had in the past\\", as well as determine the level of interest in the gaming community for video games of that nature. The game received over 400,000 downloads in the first four months after release, \\"more than every single person in every single theater [she] had ever worked in,\\" which convinced Santiago to remain in the video game industry indefinitely. The strong response to the game, released in 2005, inspired her and Chen to consider founding their own company to continue making games like it after they left school‚Äîwhere the design was based on the emotions they wanted to inspire rather than gameplay mechanics. thatgamecompany Upon graduating, Santiago and Chen founded thatgamecompany in May 2006, with a contract with Sony Computer Entertainment to develop three games for the PlayStation Network. In addition to her role as president of the company, she also initially served as the producer for the studio. Despite her job title, she was still involved in the design of the games as well. The first game by the studio was Flow, an adaptation of a game that Chen had made for his thesis at USC, which was released in 2007. The game caused the studio to be noted as a key figure of independent video game development; in 2008, Gamasutra recognized the studio as one of the \\"20 Breakthrough Developers\\" of the year, emphasizing Santiago's key role. The second game for the studio, and the first to be completely original to the company, was Flower, released in 2009. Both titles were heavily praised by critics and received several awards, as well as garnering high sales. For the studio's third game, Journey, thatgamecompany hired Robin Hunicke as the producer, allowing Santiago to focus more on directing the company as a whole. Journey was released on March 13, 2012; two weeks later on March 29, 2012, Santiago announced her departure from thatgamecompany, not specifying what her plans were for the future. During the development of Journey, in 2009, Santiago became a TED fellow, giving a talk at a USC conference where she discussed whether video games were art, which was responded to a year later by Roger Ebert. Santiago was one of the backers of the Indie Fund, started in March 2010, a group which invests in the development of independent video games. In October 2010, Santiago married Mike Stein, whom she met while they were both at the University of Southern California. In 2011 she was named as one of the top 100 most influential women in technology by Fast Company. In March 2013, Santiago joined Ouya to lead developer relations. She also joined the Women in Games International advisory board in May 2014. In this time period, she also became an official advisor for Night Light Interactive. In October 2015, following the sale and dissolution of the company, Santiago left Ouya for Google Play Games. Influences and philosophy Santiago described her work at thatgamecompany as creating emotional responses, in order to demonstrate that video games can create a wider range of experiences than are typically shown. She felt that thatgamecompany's goal during her tenure there was \\"to create games that push the boundaries of videogames as a communicative medium, and to create games that appeal to a wide variety of people.\\" Through this she hopes to change the rest of the industry to also approach making videogames as a \\"creative medium\\" rather than a product. She, both independently with the Indie Fund and through thatgamecompany has tried to support the independent video game development industry by funding and connecting independent game developers.

Origin of name Casius is the name of a telescopic albedo feature located at 40¬∞ N and 100¬∞ E on Mars. The feature was named by Schiaparelli in 1888 after Mt Casius in Egypt, famous in antiquity for the nearby coastal marshes in which whole armies were reputed to have drowned. The name was approved by the International Astronomical Union (IAU) in 1958.USGS Gazetteer of Planetary Nomenclature. Mars. http://planetarynames.wr.usgs.gov/. Physiography and geology The high latitude Casius quadrangle bears several features that are believed to indicate the presence of ground ice. Patterned ground is one such feature. Usually, polygonal shapes are found poleward of 55 degrees latitude.Mangold, N. 2005. High latitude patterned grounds on Mars: Classification, distribution and climatic control. Icarus. 174-336-359.

Kilometer-scale roughness on Mars: Results from MOLA data analysis. J. Geophys. Res. 105 (E11), 26695‚Äì26712. It is commonly believed to be caused by the sublimation of ice from the ground. Sublimation is the direct change of solid ice to a gas. This is similar to what happens to dry ice on the Earth. Places on Mars that display polygonal ground may indicate where future colonists can find water ice. Patterned ground forms in a mantle layer that fell from the sky when the climate was different.Mustard, J., et al. 2001. Evidence for recent climate change on Mars from the identification of youthful near-surface ground ice. Nature 412 (6845), 411‚Äì414. Polygonal ground is generally divided into two kinds: high center and low center. The middle of a high center polygon is 10 meters across and its troughs are 2‚Äì3 meters wide. Low center polygons are 5‚Äì10 meters across and the boundary ridges are 3‚Äì4 meters wide. Low center polygons have been proposed as a marker for ground ice.Soare, R., et al. 2018.

The rebound forms the ring-mold shape, and then dust and debris settle on the top to insulate the ice. Concentric crater fill Concentric crater fill is when the floor of a crater is mostly covered with a large number of parallel ridges.http://hiroc.lpl.arizona.edu/images/PSP/diafotizo.php?ID=PSP_111926_2185 They are thought to result from a glacial type of movement.Head, J. et al. 2006.

Based on accurate topography measures of height at different points in these craters and calculations of how deep the craters should be based on their diameters, it is thought that the craters are 80% filled with mostly ice. That is, they hold hundreds of meters of material that probably consists of ice with a few tens of meters of surface debris.Garvin, J. et al. 2002.

Sci.: 41. 1633-1646 High resolution pictures taken with HiRISE reveal that some of the surfaces of concentric crater fill are covered with strange patterns called closed-cell and open-cell brain terrain. The terrain resembles a human brain. It is believed to be caused by cracks in the surface accumulating dust and other debris, together with ice sublimating from some of the surfaces.Ley, J. et al. 2009.

Click on image to see layers. Climate change caused ice-rich features Many features on Mars, including many in Casius quadrangle, are believed to contain large amounts of ice. The most popular model for the origin of the ice is climate change from large changes in the tilt of the planet's rotational axis. At times the tilt has even been greater than 80 degreesTouma J. and J. Wisdom. 1993. The Chaotic Obliquity of Mars. Science 259, 1294-1297.Laskar, J., A. Correia, M. Gastineau, F. Joutel, B. Levrard, and P. Robutel. 2004. Long term evolution and chaotic diffusion of the insolation quantities of Mars. Icarus 170, 343-364. Large changes in the tilt explains many ice-rich features on Mars. Studies have shown that when the tilt of Mars reaches 45 degrees from its current 25 degrees, ice is no longer stable at the poles.Levy, J., J. Head, D. Marchant, D. Kowalewski. 2008. Identification of sublimation-type thermal contraction crack polygons at the proposed NASA Phoenix landing site: Implications for substrate properties and climate-driven morphological evolution. Geophys. Res. Lett. 35. doi:10.1029/2007GL032813. Furthermore, at this high tilt, stores of solid carbon dioxide (dry ice) sublimate, thereby increasing the atmospheric pressure. This increased pressure allows more dust to be held in the atmosphere. Moisture in the atmosphere will fall as snow or as ice frozen onto dust grains. Calculations suggest this material will concentrate in the mid-latitudes.Levy, J., J. Head, D. Marchant. 2009a.

Geological Society, London. Special Publications: 356. 111-131 General circulation models of the Martian atmosphere predict accumulations of ice-rich dust in the same areas where ice-rich features are found.Laskar, J., A. Correia, M. Gastineau, F. Joutel, B. Levrard, and P. Robutel. 2004. Long term evolution and chaotic diffusion of the insolation quantities of Mars. Icarus 170, 343-364. When the tilt begins to return to lower values, the ice sublimates (turns directly to a gas) and leaves behind a lag of dust.Mellon, M., B. Jakosky. 1995. The distribution and behavior of Martian ground ice during past and present epochs. J. Geophys. Res. 100, 11781‚Äì11799.Schorghofer, N., 2007. Dynamics of ice ages on Mars. Nature 449, 192‚Äì194. The lag deposit caps the underlying material so with each cycle of high tilt levels, some ice-rich mantle remains behind.Madeleine, J., F. Forget, J. Head, B. Levrard, F. Montmessin. 2007. Exploring the northern mid-latitude glaciation with a general circulation model. In: Seventh International Conference on Mars. Abstract 3096. Note, that the smooth surface mantle layer probably represents only relative recent material.  Mars Science Laboratory  Nilosyrtis is one of the sites proposed as a landing site for the Mars Science Laboratory. However, it did not make the final cut. It was in the top 7, but not in the top 4. The aim of the Mars Science Laboratory is to search for signs of ancient life. It is hoped that a later mission could then return samples from sites identified as probably containing remains of life. To safely bring the craft down, a 12-mile-wide, smooth, flat circle is needed. Geologists hope to examine places where water once ponded.http://themis.asu.edu/features/ianichaos They would like to examine sediment layers. Layers Many places on Mars show rocks arranged in layers. A detailed discussion of layering with many Martian examples can be found in Sedimentary Geology of Mars.Grotzinger, J. and R. Milliken (eds.). 2012. Sedimentary Geology of Mars. SEPM. Rock can form layers in a variety of ways. Volcanoes, wind, or water can produce layers. Layers may be formed by groundwater rising up depositing minerals and cementing sediments. The hardened layers are consequently more protected from erosion. This process may occur instead of layers forming under lakes. Image:ESP_028509layers.jpgLayers, as seen by HiRISE under HiWish program. Image:Layers in Monument Valley.jpgLayers in Monument Valley. These are accepted as being formed, at least in part, by water deposition. Since Mars contains similar layers, water remains as a major cause of layering on Mars.

Gullies Martian gullies are small, incised networks of narrow channels and their associated downslope sediment deposits, found on the planet of Mars. They are named for their resemblance to terrestrial gullies. First discovered on images from Mars Global Surveyor, they occur on steep slopes, especially on the walls of craters. Usually, each gully has a dendritic alcove at its head, a fan-shaped apron at its base, and a single thread of incised channel linking the two, giving the whole gully an hourglass shape.Malin, M., Edgett, K. 2000. Evidence for recent groundwater seepage and surface runoff on Mars. Science 288, 2330‚Äì2335. They are believed to be relatively young because they have few, if any craters. A subclass of gullies is also found cut into the faces of sand dunes which themselves considered to be quite young. On the basis of their form, aspects, positions, and location amongst and apparent interaction with features thought to be rich in water ice, many researchers believed that the processes carving the gullies involve liquid water. However, this remains a topic of active research. As soon as gullies were discovered, researchers began to image many gullies over and over, looking for possible changes. By 2006, some changes were found.Malin, M., K. Edgett, L. Posiolova, S. McColley, E. Dobrea. 2006. Present-day impact cratering rate and contemporary gully activity on Mars. Science 314, 1573_1577. Later, with further analysis it was determined that the changes could have occurred by dry granular flows rather than being driven by flowing water.Kolb, et al. 2010. Investigating gully flow emplacement mechanisms using apex slopes. Icarus 2008, 132-142.McEwen, A. et al. 2007. A closer look at water-related geological activity on Mars. Science 317, 1706-1708.Pelletier, J., et al. 2008. Recent bright gully deposits on Mars wet or dry flow? Geology 36, 211-214. With continued observations many more changes were found in Gasa Crater and others.NASA/Jet Propulsion Laboratory. \\"NASA orbiter finds new gully channel on Mars.\\" ScienceDaily. ScienceDaily, 22 March 2014. www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2014/03/140322094409.htm With more repeated observations, more and more changes have been found; since the changes occur in the winter and spring, experts are tending to believe that gullies were formed from dry ice. Before-and-after images demonstrated the timing of this activity coincided with seasonal carbon-dioxide frost and temperatures that would not have allowed for liquid water. When dry ice frost changes to a gas, it may lubricate dry material to flow especially on steep slopes.http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?release=2014-226http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_032078_1420http://www.space.com/26534-mars- gullies-dry-ice.html In some years frost, perhaps as thick as 1 meter. ESP 041866 2290gulliescasius.jpgGullies in crater, as seen by HiRISE under HiWish program Pedestal craters A pedestal crater is a crater with its ejecta sitting above the surrounding terrain and thereby forming a raised platform (like a pedestal). They form when an impact crater ejects material which forms an erosion-resistant layer, thus causing the immediate area to erode more slowly than the rest of the region. Some pedestals have been accurately measured to be hundreds of meters above the surrounding area. This means that hundreds of meters of material were eroded away. The result is that both the crater and its ejecta blanket stand above the surroundings. Pedestal craters were first observed during the Mariner missions.http://hirise.lpl.eduPSP_008508_1870Bleacher, J. and S. Sakimoto.

As a result of this process, craters appear perched above their surroundings Cones Some locations on Mars display a large number of cones. Many have pits at the top. There have been a number of ideas put forth as to their origins. Some are in the Casius quadrangle like the ones below.

Linear ridge networks Linear ridge networks are found in various places on Mars in and around craters.Head, J., J. Mustard. 2006. Breccia dikes and crater-related faults in impact craters on Mars: Erosion and exposure on the floor of a crater 75 km in diameter at the dichotomy boundary, Meteorit. Planet Science: 41, 1675-1690. Ridges often appear as mostly straight segments that intersect in a lattice-like manner. They are hundreds of meters long, tens of meters high, and several meters wide. It is thought that impacts created fractures in the surface, these fractures later acted as channels for fluids. Fluids cemented the structures. With the passage of time, surrounding material was eroded away, thereby leaving hard ridges behind. Since the ridges occur in locations with clay, these formations could serve as a marker for clay which requires water for its formation.Mangold et al. 2007.

This process may still be happening at present. This topography may be of great importance for future colonization of Mars because it may point to deposits of pure ice.Dundas, C., S. Bryrne, A. McEwen. 2015. Modeling the development of martian sublimation thermokarst landforms. Icarus: 262, 154-169. On November 22, 2016, NASA reported finding a large amount of underground ice in the Utopia Planitia region of Mars.http://www.space.com/34811-mars-ice-more-water-than-lake-superior.html The volume of water detected has been estimated to be equivalent to the volume of water in Lake Superior. The volume of water ice in the region were based on measurements from the ground-penetrating radar instrument on Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, called SHARAD. From the data obtained from SHARAD, ‚Äúdielectric permittivity‚Äù, or the dielectric constant was determined. The dielectric constant value was consistent with a large concentration of water ice.Bramson, A, et al. 2015. Widespread excess ice in Arcadia Planitia, Mars.

File:55198 2170mantleclose.jpgClose view of mantle near the dipping layers, as seen by HiRISE under HiWish program Craters Impact craters generally have a rim with ejecta around them, in contrast volcanic craters usually do not have a rim or ejecta deposits. As craters get larger (greater than 10 km in diameter) they usually have a central peak.http://www.lpi.usra.edu/publications/slidesets/stones/ The peak is caused by a rebound of the crater floor following the impact. If one measures the diameter of a crater, the original depth can be estimated with various ratios. Because of this relationship, researchers have found that many Martian craters contain a great deal of material; much of it is believed to be ice deposited when the climate was different.Garvin, J., et al. 2002. Global geometric properities of martian impact craters. Lunar Planet Sci. 33. Abstract @1255. Sometimes craters expose layers that were buried. Rocks from deep underground are tossed onto the surface. Hence, craters can show us what lies deep under the surface.

These dust devils leave tracks on the surface of mars because they disturb a thin coating of fine bright dust that covers most of the Martian surface. When a dust devil goes by it blows away the coating and exposes the underlying dark surface. Within a few weeks, the dark track assumes its former bright colour, either by being re-covered through wind action or due to surface oxidation through exposure to sunlight and air.

The northwest contains relatively smooth plains; the southeast contains Hecates Tholus (one of three Elysium shield volcanoes) and Phlegra Montes (a ridge system). The Cebrenia quadrangle is one of a series of 30 quadrangle maps of Mars used by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) Astrogeology Research Program. The quadrangle is located in the northeastern portion of Mars‚Äô eastern hemisphere and covers 120¬∞ to 180¬∞ east longitude (180¬∞ to 240¬∞ west longitude) and 30¬∞ to 65¬∞ north latitude. The quadrangle uses a Lambert conformal conic projection at a nominal scale of 1:5,000,000 (1:5M). The Cebrenia quadrangle is also referred to as MC-7 (Mars Chart-7).Davies, M.E.; Batson, R.M.; Wu, S.S.C. ‚ÄúGeodesy and Cartography‚Äù in Kieffer, H.H.; Jakosky, B.M.; Snyder, C.W.; Matthews, M.S., Eds. Mars. University of Arizona Press: Tucson, 1992. It includes part of Utopia Planitia and Arcadia Planitia. The southern and northern borders of the Cebrenia quadrangle are approximately and wide, respectively. The north to south distance is about (slightly less than the length of Greenland).Distances calculated using NASA World Wind measuring tool. http://worldwind.arc.nasa.gov/. The quadrangle covers an approximate area of 4.9 million square km, or a little over 3% of Mars‚Äô surface area.Approximated by integrating latitudinal strips with area of R^2 (L1-L2)(cos(A)dA) from 30¬∞ to 65¬∞ latitude; where R = 3889 km, A is latitude, and angles expressed in radians. See: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1340223/calculating-area- enclosed-by-arbitrary-polygon-on-earths-surface. Origin of name Cebrenia is a telescopic albedo feature centered on 50¬∞ N and 150¬∞ E on Mars. The feature is named after Cebrenia, a country near ancient Troy. The name was approved by the International Astronomical Union (IAU) in 1958. Physiography and geology The quadrangle's prominent features are the large craters Mie and Stokes, a volcano, Hecates Tholus, and a group of mountains, Phlegra Montes. This area is a flat, smooth plain for the most part, so the relatively large craters Mie and Stokes really stand out. The Galaxias Region has an area of chaos, where the ground seems to have collapsed. Viking II (part of Viking program) landed near Mie on September 3, 1976. Its landing coordinates were 48¬∞ N and 226¬∞ W.Ezell E. K., Ezell L. N. On Mars: Exploration of the Red Planet. 1958-1978. (Chapter 10). The NASA History Series. Scientific and Technical Information Branch, 1984. NASA, Washington, D.C. Results from Viking II mission  What it would look like walking around the landing site  The sky would be a light pink. The dirt would also appear pink. The surface would be uneven; the soil would be formed into troughs. Large rocks would be spread about. Most of the rocks are similar in size. Many of the rocks would have small holes or bubbles on their surfaces caused by gas escaping after the rocks came to the surface. Some boulders would show erosion due to the wind. Many rocks would appear to be perched, as if wind removed much of the soil at their bases.Mutch, T. et al. 1976. The Surface of Mars: The View from the Viking 2 Lander. Science: 194. 1277-1283.Hartmann, W. 2003. A Traveler's Guide to Mars. Workman Publishing. NY NY. In the winter snow or frost would cover most of the ground. There would be many small sand dunes that are still active. The wind speed would typically be 7 meters per second (16 miles per hour). There would be a hard crust on the top of the soil similar to a deposit, called caliche which is common in the U.S. Southwest. Such crusts are formed by solutions of minerals moving up through soil and evaporating at the surface.Arvidson, R. A. Binder, and K. Jones. 1976. The Surface of Mars. Scientific American: 238. 76-89. Scientists, in a September, 2009 article in the journal Science, have asserted that if Viking II only dug four (4) inches deeper, it would have reached a layer of almost pure ice.http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/090924-mars-crater- ice.htmlhttp://news.aol.com/article/nasa-spacecraft-sees-ice-on-mars- exposed/686020http://nasa.gov/mission/MRO/news/mro20090924.html  Analysis of soil  Image from Mars taken by Viking 2 The soil resembled those produced from the weathering of basaltic lavas. The tested soil contained abundant silicon and iron, along with significant amounts of magnesium, aluminum, sulfur, calcium, and titanium. Trace elements, strontium and yttrium, were detected. The amount of potassium was 5 times lower than the average for the Earth's crust. Some chemicals in the soil contained sulfur and chlorine that were like typical compounds remaining after the evaporation of sea water. Sulfur was more concentrated in the crust on top of the soil then in the bulk soil beneath. The sulfur may be present as sulfates of sodium, magnesium, calcium, or iron. A sulfide of iron is also possible.Clark, B. et al. 1976. Inorganic Analysis of Martian Samples at the Viking Landing Sites. Science: 194. 1283-1288. The Spirit Rover and the Opportunity Rover both found sulfates on Mars.http://marsrovers.nasa.gov/gallery/press/opportunity/20040625a.html The Opportunity Rover (landed in 2004 with advanced instruments) found magnesium sulfate and calcium sulfate at Meridiani Planum.Christensen, P. et al. 2004. Mineralogy at Meridiani Planum from the Mini-TES Experiment on the Opportunity Rover. Science: 306. 1733-1739 Using results from the chemical measurements, mineral models suggest that the soil could be a mixture of about 90% iron-rich clay, about 10% magnesium sulfate (kieserite?), about 5% carbonate (calcite), and about 5% iron oxides (hematite, magnetite, goethite?). These minerals are typical weathering products of mafic igneous rocks.Baird, A. et al. 1976. Mineralogic and Petrologic Implications of Viking Geochemical Results From Mars: Interim Report.

Journal of Geophysical Research: 87. 10059-10097 Studies with magnets aboard the landers indicated that the soil is between 3 and 7 percent magnetic materials by weight. The magnetic chemicals could be magnetite and maghemite. These could come from the weathering of basalt rock.Hargraves, R. et al. 1976. Viking Magnetic Properties Investigation: Further Results. Science: 194. 1303-1309.Arvidson, R, A. Binder, and K. Jones. The Surface of Mars. Scientific American Experiments carried out by the Mars Spirit Rover (landed in 2004) indicated that magnetite could explain the magnetic nature of the dust and soil on Mars. Magnetite was found in the soil and that the most magnetic part of the soil was dark. Magnetite is very dark.Bertelsen, P. et al. 2004. Magnetic Properties Experiments on the Mars Exploration rover Spirit at Gusev Crater. Science: 305. 827-829.  Search for life  Viking did three experiments to look for life. The results were surprising and interesting. Most scientists now believe that the data were due to inorganic chemical reactions of the soil, although a few scientists still believe the results were due to living reactions. No organic chemicals were found in the soil. However, dry areas of Antarctica do not have detectable organic compounds either, but they have organisms living in the rocks.Friedmann, E. 1982. Endolithic Microorganisms in the Antarctic Cold Desert. Science: 215. 1045-1052. Mars has almost no ozone layer, like the Earth, so UV light sterilizes the surface and produces highly reactive chemicals such as peroxides that would oxidize any organic chemicals. The Phoenix Lander discovered the chemical perchlorate in the Martian Soil. Perchlorate is a strong oxidant so it may have destroyed any organic matter on the surface.Alien Rumors Quelled as NASA Announces Phoenix Perchlorate Discovery. A.J.S. Rayl, August 6, 2008. If it is widespread on Mars, carbon- based life would be difficult at the soil surface. Bright part is water ice that has been exposed by impact. The ice was identified using CRISM on the MRO. Location is 55.57 north and 150.62 east. Research, published in the Journal of Geophysical Research in September 2010, proposed that organic compounds were actually present in the soil analyzed by both Viking 1 and 2. NASA's Phoenix lander in 2008 detected perchlorate which can break down organic compounds. The study's authors found that perchlorate will destroy organics when heated and will produce chloromethane and dichloromethane, the identical chlorine compounds discovered by both Viking landers when they performed the same tests on Mars. Because perchlorate would have broken down any Martian organics, the question of whether or not Viking found life is still wide open.https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/09/100904081050.htm Ice exposed in new craters Impressive research, reported in the journal Science in September 2009,Byrne, S. et al. 2009. Distribution of Mid-Latitude Ground Ice on Mars from New Impact Craters: 329.1674-1676 has showed that some new craters on Mars show exposed, pure, water ice. After a time, the ice disappears, evaporating into the atmosphere. The ice is only a few feet deep. The ice was confirmed with the Compact Imaging Spectrometer (CRISM)] on board the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO). The ice was found in a total of 5 locations. Three of the locations are in the Cebrenia quadrangle. These locations are , and . This discovery proves that future colonists on Mars will be able to obtain water from a wide variety of locations. The ice can be dug up, melted, then taken apart to provide fresh oxygen and hydrogen for rocket fuel. Hydrogen is the powerful fuel used by the space shuttle main engines Iceincraterscomparison.jpgTwo pictures from HiRISE showing how ice disappeared over time in a crater. Crater on left is before ice disappeared. Crater is 6 meters in diameter. Other craters Impact craters generally have a rim with ejecta around them, in contrast volcanic craters usually do not have a rim or ejecta deposits. Sometimes craters will display layers. Since the collision that produces a crater is like a powerful explosion, rocks from deep underground are tossed onto the surface. Hence, craters can show us what lies deep under the surface.

The eruptions created depressions on the flanks of the volcano. And just five million years ago, glacial deposits formed inside these depressions.http://www.msnbc.msn/id/7209308/ Some valleys on Hecates show a parallel drainage pattern.

Image:27108cratererosion.jpgCrater on edge of lava flow on Hecates Tholus, as seen by HiRISE under HiWish program. Lava seems to have formed tail shape on the lee side of obstacles like crater rims.  Volcano-ice interactions  Large amounts of water ice are believed to be present under the surface of Mars. Some channels lie near volcanic areas. When hot subsurface molten rock comes close to this ice, large amounts of liquid water and mud may be formed. Hrad Vallis in the Cebrenia quadrangle is close to Elysium Mons, a large volcano, which may have supplied water to create the channel. Hrad Vallis is pictured below.http://themis.asu.edu/zoom-20020715a.html Image:Hrad Vallis in Cebrenia.jpgHrad Vallis may have been formed when the large Elysium Mons volcanic complex melted ground ice, as seen by THEMIS. Image:Hrad Vallis.JPGStreamlined islands in Hrad Vallis, as seen by HiRISE.  Galaxias region  The ground in Galaxias seems to have collapsed. Such land forms on Mars are called \\"Chaos terrain.\\" Galaxias Chaos is different from many other chaotic regions. It does not have associated outflow channels, and it does not display a great elevation difference between it and the surrounding land area, as most of the other chaos regions. Research by Pedersen and Head, published in 2010, suggests that Galaxias Chaos is the site of a volcanic flow that buried an ice-rich layer, called the Vastitas Borealis Formation (VBF). It is generally believed that the VBF is a residue from water-rich materials deposited by large floods. The VBF may have been of varied thickness and may have contained varied amounts of ice. In the thin atmosphere of Mars, this layer would have slowly disappeared by sublimation (changing from a solid directly to a gas). Since some areas would have sublimated more than others, the upper lava cap would not be supported evenly and would crack. Cracks/troughs may have begun from sublimation and shrinkage along the edges of the lava cap. Stress from the undermining of the cap edge would have made cracks in the cap. Places with cracks would undergo more sublimation, then the cracks would widen and form the blocky terrain characteristic of regions of chaos. The sublimation process may have been aided by heat (geothermal flux) from magma movements. There are volcanoes, namely Elysium Montes and Hecates Tholus, nearby which most likely are surrounded by dikes, which would have heated the ground. Also, a warmer period in the past would have increased the amount of water sublimating from the ground.name=\\"Pedersen, G 2011\\" Image:Galaxiascomplete2.jpgThis series of drawings shows a model for the formation of Martian chaos, as proposed by Pedersen and Head 2011Pedersen, G. and J.

They form when an impact crater ejects material which forms an erosion- resistant layer, thus causing the immediate area to erode more slowly than the rest of the region. Some pedestals have been accurately measured to be hundreds of meters above the surrounding area. This means that hundreds of meters of material were eroded away. The result is that both the crater and its ejecta blanket stand above the surroundings. Pedestal craters were first observed during the Mariner missions.http://hirise.lpl.eduPSP_008508_1870Bleacher, J. and S. Sakimoto.

The southeastern part is marked by aureole deposits of the largest known volcano in the solar system, Olympus Mons. The Diacria quadrangle is one of a series of 30 quadrangle maps of Mars used by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) Astrogeology Research Program. The quadrangle is located in the northwestern portion of Mars‚Äô western hemisphere and covers 180¬∞ to 240¬∞ east longitude (120¬∞ to 180¬∞ west longitude) and 30¬∞ to 65¬∞ north latitude. The quadrangle uses a Lambert conformal conic projection at a nominal scale of 1:5,000,000 (1:5M). The Diacria quadrangle is also referred to as MC-2 (Mars Chart-2).Davies, M.E.; Batson, R.M.; Wu, S.S.C. \\"Geodesy and Cartography\\" in Kieffer, H.H.; Jakosky, B.M.; Snyder, C.W.; Matthews, M.S., Eds.

The southern and northern borders of the Diacria quadrangle are approximately and wide, respectively. The north to south distance is about (slightly less than the length of Greenland).Distances calculated using NASA World Wind measuring tool. http://worldwind.arc.nasa.gov/. The quadrangle covers an approximate area of 4.9 million square km, or a little over 3% of Mars‚Äô surface area.Approximated by integrating latitudinal strips with area of R^2 (L1-L2)(cos(A)dA) from 30¬∞ to 65¬∞ latitude; where R = 3889 km, A is latitude, and angles expressed in radians.

The Phoenix Lander‚Äôs landing site (68.22¬∞ N, 234.25¬∞ E) lies about 186 km north of the northeastern quarter of the Diacria quadrangle. The landscape viewed by the Phoenix lander is probably representative of a large portion of the terrain in the northern Diacria quadrangle. Origin of name Diacria is the name of a telescopic albedo feature located at 48¬∞ N and 190¬∞ E on Mars. The feature was named by Greek astronomer E. M. Antoniadi in 1930 after Diacria, the highlands around Marathon in north-west Attica, Greece. The name was approved by the International Astronomical Union (IAU) in 1958.USGS Gazetteer of Planetary Nomenclature. Mars. http://planetarynames.wr.usgs.gov/. Physiography and geology The Diacria quadrangle is located at the northwestern edge of the Tharsis volcanic plateau. Topographic, volcanic, and tectonic features associated with the large volcanoes Olympus Mons (south of map area) and Alba Mons (east of map area) characterize the southeastern and east central portions of the quadrangle. The northern and western areas of the quadrangle lie in the northern lowland plains of Mars and cover portions of Amazonis Planitia (in the south), Arcadia Planitia (west central) and Vastitas Borealis (in the north). The large crater Milankoviƒç (118.4 km in diameter) is located in the north central portion of the quadrangle at 54.7¬∞ N, 213.3¬∞ E. Elevation data from the Mars Orbital Laser Altimeter (MOLA) instrument on the Mars Global Surveyor spacecraft shows that the regional terrain slopes gently downward to the northwest, with the highest elevation about 3.5 km (3,500 m) above datum (Mars \\"sea level\\") on the western flank of the Alba Mons volcano in the southeastern portion of the quadrangle. The lowest points in the quadrangle are about 4.5 km below datum (-4,500 m) in Vastitas Borealis in the northwest corner.JMARS MOLA elevation database.

The regional relief is thus about 8 km, but at a local scale, slopes are very shallow; the portion of Amazonis Planitia in the south central part of the quadrangle contains some of the flattest terrain on the entire planet.Goddard Spaceflight Center. Global Slope and Roughness Maps of Mars from MOLA. http://ssed.gsfc.nasa.gov/tharsis/slopes.html. What does the surface look like Approximate-color photomosaic of cryoturbation polygons due to the Martian permafrost. Unlike some other places visited on Mars with landers (Viking and Pathfinder), nearly all the rocks near Phoenix are small. For about as far as the camera can see, the land is flat, but shaped into polygons between 2‚Äì3 meters in diameter and is bounded by troughs that are 20 cm to 50 cm deep. These shapes are due to ice in the soil expanding and contracting due to major temperature changes. The microscope showed that the soil on top of the polygons is composed of flat particles (probably a type of clay) and rounded particles. Also, unlike other places visited on Mars, the site has no ripples or dunes.Smith, P. et al. H2O at the Phoenix Landing Site. 2009. Science:325. p58-61 Ice is present a few inches below the surface in the middle of the polygons, and along its edges, the ice is at least 8 inches deep. Pictures of the surface under the lander appear to show that the landing rockets may have exposed a layer of ice.Smith, P., et al. 2009. H2O at the Phoenix Landing Site. Science: 325, 58-61.https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/phoenix/news/phoenix-20080530.html When the ice is exposed to the Martian atmosphere it slowly sublimates.The Dirt on Mars Lander Soil Findings Some dust devils were observed.

Sublimation is the direct change of solid ice to a gas. This is similar to what happens to dry ice on the Earth.

Western flank of Alba Mons The western flank of the Alba Mons volcano makes up the eastern and southeastern edge of the quadrangle. In terms of area, Alba Mons (formerly, Alba Patera) is the largest volcanic feature on Mars. The flank has a very low slope (l¬∞ or less) and is characterized by lava flows and an outwardly radiating array of ridges and channels. Some of the channels have a drainage pattern that resembles that formed by rain water on the slopes of terrestrial volcanoes. However, many other channels on the flanks of Alba Mons were clearly formed by flowing lava.Carr, M.H. The Surface of Mars; Cambridge University Press: New York, 2006. The western flank of the volcano also contains some NW-SE trending grabens (Cyane Fossae). An image from High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE) on the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) beautifully shows a line of rimless pit craters in Cyane Fossae. The pits may have formed by the collapse of surface materials into open fractures created as magma intruded the subsurface rock to form dikes.University of Arizona HiRISE Website. http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/PSP_010345_2150.

Acheron Fossae Near the southeast corner of the quadrangle (37¬∞ N, 225¬∞ E) lies a southward sloping, semicircular block of ancient, heavily cratered, highland crust that is dissected by numerous, arcuate troughs (Acheron Fossae). The troughs are grabens, structures formed when the crust moves downward between two faults. Grabens form in areas where the crust has undergone extensional stress. The Acheron Fossae region is partially covered by volcanic deposits from Alba Mons in the east, geologically young basaltic lava flows or sediments in the west and southeast, and the jumbled, furrowed terrain of Lycus Sulci in the south.Plescia, J.B. \\"Acheron Fossae, Mars: Evidence of Fluvial Activity and Mass Flow;\\" Lunar and Planetary Science Conference XXXVII, 2006.

This feature, called the Olympus Mons aureole, consists of several large lobes and has a distinctive corrugated or grooved surface texture. East of Olympus Mons, the aureole is partially covered by lava flows, but where it is exposed it goes by different names (Gigas Sulci, for example). The origin of the aureole remains debated, but it was likely formed by huge landslides or gravity-driven thrust sheets that sloughed off the edges of the Olympus Mons shield.Cattermole P. Mars: the Mystery Unfolds; Oxford University Press: New York, 2001. Image:27356ovalcraterwall.pngCrater wall and floor in Lycus Sulci, as seen by HiRISE under HiWish program.

Grooves indicate movement. Westward from Lycus Sulci, across the flat plains of Amazonis Planitia, lies an elongated region of knobby terrain called Erebus Montes (Erebus Mountains). The region contains hundreds of clustered to isolated hillocks that stand 500 to 1,000 m above the surrounding plains. The presence of numerous partly filled \\"ghost\\" craters in the area indicates that the hills represent the high-standing remnants of ancient highland crust that was inundated by lava flows and (possibly) alluvial sediments from Tharsis in the southeast and the Elysium volcanic province to the west.Tanaka, K.L.; Skinner, J.A.; Hare, T.M. Geologic Map of the Northern Plains of Mars. Scientific Investigations Map 2888, U.S. Geological Survey, 2005. Arcadia Planitia and Southern Vastitas Borealis North and east of the Erebus Montes are low-lying plains that characterize a large part of the Diacria Quadrangle and of the Martian northern hemisphere in general. Medium resolution Mariner 9 and Viking spacecraft images from the 1970s show that large portions of Arcadia Planitia have an overall mottled (blotchy light and dark) appearance. At higher resolution, landforms commonly consist of lobate flow fronts; small channel segments; wrinkle ridges; pedestal craters; and low, isolated volcano-like hills with summit craters.Tanaka, K.L.; Scott, D.H.; Greely, R. \\"Global Stratigraphy\\" in Kieffer, H.H.; Jakosky, B.M.; Snyder, C.W.; Matthews, M.S., Eds. Mars; University of Arizona Press: Tucson, 1992. MOLA images reveal numerous large, shallowly buried craters, suggesting that an old cratered surface lies under a layer of younger material. At the resolution of the Mars Orbital Camera (MOC) on the Mars Global Surveyor spacecraft (around several m per pixel), much of the northern plains has a distinctly stippled, pitted texture that causes the ground to resemble the surface of a basketball or orange rind. This texture is likely caused by a mantle of ice and dust covering the landscape. The small hollows and pits formed as the ice evaporated (sublimed). The geologic history and origin of the northern plains are complex and still poorly understood. Many of the landforms resemble periglacial features seen on Earth, such as moraines, ice-wedged polygons, and pingos. Arcadia Planitia and Vastitas Borealis likely consist of a hodgepodge of old lava flows, ice-related features, and reworked sediments of diverse origin. Some theorize that the northern plains were once covered by oceans or large lakes. Image:Arcadia Planitia Texture.jpgSurface texture of northern Arcadia Planitia at high resolution. Image:Scandia Colles.jpgHiRISE image of Scandia Colles. Note the \\"basketball\\" texture caused by mantle of dust over surface. Expanded Craters Large impacts often create swarms of small secondary craters from the debris that is blasted out as a consequence of the impact.http://www.uahirise.org/epo/nuggets/expanded-secondary.pdf Studies of a type of secondary craters, called expanded craters, have given us insights into places where abundant ice may be present in the ground. Expanded craters have lost their rims, this may be because any rim that was once present has collapsed into the crater during expansion or, lost its ice, if composed of ice. Excess ice (ice in addition to what is in the pores of the ground) is widespread throughout the Martian mid-latitudes, especially in Arcadia Planitia. In this region, are many expanded secondary craters that probably form from impacts that destabilize a subsurface layer of excess ice, which subsequently sublimates. With sublimation the ice changes directly from a solid to gaseous form. In the impact, the excess ice is broken up, resulting in an increase in surface area. Ice will sublimate much more if there is more surface area. After the ice disappears into the atmosphere, dry soil material will collapse and cause the crater diameter to become larger.Viola, D., et al. 2014. EXPANDED CRATERS IN ARCADIA PLANITIA: EVIDENCE FOR >20 MYR OLD SUBSURFACE ICE. Eighth International Conference on Mars (2014). 1022pdf. Places on Mars that display expanded craters may indicate where future colonists can find water ice. ESP 028411 2330expandedcraters.jpgClose view of expanded craters, as seen by HiRISE After the impact, ice left the ground and made the crater larger in diameter. Latitude dependent mantle Much of the surface of Mars is covered by a thick smooth mantle that is thought to be a mixture of ice and dust. This ice-rich mantle, a few yards thick, smoothes the land. Because there are few craters on this mantle, the mantle is relatively young. Changes in Mars's orbit and tilt cause significant changes in the distribution of water ice from polar regions down to latitudes equivalent to Texas. During certain climate periods water vapor leaves polar ice and enters the atmosphere. The water returns to the ground at lower latitudes as deposits of frost or snow mixed with dust. The atmosphere of Mars contains a great deal of fine dust particles. Water vapor condenses on the particles, then they fall down to the ground due to the additional weight of the water coating. When ice at the top of the mantling layer goes back into the atmosphere, it leaves behind dust, which insulates the remaining ice.

Distribution of Mid-Latitude Ground Ice on Mars from New Impact Craters: 329.1674-1676 shows that some newly formed craters have excavated clean, water ice from just below the surface in five locations on Mars. After a short time, the ice disappears, subliming into the atmosphere. The ice is only a few meters deep. The ice was confirmed with the Compact Imaging Spectrometer (CRISM) on board the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO). The ice was found in a total of 5 locations. One of the locations (Site 5) is in the Diacria quadrangle at about 46¬∞ N, 182¬∞ E (Arcadia Planitia).http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/090924-mars-crater- ice.htmlhttp://news.aol.com/article/nasa-spacecraft-sees-ice-on-mars- exposed/686020http://nasa.gov/mission/MRO/news/mro20090924.html This discovery is significant because it shows the presence of subsurface ice at latitudes further south than expected and proves that future colonists on Mars will be able to obtain water from a wide variety of locations. The ice can be dug up, melted, and then taken apart to provide fresh oxygen and hydrogen for rocket fuel. Hydrogen is the powerful fuel used by the space shuttle main engines Dark slope streaks Many places on Mars show dark streaks on steep slopes, such as crater walls. It seems that the youngest streaks are dark and they become lighter with age. Often they begin as a small narrow spot then widen and extend downhill for hundreds of meters. Several ideas have been advanced to explain the streaks. Some involve water,http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/streaks_mars_021200.html or even the growth of organisms.http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/streaks_mars_streaks_030328.html The streaks appear in areas covered with dust. Much of the Martian surface is covered with dust because at more or less regular intervals dust settles out of the atmosphere covering everything. We know a lot about this dust because the solar panels of Mars rovers get covered with dust. The power of the Rovers has been saved many times by the wind, in the form of dust devils that have cleared the panels and boosted the power. So we know that dust falls from the atmosphere frequently.https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/02/090217101110.htm It is most generally accepted that the streaks represent avalanches of dust. Streaks appear in areas covered with dust. When a thin layer of dust is removed, the underlying surface appears dark. Much of the Martian surface is covered with dust. Dust storms are frequent, especially when the spring season begins in the southern hemisphere. At that time, Mars is 40% closer to the sun. The orbit of Mars is much more elliptical then the Earth's. That is the difference between the farthest point from the sun and the closest point to the sun is very great for Mars, but only slight for the Earth. Also, every few years, the entire planet is engulfed in a global dust storm. When NASA's Mariner 9 craft arrived there, nothing could be seen through the dust storm. Other global dust storms have also been observed, since that time. Research, published in January 2012 in Icarus, found that dark streaks were initiated by airblasts from meteorites traveling at supersonic speeds. The team of scientists was led by Kaylan Burleigh, an undergraduate at the University of Arizona. After counting some 65,000 dark streaks around the impact site of a group of 5 new craters, patterns emerged. The number of streaks was greatest closer to the impact site. So, the impact somehow probably caused the streaks. Also, the distribution of the streaks formed a pattern with two wings extending from the impact site. The curved wings resembled scimitars, curved knives. This pattern suggests that an interaction of airblasts from the group of meteorites shook dust loose enough to start dust avalanches that formed the many dark streaks. At first it was thought that the shaking of the ground from the impact caused the dust avalanches, but if that was the case the dark streaks would have been arranged symmetrically around the impacts, rather than being concentrated into curved shapes.Kaylan J. Burleigh, Henry J. Melosh, Livio L. Tornabene, Boris Ivanov, Alfred S. McEwen, Ingrid J. Daubar. Impact air blast triggers dust avalanches on Mars.

Dust and dust devil tracks Large portions of the martian surface are blanketed with bright reddish-ochre dust. The dust particles are typically less than 40 micrometres in size and are composed of iron oxide minerals.Barlow, N. Mars: An Introduction to Its Interior, Surface, and Atmosphere; Cambridge University Press: New York, 2008. Data from the Thermal Emission Spectrometer (TES) on the Mars Global Surveyor spacecraft has allowed planetary scientists to estimate the amount of dust cover for broad swaths of the planet.Ruff, S.W.; Christensen, P.R. \\"Bright and Dark Regions on Mars: Particle Size and Mineralogical Characteristics Based on Thermal Emission Spectrometer Data,\\" Journal of Geophysical Research, 107, E12, 5127, , 2002. In general, the Diacria quadrangle is extremely dusty, particularly in Arcadia Planitia and the region around the flank of Alba Mons and the Olympus Mons aureole in the southeastern portion of the quadrangle. A few large patches of relatively low dust cover occur in Amazonis Planitia and in the northwest corner of the quadrangle.TES Dust Cover Index. http://www.mars.asu.edu/~ruff/DCI/dci.html. Many areas on Mars, including the Diacria quadrangle, experience the passage of giant dust devils. When a dust devil goes by it blows away the coating of dust and exposes the underlying dark surface. Dust devils have been seen from the ground and high overhead from orbit. They have even blown the dust off of the solar panels of the two Rovers on Mars, thereby greatly extending their lives.http://marsrovers.jpl.nasa.gov/gallery/press/spirit/20070412a.html The twin Rovers were designed to last for 3 months, instead they both lasted more than six years, and one is still going. The pattern of the tracks have been shown to change every few months. Image:Milankovic Crater.jpgMilankovic crater central area, as seen by HiRISE.

Gullies Martian gullies are small, incised networks of narrow channels and their associated downslope sediment deposits, found on the planet of Mars. They are named for their resemblance to terrestrial gullies. First discovered on images from Mars Global Surveyor, they occur on steep slopes, especially on the walls of craters. Usually, each gully has a dendritic alcove at its head, a fan-shaped apron at its base, and a single thread of incised channel linking the two, giving the whole gully an hourglass shape.Malin, M., Edgett, K. 2000. Evidence for recent groundwater seepage and surface runoff on Mars. Science 288, 2330‚Äì2335. They are believed to be relatively young because they have few, if any craters. A subclass of gullies is also found cut into the faces of sand dunes which themselves considered to be quite young. On the basis of their form, aspects, positions, and location amongst and apparent interaction with features thought to be rich in water ice, many researchers believed that the processes carving the gullies involve liquid water. However, this remains a topic of active research. The pictures below show examples of gullies in Diacria quadrangle.

It most often occurs when low areas of a landscape become filled with lava or sediment that hardens into material that is more resistant to erosion than the material that surrounds it. Differential erosion then removes the less resistant surrounding material, leaving behind the younger resistant material, which may then appear as a ridge where previously there was a valley. Terms such as \\"inverted valley\\" or \\"inverted channel\\" are used to describe such features.Pain, C.F., and C.D. Ollier, 1995, Inversion of relief - a component of landscape evolution. Geomorphology. 12(2):151-165. Inverted relief has been observed on the surfaces of other planets as well as on Earth. For example, well- documented inverted topographies have been discovered on Mars.Pain, C.F., J.D.A. Clarke, and M. Thomas, 2007, Inversion of relief on Mars. Icarus. 190(2):478‚Äì491.

The southern part contains the large shield volcano Alba Patera and the highly faulted Tempe Terra province, which includes many small volcanoes. Location of Arcadia quadrangle. The Arcadia quadrangle is in the northcentral part of the Martian northwestern hemisphere, in the northern part of the Tharsis volcanic province. The Arcadia quadrangle is one of a series of 30 quadrangle maps of Mars used by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) Astrogeology Research Program. The quadrangle is located in the north-central portion of Mars‚Äô western hemisphere and covers 240¬∞ to 300¬∞ east longitude (60¬∞ to 120¬∞ west longitude) and 30¬∞ to 65¬∞ north latitude. The quadrangle uses a Lambert conformal conic projection at a nominal scale of 1:5,000,000 (1:5M). The Arcadia quadrangle is also referred to as MC-3 (Mars Chart-3).Davies, M.E.; Batson, R.M.; Wu, S.S.C. \\"Geodesy and Cartography\\" in Kieffer, H.H.; Jakosky, B.M.; Snyder, C.W.; Matthews, M.S., Eds. Mars. University of Arizona Press: Tucson, 1992. The southern and northern borders of the Arcadia quadrangle are approximately 3,065 km and 1,500 km wide, respectively. The north to south distance is about 2,050 km (slightly less than the length of Greenland).Distances calculated using NASA World Wind measuring tool. http://worldwind.arc.nasa.gov/. The quadrangle covers an approximate area of 4.9 million square km, or a little over 3% of Mars‚Äô surface area.Approximated by integrating latitudinal strips with area of R^2 (L1-L2)(cos(A)dA) from 30¬∞ to 65¬∞ latitude; where R = 3889 km, A is latitude, and angles expressed in radians. See: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1340223/calculating-area-enclosed-by- arbitrary-polygon-on-earths-surface. The region called Tempe Terra is in the Arcadia quadrangle. Several features found in this quadrangle are interesting, especially gullies which are believed to be caused by relatively recent flows of liquid water. Dark slope streaks and dust devil tracks can have a striking appearance. Origin of Name Arcadia is the name of a telescopic albedo feature located at 45¬∞ north latitude (N) and 260¬∞ east longitude (E) on Mars. The feature was named after a mountainous region in southern Greece.Blunck, J. 1982. Mars and its Satellites. Exposition Press. Smithtown, N.Y. The name was approved by the International Astronomical Union(IAU) in 1958.USGS Gazetteer of Planetary Nomenclature. Mars. http://planetarynames.wr.usgs.gov/. Physiography and Geology The quadrangle contains Alba Patera, the largest volcano (by area and volume) in the solar system, Mareotis Fossae and Tempe as well as Tempe Terra, a highly fractured block of ancient crust about the size of Alaska. Fossa Large troughs (long narrow depressions) are called fossae in the geographical language used for Mars. This term is derived from Latin; therefore fossa is singular and fossae are plural. These troughs form when the crust is stretched until it breaks. The stretching can be due to the large weight of a nearby volcano. Fossae/pit craters are common near volcanoes in the Tharsis and Elysium system of volcanoes.Skinner, J., L. Skinner, and J. Kargel. 2007. Re-assessment of Hydrovolcanism-based Resurfacing within the Galaxias Fossae Region of Mars. Lunar and Planetary Science XXXVIII (2007) A trough often has two breaks with a middle section moving down, leaving steep cliffs along the sides; such a trough is called a graben. Lake George, in northern New York State, is a lake that sits in a graben. Pit craters are often associated with graben. Pit craters do not have rims or ejecta around them, like impact craters do. Studies have found that on Mars a fault may be as deep as 5 km, that is the break in the rock goes down to 5 km. Moreover, the crack or fault sometimes widens or dilates. This widening causes a void to form with a relatively high volume. When surface material slides into the void, a pit crater or a pit crater chain forms. On Mars, individual pit craters can join to form chains or even to form troughs that are sometimes scalloped.Wyrick, D., D. Ferrill, D. Sims, and S. Colton. 2003. Distribution, Morphology and Structural Associations of Martian Pit Crater Chains. Lunar and Planetary Science XXXIV (2003) Other ideas have been suggested for the formation of fossae and pit craters. There is evidence that they are associated with dikes of magma. Magma might move along, under the surface, breaking the rock and more importantly melting ice. The resulting action would cause a crack to form at the surface. Pit craters are not common on Earth. Sinkholes, where the ground falls into a hole (sometimes in the middle of a town) resemble pit craters on Mars. However, on the Earth these holes are caused by limestone being dissolved thereby causing a void.http://www.swri.edu/4org/d20/DEMPS/planetgeo/planetmars.html Knowledge of the locations and formation mechanisms of pit craters and fossae is important for the future colonization of Mars because they may be reservoirs of water.Ferrill, D., D. Wyrick, A. Morris, D. Sims, and N. Franklin. 2004. Dilational fault slip and pit chain formation on Mars 14:10:4-12 Many grabens are found in the Arcadia quadrangle. Pictures below show examples of grabens in Arcadia. Alba Patera.JPGGraben near Alba Patera, as seen by THEMIS. Graben and catenae, collapse features, both caused by faults.

A thin coating of fine bright dust covers most of the Martian surface. When a dust devil goes by it blows away the coating and exposes the underlying dark surface. Dust devils have been seen from the ground and from orbit. They have even blown dust from the solar panels of the two Rovers on Mars, thereby greatly extending their lives. The twin Rovers were designed to last for 3 months, instead they have lasted more than six years. The first Rover, Spirit, was last heard from in March 2010. Opportunity Rover is still exploring the Red Planet, after more than eight years. The pattern of the tracks have been shown to change every few months. The image below from HiRISE shows some dust devil tracks in the shape of X's. You may need to click on the image for a larger view to see the tracks clearly. Image:Tantalus Fossae.JPGTantalus Fossae, as seen by HiRISE. Click on image to see dust devil tracks.  Dark slope streaks  Many places on Mars show dark streaks on steep slopes like crater walls. It seems that the youngest streaks are dark; then they become lighter with age. Often they begin as a small narrow spot then widen and extend downhill for hundreds of meters. They have been seen to travel around obstacles, like boulders.http://www.space.com/image_of_day_080730.html Several ideas have been advanced to explain the streaks. Some involve water or even the growth of organisms.http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/streaks_mars_streaks_030328.htmlhttp://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/mars_ http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/streaks_mars_021200.html It is most generally accepted that they represent avalanches of dust. The streaks appear in areas covered with dust. When a thin layer of dust is removed, the underlying surface is dark. Much of the Martian surface is covered with dust. Fine dust settles out of the atmosphere covering everything. We know a lot about this dust because the solar panels of the Mars Rovers get covered with dust, thus reducing the electrical energy. The power of the Rovers has been restored many times by the wind, in the form of dust devils, cleaning the panels and boosting the power. So we know that dust falls from the atmosphere and is returned by dust devils over and over. Dust storms are frequent, especially when the spring season begins in the southern hemisphere. At that time, Mars is 40% closer to the sun. The orbit of Mars is much more elliptical then the Earth's. That is the difference between the farthest point from the sun and the closest point to the sun is very great for Mars, but only a slight amount for the Earth. Also, every few years, the entire planet is engulfed in a global dust storm. When NASA's Mariner 9 craft arrived there, nothing could be seen through the dust storm. Other global dust storms have also been observed, since that time. Research, published in January 2012 in Icarus, found that dark streaks were initiated by airblasts from meteorites traveling at supersonic speeds. The team of scientists was led by Kaylan Burleigh, an undergraduate at the University of Arizona. After counting some 65,000 dark streaks around the impact site of a group of 5 new craters, patterns emerged. The number of streaks was greatest closer to the impact site. So, the impact somehow probably caused the streaks. Also, the distribution of the streaks formed a pattern with two wings extending from the impact site. The curved wings resembled scimitars, curved knives. This pattern suggests that an interaction of airblasts from the group of meteorites shook dust loose enough to start dust avalanches that formed the many dark streaks. At first it was thought that the shaking of the ground from the impact caused the dust avalanches, but if that was the case the dark streaks would have been arranged symmetrically around the impacts, rather than being concentrated into curved shapes. Dark streaks can be seen in the image below of Tractus Catena that was taken by HiRISE. Image:Tractus Catena.JPGTractus Catena, as seen by HiRISE. Scale bar is 1,000 meters long.

Gullies occur on steep slopes, especially on the walls of craters. Gullies are believed to be relatively young because they have few, if any craters. Moreover, they lie on top of sand dunes which themselves are considered to be quite young. Usually, each gully has an alcove, channel, and apron. Some studies have found that gullies occur on slopes that face all directions, others have found that the greater number of gullies are found on poleward facing slopes, especially from 30-44 S. Although many ideas have been put forward to explain them,http://www.psrd.hawaii.edu/Aug03/MartianGullies.html the most popular involve liquid water coming from an aquifer, from melting at the base of old glaciers, or from the melting of ice in the ground when the climate was warmer.Forget, F. et al. 2006. Planet Mars Story of Another World. Praxis Publishing. Chichester, UK. Because of the good possibility that liquid water was involved with their formation and that they could be very young, scientists are excited. Maybe the gullies are where we should go to find life. There is evidence for all three theories. Most of the gully alcove heads occur at the same level, just as one would expect of an aquifer. Various measurements and calculations show that liquid water could exist in aquifers at the usual depths where gullies begin. One variation of this model is that rising hot magma could have melted ice in the ground and caused water to flow in aquifers. Aquifers are layer that allow water to flow. They may consist of porous sandstone. The aquifer layer would be perched on top of another layer that prevents water from going down (in geological terms it would be called impermeable). Because water in an aquifer is prevented from going down, the only direction the trapped water can flow is horizontally. Eventually, water could flow out onto the surface when the aquifer reaches a break‚Äîlike a crater wall. The resulting flow of water could erode the wall to create gullies. Aquifers are quite common on Earth. A good example is \\"Weeping Rock\\" in Zion National Park Utah.Harris, A and E. Tuttle. 1990. Geology of National Parks. Kendall/Hunt Publishing Company. Dubuque, Iowa As for the next theory, much of the surface of Mars is covered by a thick smooth mantle that is thought to be a mixture of ice and dust. This ice-rich mantle, a few yards thick, smoothes the land, but in places it has a bumpy texture, resembling the surface of a basketball. The mantle may be like a glacier and under certain conditions the ice that is mixed in the mantle could melt and flow down the slopes and make gullies.NBC News Because there are few craters on this mantle, the mantle is relatively young. An excellent view of this mantle is shown below in the picture of the Ptolemaeus Crater Rim, as seen by HiRISE. The ice-rich mantle may be the result of climate changes.http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2008/03/080319-mars- gullies_2.html Changes in Mars's orbit and tilt cause significant changes in the distribution of water ice from polar regions down to latitudes equivalent to Texas. During certain climate periods water vapor leaves polar ice and enters the atmosphere. The water comes back to ground at lower latitudes as deposits of frost or snow mixed generously with dust. The atmosphere of Mars contains a great deal of fine dust particles. Water vapor will condense on the particles, then fall down to the ground due to the additional weight of the water coating. When Mars is at its greatest tilt or obliquity, up to 2 cm of ice could be removed from the summer ice cap and deposited at midlatitudes. This movement of water could last for several thousand years and create a snow layer of up to around 10 meters thick. When ice at the top of the mantling layer goes back into the atmosphere, it leaves behind dust, which insulating the remaining ice. Measurements of altitudes and slopes of gullies support the idea that snowpacks or glaciers are associated with gullies. Steeper slopes have more shade which would preserve snow. Higher elevations have far fewer gullies because ice would tend to sublimate more in the thin air of the higher altitude. The third theory might be possible since climate changes may be enough to simply allow ice in the ground to melt and thus form the gullies. During a warmer climate, the first few meters of ground could thaw and produce a \\"debris flow\\" similar to those on the dry and cold Greenland east coast. Since the gullies occur on steep slopes only a small decrease of the shear strength of the soil particles is needed to begin the flow. Small amounts of liquid water from melted ground ice could be enough.http://www.spaceref.com:16090/news/viewpr.html?pid=7124, Calculations show that a third of a mm of runoff can be produced each day for 50 days of each Martian year, even under current conditions. Image:ESP_025771variousgullies.jpgA variety of gullies originating at different levels are visible in this HiRISE image that was taken under the HiWish program. Image:25771gullybenches.jpgThis enlargement of a small part of the previous image shows terraces along a gully channel. The terraces were created when a new channel cut through the old surface. This means that the gully was not in a single event. Water must have flowed more than once in this location. Image:ESP_028290_2285gullies.jpgGullies in a crater.

Latitude dependent mantle Much of the surface of Mars is covered by a thick smooth mantle that is thought to be a mixture of ice and dust. This ice-rich mantle, a few yards thick, makes the surface look very smooth. Because there are few craters on this mantle, the mantle is relatively young. Changes in Mars's orbit and tilt cause significant changes in the distribution of water ice from polar regions down to latitudes equivalent to Texas. During certain climate periods water vapor leaves polar ice and enters the atmosphere. The water returns to the ground at lower latitudes as deposits of frost or snow mixed generously with dust. The atmosphere of Mars contains a great deal of fine dust particles. Water vapor condenses on the particles, and then they fall down to the ground due to the additional weight of the water coating. When ice at the top of the mantling layer goes back into the atmosphere, it leaves behind dust, which insulates the remaining ice.

Many of these channels probably carried water, at least for a time. The climate of Mars may have been such in the past that water ran on its surface. It has been known for some time that Mars undergoes many large changes in its tilt or obliquity because its two small moons lack the gravity to stabilize it, as our moon stabilizes Earth; at times the tilt of Mars has even been greater than 80 degrees Wikiperepelkin.jpgPerepelkin (Martian crater), as seen by CTX camera (on Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter).

They are hundreds of meters long, tens of meters high, and several meters wide. It is thought that impacts created fractures in the surface, these fractures later acted as channels for fluids. Fluids cemented the structures. With the passage of time, surrounding material was eroded away, thereby leaving hard ridges behind.

Parts of Tempe Terra, Arabia Terra, and Chryse Planitia are also in this quadrangle. This area contains many bright spots on a dark background that may be mud volcanoes. There are also some gullies that are believed to have formed by relatively recent flows of liquid water. Origin of name Mare Acidalium (Acidalian Sea) is the name of a telescopic albedo feature located at 45¬∞ N and 330¬∞ E on Mars. The feature was named for a well or fountain in Boeotia, Greece. According to classical tradition, it is a location where Venus and the Graces bathed.Blunck, J. 1982. Mars and its Satellites. Exposition Press. Smithtown, N.Y. The name was approved by the International Astronomical Union (IAU) in 1958.USGS Gazetteer of Planetary Nomenclature. Mars. http://planetarynames.wr.usgs.gov/.

Gullies occur on steep slopes, especially craters. Gullies are believed to be relatively young because they have few, if any craters, and they lie on top of sand dunes which are themselves young. Usually, each gully has an alcove, channel, and apron. Although many ideas have been put forward to explain them, the most popular involve liquid water either coming from an aquifer or left over from old glaciers.

Most of the gully alcove heads occur at the same level, just as one would expect of an aquifer. Various measurements and calculations show that liquid water could exist in an aquifer at the usual depths where the gullies begin. One variation of this model is that rising hot magma could have melted ice in the ground and caused water to flow in aquifers. Aquifers are layers that allow water to flow. They may consist of porous sandstone. This layer would be perched on top of another layer that prevents water from going down (in geological terms it would be called impermeable). The only direction the trapped water can flow is horizontally. The water could then flow out onto the surface when the aquifer reaches a break, like a crater wall. Aquifers are quite common on Earth. A good example is \\"Weeping Rock\\" in Zion National Park Utah.Harris, A and E. Tuttle. 1990. Geology of National Parks. Kendall/Hunt Publishing Company. Dubuque, Iowa On the other hand, there is evidence for the alternative theory because much of the surface of Mars is covered by a thick smooth mantle that is thought to be a mixture of ice and dust. This ice-rich mantle, a few yards thick, smoothes the land, but in places it has a bumpy texture, resembling the surface of a basketball. Under certain conditions the ice could melt and flow down the slopes to create gullies. Since there are few craters on this mantle, the mantle is relatively young. An excellent view of this mantle is in the picture of the Ptolemaeus Crater Rim, as seen by HiRISE. Changes in Mars's orbit and tilt cause significant changes in the distribution of water ice from polar regions down to latitudes equivalent to Texas. During certain climate periods water vapor leaves polar ice and enters the atmosphere. The water comes back to ground at lower latitudes as deposits of frost or snow mixed generously with dust. The atmosphere of Mars contains a great deal of fine dust particles. Water vapor condenses on the particles, then the heavier particles with the water coating fall and pile up on the ground. When ice at the top of the mantling layer goes back into the atmosphere, it leaves behind dust, which insulates the remaining ice.MLA NASA/Jet Propulsion Laboratory (2003, December 18).

Sublimation is the direct change of solid ice to a gas. This is similar to what happens to dry ice on the Earth. Places on Mars that display polygonal ground may indicate where future colonists can find water ice.

Craters Impact craters generally have a rim with ejecta around them, in contrast volcanic craters usually do not have a rim or ejecta deposits. Sometimes craters display layers. Since the collision that produces a crater is like a powerful explosion, rocks from deep underground are tossed unto the surface. Hence, craters can show us what lies deep under the surface.

It has been suggested that the spots are mud volcanoes.Grotzinger, J. and R. Milliken (eds.) 2012. Sedimentary Geology of Mars. SEPM More than 18,000 of these features, which have an average diameter of about 800 meters, have been mapped.Oehler, D. and C. Allen. 2010. Evidence for pervasive mud volcanism in Acidalia Planitia, Mars. Icarus: 208. 636-657. Mare Acidalium would have received large quantities of mud and fluids form outflow channels, so much mud may have accumulated there. The bright mounds have been found to contain crystalline ferric oxides. Mud volcanism here may be highly significant because long lived conduits for upwelling groundwater could have been produced. These could have been habitats for micro organisms.Komatsu, G., et al. 2014. ASTROBIOLOGICAL POTENTIAL OF MUD VOLCANISM ON MARS. 45th Lunar and Planetary Science Conference (2014). 1085.pdf Mud volcanoes could have brought up samples from deep zones that could therefore be sampled by robots. An article in Icarus reports on a study of these possible mud volcanoes. The authors compare these Martian features to mud volcanoes found on the Earth. There study using HiRISE images and CRISM data support the idea that these features are indeed mud volcanoes. Nanophase ferric minerals and hydrated minerals found with Compact Reconnaissance Imaging Spectrometer for Mars (CRISM) show that water was involved with the formation of these possible Martian mud volcanoes.Komatsu, G., et al. 2016.

Channels in Idaeus Fossae region There is a 300 km long river system in Idaeus Fossae. It is carved into the highlands of Idaeus Fossae, and it originated from the melting of ice in the ground after asteroid impacts. Dating has determined that the water activity came after most of the water activity ended at the boundary between the Noachian and Hesperian periods. Lakes and fan-shaped deposits were formed by running water in this system as it drained eastward into Liberta Crater and formed a delta deposit. Part of the drainage path is the Moa Valley.Salese, F., G. Di Achille, G. Ori. 2015.

Much evidence for this ocean has been gathered over several decades. New evidence was published in May 2016. A large team of scientists described how some of the surface in Ismenius Lacus quadrangle was altered by two Tsunamis. The tsunamis were caused by asteroids striking the ocean. Both were thought to have been strong enough to create 30 km diameter craters. The first tsunami picked up and carried boulders the size of cars or small houses. The backwash from the wave formed channels by rearranging the boulders. The second came in when the ocean was 300 m lower. The second carried a great deal of ice which was dropped in valleys. Calculations show that the average height of the waves would have been 50 m, but the heights would vary from 10 m to 120 m. Numerical simulations show that in this particular part of the ocean two impact craters of the size of 30 km in diameter would form every 30 million years. The implication here is that a great northern ocean may have existed for millions of years. One argument against an ocean has been the lack of shoreline features. These features may have been washed away by these tsunami events. The parts of Mars studied in this research are Chryse Planitia and northwestern Arabia Terra. These tsunamis affected some surfaces in the Ismenius Lacus quadrangle and in the Mare Acidalium quadrangle. Pingos Pingos are believed to be present on Mars. They are mounds that contain cracks. These particular fractures were evidently produced by something emerging from below the brittle surface of Mars. Ice lenses, resulting from the accumulation of ice beneath the surface, possibly created these mounds with fractures. Ice is less dense than rock, so the buried ice rose and pushed upwards on the surface and generated these cracks. An analogous process creates similar sized mounds in arctic tundra on Earth that are known as pingos, an Inuit word.http://www.uahirise.org/ESP_046359_1250 They contain pure water ice, so they would be a great source of water for future colonists on Mars. 44322 2215pingos.jpgArrows point to possible pingos, as seen by HiRISE under HiWish program Pingos contain a core of pure ice.

Volcanoes, wind, or water can produce layershttp://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu?PSP_008437_1750 Layers can be hardened by the action of groundwater. Martian ground water probably moved hundreds of kilometers, and in the process it dissolved many minerals from the rock it passed through. When ground water surfaces in low areas containing sediments, water evaporates in the thin atmosphere and leaves behind minerals as deposits and/or cementing agents. Consequently, layers of dust could not later easily erode away since they were cemented together. , ESP 047080 2120layered mesa.jpgLayers in mesa, as seen by HiRISE under HiWish program 47080 2120layersclose.jpgClose view of layers in mesa, as seen by HiRISE under HiWish program ESP 048924 2150layers.jpgLayers and small craters, as seen by HiRISE under HiWish program Layers are enlarged in next image. 48924 2150layers.jpgLayers, as seen by HiRISE under HiWish program File:53490 2230layers.jpgClose view of layers in a trough, as seen by HiRISE under HiWish program File:ESP 054477 2150mesa.jpgLayered mesa, as seen by HiRISE under HiWish program  Other landscape features in Mare Acidalium quadrangle  Image:Cliff in Mare Acidalium.JPGCliff in Kasei Valles system, as seen by HiRISE.

He was commonly known under his second forename and was sometimes nicknamed Freddy Leveson. Early life Leveson-Gower was the second surviving son of Granville Leveson-Gower, 1st Earl Granville and his wife Lady Harriet Elizabeth Cavendish, second daughter of William Cavendish, 5th Duke of Devonshire. He spent his early childhood, first in his father's residence at Wherstead, and when his father had become ambassador in France in 1824, at the British embassy in Paris, where he was a playmate of Henri, comte de Chambord. Aged eight, he was sent back to England on a school in Brighton, after which he entered Eton College. Leveson-Gower left the latter in 1835 and was privately educated for the next two years, until he went on Christ Church, Oxford in 1837. He graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in 1840 and a Master of Arts four years later. Career After his Grand Tour, he was then called to the bar by the Inner Temple in 1845, practising in the Oxford circuit. Leveson-Gower entered the British House of Commons for Derby with the support of his uncle William Cavendish, 6th Duke of Devonshire in May 1847. However, the election was overturned on petition in July and Leveson-Gower did not stand in the by-election. From 1851, he worked as pr√©cis writer in the Foreign Office until the following year, when by the influence of his cousin George Sutherland-Leveson-Gower, 2nd Duke of Sutherland, he stood successfully as a Member of Parliament (MP) for Stoke-upon-Trent. In 1856, Leveson-Gower joined his brother Granville on a special mission to Russia. He lost his seat, however, in the general election of 1857. Two years later, he was returned for Bodmin and represented the constituency until his retirement from politics in 1885. Leveson-Gower was a Justice of the Peace for Surrey and served as a Deputy Lieutenant for the county. Personal life Having travelled to India in 1850, Leveson-Gower, after his return, married Lady Margaret Compton, daughter of Spencer Compton, 2nd Marquess of Northampton, on 1 June 1851. She died only a few years later. Their only son: * George Granville Leveson-Gower (1858‚Äì1951), who later in the Parliament of the United Kingdom for North West Staffordshire and also for Stoke-upon-Trent. He married the Hon. Adelaide Violet Cicely Monson, daughter of Debonnaire John Monson, 8th Baron Monson. He died in 1907, aged 88, having been in his later life a friend of William Ewart Gladstone and his wife.

The Arabia quadrangle is one of a series of 30 quadrangle maps of Mars used by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) Astrogeology Research Program. The Arabia quadrangle is also referred to as MC-12 (Mars Chart-12).Davies, M.E.; Batson, R.M.; Wu, S.S.C. \\"Geodesy and Cartography\\" in Kieffer, H.H.; Jakosky, B.M.; Snyder, C.W.; Matthews, M.S., Eds. Mars. University of Arizona Press: Tucson, 1992. The quadrangle contains part of the classic area of Mars known as Arabia. It also contains a part of Terra Sabaea and a small part of Meridiani Planum. It lies on the boundary between the young northern plains and the old southern highlands. The quadrangle covers the area from 315¬∞ to 360¬∞ west longitude and 0¬∞ to 30¬∞ north latitude.  Description  The surface of the Arabia quadrangle appears to be very old because it has a high density of craters, but it is not near as high in elevation as typical old surfaces. On Mars the oldest areas contain the most craters; the oldest period is called Noachian after the quadrangle Noachis. The Arabia area contains many buttes and ridges. Some believe that during certain climate changes an ice-dust layer was deposited; later, parts were eroded to form buttes. Some outflow channels are found in Arabia, namely Naktong Vallis, Locras Valles, Indus Vallis, Scamander Vallis, and Cusus Valles.U.S. Department of the Interior U.S. Geological Survey, Topographic Map of the Eastern Region of Mars M 15M 0/270 2AT, 1991  Layers  Many places in Arabia are shaped into layers.Grotzinger, J. and R. Milliken (eds.) 2012. Sedimentary Geology of Mars. SEPM The layers can be a few meters thick or tens of meters thick. Recent research on these layers by scientists at California Institute of Technology (Caltech) suggest that ancient climate change on Mars caused by regular variation in the planet's tilt, or obliquity may have caused the patterns in the layers. On Earth, similar changes (astronomical forcing) of climate results in ice-age cycles. A recent study of layers in craters in western Arabia revealed much about the history of the layers. Although the craters in this study are just outside the boundary for the Arabia quadrangle the findings would probably apply to the Arabia quadrangle as well. The thickness of each layer may average less than 4 meters in one crater, but 20 meters in another. The pattern of layers measured in Becquerel crater, suggests that each layer was formed over a period of about 100,000 years. Moreover, every 10 layers were bundled together into larger units. The 10-layer pattern is repeated at least 10 times. So every 10-layer pattern took one-million years to form. The tilt of the Earth's axis changes by only a little more than 2 degrees; it is stabilized by the relatively large mass of our moon. In contrast Mars's tilt varies by tens of degrees. When the tilt (or obliquity) is low, the poles are the coldest places on the planet, while the equator is the warmest‚Äîas on Earth. This causes gases in the atmosphere, like water and carbon dioxide, to migrate pole ward, where they freeze. When the obliquity is higher, the poles receive more sunlight, causing those materials to migrate away. When carbon dioxide moves from the poles, the atmospheric pressure increases, maybe causing a difference in the ability of winds to transport and deposit sand. Also, with more water in the atmosphere sand grains may stick and cement together to form layers. This study of the thickness of layers was done using stereo topographic maps obtained by processing data from the high-resolution camera onboard NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. Recent research leads scientists to believe that some of the craters in Arabia may have held huge lakes. Cassini Crater and Tikonravov Crater probably once were full of water since their rims seem to have been breached by water. Both inflow and outflow channels have been observed on their rims. Each of these lakes would have contained more water than Earth's Lake Baikal, our largest freshwater lake by volume. The watersheds for lakes in Arabia seem to be too small to gather enough water by precipitation alone; therefore it is thought that much of their water came from groundwater.Fassett, C. and J. Head III. 2008. Valley network-fed, open- basin lakes on Mars: Distribution and implications for Noachian surface and subsurface hydrology. Icarus: 198. 39‚Äì56. Another group of researchers proposed groundwater with dissolved minerals came to the surface, in and later around craters, and helped to form layers by adding minerals (especially sulfate) and cementing sediments. Upon close examination, Arabia layers appear to have a slight tilt. This tilt supports formation with the action of a rising water table. A water table generally follows the topography. Since the layers slope slightly down toward the northwest, the layers may have been created by groundwater, rather than a single large sea that has been suggested. This hypothesis is supported by a groundwater model and by sulfates discovered in a wide area. At first, by examining surface materials with Opportunity Rover, scientists discovered that groundwater had repeatedly risen and deposited sulfates. Later studies with instruments on board the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter showed that the same kinds of materials exist in a large area that included Arabia.M. Wiseman, J. C. Andrews-Hanna, R. E.

These are accepted as being formed, at least in part, by water deposition. Since Mars contains similar layers, water remains as a major cause of layering on Mars.

Much of the surface of Mars is dark because of extensive flows of the dark lave rock basalt. Studies with spectroscopes from orbit have shown that many light-toned areas contain hydrated minerals, and/or clay minerals.Weitz, C. et al. 2017. LIGHT-TONED MATERIALS OF MELAS CHASMA: EVIDENCE FOR THEIR FORMATION ON MARS. Lunar and Planetary Science XLVIII (2017) 2794.pdf That means that water was once there in order to produce these substances. In short, light-toned materials are markers for the past presence of water.

As craters get larger (greater than 10 km in diameter) they usually have a central peak. The peak is caused by a rebound of the crater floor following the impact. Sometimes craters display layers. Since the collision that produces a crater is like a powerful explosion, rocks from deep underground are tossed unto the surface. Hence, craters can show us what lies deep under the surface. Some craters in Arabia are classified as pedestal craters. A pedestal crater is a crater with its ejecta sitting above the surrounding terrain and thereby forming a raised platform. They form when an impact crater ejects material which forms an erosion resistant layer, thus protecting the immediate area from erosion. As a result of this hard covering, the crater and its ejecta become elevated, as erosion removes the softer material beyond the ejecta.http://hirise.lpl.eduPSP_008508_1870 Some pedestals have been accurately measured to be hundreds of meters above the surrounding area. This means that hundreds of meters of material were eroded away. Pedestal craters were first observed during the Mariner missions.Bleacher, J. and S. Sakimoto. Pedestal Craters, A Tool For Interpreting Geological Histories and Estimating Erosion Rates. LPSC Researchers believe over 200 new craters are formed each year on Mars, based on study of years of HiRISE images. Image:Layers in a crater in Arabia.JPGPedestal craters and layers in Tikonravev Crater in Arabia, as seen by Mars Global Surveyor (MGS) with the Mars Orbiter Camera, under the MOC Public Targeting Program. Layers may form from volcanoes, the wind, or by deposition under water. Some researchers believe this crater once held a massive lake. Image:Pedestal crater3.jpgPedestal craters form when the ejecta from impacts protect the underlying material from erosion. As a result of this process, craters appear perched above their surroundings. Image:Pedestaldrawingcolor2.jpgDrawing shows a later idea of how some pedestal craters form. In this way of thinking, an impacting projectile goes into an ice-rich layer‚Äîbut no further. Heat and wind from the impact hardens the surface against erosion. This hardening can be accomplished by the melting of ice which produces a salt/mineral solution thereby cementing the surface.

Changing back to the surrounding albedo takes on average 15 martian years.Daubar, I., C. Dundas, S. Byrne, P. Geissler, G. Bart, A. McEwen, P. Russell, M. Chojnacki, M. Golombek 2016.

File:55252 1385brains.jpgBrain terrain on floor of crater, as seen by HiRISE under HiWish program  Possible methane  One study with the Planetary Fourier Spectrometer in the Mars Express spacecraft found possible methane in three areas of Mars, one of which was in Arabia. One possible source of methane is from the metabolism of living bacteria.Allen, C., D. Oehler, and E. Venechuk. Prospecting for Methane in Arabia Terra, Mars ‚Äì First Results. Lunar and Planetary Science XXXVII (2006). 1193.pdf-1193.pdf. However, a recent study indicates that to match the observations of methane, there must be something that quickly destroys the gas, otherwise it would be spread all through the atmosphere instead of being concentrated in just a few locations. There may be something in the soil that oxidizes the gas before it has a chance to spread. If this is so, that same chemical would destroy organic compounds, thus life would be very difficult on Mars. Deformation bands The Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter showed deformation bands in Capen Crater, located in the Arabia quadrangle. Deformation bands are small faults with very small displacements.DOI.org They often proceed large faults. They develop in porous rocks, like sandstone. They can restrict and/or change the flow of fluids like water and oil. They are common in the Colorado Plateau. Good examples form in the Entrada Sandstone in the San Rafael Swell in Utah.Schultz, R. 2009. Fractures and Deformation Bands in Rock: A Field Guide and Journey into Geologic Fracture Mechanics. Oxford University Press The bands represent failure by localized frictional sliding.Schultz, R. and R. Siddharthan. 2005. A general framework for the occurrence and faulting of deformation bands in porous granular rocks. Tectonophysics: 411. 1‚Äì18. The bands on Mars are a few meters wide and up to a few kilometers long. They are caused by the compression or stretching of underground layers. Erosion of overlying layers make them visible at the surface. Capen Crater was unnamed before the discovery of deformation bands. It was named for Charles Capen, who studied Mars at JPL's Table Mountain Observatory in California and at Lowell Observatory in Arizona. Image:Deformation Bands on Mars.jpgThe group of lines running up and down in the image are believed to be deformation bands. They can be thought of as small faults.  Geological history  Recent studies, reported in the journal Icarus, have suggested that the area underwent several phases in its formation: * A large basin, maybe from an impact, was produced early in Martian history. It was so early that Mars still had a magnetic field generated by movements in a liquid core. Present day Arabia possesses a remnant magnetism from that ancient era. *Sediments flowed into the basin. Water entered the basin. *Because Tharsis, on the other side of Mars, became so massive, the area around Arabia was pushed out. As it bulged upward, there was increased erosion which exposed old layers. When portions of a planet that can be subject to erosion rise, there is greatly increased erosion; Earth's Grand Canyon became very deep because it was eroded into a high plateau. *Over the following 4 billion years, the area was modified by various geological processes. Central peaks and ejecta shapes indicate that parts of Arabia are still water enriched.Hartmann, W. 2003. A Traveler's Guide to Mars. Workman Publishing. NY NY.Dohm, J. et al. 2007. Possible ancient giant basin and related water enrichment in the Arabia Terra province, Mars. Icarus: 190. 74‚Äì92.Edgett, K. and M. Malin. 2002. Martian sedimentary rock stratigraphy: Outcrops and interbedded craters of northwest Sinus Meridiani and southwest Arabia Terra. Geophysical Research Letters: 29. 32. Dark slope streaks Streaks are common on Mars. They occur on steep slopes of craters, troughs, and valleys. The streaks are dark at first. They get lighter with age. Sometimes they start in a tiny spot, then spread out and go for hundreds of meters. They have been seen to travel around obstacles, like boulders. It is believed that they are avalanches of bright dust that expose a darker underlying layer. However, several ideas have been advanced to explain them. Some involve water or even the growth of organisms. Streaks appear in areas covered with dust. Much of the Martian surface is covered with dust. Fine dust settles out of the atmosphere covering everything. We know a lot about this dust because the solar panels of the Mars Rovers get covered with dust, thus reducing the electrical energy. The power of the Rovers has been restored many times by the wind, in the form of dust devils, cleaning the panels and boosting the power. So, we know that dust settles from the atmosphere then returns over and over. Dust storms are frequent, especially when the spring season begins in the southern hemisphere. At that time, Mars is 40% closer to the sun. The orbit of Mars is much more elliptical then the Earth's. That is the difference between the farthest point from the sun and the closest point to the sun is very great for Mars, but only a slight amount for the Earth. Also, every few years, the entire planet is engulfed in global dust storms. When NASA's Mariner 9 craft arrived there, nothing could be seen through the dust storm. Other global dust storms have also been observed, since that time. Research, published in January 2012 in Icarus, found that dark streaks were initiated by airblasts from meteorites traveling at supersonic speeds. The team of scientists was led by Kaylan Burleigh, an undergraduate at the University of Arizona. After counting some 65,000 dark streaks around the impact site of a group of 5 new craters, patterns emerged. The number of streaks was greatest closer to the impact site. So, the impact somehow probably caused the streaks. Also, the distribution of the streaks formed a pattern with two wings extending from the impact site. The curved wings resembled scimitars, curved knives. This pattern suggests that an interaction of airblasts from the group of meteorites shook dust loose enough to start dust avalanches that formed the many dark streaks. At first it was thought that the shaking of the ground from the impact caused the dust avalanches, but if that was the case the dark streaks would have been arranged symmetrically around the impacts, rather than being concentrated into curved shapes.

Dark slope streaks can be caused by nearby impacts, as seen in the following HiRISE image of a new small impact that set off a slope streak.

Linear ridge networks Linear ridge networks are found in various places on Mars in and around craters.Head, J., J. Mustard. 2006. Breccia dikes and crater-related faults in impact craters on Mars: Erosion and exposure on the floor of a crater 75 km in diameter at the dichotomy boundary, Meteorit. Planet Science: 41, 1675-1690. Ridges often appear as mostly straight segments that intersect in a lattice-like manner. They are hundreds of meters long, tens of meters high, and several meters wide. It is thought that impacts created fractures in the surface, these fractures later acted as channels for fluids. Fluids cemented the structures. With the passage of time, surrounding material was eroded away, thereby leaving hard ridges behind. Since the ridges occur in locations with clay, these formations could serve as a marker for clay which requires water for its formation.Mustard et al., 2007. Mineralogy of the Nili Fossae region with OMEGA/Mars Express data: 1. Ancient impact melt in the Isidis Basin and implications for the transition from the Noachian to Hesperian, J. Geophys. Res., 112. Water here could have supported past life in these locations. Clay may also preserve fossils or other traces of past life.

The central part contains Syrtis Major Planum. The east includes Isidis basin and the west and north includes heavily cratered highlands. The Syrtis Major quadrangle is one of a series of 30 quadrangle maps of Mars used by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) Astrogeology Research Program. The Syrtis Major quadrangle is also referred to as MC-13 (Mars Chart-13).Davies, M.E.; Batson, R.M.; Wu, S.S.C. \\"Geodesy and Cartography\\" in Kieffer, H.H.; Jakosky, B.M.; Snyder, C.W.; Matthews, M.S., Eds. Mars. University of Arizona Press: Tucson, 1992. The quadrangle covers longitudes 270¬∞ to 315¬∞ west and latitudes 0¬∞ to 30¬∞ north on Mars. Syrtis Major quadrangle includes Syrtis Major Planum and parts of Terra Sabaea and Isidis Planitia. Syrtis Major is an old shield volcano with a central depression that is elongated in a north-south direction. It contains the calderas Meroe Patera and Nili Patera.http://www.daviddarling.info/encyclopedia/S/SyrtisMajor.html Interesting features in the area include dikes and inverted terrain. The Beagle 2 lander was about to land near the quadrangle, particularly in the eastern part of Isidis Planitia, in December 2003, when contact with the craft was lost. In January 2015, NASA reported the Beagle 2 had been found on the surface in Isidis Planitia (location is about ). High-resolution images captured by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter identified the lost probe, which appears to be intact. (see discovery images here) In November 2018, NASA announced that Jezero crater was chosen as the landing site for the planned Mars 2020 rover mission. Jezero crater is in the Syrtis Major quadrangle at (at ) Discovery and name The name Syrtis Major is derived from the classical Roman name Syrtis maior for the Gulf of Sidra on the coast of Libya (classical Cyrenaica). It is near Cyrene which is the place where \\"Simon\\" who carried the cross of Jesus was from.https://ferrelljenkins.wordpress.com/2011/03/30/libya-and-the- bible-%E2%80%94-more-than-you- think/https://books.google.com/books?id=3JNQAQAAMAAJ&pg;=PA18 The Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges, Volume 59Gleig, G. and T. Stackhouse. A History of the holy Bible, corrected and improved. https://books.google.com/books?id=jVIOAAAAQAAJ&pg;=PA286 Syrtis Major was the first documented surface feature of another planet. It was discovered by Christiaan Huygens, who included it in a drawing of Mars in 1659. The feature was originally known as the Hourglass Sea but has been given different names by different cartographers. In 1840, Johann Heinrich von M√§dler compiled a map of Mars from his observations and called the feature Atlantic Canale. In Richard Proctor's 1867 map it is called then Kaiser Sea (after Frederik Kaiser of the Leiden Observatory). Camille Flammarion called it the Mer du Sablier (French for \\"Hourglass Sea\\") when he revised Proctor's nomenclature in 1876. The name \\"Syrtis Major\\" was chosen by Giovanni Schiaparelli when he created a map based on observations made during Mars' close approach to Earth in 1877.  Igneous rocks  Syrtis Major is of great interest to geologists because several types of igneous rocks have been found there with orbiting spacecraft. Besides basalt, dacite and granite have been found there. Dacite originates under volcanoes in magma chambers. Dacites form at the top of the chamber, after heavy minerals (olivine and pyroxene) containing iron and magnesium have settled to the bottom. Granite is formed by an even more complex process.Christensen, P. 2005. \\"The Many Faces of Mars\\". Scientific American. July, 2005. Some areas of Syrtis Major contain large amounts of the mineral olivine. Olivine turns into other minerals very rapidly in the presence of water, so a high abundance of olivine suggests that for a long time little water has been there.http://www.marsdaily.com/news-odyssey-05a.html Minerals A variety of important minerals have been discovered near Nili Fossae, a major trough system in Syrtis major. Besides a large exposure of olivine located in Nili Fossae. Other minerals found there include carbonates, aluminum smectite, iron/magnesium smectite, hydrated silica, kaolinite group minerals, and iron oxides.\\"Nasa finds 'missing' Mars mineral\\"Murchie, S. et al. 2009. \\"A synthesis of Martian aqueous mineralogy after 1 Mars year of observations from the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter\\".

Later research published in October 2010, described a large deposit of carbonate rocks found inside Leighton Crater at a level that was once buried 4 miles (6 km) below the surface. Finding carbonates in an underground location strongly suggests that Mars was warmer and had more atmospheric carbon dioxide and ancient seas. Because the carbonates were near silicate minerals and clays hydrothermal systems like the deep sea vents on Earth may have been present.http://www.astrobio.net/pressrelease/3646/exposed-rocks-point-to water-on-ancient-mars1.Adrian J.

Earth and Planetary Science Letters, 2010; Other minerals found by the MRO are aluminum smectite, iron/magnesium smectite, hydrated silica, kaolinite group minerals, iron oxides, and talc. NASA scientists discovered that Nili Fossae is the source of plumes of methane, raising the question of whether this source originates from biological sources.Mars Methane Found, Raising Possibility of LifeNew light on Mars methane mystery Research published in the fall of 2010, describes the discovery of hydrated silica on the flanks of a volcanic cone. The deposit was from a steam fumarole or hot spring, and it represents a recent habitable microenvironment. The cone rests on the floor of Nili Patera. Observations were obtained with NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter.http://www.spaceref.com/news/viewpr.html?pid=31980  Dikes  Narrow ridges occur in some places on Mars. They may be formed by different means, but some are probably caused by molten rock moving underground, cooling into hard rock, then being exposed by the erosion of softer, surrounding materials. Such a feature is termed a dike. They are common on Earth‚Äîsome famous ones are Shiprock, New Mexico;http://www.msss.com/mars_images/moc/2005/10/13/ around Spanish Peaks, Colorado; and the \\"Iron Dike\\" in Rocky Mountain National Park, Colorado. Image:Dikes-large.jpgDikes near Shiprock, New Mexico Image:WestSpanishPeakCO.jpgWestSpanishPeak, CO The discovery on Mars of dikes that were formed from molten rock is highly significant because dikes indicate the existence of intrusive igneous activity. On the Earth such activity is associated with precious metals like gold, silver, and tellurium.http://ccvgoldmining.com/Geology/geology.html Dikes and other intrusive structures are common in the Cripple Creek Mining District of Colorado; the Battle Mountain-Eureka area in north-central Nevada, famous for gold and molybdenum deposits;http://www.mirandagold.com/s/Coal/Canyon.asp and around the Franklin dike swarm in Canada. Mapping the presence of dikes allows us to understand how magma (molten rock under the ground) travels and where it could have interacted with surrounding rock, thus producing valuable ores. Deposits of important minerals are also made by dikes and other igneous intrusions heating water which then dissolves minerals that are deposited in cracks in nearby rock.Namowitz, S. and D. Stone. 1975. Earth Science-The World We Live In. American Book Company. Ny, NY One would expect a great deal of intrusive igneous activity to occur on Mars because it is believed there is more igneous activity under the ground than on top, and Mars has many huge volcanoes.Crisp, J. 1984. \\"Rates of magma emplacement and volcanic output\\".

Knobs and mesas were probably formed from the erosion of deposits in an old crater. Image:Dike in Syrtis Major.JPGPossible dike from HiRISE under the HiWish program Linear ridge networks Some crater floors in the Syrtis Major area show elongated ridges in a lattice-like pattern. Such patterns are typical of faults and breccia dikes formed as a result of an impact. Some have suggested that these linear ridge networks are dikes made up of molten rock; others have advanced the idea that other fluids such as water were involved.Saper, L., J. Mustard. 2013. \\"Extensive linear ridge networks in Nili Fossae and Nilosyrtis, Mars: implications for fluid flow in the ancient crust\\". Geophysical Research Letters: 40, 245-249. The ridges are found where there has been enhanced erosion. Pictures below show examples of these dikes. Water may flow along faults. The water often carries minerals that serve to cement rock materials thus making them harder. Later when the whole area undergoes erosion the dikes will remain as ridges because they are more resistant to erosion.http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/PSP_008189_2080 This discovery may be of great importance for future colonization of Mars because these types of faults and breccia dikes on earth are associated with key mineral resources.http://news.discovery.com/space/mars-prospecting-ores-gold.htmlWest, M. and J.

Buttes are formed when most of a layer(s) of rocks are removed from an area. Buttes usually have a hard, erosion resistant cap rock on the top. The cap rock causes the top of a butte to be flat. An example of a butte in the Syrtis Major quadrangle is shown below. Image:Wikiauquakuh.JPGAuqakuh Vallis. At one time a dark layer covered the whole area, now only a few pieces remain as buttes. Image was taken with THEMIS.  Dunes  Sand dunes are found all over Mars. Often sand dunes will form in low areas, for example on the floor of ancient river valleys. Dunes on the floor of Arnus Vallis, an old river valley are visible in a picture below. Dunes in valleys on Mars usually lie at right angles to the valley walls.

For many years, astronomers observing regular changes on Mars when the seasons changed, thought that what they saw was evidence of vegetation growing. After close-up inspection with a number of spacecraft, other causes were discovered. Basically, the changes are caused by the effects of the wind blowing dust around. Sometimes, fine bright dust settles on the dark basalt rock making the surface appear lighter, at other times the light-toned dust will be blown away; thus making the surface darken‚Äîjust as if vegetation were growing. Mars has frequent regional or global dust storms that coat the surface with fine bright dust. In the THEMIS image below, white streaks are seen downwind of craters. The streaks are not too bright; they appear bright because of contrast with the dark volcanic rock basalt which makes up the surface.http://themis.asu.edu/zoom-20020606a Image:Bright Streaks in Syrtis Major.JPGBright Streaks in Syrtis Major caused by the wind, as seen by THEMIS. File:ESP 053576 1990lightstreak.jpgLight-toned streak on the lee ward side of a crater, as seen by HiRISE under HiWish program  Inverted relief  Some places on Mars show inverted relief. In these locations, a stream bed may be a raised feature, instead of a valley. The inverted former stream channels may be caused by the deposition of large rocks or due to cementation. In either case erosion would erode the surrounding land and leave the old channel as a raised ridge because the ridge would be more resistant to erosion. Images below, taken with HiRISE show sinuous ridges that are old channels that have become inverted.http://hiroc.lpl.arizona.edu/images/PSP/diafotizo.php?ID=PSP_002279_1735 Image:Antoniadi Crater Stream Channels.JPGInverted Stream Channels in Antoniadi Crater, as seen by HiRISE Image:Inverted Channel 012435.jpgInverted Channel with many branches in Syrtis Major quadrangle File:ESP 057453 2050ridges.jpgPossible inverted streams, as seen by HiRISE under HiWish program  Methane  For several years, researchers have found methane in the atmosphere of Mars. After study, it was determined to be coming from a point in Syrtis Major, located at 10¬∞ N and 50¬∞ E.http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/mars-methane-gas-disappears- quickly-100920.html A recent study indicates that to match the observations of methane, there must be something that quickly destroys the gas, otherwise it would be spread all through the atmosphere instead of being concentrated in one location. There may be something in the soil that oxidizes the gas before it has a chance to spread. If this is so, that same chemical would destroy organic compounds, thus life would be very difficult on Mars.http://www.spaceref.com:80/news/viewpr.html?pid=28914 Layers Many places on Mars show rocks arranged in layers. Rock can form layers in a variety of ways. Volcanoes, wind, or water can produce layers. A detailed discussion of layering with many Martian examples can be found in Sedimentary Geology of Mars.Grotzinger, J. and R. Milliken (eds.). 2012. Sedimentary Geology of Mars. SEPM.

The southern part includes heavily cratered highlands; the northern part contains Elysium Planitia; and, the eastern half includes Isidis basin. The Amenthes quadrangle is one of a series of 30 quadrangle maps of Mars used by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) Astrogeology Research Program. The Amenthes quadrangle is also referred to as MC-14 (Mars Chart-14).Davies, M.E.; Batson, R.M.; Wu, S.S.C. ‚ÄúGeodesy and Cartography‚Äù in Kieffer, H.H.; Jakosky, B.M.; Snyder, C.W.; Matthews, M.S., Eds. Mars. University of Arizona Press: Tucson, 1992. The quadrangle covers the area from 225¬∞ to 270¬∞ west longitude and from 0¬∞ to 30¬∞ north latitude on Mars. Amenthes quadrangle contains parts of Utopia Planitia, Isidis Planitia, Terra Cimmeria, and Tyrrhena Terra. The name Amenthes is the Egyptian word for the place where the souls of the dead go.Blunck, J. 1982. Mars and its Satellites. Exposition Press. Smithtown, N.Y. This quadrangle contains the Isidis basin, a location where magnesium carbonate was found by MRO. This mineral indicates that water was present and that it was not acidic. There are Dark slope streaks, troughs (fossae), and river valleys (Vallis) in this quadrangle. The Beagle 2 lander was about to land in the quadrangle, particularly in the eastern part of Isidis Planitia, in December 2003, when contact with the craft was lost. In January 2015, NASA reported the Beagle 2 had been found on the surface in Isidis Planitia (location is about ). High- resolution images captured by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter identified the lost probe, which appears to be intact. (see discovery images here)  Craters  Some craters in the Amenthes region (as well as other parts of Mars) show ejecta around them that have lobes. It is believed that the lobed shape is caused by an impact into water or ice logged ground. Calculations suggest that ice is stable beneath the Martian surface. At the equator the stable layer of ice might lie under as much as 1 kilometer of material, but at higher latitudes the ice may be just a few centimeters below the surface. This was proven when the landing rockets on the Phoenix lander blew away surface dust to reveal an ice surface.http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/phoenix/news/phoenix-20080531.htmlhttp://www.nasa.gov/centers/ames/news/releases/2008/08_108AR_prt.html The larger an impact crater, the deeper its penetration, a large crater is more likely to have a lobate ejecta since it went down to the ice layer. When even small craters have lobes, the ice level is close to the surface.http://sci.esa.int/science-e/www/object/index.cfm?fobjectid=31026 This idea would be very important for future colonists on Mars who would like to live near a source of water. Impact craters generally have a rim with ejecta around them, in contrast volcanic craters usually do not have a rim or ejecta deposits. Sometimes craters will display layers. Since the collision that produces a crater is like a powerful explosion, rocks from deep underground are tossed unto the surface. Hence, craters can show us what lies deep under the surface. One crater in the Amenthes quadrangle is believed to be a source of nakhlite meteorites. A team of researchers found that these particular meteorites came from four different eruptions of lava because they showed different ages. The ages were measured by comparing isotopes of the element Argon. Since the ages vary from 93 to 1322 million years, the authors concluded that volcanoes grow much more slowly on Mars than the Earth. Many of the volcanoes on the Earth grow much quicker, as they form at plate boundaries. In contrast, Martian volcanoes probably form from plumes.Cohen, B., et al. 2017.

History The school's predecessor was established in 1912 as Smith Hall School, near the same site; at the time, Walnut Hill Lane was known as Six Mile Road. About 1916, the school districts of Smith Hall and nearby Elms Springs merged, after which local landowner Albert Latham -- whose property included a farm and walnut grove on the northwest corner of Midway and Six Mile Road -- offered the new district 10 acres of land in exchange for naming the new school Walnut Hill School. Thomas E. Henry, previously Dallas County Superintendent of Public Schools, served as an early principal for the new grade school.(No author.) \\"$4,250 raised for Liberty loan bonds at county rally,\\" The Dallas Morning News, page 1.

A second and third additions were added simultaneously in 1956. They included a primary art room and an upper elementary art room and a full gymnasium. In 1999 the school was named a National Blue Ribbon school. In 2005 it had a larger attendance boundary.\\"Walnut Hill Elementary Attendance Zone.\\" (2005) Dallas independent school District.

They also found that the younger southeast regions are geochemically different from the older regions, and that these differences related to igneous processes, not secondary processes like the interaction of water or ice with the surface of Elysium in the past. \\"We determined that while there might have been water in this area in the past, the geochemical properties in the top meter throughout this volcanic province are indicative of igneous processes,\\" Susko said. \\"We think levels of thorium and potassium here were depleted over time because of volcanic eruptions over billions of years. The radioactive elements were the first to go in the early eruptions. We are seeing changes in the mantle chemistry over time.\\" \\"Long- lived volcanic systems with changing magma compositions are common on Earth, but an emerging story on Mars,\\" said James Wray, study co-author and associate professor in the School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences at Georgia Tech. Overall, these findings indicate that Mars is a much more geologically complex body than originally thought, perhaps due to various loading effects on the mantle caused by the weight of giant volcanoes. For decades, we saw Mars, as a lifeless rock, full of craters with a number of long inactive volcanoes. We had a very simple view of the red planet. Finding a variety of igneous rocks demonstrates that Mars has the potential for useful resource utilization and a capacity to sustain a human population on Mars. \\"It's much easier to survive on a complex planetary body bearing the mineral products of complex geology than on a simpler body like the moon or asteroids.\\"David Susko, Suniti Karunatillake, Gayantha Kodikara, J.

ScienceDaily, 24 February 2017. . Much of the area near the volcanoes is covered with lava flows, some can even be shown approaching, then stopping upon reaching higher ground. (See pictures below for examples) Sometimes when lava flows the top cools quickly into a solid crust. However, the lava below often still flows, this action breaks up the top layer making it very rough. Such rough flow is called aa. Research, published in January 2010, described the discovery of a vast single lava flow, the size of the state of Oregon, that \\"was put in place turbulently over the span of several weeks at most.\\"http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/features.cfm?feature=2438 This flow, near Athabasca Valles, is the youngest lava flow on Mars. It is thought to be of Late Amazonian Age.Jaeger, W. et al. 2010. Emplacement of the youngest flood lava on Mars: A short, turbulent story. Icarus: 205. 230-243. Other researchers disagree with this idea. Under Martian conditions lava should not stay fluid very long. Some areas in the Elysium quadrangle are geological young and have surfaces that are hard to explain. Some have called them Platy- Ridged-Polygonized terrain. The surface has been suggested to be from pack ice, basalt lava, or a muddy flow. Using HiRISE images the heights of the ridges of the surface were measured. Most were less than 2 meters. This is far smaller than what is expected from lava flows. The high resolution photos demonstrated that the material seemed to flow which would not occur with pack ice. So, the researchers concluded that muddy flows cover the surface.Yue, Z., et al. 2017.

Layers  The Elysium Fossae contain layers, also called strata. Many places on Mars show rocks arranged in layers. Sometimes the layers are of different colors. Light-toned rocks on Mars have been associated with hydrated minerals like sulfates. The Mars Rover Opportunity examined such layers close-up with several instruments. Pictures taken from orbiting spacecraft show that some layers of rocks seem to break up into fine dust; consequently these rocks are probably composed of small particles. Other layers break up into large boulders, so they are probably much harder. Basalt, a volcanic rock, is thought comprise the layers that form boulders. Basalt has been identified on Mars in many places. Instruments on orbiting spacecraft have detected clay (also called phyllosilicates) in some layers. Scientists are excited about finding hydrated minerals such as sulfates and clays on Mars because they are usually formed in the presence of water.http://themis.asu.edu/features/nilosyrtis Places that contain clays and/or other hydrated minerals would be good places to look for evidence of life.http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/PSP_004046_2080 Rock can be formed into layers in a variety of ways. Volcanoes, wind, or water can produce layers.http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu?PSP_008437_1750 Layers can be hardened by the action of groundwater. Martian ground water probably moved hundreds of kilometers, and in the process it dissolved many minerals from the rock it passed through. When ground water surfaces in low areas containing sediments, water evaporates in the thin atmosphere and leaves behind minerals as deposits and/or cementing agents. Consequently, layers of dust could not later easily erode away since they were cemented together. , Image:Layers in Monument Valley.jpgLayers in Monument Valley. These are accepted as being formed, at least in part, by water deposition. Since Mars contains similar layers, water remains as a major cause of layering on Mars.

Troughs are created when the crust is stretched until it breaks. The stretching can be due to the large weight of a nearby volcano. Fossae/pit craters are common near volcanoes in the Tharsis and Elysium system of volcanoes.Skinner, J., L. Skinner, and J. Kargel. 2007. Re-assessment of Hydrovolcanism-based Resurfacing within the Galaxias Fossae Region of Mars. Lunar and Planetary Science XXXVIII (2007) A trough often has two breaks with a middle section moving down, leaving steep cliffs along the sides; such a trough is called a graben.http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/PSP_008641_2105 Lake George, in northern New York State, is a lake that sits in a graben. Pits are produced when material collapses into the void that results from the stretching. Pit craters do not have rims or ejecta around them, like impact craters do. Studies have found that on Mars a fault may be as deep as 5 km, that is the break in the rock goes down to 5 km. Moreover, the crack or fault sometimes widens or dilates. This widening causes a void to form with a relatively high volume. When material slides into the void, a pit crater or a pit crater chain forms. On Mars, individual pit craters can join to form chains or even to form troughs that are sometimes scalloped.Wyrick, D., D. Ferrill, D. Sims, and S. Colton. 2003. Distribution, Morphology and Structural Associations of Martian Pit Crater Chains. Lunar and Planetary Science XXXIV (2003) Other ideas have been suggested for the formation of fossae and pit craters. There is evidence that they are associated with dikes of magma. Magma might move along, under the surface, breaking the rock, and more importantly melting ice. The resulting action would cause a crack to form at the surface. Pit craters are not common on Earth. Sinkholes, where the ground falls into a hole (sometimes in the middle of a town) resemble pit craters on Mars. However, on the Earth these holes are caused by subsurface limestone being dissolved, thereby causing a void.http://www.swri.edu/4org/d20/DEMPS/planetgeo/planetmars.htmlhttp://www.msss.com/mars_images/moc/2004/01/29/index.html The images below of the Cerberus Fossae, the Elysium Fossae and other troughs, as seen by HiRISE are examples of fossae. Knowledge of the locations and formation mechanisms of pit craters and fossae is important for the future colonization of Mars because they may be reservoirs of water.Ferrill, D., D. Wyrick, A. Morris, D. Sims, and N. Franklin. 2004.

Oehler, and E. Venechuk. Prospecting for Methane in Arabia Terra, Mars - First Results. Lunar and Planetaary Science XXXVII (2006). 1193.pdf-1193.pdf. However, a recent study indicates that to match the observations of methane, there must be something that quickly destroys the gas, otherwise it would be spread all through the atmosphere instead of being concentrated in just a few locations. There may be something in the soil that oxidizes the gas before it has a chance to spread. If this is so, that same chemical would destroy organic compounds, thus life would be very difficult on Mars.http://www.spaceref.com:80/news/viewpr.html?pid=28914 Craters Impact craters generally have a rim with ejecta around them, in contrast volcanic craters usually do not have a rim or ejecta deposits. As craters get larger (greater than 10 km in diameter) they usually have a central peak.http://www.lpi.usra.edu/publications/slidesets/stones/ The peak is caused by a rebound of the crater floor following the impact. Sometimes craters will display layers. Since the collision that produces a crater is like a powerful explosion, rocks from deep underground are tossed unto the surface. Hence, craters can show us what lies deep under the surface. Research published in the journal Icarus has found pits in Zunil Crater that are caused by hot ejecta falling on ground containing ice. The pits are formed by heat forming steam that rushes out from groups of pits simultaneously, thereby blowing away from the pit ejecta.Tornabene, L. et al. 2012. Widespread crater-related pitted materials on Mars. Further evidence for the role of target volatiles during the impact process. Icarus. 220: 348-368. Zunil crater as seen by THEMIS.

Image acquired by HiRISE under HiWish program. Valles in the Elysium quadrangle Some of the valleys in the Elysium quadrangle seem to start from grabens. Granicus Vallis and Tinjar Vallis begin at a graben that lies just to the west of Elysium Mons. Certain observations suggest that they may have been the location of lahars (mudflows). The graben may have formed because of volcanic dikes. Heat from the dikes would have melted a great deal of ice.Christiansen, E. 1989. Lahars in the Elysium region of Mars. Geology. 17: 203-206. Two valley systems, the Hephaestus Fossae and Hebrus Valles, have sections that join and branch at high angles. The Athabasca Valles are perhaps the youngest outflow channel system on Mars. They lie 620 miles southeast of the large volcano Elysium Mons. Athabasca was formed by water that burst out of the Cerberus Fossae, a set of cracks or fissures in the ground.Cabrol, N. and E. Grin (eds.). 2010. Lakes on Mars. Elsevier. NYBurr, D. et al. 2002. Repeated aqueous flooding from the Cerberus Fossae: evidence for very recently extant deep groundwater on Mars. Icarus. 159: 53-73. The Cerberus Fossae most likely were formed from the stress on the crust caused by the weight of both Elysium Mons and the Tharsis volcanoes. Current evidence suggests that Cerberus floods probably erupted in several stages. Near the start of these channels (at one of the Cerberus Fossae), the system is called the Athabasca Valles; to the south and east it is called Marte Vallis. Flow rates in Marte Vallis have been estimated at around 100 times that of the Mississippi River. Eventually, the system just seems to fade out in the plains of Amazonis Planitia.Hartmann, W. 2003.

It was a member of the Delta family of rockets. Several variants existed, which were differentiated by a four digit numerical code. The Delta 1000, 2000 and 3000 series used surplus NASA Apollo program rockets engines for its first and second stages. The first stage was an Extended Long Tank Thor, re-engined with the Rocketdyne RS-27 replacing the earlier MB-3-III engine. The RS-27 engine was a rebranded H-1 engine used in the Saturn 1B with minor changes. Three or nine Castor-2 solid rocket boosters were attached to increase thrust at lift- off. The Delta-P second stage used the TRW TR-201 engine. The TR-201 engine was a Lunar Module Descent Engine reconfigured for fixed thrust output. Launches which required a three-stage configuration in order to reach higher orbits used the Thiokol Star-37D or Star-37E upper stage as an apogee kick motor. Delta 2000 launches occurred from Space Launch Complex 2W at Vandenberg AFB and both pads of Launch Complex 17 at Cape Canaveral. Forty-three out of forty-four launches were successful. The single failure being the maiden flight, 19 January 1974, which placed Skynet 2A into a useless orbit. A short circuit in an electronics package circuit board (on second stage) left the upper stages and satellite in an unstable low orbit (96 x 3,406 km x 37.6¬∞) that rapidly decayed.

Mars. University of Arizona Press: Tucson, 1992. The quadrangle covers the area from 135¬∞ to 180¬∞ west longitude and 0¬∞ to 30¬∞ north latitude on Mars. The Amazonis quadrangle contains the region called Amazonis Planitia. This area is considered to be among the youngest parts of Mars because it has a very low density of craters. The Amazonia period is named after this area. This quadrangle contains special, unusual features called the Medusae Fossae Formation and Sulci. Medusae Fossae Formation The Amazonis quadrangle is of great interest to scientists because it contains a big part of a formation, called the Medusae Fossae Formation. It is a soft, easily eroded deposit that extends for nearly 1,000 km along the equator of Mars. The surface of the formation has been eroded by the wind into a series of linear ridges called yardangs. These ridges generally point in direction of the prevailing winds that carved them and demonstrate the erosive power of Martian winds. The easily eroded nature of the Medusae Fossae Formation suggests that it is composed of weakly cemented particles,Grotzinger, J. and R. Milliken (eds.) 2012. Sedimentary Geology of Mars. SEPM and was most likely formed by the deposition of wind-blown dust or volcanic ash. Using a global climate model, a group of researchers headed by Laura Kerber found that the Medusae Fossae Formation could have easily been formed from ash from the volcanoes Apollinaris Mons, Arsia Mons, and possibly Pavonis Mons.Kerber L., et al. 2012. The disporsal of pyroclasts from ancient explosive volcanoes on Mars: Implications for the friable layered deposits. Icarus. 219:358-381. Another evidence for a fine-grained composition is that the area gives almost no radar return. For this reason it has been called a \\"stealth\\" region. Layers are seen in parts of the formation. Images from spacecraft show that they have different degrees of hardness probably because of significant variations in the physical properties, composition, particle size, and/or cementation. Very few impact craters are visible throughout the area so the surface is relatively young.http://themis.asu.edu/zoom-20020416a Researchers found that nearly all the dust in that coats everything and is in the atmosphere has its origin in the Medusae Fossae formation.http://redplanet.asu.edu/?tag=medusae- fossae-formation It turns out that the chemical elements (sulfur and chlorine) in this formation, in the atmosphere, and covering the surface are the same. The amount of dust on Mars is sufficient to form a 2 to 12 meters thick layer over the entire planet.https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/07/180724120854.htmLujendra Ojha, Kevin Lewis, Suniti Karunatillake, Mariek Schmidt. The Medusae Fossae Formation as the single largest source of dust on Mars. Nature Communications, 2018; 9 (1) DOI: 10.1038/s41467-018-05291-5 Since there are relatively few depositional features in the Medusae Fossae Formation, most of the materials being eroded are probably small enough to be suspended in the atmosphere and transported long distances.Tanaka, K. L. Dust and ice deposition in the Martian geologic record. Icarus 144, 254‚Äì266 (2000).

Sulci A very rugged terrain extends from the base of Olympus Mons. It is called Lycus Sulci. Sulci is a Latin term for the furrows on the surface of a brain, so Lycus Sulci has many furrows or grooves. The furrows are huge‚Äîup to a full kilometer deep.http://themis.asu.edu/zoom-20030606a It would be extremely difficult to walk across it or to land a space ship there. A picture of this area is shown below. Image:Sulci in Amazonis.JPGSulci in Amazonis, as seen by THEMIS. \\"Sulci\\" in Mars geography language means a furrow, like a furrow on a brain's surface.

Image:Columnar Jointing in Yellowstone.JPGColumnar Jointing in Yellowstone National Park. Craters Impact craters generally have a rim with ejecta around them, in contrast volcanic craters usually do not have a rim or ejecta deposits. As craters get larger (greater than 10 km in diameter) they usually have a central peak.http://www.lpi.usra.edu/publications/slidesets/stones/ The peak is caused by a rebound of the crater floor following the impact. Sometimes craters will display layers. Since the collision that produces a crater is like a powerful explosion, rocks from deep underground are tossed onto the surface. Hence, craters can show us what lies deep under the surface. Fresh asteroid impact on Mars - before/March 27 & after/March 28, 2012 (MRO). A pedestal crater is a crater with its ejecta sitting above the surrounding terrain and thereby forming a raised platform. They form when an impact crater ejects material which forms an erosion resistant layer, thus protecting the immediate area from erosion. As a result of this hard covering, the crater and its ejecta become elevated, as erosion removes the softer material beyond the ejecta. Some pedestals have been accurately measured to be hundreds of meters above the surrounding area. This means that hundreds of meters of material were eroded away. Pedestal craters were first observed during the Mariner missions.http://hirise.lpl.eduPSP_008508_1870Bleacher, J. and S. Sakimoto. Pedestal Craters, A Tool For Interpreting Geological Histories and Estimating Erosion Rates. LPSChttp://themis.asu.edu/feature/8 Research published in the journal Icarus has found pits in Tooting Crater that are caused by hot ejecta falling on ground containing ice. The pits are formed by heat forming steam that rushes out from groups of pits simultaneously, thereby blowing away from the pit ejecta.Boyce, J. et al. 2012. Origin of small pits in martian impact craters. Icarus. 221: 262-275.Tornabene, L. et al. 2012. Widespread crater- related pitted materials on Mars. Further evidence for the role of target volatiles during the impact process. Icarus. 220: 348-368.

As a result of this process, craters appear perched above their surroundings. Image:Pedestaldrawingcolor2.jpgDrawing shows a later idea of how some pedestal craters form. In this way of thinking, an impacting projectile goes into an ice-rich layer‚Äîbut no further. Heat and wind from the impact hardens the surface against erosion. This hardening can be accomplished by the melting of ice which produces a salt/mineral solution thereby cementing the surface. Image:Tooting Crater.JPGWall of Tooting Crater, as seen by HiRISE Image:Pettit Crater Rim.JPGPettit Crater rim, as seen by HiRISE Image:Nicholson Crater Mound.JPGNicholson mound with dark streaks, as seen by HiRISE Linear ridge networks Linear ridge networks are found in various places on Mars in and around craters.Head, J., J. Mustard. 2006. Breccia dikes and crater-related faults in impact craters on Mars: Erosion and exposure on the floor of a crater 75 km in diameter at the dichotomy boundary, Meteorit. Planet Science: 41, 1675-1690. Ridges often appear as mostly straight segments that intersect in a lattice-like manner. They are hundreds of meters long, tens of meters high, and several meters wide. It is thought that impacts created fractures in the surface, these fractures later acted as channels for fluids. Fluids cemented the structures. With the passage of time, surrounding material was eroded away, thereby leaving hard ridges behind. Since the ridges occur in locations with clay, these formations could serve as a marker for clay which requires water for its formation.Mangold et al. 2007. Mineralogy of the Nili Fossae region with OMEGA/Mars Express data: 2. Aqueous alteration of the crust. J. Geophys. Res., 112, doi:10.1029/2006JE002835.Mustard et al., 2007.

Water here could have supported past life in these locations. Clay may also preserve fossils or other traces of past life.

(2010). Modification of Martian Slope Streaks by Eolian Processes. Icarus, 205 154‚Äì164. They form in relatively steep terrain, such as along escarpments and crater walls.Schorghofer, N.; Aharonson, O.; Khatiwala, S. (2002). Slope Streaks on Mars: Correlations with Surface Properties and the Potential Role of Water. Geophys. Res. Lett., 29(23), 2126, . Although first recognized in Viking Orbiter images from the late 1970s,Morris, E.C. (1982). Aureole Deposits of the Martian Volcano Olympus Mons. J. Geophys. Res., 87(B2), 1164‚Äì1178.Ferguson,H.M.; Lucchitta, B.K. (1984). Dark Streaks on Talus Slopes, Mars in Reports of the Planetary Geology Program 1983, NASA Tech.

(2001). Mass Movement Slope Streaks Imaged by the Mars Orbiter Camera. J. Geophys. Res., 106(E10), 23,607‚Äì23,633.Chuang, F.C. et al. (2007). HiRISE Observations of Slope Streaks on Mars. Geophys. Res. Lett., 34 L20204, . The physical process that produces dark slope streaks is still uncertain. They are most likely caused by the mass movement of loose, fine-grained material on oversteepened slopes (i.e., dust avalanches).Sullivan, R.; Daubar, I.; Fenton, L.; Malin, M.; Veverka, J. (1999). Mass-Movement Considerations for Dark Slope Streaks Imaged by the Mars Orbiter Camera. 30th Lunar and Planetary Science Conference, Abstract #1809. http://www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/LPSC99/pdf/1809.pdf.Barlow, 2008, p. 141. The avalanching disturbs and removes a bright surface layer of dust to expose a darker substrate.Ferris, J. C.; Dohm, J.M.; Baker, V.R.; Maddock III, T. (2002). Dark Slope Streaks on Mars: Are Aqueous Processes Involved? Geophys. Res. Lett., 29(10), 1490, . http://www.agu.org/journals/ABS/2002/2002GL014936.shtml.

ESP 036956 1895layers.jpgLayers in Gordii Dorsum Region, as seen by HiRISE under HiWish program. Dark lines are Dark Slope Streaks. Research, published in January 2012 in Icarus, found that dark streaks were initiated by airblasts from meteorites traveling at supersonic speeds. The team of scientists was led by Kaylan Burleigh, an undergraduate at the University of Arizona. After counting some 65,000 dark streaks around the impact site of a group of 5 new craters, patterns emerged. The number of streaks was greatest closer to the impact site. So, the impact somehow probably caused the streaks. Also, the distribution of the streaks formed a pattern with two wings extending from the impact site. The curved wings resembled scimitars, curved knives. This pattern suggests that an interaction of airblasts from the group of meteorites shook dust loose enough to start dust avalanches that formed the many dark streaks. At first it was thought that the shaking of the ground from the impact caused the dust avalanches, but if that was the case the dark streaks would have been arranged symmetrically around the impacts, rather than being concentrated into curved shapes. The crater cluster lies near the equator 510 miles) south of Olympus Mons, on a type of terrain called the Medusae Fossae formation. The formation is coated with dust and contains wind-carved ridges called yardangs. These yardangs have steep slopes thickly covered with dust, so when the sonic boom of the airblast arrived from the impacts dust started to move down the slope. Using photos from Mars Global Surveyor and HiRISE camera on NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, scientists have found about 20 new impacts each year on Mars. Because the spacecraft have been imaging Mars almost continuously for a span of 14 years, newer images with suspected recent craters can be compared to older images to determine when the craters were formed. Since the craters were spotted in a HiRISE image from February 2006, but were not present in a Mars Global Surveyor image taken in May 2004, the impact occurred in that time frame. The largest crater in the cluster is about 22 meters (72 feet) in diameter with close to the area of a basketball court. As the meteorite traveled through the Martian atmosphere it probably broke up; hence a tight group of impact craters resulted. Dark slope streaks have been seen for some time, and many ideas have been advanced to explain them. This research may have finally solved this mystery.Kaylan J. Burleigh, Henry J. Melosh, Livio L.

Rock can form layers in a variety of ways. Volcanoes, wind, or water can produce layers. A detailed discussion of layering with many Martian examples can be found in Sedimentary Geology of Mars.Grotzinger, J. and R. Milliken (eds.). 2012. Sedimentary Geology of Mars. SEPM. Sometimes the layers are of different colors. Light-toned rocks on Mars have been associated with hydrated minerals like sulfates. The Mars Rover Opportunity examined such layers close-up with several instruments. Some layers are probably made up of fine particles because they seem to break up into find dust. Other layers break up into large boulders so they are probably much harder. Basalt, a volcanic rock, is thought to in the layers that form boulders. Basalt has been identified on Mars in many places. Instruments on orbiting spacecraft have detected clay (also called phyllosilicate) in some layers. A detailed discussion of layering with many Martian examples can be found in Sedimentary Geology of Mars.Grotzinger, J. and R. Milliken (eds.). 2012. Sedimentary Geology of Mars. SEPM. Layers can be hardened by the action of groundwater. Martian ground water probably moved hundreds of kilometers, and in the process it dissolved many minerals from the rock it passed through. When ground water surfaces in low areas containing sediments, water evaporates in the thin atmosphere and leaves behind minerals as deposits and/or cementing agents. Consequently, layers of dust could not later easily erode away since they were cemented together.

They are caused by giant dust devils removing bright colored dust from the Martian surface; thereby exposing a dark layer. Dust devils on Mars have been photographed both from the ground and high overhead from orbit. They have even blown dust off the solar panels of two Rovers on Mars, thereby greatly extending their useful lifetime.Mars Exploration Rover Mission: Press Release Images: Spirit.

The region contains the Olympus Mons, Ascraeus Mons and Pavonis Mons, three of the four largest shield volanoes on Mars. The north-central part contains Ceraunius Fossae. The Tharsis quadrangle is one of a series of 30 quadrangle maps of Mars used by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) Astrogeology Research Program. The Tharsis quadrangle is also referred to as MC-9 (Mars Chart-9). The name Tharsis refers to a land mentioned in the Bible. It may be at the location of the old town of Tartessus at the mouth of Guadalquivir.Blunck, J. 1982. Mars and its Satellites. Exposition Press. Smithtown, N.Y. The quadrangle covers the area from 90¬∞ to 135¬∞ west longitude and 0¬∞ to 30¬∞ north latitude on Mars and contains most of the Tharsis Rise. The plateau is about as high as Earth's Mount Everest and about as big in area as all of Europe. Tharsis contains a group of large volcanoes. Olympus Mons is the tallest.  Volcanoes  Tharsis is a land of great volcanoes. Olympus Mons is the tallest known volcano in the Solar System; it is 100 times larger than any volcano on Earth. Ascraeus Mons and Pavonis Mons are at least 200 miles across and are over six miles above the plateau that they sit on‚Äîand, the plateau is three to four miles above the zero altitude of Mars.Norton, O. 2002. Mapping Mars. Picador, New York. Pavonis Mons, the middle in a line of three volcanoes, sits at just about dead center on the equator. Mons is a term used for a large raised feature. Tholus is about the same, but smaller. A patera is flatter and like a volcano with a super large opening. Actually, a patera is formed when the top of a volcano collapses because its magma chamber is empty. Crater Lake Oregon was formed that way. Several volcanoes form a straight line in the Tharsis Uplift. Two major ones are in the Tharsus quadrangle: Ascraeus Mons and Pavonis Mons. It has been proposed that these are the result of plate motion which on Earth makes volcanic arc islands.http://dsc.discovery.com/news/2008/12/16/mars- shell-tectonics.html Although Mars displays many volcanoes here and other places, there has been no evidence of recent volcanic activity, even at a very low level. Research, published in 2017, found no active release of volcanic gases during two successive Martian years. They looked for the outgassing of sulfur-bearing chemicals with spectrometers.Khayat, A., et al. 2017.

Volcanic craters do not usually have a rim, as most impact craters do.  Potential influence of volcanic emissions on climate  Some scientists maintain that Tharsis has had great influence on the climate of Mars. Volcanoes give off large amounts of gas when they erupt. The gases are usually water vapor and carbon dioxide. Some estimates put the amount of gas released to the atmosphere as enough to make the atmosphere thicker than the Earth's. In addition, the water released by the volcanoes could have been enough to cover all of Mars to a depth of 120 meters. The greenhouse effect of carbon dioxide raises the temperature of a planet by trapping heat in the form of infrared radiation. The volcanic eruptions on Tharsis could have made Mars more Earth-like in the past. Mars may have once had a much thicker and warmer atmosphere. Oceans and/or lakes may have been present.  Fossa  The Tharsis quadrangle is also home to large troughs (long narrow depressions) called fossae in the geographical language used for Mars. Fossae in this area are Ulysses Fossae, Olympica Fossae, Ceraunius Fossae, and Tractus Fossae. These troughs form when the crust is stretched until it breaks. The stretching can be due to the large weight of a nearby volcano. Studies have shown that the volcanoes of Tharsis caused most of the major fossae on Mars. The stress that caused the fossae and other tectonic features is centered in Noctis Labyrinthus, at 4 S and 253 E. But the center has moved somewhat over time. Fossae/pit craters are common near volcanoes in the Tharsis and Elysium system of volcanoes. A trough often has two breaks with a middle section moving down, leaving steep cliffs along the sides; such a trough is called a graben.http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/PSP_008641_2105 Studies have found that on Mars a fault may be as deep as 5 km, that is the break in the rock goes down to 5 km. Moreover, the crack or fault sometimes widens or dilates. This widening causes a void to form with a relatively high volume. When material slides into the void, a pit crater or a pit crater chain forms. Pit craters do not have rims or ejecta around them, like impact craters do. On Mars, individual pit craters can join to form chains or even to form troughs that are sometimes scalloped. Other ideas have been suggested for the formation of fossae and pit craters. There is evidence that they are associated with dikes of magma. Magma might move along, under the surface, breaking the rock and, more importantly, melting ice. The resulting action would cause a crack to form at the surface. Pit craters are not common on Earth. Sinkholes, where the ground falls into a hole (sometimes in the middle of a town) resemble pit craters on Mars. However, on the Earth these holes are caused by limestone being dissolved thereby causing a void.http://www.swri.edu/4org/d20/DEMPS/planetgeo/planetmars.htmlhttp://www.msss.com/mars_images/moc/2004/01/29/index.html Knowledge of the locations and formation mechanisms of pit craters and fossae is important for the future colonization of Mars because they may be reservoirs of water.

Such streaks are common on Mars. They occur on steep slopes of craters, troughs, and valleys. The streaks are dark at first. They get lighter with age. Sometimes they start in a tiny spot, then spread out and go for hundreds of meters. They have been seen to travel around obstacles, like boulders.http://www.space.com/image_of_day_080730.html It is believed that they are avalanches of bright dust that expose a darker underlying layer. However, several ideas have been advanced to explain them. Some involve water or even the growth of organisms.http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/streaks_mars_021211.htmlhttp://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/streaks_mars_streaks_030328.htmlhttp://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/mars_ The streaks appear in areas covered with dust. Much of the Martian surface is covered with dust. Fine dust settles out of the atmosphere covering everything. We know a lot about this dust because the solar panels of the Mars Rovers get covered with dust, thus reducing the electrical energy. The power of the Rovers has been restored many times by the wind, in the form of dust devils, cleaning the panels and boosting the power. Dust storms are frequent, especially when the spring season begins in the southern hemisphere. At that time, Mars is 40% closer to the sun. The orbit of Mars is much more elliptical then the Earth's. That is the difference between the farthest point from the sun and the closest point to the sun is very great for Mars, but only a slight amount for the Earth. Also, every few years, the entire planet is engulfed in global dust storms. When NASA's Mariner 9 craft arrived there, nothing could be seen through the dust storm. Other global dust storms have also been observed, since that time. Image:Sulci Gordii Terraced Hills.JPGSulci Gordii Terraced Hills, as seen by HiRISE. Many dark slope streaks are visible.

The scale bar is 1000 meters long. Straight dark lines are where no data were collected. File:ESP 054980 2040streaks.jpg Research, published in January 2012 in Icarus, found that dark streaks were initiated by airblasts from meteorites traveling at supersonic speeds. The team of scientists was led by Kaylan Burleigh, an undergraduate at the University of Arizona. After counting some 65,000 dark streaks around the impact site of a group of 5 new craters, patterns emerged. The number of streaks was greatest closer to the impact site. So, the impact somehow probably caused the streaks. Also, the distribution of the streaks formed a pattern with two wings extending from the impact site. The curved wings resembled scimitars, curved knives. This pattern suggests that an interaction of airblasts from the group of meteorites shook dust loose enough to start dust avalanches that formed the many dark streaks. At first it was thought that the shaking of the ground from the impact caused the dust avalanches, but if that was the case the dark streaks would have been arranged symmetrically around the impacts, rather than being concentrated into curved shapes. The crater cluster lies near the equator 510 miles) south of Olympus Mons, on a type of terrain called the Medusae Fossae formation. The formation is coated with dust and contains wind-carved ridges called yardangs. These yardangs have steep slopes thickly covered with dust, so when the sonic boom of the airblast arrived from the impacts dust started to move down the slope. Using photos from Mars Global Surveyor and HiRISE camera on NASA‚Äôs Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, scientists have found about 20 new impacts each year on Mars. Because the spacecraft have been imaging Mars almost continuously for a span of 14 years, newer images with suspected recent craters can be compared to older images to determine when the craters were formed. Since the craters were spotted in a HiRISE image from February 2006, but were not present in a Mars Global Surveyor image taken in May 2004, the impact occurred in that time frame. The largest crater in the cluster is about in diameter with close to the area of a basketball court. As the meteorite traveled through the Martian atmosphere it probably broke up; hence a tight group of impact craters resulted. Dark slope streaks have been seen for some time, and many ideas have been advanced to explain them. This research may have finally solved this mystery.http://redplanet.asu.edu/ Image:2764streaks.jpgImage indicates crater cluster and curved lines formed by airblast from meteorites.

The central part includes Lunae Planum which, on the west and north borders, is dissected by Kasei Valles which, in turn, terminates in Chryse Planitia. The Lunae Palus quadrangle is one of a series of 30 quadrangle maps of Mars used by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) Astrogeology Research Program. The quadrangle is also referred to as MC-10 (Mars Chart-10).Davies, M.E.; Batson, R.M.; Wu, S.S.C. ‚ÄúGeodesy and Cartography‚Äù in Kieffer, H.H.; Jakosky, B.M.; Snyder, C.W.; Matthews, M.S., Eds.

The Lunae Palus quadrangle contains many ancient river valleys. The quadrangle covers the area from 45¬∞ to 90¬∞ west longitude and 0¬∞ to 30¬∞ north latitude on Mars. The Viking I Lander (part of Viking program) landed in the quadrangle on July 20, 1976, at . It was the first robot spacecraft to successfully land on the Red Planet.On Mars: Exploration of the Red Planet. 1958‚Äì1978, SP-4212. (NASA) Results From Viking I Mission  What would it look like walking around the landing site  The sky would be a light pink. The dirt would also appear pink. Rocks of many sizes would be spread about. One large rock, named Big Joe, is as big as a banquet table. Some boulders would show erosion due to the wind.Mutch, T. et al. 1976. \\"The Surface of Mars: The View from the Viking 2 Lander\\". Science: 194. 1277‚Äì1283. There would be many small sand dunes that are still active. The wind speed would typically be 7 meters per second (16 miles per hour). There would be a hard crust on the top of the soil similar to a deposit, called caliche which is common in the U.S. Southwest.Clark, B. et al. 1978.

The soil resembled those produced from the weathering of basaltic lavas. The tested soil contained abundant silicon and iron, along with significant amounts of magnesium, aluminum, sulfur, calcium, and titanium. Trace elements, strontium and yttrium, were detected. The amount of potassium was five times lower than the average for the Earth's crust. Some chemicals in the soil contained sulfur and chlorine that were like those remaining after the evaporation of sea water. Sulfur was more concentrated in the crust on top of the soil than in the bulk soil beneath. The sulfur may be present as sulfates of sodium, magnesium, calcium, or iron. A sulfide of iron is also possible.Clark, B. et al. 1976. \\"Inorganic Analysis of Martian Samples at the Viking Landing Sites\\". Science: 194. 1283‚Äì1288. Both the Spirit Rover and the Opportunity rover also found sulfates on Mars; consequently sulfates may be common on the Martian surface.Press Release Images: Opportunity. 25 June 2004 (JPL/NASA) The Opportunity rover (landed in 2004 with advanced instruments) found magnesium sulfate and calcium sulfate at Meridiani Planum.Christensen, P. et al. 2004. \\"Mineralogy at Meridiani Planum from the Mini-TES Experiment on the Opportunity Rover\\". Science: 306. 1733‚Äì1739 Using results from the chemical measurements, mineral models suggest that the soil could be a mixture of about 80% iron-rich clay, about 10% magnesium sulfate (kieserite?), about 5% carbonate (calcite), and about 5% iron oxides (hematite, magnetite, goethite?). These minerals are typical weathering products of mafic igneous rocks.Baird, A. et al. 1976. \\"Mineralogic and Petrologic Implications of Viking Geochemical Results From Mars: Interim Report\\". Science: 194. 1288‚Äì1293. Studies with magnets aboard the landers indicated that the soil is between 3 and 7 percent magnetic materials by weight. The magnetic chemicals could be magnetite and maghemite. These could come from the weathering of basalt rock.Hargraves, R. et al. 1976. Viking Magnetic Properties Investigation: Further Results. Science: 194. 1303‚Äì1309.Arvidson, R, A. Binder, and K. Jones. \\"The Surface of Mars\\". Scientific American Experiments carried out by the Mars Spirit rover (landed in 2004) indicated that magnetite could explain the magnetic nature of the dust and soil on Mars. Magnetite was found in the soil and that the most magnetic part of the soil was dark. Magnetite is very dark.Bertelsen, P. et al. 2004. \\"Magnetic Properties Experiments on the Mars Exploration rover Spirit at Gusev Crater\\". Science: 305. 827‚Äì829.  Search for life  Viking did three experiments looking for life. The results were surprising and interesting. Most scientists now believe that the data were due to inorganic chemical reactions of the soil. But a few still believe the results were due to living reactions. No organic chemicals were found in the soil; hence nearly all the scientific community thought that no life was found because no organic chemicals were detected. Not finding any organics was unusual since meteorites raining on Mars for 5 billion years or so would surely bring some organics. Moreover, dry areas of Antarctica do not have detectable organic compounds either, but they have organisms living in the rocks.Friedmann, E. 1982. \\"Endolithic Microorganisms in the Antarctic Cold Desert\\". Science: 215. 1045‚Äì1052. Mars has almost no ozone layer, unlike the Earth, so UV light sterilizes the surface and produces highly reactive chemicals such as peroxides that would oxidize any organic chemicals.Hartmann, W. 2003. A Traveler's Guide to Mars. Workman Publishing. NY NY. Perchlorate may be the oxidizing chemical. The Phoenix Lander discovered the chemical perchlorate in the Martian Soil. Perchlorate is a strong oxidant so it may have destroyed any organic matter on the surface.NASA Attempts to Quash Mars Rumors. Cara McDonough, August 7, 2008. If it is widespread on Mars, carbon-based life would be difficult at the soil surface. The question of life on Mars received a new, important twist when research, published in the Journal of Geophysical Research in September 2010, proposed that organic compounds were actually present in the soil analyzed by both Viking 1 and 2. NASA's Phoenix lander in 2008 detected perchlorate which can break down organic compounds. The study's authors found that perchlorate will destroy organics when heated and will produce chloromethane and dichloromethane, the identical chlorine compounds discovered by both Viking landers when they performed the same tests on Mars. Because perchlorate would have broken down any Martian organics, the question of whether or not Viking found life is still wide open.NASA/Jet Propulsion Laboratory. \\"Did Viking Mars landers find life's building blocks?

Image is located in Lunae Palus quadrangle.  Mars Science Laboratory  Hypanis Vallis, in the Lunae Palus quadrangle, was one of the sites proposed as a landing site for the Mars Science Laboratory, popularly known as the Mars Curiosity rover. One aim of the Mars Science Laboratory is to search for signs of ancient life, as many Martian rocks occur in a context of hydrogeology, that is, they were formed in water, at the bottom of lakes or seas, or by water percolating through the soil, although Brown University researchers have recently suggested outgassing of steam to atmosphere from a new planet‚Äôs interior can also produce the clay minerals seen in these rocks.https://news.brown.edu/articles/2017/12/marsclay Because such issues remain unresolved, it is hoped that a later mission could return samples from sites identified as offering best chances for remains of life. To bring the craft down safely, a 12-mile wide, smooth, flat circle was needed. Geologists hoped to examine places where water once ponded,http://themis.asu.edu/features/ianichaos and to examine its sediment layers. The site eventually settled on for the Mars Science Laboratory was Gale Crater in the Aeolis quadrangle, and a successful landing took place there in 2012. The rover is still operational as of early 2019. NASA scientists believe Gale Crater‚Äôs floor rocks are indeed sedimentary, formed in pooled water.https://mars.nasa.gov/resources/6866/sedimentary-signs-of-a- martian-lakebed/ Image:Hypanis Vallis.JPGHypanis Vallis, as seen by HiRISE. Scale bar is 500 meters long.  Kasei Valles  One of the most significant features of the Lunae Palus region, Kasei Valles, is one of the largest outflow channels on Mars. Like other outflow channels, it was carved by liquid water, probably during gigantic floods. Kasei is about long. Some sections of Kasei Valles are wide. It begins in Echus Chasma, near Valles Marineris, and empties into Chryse Planitia, not far from where Viking 1 landed. Sacra Mensa, a large tableland, divides Kasei into northern and southern channels. It is one of the longest continuous outflow channels on Mars. At around 20¬∞ north latitude Kasei Valles splits into two channels, called Kasei Vallis Canyon and North Kasei Channel. These branches recombine at around 63¬∞ west longitude. Some parts of Kasei Valles are 2‚Äì3 km deep.Baker, V. 1982. The Channels of Mars. University of Texas Press.

Finding deltas is a major sign that Mars once had a lot of water. Deltas often require deep water over a long period of time to form. Also, the water level needs to be stable to keep sediment from washing away. Deltas have been found over a wide geographical range.Irwin III, R. et al. 2005. \\"An intense terminal epoch of widespread fluvial activity on early Mars: 2.

This term is derived from Latin; therefore fossa is singular and fossae is plural.http://www.marsartgallery.com/marsnames.html Troughs form when the crust is stretched until it breaks. The stretching can be due to the large weight of a nearby volcano. Fossae/pit craters are common near volcanoes in the Tharsis and Elysium system of volcanoes.Skinner, J., L. Skinner, and J.

The Oxia Palus quadrangle is one of a series of 30 quadrangle maps of Mars used by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) Astrogeology Research Program. The Oxia Palus quadrangle is also referred to as MC-11 (Mars Chart-11).Davies, M.E.; Batson, R.M.; Wu, S.S.C. \\"Geodesy and Cartography\\" in Kieffer, H.H.; Jakosky, B.M.; Snyder, C.W.; Matthews, M.S., Eds. Mars. University of Arizona Press: Tucson, 1992. The quadrangle covers the region of 0¬∞ to 45¬∞ west longitude and 0¬∞ to 30¬∞ north latitude on Mars. This quadrangle contains parts of many regions: Chryse Planitia, Arabia Terra, Xanthe Terra, Margaritifer Terra, Meridiani Planum and Oxia Planum. Mars Pathfinder landed in the Oxia Palus quadrangle at , on July 4, 1997, at the intersection Tiu Valles and Ares Vallis. Many craters within Oxia Palus are named after famous scientists. Besides Galilei and da Vinci, some of the people who discovered the atom and radiation are honored there: Curie, Becquerel, and Rutherford.U.S. department of the Interior U.S. Geological Survey, Topographic Map of the Eastern Region of Mars M 15M 0/270 2AT, 1991 Mawrth Vallis was strongly considered as a landing site for NASA's Curiosity rover, the Mars Science Laboratory.http://www.space.com/missionlaunches/mars-science-laboratory- curiosity-landing-sites-100615.htm It made it to at least the top two sites for NASA's EXoMars 2020 Rover mission. The exact location proposed for this landing is 22.16 N and 342.05 E.https://www.hou.usra.edu/meetings/lpsc2018/eposter/2177.pdf The Mawrth Vallis region is well studied with more than 40 papers published in peer- reviewed publications. Near the Mawrth channel is a 200 meter high plateau with many exposed layers. Spectral studies have detected clay minerals that present as a sequence of layers.Loizeau et al. 2007. JGR 112, E08S08Noe Dobrea et al. 2010. JGR 115, E00D19Michalski, Noe Dobrea. 2007. Geol. 35, 10. Clay minerals were probably deposited in the Early to Middle Noachian period. Later weathering exposed a variety of minerals such as kaolin, alunite, and jarosite. Later, volcanic material covered the region. This volcanic material would have protected any possible organic materials from radiation.Gross, C. et al. 2016. MAWRTH VALLIS ‚Äì PROPOSED LANDING SITE FOR EXOMARS 2018/2020. 47th Lunar and Planetary Science Conference (2016) 1421.pdf Another site in the Oxia Palus quadrangle has been picked for the EXoMars 2020 landing is at 18.14 N and 335.76 E. This site is of interest because of a long-duration aqueous system including a delta, possible biosignatures, and a variety of clays.] Quantin C. et al. (2014) ExoMars LSSW#1 This quadrangle contains abundant evidence for past water in such forms as river valleys, lakes, springs, and chaos areas where water flowed out of the ground. A variety of clay minerals have been found in Oxia Palus. Clay is formed in water, and it is good for preserving microscopic evidence of ancient life.http://themis.asu.edu/features/marwrthvillis Recently, scientists have found strong evidence for a lake located in the Oxia Palus quadrangle that received drainage from Shalbatana Vallis. The study, carried out with HiRISE images, indicates that water formed a 30-mile-long canyon that opened up into a valley, deposited sediment, and created a delta. This delta and others around the basin imply the existence of a large, long-lived lake. Of special interest is evidence that the lake formed after the warm, wet period was thought to have ended. So, lakes may have been around much longer than previously thought. http://www.colorado.edu/news/r/7e9c22ec0cd6dabc007bb14ed2e29f16.html In October 2015, Oxia Planum, a plain located near , was reported to be the preferred landing location for the ExoMars rover. An erosion-resistant layer on top of clay units may have preserved evidence of life.Quantin, C. et al. 2015. EPSC2015-704Quantin C. et al. (2015) ExoMars LSSW#  Surface appearance  The Mars Pathfinder found its landing site to contain a great deal of rocks. Analysis shows the area to have a greater density of rocks than 90% of Mars. Some of the rocks leaned against each other in a manner geologists term imbricated. It is believed strong flood waters in the past pushed the rocks around to face away from the flow. Some pebbles were rounded, perhaps from being tumbled in a stream. Some rocks have holes on their surfaces that seem to have been fluted by wind action. Small sand dunes are present. Parts of the ground are crusty, maybe due to cementing by a fluid containing minerals. In general the rocks show a dark gray color with patches of red dust or weathered appearance on their surfaces. Dust covers the lower 5‚Äì7 cm of some rocks, so they may have once been buried, but have now become exhumed. Three knobs, one large crater, and two small craters were visible on the horizon.Golombek, M. et al. 1997. Overview of the Mars Pathfinder Mission and Assessment of Landing Site Predictions. Science: 278. pp. 1743‚Äì1748 Types of rocks Results of Mars Pathfinder's Alpha Proton X-ray Spectrometer indicated that some rocks in the Oxia Palus quadrangle are like Earth's andesites. The discovery of andesites shows that some Martian rocks have been remelted and reprocessed. On Earth, Andesite forms when magma sits in pockets of rock while some of the iron and magnesium settle out. Consequently, the final rock contains less iron and magnesium and more silica. Volcanic rocks are usually classified by comparing the relative amount of alkalis (Na2O and K2O) with the amount of silica (SiO2). Andesite is different from the rocks found in meteorites that have come from Mars.APXS Composition Results (NASA NSSDC)Bruckner, J., G. Dreibus, R. Rieder, and H. Wanke. 2001. Revised Data of the Mars Pathfinder Alpha Proton X-ray spectrometer: Geochemical Behavior of Major and Minor Elements. Lunar and Planetary Science XXXII By the time that final results of the mission were described in a series of articles in the Journal Science (December 5, 1997), it was believed that the rock Yogi contained a coating of dust, but was similar to the rock Barnacle Bill. Calculations suggest that the two rocks contain mostly the minerals orthopyroxene (magnesium-iron silicate), feldspars (aluminum silicates of potassium, sodium, and calcium), quartz (silicon dioxide), with smaller amounts of magnetite, ilmenite, iron sulfide, and calcium phosphate.

It rolled off of the lander. This picture was taken by the lander. Other results from Pathfinder By taking multiple images of the sky at different distances from the sun, scientists were able to determine that size of the particles in the pink haze was about 1 micrometer in radius. The color of some soils was similar to that of an iron oxyhydroxide phase which would support a warmer and wetter climate in the past.Smith, P. et al. 1997. Results from the Mars Pathfinder Camera Science: 278. 1758-1765 Pathfinder carried a series of magnets to examine the magnetic component of the dust. Eventually, all but one of the magnets developed a coating of dust. Since the weakest magnet did not attract any soil, it was concluded that the airborne dust did not contain pure magnetite or one type of maghemite. The dust probably was an aggregate possible cemented with ferric oxide (Fe2O3).Hviid, S. et al. 1997. Magnetic Properties Experiments on the Mars Pathfinder Lander: Preliminary Results. Science:278. 1768-1770. Winds were usually less than 10 m/s. Dust devils were detected in the early afternoon. The sky had a pink color. There was evidence of clouds and maybe fog.  River valleys and chaos  Many large, ancient river valleys are found in this area; along with collapsed features, called Chaos. The Chaotic features may have collapsed when water came out of the surface. Martian rivers begin with a Chaos region. A chaotic region can be recognized by a rat's nest of mesas, buttes, and hills, chopped through with valleys which in places look almost patterned. Some parts of this chaotic area have not collapsed completely‚Äîthey are still formed into large mesas, so they may still contain water ice. Chaotic terrain occurs in numerous locations on Mars, and always gives the strong impression that something abruptly disturbed the ground. More information and more examples of chaos can be found at Chaos terrain. Chaos regions formed long ago. By counting craters (more craters in any given area means an older surface) and by studying the valleys' relations with other geological features, scientists have concluded the channels formed 2.0 to 3.8 billion years ago.http://themis.asu.edu/features/hydraotes One generally accepted view for the formation of large outflow channels is that they were formed by catastrophic floods of water released from giant groundwater reservoirs. Perhaps, the water started to come out of the ground due to faulting or volcanic activity. Sometimes hot magma just travels under the surface. If that is the case, the ground will be heated, but there may be no evidence of lava at the surface. After water escapes, the surface collapses. Moving across the surface, the water would have simultaneously frozen and evaporated. Chunks of ice that would have rapidly formed may have enhanced the erosive power of the flood. Furthermore, the water may have frozen over at the surface, but continuing to flow underneath, eroding the ground as it moved along. Rivers in cold climates on the Earth often become ice-covered, yet continue to flow. Such catastrophic floods have occurred on Earth. One commonly cited example is the Channeled Scabland of Washington State; it was formed by the breakout of water from the Pleistocene Lake Missoula. This region resembles the Martian outflow channels.  Lakes  Research, published in January 2010, suggests that Mars had lakes, each around 20 km wide, along parts of the equator, in the Oxia Palus quadrangle. Although earlier research showed that Mars had a warm and wet early history that has long since dried up, these lakes existed in the Hesperian Epoch, a much earlier period. Using detailed images from NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, the researchers speculate that there may have been increased volcanic activity, meteorite impacts, or shifts in Mars' orbit during this period to warm Mars' atmosphere enough to melt the abundant ice present in the ground. Volcanoes would have released gases that thickened the atmosphere for a temporary period, trapping more sunlight and making it warm enough for liquid water to exist. In this new study, channels were discovered that connected lake basins near Ares Vallis. When one lake filled up, its waters overflowed the banks and carved the channels to a lower area where another lake formed.Sanjeev Gupta, Nicholas Warner, Jung-Rack Kim, Shih-Yuan Lin, Jan Muller. 2010. Hesperian equatorial thermokarst lakes in Ares Vallis as evidence for transient warm conditions on Mars. Geology: 38. 71-74. These lakes would be another place to look for evidence of present or past life.  Aram Chaos  Aram Chaos is an ancient impact crater near the Martian equator, close to Ares Vallis. About across, Aram lies in a region called Margaritifer Terra, where many water-carved channels show that floods poured out of the highlands onto the northern lowlands ages ago. The Thermal Emission Imaging System (THEMIS) on the Mars Odyssey orbiter found gray crystalline hematite on the floor of Aram. Hematite is an iron-oxide mineral that can precipitate when ground water circulates through iron-rich rocks, whether at normal temperatures or in hot springs. The floor of Aram contains huge blocks of collapsed, or chaotic, terrain that formed when water or ice was catastrophically removed. Elsewhere on Mars, the release of groundwater produced massive floods that eroded the large channels seen in Ares Vallis and similar outflow valleys. In Aram Chaos, however, the released water stayed mostly within the crater's ramparts, eroding only a small, shallow outlet channel in the eastern wall. Several minerals including hematite, sulfate minerals, and water-altered silicates in Aram suggests that a lake probably once existed within the crater. Because forming hematite requires liquid water, which could not long exist without a thick atmosphere, Mars must have had a much thicker atmosphere at some time in the past, when the hematite was formed.http://themis.asu.edu/discoveries-aramchaos Image:Erosion in Aram Chaos.JPGErosion in Aram Chaos, as seen by THEMIS. Image:Blocks in Aram.JPGBlocks in Aram showing possible source of water, as seen by THEMIS. ESP 048582 1845hangingvalleys.jpgHanging valleys in Aram Chaos, as seen by HiRISE under HiWish program  Layered sediments  Oxia Palus is an interesting area with many craters showing layered sediments.Grotzinger, J. and R. Milliken (eds.) 2012. Sedimentary Geology of Mars. SEPM Such sediments may have been deposited by water, wind, or volcanoes. The thickness of the layers is different in different craters. In Becquerel many layers are about 4 meters thick. In Crommelin crater the layers average 20 meters in thickness. At times, the top layer may be resistant to erosion and will form a feature called a mensa, the Latin word for table.http://themis.asu.edu/zoom-20050314a.html The pattern of layers within layers measured in Becquerel crater suggests that each layer was formed over a period of about 100,000 years. Moreover, every 10 layers can be grouped into larger bundles. So every 10-layer pattern took one million years to form (100,000 years/layer √ó 10 layers). The ten-layer pattern is repeated at least ten times, that is there are least ten bundles, each consisting of ten layers. It is believed that the layers relate to the cycle of changing tilt of Mars. The tilt of the Earth's axis changes by only a little more than 2 degrees. In contrast, Mars's tilt varies by tens of degrees. Today, the tilt (or obliquity) of Mars is low, so the poles are the coldest places on the planet, while the equator is the warmest. This causes gases in the atmosphere, like water and carbon dioxide, to migrate poleward, where they turn into ice. When the obliquity is higher, the poles receive more sunlight, and those materials migrate away. When carbon dioxide moves from the poles, the atmospheric pressure increases, maybe causing a difference in the ability of winds to transport and deposit sand. With more water in the atmosphere, sand grains deposited on the surface may stick and cement together to form layers. This study was done using stereo topographic maps obtained by processing data from the high-resolution camera onboard NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter.http://www.spaceref.com:80/news/viewpr.html.pid=27101 A detailed discussion of layering with many Martian examples can be found in Sedimentary Geology of Mars.Grotzinger, J. and R. Milliken (eds.). 2012. Sedimentary Geology of Mars. SEPM. Image:ESP 025558buttes.jpgButtes, as seen by HiRISE under HiWish program.

Mustard. 2006. Breccia dikes and crater-related faults in impact craters on Mars: Erosion and exposure on the floor of a crater 75 km in diameter at the dichotomy boundary, Meteorit. Planet Science: 41, 1675-1690. Ridges often appear as mostly straight segments that intersect in a lattice-like manner. They are hundreds of meters long, tens of meters high, and several meters wide. It is thought that impacts created fractures in the surface, these fractures later acted as channels for fluids. Fluids cemented the structures. With the passage of time, surrounding material was eroded away, thereby leaving hard ridges behind. Since the ridges occur in locations with clay, these formations could serve as a marker for clay which requires water for its formation.Mustard et al., 2007. Mineralogy of the Nili Fossae region with OMEGA/Mars Express data: 1. Ancient impact melt in the Isidis Basin and implications for the transition from the Noachian to Hesperian, J. Geophys. Res., 112. Water here could have supported past life in these locations. Clay may also preserve fossils or other traces of past life. Image:25558dikes.jpgPossible dikes and layered structures, as seen by HiRISE under HiWish program. These may be part of linear ridge networks that are produced with impact craters.

They are elongated and are often found on smooth area of Mars. Because they are wide, gentle topographic highs, they are sometimes hard to see. Although first thought to be caused by lava flows, they are now generally thought to be more likely caused by compressional tectonic forces that cause folding and faulting. A wrinkle ridge is visible in the image to the right of Ares Vallis.  Faults  Becquerel (Martian crater) layers, as seen by HiRISE. Click on image to see fault. A picture below right, taken of layers in Becquerel Crater, shows a straight line that represents a fault. Faults are breaks in rocks where movement has taken place. The movement may be only inches or much more. Faults can be very significant, as the break in the rock is a focus for erosion and, more importantly, can allow fluids containing dissolved minerals to rise, then be deposited. Some of the major ore deposits on Earth are formed by this process.  Springs  A study of images taken with the High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE) on the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter strongly suggests that hot springs once existed in Vernal Crater, in the Oxia Palus quadrangle. These springs may have provided a long-time location for life. Furthermore, mineral deposits associated with these springs may have preserved traces of Martian life. In Vernal Crater on a dark part of the floor, two light-toned, elliptical structures closely resemble hot springs on the Earth. They have inner and outer halos, with roughly circular depressions. A large number of hills are lined up close to the springs. These are thought to have formed by the movement of fluids along the boundaries of dipping beds. A picture below shows these springs. One of the depressions is visible. The discovery of opaline silica by the Mars Rovers, on the surface also suggests the presence of hot springs. Opaline silica is often deposited in hot springs. Scientists proposed this area should be visited by the Mars Science Laboratory.http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/PSO_002812_1855 Wikivernal.jpgVernal Crater, as seen by CTX camera (on Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter). Image:Springs in Vernal Crater.jpgSprings in Vernal Crater, as seen by HIRISE Mojave crater The crater Mojave, in the Xanthe Terra region, has alluvial fans that look remarkably similar to landforms in the Mojave Desert in the American southwest. As on Earth, the largest rocks are near the mouths of the fans. Because channels start at the tops of ridges, it is believed they were formed by heavy downpours. Researchers have suggested that the rain may have been initiated by impacts. Mojave is approximately deep. Its depth relative to its diameter and its ray system are indications it is very young. Crater counts of its ejecta blanket give an age of about 3 million years. It is considered the most recent crater of its size on Mars, and has been identified as the probable source of the shergottite meteorites collected on Earth.

Pedestal crater A pedestal crater is a crater with its ejecta sitting above the surrounding terrain and thereby forming a raised platform (like a pedestal). They form when an impact crater ejects material which forms an erosion-resistant layer, thus causing the immediate area to erode more slowly than the rest of the region. Some pedestals have been accurately measured to be hundreds of meters above the surrounding area. This means that hundreds of meters of material were eroded away. The result is that both the crater and its ejecta blanket stand above the surroundings. Pedestal craters were first observed during the Mariner missions.http://hirise.lpl.eduPSP_008508_1870Bleacher, J. and S. Sakimoto.

The flat-topped ridge near the top of the image was once a river that became inverted. The pedestal crater superposes the ridge, so it is younger. Image:Pedestal crater3.jpgPedestal craters form when the ejecta from impacts protect the underlying material from erosion. As a result of this process, craters appear perched above their surroundings. Image:Pedestaldrawingcolor2.jpgDrawing shows a later idea of how some pedestal craters form. In this way of thinking, an impacting projectile goes into an ice-rich layer--but no further. Heat and wind from the impact hardens the surface against erosion. This hardening can be accomplished by the melting of ice which produces a salt/mineral solution thereby cementing the surface. 47988 1875contextctx.jpgWide CTX image of layers under the ejecta surface of a pedestal crater.

As craters get larger (greater than 10 km in diameter) they usually have a central peak. The peak is caused by a rebound of the crater floor following the impact. Sometimes craters display layers. Since the collision that produces a crater is like a powerful explosion, rocks from deep underground are tossed onto the surface. Hence, craters can show what lies deep under the surface.

The Viking Orbiters caused a revolution in our ideas about water on Mars; huge river valleys were found in many areas. Spacecraft cameras showed that floods of water broke through dams, carved deep valleys, eroded grooves into bedrock, and traveled thousands of kilometers.Raeburn, P. 1998.

Recorded during early 2009, it was released in limited quantities on 27 April 2009. Unlike their four previous albums, the material on V√•re demoner consists of re-recorded versions of old material that was never released officially for various reasons. The album's liner notes contain information about how the lyrics relate to one another within the \\"universe\\" of the band's songs as well as lyrics. Background After the release of Maskineri in 2008, the band toured throughout Europe during fall of that year, playing songs that they had either dropped from their usual setlists a long time prior or had never really been played much at all. During this period, rumours began circulating that the band were going to record some of their unrecorded material. The rumours intensified when, at the beginning of 2009, the band had been spotted in a recording studio in J√¶ren, Stavanger, Norway. After meticulous speculation on the part of the band's fans, information about the album was released on February 14, with a complete track list being released. Overview Janove Ottesen has stated that the songs are diverse in origin, their styles differ depending on which era they were from. Three of the songs originated during the writing sessions for Ompa til du d√∏r (\\"Gruvene p√• 16\\", \\"Prosessen\\", \\"Stormfull vals\\"), three during the Evig pint period (\\"Kaval√©r\\", \\"Die Polizei\\", \\"Sonny\\"), four from Maestro (\\"Medisin og psykiatri\\", \\"V√•re demoner\\", \\"Se√±or Torpedo\\", \\"Fanden hakk i hel\\"), and two from Maskineri (\\"Den sjette sansen\\", \\"Under m√•nen\\"). The band stressed that although all of the songs were recorded on demos, this would not be a collection of \\"B-sides\\", but rather new recordings of old material. Several songs from the album had already been heard by fans, such as \\"Die Polizei\\", \\"Medisin og psykiatri\\" and \\"Den sjette sansen\\" which they have played live on several occasions, as well as \\"V√•re demoner\\" and \\"Stormfull vals\\", of which some early demos were leaked. The remainder of the album's tracks were never heard by the public. They recorded the album in more or less one take, recording it as a band and then editing in orchestrated strings, banjo, brass and guest musicians afterwards. Promotion and release Shortly after information about the album came to light, the first single, \\"Die Polizei\\", was announced. To promote the new single, the band performed the new version of the song at Cafeteateret in Oslo. This performance was recorded and scheduled to be aired on national TV, but it was eventually cut from the programming due to unknown reasons. The video was later released online. The single was released in the iTunes Store and several other musical stores on 25 March 2009. On 2 April it was revealed that the various releases of the album would be limited, and that both the vinyl and CD releases would be withdrawn from the market after seven days. On 20 April, as part of a marketing campaign with Platekompaniet, the band released preview versions of two tracks from the album each day, until the day of its release. On 8 April the band released a half-hour-long documentary chronicling the history and recording sessions of \\"Die Polizei\\", directed by Geir Zahl, one of the band's guitarists and founders. A week after its release, V√•re demoner assumed the number one spot in official Norwegian album charts and \\"Under m√•nen\\", a downloadable bonus track, entered the national Top 20 Singles charts at the twentieth spot.

It forms part of a complex (k√ºlliye) that includes a madrasah and a mausoleum (t√ºrbe). The buildings are on Kƒ±zƒ±lay street, next to the Ramazanoƒülu Hall. History The construction of the Ulu Cami was begun in 1513 by Ramazanoƒülu Halil Bey and completed by his son and successor, Piri Mehmet Pa≈üa, in 1541. For 450 years, until the building of the Sabancƒ± Merkez Camii, the Ulu Cami was the largest mosque in Adana. It was damaged in the 1998 Adana‚ÄìCeyhan earthquake and the restoration by the General Directorate of the Foundations (Vakƒ±flar Genel M√ºd√ºrl√ºƒü√º) was completed in 2004. The mosque The building carries features of Mamluk, Seljuk and the Ottoman architectural design. The western entrance is older than the main building and differs in style from the part built by Ramazanoƒülu Halil Bey. The conical stalactite roof that rises step by step above the entrance has the features of Seljukid architecture. This gives an indication that Ramadanids, who were a small beylik (emirate) in the early 16th century, initially built a small mosque, and later built the main building beside it when the beylik expanded and the small mosque was no longer sufficient. The Ulu Cami, as a whole, has a rectangular plan with dimensions of . The courtyard is entered through large gates on the west and the east sides. The northern section of the courtyard is covered with a wooden roof supported on pillars and thus can serve as an extension to the prayer hall and as an outdoor area for praying in summer. At the east end of the courtyard the entrance at the side of the main hall, is decorated with black and white marble panels. The semi-pointed arches are decorated with stalactite and flower motifs. The main prayer hall occupies the width of the rectangular plan and consists of two aisles of five bays separated by columns supporting semi-pointed arches. The mihrab is decorated with Iznik tiles and framed by black marble panels. Iznik tiles, which also decorate the qibla wall, were added after 1552. The minaret, near the eastern entrance to the courtyard, has a covered balcony and shows a Mamluk influence. The exterior of the minaret is decorated with stone of two different colors. Madrasah Madrasah of Ulu Camii is on the east side of the mosque and is described in early documents as the 'Old Madrasah'. The gate The madrasah, with the simple and clear stonework, and the fountain with 8-columns supporting a pyramidal roof, has a spacious look. Because of a little masjid squeezed on its northwest corner and an unrelated building placed beside, it does not provide a well-planned and a monumental view. There are dervish cells on the east, west and south side of the nearly square courtyard, whose sides measure . On the north side of the courtyard there is the main classroom (divanhane) covered with back to back two domes. The outer length of the madrasah from east to west is . The west gate, built higher than the cells, has a simple architecture and leads to the courtyard through a short hallway with a cradle vault. The two cells on the south side of the entrance are thought to be the kitchen of the madrasah, now used as toilet. The smaller cell, like all the other dervish cells on the qibla wing, has a crenel window, fireplace and cabinet niche and has the dimensions of . In contrast, the qibla cells are smaller than the cells on the west side and have a square plan (). Courtyard At the east wing, except the ones at the corner, the cells have the same width with the cells on the south wing. Like the others, the cells are covered with cradle vaults from inside and with grooved bricks outside. There are two extra niche on the corner cell and one extra on the third and fifth cells from south. At the cells on the qibla wing, there are two windows that face the courtyard and the street. The most interesting part of the madrasah is the classroom which is made up of two lined up domes with sharp arches and pendentive. The classroom has outer dimensions of . Although the classrooms at the Turkish madrasah of Seljuk era and after were built with vault or as a single hall with a dome, the reason that it was built in rectangle shape with two lined up domes at this madrasah can be explained in terms of reducing the effects of the hot weather. The rims of the domes are not high. White and red stones were used in sequence on the front sharp arch of the hall. Praying area The rear walls of the east wing, the chimney and the north part of the classroom are made of brick, the rest of the madrasah is made of white stone. Although the inner walls of the cells are coated with plaster, the outer surfaces are not. The design of the classroom as a back to back two domed space and the U-shape line up of the dervish cells around the courtyard distinguishes the Ulu Cami madrasah from Seljukid and Ottoman madrasah. Being the oldest among the Ramazanoƒülu madrasah, another distinctive feature, similar to Yaƒü Camii madrasah, is the stone walls of the classroom front and the brick walls of the rear. The geometric decorations on the west window of the classroom is exactly the same as the geometric decorations of the arches at the entrance of the mosque. Ornamentation The portal niche of the madrasah is decorated with a beveled molding which make a knot on a pillar and keystone on both sides. The surrounding of the inscription is decorated with palmets (fan shaped glyph) and small badges. The second of the two rectangular windows on the east and the west walls of the hall is framed with geometrically patterned molding that forms with the intersection of thread line with checker and six-armed stars that have flower with six leaves at the center. Ornaments of the window on the east wall is not completed. Inscription and chronogram The only inscription on the madrasah is the two lines of thuluth script on the crown gate. The text reads: \\"This holy madrasah was built by the son of Halil Bey, Piri, in need of Allah's mercy, on the year nine forty seven, in the middle of the month of Muharram, during the reign of the greatest and the most eminent Shah Sultan S√ºleyman ‚Äì Allah last his estate ‚Äì for the sake of Allah.\\" The chronogram indicates that the madrasah was completed in May, 1540. Although the builder of the madrasah is known as Ramazanoƒülu Piri Pasha, the architect is unknown. Mausoleum of the Ramadanids The mausoleum (t√ºrbe) of the Ramadanids, with its tall rims and tall dome giving grandeur to it, houses sarcophagi of Halil Bey and the sons of Piri Pa≈üa, Mehmet Bey and Mustafa Bey. The walls of the mausoleum are covered with tiles. The Ulu Cami mausoleum, unlike most Seljukid mausoleums, is built east of the mosque and although situated next to the mosque, is not integrated with it. The structure covers an area of . The mausoleum has a dome covered upper section containing sarcophagi and an entrance section covered with a cross vault. The entrance section is connected to the mosque by an intermediate door and to the mausoleum by another door. There is a window on the east wall. Further north, the shed, that is built on mukarnas headed four columns, is covered with a wooden roof resulting from the cradle vault perpendicularly cutting the half-transverse vault. The sharp dome of the mausoleum with a polygon rim and the triangle inference is similar to the dome at the mosque's mihrab front. Window with a coloured glass is placed on each of its 12 edges and unlike the mihrab's front dome, black stone is not used. The walls of the mausoleum are as thick as the walls of the mosque (), the difference from the mosque's qibla walls is the yellowish stones. It is also distinctive with being built completely by the fine shaped stones, unlike the mosque walls, which are built with rough stones in the middle and fine shaped stones surrounding. This indicates that the mosque and the t√ºrbe were built with a 3‚Äì5 year gap. The sarcophagi are covered with 16th century tiles. On the front side of the sarcophagi there are inscriptions on the tiles. The inscriptions being written in the same type shows that they are all written after March 1552. Other than the Ulu Cami mausoleum and the Ye≈üil T√ºrbe in Bursa, there are no other examples of mausoleums covered with tiles. The design of the Ulu Cami is similar to those built in Central Asia. Mausoleum outside the mosque complex There is also a mausoleum south of the mosque that stands as an independent structure. It is hexagonal in plan and is covered with a high dome. Since there are no inscriptions on the sarcophagi, the occupants and the date of construction are not known. As it is only away from the mausoleum of Ulu Camii, it is thought that the sarcophagi may belong to members of Ramadanid family. The mausoleum is built in the baroque style indicating that it dates from towards the end of the 18th century.

The firm had among the largest exposures to the Bernard Madoff fraud. History of the firm The firm was founded in 1983 by Walter M. Noel Jr. (born 1930 in Alabama and raised in Kenmore, New York1940 United States Census, Walter M. Noel Household, Tonawanda Township, Erie Co., NY). At one time, the firm operated from Noel's adopted hometown in Greenwich, Connecticut, before relocating its headquarters to New York City. In 1989, Noel merged his business with a small brokerage firm whose general partner was Jeffrey Tucker, who had worked as a lawyer in the enforcement division of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Both Noel and Tucker are semi-retired. Fairfield offered feeder funds of single-strategy trading managers. Fairfield also started several fund of funds, each investing in a basket of hedge funds, though the offering of feeder funds has been the primary business of Fairfield. It described its investigation of investment options as \\"deeper and broader\\" than competitive firms, because of Tucker's regulatory experience. Fairfield Greenwich's website says it \\"employs a significantly higher level of due diligence work than typically performed by most fund of funds and consulting firms.\\" It is an employee-owned firm with 140 employees, 21 of whom are shareholders. At one time, it reported $16 billion in assets under management. It was reported that foreign investors provided 95% of its managed assets, 68% from Europe, 6% from Asia, and 4% from the Middle East. Each of Noel's four daughters married into international families. In 2008, Fairfield Greenwich reported more than $14 billion in assets under management. Founding partners =Walter Noel and family= Presently, Walter Noel has a 17% ownership interest. Noel had previously been a private banker in Lausanne, Switzerland, then worked at Citigroup before becoming the head of Chemical Bank's international private banking practice in Nigeria, Switzerland, and Brazil. Noel met his Brazilian-born wife, Monica Haegler, who hails from a prominent Swiss family, while she was studying at Wellesley College in Massachusetts. They have five daughters and 19 grandchildren. Their daughters married into families that provided additional connections for the firm and helped funnel money into Madoff's fund: * His eldest daughter, Corina, married Colombian Andr√©s Piedrahita in 1989; she lives in Madrid, London and Manhattan. * Lisina, who lives in Milan, married Yanko Della Schiava, the son of the editor of Cosmopolitan in Italy and of the editor of Harper's Bazaar in Italy and France. * Ariane married Florence-born Marco Sodi, head of VSS's London-based affiliate, Veronis Suhler Stevenson International, and a partner and managing member of Veronis Suhler Stevenson Funds. They live in Notting Hill, London. * Alix, who married Philip Jamchid Toub, the son of a director of the Saronic Shipping Company in Lausanne, Switzerland. He is also a partner, lives in Greenwich.Philip Toub has 3 sons and a daughter. The youngest of his children has become very successful. He has even launched his own firm, Toub Investment Funds. Julian is also a phanominal poker player, \\"I don't play the game, I play the people.\\" * The youngest daughter, Marisa, married Matthew Brown, an asset manager and the son of a former mayor of San Marino, California. Marisa listed her New York townhouse after the Madoff revelations; she is now a jewelry designer and founder of TRE, an accessories business. Three of Noel's sons-in-law eventually became partners, promoting the firm's funds in their home countries and other regions, and funneled money into Bernie Madoff's funds. Piedrahita was named a Fairfield founding partner in 2007; he owns 22 percent and became one of the firm's dominant representatives of European and Latin American banking and investment. Della Schiava helmed Noel funds in Madrid and Lugano, Switzerland. Toub was the \\"agent\\" for the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, the Safra National Bank of New York, and the National Bank of Kuwait. Monica Noel's niece, Bianca Haegler, a well-known Brazilian socialite, and her father, Alex, reportedly steered Brazilian investors to the firm, as did her cousin Jorge Paulo Lemann, Brazil's richest financier, co-owner of InBev, Budweiser's parent company. =Jeffrey Tucker= Jeffrey Tucker also had a 17% interest in the firm. Though he is not as prominent as the Noels, Tucker benefited from Fairfield's success. In 2007, Tucker, chairman of Empire Racing, led the group of thoroughbred investors, who sought to bid for New York State's horse-racing franchise. Joint venture In 2004, the firm formed a partnership with Lion Capital of Singapore, now Lion Global Investors, and created Lion Fairfield Capital Management, a joint venture meant to introduce Asian investors to the firm. Richard Landsberger, a Fairfield partner, is director. Merger In September 2008, Banque B√©n√©dict Hentsch, a private Swiss bank, managing $2 billion in assets, merged with Fairfield Greenwich Group, intending to create an $18 billion venture in combined assets. B√©n√©dict Hentsch, founder and chairman of the board of directors, stated that clients would gain access to Fairfield Greenwich's funds, while Fairfield Greenwich clients would be able to access BBH's wealth management services. B√©n√©dict Hentsch and Robert Pennone became directors of Fairfield Greenwich Group, and Charles Murphy and Mark McKeefry joined the board of Banque B√©n√©dict Hentsch Fairfield Partners SA. In mid-December 2008, it terminated the merger due to the Madoff crisis. It had $47.5 million of client assets at risk with Madoff. > The founding shareholders of the bank have terminated their partnership with > the Fairfield Greenwich Group. They have concluded an agreement with the > latter whereby they have repurchased the total capital of the bank ... > Banque B√©n√©dict Hentsch have immediately taken all appropriate steps in > order to protect the interests of its clients and those of the bank. Relationship with Bernard Madoff Noel, a graduate of Vanderbilt University and Harvard Law School, and Tucker were introduced to Madoff in 1989 by Tucker's father-in-law, from Scarsdale, New York, who knew Madoff and had invested with him.Arvedlund, Erin (2009). Too Good to Be True: The Rise and Fall of Bernie Madoff. Penguin Group. . In 2006, the Securities and Exchange Commission, as part of an investigation into Madoff's activities, determined that Fairfield Greenwich had not properly disclosed that Madoff oversaw its investment decisions, though no evidence of fraud was found. Subsequently, Fairfield Greenwich formally disclosed Madoff's role ‚Äì and in the process raised about $1.7 billion from investors in the US and Europe. During the summer of 2007, several private equity firms were discussing taking a large investment in the firm, but Madoff ended any potential deal by refusing to grant the potential investors access for due diligence. By 2008, the firm had 48 percent of its capital tied to Madoff. Fairfield Sentry Fund Noel and Tucker created the Fairfield Sentry fund in 1990 with $1 million in \\"seed money,\\" and began expanding it a year later. At the time, Noel and Tucker said Madoff provided more information and transparency than most hedge funds, and operated a reputable Wall Street firm. The Fairfield Sentry fund required a $100,000 minimum investment, and was billed as a way to tap Madoff's trading expertise using \\"algorithmic technology\\" while Fairfield with due diligence conducted \\"systematic investment compliance\\". It had more than $7 billion invested with Madoff, and became one of his largest victims. It was Fairfield's signature fund, one of several feeder funds through which money from wealthy foreign investors could capitalize on Madoff's supposed investment acumen. Its marketing prospectus promised low volatility and steady returns, and boasted an 11 percent annual return over the prior 15 years, with only 13 losing months, a record that grew increasingly desirable over recent years of volatility. The fund was backed by loans from banks including Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria and Nomura Holdings, which invested about $304 million. The Mugrabis, extremely wealthy art collectors from Colombia who have lived in New York for more than 20 years, and long-time friends of Piedrahita (a Colombian who had married Noel's eldest daughter, Corina), were investors. > We had very little money with the fund ‚Äî just under a million dollars ‚Äî so I > am not that upset personally,\\" said Alberto Mugrabi, a son of the family > patriarch. \\"It was a very informal thing. We know Andr√©s (Piedrahita) since > forever, from Bogot√°, he's a great guy, and he says to us, 'This is the > Madoff thing, he's the master.' I trusted Andr√©s. I still trust him. In early 2005, The Abu Dhabi Investment Authority invested approximately $400 million. After redemptions in 2005 and 2006, it continued to invest $132 million, 2% of the fund's assets. One of the largest of the world's sovereign wealth funds, its assets were estimated in early 2008 to be approaching $700 billion. In August 2008, JPMorgan Chase pulled $250 million from this Madoff feeder fund account. Chase had become \\"concerned about lack of transparency\\", and had performed due diligence which had \\"raised doubts\\" about Madoff's operation. The firm set up feeder programs with such banks as Banco Santander, SA private banking unit, Banif, Swedish Bank Nordea, Zurich-based NPB Neue Privat Bank, of Geneva, all conduits of fresh money to Madoff which extended his global reach. Fees Fairfield's fee arrangement earned them approximately $400 million from 2005‚Äì08. The firm charged clients larger fees than most similar firms did, including a 20% share of profits on investments, about double what competitors charged that farmed out clients' money to a variety of fund managers. In October 2004, it also began collecting a 1% fee on assets under management. Madoff didn't charge additional fees, rather a commission on trades he allegedly executed. This arrangement raised suspicions and doubt among other money managers. Harry Markopolos, the main whistleblower in the Madoff scandal, for instance, wondered why Madoff would leave money \\"on the table,\\" which was usually unheard of on Wall Street. Hedge fund manager Suzanne Murphy believed that Noel and other Fairfield executives should have wondered why Madoff wasn't charging them anything when \\"all they were doing was collecting the money.\\" Massachusetts regulators alleged that in 2007 Tucker earned more than $30 million in fees from Madoff. Red flags There were numerous other red flags, but Fairfield Greenwich chose to ignore them. Even in down markets, Madoff helped Fairfield earn steady returns. In his third submission to the SEC about Madoff, Markopolos noted that in 14 years, Madoff only reported four losing months. Markopolos claimed this was equivalent to a baseball player with a .960 batting average, or an NFL team going 96-4 over a 100-game span. For years, Fairfield's return stream rose steadily upward with only a few downticks, represented graphically by a near- perfect 45-degree angle. Markopolos contended that such a distribution \\"simply doesn't exist in finance,\\" since the markets are too volatile under the best of conditions for this to be possible. Madoff frequently \\"over-hedged\\" his trades for Fairfield Sentry by buying more options than necessary to hedge his stock positions. In many cases, he did so to generate profits, a violation of his contract with Fairfield Greenwich. In May 2008, for instance, over $95 million of Sentry's earnings were the product of over-hedging. In June 2008, a financial consultant noticed that even with the market as a whole trending downward, Madoff was on the winning side of every trade. He didn't think this was possible even for a trader of Madoff's ability, and suggested that Fairfield Greenwich officials find out who was trading with Madoff and make sure he was actually holding the assets he claimed to hold. However, no one did so. As early as 2005, Fairfield Greenwich was aware that Madoff was being audited by an accounting firm with only one full-time accountant. New funds in 2008 As recently as December 11, 2008, the day Madoff was taken into federal custody, Madoff was working with Fairfield Greenwich to raise money for new funds, which promised about a 16% return, using more leverage than the 3‚Äì1 ratios he claimed he used in existing funds. It was reported by one client that Fairfield warned investors they would be excluded from any future Madoff product if they declined to participate in the new fund and/or withdrew from any existing funds. Aftermath of Madoff's confession Lawsuits =Investor lawsuits= Fairfield Greenwich was a defendant in a class action seeking to recoup losses resulting from Fairfield Greenwich funds' investments with Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities. The class action was a result of the consolidation of multiple cases filed in federal and state court against Fairfield Greenwich. On September 29, 2009, a second amended consolidated complaint was filed. The complaint also named as defendants the placement agent for the funds; Citco, the fund administrator and sub-custodian of the funds which calculated the net asset value (NAV) of the funds; and PricewaterhouseCoopers, the auditor of the funds. The complaint alleged fraud, violations of Rule 10b-5, violations of Section 20(a), negligent misrepresentation, gross negligence, breach of fiduciary duty, third-party beneficiary breach of contract, constructive trust, mutual mistake, negligence, negligent misrepresentation, aiding and abetting breach of fiduciary duty, aiding and abetting fraud, and unjust enrichment. In the case of Anwar v. Fairfield Greenwich (SDNY) relating to fund administrator liability for failure to handle its NAV-related obligations properly, the defendants settled in 2016 by paying the Anwar plaintiffs $235 million.\\"Madoff Anwar case, with $235 million in settlement monies, finally comes to a close\\"\\"The Citco Settlement And What Lies Ahead For PwC,\\" Law360. The court held in the case, prior to the settlement, that > \\"it is reasonable to infer from Plaintiffs' allegations that the > Administrators were aware that Plaintiffs would‚Äîand did‚Äîrely on their > statements of the Funds' NAVs that were sent to the investors.... > Accordingly, the Court finds that Plaintiffs allege a relationship between > the investors and the Administrators that gives rise to a duty of care > ....\\"Anwar v. Fairfield Greenwich (SDNY) Fairfield was also a defendant in a lawsuit filed in Miami against PricewaterhouseCoopers Ireland by investors in a fund marketed by defendant Banco Santander SA, Europe's second-largest bank by market value, which lost an estimated $3 billion. =Massachusetts action= On April 1, 2009, Massachusetts Secretary of the Commonwealth William Galvin filed a civil action charging Fairfield Greenwich with fraud, breaching its fiduciary duty to clients by failing to provide promised due diligence on its investments. The complaint sought a fine and restitution to Massachusetts investors for losses and disgorgement of performance fees paid to Fairfield by those investors. It alleged that in 2005 Madoff coached Fairfield staff about ways to answer questions from SEC attorneys who were looking into Harry Markopolos' complaint about Madoff's operations. Securities: Fairfield Greenwich The Secretary of State had stated that he had no plans to settle the lawsuit in spite of Fairfield Greenwich's offer to repay all Massachusetts investors, and said he was going to force Fairfield to explain e-mails and other evidence that appear to show company officials knew about potential problems with Madoff but failed to disclose them to clients. However, the action was settled on September 8, 2009. Fairfield Greenwich neither admitted nor denied wrongdoing, accepted a censure from state officials, agreed to provide restitution to Massachusetts investors, and paid a $500,000 fine.Wayback Machine =Other lawsuits and investigations= On April 13, 2009, a Connecticut judge dissolved a temporary asset freeze from March 30, 2009, and issued an order for Walter Noel to post property pledges of $10 million against his Greenwich home and $2 million against Jeffrey Tucker's. Noel agreed to the attachment on his house \\"with no findings, including no finding of liability or wrongdoing.\\" Andres Piedrahita's assets continued to remain temporarily frozen because he was never served with the complaint. The principals were all involved in a lawsuit filed by the town of Fairfield's pension funds. The pension fund case was Retirement Program for Employees of the Town of Fairfield v. Madoff, FBT-CV-09-5023735-S, Superior Court of Connecticut (Bridgeport). On May 18, 2009, Irving Picard sued Fairfield Greenwich Group seeking the return of $3.2 billion covering the period from 2002 to Madoff's arrest in December 2008. $1.2 billion was withdrawn in the final three months of the fraud. Since 1995, the Fairfield funds invested about $4.5 billion with Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC, or BLMIS, through 242 wire transfers. The funds were Fairfield Sentry Ltd., Greenwich Sentry LP, and Greenwich Sentry Partners LP. However, it was conjectured that the money may already be in the hands of Fairfield's own clients, who are likely off-limits to Picard, since they weren't direct investors with Madoff. On May 29, 2009, Fairfield Sentry, based in the British Virgin Islands, filed a complaint in New York State Supreme Court in Manhattan seeking to recover more than $919 million in investment management and performance fees that it paid to Fairfield, based upon \\"inflated net asset value reports of its investments with Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities LLC... The Fairfield entity defendants recklessly disregarded their duties as the fund's risk and investment adviser and their actions and inactions constitute gross negligence.\\" The lawsuit alleged breach of fiduciary duty, and unjust enrichment. It was \\"the largest victim of the fraud perpetrated by Bernard L. Madoff,\\" losing $7 billion. The defendants include founders Noel and Tucker and other fund partners who the plaintiffs alleged \\"failed to fulfill their contractual obligations to use best efforts to supervise the operations\\" of Madoff-related investments and to \\"oversee the day-to-day investment activities of the fund.\\" The case was Fairfield Sentry Ltd. v. Fairfield Greenwich Group, 601687/2009, New York State Supreme Court (Manhattan). On July 20, 2009, Justice Edward Alexander Bannister granted the request to liquidate the Fairfield Sentry funds, worth more than $7.2 billion in December 2008, now less than $70 million, incorporated in 1990 under the mutual fund statutes of the British Virgin Islands and technically under the control of their local directors. Spanish anticorruption prosecutors investigated Fairfield Greenwich as well as Piedrahita to determine what they knew about Madoff's fraudulent funds when they sold them to Spanish clients. According to Fairfield's offices in Spain, Spanish investments totaled $89.1 million. On November 19, 2010, both Greenwich Sentry, L.P. and Greenwich Sentry Partners, L.P. voluntarily filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in New York. Court filings blamed the bankruptcy filings on the cost of the Madoff-related litigation, and asserted a goal of reaching a global settlement of the litigation for the bankruptcy cases. Allegation of auditor shopping On February 4, 2009, Madoff whistleblower Harry Markopolos testified before Congress. In his prepared statement he discussed Fairfield Greenwich's accounting practices regarding its choice of auditors and accused it of frequently switching them, or \\"auditor shopping.\\" However, Markopolos did not distinguish between separate auditors for separate funds within Fairfield Greenwich, which did not actually change as he alleged. Effects on executives and other employees Noel and Tucker sold a one-16th shared interest in a Cessna 560XL private jet, purchased in late 2006. Tucker wanted to sell his three horse farms, which he bought in 2004 for $18 million. They each include furnished homes. Most of his horses have been sold. Tucker's wife Melanie, an avid bridge player, was accustomed to using her husband's jet to fly herself, and the bridge pros hired to play on her team, to bridge tournaments across the country. She postponed attending tournaments requiring air travel. Executive Charles Murphy initially offered for sale his 1882, limestone townhouse, located at 7 East 67th Street, Lenox Hill, Manhattan, but as of December 2009, the home was no longer listed. He had bought the residence from Seagram liquor heir Matthew Bronfman in 2007 for $33 million. Murphy later committed suicide by leaping to his death from the 24th floor of the Sofitel New York Hotel on 27 March 2017. His widow, Annabelle Murphy, later sold the townhouse for only $28.5 million in April 2018, well below its peak $49.5 million asking price in 2016.7 East 67th Street  Annabella Murphy  Charles MurphyWidow of Madoff victim sells NYC home for massive loss Matthew Brown and his wife, Marisa Noel Brown, were forced to sell their Upper East Side townhouse at 12 East 78th Street for $9.75 million, $3.75 million less than what they had paid in January 2008.

It is bounded to the south by Lake Kinchant, the impoudment created by the Kinchant Dam. The Pioneer River passes through the locality from west to north and forms part of the northern boundary. The Mackay-Eungella Road passes from east to north-west through the locality. There are a network of private tramways through Mirani to transport the sugar cane to the Mackay Sugar mills. The town of Mirani is situated centrally within the locality on the eastern bank of the Pioneer River with Mackay-Eungella Road passing through it. History Mirani railway bridge over the Pioneer River, circa 1910 Yuwibara (also known as Yuibera, Yuri, Juipera, Yuwiburra) is an Australian Aboriginal language spoken on Yuwibara country. It is closely related to the Biri languages/dialects. The Yuwibara language region includes the landscape within the local government boundaries of the Mackay Region. The Pioneer Valley railway line coming west from Mackay to Mirani (then known as Hamilton) was built in 1885. Later the name was changed to Mirani to avoid confusion with Hamilton in Brisbane. Mirani Post Office opened by 1890 (a receiving office had been open from 1885). Mirani Provisional School opened on 18 January 1892, becoming Mirani State School on 11 March 1897. Mirani State High School opened on 23 January 1967. On 4 September 1913, the Shire of Mirani was established, split from the Shire of Pioneer under the Local Authorities Act 1902. Mirani was the administrative centre of the shire. At the 2006 census, Mirani had a population of 813. This increased to 1,671 in 2011 before decreasing to 1,541 in 2016. On 15 March 2008, under the Local Government (Reform Implementation) Act 2007 passed by the Parliament of Queensland on 10 August 2007, the Shire of Mirani merged with the City of Mackay and Shire of Sarina to form the Mackay Region.

Prior to and after her naval service, she operated as a commercial tugboat in and around New York.  Construction and design  Originally named Robert Rogers, the tug was built in 1904 by A. C. Brown & Sons of Tottenville, Staten Island, for the Rogers Towing Company of New York City. She was slated for launch on Saturday 26 March 1904 at 3 pm, but became stuck on the ways halfway down and had to be towed into the water \\"with some little trouble\\" by tugboats. The vessel was completed on 23 June. Robert Rogers was wooden-hulled and was fitted with four watertight bulkheads. She had a length of , beam of , hold depth of and draft of aft. Her registered tonnages were 179 gross and 122 net. In merchant service she had a crew of nine; this was increased to 14 in later naval service. Robert Rogers was fitted with a second-hand engine taken from another, smaller Rogers Company tugboat, Maria Hoffman, as this engine had proven \\"too powerful\\" for the latter vessel. Hoffmans engine was fitted to Robert Rogers by Schantz & Eckert of Perth Amboy, after which the same company installed a new engine in Maria Hoffman. Robert Rogers original service speed is not known, but in later naval service, the tug's speed was recorded as .  Service history  After completion, Robert Rogers went to work with the Rogers Towing Company in and around the waters of New York. On 29 June 1906, the tug went to the assistance of a small sloop or catboat which had capsized in a squall between Sandy Hook and Swinburne Island in Lower New York Bay. One man, who had clung to the capsized vessel, was rescued, but his companions could not be found after a search and were presumed drowned. All three men had been members of the lifesaving corps. By 1907, Robert Rogers had been acquired by the Bouker Towing Company and renamed Bouker No. 2, but remained homeported in New York City. The tug's principal occupation with the new company was the towing of scows to Lower New York Bay for waste dumping. The tug appears to have usually towed two scows at a time when engaged in this service, and was capable of completing two such voyages per day in good weather. On 15 November 1909, Bouker No. 2 collided with and capsized the launch Otto II near the West Bank Light. The occupant of the launch was found clinging to the bottom of the vessel by the captain of another vessel, and returned to shore by Bouker No. 2. She was still in this service when the 3rd Naval District inspected her for possible World War I service as a minesweeper. The U.S. Navy acquired her on 14 December 1917 and commissioned her as USS Bouker No. 2 (SP-1275). Assigned to the 5th Naval District, Bouker No. 2 operated as a district craft, towing in the Hampton Roads, Virginia, area until the spring of 1921. When the U.S. Navy instituted an alphanumeric hull number classification system for its ships in mid-1920, she received the hull number YT-30 on 17 July 1920. Bouker No. 2 was ordered inspected for sale on 23 April 1921, but was withdrawn from the sale list in July 1921. Instead, she was transferred to the City of Norfolk, Virginia, in August 1921 for use as a fireboat. Less than a year later, the Norfolk city government decided that it could not use Bouker No. 2 \\"for fire purposes\\" and returned her to the Navy at the Norfolk Navy Yard at Portsmouth, Virginia, on 15 June 1922. The Navy sold Bouker No. 2 to the New York Marine Company of Delaware on 25 July 1922, her name being struck from the Navy List simultaneously. Renamed New York Marine Co. No. 6, she continued in service with the company until foundering at Brooklyn, New York, on 17 February 1926.

Businessman William McCreery co-founded the incline to facilitate access to a residential neighborhood developed from his former estate. The Clifton Avenue Incline Plane Company, formed for the purpose of erecting and operating the incline, was chartered on June 25, 1888. Within a year of that date, McCreery offered free incline rides to property auctions on the hill. There were two cars, only one of which carried passengers, the other one being a dummy car serving as a counterweight. A single operator performed the duties of engineer, conductor, and fireman. The incline closed after an accident on November 10, 1905, in which the passenger car‚Äîempty at the time‚Äîbroke loose, hurtled down the track, plowed through the waiting room on Sarah Street and smashed into the front steps of a house.

Early life and family Marwick was born near Oamaru, New Zealand, on 3 February 1891, the son of Hugh Marwick, and his wife, Jane n√©e Cuthbert. While at Waitaki Boys' High School he helped to collect fossil shells and learned the beginnings of how to classify molluscs. He studied and taught at the University of Otago, and in 1912 gained an MA with first-class honours in with a thesis on geology. In 1915, he married Marion Ivy Mary Keys at Mosgiel. They had two sons and two daughters, all becoming science graduates. Career With the coming of the First World War Marwick joined the New Zealand Medical Corps in 1916, and was posted to Egypt. He served there as a medical orderly in the New Zealand Division, and also in Palestine, Sinai and Jordan. He won the Military Medal, and returned to Egypt, where he remained until 1919. In 1920 he became an assistant geologist in the New Zealand Geological Survey. As the only Geological Survey palaeontologist, Marwick named most of the common New Zealand Tertiary fossils, as well as many rarer ones. His work on molluscs were important contributions to understanding the Cenozoic-era connections and environments. He continued work with oil companies in this field after he retired. From 1937, still in the Geological Survey, Marwick entered into a fifteen-year collaboration with Harold Finlay. He persuaded Finlay to shift his focus from molluscs to forams. The result of this collaboration was the integration of Finlay's foram work with Marwick's stratigraphy and mollusc work. They jointly produced a schema of New Zealand Cenozoic rocks that survives to the present almost without modification. Marwick retired in 1952. He continued to work from home in what became a highly productive period. Apart from his work with oil companies, he took to completion research on turritellid gastropods and New Zealand faunal studies. He made significant contributions to geomorphology and Mesozoic palaeontology, as well as volcanology and stratigraphy. His bibliography contains 124 publications.

Overview  Ricardo (Polish: Ryszard Jaxa-Ma≈Çachowski Kulisicz), was a Peruvian architect of Polish and Slovak origin. He worked in Lima, Peru for nearly all of his professional career. He designed and helped build over 15 important buildings in Lima. He married Mar√≠a, the love of his life. He wrote a book entitled ‚ÄúLessons Of Elements And Theory Of Architecture‚Äù (Lecciones de Elementos y Teor√≠a de la Arquitectura).  Life  Ricardo de Jaxa Malchowski was born on May 14, 1887 in Odessa at the very southwest of the Russian Empire (current day Ukraine). He is the son of Agusto de Jaxa Malachowski and Malwina Kulisicz . His Father was Agusto (Pole) and his mother was Malwina (Slovakian). At age 13, Ricardo traveled to Saint Petersburg and applied to the Navy Academy of Odessa. However, he was not admitted into the program because of his poor vision. He then continued his education in a secondary school in Odessa, where he graduated in 1905. He traveled to Paris shortly after to attend the √âcole des Beaux-Arts and pursued architecture. The architect Malachowski arrived in Lima on December 22, 1911. He immediately was put to work by President Augusto B. Leng√≠a, who asked him to design and install the sacristy of the chapel of the Government Palace. In 1914 he married Mar√≠a Benavides Diez Canseco, the daughter of the future president. Together, they had 4 children: Maria, Malvina, Augusto and Ricardo. Malachowski is known as the main architect of Government Palace of Peru in Lima (1938; also involved were arch. Claude Sahut). Some of his other important projects include R√≠mac Building (1919‚Äì24), Congress Building, fa√ßade of the Archbishop's Palace (1924), interiors of the Mayor's Office in Lima, the National Club, Society of Engineers, fa√ßade of the City's Theatre, Office of Deposits & Consignations, Bank of Italia (today Credit Bank), Embassy of Columbia, urban design and a preliminary design of the buildings at the principal Avenue Paseo de la Republica and the Dos de Mayo Square. He was the architect of various buildings in the center of Lima, residential sectors of Lima and sea resorts (such as Santa Mar√≠a del Mar, Distrito de San Bartolo, Santa Mar√≠a de Chosia). Malachowski was an impact to the overall architecture of Lima, Peru in the time that he lived and worked there. He died on December 6, 1972 in Lima, at the age of 85.  Theory of Architecture  Malachowski wrote the book, Lessons of Elements and Theory Of Architecture with the intentions of putting all his teaching material into one place. He taught the course of Elements and Theory of Architecture at the Escuela Nacional de Ingenieros (National School of Engineering) in Lima between 1915 and 1944. This book is a substantial contribution to the theories and the Peruvian architectural thought. Containing 141 sketches, the first edition was published in 1944.

Today Fabbri forms part of Rizzoli Libri, which in turn is 100% controlled by Arnoldo Mondadori Editore Origins Coming from a family of small bourgeois merchants Forlivesi, the brothers Fabbri started with little more than a love for art and culture inherited from their father Ottavio Fabbri. The eldest, Giovanni, just graduated from medical school joined the partisan of the Val d'Ossola. After the war, preferring books to the medical profession, he decided to take up a career of the editor, managing to involve his brothers. The \\"Fratelli Fabbri Editori\\" found immediate success printing text books for schools and, later, became the leading publisher in this area. They took a leap in the quality of printing to publish regular, large classical works such as The Divine Comedy and The Bible. The approval of the public encouraged them, and at the end of the fifties remain in the history of publishing with works such as \\"Masterpieces in the Centuries\\" and, particularly, \\"The Masters of Color.\\" (I Maestri del Colore). The 1960s In the 1960s \\"Fratelli Fabbri Editori\\" published Conoscere, an illustrated encyclopedia for children that entered the homes of millions of Italians. The encyclopedia was sold in bound volumes, with payment by installments. During those years, the publishing house sold approximately a billion and a half books, published in dozens of countries with translations into 14 languages, including Hindi, Urdu, Afrikaans, Turkish and Bulgarian. They were also the first Italian publisher to market multimedia products; producing the new series \\"The Stories of Sound\\" and \\"The History of Music, which combines the book and the record, addressing issues unknown at the time. For example, for \\"The History of Music\\" in order to fall within the standard packaging industry, they commissioned Philips Records to produce 10 million of the LP Special, of 20 centimeters in diameter. Towards the end of the sixties, due to the saturation of the market and social unrest, the brothers Dino and Rino sold their shares to engage in other activities abroad, thwarted by the refusal of the elder brother. The 1970s In 1971 the Istituto Finanziario Industriale (IFI; predecessor of Exor) purchased 53% of the shares of Fabbri Editori on behalf of the Agnelli family from Bertelsmann. Dino & Rino relocated abroad, but Giovanni remained on as chairman; the operational role was entrusted to Piero Stucchi Prinetti, acting as managing director. Towards the end of the 1970s Giovanni Fabbri entered the viewfinder of the Red Brigades and decided to move to Lugano, Switzerland, where he resides today. Rino Fabbri chose Paraguay. Dino Fabbri died following a long illness of \\"ALS\\" Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis on 10 December 2001 at his home in Aventura, Florida.Miami Herald, Monday, Dec 17, 2001 P. 4B Ettore Rino Fabbri died in Asunci√≥n, November 2012. The 1980s and today Fabbri Editori was part of Gruppo Rizzoli Corriere della Sera (now RCS MediaGroup) and continues to be active in the publishing of textbooks and publications. RCS' book businesses, including Fabbri, were acquired Arnoldo Mondadori Editore in 2016. With the spread of 'home-video (especially with the arrival of the DVD) Fabbri concluded agreements that allow it to distribute through the network of kiosks a monographic series on actors (such as the series of films of 007) and collections of the movies of Alberto Sordi and Gilberto Govi, directors and genres of film.

UDI involves considering the potential needs of all learners when designing and delivering instruction by identifying and eliminating unnecessary barriers to teaching and learning while maintaining academic rigor. UDI is thus proactive and benefits all students, in contrast to providing accommodations for a specific student (e.g., providing a sign language interpreter for a student who is deaf). Background Universal Design for Instruction (UDI) applies and adapts universal design principles and the Principles of Universal DesignPrinciples of Universal Design, Center for Universal Design, NCSU to learning environments and learning products, with a goal toward maximizing learning for all students. Universal design (UD), a concept pioneered by architect Ronald Mace at North Carolina State University (NCSU), refers to buildings, products, and environments that are inherently accessible to both people without disabilities and people with disabilities.A Primer on Universal Design (UD) in Education, Dave L. Edyburn, Ph.D. The Center for Universal Design at NCSU established a set of Principles of Universal DesignCenter for Universal Design, Principles of Universal Design based on UD to guide and evaluate the design process, with a goal toward creating more accessible products and environments. Universal Design for Instruction is an educational framework and set of strategies that applies both UD and the Principles of Universal Design to academic and teaching environments, learning products, and learning materials. Specific UDI frameworks and educational initiatives vary between academic and policy institutions. The Center for Universal Design in Education (CUDE)Center for Universal Design in Education at the DO-IT Center (University of Washington) combines UD, the Principles of Universal Design and Universal Design for Learning (UDL) to create UDI strategies for applying universal design to educational products and environments.Equal Access: Universal Design of Instruction Each CUDE strategy is linked with relevant principles of UD and UDL. Using a different approach, the Center on Postsecondary Education and Disability at the University of Connecticut developed a set of UDI principles that draws on the work of Chickering and Gamson,Scott, McGuire, & Shaw, 2001 who had originally published a set of principles for more inclusive postsecondary education, as well as the Principles of Universal Design.Universal Design and Universal Instructional Design - University og Guelph  Principles  The original seven Principles of Universal Design for products and environments established by the Center for Universal Design at NCSUThe Principles of Universal Design follow; UDI applies these principles to learning environments.Burgstahler, Sheryl, Universal Design in Education: Principles and Applications *Principle 1: Equitable Use *Principle 2: Flexibility in Use *Principle 3: Simple and Intuitive *Principle 4: Perceptible Information *Principle 5: Tolerance for Error *Principle 6: Low Physical Effort *Principle 7: Size and Space for Approach and Use The DO-IT Center's Center for Universal Design in Education (CUDE) combines UDI strategies and UD principles with the more specific Universal Design for Learning (UDL) framework.Burgstahler, Sheryl, Universal Design of Instruction (UDI): Definition, Principles, Guidelines, and Examples Universal Design for Learning (UDL) is \\"a set of principles for curriculum development that give all individuals equal opportunities to learn.\\"Center for Applied Special Technology, CAST Universal Design in Learning: About UDL UDL guidelines encourage curriculum designers to provide the student with options with respect to the following: *UDI 1: Perception *UDI 2: Language, Expressions, Symbolism *UDI 3: Comprehension *UDI 4: Physical Action *UDI 5: Expressive Skills and Fluency *UDI 6: Executive Functions *UDI 7: Recruiting Interest *UDI 8: Sustaining Effort and Persistence *UDI 9: Self-Regulation The University of Connecticut researchers and practitioners propose nine principles that describe a successful implementation of Universal Design for Instruction. Four of them state that materials and activities should be:UID Faculty Workbook - Mohawk College *1: Accessible and fair, *2: Flexible, *3: Straightforward and consistent, and *4: Explicit. Three principles for universal design for instruction state that the learning environment should: *5: Be supportive, *6: Minimize unnecessary physical effort, and *7: Accommodate students and multiple teaching methods. Universal design for instruction includes two more principles related to the delivery environment: *8: Tolerance for error and *9: Size and space for approach and use.  Examples of application to instruction  Ways of applying UD to instruction, developed through University of Washington Universal Design in Higher Education Initiative, include those listed below. * Delivery Methods: Use of a variety of delivery methods and learning approaches, including lecture, discussion, hands-on activities, projects, cases, and Internet-based interaction. All should be accessible to students with a wide range of abilities, backgrounds, and previous experiences. * Learning Methods and Materials: Print materials should be available in electronic format. Provide text descriptions of graphics presented on web pages. Use presentation tools to make presentations legible in large spaces. Use captioned video presentations. Provide outlines in advance to allow students to prepare for the topic to be presented. Create printed and web-based materials in simple, intuitive, and consistent formats. * Interaction: Encourage different ways for students to interact with each other and with the facilitator. This may include in-class questions and discussion, group work, and Internet-based communications. * Feedback: Provide effective prompting during an activity and feedback after the assignment is complete. Use feedback to help students correct errors and misconceptions. Allow opportunities for self-assessment. Ensure that electronic-based learning tools provide proper feedback for both navigation and learning and are designed in an accessible format. * Assessment/Demonstration of Knowledge: Ensure that students‚Äô opportunity to demonstrate knowledge is frequent and if possible, flexible. Consider options besides tests and papers for demonstrating knowledge, such as group work, demonstrations, portfolios, and videotaped or on-site presentations. * Physical Effort and Access: Ensure that classrooms, labs, and field work are accessible to individuals with a wide range of physical abilities. Make sure equipment and activities minimize sustained physical effort and accommodate people with different physical abilities. Ensure the safety of all students. Minimize the need for unnecessary physical travel by making materials available or allowing them to be submitted electronically. The process The Center for Universal Design in Education (CUDE) at the DO-IT Center at the University of Washington describes Universal Design of Instruction (UDI) as \\"a goal, a process, and a set of practices.\\" According to CUDE, the UDI process is described as the following series of steps: #Identify the course. Describe the course, its learning objectives, and its overall content. #Define the universe. Describe the overall population of students eligible to enroll in the course and then consider their potential diverse characteristics (e.g., with respect to gender; age; ethnicity and race; native language; learning style; and abilities to see, hear, manipulate objects, read, and communicate). #Involve students. Consider perspectives of students with diverse characteristics, as identified in Step 2, in the development of the course. If they are not available directly from students, gain student perspectives through diversity programs such as the campus disability services office. #Adopt instructional strategies. Adopt overall learning and teaching philosophies and methods. Integrate these practices with universal design guidelines or strategies for learning or instruction. #Apply instructional strategies. Apply universal design strategies in concert with good instructional practices (both identified in Step 4) to the overall choice of course teaching methods, curricula, and assessments. Then apply universal design to all lectures, classroom discussions, group work, handouts, web-based content, labs, fieldwork, assessment instruments, and other academic activities and materials to maximize the learning of students with the wide variety of characteristics identified in Step 2. #Plan for accommodations. Learn campus procedures for addressing accommodation requests (e.g., arrangement of sign language interpreters) from specific students for whom the course design does not automatically provide full access. #Evaluate. Monitor the effectiveness of instruction through observation and feedback from students with the diverse set of characteristics identified in Step 2, assess learning, and modify the course as appropriate.

This threat has prompted manufacturers to make products that are either difficult to modify or at least difficult to modify without warning the consumer that the product has been tampered with. Since the person making the modification is typically long gone by the time the crime is discovered, many of these cases are never solved. The crime is often linked with attempts to extort money from the manufacturer, and in many cases no contamination to a product ever takes place. Fraud is sometimes handled as a matter of civil law, but actual modification of products is almost always a matter of criminal law.  Examples   1982 Chicago Tylenol murders  Seven people died in this incident in the United States after taking medication that had been contaminated with cyanide. One man was later convicted of extortion, but no one was convicted of the murders. In 2009, the Federal Bureau of Investigation announced that it was re-examining the case. This event led to new requirements for tamper-evident seals on over-the- counter medications and changes in US tampering laws.  Foreign objects  Tampering cases often involve foreign objects in food products. These cases often focus on determining whether the contamination occurred during manufacturing, either accidentally or intentionally, or whether the claims made by the complaining customers are real or fraudulent.  Fraudulent claims  A famous case involving claims by customers that had tainted the products themselves was a series of claims in 1993 of needles found in Pepsi products. The manufacturer convincingly demonstrated that the contamination could not have taken place at the bottling plant, and several people were proven to have put the needles in themselves.  Hardware Trojan  Hardware Trojan (HT), malicious modification of the circuitry of an integrated circuit.  2018 Australian strawberry contamination  A strawberry tampering crisis where sewing needles were found in a large number of consumer strawberry brands in several Australian states, leading to supermarkets halting strawberry sales for weeks, and forcing farms to dump and burn hundreds of tonnes of produce.

Her works are marked with surrealist style. Some of Andijewska's works have been translated to English and German.Hans Thill (Hrsg.). Vorw√§rts, ihr Kampfschildkr√∂ten: Gedichte aus der Ukraine. Wunderhorn 2006. . Andijewska lives and works in Munich. She is a member of the National union of writers of Ukraine, Ukrainian PEN Club, Free academy in Munich and Federal association of artists.  Biography  Emma Andijewska was born on March 19, 1931 in Donetsk. Her father was a chemist- inventor, and her mother was an agriculturist by education. Emma Andiewska attended school only occasionally because of her frequent heavy diseases, and as such had to learn by herself. Because of this morbidity of the child her family moved to Vyshhorod in 1937, and later to Kyiv in 1939. Emma Andijewska's father was shot by the Soviet authorities so that he could not transfer his discoveries to Germans. Because of this the children and mother had to leave for Germany in 1943. The family lived in different cities of Germany, including in Berlin in an English zone of occupation. There Emma Andijewska has lain in plaster for three years being sick on a tuberculosis of a backbone. At the end of 1949 the family moved to Mittenwald, and later to Munich. In 1957 Andijewska graduated from the Ukrainian Free University in Munich specializing in philosophy and philology. In 1957 the entire family moved to New York. In 1962 Andijewska was granted United States citizenship. In 1959 she married the Ukrainian literary critic, essayist and writer Ivan Koshelivets, and lived together with him for forty years. From 1955 to 1995 Andijewska worked as an announcer, a scriptwriter and the editor of the Ukrainian department of Radio Liberty in Munich. She currently lives and works in Munich. Style Emma Andijewska is often associated with the New York group of Ukrainian √©migr√© writers. Their work is characterized by being purely esthetic and non-political. The poetry and prose of Andijewska has been often called surrealist. She emphasizes the important role of subconsciousness in her work. Spirituality and mysticism are also important aspects of her writing. The world view of Andijewska is somewhat similar to the ideas of Buddhism and Carlos Castaneda. The works of Andijewska are complex and require erudition from the reader.

It is located near the confluence of the Bratovka and the Skhodnya Rivers. History Countess Catherine Stroganova Ivan Rimsky-Korsakov For the first time mentioned in a last will dated 1565. From 1657 the village owned by a boyar Bogdan Khitrovo, who built there stone church of Intercession of the Virgin, preserved to our time. At that time (1680), in Brattsevo was 24 peasant yards and 49 residents. After the death of Khitrovo and his widow Maria Ivanovna, the village has been received by Cyril Naryshkin, relative of Peter the Great on his mother (1695). Naryshkins owned of Brattsevo nearly a century. In 1780 the village was bought from the daughters of Cyril Naryshkin be Count Alexander Stroganoff, who immediately conveyed Brattsevo to his wife Catherine Petrovna. Soon after Count Stroganoff divorced the Countess because of her romance with Ivan Rimsky-Korsakov (former favorite of Catherine the Great), leaving Brattsevo to Catherine Petrovna. Countess Catherine P. Stroganoff lived in Brattsevo with Ivan Rimsky-Korsakov until her death (1815). After her death, Brattsevo was owned by Rimsky-Korsakov. Apparently, c. 1813 upon a picturesque hill near the village was created a complex estates and parks, existing to our time. The architect is expected to be Andrey Voronikhin, a former serf of Counts Stroganoff. Palace was built as an imitation of Villa Rotonda by Andrea Palladio. After the death of Rimsky- Korsakov (1831), Brattsevo was owned by his illegitimate son from Catherine Stroganoff, Colonel Vassily Ladomirsky. In summer 1866 in Brattsevo lived the artist Ivan Shishkin. His picture \\"Noon. Neighborhoods of Moscow\\" is based on his etudes of Brattsevo. In 1852 there were 25 peasant yards and 168 residents in Brattsevo, in 1898 - 49 yards and 209 residents. In 1888 was opened the parish school. In 1879, on the banks of Skhodnya on the site of mill, first referred to in the will in 1565, was constructed a cloth factory of Ivan Suvirov. The local farmers were not employed at this factory, as the manufacturer has wished the workers to be absolutely dependent. At this factory in 1885 occurred one of the first workers strike in Russia. 20th century Church in Brattsevo, 1900s The new owner of the Suvirov factory in 1915 became colonel Hutarev. After the February Revolution of 1917 a conflict happened between Hutarev and its workers. Hutarev tried to declare a lockout, but the factory committee had a factory management in their own hands. Hutarev refused to pay, while workers locked him in a shed and released him only after his wife brought the money from Moscow. In November 1917 the new conflict occurred, when in October some of the factory workers, being members of the Red Guard, took part in the passages of arms in Moscow and Hutarev refused to admit them to work after their return. As a result, he was arrested again by workers, but successfully escaped never to return again, leaving the factory under the rule of workers. The last owner of estate was an archaeologist, director of the Imperial Historical Museum, Prince Nikolai Shcherbatov. After the revolution of 1917, he willingly transferred Brattsevo to the State, insisting, however, that it must be taken under state protection as a monument of architecture. For some time there was a museum in the palace, but soon (1922) it was closed. After that, the estate was turned into a relaxation house for Revolutionary Military Council (Revvoensoviet) and was reorganized as a sovkhoz by Revvoensoviet, by based on landowner's economy. Soon, however, the sovkhoz and the estate had been transferred to agricultural institute. In 1928 the church bell tower was demolished, in 1930 the church was closed and converted into a factory. In 1935, in the estate became a sanatorium of Main Office of Northern Sea Route (Glavsevmorput '). Subsequently, there was a relaxation house of theater union. Part of Moscow Since 1960, Brattsevo came within the boundaries of Moscow. Remains of the village were finally demolished in 1980, and on their place was built Tushino‚Äôs Children's Hospital. In early 2000s, the wasteland outside the hospital was converted into a luxury cottage accommodation.

Early life Munongo was born on 20 November 1925 in Bunkeya (now in Lualaba Province). He was a descendant of King Msiri of the Nyamwezi, who founded the State of Garenganze in the latter half of the 19th century.Patrick Munongo , his son, accessed February 2009 Politics By 1960, he was the second man in the nationalist CONAKAT party, alongside Moise Tshombe. Munongo was interim president of Katanga Province from 26 April to 22 June 1961. Munongo was Minister of Interior for the Congo in 1965 and then led the eastern Katanga province until 24 April 1966, when the province merged with the neighbouring province of Lualaba. He was Governor of South Katanga until 5 November 1966. It has been claimed he was involved in the ethnic cleansing of Kasaians from 1960 to 1962 in Katanga and tried to obtain Belgian support. It has been alleged that Munongo was involved in the death of Lumumba in 1961. Before his death Munongo was quoted in a newspaper as saying that he would, if Lumumba came to Katanga, do what the Belgians could not do and kill him. Lumumba and two other ministers were beaten on a plane journey to Katanga. Near the airport at Luano in Lubumbashi, they were all tortured, and Lumumba was personally assaulted by Katangan leaders, including Munongo and Belgian officers. After they were shot by a firing squad, their bodies were dissolved in acid.

Queenship  Eleanor ªs seal Eleanor was the daughter of Alfonso VIII of Castile and Eleanor of England. In 1221 at √Ågreda, Eleanor married King James I of Aragon; she was nineteen and he was fourteen. The next six years of James's reign were full of rebellions on the part of the nobles. By the Peace of Alcal√° of 31 March 1227, the nobles and the king came to terms. The couple had a son, Alfonso, who married Constance of B√©arn.

It comprises the Philippi Horticultural Area to the west, and some of Cape Town's larger townships located within its eastern half just south of Gugulethu & Nyanga. The horticultural area is sparsely populated compared to the surrounding city and contains many farms. Urban areas within Philippi include Browns Farm, Samora Machel/Weltevreden Valley North, Heinz Park, Phola Park, and Philippi East. A displaced resident of Philippi looking to build a house for himself. This picture is illustrative of the land hunger currently unfolding in Phillipi History The nomadic Khoi and San once used the land for grazing their animals and hunting for food. The first community of local residents was recorded in 1833 during which time it was known as \\"Die Duine\\" (The Dunes). The Philippi Germans arrived in Cape Town in three groups between 1860 and 1883, and became known for their ability to grow vegetables in the sandy soils of the Cape Flats. Until the 1970s the area was mainly used for grazing with a few farms located in the area. Rapid residential growth began in the late 1970s and early 1980s as apartheid policies which tried to prevent economic migrants from the former Ciskei and Transkei homelands in the Eastern Cape, who settled in nearby Nyanga, Langa, Gugulethu, Crossroads, Browns Farm and Samora Machel. As resistance to apartheid grew in the 1980s Philippi increasingly became a place of refuge from the political unrest in the former homelands. Additional residents came to live in Philippi when farms in Mitchell's Plain were eliminated due to urban sprawl. At least half of Cape Town's vegetables are grown in the Philippi Horticultural Area, despite being surrounded by residential suburbs which include townships, informal settlements and century-old neighourhoods. The ability to grow produce is greatly aided by the fact that the area sits on top of a large aquifer. The Germans developed farming methods over three generations to adapt to the extreme weather conditions and sandy soil. One of these practices was no-till farming. Its use is being reintroduced and encouraged today. In the Apartheid era it was designated for Coloureds who represent 70.5% with the remainder consisting of Black Africans and whites .  Economy  The Philippi Horticultural Area provides up to 80% of Cape Town's fresh produce. Continuing urban development within the horticultural area has been controversial amid concerns that it will have a negative impact on food sustainability within Cape Town broadly. The area's agricultural activities generate R484 million of economic output annually. Philippi is seen by government and businesses as ideal for certain business related developments. Philippi is slated for a number of large developments including the 'Philippi Mini-City'.

History Mao Dun dates the story November 1, 1932. It is part of a trilogy, together with Autumn Harvest and Winter Ruin. Subject Matter and Themes The major subject matter of Spring Silkworms is the difficulty villagers encounter in attempting to profit from their participation in the silk business. The story concludes, \\"Because they raised a crop of spring silkworms, the people in Old Tung Pao's village got deeper into debt.\\" A major theme of the story is the complexity the villagers face in dealing with inputs to the process (such as eggs, mulberry leaves, and equipment) and the loans they must take out to finance their activities. Complexity is added by the intrusion of foreign- owned silk processing plants (\\"filatures\\"). Historical significance Spring Silkworms deals with economic issues that came to be an important factor in the worldview of the Chinese Communist Party‚Äîand hence of the Chinese government after the establishment of the People's Republic of China. Comparative Perspective Spring Silkworms bears comparison with other works of modern literature, particularly literature dealing with the lives of people living on China's economic margins. The Good Earth by Pearl Buck describes the lives of Chinese peasants, and their economically precarious condition, during the period roughly contemporary with the story related in Spring Silkworms. English translations Foreign Languages Press (Beijing) published an English translation by Sidney Shapiro in 1956, which includes the rest of the trilogy and other stories.

It had the speed and some characteristics of the coyote, but the domesticated temperament and other characteristics of a domestic dog. It gradually lost its usefulness as aboriginal hunting methods declined, and became extinct or lost its separate identity through interbreeding with dogs in the 19th century, though some claim the breed still exists in modified form.

Its pointed ears were erect and broad at the base, and closer together than those of the Canadian Eskimo dog. Its legs were slender and rather long. The tail was thick and bushy, and it curled upwards over its right hip, though not to the extent of the Canadian Eskimo dog. The fur was long and straight, the base colour being white with large, irregular greyish black patches intermingled with various brown shades. The outside of the ears was covered with short brown hair which darkened at the base. The fur in the inside of the ears was long and white. The fur of the muzzle was short and white, as with the legs, though it became longer and thicker at the feet.The Gardens and Menagerie of the Zoological Society, Published, with the Sanction of the Council, Under the Superintendence of the Secretary and Vice-secretary of the Society, by Edward Turner Bennett, Zoological Society of London, William Harvey, Illustrated by John Jackson, William Harvey, G.

Like the wolves with which it was sympatric, it had long hair between its toes, which projected over the soles, with naked, callous protuberances being present at the root of the toes and soles, even in winter. In size, it was intermediate to the coyote and the American red fox. Temperament The Hare Indian dog was apparently very playful, and readily befriended strangers, though it was not very docile, and disliked confinement of any kind. It apparently expressed affection by rubbing its back against people, similar to a cat. In its native homeland, it was not known to bark, though puppies born in Europe learned how to imitate the barking of other dogs. When hurt or afraid, it howled like a wolf, and when curious, it made a sound described as a growl building up to a howl. History Hare Indian dog, as illustrated in The Menageries: Quadrupeds Described and Drawn from Living Subjects, 1829 Hare Indian dogs, as illustrated in Fauna Boreali-americana, Or, The Zoology of the Northern Parts of British America, 1829 It is thought by one writer that the breed originated from a cross between native Tahltan bear dogs and dogs brought to the North American continent by Viking explorers, as it bears strong similarities to Icelandic breeds in appearance and behavior. Sir J. Richardson of Edinburgh, on the other hand, who studied the breed in the 1820s, in their original form before being diluted by crossings with other breeds, could detect no decided difference in form between this breed and a coyote, and surmised that it was a domesticated version of the wild animal. He wrote, \\"The Hare Indian or Mackenzie River Dog bears the same relation to the prairie wolf [coyote] as the Esquimeaux Dog [Malamute] does to the great grey wolf.\\"Encyclop√¶dia Britannica 9th edition, 1875, in the 1891 Peale reprint, Chicago, Vol. VII p. 324, under the article \\"dog.\\" The breed seemed to be kept exclusively by the Hare Indians and other neighboring tribes, such as the Bear, Mountain, Dogrib, Cree, Slavey and Chippewa tribes living in the northwestern territories of Canada and the United States around the Great Bear Lake, Southwest to Lake Winnipeg and Lake Superior and West to the Mackenzie River. They were valued by the Indians as coursorial hunters, and they subsisted almost entirely on the produce of each hunt. Although not large enough to pose a danger to the moose and reindeer they hunted, their small size and broad feet allowed them to pursue large ungulates in deep snow, keeping them at bay until the hunters arrived. It was too small to be used as a beast of burden. It was the general belief among the Indians that the dog's origin was connected to the Arctic fox.Rural sports by WM. B. Daniel, Vol. 1, 1801. When first examined by European biologists, the Hare Indian dog was found to be almost identical to the coyote in build (save for the former's smaller skull) and fur length. The first Hare Indian dogs to be taken to Europe were a pair presented to the Zoological Society of London, after Sir John Richardson's and John Franklin's Coppermine Expedition of 1819‚Äì1822. Though originally spread over most of the northern regions of North America, the breed fell into decline after the introduction of firearms made its hunting abilities unnecessary. It gradually intermingled with other breeds such as the Newfoundland dog, the Canadian Eskimo dog and mongrels.

Biography Born in Budapest, Diescher was educated at Karlsruhe Polytechnique and the University of Zurich. Emigrating to the United States in 1866, he settled in Cincinnati, where he built his first inclined plane. He came to Pittsburgh and was associated with John Endres, the builder of the Monongahela Incline. In 1872, he married Endres's daughter, Caroline Endres, at the St. Paul German Evangelical Church in Cincinnati, Ohio. She was one of the first female engineers in the United States. Thereafter, the Dieschers made their home on Mount Washington. His sons entered into partnership with him in 1901, under the name of Samuel Diescher & Sons. Diescher designed water works, industrial buildings and plants, coal handling equipment, furnaces for the steel industry, and miscellaneous machinery for tasks ranging from soap making to steel fabrication to sugar beet processing. He also designed the majority of inclined planes in the United States, including numerous inclines in Pittsburgh and southwestern Pennsylvania. The most notable of these is the Duquesne Incline which has become a popular tourist attraction in the city of Pittsburgh. Other works attributed to him include the Castle Shannon Incline, the Castle Shannon South Incline, Penn Incline, Fort Pitt Incline, Troy Hill Incline (more probably designed by Gustav Lindenthal), Nunnery Hill Incline, Clifton Incline, Ridgewood Incline (alternatively credited to J. Ford Mackenzie) and the Johnstown Inclined Plane; as well as inclines in Wheeling, WV, Cleveland, OH, Duluth, MN, Orange, NJ, Hamilton, Ontario, Canada, and Girardot and Camboa, Colombia. He was the chief engineer for the Pittsburgh and Castle Shannon Railroad. He also designed the machinery for the famous Ferris wheel at the 1893 Columbian Exposition in Chicago, and an energy generating plant for the U. S. Wave Power Company in Atlantic City, New Jersey. He was active in highway engineering and street-railway construction, and he was well known for designing and building coal-washing plants, coke works, water works, machine shops, and rolling mills. He retired in 1908 and died on December 24, 1915.

Nai Soi is about 20 kilometers from the town of Mae Hong Son, along a paved road accessible year-round. It is perhaps most well known for the refugee camp found there and for having the largest Karenni settlement of the three villages. Thai authorities view Ban Mai Nai Soi as a self-sustaining refugee camp. Demographics Nai Soi has a population of 1,800 people and roughly 375 households.Prungchit Phanawathanawong. \\"Strengthening Protection Capacity Project Livelihoods Component: Mae Hong Son Province\\". UNHCR/ILO Livelihoods Report 2007. 50% of the ethnicity belongs to the Shan group and 50% belong to the Karen minority group. In addition, there are 6 Chinese Haw households and 15 local Thai households. The predominate religions in Nai Soi are Buddhism and Christianity. Town Education There is only one primary school and one secondary school in the entire village. 380 students are enrolled in the primary school. The majority of students are female. Out of the 380 students, 20 students are from Ban Doi Saeng. There are 30 students enrolled in grades 10-12 in studying in the Mae Hong Son town. Nai Soi also has a learning center that provides high school education to children living in Nai Soi and in the general area of the Mae Hong Son Province. The Ban Nai Soi Community Learning Center (BNSCLC) is intended to provide a high school education, practical vocational skills, and community development skills to high school aged children. However, this center only enrolls students not part of the refugee camps. Although there are no school fees, the parents and students involved are expected to contribute to the planting, cultivation, building and maintenance of the school and crops.The Ban Nai Soi Community Learning Center. (2009. \\"\\"February 9, 2009 Economy Nai Soi is the most affluent community compared to the other villages in terms of living standards and economy. 29 families have an annual income of less than 20,000 baht. The rest of the families could earn up to 100,000 per year. The average wage for female laborers rang from 50-60 baht, whereas the male laborers earn between 60-70 baht. Most of the people grow highland rice, chili, soybean, and garlic as their main crops. The agricultural practices among the Karen communities are based on traditional methods of rotation cultivation that depend on rainfall. The main staple food for Nai Soi is rice. Work time is usually between 8am and 4pm with a one-hour lunch break. Work specific to women laborers include growing paddy and clearing weeds. Men specifically work on tying and carrying garlic. Both men and women harvest rice and garlic. In 2006, villagers could sell fresh garlic for 10-15 baht per kg. The time schedule for the transportation of goods of each month is as follows: 10th-15th: rice; 15th-18th: Chili, salt, charcoal and beans; 15th-not beyond 22nd: Charcoal, cooking oil, and chili. The village currently has 600 motorcycles and 38 pick-ups. There are 2 big grocery stores along with 13 smaller grocery stores, 5 noodle shops, 1 rice and curry shop, 1 beauty salon, 1 motorcycle repair shop, and 2 barbers. Support from the Thai government and NGOs Nai Soi villagers receive training on soybean processing from the rapid Rural Development Office and on organic fertilizer from the Agricultural Extension Office. In addition, The Tambon Administrative Organization provides blankets for poor families as well as vaccination for cats and dogs. Currently, the International Rescue Committee provides water pumps and sport equipment for the village. Relations with the refugee camp Many of the villagers have relatives in the refugee camp. Moreover, there are also cases of inter-marriage among the refugees and villagers. The refugee camp also serves as a source of seasonal laborer for the villagers‚Äô fields. However, usually these seasonal laborers are hired illegally. Furthermore, the camp offers pick-up drivers a source of income by requiring their services for transportation of goods to the camp. Despite these benefits, the villagers and refugees do compete with each other in terms of raw resources and growing crops. Since, refugees and villagers share the same indigenous traditions of the forest, they compete with one another in collecting wild honey, animals, bamboo shoots, fish, crabs, etc. Specifically, bamboo depletion is a problem due to the refugees cutting them down to make bamboo panel. These bamboo panels are then transported out of the refugee camp to be sold in Chiang Mai every two months. General problems Due to flooding that occurs every year, Nai Soi is in desperate need of road repair. Moreover, Nai Soi lacks a comprehensive highland waterworks system and thus has an inadequate supply of water. At present, water is only released two times a day: between 5am and 11am and between 3:00pm and 8:00pm. There is also an inadequate amount of blankets and sweaters for the elders of the village and for 57 poor families. Recommendations by the UNHCR The UNHCR recommended: #The Thai Burma border consortium should buy soybeans and vegetables from the villagers to increase economic conditions. #There should be a system in the camp to monitor the coming and going of seasonal laborers. #Refugee who are minors should be accompanied by adults to prevent them from stealing. Refugee camp Camp: Ban Mai Nai Soi (BMN) - 3 km west of Nai Soi. In 1992, the first official Karenni refugee camps were established in the Mae Hong Son province. Out of the four camps found in the Mae Hong Son province, the Ban Mai Nai Soi (BMN) camp is the largest with almost 20,000 residents. Most of its inhabitants are from the Karen and Karenni ethnic minority groups fleeing from Myanmar. These people fled Myanmar as a result of instability and human rights violations. However, Thailand‚Äôs Ministry of Interior defines the status of these people as ‚Äúdisplaced persons fleeing fighting‚Äù and thus views them as having illegally entered the country. As such, those who leave the camps are subject to arrest and charge for illegal entry. Since the Royal Thai Government does not recognize the people living in these temporary shelters as refugees, their rights as refugees are not fully protected. For instance, the right to most favorable treatment in terms of engaging in wage-earning employment and programs as labor recruitment is denied to them.Connie Levett. ‚ÄúBurma‚Äôs Young Long-Neck Women Struggle to break out of Thailand‚Äôs ‚Äòhuman zoo.‚Äô‚Äù The Age. January 13, 2008. General Population There are 5,030 households in the camp with 9,452 females and 10,026 males. Half of the refugees are children and adolescents. Most of these children were born inside the camp and have never experienced life outside of the refugee camp. Children usually grow up in confined conditions that seriously impact the development of their skills, talents, and vision. The parents must struggle to earn extra money to buy enough meat, vegetables and fruit for their families. Although monthly rations are distributed, these are often not enough for a family to survive on. Parents also struggle to buy clothes for their children and to pay school fees. School fees can range from 25-50 baht per student and is collected by schoolteachers to be spent on school administration costs. Living Conditions Electricity generated by solar panels and mini-hydro generators are only available to the hospitals and Ministry of Thailand offices. Refugees who can afford it also have access to electricity. Basic health care facilities are available within the camp. Refugees also have access to free medical services in the camp and are transferred by camp clinics to district hospitals for serious illnesses. As of 2004, the United States‚Äô Center for Disease Control and Prevention has designated BMN as in a post-emergency phase. This means the camp has less than 1 death per 10,000 persons per day and basic needs (such as food, shelter, water and sanitation) have been met. In addition, the mortality rate for 2004 was 4.2 per 1000/year.Barbara Lopes Cardozo, Leisel Talley, Ann Burton, Carol Crawford. ‚Äú Karenni refugees living in Thai-Burmese border camps: traumatic experiences, mental health outcomes, and social functioning.‚Äù Social Science & Medicine. 2004. Education Basic education is available within the camp as well as various vocational training and Thai language courses. There are 1,627 children enrolled in nursery school, 3,432 in primary education, 2,046 in secondary education, 382 in high school education, and 143 enrolled in post-Grade 10 or teacher training programs, making it a total of 7,630 students. Most graduates of post-Grade 10 educations are getting jobs by replacing the refugees who have been offered resettlement in another country. These jobs are in the areas of education, health and sanitation services. Labor Males are more likely to leave the camp than females for the purpose of cash income. Separated children aged 15‚Äì18 generally went outside of camp during school break to find work. They usually go to places nearby such as the village Nai Soi, Mae Hong Son town or other Thai villages near the camp and the jungle surrounding the camp. The majority of refugees work in agriculture (94%) and earn roughly 41-60 baht per day. Males often receive 60 baht a day in agriculture work while females receive 50 baht for the same work. Only three percent stated of refugees stated that they had worked in construction. Approximately nine percent indicated they worked in a variety of other fields such as tourism, chicken factory and work for civil and political groups. The number of seasonal laborers supplied by the camp range from 2,500 to 4,000 people. However, the real figure is almost certainly higher as refugees are aware that it is illegal to leave the camp and are hesitant to report their departures. Research conducted by Friends of the Earth in 2001 and by UNHCR in 2007 both showed that the refugees earned around 50 baht per day. This means that the wage given to refugees has remained almost the same for at least six years. In regards to treatment of refugees who work outside of the camp, the UNHCR found: \\"55% of the people who left the camp to work had been exploited in at least one way: including mistreatment by employers (19%), being underpaid by the employers (12%), and not being paid at all by an employer (12%). Many people reported that they were exploited by their employer in more than one way. In addition, 80 percent of the total number of non-Karen people who work outside of the camp had faced labor exploitation.\\"As quote in Prungchit Phanawathanawong. \\"Strengthening Protection Capacity Project Livelihoods Component: Mae Hong Son Province\\". UNHCR/ILO Livelihoods Report 2007. p.21-22 Mental health In 2001, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention assessed the mental health conditions of Karenni refugees residing in the Mae Hong Son refugee camps. The purpose of the assessment was ‚Äúto determine the prevalence of mental illness, identify risk factors, and develop a cultural appropriate intervention program.‚Äù 317 households were surveyed with a ratio of 1.1:1 of male-to-female. The results of the survey found that 27% of respondents described the quality of life as miserable or very miserable with 60% describing it as neither pleasant nor unpleasant. 94% of respondents were also found to be unemployed or had no regular income. The most common trauma events experienced during the past 10 years were hiding in the jungle (70%), forced relocation (67%), lost property (66%), and destruction of houses and crops (48%). In addition, 3% of women and 3% of men reported having been raped. Of the respondents, 41% reported suffering from depression, 42% from anxiety, and 4.6% from PTSD. The study also revealed several psychosocial risk factors, many of which can be modified by changes in refugee policy in the Karenni camps. For instance, the micronutrient content of food rations, in combination with the policy to forbid movement, employment, and cultivation of land outside of the camp negatively impact the social functioning and mental health of the Karenni refugees. Kayan people and tourism Nai Soi is also home to a large population of the Kayan people inside Thailand. In the last 20 years, the Kayan population has grown to 520. The Kayan people are a sub-group of the Karenni minority in Burma. The Kayan women are famous for wearing brass rings around their necks, giving the illusion of an elongated neck. However, not all Kayan women wear the rings.Seth Mydans. ‚ÄúNai Soi‚Äôs Long-Necked Women.‚Äù The New York Times. May 20, 2001. As of February, 2017: There was only one \\"long-necked\\" woman and one tourist stand in the Ban Nai Soi Kayan Long-necked Village, which is located next to the entrance to the Ban Mai Nai Soi refugee camp, 3 km from Nai Soi on a dirt road in very poor condition. The sign at the entrance to Ban Nai Soi says entry is free, and that there are 20 families and 104 residents, although the sign appears to be several years old. The village contains a school, health clinic, and Christian church. No long-necked women live in the town of Nai Soi itself. Refugee Status In 2005, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees opened registration for all 50,000 refugees in the area. Almost every Kayan family applied and two were approved for New Zealand and one for Finland. However, the Thai government has defined the Kayans as ‚Äúa hill tribe‚Äù and thus has denied these people the right to seek asylum. The Royal Thai Government states that refugee status only applies to ‚Äúsomeone living in the refugee camp and who was a war refugee.‚Äù As a result, the Kayan people are not allowed to leave their largely sealed-off refugee camps in Thailand. As of 2008, these families are still not allowed to leave. Recent findings have indicated that this restriction is largely for economic rather than political reasons. In particular, Kayan women who wear brass rings are not allowed to leave the village. This is because the Thai government fears that if tourists can see these women for free in cities and towns, then they will not pay to see them in the villages.

Note: The city policemen wore a badge but were not required to wear full regulation uniforms until 1854. The new regulation uniforms of the Municipal Police in 1854 The New York City Police Department (NYPD) originates in the Government of New York City attempts to control rising crime in early to mid 19th century New York City. This increased crime was due to an increased population, caused primarily by poor Irish immigrants beginning in the 1820s. The City's reforms was modeled upon London's Metropolitan Police Service of a full-time professional police force in 1845. The Municipal Police replaced the inadequate night watch system which had been in place since the 17th century, when the city was founded by the Dutch as New Amsterdam. In 1857, the Municipal Police were tumultuously replaced by the Metropolitan Police, which consolidated other local police departments. Late 19th and early 20th century trends included professionalization and struggles against corruption.  19th century  Municipal and Metropolitan policemen fight each other in front of the New York City Hall for control over the police force in the New York City Police Riot of 1857.

New York City draft riots July 1863 The regulation uniforms of the Metropolitan Police in 1871 A 1871 map of wards and police precincts Police Commissioner Theodore Roosevelt in 1895 who tried to clean up corruption within the police department Prior to the establishment of the NYPD, New York City's population of about 320,000 was served by a force consisting of 1 night watch, 100 city marshals, 31 constables, and 51 municipal police officers. On May 7, 1844, the New York State passed the Municipal Police Act, a law which authorized creation of a police force and abolished the night watch system. At the request of the New York City Common Council, Peter Cooper drew up a proposal to create a police force of 1,200 officers. John Watts de Peyster was an early advocate of implementing military style discipline and organization to the force.Randolph, Lewis Hamersly. Biographical Sketches of Distinguished Officers of the Army and Navy, pp. 82-88. Henry E. Huntington Library: New York, 1905. However, because of a lengthy dispute between the Common Council and the Mayor of New York City regarding who would appoint the officers, the law was not put into effect until the following year. Under Mayor William Havemeyer, the city finally repealed their watch system and adopted the Municipal Police Act as an ordinance on May 23, 1845, creating the New York Police Department in fact rather than merely in legislative theory. For the purposes of policing, the city was divided into three districts, with courts, magistrates, and clerks, and station houses. The NYPD was closely modeled after the Metropolitan Police Service in London, England which used a military-like organizational structure, with rank and order. A navy blue uniform was introduced after long debate in 1853. In 1857, Republican Party reformers in the New York State capital of Albany created a new Metropolitan police force and abolished the Municipal police, pp. 838-841. as part of their effort to rein in the Democratic Party-controlled New York City government. The Metropolitan Police Bill consolidated the police in New York, Brooklyn, Staten Island, and Westchester County (which then included The Bronx), under a Governor of New York-appointed board of commissioners. Unwilling to be abolished, Mayor Fernando Wood and the Municipals resisted for several months, during which time the city effectively had two police forces, the State-controlled Metropolitans, and the Municipals. The Metropolitans included 300 policemen and 7 captains who left the Municipal police but was primarily made up of raw recruits with little or no training. The Municipals were controlled directly by Wood and including 800 policemen and 15 captains who stayed. The division between the forces was ethnically determined, with immigrants largely staying with the Municipals, and those of Anglo-Dutch heritage going to the Metropolitans. > Chaos ensued.

Unfortunately, the untested Metropolitans failed to prevent rioting in the city the next day, Independence Day (July 4), and had to be rescued by the Bowery Boys, a nativist gang, when the Irish-immigrant gang the Dead Rabbits attacked the \\"Mets\\". Barricades were erected and the battle went on for hours, the worst rioting in the city since 1849. The next Sunday, peace was maintained by the State Militia, but a week later, on July 12, German- immigrants in Little Germany rioted when the Metropolitans attempted to enforce the new reform liquor laws and close down saloons. A blacksmith was killed in the skirmish, and the next day, ten thousand marched up Broadway with a banner proclaiming Opfer der Metropolitan-Polizei (\\"Victim of the Metropolitan Police\\"). Throughout the years, the NYPD has been involved with a number of riots in New York City. In July 1863, the New York State Militias were aiding Union Army troops in Pennsylvania, when the 1863 New York Draft Riots broke out. Their absence left it to the police ‚Äî who were then outnumbered ‚Äî to quell the riots. The Tompkins Square Riot occurred on January 13, 1874 when police crushed a demonstration involving thousands of unemployed in Tompkins Square Park. Newspapers, including The New York Times, covered numerous cases of police brutality during the latter part of the 19th century. Cases often involved officers using clubs to beat suspects and persons who were drunk or rowdy, posed a challenge to officers' authority, or refused to move along down the street. Most cases of police brutality occurred in poor immigrant neighborhoods, including Five Points, the Lower East Side, and Tenderloin. Beginning in the 1870s, politics and corruption of Tammany Hall, a political machine supported by Irish immigrants infiltrated the NYPD, which was used as political tool, with positions awarded by politicians to loyalists. Many officers and leaders in the police department took bribes from local businesses, overlooking things like illegal liquor sales. Police also served political purposes such as manning polling places, where they would turn a blind eye to ballot box stuffing and other acts of fraud. The Lexow Committee was established in 1894 to investigate corruption in the police department. The committee made reform recommendations, including the suggestion that the police department adopt a civil service system. Corruption investigations have been a regular feature of the NYPD, including the Knapp Commission of the 1970s, and the Mollen Commission of the 1990s.Gabriel J. Chin (Ed.) (1997) New York City Police Corruption Investigation Commissions. New York: William S. Hein & Co. In 1895, Theodore Roosevelt became President of the NYPD Police Commission. Under his leadership, many reforms were instituted in the NYPD. On 1 January 1898, the city expanded to include Brooklyn. The department absorbed eighteen existing police departments, requiring more modern organization and communication as it now protected 320 square miles and over three million residents.The Fearless Mrs. Goodwin, Elizabeth Mitchell, Byliner Originals, 2011 20th century Policeman keeping children from a fallen electrical wire in Brooklyn in 1908 Centre and Broome Streets Policemen with African American protesters during the Bedford‚ÄìStuyvesant riot of 1964, an extension of the 1964 Harlem Riot Around the turn of the century, the NYPD began to professionalize under leadership of then President of the Police Commission, Theodore Roosevelt. With innovations in science and technology, the police force were able to establish new units, such as the Bomb Squad in 1905, Motorcycle Squad in 1911, Automobile Squad in 1919, Emergency Service Unit in 1926, Aviation Unit in 1929 as well as the Radio Motor Patrol (RMP) in 1932. The department was also among the earliest to implement fingerprinting techniques and mug shots. In 1919, the department adopted its own flag. In 1911, the department hired Samuel (Jesse) Battle as its first black officer. He went on to become the first black sergeant and lieutenant and retired after a thirty-year career. In 1896 Commissioner Roosevelt authorized the purchase of a standard issued revolver for the NYPD. It was the Colt New Police Revolver in .32 Long Colt caliber. He also instituted required firearms training including pistol practice and qualification for officers. In 1907 the Colt Police Positive revolver in .38 caliber was adopted by the department. In May 1926 the NYPD adopted the .38 Special cartridge as the standard issue ammunition for the department and started issuing its officers the Smith & Wesson Model 10 revolver and the Colt Official Police revolver. In 1994 the NYPD replaced the revolver as its main service weapon and adopted the 9mm semiautomatic pistol as its standard issued sidearm, replacing the .38 Special revolver. NYPD officers who were \\"on the job\\" on or prior to 1994 could continue to carry their revolvers if they wished. The .38 Special can still be found as a backup or off duty weapon, particularly with long serving personnel. Also, the uniforms of NYPD patrollers were changed in 1995 back from the two-tone sky blue shirt and navy blue pants introduced in 1972 to one-tone Navy blue shirts and pants. The economic downturn of the 1970s led to some extremely difficult times for the city. The Bronx, in particular, was plagued by arson, and an atmosphere of lawlessness permeated the city. Frank Serpico wrote about corruption he encountered in his time as a police officer in this era in a book, which was later turned into a movie and television series. In addition, the city's financial crisis led to a hiring freeze on all city departments, including the NYPD, from 1976 to 1980. This was followed by the crack cocaine epidemic of the late 1980s and early 1990s, which was one factor in the city's homicide rate soaring to an all-time high. By 1990, New York, a city with 7.3 million people at the time, set a record of 2,262 murders, a record that has yet to be broken by any U.S. city. Petty thefts associated with drug addiction were also increasingly common. In 1992, Mayor David Dinkins appointed the Mollen Commission, chaired by Milton Mollen, to investigate corruption in the department. The commission found that \\"Today's corruption is not the corruption of Knapp Commission days. Corruption then was largely a corruption of accommodation, of criminals and police officers giving and taking bribes, buying and selling protection. Corruption was, in its essence, consensual. Today's corruption is characterized by brutality, theft, abuse of authority and active police criminality.\\" In the mid-1990s, under Mayor Rudy Giuliani, the NYPD oversaw a large reduction in crime across the city, which has been attributed to the NYPD's implementation of the CompStat program under Police Commissioner Bill Bratton, broken windows policing, and subsiding of the crack cocaine epidemic. While CompStat was a concept that is generally attributed to Deputy Police Commissioner Jack Maple when he was a police lieutenant serving in the New York City Transit Police which came to the attention of then NYC Transit Authority Police Chief Bratton, in fact it was first implemented by Captain Mario Selvagi in Far Rockaway's 101 precinct. Since Selvagi was unable to secure the cooperation of the department's MIS department, he used pin maps. Selvagi went on to become a \\"superchief\\", but was forced out by Bill Bratton. In 1995, with Bratton as the former NYC Transit Police Chief, now as Police Commissioner, the New York City Transit Police and the New York City Housing Authority Police Department are merged in with the NYPD. The enforcement and traffic control elements of the City's Department of Transportation were merged into the NYPD in 1996. In 1998 the NYC Board of Education's school safety agents were merged into the newly formed New York City Police Department School Safety Division, to improve safety in NYC public schools.  21st century  Department K-9 unit officers with a search and rescue dog at the World Trade Center site after the September 11 attacks in 2001 During the 2001 September 11 attacks, 23 NYPD officers were killed when the World Trade Center collapsed due to terrorist attacks. More lives were lost that year than in any other year in the department's history. The NYPD Counter-Terrorism Bureau was founded in 2002 as a result of the tragedy and the threats to attack the city that followed. On July 17, 2014, Eric Garner was killed by NYPD officer Daniel Pantaleo through illegal use of a chokehold. The medical examiner later ruled Garner's death a homicide. The decision by the Richmond County Grand Jury to not indict Pantaleo sparked nationwide Black Lives Matter protests and led to the arrest of at least 300 protesters over two days in New York City. In 2014, two highly publicized attacks were committed against the NYPD. In the first, on October 23, two NYPD officers were injured, one critically, in a hatchet attack, but both officers survived their injuries. In the second, in December, two NYPD officers, Wenjian Liu and Rafael Ramos, were shot to death in an ambush in Brooklyn.2 NYPD officers assassinated. CNN. December 20, 2014. In both cases, the perpetrators later died - in the hatchet attack, the suspect was killed by police, while in the gunfire attack, the suspect killed himself after being confronted by police. In response to the shooting of Wenjian Liu and Rafael Ramos, the NYPD responded with a city-wide slowdown of policing in December. While the arrest rate for major crimes remained constant, the arrest rates for non-violent crimes and narcotics crimes dropped during the slowdown. The slowdown stopped in mid-January of 2015. In 2015 the Strategic Response Group was formed. On June 20, 2016, three officers were arrested as part of a federal corruption investigation.https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/nypd-members-arrested-in- corruption-investigation/ar-AAhktQD?li=BBnbfcL&ocid;=mailsignout Women in the New York City Police Department Capt. Edyth Totten and women police reserve of the New York City Police Department in 1918 In 1845, the New York City Police Department hired its first female jail matrons. Legislation was enacted to appoint female police matrons in 1888, and the first four were hired in 1891. In 1895, the first woman to work at Police Headquarters, Minnie Gertrude Kelly, was appointed Secretary to the Police Board. In 1912, Isabella Goodwin was appointed as the first female, first grade detective. In 1917, two unknown women were assigned special patrolwomen's badges. In 1918, the first female Deputy Commissioner, Ellen O'Grady, was appointed, and in August of that year the first group of policewomen in the NYPD were appointed (there were six). In 1919, the title \\"policewoman\\" was changed to \\"patrolwoman\\". In 1921, the Women's Police Precinct was formed with 20 patrolwomen assigned; Mary Hamilton was assigned as director. November 13, 1923, Governor Walker appointed Sylvia Daly Connell, a widow with two children, the first woman Deputy Sheriff in New York State. She was assigned to Richmond County. In 1924, the New York Police Department's Women Bureau was created. In 1926 Mary A. Sullivan was appointed to head the bureau, she would hold this position for twenty years. In 1934, female officers began to have pistol practice with male officers. In 1938, the first civil service exam for the title \\"Policewoman\\" was given. About 5,000 women took the exam, with 300 passing it. In 1942, there began a requirement of a college degree for female officers. In 1958, women and men began to train together at the Police Academy. In 1961, Felicia Shpritzer of the NYPD sued to allow women the right to take the sergeant's exam. As a result of this lawsuit, 126 policewomen took the sergeant's exam for the first time in 1964. Shpritzer and another policewoman, Gertrude Schimmel, became the first female sergeants and after suing again, the duo became the first female lieutenants in 1967. Schimmel went on to become the first female police captain in 1971 and the first female deputy inspector in 1972. In 1970, the first woman was allowed to take the test for Police Administrative Aides, and the first women were hired from the Police Administrative List. Also in that year, Police Commissioner Murphy assigned the first group of women to patrol. In 1973, the Bureau of Policewomen was abolished, and the first gender-neutral civil service exam for police officers was held. Also in that year, \\"Policewomen\\" and \\"Patrolmen\\" were officially renamed \\"Police Officers\\". In 1974, Gertrude Schimmel was appointed as the first female Inspector. In 1976, Captain Vittoria Renzullo was appointed as the first Precinct Commander. In 1977, the first women were assigned to the Homicide Unit (there were nine of them). In 1978, Gertrude Schimmel was appointed as the first female Deputy Chief. Also in that year, the Department entered into an agreement to increase the number of female detectives. In 1981, Suzanne Medicis became the first woman to receive the Combat Cross, and Sharon Fields and Tanya Braithwaite became the first women to receive the NYPD's Medal of Honor. In 1984, Irma Lozada became the first female police officer killed in the line of duty. Also in 1984, Mary Bembry became the first woman shot in the line of duty. In 1985, the first Women in Policing Conference was held. In 1987, Paula Berlinerman and Joan Clark were appointed as the first civilian women Civil Service Managers. In 1988, Mary Lowery became the first female police officer assigned to the Aviation Unit. In 1991, for the first time, the majority of the deputy commissioners were female. In 1992, Deputy Inspector Kathy Ryan was appointed as the first female Commanding Officer of the Mounted Unit. In 1994, Joyce A. Stephen became the first African-American female captain, and an Action Plan on Women's Concerns was prepared and submitted to the Police Commissioner. In 1995, Gertrude LaForgia was appointed as the first female Assistant Chief Borough Commander. See also References Footnotes Bibliography * Asbury, Herbert.

Saunders at East Cowes, Isle of Wight. Design and development It was designed to compete for the 1920 Air Ministry Commercial Amphibian Competition although it was too late to enter. The Kittiwake was a wooden amphibian biplane flying boat powered by two ABC Wasp II radial engines mounted on struts between the upper and lower wing. It had a crew of two and room for seven passengers. The fuselage, like most of the Kittiwake was built with Saunders' patent Consuta method for jointing plywood panels with sewn copper wire. This was well tested on motor boats ‚Äì it circumvented the absence of waterproof glues pre-1945 ‚Äì The hull was of two step design with a shallow V planing bottom and tumblehome sides. On its top were two accommodation levels, the lower glazed in cockpit for the two crew and above them, set back and roofed by the upper wing was the passenger space. This had its own enclosing front and side windows and held seven passengers. Though the forward part of the fuselage containing crew and passengers was married to the hull, aft of the wings these became separate, so that the Kittiwake was somewhere between a flying boat and a single float seaplane in appearance. This separation made it straightforward to mount the tail high up and well clear of the water. There was a variable-incidence tailplane with unbalanced elevators and bearing three wire braced fins, the central one carrying a balanced rudder. The Kittiwake was a four bay biplane with high aspect ratio, parallel chord Consuta covered wings without sweep or stagger. The lower one joined the fuselage at the top of the hull, with two pairs of struts to just above the chine; the upper wing met the top of the cabin. The three outer wide chord, Consuta faired interplane struts were of I form, which simplified the interplane wire bracing. Aerodynamically, the most unusual features of the Kittiwake's wings were the interlinked camber changing devices on both the leading and trailing edges of upper and lower wings, intended to increase the speed range of a quite heavily loaded aircraft (wing loading 7.2 lb/ft2). Because these lift- enhancing devices occupied most of the trailing edges, the ailerons were mounted halfway between the wings on the two outboard interplane struts. The two radial engines were also mounted mid-plane in seven sided nacelles, supported by the innermost duralumin interplane struts and steel strut braced to the fuselage. Their faired fuel tanks sat immediately above them, protruding from the upper wing surface. As an amphibian the Kittiwake needed to have a retractable undercarriage, a most unusual feature at this time. The two main wheels were retracted with a hand crank into boxes within the hull, placed between the first and second step. These boxes had cam-operated doors to preserve the hull surface. Inevitably, this arrangement led to a very narrow track undercarriage. At the rear of the hull/central float was a combined water rudder/ tailskid. Stabilising floats with planing bottoms were fixed to the lower wing below the outermost interplane struts. Operational history The prototype and only Kittiwake, registered G-EAUD, first flew briefly on 19 September 1920 with Norman Macmillan at the controls. The aircraft was damaged making a forced water landing immediately after takeoff when the leading edge camber gear was lost. It made a number of experimental flights in 1921 before it was scrapped in July 1921. It was the first of a family of Saunders and Saunders-Roe flying boats.

An exact date of the poem's writing is unknown as Umar ibn al-Farid (1181‚Äì1235 ad) is said to have written this text during the course of many years. Widely remarked as Umar ibn al-Farid's most famous work, the poem itself is one of the longest pieces of Sufi literature to date, and is still held in high regard by modern Sufi practitioners. It is 760 verses long. It is often referred to as al-Ta'iyya al-kubra (the Greater Poem Rhyming in T) to differentiate it from a shorter ode that also rhymes in t. The title can also be translated to ‚Äúthe Poem of Progress‚Äù.  Origins  The origins of this work are shrouded in mythology. Most accounts of the poem's construction derive from Umar ibn al-Farid's grandson, Umar ibn al- Farid in his biographical work ‚ÄúAdorned Proem to the Diwan‚Äù (Dibijat al- Diwan), heralding his grandfather's legacy and many of the stories surrounding it. According to Ali, Umar ibn al-Farid ‚Äúwould fall into deathlike trances for days, then recover and spontaneously recite verses directly inspired by God; these verses were then collected to form this long ode‚Äù.Homerin, Emil. Umar Ibn Al-Farid: Sufi Verse, Saintly Life. Trans. Emil Homerin. New York: Paulist P, 2001. In another story related by Ali, it is said that Umar received instruction from the prophet Muhammed himself, requesting that he title it as the ‚ÄúPoem of the Sufi Way‚Äù, instead of the original title intended by Umar ibn al-Farid, ‚ÄúThe Diaries of Hearts and the Gardens' Sweet Scents‚Äù.  Content  The poem itself is designed to demonstrate a pluralistic and mystical connection to God, or Allah. Initially, the poem likens the pursuit of God's love to the pursuit of a female, written from the man's perspective. The narrator becomes increasingly humbled throughout the poem, and, after much desperation and awe, the link to the narrator's lover, or God, becomes obscured to the point of total cohesion. This felt harmony and connection on an equal level with God is characteristically Sufi, yet it is also an area of critique from Muslim orthodoxies who label such possibility of equality with God as heresy.  Translation  The translation of the poem is known for its difficulty. There are many puns based on variations of the three-consonant radical of most Arabic words, as was custom to the mannerist (badi'a) poetry of the time.  Thematic material  As expected from a poem of such length, ‚Äúthe Poem of the Sufi Way‚Äù covers many different themes and draws on many different backgrounds. As Michael Sells writes in the Preface to Umar Ibn al- Farid: Sufi Verse, Saintly Life: ‚ÄúThe poem of the Sufi Way‚Äù is a microcosm of Islamic tradition at the time of Ibn al-Farid. A preliminary list of central themes of the poem would include the following: the famous lovers of classical Arabic poetry; key themes and passages from the Qur'an and from the hadith, the stories of the Qur'anic prophets; the stories of the four ‚Äúrightly guided‚Äù Caliphs; mystical interpretations of Qu'ranic passages and motifs that grew out of these interpretations, such as the pre-eternal covenant; worlds of esoteric science (alchemy, astrology, divination, numerology); the psychology of Sufi states of altered consciousness; the stations of Muhammad's mi'raj, or the mystic in his or her journey to the divine beloved; and interpretations of key mystical concepts such as fana' ‚Äì the passing-away of the human self in mystical union with the divine.‚ÄùUmar Ibn al Farid: Sufi Verse, Saintly Life. Preface by Michael Sells  Commentaries  Its importance has merited many commentaries, including ones by including al-FarghƒÅnƒ´ (d. 1300), al-QƒÅshƒÅnƒ´ (d. 1334), al-Qaysarƒ´ (d. 1350), JƒÅmƒ´ (d. 1492), al-B≈´rƒ´nƒ´ (d. 1615), and al- NƒÅbulusƒ´ (d. 1730). Once an unknown religious scholar asked the Shaykh's permission to write a commentary on ‚Äúthe Poem of the Sufi Way.‚Äù Ibn al-Farid asked how long the commentary would be. When the scholar replied that it would fill two volumes, Ibn al-Farid replied that he ‚Äúcould compose a two-volume commentary on each verse.‚Äù  Notes  Category:Sufi poetry ","title":"Sufi Way"},{"id":"21551516","text":"Gone Fishin' is a song written by Nick and Charles Kenny and recorded by Bing Crosby and Louis Armstrong in 1951. The song had been published in 1950 and was recorded by Arthur Godfrey, The Three Suns with Texas Jim Robertson, and by the Johnny Guarnieri Quintet in 1950. None of these recordings charted. The Crosby recording came about when the singer had Armstrong as a guest on his radio show which was being taped on April 19, 1951 for broadcast on April 25 that year. As was customary, the songs to be used in the broadcast were taped in advance as a back-up in case the live broadcast versions did not go well. The song was so well received that Decca Records decided to issue the pre-recording commercially and it charted briefly in June 1951 with a peak position of #19. Crosby used the song in his concert performances in 1976 singing it with comedian Ted Rogers. The duet with Louis Armstrong is still heard frequently on radio.

The prison is operated by Her Majesty's Prison Service. On 16 October 2019, the Ministry of Justice announced that HMP Hewell's open site (the former HMP Hewell Grange) will close due to its current condition branded by inspectors as unacceptable and refurbishing would not deliver value for the taxpayer. https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/midlands-news/hmp-hewells-grange-set- close-17093457 History Hewell Prison is on the site of the Hewell Grange country house and estate, the former seat of the Earls of Plymouth and has open days for its park and garden.Hewell Grange Park and Garden ‚Äì Grade II* ‚Äì The estate was sold to the government c.1945 and in 1946 the main house was used as a Borstal. Over the years two other purpose-built prisons were built and opened on the estate: HMP Blakenhurst and HMP Brockhill, to hold other categories of prisoner, with enlargements. The Borstal itself was reclassified in 1991 to a Category D open prison, and renamed HMP Hewell Grange. The new 650-bed prison was operated by UK Detention Services, a partnership between Mowlem, Sir Robert McAlpine and Corrections Corporation of America. In January 2008, the Prison Service announced that the three prisons would merge to be managed by a single team. Its provisional name for public consultation was 'HMP Redditch', however local residents objected and in March 2008 it was decided to rename the site HMP Hewell. HMP Hewell was formally created on 25 June 2008, and is the first in an efficiency drive involving the creation of new Titan prisons in the United Kingdom. The Ministry of Justice closed the Brockhill part of the prison in September 2011. The closure formed part of wide-ranging cost saving, with one other prison shut in 2011. In July 2017 Tornado squads were brought in from outside to deal with a prison riot in House Block 6, A-spur. The riot was instigated following the commencement of a phased smoking ban, of which House Block 6 was the first to have the ban imposed; overcrowding, living conditions, unexplained lock-downs and lack of prison officer staff were all contributing factors. The rioters damaged water pipework, the CCTV system, and numerous cells were severely damaged. The trouble was confined to one area of the prison, that was back in the control of the prison officers within a few hours. The wing where the riot took place was deemed unfit for occupation due to the damage caused, and inmates housed in that area were either moved to other prisons or relocated to other cell blocks within Hewell. It took several weeks for the area to be brought back into use, following extensive renovations and works to repair the damage caused. The prison today One of the Category D site buildings Hewell is a multiple security category prison for adult males. Different categories (B, C, and D) of prisoners are housed in different sites. The prison primarily serves the Worcestershire, West Midlands and Warwickshire catchment area. Accommodation at the prison is divided into 6 house blocks. House block 8, which formerly referred to the \\"open\\" section of the prison, was recently closed, due to a damning report by inspectors https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/midlands-news/hmp-hewells-grange-set- close-17093457. Category B & C prisoners are employed in workshops providing Construction Industry Training, double glazing manufacture, industrial cleaning, waste management, laundry and contract services. Education offered includes ICT courses, ESOL, basic literacy and numeracy, art and cookery classes. Category D prisoners also have access to external college courses, Open University distance learning, as well as a range of ICT, literacy and numeracy courses. Employment is provided throughout the estate including: *Farms *Gardens *Kitchen *Full-time employment via a Resettlement to Work Scheme. In January 2017 an inspection report described Hewell as \\"a prison with many challenges and areas of serious concern\\". Prison inspector, Peter Clarke said, the \\"main concerns at the closed site were regarding issues of safety and respect\\". Clarke said levels of violence were \\"far too high\\", he described communal areas as \\"dirty\\" and claimed many cells were over-crowded, with some, \\"filthy\\". 60% said getting drugs was easy, a quarter of prisoners felt unsafe, and self harm had increased.HMP Hewell unrest brought under control by prison riot squads The Guardian In December 2017, ten people were convicted of smuggling a range of contraband into Hewell and other prisons following the chance filming of a wildlife program in adjacent fields. In 2019 a prisoner died of burns after smoking spice and setting himself on fire. The prisoner rang his bell but it took sixteen minutes before staff responded. The delay in responding contributed to the prisoner's death.HMP Hewell prisoner 'set himself on fire while smoking Spice' BBC On 16 October 2019, the Ministry of Justice announced that HMP Hewell's open site (the former HMP Hewell Grange) will close due to its current condition branded by inspectors as unacceptable and refurbishing would not deliver value for the taxpayer. https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/midlands-news/hmp-hewells-grange-set- close-17093457 See also * Hewell Grange References External links *Ministry of Justice pages on Hewell *HMP Hewell ‚Äì HM Inspectorate of Prisons Reports *Hewell Grange entry from The DiCamillo Companion to British & Irish Country Houses *HMP Brockhill ‚Äì HM Inspectorate of Prisons Reports * Category:Category B prisons in England Category:Category C prisons in England Category:Category D prisons in England Category:Prisons in Worcestershire Category:1946 establishments in England Hewell ","title":"HM Prison Hewell"},{"id":"21551546","text":"Albert Victor Baillie photographed by Walter Stoneman in 1932 The Very Rev.

The MOLST Program is an initiative to facilitate end-of-life medical decision- making in New York State, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Ohio and Maryland, that involves use of the MOLST form. Most other U.S. states have similar initiatives, such as Physician Orders for Life-Sustaining Treatment. In New York state, the MOLST form is a New York State Department of Health form (DOH-5003). MOLST is for patients such as a terminally ill patient, whether or not treatment is provided.[See, N.Y. Public Health Law section 2994-d For this example, assume the patient retains medical decision-making capacity and wants to die naturally in a residential setting, not in the intensive-care unit of a hospital on a ventilator with a feeding tube.

At a seance in Toronto in 1990, Liza (Meg Register) has a vision of the crucified nuns and falls screaming onto the floor. Several months later. Liza and Professor Evans (Brett Halsey), a respected archaeologist and her former professor, lead a survey team to Ancient Greek ruins on a site near the small town of Santa Rosalia, Sicily. The locals, including Porter (Al Cliver) and Turi (Lino Salemme) tell them to avoid the beautiful but ominous ruins of a monastery that overlooks the dig. Although Professor Evans reminds her that she should avoid any involvement with the supernatural after the seance in Toronto, Liza is fascinated by the morbid rumors about what had happened in the monastery. Ignoring Turi's angry rebuke, Liza enters the monastery crypt. Convinced that there is another chamber behind a wall, she uses a pick-axe to break into the cavern containing the charred remains of the five nuns. But when Liza tells Professor Evans what she has found, he angrily tells her to forget she saw anything. Soon, supernatural murders begin to take place. Porter is killed on his boat by a harpoon gun-wielding spectral nun. Two members of the archaeological team, Sean (Grady Thomas Clarkson) and Kevin (Pascal Druant), are lured into the ruins by enticing female voices and then killed when they fall through a weak floorboard and land into a pit of metal spikes. Eventually, Inspector Carter (Lucio Fulci) from Interpol arrives to investigate the deaths. Meanwhile, Liza pursues her investigation into the monastery She meets with a strange-looking woman (Carla Cassola) who tells her about what happened at the ruins centuries ago. The nuns practiced witchcraft and held orgies there as well. Local youths wound be invited there for sex, then murdered as they reached orgasm. The nuns would drink their blood in a satanic frenzy. If any one of the crazed nuns would become pregnant, they would carry their unwanted babies to full term, then throw the newborns onto a fire. After Liza leaves, the old woman is clawed to death by her pet cats. Professor Evans puts suspicion on Turi the butcher, who has openly threatened violence against the archaeologists. But that evening, Turi is killed in the freezer of his meat shop. Inspector Carter finds a piece of torn clothing clutched in Turi's right hand which apparently belonged to his killer. Now under suspicion himself for Turi's murder, Professor Evans decides the dig will be abandoned, but Liza, acting more and more strangely, refuses to leave. The next morning, the enraged townspeople attack the haunted ruins, Professor Evans tries to get his team clear. But he realizes that Liza and Robby, the young son of two team members, are missing. Robby has been kidnapped by a white-robed, faceless nun. He manages to escape but, just outside of the camp, sees his father ripped in two by a hidden trap. Professor Evans pursues Liza, who is dressed in a white robe and possessed by the spirits of the evil nuns, into the ruins. She stabs him in the stomach and then disappears like a ghost. The mob of townspeople charge into the hidden chamber. Liza reappears, foaming at the mouth on one of the crosses. The mob sets her and all the skeletal remains of the nuns afire. The wounded Professor Evans staggers into the cavern, pushing the mob members out of his way, to see Liza materialize at the foot of the burning crosses, no longer possessed but dead.

Circa 500-494 BCE. Syloson (, gen.: Œ£œÖŒªŒøœÉ·ø∂ŒΩŒøœÇ) governed Samos as a vassal ruler on behalf of the Achaemenid Persian Empire. He was appointed by king Darius I and was the brother of Polycrates of Samos. When Polycrates became tyrant of the island he exiled Syloson. Syloson went to Egypt, where he stayed until a \\"flame-coloured mantle\\" he was selling brought him in contact with Darius I of Persia. At the time Darius I of Persia was a spearman in Cambyses II of Persia's army. Syloson saw how much Darius liked the mantle and gave it to him for free. When Darius rose to power Syloson went to visit him in Susa. Darius offered him gold and silver for his kindness in the past with the mantle but Syloson refused and wanted military assistance in retaking Samos. \\"To me, O king, give neither gold nor silver, but recover and give me my fatherland Samos, which now that my brother Polycrates has been slain by Oroites is possessed by our slave.\\" Darius agreed and sent an expedition led by Otanes.http://classics.mit.edu/Herodotus/history.3.iii.html At the time when Syloson came back to the island of Samos, Maiandrios was holding rule but decided to give back power to the Samians and established a democracy. Maiandrios had fallen ill and his brothers Lycaretos and Charilaos were both trying to get possession of Samos. The Samians had welcomed Syloson when we came for the good legacy his brother had left. But Charilaos, after being released from prison, persuaded his brother to send mercenaries to attack the Persians. Maiandrios agreed because he loathed Syloson and escaped the island through a secret passage. With Charilaos commanding the mercenaries they were defeated in the uprising and the Persian commander Otanes, against Darius's orders, slew many Samians.Herodotus, The Histories, Book 3, Chapter 140 Syloson was succeeded by his son Aeaces.

It is a multi-level building that once housed the operations of the Lion Brothers embroidery company. The original building was constructed in 1885 and expanded several times over the subsequent 75 years. In 1958 the Lion Brothers moved their production facility to another location allowing Marcus & Farber and Globe Screen Printing to move in. The building has been vacant since 2002 and Cross Street Partners has plans to restore the building as a local innovation center. History The Lion Brothers Company was established in 1899, and originally located in a loft building at 109 South Charles Street. At first, the company produced a wide range of products including blouses, skirts, and sailor caps. It was one clothing factory among many in an extensive garment industry in the western portion of downtown. Their factory was destroyed in the 1904 Baltimore Fire, causing them to relocated to 875 Hollins St. At the time, the building was occupied by the John Cowan livery stable and hall. Cowan was an undertaker with a funeral home across the street at 1901 Hollins Street. Lion Brothers purchased the livery building in 1911, roughly the same time that all operations were concentrated on Hollins Street and the company was no longer producing finished clothing, but instead specializing in embroidered emblems. The location of the company in the Poppleton area of West Baltimore was a departure from other garment related industries centered in the downtown area. This location had several advantages: (1) it was removed from the heavily built up downtown area that had suffered the devastating 1904 fire; (2) an ample working-class labor pool surrounded the factory; (3) it was close to the factory's owners‚Äô residences located in the vicinity of Eutaw Place; and (4) the production of embroidered emblems and insignias was a distinct specialty that did not require immediate proximity to other garment- related businesses. The need for uniforms in the World War I era helped spur the growth and expansion of this company. By 1920, the company had outgrown the original three story building. Instead of relocating, they expanded to the north, eventually occupying nearly the entire block. An article in the Baltimore Evening Sun of January 14, 1920 announced the construction of the 1920 building, which doubled the plant capacity. The expansion made it the largest embroidery factory south of New York. Lion Brothers also purchased four sixteen-ton Sauer power looms for the enlarged facility for $72,000, nearly three times the cost of the new building. The prominent Baltimore architectural firm Smith & May designed the new building, which was built by the Price Construction Company at an estimated cost of $25,000 and was ready for occupancy in June 1920. The ground floor was used primarily for manufacturing equipment, while the upper floor was used for drafting and design, and hand embroidery, taking full advantage of the natural lighting provided by the large exterior windows and roof monitors. Within the next thirty years, the factory expanded three times. In 1935, an addition along Hollins Street virtually duplicated the 1920 addition. The 1983 addition on Boyd Street was similar to the earlier additions, but lacked the ceramic block insignia ornamentation and expansive column spacing of the earlier building. In 1948, an office and warehouse addition departed form the earlier design. This addition was announced in the July 1948 edition of Baltimore Magazine. In 1958, the company moved to a six-acre site in Owings Mills in Baltimore County. By that time, the company was the largest manufacturer of embroidered emblems in the world and employed 250 people, and remained under the ownership of the Lion family. After Lion Brothers moved to Owings Mills, the building sold in 1961 to Marcus & Farber, a clothing manufacturer. The painted signs on the chimney identify this firm. In 1978, the building was sold to Leon Zimmerman, owner of Globe Screen Printing. In 2002, Globe vacated the building and move to Woodlawn in Baltimore County. Lion Brothers Company Building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2006. In 2015, Cross Street Partners in affiliation with the University of Maryland BioPark and Innovation District planned to redevelop the structure for office and institutional space. In 2017, the University of Maryland, Baltimore County Intermedia and Digital Arts Graduate Program became one of the tenants of the complex.

Italy] lizard\\") is a genus of large ichthyosaur (a marine reptile, not a dinosaur) that lived during the middle Triassic period, approximately 235 million years ago. This marine reptile came from its own family Besanosauridae and was named by Dal Sasso and Pinna in 1996. The type of species is Besanosaurus leptorhynchus meaning \\"long-beaked reptile from Besano.\\" Description Restoration Besanosaurus skull Besanosaurus was a marine reptile nearly 6 meters in length and had a similar shape to dolphins. It had a thin snout, fairly small teeth, no dorsal fin, and a long and straight tail. It was an eel-like swimmer with moderate speed along with rapid acceleration and good maneuvering, and lived in tropical seas, in coastal, and Caribbean-like environments. Besanosaurs were carnivorous and fed mainly on small fish, cephalopods, and marine reptiles. The reptile's reproduction was ovoviviparous, meaning the eggs incubated inside the body and hatched at birth. Discovery Embryos The bones of Besanosaurus were first discovered in \\"Sasso Caldo\\" quarry in the spring of 1993 by the volunteers of the paleontological group of Besano, a small town in the Lombardy region of north Italy. The fossil was almost completely embedded in the rock and could be first seen only through x-rays; to detect the content of the 38 slabs of stone enclosing the skeleton, 145 radiographs were necessary. The skeleton of Besanosaurus came to light in the paleontological laboratory of Museo Civico di Storia Naturale di Milano after 16500 hours of preparation. The preparators removed the rock enclosing the fossil step by step, working under a stereo microscope with chisels, needles and pins. The 38 slabs were reassembled and a silicon rubber matrix was made, from which a cast of the original specimen was obtained.

The band originally formed in 1999 for a birthday celebration for band member Des Demonia's mother. The language of their songs varies between German, English, Latin, French and several old languages. The band split-up in December 2012; a group of member founded the Electro Folk Rock Band InVictus.Schelmish - Wir sind InVictus History The inspiration for forming of Schelmish was the birthday of Des Demonia's mother in 1999. Musically, Schelmish is rooted in Irish Folk. Today though they are rather oriented towards Mittelalter Rock. Their first CD Von R√§ubern, Lumpen und anderen Schelmen (Of Robbers, Rascals and other Scoundrels) was released in 2000. It features the original line-up of Schelmish and contains traditional medieval songs. The second CD Aequinoctium is also composed only of medieval songs. It was released in 2001. For the recordings, Balitur joined the band while Igerne and Buchanan departed. On Codex Lascivus, the third CD, released in 2002, the band's first original pieces can be heard. For this effort Amsel von Nydeggen (of Filia Irata), Fragor der Schlagfertige, Sakepharus der Schmierenkom√∂diant and Septimus joined the band, while, Morbius, Balitur and Bajonne left. This CD includes the instrumental Rotta, which since its release has traditionally been played at each of their concerts. Except for the absence of Septimus, the line-up for the fourth album Tempus mutatur is the same as on Codex Lascivus. Here they recorded for the first time a bonus track with electric guitars and bass. Michael Rhein of In Extremo appears as a guest singer for Veris Dulcis and Le p√¥vre Villon. It was released in 2003. After their four studio albums Schelmish produced a maxi single of Si salvas me containing three versions of Si salvas me, the hymn of Satzvey castle in Mechernich, plus another track. This maxi from 2003 is a preview of the subsequent studio album Igni Gena, which also features Si salvas me. Since this recording, Luzi das L has been a member of Schelmish, while Baccata left for health reasons. With the fifth CD Igni Gena of 2004 the band makes it obvious that their beat has been remarkably stepped as compared to their previous albums. Moreover there is a track Ich was ein Chint so wolgetan from Carmina Burana with slight influences from Hip hop/Rap. Again Michael Rhein of In Extremo appears as a guest singer. It also contains a medieval version of Johnny Cash's Ring of Fire with medieval instrumentation and vocals by Dextro. In 2005 Schelmish fulfilled their fans' wish for a live album and released a CD called Schelmish - Live. It contains the full live recording from the 29 January 2005 show at the Kulturfabrik Krefeld. Die Rote F√ºchsin (Red Vixen) of Filia Irata appears as guest musician while Amsel von Nydeggen is no longer part of the band. Two months later their first DVD Coetus was released. Among excerpts from the show at the Kulturfabrik Krefeld it contains material of several other shows (e.g. together with Das letzte Einhorn and Flex der Biegsame of In Extremo), two videos as a preview of the following album Mente Capti as well as numerous interviews, CD previews, photos, easter eggs and also a film about Schelmish. Moreover the DVD was seen as a farewell project for Amsel von Nydeggen. She can be seen in older show recordings and in the film. Also Die Rote F√ºchsin of Filia Irata is featured on this DVD.Band discography Mente Capti is the sixth studio album, which was released in July 2006. For the first time since Codex Lascivus the band has eight members because guitarist Marquis de Guis and den bassist Naj O, der Reine, (later replaced by Johannes, der S√§ufer) filled the ranks. While the band's previous albums were almost exclusively recorded with medieval instruments Mente Capti focused on a rock instrumentation, i.e. electric guitars and bass and a modern drum set. This way Schlemish re- interpreted old songs but also wrote new pieces that deal with love, melancholy and joy. The vocals were mainly Rimsbold's task while Dextro and Fragor concentrated on string instruments. Luzi and Des Demonia focused on wind instruments and Sakepharus on percussion. In early 2007 Sakepharus left the band to concentrate on his family. His leaving had been announced beforehand and at the same time Dschieses and Picus were accepted as new members. Also Johannes der S√§ufer left the band on 30 July 2007 and was replaced on the bass by Sideribus illustris. On 19 October 2007 the seventh album Wir werden sehen (We Shall See) was released and a tour was begun. Already in September Moor had been released as a single containing two album tracks and two additional recordings. In early 2008 Dschieses and Sideribus left the band for reasons of personal timing. Their successors are Samtron on the drums and Alexis de la Vega on the bass. After a period of almost seven years Fragor now left the ensemble in April 2008. After having been present on medieval shows only in 2007 and not on rock shows he then returned to private life.Filckr Group for Schelmish On 28 October 2009 the ninth album Die h√§sslichen Kinder (The Ugly Children) was released in Finland and Spain through Napalm Records.

Davies, was a Welsh economist,National Library of Wales, Welsh Biography Online, extracted 16 February 2009 industrialist,Why Not a Welsh Royal Family? by Si√¥n T Jobbins, January 2008, Cambria magazine prize winning essayist, author, political activist, pilot, and an internationalist. Davies was a world traveller before returning home to Wales. Initially a founding member of the Welsh Labour Party in the Ammanford district, in 1925 he left Labour becoming a founding member of Plaid Cymru, the nationalist party of Wales. According to the historian John Davies, it was D. J. Davies' ideas which were more influential in shaping long-term Plaid Cymru ideology following the Second World War, and Davies was as \\"equally [a] significant figure\\" as Saunders Lewis in Welsh nationalism history, but it was Lewis' \\"brilliance and charismatic appeal\\" which was firmly associated with Plaid Genedlaethol Cymru of the 1930s.John Davies, A History of Wales, Pages 591, 592John Davies, Wales and America Early life D. J. Davies was born the third child of Thomas Davies, a miner, and Ellen Davies (n√©e Williams) in Carmel, Carmarthenshire, Wales, on 2 June 1893. After attending local schools, Davies began working at age 14 in several collieries and at Barry Docks. Though working long hours, Davies continued his education by taking evening classes and through correspondence courses. World traveller In 1912 Davies emigrated to Canada and then to the United States where he worked in mines. Davies was a co-founder of the Northwestern Coal and Coke Company in Steamboat Springs, Colorado. \\"A colourful figure,\\" wrote professor John Davies, D. J. Davies travelled throughout the United States, became a boxer, attended Colorado State University-Pueblo, and then studied law at Seattle University in Washington. Following his studies, Davies travelled to Asia, spending time in Japan and China before returning to the US and joining the United States Navy as an engineer and pilot in 1918. Davies' membership in the US military, rather than the British military, was \\"a protest against the class bound attitudes of the officers of the British Army,\\" according to professor John Davies. While on leave from the US Navy in 1919, Davies returned to Wales and worked as a collier in Llandyb√Øe, until he was seriously injured in an accident. By 1920 Davies was discharged from the US Navy following his incapacitation the following year. Political activist During his \\"enforced leisure\\" resulting from the accident, wrote Dr. Ceinwen Hannah Thomas, Davies studied \\"economics, politics and the history of the Working Class Movement\\". Stirred into socialist political activism, Davies became a founding member of the Labour Party in the Ammanford district of Carmarthenshire. In 1924 Davies travelled to Denmark to attend the International People's College in Elsinore, and a Folk High School in Vestbirk, where \\"[Davies'] attitude towards the relationship between socialism and nationalism changed completely\\", according to Dr. Thomas. > \\"[Davies] came to believe that true internationalism was based on co- > operation between free nations, while the advancement of the Welsh working > class could only be secured in a free Wales. This point of view was > expressed months before the Welsh Nationalist Party (now Plaid Cymru) was > founded in 1925, while he was unaware of the existence of a nationalist > movement in Wales. He returned from Denmark a convinced nationalist in > favour of an economic policy of co-operation which placed ownership and > control of the means of production in the hands of the workers themselves\\".- > Dr. Ceinwen Hannah Thomas Of Davies' experience in Denmark, author Si√¥n T. Jobbins wrote \\"Impressed by that little country's ability to govern itself, the one-time member of the Independent Labour Party returned to Wales in 1924 a Welsh nationalist\\". Inspired by the Folk High Schools of Denmark, Davies and his new Irish bride No√´lle Ffrench, whom he had met at the International People's College, moved to Ireland to establish a Folk High School there. However, by 1925 their attempt proved unsuccessful, and the couple moved to Aberystwyth where Davies attended the Aberystwyth University, then known as University College of Wales (UCW). Also that year, Davies resigned from the Labour Party and became a founding member of the newly formed Plaid Genedlaethol Cymru, later known as Plaid Cymru; the Party of Wales. Davies graduated from UCW, Aberystwyth, with his Bachelor of Arts in economics in 1928, a Master of Arts in 1930, and a Doctor of Philosophy in 1931. Davies won consecutive awards at the National Eisteddfod of Wales in 1930, 1931, 1932, and 1934 on essays on economics and politics. Davies' economic essays were particularly inspired by US President Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal, \\"and year in year out the model he offered for the regeneration of depression-ridden Wales was the work of the Tennessee Valley Authority\\", according to Dr. Davies. In 1932, Davies and his wife again attempted to establish a Folk School in the Danish tradition, and bought the Pantybeil√Øau mansion at Gilwern in Monmouthshire. However this attempt also proved ultimately unsuccessful. Davies increased his participation within Plaid Cymru, contributing as an economic and political researcher, author of pamphlets and articles in the movement's publications, as well as writing articles in other mainstream Welsh and English language publications. However Davies and other leftist members of Plaid Cymru were increasingly disaffected by Plaid president Saunders Lewis. Davies objected to Lewis' economic policies, Lewis' rejection of capitalism and socialism, and at the party conference in 1938, Davies and other leftest members firmly rejected Lewis' concept of \\"perchentyaeth\\"; a policy of 'distributing property among the masses'. Additionally, Davies and many leftest Plaid members were deeply offended by the \\"readiness of prominent party members [such as Lewis] to see virtue in Mussolini and Franco\\". In 1939 Lewis resigned as Plaid Cymru president citing that Wales was not ready to accept the leadership of a Roman Catholic. Davies argued in favour of engaging English-speaking Welsh communities, and stressed the territorial integrity of Wales. Davies pointed towards Scandinavian countries as a model to emulate, and was active in the economic implications of Welsh self-government. In 1953, one-time republican Davies wrote an article in Y Faner publication strongly endorsing a Welsh constitutional monarch. Posthumously published in English in his book Towards Welsh Freedom in 1958, Davies advocated that an independent Wales would be better served by a Welsh constitutional monarchy, one which would engender the affection and allegiance of the Welsh people and legitimise Welsh sovereignty. An hereditary constitutional monarch would, he argued, embody and personify a Welsh national identity above party politics, while political parties formed governments in a parliamentary system similar to those of Denmark, Norway, or the Netherlands. Davies advocated for the elevation of a native Welsh gentry family, rather than inviting a foreign prince to the throne of Wales. Among the criteria for consideration, argued Davies, was that the family had to have a history of contributing to Welsh life and reside in Wales. In the 1950s, Davies and his wife No√´lle became deeply concerned over the dispute concerning the legal status of Monmouthshire, which some considered part of Wales while others considered part of England. \\"They lost no opportunity in demonstrating that it had always been an integral part of Wales,\\" wrote Dr.Thomas.

History 300px 270px 350px The precursors of the Belgian Hare were created in Belgium in the early 18th century, through the crossbreeding of early domestic rabbits with the wild European rabbit. The intent was to create a practical meat rabbit for small livestock. These rabbits were first imported to England in 1874, where they were dubbed the \\"Belgian Hare\\". Breeders there made the Belgian Hare more spirited and lithe, like the wild rabbits of England. By 1877 the first Belgian Hares were being shown in America, where the breed immediately rose in popularity. By 1898, the Belgian Hare boom was peaking. One shipping firm in England at the time stated in its annual report: \\"Over 6,000 Belgian Hares conveyed safely to the United States during 1900.\\" Numerous Belgian Hare clubs were formed across America and countless rabbits were bred. Because the novice breeders were unable to turn the lanky rabbit into a production meat breed, by 1902 the flooded market had gone bust. The first of these clubs was known as the \\"American Belgian Hare Association\\", but with a wide and scattered membership, it lasted not much more than a year. The \\"Boston Belgian Hare Club\\" was formed in 1880, and in 1897 the \\"National Belgian Hare Club of America\\" came into being. Twelve years later, as additional breeds were being introduced and developed in the US, a new \\"all-breed\\" club was formed, called the \\"National Pet Stock Association\\". After several name changes, this became today's American Rabbit Breeders Association (ARBA). With the passing of the National Belgian Hare Club many years prior, a dedicated group of breeders applied for a specialty club charter from ARBA, which was granted in July, 1972. The American Belgian Hare Club was born and continues to this day. Today, the Belgian Hare remains a \\"fancy\\" rabbit, with devoted followers in the UK as well as the US, where The Livestock Conservancy currently lists the breed's conservation status as \\"threatened\\". Appearance The Belgian Hare is most known for its distinctively close resemblance to a hare, with a long, fine body with muscular flank, and distinctly arched back with loins and well-rounded hind quarters. Their head is long and their tail straight and carried in line with the backbone. The fore feet of a Belgian Hare are usually long and fine-boned and perfectly straight, while their hind feet long are fine and flat. They are believed to be the only breed of domestic rabbit featuring a deep red, rich chestnut color of the Belgian Hare, together with black ticking of a wavy or blotchy appearance and an extended down the sides. In the USA, Rufus Red coloration is the only variety recognized. The BRC now recognizes both Black and Tan (called the Tan Hare), and Black Hares in addition to the Rufus Red. Lifestyle Due to their difference from other breeds of domestic rabbit, the Belgian Hare may require different dietary and housing requirements to other rabbits, and as a result, they may demand more attention and care. Due to their size and energetic nature, it is recommended that the Belgian Hare be provided with a large hutch or cage to enable them to move freely. For an outdoor rabbit the ideal home is a hutch with a waterproof roof, and raised off the ground. If the rabbit is going to live indoors then a hutch can also be used or a cage. Belgian Hares should have a cage with at least a 24 by 60-inch floor and a height of 24 inches. A breeding or brood cage should be 36 by 72 inches, at least. 200px All rabbits must have an adequate exercise area, whether it is an outside run or an enclosed area in the house. Softwood shavings should not be used for the floor of the hutch or cage as they can cause respiratory problems. Fine sawdust can cause eye irritations so this should be avoided. Bedding material should be provided especially in cold and wet weather for the outdoor rabbit. A recommended practise is to place the straw on top of a layer of the hardwood shavings in the sleeping compartment, in order to ensure warmth and insulation for an outdoor Belgian Hare. The rabbit home should be cleaned out weekly and any old food removed. If it is necessary to wash the home then only use a cleaner specifically designed for cleaning rabbit hutches. The Belgian Hare has a short coat and if kept clean, requires little grooming other than an occasional rub over to remove any dead coat. When in moult the coat benefits from a good combing through every other day to remove the old coat. This will help bring the new coat through faster and minimize the old fluffy undercoat matting up when its on the way out. Behaviour The Belgian Hare is one of the most intelligent and energetic rabbits. Rabbits can become trained to learn their name. Due to their active nature and alert temperament, they can very easily be startled by sudden noise or movement,Central Pets and a recommended practise by owners of this breed is to have a radio constantly playing near them, so they can get used to noise. As a result of their active personality, they have been called \\"the poor man's racehorse\\". The Belgian Hare is known to be responsive to handling, particularly when trained from an early age, however, it is recommended that the Belgian Hare should not be handled by children mainly due to their large size and speed that may cause injury. Diet 150px As the Belgian Hare has a very high metabolic rate, it may require more food and more consistent feeding than other breeds of domestic rabbit. The specific dietary requirements of a Belgian Hare do not differ significantly from other breeds of domestic rabbit, and like the majority of rabbits, the most important component of the diet of a Belgian Hare is hay, a roughage that reduces the chance of blockages and malocclusion whilst providing indigestible fiber necessary to keep the gut moving. Grass hays such as timothy are generally preferred over legume hays like clover and alfalfa. Legume hays are higher in protein, calories, and calcium, which in excess can cause kidney stones and loose stool. This type of hay should be reserved for young kits or lactating does. It is recommended that the Belgian Hare, like other rabbits, receive a standard intake of 2 cups of chopped dark, green, leafy vegetables per 6 pounds of body weight (although this should only be given after four months of age to prevent enteritis) and up to 2 tablespoons of fruit or carrots per 6 pounds of body weight daily. It is common for some owners to provide treats, although in very limited quantities, which can include a few pellets, a slice of strawberry, or other healthful foods. Commercial treats are available in the pet stores can be fed, but owners should stay away from anything with a yoghurt coating, or other ingredients that the rabbit would not encounter in the wild . Some of the vegetables that rabbits enjoy are romaine lettuce, escarole, turnips, collards, kale, parsley, thyme, cilantro, dandelion, and basil. The green, leafy tops of radish and carrots also are excellent sources of nutrients, but should be fed sparingly due to the high calcium content. New vegetables should be introduced slowly due to the delicate digestive systems of rabbits. It is recommended that cauliflower, broccoli and cabbage be avoided, as they cause gas and can lead to gastrointestinal stasis, which can be fatal. Vegetables such as potatoes and corn should also avoided due to their high starch content. Belgian Hares also require an unlimited amount of fresh water, usually provided for in a water crock, tip-proof ceramic pet dish, or hanging water bottle.

The senzala (\\"slave quarters\\") refers to the dwellings of the black working class, where they originally worked as slaves, and later as servants.

She was the wife of William Ernest Bush, the first and last Baron de Bush, and mother of Paulise de Bush, the \\"Baby Baroness\\". She is remembered for creating the role of Saida in Arthur Sullivan's 1898 Savoy opera The Beauty Stone. After a touring career as a child violinist, playing together with her pianist sisters in the U.S. and abroad in the 1880s, Joran began an opera career in England, which lasted through the 1890s. With her marriage to Baron de Bush in 1899, she retired from the stage. He was killed in an accident in 1903, and Joran lived quietly for some years, returning to society by 1910 as a hostess and patroness of music. Early life The Joran Quartet, circa 1884. Joran was born Clara Pauline Joran in Freeport, Illinois, the second of three daughters of Vienna-born Louis Grund Joran (1830‚Äì1901), a painter, and his wife, Mary Elizabeth n√©e Askew (1850‚Äì1933).

The troupe visited California, Hawaii and, by 1886, Australia. In Hawaii, they played for the last king, KalƒÅkaua. They returned to California in 1887 and then performed in Mexico and elsewhere. By 1890, the Jorans travelled to Europe to further their musical studies. Operatic career In London, as a debutante, Joran was recommended to the conductor Wilhelm Ganz. As a member of the New Meistersingers' Club in St James's Street, Ganz arranged musical soirees for which he held auditions for potential performers. He found that Joran played the violin well, and that she had a lovely soprano voice.Ganz, Wilhelm, Memories of a Musician, pp. 281‚Äì83 (1913) Ganz advised her to give up playing the violin and take to the operatic stage, as she was a very good-looking young woman with a beautiful figure. Nevertheless, Joran did not abandon the violin, playing Mendelssohn's G minor Violin Concerto in Liverpool in 1893 and, as late as December 1896, giving a concert at St James's Hall, London, as both violinist and vocalist.\\"Some Comments on Original Artists\\", Gilbertian Gossip no. 39, Winter 1992-93, online at The Gilbert and Sullivan Newsletter Archive Saida (Joran) and Simon (Henry Lytton) in The Beauty Stone.

The latter required her to sing and play the violin simultaneously, enabling her to showcase both her talents.The Musical Times, October 1892, p. 611 The Manchester Guardian wrote that she played the violin \\"like an angel\\" and then surprised her audience with the excellence of her singing.The Manchester Guardian, 29 September 1892, p. 8 Another tour with Carl Rosa followed, and Joran was given the opportunity to play several larger roles. She was soon engaged by Sir Augustus Harris to sing roles at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, and on tour.The Musical Times, October 1894, p. 692 Joran's roles over the next four years included Marguerite in Faust, the title role in Carmen, Eurydice in Orfeo, Nedda in Pagliacci, Alice Ford in Falstaff, Anita in La Navarraise, Lady Pamela in Fra Diavolo, and roles in Maritana, Cavalleria rusticana, Die Walk√ºre, Rom√©o et Juliette, The Lady of Longford, as well as the role of Gertrude in an opera bouffe called Il Maestro di Cappella at the Prince of Wales's Theatre.The Musical Times, June 1896, p. 383 An 1896 review said of her, \\"Mlle.

Enloe was born in South Carolina and sold popcorn before moving to North Carolina and taking up work with North Carolina Theatres, Inc. In 1953 he was elected to the City Council of Raleigh. Four years later he was elected Mayor. During his tenure the American South was permeated by civil unrest due to racial segregation. Considered a moderate on civil rights, Enloe criticized black demonstrators and resisted efforts to integrate the theaters he managed, but he eventually compromised and appointed a committee to oversee the desegregation of Raleigh businesses. He left office in 1963, but returned to the city council in 1971. He died the following year. William G. Enloe High School in Raleigh was named in his honor.  Biography  William Gilmore Enloe was born on June 15, 1902 in Rock Hill, South Carolina, United States. He started working by selling popcorn at the Bijou Theatre in Greenville when he was 12 years old. In 1927 he managed two theaters in Greensboro, North Carolina until November when he was transferred to Raleigh to manage two theaters there. He later became the eastern district manager for North Carolina Theatres, Inc./Wilby-Kincey Theaters. He spent a total of 55 years in cinema-related business and served as a director of the N.C. Association of Theater Owners.  Political career  In 1951 Enloe unsuccessfully sought a seat on the City Council of Raleigh, placing 10th in the primary election. Two years later he was elected to the body. In the spring of 1956 he was appointed to chair the \\"Let's Talk Sense Fund\\" to raise money for Adlai Stevenson II's presidential campaign. In August he attended the Democratic Party's national convention in Chicago in his capacity as a delegate. He was elected Mayor of Raleigh the following year, succeeding Fred B. Wheeler on July 1, 1957. That year he was also elected to the Executive Committee of the American Municipal Association, but he later left after choosing not to seek reelection. City councilman Jesse Helms disliked Enloe's leadership style, referring to him as the \\"Enloe Steamroller\\". Enloe initially stated he would not seek reelection as Mayor, but later reversed his position and re-secured the office in 1961, becoming the city's first mayor elected to a third term under its council‚Äìmanager government. That spring the City Council resolved to ban ice cream trucks from operating on Raleigh's streets. Enloe supported the measure, citing increased road traffic and safety concerns for children. A United Press International report brought the event national attention, and Enloe received letters from across the country both praising and criticizing the council's action. In January 1963 he declared with \\"mixed emotions\\" that he would not seek reelection to the city council in May and thus not continue to serve in his \\"strenuous and time-consuming\\" role as Mayor. His mayoral term ended on June 30, and he was succeeded by James W. Reid the following day. Enloe remained affiliated with North Carolina Theatres, Inc. during his mayoral tenure. In the spring of 1963 he led a successful lobbying effort in the North Carolina House of Representatives to defeat a bill that would require the state to observe daylight saving time. He also held the office of President of the North Carolina League of Municipalities, was a member of the Governor's School Study Commission, served as Secretary-Treasurer of the Mayors' Association of Wake County, was a member of the Executive Committee of the Governor's Highway Safety Conference, and served as chairman of the Raleigh School Board. In 1964 Enloe sought a seat in the North Carolina Senate for the 16th District. In the May 30 Democratic primary election he received 14,191 votes, narrowly placing third. In the second primary on July 11 he placed third by a wider margin and was defeated for the two Democratic nominations. In 1969 he unsuccessfully lobbied against the introduction of cable television services in Raleigh on the grounds that they would harm the theater business. He briefly served again as a Raleigh city councilman from 1971 until his death. = Civil rights issues = During his time as mayor, Enloe was considered moderate on the issue of race relations. In 1960 he criticized black students who participated in the Greensboro sit-ins in protest of racial segregation at lunch counters, calling it \\"regrettable that some of our young Negro students would risk endangering [black and white] relations by seeking to change a long-standing custom in a manner that is all but destined to fail.\\" In March he appointed a 15-member biracial committee to negotiate an end to desegregation demonstrations. The following month a white youth protesting segregated lunch counters in Raleigh was assaulted by a passerby. In response, Enloe convened an extraordinary session of the City Council to consider an ordinance that imposed restrictions on picketing, commenting that some demonstrators had been blocking the sidewalks in the downtown. The biracial committee announced the integration of lunch counters in August, prompting the mayor to comment, \\"I appreciate the spirit of cooperation shown by all concerned and am proud of the acceptance shown by our citizens.\\" In the spring of 1963 the American South was subject to a wave of violence, demonstrations, and mass arrests spurred by racial tension. In early May, several Raleigh protests resulted in dozens of detentions. Enloe, wanting to \\"avoid another Birmingham\\", appointed a biracial \\"Committee of One Hundred\\" to resolve the city's civil rights issues. Most of Raleigh's businesses were desegregated within the following year. Among the targets of some anti-segregation demonstrators were cinemas owned by North Carolina Theatres, which were designed to accommodate Jim Crow-era segregation with separate seating arrangements. Enloe initially resisted the integration efforts. Student activists felt he was resistant to change and unwilling to support integration. In 1961 he, in his capacity as district manager for North Carolina Theatres, negotiated the integration of the Carolina Theatre in Chapel Hill with the Chapel Hill Human Relations Committee, thus allowing it to become the first all-white movie theatre in the South to desegregate. A standoff between him and protesters over the Ambassador Theater in Raleigh prompted Enloe to announce his intention to resign from office. He only withdrew his resignation after negotiations with black community leaders which were mediated by City Councilman John W. Winters. Eventually, in a meeting with United States Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy and the head of his cinema company, it was agreed to begin the desegregation of the cinemas he managed, starting with those in Greensboro, then Winston-Salem, Charlotte, Durham, and finally Raleigh.  Health issues and death  In August 1964 Enloe was hospitalized for a blood clot in his left eye. He suffered a heart attack on November 2, 1972 while attending a North Carolina League of Municipalities convention in Greensboro. He died 20 days later at Rex Hospital in Raleigh. He is buried next to his wife, Ruth Erskine Enloe, in Raleigh's Historic Oakwood Cemetery.Historic Oakwood Cemetery (Raleigh, North Carolina), William Gilmore Enloe footstone, accessed May 14, 2017 They had a son, William G. Enloe Jr., and a daughter, Ruth Enloe.  Legacy  right In 1961, the Raleigh School Board voted to name a new school after Enloe. William G. Enloe High School opened the following year. Following his exit from mayoral office, the Raleigh Rotary Club and the First Presbyterian Church (of which he was a parishioner) awarded him with plaques commemorating his service to the city of Raleigh. Both organizations specifically praised his handling of local racial issues. In 2010 the Wake County Public School Board voted to terminate a long- standing busing policy meant to increase schools' racial diversity. The decision generated criticism from the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) and from historian Timothy Tyson, who emphasized that desegregation had been achieved with much difficulty in Raleigh and cited Enloe's statement on the participants in the Greensboro sit-ins as evidence. In response, members of the school board suggested that they would consider renaming Enloe High School after an African-American. Board Chairman Ron Margiotta stated Enloe was a segregationist. The editorial board of The News & Observer, Raleigh's daily newspaper, called the label \\"entirely unfair,\\" reasoning that \\"[t]he mayor declined to get out too far ahead of his white constituents as attitudes and practices evolved, but he did his part to facilitate change.\\" The editors also stated that Enloe \\"was just the sort of moderate leader who helped the city navigate those treacherous times, when the push for integrated public facilities came to shove.\\" Historian Jim Leloudis characterized Enloe as a \\"moderate\\" who, though having to be pressured to implement integration, abstained from using strict measures to control civil rights protesters. Margiotta subsequently asked another member of the school board, John Todesco, to research Enloe's stances on civil rights. Meanwhile, several Enloe High School students and alumni who disapproved of the board proposal created a Facebook group that opposed a name change, garnering the support of over 800 people. NAACP members stated that they were not seeking such an action, and NAACP leader William Barber II maintained that Tyson's remarks were only meant to contextualize the history of segregation in Wake County schools. In the face of growing criticism, Todesco stated that the board would not remove Enloe's name from the school unless something \\"horrid\\" about him was uncovered.

It was a member of the Delta family of rockets. Several variants existed, which were differentiated by a four digit numerical code. Configurations The first stage was the RS-27 powered Extended Long Tank Thor, first flown on the 2000-series. Three or nine Castor-4 solid rocket boosters were attached to increase thrust at lift-off, replacing the less powerful Castor-2 boosters used on earlier models. Two second stages were available; the Delta-P, which had been flown on the Delta 1000 and 2000 series, or the Delta-K, an uprated version with the Aerojet engine. Some launches used a three-stage configuration in order to reach higher orbits. A Star-37D, Star-37E, or Star-48B PAM-D could be used as an upper stage. Launches with PAM-D upper stages were designated Delta 3XX0 PAM-D, rather than assigning a code to the upper stage for use in the four- digit sequence. From the 4000-series onwards, the PAM-D received the upper stage code \\"5\\", however this was not applied retrospectively to 3000-series rockets, which were still in service at the time. The Delta 3000 could put a payload of 954 kg (2,103 lb) to a GTO.astronautix.com, dela3000 History The Delta 3000 was launched from Space Launch Complex 2W at Vandenberg AFB and Launch Complex 17A and B at Cape Canaveral. Of the 35 launches, there were two complete and one partial failure. The first, Vehicle 134 lifted from LC-17A at Cape Canaveral on September 13, 1977 with an Italian-built OTS communications satellite. Fifty-two seconds after liftoff, the Delta exploded. Booster and satellite debris were dredged from the sea bottom and it was ultimately discovered that a hairline crack in one SRB motor caused exhaust gas to escape and burn through the Delta's RP-1 tank, igniting the propellant. When the booster had been assembled on the pad the previous May, a handling accident occurred with the SRB motors that apparently damaged one of them. The payload fairing disintegrated at vehicle breakup and the OTS satellite was ripped apart by aerodynamic loads. Parts of the solar panels, batteries, and hydrazine propellant tanks were recovered from the ocean. There had been an upper stage failure of a Delta 2000 series in April and three weeks later, an Atlas-Centaur exploded 55 seconds after liftoff. NASA was particularly vexed by the string of accidents in 1977 because they had had a perfect run the year before (16 launches in 1976 without a failure). While this record (three failures out of 16 NASA launches during 1977) would have been acceptable in the 1960s, it was not welcomed at all in the late 1970s after the early \\"Wild West\\" days of the space program had passed and the hardware was supposed to be mature. The second Delta 3000 failure, Vehicle 150, was launched on December 7, 1979 but its Satcom communications satellite remained trapped in low earth orbit when the third stage failed to ignite. The third, Vehicle 178, launched on May 3, 1986 with a GOES weather satellite. This was televised on CNN to mark NASA's first launch since the Challenger Disaster four months earlier, but proved to be a serious embarrassment to the program. At 5:18 PM EST, Delta 178 lifted from LC-17A. All went entirely normal until T+71 seconds when the first stage engine abruptly cut off. With no attitude control, the launch vehicle quickly started tumbling out of control. The satellite and third stage were stripped off by aerodynamic forces, followed by loss of booster telemetry data. At T+91 seconds, the Range Safety officer sent the destruct command. Initial examination of telemetry revealed no obvious explanation for the main engine cutoff. All booster systems had operated satisfactorily up to that point, and engine shutdown occurred without any prior warning. Following the loss of telemetry data at T+80 seconds, film and photographic data confirmed that the solid rocket boosters had continued operating until final destruct, and that the second stage propellant tanks also ruptured from aerodynamic forces. More detailed telemetry examination ultimately traced the failure to a massive electrical short in the first stage. Two voltage spikes in the power system caused a sudden major load on the first stage battery, which ordinarily supplied 9 amps of power, but momentary shot up to 188 amps, a more than 2000 percent increase that quickly drained it and resulted in loss of the electrical current used to keep the engine valves open. Investigators ultimately traced the incident to a damaged wiring harness; there had recently been a switch from polyvinyl chloride wire insulation to Teflon. Because engineers had not taken into account the shape of the wiring harness when this modification was made, it banged against other components inside the first stage due to vibration during launch. The insulation was then rubbed off the wires, exposing them and allowing a short to occur. The loss of GOES-G had been a blow to the NOAA's weather satellite network, but this was partially compensated for in September when an Atlas successfully launched a NOAA-G satellite from Vandenberg Air Force Base. During the first half of the 1980s, the rate of Delta launches drastically declined due to the space shuttle taking a large part of its missions. Orders for the booster slowed to a trickle and McDonnell-Douglas came close to completely shutting down production. 1985 was the first year since the Delta family's introduction in 1960 that no launches took place, but the Challenger Disaster brought about a renewed need for disposable launch vehicles and orders soon picked up again. While only a handful of Delta launches took place in 1986-88, nine flew in 1989 and the 1990s would see a busy schedule most years except 1994-95 (seven launches during those two years). Delta 178 was largely the result of poor quality control due to plans for eventually phasing out ELVs in favor of the space shuttle - most of the engineers who worked on the program had left and one senior McDonnell-Douglass engineer remarked that 178 had \\"the worst quality control I ever saw on a Delta vehicle\\". Because it was assumed that the Delta would soon be retired from use, complaints about the poor assembly quality went unheard. After the accident, a thorough investigation of wiring systems in various ELV families was undertaken, which discovered that, among other things, the Delta had thinner wiring insulation than Titan, Atlas, and other launch vehicles. Moreover, Teflon insulation had the unique ability of melting and re-fusing when heated by electrical arcs. Eventually however, a short occurred that overpowered the Teflon's \\"self healing\\" ability.

History  In 1983 the independent cultural centre \\"Les Halles de Schaerbeek\\" (Brussels, Belgium) organised a weekend of discussions in Brussels to enable European independent cultural centres to exchange experiences and participate in events under the theme of \\"Adventures of the rediscovered ark\\". This three-day forum focused on an alternative culture emerging in rehabilitated industrial buildings, and asserting its identity despite the reservations of political authorities. Seven centres from seven European cities took part in this initial meeting. That first international meeting in 1983 was the seed of what nowadays is Trans Europe Halles (TEH), the European-based network of cultural centres initiated by citizens and artists, that currently gathers together around eighty members and associated organisations in almost thirty countries. TEH members are cultural centres emerged from civil society initiatives that have a multidisciplinary artistic policy encouraging interaction between art forms, with an emphasis on contemporary art. One of the common and most defining characteristics of these centres is that they are based on industrial or commercial buildings that have been adapted to artistic and cultural uses. Besides this, they are very diverse in terms of geographical location, size, inspirational backgrounds, funding models, artistic programmes, etc.  Organization & Structure   Members  Trans Europe Halles has currently almost 60 members and 17 associate organisations in 29 European countries. Most of Trans Europe Halles centres are established in buildings from industrial heritage, from factories and warehouses to dairies and army barracks. All Trans Europe Halles centres are multidisciplinary, but their main artistic disciplines as well as their regular activities vary a lot. To become a TEH Member, applicant cultural centres must fulfil the following membership criteria: #To be an independent and not-for-profit centre arising from a citizen‚Äôs initiative with a legal structure. #To have a multidisciplinary artistic policy encouraging interaction between art forms, with an emphasis on contemporary art. #To be based in user-friendly buildings preferably originating from a commercial or industrial heritage. #To have a high-quality artistic programme of at least regional significance with an awareness of contemporary culture, ranging from local to international art. #To be aware of the social and political aspects of cultural actions with an Equal Opportunities Policy or commitment.  Governance and Management  TEH is run in a decentralised way; the member centres participate in the decision-making of the network during the network meetings. Each centre has one vote regardless of its size or economic status. The Executive Committee, selected biannually, is the governing and policy making body of the network. The members of Trans Europe Halles meet twice a year during TEH Meetings. Decisions are made at the General Assembly of each meeting. During the Spring meeting a formal General Assembly is held with the approval of final accounts, election of Executive Committee and approval of the yearly budget. Each member has one vote regardless of the size of the centre. Trans Europe Halles‚Äô Executive Committee is the governing and policy making body of the network. It consists of a minimum of five and a maximum of eight people and is elected for two years at a time. The Trans Europe Halles Coordination Office is located at the cultural centre Mejeriet in Lund, Sweden. With a broad and multi-lingual membership and an intense flow of information and ideas, the Trans Europe Halles Coordination Office is a crucial hub. The Coordination Office is responsible for internal and external communication of the network and publishes the monthly TEH Newsletter. The Coordination Office also supports project-planning and fundraising activities for the network and has become a focal point of expertise within the network.  Activities   Meetings  Organised twice a year and hosted by a different member centre each time, the TEH meetings are a source of inspiration and a birthplace for new collaborations. It is also the opportunity for our members to meet and discover new countries and new cultural centres. The activities and programme are all of interest of the participants, with a strong focus on capacity building. During three days, participants are invited to take part to workshops, seminars, lectures, and networking sessions. On the last day of each meeting, an outing is organised for the participants to get to know more about the local culture.

It is distinctive from other food-related areas of study such as nutrition, agriculture, gastronomy, and culinary arts in that it tends to look beyond the consumption, production, and aesthetic appreciation of food and tries to illuminate food as it relates to a vast number of academic fields. It is thus a field that involves and attracts philosophers, historians, scientists, literary scholars, sociologists, art historians, anthropologists, and others.  State of the field  This is an interdisciplinary and emerging field, and as such there is a substantial crossover between academic and popular work. Practitioners reference best- selling authors, such as the journalist Michael Pollan, as well as scholars, such as the historian Warren Belasco and the anthropologist Sidney Mintz. While this makes the discipline somewhat volatile, it also makes it interesting and engaging. The journalist Paul Levy has noted, for example, that \\"Food studies is a subject so much in its infancy that it would be foolish to try to define it or in any way circumscribe it, because the topic, discipline or method you rule out today might be tomorrow‚Äôs big thing.\\"  Research questions  Qualitative questions that are wrestled with include: What impact does food have on the environment? What are the ethics of eating? How does food contribute to systems of oppression? How are foods symbolic markers of identity? At the same time practitioners may ask seemingly basic questions that are nonetheless fundamental to human existence. Who chooses what we eat and why? How are foods traditionally prepared‚Äîand where is the boundary between authentic culinary heritage and invented traditions? How is food integrated into classrooms? There are also questions of the spatialization of foodways and the relationship to place. This has led to the development of the concept of \\"foodscape\\" \\\\- introduced in the early 1990s - and the related practice of foodscape mapping. Discussion of these questions has increased as a result of public concern about issues which have arisen as a result of the emergence of a vast array of novel food technologies throughout the last century, ranging from chemical fertilizers to GMOs. Pursuers of food studies approach these questions by first understanding the scientific, economic, and philosophical issues surrounding them.  Institutions  One branch of this community has organized itself as The Association for the Study of Food and Society. This group hosts an annual conference (along with the Agriculture, Food, and Human Values Society); it publishes an interdisciplinary journal, Food, Culture, and Society; and it maintains an email listserv with over a thousand members for discussion of food-related topics. ASFS maintains a list of institutions granting food studies related degrees. A few schools have programs in the field, including Julia Child and Jacques Pepin founded Boston University's Gastronomy Masters program and New York University's program in Nutrition, Food Studies, and Public Health. The Department of Anthropology at Indiana University has recently started a food studies concentration within their program, leading to a PhD in Anthropology, while The New School is developing an undergraduate program in Food Studies. Prof. Fabio Parasecoli is the Coordinator of Food Studies at the New School in New York City. Indiana University began offering a PhD track in Food Anthropology in 2005, and an undergraduate minor in the anthropology of food in 2007, followed quickly by the IU Geography Department, which now also offers an MA and PhD in Food Systems. In 2016 the Collins Living-Learning center at IU started offering an undergraduate certificate in Food and Sustainability. At the same time the University has established the IU Food Institute, to house a growing interdisciplinary Food Studies research group, chaired by Profs. Peter Todd and Richard Wilk. Syracuse University offers a Bachelor of Science or minor in food studies at the undergraduate level and a Masters of Science or Certificate of Advance Study (CAS) at the graduate level. With a systems perspective grounded in political economy, food studies at Syracuse University is a full stand-alone program with dedicated faculty, a dynamic and devoted group of students, a physical home - including extensive teaching kitchens, community partners including farms, food businesses, government agencies, and not-for-profit organizations, complementary programs on campus, and a growing list of professional contacts nationwide. Chatham University Master of Arts in Food Studies. The Masters of Arts in Food Studies emphasizes a holistic approach to food systems, from agriculture and food production to cuisines and consumption, providing intellectual and practical experience from field to table. Prof. Alice Julier is the Coordinator of Food Studies at Chatham University. The University of Oregon in Eugene, USA, has recently launched a graduate specialization in food studies, and is aiming for a 2014 launch of an undergraduate degree. University of the Pacific, San Francisco has the only Master of Arts in Food Studies program on the West Coast. It is multidisciplinary and the curriculum encompasses food history, food writing, food production, food scarcity and justice, and food industry management and business. In addition to graduate seminars, faculty leads field visits to area restaurants, farms and food processing facilities. Ken Albala, a food historian and director of program is the author or editor of 23 scholarly and popular books on food. He writes, ‚ÄúOur goal is to engage students in the dynamism that is the Bay Area food and farming scene, while making connections with leaders throughout the food system. This is a great opportunity for people with an interest in food and food-related issues to earn a master‚Äôs degree in something they feel passionate about.\\" In Italy, the American University of Rome offers a US- accredited 15-month Master in Food Studies with a strong international dimension focused on the linkages between food and the environment and policies for sustainable production, consumption and diets. The Technological University Dublin, Ireland (previously Dublin Institute of Technology), offers a Master of Arts in Gastronomy and Food Studies that focuses on three pillars: History, Society and Practice. The two-year part-time programme - first of its kind in Ireland - features masterclasses, workshops, guest speakers, field trips and meal experiences and includes such courses as Global Cultural History of Food, Politics of the Global Food System, Food Writing and Media, History of Irish Food, Reading Historic Cookbooks, Social Approaches to Wine and Beverage Culture, Food Tourism, and Consumer Culture and Branding. In the United Kingdom, SOAS, University of London has offered a master's programme in the Anthropology of Food since 2007. The course offers students the opportunity to study food on a variety of levels, ranging from the domestic to the international. The institution is also home to the SOAS Food Studies Centre, an interdisciplinary research centre focused on furthering the academic study of food. Queen Margaret University in Edinburgh, Scotland has launched a new master's degree in Gastronomy. This is a unique qualification and the first of its kind in Scotland, which allows students to engage with the broad range of issues connected with food, provenance, diet, health, and nutrition. The degree is not just about food, but also delves deeper to consider food culture within the contexts of anthropology, environment, sustainability, politics and communications. Food & History is a multilingual (French, English, German, Italian and Spanish) scientific journal that has been published since 2003 as the biannual scientific review of the (IEHCA) based in Tours (linked to the Universit√© Fran√ßois Rabelais). Even study abroad programs have created new, interdisciplinary food studies programs, among them Palazzo Rucellai in Florence and The Umbra Institute in Perugia. Gustolab International is another institution which offers research internships and courses in sustainable production and consumption, food and media, food waste, advertising, science and nutrition, new technologies, and the history of food in Italy, Japan and Vietnam. To be mentioned also is the Pollenzo-based (near Bra, Cuneo, Italy) University of Gastronomic Sciences, the Institut Europ√©en d'Histoire et des Cultures de l'Alimentation (of Tours, France, mentioned above) and FOST: Social and Cultural Food Studies of the Vrije Universiteit Brussel (Belgium), providing education in bachelor, master or postgraduate studies. Numerous presses publish academic and popular books about the cultural significance of food, some of which are Columbia University Press, University Press of Mississippi, the University of Nebraska Press, University of California Press, the University of Illinois Press, the MIT Press, Bloomsbury Academic, Rowman & Littlefield, Berg, Earthscan, Routledge, Prospect, and Equinox Publishing.  Food insecurity and health outcomes  In America, almost 50 million people are considered food insecure. This is because they do not have the means to buy healthy food, therefore, lead an unhealthy lifestyle. At least 1.4 times more children who are food insecure are likely to have asthma, compared to food-secure children. And older Americans who are food-insecure will tend to have limitations in their daily activities. When a household is lacking the means (money) to buy proper food, their health ultimately suffers. Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP, formerly known as the Food Stamp Program) is put in place to help families in need to get the proper nutrition they need in order to live a healthy lifestyle. There are 3 points that make a household eligible for SNAP. One, is their gross monthly income must be 130% of the federal poverty level. The second point they have to meet is being below poverty. And the last thing is they have to have assets of less than $2,000 except that households with at least one senior and households that include at least one person with a disability can have more assets. Multiple studies have shown SNAP as being successful in reducing poverty. The major part of this research was examining children's food insecurity, the effect of this have greatly affected a child's performance. Due to food insecurity also runs the risk of possibly birth defects ‚Äú5 anemia, 6,7 lower nutrient intakes, 8 cognitive problems, 9 and aggression and anxiety.‚Äù As opposed to children in food-secure households, ‚Äúchildren in food-insecure households had 2.0-3.0 times higher odds of having anemia, 6, 7 2.0 times higher odds of being in fair or poor health, 8 and 1.4-2.6 times higher odds of having asthma, depending on the age of the child.‚Äù Non senior adult had less research done on them in regards with the impacts of food insecurity ‚Äúhowever, some of the studies in this limited set have shown that food insecurity is associated with decreased nutrient intakes; 20-25 increased rates of mental health problems and depression,10,26-30 diabetes, 31, 32 hypertension, 33 and hyperlipidemia; 32 worse outcomes on health exams; 33 being in poor or fair health; 23 , 34 and poor sleep outcomes 35.‚Äù Mothers who are food insecurity tend to be twice as likely to report mental health issues as well as oral health problems. Food and education Food and school are two interconnected topics. Children spend a large part of their day in school, so the food that is served in and around school greatly influences eating habits. Fast food in particular has proven to affect school children's health. Fast food marketing targets children. In the United States, more than 13 million children and adolescents are obese. Obesity prevalence was 13.9% among 2- to 5-year-olds, 18.4% among 6- to 11-year-olds, and 20.6% among 12- to 19-year-olds. The close proximity of fast food restaurants to schools has been speculated be one of the reasons for such high childhood obesity. in California, students with fast food restaurants within a half mile from their schools are more likely to be overweight, and are less likely to eat healthier foods. Fast food restaurants are also concentrated around schools in Chicago, increasing the risk of poor food choices for school children there. Research has shown that at least 80% of schools in Chicago have at least one fast food restaurant 10 minutes away. The close proximity of fast food restaurants to schools exposes US children to unhealthy, cheap meals that they can easily get to and from school, increasing the chances of childhood obesity. The influence of food on school children can also be a positive thing. Schools are being used to advocate for obesity prevention, since nutrition has been proven to be linked to academic performance. The overweight students do not perform as well academically, and also deal with health related issues that take away from school time. To combat this, schools are working to help their students. 83% of public and private schools provide breakfast and lunch programs that serve nutritious food up to federal standards, and these programs are proven to be beneficial for students' nutrition. The prevalence of competitive foods in schools are still providing students with unhealthy foods. Competitive foods are the foods that are for sale to students besides the federal meals. Usually these foods are high in fat and sugar, and access to vending machines allows for students to have sugary drinks as well. A 2003 California High School Fast Food Survey found that about one-fourth of 173 districts served brand name fast food from Subway, Domino's, Pizza Hut, and Taco Bell. These foods are reached for more than the healthier options. Parents and the public have raised concerns about the health impacts of the competitive food in schools. Healthier food costs schools more to buy, so the concern of losing revenue influences the purchase of cheaper, less healthy options. Even so, schools in Maine, California, Minnesota, and Pennsylvania were able to replace sugary drinks with healthier options without losing revenue. School nutrition programs have also helped fight poor eating habits of students with the support of parents and school administrators. Making it Happen! School Nutrition Success Stories is a program that provides healthier alternative foods to schools. Schools have been doing their part by changing food contracts, promoting better eating, and fundraising for better student health.  Food industry and economy  The food industry has a rapid rate of increasing sectors such as restaurants and fast food places that impact the economy in the long and short run. There are many people involved behind a successful business. In the food industry, the workers that are involved include servers, waiters, chefs, farmworkers and all restaurant workers. The issue is that some of these workers are paid minimum wage for all the effort they put in. The work individuals do involves picking fruits and vegetables that are served in the meal, they make the food, serve it to the consumers and wash dishes. These workers deal with working conditions, aspirations and labor practices. But these workers specifically have to deal with poor working conditions such as unsanitary kitchens which affect the food that is served to the consumers and can negatively impact their health. This allows the society to see from the perspective of how the workers and their relationship to the food can be demonstrated as multiple meanings for them because they live off of it. These people include immigrant restaurant owners and mobile food vendors. Ellen Kossek and Lisa Burke did a research on ‚ÄúDeveloping Occupational and Family Resilience in US Migrant Farm Workers‚Äù which explained how the migrant workers in the agriculture industry face tough circumstances in their work and home environment. The other conditions besides low work wages include difficult working conditions, health problems, not well suited housing, family issues and children's lives impacted negatively. These conditions are categorized as 'acculturative stress' but the goal is to maintain a healthy and better life which does not have a negative impact on family relations and job performance. One of the findings from the research was that the farm work mothers who had an infant in the Migrant Head Start Program, those ladies performed better in their household and at work. There can be programs developed as a solution to the problem with the goal of improving social networks for the migrant farmworkers and better education systems for the children. The benefits of creating these programs will help in improving work, childcare and housing conditions for farmworkers and their families. The issue is that they have to move constantly based on the season because there are limited opportunities. Another study was done by Saru Jayaraman and Sean Basinski who focused on this issue. In \\"Feeding America: Immigrants in the Restaurant Industry and Throughout the Food System Take Action for Change,\\" they provide data which looks at the working conditions and poverty rates that affect the workers. There were efforts made by Restaurant Opportunities Centers United to better wages, benefits and opportunities to advance. These studies allow us to see the workers experiences and the conditions they deal with. Our goal should be to get involved and make a healthy and sustainable industry.

The team formed in the wake of the dissolution of the Louisville Bourbons of the short-lived American Football League of 1934. Organized and owned by American Standard, Inc., the team was coached by AS plant manager H.M. \\"Harry\\" Reed; its name and colors (green and gold) come from one of the products sold by American Standard.John E. Kleiber, The Encyclopedia of Louisville (University Press of Kentucky 2001) The Tanks played their home games at Parkway Field in Louisville, Kentucky, USA. A charter member of the Midwest Football League (which evolved into the American Football League of 1938), the Tanks' first four seasons ended with league championships.Kenosha Cardinals: Life on the Fringe (1983) In 1939, after the AFL added the Cincinnati Bengals, Los Angeles Bulldogs (both formerly of the second major American Football League), and the Columbus Bullies (an independent team), the Tanks had the only losing season in their existence (1939), finishing in last place in the newly renamed American Professional Football Association.George Gipe, The Great American Sports Book (Doubleday 1978) The APFA announced its intention to become a major league in early 1940 and added a team from Milwaukee, but its ambitious plans crumbled in July, when Cincinnati, Columbus, and the new Milwaukee team defected to a new major American Football League. The APFA was mortally wounded as Louisville and the Dayton Bombers announced that they would not field teams for the 1940 season. The Tanks, the Bombers, and the APFA did not return to the field. Origin, the Midwest Football League, and the American Football League Formed to fill the vacuum formed by the departure of the Louisville Bourbons, the Tanks wasted no time in becoming a charter member of the Midwest Football League in 1935. The Tanks shared the 1935 championship with the Cincinnati Models and the Indianapolis Indians, two teams that disappeared within the next couple of years. Louisville then dominated the league in 1936 and 1937, winning the championship title outright in both seasons. In the 1937 contest, which was played on Sunday, December 12, the Tanks hosted the Cincinnati Models in the championship game, with the Tanks prevailing 13-0 behind touchdowns from Edward Crum and \\"Ripper\\" Roberts. [Original game program & scoresheet, personal collection] The time between the end of the 1937 and beginning of the 1938 campaign saw much change involving the Tanks. The second major league AFL disbanded, and the freshly expanded Midwest League quickly adopted the name of the recently deceased league. While the new AFL was still asserting that it was strictly a midwestern league with no major league ambition, its footprint expanded to include Chicago and Nashville. While the Tanks finished the regular season in third place with a four-win, three-loss record (behind the Chicago Indians and the newly reformed St. Louis Gunners (four years after the latter playing in the National Football League), the Tanks won the championship in the first system of playoffs in a minor professional football league. In a Shaughnessy playoff, the Tanks beat Chicago 13-0 and St. Louis 3-0 to claim the team's fourth title in its fourth year of existence.  American Professional Football Association and demise  The year 1939 was the fifth year of the Tanks' existence, still with their original owners and their original (head) coach, and still in the league which they helped form in their first days of their existence. The former Midwest Football League, on the other hand, changed its name for the second consecutive year (to the American Professional Football Association) as it hinted at being more than a midwestern minor league as it added the Cincinnati Bengals and Los Angeles Bulldogs of the second major AFL and a powerful independent team that would later dominate another pro football league: the Columbus Bullies. The Tanks' string of winning seasons - and league championships - ended at four as they finished in last place with a 2-9 record. The three newcomers finished in the top three positions. The following year started with both optimism and surprise for the APFA membership. The Columbus Bullies were declared the champions with a 9-4 record despite the Los Angeles Bulldogs' losing only a single game (7 wins, 1 loss) and the Cincinnati Bengals' having a 6-2 record.The Bulldogs: L.A. Hits the Big Time - Bob Gill, Pro Football Research Association (1982) Milwaukee was admitted as the replacement for the Bulldogs, who left to form the Pacific Coast Professional Football League... and the league admitted to its having major league aspirations as the Green Bay Packers protested the APFA's intrusion into its territory. By July, it was all over as Cincinnati, Columbus, and Milwaukee left the loop to become the charter members of a new American Football League. Louisville and the Dayton Bombers announced that they were not fielding teams for 1940... and the APFA folded. The Tanks and the Bombers never returned to the gridiron.

Recording German Afternoons was Prine's second release on Oh Boy Records, the independent label he formed with his manager Al Bunetta, and delves further into the country-flavored sound established on his 1984 release Aimless Love. Like Aimless Love, German Afternoons was co-produced by Nashville veteran Jim Rooney but also features contributions from the progressive bluegrass band New Grass Revival as well as Marty Stuart, and this accounts for Prine's return to the folk-sound of his early albums on songs like \\"Lulu Walls\\" and \\"Paradise\\", the latter a rerecording of the self-penned classic which appeared on the singer's debut John Prine in 1971. The album was recorded in Nashville. Composition Perhaps the most significant song that appears on German Afternoons is \\"The Speed Of The Sound Of Loneliness\\", which became a concert staple and an instant classic for many Prine devotees. Writing in Great Days: The John Prine Anthology, critic David Fricke describes the song as \\"a hypnotic song of lovesick melancholia set to a simple, mid-tempo rhythm that sounded like the desolate ticking of a hall way clock.\\" \\"Yeah, that came out all at once,\\" Prine revealed to Paul Zollo of Bluerailroad. \\"From a broken relationship I was in. I could not understand what went wrong and I had to explain to myself, and I did it through this song. The next day I thought, Jesus, that‚Äôs beautiful. I didn‚Äôt recognize it at the time, it was just pouring out of me.\\" Prine was nearing the end of his marriage to musician Rachel Peer-Prine, who sang harmony on several German Afternoon tracks, and producer Jim Rooney recalled in his own memoir, \\"John and Rachel were having a very up-and-down time of it, but the resulting songs might have been worth all the trouble. Perhaps the best song to come out of the turmoil generated by Rachel and John‚Äôs relationship was the aptly titled ‚ÄòSpeed of the Sound of Loneliness.‚Äô\\" Two songs hearken back to the singer‚Äôs roots. Prine had ended his 1972 LP with the Carter Family song \\"Diamonds in the Rough,\\" and here he kicks off the album with a rollicking arrangement of A.P. Carter's \\"Lulu Walls.\\" Prine also covers the Leon Payne classic \\"They‚Äôll Never Take Her Love from Me,\\" made famous by Hank Williams, another key influence on Prine. The album comes full circle with a remake of \\"Paradise,\\" one of Prine's most famous songs that appeared on his debut album in 1971. He later explained: \\"The song over the years had turned into such a bluegrass standard...the first version of ‚ÄòParadise,‚Äô in order to get a fiddle part on it, we had to ask a guy from the Memphis symphony to come in and play the violin like a fiddle, and I always remember that, and I wanted to make a more of a bluegrass version of it.\\" In the Great Days anthology, Prine revealed that \\"Bad Boy\\" had been inspired by Merle Haggard and that it was \\"a really proud song about guilt. 'I'm proud to be guilty, I've been a bad boy again.' Around that time, I fell under the spell of Merle Haggard's songwriting. There was a period there when he just seemed to be churning out some really great stuff. He was bringing out great albums every six or eight months, and I considered \\"Bad Boy\\" sort of in the vein of what he was doing.\\" Prine added that Willie Nelson had told him he wanted to cut \\"Linda Goes To Mars\\" (\\"I just can't imagine him doing it, although I bet it would be good,\\" Prine wrote). The song, a comic variation on \\"Angel from Montgomery\\", is about a woman who mentally checked out of her marriage from time to time, told from the husband's point of view. \\"I Just Want To Dance with You\\", co-written by Prine and Roger Cook, was released in April 1998 by American country singer George Strait as the first single to his album One Step at a Time and became his 34th Number One single on the Billboard Hot Country Singles & Tracks (now Hot Country Songs) chart. It was also a hit for Daniel O'Donnell in 1992, reaching 20 in the UK charts. \\"Love, Love, Love,\\" a different slant on romantic disconnection, was co-written with Keith Sykes, who opened for Prine at the Bitter End years before, while Rodney Crowell prot√©g√© Bill Caswell teamed up with Prine to write \\"Out of Love,\\" a corny tune full of references to beer commercials. Prine wrote \\"If She Were You\\" with his friend Steve Goodman, who had died the same year after a long battle with leukemia. The novelty song \\"Let's Talk Dirty In Hawaiian\\" was rerecorded and released as a single in 1987. Prine would later say that the album title, which People joked in its review was \\"probably the worst album title in pop music history,\\" was not a throwback to his own army service but rather came from a friend: \\"I had this guy explain to me once that a German afternoon is like you go into town with some errands to run and stuff to do but then you run into an old buddy you haven't seen. And you drop into a bar for just a minute and start to talk. And next thing you know it's already evening and you've just spent a German afternoon.\\" Reception German Afternoons received a Grammy Award nomination for Best Contemporary Folk Recording. Writing for AllMusic, critic Jim Smith says of the album, \\"...this is a sleepy-town stroll, featuring snappy accompaniment by the New Grass Revival.\\" Music critic Robert Christgau wrote, \\"...this relaxed, confident album is where Prine comes out and admits he's a folkie...The songs are straightforward and homemade...\\" Prine biographer Eddie Huffman opines that the LP \\"was a lively, enjoyable, and well-written album by a pro hitting his stride in middle age.\\" Track listing # \\"Lulu Walls\\" (A.

The Cathedral of St. Domnius is a complex of a church, formed from an Imperial Roman mausoleum, with a bell tower; strictly the church is dedicated to the Virgin Mary, and the bell tower to Saint Domnius. Together they form the Cathedral of St. Domnius. The Cathedral of Saint Domnius, consecrated at the turn of the 7th century AD, is regarded as the oldest Catholic cathedral in the world that remains in use in its original structure, without near-complete renovation at a later date (though the bell tower dates from the 12th century). The structure itself, built in AD 305 as the Mausoleum of Diocletian, is the second oldest structure used by any Christian Cathedral.Papa u Splitu i Solinu ‚Äì kolijevci hrvatskog kr≈°ƒáanstva i dr≈æavnosti Najstarija katedrala na svijetu Name The cathedral was named after Saint Domnius (Saint Dujam, or Saint Domnius) patron saint of Split, who was a 3rd-century Bishop of Salona. Salona was a large Roman city serving as capital of the Province of Dalmatia. Today it is located near the city of Solin in Croatia. Saint Domnius was martyred with seven other Christians in the persecutions of the Emperor Diocletian. He was born in Antioch, in modern- day Turkey, and beheaded in 304 at Salona. Architecture Cathedral section. Diocletian's Palace () is a building in the centre of Split, built for the Emperor Diocletian (a native of Dalmatia) at the turn of the 4th century. On the intersection of two main roads, cardo and decumanus, there is a monumental court Peristyle, from which the only access to Cathedral of St. Domnius is to the east. The Cathedral of St. Domnius is composed of three different sections of different ages. The main part is Emperor Diocletian's mausoleum, which dates from the end of the 3rd century. The mausoleum was built like the rest of the palace with white local limestone and marble of high quality, most of which was from marble quarries on the island of Braƒç, with tuff taken from the nearby river Jadro beds, and with brick made in Salonitan and other factories. Later, in the 17th century a choir was added to the eastern side of the mausoleum. For that purpose the eastern wall of the mausoleum was torn down in order to unify the two chambers.Stephen Williams, Diocletian and the Roman recovery, pg. 200, Taylor & Francis, Inc. (1996), The Bell Tower was constructed in the year 1100 AD, in the Romanesque style. Extensive rebuilding in 1908 radically changed the Bell Tower, and many of the original Romanesque sculptures were removed.Kampanel St. Domnius One of the best examples of Romanesque sculpture in Croatia, are the wooden doors on Cathedral of St. Domnius. They were made by the medieval Croatian sculptor and painter Andrija Buvina around 1214. Two wings of the Buvina wooden door contains 14 scenes from the life of Jesus Christ, separated by rich ornaments in wood. Treasury On the first floor of the sacristy is the cathedral treasury, which contains relics of Saint Domnius, which were brought to the cathedral after his death. Other treasures include sacral art works, like the Romanesque The Madonna and Child panel painting from the 13th century,Naklada Naprijed, The Croatian Adriatic Tourist Guide, pg. 237, Zagreb (1999), objects like chalices and reliquaries by goldsmiths from the 13th to the 19th century, and mass vestments from the 14th till 19th century. It also contains famous books like the Book of gospels (Splitski Evandelistar) from the 6th century, the Supetar cartulary (Kartularium from Sumpetar) from the 11th century, and the Historia Salonitana (The History of the people of Salona) by Thomas the Archdeacon from Split in the 13th century.

He co-owned a prosperous printing business, Edwards & Broughton, and was a member of several commercial organizations. An active member in the North Carolina Baptist community, he served as secretary of the Southern Baptist Convention for approximately 30 years. Broughton was born in 1848 near Auburn, North Carolina. Eight years later his family moved to Raleigh, and he enrolled in public school. After several years of work in printing offices which saw him employed in Washington D.C. and New York City, Broughton returned to Raleigh and married. In 1872 he and C.B. Edwards established the Edwards & Broughton Printing Company. It quickly became one of the largest printers in North Carolina, and for a time it did most of the printing and binding of state publications. Broughton was a devout Baptist who acted as a lay preacher, deacon, Sunday school superintendent, and secretary of the Southern Baptist Convention for about 30 years. Inspired by his religious convictions, he ardently campaigned for temperance and the prohibition of alcohol in North Carolina. He served one term in the North Carolina State Senate for the Democratic Party to prevent the seat from being filled by an anti-prohibition candidate. Broughton also supported public education, securing tax increases to fund Raleigh's schools and serving on the boards of trustees for several state institutions. He fell ill in 1913 and was forced to retire, dying the following year in a hospital in Philadelphia. Needham B. Broughton High School in Raleigh was named in his honor.  Early life and printing career  Needham Broughton was born on February 14, 1848 on a farm near Auburn, North Carolina, to Joseph Broughton and Mary Bagwell. His paternal grandfather was an English immigrant. Joseph Broughton died in 1854, leaving Bagwell to care for Needham, his three brothers, and his three sisters by herself. In 1856, Broughton moved to Raleigh, North Carolina, with his family and studied in public schools for five years. When Broughton was 13 years old he was hired by editor John W. Syme to work in The Raleigh Register's printing office. When the publication was suspended in 1864, he was subsequently hired by John L. Pennington to perform similar work for the Daily Progress. Upon the conclusion of the Civil War in 1865, Broughton traveled to Richmond, Virginia, to find employment. He worked for the Richmond Examiner for six months before moving to Washington, D. C. to work for the Congressional Record. Quitting after the close of Congress' 1867 session, in August he left for Baltimore. After a brief stay there and in Philadelphia, he settled in New York City. Broughton struggled to obtain employment for two weeks, and spent one day working on the New York World. He then set type for the New York Herald for over three months. Broughton returned to Raleigh in February 1869. In May he married Caroline R. Lougee. They had six children. In 1872 Broughton and C. B. Edwards purchased the office of the defunct Raleigh Standard on credit and established the Edwards & Broughton Printing Company on September 2. It quickly became one of the largest printers in North Carolina, and between 1887 and 1894 it did most of the printing and binding of state publications. By 1913 Edwards & Broughton employed nearly 100 persons and had expanded to offer engraving services. Edwards retired in 1910 and Broughton subsequently became president of their printing firm. As the enterprise printed labor union and Farmers' Alliance publications, Broughton joined the Knights of Labor and the Alliance. On October 20, 1903 he was elected president of the North Carolina Master Printers' Association. Broughton was also a member of the North Carolina Merchants Association and the North Carolina Chamber of Commerce. For a time he owned The Biblical Recorder and held stock in the News and Observer Publishing Company. He occasionally contributed writings to the Recorder and to Raleigh's two daily newspapers.  Religious activities  Broughton was Baptized as a Baptist in 1868. He was a member of the First Baptist Church in Raleigh. In 1874 he and J.S. Allen led several other parishioners in organizing a new congregation and purchasing a church on Swain Street, which they subsequently named Second Baptist Church. Within two years the congregation decided that a larger building was needed, so land was purchased at the corner of Hargett and Person Streets and the Tabernacle Baptist Church was established. Broughton was made a deacon and appointed superintendent of its Sunday school. In the late 1890s he was made vice-president of the Sunday School Board of the Southern Baptist Convention (SBC) and a member of the executive committee of the International Sunday School Association. He held all three positions until 1913. In those capacities he attended numerous international Sunday school conferences, including a world convention in Rome. He also served as secretary of the SBC for approximately 30 years and acted as a lay preacher.  Involvement in public affairs  Broughton staunchly supported public education and was an avid supporter of the Chautauqua movement. He served as the first chairman of the board of Raleigh's public schools. In the 1888 he successfully lobbied for a property tax increase to save the city's schools from bankruptcy. Broughton also pressed for Meredith College and the North Carolina Agricultural and Mechanic College to be located in Raleigh. He served as a trustee of both schools, as well as of Wake Forest College, the Oxford Orphan Asylum, and the State School for the Deaf, Dumb and the Blind, and was a member of National Religious Training School and Chautauqua for the Colored Race's advisory board. Broughton circa. 1910 Due to his religious beliefs, Broughton was a member of the temperance movement and a strong supporter of the prohibition of the sale and consumption of alcohol. For five years he was Grand Chief Templar of the North Carolina Order of Good Templars. In 1887 he convinced African Methodist Episcopal Zion bishop James Walker Hood to appeal to blacks to support a Raleigh referendum banning alcohol. Nevertheless, the electorate rejected the proposed restriction. Broughton was elected president of the North Carolina Anti-Saloon League in 1902. The following year he appealed to Raleigh's black leaders to join whites in a campaign against \\"Sin and Satan\\" and improve the morality of their race, chiefly by supporting temperance. He told Charles Norfleet Hunter, a prominent black educator, that by rejecting alcohol, black voters could prove themselves to be responsible citizens, despite their disenfranchisement. Having been persuaded by Broughton, Hunter appealed to blacks to vote to remove saloons from Raleigh. A local referendum to ban the establishments succeeded, with most black voters' support. Broughton's wider advocacy was also ultimately successful; in 1908 a statewide referendum approved a ban of the sale of alcohol, though the residents of Wake County had voted against it. However, the state lost revenue generated by liquor taxes, temporarily jeopardizing the funding of public education. Despite collaborating with blacks on temperance, Broughton supported white supremacy. In 1870 he suggested that the Raleigh Typographical Union modify its rules to prevent black men from joining it. In 1889 Broughton was appointed by the governor to the North Carolina Board of Agriculture. He served as chairman of its finance committee. Broughton ran on the Democratic Party's ticket in 1896 in the Wake County constituency for a seat in the North Carolina House of Representatives. He was defeated by incumbent James H. Young by a slim margin. In June 1900 he was nominated by the Democratic Party in a Wake County convention to the Wake County seat for the North Carolina Senate on the fourth ballot. He accepted the nomination to prevent it from being taken by an anti-prohibition candidate. His decision was made at the behest of fellow temperance supporter Josephus Daniels, who disliked the local Democratic political machine's pro-alcohol stance. Broughton's candidacy outraged the machine members, who, mindful of his popularity among white Christians, felt the issue of prohibition would divide their electoral support after the Democratic Party had only recently regained control of the state government. Daniels reached a compromise with the machine's leaders, whereby they would support Broughton if Daniels did not try to pass a prohibition bill through the legislature. Broughton was thus elected to the office, serving from 1901 until 1903. He did not seek reelection.  Death and legacy  Broughton fell ill in 1913 and retired from public life. He died on May 26, 1914 in a hospital in Philadelphia, survived by his wife and children. He was buried in the Historic Oakwood Cemetery in Raleigh. Years after Broughton's death, C. B. Edwards sent a letter to the Raleigh Public School Board, requesting that the new high school in Raleigh‚Äîthen without a name‚Äîbe named for Broughton in honor of his service to public education in the city. The dedication ceremony for Needham B. Broughton High School took place in 1930, towards the end of the school year. His daughter, Carrie Broughton, became the first woman in North Carolina to hold statewide office as state librarian. His nephew, J. Melville Broughton, served as Governor of North Carolina. Alcohol remained prohibited in North Carolina until 1935.

In Islamic writings, her name is thus often prefixed by the title \\"Mother of the Believers\\" (), referring to the description of Muhammad's wives in the Qur'an. Aisha had an important role in early Islamic history, both during Muhammad's life and after his death. In Sunni tradition, Aisha is portrayed as scholarly and inquisitive. She contributed to the spread of Muhammad's message and served the Muslim community for 44 years after his death. She is also known for narrating 2,210 hadiths,Islamyat: a core text for students not just on matters related to Muhammad's private life, but also on topics such as inheritance, pilgrimage, and eschatology. Her intellect and knowledge in various subjects, including poetry and medicine, were highly praised by early luminaries such as al-Zuhri and her student Urwa ibn al- Zubayr. Her father, Abu Bakr, became the first caliph to succeed Muhammad, and after two years was succeeded by Umar. During the time of the third caliph Uthman, Aisha had a leading part in the opposition that grew against him, though she did not agree either with those responsible for his assassination or with the party of Ali. During the reign of Ali, she wanted to avenge Uthman's death, which she attempted to do in the Battle of the Camel. She participated in the battle by giving speeches and leading troops on the back of her camel. She ended up losing the battle, but her involvement and determination left a lasting impression. Because of her involvement in this battle, Shia Muslims have a generally negative view of Aisha. Afterward, she lived quietly in Medina for more than twenty years, took no part in politics, became reconciled to Ali and did not oppose caliph Mu'awiya. Some traditional hadith sources state that Aisha was betrothed to Muhammad at the age of 6 or 7; other sources say she was 9 when she had a small marriage ceremony; some sources put the date in her teens; but both the date and her age at marriage and later consummation with Muhammad in Medina are sources of controversy and discussion amongst scholars. Early life Aisha was born 613 or early 614. i.e., the year 613‚Äì614 She was the daughter of Umm Ruman and Abu Bakr of Mecca, two of Muhammad's most trusted companions. No sources offer much more information about Aisha's childhood years. Marriage to Muhammad The idea to match Aisha with Muhammad was suggested by Khawlah bint Hakim after the death of Muhammad's first wife, Khadija bint Khuwaylid. After this, the previous agreement regarding the marriage of Aisha with Jubayr ibn Mut'im was put aside by common consent. Abu Bakr was uncertain at first \\"as to the propriety or even legality of marrying his daughter to his 'brother'.\\" Muhammad, however, responded that they were brothers only in religion. British historian William Montgomery Watt suggests that Muhammad hoped to strengthen his ties with Abu Bakr; the strengthening of ties commonly served as a basis for marriage in Arabian culture. Age at marriage There was no official registration of births at the time that Aisha was born, so her date of birth, and therefore the date of marriage, cannot be stated with certainty. Her age is not mentioned in the Qur'an. All discussions and debate about her age at marriage rely on, firstly, the various ahadith, which are regarded by most Muslims as records of the words and actions of Muhammad and as a source for religious law and moral guidance, second only to that of the Qur'an. Unlike the Qur'an, not all Muslims believe that all ahadith accounts are a divine revelation, and different collections of ahadith are given varied levels of respect by different branches of the Islamic faith.Aisha Y. Musa, The Qur‚Äôanists, Florida International University, accessed 22 May 2013. Sunni, various branches of Shia (such as Ismaili and Twelver), Ibadi and Ahmadiyya Muslims all regard different sets of ahadith as \\"strong\\" or \\"weak\\" in the power of their evidence, depending on their perceived provenance.The Future of Muslim Civilisation by Ziauddin Sardar, 1979, page 26.Neal Robinson (2013), Islam: A Concise Introduction, Routledge, , Chapter 7, pp. 85-89 Aisha's age at the time of her marriage is frequently mentioned in Islamic literature. According to John Esposito, Aisha was married to Muhammad in Mecca in 624CE, after Hegira to Medina and the Battle of Badr. Extracted from Several scholars interpret this to indicate that she reached puberty at this age, although her age at the time is the subject of dispute. Al-Tabari says she was nine at the time her marriage was consummated., , Sahih al-Bukhari's hadith says \\"that the Prophet married her when she was six years old and he consummated his marriage when she was nine years old.\\"Sahih al-Bukhari, 7:62:64 Other sources differ on the age of marriage, but agree that the marriage was not consummated at the time of the marriage contract. All biographical information on Muhammad and his companions was first recorded over a century after his death, but the ahadithPlural of hadith. and sƒ´ra (traditional Islamic biographies of Muhammad) provide records of early Islam through an unbroken chain of transmission. Various ahadith stating that Aisha was either nine or ten at the time of her consummation come from collections with sahih status, meaning they are regarded as reputable by most Sunni Muslims.Sahih Muslim 8:3309 Other traditional sources also mention Aisha's age. The sƒ´ra of Ibn Ishaq edited by Ibn Hisham states that she was nine or ten years old at the consummation. The historian al-Tabari also states that she was nine. Marriage at a young age was not unheard of at the time, and Aisha's marriage to Muhammad may have had a political connotation, as her father Abu Bakr was an influential man in the community. Abu Bakr, on his part, may have sought to further the bond of kinship between Muhammad and himself by joining their families together in marriage via Aisha. Leila Ahmed notes that Aisha's betrothal and marriage to Muhammad are presented as ordinary in Islamic literature, and may indicate that it was not unusual for children to be married to their elders in that era. Aisha's age at marriage has been a source of controversy and debate, and some historians, scholars, and writers have revisited the previously-accepted timeline of her life. Some writers have calculated Aisha's age based on details found in some biographies, eschewing the traditionally-accepted ahadith. One hadith recorded in the works of some medieval scholars, including al-Dhahabi, states that Aisha's older sister Asma was ten years older than her. This has been combined with information about Asma's age at the time of her death and used to suggest that Aisha was over thirteen at the time of her marriage. Gibril Haddad criticizes this approach as relying on a single narrator, and notes that a hadith from the same narrator gives a broader range for the age difference between the sisters. Using reports on the birth year of Fatimah as a reference point, the Lahore Ahmadiyya Movement scholar Muhammad Ali has estimated that Aisha was over ten years old at the time of marriage and over fifteen at the time of its consummation. Noting the references to Aisha's age as either nine or ten at the age of consummation, American historian Denise Spellberg states that \\"these specific references to the bride's age reinforce Aisha's pre- menarcheal status and, implicitly, her virginity\\". She notes that Aisha herself seemed to promote the fact that she was a virgin before her marriage to Muhammad, as a way to distinguish herself from his other, non-virginal wives. This was of great importance to those who supported Aisha's position in the debate of the succession to Muhammad. These supporters considered that as Muhammad's only virgin wife, Aisha was divinely intended for him, and therefore the most credible regarding the debate. Personal life Relationship with Muhammad Muhammad and Aisha freeing the daughter of a tribal chief In many Muslim traditions, Aisha is described as Muhammad's most beloved or favored wife after his first wife, Khadija bint Khuwaylid, who died before the migration to Medina took place. There are several hadiths, or stories or sayings of Muhammad, that support this belief. One relates that when a companion asked Muhammad, \\"who is the person you love most in the world?\\" he responded, \\"Aisha.\\" Others relate that Muhammad built Aisha's apartment so that her door opened directly into the mosque, and that she was the only woman with whom Muhammad received revelations. They bathed in the same water and he prayed while she lay stretched out in front of him. Various traditions reveal the mutual affection between Muhammad and Aisha. He would often just sit and watch her and her friends play with dolls, and on occasion, he would even join them. Additionally, they were close enough that each was able to discern the mood of the other, as many stories relate. It is also important to note that there exists evidence that Muhammad did not view himself as entirely superior to Aisha, at least not enough to prevent Aisha from speaking her mind, even at the risk of angering Muhammad. On one such instance, Muhammad's \\"announcement of a revelation permitting him to enter into marriages disallowed to other men drew from her [Aisha] the retort, 'It seems to me your Lord hastens to satisfy your desire!'\\" Furthermore, Muhammad and Aisha had a strong intellectual relationship. Muhammad valued her keen memory and intelligence and so instructed his companions to draw some of their religious practices from her. Aisha was jealous of Khadija bint Khuwaylid who was the first wife of Muhammad, saying, \\"I did not feel jealous of any of the wives of the Prophet as much as I did of Khadija though I did not see her, the Prophet used to mention her very often, and whenever he slaughtered a sheep, he would cut its parts and send them to the women friends of Khadija. When I sometimes said to him, \\"(You treat Khadija in such a way) as if there is no woman on earth except Khadija,\\" he would say, \\"Khadija was such-and-such, and from her I had children.\\" Aisha and Muhammad would often have races with each other, \\" I had a race with him (the Prophet) and I outstripped him on my feet. When I became fleshy, (again) I raced with him (the Prophet) and he outstripped me. He said: This is for that outstripping.\\" Accusation of adultery The story of the accusation of adultery levied against Aisha, also known as the Event of Ifk, can be traced to sura (chapter) An-Nur of the Qur'an. As the story goes, Aisha left her howdah in order to search for a missing necklace. Her slaves mounted the howdah and prepared it for travel without noticing any difference in weight without Aisha's presence. Hence the caravan accidentally departed without her. She remained at the camp until the next morning, when Safwan ibn al-Mu‚Äòattal, a nomad and member of Muhammad's army, found her and brought her back to Muhammad at the army's next camp. Rumours that Aisha and Safwan had committed adultery were spread, particularly by Abd-Allah ibn Ubayy, Hassan ibn Thabit, Mistah ibn Uthatha and Hammanah bint Jahsh (sister of Zaynab bint Jahsh, another of Muhammad's wives). Usama ibn Zayd, son of Zayd ibn Harithah, defended Aisha's reputation; while Ali ibn Abi Talib advised: \\"Women are plentiful, and you can easily change one for another.\\" Muhammad came to speak directly with Aisha about the rumors. He was still sitting in her house when he announced that he had received a revelation from God confirming Aisha's innocence. Surah 24 details the Islamic laws and punishment regarding adultery and slander. Aisha's accusers were subjected to punishments of 80 lashes.The story is told multiple times in the early traditions, nearly all of the versions being ultimately derived from Aisha's account. Typical examples can be found in , and . Story of the honey After the daily Asr prayer, Muhammad would visit each of his wives' apartments to inquire about their well-being. Muhammad was just in the amount of time he spent with them and attention he gave to them. Once, Muhammad's fifth wife, Zaynab bint Jahsh, received some honey from a relative which Muhammad took a particular liking to. As a result, every time Zaynab offered some of this honey to him he would spend a long time in her apartment. This did not sit well with Aisha and Hafsa bint Umar. Soon after this event, Muhammad reported that he had received a revelation in which he was told that he could eat anything permitted by God. Some Sunni commentators on the Qur'an sometimes give this story as the \\"occasion of revelation\\" for At-Tahrim, which opens with the following verses: Word spread to the small Muslim community that Muhammad's wives were speaking sharply to him and conspiring against him. Muhammad, saddened and upset, separated from his wives for a month. ‚ÄòUmar, Hafsa's father, scolded his daughter and also spoke to Muhammad of the matter. By the end of this time, his wives were humbled; they agreed to \\"speak correct and courteous words\\" and to focus on the afterlife. Death of Muhammad Aisha remained Muhammad's favorite wife throughout his life. When he became ill and suspected that he was probably going to die, he began to ask his wives whose apartment he was to stay in next. They eventually figured out that he was trying to determine when he was due with Aisha, and they then allowed him to retire there. He remained in Aisha's apartment until his death, and his last breath was taken as he lay in the arms of Aisha, his most beloved wife. Political career After Muhammad's death, which ended Aisha and Muhammad's 14-year-long marriage, Aisha lived fifty more years in and around Medina. Much of her time was spent learning and acquiring knowledge of the Quran and the sunnah of Muhammad. Aisha was one of three wives (the other two being Hafsa bint Umar and Umm Salama) who memorized the Qur'an. Like Hafsa, Aisha had her script of the Quran written after Muhammad's death. During Aisha's life many prominent customs of Islam, such as veiling of women, began. Aisha's importance to revitalizing the Arab tradition and leadership among the Arab women highlights her magnitude within Islam. Aisha became involved in the politics of early Islam and the first three caliphate reigns: Abu Bakr, ‚ÄòUmar, and ‚ÄòUthman. During a time in Islam when women were not expected or wanted, to contribute outside the household, Aisha delivered public speeches, became directly involved in a war and even battles, and helped both men and women to understand the practices of Muhammad. Role during caliphate =Role during first and second caliphates= After Muhammad's martyred in 632, Abu Bakr was appointed as the first caliph. This matter of succession to Muhammad is extremely controversial to the Shia who believe that Ali had been appointed by Muhammad to lead while Sunni maintain that the public elected Abu Bakr. Abu Bakr had two advantages in achieving his new role: his long personal friendship with Muhammad and his role as a father-in-law. As caliph, Abu Bakr was the first to set guidelines for the new position of authority. Aisha garnered more special privileges in the Islamic community for being known as both a wife of Muhammad and the daughter of the first caliph. Being the daughter of Abu Bakr tied Aisha to honorable titles earned from her father's strong dedication to Islam. For example, she was given the title of al-siddiqa bint al-Siddiq, meaning 'the truthful woman, daughter of the truthful man', a reference to Abu Bakr's support of the Isra and Mi'raj. In 634 Abu Bakr fell sick and was unable to recover. Before his death, he appointed ‚ÄòUmar, one of his chief advisers, as the second caliph. Throughout ‚ÄòUmar's time in power Aisha continued to play the role of a consultant in political matters. =Role during the third caliphate= After ‚ÄòUmar died, ‚ÄòUthmƒÅn was chosen to be the third caliph. He wanted to promote the interests of the Umayyads. Aisha had little involvement with ‚ÄòUthmƒÅn for the first couple years, but eventually, she found a way into the politics of his reign. She eventually grew to despise ‚ÄòUthmƒÅn, and many are unsure of what specifically triggered her eventual opposition towards him. A prominent opposition that arose towards him was when ‚ÄòUthmƒÅn mistreated ‚ÄòAmmar ibn Yasir (companion of Muhammad) by beating him. Aisha became enraged and spoke out publicly, saying, \\"How soon indeed you have forgotten the practice (sunnah) of your prophet and these, his hairs, a shirt, and sandal have not yet perished!\\". As time continued issues of antipathy towards ‚ÄòUthmƒÅn continued to arise. Another instance of opposition arose when the people came to Aisha after UthmƒÅn ignored the rightful punishment for Walid ibn Uqbah (UthmƒÅn's brother). Aisha and UthmƒÅn argued with each other, UthmƒÅn eventually commented on why Aisha had come and how she was \\"ordered to stay at home\\". Arising from this comment, was the question of whether Aisha and for that matter women, still could be involved in public affairs. The Muslim community became split: \\"some sided with UthmƒÅn, but others demanded to know who indeed had a better right than Aisha in such matters\\". The caliphate took a turn for the worse when Egypt was governed by Abdullah ibn Saad. Abbott reports that Muhammad ibn Abi Hudhayfa of Egypt, an opponent of ‚ÄòUthmƒÅn, forged letters in the Mothers of the Believers' names to the conspirators against ‚ÄòUthmƒÅn. The people cut off ‚ÄòUthmƒÅn's water and food supply. When Aisha realized the behavior of the crowd, Abbott notes, Aisha could not believe the crowd \\"would offer such indignities to a widow of Mohammad\\". This refers to when Safiyya bint Huyayy (one of Muhammad's wives) tried to help ‚ÄòUthmƒÅn and was taken by the crowd. Malik al-Ashtar then approached her about killing UthmƒÅn and the letter, and she claimed she would never want to \\"command the shedding of the blood of the Muslims and the killing of their ImƒÅm\\"; she also claimed she did not write the letters. The city continued to oppose ‚ÄòUthmƒÅn, but as for Aisha, her journey to Mecca was approaching. With the journey to Mecca approaching at this time, she wanted to rid herself of the situation. ‚ÄòUthmƒÅn heard of her not wanting to hurt him, and he asked her to stay because she influenced the people, but this did not persuade Aisha, and she continued on her journey. First Fitna Domains of Rashidun Caliphate under four caliphs. The divided phase relates to the Rashidun Caliphate of Ali during the First Fitna. In 655, Uthman's house was put under siege by about 1000 rebels. Eventually the rebels broke into the house and murdered Uthman, provoking the First Fitna.See:  P.19 After killing Uthman, the rebels asked Ali to be the new caliph, although Ali was not involved in the murder of Uthman according to many reports. Ali reportedly initially refused the caliphate, agreeing to rule only after his followers persisted. When Ali could not execute those merely accused of Uthman's murder, Aisha delivered a fiery speech against him for not avenging the death of Uthman. The first to respond to Aisha was Abdullah ibn Aamar al-Hadhrami, the governor of Mecca during the reign of Uthman, and prominent members of the Banu Umayya. With the funds from the \\"Yemeni Treasury\\" Aisha set out on a campaign against the Rashidun Caliphate of Ali. Aisha, along with an army including Zubayr ibn al-Awam and Talha ibn Ubayd-Allah, confronted Ali's army, demanding the prosecution of Uthman's killers who had mingled with his army outside the city of Basra. When her forces captured Basra she ordered the execution of 600 Muslims and 40 others, including Hakim ibn Jabala, who were put to death in the Grand Mosque of Basra. Aisha's forces are also known to have tortured and imprisoned Uthman ibn Hunaif a Sahabi and the governor of Basra appointed by Ali. Aisha battling the fourth caliph Ali in the Battle of the Camel Ali rallied supporters and fought Aisha's forces near Basra in 656. The battle is known as the Battle of the Camel, after the fact that Aisha directed her forces from a howdah on the back of a large camel. Aisha's forces were defeated and an estimated 10,000 Muslims were killed in the battle, considered the first engagement where Muslims fought Muslims. After 110 days of the conflict, the Rashidun Caliph Ali ibn Abi Talib met Aisha with reconciliation. He sent her back to Medina under military escort headed by her brother Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr, one of Ali's commanders. She subsequently retired to Medina with no more interference with the affairs of the state. She was also awarded a pension by Ali. Although she retired to Medina, her forsaken efforts against the Rashidun Caliphate of Ali did not end the First Fitna. Contributions to Islam and influence After 25 years of a monogamous relationship with his first wife, Khadija bint Khuwaylid, Muhammad participated in nine years of polygyny, marrying at least nine further wives. Muhammad's subsequent marriages were depicted purely as political matches rather than unions of sexual indulgence. In particular, Muhammad's unions with Aisha and Hafsa bint Umar associated him with two of the most significant leaders of the early Muslim community, Aisha's and Hafsa's fathers, Abu Bakr and ‚ÄòUmar ibn al-KhattƒÅb, respectively. Aisha's marriage has given her significance among many within Islamic culture, becoming known as the most learned woman of her time. Being Muhammad's favorite wife, Aisha occupied an important position in his life. When Muhammad married Aisha in her youth, she was accessible \\"...to the values needed to lead and influence the sisterhood of Muslim women.\\" After the death of Muhammad, Aisha was discovered to be a renowned source of hadiths, due to her qualities of intelligence and memory. Aisha conveyed ideas expressing Muhammad's practice (sunnah). She expressed herself as a role model to women, which can also be seen within some traditions attributed to her. The traditions regarding Aisha habitually opposed ideas unfavorable to women in efforts to elicit social change. According to Reza Aslan: Not only was Aisha supportive of Muhammad, but she contributed scholarly intellect to the development of Islam. She was given the title al-Siddiqah, meaning 'the one who affirms the truth'. Aisha was known for her \\"...expertise in the Quran, shares of inheritance, lawful and unlawful matters, poetry, Arabic literature, Arab history, genealogy, and general medicine.\\" Her intellectual contributions regarding the verbal texts of Islam were in time transcribed into written form, becoming the official history of Islam. After the death of Muhammad, Aisha was regarded as the most reliable source in the teachings of hadith. Aisha's authentication of Muhammad's ways of prayer and his recitation of the Qur'an allowed for the development of knowledge of his sunnah of praying and reading verses of the Quran. During Aisha's entire life she was a strong advocate for the education of Islamic women, especially in law and the teachings of Islam. She was known for establishing the first madrasa for women in her home. Attending Aisha's classes were various family relatives and orphaned children. Men also attended Aisha's classes, with a simple curtain separating the male and female students. Political influence Some say that Aisha's political influence helped promote her father, Abu Bakr, to the caliphate after Muhammad's death. After the defeat at the Battle of the Camel, Aisha retreated to Medina and became a teacher. Upon her arrival in Medina, Aisha retired from her public role in politics. Her discontinuation of public politics, however, did not stop her political influence completely. Privately, Aisha continued influencing those intertwined in the Islamic political sphere. Amongst the Islamic community, she was known as an intelligent woman who debated law with male companions. Aisha was also considered to be the embodiment of proper rituals while partaking in the pilgrimage to Mecca, a journey she made with several groups of women. For the last two years of her life, Aisha spent much of her time telling the stories of Muhammad, hoping to correct false passages that had become influential in formulating Islamic law. Due to this, Aisha's political influence continues to impact those in Islam. Death Aisha died at her home in Medina on 17 Ramadan 58 AH (16 July 678). She was 67 years old. Some such as Sibt ibn al-Jawzi, Hakim Sanai, and Khwaja Mehboob Qasim Chishti Muhsarafee Qadiri say that she was murdered by Muawiyah. Muhammad's companion Abu Hurairah led her funeral prayer after the tahajjud (night) prayer, and she was buried at Jannat al-Baqi‚Äò. Views Sunni view of Aisha Sunnis believe she was Muhammad's favorite wife after Hazrat Khadija bint Khuwaylid. They consider her (among other wives) to be Umm al-Mu‚Äôminin and among the members of the Ahl al-Bayt, or Muhammad's family. According to Sunni hadith reports, Muhammad saw Aisha in two dreams in which he was shown that he would marry her. Shia view of Aisha The Shia view Aisha is different than Sunni. They criticize her of hating Ali and defying him during his caliphate in the Battle of the Camel, when she fought men from Ali's army in Basra.

The community itself comprises several smaller communities. Often the inner communities are referred to on their own but much of the time simply the encapsulating region of Jeddore is simply used. This is most likely due to the size of the communities, individually they are relatively unknown to residents outside of Nova Scotia's Eastern Shore. Jeddore is located on the Eastern Shore along Trunk 7, also known as the Marine Drive.  Communities  The area of Jeddore comprises the following four communities: * East Jeddore * Head of Jeddore * Jeddore Oyster Pond * West Jeddore  History  Jeddore was originally known as \\"River of Theodore\\". It was given this name by the French explorer, Nicolas Denys who visited the area in 1672. The name eventually became known as Jeddore.  Battle at Winnepang (Jeddore Harbour)  During the Mi‚Äôkmaq and Maliseet War, in July 1722 the Abenaki made an effort to create a blockade of the capital of Nova Scotia Annapolis Royal. They captured 18 fishing vessels along with prisoners between present-day Yarmouth and Canso. They also captured vessels and took prisoners from the Bay of Fundy. Governor Richard Philipps commissioned Capt. John Eliot and Capt. John Robinson in two sloops with regiments to protect the fishery at Canso, Nova Scotia and retrieve the captured vessels and prisoners. Toward this end, Capt. Eliot made a surprise attack on forty Natives on a ship at present-day Jeddore Harbour. The natives were among six of the fishing vessels they had seized. There was a 30-minute battle. Capt. Eliot was badly wounded as were several of his men. One was killed. Then Capt. Eliot lobbed a hand granadoes (type of hand grenade) into the native vessel. Some natives were killed in the explosion. Others tried to swim ashore as they were being shot by the New Englanders. Thirty-five Natives were killed. The New Englanders managed to rescue fifteen prisoners from the vessels, while discovering that nine had been killed. ‚Ä¢ Plank states that New Englanders set fire to Mi'kmaq vessels. The warriors tried to swim to land, but the New England men fired on them in the water. Twenty two were reported killed. Only five bodies were recovered and the New Englanders decapitated the corpses and set the severed heads on pikes surrounding Canso's new fort. Murdoch's and Plank's versions differ slightly. Captain Robinson captured two of the vessels and killed numerous Maine natives. He then arrived at present-day Lunenburg, Nova Scotia where the natives held five of the fishing vessels along with twenty prisoners. Robinson paid a ransom and they were released.  Attack at Jeddore  During Father Le Loutre's War, on the night of April 21, under the leadership of Chief Jean- Baptiste Cope and the Mi'kmaq attacked another British schooner in a battle at sea off Jeddore, Nova Scotia. On board were nine British men and one Acadian (Casteel), who was the pilot. The Mi'kmaq killed and scalped the British and let the Acadian off at Port Toulouse, where the Mi'kmaq sank the schooner after looting it.Whitehead, p. 137;  Geography  The area of Jeddore surrounds a deep natural harbour and while inland, it is dotted by various lakes and drumlins.  Jeddore Harbour  Jeddore Harbour lies in the center of the communities of Jeddore with East, West and Head Jeddore lying in their respective directions from the sea. Jeddore Oyster Ponds Lies to the northwest and Myers Point peninsula juts out at the head. The inlet is long and wide. The harbour is fed by Salmon River from the north. Salmon River which is actually a semi-saltwater fjord, which is spring fed but becomes increasingly contaminated by the sea water as it deepens and opens to the bay (eastern arm of the harbour).  Economy  The fishing industry remains the most important part of the economy in the area. Seafood processing factors highly into the economy with lobster making up the greatest proportion of fish exported directly from the area itself.Coastal Communities Network: Fish Plant Details for Musquodoboit - Clam Harbour The area is home to at least five seafood processing plants: * Bakers Point Fisheries Limited * Blue Ocean Sea Products Limited * Classic Seafoods * Jack‚Äôs Lobsters Limited * Jeddore Seafoods Limited  Notable Jeddorians  * Adrienne Power - Olympian References *coastalcommunities.ns.ca *Jeddore.com *Explore HRM Category:Communities in Halifax, Nova Scotia Category:General Service Areas in Nova Scotia ","title":"Jeddore, Nova Scotia"},{"id":"21552015","text":"Jerzy Nikitorowicz (born August 19, 1951 in Mielnik, Poland) is professor of pedagogics, dr. hab., rector of the University of Bia≈Çystok, Poland (since 2006).Prof. dr. hab.

Beaumont was a younger son of Sir Henry Beaumont, 2nd Baronet and his wife Elizabeth Farmer, daughter of George Farmer. He matriculated at New College, Oxford on 9 February 1683, aged 18, and graduated with a Bachelor of Civil Law in 1690 then became a fellow. In the same year he succeeded his older brother Thomas as baronet. In 1713, he was awarded the degree of a Doctor of Civil Law by the University of Oxford. Beaumont was initially reluctant to enter parliament. However at the first general election of 1701 he allowed himself to be put forward for Oxford University by a group of younger dons. He withdrew before the poll, but when a vacancy arrived shortly afterwards in March he was re- adopted and stood at the by-election. Although defeated, he succeeded in attracting a respectable following. At the second 1701 election he campaigned with a fellow Tory, John Verney, for Leicestershire but stood down before the poll. At the 1702 English general election, he was selected to stand for Leicester and was returned as Member of Parliament in a contest. He was re- elected at the 1705 English general election, and was returned unopposed in 1708 and 1710. In 1712, he was appointed a Commissioner of the Privy Seal. He was returned unopposed for Leicester at the 1713 general election and in 1714 was appointed a Lord of the Admiralty, a post he held only for six months.

The church is active since its consecration on May 1 May 1983, by then-Catholicos of the Holy See of Cilicia Karekin II. Background The current church of the Holy Mother of God is considered the continuation of the historic church of the Holy Mother of God of the old Christian Jdeydeh quarter, which was opened in 1429 and operated until the beginnings of the 20th century, within the courtyard of the Forty Martyrs Cathedral of Aleppo, when it was turned into a library and recently to the Zarehian Museum in 1991. History The church at night The absence of a church to serve the large Armenian community of the Suleimaniyeh area of Aleppo, arose the idea of building a new church, which became true with the donations of Armenian benefactors -especially those whose roots were from the Cilician city of \\"Aintab\\" (nowadays Gaziantep)- and throughout the efforts of father Zarmayr Hindoyan, the spiritual leader of Aintabian Armenians in Aleppo. The ground-blessing ceremony took place on 10 September 1972 with the presence of Khoren I, Catholicos of the Holy See of Cilicia, during the period of Bishop Datev Sarkissian. The construction work was finished completely in 1982. The consecration ceremony took place on 1 May 1983 under the patronage of Karekin II. Nowadays, the church itself plays a big role in the life of the Armenians of Aleppo. It is usually crowded with the faithful during regular Sunday masses. Many Armenians are members of the church. The church has a large hall opened in 1987 with a stage downstairs, used for cultural meetings, concerts, seminars and celebrations. In 1993 a Khachkar-memorial by Sarkis Balmanougian was erected in the right side of the main entrance of the church, to commemorate the victims of the Armenian Genocide. The church was completely renovated in 1998. Adjacent to the church is the Armenian Gertasirats High School and the Zohrab Kaprielian Theatre.

The runners are Englishman Roger Bannister, American Wes Santee, and Australian John Landy.

It has an annual processing capacity of 4.8 million tonnes/year or . The refinery is supplied with oil through an oil terminal located in the Port of Midia that can accommodate ships up to or by a pipeline of which has a terminus in the Port of Constan≈£a. History The refinery was founded in 1975 as the Midia NƒÉvodari Petrochemical Factory on a plot of land located in NƒÉvodari, Constan≈£a County. The design and construction of the complex took two years and was based on Romanian technology and foreign licenses. Its launch was spurred by the 1973 oil crisis, following which Romanian dictator Nicolae Ceau»ôescu met with Mohammad Reza Pahlavi of Iran. The two agreed that Iran would become Romania‚Äôs supplier of crude oil, while Romania would send arms and security specialists. The arrangement involving cheap oil soon ended with the Iranian Revolution, forcing Romania to seek unsatisfactory deals with African countries. In 1991 the Midia NƒÉvodari Petrochemical Factory was transformed into a joint stock company and the name was changed to SC Petromidia SA. Between 1997 and 2000 the state tried to privatise the company several times. The first procedure was undertaken in 1997 and negotiations were held with a consortium made by South Korean Daewoo, Swiss company Glencore, and Petromidia USA (local representative of the Windmill company). Between July 1998 and January 1999 a new round of negotiations were finalised and the Turkish company Akmaya was chosen as a strategic investor, offering a per share price of US$ 10.1. On November 1, 2000, the Romanian Property Fund () sold a stake of 69,991% of the complex to Rompetrol Group BV Rotterdam at a price of US$ 50.517 million, equivalent to US$ 2 per share. The value of the transaction was US$ 615 million, of which US$ 225 million was for modernisation works and other investments and US$ 340 million was for various debts (US$ 169 million for debts to the state and US$ 171 million to banks and other creditors) . Rompetrol also changed the name of the refinery to Rompetrol Rafinare. In April 2004 Rompetrol Rafinare was listed on the Bucharest Stock Exchange under the symbol RRC. Soon it became one of the most important listed companies and in December 2004 it was included in the BET 10 index. In 2003 the refinery was named Refinery of the Year in Central and Eastern Europe by the World Refining Association. Refining capacity Petromidia is the only Romanian refinery located on the Black Sea shore, thus having the advantage of being supplied directly through the Midia oil terminal located in the Port of Midia capable of receiving oil tankers up to or the pipeline starting in the Port of Constan≈£a.

Early life and education Norah Al Faiz was born in Shaqraa in 1956. Al Faiz received a bachelor of arts degree in sociology from King Saud University in Riyadh in 1979. She also received a master's degree in Instructional Technologies from Utah State University in 1982. Career Upon returning to Saudi Arabia, Al Faiz worked as a teacher.

(Archive) Later, Al Faiz served as the head of ministry of education‚Äôs educational technology center, and a lecturer and head of the training board of the ministry‚Äôs administration institute from 1983 to 1988. In 1993, she became ministry's educational supervisor for girls‚Äô private education. She was also appointed the director general of women's section of the institute of public administration in 1993, which she held until 2009. In addition, she worked as an associate professor in the department of education techniques from 1989 to 1995 at the College of Education, King Saud University. (Archive) Al Faiz was named deputy minister of education in charge of women‚Äôs affairs in February 2009 and is the first woman to direct girls‚Äô education in Saudi Arabia. She said that her appointment is \\"a source of pride for all women.\\" Reactions to her appointment Saudi journalist Khalid Almeena stated \\"People are very excited about this [her appointment].\\" Prince Talal considered her appointment as part of a larger process of change, initiated by King Abdullah even before his coronation, when he was still crown prince. He further stated that this appointment was good news for men even more than women, and was a call for women to take their natural place in society. Faisal bin Abdallah, education minister, also welcomed her appointment as a deputy. He told that the Saudi education ministry was proud to be the first to have a woman in a ministry post, and that women help men in numerous areas, including in education. However, Ali Alyami argued that her appointment was largely a move to make democratic reformers ineffective in and outside the country with the goal of reducing global criticism over the Saudi segregationist policies and oppression of women. For him, this move strengthens and reinforces King Abdullah‚Äôs position in the country. Shortly, he thought that her appointment led to a short-lived positive impact on the psyche and ethos of Saudi society, but it did not last for a long-time. Views Her Al Watan interview seems to support Ali Alyami's views. Four months after her appointment, in June 2009, Norah Al Faiz told that \\"the time was still too soon for [the] topic ‚Äùof sports for girls.\\" Since her photo was published in the same daily, showing her face without niqab, she angrily reacted and said \\"The publication of my photo upset me immensely ... [I]t is well known that I am a Saudi woman from Najd, and thus I wear a niqab. I will never allow the publishing of my photo in newspapers and I will not accept that it be put up anywhere.\\" Personal life Al Faiz is married and has three sons and two daughters. In April 2012, Utah State University granted her an honorary degree. In 2009, she was regarded as one of the 500 influential Muslims by Georgetown University's center for Muslim-Christian understanding.

World Peace Pagoda), formally Thiri Mingala Gaba Aye Zedidaw, ), is a pagoda located on Kaba Aye Road, Mayangon Township, Yangon, Myanmar. The pagoda was built in 1952 by U Nu in preparation for the Sixth Buddhist Council that he held from 1954‚Äì1956. The pagoda measures high and is also around the base. The pagoda is located approximately 11 km north of Yangon, a little past the Inya Lake Hotel. The Maha Pasana Guha (great cave) was built simultaneously with the Kaba Aye Pagoda and is located in the same complex. The cave is a replica of the Satta Panni cave, located in India, where the first Buddhist Synod was convened. The six entrances of The Maha Pasana Cave symbolize the Sixth Great Synod. The cave is long and wide. Inside, the assembly hall is long and wide. Background Mahapasana Guha Cave and Ordination Hall is adjacent to the Kaba Aye Pagoda. Mahapasana Guha Cave also hosts religious examination called the Tipitakadhara Tipitaka Kovida Examinations, an extensive recitation, oral and written examination on the Tipitaka, the religious body of works in Theravada Buddhism. Area at the time of the 6th Buddhist council, 1954‚Äì6. As prime minister of Burma, U Nu built the Kaba Aye Pagoda and the Maha Pasana Guha Cave () in 1952 in preparation for the Sixth Buddhist Synod that he convened and hosted and which lasted two years, from 1954‚Äì1956. This Synod coincided with the 2500-year anniversary of Buddha's enlightenment. In Burma, the kings traditionally built a pagoda in their honor to stand as a relic of their rule. For example, Ne Win built the Maha Wizaya Pagoda in his honor. The construction of the pagoda and cave were a part of U Nu's attempt to establish Buddhism as the official religion of Burma, thereby creating a Buddhist state. The Kaba Aye pagoda is open daily from 6 am to 8 pm, with an admission fee of $5. In addition to the Burmese who make religious pilgrimages, the pagoda attracts domestic as well as foreign tourists. The Kaba Aye Pagoda compound is large and is intended to be peaceful and quiet for the tourists, monks and devotees who visit. The circular platform surrounding the main pagoda is enclosed in the style of a cave-temple. There are five porches decorated with colorful arched pediments. Lotus flowers, lotus buds and swastikas are carved in stucco around the outside. The main pagoda is 117 feet 6 inches high, with smaller pagodas on the five porches each high. Vendors sell handmade products on the entrances to the pagoda. The pagoda, which is hollow, has a middle point inside which features four great Buddhas (four great pillars) in commemoration of the four Buddhas who have already appeared in the world. A room inside the pagoda houses Buddha relics, including a large silver statue of Buddha, over eight feet tall. There is also a room inside the pagoda, which is used to keep Buddha relics. The Maha Pasana Cave, which translates to ‚Äúgreat cave of stone,‚Äù is located to the north of the Kaba Aye pagoda. The cave is a replica to the cave by the same name in India, where the first Buddhist Synod or Great Council was held just some months after the Buddha underwent Parinirvana. During the sixth Buddhist Synod in 1954, 2500 monks converged on the cave to recite the words of the Buddha in Pali, the entire Tipitaka. The monks recited, edited, and approved all of the Buddhist scriptures, known as the Three Pitakat. Political significance U Nu was the first Prime Minister of Burma after the 1947 Constitution of the Union of Burma was passed. U Nu was a devout Buddhist and he tried to establish Burma as a Buddhist country. On August 29, 1961, the Parliament announced that Buddhism was the official state religion, mainly as a result of U Nu's efforts. Cow slaughtering was officially banned in Burma. However, in 1962 Ne Win, who succeeded U Nu, repealed this measure and the effort to make Burma a Buddhist country was effectively halted. The construction of the Kaba Aye complex was part of U Nu's attempt to institutionalize Buddhism at the national level. The Kaba Aye complex also underscores the failure of U Nu to standardize and institutionalize Buddhism. There are numerous minorities in Burma such as the Kachins and Karens who felt alienated by this effort to make Buddhism a state enterprise. Furthermore, Buddhists did not believe that Buddhism should be a part of a political institution. They wanted Burma to be a moral society but did not wish their religion to be imposed on the citizens. The monks who want religion to be a social practice that is separate from the state do not associate with these pagodas. Therefore, the pagodas such as the Kaba Aye are not affiliated with any monasteries. The fear is that if these monks become tied to a pagoda, which was built by the state and is run by the state, they will be captured by the state and lose their autonomy. Significance and Origin of Pagodas in Burma The most sacred pagoda in Burma is the Shwedagon Pagoda (Golden Pagoda). This pagoda towers at tall, is gilded in gold and is also located in Yangon. It, too, contains relics of the past four Buddhas inside of it. According to legend, the pagoda is 2500 years old. Burma is most famous to the western world because of the Shwedagon Pagoda. For the Burmese people, seeing foreign tourists visit the pagoda and looking at it in awe is a source of national pride. In the 11th century, King Anawrahta invaded the Mon Kingdom of Thaton in what is currently part of southern Burma. Following the successful invasion he returned to Pagan with the missionary monk Shin Arahan and the Buddhist scriptures he had brought with him from Ceylon. After establishing his Pagan dynasty through constant warfare, Anawrahta established Theravada Buddhism as the state religion in 1056 and built many pagodas. Some feel as though he built these pagodas in order to make up for the violent warfare by which he built his Pagan dynasty. Anawrahta implemented a tradition of pagoda building that has continued until the present. It was in keeping with this tradition that Ne Win began building his Maha Wizaya Pagoda. Furthermore, the military regime that succeeded him built the Swedawmyat (tooth relic) Pagoda. Currently, hundreds of pagodas dot the Burmese landscape. Scholars suggest that besides King Anawrahta, many other leaders built the pagodas not out of devotion to Buddhism, but rather to assuage the guilt that they felt for carrying out multiple invasions of other kingdoms in India and Thailand, in addition to other parts of what is currently Burma. 1996 bombings On December 25, 1996, two bombs exploded at the Kaba Aye Pagoda and Maha Pasana Cave, killing five people and wounding 17. The initial explosion took place at the Kaba Aye Pagoda at 8:20 pm, but nobody was injured because pilgrims did not use that entrance. However, the second explosion, which detonated two hours later as authorities were looking into the other blast, went off inside the temple as it was filling with pilgrims, causing the fatalities and injuries. At the Kaba Aye compound Buddha's tooth relic was on display, and thus many more pilgrims were at the site than during normal times. The tooth relic, on loan from China and believed to be one of two surviving since the Buddha's death 2500 years ago, was not damaged in the bombing.‚ÄúBuddha tooth pilgrims die in bomb blast‚Äù The Daily Telegraph (Sydney, Australia), December 27, 1996. The explosion followed a crackdown on student protestors who were demanding more civil liberties. The SLORC (State Law and Order Restoration Council) accused the All-Burma Students Democratic Front (ABSDF) and the KNU (Karen National Union) of carrying out the bombing. Both groups denied the accusation.\\"Opposition statement denies involvement in Buddha's tooth bombing‚Äù BBC Summary of World Broadcasts, December 30, 1996.

(1993a). \\"Popular Fashion And Working Class Affluence\\", Chic Thrills: A Fashion Reader. Berkley and Los Angeles, California: Pandora Press. 145-153. The key dynamics of this theory are as follows: *Adoption of new trends by all socioeconomic groups simultaneously *Consumers preference from a large scale of existing trends *Within each socioeconomic group there are fashion innovators that meet their preferred fashion demands *The flow of fashion information and individual influence in the fashion world 'trickles across' each social economic group *'Vertical flow' remains evident, it is primarily in the fashion industry e.g. fashion editors Leslie Davis Burns.

Sproles created 'the fashion mechanism, as a five-stage process propagated largely by social motivations' in the Mass Market Theory: *1. 'Adoption Leadership by \\"Consumer Fashion Change Agents' This stage is the introduction of the fashion innovation; these innovators are known for being 'leaders of collective taste' through social networking, invest in their interest of adopting new fashion as part of their stylish aspect. *2. 'The Social Visibility and Communicability Phase' In this stage the fashion goes through a \\"use cycle,\\" the latest fashion is categorized as \\"new\\" and \\"novel,\\" and will then develop to become highly detectable in the fashion industry portraying it as the 'latest fashion', disregarding present styles and trends. *3. 'Conformity Within and Across Social Systems' In this stage the 'latest fashion' will achieve a foundation through social networking to social acceptance by communication across social systems. Due to this 'diffusion process social contagion and social conformity then set new fashion tastes'. *4. 'Market and Social Saturation' If the latest fashion has made it to this stage, it will have attained its capital level of acceptance, therefore creating a form of \\"social saturation\\", therefore fashion is consistently utilized amongst the vast majority of individuals. *5. 'Decline and Obsolescence Forced By the Emergence of New Fashion Alternatives' The latest fashion will eventually come to a decline in the industry, removing it from being portrayed as 'new' and 'novel' due to the emerging trend or style that has been newly introduced as part of the \\"use\\" cycle. The fashion then experiences minimal usage and limited social acceptance eventually becoming obsolete. The fundamental aspect is that the fashion industry is being majorly influenced by 'social communications and social influence'.George B. Sproles. (1974). Fashion Theory: A Conceptual Framework. Available: https://www.acrwebsite.org/search/view-conference- proceedings.aspx?Id=5731. Last accessed 2nd Nov 2015. Social economic groups fashion preferences Juliet Ash, Elizabeth Wilson describes the difference in fashion preference as consumer choice widen and fashion becomes 'an integral part of identity formation'. More privileged societies tend to wear the same \\"classic\\" styles and disregard the latest fashions as they oppose an apparent \\"distinction of occupational achievement\\". The upper-middle classes desire clothing more \\"corresponding to wealth and high living\\". For the lower-middle classes tend to disregard \\"high style\\", for what is \\"daring\\" or \\"unusual\\". Individuals who are on a spending budget are more likely to purchase the 'latest trend' but frequently make their customised adaptions. Ultimately fashion opinion leaders influence the adoption and diffusion of fashions within a social group. When individuals play both roles of opinion, leader and innovator, they are referred to as \\"innovative communicators\\" within each social economic group. Implications of mass-market theory Due to the ease of access to all the fashion segments in the industry and at all prices, the development in the textiles of garments along with the expansion in retail trade has eradicated the differentiating social economic class. This allowed more distinctions to incur in these segments, including 'make', retail 'brand', fabric, as well as style and quality. Market trends derive in many social groups, including youthful urban subcultures.Diana Crane. (November 1999). Diffusion Models and Fashion: A Reassessment. Available: http://ann.sagepub.com/content/566/1/13.refs. Last accessed 2 November 2015.

Other fashion trends may even fail to all types of social economic groups.Marketing Theory: A Student Text. (31 March 2010). Summary and future outlook.

However, the Rhode Island Republican Party, although virtually non-existent in the Rhode Island General Assembly, occasionally puts forward statewide reform candidates. Former Governor Donald Carcieri of East Greenwich, and former Mayor Vincent A. \\"Buddy\\" Cianci of Providence (who later became an independent political boss, and was convicted on Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act charges) ran successfully as Republican reform candidates. Rhode Island has comprehensive health insurance for low-income children, and a large social safety net. Many urban areas still have a high rate of children in poverty. Due to an influx of residents from Boston, Massachusetts, increasing housing costs have resulted in more homeless in Rhode Island. Ranking Democrats include Governor Gina Raimondo, House Speaker Nicholas Mattiello, Senate President Dominick Ruggerio, U.S. Representatives David Cicilline and Jim Langevin, Secretary of State Nellie Gorbea, General Treasurer Seth Magaziner, Senate Majority Leader Michael McCaffrey, and Lt. Gov. Daniel McKee. In 2008, former Speaker of the House John Harwood, State Senator John Celona, and State Senate President William Irons resigned amid scandals. History Federalists vs. Anti- Federalists (1776-1820) Rhode Island declared independence from the British Empire on May 4, 1776, two months before the U.S. Declaration of Independence was ratified. However, despite this eagerness for independence, Rhode Island was also a stronghold for Anti-Federalism through the Country Party, which was widely popular among rural areas of Rhode Island and dominated the Rhode Island General Assembly from 1786 to 1790. The Country Party's dominance prevented ratification of the Federalist U.S. Constitution, and the state had even refused to send any delegation to the 1787 Constitutional Convention that wrote it. Father of the Constitution James Madison described Rhode Island as ruled by \\"wickedness and folly\\" in which \\"All sense of character as well as of right have been obliterated.\\" After the insurance of the inclusion of a bill of rights, however, support grew for the Constitution in Rhode Island. Rhode Island became the last of the original 13 states to ratify the Constitution in 1790 by only 2 votes, after Gov. John Collins supported it and several remaining Anti-Federalists boycotted the ratifying convention. After ratification, many Anti-Federalists remained with the Country Party or joined Thomas Jefferson's Anti-Administration faction, which eventually became the Democratic-Republican Party. Rhode Island's first 2 governors after ratification (Anti-Federalist leader Arthur Fenner and Henry Smith) were both nominees of the Country Party. Meanwhile, one of Rhode Island's first 2 Senators, Joseph Stanton, Jr., was a nominee of the Anti-Administration Party. Despite the Anti-Federalist views during the 1780s, the Federalist Party eventually became the dominant party in Rhode Island. Rhode Island gave its electoral votes in most Presidential elections to the Federalist candidate during this era. Meanwhile, Federalist Senator William Bradford became the 1st U.S. Senator from Rhode Island to serve as President pro tempore of the United States Senate during the 5th Congress. While the Federalist Party is generally considered to have died after the War of 1812, Rhode Island still had Federalists in the U.S. Congress as late as 1820, and Federalist Governor William Jones was not defeated by a Democratic-Republican candidate until Nehemiah R. Knight was elected in 1816. Democratic-Republican Era (1820s) In the 1820s, Rhode Island, like the rest of the union, was largely dominated by the Democratic-Republican Party. Knight, William C. Gibbs, and James Fenner (son of former Governor Arthur Fenner) were all elected Governors of Rhode Island during this time. After the party split into Andrew Jackson's Democratic Party and the opposition National Republican Party, Rhode Island was generally opposed to Jackson's policies and supportive of the Federalist- inspired policies of National Republican leaders John Quincy Adams and Henry Clay, supporting the former in the hotly contested Presidential elections of 1824 and 1828. Many of these \\"Anti-Jacksonians\\" or \\"Adams Men\\", such as Asher Robbins and former Governor Nehemiah R. Knight, represented the state in Congress before the formation of the Whig Party in 1833. Whig Era (1833-50) Rhode Island Congressmen were almost exclusively Whigs during the 1830s and early 1840s. Whigs Lemuel H. Arnold, Elisha Harris, Henry B. Anthony, and William W. Hoppin were also Governors of Rhode Island during this time. However, Democrats John Brown Francis and William Sprague III served for most of the 1830s. Rhode Island's electoral votes also backed the Presidential candidacies of Whig leaders William Henry Harrison in 1840, Henry Clay in 1844, and Zachary Taylor in 1848. =Dorr Rebellion (1840-42)= In 1841, Rhode Island was the last state to still require ownership of property to vote in its elections, as it was still governed by the provisions of its original colonial charter of 1663, which restricted voting rights to landowning white men and their eldest sons. About 60% of Rhode Island adult men were ineligible to vote due to these restrictions by 1840. Political activist Thomas Wilson Dorr was the leader of a group known as the Rhode Island Suffrage Association (or \\"Dorrites\\") that attempted to amend or replace the charter with a new constitution extending suffrage to all white men, but efforts to do so consistently failed in the Rhode Island General Assembly. After failed attempts to change the system from within, the Dorrites held a convention for the newly formed \\"People's Party\\", which drafted a new constitution that enfranchised all white men after one year's residence. Meanwhile, General Assembly members who supported the charter, known as \\"Charterites\\" or the \\"Law and Order Party\\", drafted a constitution that made concessions to the People's Party, but 2 referenda held later that year determined that a majority of voters approved of the People's Party constitution, but disapproved of the Law and Order Party's constitution by a narrow margin. However, Governor Samuel Ward King, a Charterite, refused to recognize the results of the referenda, resulting in the holding of two elections that April: one set up by the People's Party, which elected Dorr as governor, and another set up by the Law and Order Party, which re-elected King. King and Dorr essentially served as governors concurrently after this election. King declared martial law and attempted to persuade U.S. President John Tyler to send federal soldiers to Rhode Island to resolve the issue, but Tyler, feeling that the threat of violence was \\"hourly diminishing\\", refused. Without the threat of federal interference, Dorr's government mounted an attack upon the Providence Arsenal on May 19, 1842. Charterite defenders, including Dorr's own father and uncle, suppressed the attack and the Dorrites retreated to the village of Chepachet to hold another People's Convention. Charterites cut off the retreat in the city of Woonsocket, causing Dorr's government to fall. Despite their victory, the Charterite General Assembly ultimately drafted and adopted the current Rhode Island Constitution in September 1842, which extended voting to all free men (of any race) who owned property or could pay a $1 poll tax. Although the former members of the People's Party attempted to oppose the Law and Order Party's candidates in the 1843 elections, the Law and Order Party took all major offices in these elections, and their new constitution was adopted in May. Encouraged by the new constitution's expanded suffrage, Dorr returned to the state, but was captured by King and tried and convicted of treason. However, public protests resulted in Dorr's pardon by Governor James Fenner in 1845. =Law and Order Party and Whig Party co-dominance (1840s)= After the Dorr Rebellion ended, the Law and Order Party shared power with the Whigs for the remainder of the 1840s, until the former dissolved and the latter fell from power in Rhode Island. The Law and Order Party's James Fenner was the first governor elected under the Rhode Island Constitution. Fenner had previously served as governor on two other occasions as a member of the Democratic-Republican Party. Byron Diman also represented the Law and Order Party as governor. In 1843, Rhode Island was given a 2nd Congressional district. The Law and Order Party's Elisha R. Potter was the first Congressman from this district. The 2nd district also elected Benjamin Babock Thurston to Congress in 1847; Thurston was the first Democrat elected to Congress from Rhode Island. In the late 1840s and early 1850s, the nationally declining Whig Party became diminished in Rhode Island, while the Law and Order Party dissolved, and most of its members returned to their pre-Dorr Rebellion allegiances to the Whigs or Democrats. Republican Era (1850s-1930s) After the demise of the Rhode Island Whigs, the Know Nothing and Democratic Parties were briefly co-dominant parties in Rhode Island. From 1851 to 1853, Rhode Island had an all-Democrat set of executive offices for the first time, led by Governor Philip Allen. In the same year, Charles Tillinghast James became Rhode Island's first Democratic Senator. Meanwhile, Benjamin Babock Thurston returned to his Congressional seat as a Know-Nothing, and William W. Hoppin was Rhode Island's only Know-Nothing governor in 1854, serving in the office until 1856. In the late 1850s, however, much of the remaining Know- Nothings and Whigs nationally were absorbed by the Republican Party, which would become the dominant party in Rhode Island until the Great Depression of the 1930s. Republican dominance in Rhode Island began with the elections of several Republicans to major offices in 1857, such as Governor Elisha Dyer, and Sen. James F. Simmons. The first 14 Republican Party Presidential candidates, beginning with John C. Fr√©mont in 1856, won Rhode Island's electoral votes during this era. The Constitutional Union Party became strong in Rhode Island during the early 1860s. Across the country, many conservative former Whigs and Know-Nothings, unsatisfied with the secessionists in the national Democratic Party, became Unionists, and nominated Unionist candidates at their state conventions. Both Rhode Island representatives to the 37th U.S. House of Representatives were Unionists. During the American Civil War, Rhode Island was the first state to respond to President Abraham Lincoln's 1861 request for troops from the individual Union states. Governor William Sprague IV (nephew of former Governor William Sprague III) believed that the war would be over rather quickly and easily in the Union's favor, and chose to lead the Rhode Island brigade to Virginia to oversee what he expected to be a Union victory. There, he participated in the First Battle of Bull Run and, despite the Confederate victory, was offered a commission as Brigadier General, which he refused, opting to remain Governor of Rhode Island. Sprague went on to serve 2 six-year terms as a Senator from Rhode Island after retiring from the Governor's post in 1863. Burnside also became a Governor of Rhode Island from 1866 to 1869, and then replaced Sprague in the U.S. Senate in 1875, serving there until his death in 1881. From 1863 to 1887, every governor of and U.S. Congressman from Rhode Island was a member of the Republican Party. During this time, Senator Henry B. Anthony served as President pro tempore of the United States Senate, the 2nd Rhode Island Senator to do so, after William Bradford in 1797. Also during this time, Governor Henry Lippitt became the first in a familial line of several prominent Rhode Island politicians, dating to Governor Lincoln Chafee, and including one of Lippitt's sons, Sen. Henry F. Lippitt, who was a brother-in-law of U.S. President and Chief Justice William Howard Taft. Also, the administration of three-term Governor Alfred H. Littlefield officially established the current boundary line of Rhode Island and Massachusetts, and authorized the establishment of the state's first industrial school for impoverished children, in an effort to update the state's education system to keep in time with manufacturing developments. In 1887, some Democratic power returned when prominent Democratic businessman John W. Davis was elected governor over incumbent Republican George P. Wetmore, with whom many in both parties were dissatisfied. During Davis' first one-year term, a women's suffrage amendment to the State Constitution was passed by the state legislature but not accepted by the state's male voters in an April 6, 1887 referendum. Also during Davis' first term, the current boundary line with Connecticut was established, revised election laws were passed which made voter fraud more difficult, and orphanages were regulated by the state. However, Davis was defeated in his 1888 and 1889 gubernatorial bids, but Davis returned to the governorship for another one-year term in 1890. Another popular Democrat during Rhode Island's Republican Era was Lucius F.C. Garvin, a longtime General Assembly member from Cumberland and eventual governor, serving two one-year terms. However, a Republican-controlled legislature prevented most of Garvin's reform-minded programs from passing. Garvin was considered for the Democratic nomination for U.S. President in 1904. In the late 19th century and early 20th century, there was much controversy in the state political system surrounding Republican leader and lobbyist Charles R. Brayton, who generally supported the interests of Republican Senators Henry B. Anthony and Nelson W. Aldrich. As both a Civil War veteran and a member of the state's \\"economic elite\\", Brayton was easily supported by the majority of Rhode Islanders, and is credited with helping many candidates into office, including Sen. Aldrich, who would later become one of the most prominent U.S. Senators. Brayton rose to political prominence in Rhode Island in the 1890s as a chairman of the Republican State Committee, and eventually as a member of the Republican National Committee. Brayton campaigned heavily for the passage of laws shifting gubernatorial powers, including almost all appointment powers, to the State Senate, which was reliably a Republican majority. The \\"Brayton Act\\" was a major hindrance to Democratic reformers such as Governor Garvin after its passage, and would continue to hinder gubernatorial power until Democrats gained a State Senate majority in 1935. Brayton also had a political rivalry with James H. Higgins, another Democratic governor during Rhode Island's Republican Era. Higgins greatly opposed Brayton's lobbying, claiming Brayton was paid by railroad and telephone companies to lobby their special interests. Brayton did not deny this, but said that he never lobbied against the interests of the Republican Party to favor a corporation's interest. In 1912, President Taft's reelection campaign was the first Republican campaign to not receive Rhode Island's electoral votes, despite the fact that he was a 5th cousin of former Governor Royal C. Taft. Democrat Woodrow Wilson, who won the election, was the first Democrat to receive Rhode Island's electoral votes since Franklin Pierce in 1852, before the founding of the Republican Party. Also in 1912, the Republican ticket for executive offices, led by Aram J. Pothier, who was also the first Rhode Island governor of foreign birth (born in Quebec), won the first 2-year executive terms, having previously served four 1-year terms. Upon the beginning of the Great Depression in 1929, Republican Norman S. Case was Governor of Rhode Island. Although he was reelected in 1930, the Depression worsened and Republican popularity lessened, and Theodore F. Green summarily defeated Case in 1932. The Depression is generally cited as the primary reason for the fall of Republicans in Rhode Island, transitioning to a period of Democratic dominance which continues today. Democratic Era (1930s-present) In the 1932 and 1934 elections, Democrats officially swept Republicans out of power in the state. Theodore F. Green easily defeated Republican Governor Norman S. Case in the 1932 gubernatorial election. Democrat Peter G. Gerry, who served 2 terms in the U.S. Senate before the Depression, reclaimed his former seat by defeating incumbent Republican Senator Felix Hebert. In the State Senate elections in 1934, 2 seats were contested, both held by Republicans, but Democratic victories in these districts would create a Democratic Party majority in the Senate. Lt. Gov. Robert Quinn, assigned to preside over seating the newly elected State Senators, refused to seat the Republicans who had claimed re-election to those two seats. Green demanded a recount on January 1, 1935, and the recount determined that the Democratic candidates in both districts had won by narrow margins. This has become known as the \\"Bloodless Revolution\\", as Republicans have struggled to regain power in Rhode Island since. Republicans remained in some power throughout the 1930s, as Charles Risk served the 1st Congressional district in the 74th and 76th Congresses. In 1938, many Republicans, led by gubernatorial candidate William Henry Vanderbilt III, was elected into office, including retaking control of both houses of the General Assembly. However, in 1939, Vanderbilt's support was seriously weakened by a wire-tapping scandal involving a private detective he had hired to search for election fraud. The scandal cost him his re-election chances, and many Republicans elected in 1938 were defeated by Democratic challengers in 1940; Democrats also regained a majority in both houses of the General Assembly, and have not lost it since. Meanwhile, many prominent Rhode Island Democrats also became nationally prominent under Democratic Presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt and Harry S. Truman. The most notable of these was former Governor Green, who successfully ran for Senate in 1936, and served there until 1960, finally retiring in ill health at age 93, the oldest Congressman in history at the time. Green was known as \\"the President's man\\", as a strong supporter of Democratic Presidents, and one of Republican President Dwight D. Eisenhower's strongest Democratic supporters. Green was also a civil rights leader, working closely with then-Majority Leader Lyndon B. Johnson to pass voting rights bills, such as the Civil Rights Act of 1957. The state's largest airport is named T.F. Green Airport after him. J. Howard McGrath, first a governor after defeating incumbent Vanderbilt in 1940, also went on to serve for many years in a federal capacity. McGrath was appointed U.S. Solicitor General by Truman in October 1945, and served there for one year, before resigning to become a Senator in the 80th Congress, which had Republican majorities in both houses. However, he chaired the U.S. Senate Committee on the District of Columbia at the beginning of the Democrat-ruled 81st Congress. McGrath was also chairman of the Democratic National Committee during this time, allowing for racial integration of the Democrats' national headquarters and successfully managing President Truman's 1948 reelection campaign. For this, McGrath was promoted to United States Attorney General, until his resignation in 1952, after refusing to be investigated after suspected corruption.Marcus, Truman and the Steel Seizure Case: The Limits of Presidential Power, 1977, p. 35-36. With McGrath's resignation to become Solicitor-General, then-Lt. Gov. John O. Pastore became the first Italian-American governor in U.S. history, and would later become the first Italian-American U.S. Senator. As governor, Pastore enacted Rhode Island's first sales taxes, corporate income taxes, and primary election laws. Pastore retired from his post as governor upon winning a special election to replace McGrath in the U.S. Senate, where Pastore would serve until 1976, where he was famously involved in a 1969 Senate hearing on the funding of PBS in which famous public TV host Fred Rogers testified successfully against President Richard Nixon's proposed PBS funding cuts. McGrath and Pastore were 2 of many Democrats who served lengthy amounts of time in the U.S. Senate or House of Representatives during their time. Between 1941 and 1976, Rhode Island sent only 11 different people to the U.S. Congress, all of them Democrats, including Pastore, McGrath, and Green. Other notables included: 12-term Rep. Aime Forand, who proposed the first bill for the program that eventually became Medicare; Rep. John E. Fogarty, who became a national political leader on medical research as a longtime member of the House Appropriations Committee; 14-term Rep. Fernand St. Germain, Rep. Forand's successor, who was involved in passing legislation that would ultimately be blamed for the savings and loan crisis of the 1980s-90s. Back in Rhode Island itself, 4-term Governor J. Joseph Garrahy became iconic for his handling of the Blizzard of 1978, during which Governor \\"Joe\\" kept a calm, casual, comforting demeanor while living at his State House office for about a week to manage the crisis and maintain order. Perhaps the most notable member of the Democratic dynasty of the 1940s-70s, though, was Sen. Claiborne Pell. Best known as the father of Pell Grants, Claiborne Pell was elected to the U.S. Senate after a lengthy career as a U.S. Department of State diplomat, during which time he had been involved in the drafting of the United Nations Charter. Pell was first elected in 1960 upon the retirement of T.F. Green, after defeating both former Gov. Dennis J. Roberts and former U.S. Attorney General J. Howard McGrath in the Democratic primary election. Senator Pell was considered eccentric by D.C. politicians due to his insistence on using only public transportation and low-cost automobiles, and supposed paranormal beliefs, and was often considered the least electable politician in Washington; however, Rhode Island would ultimately reelect him to the Senate 5 times. Sen. Pell is best remembered as the creator of \\"Basic Educational Opportunity Grants\\" in 1973 (now known as Pell Grants) that provide financial aid to American university students. Pell was also largely responsible for the creation of the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities, and was chairman of the U.S. Senate Committee on Foreign Relations for 8 years later in his tenure. Having served for 36 years upon his retirement, Claiborne Pell is the longest-serving U.S. Senator in Rhode Island history. Return of Republicans and Rise of 3rd-Parties (1976-present) In his 36 years in the Senate, Claiborne Pell served alongside only 2 other U.S. Senators from Rhode Island: John Pastore, and John Chafee, the first Republican U.S. Senator from Rhode Island in 40 years, and a prominent Rockefeller Republican. Chafee had previously served 3 two-year terms as governor in the 1960s; his administration was celebrated for championing public transportation and environmental conservation, but ended in a surprise reelection loss to Democrat Frank Licht after Chafee both reversed his anti- income tax stance and had to lessen his campaign efforts due to family matters. Chafee first ran for the U.S. Senate as a challenger Sen. Claiborne Pell in 1972, but Pell held the seat by a result of 54%-46%. However, Chafee ran again in 1976 to replace the retiring Sen. John O. Pastore and defeated Democrat Richard Lorber 58%-42%. Sen. Chafee broke with his own party on many issues, most notably on environmental issues, which Chafee made his main concern as a Senator. Chafee authored the Coastal Barrier Resources Act that designated protected coastal areas that became ineligible to government development and was also instrumental to the passages of the Superfund program, the Clean Water Act and the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, and later chaired the U.S. Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works. Chafee was described as a moderate, but was among the most liberal U.S. Senators on social issues during his time. Upon his death in October 1999, Chafee was posthumously awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Bill Clinton, and his son Lincoln Chafee was appointed to replace his father; the elder Chafee had already announced his plans to retire at the end of his term and the younger Chafee had already announced his plans to run to succeed him. Meanwhile, the Chafees' tenure in the U.S. Senate corresponded to some return to Republicans holding major state offices in Rhode Island, although the Democrats always held their majority in both houses of the General Assembly. In 1984, Republican Edward DiPrete was elected after Governor Garrahy's retirement and went on to serve 3 terms as governor despite the Democrats consistently holding over 85% of Assembly seats. However, DiPrete was widely suspected of corruption (and would later do time in prison for bribery, extortion, and racketeering), and ultimately lost in a landslide to Democrat Bruce Sundlun in 1990, the third time that Sundlun had challenged the incumbent DiPrete. Sundlun immediately closed 45 banks and credit unions due to the collapse of the RI Share and Deposit Indemnity Corporation (RISDIC) under DiPrete. Sundlun became a champion of improving infrastructure and tourism, working across the aisle with controversial Providence Mayor Buddy Cianci (who would also later do time in prison for \\"racketeering conspiracy\\", i.e. running the city of Providence as a criminal enterprise) to support the building of or improvement of key infrastructure such as the Rhode Island Convention Center, Quonset Air Museum, T.F. Green Airport, Providence Place Mall, and more. The work of the Cianci and Sundlun administrations launched what became known as the city of Providence's \\"Renaissance\\" period in which infrastructure, the arts, and the economy were all booming. Sundlun was the last Rhode Island governor to be elected to 2-year terms; beginning in 1994, governors (and all other state offices) would be elected for 4-year terms and limited to 2 such terms. In a surprising upset, Gov. Sundlun lost the 1994 Democratic primary to strongly liberal State Senator Myrth York, who was then defeated by Republican Lincoln Almond by a slim margin of 47%-44% in the general election (3rd-party activist Robert J. Healey won 9%). Beginning with York's loss in 1994, Democrats would go on to lose five consecutive gubernatorial elections, despite maintaining their supermajorities in both houses of the General Assembly and Rhode Island's 4 electoral votes always going to Democratic candidates in Presidential election years during those 20 years. Between Governor Almond and his successor, Gov. Donald Carcieri, Republicans held the Rhode Island governorship for the longest period of time (16 years) since the 19th century. Gov. Almond prioritized health care, making significant expansions to the public children's health care program Rite Care and making Rhode Island among the states with the highest percentage of people having health insurance. Almond was also instrumental in the creation of the Community College of Rhode Island's Newport campus funded by a bond referendum passed with the Governor's support in 2000, and made major investments to improve and modernize the University of Rhode Island, his alma mater. When Almond was term-limited in 2002, conservative businessman Donald Carcieri defeated party-endorsed Jim Bennett in the Republican primary and then defeated 3rd-time Democratic nominee Myrth York to become Almond's successor, and was thrust into the national spotlight early in his term by The Station nightclub fire of February 2003. Carcieri's governorship was characterized by conflicts with the General Assembly and organized labor, as Carcieri often attacked the state government's expansive welfare programs and history of corruption but could do little to enact changes due to the Democrat-controlled Assembly's ability to override his vetoes. The Assembly also overrode Carcieri's vetoes of bills to legalize medical marijuana and make progress on LGBT civil rights issues. The latter position was particularly controversial with Rhode Islanders; the year of Carcieri's first election, 2002, was also the year that Providence elected the first openly homosexual mayor of a U.S. state capital, David Cicilline, in a landslide election, and Carcieri won reelection in 2006 against Lt. Gov. Charles J. Fogarty by only 2 percentage points. Also in 2006, Sen. Lincoln Chafee lost the seat that had been held by him or his father for 30 years. Former State Attorney General Sheldon Whitehouse defeated Chafee by a margin of 53.5%-46.5% in an election that was part of a national swing to a Democratic majority in both houses of the U.S. Congress. Chafee, one of the most left-of-center Senators at the time, later admitted that his loss to Whitehouse was good for the country since it helped give the majority to the Democrats, and Chafee later disaffiliated from the Republican Party and announced a run for governor for 2010. In the 2010 gubernatorial election, there were four major candidates: State Treasurer Frank T. Caprio for the Democrats, John Robitaille for the Republicans, former Sen. Lincoln Chafee as an independent, and businessman Ken Block, who had founded the Moderate Party of Rhode Island in 2009 to advocate for meaningful political, economic, and educational reform. The Moderate Party's founding involved a court battle for official recognition that ended in the overturning of several laws that made it much easier for 3rd-party and independent candidates to gain ballot access in elections beginning in 2010. The 4-way race gained international attention when President Barack Obama, to whom Chafee has been a political ally, refused to endorse a candidate, and Caprio publicly told the President of the United States to \\"take his endorsement and really shove it.\\" Caprio's remark hurt his campaign such that, despite being a Democrat in a heavily Democratic state, he ultimately placed third with just 23% of the vote. Chafee won the race with 36%, just about 2.5 percentage points more than Robitaille, while Block earned 6.5%, enough to gain major party status for the Moderate Party. Chafee became Rhode Island's first independent governor since the 18th century. He also immediately proved to be a very unpopular governor, likely owing to the fact that 64% of Rhode Islanders voted for someone else. Chafee's approval ratings fell further when he proposed a variety of tax increases, and he stirred up national controversy when he stood by his decision to refer to the annual State House Christmas tree as a \\"Holiday Tree\\" in the name of separation of church and state. Among Gov. Chafee's accomplishments was passing LGBT marriage equality. Also in 2010, Providence Mayor David Cicilline won the District 1 House of Representatives seat being vacated by retiring Rep. Patrick J. Kennedy, and fellow Democrat Angel Taveras won the election to succeed Cicilline as Mayor in a landslide. Shortly after taking office in 2011, Taveras discovered that he had inherited over $180 million in debt that Cicilline had largely hidden from the public through what was described by Providence City Council Finance Chairman John Igliozzi as \\"illusory revenue, borrowing and other tricks.\\" Cicilline's approval ratings just a few months after winning federal office went below 20% as the vast majority of voters blamed Cicilline for the city's financial woes, which ultimately required controversial austerity-like measures to prevent the city of Providence from declaring bankruptcy. Rep. Cicilline was also accused by District 2 Rep. James Langevin of gerrymandering by tampering with the regular redrawing of district lines to ensure his own reelection in 2012, which, despite the controversies, Cicilline did win with 53% of the vote. In 2014, Governor Chafee, having officially joined the Democratic Party in 2013 and facing massive unpopularity and likely primary challengers, chose not to run for reelection. The primaries in both parties were hotly contested: on the Democratic side, venture capitalist and State Treasurer Gina Raimondo, perceived as a fiscally center-right frontrunner, defeated Providence Mayor Angel Taveras and Clay Pell (grandson of the late Sen. Pell) after unions and other liberals divided almost evenly between the 2 more liberal challengers, while on the Republican side, Moderate Party founder Ken Block left his own party to run as a Republican, only to be defeated in the primary by conservative Cranston Mayor Allan Fung. Without Block, the Moderate Party had nominated James Spooner for governor, but when he became severely ill, Robert J. Healey, who had previously run for governor or lieutenant governor 6 times on the platform of his own \\"Cool Moose Party,\\" was announced as the substitute nominee with less than 2 months until election day. Spending less than $40 in total and campaigning mostly through social media, a blog, and organizing charity fundraisers, Healey's \\"guerrilla campaign\\" stunned pundits and pollsters by winning 22% of the vote and even winning pluralities in a few towns. Ultimately, however, Raimondo defeated Fung to become Rhode Island's first female governor by a margin of 40%-36%. Meanwhile, the election to replace Taveras as Mayor of Providence saw former Mayor and convicted felon Buddy Cianci attempt to return to politics. The race was seen by many as a referendum on Cianci's legacy, with supporters pointing to the improved infrastructure, city parks, arts scene, and other gains associated with the city's \\"Renaissance\\" during Cianci's time as Mayor, while detractors pointed to Cianci's history of violent, criminal behavior and frank, less-than-remorseful admissions to using \\"public power for personal reasons.\\" In a rare move into municipal politics, President Obama publicly endorsed Cianci's little-known Democratic challenger, Jorge Elorza, as did Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, who, as a U.S. Attorney, oversaw the investigation that led to Cianci's racketeering charges and eventual conviction in 2002. Even the Republican nominee for Mayor, Dan Harrop, urged citizens to vote for his Democratic opponent Elorza, citing concerns that Cianci would not have the city's best interests at heart. Ultimately, Elorza proved victorious by a margin of 53%-44% over Cianci. It was the first election that Cianci has ever lost.

It is located at a latitude 01¬∫11'48 \\"south and a longitude 46¬∫08'24\\" west, being at an altitude of 15 meters. Its estimated population in 2017 was 59,735 inhabitants according to IBGE. It has an area of 4,915,073 km2 and, thus, the population density of 12.09 inhabitants/km2. Most people are Catholic, according to the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE). The municipal HDI is 0.515. The lands visuenses were discovered around June 24, 1531 by the navigator Diogo Leite. There is also a Vila Nazar√© known as the village of km 74 that is part of Viseu. It is where there are some loggers of the region. With two Schools, Mail, Medical Office, CR√ÅS, ADEPAR√Å, The beautiful church of St. Benedict, One of the founders of the Village still alive \\"Sr Alves\\" Patron of the Alves Family.  History  The first navigator to land in Portugal was Diogo Leite in 1531, commanded by Martim Afonso de Sousa, who entered the bar of the Gurupi and Turia√ßu rivers, commanding two vessels named Princess and Rosa, a fact corroborated by the historians Francisco Adolfo de Varnhagen (Visconde Porto Seguro) and Maur√≠cio Martins Meireles. Diogo Leite gave his name to an open, which until today is the subject of discussions among historians, who have doubts about the location of this open: for some (like the Visconde of Porto Seguro) it would be at the mouth of the Gurupi river; for others like Jaime Cortes√£o D'Avezac, it would be located in the river Turia√ßu. The location of the Abra and not the arrival of that navigator at the mouth of the Gurupi River as early as 1531 is discussed, since they are quite plausible in stating that he actually arrived in the present lands of the municipality of Viseu, of the foundation of the city of Bel√©m and 103 years before the foundation of Sousa do Caet√© (present Bragan√ßa, which was founded only in 1634). Situated in the Gurupi area, it was originally inhabited by the Tupinamb√°s, Trememb√©s and Apotiangas Indians. In the 19th century, the Urubus- Kaapor Indians, considered a warlike and violent nation, migrated to the Gurupi, and there were numerous conflicts involving these Indians, the region's black quilombos and the whites. The French began to settle in Maranh√£o around 1594 and remained there until they were expelled and left definitively on November 3, 1615, after being surrounded by troops under the command of Alexandre de Moura. Before that, in 1613, the then Governor General Gaspar de Sousa sent an expedition to the region under the command of Diogo de Campos, who persuaded Jer√¥nimo de Albuquerque to build a fort on the Piri√° River in order to establish alliances with the Tremembes Indians. After the victory of the Portuguese in the region, the Kingdom began a real process of occupation of the region to avoid new invasions. It was in this way that through the Royal Charter of February 9, 1622, King Philip III of Spain (remember the Iberian Union) donated the Captaincy of the Gurupi to Gaspar de Sousa, which ran from the river Caet√© to the river Turia√ßu, having 20 leagues in the background. According to the archives of the Historical and Geographical Institute of Par√°, the Royal Charter of Felipe III of 1622 gave Gaspar de Sousa the legitimate right to choose a place or place of the Captaincy to benefit and make it populate. However, Gaspar de Sousa died without defining the place or place in which he preferred to fix his concession. In 1624, a Paradox (dated March 19, 1624) of King Felipe III ordered Francisco Coelho de Carvalho (then Governor of Maranh√£o) to distribute the lands of Maranh√£o to the settlers and cultivators who wanted them. The first settlement on the bank of the Gurupi River, which was named Vera Cruz, was only definitively founded in April 1627, on the orders of Francisco Coelho de Carvalho, and was composed of Indians and dwellers who were taken from Par√° and Maranh√£o. In 1758, three parishes were founded in the municipality of Viseu, which remained where today is the city of Viseu, S√£o Jos√© do Gurupi and S√£o Jos√© do Piri√° (founded in 1751 by the governor Francisco Xavier de Mendon√ßa Furtado). In 1655, Father Ant√¥nio Vieira founded the Jesuit mission of St. John the Baptist in the Gurupi River (more precisely in the town of Vera Cruz), which remained in that village until 1672, when it was transferred to Caet√©. Vera Cruz was founded to be a connecting city between Bethlehem and St. Louis. Because the port of Vera Cruz was very shallow, the town was eventually abandoned by the rulers. This fact helped the migration of people from Vera Cruz to Sousa do Caet√©. Although its lands were known from 1531 and received the visit of French and Portuguese in 1613, the city of Viseu was only definitively occupied in Century XVIII, having in 1758, was founded a parish. In 1781, the founding of the present city of Viseu was officialized, according to the letter of January 27, 1781, of the Governor of Par√°, Jos√© de N√°poles Tello de Menezes to the Minister and Secretary of State, Martinho de Melo e Castro: \\"...

Gloria is a Democrat and represents the 78th Assembly District, which encompasses much of San Diego. He is also serving as House Majority Whip. Prior to his election to the Assembly in 2016, Gloria served as the member of the San Diego City Council representing District 3. He was president of the nine-member council from 2012 through 2014. In his role as council president, Gloria served as interim Mayor of San Diego from the August 2013 resignation of Mayor Bob Filner until the March 2014 inauguration of Mayor Kevin Faulconer. On January 9, 2019, Gloria announced his candidacy for Mayor of San Diego in the 2020 election. In announcing his campaign, he focused on housing affordability, homelessness, and climate change, and he promised to build a \\"world class public transportation system.\\" Early life and education Gloria is a third generation resident of San Diego. All four of his grandparents moved to the area because of their involvement with the military. He has described his ethnic background as \\"[b]asically half Native American (Tlingit-Haida, an Alaskan tribe), a quarter Filipino, and then a little bit of Dutch and Puerto Rican.\\" Gloria grew up in the Clairemont neighborhood and attended Madison High School. He was interested in politics from childhood. At age 10, he was runner-up in a \\"mayor for a day\\" contest. At 14, he volunteered to work for Democratic candidates in the 1992 election. Gloria graduated summa cum laude from the University of San Diego, with majors in history and political science. While a student at USD, Gloria was active in the effort to add sexual orientation to the campus nondiscrimination policy. He was also a member of Delta Lambda Phi.  Career  U.S. Congresswoman Susan Davis has been Gloria's political mentor since they met in 1993: Davis was the director of the Aaron Price Fellows Program, a leadership program for high school students focused on civic education and cross-cultural understanding, and Gloria was a high school freshman. In 2002, Gloria became Davis's district director, a position he held until his election to the City Council in 2008.Writer to hold funeral for unpublished novel  The San Diego Union-Tribune Gloria also served as a San Diego Housing Commissioner from 2005 until 2008. Openly gay, he is also a former chairman of the San Diego LGBT Community Center and was a resident panelist on San Diego's Prostitution Impact Panel. San Diego City Council Elections Council Member Todd Gloria speaking at a San Diego Workforce Partnership function Gloria ran for the District 3 seat vacated by the termed-out Toni Atkins in the 2008 election. He received a plurality of votes in the June 2008 primary, leading to a November run-off election against fellow Democrat Stephen Whitburn, a former journalist, community activist, and ally of then District 6 Councilmember Donna Frye.Opposing forces  The San Diego Union-Tribune Gloria defeated Whitburn with 54.3% of the vote. In the 2012 election, Gloria ran for re-election unopposed and was re-elected in the June primary. As of his second term, District 3 included the neighborhoods of Balboa Park, Bankers Hill/Park West, Downtown San Diego, Golden Hill, Hillcrest, Little Italy, Mission Hills, Normal Heights, North Park, Old Town, and University Heights. Tenure Gloria and San Diego mayor Kevin Faulconer at a San Diego Comic-Con event in 2014 Gloria was chair of the city's Budget and Finance Committee from 2011 to 2016. Gloria represented San Diego on the San Diego Metropolitan Transit System Board and SANDAG, where he chaired the transportation committee. In December 2012, at its first meeting after new members took office, Gloria was unanimously elected to serve as Council President, replacing retiring President Tony Young. Upon the resignation of Mayor Bob Filner on August 30, 2013, Gloria became the interim mayor of San Diego, with limited powers. This made San Diego the second largest city in the United States (after Houston) to have an openly gay mayor at that time. He served until March 3, 2014, when mayor-elect Kevin Faulconer was sworn in. While serving as interim mayor, he remained the City Councilmember for District 3 and retained the title of City Council President; however, City Council President Pro Tem Sherri Lightner carried out the duties of the Council President. Gloria was considered a possible candidate to replace Filner but chose not to run. As interim mayor, Gloria reversed several of Filner's actions. In September 2013, he ordered city police and zoning code officers to resume enforcement actions against medical marijuana shops; in one of his first actions as mayor, Filner had ordered city staff to stop such enforcement. He also announced the city would re-hire lobbying firms in Sacramento and Washington that Filner had fired. Gloria ordered that public records be made more quickly and easily available to citizens, in contrast to the cumbersome centralized process established by Filner. On December 10, 2014, the city council voted 4‚Äì5 on a motion of whether to reappoint Gloria as council president for the new term, with Sherri Lightner joining the four council Republicans to defeat the measure. The council then voted 7‚Äì2 to appoint Lightner as council president, with Gloria and David Alvarez in opposition. California State Assembly On April 7, 2015, Gloria announced that he would run in 2016 for the California State Assembly 78th district seat held by Assembly Speaker Toni Atkins, who was termed out. Gloria was immediately endorsed by Atkins and by Sarah Boot, who had previously announced her own candidacy for Atkins's seat but withdrew upon Gloria's announcement. On November 8, 2016, Gloria was easily elected over his relatively unknown Republican opponent with the second-highest margin of victory in San Diego County. He was easily re-elected in 2018 with over 70 percent of the vote in both the primary and the general elections. Shortly after assuming office in 2016, Gloria was chosen by Speaker Anthony Rendon to join democratic leadership in the Assembly as Assistant Majority Whip. In January 2018, he moved up in leadership to the position of Majority Whip. 2020 mayoral campaign Gloria announced his candidacy for mayor of San Diego in 2020 on January 9, 2019. Gloria's campaign focuses on issues such as the housing crisis, affordability, public transportation, and climate change. Gloria would be the first openly LGBTQ elected mayor of San Diego if he wins the 2020 race. Gloria was endorsed by several politicians including Governor Gavin Newsom, former Governor Jerry Brown, and San Diego City Attorney Mara Elliott. On August 20, 2019, Gloria won the San Diego County Democratic Party's endorsement vote by receiving 70% of the votes, exceeding the 60% required to win. Gloria's rival Barbara Bry won 14% of the votes, while the next runner-up Tasha Williamson won 3% of the votes. This endorsement allowed the party to spend money on his behalf in the campaign. In August 2019, Gloria was accused of collecting funds for his 2020 re-election campaign to the State Assembly before filing his intent to run with the state in violation of state law. Gloria claimed this was a technical oversight and filed the relevant paperwork the next day. In November 2019, Gloria settled the case with the California Fair Political Practices Commission, paying a $200 fine.

However, in 1842 Baldwin was appointed to the Executive Council in the provincial government. Under the law at that time, he was required to resign his seat and stand for election again. In the resulting by-election, Murney defeated Baldwin.C√¥t√©, Political Appointments and Elections in the Province of Canada 1841 to 1860, p. 59 note (10).

The company also built the Horndraulic brand of front loaders for fitting to agricultural tractors. Background Steelfab Steel Fabricators Limited was founded in Birmingham in 1935 to manufacture pressed and sheet metal work. During the 1939 to 1945 period the company was solely engaged on government contracts, and the factory occupied an area of , and there were some 50 employees. In 1946, to meet expansion plans, the company relocated to Pengam Road, Cardiff and won large contracts, including supplying the frames for the BISF house project and Rigid Form beams for the then Ministry of Works. History In the early 1950s it was decided to go into the backhoe loader market, which resulted in the introduction of the \\"Scout\\" Digger, manufactured under license to the Shawnee Manufacturing Company of the USA. Many hundreds of \\"Scout\\" diggers were sold, but the unit did have its limitations and the \\"Shawnee Warrior\\" digger was designed to supersede the Scout. In 1952 a subsidiary company was formed in Australia and this Company had a modern plant on the Moorabbin Industrial Estate near Melbourne, Victoria. In 1954, a license was finalized with the Shawnee Company, U.S.A., to manufacture and market \\"Shawnee\\" industrial loaders and diggers and those products formed a major part of the Company's range. In 1958, a license agreement was made with H.G. Poole Limited to manufacture and market Shawnee Poole Rear Dump Haulers, which enjoyed considerable success throughout the world and were leaders in the articulated dumper field. In 1959, Steel Fabricators (Cardiff) Ltd., was taken over by the Adamant & Western Group and became a member of the Adwest Group. Later that year Steelfab carried a market survey was carried out with a view to introducing a combination unit as opposed to the Shawnee Warrior type attachment digger. The Steelfab project started in 1960 and the Unit was designed to fall between the JCB 4 and Massey Ferguson backhoe loaders models. Several hundred 160/180 combinations units were built but the early models were built on the light weight Fordson Dexta skid unit which was not strong enough to carry the stresses produced by a backhoe loader and units started to fail. This proved futial in the success of the product and although the larger International Harvester B2275 skid was introduced as a replacement it was too late for its reputation. A larger 170/180 model was launched in the late 1960s with a much stronger and more powerful Ford 5000 skid but sales were limited and only around 60 units were sold and production ceased circa 1972. The Horndraulic '800' digger was first produced during the latter part of 1965 and received considerable acceptance on the market and a larger 900 was later produced. This machine mounted on the rear of tractors. The 800 diggers used the tractor hydraulics to power the digger although a pump system powered by the tractor PTO was offered as an option. The 900 digger incorporated a pump system run from the tractor PTO as part of its design. Steelfab also manufactured front end loaders for fitment to many different tractor marques and models under the brand name \\"Horndraulic\\" originally under license from the USA. For some time Steelfab manufactured front end loaders for Ford and Leyland tractor which were marketed under the Ford and Leyland brand names by their dealers. The designer of the 800 and 900 digger who had joined Steelfab from the HyMac company later went on to design a scissor design tipper trailer known as the Power X System and later left Steelfab and set up business building mini excavators known as Powerfab. The Steelfab SF 122 loader was used to build the \\"Roadless 700\\" Tractor loader in 1968. This machine based on the Roadless Plougemaster 65 and 75 tractors. Six were supplied to Israel between 1969 and 1972.Roadless by Stuart Gibbard, p120, The original prototype is believed to be the only one in existence. These were unusual machines as they had a Brockhouse torque converter transmission but were based on a Ford tractor. Competition At this time the market was very competitive with several firms offering alternatives to the JCB excavators. HyMac Limited later took over Whitlock Bros. of Great Yeldham in Essex Manufacturing The HyMac 370 backhoe loader range. See also * J. C.

Board of education Fong served on the Sacramento City Unified School District Board of Education for 6 years from 1998 until 2004. When he initially ran for the board, Fong was part of a slate of candidates put up by the late mayor Joe Serna who was attempting to have more control over the struggling, urban school district. He was the president of the board from 2000 until he resigned to take his council seat in 2004. Issues Facing the Board During his time on the board, several controversial issues were dealt with including but not limited to charter schools, teacher contracts, and the California Administrative Services Authority (CASA), a pension plan for top administrators that many considered legally questionable. With regards to charter schools, the primary issue was the closure of Sacramento High School, the city's oldest high school, and letting St. HOPE, an organization run by Kevin Johnson a former NBA star who is now Sacramento's mayor take it over. Due to his support of the conversion, Fong had a recall drive looming against him by the Take Back Our Schools Committee. In regards to the pension plan, CalPERS, the public employee retirement system in California found that the plan was invalid and that the district owed millions to the retirement system. Another audit found it legally questionable and that it possibly left the district owing ten million dollars in liability.

It was a member of the Delta family of rockets. Although several variants were put forward, only the Delta 5920 was launched. The designation used a four digit numerical code to store information on the configuration of the rocket. It was built from a combination of spare parts left over from earlier Delta rockets, which were being retired, and parts from the Delta II 6000-series, which was just entering service. The first stage was the RS-27 powered Extended Long Tank Thor, flown on several earlier Delta rockets. Nine Castor-4A solid rocket boosters were attached to increase thrust at lift-off, replacing the less powerful Castor-4 boosters used on the 3000 series. The Delta-K was used as a second stage. In the configuration that was launched, no third stage was flown. The Delta 5000 was launched just once, from Space Launch Complex 2W at the Vandenberg Air Force Base. Launch occurred at 14:34 on 18 November 1989. It was successful, and placed the Cosmic Background Explorer spacecraft into low Earth orbit.

He does not belong to any party.Audrius Butkeviƒçius profile at the Lithuanian parliament webpage In 1988 was one of the organizers of the Lithuanian reform Movement \\"SƒÖj≈´dis\\", a member of the SƒÖj≈´dis Seimas. He was an establisher and chairman of the Lithuanian Union of Political Prisoners and Deportees. In the period of 1990-1993 he was in the state of negotiations with the Russian Federation. One notable issue that was raised was the withdrawal of the Russian troops stationed in Lithuania, whereupon Lithuania and Russia signed an agreement that declared that all of the Russian troops stationed on the territory of Lithuania must withdraw by 31 August 1993. The agreement was concluded on schedule. In the late 1990s, Butkeviƒçius was under the suspicion of fraud. On 12 August 1997 he was apprehended by the Lithuanian secret service agents in a hotel lobby while accepting 15,000 US dollars. After a brief explanation, he was permitted to leave. On 14 August criminal proceedings were instituted against him. He was eventually arrested on 28 October, whereupon he was imprisoned and sentenced to five and a half years in jail. He was released on 20 March 2000. Subsequently, he appealed to the European Court of Human Rights. He stated that his detention was unlawful and that Articles 5 and 6 were breached. The court held the fact that these articles certainly were breached and that Lithuania was ordered to pay Butkeviƒçius compensation.Case of Butkeviƒçius v.

It may be confused with a hill of a similar name in the parish of Jurby, further north along the west coast of the island. At it is the second highest hill in this part of the island, after the South Barrule, 2 miles (3 km) to the east. It is in the parish of Rushen, although the boundary with the parish of Patrick is only about 200 metres to the north of its summit.  Name  Lag ny Keeilley (hollow of the church) on Cronk ny Arrey Laa; the Manx language has had a substantial influence on the island's toponomy and nomenclature. Its name means Hill of the Day Watch due to it having been used as a look out post for invaders during the time of the Viking invasions. The mountain is also known locally as Cronk ny Irree-Laa, meaning hill of the rising day or dawn. It was said that when the sun broke over this hill, it was a sign to the herring- fishers to shoot their nets.  Features  Its steep western slope rises directly out of the sea in a cliff. The area surrounding it has also been described by Trail Magazine as \\"some of the wildest terrain on any British coast path\\". and by Manx National Heritage as \\"amongst the most spectacular to be seen anywhere in the British Isles.\\"http://www.gov.im/mnh/heritage/countryside/earycushlin.xml However, the summit is only about 500 metres from the main road between Port Erin/Port St Mary and Peel, and may be climbed as part of an easy day walk between those places. The summit is on the long distance path, the Raad ny Foillan. The summit is one of the few places anywhere with views of what Manx people call \\"the six kingdoms\\" (Mann, England, Scotland, Ireland, Wales, and Heaven), with some adding a seventh \\"kingdom\\", Neptune (the sea). The boggy slopes are home to unusual plant species such as the carnivorous sundew.  Pilgrimage site  This is an ancient place of pilgrimage. Two particular sites on the slopes of Cronk ny Arrey Laa were visited: the \\"Chibbyr ny Vashtey\\" (well of baptism) and the Manx Keil (chapel) at Lag ny Keeilley on the steep western face.

November 28, 1929) was an American railroad executive of the late 19th and early 20th centuries who attempted to join the Frisco and Rock Island Railroads into a great system stretching from Chicago to Mexico. In 1909, when Yoakum controlled 17,500 miles of railroad, Railway World magazine called him an \\"empire builder\\" who had done as much for the Southwest as legendary James J. Hill had done for the Northwest. Biography Yoakum was born near Tehuacana, Texas, on August 20, 1859 to Narcissa Teague and Franklin L. Yoakum. In 1879 at age twenty, he worked on the surveying gang for the International-Great Northern Railroad to Palestine, Texas. He later became a land speculator for Jay Gould. He drilled artesian wells in the Rio Grande Valley. In 1887, the town of Yoakum, Texas, was named for him. From before 1888 to 1892, Yoakum worked for the San Antonio and Aransas Pass Railway as general manager and traffic manager. From 1893 to 1896, he was general manager and third vice president for the Gulf, Colorado and Santa Fe Railroad. In 1896, he became vice president and general manager of the Frisco Railroad. He became president in 1900, and chairman of the board in 1904. Other positions Yoakum held were president of the Chicago and Eastern Illinois Railroad, 1902-1904, afterwards chairman of the board; president, Evansville and Terre Haute Railroad, 1904, afterwards chairman; president, St. Louis, Brownsville and Mexico Railway after 1905; and chairman of the executive committee, Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad after 1905. According to the Handbook of Texas, > In 1905 the Frisco and Rock Island lines were joined, and Yoakum was the > chairman of the executive committee. This line was known as the Yoakum Line > and at the time was the largest railroad system under a single control. His > career was one of the most colorful of the many men in railroad history. Between 1911 and 1913, the Frisco suffered devastating financial losses from coal strikes, flooding of the tracks in Louisiana and Arkansas, and loss of business due to the Mexican Revolution. \\"Yoakum's Dream\\" ended when the Frisco entered bankruptcy in 1913 and was shorn of its Gulf Coast Lines as well as its affiliation with the Rock Island. In 1907, Yoakum moved to New York, where he became president of the Empire Bond and Mortgage Company. In his later years, Yoakum gave lectures and wrote popular magazine articles about the railroads, and advocated agricultural cooperatives to help farmers, in whose problems he was deeply interested. Yoakum died at his home in New York on November 28, 1929, at age 70. He was buried in Woodlawn Cemetery in New York City. In 1932, Yoakum's heirs sold his country home, \\"Tywacana\\", located in Old Bethpage on Long Island, to the State of New York, which developed the property into Bethpage State Park. The park's famous Black Course has hosted golf's U.S. Open twice. http://nyheritage.nnyln.org/digital/collection/p15281coll40/id/86/ Family Yoakum married Elizabeth Bennett of San Antonio, daughter of a prominent banker. They had two daughters, one of whom, Bessie F. Yoakum, married Francis Rham Larkin in 1913. A brother, Charles Henderson Yoakum (1849-1909), was a Texas state legislator and United States Congressman. Another brother, Finis E. Yoakum (1851-1920), was a faith healer and social reformer.

The cemetery has been in continuous operation since the burial of Captain John Underhill in 1672. The Underhill Burying Ground is governed by the Underhill Burying Ground, Inc., a non-profit organization, incorporated under the laws of the State of New York. Origins and history The Underhill Burying Ground is located upon a portion of approximately that was granted by Lenape Native Americans to English colonist Captain John Underhill in 1667. This area was originally called Matinecock, after the village of one of the Lenape bands. Today it is within the Village of Lattingtown. Captain John Underhill was buried here on his own land in 1672. Family descendants in 1843 created an organization to manage and protect the family burying ground for their continued use. The Underhill Society of America commissioned an imposing obelisk and monument, which was erected on the burial site of Captain John Underhill on May 18, 1907. The Society paid $6,000 for the monument. They arranged to reinter the \\"fighting captain\\" in its foundation. Made of white polished granite, the obelisk is topped by a bronze eagle with extended wings and perched on a bronze ball. On each side of the square base are four bronze tablets depicting the life of Underhill. Colonel John T. Underhill, then president of the Underhill Society of America, invited President Theodore Roosevelt to attend a formal ceremony to dedicate the monument. A letter from Roosevelt on April 3, 1908, accepted the invitation and agreed to \\"say a few words.\\" At the dedication ceremony on July 11, 1908, Roosevelt gave an address on \\"A Good Soldier and a Good Citizen\\". The President talked about the duties of citizenship as exemplified by the Underhill family. He denounced socialism and expressed his views on the proper regulation of private business fortunes. President Theodore Roosevelt at the dedication of the Captain John Underhill monument, July 11, 1908. The main bronze informational plaque on the monument has the following inscription: > Captain John Underhill > Statesman Soldier > Born Baginton, Warwickshire, England, Oct. 7, 1597 > Died Matinecock, Long Island, July 21, 1672 > > Coming to America in 1630, Underhill became prominent in the government of > the colonies and achieved a high reputation as a soldier in the war with the > Indians. To his memory this monument is erected by the Underhill Society of > America as a tribute of respect and esteem to the founder of the family in > America, May 18, 1907. Also included on the plaque were names of the Underhill Society of America members at the time of the monument dedication. These included Col. John Torboss Underhill, President; Walter Lispenard Suydam, First Vice President; Edward King, Second Vice President; Daniel Oscar Underhill, Third Vice President; David Harris Underhill, Cor. Sec. & Family Historian; Mrs. Marianna Underhill Cocks, Asst. Cor. Secretary; Silas Albertson Underhill, Recording Secretary; Edward DeLacey Underhill, Asst. Rec. Secretary; George William Cocks, Honorary Secretary; Irving Underhill, Treasurer; Reuben Howes Underhill, Counsel. Names of members of the Monument Committee were also included on the plaque. These included: Colonel John T. Underhill, Chairman; Hon. John Quincy Adams Underhill; Francis Jay Underhill; Charles Munson Underhill; Irving Underhill; Caleb Fowler Underhill; William Anderson Underhill. Patrons who supported the erection of the monument were also listed on the plaque and included Mrs. Robert Ogden Doremus and Mrs. Lydia Greene Lawrence. The Underhill Burying Ground, Inc. was incorporated under the laws of the State of New York in 1909. Myron C. Taylor, a descendant of Captain John Underhill, was instrumental in assuring perpetual maintenance of the Underhill Burying Ground by establishing a fund whose interest is used to maintain the cemetery. Descendants of Captain John Underhill may purchase burial rights by submitting an application to the Secretary of the Underhill Burying Ground, Inc. Records of burials The research document Historic Cemeteries of Oyster Bay lists 124 known interments at the Underhill Burying Ground.

Looney Tunes animated short film directed by Bob Clampett. The cartoon was released on August 5, 1939, and stars Porky Pig and Daffy Duck. A different design of Daffy was used in this cartoon. In this cartoon, Daffy has a light-colored mask around his eyes and a zig-zag ring around his neck. This design would be used one more time in Porky's Last Stand in 1940 and some advertisements during the time. Plot Mrs. Daffy surprises Daffy with the news that she has several eggs waiting to be hatched. Porky reads the announcement of the expecting duck duo in the newspaper. The eggs hatch as Porky comes to congratulate his old friend. Later, an eagle tries to make off with one of the babies. Daffy, still drunk off of corn juice from both worrying about the birth as well as celebrating the hatchlings, pursues the birdnapper. The eagle gathers reinforcements to take on the drunk duck. Porky comes to the rescue to find Daffy and the gang of eagles all getting drunk together, much to Mrs. Daffy's dismay. Notes When Mrs. Daffy tries to hide her secret from her husband, which revealed to be a baby-sized knitted shirt, the animation was reused from other Merrie Melodies cartoons, I Wish I Had Wings (1932) and Let It Be Me (1936). The scene when Mrs. Daffy tries to speed up the hatching process of her eggs and the hatchlings begged their mother not to, was reused in a later Looney Tunes cartoon, Booby Hatched (1944). The scene where the eagle is hunting for his prey and his allies were flying to his aid are reused from an earlier cartoon, Porky's Poultry Plant (1936).

These sirens were designed to broadcast high-intensity warning signals over a large area. SiraTone products are/were used for natural disaster notification, HAZMAT incident notification, fire call systems, and more. Most of the SiraTone line was discontinued in the mid-to-late 1990s and newer designs, like the Modulator and DSA (Directional Speaker Array), have replaced it. The SiraTone product line is not in standard production, as of 1995. An exception to the rule, the EOWS* 612 speaker array was sold on request until the mid-2000s. Products Six models of outdoor warning sirens were produced under the SiraTone brand. Model numbers were designated by the lettering EOWS (Electronic Outdoor Warning Siren) and an asterisk, followed by a number representative of the respective siren's decibel output or speaker array setup. All models utilized re-entrant speaker horns, arrays of 100 watt speaker drivers, and produced six standard signals. * EOWS* 115 ‚Äì The first SiraTone model produced; a 1200 Watt omnidirectional siren with 12 rectangular speaker horns * EOWS* 1212 ‚Äì 1200 Watt omnidirectional siren; an updated version of the EOWS* 115, with 12 circular speaker horns * EOWS* 408 ‚Äì 800 Watt rotating siren with 4 circular speaker horns. * EOWS* 612 ‚Äì 1200 Watt rotating siren with 6 circular speaker horns.

There was also a mobile vehicle-mounted version, at one time, called the EOWS* M12. An advertisement for the SiraTone EOWS* 408 and 812 sirens. Signals The sirens were able to produce these tones: * Alert - A steady siren tone * Attack - A wailing siren tone * Alternating Steady - An siren tone alternating between a high and low frequency, at half-second intervals, akin to a typical European emergency vehicle siren. * Alternating Wail - Attack tone, with high and low tones alternating at half-second intervals. * Pulsed Wail - Pulsating wailing tone, alternating at half-second intervals. * Pulsed Steady - Pulsating steady tone, at half-second intervals. * An auxiliary tone of choice *Whoop - Winding up and then winding up again and again with a pulse. A unique feature of the SiraTone siren series was the ability to conduct routine tests with a Westminster Chime melody instead of an actual alarm tone, intended to be a more pleasant alternative to the use of actual alarm tones. This allowed for operators to test sirens without fear of public panic and still ensure siren speakers were fully functional. Various other signals could be added upon special request.

Life Roger Gaskell Hetherington was born in Sherborne, Dorset on 10 February 1876, the eldest son of William Lonsdale Hetherington and his wife Mary Gaskell, daughter of John Dakin Gaskell, a barrister of Highgate, London. His father was assistant Master at Sherborne School when he was born, but the family soon after returned to Highgate. He entered Highgate School in 1889. After school he attended Trinity College, Cambridge, where he gained a half blue for rifle shooting. In spite of coming from a distinguished academic family Hetherington did not shine academically at this time, in fact he retained, to the end of this life, a copy of the Granta magazine (16 June 1897) that included the comment \\"I understand that Mr Hetherington of Trinity, is exceedingly annoyed at having missed the wooden spoon. It is one blot on an otherwise blameless career.\\" This comment resulted from his coming bottom but one in the Mathematical Tripos. The bound copy of Granta is now held by his grandson, Roger Hetherington Macdonald. Hetherington served as an officer in the 4th (Cambridge University) Volunteer Battalion of the Suffolk Regiment but resigned his commission as Captain on 24 November 1897. Hetherington returned to the British Army during the First World War when he was appointed temporary Inspector of Works in the Staff of the Royal Engineers with the honorary rank of Lieutenant on 14 April 1915. All his life he suffered from a weak heart and was never passed fit for active service. He relinquished that commission upon the completion of his service on 25 February 1919, retaining his rank. Hetherington married Honoria Ford on 24 April 1906. She was the youngest daughter of the solicitor Arthur Ranken Ford, who lived close (1 Broadlands Road) to Roger's parents in Highgate (3 Broadlands Road). They had a daughter and three sons, the second of whom was Sir Arthur Ford Hetherington (1911‚Äì2002) who was Chairman of British Gas plc. Honoria studied Classics at Girton College, Cambridge but as Cambridge did not then grant women full degree status she in fact received a degree from Trinity College, Dublin. Both Roger and Honoria were strong believers in women's education and as well as making sure that Mary had a university education Roger always travelled to Cambridge to vote for women having full degree rights at Cambridge. Hetherington had become a governor at Highgate School in 1917. He served the school as treasurer and chairman of governors from 1929 to 1944. He had an interest in education and was also chairman of the council of Wycombe Abbey School. Hetherington's career as a civil servant began in 1930 when he became the Chief Engineering Inspector at the Ministry of Health, a post he would hold until 1944. He became an official adviser on water and the Director of Surveys for the ministry in 1941 in which capacity he served until 1952. Hetherington had been appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire in 1918, a Companion of the Order of the Bath in 1932 and was made Knight Bachelor in 1945. On 24 June 1947, at a special general meeting of the Institution of Civil Engineers, he was elected their president for the November 1947 to November 1948 session.. Hetherington was only elected because the death of the president-elect Sir Frederick Cook following his election in May. This was the second successive year that the ICE's president-elect had died before entering office. Hetherington died in 1952. His eldest son Roger Le Geyt Hetherington (1908‚Äì1990) was president of the ICE for 1972-3.

It was designed by the original Los Gatos Amiga team including Jay Miner. Overview After the release of the Amiga 1000, Jay Miner began to design its intended successor, between 1986 and 1987. Code-named Amiga Ranger, it was planned to be highly expandable like Amiga 2000 with better graphics and CPU. The Ranger is said to have possibly included a 68010 or 68020 CPU. Information for this new chipset remains unclear. However, the sound system may have still been the same as the original chipset. According to R. J. Mical, the new chipset kept the original 13-bit DAC for its CLUT but with quadrupled color registers from 32 to 128. The color palette would have remained at 4096 colors but the resolution could go up to 1024√ó1024 pixels with 128 colors (7-bit color depth). Additionally the chipset can address up to of Chip RAM space. Ranger used 2 MB VRAM as chip memory. In an interview, Jay Miner described benefits of using VRAM instead of DRAM; this gave the display system enough memory bandwidth for 1024√ó1024 pixel displays. From the known specification, it could be said that Ranger chipset was designed to compete with the Sharp X68000 and Apple Macintosh II personal computers (both released in 1987) which take advantage of VRAM technology. Jay Miner made sure that the Ranger chipset was completed and fully tested before he left Commodore in hope that one day the company would release it. But at that time, VRAM was considered expensive compared to DRAM, so Commodore refused to release Ranger for its high price which was unsuitable for the low-end systems like Amiga 500 to cover its costs. Dale Luck is in possession of a Ranger system prototype, but it's unknown what state it is in. In a few years, VRAM costs dropped to be only 20% more than DRAM, so Commodore planned to use VRAM in the AAA chipset, the next- gen Amiga chipset left in an unfinished state when the company went into voluntary liquidation in 1994. Some thoughts of a built-in blitter per playfield designed in Ranger had been rejected by Dave Haynie. However, a post on Team Amiga explained the Ranger idea: References * Amiga history guide article about Ranger * R.J.Mical gives some information about Ranger in an interview * Jay Miner interview about next generation Amiga * Article about Amiga Ranger (french) * Photo of Dale Luck's ranger prototype See also * Original Amiga chipset * Enhanced Chip Set * Advanced Graphics Architecture * AAA chipset * Hombre chipset * Sharp X68000 * List of home computers by video hardware Category:Amiga chipsets Category:Graphics chips ","title":"Amiga Ranger Chipset"},{"id":"21552909","text":"Weavertown is an unincorporated community in Amity Township, Berks County, Pennsylvania, United States.

The game was originally named Privateer, before being published by the Mendocino Game Company in 1995. The name of the game is apparently a combination of privateer and pirate. Gameplay The objective of the game is for a player to either: return the centrally located treasure to their home port, or to capture all of their opponents' three ships, using movement restricted by dice rolls (two six-sided dice), obstacles, trade winds, and currents. The theme of the game is for each player to assume the role of a different band of three ships, with their own port and flag. Mendocino Game Company and lawsuit The aptly named Mendocino Game Company, based in Mendocino County, California, began publishing Pirateer in 1995. In 2002, the Mendocino Game Company ceased producing Pirateer. The designer of the game, Scott Peterson, unsuccessfully sued board members for misappropriating trade secrets, breaching their fiduciary duty and conspiring to seize control of the company. The board members counter-sued and, in 2009, a Mendocino County jury ordered Scott Peterson to pay $791,000 to investors and members of the company‚Äôs board of directors in restitution and punitive damages for defamation. Critical reception Forrest Johnson reviewed the original 1978 version of Privateer in The Space Gamer magazine, no. 39. He commented on the game by saying, \\"Simple, but not dull, Privateer takes almost no thought at all. A good game to bring out after the bottle has gone around a couple of times.\\" In 1996, Pirateer was one of just five board games to win the Mensa Select Award.

Journals The Law Barn was the center of legal studies at the University of Missouri from 1893 to 1923. The law school has a unique method for selecting associates to its three law journals. Unlike other schools that base placement entirely on grades, the University of Missouri School of Law uses a write-on system. After final exams in the spring semester are completed, packets are made available to all interested students. In the packet are two assignments: the first is a case and exclusive list of citations to other sources; and the second is a mock list of footnotes. Applicants to the law journals must write a case note based on the case in the packet, using as citations only those sources specifically listed. Applicants must also edit the mock list of footnotes for errors, pursuant to the Bluebook method of citation. Applicants must then return the entire packet, as well as a list identifying their preferred law journals. The Editors-in-Chief and other editors blind-grade the submissions. Law school administrative assistants rank each student three times: first, by weighting the applicants' GPAs at 80% and their written submissions 20%; then, by weighting the GPAs at 20% and the written submissions at 80%; lastly, by ranking solely based on the scores of the written submissions. The Editors-in- Chief then select which applicants they want. The Missouri Law Review selects first based on the 80/20 rankings, then the Journal of Dispute Resolution, then the Business, Entrepreneurship & Tax Law Review (formerly the Journal of Environmental and Sustainability Law). Then, they pick again in order, this time based on the 20/80 rankings, and finally they select based on the 0/100 rankings.Membership on the Missouri Law Reviews  Missouri Law Review  The Missouri Law Review is the law school's oldest law journal. It is entirely student-run and student-edited and publishes four times a year. Since 1936, when publication began, it has been cited over sixteen hundred times in published court opinions, including over twenty occasions by the Supreme Court of the United States.About the Missouri Law Review Each spring the law review hosts a symposium on a different part of the law. Noted scholars and practitioners in the given area give a presentation, and then they write an article which the law review publishes later that year.  Business, Entrepreneurship & Tax Law Review  The Business, Entrepreneurship & Tax Law Review (\\"BETR\\") is a student-edited and led publication that creates a three- part publication and hosts an annual symposium providing cutting-edge information and legal analysis over a wide range of issues.  Journal of Dispute Resolution  The Journal of Dispute Resolution, operated by the Center for the Study of Dispute Resolution, is entirely student-led and student-edited. Published semi-annually, the Journal is considered the leading publication in alternative dispute resolution. The Journal, like the Missouri Law Review, hosts annual symposia in the area of dispute resolution.  Journal of Environmental and Sustainability Law  The Journal of Environmental and Sustainability Law, or JESL, formerly known as the Missouri Environmental Law & Policy Review, was a joint venture between the School of Law and the Missouri Bar Association. Founded in 1993, JESL consisted of 11 student editors and no more than 20 student associates. JESL published case notes and articles on topics including energy policy, land use, water policy, agricultural law, land reclamation, and environmental sustainability. From its inception in 1993 to the 2010-2011 school year, it published three editions each year. Beginning in the 2011-2012 school year, two issues per year are published, one each in the fall and spring. The journal's last issue was published in spring 2016.  Employment  According to Mizzou Law's official 2016 ABA-required disclosures, 82% of the Class of 2016 obtained full-time, long-term, JD-required employment nine months after graduation. Mizzou Law's Law School Transparency under-employment score is 17.7%, indicating the percentage of the Class of 2016 unemployed, pursuing an additional degree, or working in a non-professional, short-term, or part-time job nine months after graduation. Costs For the 2019-2020 school year, in-state tuition is $22,218.95, and out-of-state tuition is $41,079.35.http://law.missouri.edu/financialaid/cost/ The total cost of attendance (indicating the cost of tuition, fees, and living expenses) at Mizzou Law for the 2014-2015 academic year is $55,106 for non-Missouri residents and $34,476.30 for Missouri residents.

Foundational to the studio woodturning movement, Mel Lindquist applied his master machinist techniques and background in engineering, pioneering hollowing techniques called \\"blind boring\\", or \\"blind turning\\", widely used today. Mel Lindquist discovered spalted wood on his land in the upstate New York Adirondacks in the 1950s and together with his son Mark Lindquist, popularized its use as a material for woodturning and woodworking. Mel Lindquist is widely credited as being the first to seriously explore the use of spalted wood for wood turning, and his son Mark wrote groundbreaking essays in journals of the 1970s. The effect was widespread according to Fine Woodworking: \\"...Melvin and Mark Lindquist unleashed spalted wood upon the world....\\" In addition to his numerous technical innovations, Mel Lindquist is also widely credited for developing an aesthetic foundation for the studio woodturning movement based on translating ancient ceramic ideals into the medium of wood, incorporating bark inclusions and imperfections as decorative elements within the turning integral to design. In 1981, Mel and his son Mark initiated the wood turning program at the Arrowmont School of Arts and Crafts,TN, and in October 1985, Mel won the first award honoring the pillars of the studio woodturning movement at the national conference: Woodturning: Vision and Concept at Arrowmont School, TN. Lindquist signed his work with a simple script \\"L\\" including the date and type of wood from the early 1950s until 1980. After 1980 he signed his work with an incised script signature \\"Mel Lindquist\\" on the bottoms of his pieces. Mel Lindquist's work can be found in numerous public and private collections in the US and abroad, including the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York City, the M.H. de Young Memorial Museum, San Francisco, the Smithsonian American Art Museum, Washington D.C., the Houston Museum of Fine Arts, TX, and the White House Collection of American Crafts.

Over 12,000 cases resulted in lawsuit mostly nuisance settlements totaling over $400 million during a five-year period ending in 2014. In 2019, taxpayers funded $68,688,423 as the cost of misconduct lawsuits, a 76% increase over the previous year, including about 10 million paid out to two exonerated individuals who had been falsely convicted and imprisoned. Criminal justice advocates report that public access to information about NYPD misconduct is increasingly constrained, particularly due to the department's controversial 2016 reinterpretation of section 50-a of the New York Civil Rights Law. Molly Griffard, of the Legal Aid Society's Cop Accountability Project, has stated that \\"There‚Äôs an epidemic of misconduct and the very taxpayers who pay these settlements don't have access to what‚Äôs in these officers' misconduct records and how they‚Äôre being disciplined.\\" According to data compiled by the project, some individuals are permitted to remain in uniform following settlements of scores of lawsuits against these officers, which frequently total hundreds of thousands of dollars. In June 2020, the Eric Garner Anti-Chokehold Act was passed, which repealed 50-a and made the use of certain restraints by police anywhere in the state of New York punishable by up to 15 years in prison. __TOC__  Single-victim misconduct allegations   Arrest of Frank Lino  In 1962, the Bonanno crime family mobster Frank Lino was arrested for his alleged involvement in the shootings of two Brooklyn police detectives. The detectives, aged 28 and 56, were shot dead during a holdup of a tobacco store in Gravesend, Brooklyn, where Lino and two others netted $5,000. Lino was charged with the murders after supplying a getaway vehicle for one of the \\"stick-up men\\" so that he could then flee to Chicago. Lino was one of the five men charged after being taken to the 66th Precinct for an interrogation. During Lino's interrogation, he claimed that police officers drove staples into his hands and a broomstick up his rectum. He alleged that the abuse resulted in a broken leg and arm. Lino was later released with three years probation after he threatened to sue the city for police brutality. He also claimed that the uncontrollable blinking of his eyes was a direct result of the alleged beating. Shooting of Clifford Glover On April 28, 1973, Officer Thomas Shea shot 10-year-old Clifford Glover while in South Jamaica, Queens, thinking Glover had a gun. On June 12, 1974, Shea was acquitted of wrongdoing by 11 white and one black jurors but was fired from the NYPD that year and afterwards was divorced and had moved out of state. Beating death of Israel Rodriguez On June 14, 1975, Officer Thomas Ryan arrested Israel Rodriguez on attempted murder charges, when Rodriquez fired 3 shots through his door at PO Ryan. Rodriquez mistook Ryan for Santiago. Santiago and 3 others had held Rodriquez and beat him on the roof of his building forcing Rodriquez to hand over his stash of narcotics. Upon responding to the scene, in response to being called about the beating on the roof PO Ryan and PO Brown arrested Santiago and 3 who were armed and in possession of narcotics. PO Ryan asked Santiago where they had come from and Santiago had directed Ryan to Rodriquez's apartment. Ryan then took Santiago to Rodrquiez's door and ordered him to knock on the door. When Rodriquez saw Santiago he fired through the door, thinking that Santiago had returned to do him additional harm. PO Ryan entered Rodriquez's apartment subdued him and placed him under arrest. It was alleged that Ryan caused Rodriquez injuries while in custody at the 44th Precinct. In 1977, Ryan was convicted of criminally negligent homicide but in 1979 when he was about to be sentenced, escaped and lived at large until turning himself over to Queens' district attorney in 1981. Shooting of Randolph Evans On November 25, 1976, Officer Robert Torsney shot Randolph Evans to death while responding to a call at Evans's home, a Brooklyn housing project. Torsney was found not guilty by insanity defense (automatism of Penfield epilepsy) in 1977 and was committed to Queens Creedmoor Psychiatric Hospital until July 1979 when state reviewers declared him no longer a threat to himself or society and released him, although he was still denied a disability pension. Chokehold of Michael Stewart On September 15, 1983, Michael Jerome Stewart was arrested for spray painting graffiti on a wall of Manhattan's First Avenue station. He was violent with the officers, ran to the street and became unconscious and died on September 28, 1983. In October 1983, the case went before a grand jury in Manhattan, but was dismissed 7 months later because one of the jurors started private investigations on the case. In February 1984, a second grand jury indicted three officers with criminally negligent homicide, assault and perjury, while three other officers were charged with perjury and jury selection started in June 1985. On November 24, 1985, all six of the indicted officers were acquitted by a jury. In 1987, the eleven involved officers and the MTA were sued for $40 million. In August 1990, Stewart's parents and siblings settled out of court for $1.7 million. Shooting of Eleanor Bumpurs On October 29, 1984, after threatening to throw boiling lye on Housing Authority personnel attempting to evict her, police forced entrance to Eleanor Bumpurs's public housing apartment, where she lived alone. Her adult daughters wanted her to be hospitalized because she was schizophrenic with hallucinations. Although NYPD procedure required a City psychiatrist to be called in a case of involuntary hospitalization, none was summoned to the scene. Bumpurs was being evicted supposedly for nonpayment of rent. Although NYPD procedure required a City marshal to be present and restricted the role of police to protecting the marshal and the marshal's assistants, no marshal was summoned to the scene. It later turned out that she had paid her rent as usual but had not been informed of a recent rent increase. When police broke down the door, the elderly woman was standing at the far end of a hallway with a kitchen knife in her raised hand. The police attempted to restrain her by pinning her against a wall with an extended Y-shaped pole, but she swept away the pole and charged the officers. When the lead officer tripped and fell to the floor she stood over him and attempted to stab him with the knife. Officer Stephen Sullivan fired two shots from his 12-gauge shotgun, sending one pellet into Bumpurs' hand and nine other pellets into her chest, killing her. Sullivan was tried and acquitted in 1987. In 1990, the city ended the legal proceedings by agreeing to pay $200,000 to the Bumpurs family estate. Stun gun coercion of Mark Davidson On April 17, 1985, Mark Davidson was arrested by undercover detectives on charges of drug dealing and taken to NYPD's 106th precinct in Ozone Park, Queens, where he was beaten and tortured with a stun gun and threatened with torture on his genitals into making a false confession. On May 3, 1986, Sgt. Richard Pike, Jeffrey Gilbert and Loren MacLary were each convicted of assault and were sentenced to four to six years. Shooting of Edmund Perry On June 12, 1985, Perry and his brother, Jonah, were walking in Morningside Park where they encountered Lee Van Houten, an undercover plainclothes detective on car burglary patrol. Perry tried to rob Van Houten by grabbing his neck. Van Houten fell to the ground and fired three shots, at least one in Perry's stomach, killing him immediately. Two witnesses supported Van Houten's version of the incident, resulting in no charges being filed. Jonah Perry was found not guilty of mugging the officer in 1986. The NYPD settled a wrongful death suit related to Edmund Perry in 1989, paying money damages to the Perry family. Shooting of Jose Garcia On July 3, 1992, Jose Garcia died from gunshots fired by undercover officer Michael O'Keefe after Garcia was chased into a building in Washington Heights. Police asserted that Garcia, a known street drug dealer, had been carrying a concealed weapon. But witnesses to the struggle and residents of Washington Heights said they believed the shooting death of Garcia was unwarranted, triggering demonstrations on the block where Garcia was killed. \\"Fires were set,\\" according to a report of the demonstrations published by the New York Times, adding that \\"a car was overturned and debris rained down from buildings, leaving the block of the shooting, West 162d Street off St. Nicholas Avenue, littered with garbage, shattered bottles, vegetables, crates, slats of wood and even car parts.\\" At the time of the demonstrations, police were unable to say \\"whether Mr. Garcia had pulled the gun on Officer O'Keefe or in some other way menaced the officer.\\" In the end six days of demonstrations took place, during which protesters \\"tossed trash cans, bottles and rocks, broke windows, looted and overturned and burned police cars,\\" leading to \\"139 arrests, one death and 90 injuries, including those suffered by 74 police officers,\\" according to a subsequent report by the New York Times. Fires were set in 14 buildings, and 121 vehicles were damaged. Two months after Mr. Garcia was shot and killed, a Manhattan grand jury voted not to file criminal charges against Officer O'Keefe after forensic evidence proved that both witnesses who claimed O'Keefe executed Garcia could not have seen the shooting from the position they asserted they were standing. In addition, the recording of Officer O'Keefe's radio transmissions for assistance corroberating his description of his life- and-death struggle with Garcia was released to the public. In an unusual move, Manhattan District Attorney Robert Morgenthau published the grand jury report to ease public tension, but declined to criminally charge the two witnesses who touched off the riots with falsely reporting an incident and grand jury perjury by their false claims . Officer O'Keefe was assigned to the NYPD's 34th Precinct, a station house that became the target, just one month before Garcia's shooting death, of a federal investigation over allegations of police corruption. Reported corruption at the 34th Precinct inspired Mayor David Dinkins to appoint the Mollen Commission to investigate police corruption. Choking of Anthony Baez On December 22, 1994, 29-year-old Anthony Baez was choked to death by police officer Francis X. Livoti in the University Heights section of the Bronx. In 1998, Livoti was convicted of violating Baez' civil rights, and two other officers were convicted of lying on the witness stand at Livoti's trial. His widow later settled with the city for $3 million.  Sodomy of Abner Louima  On August 9, 1997, NYPD Officer Justin Volpe in Brooklyn sodomized Abner Louima with a broken broom handle in a 70th Precinct bathroom. Officer Volpe eventually pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 30 years in federal prison. Other officers were also implicated and convicted on charges stemming from the initial cover-up. Louima subsequently settled with the city for $8.75 million. Shooting of Amadou Diallo On February 4, 1999, four plainclothes NYPD officers assigned to the street crime unit in the Bronx fired 41 gunshots at Amadou Diallo, killing him instantly. Diallo, whom the officers mistook for a since-convicted rapist, was later found to be unarmed. The officers were subsequently acquitted in 2000, but the City of New York and the NYPD later paid out $3,000,000 to Diallo's parents in a civil suit. Following the controversy three years later, the street crime unit was disbanded. Shooting of Patrick Dorismond On March 16, 2000, Dorismond was approached by undercover officer Anthony Vasquez, who asked Dorismond how he and his partners could buy marijuana. Dorismond was outraged by the question, responded by punching Officer Vasquez and a fight ensued. During this fight Vasquez's backup officer moved in and mistook an action by Dorismond as reaching for a weapon and warned Vasquez, who drew his own firearm and shot the unarmed Dorismond to death. Much of the resulting controversy was about releasing Dorismond's sealed juvenile record to the media, claiming a person's right to privacy no longer existed once such persons die. Vasquez was never indicted by a grand jury for Dorismond's death, but his family later settled with the city for $2.25 million. Racial mailings of Thomas Pappas Thomas Pappas was a New York City police officer who mailed racist materials from his home. When he was fired, he sued to regain his position but the federal courts declined to reinstate him. Shooting of Ousmane Zongo On May 22, 2003, 43-year-old Ousmane Zongo, an immigrant from Burkina Faso, was shot four times by Police Officer Bryan Conroy in a Chelsea warehouse. In 2005, Conroy was found guilty of criminally negligent homicide and sentenced to 5 years probation. In 2006, the city awarded the Zongo family $3 million to settle a wrongful death suit. Shooting of Timothy Stansbury On January 24, 2004, Housing Bureau officer Richard Neri, Jr., accidentally fatally shot Timothy Stansbury, a 19-year-old black man who was trespassing on the roof landing of a Bedford- Stuyvesant housing project. Stansbury was unarmed, but had apparently startled Neri by opening the roof door and suddenly encountering the officer. At that point, Neri discharged his service firearm and mortally wounded Stansbury. Although Commissioner Kelly stated that the shooting appeared \\"unjustified\\", a Brooklyn jury found that no criminal act had occurred and that the event was a tragic accident. Neri was thus cleared of all charges. The city later agreed to pay $2 million to settle a lawsuit filed by the Stansbury family. A grand jury declined to indict Neri, but Kelly later suspended him for 30 days without pay and permanently stripped him of his weapon. Shooting of Sean Bell On November 25, 2006, plainclothes police officers shot and killed Sean Bell and wounded two of his companions, one critically, outside of the Kalua Cabaret in Queens. No weapon was recovered. According to the police, Bell had rammed his vehicle into an undercover officer and hit an unmarked NYPD minivan twice, prompting undercover officers to fire 50 rounds into Bell's car. A bullet piercing the nearby AirTrain JFK facility startled two Port Authority patrolmen stationed there. An undercover officer claims he heard one of the unarmed man's companions threaten to get his gun to settle a fight with another individual. On April 25, 2008, Justice Arthur Cooperman cleared Detectives Michael Oliver and Gescard Isnora of murder charges, and Detective Marc Cooper of reckless endangerment, in the death of Sean Bell. The city eventually settled with Bell's family for $3.25 million.  Kidnapping of drug dealer  On June 7, 2011, ex-NYPD transit officer Jorge Arbaje-Diaz was sentenced to 20 years in federal prison after being convicted of kidnapping, robbing and torturing drug dealers while on the force in 2008. Arbaje-Diaz was found guilty of stealing more than of cocaine and $4 million in cash.  Subway sodomy scandal  On October 15, 2008, five officers attempted to arrest Michael Mineo for smoking marijuana in a Brooklyn subway station. Days later, Mineo made accusations claiming he was sodomized with a police radio antenna by the officers. On December 9, 2008, the Brooklyn District Attorney announced that three of the officers, Richard Kern, Alex Cruz, and Andrew Morales, were indicted on criminal charges. According to the District Attorney, officer Kern sodomized Mineo with his expandable baton after the officers handcuffed him. Officer Kern was charged with aggravated sexual abuse and assault, and faced up to 25 years in prison, and officers Cruz and Morales were charged with hindering prosecution and official misconduct, and faced up to 4 years in prison. All three officers were acquitted of all charges.  Retaliation against ex-officer Adrian Schoolcraft  In May 2010, Adrian Schoolcraft, a former NYPD officer, publicized recordings he made in secret while on duty, showing a pattern of corruption and retaliation against him for refusing to cooperate. Officers detained citizens without charges to meet quota and failed to report serious crimes, including rape, to make their department appear to be reducing crime rates. When the NYPD learned that Schoolcraft was privately investigating such corruption, concern for his mental health was used as an excuse for armed officers to kidnap and imprison him in a hospital. In 2010 he was suspended without pay and was filing suit against the NYPD.The NYPD Tapes: Inside Bed- Stuy's 81st Precinct - Page 1 - News - New York. Village Voice (May 4, 2010). Retrieved on August 16, 2013.Right to Remain Silent. This American Life. Retrieved on August 16, 2013.schoolcraftjustice.com . In further retaliation, lawyers for the city of New York on behalf of the NYPD served a subpoena on Graham Rayman, the journalist who reported about Schoolcraft's secret recordings, attempting to abridge the journalist's First Amendment rights by accessing Rayman's records. The city's subpoena to Rayman was seen as a way for the NYPD to gain access to Schoolcraft's tapes. The requests in the subpoena \\"were made without particularity and essentially seek widespread access to all of Rayman's files.\\" However, a federal judge ruled that the city of New York could only access limited materials. In September 2015, the portion of the lawsuit against the NYPD settled, with Schoolcraft to receive $600,000 in compensation. The portion against Jamaica Hospital was settled in November 2015. Asthma death incident In August 2010, 11-year-old Briana Ojeda died from an asthma attack after NYPD officer Alfonso Mendez denied her mother's pleas to perform cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Ojeda's mother allegedly was driving her daughter to the hospital when she took a wrong one- way turn in a neighborhood street and stopped to ask Officer Alfonso Mendez for help. Ojeda's mother claimed Mendez smirked at her and said, \\"I don't know CPR,\\" and tried to ticket her. A bystander performed CPR and by the time an ambulance arrived, Mendez had left. After a one-week manhunt, Mendez was identified and has been suspended without pay indefinitely. \\"Indeed it is tragic that Ms. Torres felt a sense of relief when she initially encountered Officer Mendez because she believed a uniformed officer of the law could help her,\\" Judge Jiminez-Salta wrote. \\"However there is no policy in the New York Police Department which requires officers to know and to be willing and able to perform CPR.\\" The incident led to the passing of Briana's Law in New York. Arrest of Michael Premo Occupy Wall Street activist Michael Premo was arrested on December 17, 2011 and charged with assaulting an officer. Prosecutors argued and the arresting officer gave sworn testimony that Premo \\"charged the police like a linebacker, taking out a lieutenant and resisting arrest so forcefully that he fractured an officer's bone.\\" The defense located video that was taken by freelancer Jon Gerberg which contradicted the sworn testimony, instead showing officers \\"tackling [Premo] as he attempted to get back on his feet\\". Prosecutors claimed no video of Premo's arrest existed, yet the Gerberg video clearly showed an NYPD officer also filming Premo's arrest.Occupy activist Michael Premo cleared in NYPD case by video proof.

Once inside, Graham struggled with one of the police officers near the entrance to a bathroom. Graham was shot once in the chest by the police officer, and Graham was eventually transported to Montefiore Medical Center, where he was pronounced dead. According to a police spokesperson, there was \\"no evidence\\" that Graham was armed. Initial statements did not explain what prompted the chase. Police would not - at first - identify the officer who fired the fatal shot, but police said that a small amount of marijuana was found in the toilet. The shooting officer was later identified as Richard Haste, and first- and second-degree manslaughter charges were filed against him, to which Haste pleaded not guilty at his arraignment four months after the shooting. After the arraignment hearing, the Bronx District Attorney said that the shooting was unjustified, since Graham had no weapon. In the time between the shooting and the arraignment, the Graham family demanded justice. \\"The shooting of Mr. Graham has become a flash point in the roiling debate over police aggression; his family has taken part in several vigils and rallies to press for criminal charges in the case, as well as highlight what some critics say is a bias shown by the police against young men of color,\\" The New York Times reported. After a judge threw out the manslaughter charges against Haste due to a technicality in the proceedings of the first grand jury, a second grand jury voted not to file charges against Haste, leading the Graham family to demand a federal investigation into the unjustified police shooting. A lawsuit filed against the city was settled for $3.9 million in 2015. Death of Kyam Livingston On July 21, 2013, 37-year-old Kyam Livingston died in NYPD custody after being arrested by officers of Brooklyn's 70th Precinct on charges of violating an order of protection. Upon arrest, Livingston was brought to Kings County Hospital for alcohol and drug testing but was released in a few hours. She was then processed at the precinct and brought to Brooklyn Central Booking to await arraignment. After approximately 13 hours in custody, Livingston experienced stomach pain and diarrhea and began to repeatedly request medical assistance over the course of seven more hours. According to witnesses, NYPD officers on duty refused to issue Livingston any medical attention, stating that she was an \\"alcoholic\\" and threatening to \\"lose the paperwork\\" of Livingston and other women in the cell who were pleading for someone to come to her aid. It was further reported that Livingston was dead for at least 20 minutes before emergency medical staff arrived. Beginning in August 2013, there were repeated demonstrations in Brooklyn demanding the names of the officers on duty at the time of Livingston's death, the release of video surveillance tapes from the cell Livingston was detained in, and the full investigation and improvement of conditions at Brooklyn Central Booking jail. Livingston's family filed a Notice of Claim against the NYPD and other government entities as a prerequisite to an $11 million lawsuit, and called for the criminal prosecution of any police officer who denied medical attention to Livingston while she was in their custody. The NYPD Internal Affairs Division's investigation of the matter is ongoing. Beating of Alexian Lien Aftermath showing broken window of Lien's Range Rover On September 29, 2013, motorcyclists participated in a rally called \\"Hollywood's Block Party\\" on New York City's Henry Hudson Parkway. One of the bikers pulled in front of Alexian Lien and slowed dramatically, an action sometimes referred to as \\"brake checking\\". Lien stopped his vehicle and was quickly surrounded by bikers. Lien accelerated to escape and struck one of the bikers, critically injuring him. A chase ensued, ending in Lien being pulled from his vehicle and beaten. The attack was caught on video and garnered international attention. A number of bikers are facing assault and other criminal charges, and legislation has been proposed to regulate motorcycle rallies in New York City. The NYPD faced criticism when some of the bikers involved in the chase and attack were identified as off-duty New York City police officers. Ten-year veteran and undercover detective Wojciech Braszczok surrendered to authorities and was arrested on October 8. An undercover narcotics detective has been identified by the press as being present but not participating in the assault. Sources have reported a total of five off-duty officers were originally present on the West Side Highway, and that at least two saw the assault. Chokehold of Eric Garner On July 17, 2014, at 4:45 p.m., Eric Garner was approached by NYPD plainclothes police officer Justin Damico, in front of a beauty supply store at 202 Bay Street in the Tompkinsville neighborhood in Staten Island. After telling Damico and other NYPD officers, \\"I was just minding my own business. Every time you see me you want to mess with me. I'm tired of it. It stops today!\\",NYPD Strips Badge, Gun From Cop Involved In Fatal Chokehold , Gothamist, July 20, 2014. Garner raised both arms but was then put into a chokehold from behind by officer Daniel Pantaleo, in order to be subdued. While Garner repeatedly stated that he was not able to breathe, Pantaleo and other officers struggled to bring him down onto the sidewalk and have him put his arms behind his back. He died a few minutes later.Pearson, Jake. Official: Police chokehold caused NYC man's death, Associated Press, August 1, 2014.Sanchez, Ray. Choke hold by cop killed NY man, medical examiner says, CNN, August 2, 2014. The police waited seven minutes before giving Garner cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Use of the chokehold has been prohibited by New York City Police Department policy since 1993. The NYPD later arrested Ramsey Orta, who is now in Rikers prison, and is the civilian who recorded the video of the encounter. The final autopsy report in Garner's death showed that he neither had drugs nor alcohol in his system, nor did he sustain head trauma.Schram, Jamie. Chokehold victim Eric Garner had no drugs, alcohol in system, New York Post, August 7, 2014. The autopsy suggested that his obesity and other health problems, combined with his combative arrest, may have caused his fatal heart attack. As a result of Garner's death, Police Commissioner William Bratton ordered an extensive review of the NYPD's training procedures, specifically focusing on the appropriate amount of force that can be used while detaining a suspect. Arrest of Ramsey Orta On October 5, 2016, Ramsey Orta, who filmed Eric Garner's murder, was targeted by NYPD and arrested for weapons and drug charges. Orta filed one lawsuit, alleging that the NYPD has arrested him several times in retaliation for filming the Garner video. But in July 2016, Orta, saying he was ‚Äútired of fighting,‚Äù pled guilty to charges of selling heroin and other drugs to an undercover police officer, and to a charge of possessing an illegal handgun. Shooting of Akai Gurley On November 20, 2014, NYPD Officer Peter Liang fired his pistol. The bullet hit the wall and ricocheted hitting an unarmed 28-year-old Akai Gurley at a Brooklyn housing project. Commissioner Bratton stated that Liang had already drawn his weapon before encountering Gurley, but initially deemed the shooting an accidental discharge after an investigation. In 2015, Liang was suspended without pay and charged with manslaughter, negligent homicide, assault, reckless endangerment and official misconduct. On February 11, 2016, Liang was convicted of manslaughter and official misconduct; he was fired by the NYPD the same day. Controversy surrounding Francisco Garcia On May 3, 2020, a video went viral of an NYPD officer repeatedly punching and tasering a man he was arresting for violating the city's temporary social distancing requirement.https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2020/05/03/us/ap-us- virus-outbreak-violent-arrest.html Despite the fact that the person he was arresting, Donni Wright, was also shown to be resisting arrest and assaulting him,https://eurweb.com/2020/05/05/graphic-video-of-nypd-beating-black-man- highlights-racial-disparities-during-covid-10-crisis/ it was later revealed that the officer involved, Francisco Garcia, had a previous history of alleged brutality, resulting in seven lawsuits which were settled by the city for a total of $210,000.https://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nyc-crime/ny- punch-20200504-pxs6vb5czzbozlggiansyu5mzm-story.html One notable incident included a controversial confrontation with a lesbian couple at a Harlem restaurant in 2016, where he allegedly shoved one of the two women and afterwards said \\"Take a picture of it, fg dyke.‚Äù Another incident occurred in 2014, when he other NYPD officers controversially arrested a home health care aide for trespassing. However, it soon revealed that the health care aide, whose thick African accent made it hard for Garcia and the assisting officers to understand what he was saying, merely went into the wrong apartment and charges were dropped when it was proven that his patient lived in the same building. Following the May 2020 incident, Garcia was stripped of his gun, shield and badge and reassigned to desk duty.https://metro.co.uk/2020/05/04/nyc-cop-stripped-gun-badge-brutally- beating-bystander-social-distancing-12653427/ Protest controversies Handschu court case A 1970s trial of 21 members of the Black Panther Party revealed that NYPD infiltrated and kept dossiers on not only the Black Panthers and other radical groups, but also on anti-war groups, gay rights activists, educational reform advocates, religious groups, and civic organizations. A large coalition of activist groups accused police of compiling information to punish and repress lawful dissent. Barbara Handschu was a lead plaintiff in the 1971 class action suit Handschu v. Special Services Division, 605 F.Supp. 1384, affirmed 787 F.2d 828. In the 1985 ruling, the court sided with Handschu, finding that police surveillance of political activity violated constitutional protections of free speech. The ruling brought about the agreement. In spite of restrictions set by the Handschu agreement against police surveillance of peaceful citizen activities, like political organizing, law enforcement officials in New York have been able to weaken or violate the restrictions in order to carry out surveillance of the 2004 Republic National Convention protesters, the Muslim community, Occupy Wall Street activists, and Black Lives Matter activists in New York. 1988 Tompkins Square Park Riot In August 1988, a riot erupted in Alphabet City's Tompkins Square Park in the East Village of Manhattan when police attempted to enforce a newly passed curfew for the park. Bystanders, artists, residents, homeless people and political activists clashed with police on the night of August 6 and the early morning of the following day.Purdham, Todd, \\"Melee in Tompkins Sq. Park: Violence and Its Provocation,\\", The New York Times, Section 1; Part 1, Page 1, Column 4; Metropolitan Desk, August 14, 1988. In a report released by Commissioner Benjamin Ward, the police department's actions were \\"not well planned, staffed, supervised or executed... which culminated in a riot.\\" Matthew Shepard memorial march When the LGBTQ community in New York City organized a solemn, memorial march one week after Matthew Shepard died of injuries sustained during an attack in what was called a hate crime, the NYPD responded in riot gear and on horseback, arresting 96 mourners and using some violent tactics, triggering at least one federal, constitutional rights violations lawsuit. 2002 World Economic Forum When activists peacefully demonstrated against the World Economic Forum in 2002, the NYPD responded by erecting barricade-like pens for protesters, wearing riot gear and gas masks, and making what were described as either selective arrests by \\"extracting particular people\\" or wholesale arrests based on charges of unlawful assembly and disorderly conduct. Anti-war protests Activists in New York City participated in a global day of protests against the impending U.S. invasion of Iraq. In court the NYPD opposed efforts by activists to organize a march, convincing a judge that activists should only hold a stationary demonstration. The day of the demonstration, police used horse-mounted officers, who charged at protesters, injuring some activists; used barricades to restrict protesters' access to the demonstration site and to trap activists during the demonstration; conducted widespread searches without a warrant; and detained some activists for many hours in vans without access to bathrooms or food. 2004 Republican National Convention During the 2004 Republican National Convention, many peaceful protesters were arrested at Madison Square Garden, where the convention was held. Over the course of several days, mass arrests by the NYPD netted over 400 people. The use of flexible, plastic orange netting to \\"divide and conquer protestors,\\" including pedestrians, according to The New York Times. Indeed, Mayor Michael Bloomberg told The New York Times that if the NYPD engaged in the false arrests of innocent activists, then there was a way to deal with the false arrests after the fact. \\"You can't arrest 1,800 people without having somebody in the middle who shouldn't have been arrested,\\" Mayor Bloomberg said of the number of arrests made during the 2004 Republican National Convention, adding, \\"That's what the courts are there to find out afterwards.\\" Among other actions causing controversy toward the NYPD, a thousand people were detained under conditions, including overcrowding, dirtiness, and contamination of oil and asbestos, described as unfit for detention. People also reported having suffered from smell, bad ventilation, and chemical burns and rashes The New York Times has also reported on two occasions that the police videotaped, infiltrated, and acted as agents provocateurs during the protests, and that officers traveled as far away as Europe beforehand to surveil on people there who planned to protest at the RNC. The NYPD procured and has deployed Long Range Acoustic Device (LRAD), also known as a sound cannon, as a non-lethal, crowd-controlling military weapon that can cause injury and is intended to disrupt protests. Two LRAD units were purchased in 2004 at the cost of $35,000 each under the pretense that the devices would only be used to make announcements. An LRAD was at protests of the 2004 Republican National Convention in New York City but not used. Occupy Wall Street protests During the Occupy Wall Street protests in 2011, 700 were arrested, leading to controversy over the NYPD's policing tactics.https://www.theguardian.com/ world/blog/2011/nov/15/occupy-wall- street-zuccotti-eviction-live Police killing protests = 2014 protests = In 2014, large-scale protests took place in New York City following the deaths of Eric Garner in Staten Island, Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, and Akai Gurley in Brooklyn. The protests got bigger after grand juries in Ferguson and in Staten Island separately decided not to file criminal charges against the police officers, who were involved in the chokehold death of Garner and the shooting death of Brown, respectively. In response to these protests, the NYPD made large numbers of arrests and deployed the uses of pepper spray and mobile LRADs to disrupt activists, long regarded by many as controversial. Use of LRADs by the NYPD triggered legal objections on the basis that there may have never been \\"formal guidelines for the devices' use\\". Political pressure to address fatal interactions with the NYPD escalated after the Daily News reported statistics that showed that, in the time between the 1999 slaying of Amadou Diallo and the 2014 shooting death of Akai Gurley, on- duty NYPD officers were involved in 179 fatalities. = 2020 protests = The George Floyd protests in New York City, a series of wide-scale protests, occurred after the May 2020 police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis. There were numerous instances of police-involved excessive force, and as of June 9, 2020, prosecutors were considering charges against up to 40 officers related to their actions during the protests. On May 29, an NYPD officer violently shoved a 20-year-old woman to the ground at a protest near Barclays Center in Brooklyn, resulting in concussion and seizures. A video of the incidents depicts the officer calling the woman a \\"bitch\\" after she asked about his order to get out of the street. The officer was later suspended without pay, and later became the first officer to be charged for actions taken during the protests. A video of a crowd of protesters clashing with the NYPD attracted attention on May 30, showing police vehicles accelerating into a crowd of people. In response to the video, de Blasio initially defended the officers' actions, but later reneged on these comments. The Guardian wrote that the video, viewed more than 30 million times as of June 4, \\"quickly shredded years of effort to repair the deeply tarnished image of the NYPD.\\" On May 30, a video of an incident at a Brooklyn protest circulated on social media depicting a black protester, wearing a mask, with his hands up approached by a police officer who pulls the protester's mask off in order to pepper spray his face. After an investigation, the officer involved was suspended without pay and referred to an internal disciplinary process. In September 2020, Human Rights Watch published a 99-page report documenting a coordinated attempt by NYPD officers to \\"kettle\\", assault and mass arrest peaceful protestors in the Mott Haven neighborhood of the South Bronx on June 4, 2020. Multiple-victim misconduct allegations and additional controversies Corruption in 77th Precinct In December 1986, 11 NYPD officers were arrested from the 77th Precinct station house in the first major instance of corruption after the Knapp Commission. The investigation came to be known as the \\"Buddy Boys\\" case. The officers, \\"who knocked down doors, stole money and drugs from drug dealers and resold the stolen drugs,\\" also \\"ran extortion operations within the precinct,\\" according to a corruption timeline prepared by The New York Times. Eventually, 13 officers were indicted, and all of the nearly 200 officers at the 77th Precinct station house had to be transferred to other Brooklyn precincts, except for 1 union delegate. A special state prosecutor, Charles Hynes, found later to be corrupt himself, had to present evidence to a special grand jury in the corruption investigation. Central Park jogger case Five black and one Latino boys, 14 to 16 years old, were coerced by NYPD officers into falsely confessing to a woman's Central Park assault and rape. The six males were vindicated in 2002, five of whom equally shared a $40 million 2014 lawsuit settlement. 75th Precinct cocaine ring scandal In May 1992, five current and one retired NYPD officers were arrested and charged with trafficking drugs from Brooklyn into Long Island. Two of the officers were partners at the 75th Precinct, whilst the other officers were from the 73rd Precinct. Prosecutors alleged that one of the officers arrested, Michael Dowd, knew when he was under surveillance and may have benefited from tips from department investigators. How Dowd may have managed, for some time, to evade investigation became a subject of inquiry by the Mollen Commission. Officer Kenny Eurell, who also was one of the officers arrested at the same time as Dowd, tape-recorded Dowd plotting an elaborate plan to skip bail. His bail was revoked and later Dowd was convicted of racketeering and conspiracy to distribute narcotics and served 12 years in prison. In 2014, a documentary was released, The Seven Five, detailing Michael Dowd's career with the NYPD. Corruption in 34th Precinct Federal investigators launched a probe over reports that some police officers were engaged in drug dealing. At the same time, Mayor David Dinkins announced that he would \\"name a special investigator to look into the charges of corruption, as well as possible lapses in the Police Department's internal investigation methods. Aides to the Mayor said the investigator would be Milton Mollen, the former Deputy Mayor for Public Safety,\\" according to a report published by The New York Times, adding that the investigation by the U.S. Attorney's Office was focusing on the 34th Precinct, further noting that \\"The investigation is an unusual Federal intrusion into the workings of the city's Police Department and it raises the specter of a departmental problem larger than that acknowledged by Police Department officials.\\" Amongst aspects or allegations triggering investigatory scrutiny was the fact that the 34th Precinct had the highest rate of homicides and that some 34th Precinct police officers were \\"overlooking drug dealing in exchange for money and drugs and acting as guardians for the dealers by protecting the buildings and stores where they live and work. Other officers are suspected of buying and selling cocaine or crack.\\" Top NYPD officials stated that the Brooklyn cocaine ring and the 34th Precinct corruption allegations were isolated incidents, in spite of complaints of other wrongdoings. Some complaints noted that officers with NYPD's Internal Affairs mishandled investigations. In 1994, the 34th Precinct had the highest number of corruption complaints, according to statistics reported by The New York Daily News. The three-year federal investigation of the 34th Precinct ended with only one conviction of perjury. Police riot In 1992, an estimated 10,000 off-duty NYPD officers showed up to a rally outside City Hall organized by the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association. The off-duty police officers were called to action by the police union over disapproval with actions taken by the then mayor, David Dinkins. Police were protesting, amongst other complaints, that Dinkins had appointed the Mollen Commission to investigate NYPD corruption. To show their disapproval with the Dinkins administration, the officers began the rally with rhetoric that was described as \\"vicious,\\" with officers engaging in jarring behavior, including \\"jumping barricades, tramping on automobiles, mobbing the steps of City Hall\\" and \\"blocking traffic on the Brooklyn Bridge for nearly an hour in the most unruly and angry police demonstration in recent memory,\\" according to an account of the rally published by The New York Times. There were instances when some of the 300 uniformed police officers, who were supposed to police the rally, actually encouraged raucous behavior by the protesters. Dinkins blamed PBA leadership, as well as then presumed mayoral candidate Rudolph Giuliani, for inciting the police into rowdy actions, calling the actions by police as \\"bordering on hooliganism.\\" The Editorial Board of The New York Times called the police rally a \\"riot,\\" finding both praise and fault in a preliminary report by NYPD of the police misconduct. The report found that police officers used racial slurs to describe Dinkins, who is black, and that there had been drinking in connection with the rally. Generally, the report was well received by the Editorial Board for its frankness, but, in the editors' nuanced view of the report, the report still fell short, because the report was \\"thick with language critical of the unruly behavior but apparently thin on charges against individual rioters,\\" again pointing out that the NYPD was unable to keep the conduct of its own officers in check. Then Acting NYPD Commissioner Raymond Kelly himself \\"raised serious questions about the Department's willingness and ability to police itself,\\" according to The New York Times. Corruption in 109th Precinct After the NYPD received complaints that police officers assigned to the 109th Precinct were using drugs, four officers were confronted. Three officers took drugs tests, failed, and were dismissed. One officer resigned. The investigation of the precinct extended to at least 20 police officers, including a sergeant. Some officers were given desk jobs or transferred to other precincts. Three officers from the precinct were indicted for theft. In its report about the investigations at the 109th Precinct, The New York Times noted that although the allegations were not as severe as those at the 30th Precinct, the investigation was notable, \\"because it demonstrates that major corruption exists in precincts outside the high-crime areas where the temptations for drug-related corruption are usually highest.\\" In the face of allegations that a police union, the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, was undertaking \\"aggressive efforts to thwart major corruption inquiries,\\" according to The New York Times, John Miller, then the Deputy Police Commissioner for Public Information, said he found the actions \\"disturbing.\\" Efforts to root out bad cops were made difficult by the P.B.A., as that police union is known, according to officials and prosecutors, who worried \\"that they will have trouble rooting out substantial numbers of corrupt officers as long as the P.B.A. resists them,\\" as reported by The New York Times. Indeed, the P.B.A. was shown to be a powerful organization with great influence. \\"Fortified with millions of dollars in annual dues collections, the P.B.A. is one of the most powerful unions in the city. As an active lobbyist in Albany and as a contributor to political campaigns, the P.B.A. has enormous influence over the department and is typically brought in for consultations before important management decisions are made.\\" Corruption in 73rd Precinct In January 1994, five NYPD officers assigned to the 73rd Precinct station house were removed from duty over allegations of extorting cash, guns, and drugs from drug dealers. The investigation referred to the group of implicated police officers by the moniker, the \\"Morgue Boys,\\" because the officers would sometimes retreat near an abandoned coffin factory, where the officers would divide the proceeds of their criminality. Federal and state investigators worked in partnership to collect evidence for a federal grand jury, which included information that the implicated police officers would hold up drug dealers at gunpoint, usually while on-duty, netting up to $2,000 per night in criminal proceeds. The investigation into corruption at the 73rd Precinct was made possible by information gathered at hearings held by the Mollen Commission. Eventually, 15 police officers were suspected of having participated in the \\"Morgue Boys\\" ring, resulting in at least six arrests, three of which pleaded guilty, with the remaining three receiving either acquittals or mistrials by trial jurors with respect to criminal and civil rights charges, respectively. Corruption in 30th Precinct Thirty-three officers were arrested in a wide-ranging investigation of corruption at the 30th Precinct station house in Harlem. Some of the police officers would illegally search known drug dealers apartments, seizing drugs and cash. The police officers would then sell the seized drugs straight out of the 30th Precinct station house itself at half-market price in order to profit from their spoils. The arrests, which implicated nearly one out of six officers assigned to the 30th Precinct station house, were the fruits of a probe began by an investigator, who worked for the Mollen Commission. Corruption in 48th Precinct Sixteen police officers from the 48th Precinct station house in The Bronx were indicted and arrested on corruption charges including larceny, filing false police reports, and insurance fraud. Seven further officers faced disciplinary action, but not arrests, because there was insufficient evidence to lead to indictments. In total, nearly 10 percent of the police officers assigned to the 48th Precinct house were implicated in a corruption investigation that was inspired by pressure created by the Mollen Commission. Reports also showed that a police union, the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, undertook aggressive efforts to thwart investigations into corruption at the 48th Precinct. Flushing brothel evidence-planting Dennis Kim and Jerry Svoronos, two police officers working out of the 109th Precinct, and Gina Kim and Geeho Chae, brothel operators, were arrested on March 8, 2006, for bribery charges relating to the protection of a brothel located in Flushing, Queens. Agents seized approximately $800,000 in cash, believed to be the proceeds of the brothel, from Kim and Chae's vehicle and residence. On March 8, 2006, search warrants were executed at the brothel and a boarding house used by the brothel workers, where agents seized immigration documents, business records, and a small quantity of Ecstasy. The two officers were in a unit which targets quality-of-life-type crimes. Members of the precincts engaged in a practice known as \\"flaking\\", in which cops planted marijuana, cocaine, or Ecstasy on suspects. Members of the conditions unit maintained a small stash of drug in an Altoids tin for this purpose, Assistant U.S. Attorney Monica Ryan said. In addition, 16 Chinese and Korean brothel workers were taken into immigration custody. Mafia cops Louis Eppolito and Stephen Caracappa were simultaneously on the payrolls of the NYPD and the Lucchese crime family and were abusing their authority as officers of the NYPD. They would routinely violate the civil rights of the citizens of New York City, and moonlighted for the crime family. They would use NYPD files to track down the enemies of the crime family and were ultimately convicted of the murders of Eddie Lino, Michael Greenwald (an informant for the FBI) and innocent man Nick Guido, who had the same name as a man targeted by the crime family. Eppolito received life in prison with an additional 100 years and Caracappa received life in prison with an additional 80 years. They were also fined a combined $4 million. They received a monthly salary of $5000 from the crime family. NYPD \\"rape cops\\" scandals In December 2008, two on-duty NYPD officers were charged with raping a woman whom they had been dispatched to help on a 911 call. Officers Kenneth Moreno, age 43, and Franklin Mata, age 29, were called to help a drunken woman out of a taxi and into her apartment in 2008. The woman testified that she awoke in her bedroom to being raped by Moreno; Mata was said to have acted as a lookout during the incident. Although both men were acquitted of the rape at trial in May 2011, the jury's verdict proved highly controversial and drew large protests. Moreno and Mata were, however, found guilty of official misconduct for going back into the woman's apartment three times without alerting their superiors and making erroneous calls to 911 with claims of a nonexistent homeless man loitering in the area to facilitate their return to the premises. As a result of the convictions, both officers were immediately terminated from the NYPD. In September 2011, an off-duty NYPD officer, Michael Pena, was charged with raping a schoolteacher at gunpoint. According to the woman, she was stopped by Pena, who was allegedly intoxicated, who ordered her into an apartment backyard as he pointed a gun into her face. At Pena's trial, the woman tesitifed that Pena had threatened to kill her if she screamed or looked at him as he began to rape her. An apartment resident heard the woman's pleas for him to stop and called 911. The NYPD was able to confirm that Pena was drunk and armed, but he denied raping her. He was charged with 10 felonies, including predatory assault, sexual assault, and first-degree rape, and pleaded not guilty. On March 27, 2012, Pena was found guilty on the predatory assault and sexual assault charges, but the jury deadlocked on the rape charges. Three months after the trial, Pena pleaded guilty to rape and was sentenced to 75-to-life.Michael Pena, ex-NYPD cop, admits raping woman months after jury failed to convict him - Page 1. Daily News (New York). Retrieved on August 16, 2013. Gun smuggling scandal In October 2011, five current NYPD police officers and three retired police officers were arrested and charged with trafficking guns into New York state in exchange for thousands of dollars in cash. Six of those implicated worked, or once worked, at the 68th Precinct. Ticket fixing scandal In October 2011, 16 NYPD police officers were charged with offenses related to ticket fixing. Though only 16 NYPD officers were facing trial, news reports show that hundreds of NYPD police officers were involved, \\"caught on a phone tap asking for scores of tickets to disappear.\\" \\"Paid Detail Unit\\" An October 2011 article by Pam Martens in the CounterPunch newsletter, alleged police corruption in reference to the NYPD's \\"Paid Detail Unit\\" that allows corporations to hire NYPD police officers for security duties. The Paid Detail Unit was established by Mayor Giuliani in 1998 as a way to increase revenue to New York City that allowed off-duty police officers to moonlight in uniform and as of 2003 nearly half of NYPD's street cops (11,000) were on the Paid Detail Unit. The then commanding officer of the Unit justified the program by claiming cops are off the business payroll the moment they see a crime committed and are expected to respond just as they would if they were on-duty. Muslim surveillance After the September 11 attack, the NYPD and the Central Intelligence Agency, engaged to track certain Muslims in the New York metropolitan area, including Yale University and the University of Pennsylvania. According to Associated Press, \\"[a] months-long investigation... has revealed that the NYPD operates far outside its borders and targets ethnic communities in ways that would run afoul of civil liberties rules if practiced by the federal government. And it does so with unprecedented help from the CIA in a partnership that has blurred the bright line between foreign and domestic spying.\\" When the Associated Press published reports on this activity, the NYPD faced much controversy and criticism. Muslims were spied on in mosques, restaurants, streets, public places and Muslim groups, and websites were scrutinized. It resulted in much confusion and anger from Muslim communities in the United States, as well as support from New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg. The FBI criticized the spying as unhealthy. The Associated Press won the 2012 Pulitzer Prize for the investigation. Later, in June 2012, Muslims in New Jersey sued the NYPD over the spying. However, the lawsuit was dismissed in February 2014 by a federal judge who said that the surveillance of the Muslim community was a lawful effort to prevent terrorism, not a civil- rights violation. The surveillance program was disbanded on April 15, 2014 after a meeting that was held with several Muslim advocates on April 8, 2014. It was also revealed that the surveillance program failed to generate even a single lead. Falsification of evidence to secure convictions Retired detective Louis Scarcella and his colleague Stephen W. Chmil rigged evidence to promote their own careers which led to the imprisonment of dozens of innocents. District Attorney Charles J. Hynes reopened the cases of 56 people arrested by Detective Scarcella; at least five cases of Detective Chmil's (out of 300 deemed probably wrongful) scrutinized by nonprofit Exoneration Initiative made clear that he \\"invented confessions, coached witnesses and persuaded others to change their descriptions of perpetrators to match the suspect in custody ‚Äî even in cases he worked without Detective Scarcella\\". Examples of crimes that Scarcella cajoled other people into confessing to include: * David Ranta (for brutal 1990 slaying of a prominent rabbi) was exonerated of the murder charge on March 23, 2013 and won a $6.4 million settlement from the City of New York in 2014. * Nelson I. Cruz (1998 killing of a man in East New York, Brooklyn) was arrested at age 16 for murder. He insists he was not at the crime scene. * Crack-cocaine addict Jeffrey Campbell (charge: robbery of a shoe store in 1985) was pressured by the detectives to testify against their suspect, else they would set him up on a phony charge. * Valance Cole (charge: drug-related homicide of Michael Jennings 1985) was convicted. \\"In 1994, Mr. Campbell, dying of AIDS, suddenly recanted. He said prosecutors had promised to drop charges if he falsely blamed Mr. Cole for the murder. Detective Chmil, he said in a sworn statement, gave him a script.\\" Campbell's recantation was judged incredible and Cole stayed in prison. Years later, another judge acknowledged that Mr. Cole was \\"probably innocent\\" but refused to overturn his conviction. * Teresa Gomez, a crack-cocaine addict who has since died, claimed to have seen several unrelated murders. * Three half- brothers, Alvena Jennette, Robert Hill and Darryl Austin, had their murder convictions cleared by the Brooklyn DA in cases linked to Scarcella and Gomez in May 2014.Robles, Frances, and Stephanie Clifford, \\"3 Are Exonerated of Murder in Cases Tied to a Discredited Detective\\", The New York Times, May 5, 2014. Retrieved May 7, 2014. The Legal Aid Society, which represents 20 of the people whose cases were reopened by the Brooklyn district attorney's office, is concerned that the prosecutors' review is too narrow, because it is limited to cases in which Detective Scarcella testified in court. Hynes's office said it had added about five cases to the review since it was announced in May, but Hynes lost his re-election bid in November. The new district attorney, Kenneth P. Thompson, suggested during the race that he would be open to widening the scope of the review. Thompson is reviewing over 90 cases . However, in January 2015, Thompson announced that his office would endorse 21 disputed convictions, which include 18 by Scarcella. Corruption in the 67th Precinct A pattern of arrests of individuals who were charged with gun possession, made by officers in Brooklyn's 67th Precinct station house, was reported to be allegedly tampered, according to a 2014 newspaper report. The suspects stated that the police had placed the guns on their person, and the report said that \\"each gun was found in a plastic bag or a handkerchief, with no traces of the suspect's fingerprints.\\" Defense attorneys have said in court filings that the arresting officers may have been inventing informers as a way to satisfy arrest quotas and to collect $1,000 rewards from an anti-gun community safety program. The questions raised about the arrests suggested a \\"pattern of questionable police conduct and tactics,\\" according to the report. After an inquiry by the newspaper, prosecutors admitted that they were going to review the cases of some of the arrests, leading to gun possession charges being dropped against at least two men. The case against a third man was eventually dismissed at the request of prosecutors, but only after the man's trial preparation had commenced. A fourth man was acquitted at the conclusion of a federal trial after police testimony was found to be \\"inconsistent.\\" A trial against a fifth man arrested on gun possession charges was dismissed after police could not produce their informant before the judge. Reportedly, an investigation is being conducted by the NYPD's Internal Affairs Bureau. \\"Turned backs\\" at Liu's and Ramos' hospital arrivals and funerals On December 20, 2014, many NYPD officers turned their backs on Mayor Bill de Blasio when patrol officers Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu arrived at Brooklyn's Woodhull Hospital where they were pronounced dead on arrival hours later, in protest at words de Blasio reportedly spoken to his son that characterized them in a negative light, as well as at the officers' funerals themselves, Ramos' on December 27 and Liu's on January 4, 2015. Enforcement of laws had been dramatically lowered in the last few weeks. The events at the funerals were politicized, with many conservative commentators siding with the NYPD and many liberals siding with protesters against the NYPD. Some blamed the local police union, the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, which said that it was not behind the decline in arrests. NYPD edits to English wikipedia articles On March 13, 2015, many news organizations reported that 50 of the 15,000 IP addresses belonging to the NYPD were associated with edits to articles on the English wikipedia that dated back to 2006. These IP addresses geolocate to NYPD headquarters at 1 Police Plaza. According to one news source, English wikipedia discourages editors from making revisions that might constitute a conflict of interest. An internal review found two officers had used police-owned equipment to make edits to English wikipedia. Of the English wikipedia edits, Commissioner Bill Bratton said, \\"I don't anticipate any punishment to be quite frank with you.\\" Bratton said the NYPD does not have \\"a policy specific to accessing that site,\\" but will review its social media policy. Arrest quota \\"game\\" In 2015, officers went public with accusations that the command of the Anti-Crime Unit in the 122nd Precinct station house in Staten Island awarded points to unit officers for every misdemeanor and felony arrest the officers made. If unit officers failed to earn a minimum number of points per month, then the unit officers faced the possibility of being transferred out of the unit. Officers who made the allegations said that the point system amounted to a game to reinforce a quota system of arrests, a charge that an NYPD spokesperson denied. The allegations were revealed against a backdrop of a lawsuit filed by nearly a dozen minority NYPD officers, who claimed that the NYPD retaliated against them for refusing to meet a quota for issuing summonses in minority communities. Rant against Uber driver On March 30, 2015, an Uber driver was \\"pulled over\\" by Detective Patrick Cherry a 15-year veteran of the NYPD who was assigned to the FBI's Joint Terrorism Task Force in New York City. His xenophobic and profanity-filled tirade and threats of arrest for making a \\"mild\\" gesture at the detective for not properly signaling has highlighted what other drivers- for-hire have called a pattern of abuse and discrimination by the New York City police. The encounter came to light, because of a video that a passenger in the car posted to YouTube. Detective Cherry conducted this unjustified detainment (although a brief one) in a Hyundai Sonata not officially issued to him, according to NYPD. Furthermore, it had a simple LED blue and red flasher on the dash, a color combination not used by police in the state of New York, raising additional questions if this was a personally-owned car and not one which he had the right to use in traffic stops. In the ensuing news stories it came to light that Detective Cherry has been the subject to two federal civil rights lawsuits, both which the City of New York settled. This detective also has been party to at least 12 citizen complaint review board enquiries. According to NYPD Commissioner William Bratton, Cherry has been stripped of his badge, gun, and the right to arrest while the Internal Affairs and CCRB investigations take place. Lawsuits against NYPD officers The New York Daily News revealed that 55 officers had each been sued for misconduct 10 or more times since 2006, resulting in settlements and judgements that totaled over $6 million of the $1 billion paid during the period to cover all civil suit judgements/settlements against the NYPD. Only one to two percent of people who believe they were mistreated by the police actually file lawsuits. Narcotics detective Peter Valentin was sued 28 times for misconduct from 2006 through early 2014, resulting in $884,000 in settlements. The lawsuit allegations included the running of slash-and-burn raids that resulted in few criminal convictions. Corruption in the 40th Precinct In 2015, disciplinary charges were announced against 19 officers at the 40th Precinct station house in the Bronx, after these officers failed to process crime complaints properly. During an audit of a four-month period in 2014, fifty- five instances of alleged discrepancies were discovered between radio call response activities and complaint reports that led to a deliberate misreporting of crimes. After the discrepancies were corrected, it was discovered that crimes actually increased in the precinct from what had been previously reported for 2014. Investigation into cheating on 2015 lieutenants' exam The NYPD launched an investigation into allegations of widespread cheating by the class of sergeants, who took the lieutenants' exam in 2015. About 200 sergeants passed the test during the original date of its administration, and at a make-up test date for those who missed the original test date. After the initial test date, the answer key to the exam was reportedly posted on an online message board popular with police officers. Nevertheless, allegations were made of cheating on both the initial test and at the make-up test. Pending the outcome of the NYPD investigation, the promotion of the roughly 200 sergeants who passed the test were put on hold. The allegations of cheating had triggered a lawsuit by police officers, who claimed that the cheating provided some officers with an unfair advantage. Federal corruption investigation of top NYPD officers NYPD Commissioner William Bratton reassigned four top NYPD officers as a consequence of a federal corruption investigation of the NYPD being led by the U.S. Attorney's Office and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Deputy Chief Michael Harringon, Deputy Inspector James Grant, Deputy Chief David Colon, and Deputy Chief Eric Rodriguez were each disciplined by being given desk jobs even before the outcome of the investigation was made clear. The investigation of the NYPD was reportedly connected to probes of two businessmen with ties to Mayor Bill de Blasio. Although the complete nature, and identity of all of the targets, of the federal investigation were not made clear, agents of the FBI's political corruption unit were participating in the probe. As part of the wide-ranging, Federal investigation into alleged misconduct and corruption at the NYPD, federal prosecutors filed criminal charges against Brooklyn public safety patrol volunteer Shaya (Alex) Lichtenstein for attempting to bribe an undercover officer with almost $1 million if the undercover officer would expedite permits for around 150 guns. One prosecutor described Lichtenstein as an \\"arms dealer.\\" Three NYPD officers, who worked in the Licensing Division, the departmental unit that processed gun permits, were transferred to other posts. The federal corruption investigation has also reportedly focused on former Chief of Department Philip Banks, who allegedly received gifts from one of the two businessmen with close ties to Mayor de Blasio. Under anxious conditions, with senior police officers expecting indictments to be handed down as a consequence of the investigation, NYPD Inspector Michael Ameri reportedly killed himself by shooting himself in the head while he sat in his department-issued car. Ameri had reportedly been interviewed twice by investigators about preferential treatment being given to the two businessmen with ties to Mayor de Blasio, and the unit in which Ameri worked had been raided by officers from the NYPD's Internal Affairs Bureau. Another NYPD officer, who was a close friend of and who worked with Ameri in the Highway Patrol Unit, was reassigned following Ameri's death. Some of the senior NYPD officers, who have been disciplined in connection with the reported investigation, include officers who had received promotions from NYPD Commissioner William Bratton. Allegedly, Commissioner Bratton has been allowing senior NYPD officers implicated in the reported investigation to retire with their pension benefits without facing departmental charges for alleged misconduct. Mayor Bill de Blasio said the process for the top brass retirements was appropriate. During a radio interview, Sergeants Benevolent Association President Ed Mullins called for Commissioner Bratton to resign, saying new leadership at the police department was needed, and adding, \\"I personally think Bratton has stayed too long, and it's time to go.\\" In June 2016, three NYPD commanders were charged by prosecutors with federal corruption charges as part of the reported, wide-ranging investigation. One day after Millions March NYC, a group with ties to the Black Lives Matter movement, commenced a protest in City Hall Park, demanding, among other things, the resignation of Commissioner Bratton, the embattled police commissioner announced he was stepping down from his post. Shooting of Star the dog Star is a mixed-breed female pit bull that was shot by the New York City Police Department in 2012 while she was protecting her homeless owner, who was in the midst of a seizure. Star's shooting was captured on video, and went viral, leading to controversies over police handling of companion dogs. Arrest of Jazmine Headley On December 7, 2018, NYPD officers violently separated a one-year-old boy from his mother, Jazmine Headley, who was at the New York City Human Resources Administration awaiting an appointment for a daycare voucher.https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/11/nyregion/jazmine-headley- baby-video-nypd.html A witness reportedly described Headley as \\"not acting erratically or in any way a risk to her child\\". Brooklyn city councilman Stephen Levin expressed concern at the officers' apparent violation of their de-escalation training. Food Vendor crackdown On November 9, 2019, four police officers confiscated the cart of a churro vendor at the Broadway Junction station in a crackdown on homelessness and \\"quality of life\\" issues. A second churro vendor was arrested on Monday November 11 at the Myrtle-Wycoff station. Julie Salazar, the New York State Senator whose district includes the Broadway Junction stop, criticized the officers' actions as \\"criminalizing\\" a person who was trying to make a living.  2019 Internal Affairs \\"integrity test\\"  Officers Joseph Stokes and Jose Aracena were arrested following an October 29, 2019 Internal Affairs ‚Äúintegrity test‚Äù on the Lower East Side, after the patrol partners pulled over an undercover officer who feigned drunkenness. Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. reported the duo as charged with stealing cash from the vehicle, which was caught on camera. Stokes filed a lawsuit, claiming the sting operation was retaliation for his April 29, 2018 arrest of a restaurateur for drunk driving who had claimed close ties to NYPD Commissioner James O‚ÄôNeill and Chief Jeffrey Maddrey. Stokes claims that the restaurateur had then threatened him, and later claimed that money was stolen from his vehicle.  Exclusion of NYPD as court witnesses  In February 2020, media reported that Brooklyn, Manhattan and Staten Island District Attorney Offices each compile lists, or information, into a \\"Do Not Call\\" roster of \\"NYPD officers who they will not allow to testify in court.\\"  Marijuana planting  On two different occasions in 2018, officer Kyle Erickson, of the 120th Precinct, was caught on his own bodycam planting marijuana in cars during a traffic stop after finding nothing in a search. Both times, after planting the marijuana, Erickson asked fellow officer Elmer Pastran if they are \\"good\\", suggesting that Pastran was fully complicit. The man arrested in the first incident, Lasou Kuyateh, began proceedings in late 2019 to sue the city of New York for $1 million. His marijuana charge had been dropped abruptly at a pretrial hearing because of the video, and prosecutors encouraged Erickson to get a lawyer. A passenger in the second incident, Jason Serrano, was ordered out of the car and ultimately pushed to the ground and handcuffed despite showing officers that he was recovering from an abdominal stab wound, and was taken back to the hospital following the incident. A review by the police department's internal affairs division determined that allegations of misconduct in both incidents were \\"unfounded\\", and both officers remain on patrol.  Parking placard corruption  NYPD officers have been repeatedly and consistently documented to engage in illegal parking, and in refusing to give tickets to illegally parked cars which are owned by police or friends of police; either abusing official placards, or using fake placards or pieces of police uniforms. The Twitter account \\"placardabuse\\" documented this from 2016 through at least 2020. When confronted on this, NYPD harassed reporters. Attempts at reform Shootings by police From 1971 to 2016, shooting and killing of alleged perpetrators dropped from 314 shot and 93 killed to 23 shot and 8 killed. This represents a reduction of more than 90%. Lexow Committee In the 1890s, a Presbyterian minister, the Rev. Charles Parkhurst, launched a crusade against vice and corruption, going undercover to saloons and brothels to collect evidence of police corruption. His activism prompted leaders in the state capital to form a committee, headed by State Sen. Clarence Lexow. The Lexow Committee held hearings and issued documents, demonstrating that NYPD officers were on the take. The revelations of corruption led to the election of a reform-minded mayor, William Strong, serving a temporary setback to the corrupt Tammany Hall political machine. To further police reform, Strong appointed Theodore Roosevelt as NYPD commissioner. Curran Committee In 1912, another committee was formed to investigate allegations of NYPD corruption. Hofstadter Committee The Hofstadter Committee, also known as the Seabury investigations, was a joint legislative committee formed by the New York State Legislature to probe police and judicial corruption in New York City in 1931. Prompted by allegations of corruption in police and court systems, the Hofstadter Committee heard testimony from a thousand citizens, policemen, judges, lawyers and defendants about unjust treatment before the law. Many people, who were charged with crimes in the Magistrate's Court, were innocent of wrongdoing, and the victims were railroaded into paying money through certain attorneys to court personnel, police and others. The Hofstadter Committee's work resulted in a massive shake-up of the lower court system and the resignation of New York City Mayor Jimmy Walker. New York County Sheriff Thomas M. Farley was removed from office by Gov. Franklin D. Roosevelt. Major changes in the method of arrest, bail and litigation of suspects in New York City were also brought about by the Hofstadter Committee's work. The pressure for reform, once unleashed, later ensnared State Senator Samuel H. Hofstadter, who chaired the commission, when the executive committee of the Association of the Bar of the City of New York held that State Senator Hofstadter had violated the public trust by having accepted a judicial appointment from Tammany Hall when he was investigating that political organization's \\"domination of the city government.\\" Helfand Investigation From 1949 to 1950, another probe was conducted of allegations of NYPD corruption. Knapp Commission The Knapp Commission was appointed in 1970 by former New York City Mayor John Lindsay to investigate corruption at the NYPD after whistleblowers Frank Serpico and David Durk made revelations about corruption at the NYPD. The Knapp Commission's chief counsel, Michael F. Armstrong, said at the time that \\"the department has a serious corruption problem that must be characterized as extensive.\\" The extent of police corruption included allegations that \\"several policemen invited a New Jersey gambler to set up shop in the Bronx when a bookmaker in that borough went broke and the policemen lost their source of graft.\\" Investigations by the Knapp Commission showed a pattern of extorting money from criminals, other payoffs, and other corruption. Before the Knapp Commission could fully begin its work, NYPD Commissioner Howard R. Leary resigned after community leaders questioned his ability to address allegations of systemic corruption at the NYPD. Leary was succeeded as commissioner by Patrick V. Murphy. In 1971, police officer Serpico, Lt. Durk, and other officers, testified before the Knapp Commission about the corruption they witnessed in the department. The Knapp Commission faulted some of top city officials at the time, including : a top advisor to the mayor, the former City Commissioner of Investigation, and the former First Deputy Police Commissioner, for failing to act \\"when informed of widespread bribery among plainclothes policemen responsible for enforcing the gambling laws in the Bronx.\\" For example, even after police officer Serpico blew the whistle on police corruption, Mayor Lindsay \\"did not see to it that the specific charges of corruption\\" made by officer Serpico \\"were investigated.\\" The Knapp Commission confirmed that the NYPD's internal affairs division was corrupted, noting how the head of internal affairs was caught in the act of trying to collect information from the files of the detective bureau \\"at the request of the first deputy commissioner.\\" The Knapp Commission further found that there existed a \\"reluctance on the part of top-level police personnel to undertake investigations that might have led to exposure of widespread corruption inconsistent with the official line that corruption was limited to a few 'rotten apples.' \\" The Knapp Commission's findings also faulted the city's Department of Investigation and the District Attorneys offices for their sub par efforts to fight \\"the widespread corruption which then existed.\\" The Commission's findings led to reforms within the department, developed by Commissioner Murphy. Reforms included decentralizing corruption control, within Field Investigative Units, which were intended to be closer and more in touch with the streets where the problems were. Mollen Commission Other commissions have investigated the NYPD before and after the Knapp Commission, including 1994's Mollen Commission, which documented widespread police abuse during the late 1980s and early 1990s .Chin, Gabriel J. (Ed.) (1997) New York City Police Corruption Investigation Commissions. New York: William S. Hein & Co. The Mollen Commission was appointed in 1992 by former New York City Mayor David Dinkins to investigate corruption at the NYPD. Before the Mollen Commission could fully begin its work, NYPD Commissioner Lee P. Brown resigned after reportedly disagreeing with Dinkins' decision to form the police investigation commission. Brown was succeeded as commissioner by Raymond Kelly. The media reported that an interim report, issued by the Mollen Commission in late 1993, showed that \\"the New York City Police Department had failed at every level to uproot corruption and had instead tolerated a culture that fostered misconduct and concealed lawlessness by police officers,\\" adding that the interim report made \\"findings that some delegates of the Patrolmen's Benevolent Association, the main police union, may have attempted to block corruption investigations.\\" The interim report showed that based on a \\"variety of sources, including police officers and prosecutors,\\" police unions thwarted efforts to expose corruption. The Mollen Commission recommended the creation of a permanent agency with subpoena power and the authority to conduct its own investigations of police corruption. However, the Mollen Commission stopped short of recommending that this permanent agency should have powers to prosecute its own cases, relegating prosecutions to the city prosecutors. \\"We find as shocking the incompetence and the inadequacies of the department to police itself,\\" the commission's chairman, Milton Mollen, was quoted to have said at the time of the release of its interim report. In 1994, the Mollen Commission issued its final report. Community-relations task force Former Mayor Rudolph Giuliani formed a community-relations task force after Abner Louima was brutally attacked by several police officers in a Brooklyn precinct house. The recommendations of Giuliani's task force were watered down \\"to make it easier for Mayor Giuliani who called some of the report's recommendations unrealistic to adopt reforms quickly.\\" Three members of the task force issued a dissenting report, calling for stronger recommendations to fight police brutality after finding \\"a connection between race and police misconduct.\\" Giuliani dismissed the recommendations made by the majority of his own task force. Furthermore, according to The New York Times, the dissenting report made a recommendation, \\"the creation of an independent special prosecutor's office with the powers to prosecute police brutality and corruption,\\" but the majority of the task force had rejected that proposal. Civil rights reports The New York Civil Liberties Union (NYCLU) has on three notable occasions drawn attention to NYPD misconduct or failures in oversight. In April 2003, the NYCLU issued a report about the NYPD's conduct during the massive February 15, 2003, antiwar protest, which took place in Manhattan, making recommendations to avoid \\"various missteps,\\" which the report indicated to include the NYPD's denial of a permit for the event, and later, during the protest, the use of pepper spray on protesters, the erection of confining pens, the charging of horses into crowds, the use of force to clear demonstrators, and the process by which arrests were made by police. The report issued five recommendations to New York City - recognize the importance of protest marches, ensure free access to protest events, not use force to clear demonstrators, revise its policy of using pens, and revise its policy of arresting demonstrators for minor offenses at protest events. In August 2005, the NYCLU finalized another report, this time examining policing practices during the 2004 Republican National Convention held in New York City. The report documented instances of the use of excessive force and intimidation by police, the use of plainclothes officers in unmarked scooters, the use of nets to stop demonstrators to make mass arrests, the use of cameras to apparently videotape \\"all protest activity,\\" making unlawful and mass arrests, and t complaints about the length and the hazardous conditions of detention following arrests. Further, the report noted the use of batons, pepper spray, and horses to charge into protesters, and in this report, the NYCLU criticized the NYPD for applying its controversial broken windows theory of policing to demonstrations. In all, the NYCLU escalated the number of recommendations it made from its prior report, suggesting 12 changes to NYPD tactics, which appeared to build on the previous recommendations made in its 2003 report. In March 2010, the NYCLU released 16 years' worth of reports from the NYPD's Internal Affairs Bureau (IAB). The reports were obtained under a request filed in accordance with the Freedom of Information Act. The documents released consisted of annual IAB reports covering the years from 1993 through 2008. According to analysis by the NYCLU, the number of tips of misconduct or corruption received by IAB more than tripled over the period from 1994 to 2006, but the number of serious misconduct investigations were cut by more than half. IAB was investigating about 15% of tips in 1994; by 2004, IAB was only investigating around 2% of tips, revealing a sharp decrease in internal investigatory oversight. In its press release announcing its release and review of the IAB annual reports, the NYCLU further noted, \\"The annual IAB reports have become less informative over time, with critical information removed from them over time.\\" Failure of oversight Although the Knapp and Mollen commissions were empaneled to investigate corruption and misconduct at the NYPD, they were not empowered to prosecute their own cases. The Civilian Complaint Review Board (CCRB) was established as an agency in New York City in 1993 to be staffed by civilians with the authority to investigate allegations of police misconduct. However, two decades later, its effectiveness was called into question. In 2014, former CCRB executive director Tracey Catapano-Fox alleged in a federal lawsuit that the CCRB covers up misconduct by NYPD officers. Ms. Catapano-Fox's lawsuit alleged that CCRB chair Richard Emery made a \\"decision to collude\\" with NYPD, among other charges. According to a press report in the Daily News, Ms. Catapano-Fox alleged that Mr. Emery \\"attempted to conceal recent statistics on the number of stop-and-frisks in the city, and 'suggested' claims not be investigated,\\" adding that, in Ms. Catapano-Fox lawsuit, it was further alleged that Mr. \\"Emery has made concerted efforts to conceal the true 'stop- and-frisk' statistics.\\" Following the Mollen Commission's work, then police commissioner William Bratton opposed the central recommendation of the Mollen Commission: The creation of a permanent commission to investigate corruption at the NYPD and monitor the Internal Affairs Bureau. Commissioner Bratton, at the time, opposed the idea that an outside monitor should have investigatory powers. In the wake of the 30th and 48th Precinct station house corruption scandals, Commissioner Bratton, at the time, reportedly did not take action on a comprehensive memorandum prepared by Walter Mack, the former Deputy Commissioner for Internal Affairs, which \\"concluded that patterns of abuse and corruption complaints in several precincts in central Brooklyn, upper Manhattan, and the Bronx suggested that the corruption uncovered in the 30th and 48th precincts was not unusual,\\" according to The New York Times. Indeed, then Commissioner Bratton had abruptly dismissed Mack, though Mack, who was then described as the \\"department's top corruption fighter\\" by The New York Times, had \\"said the same troubling trend of allegations of brutality and corruption found in the 30th and 48th Precincts exists along a wide swath of northern Manhattan and the southern and western portions of the Bronx, including the 34th, 44th, and 46th Precincts,\\" according to a report in The New York Times. While trying to downplay the size of the problem of police corruption, Bratton testified at a 1994 City Council hearing that \\"hundreds\\" of police officerso had committed criminal acts. In 2011, during a months-long investigation by the Associated Press of the NYPD's surveillance of Muslims, the news agency concluded, \\"The department's primary watchdog, the New York City Council, has not held hearings on the intelligence division's operations and former NYPD officials said council members typically do not ask for details.\\" The complaint that the New York City Council does not adequately oversee the NYPD was repeated by whistleblower Artyom Matusov, who said he was fired by Council Speaker Melissa Mark-Viverito after Matusov went \\"public with allegations that Police Commissioner Bill Bratton deceived lawmakers at a Sept. 8 hearing by lowballing how often his officers use force on the job,\\" according to the Daily News. Making it difficult for IAB to investigate reports of misconduct, Brooklyn Borough President Eric Adams, a former NYPD captain, told the wire service Reuters in late 2014 that the IAB leaks the identities of NYPD officers who file complaints against other officers. Of the broken system to investigate official misconduct, Borough President Adams said, \\"There's no real outlet to report the abuse.\\" After Eric Garner's July 2014 chokehold death, the Department of Investigation issued a report, examining 10 cases where the CCRB substantiated complaints about officers using chokeholds. The report showed that the NYPD rejected recommendations for discipline in a majority of the examined cases, raising concerns about the lack of accountability for police misconduct. Philip Eure, the inspector general of the NYPD, told The New York Times, \\"Obviously, we are going to be looking at a broader sample of cases to see if it's more systemic, but people should be troubled by the disconnect that we determined exists already in the disciplinary process.\\" An independent 2015 investigation into the transparency of New York government agencies showed that the NYPD was resistant to revealing even basic information about itself. A request filed under the state's Freedom of Information Act seeking the names of the NYPD's employees was denied on the basis that a list of employees was information that was not in the \\"possession, custody, or control\\" of the agency. The investigation, conducted in joint co-operation between the transparency Web site MuckRock and the news publication The New York World, surveyed 86 municipal and state agencies. The worst-performing agency was the NYPD, which received the grade of \\"F\\" for its resistance to disclosing information about itself. 2020 Eric Garner Anti-Chokehold Act On June 8, 2020, both houses of the New York state assembly passed the Eric Garner Anti-Chokehold Act, which makes it so any police officer in the state of New York who injures or kills somebody through the use of \\"a chokehold or similar restraint\\" can be charged with a class C felony, punishable by up to 15 years in prison. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo signed the police reforms, which he described as \\"long overdue\\", into law on June 12, 2020.

She was better known in her role as one of the premier West Coast Steamships operated by the Los Angeles Steamship Company under her original name SS. Harvard. Construction SS. Harverd began as the commercial passenger ship SS Harvard, and along with the sister ship SS Yale, was built in 1907 at Chester, Pennsylvania, by the Delaware River Iron Shipbuilding and Engine Works. Naval service The U.S. Navy commandeered her on 21 March 1918 for World War I service, assigned her the registry Identification Number (Id. No.) 1298, outfitted her for service as a troop transport at Mare Island Navy Yard at Vallejo, California, and commissioned her as USS Harvard (ID-1298) on 9 April 1918 with Lieutenant Commander M. F. Tarpey, USNRF, in command. On 11 April 1918 she was renamed USS Charles (ID-1298). The Navy later (on 28 August 1918) purchased Charles outright from her owners. Departing Mare Island, Charles reached Hampton Roads, Virginia, on 26 June 1918. There she loaded troops and departed Newport News, Virginia, for Brest, France, on 10 July 1918. She arrived at Brest on 21 July 1918. On 27 July 1918, Charles reported at Southampton, England, for duty as a ferry for troops crossing the English Channel. She made about 60 voyages between Southampton and Le Havre or Boulogne, France, carrying troops of all nationalities bound for action at the front during the war or for occupation duty after it ended, until 5 May 1919. Her ferrying duties completed, Charles embarked passengers at Rotterdam in the Netherlands and at Brest for transportation to the United States, and on 15 June 1919, arrived at New York City. Her support of United States Army operations in Europe at an end, Charles arrived at the Philadelphia Navy Yard at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on 24 July 1919, and was decommissioned there on 10 June 1920.

It is a compact industrial complex built by the national corporation Procter & Gamble comprising five major three-story brick buildings spread over . These major buildings are the Process Building (1929), the Soap Chip Building (1929), the Bar Soap Building (1929), the Warehouse (1929), and the Tide Building (1949). Procter & Gamble's late 1920s decision to locate its second east coast soap manufacturing plant in Baltimore reflects the strengths of Baltimore's industrial infrastructure in the early 20th century. Their choice of sites is particularly telling in light of Procter & Gamble's unique strengths as a corporation. Founded in 1837 as a family partnership, Procter & Gamble by the beginning of the 20th century had developed into a major U.S. corporation. Procter & Gamble pioneered practices such as radio and television advertising, application of technology developed by in-house laboratories, market research, brand-management systems, promotion from within the organization, employee profit-sharing, and rationalized production schedules. The company has long been known as an innovative, well-run entity that developed and refined methods that defined mid-20th century American corporate culture. Material published in 1955 and 1964 provides an indication of the company's impact and operations. On the occasion of their 25th anniversary in 1955, Procter & Gamble placed an advertisement that touted the company's impact on Baltimore: > Better Business! > Most of the dollars that Ivory brings to Baltimore in P&G; Payroll and > plant-operating expenditures are quickly passed on to local business. > Whenever possible Procter & Gamble buys the supplies and services it needs > here in town. > Better Jobs! > Employees at Procter & Gamble are able to help make better jobs for others > because they enjoy unusually steady jobs themselves -- are year- round > customers for local business of all kinds. Procter & Gamble's famous > employment plan guarantees eligible employees 48 weeks' work each year - - > in addition to profit- sharing and pension benefits. > Better Living! > Tax money paid by P&G; and other leading local industries benefits the > entire community. It helps provide better schools and parks, greater fire > and police protection. By 1990, the Procter & Gamble Baltimore Plant was producing only soaps like Ivory and Camay, and synthetic liquid detergents like Joy, Dawn, and liquid Cascade. In 1993, Procter & Gamble set aside reserves to fund a major restructuring of the corporation, including plant consolidation. On January 13, 1994, they announced that the Baltimore Plant was one of four that would be closed. Procter and Gamble Baltimore Plant was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1999. The current site is now the headquarters of Under Armour.

The Sinus Sabaeus quadrangle is one of a series of 30 quadrangle maps of Mars used by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) Astrogeology Research Program. It is also referred to as MC-20 (Mars Chart-20).Davies, M.E.; Batson, R.M.; Wu, S.S.C. ‚ÄúGeodesy and Cartography‚Äù in Kieffer, H.H.; Jakosky, B.M.; Snyder, C.W.; Matthews, M.S., Eds. Mars. University of Arizona Press: Tucson, 1992. The Sinus Sabaeus quadrangle covers the area from 315¬∞ to 360¬∞ west longitude and 0¬∞ to 30¬∞ degrees south latitude on Mars. It contains Schiaparelli, a large, easily visible crater that sits close to the equator. The Sinus Sabaeus quadrangle contains parts of Noachis Terra and Terra Sabaea. The name comes from an incense-rich location south of the Arabian peninsula (the Gulf of Aden).Blunck, J. 1982. Mars and its Satellites. Exposition Press. Smithtown, N.Y.  Layers  Wislicenus Crater and the Schiaparelli basin crater contains layers, also called strata. Many places on Mars show rocks arranged in layers.Grotzinger, J. and R. Milliken (eds.) 2012. Sedimentary Geology of Mars. SEPM Sometimes the layers are of different colors. Light-toned rocks on Mars have been associated with hydrated minerals like sulfates. The Mars Rover Opportunity examined such layers close- up with several instruments. Some layers are probably made up of fine particles because they seem to break up into fine dust. Other layers break up into large boulders so they are probably much harder. Basalt, a volcanic rock, is thought to in the layers that form boulders. Basalt has been identified on Mars in many places. Instruments on orbiting spacecraft have detected clay (also called phyllosilicates) in some layers. Scientists are excited about finding hydrated minerals such as sulfates and clays on Mars because they are usually formed in the presence of water.http://themis.asu.edu/features/nilosyrtis Places that contain clays and/or other hydrated minerals would be good places to look for evidence of life.http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/PSP_004046_2080 Rock can form layers in a variety of ways. Volcanoes, wind, or water can produce layers.http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu?PSP_008437_1750 Layers can be hardened by the action of groundwater. Martian ground water probably moved hundreds of kilometers, and in the process it dissolved many minerals from the rock it passed through. When ground water surfaces in low areas containing sediments, water evaporates in the thin atmosphere and leaves behind minerals as deposits and/or cementing agents. Consequently, layers of dust could not later easily erode away since they were cemented together. On Earth, mineral-rich waters often evaporate forming large deposits of various types of salts and other minerals. Sometimes water flows through Earth's aquifers, and then evaporates at the surface just as is hypothesized for Mars. One location this occurs on Earth is the Great Artesian Basin of Australia.Habermehl, M. A. (1980) The Great Artesian Basin, Australia. J. Austr. Geol. Geophys. 5, 9‚Äì38. On Earth the hardness of many sedimentary rocks, like sandstone, is largely due to the cement that was put in place as water passed through.

The primary impact may also eject significant numbers of rocks which eventually fall back to make secondary craters.http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/science_themes/impact.php The secondary craters may be arranged in clusters. All of the craters in the cluster would appear to be equally eroded; indicating that they would all are of the same age. If these secondary craters formed from a single, large, nearby impact, then they would have formed at roughly the same instant in time. The image below of Denning Crater shows a cluster of secondary craters.

Wikilambert.jpgLambert Crater (Martian Crater), as seen by CTX camera (on Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter). Impact craters generally have a rim with ejecta around them, in contrast volcanic craters usually do not have a rim or ejecta deposits. As craters get larger (greater than 10 km in diameter) they usually have a central peak.http://www.lpi.usra.edu/publications/slidesets/stones/ The peak is caused by a rebound of the crater floor following the impact. If one measures the diameter of a crater, the original depth can be estimated with various ratios. Because of this relationship, researchers have found that many Martian craters contain a great deal of material; much of it is believed to be ice deposited when the climate was different.Garvin, J., et al. 2002. Global geometric properities of martian impact craters. Lunar Planet Sci. 33. Abstract @1255. Sometimes craters expose layers that were buried. Rocks from deep underground are tossed onto the surface. Hence, craters can show us what lies deep under the surface.  White rock in Pollack crater  Within the region is Pollack crater, which has light-toned rock deposits. Mars has an old surface compared to Earth. While much of Earth's land surface is just a few hundred million years old, large areas of Mars are billions of years old. Some surface areas have been formed, eroded away, then covered over with new layers of rocks. The Mariner 9 spacecraft in the 1970s photographed a feature that was called \\"White Rock.\\". Newer images revealed that the rock is not really white, but that the area close by is so dark that the white rock looks really white. It was thought that this feature could have been a salt deposit, but information from the instruments on Mars Global Surveyor demonstrated rather that it was probably volcanic ash or dust. Today, it is believed that White Rock represents an old rock layer that once filled the whole crater that it's in, but today it has since been mostly eroded away. The picture below shows white rock with a spot of the same rock some distance from the main deposit, so it is thought that the white material once covered a far larger area.http://space.com/scienceastronomy/solarsystem/mars_daily_020419.html Image:Whiterock.JPGWhiterock on crater floor may be what's left of a much larger deposit. Arrow shows that the deposit once reached much farther. Picture taken by THEMIS. Image:Pollack Crater White Rock.jpgWhite Rock in Pollack Crater as seen by HiRISE.

Web. .Lawfulness of criticism Sunnis assert that because Aisha is the wife of Muhammad, criticizing her is tantamount to criticizing him. The Shi'a counter this by referring to the situation of both Nuh and Lut's wives told in the Qur'an: Ismail ibn Kathir, a renowned commentator on the Qur'an,http://www.ibnkathir.com said on this verse: \\"Therefore, all the intimate knowledge of their husbands neither helped them nor prevented punishment, hence Allah's statement, (So, they availed them not against Allah) means, because their wives were disbelievers\\"Tafsir ibn Kathir, Tafsir of Surah 66, verse 10 Wife of Muhammad Status as favorite wife Shias reject the idea that Aisha was Muhammad's favorite wife and believe that Muhammad favored none of his wives in compliance with the Qur'anic verse: They also quote Muhammad: \\"When a man has two wives and he is inclined to one of them, he will come on the Day of resurrection with a side hanging down.\\"Sunan Abu Dawud, Bab al-Nikah, Book 11, Number 2128 Others believe that Umm Salama was his favorite wife due to her dedication to the Ahl al-Bayt. Umm Salama is presented as a contrast to Aisha through her loyalty to Muhammad's family as well as obedience to his commands after his death. Unlike Aisha, who raised an army against Ali, Umm Salama tried to calm tensions. She also warned Ali of Aisha's intentions when dissuading Aisha from rebellion was unsuccessful. It is generally accepted by Sunnis and Shias that Khadijah was Muhammad's favorite wife without contest, and that Aisha or Umm Salama were only the favorite of his later wives. Some use the fact that Muhammad was only in a monogamous relationship with Khadijah as evidence of her superiority to his later wives. One opinion is that Muhammad's marriage to Aisha was only prescribed to ease his suffering after Khadijah's death, diminishing the implications of divine intent for the union. Mohammed's love and gratitude for Khadijah was so great that Aisha would become jealous. One time, Khadijah's sister Hala whose voice sounded exactly like Khadijah came to visit the Mohammed, as soon as he heard the familiar voice, he said \\"It must be Hala, her voice is just like that of Khadijah.\\" At this, Aisha burst forth \\"How is it that you always think of that old woman who is no more living when Allah has given you much better wives.\\" Mohammed replied, \\"Never better\\". On another occasion, he said: \\"Aisha! Khadijah's love was given to me by Allah; never did Allah give me a better wife than Khadijah.\\"Islamiat for students. By: Farkhanda Noor Muhammad. p.99 Character The Shi'a reject the general Sunni belief that Aisha was the best woman of her time. All Shi'as uphold that Fatimah, Muhammad's daughter and wife of Ali ibn Abi Talib's the greatest woman ever whilst Shi'as also uphold her as infallible. Shia consider Fatima's ideal of the innocent and long-suffering as the counterpart to the sexual and political misdemeanors of which they accuse Aisha. Fatima is described as an exemplary wife, daughter, and mother and the only woman of the Fourteen Perfect of Pure Ones in Shia tradition. They cite the following hadith: Ahmad ibn Hanbal records: Anas narrated that the prophet (s) said: \\"The most excellent of the women of all worlds are: Maryam the daughter of al-Imran, Khadijah the daughter of Khuwaylid, Fatimah the daughter of Muhammad, and Asiyah the wife of Pharaoh\\"Musnad Ahmed bin Hanbal, Volume 3, Page 135, Hadith 12414Musnad Ahmed bin Hanbal, Volume 1, page 293, Hadith 2668 Although Sunnis attribute thousands of hadith to Aisha, Shias do not consider her a reputable source of hadith. She is deemed an untrustworthy and unreliable source because of her partisanship. Instead, Fatima and Ali are considered the best sources of hadith and are included as authoritative sources by both Shias and Sunnis. However, Aisha is used in certain hadith to serve as an example of how proper women should not behave. Her character is further questioned by an accusation that she secretly disliked Ali, as related in Maria Dakake's The Charismatic Community. Jealousy Shia believe that Aisha was jealous of Muhammad's other wives,Sahih Muslim Book 008, Number 3453 especially his first wife, Khadijah.Sahih Bukhari Volume 5, Book 58, Number 164Sahih Bukhari Volume 5, Book 58, Number 166 On one occasion she is reported to have been tired of Muhammad speaking of his first wife so often and said that Allah had replaced Khadijah with a better wife, referring to herself, for which Muhammad rebuked her. She is also criticized for deceiving Muhammad and hatching a plan with Hafsa bint Umar to stop him spending a long time at Zaynab bint Jahsh's house.Sahih Bukhari Volume 7, Book 63, Number 192Sahih Bukhari Volume 7, Book 63, Number 193Sahih Muslim Book 009, Number 3496 They believe this shows a severe amount of disrespect and insubordination to her husband. The following verses of the Qur'an are unanimously agreed by scholars to be referring to Aisha and Hafsa:Sahih Bukhari Volume 6, Book 60, Number 436Sahih Bukhari Volume 6, Book 60, Number 437 The Shi'a website ‚ÄúAnswering-Ansar.org‚Äù project (renamed as Shia Pen) comments on this verse: \\"Some Ahl al-Sunnah assert that since Aisha was the most superior wife then that means that she was the most superior of all women. Not only is the claim that she was the most superior wife baseless, the fact of the matter is in Surah Tahrim, Allah (swt) also states this: \\"Perhaps if he divorces you, his Lord will give him wives who are better than you, who submit and believe‚Äù (Qur'an 66:5)- this clearly indicates that there were believing women among the Muslims who were much better than Aisha.\\" Another example of Aisha's jealousy is found in a story regarding Safiyyah, another of Muhammad's wives. Aisha is reported to have mocked Safiyyah's jewish heritage, which invoked Muhammad's defense of Safiyyah. He reminded Aisha that while Safiyyah's people descended from prophets, Aisha's ancestors had no special status. Aisha is also reported to have slandered against Muhammad's wife, Maryam the Copt, and spread rumors questioning her chastity. Shias believe that Maryam was cleared of these charges in the verse many Sunnis claim exonerates Aisha of charges of adultery. One hadith attributed to Ali, the fourth caliph, condemns jealousy in all women. \\"Jealousy in women is unpardonable, but in a man it is a sign of his faith in religion.\\" Muhammad's wives held a higher place in society than other women according to verse 33:32 of the Qur'an O ye wives of the Prophet! Ye are not like any other women. If ye keep your duty (to Allah), then be not soft of speech, lest he in whose heart is a disease aspire (to you), but utter customary speech. and so were more accountable for their faults like jealousy. Resentment towards Ali The negative Shi'a view of Aisha largely stems from Aisha's animosity towards Ali and the Ahl al-bayt in general. The Ahl al-bayt is defined by Muhammad, his daughter Fatima, her husband Ali, and their two sons Hasan and Husayn. They do not include Muhammad's wives in this category. Aisha's feelings towards Ali developed when she was accused of adultery. Muhammad took Aisha on a campaign against a Bedouin tribe. Aisha noticed she lost her necklace during a caravan rest stop and retraced her steps to find the piece of jewelry. When she returned, Aisha realized she was mistakenly left behind. Aisha returned to Medina escorted on a camel by a young man, which quickly led to gossip and speculation. Muhammad was deeply affected by this occurrence and turned to others for advice. The strongest opinion came from Muhammad's cousin Ali who said, ‚ÄúThere are women enough, you could make another her successor‚Äù and he suggested that Muhammad divorce Aisha. Aisha never forgot about Ali's statement, which sparked the hatred towards Ali that continued when he tried to become Muhammad's successor. Although Sunnis believe that Allah revealed Aisha's innocence in the following verse Lo! they who spread the slander are a gang among you. Deem it not a bad thing for you; nay, it is good for you. Unto every man of them (will be paid) that which he hath earned of the sin; and as for him among them who had the greater share therein, his will be an awful doom. Some Shias believe that this verse was about Maryam the Copt instead of Aisha, and so in their eyes the charge against her has never been cleared. However, others agree with the Sunni view that this verse proves her innocent. Shi'a supported the advancement of Ali in the political world and disregarded Aisha because of her feelings towards Ali. The Shi'a preferred Ali over the first three caliphs; they never accepted Mu‚Äôawiya or any later caliphs, and Shi'a took the name shi‚Äôat Ali, or Ali's Party. Shi'a also regarded Ali to be the most judicious of the Companions. The early Shi'a deemed Ali and his descendants to have rights to leadership based on their relationship to Muhammad, their designation by Muhammad as his successors, along with their knowledge and religious insight. Role in Fitnah Overview The biggest criticism that the Shi'a have of Aisha was her role in the First Fitnah (First Islamic civil war). The Shi'a view her (and all) opposition to Ali's Khalifat as a sinful act. The Shi'a website ‚ÄúAnswering-Ansar.org‚Äù project (renamed as Shia Pen) poses the question: 'If rejecting a Rightly Guided Khalifah is tantamount to apostasy and rebelling against any Khalifah even Yazid ibn Mu'awiyah will lead to such persons being raised as betrayers in the next world; what of those individuals who rebelled and fought the fourth rightly guided Khalifah? This was the verdict of Abdullah Ibn Umar in his defence of Yazid (See Sahih al Bukhari, Arabic- English, Volume 9, Number 127)' Uthman's death Aisha was a key player in the rebellion against 'Uthman ibn 'Affan, the third Khalifah. They quote her naming 'Uthman a nathal who should be killed, from numerous sources.Al Nahaya, volume 5, page 80Qamus, page 500 \\"lughut Nathal\\" by FirozabadiLisan al Arab, Volume 11 Chapter \\"Lughuth Nathal\\" page 670Sharh Nahjul Balagha Ibn al Hadeed Volume 2 page 122Sheikh al-Mudhira, by Mahmoud Abu Raya, p170 (foot note)Al- Imama wa al-Siyasa, Volume 1 page 52Tarikh Mukhtasar al-Duwal, by Ibn Al- Ebrei, v1 p55Al-Mahsol, by al-Razi, v. 4, p. 343 They claim her motive was to install her inlaw, Talhah ibn Ubaydullah, as 'Uthman's successor. They also believe that only when the people turned to 'Ali ibn Abi Talib to become the Khalifah did Aisha change her stance and fight 'Ali to demand Qisas for Uthman. They cite some Sahabah and Tabi'in who highlighted her sudden shift in policy: \\"Ubayd bin Abi Salma who was a maternal relative of Aisha met her as she was making her way to Madinah. Ubayd said \\"Uthman has been killed and the people were without an Imam for eight days\\" to which Aisha asked \\"What did they do next?\\". Ubayd said \\"The people approached '‚ÄòAli and gave him bayya\\". Aisha then said 'Take me back! Take me back to Makkah\\". She then turned her face towards Makkah and said, 'Verily Uthman was murdered innocently, and By Allah, I shall avenge his blood'. Ubayd then said 'You are now calling Uthman innocent, even though it was you who said 'Kill Nathal, this Jew\\".Tarikh Kamil, Volume 3, Page 100 Battle of the Camel The Shi'a frown upon her role in the Battle of the Camel. The Battle of the Camel took place in Basra on December 4, 656 CE. This battle is regarded as the first time Muslims, particularly Muslims who ranked among Muhammad's sahaba, clashed and fought against one another in open warfare. The Battle of the Camel has been considered to be the first fitna and is also referred to as a ‚Äúrebellion that leads to schism‚Äù, ‚Äúviolent factional strife‚Äù, or even ‚Äúthe temptation to turn upon one‚Äôs fellow Muslims‚Äù. The name of the battle reflects the centrality of Aisha's role in the conflict, as she was seated on her camel in the middle of the battlefield. Aisha led a force of 13,000 soldiers against Ali after he failed to punish the murder of ‚ÄòUthman. During the Battle of the Camel, Aisha mobilized military opposition with two male allies, Zubayr ibn al-Awam and Talhah, in order to challenge the legitimacy of ‚ÄòAli. ‚ÄòAlis forces defeated their opponents; Talhah and Zubayr ibn al-Awam were killed, and Aisha was sent home. Shi'a find this battle to be controversial because they believe that she launched her army on Ali out of her personal hatred towards him and his family. They use the following narration in their argument: ‚ÄúAisha was informed about the opinion of the women, but there was some thing inside her boiling like a cooking pot against Ali‚ÄùKanz al-Ummal, Volume 16, Page 186, Tradition 44216 The Shi'a also usually refer to the Qur'anic verse: They state that the verse clearly instructs Muhammad's wives to stay in their homes. They say that Aisha's role in the battle cleary transgresses Allah's commandment. The Shi'a also quote 'Ali ibn Abi Talib to back up their stance on this verse: 'He ('Ali) said: ‚ÄòGo to that woman and tell her to return to her home wherein Allah had ordered her to remain‚Äô. He (Ibn Abbas) said: ‚ÄòI therefore went to her and asked permission to enter, but she didn‚Äôt grant it. I therefore entered the house without her permission and sat on a cushion. She (Aisha) said: ‚ÄòO Ibn Abbas, by Allah I have never witnessed anyone like you! You entered our house without permission and sat on our cushion without our permission‚Äô. I said: ‚ÄòBy Allah this is not your house, your only house is the one wherein Allah ordered you to remain, but you didn‚Äôt obey. The Commander of the Faithful orders you to return to that homeland from which you had left.' Iqd al-Farid, Volume 2, Page 108 They also quote Shaykh Sibt Jauzi al-Hanafi, Shaykh Ibn Talha Shafiyi and Ibn Sabagh Maliki. Who all record that prior to the battle of Jamal: \\"He Ali wrote a letter to Aisha: 'By leaving your home you have disobeyed Allah(swt) and his Rasul(messenger)\\"Shaykh Sibt Jauzi al- Hanafi, Tazkirah tul Khawwas, Page 38Shaykh Ibn Talha Shafiyi, Matalib al- Se'ul, Page 112Ibn Sabagh Maliki in Fusul al-Muhimma, Page 72 They reject Aisha's reason for the battle that she was demanding Qisas for 'Uthman ibn 'Affan. They don't believe that it was her place to demand Qisas and assert that only the Imam(Head of State) can implement Shari'ah (including Qisas). The Shi'a website ‚ÄúAnswering-Ansar.org‚Äù project (renamed as Shia Pen) comments: \\"What they fail to point out is the fact that Aisha's demands for Qisas i.e. that the killers of Uthman be handed over, was also contrary to the Sharia since Islamic penalties are implemented by the Head of State not the public, as and when they feel like it. Moreover Aisha was not the heir of Uthman to demand Qisas, he was survived by sons who were adult. It was their right to demand, but even if they did, that is all that they could do, they could NOT incite and rebel against Imam 'Ali (as) if they did not get their way, as Aisha did. You cannot hold the State to ransom, insisting that your demands are met through methods such as propaganda, incitement, and seizing control of administrative provinces.\\" See also *Fatwa of Ali Khamenei against insulting revered Sunni figures References External links * Ayesha's role in Islam * Ayesha Aisha Category:Shia Islam Category:Abu Bakr family Category:Arab women Category:Wives of Muhammad ","title":"Shia view of Aisha"},{"id":"21553193","title":"List of Hannah Montana songs"},{"id":"21553198","text":"Huygens crater. The southern one-third includes the northern rim of the Hellas basin. The Iapygia quadrangle is one of a series of 30 quadrangle maps of Mars used by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) Astrogeology Research Program. The Iapygia quadrangle is also referred to as MC-21 (Mars Chart-21).Davies, M.E.; Batson, R.M.; Wu, S.S.C. ‚ÄúGeodesy and Cartography‚Äù in Kieffer, H.H.; Jakosky, B.M.; Snyder, C.W.; Matthews, M.S., Eds.

Parts of the regions Tyrrhena Terra and Terra Sabaea are found in this quadrangle. The largest crater in this quadrangle is Huygens. Some interesting features in this quadrangle are dikes.Head, J. et al. 2006. The Huygens-Hellas giant dike system on Mars: Implications for Late Noachian-Early Hesperian volcanic resurfacing and climatic evolution. Geology. 34:4: 285-288. the many layers found in Terby crater, and the presence of carbonates on the rim of Huygens crater. Dikes Near Huygens, especially just to the east of it, are a number of narrow ridges which appear to be the remnants of dikes, like the ones around Shiprock, New Mexico. The dikes were once under the surface, but have now been eroded. Dikes are magma-filled cracks that often carry lava to the surface. Dikes by definition cut across rock layers. Some dikes on earth are associated with mineral deposits. Discovering dikes on Mars means that perhaps future colonists will be able to mine needed minerals on Mars, instead of transporting them all the way from the Earth. Some features look like dikes, but may be what has been called linear ridge networks.Head, J., J. Mustard. 2006. Breccia dikes and crater-related faults in impact craters on Mars: Erosion and exposure on the floor of a crater 75 km in diameter at the dichotomy boundary, Meteorit. Planet Science: 41, 1675-1690. Ridges often appear as mostly straight segments that intersect in a lattice-like manner. They are hundreds of meters long, tens of meters high, and several meters wide. It is thought that impacts created fractures in the surface; these fractures later acted as channels for fluids. Fluids cemented the structures. With the passage of time, surrounding material was eroded away, thereby leaving hard ridges behind. Since the ridges occur in locations with clay, these formations could serve as a marker for clay which requires water for its formation. Water here could have supported life.Mangold et al. 2007.

Rock can form layers in a variety of ways. Volcanoes, wind, or water can produce layers. A detailed discussion of layering with many Martian examples can be found in Sedimentary Geology of Mars.Grotzinger, J. and R. Milliken (eds.). 2012. Sedimentary Geology of Mars. SEPM. Layers can be hardened by the action of groundwater. Martian ground water probably moved hundreds of kilometers, and in the process it dissolved many minerals from the rock it passed through. When ground water surfaces in low areas containing sediments, water evaporates in the thin atmosphere and leaves behind minerals as deposits and/or cementing agents. Consequently, layers of dust could not later easily erode away since they were cemented together. , Wikiesp 035761 1520layers.jpgLayers in a valley East of Terby Crater, as seen by HiRISE under HiWish program Image:Terby crater .jpgLayers in Terby crater, as seen by HiRISE.

Sometimes craters will display layers. Since the collision that produces a crater is like a powerful explosion, rocks from deep underground are tossed unto the surface. Hence, craters can show us what lies deep under the surface. Image:Schaeberle Crater.JPGSmall crater in Schaeberle Crater, as seen by HiRISE. Image on right is an enlargement of the other image.

Wray, J., et al. 2016. Orbital evidence for more widespread carbonate‚Äêbearing rocks on Mars. Journal of Geophysical Research: Planets: 121, Issue 4 The impact on the rim exposed material that had been dug up from the impact that created Huygens. These minerals represent evidence that Mars once was had a thicker carbon dioxide atmosphere with abundant moisture. These kinds of carbonates only form when there is a lot of water. They were found with the Compact Reconnaissance Imaging Spectrometer for Mars (CRISM) instrument on the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. Earlier, the instrument had detected clay minerals. The carbonates were found near the clay minerals. Both of these minerals form in wet environments. It is supposed that billions of years age Mars was much warmer and wetter. At that time, carbonates would have formed from water and the carbon dioxide-rich atmosphere. Later the deposits of carbonate would have been buried. The double impact has now exposed the minerals. Earth has vast carbonate deposits in the form of limestone. Image:Huygens Crater.jpgHuygens Crater with circle showing place where carbonate was discovered. This deposit may represent a time when Mars had abundant liquid water on its surface. Scale bar is 259 km long. Evidence of rivers There is enormous evidence that water once flowed in river valleys on Mars. Images of curved channels have been seen in images from Mars spacecraft dating back to the early seventies with the Mariner 9 orbiter.Baker, V. 1982. The Channels of Mars. Univ. of Tex.

Comparisons of the hydraulics of water flows in Martian outflow channels with flows of similar scale on Earth. Icarus 37, 156‚Äì181. Vallis (plural valles) is the Latin word for valley. It is used in planetary geology for the naming of landform features on other planets, including what could be old river valleys that were discovered on Mars, when probes were first sent to Mars. The Viking Orbiters caused a revolution in our ideas about water on Mars; huge river valleys were found in many areas. Space craft cameras showed that floods of water broke through dams, carved deep valleys, eroded grooves into bedrock, and traveled thousands of kilometers.Raeburn, P. 1998. Uncovering the Secrets of the Red Planet Mars. National Geographic Society. Washington D.C.Moore, P. et al. 1990. The Atlas of the Solar System. Mitchell Beazley Publishers NY, NY. Some valles on Mars (Mangala Vallis, Athabasca Vallis, Granicus Vallis, and Tinjar Valles) clearly begin at graben. On the other hand, some of the large outflow channels begin in rubble-filled low areas called chaos or chaotic terrain. It has been suggested that massive amounts of water were trapped under pressure beneath a thick cryosphere (layer of frozen ground), then the water was suddenly released, perhaps when the cryosphere was broken by a fault.Carr, M. 1979.

Some of them are barchans. Pictures below show sand dunes in this quadrangle. When there are perfect conditions for producing sand dunes, steady wind in one direction and just enough sand, a barchan sand dune forms. Barchans have a gentle slope on the wind side and a much steeper slope on the lee side where horns or a notch often forms. The whole dune may appear to move with the wind. Observing dunes on Mars can tell us how strong the winds are, as well as their direction. If pictures are taken at regular intervals, one may see changes in the dunes or possibly in ripples on the dune‚Äôs surface. On Mars dunes are often dark in color because they were formed from the common, volcanic rock basalt. In the dry environment, dark minerals in basalt, like olivine and pyroxene, do not break down as they do on Earth. Although rare, some dark sand is found on Hawaii which also has many volcanoes discharging basalt. Barchan is a Russian term because this type of dune was first seen in the desert regions of Turkistan. Some of the wind on Mars is created when the dry ice at the poles is heated in the spring. At that time, the solid carbon dioxide (dry ice) sublimates or changes directly to a gas and rushes away at high speeds. Each Martian year 30% of the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere freezes out and covers the pole that is experiencing winter, so there is a great potential for strong winds.

The central part contains Tyrrhena Patera and the associated ridged plains of Hesperia Planum. The Mare Tyrrhenum quadrangle is one of a series of 30 quadrangle maps of Mars used by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) Astrogeology Research Program. This quadrangle is also referred to as MC-22 (Mars Chart-22).Davies, M.E.; Batson, R.M.; Wu, S.S.C. ‚ÄúGeodesy and Cartography‚Äù in Kieffer, H.H.; Jakosky, B.M.; Snyder, C.W.; Matthews, M.S., Eds. Mars. University of Arizona Press: Tucson, 1992. It contains parts of the regions Tyrrhena Terra, Hesperia Planum, and Terra Cimmeria. The Mare Tyrrhenum quadrangle covers the area from 225¬∞ to 270¬∞ west longitude and 0¬∞ to 30¬∞ south latitude on Mars. Schiaparelli named the area after Earth's Tyrrhenian Sea, which lies between Italy and Sicily. The region was subsequently renamed to Mare Tyrrhena after spacecraft photos revealed that it is an old, cratered plain rather than a sea. It contains the large volcano Tyrrhenus Mons, one of the oldest, and perhaps the most complex volcanoes on Mars.Hartmann, W. 2003. A Traveler's Guide to Mars. Workman Publishing. NY NY.Carr, M. 2007. The surface of Mars. Cambridge University Press. New York. Mare Tyrrhenum's largest crater is Herschel. Licus Vallis and the Ausonia Montes are other major features in the region. Fossa on Mars Large troughs (long narrow depressions) are called fossae in the geographical language used for Mars. Troughs form when the crust is stretched until it breaks. The stretching can be due to the large weight of a nearby volcano. Fossae/pit craters are common near volcanoes in the Tharsis and Elysium system of volcanoes.Skinner, J., L. Skinner, and J. Kargel. 2007. Re- assessment of Hydrovolcanism-based Resurfacing within the Galaxias Fossae Region of Mars. Lunar and Planetary Science XXXVIII (2007) A trough often has two breaks with a middle section moving down, leaving steep cliffs along the sides; such a trough is called a graben.http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/PSP_008641_2105 Lake George, in northern New York State, is a lake that sits in a graben. Studies have found that on Mars a fault may be as deep as 5 km, that is the break in the rock goes down to 5 km. Moreover, the crack or fault sometimes widens or dilates. This widening causes a void to form with a relatively high volume. When material slides into the void, a pit crater or a pit crater chain forms. Pit craters do not have rims or ejecta around them, like impact craters do. On Mars, individual pit craters can join to form chains or even to form troughs that are sometimes scalloped.Wyrick, D., D. Ferrill, D. Sims, and S. Colton. 2003. Distribution, Morphology and Structural Associations of Martian Pit Crater Chains. Lunar and Planetary Science XXXIV (2003) Other ideas have been suggested for the formation of fossae and pit craters. There is evidence that they are associated with dikes of magma. Magma might move along, under the surface, breaking the rock and more importantly melting ice. The resulting action would cause a crack to form at the surface. Pit craters are not common on Earth. Sinkholes, where the ground falls into a hole (sometimes in the middle of a town) resemble pit craters on Mars. However, on the Earth these holes are caused by limestone being dissolved thereby causing a void.http://www.swri.edu/4org/d20/DEMPS/planetgeo/planetmars.htmlhttp://www.msss.com/mars_images/moc/2004/01/29/index.html Tyrrhenus Mons has some beautiful fossae and pit craters associated with it. These features are easily visible in the gallery image below, obtained by HiRISE. Knowledge of the locations and formation mechanisms of pit craters and fossae is important for the future colonization of Mars because they may be reservoirs of water.Ferrill, D., D. Wyrick, A. Morris, D. Sims, and N. Franklin. 2004. Dilational fault slip and pit chain formation on Mars 14:10:4-12 Craters * Auki * Briault * Herschel * Kinkora * M√ºller * Robert Sharp * Resen Importance of craters The density of impact craters is used to determine the surface ages of Mars and other solar system bodies.http://www.lpi.usra.edu/publications/slidesets/stones/ The older the surface, the more craters present. Crater shapes can reveal the presence of ground ice. The area around craters may be rich in minerals. On Mars, heat from the impact melts ice in the ground. Water from the melting ice dissolves minerals, and then deposits them in cracks or faults that were produced with the impact. This process, called hydrothermal alteration, is a major way in which ore deposits are produced. The area around Martian craters may be rich in useful ores for the future colonization of Mars.http://www.indiana.edu/~sierra/papers/2003/Patterson.html.

Research published in Icarus stated that the dunes in Hershel Crater moved 0.8 m in a time span of 3.7 Earth-years. Also, it was determined that dune ripple moved 1.1 m in that time period. Other dunes may exhibit a similar amount of movement.Cardinale, M., S. Silvestro, D. Vazd, T. Michaels, M. Bourke, G. Komatsu, L. Marinangeli. 2016. Present-day aeolian activity in Herschel Crater, Mars. Icarus: 265, 139-148. Hydrothermal features in Auki The crater Auki shows ridge networks that are believed to be evidence of hydrothermal processes that occurred after impact. Impacts fracture rock and create enormous amounts of heat. On Mars, this heat can cause ice to melt and then the resulting water to move through cracks that are generated during impact. This water will eventually deposit minerals. The mineral deposits may become evident when surrounding ground erodes. Deposits formed in this manner are more resistant to erosion. Researchers have speculated that these hydrothermal effects should be common on Mars.Osinski, G., et al. 2013. Impact-generated hydrothermal systems on Earth and Mars. Icarus: 224, 347-363. Ridges found in and around the center of Auki are evidence. This crater contains ridges that may have been produced after fractures formed with an impact. Using instruments on the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter they found the minerals smectite, silica, zeolite, serpentine, carbonate, and chlorite that are common in impact-induced hydrothermal systems on Earth.Carrozzo, F. et al. 2017.

Channels There is enormous evidence that water once flowed in river valleys and channels on Mars. Images of curved channels have been seen in images from Mars spacecraft dating back to the early seventies with the Mariner 9 orbiter.Baker, V. 1982. The Channels of Mars. Univ. of Tex. Press, Austin, TXBaker, V., R. Strom, R., V. Gulick, J. Kargel, G. Komatsu, V. Kale. 1991. Ancient oceans, ice sheets and the hydrological cycle on Mars. Nature 352, 589‚Äì594.Carr, M. 1979.

Comparisons of the hydraulics of water flows in Martian outflow channels with flows of similar scale on Earth. Icarus 37, 156‚Äì181. Vallis (plural valles) is the Latin word for valley. It is used in planetary geology for the naming of landform features on other planets, including what could be old river valleys that were discovered on Mars, when probes were first sent to Mars. The Viking Orbiters caused a revolution in our ideas about water on Mars; huge river valleys were found in many areas. Space craft cameras showed that floods of water broke through dams, carved deep valleys, eroded grooves into bedrock, and traveled thousands of kilometers.Raeburn, P. 1998. Uncovering the Secrets of the Red Planet Mars. National Geographic Society. Washington D.C.Moore, P. et al. 1990. The Atlas of the Solar System. Mitchell Beazley Publishers NY, NY. Some valles on Mars (Mangala Vallis, Athabasca Vallis, Granicus Vallis, and Tinjar Valles) clearly begin at graben. On the other hand, some of the large outflow channels begin in rubble-filled low areas called chaos or chaotic terrain. It has been suggested that massive amounts of water were trapped under pressure beneath a thick cryosphere (layer of frozen ground), then the water was suddenly released, perhaps when the cryosphere was broken by a fault.Carr, M. 1979. Formation of martian flood features by release of water from confined aquifers. J. Geophys. Res. 84: 2995-3007.Hanna, J. and R. Phillips. 2005.

Linear ridge networks Linear ridge networks are found in various places on Mars in and around craters.Head, J., J. Mustard. 2006. Breccia dikes and crater-related faults in impact craters on Mars: Erosion and exposure on the floor of a crater 75 km in diameter at the dichotomy boundary, Meteorit. Planet Science: 41, 1675-1690. Ridges often appear as mostly straight segments that intersect in a lattice-like manner. They are hundreds of meters long, tens of meters high, and several meters wide. It is thought that impacts created fractures in the surface, these fractures later acted as channels for fluids. Fluids cemented the structures. With the passage of time, surrounding material was eroded away, thereby leaving hard ridges behind. Since the ridges occur in locations with clay, these formations could serve as a marker for clay which requires water for its formation.Mangold et al. 2007. Mineralogy of the Nili Fossae region with OMEGA/Mars Express data: 2. Aqueous alteration of the crust. J. Geophys. Res., 112, doi:10.1029/2006JE002835.Mustard et al., 2007.

Dunes Sand dunes have been found in many places on Mars. The presence of dunes shows that the planet has an atmosphere with wind, for dunes require wind to pile up the sand. Most dunes on Mars are black because of the weathering of the volcanic rock basalt.http://hirise.lpl.arizona.edu/ESP_016459_1830 Black sand can be found on Earth on Hawaii and on some tropical South Pacific islands.https://www.desertusa.com/desert-activity/sand-dune-wind1.html Sand is common on Mars due to the old age of the surface that has allowed rocks to erode into sand. Dunes on Mars have been observed to move many meters.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ur_TeOs3S64https://uanews.arizona.edu/story/the- flowing-sands-of-mars Some dunes move along. In this process, sand moves up the windward side and then falls down the leeward side of the dune, thus caused the dune to go toward the leeward side (or slip face).Namowitz, S., Stone, D. 1975. earth science the world we live in. American Book Company. New York. When images are enlarged, some dunes on Mars display ripples on their surfaces.https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=6551 These are caused by sand grains rolling and bouncing up the windward surface of a dune. The bouncing grains tend to land on the windward side of each ripple. The grains do not bounce very high so it does not take much to stop them.

The inverted former stream channels may be caused by the deposition of large rocks or due to cementation. In either case erosion would erode the surrounding land but leave the old channel as a raised ridge because the ridge will be more resistant to erosion Yardangs are another feature found in this quadrangle. They are generally visible as a series of parallel linear ridges, caused by the direction of the prevailing wind.  Spirit rover discoveries  The rocks on the plains of Gusev are a type of basalt. They contain the minerals olivine, pyroxene, plagioclase, and magnetite, and they look like volcanic basalt as they are fine-grained with irregular holes (geologists would say they have vesicles and vugs). Much of the soil on the plains came from the breakdown of the local rocks. Fairly high levels of nickel were found in some soils; probably from meteorites. Analysis shows that the rocks have been slightly altered by tiny amounts of water. Outside coatings and cracks inside the rocks suggest water deposited minerals, maybe bromine compounds. All the rocks contain a fine coating of dust and one or more harder kinds of material. One type can be brushed off, while another needed to be ground off by the Rock Abrasion Tool (RAT). An overall view of MER-A Spirit landing site (denoted with a star) There are a variety of rocks in the Columbia Hills (Mars), some of which have been altered by water, but not by very much water. The dust in Gusev Crater is the same as dust all around the planet. All the dust was found to be magnetic. Moreover, Spirit found the magnetism was caused by the mineral magnetite, especially magnetite that contained the element titanium. One magnet was able to completely divert all dust hence all Martian dust is thought to be magnetic.Bertelsen, P., et al. 2004. \\"Magnetic Properties on the Mars Exploration Rover Spirit at Gusev Crater\\". Science: 305. 827‚Äì829 The spectra of the dust was similar to spectra of bright, low thermal inertia regions like Tharsis and Arabia that have been detected by orbiting satellites. A thin layer of dust, maybe less than one millimeter thick covers all surfaces. Something in it contains a small amount of chemically bound water.Bell, J (ed.) The Martian Surface. 2008. Cambridge University Press. Gelbert, R. et al. \\"Chemistry of Rocks and Soils in Gusev Crater from the Alpha Particle X-ray Spectrometer\\". Science: 305. 829-305 Plains Observations of rocks on the plains show they contain the minerals pyroxene, olivine, plagioclase, and magnetite. These rocks can be classified in different ways. The amounts and types of minerals make the rocks primitive basalts‚Äîalso called picritic basalts. The rocks are similar to ancient terrestrial rocks called basaltic komatiites. Rocks of the plains also resemble the basaltic shergottites, meteorites which came from Mars. One classification system compares the amount of alkali elements to the amount of silica on a graph; in this system, Gusev plains rocks lie near the junction of basalt, picrobasalt, and tephite. The Irvine-Barager classification calls them basalts.McSween, etal. 2004. \\"Basaltic Rocks Analyzed by the Spirit Rover in Gusev Crater\\". Science : 305. 842‚Äì845 Plain‚Äôs rocks have been very slightly altered, probably by thin films of water because they are softer and contain veins of light colored material that may be bromine compounds, as well as coatings or rinds. It is thought that small amounts of water may have gotten into cracks inducing mineralization processes. Coatings on the rocks may have occurred when rocks were buried and interacted with thin films of water and dust. One sign that they were altered was that it was easier to grind these rocks compared to the same types of rocks found on Earth. The first rock that Spirit studied was Adirondack. It turned out to be typical of the other rocks on the plains. Image:Spirit's First Color Photograph Mars.jpgFirst color picture from Gusev crater. Rocks were found to be basalt. Everything was covered with a fine dust that Spirit determined was magnetic because of the mineral magnetite. Image:Rockgusev.jpgCross-sectional drawing of a typical rock from the plains of Gusev crater. Most rocks contain a coating of dust and one or more harder coatings. Veins of water-deposited veins are visible, along with crystals of olivine. Veins may contain bromine salts. Columbia Hills Scientists found a variety of rock types in the Columbia Hills, and they placed them into six different categories. The six are: Clovis, Wishbone, Peace, Watchtower, Backstay, and Independence. They are named after a prominent rock in each group. Their chemical compositions, as measured by APXS, are significantly different from each other.Squyres, S., et al. 2006 Rocks of the Columbia Hills. J. Geophys. Res. Planets. 111 Most importantly, all of the rocks in Columbia Hills show various degrees of alteration due to aqueous fluids.Ming,D., et al. 2006 Geochemical and mineralogical indicators for aqueous processes in the Columbia Hills of Gusev crater, Mars. J. Geophys: Res.111 They are enriched in the elements phosphorus, sulfur, chlorine, and bromine‚Äîall of which can be carried around in water solutions. The Columbia Hills‚Äô rocks contain basaltic glass, along with varying amounts of olivine and sulfates.Schroder, C., et al. (2005) European Geosciences Union, General Assembly, Geophysical Research abstr., Vol. 7, 10254, 2005Christensen, P.R. (2005) Mineral Composition and Abundance of the Rocks and Soils at Gusev and Meridiani from the Mars Exploration Rover Mini-TES Instruments AGU Joint Assembly, 23‚Äì27 May 2005 http://www.agu.org/meetings/sm05/waissm05.html The olivine abundance varies inversely with the amount of sulfates. This is exactly what is expected because water destroys olivine but helps to produce sulfates. Acid fog is believed to have changed some of the Watchtower rocks. This was in a 200 meter long section of Cumberland Ridge and the Husband Hill summit. Certain places became less crystalline and more amorphous. Acidic water vapor from volcanoes dissolved some minerals forming a gel. When water evaporated, a cement formed and produced small bumps. This type of process has been observed in the lab when basalt rocks are exposed to sulfuric and hydrochloric acids.COLE, Shoshanna B., et al. 2015. IN-SITU EVIDENCE FOR ALTERATION BY ACID FOG ON HUSBAND HILL, GUSEV CRATER, MARS. 2015 GSA Annual Meeting in Baltimore, Maryland, USA (1‚Äì4 November 2015) Paper No. 94-10 The Clovis group is especially interesting because the M√∂ssbauer spectrometer(MB) detected goethite in it.Klingelhofer, G., et al. (2005) Lunar Planet. Sci. XXXVI abstr. 2349 Goethite forms only in the presence of water, so its discovery is the first direct evidence of past water in the Columbia Hills's rocks. In addition, the MB spectra of rocks and outcrops displayed a strong decline in olivine presence, although the rocks probably once contained much olivine.Morris,S., et al. Mossbauer mineralogy of rock, soil, and dust at Gusev crater, Mars: Spirit‚Äôs journal through weakly altered olivine basalt on the plains and pervasively altered basalt in the Columbia Hills. J. Geophys. Res.: 111 Olivine is a marker for the lack of water because it easily decomposes in the presence of water. Sulfate was found, and it needs water to form. Wishstone contained a great deal of plagioclase, some olivine, and anhydrate (a sulfate). Peace rocks showed sulfur and strong evidence for bound water, so hydrated sulfates are suspected. Watchtower class rocks lack olivine consequently they may have been altered by water. The Independence class showed some signs of clay (perhaps montmorillonite a member of the smectite group). Clays require fairly long term exposure to water to form. One type of soil, called Paso Robles, from the Columbia Hills, may be an evaporate deposit because it contains large amounts of sulfur, phosphorus, calcium, and iron.Ming,D., et al. 2006 Geochemical and mineralogical indicators for aqueous processes in the Columbia Hills of Gusev crater, Mars. J. Geophys. Res.111 Also, MB found that much of the iron in Paso Robles soil was of the oxidized, Fe+++ form, which would happen if water had been present. Towards the middle of the six-year mission (a mission that was supposed to last only 90 days), large amounts of pure silica were found in the soil. The silica could have come from the interaction of soil with acid vapors produced by volcanic activity in the presence of water or from water in a hot spring environment. After Spirit stopped working scientists studied old data from the Miniature Thermal Emission Spectrometer, or Mini-TES and confirmed the presence of large amounts of carbonate-rich rocks, which means that regions of the planet may have once harbored water. The carbonates were discovered in an outcrop of rocks called \\"Comanche.\\" In summary, Spirit found evidence of slight weathering on the plains of Gusev, but no evidence that a lake was there. However, in the Columbia Hills there was clear evidence for a moderate amount of aqueous weathering. The evidence included sulfates and the minerals goethite and carbonates which only form in the presence of water. It is believed that Gusev crater may have held a lake long ago, but it has since been covered by igneous materials. All the dust contains a magnetic component which was identified as magnetite with some titanium. Furthermore, the thin coating of dust that covers everything on Mars is the same in all parts of Mars. Ma'adim Vallis A large, ancient river valley, called Ma'adim Vallis, enters at the south rim of Gusev Crater, so Gusev Crater was believed to be an ancient lake bed. However, it seems that a volcanic flow covered up the lakebed sediments. Apollinaris Patera, a large volcano, lies directly north of Gusev Crater. Recent studies lead scientists to believe that the water that formed Ma'adim Vallis originated in a complex of lakes.Cabrol, N. and E. Grin (eds.). 2010. Lakes on Mars. Elsevier. NY. The largest lake is located at the source of the Ma'adim Vallis outflow channel and extends into Eridania quadrangle and the Phaethontis quadrangle. When the largest lake spilled over the low point in its boundary, a torrential flood would have moved north, carving the sinuous Ma'adim Vallis. At the north end of Ma'adim Vallis, the flood waters would have run into Gusev Crater. There is enormous evidence that water once flowed in river valleys on Mars. Images of curved channels have been seen in images from Mars spacecraft dating back to the early seventies with the Mariner 9 orbiter.Baker, V. 1982. The Channels of Mars. Univ. of Tex. Press, Austin, TX Vallis (plural valles) is the Latin word for \\"valley\\". It is used in planetary geology for the naming of landform features on other planets, including what could be old river valleys that were discovered on Mars, when probes were first sent to Mars. The Viking Orbiters caused a revolution in our ideas about water on Mars; huge river valleys were found in many areas. Space craft cameras showed that floods of water broke through dams, carved deep valleys, eroded grooves into bedrock, and traveled thousands of kilometers.Raeburn, P. 1998. Uncovering the Secrets of the Red Planet Mars. National Geographic Society. Washington D.C.Moore, P. et al. 1990. The Atlas of the Solar System. Mitchell Beazley Publishers NY, NY. Some valles on Mars (Mangala Vallis, Athabasca Vallis, Granicus Vallis, and Tinjar Valles) clearly begin at graben. On the other hand, some of the large outflow channels begin in rubble-filled low areas called chaos or chaotic terrain. It has been suggested that massive amounts of water were trapped under pressure beneath a thick cryosphere (layer of frozen ground), then the water was suddenly released, perhaps when the cryosphere was broken by a fault.Hanna, J. and R. Phillips. 2005. Tectonic pressurization of aquifers in the formation of Mangala and Athabasca Valles on Mars. LPSC XXXVI. Abstract 2261. Image:Maadim Vallis.JPGSection of Ma'adim Vallis as seen by HiRISE A more recent flow of water may have formed the smaller, deeper channel to the right. Image:Apollinaris Patera (PIA02006).jpgApollinaris Patera  Gale Crater  Gale Crater, in the northwestern part of the Aeolis quadrangle, is of special interest to geologists because it contains a 2‚Äì4 km (1.2‚Äì2.5 mile) high mound of layered sedimentary rocks. On 28 March 2012 this mound was named \\"Mount Sharp\\" by NASA in honor of Robert P. Sharp (1911‚Äì2004), a planetary scientist of early Mars missions. More recently, on 16 May 2012, Mount Sharp was officially named Aeolis Mons by the USGS and IAU. The mound extends higher than the rim of the crater, so perhaps the layering covered an area much larger than the crater. These layers are a complex record of the past. The rock layers probably took millions of years to be laid down within the crater, then more time to be eroded to make them visible. The 5 km high mound is probably the thickest single succession of sedimentary rocks on Mars. The lower formation may date from near the Noachian age, while the upper layer, separated by an erosional unconformity, may be as young as the Amazonian period. The lower formation may have formed the same time as parts of Sinus Meridiani and Mawrth Vallis. The mound that lies in the center of Gale Crater was created by winds. Because the winds eroded the mound on one side more than another, the mound is skewed to one side, rather than being symmetrical. The upper layer may be similar to layers in Arabia Terra. Sulfates and Iron oxides have been detected in the lower formation and anhydrous phases in the upper layer.Grotzinger, J. and R. Milliken. 2012. Sedimentary Geology of Mars. SEPM. There is evidence that the first phase of erosion was followed by more cratering and more rock formation. Also of interest in Gale Crater is Peace Vallis, officially named by the IAU on September 26, 2012, which 'flows' down out of the Gale Crater hills to the Aeolis Palus below, and which seems to have been carved by flowing water. On December 9, 2013, NASA reported that, based on evidence from Curiosity studying Aeolis Palus, Gale Crater contained an ancient freshwater lake which could have been a hospitable environment for microbial life. Gale Crater contains a number of fans and deltas that provide information about lake levels in the past. These formations are: Pancake Delta, Western Delta, Farah Vallis delta and the Peace Vallis Fan.Dietrich, W., M. Palucis, T. Parker, D. Rubin, K.Lewis, D. Sumner, R. Williams. 2014.

As craters get larger (greater than 10 km in diameter) they usually have a central peak. The peak is caused by a rebound of the crater floor following the impact. Sometimes craters will display layers. Since the collision that produces a crater is like a powerful explosion, rocks from deep underground are tossed onto the surface. Hence, craters can show us what lies deep under the surface. Image:Boeddicker Crater Floor.JPGBoeddicker Crater Floor, as seen by HiRISE.

Mars Science Laboratory discoveries  The aim of the Mars Science Laboratory mission, and its surface robotic payload Curiosity rover, is to search for signs of ancient life. It is hoped that a later mission could then return samples that the laboratory identified as probably containing remains of life. To safely bring the craft down, a 12 mile wide, smooth, flat circle was needed. Geologists hoped to examine places where water once ponded and to examine sedimentary layers. On August 6, 2012, the Mars Science Laboratory landed on Aeolis Palus near Aeolis Mons in Gale Crater. The landing was from the target (), closer than any previous rover landing and well within the target area. On September 27, 2012, NASA scientists announced that Curiosity found evidence for an ancient streambed suggesting a \\"vigorous flow\\" of water on Mars. Sheepbed\\" mudstone (lower left) and surroundings (February 14, 2013). On October 17, 2012, at Rocknest, the first X-ray diffraction analysis of Martian soil was performed. The results revealed the presence of several minerals, including feldspar, pyroxenes and olivine, and suggested that the Martian soil in the sample was similar to the weathered basaltic soils of Hawaiian volcanoes. The sample used is composed of dust distributed from global dust storms and local fine sand. So far, the materials Curiosity has analyzed are consistent with the initial ideas of deposits in Gale Crater recording a transition through time from a wet to dry environment. On December 3, 2012, NASA reported that Curiosity performed its first extensive soil analysis, revealing the presence of water molecules, sulfur and chlorine in the Martian soil. The presence of perchlorates in the sample seems highly likely. The presence of sulfate and sulfide is also likely because sulfur dioxide and hydrogen sulfide were detected. Small amounts of chloromethane, dichloromethane and trichloromethane were detected. The source of the carbon in these molecules is unclear. Possible sources include contamination of the instrument, organics in the sample and inorganic carbonates. Scarp retreat by windblown sand over time on Mars (Yellowknife Bay, December 9, 2013). On March 18, 2013, NASA reported evidence of mineral hydration, likely hydrated calcium sulfate, in several rock samples including the broken fragments of \\"Tintina\\" rock and \\"Sutton Inlier\\" rock as well as in veins and nodules in other rocks like \\"Knorr\\" rock and \\"Wernicke\\" rock. Analysis using the rover's DAN instrument provided evidence of subsurface water, amounting to as much as 4% water content, down to a depth of , in the rover's traverse from the Bradbury Landing site to the Yellowknife Bay area in the Glenelg terrain. In March 2013, NASA reported Curiosity found evidence that geochemical conditions in Gale Crater were once suitable for microbial life after analyzing the first drilled sample of Martian rock, \\"John Klein\\" rock at Yellowknife Bay in Gale Crater. The rover detected water, carbon dioxide, oxygen, sulfur dioxide and hydrogen sulfide. Chloromethane and dichloromethane were also detected. Related tests found results consistent with the presence of smectite clay minerals. In the journal Science from September 2013, researchers described a different type of rock called \\"Jake M\\" or \\"Jake Matijevic (rock),‚Äù It was the first rock analyzed by the Alpha Particle X-ray Spectrometer instrument on the Curiosity rover, and it was different from other known martian igneous rocks as it is alkaline (>15% normative nepheline) and relatively fractionated. Jake M is similar to terrestrial mugearites, a rock type typically found at ocean islands and continental rifts. Jake M's discovery may mean that alkaline magmas may be more common on Mars than on Earth and that Curiosity could encounter even more fractionated alkaline rocks (for example, phonolites and trachytes). On December 9, 2013, NASA researchers described, in a series of six articles in the journal Science, many new discoveries from the Curiosity rover. Possible organics were found that could not be explained by contamination. Although the organic carbon was probably from Mars, it can all be explained by dust and meteorites that have landed on the planet. Because much of the carbon was released at a relatively low temperature in Curiositys Sample Analysis at Mars (SAM) instrument package, it probably did not come from carbonates in the sample. The carbon could be from organisms, but this has not been proven. This organic-bearing material was obtained by drilling 5 centimeters deep in a site called Yellowknife Bay into a rock called ‚ÄúSheepbed mudstone‚Äù. The samples were named John Klein and Cumberland. Microbes could be living on Mars by obtaining energy from chemical imbalances between minerals in a process called chemolithotrophy which means ‚Äúeating rock.‚Äù However, in this process only a very tiny amount of carbon is involved ‚Äî much less than was found at Yellowknife Bay. Using SAM‚Äôs mass spectrometer, scientists measured isotopes of helium, neon, and argon that cosmic rays produce as they go through rock. The fewer of these isotopes they find, the more recently the rock has been exposed near the surface. The four-billion-year-old lakebed rock drilled by Curiosity was uncovered between 30 million and 110 million years ago by winds which sandblasted away two meters of overlying rock. Next, they hope to find a site tens of millions of years younger by drilling close to an overhanging outcrop. The absorbed dose and dose equivalent from galactic cosmic rays and solar energetic particles on the Martian surface for ~300 days of observations during the current solar maximum was measured. These measurements are necessary for human missions to the surface of Mars, to provide microbial survival times of any possible extant or past life, and to determine how long potential organic biosignatures can be preserved. This study estimates that a one-meter depth drill is necessary to access possible viable radioresistant microbe cells. The actual absorbed dose measured by the Radiation Assessment Detector (RAD) is 76 mGy/yr at the surface. Based on these measurements, for a round trip Mars surface mission with 180 days (each way) cruise, and 500 days on the Martian surface for this current solar cycle, an astronaut would be exposed to a total mission dose equivalent of ~1.01 sievert. Exposure to one sievert is associated with a five percent increase in risk for developing fatal cancer. NASA's current lifetime limit for increased risk for its astronauts operating in low-Earth orbit is three percent. Maximum shielding from galactic cosmic rays can be obtained with about 3 meters of Martian soil. The samples examined were probably once mud that for millions to tens of millions of years could have hosted living organisms. This wet environment had neutral pH, low salinity, and variable redox states of both iron and sulfur species. These types of iron and sulfur could have been used by living organisms. C, H, O, S, N, and P were measured directly as key biogenic elements, and by inference, P is assumed to have been there as well. The two samples, John Klein and Cumberland, contain basaltic minerals, Ca- sulfates, Fe oxide/hydroxides, Fe-sulfides, amorphous material, and trioctahedral smectites (a type of clay). Basaltic minerals in the mudstone are similar to those in nearby aeolian deposits. However, the mudstone has far less Fe-forsterite plus magnetite, so Fe-forsterite (type of olivine) was probably altered to form smectite (a type of clay) and magnetite. A Late Noachian/EarlyHesperian or younger age indicates that clay mineral formation on Mars extended beyond Noachian time; therefore, in this location neutral pH lasted longer than previously thought. In a press conference on December 8, 2014, Mars scientists discussed observations by Curiosity rover that show Mars' Mount Sharp was built by sediments deposited in a large lake bed over tens of millions of years. This finding suggests the climate of ancient Mars could have produced long-lasting lakes at many places on the Planet. Rock layers indicate that a huge lake was filled and evaporated many times. The evidence was many deltas that were stacked upon each other. Also in December 2014, it was announced that Curiosity had detected sharp increases in methane four times out of twelve during a 20-month period with the Tunable Laser Spectrometer (TLS) of the Sample Analysis at Mars instrument (SAM). Methane levels were ten times the usual amount. Due to the temporary nature of the methane spike, researchers believe the source is localized. The source may be biological or non-biological.Webster1, C. et al. 2014. Mars methane detection and variability at Gale crate. Science. 1261713 On December 16, 2014, a team of researchers described how they have concluded that organic compounds have been found on Mars by Curiosity. The compounds were found in samples from drilling into Sheepbed mudstone. Chlorobenzene and several dichloroalkanes, such as dichloroethane, dichloropropane and dichlorobutane were discovered in the samples. On March 24, 2015, a paper was released describing the discovery of nitrates in three samples analyzed by Curiosity. The nitrates are believed to have been created from diatomic nitrogen in the atmosphere during meteorite impacts. Nitrogen is needed for all forms of life because it is used in the building blocks of larger molecules like DNA and RNA. Nitrates contain nitrogen in a form that can be used by living organisms; nitrogen in the air can not be used by organisms. This discovery of nitrates adds to the evidence that Mars once had life. The Jet Propulsion Laboratory announced in April 2015 the discovery of a network of two-tone mineral veins at an area called \\"Garden City\\" on lower Mount Sharp. The veins stand about 2.5 inches above the surface and are composed of two different minerals formed from at least two different fluid flows. In Pahrump Hills, an area about 39 feet lower, the minerals clay, hematite, jarosite, quartz, and cristobalite were found. Measurements made by Curiosity allowed researchers to determine that Mars has liquid water at times. Because the humidity goes to 100% at night, salts, like calcium perchlorate, will absorb water from the air and form a brine in the soil. This process in which a salt absorbs water from the air is called deliquescence. Liquid water results even though the temperature is very low, as salts lower the freezing point of water. This principle is used when salt is spread on roads to melt snow/ice. The liquid brine produced in the night evaporates after sunrise. Much more liquid water is expected in higher latitudes where the colder temperature and more water vapor can result in higher levels of humidity more often.University of Copenhagen ‚Äì Niels Bohr Institute. \\"Mars might have salty liquid water.\\" ScienceDaily. ScienceDaily, 13 April 2015. . The researchers cautioned that the amount of water was not enough to support life, but it could allow salts to move around in the soil. The brines would occur mostly in the upper 5 cm of the surface; however, there is evidence that the effects of liquid water can be detected down to 15 cm. Chlorine-bearing brines are corrosive; therefore design changes may need to be made for future landers.Martin-Torre, F. et al. 2015. Transient liquid water and water activity at Gale crater on Mars. Nature geoscienceDOI:10.1038/NGEO2412 French and U.S. scientists found a type of granite by studying images and chemical results of 22 rock fragments. The composition of the rocks was determined with the ChemCam instrument. These pale rocks are rich in feldspar and may contain some quartz. The rocks are similar to Earth's granitic continental crust. They are like rocks called TTG (Tonalite-Trondhjemite-Granodiorite). On the Earth, TTG was common in the terrestrial continental crust in the Archean era (more than 2.5 billion years ago). By landing in Gale crater, Curiosity was able to sample a variety of rocks because the crater dug deep into the crust, thus exposing old rocks, some of which may be about 3.6 billion years old. For many years, Mars was thought to be composed of the dark, igneous rock basalt, so this is a significant discovery. On October 8, 2015, a large team of scientists confirmed the existence of long-lasting lakes in Gale Crater. The conclusion of Gale having lakes was based on evidence of old streams with coarser gravel in addition to places where streams appear to have emptied out into bodies of standing water. If lakes were once present, Curiosity would start seeing water-deposited, fine-grained rocks closer to Mount Sharp. That is exactly what happened. Finely laminated mudstones were discovered by Curiosity; this lamination represents the settling of plumes of fine sediment through a standing body of water. Sediment deposited in a lake formed the lower portion of Mount Sharp, the mountain in Gale crater.http://astrobiology.com/2015/10/wet-paleoclimate-of-mars-revealed-by- ancient-lakes-at-gale-crater.html> At a press conference in San Francisco at the American Geophysical Union meeting, a group of scientists told of a discovery of very high concentrations of silica at some sites, along with the first ever discovery of a silica mineral called tridymite. The scientific team believes that water was involved with putting the silica in place. Acidic water would tend transport other ingredients away and leave silica behind, whereas alkaline or neutral water could carry in dissolved silica that would be deposited. This finding used measurements from ChemCam, the Alpha Particle X-ray Spectrometeter (APXS), and the Chemistry and Mineralogy (CheMin) instrument inside the rover. Tridymite was found in a rock named \\"Buckskin.\\"DOE/Los Alamos National Laboratory. \\"New Mars rover findings revealed: Much higher concentrations of silica indicate 'considerable water activity'.\\" ScienceDaily. ScienceDaily, 17 December 2015. . ChemCam and APXS measurements displayed high silica in pale zones along fractures in the bedrock beyond Marias Pass; hence silica may have been deposited by fluids that flowed through the fractures. CheMin found high silica levels in drilled material from a target called \\"Big Sky\\" and in another rock called \\"Greenhorn.\\" As of the beginning of 2016, Curiosity had discovered seven hydrous minerals. The minerals are actinolite, montmorillonite, saponite, jarosite, halloysite, szomolnokite and magnesite. In some places the total concentration of all hydrous minerals was 40 vol%. Hydrous minerals help us understand the early water environment and possible biology on Mars. By using Curiositys laser-firing device (ChemCam), scientists found manganese oxides in mineral veins in the \\"Kimberley\\" region of Gale Crater. These minerals need lots of water and oxidizing conditions to form; hence this discovery points to a water-rich, oxygen-rich past.NASA/Jet Propulsion Laboratory. \\"NASA rover findings point to a more Earth-like Martian past.\\" ScienceDaily. ScienceDaily, 27 June 2016. . A study of the kinds of minerals in veins examined with Curiosity found that evaporating lakes were present in the past in Gale crater. The Sheepbed Member mudstones of Yellowknife Bay (YKB) were examined in this research. Frost probably has formed in three locations in the first 1000 sols of the mission of the Curiosity exploration according to research published in Icarus in 2016. This frost can cause weathering. Frost formation can explain the widespread detection of hydrated materials from orbit with the OMEGA instrument; it also can explain the hydrated component measured by Curiosity in Martian soil. Researchers in December 2016 announced the discovery of the element boron by Curiosity in mineral veins. For boron to be present there must have been a temperature between 0‚Äì60 degrees Celsius and a neutral-to-alkaline pH.\\" The temperature, pH, and dissolved minerals of the groundwater support a habitable environment. Moreover, boron has been suggested to be necessary for life to form. Its presence stabilizes the sugar ribose which is an ingredient in RNA. Details of the discovery of Boron on Mars were given in a paper written by a large number of researchers and published in Geophysical Research Letters. Researchers have concluded that Gale Crater has experienced many episodes of groundwater with changes in the groundwater chemistry. These chemical changes would support life.L'Haridon, J., N.

In January, 2017, JPL scientists announced the discovery of mud cracks on Mars. This find adds more evidence that Gale Crater was wet in the past.Stein, N., et al. 2018. Desiccation cracks provide evidence of lake drying on Mars, Sutton Island member, Murray formation, Gale Crate. Geology (2018) DOI: https://doi.org/10.1130/G40005.1 Wikimudcracksdensevarious.jpgProbable mud cracks appearing as ridges, as seen by Curiosity Rover. Studies of the wind around the Curiosity rover over a period of 3 billion years has shown that the Mount Sharp, the mound inside Gale Crater was created when winds removed material over billions of years and left material in the middle that is Mount Sharp. The researchers calculated that about 15,000 cubic miles (64,000 cubic kilometers) of material was removed from the crater. Curiosity has seen dust devils in action in the distance. Also, changes were visible as a dust devil passed close to the Rover. Ripples in the sand below Curiosity were observed to move about one inch (2.5 cm) in just one day.Day, M., G. Kocurek. 2017. Observations of an aeolian landscape: From surface to orbit in Gale Crater. Icarus. 10.1016/j.icarus.2015.09.042 CheMin found feldspar, mafic igneous minerals, iron oxides, crystalline silica, phyllosilicates, sulfate minerals in mudstone of Gale Crater. Some of the trends in these minerals at different levels suggested that at least part of the time the lake had near-neutral pH.Bristow T. F. et al. 2015 Am. Min., 100.Rampe, E., et al. 2017. MINERAL TRENDS IN EARLY HESPERIAN LACUSTRINE MUDSTONE AT GALE CRATER, MARS. Lunar and Planetary Science XLVIII (2017). 2821pdf An analysis of a large amount of data from ChemCam and APXS showed that most of the material encountered by Curiosity consists of just two major igneous rock types and traces of three others. One chief type is classified as a subalkaline, Mg-rich basalt (similar to MER Spirit basalt) and the other was a more evolved, higher Si, Al, lower Mg basalt.Bridges, C., et al. 2017. THE IGNEOUS END MEMBER COMPOSITIONS PRESERVED IN GALE CRATER SEDIMENTS. Lunar and Planetary Science XLVIII (2017). 2504.pdf A large group of researchers discovered halos around fractures that they water existed in the ground long after water disappeared from Gale crater. Groundwater, carrying dissolved silica, moved in fractures and deposited silica there. This silica enrichment went across young and old rocks. Halopicture4.jpgFractures that went through both Murray mudstone and Stimson sandstone layers had silica deposited in them (shown in left drawing). After erosion removed most of Stimson layer, halos were found around the fractures by the Curiosity rover. Because the Stimson was formed after the lake disappeared, water must have been in the ground for a long time after the lake dried up. Research of chemicals in layers in Gale Crater, published in 2017, suggest that the lake in Gale Crater had a neutral pH for much of the time. The mudstone in the Murray formation at the base of Mount Sharp indicated deposition in a lake environment. After the layers were deposited, an acid solution may have moved through the rock, which contained olivine and pyroxene, dissolving some minerals like magnetite and forming new ones like hematite and jarosite. The elements magnesium (Mg), Iron (Fe), Manganese (Mn), Nickel (Ni), and Zinc (Zn) were carried down. Eventually, Ni, Zn, and Mn coated (adsorbed onto) clay particles. Iron-oxides, Mg, and Sulfur produced sulfates. The Murray formation was sampled at several locations for this research: Confidence Hills, Mojave 2, Telegraph peak, and Buckskin. Research presented in a June 2018 press conference described the detection of more organic molecules in a drill sample analyzed by Curiosity. Some of the organic molecules found were thiophenes, benzene, toluene, and small carbon chains, such as propane or butane. At least 50 nanomoles of organic carbon are still in the sample, but were not specifically determined. The remaining organic material probably exists as macromolecules organic sulfur molecules. Organic matter was from lacustrine mudstones at the base of the ~3.5-billion-year-old Murray formation at Pahrump Hills, by the Sample Analysis at Mars instrument suite. With two full Martian years (five Earth years) of measurements, scientists found that the annual average concentration of methane in Mars‚Äô atmosphere is 0.41 ppb. However, methane levels rise and fall with the seasons, going from 0.24 ppb in winter to 0.65 ppb in summer. The researchers also saw relatively large methane spikes, up to about 7 ppb, at random intervals. The existence of methane in the Martian atmosphere is exciting because on Earth, most methane is produced by living organisms. Methane on Mars does not prove that life exists there, but it is consistent with life. Ultraviolet radiation from the sun destroys methane doesn‚Äôt last long; consequently, something must have been creating or releasing it. Using date gathered with Mastcam, a team of researchers have found what they believe to be iron meteorites. These meteorites stand out in multispectral observations as not possessing the usual ferrous or ferric absorption features as the surrounding surface.Wellington, D., et al. 2018.

Chichester, UK Research presented in 2018 at the Geological Society of America Annual Meeting in Indianapolis, Indiana described evidence for huge floods in Gale Crater. One rock unit examined by Curiosity contains the rock conglomerate with particles up to 20 centimeters across. To create such a type of rock water must have been 10 to 20 meters in depth.

The authors stated, \\"Mount Sharp formed largely in its current form as a free-standing mound within Gale.\\"http://science.sciencemag.org/content/363/6426/535.full?ijkey=xakdRhWj7CWEE&keytype;=ref&siteid;=sci One idea was that it was part of material that covered a wide region and then eroded, leaving Mount Sharp. However, if that were the case, the layers on the bottom would be fairly dense. This gravity data show that the bottom layers are quite porous. Had they been under many layers of rock they would be compressed and be more dense. Intensity of the gravity was obtained by using data from Curiositys accelerometers.https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=7323http://science.sciencemag.org/content/363/6426/535.abstract?ijkey=xakdRhWj7CWEE&keytype;=ref&siteid;=sciLewis, K., et al. 2019. A surface gravity traverse on Mars indicates low bedrock density at Gale crater. Science: 363, 535-537. Researched published in nature Geoscience in October 2019, described how Gale crater underwent many wet and dry cycles as its lake waters disappeared.https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?feature=7514 Sulfate salts from evaporated water showed that pools of salty water once existed in Gale Cater. These ponds could have supported organisms. Basalts could have produced the calcium and magnesium sulfates that were found. Because of its low solubility, calcium sulfate is deposited early on as a lake dries up. However, the discovery of magnesium sulfate salts means that the lake must have almost totally evaporated. The remaining pools of water would have been very salty‚Äîsuch lakes on Earth contain organisms that are salt tolerant or \\"halotolerant.\\"These minerals were found along the edges of what were lakes in the younger parts of Gale Crater.https://www.sciencealert.com/the-mars-gale- crater-may-have-once-held-a-sloshing-salty-lake-3-3-to-3-7-billion-years-ago When Curiosity was exploring deeper in the crater, clays found there showed that a lake existed for a long time, these new findings of sulfates the lake dried up and then get wetter over and over. Sulfate salts have been detected in other places in Gale as white veins caused by groundwater moving through cracks in the rocks.https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/article/salt-lake-gale- crater-mars/ Curiosity has found oxygen going into the air in Gale Crater. Measurements over three Martian years (almost six Earth years) by an instrument in the Sample Analysis at Mars (SAM) portable chemistry lab revealed that the level of oxygen went up throughout spring and summer by as much as 30%, and then dropped back to normal levels by fall. Each spring this occurred. These oxygen seasonal variations suggest some unknown process in the atmosphere or the surface is occurring.https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2019/with-mars-methane-mystery- unsolved-curiosity-serves-scientists-a-new-one-oxygenTrainer, M., et al. . 2019.

In these locations, a stream bed may be a raised feature, instead of a valley. The inverted former stream channels may be caused by the deposition of large rocks or due to cementation. In either case erosion would erode the surrounding land but leave the old channel as a raised ridge because the ridge will be more resistant to erosion. An image below, taken with HiRISE shows sinuous ridges that may be old channels that have become inverted. Image:Meandering Ridges.JPGMeandering Ridges that are probably inverted stream channels.

ESP 051978 1720yardangslayers.jpgYardangs, as seen by HiRISE Fretted terrain Parts of the Aeolis quadrangle contain fretted terrain which is characterized by cliffs, mesas, buttes, and straight-walled canyons. It contains scarps or cliffs that are 1 to 2 km in height.Sharp, R. 1973. Mars Fretted and chaotic terrains. J. Geophys. Res.: 78. 4073‚Äì4083Kieffer, Hugh H.; et al., eds. (1992). Mars. Tucson: University of Arizona Press. .  Layered terrain  Researchers, writing in Icarus, have described layered units in the Aeolis quadrangle at Aeolis Dorsa. A deposit that contains yardang was formed after several other deposits. The yardangs contain a layered deposit called \\"rhythmite\\" which was thought to be formed with regular changes in the climate. Because the layers appear harden, a damp or wet environment probably existed at the time. The authors correlate these layered deposits to the upper layers of Gale crater‚Äôs mound (Mt. Sharp). Many places on Mars show rocks arranged in layers. Sometimes the layers are of different colors. Light-toned rocks on Mars have been associated with hydrated minerals like sulfates. The Mars Rover Opportunity examined such layers close-up with several instruments. Some layers are probably made up of fine particles because they seem to break up into find dust. Other layers break up into large boulders so they are probably much harder. Basalt, a volcanic rock, is thought to in the layers that form boulders. Basalt has been identified on Mars in many places. Instruments on orbiting spacecraft have detected clay (also called phyllosilicate) in some layers. Recent research with an orbiting near-infrared spectrometer, which reveals the types of minerals present based on the wavelengths of light they absorb, found evidence of layers of both clay and sulfates in Columbus crater.Cabrol, N. and E. Grin (eds.). 2010. Lakes on Mars. Elsevier.NY. This is exactly what would appear if a large lake had slowly evaporated.Wray, J. et al. 2009. Columbus Crater and other possible plaelakes in Terra Sirenum, Mars. Lunar and Planetary Science Conference. 40: 1896. Moreover, because some layers contained gypsum, a sulfate which forms in relatively fresh water, life could have formed in the crater. Scientists were excited about finding hydrated minerals such as sulfates and clays on Mars because they are usually formed in the presence of water. Places that contain clays and/or other hydrated minerals would be good places to look for evidence of life. Rock can form layers in a variety of ways. Volcanoes, wind, or water can produce layers. Layers can be hardened by the action of groundwater. Martian ground water probably moved hundreds of kilometers, and in the process it dissolved many minerals from the rock it passed through. When ground water surfaces in low areas containing sediments, water evaporates in the thin atmosphere and leaves behind minerals as deposits and/or cementing agents. Consequently, layers of dust could not later easily erode away since they were cemented together. On Earth, mineral-rich waters often evaporate forming large deposits of various types of salts and other minerals. Sometimes water flows through Earth's aquifers, and then evaporates at the surface just as is hypothesized for Mars. One location this occurs on Earth is the Great Artesian Basin of Australia.Habermehl, M. A. (1980) The Great Artesian Basin, Australia. J. Austr. Geol. Geophys. 5, 9‚Äì38. On Earth the hardness of many sedimentary rocks, like sandstone, is largely due to the cement that was put in place as water passed through.

Planet Science: 41, 1675-1690. Ridges often appear as mostly straight segments. They are hundreds of meters long, tens of meters high, and several meters wide. It is thought that impacts created fractures in the surface, these fractures later acted as channels for fluids. Fluids cemented the structures. With the passage of time, surrounding material was eroded away, thereby leaving hard ridges behind. Since the ridges occur in locations with clay, these formations could serve as a marker for clay which requires water for its formation.Mustard et al., 2007.

He was particularly known for his grisaille style, often in gold and black. Career Sert initially studied art in Rome before moving to Paris in 1899. There, he became involved with a group of decorative artists known as Les Nabis, gravitating around Paul Ranson, who had studied at the private Acad√©mie Julian, founded in 1868 by painter Rodolphe Julian. Sert was commissioned in 1900 to paint the interior of the Vic Cathedral in the Province of Barcelona, Catalonia in murals, which took him more than 30 years to complete. By 1910, Sert had begun fully focusing on murals and other large-scale work. He collaborated with Russian Sergei Diaghilev to create sets for his Ballets Russes. In the United States, Sert painted a mural at the Waldorf-Astoria in New York City, as well as a 1937 mural entitled American Progress at 30 Rockefeller Center. American Progress was commissioned by the Rockefellers to replace Diego Rivera‚Äôs mural Man at the Crossroads, which Nelson Rockefeller destroyed because it included an image of Lenin. He later painted the walls and ceilings of the Council Chambers at the League of Nations in Geneva. Personal life Sert began an affair with the well-known pianist and patron of the arts Misia Godebska in 1908. They married on 2 September 1920. In 1925, Sert met Georgian-Russian sculptress Isabelle Roussadana Mdivani, known as Roussy, who subsequently moved in with him and Misia. Sert began an affair with Roussy and later divorced Misia on 28 December 1927 to marry Mdivani. Roussy and Sert were married in 1928 in a civil ceremony at the consulate in The Hague. In 1930, they were married in a religious ceremony at the Spanish church in Paris. After Roussy died in 1938, Sert reconciled with Misia and returned to life with her, though they kept separate apartments Sert died on 27 November 1945 in Barcelona, and left his apartment and furnishings to Misia.

Built in 1901 by the Metropolitan District Commission (MDC), it is one of Stoneham's finest examples of Renaissance Revival architecture. The building (along with an adjacent gatehouse) was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984, and included in the Middlesex Fells Reservoirs Historic District in 1990. Description and history Spot Pond was designated as the public water supply for Melrose, Malden, and Medford in 1870, with a dam at its southern end enlarging a natural body of water. In the 1890s it was made a centerpiece of the Middlesex Fells Reservation, and about 1900 its water supply function was taken over by the MDC. This Romanesque Revival building was designed by Shepley, Rutan and Coolidge and completed in 1901, as part of a general expansion of water service in the area, and was placed on the former summer estate of Charles Copeland. It is built of yellow brick with limestone trim. It has quoined corners, and features rusticated arched windows. It was extended with a side ell in 1923. In 1975 the building was extensively damaged by fire. Its tile roof and clerestory were lost, replaced by the present asphalt shingle hip roof. When built, the building housed three steam-powered engines capable of pumping 90 million gallons per day; one of these machines was moved here from the Mystic Pumping Station in Somerville. These engines were replaced between the late 1920s and 1950s with large diesel engines. Spot Pond has been relegated to emergency service by the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority, successor to the MDC. The pumping station now delivers water to area communities from a covered tank elsewhere in the reservation.

As a team, San Jose State won the 1969 National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Div I Track Championships, his teams placed in the top 10 14 times. San Jose State also won two NCAA Men's Division I Cross Country Championships in 1962 and 1963 and were runners-up in 1961. Winter served as an assistant coach for the U.S. team at the 1964 Olympic Games in Tokyo. Early success SJSU Speed City Before joining SJSC, Winter coached Harold Davis at Hartnell College in Salinas, California to tying the world record in the 100 metres. Davis never had the opportunity to compete in the Olympics, his peak years falling during World War II. During the war, Winter taught relaxation techniques to Naval pilots. Also during that time, Winter invented a life jacket that would automatically inflate if it came in contact with water.

The scandal provided right-wing political forces within Germany with a basis with which to attack the Social Democrats and the republic itself. Antisemitism in connection with the scandal also featured prominently in Nazi propaganda, since the Barmat brothers were Jewish.See generally Time, \\"The Scandals,\\" 16 February 1925; and Fulda. The scandal was used by the German right to foster the belief that wealthy Jewish families, in quasi-criminal operations found fertile ground in the Republic and easily exploited the Social Democrats to do their bidding.Berkowitz pp. 17-18. The right-wing press was eager to use Barmat Scandal as a vehicle for antisemitism.Mommsen pp. 304-05. Background and dramatis person√¶ The Weimar governmentUnder the Weimar Constitution, a semi- presidential system was established. The President of the Republic shared executive power with a Chancellor, who (along with his cabinet) was responsible to the Reichstag. was headed by Gustav Bauer, a Social Democrat, as Chancellor from June 1919 through March 1920.Bauer was also a member of the Reichstag from the beginning of the republic (and even before) until his resignation, as a result of the Scandal, in February 1925; eventually he was politically rehabilitated and served again in the Reichstag in the latter 1920s. He also served in various cabinet posts (including Minister of Finance) in governments headed by other Chancellors. Friedrich Ebert was the Republic's initial President, from the end of World War IEbert served provisionally as President after the Armistice, and then in his own right after the adoption of the new constitution until his death. until his death in February 1925. Julius Barmat was a Russian Jew who became a wholesale merchant with \\"less than perfect character.\\"Poor pp. 14-15. After World War I, he moved to the Netherlands where he bought foodstuffs in the Netherlands to export into Germany (which had suffered badly during and after the war from lack of food) after the end of the war. He made a large amount of money in this endeavor and was‚Äîat least from the view of the nationalists‚Äîengaged in war profiteering.The four Barmat brothers were Jews who had emigrated from Poland after 1918, thus branding them as the \\"Eastern Jews\\" who were the easiest targets for European anti-Semitism. Mommsen, pp.234-235) Barmat had profited from political patronage. He had joined the Dutch Social Democrats in 1908 and after the war had given the Social Democrats Second International free office space in his Amsterdam home. He consequently met German Social Democrats and developed connections that were helpful in transactions in foodstuffs for Germany. Barmat also had connections with Ernst Heilman (the SPD leader in the Prussian Landtag)Kauders pp. 126-27. Heilman was also Jewish, adding additional motivation for the anti-Semites to attack and malign him and to promote the Scandal in the press. No charges were ever substantiated against him. and Gustav Bauer (former Reich Chancellor). Heilmann became close friends with Julius and wrote letters of recommendation and served on the boards of six Barmat companies, but did not accept financial rewards. However, Wilhelm Richter, President of the Berlin Police, did receive gifts from Barmat.Ibid., p. 126-130. Barmat also met Ebert as well as Otto Wels (Chairman of the SPD) and (indiscreetly, it appears in retrospect) bragged about his political connections. The Misdeeds The Barmats received German visas and established business relations with various state offices, including the Prussian State Bank and the Preu√üische Seehandlung. In return they donated around 20,000 Reichsmarks to Social Democratic newspapers, founded a children's home in Pirna, and paid commissions to Bauer.Kauders p. 414. The national government's postal department generated considerable cash as a result of the mail and it investedThe investments appear to have been mere commercial loans made to the Barmat company, which were either not secured at all with collateral, or were undersecured. idle funds with Barmat's investment company.The practice of investing surplus cash was not in itself unusual; such investments had been made by government departments for a long time and the practice was no doubt considered prudent and wise by the Germans. The Prussian State Bank also loaned a considerable sum of money to Barmat. Barmat, however, engaged in currency speculation with the funds, and the Barmat investment company collapsed in late 1924.See Berkowitz. Both the national Weimar government and the Prussian State Bank lost several million dollars as a result of the Barmat firm's collapse, and a Reichstag commission was formed to investigate the matter. In addition, a commission of the Prussian Landtag was also formed to investigate. Most of the investigative work (and almost all of the publicity) came from this Landtag committee, or as a result of its work, rather than from the national committee of the central parliament.The Reichstag commission took no real action; by contrast, the Prussian Landtag committee met in over 52 sessions and issued its report 3 October 1925. Arrests and Revelations Various Prussian State Bank officials were arrested on 30 December 1924. The Barmat brothers were arrested early in the morning of the next day, New Year's Eve 1924.See Fulda, p. 94-96. A prosecutor, Kussmann (who had worked on the Kutisker case) turned the press allegations against Barmat into a scandal. Kussmann started a Barmat investigation in December 1924, and leaked information to the right-wing paper Berliner Lokal-Anzeiger (which was controlled by Alfred Hugenberg). Kussman staged a sensational raid on Julius Barmat's home on New Year's Eve 1924, and police rounded up the other three brothers and searched the various offices of the Barmat group, making front-page news in Berlin. The Berliner Lokal- Anzeiger claimed that the arrests were a result of the exploitation of political connections to obtain loans for the Barmat Brothers firm and of certain favorable contracts that were granted to the Barmats by Reich companies. Preliminary investigation suggested that several prominent Social Democrats had received bribes, kickbacks or other financial favors in exchange for their support of Government contracts with the Barmats. The evidence showed as follows for the leading protagonists: Bauer Bauer did not handle the press accusations well, keeping silent when the press exposed his membership on the board of a Barmat company, and issuing a denial of any involvement in the affair in January 1925, after the arrest of the Barmat brothers. In particular, he denied any benefit by way of financial remuneration. This was a most unfortunate public statement for Bauer, because his opponents had specific documentary evidence that it was a lie. The first climax of the Prussian investigating commission took place in late January 1925, with Bauer, a prominent Social Democrat, giving evidence.Bauer was an SPD member of the Reichstag at the time of his testimony and had previously served in various roles in the Weimar government. He served as Minister of Labor in the period October 1918- August 1919. Thereafter, Bauer succeeded Philipp Scheidemann as Chancellor. Scheidemann had refused to support any decision to sign the Treaty of Versailles; he resigned a few days before its signature on 28 June 1919. Bauer's new government eventually formed on 14 August 1919; he then served as Chancellor until 26 March 1920. He then served in the next government (the first Mueller cabinet), as Minister of Finance from March to June 1920 and as Minister of Transportation in May‚ÄìJune 1920. Bauer later played a dual role as Vice-Chancellor and Finance Minister in the Wirth government, from May 1921 until November 1922. During his period of government service, he had helped Barmat win food supply contracts with various Reich departments. After leaving office he helped Barmat one time with a Government scrap-metal deal; Bauer was to receive a commission from Barmat for this help. In late 1923 their relationship ended over a dispute as to the amount of \\"commission\\" that Bauer would receive for this deal.Fulda, p. 94-95. Bauer had publicly denied that he served on any Barmat supervisory board; but this was a lie, and he was forced to admit as much under the cross-examination by the Commission. He was also forced to admit that his actions in helping Barmat win government contracts were considerably more frequent and more involved that his previous statements to the press had indicated.Ibid. Despite these reversals of his prior statements, he steadfastly and repeatedly continued to deny to the Commission that he had received any financial compensation from Barmat. However, in early February, only a few days after the testimony, the Lokal-Anzeiger reprinted a letter from Barmat to Bauer as a part of an article on the scandal. This letter was written during the period of their 1923 commission dispute over the scrap-metal deal, and identified the occasions on which Bauer had received money from Barmat. Bauer was caught in a bald-faced lie and, it would appear, had committed perjury in denying any receipt of compensation. The SPD promptly asked Bauer to resign from the party and the Reichstag, and he did so on 6 February 1925.Fulda, p. 95-98.Bauer regained admission to the party, and represented it again in the Reichstag, having fought to re-establish his blemished reputation, in May 1926. The final report (October 1925) of Prussian Commission affirmed that Ebert had committed no improprieties in the affair and that his reputation was without strain relative to the scandal. While Bauer and Richter were reprimanded for careless and incautious conflict of interest, they had not profited directly or indirectly from the loans made to Barmat by the Prussian State Bank. Ebert The Reich Presidency election would take place in spring of 1925. The right-wing would not forfeit a chance to discredit him by association with scandal.\\"The opportunity of smearing Social Democrats in general, and Ebert in particular, loomed large on [right-wing] journalists' minds.\\" Fulda, p. 91. A motion was made in the Landtag commission in early February to investigate Ebert's knowledge of the Barmat scandal, particularly any involvement by the office of the President with the Barmats. The testimony of 23 February 1925 before the Commission established that Barmat had received letters of recommendation bearing the Presidential seal. The right-wing press made much of the testimony. It turned out that an office employee had indeed dispatched several letters of recommendation to Barmat, bearing the Presidential Seal. Ebert had unfortunately recommended in 1919 that Barmat be given a permanent visa for his many business trips to and from Germany.This was natural in light of the contracts and did not in itself imply any misdeeds, but it was fodder for the right-wing press. Berkowitz, p. 16. Ebert was diagnosed with appendicitis and peritonitis on 26 February. He died two days later. He was ultimately cleared of any wrongdoing by the Prussian investigating committee in the fall of 1925. Mommsen claims that Ebert's death (28 February 1925) was caused in part by the strain brought on by the Barmat scandal (particularly a result of the right-wing vilification against the Prussian government).Mommsen p. 234-35. Hofle Julius and Henry Barmat met with Dr. Anton Hofle, the Minister of Posts, in June 1924 and paid him bribes of some 120,000 Reichmarks over several months (In January 1924 hyperinflation had begun to be tackled with the ‚ÄúRentenmark‚Äù so that by June 1924 120,000 Marks was worth something). They then borrowed 14.5 million Marks from the national Postal Department in September 1924. The loan was not secured and the Republic's money was lost when Barmat's investment speculations turned sour. Hofle resigned his ReichstagHofle was a member of the Catholic Center party, not the SPD. seat on 9 February 1925 and was arrested on 10 February 1925. Hofle died, in custody and from a drug overdose, some six days before the second round of the Presidential election.Hofle died on April 20. The Presidential election was held April 26. The Catholic Center press accused the prosecutors of pumping Hofle full of narcotics so that he would be available for questioning and implied that this amounted to a form of homicide. The right-wing of course claimed that Hofle's death was a suicide that amounted to his confession of guilt in the Barmat affair. Richter Three days after Hofle's arrest, Richter, the Police President of Prussia, was placed on an involuntary \\"leave\\" and a week later was dispatched into \\"interim retirement.\\" Heilmann Ernst Heilmann, the SPD leader in the Prussian Landtag, revealed no compromising information, other than that he had supported Barmat's request for additional funds in early December 1924, in discussions with the Prussian Finance Minister. He was never charged or sanctioned, although some commentators did consider his intervention with the Ministry of Finance to be improper. Elections The right-wing press, and the Nazi Party in particular, used the Barmat scandal as a vehicle to express its underlying anti-Semitic, anti-socialist and anti-democratic sentiments.Fulda p. 103-05. An Austrian commentator perceptively noted that the right-wing press and propaganda campaign, using the Barmat scandal as the excuse and opportunity for expressing its sentiments, was more dangerous than the military coups to which the Republic had been subjected. The press campaign appealed to the hearts and minds of those who sought an excuse and a reason for the hardships and perceived injustices that Germany continued to suffer. The right-wing successfully propagandized that corruption was an inherent characteristic of democracy and that the only solution was the abandonment of democracy and a return to the ways of the autocratic past. They referred to the \\"corruption economy\\" which was a result of the SPD leadership in post-war Germany. The scandal provided grist for the mill of right-wing propagandists, who could fulminate against Jewish speculators and profiteers as well as against all manner of Socialist politicians and others who supported the republic. Frustrated voters had an opportunity to channel their resentment against inflation and war profiteers against specific targets, and to transfer the responsibility for those ills to the Social Democrats.Berkowitz p. 14. Parliamentary Election of December 1924 The Presidential Election of 1925 Reichstag elections were held 7 December 1924. Cabinet formation was complex, taking until 15 January. The result was a bourgeois coalition of rightist and center parties in the Rechtsblock under Hans Luther as Chancellor. The SDP went into opposition against the coalition of the Center, DVP and DNVP, and it promised the Luther government a \\"ruthless fight.\\"Fulda p. 91-94. Barmat was one of Weimar's biggest media scandals, due principally to the upcoming election for President in April 1925. Ebert was a formidable contender for re-election and the right-wing press saw an opportunity in Barmat to score political points.Fulda p. 91. Ebert had died and Braun was the SPD candidate. The Barmat Scandal was bandied about in the press in preparation for the Presidential election and it also appeared as a topic at right-wing political rallies. The right-wing Nationalpost stated the theme: The Barmat scandal was not just a tale of corruption within the Prussian State Bank or the Postal Ministry. It was rather a scandal of Social Democracy itself. Leading Social Democrats, it contended, had improperly used political influence to secure favorable treatment (such as loans and contracts) for the Barmats, in exchange for payments and other financial benefits that flowed both to themselves individually as well as to the party. Political leaflets were distributed throughout the countryside based on the history of the scandal. No candidate secured a majority in the first round of elections, so under the Weimar Constitution a second round of elections had to be conducted.The practice was unusual in that it was not a run-off between the top two candidates. Rather, it was an entirely new election. It was not limited to the top candidates in the first elections, or even to persons who had been candidates in the first election. In this round, the SPD aligned with the Center through a political deal: the SPD candidate Braun withdrew from the Presidential race and was elected president of Prussia on 3 April 1925 with the Center's support; and in return the SPD supported Marx (the Center party candidate) for Reich President. At this point the right-wing abandoned its first-round candidate Jarres and instead offered up General Paul von Hindenburg as its candidate. The right-wing Reichsblock called the Center-SPD coalition the Barmatblock, and leaflets and pamphlets that painted the center- leftist coalition with the Barmat scandal were distributed widely throughout Germany.These bore titles such as Barmat and his Friends, From Rathenau to Barmat (with rather obvious anti-Semitic overtones), and The Barmat Quagmire (by Dr. Kaufhold, a member of the Prussian investigating commission and a highly partisan one; the Commission took steps to distance itself from his book and pronouncements). See Fulda p. 95-110. Hindenburg won on April 26 by a margin of 900,000 votes, largely as a result of his appeal to new voters who had stayed home in the first round. He had campaigned on the basis of restoring non-partisanship to the Presidential office and of a general restoration of social harmony. The press campaign was a key in this close election, as Fulda observed (p. 104): > The key to [Hindenburg's] success lay in the mobilization of former non- > voters, and their dissatisfaction with the present system.... Hindenburg > [might not have] scraped into office without four months of media barrage > aimed at discrediting the Republic. Sentencing Passing Court Judgment on Julius and Henry Barmat In early 1928 Julius and Henri Barmat were sentenced to 11 months and 6 months imprisonment for bribery, respectively.Davidson p. 455. After serving his sentence, Julius Barmat left Germany for the Low Countries. He was caught once again in another corruption scandal in which he was accused of bribery in order to obtain loans which ended up defrauding the Belgian National Bank of 34 million gold francs. He committed suicide in 1937.

The famous, distinctive, and durable design was introduced in autumn 1963 and built through 1989. It was succeeded by a modified version, internally referred to as Porsche 964 but still sold as Porsche 911, as are current models. Mechanically, the 911 was notable for being rear engined and air-cooled. From its inception, the 911 was modified both by private teams and the factory itself for racing, rallying and other types of automotive competition. The original 911 series is often cited as the most successful competition car ever, especially when its variations are included, mainly the powerful 911-derived 935 which won 24 Hours of Le Mans and other major sports cars races outright against prototypes. Introduction The Porsche 911 was developed as a much more powerful, larger, more comfortable replacement for the Porsche 356. The new car made its public debut at the 1963 Internationale Automobil-Ausstellung, better known to English speakers as the Frankfurt Motor Show. It was initially designated as the \\"Porsche 901\\", after its internal project number. However, Peugeot protested on the grounds that in France it had exclusive rights to car names formed by three numbers with a zero in the middle. So, instead of selling the new model with another name in France, Porsche changed the name to 911. It went on sale in 1964. 2.0-litre / O, A and B series (1964‚Äì1969) The earliest editions of the 911 had an air-cooled, rear-mounted, 2.0 L (1,991 cc) flat-6 \\"boxer\\" engine, similar to the 356's four-cylinder 1.6 L unit. It was mated to a five-speed manual \\"Type 901\\" transmission. The car had 2+2 seating, though the rear was very small, also like the 356. The styling was largely by Ferdinand \\"Butzi\\" Porsche, son of Ferdinand \\"Ferry\\" Porsche. Erwin Komenda, the leader of the Porsche car body construction department, was also involved in the design. When 356 production came to an end in 1965, there was still a market for a 4-cylinder car, particularly in the USA. The Porsche 912, a slightly downscaled 911 fitted with the 356's engine, was introduced the same year as its replacement. In 1967, Porsche introduced the more powerful 911S. Alloy wheels from Fuchs, in a distinctive 5-leaf design, were offered for the first time. A racing version of the 911 engine was developed and used in the mid-engined Porsche 904 and Porsche 906 track cars. The Targa version, with a stainless steel-clad roll bar, appeared the same year. Porsche had feared the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) would outlaw fully open convertibles, an important market for the 356. It was equipped with a removable roof panel and a removable plastic rear window (although a fixed glass version was offered alongside from 1968). The name \\"Targa\\" - shield in Italian - came from the Targa Florio sports car road race in Sicily, in which Porsche had scored seven victories since 1956, with four more to come through 1973. This last in the subsequently discontinued event is especially notable as it was won with a 911 Carrera RS against prototypes entered by Italian factories of Ferrari and Alfa Romeo. The 911T was also launched in 1967 and effectively replaced the 912. The staple model was renamed the 911L. The 911R, a lightweight racing version with thin aluminium doors, a magnesium crankcase, twin-spark cylinder heads, and a power output of , had a very limited production of just 20 cars. Porsche 911 2.0 Coupe inside the Porsche Museum In 1969, the slightly lengthened B series was introduced. It moved the rear wheels on all 911 and 912 models 57 mm aft, increasing wheelbase from to remedy to the car's nervous handling at the limit. Fuel injection arrived both for the 911S and a new middle model, the 911E. A semi-automatic Sportomatic model, composed of a torque converter, automatic clutch, and four-speed transmission, was added to the product lineup. B17 (1969) alt= The 911 B17 is a concept designed by Pininfarina, which took a standard 911 and lengthened the wheelbase by , resulting in a car that weighed almost . 2.2-litre / C and D series (1969‚Äì1971) For MY 1970 the engines of all 911s were increased to . Power outputs were uprated to in the 911T, in the 911E, and in the 911S. The 912 was discontinued, with the 914 taking its place as Porsche's entry model. Despite the lower power output of the 911E compared to the 911S, the 911E was quicker during acceleration up to . C 20 (1970) Vehicle Identification Number (Vin #) 9111120162 Cabriolet The 911 C 20 is a prototype based on the standard 911 but lengthened by over the stock car. It used a 911S engine. 2.4-litre / E and F series (1971‚Äì1973) 1972 Porsche 911 T Targa with removable roof. Notice the oil filler door on the rear right fender, which is only found on the 1972 model. The 1972‚Äì1973 model years consisted of the same models of 911-- the entry level T, the midrange E and the top of the line S. However, all models got a new, larger engine. This is universally known as the \\"2.4L\\" engine, despite its displacement being closer to 2.3 litres-- perhaps to emphasize the increase over the 2.2 L. The new power ratings for the T were , or in the U.S., for the E and for the S. The 911E and 911S used mechanical fuel injection (MFI) in all markets. The 911T was carbureted, except in the United States where it also used MFI, which accounts for the power difference between the two. In January 1973, U.S. 911Ts were transferred to the new K-Jetronic CIS (Continuous Fuel Injection) system from Bosch. These CIS-powered cars are usually referred to as \\"1973.5\\" models by enthusiasts. With the power and torque increases, the 2.4 L cars also got a newer, stronger transmission, identified by its Porsche type number 915. Derived from the transmission in the Porsche 908 race car, the 915 did away with the 901/911 transmission's \\"dog-leg\\" style first gear arrangement, opting for a traditional H pattern with first gear up to the left, second gear underneath first, etc. Some say this was because the dog-leg shift to second gear was inconvenient for city driving, other say it was due to Porsche's desire to put 5th gear outside the main transmission housing where it could easily be changed for different races. The Sportomatic transmission was still available but only as a special order. In 1972 a tremendous effort was made to improve the handling of the 911. Due to the 911's unusual engine placement (rear-mounted, with most of the vehicle's weight concentrated over the rear axle), early 911's were prone to oversteer when driven at the limit, and could easily spin in the hands of an inexperienced driver. In an attempt to remedy this, Porsche relocated the oil tank from its position behind the right rear wheel to in front of it. This had the effect of moving the weight of almost 8.5 L (9 US quarts) of oil from outside the wheelbase to inside, improving weight distribution and thus, handling. To facilitate filling of the oil tank, Porsche installed an oil filler door (much like the fuel filler door on the left front fender) on the right rear quarter panel. Unfortunately, this unique design was scrapped after only one year, some say because inattentive gas station attendants were putting gas in the oil tank. The oil tank was subsequently relocated to its original position for model year 1973, and remained there until it was relocated within the wheelbase for the 964 models. 911S models also gained a discreet spoiler under the front bumper to improve high-speed stability. With a weight of only , these models are often regarded as the best classic mainstream 911s. For racing at this time, the 911 ST was produced in limited numbers (the production run for the ST only lasted from 1970 to 1971.) The cars were available with a choice of either 2,466 cc or 2,492 cc engines, producing at 8,000 rpm. Weight was down to . The cars had success at the Daytona 6 Hours, the Sebring 12 Hours, the 1000 km N√ºrburgring and the Targa Florio. Carrera RS (1973 and 1974) A 1973 Porsche 911 Carrera RS The Carrera RS models, valued by collectors, are considered by many to be the greatest classic 911s of all-time. RS stands for Rennsport in German, meaning \\"racing sport\\". The Carrera name was reintroduced from the 356 Carrera which had itself been named after Porsche's victories in the Carrera Panamericana races in Mexico in the 1950s. The RS was built so that Porsche could enter racing formulae that demanded that a certain minimum number of production cars were made. Compared with a standard 911S, the Carrera 2.7 RS had a larger boxer-6 engine with a bore x stroke of developing at 6,300 rpm and of torque at 5,100 rpm with Bosch Mechanical Fuel Injection, revised and stiffened suspension, a \\"ducktail\\" rear spoiler, larger brakes, wider rear wheels and rear wings. In RS Touring form it weighed , in Sport Lightweight form it was about lighter, the saving coming from the thin-gauge steel used for parts of the bodyshell and also the use of thinner glass. In total, 1,580 were made, comfortably exceeding the 500 that had to be made to qualify for the vital FIA Group 4 class. 49 Carrera RSR cars were built with engines producing . In 1974, Porsche created the Carrera RS 3.0 with mechanical fuel injection producing . It was almost twice as expensive as the 2.7 RS but offered a fair amount of racing capability for that price. The chassis was largely similar to that of the 1973 Carrera RSR and the brake system was from the Porsche 917. The use of thin metal plate panels and a spartan interior enabled the shipping weight to be reduced to around . Porsche RSR with Gijs van Lennep at the N√ºrburgring 1974 1976 Porsche 911 2.7 The Carrera RSR 3.0 and Carrera RSR Turbo (its 2.1 L engine due to a 1.4x equivalency formula) were made in low numbers for racing. The turbo car came second at the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 1974, a significant event in that its engine would form the basis of many future Porsche attempts in sports car racing, and can be regarded as the start of its commitment to turbocharging. 2.7-litre / G, H, I and J series (1974‚Äì1977) The new impact bumper MY 1974 was the introduction of impact bumpers to conform with low speed protection requirements of U.S. law, these bumpers being so successfully integrated into the design that they remained unchanged for 15 years. In 1974 the engine size was increased to 2,687 cc, giving an increase in torque. The use of K-Jetronic CIS Bosch fuel injection in two of the three models in the line up-- the 911 and 911S models, retaining the narrow rear wings of the old 2.4, now had a detuned version of the RS engine producing 150 and 175 bhp (110 and 129 kW) respectively. Carrera 2.7 / G and H (1974-1975) The Carrera 2.7 was mechanically similar to the 1973 RS, inheriting its MFI engine and still weighed the same at 1075 kg (2370 lb). It had the wide RS rear wings and also the ducktail for the 1974 model (except for the German market). It was available either as a coupe or a Targa. For 1976 a special run of 113 coupes with MFI were made. In addition, 30 MFI Targas with narrow rear wings were made for the Belgian Police. The US Carrera 2.7 was restricted to the 2.7 K-Jetronic engine as the MFI RS engine was banned on emission grounds. Power output was , though it was later reduced to for the U.S. market as a whole, and to in California. The well known problem of pulled cylinder head studs with the K-Jetronic 2.7 engine only occurred in hot climates. This emerged in 1975 in California where thermal reactors, aimed at reducing emissions, were fitted below the cylinder heads thus causing heat build up around the magnesium crankcase and then made worse by the lean running K-Jetronic CIS. The fitting of a 5-blade engine fan instead of the usual 11-blade further compounded the situation. Bearing in mind Porsche's largest market being the US, the 930 Turbo, Carrera 3.0 and all subsequent models used aluminium alloy crankcases which were around heavier. The Bosch K-Jetronic CIS varied fuel pressure to the injectors dependent on the mass airflow. While this system was exceedingly reliable, it did not allow the use of as \\"hot\\" cams as MFI or carburettors allowed. Therefore, the 911S's horsepower decreased from 190 to 175 PS (140‚Äì128 kW) despite the displacement increase from 2.4 to 2.7 L. However, the engine did have increased drivability. Also produced for the 1976 \\"model year\\", for the U.S. market, was the 912E, a 4-cylinder version of the 911 like the 912 that had last been produced in 1969. It used the I-series chassis and the 2.0 Volkswagen engine from the Porsche 914. In all, 2099 units were produced. In 1976, the Porsche 924 took this car's place for the 1977 \\"model year\\" and beyond. The power was supplied by a 4-cylinder high- performance fuel injection motor also used in the Volkswagen 411. Less than 6,000 were built. Carrera 3.0 (1976‚Äì1977) The Carrera 3.0 was given the same diecast aluminium crankcase as the 930 or ‚Äô911 Turbo‚Äô. Its 3-litre engine had K-Jetronic CIS fuel injection. Power output was slightly down on the Carrera 2.7 at although the 188 lb/ft of torque was now available at 4,200 rpm. Weight was up by to . During its two-year life span, only 3687 cars were built. Of these 2564 were coup√©s and 1123 Targas. Turbo (Type 930) (1974‚Äì1989) In 1974 Porsche introduced the first production turbocharged 911. Although called simply Porsche 911 Turbo in Europe, it was marketed as the Porsche 930 (930 being its internal type number) in North America. The body shape is distinctive, thanks to wide wheel-arches to accommodate the wide tires, and a large rear spoiler often known as a \\"whale tail\\" on the early cars, and \\"tea-tray\\" on the later ones. Starting out with a 3.0 L engine producing , it rose to 3.3 L and for 1978. The early cars are known for their exhilarating acceleration coupled with challenging handling characteristics and extreme turbo lag. Production figures of the car soon qualified its racing version for FIA Group 4 competition as the Porsche 934 of 1976. Many participated at Le Mans and other races including some epic battles with the BMW 3.0 CSL \\"Batmobile\\". The wilder Porsche 935, a finer tuned car in FIA Group 5 that evolved from the 2.1 L RSR Turbo of 1974, was first campaigned in 1976 by the factory, and despite subsequent withdrawal of the official works team after 1978, it ultimately won Le Mans outright in 1979 in the hands of the private Kremer Racing team. Privateers continued to compete successfully with the car until well into the 1980s. Due to stricter emissions regulations, the 930 was withheld from the US and Japanese markets from 1981 through 1985. It was re-introduced into the United States in 1986. As demand for the Turbo soared in the late 1980s, Porsche introduced novelty variants including a slant-nose version (option M505/M506), while not significantly improving the range mechanically. Although these cars could be sold for extraordinary premiums over the standard models, the company's reluctance to invest in research and development of the entire 911 line at that time turned out to be an almost fatal decision not only for the 911, but for the company. Only in 1989, its last year of production, was the 930 equipped with a five-speed gearbox. The 930 was replaced in 1990 with a 964 version featuring the same 3.3 L engine. There have been turbocharged variants of each subsequent generation of 911. SC / L, M, A, B, C and D series (1978‚Äì1983) Porsche 911SC Targa 1983 Porsche 911SC Starting in MY 1978, the new 3.0 L 911 SC (2,994 cc) was now the second generation basic 911 model. It was in effect a Carrera 3 (known as a 911S in the United States) detuned to provide . The \\"SC\\" designation was reintroduced by Porsche for the first time since the 356 SC (as distinguished from the race-engined 356 Carrera). No Carrera versions were produced and the 930 Turbo remaining at the top of the range. Porsche's engineers felt that the weight of the extra luxury, safety and emissions equipment on these cars was blunting performance compared to the earlier, lighter cars with the same power output, so in non-US cars, power was increased to for 1980, then finally to . However, cars sold in the US market retained their lower-compression engines throughout. This enabled them to be run on lower-octane fuel. In model year 1980, Porsche offered a Weissach special edition version of the 911 SC, named after the town in Germany where Porsche has their research center. Designated M439, it was offered in two colors with the turbo whale tail & front chin spoiler, body color-matched alloy wheels and other convenience features as standard. 408 cars were built for North America.P. 73 Paternie, P (2000). Porsche 911 Red Book 1965-1999 Motorbooks International. In 1982, a Ferry Porsche Edition was made and a total of 200 cars were sold with this cosmetic package. SCs sold in the UK could be specified with the Sport Group Package (UK) which added stiffer suspension, the rear spoiler, front rubber lip and black . In 1981, a Cabriolet concept car was shown at the Frankfurt Motor Show. Not only was the car a true convertible, but it also featured four-wheel drive, although this was dropped in the production version. The first 911 Cabriolet debuted in late 1982, as a 1983 model. This was Porsche's first cabriolet since the 356 of the mid-1960s. It proved very popular with 4,214 sold in its introductory year, despite its premium price relative to the open-top targa.P. 77 Paternie, P (2000). Porsche 911 Red Book 1965-1999 Motorbooks International. Cabriolet versions of the 911 have been offered ever since. It was during this time, that Porsche AG decided the long-term fate of the 911. In 1979 Porsche had made plans to replace the 911 with their new 928. Sales of the 911 remained so strong however, that Porsche revised its strategy and decided to inject new life into the 911 editions. Peter W.

With the 911's future ensured, 1983 saw the launch of a replacement for the successful SC series. It was the MY 1984 911 3.2 Carrera, reviving the Carrera name for the first time since 1977. The 911 3.2 Carrera was the second iteration of the 911 series, with all subsequent models featuring new body styling with new brake, electronic and suspension technologies. A new, higher-displacement motor, a 3.2-liter horizontally opposed flat 6 cylinder, was utilized. At the time, Porsche claimed it was 80% new.p. 13 Corlett, T (2005) Porsche 911 3.2 Carrera ‚Äì The Last of the evolution Veloce Publishing The new swept volume of 3,164 cc was achieved using the bore (from the previous SC model) combined with the 1978 Turbo 3.3 crankshaft's stroke. In addition, higher domed pistons increased the compression ratio from 9.8 to 10.3:1 (although only 9.5:1 for the US market). New inlet manifold and exhaust systems were fitted. The 915 transmission was carried over from the SC series for the first three model years. In 1987, the Carrera got a new five-speed gearbox sourced from Getrag, model number G50 with proven Borg-Warner synchronizers. This slightly heavier version also featured a hydraulically operated clutch. With the new engine, power was increased to at 5,900 rpm for North American-delivered cars and to at 5,900 rpm for most other markets. This version of the 911 accelerated from 0‚Äì in 5.4 seconds (Car & Driver tested 5.3 seconds for the US versionhttps://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/1984-porsche-911-carrera-archived- road-test-review) and had a top speed of as measured by Autocar. Factory times were more modest: 0-60 mph time of 6.3 seconds for the US version and 6.1 seconds for cars outside the American market. The disc brakes were increased in size to aid in more effective heat dissipation and improved oil-fed chain tensioners were fitted to the engine. To improve oil cooling, a finned cooler replaced the serpentine lines in the front passenger fender well. This was further improved in 1987, with the addition of a thermostatically controlled fan. Driving refinement and motor reliability were improved with an upgrade of the fuel and ignition control components to a L-Jetronic with Bosch Motronics 2 DME (Digital Motor Electronics system). An improvement in fuel-efficiency was due to the DME providing a petrol cut-off on the overrun. Changes in the fuel map & chip programming from October 1986, further improved the power to at 5,900 rpm for North American delivered cars as well as for other markets requesting low emissions, like Germany. Custom-mapped chips remain a popular upgrade. The fuel relay that is mounted externally on the DME is known to be a weak point of the system. Three basic models were available throughout the Carrera years ‚Äì coup√©, targa and cabriolet. When launched in 1984 in the United States, the prices of the 911 Carrera lineup were $31,950 for the coup√©, $33,450 for the targa and $36,450 for the cabriolet.p. 145 Leffingwell, R (2002) Porsche 911 Buyers Guide MBI Publishing Co Almost indistinguishable from the SC, external clues are the front fog lights, which were integrated into the front valance in the Carrera. Very modest cosmetic changes were made throughout the lifespan of the Carrera, with a redesigned dash featuring larger air conditioning vents appearing in 1986. Two special editions of the Carrera were produced ‚Äì the \\"Commemorative Edition\\" in 1988 to commemorate 250,000 911s produced and an \\"Anniversary\\" edition in 1989 which was the model's 25th year of production. Both were cosmetic packages with limited production. In 1984, Porsche also introduced the M491 option. Officially called the Supersport, it was commonly known as the \\"Turbo-look\\". It was a style that resembled the Porsche 930 Turbo with wide wheel arches and the distinctive \\"tea tray‚Äù tail. It featured the stiffer turbo suspension and the superior turbo braking system as well as the wider turbo wheels. Sales of the Supersport were particularly strong for its first two years in the United States because the desirable 930 was not available. The 911 Speedster (option M503), a low-roof version of the Cabriolet which was evocative of the Porsche 356 Speedster of the 1950s, was produced in limited numbers (2104) between January 1989 and July 1989 as both a narrow body car and a Turbo-look, which also featured 930 brakes, wheels, suspension, and front valence. 171 narrow body examples were built, and 823 examples were built for the US market. It started as a design under Helmuth Bott in 1983 but was not manufactured until six years later. It was a two-seat convertible that featured a low swept windshield.p. 45 Corlett, T (2005) Porsche 911 3.2 Carrera ‚Äì The Last of the evolution Veloce Publishing In 1985, Porsche built a Club Sport prototype with the identification number WP0ZZZ91ZF100848. Later on in that year, a Carrera Club Sport (Row) with the identification number WP0ZZZ91ZFS101166 was special ordered after a Porsche driver was particularly inspired by the club sport prototype on the track. In 1987, Porsche decided to produced 340 units for their customers that wanted a track inspired road car, the club sport lost around in weight by ditching non-essential equipment such as the radio, sunroof, A/C and the rear seats. By 1989, the club sport was no longer produced which makes it today a collectible with its blueprinted engine and low production numbers. Total production of the 911 3.2 Carrera series was 76,473 cars (35,670 coup√©, 19,987 cabrio, 18,468 targ a).p. 74 Corlett, T (2005) Porsche 911 3.2 Carrera ‚Äì The Last of the evolution Veloce Publishing In late 1989, the 911 (930) underwent a major evolution, with the introduction of the Type Porsche 964 (1989‚Äì1993). Position vis-√†-vis the Porsche 928 When 911 sales began to decline by the early 1970s, Porsche executives approved work on the Porsche 928 in 1971. Larger and featuring a front-mounted V8 engine considerably more powerful than the contemporary 911's flat six, the 928 was intended to be a comfortable grand tourer rather than a dedicated sports car. Capable of out-accelerating and even matching or exceeding the 911's cornering prowess in some model years, the 928 sold reasonably well from its introduction in 1977 until its discontinuation in 1995. In spite of its overall capability, it never outsold the 911, and unlike its smaller, sportier sibling, it achieved little success in racing. Motorsport The Porsche factory's first 911-based race car was a lightly modified 1964 Type 901. It finished fifth in the 1965 Monte Carlo Rally and is now housed in the Porsche Museum. Porsche 911s dominated the Trans Am Series under two liter class in the sixties, winning the championship from 1967‚Äì1969. They would later go on to win the championship in 1973, 1974, and 1980. Despite Trans Am being a sedan championship in its early years, the Porsche 911 was a sports car. Its inclusion is likely due to its resemblance to a coup√©.

The reason for such numerous spellings is attributed to the phonetic translation of the name into English. is a village found in the Chiang Rai area in the northern part of Thailand. This village, composed mainly of Akha people, has had a very vivid history involving the drug leader known as Khun Sa. Despite being called Ban Therd Thai, the village will be referred to as Ban Hin Taek which is the name the villagers refer to when talking about their village.Donald Wilson and David Henley, ‚ÄúBeyond Ban Hin Taek,‚Äù Discover Thailand, 1.  Origins and location  Ban Hin Taek is located beyond Doi Mae Salong in Northern Thailand. It is just south of the Thai-Burma border located in the Golden Triangle. In order to reach Ban Hin Taek, one must take the road which starts at Bap Basang on Route 110 between Chiang Rai and Mae Sai. Route 1130 goes west into the mountains where its final destination is Doi Mae Salong. The road eventually becomes Route 1234, a surfaced road.‚ÄúDoi Tung ‚Äì The Flag Mountains,‚Äù Welcome to Chiangmai and Chiangrai. If going further along this road, one will come across a dirt road going north towards the Burmese border. This is the road to Ban Hin Taek. Ban Hin Taek is a village in a valley which is ‚Äúlike a finger pointing‚Äù into the Shan State. It is surrounded by hills that have been scarred by slash-and-burn agriculture. From Ban Hin Taek it is possible to see the summit of Doi Tung, a mountain approximately 1322 metres high. Ban Hin Taek is not a small village. Its inhabitants have expanded the village along a road for more than 3 kilometres towards the Burmese border.Donald Wilson and David Henley, ‚ÄúBeyond Ban Hin Taek,‚Äù Discover Thailand, 2. Its prosperity is influenced by the agricultural trade, but also because of the drug trade that existed for some time in Ban Hin Taek.  History  It is believed that Ban Hin Taek was the first Akha village in Thailand. It was founded in 1903 when the Akha entered Thailand from the easternmost Shan states of Burma.‚ÄúVenturing through the Ghost Gate,‚Äù The Bangkok Post, , 1. From that point onward we know very little of the happenings in Ban Hin Taek. Once Khun Sa appeared in Ban Hin Taek, we have an inflow of articles concerning Ban Hin Taek and his involvement with it. ‚ÄúBan Hin Taek's village headman Duangdee Khemmawongse recalls, ‚ÄòKhun Sa came to live at Ban Hin Taek in late 1964, when he was around 30 and left a year later. In 1976, he came back again with his wife and children.‚Äô‚Äù‚ÄúCashing in on Khun Sa‚Äôs Fame,‚Äù The Bangkok Post, , 1. In 1974, Khun Sa was released from Burmese prison he set up his base 2 years later in Ban Hin Taek. As long as the Thai generals were getting some of the drug revenues, Khun Sa could keep operating in Ban Hin Taek. Khun Sa was also beneficial to the Thai because they hoped to topple the Kuomintang (KMT) and Rangoon‚Äôs hold on north- eastern Burma so that Thailand could become more influential in that area. At this point in time, Khun Sa appointed himself as liberator of the Shan people advocating for a separate Shan state within Burma. He also agreed to ‚Äúsuppress the Beijing-backed Burmese Communist and Thai Communist Parties‚Äù which at the time were very active in that area.Kelvin Rowley, ‚ÄúLord of prosperity,‚Äù The Diplomat, , 1. Khun Sa ended up becoming a successful drug warlord in the years 1974-1982. Once the communists came to power in both Laos and South Vietnam in 1975, Khun Sa was able to get a much stronger hold over the drug trade as the KMT‚Äôs smuggling routes in the area were now disrupted. With all this newfound wealth came newfound power, and Khun Sa needed a way to secure and protect his power. Thus he set up the Shan United Army (SUA) which at its peak had 20,000 soldiers. Khun Sa‚Äôs drug empire continued to grow until the early 1980s when the US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) estimated that ‚Äú70% of heroin consumed in the USA came from his organization.‚Äù Thus, the DEA decided to take action. Before we look at the DEA‚Äôs involvement with Khun Sa, let us look at the benefits Ban Hin Taek got from Khun Sa. While he used the village as a base, it did not mean that he didn‚Äôt give back to the community. In fact, Khun Sa built health centers, schools and was the major benefactor of the Da Tong Chinese school which the KMT had set up.David Scott Mathieson, ‚ÄúA Hostage to History,‚Äù The Irrawady, Volume 14 No.4 (2006). According to Apinan Apinanderthai, the kamnan of tambon Therd Thai, the villagers ‚Äúcalled Khun Sa chao oo, or father.‚Äù‚ÄúBorder village to hold memorial service for drug lord Khun Sa,‚Äù The Bangkok Post, Nov 9, 2007, 1. However, Khun Sa‚Äôs generosity came to an end when the Thai government suddenly changed hands from General Kriangsak Chomanan to General Prem Tinsulanonda. The new general, along with pressure from the DEA who were trying to stop the flow of heroin into the United States (US), decided to kick Khun Sa out of Thailand. Thus, in January 1982, the Thai army, in conjunction with the Border Patrol Police, launched an offensive against Khun Sa‚Äôs base in Ban Hin Taek. Many days of violent fighting ensued and eventually the Thai forces used tanks and planes to get the SUA forces to retreat into Burma. Khun Sa managed to escape beforehand to the town of Hua Muang across the Burmese border. This signaled the end of Khun Sa‚Äôs drug regime in Ban Hin Taek. This was not the end of Ban Hin Taek‚Äôs involvement in drug trafficking. In recent years, the heroin trade has been replaced with methamphetamines. Ban Hin Taek recently has fallen prey to drug traffickers who operate from across the Burmese border. It has been reported that the traffickers bribed local authorities and that four local residents have been killed by the gangs ‚Äì ‚ÄúTwo were eliminated because they tried to turn their backs on the drug trade, and two others because they were being uncooperative.‚Äù‚ÄúNARCOTICS: Drug Trade resumes at Khun Sa‚Äôs ex-bastion: Villagers serve as tools of traffickers,‚Äù The Bangkok Post, Jul 3 2000, 1. Burma decided to take action against this new development and started shelling the border in February 2001. Soon after they also shelled the outskirts of Ban Hin Taek.Desmond Ball, ‚ÄúSecurity Developments in the Thailand-Burma Borderlands,‚Äù Australian Mekong Resource Center (2003), 7. This wasn‚Äôt the end of the new Burmese offensive. In March 2001 Burma prepared more troops and set up for further artillery strikes. As a result, Thai officials were ready to evacuate the villages along the Burmese border to Ban Therd Thai in order to secure their safety.‚ÄúBurma Mobilizes for Attack on Shan Base,‚Äù Bangkok Post, March 11, 2001, 1. However, there is no evidence that the Burmese military took any further action at this time. The latest news coming out of Ban Hin Taek since 2001 was, when on October 26, 2007, Khun Sa died. A funeral was arranged for Khun Sa in order to commemorate his death, but to also attract tourism to the village.‚ÄúBurma Village to hold memorial service for drug lord Khun Sa,‚Äù The Bangkok Post, Nov 9, 2007, 1. From this point on, investors have approached the village trying to develop it and attract tourists to the area.‚ÄúKhun Sa‚Äôs old village may become a tourist attraction,‚Äù The Bangkok Post, Nov 10, 2007, 1.  Economy  Ban Hin Taek has a long custom of an agriculture industry outside of the drug trade. This is the local‚Äôs main source of income unless they directly worked for Khun Sa. Produce such as tomatoes, maize, onions, garlic and potatoes are grown and then sold in other places in Chiang Rai. There is also a tea factory in the village. Ban Hin Taek also has a cross-border trade. Most of this trade is legal, but the villagers who dally in the drug trade always have to be careful of their illegal actions. As mentioned above, the drug trade allowed Khun Sa to build schools and other public facilities which helped the economic situation of the village. Since Khun Sa was expelled from Ban Hin Taek, the village slowly started building a tourist industry. The plan was to turn Khun Sa‚Äôs old house into a museum and create new jobs for the locals. ‚ÄúHowever, local authorities are still reluctant to agree to the idea, fearing the village‚Äôs history will be distorted by investors, who may focus only on their own benefits.‚Äù Nevertheless, the village now hosts a resort where people can go mountain biking in the mountains around Ban Hin Taek. The renovation of Khun Sa‚Äôs house was completed and has become a museum. In 2007 the village committee set up a development plan for the village. Resort hotels were to be built in order to accommodate tourists. The committee still fears that investors will abuse Ban Hin Taek, forgoing all of its cultural diversity and customs in favour of profits.Bertil Lintner, ‚ÄúTravel: The Golden Triangle - Golden Getaway,‚Äù Far Eastern Economic Review, Feb 14, 2002, 1.  Culture  Ban Hin Taek population of approximately 3000Joe Cummings, Becca Blond, Morgan Konn, Matt Warren and China Williams, Thailand, Lonely Planet 2005, 351. people is ethnically diverse consisting of Shan, Yunnanese, Akha, Lisu, Lahu, and other tribespeople.Bertil Lintner, ‚ÄúTravel: The Golden Triangle - Golden Getaway,‚Äù Far Eastern Economic Review, Feb 14, 2002, 1. The Akha, who were the founders of Ban Hin Taek as stated earlier, are the predominant tribe. The Akha women wear much silver and often wear striped leggings in order to carry firewood and dry goods up to their homes. The houses in Ban Hin Taek are not built in an Akha style, but instead show signs of Yunnanese influence. They are built of wattle and mud on solid ground instead of the commonly found houses built on stilts. The abundant religions practiced by the villagers are probably the best example to highlight the cultural diversity of Ban Hin Taek. There is a Thai Buddhist wat on the north-eastern edge of the village, a mosque on the western front and a little ways out of Ban Hin Taek, a large Chinese temple resides. Thus, there are many religious places of worship to satisfy most of Ban Hin Taek‚Äôs villagers. Every year Ban Hin Taek celebrates the Songkran Festival. This is less of a cultural tradition than a national tradition, but a tradition nonetheless.Joey and Jon, ‚ÄúSongkran Festival at Ban Hin Taek,‚Äù Youtube.

One of the most prominent features of this quadrangle is a large intersecting set of canyons called Noctis Labyrinthus. Other interesting features are lava channels, Dark slope streaks, pit crater chains, and large troughs (called fossae). Research published in the journal Icarus has found pits in Zumba Crater are caused by hot ejecta falling on ground containing ice. The pits are formed by heat forming steam that rushes out from groups of pits simultaneously, thereby blowing away from the pit ejecta.Boyce, J. et al. 2012.

The top of a stream of lava cools down, thereby forming a solid roof. Meanwhile, the lava continues moving in the tube. Often, when all the lava leaves the tube, the roof collapses, making a channel.http://themis.asu.edu/zoom-20030821a These features are found on Mars. Some can be seen around Pavonis Mons, in the picture below. Some people have suggested that future colonists on Mars could use lava tunnels as shelters. They would offer great protection from radiation, especially ultraviolet radiation. Lava Channels on the flank of the volcano Pavonis Mons are pictured below in a picture from Mars Odyssey THEMIS. Sometimes the lava tube remains intact for a time. Lava will break out along the tube to accumulate or flow away. Lava flows often have a lobate appearance at the edges. A good view of such a lava tube is shown below. Image:Lava tubes Pavonis Mons, Phoenicis Lacus.JPGLava tubes were once covered over with lava flowing in them, but the roofs have now collapsed and the lava has left. Also, some straight troughs (grabens) crosscut the lava channels. Picture taken by THEMIS.

When glaciers melt and retreat, they leave behind material that was carried in and on the ice. Often the material is dropped in a ridge, called a moraine.http://themis.asu.edu/zoom-20030827a An example of moraines is shown in the picture below from the flank of Arsia Mons, a picture taken with the Mars Odyssey THEMIS. Image:Alpine glacier in Phoenicis Lacus.JPGRidges on side of Arsia Mons, a large volcano, may be moraines dropped by glacial activity.  Dark slope streaks  A picture below shows dark streaks on the slopes of Aganippe Fossa. Such streaks are common on Mars. They occur on steep slopes of craters, troughs, and valleys. The streaks are dark at first. They get lighter with age. Sometimes they start in a tiny spot, then spread out and go for hundreds of meters. They have been seen to travel around obstacles, like boulders. It is believed that they are avalanches of bright dust that expose a darker underlying layer. However, several ideas have been advanced to explain them. Some involve water or even the growth of organisms. The streaks appear in areas covered with dust. Much of the Martian surface is covered with dust. Fine dust settles out of the atmosphere covering everything. We know a lot about this dust because the solar panels of the Mars Rovers get covered with dust, thus reducing the electrical energy. The power of the Rovers has been restored many times by the wind, in the form of dust devils, cleaning the panels and boosting the power. So, we know that dust settles from the atmosphere then returns over and over. Dust storms are frequent, especially when the spring season begins in the southern hemisphere. At that time, Mars is 40% closer to the sun. The orbit of Mars is much more elliptical then the Earth's. That is the difference between the farthest point from the sun and the closest point to the sun is very great for Mars, but only a slight amount for the Earth. Also, every few years, the entire planet is engulfed in global dust storms. When NASA's Mariner 9 craft arrived there, nothing could be seen through the dust storm. Other global dust storms have also been observed, since that time. Image:Aganippe Fossa.jpgAganippe Fossa as seen by HiRISE. Full size image shows layers and streaks. Research, published in January 2012 in Icarus, found that dark streaks were initiated by airblasts from meteorites traveling at supersonic speeds. The team of scientists was led by Kaylan Burleigh, an undergraduate at the University of Arizona. After counting some 65,000 dark streaks around the impact site of a group of 5 new craters, patterns emerged. The number of streaks was greatest closer to the impact site. So, the impact somehow probably caused the streaks. Also, the distribution of the streaks formed a pattern with two wings extending from the impact site. The curved wings resembled scimitars, curved knives. This pattern suggests that an interaction of airblasts from the group of meteorites shook dust loose enough to start dust avalanches that formed the many dark streaks. At first it was thought that the shaking of the ground from the impact caused the dust avalanches, but if that was the case the dark streaks would have been arranged symmetrically around the impacts, rather than being concentrated into curved shapes. The crater cluster lies near the equator 510 miles) south of Olympus Mons, on a type of terrain called the Medusae Fossae formation. The formation is coated with dust and contains wind-carved ridges called yardangs. These yardangs have steep slopes thickly covered with dust, so when the sonic boom of the airblast arrived from the impacts dust started to move down the slope. Using photos from Mars Global Surveyor and HiRISE camera on NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, scientists have found about 20 new impacts each year on Mars. Because the spacecraft have been imaging Mars almost continuously for a span of 14 years, newer images with suspected recent craters can be compared to older images to determine when the craters were formed. Since the craters were spotted in a HiRISE image from February 2006, but were not present in a Mars Global Surveyor image taken in May 2004, the impact occurred in that time frame. The largest crater in the cluster is about in diameter with close to the area of a basketball court. As the meteorite traveled through the Martian atmosphere it probably broke up; hence a tight group of impact craters resulted. Dark slope streaks have been seen for some time, and many ideas have been advanced to explain them. This research may have finally solved this mystery.Kaylan J. Burleigh, Henry J. Melosh, Livio L. Tornabene, Boris Ivanov, Alfred S. McEwen, Ingrid J. Daubar. Impact air blast triggers dust avalanches on Mars.

Loose dust moved down steep slopes when it felt the airblast from meteorite strikes. Image is from HiRISE.  Pit crater chains  Pit craters are common near volcanoes in the Tharsis and Elysium system of volcanoes.Skinner, J., L. Skinner, and J. Kargel. 2007. Re-assessment of Hydrovolcanism-based Resurfacing within the Galaxias Fossae Region of Mars. Lunar and Planetary Science XXXVIII (2007) Pit craters form when a void is produced by a cracking of the surface caused by stretching. Also, lava may drain out of an underground chamber, thus leaving an empty space. When material slides into a void, a pit crater or a pit crater chain forms. Pit craters do not have rims or ejecta around them, like impact craters do. On Mars, individual pit craters can join to form chains or even to form troughs that are sometimes scalloped.Wyrick, D., D. Ferrill, D. Sims, and S. Colton. 2003. Distribution, Morphology and Structural Associations of Martian Pit Crater Chains. Lunar and Planetary Science XXXIV (2003) Pit craters are not common on Earth. Sinkholes, where the ground falls into a hole (sometimes in the middle of a town) resemble pit craters on Mars. However, on the Earth these holes are caused by limestone being dissolved thereby causing a void.http://www.swri.edu/4org/d20/DEMPS/planetgeo/planetmars.html The image below of Arsia Chasmata contains a pit crater chain. Image:Arsia Chasmata.JPGArsia Chasmata, as seen by HiRISE. A pit crater chain is visible in the lower right. Fossa on Mars Certain areas on Mars possess large troughs (long narrow depressions) called fossae in the geographical language used for Mars. This term is derived from Latin; therefore fossa is singular and fossae is plural. Troughs form when the crust is stretched until it breaks. The stretching can be due to the large weight of a nearby volcano. Fossae/pit craters are common near volcanoes in the Tharsis and Elysium system of volcanoes. A trough often has two breaks with a middle section moving down, leaving steep cliffs along the sides; such a trough is called a graben. Lake George, in northern New York State, is a lake that sits in a graben. Image:Oti Fossae.JPGOti Fossae, as seen by HiRISE. Go to Fossa (geology) for more information. Image:Oti Fossae.jpgOti Fossae, as seen by THEMIS. These parallel graben are found on the northeastern side of Arsia Mons; they are in line with the NE/SW trend of the three volcanoes in Tharsis.

These parallel graben are found on the northeastern side of Arsia Mons; they are in line with the NE/SW trend of the three volcanoes in Tharsis. Image:Claritas Fossae.jpgClaritas Fossae as seen by HiRISE. Note the steep scarp.  Volcanoes  The most common form of volcanism on the Earth is basaltic. Basalts formed from molten rocks that cooled on the surface. They originated from the partial melting of the upper mantle. They are rich in iron and magnesium (mafic) minerals and commonly dark gray in color. The principal type of volcanism on Mars is probably also basaltic. * Although Mars displays many volcanoes here and other places, there has been no evidence of recent volcanic activity, even at a very low level. Research, published in 2017, found no active release of volcanic gases during two successive Martian years. They looked for the outgassing of sulfur- bearing chemicals with spectrometers.Khayat, A., et al. 2017.

The prominent Valles Marineris chasma system intersects the moderately cratered northern part and the faulted highland ridged plains in the southern part. The Coprates quadrangle is one of a series of 30 quadrangle maps of Mars used by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) Astrogeology Research Program. The Coprates quadrangle is also referred to as MC-18 (Mars Chart-18).Davies, M.E.; Batson, R.M.; Wu, S.S.C. \\"Geodesy and Cartography\\" in Kieffer, H.H.; Jakosky, B.M.; Snyder, C.W.; Matthews, M.S., Eds. Mars. University of Arizona Press: Tucson, 1992. The Coprates quadrangle contains parts of many of the old classical regions of Mars: Sinai Planum, Solis Planum, Thaumasia Planum, Lunae Planum, Noachis Terra, and Xanthe Terra. The name Coprates refers to an old name for a river in Persia.Blunck, J. 1982. Mars and its Satellites. Exposition Press. Smithtown, N.Y. The Coprates quadrangle goes from 45¬∞ to 90¬∞ west longitude and 0¬∞ to 30¬∞ south latitude on Mars. Coprates quadrangle is famous for depicting the \\"Grand Canyon of Mars\\", the Valles Marineris Canyon System. Signs of water exist in this quadrangle, with ancient river valleys and networks of stream channels showing up as inverted terrain and lakes inside of Valles Marineris.Cabrol, N. and E. Grin (eds.). 2010. Lakes on Mars. Elsevier. NY Origin of Name Coprates is the name of a telescopic albedo feature located at 15¬∞ S and 60¬∞ W on Mars. It is named after the Coprates River, an ancient name for the Dez, a tributary of the Karun in modern Iran which empties into the Shatt al-Arab near its Persian Gulf estuary. The name was approved by the International Astronomical Union (IAU) in 1958.  Valles Marineris canyon system  Valles Marineris is the largest canyon system in the solar system; this great canyon would go almost all the way across the United States. The name for the whole system of canyons is Valles Marineris. Starting at the west with Noctis Labyrinthus in the Phoenicis Lacus quadrangle, the canyon system ends in the Margaritifer Sinus quadrangle with Capri Chasma and Eos Chasma (in the south). The word Chasma has been designated by the International Astronomical Union to refer to an elongate, steep-sided depression. Valles Marineris was discovered by and named for the Mariner 9 mission. Moving east from Noctis Labyrinthus, the canyon splits into two troughs, Tithonium Chasma and Ius Chasma (in the south). In the middle of the system are the very wide valleys of Ophir Chasma (north), Candor Chasma, and Melas Chasma (south). Going farther to the east, one comes to Coprates Chasma. At the end of Coprates Chasma, the valley gets wider to form Capri Chasma in the north and Eos Chasma in the south. The walls of the canyons often contain many layers. The floors of some of the canyons contain large deposits of layered materials. Some researchers believe that the layers were formed when water once filled the canyons.McCauley, J. 1978. Geologic map of the Coprates quadrangle of Mars. U.S. Geol. Misc. Inv. Map I-897Weitz, C. and T. Parker. 2000. New evidence that the Valles Marineris interior deposits formed in standing bodies of water. LPSC XXXI. Abstract 1693 The canyons are deep as well as long; in places they are 8-10 kilometers deep, much deeper than the Earth's Grand Canyon, which is only 1.6 kilometers deep. In a study published in the journal Geology in August 2009, a group of scientists led by John Adams of the University of Washington in Seattle proposed that Valles Marineris may have formed from a giant collapse when salts were heated up, thereby releasing water which rushed out carrying mud through underground plumbing. One point that supports this idea is that sulfate salts have been found in the area. These salts contain water which comes off when heated. Heat may have been generated by volcanic processes. After all, a number of huge volcanoes are nearby. Other ideas have been advanced by others to explain the origin of the system.

Interior layered deposits and sulfate Parts of the floors of Candor Chasma and Juventae Chasma contain layered deposits that have been termed interior layered deposits (ILD's) and Equatorial Layered Deposits (ELD's). These layers may have formed when the whole area was a giant lake. However, many other ideas have been advanced to explain them. High-resolution structural and geologic mapping in west Candor Chasma, presented in March 2015, showed that the deposits on the floor of the Candor chasma are basin filling sediments that were deposited in a wet playa like setting; hence water was involved in their formation.Okubo, C. 2015. HIGH-RESOLUTION STRUCTURAL AND GEOLOGIC MAPPING IN CANDOR CHASMA. 46th Lunar and Planetary Science Conference. 1210.pdf Some places on Mars contain hydrated sulfate deposits, including ILD's. Sulfate formation involves the presence of water. The European Space Agency's Mars Express found possible evidence of the sulfates epsomite and kieserite. Scientists want to visit these areas with robotic rovers. These deposits have been found to contain ferric oxides in the form of crystalline grey hematite.  Layers  Images of rocks in the canyon walls almost always show layers.Grotzinger, J. and R. Milliken. 2012. Sedimentary Geology of Mars. SEPM. Some layers appear tougher than others. In the image below of Ganges Chasma Layers, as seen by HiRISE, one can see that the upper, light-toned deposits are eroding much faster than the lower darker layers. Some cliffs on Mars show a few darker layers standing out and often breaking into large pieces; these are thought to be hard volcanic rock instead of soft ash deposits. An example of hard layers is shown below in the picture of layers in the canyon wall in Coprates, as seen by Mars Global Surveyor. Because of its closeness to the Tharsis volcanic region, the rock layers may be made of layer after layer of lava flows, probably mixed with deposits of volcanic ash that fell out of the air following big eruptions. It is likely the rock strata in the walls preserve a long geological history of Mars. Dark layers may be due to dark lava flows. The dark volcanic rock basalt is common on Mars. However, light-toned deposits may have resulted from rivers, lakes, volcanic ash, or wind blown deposits of sand or dust. The Mars Rovers found light-toned rocks to contain sulfates. Probably having been formed in water, sulfate deposits are of great interest to scientists because they may contain traces of ancient life.http://hirise,lpl.arizona.edu/PSP_007430_1725 The Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter Compact Reconnaissance Imaging Spectrometer for Mars (CRISM) instrument found opaline silica in certain strata along and within the Valles Marineris canyon system.Murchie, S. et al. 2009. A synthesis of Martian aqueous mineralogy after 1 Mars year of observations from the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. Journal of Geophysical Research: 114. Because Iron sulfates were sometimes found near the opaline silica, it is thought that the two deposits were formed with an acid fluid.Milliken, R. et al. 2008.

Hebes Chasma and hydrated deposits Hebes Chasma, a large enclosed valley, may have once held water. Hydrated minerals have been found there. It is thought that large-scale underground springs of groundwater at different times burst to the surface to form deposits called Light Toned Deposits (LTD's). Some suggest present or fossilized life forms may be found there because the deposits are relatively young.May Have Played Important Role in Shaping Mars Nirgal Vallis and sapping Nirgal Vallis is one of the longest valley networks on Mars. It is so large that it is found on more than one quadrangle. Scientists do not know how all the ancient river valleys were formed. There is evidence that instead of rain or snow, the water that formed the valleys originated underground. One mechanism that has been advanced is sapping.http://themis.asu.edu/zoom-20030916a In sapping, the ground just gives away as water comes out. Sapping is common in some desert areas in America's Southwest. Sapping forms alcoves and stubby tributaries. These features are visible in the picture below of Nigal Vallis taken with Mars Odyssey's THEMIS. Water from Nirgal Vallis contributed to a great flood that went through the rim of Holden Crater and helped form a lake in the crater. It's estimated that Nirgal Vallis had a discharge of 4800 cubic meters/second. Water from Nirgal Vallis was inbounded in Uzboi Vallis because the rim of Holden Crater blocked the flow. At a certain point the stored water broke through the rim of Holden and created a lake 200‚Äì250 m deep.Grant, J., R. Irwin, S. Wilson. 2010. Aqueous depositional settings in Holden crater, Mars In Cabrol, N. and E. Grin (eds.). 2010. Lakes on Mars. Elsevier. NY. Water with a depth of at least 50 m entered Holden at a rate that 5-10 times the discharge of the Mississippi River. Terraces and the presence of large rocks (tens of meters across) support these high discharge rates.Boothroyd, J. 1983.

Thesis, Los Angeles, California Image:Nirgal Vallis in Coprates.JPGNirgal Vallis that runs in two quadrangles has features looking like those caused by sapping. Picture taken with THEMIS.  Inverted relief  Some areas of Mars show inverted relief, where features that were once depressions, like streams, are now instead above the surface. These may have been formed when materials, like large rocks, were deposited in low-lying areas, then left behind after erosion (perhaps wind which can not move large rocks) removed much of the surface layers. Other ways of making inverted relief might be lava flowing down a stream bed or materials being cemented by minerals dissolved in water. On Earth, materials cemented by silica are highly resistant to all kinds of erosional forces. Inverted relief in the shape of streams are further evidence of water flowing on the Martian surface in past times. There are many examples of inverted channels near Juventae Chasma; some are shown in the image of Juventae Chasma below.Malin, M., et al. 2010. An overview of the 1985-2006 Mars Orbiter Camera science investigation. http://marsjournal.org Image:Juventae Chasma Inverted Channels.JPGInverted Channels near Juventae Chasma, as seen by HiRISE. Channels were once regular stream channels. Scale bar is 500 meters long. Image:Inverted Streams in Juventae Chasma.jpgInverted Streams near Juventae Chasma, as seen by Mars Global Surveyor. These streams begin at the top of a ridge then run together. Vallis Vallis (plural valles) is the Latin word for valley. It is used in planetary geology for the naming of landform features on other planets. Vallis was used for old river valleys that were discovered on Mars, when probes were first sent to Mars. The Viking Orbiters caused a revolution in our ideas about water on Mars; huge river valleys were found in many areas. Space craft cameras showed that floods of water broke through dams, carved deep valleys, eroded grooves into bedrock, and traveled thousands of kilometers.Raeburn, P. 1998.

Rising from humble origins and joining the navy as an able seaman, he had a highly active career, serving under some of the most famous naval commanders of the age of sail, and participating in some of their greatest victories. He was at Grenada and Martinique under Byron and Rodney, the Glorious First of June under Howe; and commanded ships at Cape St Vincent under Jervis, Cape Finisterre under Calder and Trafalgar under Nelson. He finished his career by serving with distinction in the Mediterranean, and died with the rank of Rear-Admiral. Family and early life Prowse appears to have been of very humble origins, little is known about his birth or childhood, but he appears to have been born to a working-class Devon family of Cornish origin in 1752.White, G. Pawley, A Handbook of Cornish Surnames.(Prowse mentioned by name) He probably went to sea aboard merchant ships initially, but is first recorded in the Navy on 13 November 1771 as an able seaman aboard the Hamoaze guardship, the 74-gun . Prowse remained aboard her for the next four years, only leaving her on 26 February 1776. His next posting was to the 74-gun , which he joined in November that year, being rated as midshipman and master's mate on 31 August 1778 by Captain George Bowyer. Prowse and the Albion were by then serving on the North American station, and went on to see action at the Battle of Grenada on 6 July 1779 and the Battle of Martinique on 17 April 1780. Prowse was wounded in one of the clashes at Martinique, being struck in the head by a large splinter.

The Albion was paid off on 21 December 1781 and having passed his examination for lieutenancy on 17 January 1782 and by 6 December 1782 he had received his commission and was on 22 December 1782 appointed to the 90-gun second rate under Captain George Vandeput. Prowse was moved again on 14 April to join the 28-gun sixth rate under Captain Brabazon Christian. Prowse continued to serve off North America until March 1784. Prowse then disappears from naval records, and may have spent several years on merchant ships. He briefly reappears in 1787, when tensions with the Netherlands led to his return to service under his old patron Captain Bowyer, now serving on the 74-gun , but again left the service when the crisis had passed. The Nootka Sound crisis in 1790 led to another mobilisation of the fleet and Prowse returned to the navy, initially serving aboard the 98-gun and then aboard the 64-gun under Captain Robert Calder. The last few years of peace for Prowse were spent aboard Lord Hood's flagship at Portsmouth, the 90-gun , from August 1791 until January 1793. French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars The outbreak of war with France in February 1793 saw Prowse being appointed, on 20 March 1793, to the 90-gun , commanded by Captain Cuthbert Collingwood and flying the flag of Prowse's old commander, now Rear-Admiral Bowyer. He followed both Collingwood and Bowyer when they moved aboard Prowse's old ship the Barfleur on 28 December 1793, Prowse becoming the sixth lieutenant. The Barfleur went on to be part of Lord Howe's fleet, and was present at the Glorious First of June where Bowyer lost a leg, and Prowse too was wounded in the leg when a shot hit and dismounted the gun he was attempting to aim, and tore away part of his thigh. He apparently had to have his leg amputated. thumbrightThe Battle of Cape St Vincent, 14 February 1797 by Robert Cleveley. Prowse narrowly avoided being engaged by several Spanish ships of the line. He was invalided ashore, but recovered quickly and returned to service aboard Robert Calder's 74-gun as his first lieutenant. Calder and the Theseus sailed to the West Indies and after carrying out several minor engagements with French shore batteries, returned to Britain as a convoy escort in July 1795. Calder and Prowse transferred aboard the 32-gun fifth rate and sailed to the Mediterranean to join Sir John Jervis aboard his flagship . Jervis appointed Prowse to his first independent command, the 14-gun sloop on 20 October 1796. Raven was with Jervis's fleet at the Battle of Cape St Vincent on 14 February 1797, and was used to repeat signals. She also, in company with four frigates and another sloop, gave chase to the Spanish four-decker Sant√≠sima Trinidad but they eventually lost her. For his services Jervis promoted Prowse to post-captain on 6 March 1797 and appointed him to command the captured Spanish prize Salvador del Mundo. Prowse took his ship home for paying-off in November but since no ship could be found for him, went on half-pay. He finally returned to active service when Rear-Admiral Sir Robert Calder asked for him to be his flag-captain aboard his flagship . He briefly served in the West Indies, and returned to Britain on the Peace of Amiens in 1802. With the Prince of Wales paid off, Prowse was given command of the 36-gun frigate in August 1802, where he took part in the blockades of the French and Spanish coasts. With the resumption of the war in May 1803 Sirius was deployed into the English Channel and the Bay of Biscay, becoming part of Calder's fleet in 1804. Battle of Cape Finisterre With Calder's fleet patrolling off Cape Finisterre in anticipation of the arrival of the combined Franco-Spanish fleet under Pierre-Charles Villeneuve, Prowse and the Sirius, in company with HMS Egyptienne were despatched to scout for the enemy. Villeneuve had been reported as having arrived in the area and on 22 July Prowse located the allied feet, with the frigate Sir√©ne at the rear, towing a captured merchant. Prowse closed on the Sir√©ne, intending to cut her off and board her, but Villeneuve ordered his ships to wear in succession and reverse their course to meet Calder's advancing fleet. Prowse suddenly found himself facing the entire combined fleet, which was fast bearing down on him, led by the Spanish Admiral Federico Gravina aboard the Argonauta. With his tiny frigate heavily outclassed, Prowse began to beat away to leeward as the fleet passed him on the opposite tack. Gravina, aware of the convention that a ship of the line did not open fire on a frigate, ordered that the Sirius not be fired upon and the next Spanish ships also held fire. Shortly afterwards Calder's van came into range of the fleet and a general action ensued, whereby the Sirius was fired on by the Espa√±a and had two men killed and three wounded. After the battle Prowse was sent to Plymouth with the captured Spanish 74-gun Firme in tow. Nelson and Trafalgar Villeneuve led the rest of his fleet into Cadiz on 21 August 1805, and the Sirius was sent to form part of the British fleet blockading them there. With Nelson's arrival to take command of the fleet, the main body was moved out to sea, with a chain of four frigates and four ships of the line established to observe the fleet in Cadiz and transmit signals about their movements to the British fleet. Sirius was the closest to the port and at first light on 19 October it was observed that the enemy were preparing to put to sea. Sirius immediately signalled the next frigate in the line, Henry Blackwood's , 'Enemy have their topsails hoisted'. Thus Prowse began the process that would lead to the interception of the combined fleet two days later. An hour later at 7 a.m. Sirius ran up three flags to signal code number 370, 'Enemy ships are coming out of port or getting under sail'. The signal was repeated down the line, reaching Nelson 48 miles away aboard HMS Victory at 9.30 a.m. The Battle of Trafalgar, as seen from the mizzen starboard shrouds of the Victory, by J. M. W. Turner. While not directly engaged in the fighting, Prowse played an important role both before and after the battle. The next morning, 20 October 1805, a strange sail was reported off the entrance to the harbour. Prowse asked for and was given permission by Blackwood to investigate, and closed on the stranger. By the time this had been achieved the 74-gun H√©ros had come within range and opened fire. Sirius nevertheless stopped the stranger with a shot across her bow and sent an officer over to inspect her. It was determined that the ship in question was a neutral American merchant, and she was allowed to continue on her way. Prowse recovered the boat and hauled away from the French warship. The entire combined fleet had finally put to sea by 10 a.m., whereupon a burst of rainy squalls caused the frigates to lose sight of it until midday. Prowse and the other frigates continued to shadow the fleet until 7.30 a.m. on 21 October, when Nelson signalled the four frigate captains; Prowse of the Sirius, Blackwood of the Euryalus, Capel of the , and Dundas of the , to come aboard the Victory. There they received their orders for the battle, which were to take station windward of the Victory and so repeat his signals to the rest of the fleet. They were also to observe the progress of the battle, report on escaping ships, take over surrendered enemy ships that had not been taken and take in tow dismasted British ships or their prizes. They then all went below and witnessed Nelson's will. Departing Victory to return to Sirius as the former closed on the enemy line, Prowse said goodbye to his nephew, Captain Charles Adair, who was commander of the marines on Victory. During the battle Sirius maintained her station out of the immediate battle, and suffered no casualties. After its end, she moved in and took the Victory under tow, but as the weather worsened she handed over to the larger 64-gun . The week after the battle Prowse was sent into Cadiz with a note from Collingwood to the Marquis de Solana, requesting the use of the town's facilities for the Spanish prisoners. Continued service and later years Sirius engaged with the French flotilla off the mouth of the River Tiber, in a print by Thomas Whitcombe. The victory was one of Prowse's last engagements. Prowse remained aboard the Sirius in the Mediterranean serving under Vice-Admiral Collingwood. On 17 April 1806 he engaged an enemy flotilla off Civitavecchia. The flotilla consisted of the 18-gun corvette Berg√®re, three armed brigs, a bomb vessel, a cutter and three gunboats. The Berg√®re held off the Sirius until Prowse forced her surrender. For this action Prowse was mentioned in despatches and awarded a sword from the Lloyd's Patriotic Fund. The Sirius was paid off in May 1808 and in March 1810 Prowse took command of the 74-gun HMS Theseus. He was nominated a Companion of the Bath on 4 June 1815, and a Colonel of the Royal Marines on 12 August 1819. He commanded her in the North Sea until 23 December 1813, after which he went onshore and saw no further active service. He was promoted to rear-admiral on 19 July 1821 and died on 23 March 1826 in St Pancras, London at the age of 72.

Early life Pickering was born at Railway Cottage, Shildon, County Durham, England in 1849, the eldest son of John Pickering 1823 - 1900 and Elizabeth Young 1828 - 1890. Robert‚Äôs father at the time of his birth was classified as a \\"British Teacher\\". Robert‚Äôs only sibling Jonathan was born in 1855. By 1861 the family had moved from Railway Cottage to Main Street, Shildon. John Pickering had over the past ten years changed his profession from teacher to proprietor and head of an iron foundry employing 52 men and four boys. Family move to Scotland In 1864 John Pickering moved his family to Scotland and set about constructing his new works in Netherton Wishaw Lanarkshire, which came on stream in 1865. Robert, aged 16, joined his father in the new operation in Wishaw, building railway carriages, wagons and carrying out repairs on rolling stock. In December 1868 at 3 Park Gardens, Glasgow, the home of his in-laws, Robert Young Pickering married Ellen Caldwell Anderson, the daughter of John Anderson, a wealthy Glasgow merchant. Robert and his wife remained at 3 Park Gardens living with her family into the 1880s, this was where his only child was born Robina Ellinor Graham (1873‚Äì1916). He lived with his family until 1896 at 19 Montgomerie Quadrant Kelvinside. He was involved with St Brides church adjacent to this building. Company history Pickering‚Äôs of Wishaw expanded and by 1870 they were employing around 150 men and 50 boys. Over the next few years the tide changed and in 1878 the business was on the verge of collapse with a workforce reduced to 14 men, one foreman and a dog. Robert took control of the business from his father and over the next decade built the business into a thriving railway carriage and wagon fabricators. The expansion included the opening of a second depot at Rawyards, in nearby Airdrie with now a workforce of around 500. To compete as an international player Robert required to raise capital and in 1888 floated the business as a private limited company as R Y Pickering & Co Ltd, with himself as managing director. On the formation of the new company Robert was paid ¬£4,000 in cash and ¬£4,000 in ordinary shares. By 1906 his shares were worth ¬£70,000 however he was no longer the majority shareholder this he had lost back in 1901 to John Wilson a Lanarkshire coal magnate. At the end of the 19th century Robert Young Pickering purchased the Dumfriesshire estate of Conheath and through the Edwardian years carried out major improvements. In the 1901 census we find his nephew John Johnston King Pickering 1880‚Äì1914 son of his brother Jonathan, living with Robert and Ellen at the mansion house of Conheath. John was employed by R Y Pickering & Co Ltd as Roberts assistant. In 1903 Roberts daughter Robina was married in Dumfries to her cousin John J K Pickering. In earlier writings on R Y Pickering, John was referred to as his son, rather than nephew/son-in-law. With the marriage came additional rewards with John being appointed company secretary in 1904. Also in this year John and Robina provided Robert with his only grandchild Christopher Robert Pickering. R Y Pickering & Co Ltd found the first decade of the 20th century challenging times with dwindling profits and the loss of home market share. Expansion of the repair sector helped to offset some of this with new depots in Fife and Sheffield. The company looked at oversees orders in particular India and South Africa. Life must have become very tough for Robert Pickering in 1909, with mounting personal debts, the death of his wife Ellen and company losses of ¬£5,628. By the following year the company loss reached almost ¬£14,000. During 1911 he was removed from the position of managing director the post he held from the formation in 1888 in the company, which held his name. He had no further involvement in the company and retired to the life of a country gentleman at Conheath. Retirement A year after the death of his wife, Robert re-married in the spring of 1910 to Isabelle Edith Jardine the daughter of Sir Alexander Jardine of Applegirth Baronet. Her family resided at Jardine Hall, near Lockerbie part of the founding family of Hong Kong and Jardine and Matheson. Her mother was Henrietta Younger of the Scottish brewing family. His life in retirement enabled Robert to indulge in his passion for books, and to house them he extended Conheath in 1919 with a new library and billiard room, using the Ayr architect James Morris. This was not the first time he had employed Morris, in 1909 he was engaged to design a new family chapel in the Baroque style. Much of the Morris designs were never built probably due to financial restraints and a more modest Arts and Crafts design were produced by Sir Robert Lorimer. The chapel was not completed until the late 1920s. Lorimer also designed Conheath Farmhouse in 1916 in the arts and crafts style. Robert‚Äôs daughter Robina died in an Edinburgh nursing home in 1916 leaving his grandson Christopher an orphan, his father John J K Pickering having died two years earlier at the age of 34 in Natal, South Africa. Robert Young Pickering died at Conheath at the age of 82 and his second wife Isabel Edith (Jardine) died the following year. Both were interred at Conheath Chapel, with his first wife and daughter in the family crypt. The Chapel with surrounding policies is the only part of Conheath estate to remain in the ownership of the Pickering family (Ralph Pickering of Kintradwell) to this day. At his death Robert left an estate of ¬£11,126, beside a number of small legacies, his grandson Christopher inherited everything including Conheath Estate. In 1933 the tenanted farm was sold for ¬£6,500 and the mansion house and grounds a few years later. Christopher left Britain and settled in Cape Town where he was a government official, he married first Georgina Martin Gilmour, at Cathcart Glasgow in 1932 and divorced 1935, he later married c. 1950 Mignonne Jean 16 years his junior (died 2008 Cape Town). On 29 May 1951 Christopher‚Äôs daughter Robin Anne was born to continue the Pickering dynasty.

Most of the region contains heavily cratered highlands, marked with large expanses of chaotic terrain. In the northwestern part, the major rift zone of Valles Marineris connects with a broad canyon filled with chaotic terrain. The Margaritifer Sinus quadrangle is one of a series of 30 quadrangle maps of Mars used by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) Astrogeology Research Program. The Margaritifer Sinus quadrangle is also referred to as MC-19 (Mars Chart-19).Davies, M.E.; Batson, R.M.; Wu, S.S.C. \\"Geodesy and Cartography\\" in Kieffer, H.H.; Jakosky, B.M.; Snyder, C.W.; Matthews, M.S., Eds.

Margaritifer Sinus quadrangle contains Margaritifer Terra and parts of Xanthe Terra, Noachis Terra, Arabia Terra, and Meridiani Planum. The name of this quadrangle means \\"pearl bay\\" after the pearl coast at Cape Comorin in South India.Blunck, J. 1982. Mars and its Satellites. Exposition Press. Smithtown, N.Y. This quadrangle shows many signs of past water with evidence of lakes, deltas, ancient rivers, inverted channels, and chaos regions that released water.Grotzinger, J. and R. Milliken (eds.) 2012. Sedimentary Geology of Mars. SEPM Margaritifer Sinus contains some of the longest lake-chain systems on Mars, perhaps because of a wetter climate, more groundwater, or some of each factor. The Samara/Himera lake-chain system is about 1800 km long; the Parara/Loire valley network and lake-chain system is about 1100 km long.Fassett, C. and J. Head III. 2008. Valley network-fed, open-basin lakes on Mars: Distribution and implications for Noachian surface and subsurface hydrology. Icarus: 198. 39-56. A low area between Parana Valles and Loire Vallis is believed to have once held a lake.Goldspiel, J. and S. Squyres. 2000. Groundwater sapping and valley formation on Mars. Icarus. 89: 176-192. The 154 km diameter Holden Crater also once held a lake.Cabrol, N. and E. Grin (eds.). 2010. Lakes on Mars. Elsevier. NY. Near Holden Crater is a graben, called Erythraea Fossa, that once held a chain of three lakes.Buhler, P. et al. 2011. Evidence for palelakes in Erythracea Fossa, Mars: Implications for an ancient hydrological cycle. Icarus. 213: 104‚Äì115. This region contains abundant clay-bearing sediments of Noachian age. Spectral studies with CRISM showed Fe/Mg-phyllosilicates, a type of clay. Biological materials can be preserved in clay. It is believed that this clay was formed in near-neutral pH water. The clay was not mixed with sulfates which form under acid conditions. Life is probably more likely to form under neutral pH conditions.Thomas, R., et al. 2017.

Rock and mineral discoveries at Meridiani Planum The rock \\"Berry Bowl\\". This image, taken by the microscopic imager, reveals shiny, spherical objects embedded within the trench wall \\"Blueberries\\" (hematite spheres) on a rocky outcrop at Eagle Crater. Note the merged triplet in the upper left. Opportunity Rover found that the soil at Meridiani Planum was very similar to the soil at Gusev crater and Ares Vallis; however in many places at Meridiani the soil was covered with round, hard, gray spherules that were named \\"blueberries.\\"Yen, A., et al. 2005. An integrated view of the chemistry and mineralogy of martian soils. Nature. 435.: 49-54. These blueberries were found to be composed almost entirely of the mineral hematite. It was decided that the spectra signal spotted from orbit by Mars Odyssey was produced by these spherules. After further study it was decided that the blueberries were concretions formed in the ground by water.Bell, J (ed.) The Martian Surface. 2008. Cambridge University Press. Over time, these concretions weathered from what was overlying rock, and then became concentrated on the surface as a lag deposit. The concentration of spherules in bedrock could have produced the observed blueberry covering from the weathering of as little as one meter of rock.Squyres, S. et al. 2004. The Opportunity Rover's Athena Science Investigation at Meridiani Planum, Mars. Science: 1698-1703.Soderblom, L., et al. 2004. Soils of Eagle Crater and Meridiani Planum at the Opportunity Rover Landing Site. Science: 306. 1723-1726. Most of the soil consisted of olivine basalt sands that did not come from the local rocks. The sand may have been transported from somewhere else.Christensen, P., et al. Mineralogy at Meridiani Planum from the Mini-TES Experiment on the Opportunity Rover. Science: 306. 1733‚Äì1739. File:Meridianiblueberries.jpgDrawing showing how \\"blueberries\\" came to cover much of surface in Meridiani Planum. Minerals in dust A M√∂ssbauer spectrum was made of the dust that gathered on Opportunity's capture magnet. The results suggested that the magnetic component of the dust was titanomagnetite, rather than just plain magnetite, as was once thought. A small amount of olivine was also detected which was interpreted as indicating a long arid period on the planet. On the other hand, a small amount of hematite that was present meant that there may have been liquid water for a short time in the early history of the planet.Goetz, W., et al. 2005. Indication of drier periods on Mars from the chemistry and mineralogy of atmospheric dust. Nature: 436.62-65. Because the Rock Abrasion Tool (RAT) found it easy to grind into the bedrocks, it is thought that the rocks are much softer than the rocks at Gusev crater. Bedrock minerals Few rocks were visible on the surface where Opportunity landed, but bedrock that was exposed in craters was examined by the suit of instruments on the Rover.Bell, J., et al. 2004. Pancam Multispectral Imaging Results from the Opportunity Rover at Meridiani Planum. Science: 306.1703-1708. Bedrock rocks were found to be sedimentary rocks with a high concentration of sulfur in the form of calcium and magnesium sulfates. Some of the sulfates that may be present in bedrocks are kieserite, sulfate anhydrate, bassanite, hexahydrite, epsomite, and gypsum. Salts, such as halite, bischofite, antarcticite, bloedite, vanthoffite, or glauberite may also be present.Christensen, P., et al. 2004 Mineralogy at Meridiani Planum from the Mini-TES Experiment on the Opportunity Rover. Science: 306. 1733-1739.Squyres, S. et al. 2004. In Situ Evidence for an Ancient Aqueous Environment at Meridian Planum, Mars. Science: 306. 1709-1714. The rocks containing the sulfates had a light tone compared to isolated rocks and rocks examined by landers/rovers at other locations on Mars. The spectra of these light toned rocks, containing hydrated sulfates, were similar to spectra taken by the Thermal Emission Spectrometer on board the Mars Global Surveyor. The same spectrum is found over a large area, so it is believed that water once appeared over a wide region, not just in the area explored by Opportunity Rover.Hynek, B. 2004. Implications for hydrologic processes on Mars from extensive bedrock outcrops throughout Terra Meridiani. Nature: 431. 156-159. The Alpha Particle X-ray Spectrometer (APXS) found rather high levels of phosphorus in the rocks. Similar high levels were found by other rovers at Ares Vallis and Gusev Crater, so it has been hypothesized that the mantle of Mars may be phosphorus-rich.Dreibus,G. and H. Wanke. 1987. Volatiles on Earth and Marsw: a comparison. Icarus. 71:225-240 The minerals in the rocks could have originated by acid weathering of basalt. Because the solubility of phosphorus is related to the solubility of uranium, thorium, and rare earth elements, they are all also expected to be enriched in rocks.Rieder, R., et al. 2004. Chemistry of Rocks and Soils at Meridiani Planum from the Alpha Particle X-ray Spectrometer. Science. 306. 1746-1749 When Opportunity Rover traveled to the rim of Endeavour crater, it soon found a white vein that was later identified as being pure gypsum. It was formed when water carrying gypsum in solution deposited the mineral in a crack in the rock. A picture of this vein, called \\"Homestake\\" formation, is shown below. Evidence for water Cross-bedding features in rock \\"Last Chance\\" Examination of Meridiani rocks found strong evidence for past water. The mineral called jarosite which only forms in water was found in all bedrocks. This discovery proved that water once existed in Meridiani PlanumKlingelhofer, G. et al. 2004. Jarosite and Hematite at Meridiani Planum from Opportunity's Mossbauer Spectrometer. Science: 306. 1740-1745. In addition, some rocks showed small laminations (layers) with shapes that are only made by gently flowing water.Herkenhoff, K., et al. 2004. Evidence from Opportunity's Microscopic Imager for Water on Meridian Planum. Science: 306. 1727-1730 The first such laminations were found in a rock called \\"The Dells.\\" Geologists would say that the cross-stratification showed festoon geometry from transport in subaqueous ripples. A picture of cross-stratification, also called cross- bedding, is shown on the left. Box-shaped holes in some rocks were caused by sulfates forming large crystals, and then when the crystals later dissolved, holes, called vugs, were left behind. The concentration of the element bromine in rocks was highly variable probably because it is very soluble. Water may have concentrated it in places before it evaporated. Another mechanism for concentrating highly soluble bromine compounds is frost deposition at night that would form very thin films of water that would concentrate bromine in certain spots. File:17-jg-03-mi2-B035R1_br.jpgVoids or \\"vugs\\" inside the rock Rock from impact One rock, \\"Bounce Rock\\", found sitting on the sandy plains was found to be ejecta from an impact crater. Its chemistry was different than the bedrocks. Containing mostly pyroxene and plagioclase and no olivine, it closely resembled a part, Lithology B, of the shergottite meteorite EETA 79001, a meteorite known to have come from Mars. Bounce rock received its name by being near an airbag bounce mark. Meteorites Opportunity Rover found meteorites just sitting on the plains. The first one analyzed with Opportunity's instruments was called \\"Heatshield Rock,\\" as it was found near where Opportunity's headshield landed. Examination with the Miniature Thermal Emission Spectrometer (Mini-TES), Mossbauer spectrometer, and APXS lead researchers to, classify it as an IAB meteorite. The APXS determined it was composed of 93% iron and 7% nickel. The cobble named \\"Fig Tree Barberton\\" is thought to be a stony or stony-iron meteorite (mesosiderite silicate),Squyres, S., et al. 2009. Exploration of Victoria Crater by the Mars Rover Opportunity. Science: 1058-1061.Schroder,C., et al. 2008. J. Geophys. Res.: 113. while \\"Allan Hills,\\" and \\"Zhong Shan\\" may be iron meteorites. File:PIA07269-Mars Rover Opportunity-Iron Meteorite.jpgHeat Shield Rock was the first meteorite ever identified on another planet. File:Opportunity heat shield Sol335B P2364 L456-B339R1.jpgHeat shield, with Heat Shield Rock just above and to the left in the background. Geological history Observations at the site have led scientists to believe that the area was flooded with water a number of times and was subjected to evaporation and desiccation. In the process sulfates were deposited. After sulfates cemented the sediments, hematite concretions grew by precipitation from groundwater. Some sulfates formed into large crystals which later dissolved to leave vugs. Several lines of evidence point toward an arid climate in the past billion years or so, but a climate supporting water, at least for a time, in the distant past.Clark, B. et al.

Geologic History of margaitifer Basin, Mars: Evidence for a Prolonged Yet Episodic Hydrologic System. 46th Lunar and Planetary Science Conference (2015) 1463.pdf Vallis Vallis (plural valles) is the Latin word for \\"valley\\". It is used in planetary geology for the naming of valley landform features on other planets. Vallis was used for old river valleys that were discovered on Mars, when probes were first sent to Mars. The Viking Orbiters caused a revolution in our ideas about water on Mars; huge river valleys were found in many areas. Space craft cameras showed that floods of water broke through dams, carved deep valleys, eroded grooves into bedrock, and traveled thousands of kilometers.Raeburn, P. 1998. Uncovering the Secrets of the Red Planet Mars. National Geographic Society. Washington, D.C.Moore, P. et al. 1990. The Atlas of the Solar System. Mitchell Beazley Publishers, New York. Nirgal Vallis is a tributary of Uzboi Vallis. Nirgal Vallis is believed to have formed by groundwater sapping, not by precipitation. Spectral analyses has found phyllosilicates (clays) that are iron-magnesium smectites.Buczkowski D. et al. 2010. LPS XLI Abstract #1458.Buczkowski D. et al. 2013. LPS XLIV Abstract #2331. Some researchers believe these were formed by interaction with groundwater. Over a wide area, Al-smectites are found on top of Fe/Mg smectites.Buczkowski, D., K. Seelos, C. Beck, S. Murchie. 2015.

Branched streams, studied by the Orbiters in the southern hemisphere, suggested that rain once fell. Image:Dissected Channels, as seen by Viking.jpgThe branched channels seen by Viking from orbit strongly suggested that it rained on Mars in the past. Image is located in Margaritifer Sinus quadrangle  Aureum Chaos  Aureum Chaos is a major canyon system and collapsed area. It is probably a major source of water for large outflow channels. Large outflow channels on Mars are believed to be caused by catastrophic discharges of ground water. Many of the channels begin in chaotic terrain, where the ground has apparently collapsed. In the collapsed section, blocks of undisturbed material be seen. The OMEGA experiment on Mars Express discovered clay minerals (phyllosilicates) in a variety of places in Aureum Chaos. Clay minerals need water to form, so the area may once have contained large amounts of water. Scientists are interested in determining what parts of Mars contained water because evidence of past or present life may be found there.

Image:Aureum Chaos HiWish.JPGClose up view of previous image, as seen by HiRISE under HiWish program. Small round dots are boulders. Layers Many places on Mars show rocks arranged in layers. Rock can form layers in a variety of ways. Volcanoes, wind, or water can produce layers. A detailed discussion of layering with many Martian examples can be found in Sedimentary Geology of Mars.Grotzinger, J. and R. Milliken (eds.). 2012. Sedimentary Geology of Mars. SEPM. Sometimes the layers are of different colors. Light-toned rocks on Mars have been associated with hydrated minerals like sulfates.Weitz, C. et al. 2017. LIGHT-TONED MATERIALS OF MELAS CHASMA: EVIDENCE FOR THEIR FORMATION ON MARS. Lunar and Planetary Science XLVIII (2017) 2794.pdfWeitz C., et al. 2015. Icarus: 251: 291-314Weitz, C. 2016.

Planetary and Space Science: 86, 130-149. The Mars Rover Opportunity examined such layers close up with several instruments. Some layers are probably made up of fine particles because they seem to break up into find dust. Other layers break up into large boulders so they are probably much harder. Basalt, a volcanic rock, is thought to in the layers that form boulders. Basalt has been identified on Mars in many places. Instruments on orbiting spacecraft have detected clay (also called phyllosilicate) in some layers. A detailed discussion of layering with many Martian examples can be found in Sedimentary Geology of Mars. Layers can be hardened by the action of groundwater. Martian ground water probably moved hundreds of kilometers, and in the process it dissolved many minerals from the rock it passed through. When ground water surfaces in low areas containing sediments, water evaporates in the thin atmosphere and leaves behind minerals as deposits and/or cementing agents. Consequently, layers of dust could not later easily erode away since they were cemented together. , ESP 039708 1765lightlayers.jpgLight and dark layers, as seen by HiRISE under HiWish program.

Both Holden Crater and Eberswalde Crater made the cut to be among the top four. Miyamoto Crater was in the top seven sites chosen. Holden Crater is believed to have once been a lake. Actually, it is now believed that it held two lakes.Grant, J., et al. 2008. HiRISE imaging of impact megabreccia and sub-meter aqueous strata in Holden Crater, Mars. Geology. 36: 195-198. The first was longer lived and was formed from drainage within the crater and precipitation. The last lake began when water damed up in Uzboi Vallis broke through a divide, then rapidly drained into Holden Crater. Because there are rocks meters in diameter on the crater floor, it is thought it was a powerful flood when water flowed into the crater.

Image:Holden Crater Close- up.JPGClose-up of Channels on Rim of Holden Crater, as seen by THEMIS. Click on image to see more details. Eberswalde Crater contains a delta.NASA Narrows List of Next Mars Landing Sites. Irene Klotz, 21 November 2008. (Discovery News) There is a great deal of evidence that Miyamoto Crater once contained rivers and lakes. Many minerals, such as clays, chlorides, sulfates, and iron oxides, have been discovered there.Murchie, S. et al. 2009. A synthesis of Martian aqueous mineralogy after 1 Mars year of observations from the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. Journal of Geophysical Research: 114. These minerals are often formed in water. A picture below shows an inverted channel in Miyamoto Crater. Inverted channels formed from accumulated sediments that were cemented by minerals. These channels eroded into the surface, then the whole area was covered over with sediments. When the sediments were later eroded away, the place where the river channel existed remained because the hardened material that was deposited in the channel was resistant to erosion. Iani Chaos, pictured below, was among the top 33 landing sites. Deposits of hematite and gypsum have been found there. Those minerals are usually formed in connection with water. Image:Iani Chaos.JPGIani Chaos, as seen by THEMIS. Sand from eroding mesas is covering brighter floor material. Click on image to see relationship of Iani Chaos to other local features. Image:Landing zone in Iani Chaos.JPGLanding zone in Iani Chaos, as seen by THEMIS. The aim of the Mars Science Laboratory is to search for signs of ancient life. It is hoped that a later mission could then return samples from sites that the Mars Science Laboratory identified as probably containing remains of life. To safely bring the craft down, a 12-mile-wide, smooth, flat circle is needed. Geologists hope to examine places where water once ponded. They would like to examine sediment layers. In the end, it was decided to send the Mars science Laboratory, called \\"Curiosity,\\" to Gale Crater in the Aeolis quadrangle.\\"  Inverted relief  Some places on Mars show inverted relief. In these locations, a stream bed may be a raised feature, instead of a valley. The inverted former stream channels may be caused by the deposition of large rocks or due to cementation. In either case erosion would erode the surrounding land and leave the old channel as a raised ridge because the ridge will be more resistant to erosion. An image below, taken with HiRISE of Miyamoto Crater shows a ridge that is an old channel that has become inverted. Image:Miyamoto Crater.JPG Inverted Channel in Miyamoto Crater, as seen by HiRISE. The scale bar is 500 meters long. Image:Inverted terrain context image.JPGCTX context image for next image that was taken with HiRISE. Note long ridge going across image is probably an old stream. Box indicates area for HiRISE image. Image:Inverted terrain in Parana Valles.JPGExample of inverted terrain in Parana Valles region, as seen by HiRISE under the HiWish program.  Deltas  Researchers have found a number of examples of deltas that formed in Martian lakes. Finding deltas is a major sign that Mars once had a lot of water. Deltas often require deep water over a long period of time to form. Also, the water level needs to be stable to keep sediment from washing away. Deltas have been found over a wide geographical range. Below, are pictures of a few.Irwin III, R. et al. 2005. An intense terminal epoch of widespread fluvial activity on early Mars: 2. Increased runoff and paleolake development.

As craters get larger (greater than 10 km in diameter) they usually have a central peak. The peak is caused by a rebound of the crater floor following the impact. Sometimes craters will display layers. Craters can show us what lies deep under the surface. In December 2011, Opportunity Rover discovered a vein of gypsum sticking out of the soil along the rim of Endeavour crater.. Tests confirmed that it contained calcium, sulfur, and water. The mineral gypsum is the best match for the data. It likely formed from mineral rich water moving through a crack in the rock. The vein, called \\"Homestake,\\" is in Mars' Meridiani plain. It could have been produced in conditions more neutral than the harshly acidic conditions indicated by the other sulfate deposits; hence this environment may have been more hospitable for a large variety of living organisms. Homestake is in a zone where the sulfate-rich sedimentary bedrock of the plains meets older, volcanic bedrock exposed at the rim of Endeavour crater.

The district includes a number of high quality houses representing a cross section of fashionable housing built between 1860 and 1920. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1990. Description and history Nobility Hill is roughly defined as a rectangular area bounded on the north and west by Cedar Avenue, on the south by Maple Street, and on the east by Chestnut Street. The area is located a few blocks west of Main Street and Stoneham's Central Square. Maple and Chestnut Streets are both roads laid out early in the 19th century as through streets. The early significant development in this area was made by some of Stoneham's wealthiest residents (thus giving it its name), notably John Hill and H. H. Mawhinney, both owners of shoe factories, and C. W. Tidd, owner of the Tidd Tannery. The land that made up Hill's estate stands outside the district, on the south side of Maple Street, while Mawhinney's was located on the east side of Chestnut Street, where several houses now stand within the district. The Tidd estate was located in the area mostly occupied by Cedar Avenue and Poplar Street. Neither the Tidd nor Mawhinney estate houses survive, although stone walls and a gate survive from Tidd's, incongruously set in front of mid-20th century ranch houses. The earliest architectural style to appear in the district is the Italianate, as typified in the house at 35 Chestnut, built about 1860, and a trio of houses at 9, 11, and 13 Cedar, built about 1870. Probably the finest example of the style in the district is the Charles Wood House at 34 Chestnut. The best example of Second Empire architecture is the c. 1870 Lorenzo D. Hawkins House at 1 Cedar. Stick style and Queen Anne houses are probably the most numerous in the district, with particularly fine examples in the Sidney A. Hill House, Newton Lamson House, and the Franklin B. Jenkins House, all in a row at 31-35 Chestnut. The latest building to contribute to the area's significance is the Dutch Colonial at 45 Maple Street; it was built about 1915.

It is one of the finest Greek Revival houses in Stoneham, recognized as much for its elaborate interior detailing as it is for its exterior features. Originally located at 434 Main Street, it was moved to its present location in 2003 after being threatened with demolition. The house was found to be eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984, but was not listed due to owner objection. In 1990 it was listed as a contributing resource to the Central Square Historic District at its old location. It was listed on its own at its new location in 2005. Description and history The Sweetser House is located at the northeast corner of Franklin Street and Dale Court, a short way east of the center of Stoneham. Franklin Street is a major east‚Äìwest through street connecting Stoneham to neighboring Melrose. The house is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a front-facing gable roof and a modern concrete foundation. Most of the house is sheathed in clapboard siding, but the front is entirely finished in flushboarding, as is part of the right side. The corners of the building are pilastered, with an entablature that encircles the building. The front facade, facing south, has a single-story hip-roof porch extending across its width and around to the right, supported by Doric columns. The facade is four bays wide, with full-length windows on the ground floor and smaller sash windows above. There are two sash windows in the fully pedimented gable end. The porch on the right side ends in a projecting section that houses the main entrance and a stairwell. Each side of the roof has a single gable-roofed dormer. The interior of the house consists of a mix of Greek Revival elements overlaid by Victorian and Colonial Revival alterations, most of which date to the buildings conversion to a duplex in the 1890s. Room dividers with leaded glass and wooden spindled screens were added to the downstairs rooms, and similarly styled elements were overlaid on some windows. A complex bookcase system was added to separate the two public parlors. The house originally stood at 434 Main Street, a short way south of Stoneham's Central Square. It was built on that site in 1842 by Warren Sweetser, a prominent figure in the town's economic life in the 19th century. Sweetser owned a local dry goods retail store, and served for many years as the town postmaster. He was also involved in a small scale in the town's cottage shoemaking industry, which dominated its economy. Because Stoneham's economy grew slowly during the time the Greek Revival was in vogue, this house is one of its few high-style houses in that style. After Warren Sweetser died in 1890, his heirs converted his house to a duplex, adding the entrance tower to the right, the dormers on the roof, and a modern service ell to the rear. The house was sold out of the Sweetser family in 1929, and was eventually converted to commercial use, given its proximity to Central Square. In 1999 it was purchased by a developer, who announced plans to raze the building and redevelop the site. The town located a preservationist will to buy and move the structure, which was moved to a temporary location later that year. It was moved to its present location in 2000, although the lot is too small to accommodate the 1890s service ell, which was demolished.

Built c. 1826, this 2-1/2 wood frame house is one of Stonham's best-preserved late Federal period houses. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984. Description and history The Caleb Wiley House is set on the north side of North Street, a major east-west route through residential areas of northwestern Stoneham, amid 20th-century residential houses that are mostly on smaller lots. It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame house, five bays wide, with a side-gable roof, twin rear-wall chimneys, clapboard siding, and a granite foundation. Window and door surrounds are simple, with the second-floor windows butting against the cornice, a typical Federal period feature. Its front door is sheltered by a portico that is early 20th century in appearance, and has flanking sidelight windows. A screen porch is attached to the left side, and a modern addition is attached to the rear. The house was built about 1826 by Caleb Wiley, at a time when North Street was lined with larger properties mainly in agricultural use. The original lot of this house has long since been subdivided into residences, but this property retains mature plantings, and the main house is relatively little-altered since its construction.

He has published five novels to date, and is represented by the Hong Kong-based Peony Literary Agency. He is also involved in music production. In May 2010, Han Han was named one of the most influential people in the world by Time magazine. In September 2010, British magazine New Statesman listed Han Han at 48th place in the list of \\"The World's 50 Most Influential Figures 2010\\". In June 2010, Han Han was interviewed by CNN as China's rebel writer who has become the unofficial voice for his generation. Early life and increasing prominence Han's first essay, Unhappy Days (‰∏çÂø´‰πêÂú∞Ê∑∑Êó•Â≠ê), was published when he was attending junior middle school. He was admitted to Shanghai's Song Jiang No. 2 High School (‰∏äÊµ∑Â∏ÇÊùæÊ±ü‰∫å‰∏≠) based on his sporting achievements. During his first year of high school (1999), Han won first prize in China's New Concept Writing Competition with his essay, Seeing Ourselves in a Cup (ÊùØ‰∏≠Á™•‰∫∫), on the Chinese national character. Failing seven subjects at the year-end examination, Han was retained for a year in school. This incident was reported in the media and ignited a heated debate on China's \\"quality education\\" (Á¥†Ë¥®ÊïôËÇ≤) policy, whether holistic or specialised learning should be implemented in schools, and other educational issues. Following another seven subject failure in the senior middle school second year examinations, Han quit school. After dropping out of school, Han worked on a series of essays - One Degree Below Freezing (Èõ∂‰∏ã‰∏ÄÂ∫¶), Press Release 2003 (ÈÄöÁ®ø 2003), And I Drift (Â∞±Ëøô‰πàÊºÇÊù•ÊºÇÂéª), and Miscellaneous Essays (ÊùÇÁöÑÊñá). His essays were accepted into various publications. Han's first novel, Triple Door (‰∏âÈáçÈó®), on life as a third-year junior school student in Shanghai, raised his prominence in China outside Shanghai. With over twenty million copies printed, this novel is China's bestselling literary work in the last 20 years. Other novels - Like a Speeding Youth (ÂÉèÂ∞ëÂπ¥Âï¶È£ûÈ©∞), Riot in Chang'an City (ÈïøÂÆâ‰π±), A Fortress (‰∏ÄÂ∫ßÂüéÊ±†), Glory Days (ÂÖâËç£Êó•), His Kingdom (‰ªñÁöÑÂõΩ) were also published during this time. Fueled by his love of racing, Han became a professional rally driver and wrote less frequently. However, he continued to blog on current affairs, with some articles attracting a large number of readers and sparking intense debates. Han's blog has registered well over 300 million hits, the largest online following of a personal blog in China.\\"China's Literary Bad Boy\\" by Simon Elegant in TIME Asia, vol.174, no.17, November 2, 2009, p.28 In February 2005, a Hollywood movie was planned with the script to be based on Chinese writer Xie Hang's novel, Dysmenorrhoea (ÁóõÁªè), and filming to take place in a northern Chinese city. As Han's image suited him to play the male lead role, the Chinese partner company recommended him for the role to the American producers. When media outlets asked Han for his views on this matter, he replied, \\"I have yet to receive this invitation, but basically I would reject it.\\" He explained, \\"It doesn't matter that this is a Hollywood movie, as my decision would depend on who's playing the female lead.\\" On hearing that the script was about the forbidden love between a boy and his female teacher, Han laughed and rejected the role, saying, \\"This makes it even more difficult for me, I will not play such a role.\\" Han is also involved in music production. His debut album, R-18 (ÂçÅÂÖ´Á¶Å, restricted to 18 and above), was released in September 2006, with all lyrics self-composed. In 2014, he became the product ambassador of Oneplus smartphone brand in China. Controversies The Han- Bai controversy On 2 March 2006, Chinese literary critic and bookseller Bai Ye (ÁôΩÁÉ®) published a blog post entitled, Status and Future of the Post-80 Generation (‚Äù80Âêé‚ÄúÁé∞Áä∂‰∏éÊú™Êù•), a harsh criticism of the works of writers born in the 1980-1989 period. Han responded critically with his online article The \\"Literary Circle\\" Is Bullshit, Don't Act F**king Pretentious (ÊñáÂùõÊòØ‰∏™Â±Å Ë∞ÅÈÉΩÂà´Ë£ÖÈÄº). This exchange escalated into the \\"Han-Bai controversy\\", with both sides arguing on issues such as the post-80 classification, whether the works of post-80s qualified as literature and whether post-80 writers should be considered real writers. On 4 March 2006, Bai published an online article entitled My Declaration - a Reply to Han Han (ÊàëÁöÑÂ£∞Êòé - ÂõûÂ∫îÈü©ÂØí), stating that Han's articles in this exchange had crossed the boundaries of literary debate into the realm of humiliation and personal attack. Subsequently, writer Lu Tianming (ÈôÜÂ§©Êòé), his director son Lu Chuan (ÈôÜÂ∑ù), and musician Gao Xiaosong (È´òÊôìÊùæ), entered the debate, which became the focus of the online community for a time. Han debated with the above personalities on his blog. The debate finally concluded with Bai, Lu Tianming, Lu Chuan, and Gao shutting down their personal blogs. Han against Modern Poetry Questioning the value of modern Chinese free verse, Han posted a blog article on 26 September 2006 entitled Why do modern poetry and poets still exist? (Áé∞‰ª£ËØóÂíåËØó‰∫∫‰∏∫‰ªÄ‰πàËøòÂ≠òÂú®). In this and other related articles, he parodied modern Chinese poets including the late Xu Zhimo (ÂæêÂøóÊë©) and the late Hai Zi (Êµ∑Â≠ê), igniting a controversy involving poets such as the Lower Body Poet Shen Haobo, Yang Li (Êù®Èªé), Yi Sha (‰ºäÊ≤ô), and Dong Li (‰∏úÁØ±), and claimed that 'both modern poets and poems are no longer in need of existence, and the genre of modern poetry is meaningless'(Áé∞‰ª£ËØóÊ≠åÂíåËØó‰∫∫ÈÉΩÊ≤°ÊúâÂ≠òÂú®ÁöÑÂøÖË¶Å,Áé∞‰ª£ËØóËøôÁßç‰ΩìË£Å‰πüÊòØÊ≤°ÊúâÊÑè‰πâÁöÑ). This raised anger from Lower body poets. Shen Haobo wrote in his blog: 'The genuine novelists can never sell more than Han Han's rubbish work. This is the best writers and poets' own choice, and nothing to complain. However, Han Hans still hate these all.' (ÁúüÊ≠£ÁöÑÂ∞èËØ¥ÂÆ∂‰ª¨Ê∞∏ËøúÂçñ‰∏çËøáÈü©ÂØíÁöÑÊñáÂ≠óÂûÉÂúæ„ÄÇËøôÊòØ‰ºòÁßÄÁöÑ‰ΩúÂÆ∂ÂíåËØó‰∫∫ÁöÑËá™ÊàëÈÄâÊã©ÔºåÊ≤°‰ªÄ‰πàÂèØÊä±ÊÄ®ÁöÑ„ÄÇ‰ΩÜÊòØÔºåÈü©ÂØí‰ª¨‰ªçÁÑ∂‰ºö‰ªáËßÜËøô‰∏ÄÂàá) When newspaper called Shen Haobo for an interview, Shen said he wouldn't talk about human's sense to a donkey (ÂØπ‰∏ÄÂ§¥È©¥Â∞±‰∏çÁî®ËÆ≤‰∫∫ÁöÑÈÅìÁêÜ) so there is nothing to talk about. Han- Zheng controversy On 10 April 2007, Han criticised rock singer Zheng Jun's (ÈÉëÈíß) capriciousness in a blog post entitled Some Recent Arrangements (ÊúÄËøëÁöÑ‰∏Ä‰∫õÂÆâÊéí), igniting a debate between the two. In 2006, Zheng condemned the Super Girl singing competition (Ë∂ÖÁ∫ßÂ•≥Â£∞) as being \\"unbearably disgusting\\", but participated in the judging for a similar competition Super Boy (Âø´‰πêÁî∑Â£∞) in 2007. Ghostwriting allegation On 15 January 2012, the blogger, technology entrepreneur, and former Baidu employee Mai Tian alleged in a blog post that the majority of Han's work was produced by a team of ghostwriters. Mai Tian claimed that Han Han's early work, including Triple Door, was in fact produced by Han's father, Han Renjun, a literature aficionado who was forced to leave university due to his condition of Hepatitis B. In addition, Mai Tian accused Han's publisher Lu Jinbo of leading a ghostwriting team that produced and published most of Han's work; Mai also questioned how Han was able to become a nationally acclaimed writer while maintaining fitness to participate in many high-level rally races. Han categorically denied the claims in a blog post dated 16 January 2012, and Mai Tian had since removed the post from his blog and formally apologized to Han on 18 January 2012. On 16 January 2012, the Chinese scientific author and anti-fraud crusader Fang Zhouzi published a blog post, in which Fang concurred with Mai Tian and further raised questions on the plausibility of Han's works. Despite Mai Tian's retraction of his statements against Han, Fang continued to assert that Han's work was produced by ghostwriters. Han again denied Fang's claims and sued Fang for defamation on 29 January 2012. Besides Fang, Han also sued a man named Liu Mingze, who is said to have forwarded an article claiming that Han's work was produced by a team of ghostwriters. However, Han withdrew his prosecution a few days after the prosecution was accepted by the Putuo courthouse of Shanghai. Later, in an interview with a reporter, Han admitted that the person named Liu Mingze was actually a friend of his. Han sued this person so that the prosecution can be accepted by the Putuo courthouse since Liu Mingze was living in the zone of Putuo. Later Mai Tian came back to support Fang's statements against Han. On Nov 17, 2012, a blogger published his finding, searching through website archive, he discovered some of the articles allegedly written by Han were initially posted on Han's father's blog, these posts were removed later. Setup of online bookstore and magazine On 19 April 2009, Han launched his online bookstore, Han Han's Bookstore, on the Taobao online shopping marketplace (Ê∑òÂÆùÁΩë). The bookstore site stated that it would sell only Han's original autographed books. As the number of sales transactions on Han Han's Bookstore was unusually large, the online system erroneously classified these as false transactions and attempts at credit fraud, leading Taobao to investigate the issue. On 1 May 2009, Han posted an article on his blog entitled Request for articles, recruitment, article fees and article submission email address for a new magazine. The post mentioned that Han would be setting up a magazine, informing the email addresses for article submission, response to recruitment ads, and advertising offers, but without revealing the magazine's title to prevent illegal copying. The blog post also mentioned that the writer of the selected cover story, if the story had not been previously published, would get up to RMB 2,000 per 1,000 characters in article fees. This would be 10 to 40 times of the standard rate in China's publishing industry, and 2 to 4 times higher than what China's top magazine would pay China's top writer for an article. Writers of previously unpublished non-cover story articles in the magazine would be paid RMB 1,000 per 1,000 characters, 10 to 20 times higher than standard rates in the publishing industry. As for previously-published articles or selected extracts from articles, the rate would be RMB 500 per 1,000 characters, which would be about 15 times the standard rates. Contributors of photographs would be paid up to RMB 5,000 per photograph. Han also invited article submissions for a \\"braindead\\" (ËÑëÊÆã) column, deliberately publishing articles that the magazine disagreed with or were not up to standards. The rate for such articles would be RMB 250 per 1,000 characters. 250 () is a Chinese slang with the same meaning of \\"You idiot\\". Han gave the rationale for including this column: Within five days of putting up the blog post, Han received over 10,000 article submissions from across China, and also a few thousand r√©sum√©s. There were several articles of the types which Han had expressly forbidden from submission, such as cut and paste jobs, pornographic literature and dissertations. Han expressed his exasperation with these and declared that such articles would not be published. Han's setup of his magazine received widespread attention, with editors proclaiming that the higher fees enabled the writing profession to regain a measure of financial independence and dignity. One journalist even commented that Han had completed his transformation from a rebellious youth into a full-fledged intellectual. Due to certain publishing and circulation restrictions in China, Han's magazine, which was originally planned for publication in August 2009, remained unpublished for some time. One of the delays was reportedly because of an article that detailed the blacklisting of actors. On July 6, 2010, his magazine Party (Áã¨Âî±Âõ¢) was finally published. According to the publisher, the magazine became the most popular book on Amazon.cn less than 10 hours after pre-selling. However, it only lasted one issue. In December, 2010, Global Times, a state-run tabloid, reported \\"Han Han's magazine dies\\". The paper reported: \\"Han went through more than 10 publishers to try and save that content and may have planned to include in the second issue.\\" On June 11, 2012, Han Han published his own digital magazine OneÔºà‰∏Ä‰∏™Ôºâ with his old editorial board of the PartyÔºàÁã¨Âî±Âõ¢Ôºâ magazine. He first published iOS app, and then was able to launch the Android version \\"One\\" app on November 28, 2012. As stated in his foreword of the One magazine, he wishes his readers to take off a few minutes every day to read and think. The basic frame of this magazine is to offer one picture, one article, and one Q&A; column everyday. Faced with critics saying he was not directly talking about democracy and the government this time, he said he felt \\"tired\\" of the repetitive political discussion on the web, so he decided to focus on editing a good magazine this time. Rally racing career After Han turned professional as a rally driver, there were rumours that he had encountered financial difficulties. Han himself admitted that writers and race car drivers in China earned less compared to those in other professions. Furthermore, his only income source was from book royalties as he was not involved in other revenue generating activities. However, he continued to race as it gave him a sense of achievement. Winning prizes also enabled him to prove to himself that he was a well-rounded learner. As Han stated in a media interview in 2007: The following highlights some of Han's achievements in his racing career: * 2003: Raced for Beijing Extreme Speed Racing Team (Âåó‰∫¨ÊûÅÈÄüËΩ¶Èòü) in the China Rally.

The oldest part of the house was said to date to c. 1712, but it is unclear to which part of the house this referred, on account of major alterations the house in the 18th and 19th centuries. It is believed to have begun as a four-room two-story structure built around a central chimney. This underwent significant alteration during the Federal period, including replacing the center chimney with smaller side chimneys, and the construction of four more rooms in front of the original four. Sometime around 1850 Micah Williams, a prosperous farmer, again refashioned the house in the then-popular Italianate style. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984.

It is commonly used as a polymerization aid in the production of fluoropolymers. The dominant chemical compound is perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA) at 74% by weight, followed by the 11 carbon perfluoroundecanoic acid (20%), and the 13 carbon perfluorotridecanoic acid (5%). Supporting Information (PDF). Surflon S-111 is synthesized in Japan by oxidizing a mixture of fluorotelomer olefins. Fluorotelomer olefins are synthesized using a telomerization of tetrafluoroethylene taxogens (monomers), followed by an ethylene insertion. The olefin is oxidized, removing one carbon to yield products with an odd number of carbons with even-lengthed fluorocarbon chains plus a carboxylic acid group. As the fluorotelomer olefins are dominated by F(CF2)8CH=CH2, PFNA is the major PFCA product. Surflon S-111 \\"is described as Fatty acids, C7-C13, perfluoro, ammonium salts\\".

He is notable for his professional tensions with his bishop Antony Bek. Life Having previously served as Prior of Lytham, he denied his bishop Antony Bek the right of episcopal visitation, launching appeals to York, Canterbury and Rome. Bek excommunicated Hoton for contumacy on 20 May 1300 and deprived him of his office the following day for disobedience, perjury and violation of monastic rule. King Edward I of England agreed a temporary reconciliation between Hoton and Bek on 20 June, though this was not to last and on 10 August Bek appointed the Prior of Lindisfarne, Henry of Lusby or Luceby, to replace Hoton. Ten days later Lusby forced his way into the monastery, forcibly removed Hoton from his stall and had him imprisoned. Lusby was formally installed on 24 August, but Hoton escaped from the prison on 16 December 1300. On 1 March 1301 king Edward gave Hoton permission to spend two years at the papal court, and on 29 November that year Pope Boniface VIII declared that Lusby's appointment was uncanonical and that Hoton was to be reinstated. Lusby obeyed the pope, leaving Durham on 14 April 1302, with Hoton's proctor being put in possession of the monastery a week later. Hoton then arrived back in Durham on 1 August 1303, only to be suspended from office by the pope on 5 March 1306 and replaced as the monastery's administrator by Bek. Bek appointed Lusby to administer it as his proctor on 10 March, but the latter was expelled by the monks and Edward issued letters patent in April and June 1306 banning the pope's ejection of Hoton from taking place. Lusby died later in 1306 and Edward granted Hoton another year at the papal court (under royal protection) on 7 August that year. The pope then lifted Hoton's suspension and he was finally restored to his office on 1 December 1307, only to die at the papal court in 1308.

The line consisted of Hall of Famers Bryan Trottier at center, Clark Gillies at left wing and Mike Bossy at right wing. Background All three members of the Trio Grande were highly regarded as amateur players. The Islanders drafted Clark Gillies fourth overallhttps://www.nhl.com/islanders/news/core-of-the-four-clark- gillies/c-465532 and Bryan Trottier 22nd overall in the 1974 NHL Entry Draft, and drafted Mike Bossy 15th overall in the 1977 NHL Entry Draft. Gillies made the Islanders roster that season, while Trottier spent another year in the Western Hockey League before joining the Islanders in 1975‚Äì76, winning the Calder Memorial Trophy as Rookie of the Year and participating in the NHL All- Star Game. Formation The Trio Grande emerged in the 1977 season. Bossy's play led Islanders' coach Al Arbour break up his former top line of Trottier, Gillies and Billy Harris in training camp, inserting Bossy, as a rookie. The results were immediate, as Trottier emerged as a points leader, Bossy emerged as a league's leading goal scorer, while Gillies, the team captain and a larger presence than Trottier and Bossy, served as an aggressor, as well as a scorer. Bossy won the Calder Trophy that season. Gillies, at the time 23, was the oldest of the three. Playoff success The Islanders had made the playoffs the three seasons prior to the formation of the Trio Grande, but had not gotten past the Semifinals. In 1977‚Äì78, the Islanders won their first Patrick Division championship, but lost in the Quarterfinals. In 1978‚Äì79, the Islanders repeated as Patrick Division champions and won the President's Trophy (which they would also win in 1980‚Äì81 and 1981‚Äì82) but lost in the Semifinals. Following the disappointments of the prior two seasons, Gillies, believing the captaincy was harming his game, resigned as captain and was succeeded by Denis Potvin prior to the 1979‚Äì80 season. The Islanders won their first of four consecutive Stanley Cups in 1979‚Äì80, with Trottier winning the Conn Smythe Trophy as MVP of the playoffs in 1980 and Bossy winning the Conn Smythe Trophy in 1982, scoring 7 goals in the 4 game series against the Vancouver Canucks. The Islanders also made the Stanley Cup finals in 1984, losing to the Edmonton Oilers. Bossy had scored 8 goals after the first three rounds of the playoffs (and 17 goals in the past three consecutive post- seasons), but was silenced completely in the finals series. Post-dynasty The Islanders returned to the playoffs in 1984‚Äì85 and 1985‚Äì86, losing in the Division Finals and Division Semifinals, respectively. Following the 1985‚Äì86 season, during which his scoring output decreased significantly, Gillies was waived by the Islanders and acquired by the Buffalo Sabres. Bossy experienced a severe back injury, which forced him to retire following the 1986‚Äì87 season. Trottier would remain with the Islanders until being released after the 1989‚Äì90 NHL season, before signing with the Pittsburgh Penguins, where he would win two more Stanley Cup championships in 1991 and 1992. Personal achievements In 1978‚Äì79, Trottier scored 134 points to earn the Art Ross Trophy, as well as the Hart Memorial Trophy as league MVP. In 1980‚Äì81, Bossy scored 50 goals in the first 50 games of the season, the first achieve this milestone since Maurice Richard. Bossy also won the Lady Byng Memorial Trophy in 1982‚Äì83 NHL season, 1983‚Äì84 and 1985‚Äì86. The three members of the Trio Grande made the NHL All-Star Team in 1977‚Äì78 and 1978‚Äì79, with Trottier and Gillies making the First Team and Bossy making the Second Team, beaten out by Guy Lafleur both years. Bossy would make the First Team in 1980‚Äì81, 1982‚Äì83, 1983‚Äì84, and 1985‚Äì86. Bossy also made the Second Team in 1984‚Äì85, and Trottier was named to the Second Team in 1981‚Äì82 and 1983‚Äì84. All three members of the Trio Grande were named to the 1978 NHL All Star Game. Bossy and Trottier were both named to the 1980, 1982, 1983, 1985, and 1986 All Star Games. In addition, Bossy was named to the All Star Game in 1981. Bossy still holds the team records for most goals in a season (69 goals in 1978‚Äì79) and most points in a season (147 points in 1981‚Äì82). Trottier holds the team record for most assists in a season (87 assists in 1978‚Äì79) as well as most games played as an Islander (1,129).

History Founded by the Cheontae sect of Buddhism in 1027, the temple is believed to be one of the first of the sect's temples in Korea. Destroyed by a fire in the 16th century, and further damaged by American bombing during the Korean War, little remained of the original temple when reconstruction began in 2000 as a joint Korean cultural project. After five years of work, the restoration was completed on October 31, 2005. The temple contains the ashes of Uicheon, the sect's founder. A son of Emperor Munjong of Goryeo, he spent most of his life in Kaesong before retiring to the temple as an ascetic, where he lived until his death. The temple was thus closely connected with the royal family of Goryeo and was where they would attend services. Architecture The main temple is divided into two sections: a west court and an east court. The main entrance to the temple is through the South Gate, in front of which are located the temple's original stone banner pillars. Through the gate is an unwalled plaza containing a monument to Uicheon. Erected in 1125, the much-worn stele rests on the back of a lion- turtle, and commemorates episodes from the life of the great monk. It is listed as National Treasure #155. From here, both the Middle and East Gates are accessible. The Middle Gate, directly across from the South Gate, leads to the temple's large West Court, which is dominated by Bogwang Hall (, \\"Hall of Universal Light\\"), the temple's main shrine. To the right, the East Gate leads to the smaller courtyard fronting Bojo Hall (, \\"Hall of Universal Clarity\\"), devoted to veneration of the Bodhisattvas. In front of Bogwang Hall there are three pagodas, two three-storied, and one five-storied. The smaller three- storied pagoda measures 4.1 meters, while the larger measures 4.4. The five storied pagoda is 5.5 meters. The pagodas are plainly carved in sandstone, with upturned eaves surmounting square segments decorated only with raised vertical lines on the corners. All three date to the Koryo dynasty. The pagodas are registered as National Treasure #133. Directly behind Pogwang Hall is Junggak Hall (), a meditation room and lecture hall decorated with paintings of important Buddhist monks. Behind this there are two gates to the back courtyard of the temple, where Sungbok Hall () is located. This building once held the living quarters for the temple's monks. Behind the main temple and up the mountain is Gyeongseon Hall (), containing a shrine to Uicheon; The stone stupa in front of the hall contains his ashes. The roofs of the main buildings are decorated with ceramic ornaments in the shapes of fish (known as wenshou in Chinese). These are believed to keep the buildings safe from evil and fire. Altogether, the reconstructed temple consists of over 26 buildings in an area of over 4,000 square meters.

Active in communities right across Canada, the Society partners with Alzheimer Societies in every Canadian province to offer information, support and education programs for people with dementia, their families and caregivers. ASC funds research to find a cure and improve the care of people with dementia, promotes public education and awareness of Alzheimer's disease and other dementias, and influences policy and decision-making to address the needs of people with dementia and their caregivers. The Society's vision is a world without Alzheimer's disease and related dementias. It was founded in 1978 and is based in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. History In 1978, the Alzheimer Society began as a Steering Group of researchers concerned about the lack of support for people with Alzheimer's disease. Their focus was family support, education and research. In 1984, the Society was one of the eight founding members of Alzheimer's Disease International. In 1989, the Research Alzheimer Society Research Program (ASRP) was launched, offering upcoming researchers as well as established ones an opportunity to receive grants to further their work. The Society has appointed a person living with dementia to its board of directors since 2003.

Overview  The Kenya Pipeline Company was incorporated on 6 September 1973 and started commercial operations in 1978. The company is a state corporation under the Ministry of Energy with 100% government shareholding. Kenya Pipeline Company operates a pipeline system for transportation of refined petroleum products from Mombasa to Nairobi and western Kenya towns of Nakuru, Kisumu and Eldoret. Working closely with the National Oil Corporation of Kenya, KPC operates 5 storage and distribution depots for conventional petroleum products, located in Eldoret, Kisumu, Mombasa, Nairobi and Nakuru. Depots are fed by domestic-manufactured product from the Kenya Petroleum Refinery near Nairobi and imported, refined petroleum product from the Kipevu Oil Storage Facility near Mombasa. The company operates two aviation fuel depots at Jomo Kenyatta Airport, Nairobi, and Moi International Airport, Mombasa In collaboration with the Government, KPC facilitates the implementation of Government policies: * Acts as a Government agent in specific projects as directed through the Ministry of Energy. To this end, the company works with the government in the implementation of key projects such as the extension of the Oil Pipeline to Uganda and the LPG import handling and storage facilities. * Assists in the fight against fuel adulteration and dumping. * Ensures efficient operation of petroleum sub-sector. Unlike some state corporations, KPC does not depend on government subsidies, but is a source of revenue to the government in terms of dividends and taxes. It is supported by major petroleum companies which are signatories to the network, including Dalbit Petroleum. In 2011, the government of newly independent South Sudan expressed interest to building a pipeline connecting the oil fields in that country to the existing South-Eldoret-Mombasa pipeline in Kenya. In 2016, it was announced that KPC has secured $350 million to install a new 865-kilometers long pipeline from Mombasa to Nairobi. KPC is the largest consumer of electricity in Kenya.

Raspberry Plain was one of the principal Mason family estates of Northern Virginia. Raspberry Plain currently operates as an event site, hosting weddings and other special events year round.  History  Thomas Fairfax, 6th Lord Fairfax of Cameron granted the title to the Raspberry Plain property to blacksmith Joseph Dixon in 1731. In 1754, the \\"houses, buildings, orchard, ways and watercourses\\" of Raspberry Plain were purchased by Loudoun County's first sheriff, Aeneas Campbell. Under Campbell's ownership, the property became the site of Loudoun County's first jailhouse. Raspberry Plain was then purchased by George Mason's younger brother Thomson Mason from Campbell, in 1760. In 1771, Thomson built the mansion at Raspberry Plain. Upon Thomson's death, the Raspberry Plain estate was deeded to his eldest son Stevens Thomson Mason, U.S. senator from Virginia. The mansion at Raspberry Plain was added to throughout the 19th- century and demolished around 1910. Senator Mason's son, Armistead Thomson Mason, of Selma, was shot and killed by his cousin, John Mason McCarty, in a duel fought at the Bladensburg dueling grounds in Bladensburg, Maryland, in February 1819. McCarty lived at nearby Strawberry Plain, the home and jail of Aeneas Campbell, which had been parceled off from the Raspberry Plain property. That mansion has long since disappeared. In 1910, Raspberry Plain was rebuilt for copper millionaire John Guthrie Hopkins. Raspberry Plain, along with several neighboring estates including nearby Mason family estates Temple Hall and Locust Hill, is a contributing property in the Catoctin Rural Historic District, which was added to the National Register of Historic Places on 31 January 1989.  Timeline of Events  1731 - Thomas Fairfax, 6th Lord Fairfax of Cameron granted the title to the 322 acre Raspberry Plain property to blacksmith Joseph Dixon. 1735 ‚Äì George Mason, III, died without a will.

Architecture Although destroyed in 1910, the 1771 mansion that is depicted in old photographs appears to be a Georgian- style brick dwelling with gambrel-roofed brick wings. It was replaced by the present large Colonial Revival brick mansion around 1910. The -story, Flemish bond brick dwelling possesses a two-story tetrastyle Roman Doric portico with a lunette in the triangular pediment. A row of four pedimented dormers extends across the slate gable roof with overhanging eaves and a wide frieze with dentils encircles the building. Windows are six-over-six double-sash types with louvered shutters and wood lintels. A large central Palladian window sheltered by the portico is the dominant feature of the house. Several tenant houses, farm buildings, gambrel-roofed barns, a bank barn, and stables are scattered around the farm.

The company, which was set up in 1981 to help the nascent IT industry overcome its human resource challenges, today ranks among the world's leading training companies owing to its vast and comprehensive array of talent development programs. As India's Most Trusted Educational Brand, NIIT offers training and development solutions to individuals, enterprises and institutions.  History  NIIT was established in 1981 by Rajendra S. Pawar and Vijay K. Thadani, graduates from IIT Delhi, with one million rupees. NIIT conceived a franchising model in IT education for the very first time, setting up nine centers by 1987. In 1986, NIIT began its foray into the software domain, beginning with Software Product Distribution under the 'Insoft' brand. The company also began offering advice and consultancy to large corporations on how to leverage technology and make optimum use of their IT investments. In 1988, NIIT introduced many marketing and advertising strategies for the Indian market including the ‚ÄòComputerdrome‚Äô in 1990. Another initiative launched by NIIT, was its Bhavishya Jyoti Scholarships program, launched in 1991, which was targeted at deserving and socially challenged students with an aim to improve their skills and employability quotient. In 1992, NIIT launched its flagship program GNIIT, an industry-endorsed course with a 12-month Professional Practice for students seeking careers in the IT and non-IT sectors. By 1993, NIIT began trading NIIT stocks on the Indian stock exchanges. In 1996, NIIT began its globalization journey, setting up an education center in Hong Kong. In the same year, the company launched its virtual university ‚ÄòNet Varsity‚Äô. In 1998, NIIT joined a handful of Indian tech companies to enter the Chinese market. The company earned the epithet, the ‚ÄòMcDonald‚Äôs of the software business‚Äô by Far Eastern Economic Review in September, 2001. The same year, NIIT launched an experiment that was christened ‚ÄòHole-in-the-Wall‚Äô by media and drew international attention. The experiment was based on the ‚Äòminimally invasive education‚Äô methodology developed by NIIT R&D.; It suggested that children, irrespective of their social, ethnic or educational identity could learn to use computers by themselves, without adult intervention. In 2003, NIIT launched its MindChampions Academy (MCA) with Viswanathan Anand, five-time former World Chess champion and NIIT Brand Ambassador. NIIT University, Neemarana In 2004, NIIT hived off its software business into an independent organization called NIIT Technologies Ltd. (Source: NASSCOM's 2013-14 Ranking of Top 20 IT services companies). In the area of training, NIIT launched its ‚ÄòEdgeineers‚Äô program in 2005, to boost career opportunities for engineering graduates. In the same year, it diversified into various sectors such as banking, finance and insurance (through IFBI), Executive Management education (through Imperia), Professional Life Skills, BPM, and ICT education for schools. In 2008, NIIT set up NIIT University, in Neemrana, Rajasthan. NU, offers B-Tech and M-Tech programs in computer science and education technology, as well as MBA programs.

This shareholder primacy approach views shareholders as the economic engine of the organization and the only group to which the firm is socially responsible. As such, the goal of the firm is to maximize returns to shareholders. Friedman argues that the shareholders can then decide for themselves what social initiatives to take part in, rather than have an executive whom the shareholders appointed explicitly for business purposes decide such matters for them. The Friedman doctrine has been very influential in the corporate world but has also attracted criticism. Overview Friedman introduced the theory in a 1970 essay for The New York Times titled \\"A Friedman Doctrine: The Social Responsibility of Business is to Increase Its Profits\\". In it, he argued that a company has no social responsibility to the public or society; its only responsibility is to its shareholders. He justified this view by considering to whom a company and its executives are beholden: Friedman argued that an executive spending company money on social causes is, in effect, spending somebody else's money for their own purposes: He argued that the appropriate agents of social causes are individuals‚Äî\\"The stockholders or the customers or the employees could separately spend their own money on the particular action if they wished to do so.\\" He concluded by quoting from his 1962 book Capitalism and Freedom: \\"there is one and only one social responsibility of business‚Äîto use its resources and engage in activities designed to increase its profits so long as it stays within the rules of the game, which is to say, engages in open and free competition without deception or fraud.\\" In Capitalism and Freedom, Friedman had argued that when companies concern themselves with the community rather than profit it leads to totalitarianism, consistent with his statement in the first paragraph of the 1970 essay that \\"businessmen\\" with a social conscience \\"are unwitting puppets of the intellectual forces that have been undermining the basis of a free society\\". The Friedman doctrine was amplified after the publication of an influential 1976 business paper by finance professors William Meckling and Michael C. Jensen, \\"Theory of the Firm: Managerial Behavior, Agency Costs and Ownership Structure\\", which provided a quantitative economic rationale for maximizing shareholder value. Influence Shareholder theory has had a significant impact in the corporate world. In 2017, Harvard Business School professors Joseph L. Bower and Lynn S. Paine stated that maximizing shareholder value \\"is now pervasive in the financial community and much of the business world. It has led to a set of behaviors by many actors on a wide range of topics, from performance measurement and executive compensation to shareholder rights, the role of directors, and corporate responsibility.\\" In 2016, The Economist called shareholder theory \\"the biggest idea in business\\", stating \\"today shareholder value rules business\\". Shareholder theory has led to a marked rise in stock-based compensation, particularly to CEOs, in an attempt to align the financial interests of employees with those of shareholders. In September 2020, fifty years after publishing \\"A Friedman Doctrine\\", The New York Times published 22 short responses to Friedman's essay written by 25 prominent people. The 25 people who wrote responses are Marc Benioff, Martin Lipton, David R. Henderson, Howard Schultz, Alex Gorsky, Marianne Bertrand, Daniel S. Loeb, Oren Cass, Oliver Hart, Erika Karp, Joseph Stiglitz, Leo E. Strine Jr. with Joey Zwillinger, Sara Nelson, Dambisa Moyo, Robert Reich, Glenn Hubbard, Kenneth Langone, Anand Giridharadas, Laurence D. Fink, Thea Lee with Josh Bivens, Felicia Wong, Russ Roberts, and Darren Walker. Criticism The Friedman doctrine is controversial, with critics variously claiming it is financially wrong, economically wrong, legally wrong, socially wrong, or morally wrong. Left-wing social activist Naomi Klein argued in her 2007 book The Shock Doctrine that adherence to the Friedman doctrine has impoverished most citizens while enriching corporate elites. Other scholars argue that it is unhealthy and counterproductive to the companies that practice it. Harvard Business School professors Joseph L. Bower and Lynn S. Paine said in 2017 that the Friedman doctrine is \\"distracting companies and their leaders from the innovation, strategic renewal, and investment in the future that require their attention\\", puts companies at risk of \\"activist shareholder attack\\", and puts \\"managers ... under increasing pressure to deliver ever faster and more predictable returns and to curtail riskier investments aimed at meeting future needs.\\" The Economist said in 2016 that a focus on short-term shareholder value has become \\"a license for bad conduct, including skimping on investment, exorbitant pay, high leverage, silly takeovers, accounting shenanigans and a craze for share buy-backs, which are running at $600 billion a year in America\\". In 2019, Jerry Useem writing in The Atlantic and prominent Democratic Senators Chuck Schumer and Bernie Sanders writing in The New York Times argued that shareholder theory, which promoted a rise in stock-based compensation, has led executives to enrich themselves by implementing stock buybacks‚Äîoften to the detriment of the companies they work for.But for a somewhat different view see: The critics argued this diverts company funds away from potentially more profitable or socially valuable avenues, like research and design, reduces productivity, and increases inequality by delivering money to higher-paid employees who receive stock-based compensation and not to lower-paid employees who do not. Shareholder theory has been criticized by proponents of stakeholder theory, who believe the Friedman doctrine is inconsistent with the idea of corporate social responsibility to a variety of stakeholders. They argue it is morally imperative a business takes into account all of the people who are affected by its decisions. They also argue that taking into account the interests of stakeholders can benefit the company and its shareholders; for example, a company donating services or goods to help those hurt in a natural disaster is not acting in the direct interest of its shareholders, but in doing so builds community allegiance to the company, ultimately benefitting the company and its shareholders. In 2019, influential business groups such as the World Economic Forum and the Business Roundtable updated their mission statement, leaving behind the Friedman doctrine in favor of \\"stakeholder capitalism\\" (at least on paper if not in widespread practice). Friedman's characterization of moral responsibility has been questioned. Ronald Duska, in a 1997 article in the Journal of Business Ethics and in his 2007 book Contemporary Reflections on Business Ethics, argued that Friedman failed to differentiate two very different aspects of business: (1) the motive of individuals, who are often motivated by profit to participate in business, and (2) the socially sanctioned purpose of business, or the reason why people allow businesses to exist, which is to provide goods and services to people. Duska said of a hypothetical businessperson's belief that there is no business ethics beyond making a profit: \\"Does that mean [the businessperson] is likely to give you a faulty product if he can get away with it and make more profit? If he really believes what he says, aren't you a fool to do business with him?\\" John Friedman (no relation to Milton Friedman), writing in the Huffington Post in 2013, said: \\"Mr. Friedman argues that a corporation, unlike a person, cannot have responsibility. No one would engage in a business contract with a corporation if they thought for one minute that a corporation was not responsible to pay its bills, for example. So clearly, therefore, a corporation can have legal, but also moral responsibilities.\\" See also * Neoliberalism Contrary ideas * Community capitalism * Corporate social entrepreneurship * Environmental, social and corporate governance * Social enterprise * Social venture capital * Sustainable capitalism References Category:Business ethics Category:Shareholders ","title":"Friedman doctrine"},{"id":"21554180","text":"Joel Bergman (August 20, 1936 ‚Äì August 24, 2016) was an American architect who has designed several landmark casinos.

Those who have it are cortically blind, but affirm, often quite adamantly and in the face of clear evidence of their blindness, that they are capable of seeing. Failing to accept being blind, people with Anton syndrome dismiss evidence of their condition and employ confabulation to fill in the missing sensory input. It is named after the neurologist Gabriel Anton. Only 28 cases have been published. Although sometimes the two terms are used as synonymous, Anton syndrome must not be confused with Anton‚ÄìBabinski syndrome, which is characterised clinically by contralateral sensory neglect, anosognosia with associated affective indifference toward the condition (anosodiaphoria), construction and dressing apraxia. Anton‚ÄìBabinski syndrome is the right-hemisphere equivalent of Gerstmann syndrome and it is due to non-dominant inferior parietal lobule damage. Presentation Anton syndrome is mostly seen following a stroke, but may also be seen after head injury. Neurologist Macdonald Critchley describes it thus: > The sudden development of bilateral occipital dysfunction is likely to > produce transient physical and psychical effects in which mental confusion > may be prominent. It may be some days before the relatives, or the nursing > staff, stumble onto the fact that the patient has actually become sightless. > This is not only because the patient ordinarily does not volunteer the > information that they have become blind, but he furthermore misleads his > entourage by behaving and talking as though they were sighted. Attention is > aroused however when the patient is found to collide with pieces of > furniture, to fall over objects, and to experience difficulty in finding his > way around. They may try to walk through a wall or through a closed door on > his way from one room to another. Suspicion is still further alerted when > they begin to describe people and objects around them which, as a matter of > fact, are not there at all. Thus we have the twin symptoms of anosognosia > (or lack of awareness of defect) and confabulation, the latter affecting > both speech and behaviour.Macdonald Critchley, \\"Modes of reaction to central > blindness\\", in Critchley, 1979, p. 156 Anton syndrome may be thought of ideally as the opposite of blindsight, blindsight occurring when part of the visual field is not consciously experienced, but some reliable perception does in fact occur. Causes Why patients with Anton syndrome deny their blindness is unknown, although there are many theories. One hypothesis is that damage to the visual cortex results in the inability to communicate with the speech-language areas of the brain. Visual imagery is received but cannot be interpreted; the speech centers of the brain confabulate a response. Patients have also reported visual anosognosia after experiencing ischemic vascular cerebral disease. A 96-year- old man, who was admitted to an emergency department complaining of a severe headache and sudden loss of vision, was discovered to have had a posterior cerebral artery thrombosis with consequent loss of vision. He adamantly claimed he was able to see despite an ophthalmologic exam proving otherwise. An MRI of his brain proved that his right occipital lobe was ischemic. Similarly, a 56-year-old woman was admitted to the emergency department in a confused state and with severely handicapped psychomotor skills. Ocular movements and pupil reflexes were still intact, but the patient could not name objects and was not aware of light changes in the room, and seemed unaware of her visual deficit. History Most cases of Anton syndrome are reported from adults. The European Journal of Neurology published an article in 2007 that examines a case study of a six-year-old child with Anton syndrome and early stages of adrenoleukodystrophy. The child reportedly had abnormal eye movements, would often fall, and would reach for things and often miss his target. When his sight was tested at 20/20 he was still unable to read the large letters on the chart. He denied having headaches, diplopia, or eye pain and seemed unconcerned and unaware of his poor eyesight. Upon examination, his pupils were equal in shape, round, and reactive to light. His mother commented that he developed unusual eye movements and that they had a \\"roving quality\\". In popular culture Anton syndrome was featured in a two-part episode of the television series House M.D., titled \\"Euphoria\\", although it was ascribed to primary amoebic meningoencephalitis, a disease that usually does not cause the syndrome in real life. The syndrome features prominently in the Rupert Thomson novel The Insult. It is also mentioned in the science fiction novel Blindsight, by Peter Watts. It is mentioned frequently as \\"Anton's Blindness\\" as one of the primary metaphors in Raj Patel's The Value of Nothing. In Lars von Trier's film Dogville, the character Jack McKay acts as if he can see but gives many signs he cannot. The syndrome is also the main theme of the Malaysian movie Desolasi (Desolation), where the patients live in their own world of imagination, while unable to see the real world. It is also mentioned in Oliver Sacks's An Anthropologist on Mars.

Formed in 1990 and named after pressure defense in basketball (and some other team sports), Presing were, together with Darkwood Dub and Kanda, Kod≈æa i Neboj≈°a, representatives of the so-called NeoBeo sound, alternative, guitar-based rock music produced in Belgrade in early 1990s. New York Press wrote about Presing: \\"It's a sound that kicks the pants off the recycle-rock of The Strokes, The Vines and the White Stripes, just to name a few... You can hear bits of the melodic era of The Fall (This Nation's Saving Grace through Frenz Experiment), some Nick Cave, some Neil Young‚Äìand even some P-Funk via Kraftwerk\\".\\"Belgrade Rockers\\", New York Press, December 10, 2002 http://www.nypress.com/article-6758-belgrade-rockers.html The original lineup consisted of Zoran Radoviƒá \\"Kiza\\" on vocals, Vladimir Markoviƒá \\"Kraka\\" on guitar, Roman Gor≈°ek on bass guitar and Slobodan Asanoviƒá on drums. Radoviƒá and Markoviƒá remained in the band continuously, while other members kept changing. Highly artistic lyrics of Radoviƒá, performed in a rap manner, merged with harmonic and somewhat dissonant guitar tunes of Markoviƒá, thus creating a style of post-rock sound. Presing members are also involved in other art forms, such as fiction and poetry (both Radoviƒá and Markoviƒá released their books), painting and sculpture (Radoviƒá and Grubaƒçiƒá). They also have musical side projects such as Tron and Stereo Ikar by Radoviƒá and Tornado Ptice and Xanax by Markoviƒá.  History   Formation and first breakup (1990-1993)  The band was formed in 1990, in the lineup consisting of former Pasmaters member Zoran Radoviƒá \\"Kiza\\" (vocals, bass guitar), Vladimir Markoviƒá \\"Kraka\\" (guitar) and drummer Slobodan Asanoviƒá \\"Boban\\". Before joining the band, Markoviƒá lived in London, working as a window-washer and bassist in a reggae band, but returned to Belgrade on Radoviƒá request of joining the band. Soon after, Radoviƒá quit playing bass, with former Euforija member Roman Gor≈°ek taking over the bass duties. The lineup had their first recordings, the songs \\"Maƒço\\" (\\"Macho\\") and \\"Oboye\\" (\\"Both\\") released on the various artists compilation ≈Ωelim jahati do ekstaze, released by Slu≈°aj Najglasnije and Nova Aleksandrija record labels, which, due to the outbreak of the Yugoslav wars, did not have a proper distribution. The outbreak of the war forced the band members to leave the country and for a while bassist Nikola Raƒëenoviƒá, a former Gastrbajters and Avtomobili member, and drummer Bla≈æa Drecun, a former Darkwood Dub member, were replacements. On Gor≈°ek's return, the band, with the new drummer Miladin Radivojeviƒá, a former Klajberi member, recorded their debut album Priƒça o totemu, duhu koji hoda, psu i razoƒçaranoj ≈æeni (The Story of Totem, a Ghost that Walks, a Dog and a Disappointed Woman), featuring elements of punk rock, funk and noise music. The album, available on compact cassette only, was released by Slu≈°aj Najglasnije record label in Croatia, and a slightly altered version of the album was released in Serbia by Sorabia Disk. It reached the second Yugoslav album of the year by both the magazine Ritam and the Italian Udine Radio. After the album release, the band performed at the Zajeƒçar Gitarijada festival, after which Gor≈°ek and Radivojeviƒá left the band, forming Plejboj, being replaced by the former Kazna Za U≈°i bassist Rudolf Cibulski and former Sport i Reinkarnacija drummer Sa≈°a Bugarƒçiƒá. The new lineup also started recording new material, but due to Radoviƒá's health problems only two tracks were recorded, the song \\"Mamutska brda\\" (\\"The Mammoth Hills\\") and the instrumental \\"Godzila\\" (\\"Godzilla\\"), the former being released in 1994 on the various artists compilation Radio Utopia (B92: 1989-1994). \\"Mamutska brda\\" also appeared on the Geto (Ghetto) movie soundtrack, however it was never released officially. During the same year, the tracks \\"Maƒço\\", \\"≈†urikeni\\" (\\"Sure-cans\\"), \\"Sve zvezde\\" (\\"All the Stars\\"), and \\"Ona vreba\\" (\\"She is Lurk\\"), appeared on the split album 3, also featuring Overdose and Kazna Za U≈°i.  Reformation (1993-2007)  Zoran Radoviƒá \\"Kiza\\" performing live with Presing in 2002 The band had a three-year break in its career, during which Markoviƒá formed the band Tornado Ptice, also featuring Vladislav Rac (of Kanda, Kod≈æa i Neboj≈°a) on bass guitar, Ognjenka Lakiƒáeviƒá (later Autopark vocalist) on vocals, Predrag Iliƒá on drums, Nenad Pejoviƒá on the other guitar, Neboj≈°a Mrƒëenoviƒá on cello and violinist Vladimir Nikoliƒá, releasing the album Prozraƒçno poslepodne (An airy afternoon) on Automatic Records. With the former Kanda, Kod≈æa i Neboj≈°a bassist Vladislav Rac and drummer Miladin Radivojeviƒá, Radoviƒá and Markoviƒá reformed Presing in 1996. Two years later, the song \\"Maƒço\\" appeared on the soundtrack for the Radivoje Andriƒá movie 3 palme za 2 bitange i ribicu (3 Palm-Trees for 2 Punks and a Chick). In 2001, the lineup changed and drummer Radivojeviƒá was replaced by Dejan Utvar, a former Kanda, Kod≈æa i Neboj≈°a and Kazna Za U≈°i drummer. The following year, on June 12, the second studio album 600 nebo (pun for 6th heaven) was released, recorded during May and June 1999 and produced by ≈Ωeljko Bo≈æiƒá. The album was critically acclaimed and it reached No. 1 on the lists of best albums of the year 2002 in FR Yugoslavia by pop culture monthly OK magazin, Blic daily and Reporter weekly, and the US weekly magazine Boston Phoenix ranked the album as \\"one of the best five albums to emerge from Europe in the past decade\\". The sound of the band on this album evolved towards more harmonic structures of soul, free jazz, country and even krautrock. The single \\"Ritam u kojem stoji≈°\\" (\\"Rhythm that You're Standing In\\") reached No. 1 in video charts of Radio Television of Serbia 3rd Channel, TV Studio B and No. 2 in the lists of best music videos of the year 2002 by TV B92 and Music Television of Serbia. In 2003 the debut album, Priƒça o totemu, duhu koji hoda, psu i razoƒçaranoj ≈æeni, was rereleased on CD by Sensart and Beograund independent record labels. The following year, a former Trenje bassist Marko Grubaƒçiƒá \\"Gega\\", and E-Play drummer Damjan Da≈°iƒá became the new band members, immediately starting a year and a half long recording sessions at the Master Blaster and Vesa studios for the third studio album, Zanos bez snova (Enchantment without Dreams), combining a more subtle sound, featuring increased use of string sections of tango and modern classical music, with loud and dissonant guitar sound. Guest appearances on the album featured Ivana Smoloviƒá (vocals), Du≈°an Petroviƒá (saxophone), Milica Milojeviƒá (flute), Boris Krstajiƒá (synthesizer), Marko Petronijeviƒá (trumpet, jaw harp) and Vladimir Nikoliƒá (violin, viola). On March 30, 2007, the band held a farewell concert at the Belgrade Youth Center, featuring guest appearances by Aleksandar Jovan Krstiƒá on flute and Jarboli member Daniel Kovaƒç on acoustic guitar.http://www.popboks.com/tekst.php?ID=5074 After the band disbandment, Radoviƒá released a solo album Arax and founded an electronic music duo Tron with the former Supernaut member Svetolik Trifunoviƒá \\"Trile\\".http://www.popboks.com/tekst.php?ID=6298 Markoviƒá with Sana Gariƒá formed the supergroup Xanax, also featuring musicians from various Belgrade alternative bands.  Reunion (2011-present)  In December 2011, the band reunited in the lineup which beside Markoviƒá and Radoviƒá featured a new bassist Du≈°an Zdravkoviƒá, an upright bass graduate at the Norvegian Stanvager Music Academy, and the drummer Ernest D≈æananoviƒá, a Kristali member. The band had their first reunion performance on December 29. In July 2013, the band released the compilation album Skrivena planeta - Najbolje od Presinga (Hidden Planet - The Best of Presing). The album, beside Presing's old songs, featured two new songs, \\"Zvona se uklapaju sa suncem\\" (\\"The Bells Are Matching with the Sun\\"), and \\"Robot ƒçioda\\" (\\"Robot Pin\\"), the latter featuring Pavle Popov as guest, both of which would appear on the band's fourth studio album.\\"Preslu≈°ajte kompilaciju Skrivena planeta ‚Äì najbolje od Presinga\\", popboks.com In November 2014, the band released their fourth studio album, Neurokrem (a word play, Eurokrem being a popular sweet milk chocolate spread).

A London Overground train at Crystal Palace The East London line extension (ELLX) project was a British railway engineering project in London, managed by Transport for London. The project involved extending the East London Line (formerly part of the London Underground network) and making it part of the mainline London Overground network. This was done by re-opening sections of disused railway line and by converting track electrified by the third-rail system, signalling, lineside signage and communication systems, etc. to mainline standards. New rolling stock was introduced and four new stations built along the route, with a fifth scheduled to be added in the future at . The work, costing around ¬£1 billion, began in 2005 and was carried out in two phases. The first phase was completed on 23 May 2010 with a service from via the historic Thames Tunnel under the River Thames and along part of the Brighton Main Line to West Croydon and . Trains also go to , where they make connection with the South Eastern Main Line. On 28 February 2011 the line was connected at its northern end to the North London Line at Highbury & Islington. In the second phase of the project, on 9 December 2012 a branch was connected to the South London Line enabling services to run to . Project overview Phase 1 Phase 1 of the ELLX project involved the extension of the original line at its northern and southern ends. The northern extension runs from to , connecting with the North London Line; this section became operational as far as in late May 2010, and to Highbury & Islington on 28 February 2011, with trains every 5 minutes on the central section between Dalston Junction and Surrey Quays. The southern extension of phase 1 from to and West Croydon was completed simultaneously with that to Dalston in 2010 and a full service began in May 2010. The northern extension makes use of disused trackbeds on the Kingsland Viaduct that formerly carried the North London Railway branch to Broad Street station, closed to the national rail system in 1986. It bypasses , which closed permanently in June 2006. The new line diverges before the closed Shoreditch station, traverses the former site of the Bishopsgate Goods Yard and crosses Shoreditch High Street on a bridge, before running north along the Kingsland Viaduct. Four new stations have been built at , , and . From there, the double-track line continues under Kingsland High Street and Boleyn Road and then parallels the existing North London Line with services running through (for interchange with the North London Line eastbound) to (for interchange with the Victoria line, North London Line westbound and Northern City Line). The stations between New Cross Gate and Crystal Palace/West Croydon were previously managed by Southern, which ran all train services to these stations; they were later transferred to TfL control. The existing section of line was completely overhauled, with the replacement of all track and signalling upgraded to Network Rail standards. Phase 2 The ELLX Phase 2 project extended the line from Surrey Quays on to the Network Rail South London Line. Trains on this route run to via , , , and . From Wandsworth Road, instead of running to Victoria, westbound trains branch off at Factory Junction, passing through Battersea towards Clapham Junction. (map illustrating future development phases as proposed by TfL in 2006, subject to change) After a period of uncertainty, funding for this phase was finally announced in February 2009, with a prospective completion date of May 2012, in time for the start of the 2012 Summer Olympic and Paralympic Games, held in London, in July 2012; however, TfL later put back the opening date to 9 December 2012. A new station was proposed at . In September 2010, funding for this was refused by the Department for Transport, but the developer Renewal later agreed to fund it as part of its Surrey Canal development scheme, due to start in 2013, and Lewisham Council granted planning permission. The new station could open in 2015, depending on the pace of new housing development in the vicinity. At Clapham Junction, former Platform 2 is being divided into two separate, staggered platforms, Platform 1 (for the existing Overground services to/from Willesden Junction and Stratford) and Platform 2 (for the new services to/from Highbury & Islington). In addition, a disused staircase at Platform 2 is being brought back into use and a new lift installed to improve access from the newly refurbished Grant Road entrance. Trains will run every 15 minutes between Clapham Junction and Highbury & Islington. There are no plans to operate trains through from the South London line to the West London line, so passengers from one to the other will have to change at Clapham Junction. Transport for London will take over the management of Clapham High Street and Wandsworth Road stations when the new service starts. Train services and rolling stock A new Class 378 train at Hoxton The core section of the line, between Dalston and Surrey Quays, is served by 16 trains per hour. New Cross Gate to Sydenham has 8 trains per hour. The remainder of the line is served by four trains per hour.East London Line Extensions. Islington Council, 31 October 2008. A total of 30 stations are served by the new line. As part of the upgrade, new mainline rolling stock replaced the former London Underground A60 and A62 Stock, which had been in service for 50 years. the line operated 23 Class 378/1 \\"Capitalstar\\" four-car electric multiple units (similar to the Class 376 already in use by Southeastern), although some five- car units have since been introduced to meet demand. Unlike the London Underground stock which they replaced, the trains have longitudinal seating similar to most classes of Tube trains, to cater for the expected higher level of usage. Transfer to London Overground The stations from New Cross Gate to Crystal Palace and West Croydon were previously managed by Southern, but London Overground took over control of these stations in September 2009 in preparation for the new London Overground services. Contractors Balfour Beatty/Carillion contractors on-site at Shoreditch Parsons Brinckerhoff were selected by TfL as the programme managers in May 2005, and in June 2005, TfL awarded Taylor Woodrow a ¬£30 million contract to undertake enabling works on the Kingsland Viaduct and other sites. Mott MacDonald was also appointed the project's technical advisor. The main works on the line were undertaken by a consortium of the engineering and construction groups Balfour Beatty and Carillion. TfL announced in October 2006 that the two companies had been awarded a ¬£363 million contract to carry out the work, beating a rival consortium made up of Laing O'Rourke, AMEC Spie and Vinci. Some 2,000 jobs were planned to have been created at the peak of the contract and the contractors were obliged to hire local staff. The contract awarded bonuses to the contractors if they complete work ahead of schedule, but penalised them up to ¬£50,000 a day for late delivery. Carillion has also been awarded a contract to maintain the extended line. The seven-year ¬£80 million contract, announced in February 2009, requires Carillion to provide TfL with management, technical resources, plant, equipment and labour. Bombardier supplied the line's rolling stock as part of a ¬£259 million contract to provide trains for the London Overground network. In August 2006 Transport for London placed an initial ¬£223 million order for 152 carriages, comprising 20 four-coach trains for the East London line and 24 three-coach trains for the North London line. The order was expanded in July 2007 at an additional cost of ¬£36 million, to provide an extra three trains for the East London line. Manufacturing work began at Bombardier's Derby plant at the start of 2008 and the last train was scheduled to be delivered by May 2010. The company beat three other bidders - Siemens, Hitachi and the rolling stock operating company Porterbrook, which would have supplied pre-owned trains. Funding On 12 October 2004 the Mayor of London confirmed that phase one of the East London Line Project would be delivered as part of the Capital Investment programme. On 16 November 2004 he announced that control of the project had passed from the Strategic Rail Authority to TfL, so that the project could be initiated and funded from TfL's five-year investment programme. The planned service was initially described as a \\"metro-style (National Rail) train service\\". The bulk of the funding for phase 1 of the project was provided by the European Investment Bank, which granted TfL a loan of ¬£450m (‚Ç¨660m). The bank's involvement was intended to promote the regeneration of the deprived areas of London through which the line runs. The second phase of the project is being co-funded by the Department for Transport, which is providing ¬£64 million, and TfL providing a further ¬£11 million. This funding does not cover the ¬£10 million cost of building a new station at Surrey Canal Road and it remains unclear whether the station will be built, but provision is being made for it to be built at a later date. It has been suggested that Millwall Football Club might contribute to the cost of the new station, which would be close to The Den football ground. History Proposals and problems 1906 diagram showing the former connection of the East London Line to Liverpool Street The alternative routes from Peckham Rye via East Dulwich and via Denmark Hill in 1908 Diagram of the New Cross end of the East London line (1914) showing junctions to the southern routes The East London line within the orbital London Overground system (as completed in 2012) Extensions of the East London line have been discussed for many years. During the 1980s London Transport considered converting the line into a light railway similar to the Docklands Light Railway, or restoring the disused connection to Liverpool Street. By 1989 a proposal had emerged to extend it north to Dalston and south to Peckham Rye and Dulwich, sharing track and stations with the mainline network, in a similar fashion to parts of the Bakerloo line, District line and Metropolitan line. The plan was costed at ¬£100-¬£120 million and the extended line was envisaged to open in 1994. The extension project was proposed several times during the 1990s but was repeatedly rejected or postponed owing to lack of government support and insufficient financing. In November 1990 Transport Secretary Cecil Parkinson rejected a proposed parliamentary Bill that would have authorised the project and two years later the extension plans were postponed indefinitely owing to cutbacks in Tube funding. Another proposal was made in 1993 to extend the line from Whitechapel to Dalston Junction, involving the construction of new stations at Bishopsgate, Hoxton and Haggerston, and received the support of a public inquiry in 1994. Construction was envisaged to begin in 1996 and to be completed by 1998. The project was finally approved by the Government in 1996\\"Final approval given for powers to construct East London Line northern extension.\\" Department of Transport. 16 January 1997. but a lack of financing again forced the project to be put on hold in 1997. A solution to the funding issue was found in 1999 when London Transport announced that it was seeking private funds to realise the extension plans. Control of the project was given to the Strategic Rail Authority rather than to London Underground, in view of the impact that it would have on mainline services. It was also proposed that the East London line and other sub-surface Underground lines would be transferred to Railtrack, the privatised company responsible for maintaining the mainline network. This would have seen the line integrated with the London suburban commuter network. However, it was soon decided that this was impractical and the Railtrack proposal was abandoned. Network Rail's South London Route Utilisation Strategy in 2008 considered changes to the South London Line services unavoidable, particularly in respect of the even more restricted capacity during the reconstruction of London Bridge. Alternative routes A number of different routeing proposals were put forward before the route of the northern, southern and western extensions was finalised. The southerly route across south London's existing network of suburban railways underwent many changes before a final route was decided. Initial proposals around 1992 envisaged the western extension running from Peckham Rye to East Dulwich. Construction The new Shoreditch High Street bridge is lowered into place on 29 March 2008 Surrey Quays station with new London Overground branding The East London Line extension project was officially initiated by the Government on 9 October 2001, with construction of the northern extension due to begin in December 2001. However, it was held up when it came to light that the Grade II listed 19th-century Braithwaite arches in the former Bishopsgate Goods Yard were to be demolished as part of the project. Campaigners launched legal action against London Underground in an effort to prevent the demolition, but the project finally received legal clearance in the Court of Appeal on 7 July 2003. Because of an inability to extend the platforms at the existing and stations and make them fully compliant with current rail safety regulations, it was thought that they would close, but on 18 August 2004 Ken Livingstone, Mayor of London, announced that both stations would remain open. Preparatory work by Taylor Woodrow began in June 2005 and continued through to the end of 2006, involving the replacement and refurbishment of 22 bridges along the Kingsland Viaduct. On 9 June 2006, Shoreditch underground station closed permanently to facilitate work on the extension, with services from Whitechapel being replaced by buses. The rest of the East London line closed on 22 December 2007, with rail replacement buses linking the stations north and south of the Thames (but not crossing the river due to height restrictions in the Rotherhithe Tunnel). On 5 September 2006 it was announced that the line would transfer from London Underground to London Overground, branded with a version of the Underground roundel with red replaced by orange, the colour used on Tube maps for the East London Line. Three major new bridges were installed on the line between March and May 2008. On 29 March 2008, a new bridge weighing 350 tonnes was lifted into place over Shoreditch High Street. The bridge was manufactured to a tied arch or bowstring design in Chepstow by engineering firm Fairfield Mabey, and was lowered into place by the UK's biggest mobile crane, weighing 1,200 tonnes. On 3 May 2008, a 1,300-tonne Warren truss bridge (GE19 bridge) spanning Great Eastern Main Line tracks out of Liverpool Street station was put into place. Although the bridge launch was successful, on 28 May the bridge dropped 200 mm onto its permanent supports as it was being jacked down. Debris fell onto the tracks, forcing the suspension of services in and out of Liverpool Street station until the following day and causing major disruption to commuters. The problem was traced to errors made by the sub-contractors. The last of the three bridges, a 600-ton truss steel structure, was put in place at New Cross Gate between 10 and 12 May 2008. Test running on the completed line began on 5 October 2009. Re-opening First train on the \\"preview\\" service, 27 April 2010. Before the full service launch, a limited \\"preview\\" service began on 27 April 2010 between Dalston Junction and New Cross/New Cross Gate, and the line came into full operation between Dalston Junction and West Croydon/Crystal Palace on 23 May. The proximity of the line re-opening date to the forthcoming parliamentary general election also generated speculation about political motives, with opposition parties suggesting Mayor Boris Johnson was seeking to make political capital out of a project originally begun by his predecessor and political opponent Ken Livingstone.

It is open daily without charge. The garden dates to 1691 when Louis de Carel acquired forest land within which he built a walled garden and pavilion. Scottish banker John Law purchased the garden in 1717, and in 1741, after several other owners, it was opened to the public. In 1806 Sophie Blanchard made a solo balloon ascension from the grounds, in 1811 Napoleon purchased the garden to establish the S√©natorie de la Seine- Inf√©rieure, and in 1817 √âlisa Garnerin parachuted from a balloon launched on the site. In 1820 English horticulturist Crac Calvert set up greenhouses for dahlias. The municipality of Rouen purchased the site in 1832 for its botanical garden, to designs by D√©sir√© Lejeune and construction by Guillaume Dubreuil, which in 1840 opened to the public as the Jardin des Plantes. In 2004 the garden was recognized by the Association des jardins botaniques de France et des pays francophones. Today the garden contains over 5600 plant taxa, representing 600 species, with a notable collection of fuchsias (991 varieties). It contains a rock garden (1300 m¬≤), garden of iris and hemerocallis (450 m¬≤), rose garden (670 m¬≤), squares of medicinal plants (60 plants), as well as an orchard and collections of aromatic and carnivorous plants. Buildings include an orangery, the central greenhouse (1839-1842), seven additional greenhouses (1883-1884) including a palmarium, and tropical greenhouses (1936-1938). The garden also contains statues of local writer Eug√®ne No√´l (1816-1899), a runic stone from Denmark placed in 1911, and a bust of the god Pan.

It has often been mistakenly claimed that the first performance had taken place in the United States.Sunday Classics: Which mainstay of the chamber music literature was first heard in 1855 in, of all places, NYC? - Down With Tyranny! Brahms produced a revised version of the work in summer 1889 that shows significant alterations so that it may even be regarded as a distinct (fourth) piano trio.Conrad Wilson: Notes on Brahms: 20 Crucial Works (Edinboro, Saint Andrew Press: 2005) p. 8 This ‚ÄúNew Edition‚Äù (Neue Ausgabe), as he called it, was premiered on 10 January 1890 in Budapest and published in February 1891. The trio is scored for piano, violin and cello, and it is the only work of Brahms to exist today in two published versions, although it is almost always the revised version that is performed today. The work is homotonal, with two movements in the key of B major and two in B minor. It is also among the few multimovement works to begin in a major key and end in the tonic minor (another example being Felix Mendelssohn's \\"Italian\\" Symphony). Structure The trio is in four movements: Original version (1854): (a performance typically takes around 42 minutes) Revised version (Neue Ausgabe) (1889): (a performance typically takes around 33 minutes) Analysis First movement B major, ', alla breve in revised version This movement is a sonata form movement in B major. It begins with a broad theme in the cello and piano and builds in intensity. Between the two versions of the trio, Brahms made hardly any changes to the first 80 bars or so, except for omitting little interjections by the violin that he supposedly only included in the first version to meet a desire of Joseph Joachim. In the first version, the second subject group in G minor (bar 84) includes various thematic elements, only one of which is taken up in the recapitulation as the basis for a fugue in stile antico (bar 354). In the coda of the original version, the main subject is finally brought to a climactic, fortissimo conclusion on the tonic (bar 473). Second movement B minor, trio section and ending in B major, The B minor scherzo combines delicate filigree passages with fortissimo outbursts. The exuberant mood of the first movement returns in the trio section in B major. A Picardy third, which ends the movement in B major, sets the scene for the third movement, also in B major. The only alterations Brahms applied to this movement in his revision of the work were a doubling of the climactic trio melody in the cello, and a reworking of the coda. Third movement B major, This movement, returning to B major and following a simple ternary form, opens with a spacious chordal theme in the piano, counterpoised by a middle section in which the cello plays a poignant G minor melody making use of chromaticism (bar 33). In the first version, a different second theme was used ‚Äì a quotation from Franz Schubert's \\"Am Meer\\" from Schwanengesanghttp://www.kammermusikfuehrer.de/werke/2785 (bar 33) ‚Äì and an Allegro section was included near the end of the movement (bar 82). Fourth movement B minor, Back in B minor, the first theme of this movement is highly chromatic and slightly ambiguous tonally, with a very agitated dotted rhythm. This is perhaps the movement Brahms altered the most between the two versions, with the cello's original smooth second theme in F major (bar 105)‚Äîan apparent allusion to Beethoven's Nimm sie denn hin, meine Lieder from An die ferne Geliebte, also quoted in Schumann's Fantasie Op. 17‚Äîbeing replaced by a more vigorous arpeggiated piano theme in D major (bar 64). The combined contour and rhythm of this new theme in its first four bars bear a striking resemblance to \\"The Star-Spangled Banner\\".\\"The Star-Spangled Banner\\", service version, attributed to John Stafford Smith After a B major episode recalling the mood of the first movement, the music returns to B minor and ends very turbulently.

History Stone Age Small weapons made of stone, which are around 15,000-20,000 years old, have been discovered by archaeologists of the State Archaeology Department at Ekani Chandpara in Sagardighi. Apart from the weapons they also discovered raw materials and scrap, which indicates that the weapons were made at this place itself. Pala period Sagardighi has many remains of the Pala dynasty. There is a lake of the name, which is the largest in the district. It was dug up by Mahipala. Gauda Sultanate Hussain Shah, the greatest of Sultans of Gauda, was associated with Chandpara or Ekani Chandpara in Sagardighi block. Sekherdighi is a large lake excavated by him. British Period During the British Raj, the Murshidabad leadership of the Nawabs became weak and the British gave charge of revenue collections to a few noble Rajput Marwari's. These nobles were given the title of 'Zamindar' (Land owners). The Kothari family reigned over Sagardighi from the time of Mir Qasim until the abolishment of the Zamindari system after the independence of India. The last ruling Zamindar of Sagardighi and the surrounding areas of Ratanpur was Bimal Singh Kothari. His family/descendants continue to live in Calcutta (now Kolkata). Geography Sagardighi is located at Sagardighi CD Block lies in the Rarh region in Murshidabad district. The Bhagirathi River splits the district into two natural physiographic regions ‚Äì Rarh on the west and Bagri on the east. The Rarh region is undulating and contains mostly clay and lateritic clay based soil. As the Rajmahal hills slopes gently down from adjoining Jharkhand it forms the Nabagram plain at the lowest edge of its elevation in this region. The eastern slope of the region is characterised by the existence of numerous cliffs and bluffs. Sagardighi CD Block is bounded by Raghunathganj I and Raghunathganj II CD Blocks in the north, Lalgola CD Block in the east, Nabagram CD Block in the south and Nalhati II CD Block, in Birbhum district, in the west. The Rarh region or the western part of the district is drained by the right bank tributaries of the Bhagirathi, flowing down from the hilly / plateau region of Santhal Pargana division in neighbouring Jharkhand. The Farakka Barrage regulates the flow of water into the Bhagirathi through the feeder canal. Thereafter, it is fed with the discharge from the Mayurakshi system. About 1,800 km2 of area in the neighbourhood of Kandi town is flooded by the combined discharge of the Mayurakshi, Dwarka, Brahmani, Gambhira, Kopai and Bakreshwar ‚Äì the main contributor being the Mayurakshi. Certain other areas in the western sector also get flooded. Sagardighi CD Block has an area of 345.42 km2. It has 1 panchayat samity, 11 gram panchayats, 199 gram sansads (village councils), 197 mouzas and 178 inhabited villages. Sagardighi police station serves this block. Headquarters of this CD Block is at Sagardighi. Rural area under Sagardighi block consists of 11 gram panchayats, viz. Harhari, Balia, Bokhara-I, Kabilpur, Patkeldanga, Bannyeswar, Bokhara-II, Manigram, Sagardighi, Barala, Gobordhandanga and Moregram. Chandpara and Kherur are villages under Monigram gram panchayat. Some 2,000 migratory open-bill storks, locally known as shamukkhol (oyster shell), are found settling every year near the marshy lands in the Milki area of Sagardighi.

A green body is an object whose main constituent is weakly bound clay material, usually in the form of bonded powder or plates before it has been sintered or fired. In ceramic engineering, the most common method for producing ceramic components is to form a green body comprising a mixture of the ceramic material and various organic or inorganic additives, and then to fire it in a kiln to produce a strong, vitrified object. Additives can serve as solvents, dispersants (deflocculants), binders, plasticizers, lubricants, or wetting agents. This method is used because of difficulties with the casting of ceramics ‚Äî due to their extremely high melting temperature and viscosity (relative to other materials such as metals and polymers).

The Society is a non-profit collector-based organization with a world-wide membership of over 1700. The USSS is Affiliate #150 of the American Philatelic Society (APS). Since 1930 the Society has encouraged philatelic study through voluntary membership in specialized committees. Some committees specialize in specific stamp issues like the Washington-Franklin heads, the Prexie or the Liberty Series, while other committees study specialized areas of U.S. philately such as Plate Numbers and Marginal Markings, Private Vending and Affixing Perforations, Booklets and Panes, and Luminescence. Research is made available through published books, research papers and articles in the monthly journal, The United States Specialist.  History  The Society was founded as the Philatelic Plate Number Association in 1926. The name was changed in 1930 to the Bureau Issues Association, recognizing the Association‚Äôs enlarged scope of interest as the entire philatelic output of the Bureau of Engraving and Printing. At that time the Bureau of Engraving and Printing produced all United States postage and revenue stamps. Instead of plate numbers only, the Bureau‚Äôs output of postage and revenue stamps, coils, booklets, possessions, paper, gum, marginal markings, as well as methods of manufacture became subjects of study and collection. In 2000, the organization became the United States Stamp Society. The new name reflects the society‚Äôs continuing focus on U.S. postage and revenue stamps while recognizing the role of non-Bureau contract security printers in stamp design and production. Members of USSS receive the authoritative monthly journal, The United States Specialist, which is devoted to all aspects of U.S. philately. Over the years The Specialist has been especially strong in reporting on stamp printing technology, plate varieties, plate layouts, marginal markings and plate numbering. Many important discoveries in U.S. collecting have been published in its pages which have resulted in new and variety listings in the Scott Specialized Catalogue of U.S. Stamps and Covers.

The director has a key role in choosing the cast members, production design and all the creative aspects of filmmaking. Under European Union law, the director is viewed as the author of the film. The film director gives direction to the cast and crew and creates an overall vision through which a film eventually becomes realized or noticed. Directors need to be able to mediate differences in creative visions and stay within the budget. There are many pathways to becoming a film director. Some film directors started as screenwriters, cinematographers, producers, film editors or actors. Other film directors have attended a film school. Directors use different approaches. Some outline a general plotline and let the actors improvise dialogue, while others control every aspect and demand that the actors and crew follow instructions precisely. Some directors also write their own screenplays or collaborate on screenplays with long-standing writing partners. Some directors edit or appear in their films or compose the music score for their films. Responsibility The film director gives last minute direction to the cast and crew, while filming a historical drama on location in London A film director's task is to envisage a way to translate a screenplay into a fully formed film, and then to realize this vision. To do this, they oversee the artistic and technical elements of film production. This entails organizing the film crew in such a way to achieve their vision of the film and communicating with the actors. This requires skills of group leadership, as well as the ability to maintain a singular focus even in the stressful, fast- paced environment of a film set. Moreover, it is necessary to have an artistic eye to frame shots and to give precise feedback to cast and crew, thus, excellent communication skills are a must. Because the film director depends on the successful cooperation of many different creative individuals with possibly strongly contradicting artistic ideals and visions, he or she also needs to possess conflict-resolution skills to mediate whenever necessary. Thus the director ensures that all individuals involved in the film production are working towards an identical vision for the completed film. The set of varying challenges he or she has to tackle has been described as \\"a multi- dimensional jigsaw puzzle with egos and weather thrown in for good measure\\". It adds to the pressure that the success of a film can influence when and how they will work again, if at all. Generally, the sole superiors of the director are the producers and the studio that is financing the film, although sometimes the director can also be a producer of the same film. The role of a director differs from producers in that producers typically manage the logistics and business operations of the production, whereas the director is tasked with making creative decisions. The director must work within the restrictions of the film's budget and the demands of the producer and studio (such as the need to get a particular age rating). Directors also play an important role in post-production. While the film is still in production, the director sends \\"dailies\\" to the film editor and explains his or her overall vision for the film, allowing the editor to assemble an editor's cut. In post- production, the director works with the editor to edit the material into the director's cut. Well-established directors have the \\"final cut privilege\\", meaning that they have the final say on which edit of the film is released. For other directors, the studio can order further edits without the director's permission. American director Steven Spielberg with Sri Lankan filmmaker Chandran Rutnam in Sri Lanka The director is one of the few positions that requires intimate involvement during every stage of film production. Thus, the position of film director is widely considered to be a highly stressful and demanding one. It has been said that \\"20-hour days are not unusual\\". Some directors also take on additional roles, such as producing, writing or editing. Under European Union law, the film director is considered the \\"author\\" or one of the authors of a film, largely as a result of the influence of auteur theory. Auteur theory is a film criticism concept that holds that a film director's film reflects the director's personal creative vision, as if they were the primary \\"auteur\\" (the French word for \\"author\\"). In spite of‚Äîand sometimes even because of‚Äîthe production of the film as part of an industrial process, the auteur's creative voice is distinct enough to shine through studio interference and the collective process. Career pathways Some film directors started as screenwriters, film editors, producers, actors, or film critics, as well as directing for similar media like television and commercials. Several American cinematographers have become directors, including Barry Sonnenfeld, originally the Coen brothers' DP; Wally Pfister, cinematographer on Christopher Nolan's three Batman films made his directorial debut with Transcendence (2014). Despite the misnomer, assistant director has become a completely separate career path and is not typically a position for aspiring directors, but there are exceptions in some countries such as India where assistant directors are indeed directors-in-training. Education Many film directors have attended a film school to get a bachelor's degree studying film or cinema. Film students generally study the basic skills used in making a film. This includes, for example, preparation, shot lists and storyboards, blocking, communicating with professional actors, communicating with the crew, and reading scripts. Some film schools are equipped with sound stages and post-production facilities. Besides basic technical and logistical skills, students also receive education on the nature of professional relationships that occur during film production. A full degree course can be designed for up to five years of studying. Future directors usually complete short films during their enrollment. The National Film School of Denmark has the student's final projects presented on national TV. Some film schools retain the rights for their students' works. Many directors successfully prepared for making feature films by working in television. The German Film and Television Academy Berlin consequently cooperates with the Berlin/Brandenburg TV station RBB (Berlin-Brandenburg Broadcasting) and ARTE. In recent decades American directors have primarily been coming out of USC, UCLA, AFI, Columbia University, and NYU, each of which are known for cultivating a certain style of filmmaking. Notable film schools outside of the United States include Beijing Film Academy, Centro de Capacitaci√≥n Cinematogr√°fica in Mexico City, Dongseo University in South Korea, FAMU in Prague, Film and Television Institute of India, HFF Munich, La F√©mis in Paris, Tel Aviv University, and Vancouver Film School. Compensation Film directors usually are self employed and hired per project based on recommendations and industry reputation. Compensation might be arranged as a flat fee for the project, as a weekly salary, or as a daily rate. A handful of top Hollywood directors made from $133.3 million to $257.95 million in 2011, such as James Cameron and Steven Spielberg, but the average United States film directors and producers made $89,840 in 2018. A new Hollywood director typically gets paid around $400,000 for directing their first studio film. The average annual salary in Canada is $62,408, and in Western Australia it can range from $75,230 to $97,119. In France, the average salary is ‚Ç¨4000 per month, paid per project. Luc Besson was the highest paid French director in 2017, making ‚Ç¨4.44 million for Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets. That same year, the top ten French directors' salaries in total represented 42% of the total directors' salaries in France. Film directors in Japan average a yearly salary from ¬•4 million to ¬•10 million, and the Directors Guild of Japan requires a minimum payment of ¬•3.5 million. Korean directors make 300 million to 500 million won for a film, and beginning directors start out making around 50 million won. A Korean director who breaks into the Chinese market might make 1 billion won for a single film. Gender disparities According to a 2018 report from UNESCO, the film industry throughout the world has a disproportionately higher number of male directors compared to female directors, and they provide as an example the fact that only 20% of films in Europe are directed by a woman. 44% of graduates from a sample of European films schools are women, and yet only 24% of working film directors in Europe are women. In Hollywood, women make up only 12.6 percent of film directors, as reported by a UCLA study of the 200 top theatrical films of 2017, but that number is a significant increase from 6.9% in 2016. As of 2014, there were only 20 women in the Directors Guild of Japan out of the 550 total members. Bollywood film directors are also greatly underrepresented by women, even compared to other countries, but there has been a recent trend of more attention to women directors in India, brought on partly by Amazon and Netflix moving into the industry. Of the movies produced in Nollywood, women direct only 2%. Awards There are many different awards for film directing, run by various academies, critics associations, film festivals, and guilds. The Academy Award for Best Director and Cannes Film Festival Award for Best Director are considered among the most prestigious awards for directing, and there is even an award for worst directing given out during the Golden Raspberry Awards.

There are many other terms for creams designed to protect skin from harmful substances, including skin protective creams, pre-work creams, antisolvent gels, protective ointments, and shielding lotions. Three classes of barrier creams are used: water repellent creams, water-soluble creams, and creams designed for special applications. Barrier creams may contain substances such as zinc oxide, talc or kaolin to layer over the skin. For hand care they are designed to protect against the harm from detergents and other irritants. The efficacy of barrier creams is controversial. They have not been demonstrated to be useful in preventing hand eczema. A 2018 Cochrane review concluded that the use of moisturizers alone or in combination with barrier creams may result in important protective effects for the prevention of Occupational Irritant Hand Dermatitis (OIHD). They are a poor substitute for protective clothing for workers. Gloves provide a greater protection than barrier creams. However they are reasonably effective for the protection of face against some airborne substances. Some evidence suggests that improper use of barrier cream could cause a harmful rather than a beneficial effect. Skin that has been moisturized by barrier cream may be more susceptible to irritation by sodium lauryl sulfate, which can permeate hydrated skin more easily because of its hydrophilia. Barrier creams that contain petroleum jelly or certain oils may cause rubber or latex gloves to deteriorate.  Medical uses   Hand care  For hand care they are designed to protect against the harm from detergents and other irritants. To help prevent the spread of pathogens, health care providers are required to wash their hands frequently. Frequent hand washing can result in chronic damage termed irritant contact dermatitis which includes dryness, irritation, itching, and more seriously, cracking and bleeding. Irritant contact dermatitis is very common among nurses, ranging from 25% to 55%, with as many as 85% relating a history of having skin problems. The World Health Organization has considered the use of barrier creams and has found their efficacy to be \\"equivocal\\" and too expensive to be considered in health-care settings where resources are limited. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found \\"Two recent randomized, controlled trials that evaluated the skin condition of caregivers demonstrated that barrier creams did not yield better results than did the control lotion or vehicle used. As a result, whether barrier creams are effective in preventing irritant contact dermatitis among health-care workers remains unknown.\\"  Diaper rash  The Great Ormond Street Hospital Manual of Children's Nursing Practices 2012 book found that \\"disposable nappies are effective in drawing fluid away from the skin and can be changed less frequently in the absence of stools, making regular application of barrier creams unnecessary in most children.\\"  Work related  Barrier creams have been used in industry to protect workers' skin from the contaminants encountered in occupations such as nurses, hairdressers, employees in the food processing industry, cleaners, metal workers, printers, bricklayers etc. A 2018 Cochrane review concluded that the use of moisturizers alone or in combination with barrier creams may result in important protective effects for the prevention of Occupational Irritant Hand Dermatitis (OIHD) Barrier creams can be applied before exposure to potential irritants, but are not typically used as the main protection against hazardous substances. They are a poor substitute for protective clothing for workers; in particular, gloves provide greater protection. However barrier creams are reasonably effective for protection of the face against some airborne substances. Active barrier creams containing silicone, tartaric acid, glycerin, and other ingredients are said to be beneficial for some chromate-sensitive construction workers.  Effectiveness  The efficacy of barrier creams is controversial. They have not been demonstrated to be useful in preventing hand eczema. According to the National Safety Council, \\"shielding lotions can keep the skin from drying out\\".  Safety  A 2002 review found \\"some reports indicate that inappropriate BC [barrier cream] application might induce a deleterious rather than a beneficial effect.\\" Skin that has been moisturized by barrier cream may be more susceptible to irritation by sodium lauryl sulfate, which can permeate hydrated skin more easily due to its hydrophilia. When handling hazardous molecules such as sodium hydroxide, ingredients in barrier cream could react and induce skin irritation. Barrier creams that contain petroleum jelly or certain oils may cause rubber or latex gloves to deteriorate.  Mechanism of action  The mechanism of barrier cream varies by product. Three categories of barrier creams are used: water repellent creams, water-soluble creams, and creams designed for special applications. Moisturizing barrier cream acts as a lubricating film on the skin to prevent depletion of water (transepidermal water loss) in the skin's outermost layer, the stratum corneum. This may have a protective effect against irritant contact dermatitis and allergic contact dermatitis, which often result from such depletion. These barrier creams can be classed as occlusives (which prevent loss through a hydrophobic effect), humectants (which absorb water from the dermis and environment due to hygroscopy), or hydrating agents (which both moisturize the skin and maintain its water content). Barrier creams may contain substances such as zinc oxide, talc or kaolin to layer over the skin. Other barrier creams are intended to protect the skin from some external agents, though they are not sufficient to provide a complete barrier.  Society and culture  In 2005, the Internet marketing agency Expansion Plus began promoting the term shielding lotion in a highly successful campaign that relied on planting information in social media so that it would be picked up and spread virally. The basic principle was to place articles on the skinmdnatural.com website that appeared to be reviews, and then distribute links via news sites and press releases, so that the purported reviews would be replicated elsewhere.

He made his literary debut with the novel Graffiti in 1976, under the pseudonym Jo Vendt. Among his best known books are Humlehjertene (1980), Rosapenna (1983), and Metoden (1985). Bauer was awarded Gyldendal's Endowment in 1982, and the Dobloug Prize in 1998. He died of cancer in 1999. Early life Bauer was born 24 July 1943 in Holmenkoll√•sen, Oslo, during the German occupation of Norway. His father was a baker, and an active member of the Norwegian resistance movement. In 1943, he was arrested, while the rest of the family went undercover in Hadeland. Bauer's father was eventually deported to the Sachsenhausen concentration camp, where he died three months before the end of the war. Bauer's family continuously moved from place to place, and Bauer had a hard time adjusting to the changes, and finding friends. He found himself consistently making friends with children of traitors, those who had supported the Germans during the war. \\"We were all innocent children, who had to pay for our fathers' choices. We could understand each other\\", Bauer later said. He used to make up stories about his father's death, a new version for every new place his family moved. He graduated from Oslo Spr√•kskole in 1965, on his second attempt, \\"with a D in Norwegian, as usual\\". Bauer started his literary career translating short stories from Danish to Norwegian for Allers. He quickly advanced to becoming sports reporter for Det Nye, and later a traveling journalist for Vi Menn. He stayed in Paris for more than a year in the late 1960s, and later traveled around Africa. From 1972 on he made frequent visits to Belfast, and made many friends there. Literary career Bauer had grown up with the notion that his father was a war hero, having died as a prisoner of war. As an adult, he learned that his father had in fact died of methanol poisoning, having gotten hold of what he thought was alcohol. In his autobiographical debut novel, Graffiti (1976), Bauer confronted his mother with the fact that she had kept this secret from him. \\"I grew up in a lie about a man I have never known\\", he commented. Because of the novel's contents, one of his relatives insisted that he publish it under a pseudonym, to protect his mother. Despite \\"having nothing to hide [him]self\\", he therefore released the novel under the pen name Jo Vendt. Graffiti was very well received by critics. Roar Petersen of Verdens Gang noted the poetic quality of many of the passages in the novel. Johan Borgen described the debut as \\"measuring 7.3 on the Richter earthquake scale\\". Bauer published the freestanding sequel to Graffiti, Bulk (1978), under his own name. The novel depicts a young man returning to Oslo after spending some time at sea. Alcoholism is a central theme, both the protagonist and his mother are portrayed as heavy drinkers. His next novel, Humlehjertene (1980), depicts the protagonist's stay in Paris from 1967 to 1969, where he becomes involved in the May 1968 student riots. The novel was heavily based on Bauer's own experiences from Paris during the same period. \\"I suppose every writer actually writes about themselves\\", he told Verdens Gang. The Troubles in Northern Ireland would become the topic of Rosapenna (1983), named after a street in Belfast. Bauer felt that the Norwegian press was giving a one-sided picture of The Troubles, something he wanted to correct. To get the necessary distance to the source material, he decided to let the novel take place in 1973. Bauer himself arrived in Belfast in 1972, shortly after the Bloody Sunday, as a journalist for Vi Menn. He became an eyewitness to the bombing of the Abercorn restaurant in Castle Lane. Bauer could not believe the IRA was responsible for the bombing, and defended them in Vi Menn. He eventually became closely involved with the IRA. \\"England is to blame for the conflict in Northern Ireland. The antagonism is based on economic differences ... this is not a religious war\\", Bauer said in an interview shortly after the release of Rosapenna. Bauer's 1985 novel Metoden introduced the protagonist Bo Brandt, the son of a wealthy, alcoholized, ship-owner. The novel serves both as a crime thriller and a psychological study. Bauer's last novels would revolve around Tom, who starts out as a ten-year-old in Hestehodet√•ken (1992), and returns as a teenager in Svartefot (1995), and a twenty-year-old in Magenta (1997). Bauer referred to the books as \\"a reluctant trilogy\\". In the fourth novel in the series, Forl√∏peren (1999), Tom returns to Norway after spending forty years traveling abroad. The book was finished while Bauer was terminally ill, and released posthumously. Aside from his novels, Bauer was also a playwright. Two of his plays, Vesper (1987) and Brendan (1993), depict the conflict in Northern Ireland. Death and legacy Bauer died 12 June 1999, having been diagnosed with cancer one and a half years before then. Bauer had been involved in a dramatic television production, Jakttid, but as his condition worsened, he prioritized finishing his last novel, Forl√∏peren. It was published 26 August 1999. Three years later, an anthology was published in Bauer's honor. Bauers bok, edited by Lars Saabye Christensen, contained contributions by among others Christensen, Kjartan Fl√∏gstad, Espen Haavardsholm, Per Petterson, Dag Solstad, and Tove Nilsen. He was described by Solstad as extremely well-read, being particularly interested in authors like Louis-Ferdinand C√©line and Jean Genet. In the anthology, Petterson compared Bauer's protagonists to Holden Caulfield of The Catcher in the Rye, a novel important to Bauer. Bauer was survived by his wife Anne Gun, and his daughter, Anya Bauer Hartmark, born in 1972. Bauer had wanted her to be named \\"Mulele\\", after Pierre Mulele, and Bauer and his friends would refer to her using the nickname Mulle as a tribute to the Congolese revolutionary.

On July 22, 2008 Murong made the long list for the Man Asian Literary Prize. , his microblog account has nearly 1.1 million followers. Murong's writing deals mostly with social issues in contemporary China, exploring themes such as corruption, business-government relations, and general disillusionment over modern life. His literature is known for its nihilistic, realist, racy, and fatalist style. Following his rise to fame, Murong has emerged as one of the foremost critics of censorship in China. Criticism of censorship In 2009, Murong Xuecun wrote an expos√© on a pyramid scheme in Jiangxi province. The work, China: In the Absence of a Remedy (), was a first- hand account of Murong's personal experiences with the pyramid scheme network that lasted twenty-three days. Murong Xuecun was awarded the 2010 People's Literature Prize () for the work. In his acceptance speech for the Prize, Murong wrote a scathing commentary about his editor that he worked with for China: In the absence of a remedy. He also launched into a critique of the state of censorship in China in general. The speech was banned at the awards ceremony, but made its rounds across the internet. The draft of the speech was translated into English and delivered to the Hong Kong Foreign Correspondents‚Äô Club in February 2011, followed by a publication by The New York Times in November 2011. In the draft, Murong alluded to a wide array of censorship restrictions, including limits on discussing current affairs, contemporary personalities, and being forced to change the phrase \\"Chinese people\\" to \\"some people\\" in parts of his work. More obscure restrictions were also discussed, such as scrubbing the use of \\"Henan people\\" because it carries the air of regional discrimination, and removing references to \\"India-flavoured farts\\" because the editor was concerned about a diplomatic rift between China and India. Murong wrote that \\"The only truth is that we cannot speak the truth . The only acceptable viewpoint is that we cannot express a viewpoint. We cannot criticise the system, we cannot discuss current affairs, we cannot even mention distant Ethiopia.\\" In his feature story in Norwegian newspaper Aftenposten in 2011, his criticism of Chinese authorities included claims that for detainees of China, there are a number of \\"odd ways of dying while under arrest\\" ‚Äî at least one individual allegedly \\"died while playing hide-and- seek\\", and at least another allegedly \\"died while he was drinking water\\", and at least one allegedly \\"died while he was dreaming\\".

The owners of the windmill maximized the view on the butte overlooking Paris, creating a terrace for viewing and a dance hall for entertainment. The windmill paintings are a subset of paintings from Van Gogh's Montmartre series. Paris In 1886 van Gogh left the Netherlands for Paris and the guidance of his brother Theo van Gogh. While van Gogh had been influenced by great Dutch masters, coming to Paris meant that he would have the opportunity to be influenced by Impressionists, Symbolists, Pointillists, and Japanese art. His circle of friends included √âmile Bernard, Paul Gauguin, Camille Pissarro, Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, and others. Montmartre, a butte overlooking Paris, was known for its bars, cafes, and dance-hall. It was also located on the edge of countryside that afforded van Gogh the opportunity to work on paintings of rural settings while living in Paris. The landscape and windmills around Montmartre were the source of inspiration for a number of van Gogh's paintings. Moulin de la Galette, the windmill still mounted over the moved establishment, is located near the apartment that van Gogh shared with his brother Theo from 1886 until 1888. Built in 1622, it was originally called Blute-Fin and belonged to the Debray family in the 19th century. Van Gogh met artists such as Toulouse-Lautrec, Paul Signac and Paul Gauguin who inspired him to incorporate Impressionism into his artwork. Among other things, this resulted in lighter, more colorful works of art. Moulin de la Galette was also the name of an outdoor dance hall that was located between two of the last windmills on a Montmartre hilltop. In addition to van Gogh, Toulouse-Lautrec and Pierre-Auguste Renoir also painted Moulin de la Galette. Renoir's painting of the dance hall is titled Bal du moulin de la Galette. The paintings Three paintings with similar compositions In van Gogh‚Äôs first year in Paris he painted rural areas around Montmartre, such as the butte and its windmills. The colors were sometimes somber, and evoke a sense of his anxiety and loneliness, while other paintings were bright and evoked an enthusiastic intense nature.

Influenced by Impressionism, van Gogh's painted this work with lighter colors and unrestrained brushstrokes to capture light and movement. Van Gogh made the painting from an empty lot on rue Lepic, the street in which he lived with Theo. The painting features the Moulin de Blute-Fin, a 17th-century grain-mill, which was an attraction for its views of Paris. At this time there were three windmills on the butte, but this was the windmill van Gogh favored as a subject for his paintings. Moulin a Poivre, a second windmill, is just inside the left frame of the painting on the horizon. The painting was sold by Scottish art dealer Alex Reid to William McInnes and with van Gogh's Portrait of Alexander Reid is in the collection of Glasgow Museums. Le Moulin de la Galette (F348) is an example how van Gogh used a technique for heavily applying paint called impasto that it created a relief effect, partly to convey emotion. The brushstrokes in the windmill and doorsteps are noticeable. The faces of the two people were created with just a couple of brushstrokes.

The Historic Cairo Restoration Project (HCRP) is an effort by the governments of Egypt and Cairo to restore and renovate historic Medieval Islamic Cairo.

The main project's intention is to create new museums in a sequence of historical sites in an open-air museum district, that will be widely accessible to both the citizens of Cairo and tourists. The project is currently focused on restoring historic landmarks from the medieval Fatamid era in Cairo (969 CE - 1250 CE). The number of potential historic monuments is estimated between 450 and 630 structures. According to the Ministry of Culture, the HCRP plan is to \\"transform the whole area into an open-air museum.\\" The HCRP is first focusing on this Islamic arts district in order to be a part of the Museum With No Frontiers. This is a museum organized by the European Union, and the Fatimid area project will be a part of its Euromed Heritage program ‚Äî \\"Islamic Art in the Mediterranean.\\" Projects A primary concept of the project is to feature the actual historical sites as the main exhibits for this open-air museum by providing extensive information resources and catalogs on-site at each of them. Visitors would therefore be able to truly experience medieval Egyptian culture and history by seeing the structures and sites while concurrently learning more about them from the on- site resources. As a part of this project, to increase pedestrian accessibility there are plans to create a paved walkway along al-Muizz li-Din Allah, the main ceremonial path of Fatimid Cairo. There are also plans to demolish less significant adjacent vernacular structures to create large garden settings surrounding the landmarks. A section of the primary HCRP project site, al-Muizz li-Din Allah street and buildings. Criticisms Medieval context The HCRP has issued many plans, which have been met with resistance by some Cairens, the citizens of Cairo. For example, the plans to create gardens and walkways is seen by some as an assault on the original dense medieval layout and 'urban fabric' of Fatimid Cairo that diminishes the historical value of the retained sites. The reasoning is that in Medieval Cairo, the context of a building was determined by its relationship to neighboring buildings. Buildings and monuments of importance were intentionally constructed adjacent to conventional ones, to convey and enhance their high stature and prestige. It is this urban clustering and juxtaposition that actually gives the landmark buildings authentic context and meaning for visitors to experience. Some Cairens think that by eliminating this context from the buildings the HCRP is lessening the value and historical understanding of their heritage sites. Some architectural conservation experts have claimed the HCRP has used incorrect building materials in its conservation work. Other conservation experts counter that the massive and immediate intervention for landmarks, despite the inevitable mistakes, has stopped the threat of many just disappearing. Funding Some residents of historic Cairo have also become suspicious of the HCRP motives, questioning if the project really has historical preservation and interpretation as its true primary intention. Some believe that tourism and commerce are instead the main reason for the project's creation and funding. The large amount of spending necessary for the intended project has also become a point of controversy, with some estimates as high as $350 million. Some residents believe that the massive cost of creating the open-air museum and restoring its landmarks would be better spent for other local public social and economic needs.

Organization and purpose The American Physician Scientists Association (APSA) is a national organization dedicated to addressing the needs of future physician-scientists with respect to their training and career development. APSA strives to be the student physician-scientists' leading voice for improving educational opportunities, advancing patient-oriented research, and advocating for the future of translational medicine. In this regard, it carries out local and national initiatives, provides student leadership opportunities, facilitates communication between physician-scientist trainees, and hosts a joint annual meeting for its members. It also collaborates with leading research and health organizations, including the National Institutes of Health. History The American Physician Scientists Association was initially conceived in 2003-2004 and formally incorporated in 2005 by a group of MD-PhD students. Since then, the organization been rapidly expanding, and is currently officially represented at almost 100 institutions across the U.S. Its growing membership has helped make it the largest organization specifically representing physician-scientist trainees. Leadership The American Physician Scientists Association is led by the Executive Council. Executive Council members are voted in by Institutional Representatives. These are physician-scientist trainees and APSA members who serve as liaisons between students at local institutions and the APSA leadership. Institutional Representatives help the Executive Council better grasp the needs of trainees at their local institutions. The Executive Council is overseen by the Board of Directors, which serves as an advisory board to the rest of the organization, and consists of active physician-scientists and former APSA Executive Council members. In addition to the Board of Directors and Executive Council, there are five standing committees who lead most of APSA's projects. Members of the APSA have the opportunity to serve on any of the organization's five standing committees, each of which has a unique role within the organization to help it achieve its mission. Currently, the standing committees operate in the areas of organizational finances, membership recruitment, organizational policy, public relations, and Annual Meeting planning. APSA also works with numerous partner organizations and supporters. Meetings The APSA has held its Annual Meeting since April 2005 in conjunction with the American Society for Clinical Investigation and the Association of American Physicians in Chicago, Illinois. The meeting serves as an opportunity for mentoring and networking across the entire spectrum of the physician-scientist career pathway, including career development sessions and panels. A number of prominent speakers have been featured at these meetings including current NIH Director Francis Collins, nobel prize winner and current National Cancer Institute director Harold Varmus. Several dozen competitive travel grants are typically available for APSA members who wish to present their research at the meeting. The Annual Meeting is also when the Executive Council of APSA meets to conduct a yearly review, propose future initiatives, and vote for positions on next year's Executive Council. Starting in 2006, the APSA began hosting regional meetings and currently hosts four in the fall of each year in cities across the United States. The primary focus of these regional meetings is on building a regional community of physician-scientist trainees and focusing on outreach to current and future trainees who are unable to attend the Annual Meeting.

Military hospital 1647 it is turned into a refuge and a hospital, coinciding with the plague that ravaged the nation. It was reconstructed and widened when the plague ended. Also in the War of the French, at the beginning of the 19th century, it served as a field hospital, that is, a French military hospital. It was rehabilitated for religious purposes in 1829. Remodelling The present Hermitage, which is a single story with simple steeples, is from 1682, according to Sarthou Carreres. It is documented that it underwent work in 1726, directed by Jose Vilavalle, who built the espada√±a, the pulpit, part of the roof, the sacristy, the steps of the altar, the pavement and remodelled the outside. The pulpit, the center, as well as the main altar have disappeared, from 1726, surely the work of one of the Ochando brothers. It was consecrated again, after the 1936-1939 war ended, with a new image created by the Almassoran sculptor, Enrique Serra. It underwent several renovations in 1984 and 1991. To the left of the presbytery there is a painting by Enrique Limo containing a scene of the life of the saint. The current bell is modern, dating from 1940.

Biography  Zhou was born on April 1, 1914. In 1930, he left his home in Linquan County, Anhui and traveled to Beiping to study and participate in the student movement there. In 1932, he participated in a peripheral organization of the Communist Party of China, the Great Anti-Imperialist Alliance, for which he undertook underground communications work. In January 1936, Zhou formally joined the Communist Party. From 1940 to 1946, he worked in the Xi'an office of the Eighth Route Army, and became the office's section chief and then office chief. Under an atmosphere of White Terror, Zhou completed every assignment put before him. For this, he received praise and affirmation from Mao Zedong, Zhou Enlai, Ren Bishi, and other central leaders. In April 1947, he was transferred to the secretariat of the United Front Work Department, where he became vice-head of the department, and then the department head.

It is found in shallow water on sandy bottoms and sometimes adjacent to reefs. This species is closely related to the lesser electric ray (Narcine bancroftii) from the western Atlantic, and may represent the same species. The specific epithet entemedor seems to be the Spanish equivalent of \\"intimidator\\". This species attains a maximum length of 76 cm (30 in). The flattened pectoral fin disk is round, as long as it is wide, and overlapping the origin of the large pelvic fins. The eyes are much smaller than the spiracles, which are edged with small tubercles. The nostril on each side is not divided into two separate apertures. The teeth are mostly exposed when the mouth is closed. The tail is equal in length to the disk, with loose lateral folds of skin and two dorsal fins of equal size. The tips of the dorsal and caudal fins are angular. The skin is soft and loose, without denticles or thorns. The coloration is generally grayish tan to brown above; some individuals have several pairs of faint ocelli. The dorsal and caudal fins often darken towards the tips but have fine white margins.Murch, A. CORTEZ ELECTRIC RAY. Elasmodiver.com. Retrieved on February 15, 2009. There is a record of a partially albino adult female, measuring 69 cm (27 in) long. Like other numbfishes, the giant electric ray can deliver a painful electric shock. This species is nocturnal and spends the day half-buried under sand. At night, it moves into shallow bays to feed, mostly on polychaete worms but perhaps also on sea squirts. It moves along the bottom by \\"hopping\\" on its flexible ribbed pelvic fins. If threatened by a predator, it exhibits a characteristic defense behavior in which it erupts from the bottom, arches its back, and performs a \\"somersault\\" in the water column. In one case, a diver was shocked when the ray landed on his back after such a maneuver. Reproduction is ovoviviparous, in which the developing embryos are nourished by uterine \\"milk\\" produced by the mother. The females give birth to 4-15 young, measuring 11‚Äì12 cm (4.3-4.7 in) long. The reproductive cycle is annual, with ovulation and fertilization taking place in July and August.Downton- Hoffmann, C.A. and Villavicencio-Garayzar, C.J.

It was first performed on 26 January 1730, at Goodman's Fields after it was rejected by the Theatre Royal. The play, well received at Goodman's Fields, depicts a young law student forsaking his studies for pleasure. By portraying hypocrisy in a comedic manner, Fielding shifts his focus from a discussion of love and lovers. The play's relative success when compared to other plays at Goodman's Fields was in part caused by the relative freedom granted by Goodman's Fields, though the play was not dramatically different from Fielding's first play, Love in Several Masques. No contemporary reviews exist. Modern critics generally view it as an improvement in Fielding's playwriting while still considering it to have several weaknesses. Background Fielding wrote The Temple Beau sometime after leaving Leiden in April 1729. It was the fourth play that Fielding wrote and he finished it by the end of 1729.Fielding 2004 p. 99 Although his first play was performed at the Theatre Royal, The Temple Beau was rejected by the theatre.Rivero p. 23 He turned to Goodman's Fields and the play was first advertised, in the 16 January 1730 Daily Journal, as being rehearsed and to open 22 January.

Three of the nights were author's benefits.Battestin and Battestin 1993 p. 80 For the first author's benefit on 28 January, Fielding added a new song titled \\"Like the Whig and the Tory\\". Later showings of the play came immediately on 10 February and 3 March 1730. Other revivals included showings on 5 June and 9 July 1730 but it slowly disappeared, with only two showings the next year, on 13 March and 4 December 1731, and a later revival in 1736 on 25 March and 27 April, all taking place at Goodman's Fields. A revised version of the play titled The Temple Beau; or, The Intriguing Sisters was performed on 21 September 1782 at the Haymarket theatre.Fielding 2004 pp. 103‚Äì104 On 2 February 1730, it was published along with a prologue added by James Ralph that attacked the treatment of authors by society, making the beginning of a theatrical relationship between Ralph and Fielding.Battestin and Battestin 1993 pp. 80‚Äì81 The publication was advertised in The St. James's Evening Post, the London Evening Post, the Whitehall Evening Post, and the Monthly Chronicle. The edition printed was the only London edition of the play on its own with a Dublin edition printed in 1730. The play was later collected in Arthur Murphy's edition of Fielding's Works (1762).Fielding 2004 p. 106 Cast The cast according to the printed billing:Fielding 2004 p. 112 * Wilding ‚Äî played by Mr Giffard * Pedant ‚Äî played by Mr. Bullock (William Bullock, Jr.) * Veromil ‚Äî played by Mr. W. Giffard * Bellaria ‚Äî played by Mrs. Purden * Valentine ‚Äî played by Mr. Williams * Clarissa ‚Äî Played by Mrs. Seal * Sir Avarice Pedant;‚Äî played by Mr Collet * Lady Gravely ‚Äî Sister of Sir Avarice, played by Mrs. Haughton * Lady Lucy Pendant ‚Äî Wife of Sir Avarice, played by Mrs. Giffard * Sir Harry Wilding ‚Äî Father of Wilding, played by Mr. Penkethman (William Penkethman, Jr.) * Pincet ‚Äî Servant of Wilding, played by Mr. Bardin * Other characters ‚Äî a Taylor, a Perriwig-maker, Servants * Epilogue spoken by Mrs. GiffardFielding 2004 p. 180 * Singing in Act 2 and Act 3 by Miss ThornowetsFielding 2004 p. 1182 Plot Wilding is a young law student who gives up his studies to seek pleasure. He is a rake who uses people and wishes to marry Bellaria simply for money. Unlike Love in Several Masques, Fielding cares more about revealing hypocrisy than with a discussion of love and lovers, but he portrays the hypocrites in a manner that emphasises a comedic response instead of censure. Other characters want to have Bellaria, including the virtuous man Veromil and his foil Valentine who is unable to control his desires for Bellaria. Valentine eventually pairs with Clarissa, a character of little substance within the play, Veromil marries Bellaria, and Wilding does not marry.Rivero 1989 pp. 24‚Äì26 Themes The play's rejection by the Theatre Royal proved beneficial to Fielding because it allowed him to experiment with his plays in ways that would be unaccepted at larger locations.Rivero 1989 p. 23 This is not to say that the play was different from his first; The Temple Beau (1730), like Love in Several Masques (1728), exemplified Fielding's understanding of traditional Post-Restoration comedic form.Rivero 1989 pp. 3 The connections are deeper, and, as Harold Pagliaro believes, that \\"Though The Temple Beau is more complex in its intrigues than is Fielding's first play, both promote the ideal of love and marriage, showing money to be necessary for a happy marriage but bad as the primary reason for it.\\"Pagliaro 1998 pp. 61‚Äì62 The Temple Beau is straightforward unlike Love in Several Masques, and it relies on a simpler set of patterns: instead of triplicates, the images are repeated only once. Additionally, many of the characters are analogous to the roles of the characters within the other play (Wilding and Wisemore, Veromil and Merital, Valentine and Malvil, etc.). However, the plot of the two plays are different because Fielding focuses more on hypocrisy and how characters interact with Wilding. Bellaria's two aunts, Lady Pedant and Lady Gravely, representing immodesty and prudishness respectively, try to influence her actions; Bellaria is able to avoid the suggestions of both, and believes that one should not hide their love for another and should be passionate towards a virtuous man.Rivero 1989 pp. 25‚Äì27 When it comes to matters of gender, the play expresses a view of equality between the sexes that manifests in marriage. However, the play reveals that there are different standards for the genders even though the male characters may express concerns about these double standards.Pagliaro 1998 p. 62 Critical response The Temple Beau was one of the best received new plays at Goodman's Fields, with only James Ralph's The Fashionable Lady as a rival. Its initial run lasted for an equal amount of time during April 1730. The Daily Journal reported that the play was well received.Fielding p. 103 On the author's benefit nights, Fielding was able to raise about 100 pounds.Hume 1988 p. 51 There are no direct contemporary reviews on The Temple Beau that have survived. A few plays may have been influenced by The Temple Beau, including Theophilus Cibber's The Lovers (1730) or Benjamin Hoadly's The Suspicious Husband (1747). The play was mostly ignored until John Genest, in Some Account of the English Stage, from the Restoration in 1660 to 1830 (1832), declared the play as better than Fielding's other plays with little explanation as to why.Fielding 2004 pp. 104‚Äì105 In 1911, Austin Dobson wrote, \\"The Temple Beau certainly shows an advance upon its predecessor; but it is an advance in the same direction, imitation of Congreve.\\"Dobson 1911 p. 13 Leslie Stephen backs this up by saying that the play is \\"much in the vein of the first, with less smartness in dialogue\\".Fielding 2004 qtd p. 105 F. Homes Dudden declared The Temple Beau as \\"a fairly good comedy of intrigue\\" and says that \\"The plot of the comedy, though rather too complicated, is more skilfully constructed than that of Love in Several Masques, and some of the situations are diverting. One of the best things in the piece is the interview between the deluded Sir Harry [...] young Wilding [...] and Pincet\\".Dudden 1966 p. 46 Robert Hume believed that \\"Fielding had begun to master the mechanics of intrigue comedy. The results are not wonderful, but they show distinctly more technical competence. Fielding still employs more characters than he can comfortably control [...] but at least he involves them in related complications.\\"Hume 1988 p. 49 Albert Rivero believed that \\"The initial rejection of The Temple Beau, however, convinced Fielding that his future success would depend on his ability to satisfy the town's taste for less conventional entertainments.\\"Rivero 1989 pp. 3‚Äì4 Harold Pagliaro describes the play by saying, \\"Though the dramatic structure of The Temple Beau is improved over that of Fielding's first play, it has some obvious weaknesses. The lovers are too nearly perfect to engage us in what is or ought to be their burdensome complication of distress. They are so sure of each other and of themselves that they are unassailable, however threatened by the loss of love, freedom and financial self- sufficiency.\\"Pagliaro 1998 p. 63 Notes References * Battestin, Martin, and Battestin, Ruthe.

During the uprising a merchant and the town sheriff were killed and others were whipped. Several buildings were also destroyed during the riots. Somby was executed by beheading in 1854. Mons Aslaksen Somby was married to Inger Johannesdatter H√¶tta, with whom he had a son. Early life Mons Somby and his siblings were converts to the Laestadian Movement at the end of the 1840s, but because of the excesses of the Norwegian locals and government they became an extremist group and by the early 1850s they were no longer receiving advice from Lars Levi Laestadius, the leader of the religious movement. During the summer of 1851, Mons was arrested and sentenced to 15 days imprisonment on bread and water for the disruption of the religious services in the Skjerv√∏y Church. His brother, also involved in the disruption, suffered the same punishment, while his sister was sentenced to 10 days in prison on bread and water. After their release, they traveled to a large siida headed by their father Aslak Olsen Somby during the summer of 1852. It was from this siida which the Kautokeino rebellion was carried out. Aftermath of the Kautokeino rebellion Mons also had a 25-year-old brother who participated in the uprising, named Ole Somby, who died of a brain injury after being hit in the head with a bat while trying to escape capture during the transport from Kautokeino to Alta. The death penalty was not invoked for his sister Marit Somby, but she died in prison before her case came to trial. His father, Aslak Olsen Somby, was sentenced to life imprisonment. Their mother, Inger Mons Siridotter, who was 60 years old during the rebellion, was prosecuted, but was found innocent of the charges. Mons Aslaksen Somby and Aslak Jacobsen H√¶tta were sentenced to death and decapitated at Elvebakken in Alta, Norway on 14 October 1854. After their execution, their bodies were buried in graves just outside the K√•fjord church graveyard in Alta, which meant that they were outside the Norwegian State Church's blessing. However, their heads were sent on to the Anatomisk Institute at the Kong Medical Frederiks University in Oslo, where they became part of the university's skull collections. Retrieval of Mons Somby's skull In 1985, a relative of Mons Somby, Niillas Somby tried to obtain Mons skull for proper burial, but the Anatomisk Institute refused the extradition, claiming that the skull was the department's property. The department also stated that Mons Somby was a convicted criminal and a murderer and that no attempt should be made to describe Mons as a martyr to any cause. After the Norwegian Television NRK of Finnmark aired a story about the case in 1996, the president of the Sami Parliament took up the issue up with university and shortly afterward, the skulls of both Mons and Aslak H√¶tta were released to relatives. In November 1997, the skulls of both Mons Somby and Aslak H√¶tta were buried in a grave at the K√•fjord Church in Alta, at the same spot as their bodies were buried over one-hundred and forty years earlier. The story of the extradition of Mons Sombys skull to Niillas was the focus of the 2000 movie, Give Us Our Skeletons. General references *Nellejet Zorgdrager.

The lands of the Mississippi River Basin were inhabited by Paleo-Indians and later Native American tribes of the Mississippian culture for thousands of years. The Tipton Phase people and the Chickasaw Indian tribe populated the Mississippi River valley near Randolph during the Mississippian period. In 1541, Spanish explorer Hernando de Soto crossed the Mississippi River at or near Randolph. French explorer Cavelier de La Salle built the first French fortification at or near Randolph on his 1682 canoe expedition of the Mississippi River. European settlers arrived in the area around 1800. The town of Randolph was founded in the 1820s as one of the earliest European settlements in Tipton County. The location of Randolph, on the second Chickasaw Bluff along the banks of the Mississippi River, just south of the lower mouth of the Hatchie River, provided for an ideal harbor for flatboats and steamboats and made the town an early center of river commerce in West Tennessee. Randolph shipped more cotton annually than Memphis until 1840. The commercial success of the community also depended on the use of slave labor in the cotton fields surrounding the settlement. In 1827, the Randolph Post office was established and in 1834, the first pastor was appointed to the Randolph Methodist congregation. The fortunes of the community began to decline in the late 1840s due to failed railroad development, an unfavorable mail route and an unsuccessful attempt to move the county seat from Covington to Randolph. An unfinished project to cut a canal from the Hatchie River to the Tennessee River and other factors also contributed to the commercial demise of the town. The first Confederate States Army fort in Tennessee was built at Randolph early in the American Civil War in 1861; a second fortification at Randolph was constructed later that same year. During the Civil War, the town was burned down twice by Union Army forces, which further promoted the decline of the once flourishing community. In 2008, Randolph Bluff Historic Park was dedicated. The park is intended to promote the Civil War history of the community and make the unique views of the Mississippi River available to a wider public. Once finished, the park will be part of the Mississippi River Corridor Tennessee, a project to \\"create a scenic byway that connects historic sites along the Mississippi River\\". As of 2008, Randolph has a population of ca. 200 and consists of about two dozen dwellings. The economy of the rural community is dominated by agriculture with no major industries and businesses present. Indian cultures From about 10,000 BCE, Paleo-Indians and later Archaic-Indians lived as communities of hunter-gatherers in the area that covers the modern day southern United States. Approximately 800 CE to 1600 CE, the Mississippi River Delta was populated by tribes of the Mississippian culture, a mound-building Native American people that had developed in the late Woodland Indian period. The Tipton Phase people were a local expression of the Mississippian culture. They inhabited the region of modern-day Tipton County during the time of first contact with Europeans, at the arrival of the de Soto Expedition. By the end of the Mississippian period the land was claimed and populated by the Chickasaw tribe. The exact origins of the Chickasaw are uncertain. Several prehistoric Indian settlements were located in the vicinity of what would later become Randolph. European explorers Hernando de Soto De Soto's first view of the Mississippi River Hernando de Soto (c. 1496‚Äì1542) was a Spanish explorer who led the first European expedition deep into the territory of the modern United States and the first European documented to have discovered the Mississippi River. In 1541, De Soto and 400 men reached the Mississippi River in the area of what is modern Shelby County in southwest Tennessee or DeSoto County in northwest Mississippi. Within four weeks of their arrival, the expedition had built several floats in order to cross the river and continue their expedition westward into what would later become Arkansas territory. There is a documented controversy about the exact location of Hernando de Soto's crossing over the Mississippi River. A report published in 1874 suggests that \\"De Soto (...) traveled up to Randolph, and there built boats and crossed the river\\". Other documentations claim that it is \\"generally believed and (...) probably true\\" that De Soto crossed the Mississippi River at Memphis. Cavelier de La Salle Ren√©-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle (1643‚Äì87) was a French explorer. In 1682, La Salle led a canoe expedition to explore the Mississippi River basin. The expedition landed to hunt, when one of their members went missing. The armorer Pierre Prudhomme was assumed captured by Chickasaw Indians. La Salle decided to stay and search for the missing member. La Salle had a stockade built and named it Fort Prudhomme, after their lost man. This was the first structure built by the French in Tennessee. Days later, the missing member found his way back. Prudhomme had lost his way while hunting. The expedition reached the mouth of the Mississippi River on April 6, 1682. The exact location of Fort Prudhomme is unknown. Some historians claim that Fort Prudhomme was built on the first Chickasaw Bluff, in modern-day Lauderdale County. The Tennessee Encyclopedia of History and Culture suggests that the fort was constructed on the second Chickasaw Bluff near modern-day Randolph. Other research mentions the third Chickasaw Bluff as the location of the fort, at the border of modern Tipton and Shelby Counties. Again other sources assume that the fourth Chickasaw Bluff in modern Shelby County at Memphis was the location of Fort Prudhomme. European settlement Modern replica of an early 1800s flatboat Around 1800, Europeans began settling the land east of the Mississippi River that was inhabited by the Chickasaw Indians for centuries prior to the arrival of Europeans. Chickasaw land in West Tennessee and southwestern Kentucky was ceded in the Jackson Purchase after negotiations in which the United States was represented by General Andrew Jackson and Governor Isaac Shelby, while the Chickasaw were represented by their chiefs and warriors. In 1818, both sides agreed to the transfer by signing the Treaty of Tuscaloosa. In the treaty, the United States agreed to pay the Chickasaw $300,000 in return for the right to the land east of the Mississippi River and north of the Mississippi state line. Early European landowners were eager to secure their investment in land in southwest Tennessee. Years before Randolph would be founded, wealthy and influential investors tried to find ways to get a return on their share of land. In 1818, Judge John Overton wrote to General James Winchester that \\"We must not let the owners of the property on the Bluffs at the Mississippi above us be beforehand in laying off town‚Äîas it might damp the sale of ours\\". Overton and Winchester founded Memphis, Tennessee along with Andrew Jackson in 1819. Overton, Winchester and Jackson were trying to secure investments in property in the Memphis area that they owned and not give the advantage to investors \\"above\\", north of Memphis on the Mississippi River, in Randolph. Andrew Jackson (1767‚Äì1845) would become the 7th President of the United States in 1829. Both Memphis and Randolph are located on one of the four Chickasaw Bluffs, Randolph on the second and Memphis on the fourth. In the early 19th century, the terrain of the Chickasaw Bluffs provided promising locations for a harbor on the Mississippi River for both emerging towns. In 1820, the area that would become Randolph had an estimated population of 54. Establishment Mississippi River steamboat (1815) Early in the 1820s, landowners and investors John T. Brown and Robert Bedford were the proprietors of the land on the second Chickasaw Bluff that would form Randolph a few years later. Only north of Memphis by water, they described the area as \\"a good landing for Mississippi River flatboats\\". The Hatchie River, joining the Mississippi River just north of the second Chickasaw Bluff, was accessible to steamboats for upriver to Bolivar, in Hardeman County. Brown and Bedford chose the site on the second Chickasaw Bluff to lay out the plan for Randolph, a promising river town. The Tennessee Encyclopedia of History and Culture gives the date of Randolph's official establishment as 1823. Other reports date the foundation to 1827 or 1828. The founders of Randolph named the community for John Randolph (1773‚Äì1833), a leader in the United States Congress from Virginia and spokesman for the \\"Old Republican\\" faction of the Democratic- Republican Party. The Old Republican faction wanted to restrict the federal government's roles. Cotton commerce Success Schematic map of Randolph, ca. 1835Map adapted from material by: Magness, Perre (September 15, 1988), Randolph dominated early river towns, Commercial Appeal, Memphis, Tennessee, History column, p. N2. (Map is not to scale, but showing approximate alignment of streets in ca. 1835. North is to the left.) Located on the banks of the Mississippi River on the second Chickasaw Bluff, the topology of Randolph provided for an ideal harbor for steamboats and flatboats at all stages of the river. Randolph became the center of steamboat commerce in Tennessee and an important cotton shipping point in the 1830s. The town was an early rival of Memphis over commercial superiority on the Mississippi River. In 1830, Randolph was the most important shipping point in Tennessee. In the mid-1830s, Randolph shipped 35,000 to 40,000 bales of cotton on the Mississippi River every year, in 1839 cotton shipments added up to 20,000 to 25,000 bales. More cotton was shipped from Randolph than from Memphis until 1840. At the peak of its commercial success, the community was called the \\"great steamboat depot of West Tennessee\\". By 1829, Randolph had three commission warehouses, six dry goods stores, ten physicians and one tavern; 20 to 30 families were making their living in the area around Randolph. Early in the 1830s, the town developed quickly. Randolph had a population of approximately 1,000 people in 1834. By that time, the town had four hotels, almost fifty businesses, one of them a distillery, several private schools, and more than ten saloons. \\"Some time in the thirties\\" of the 19th century, the first bank was founded in Randolph. In the 1830s, two newspapers were published in Randolph, the Randolph Recorder and the Randolph Whig. The Randolph Recorder was founded in 1834 by F. S. Latham as the first newspaper in Tipton County. The paper continued business until 1836. The first issue of the Randolph Recorder was published on June 21, 1834, and the last publication of the newspaper dates to September 23, 1836. The Randolph Whig was established either late in 1836 or early in 1837 and published its first issue on January 6, 1838. The Randolph Whig did not last long. Shortly after its establishment, the publication \\"was soon discontinued\\". State Route 59 =Travel routes= A stagecoach line, established in 1833 by James Brown, provided a connection between Randolph and Jackson in Madison County, located about east of Randolph. The stagecoach line offered a convenient alternative for travellers between the two towns and connected the villages along the way twice a week. Heading west from Jackson, the antebellum stage line roughly concurs with modern U.S. Route 70 up to Brownsville and State Route 54 from Brownsville to Covington. From Covington, the stage road coincides with modern State Route 59 (SR 59) to Randolph. SR 59 terminates at Richardsons Landing, west of Randolph at the Mississippi River. Later in the 1830s, Randolph was connected by a direct route to Memphis in Shelby County, located about south of Randolph. The road was a segment of a weekly mail line between Jackson and Memphis on which mail was carried on horseback. The route provided a link between the two flourishing towns and connected the settlements on the banks of the Mississippi River in Tipton and Shelby Counties for trade and travel purposes. The exact routing of the mail line between Randolph and Memphis is unknown. =Slavery= Slavery in the U.S.A. 1789‚Äì1861 A good part of the commercial success of Randolph can be attributed to the use of slaves working the cotton fields of the area for their owners. Slavery was common in the Southern States in the time before and during the Civil War. Landowners who ran plantations on their lands, bought slaves to work their fields, mostly for the cultivation of cotton. Corn, beans and peas were also cultivated. In the Randolph Recorder during the early 1830s, landowners announced public auctions of slaves they owned. For the capture and return of runaway slaves, plantation owners offered monetary incentives between $10 and $100. Rewards up to $300 were offered for the return of a stolen slave if the thief of the slave could be convicted of the theft. The Tipton County jail also published \\"jailer's notices\\" in the Randolph Recorder to inform owners of a slave of their incarceration. The abolition of slavery was prepared in Abraham Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation of 1862‚Äì63. Slavery in the United States was eventually abolished when the 13th Amendment to the Constitution was ratified on December 6, 1865. The amendment declared that \\"Neither slavery nor involuntary servitude (...) shall exist within the United States\\". Abraham Lincoln (1809‚Äì65) was the 16th President of the United States. Decline The fortunes of Randolph declined in the later 1840s and the 1850s due to many factors, starting shortly after the establishment of the town. Five years after the settlement was founded, a dispute over the ownership of the land the town was established on, arose over a faulty land title with land owner Ann Grambelling from New York. Until 1835, the pending lawsuit \\"prevented the growth of population\\" in and around Randolph. The residents of the community bought back the land their town was founded on for $8,000 in a settlement. An unfavorable mail line also had an early and lasting influence on the fortunes of the town. When the mail route was established in 1829, it went from Nashville to Jackson, Bolivar, Somerville, Raleigh and ended in Memphis, but Randolph was left out. Randolph was put at the end of a branch route of the mail line and received mail only once a week. Failed railroad development further contributed to the demise of the town; and in 1852, residents of Randolph unsuccessfully tried to move the county seat from Covington to Randolph. The attempt to move the county seat to Randolph was defeated \\"by a bare majority of voters\\". Financial depression and David Crockett's failed attempt to cut a canal from the Hatchie River to the Tennessee River also were problems that had a negative impact on the future of commercial prosperity in Randolph. Early in the Civil War, in March 1862, the town of Randolph is described as consisting of \\"half a dozen or so dilapidated frame houses\\". During the Civil War, the town was burned down twice, in September 1862 and again in 1865, discouraging many residents from re-building residences and businesses a second time. This contributed further to the declining fortunes of the community. Civil War Fort Wright powder magazine at Fort Wright (2008) Fort Wright was the first Confederate Army fortification built at Randolph. On January 20, 1861, the Memphis Appeal published a pro- secessionist proposal to build a fort at Randolph to defend Memphis from invaders. In a communiqu√© sent to LeRoy P. Walker, the first Confederate States Secretary of War, Brigadier General Gideon J. Pillow endorsed Randolph on April 26, 1861 as \\"the most eligible situation for a battery to protect Memphis\\". Within a few days, in late April of that same year, Tennessee Governor Isham G. Harris ordered to establish a camp at Randolph and complete the fortification. About 5,000 troops from Tennessee, Arkansas and the Confederate Army were stationed at the location to accomplish the task. It took four months to fortify the bluff at Randolph with earthen defenses and artillery batteries in order to protect the fort from land and naval attacks. By June 1861, the construction of the fortification was not yet completely finished. However, 50 cannons were reported to be ready at Fort Wright by that time. Nathan Bedford Forrest (1821‚Äì77) and Alexander P. Stewart (1821‚Äì1908) trained at Fort Wright. Other future leaders in the Army of Tennessee and Forrest's cavalry received training at Fort Wright. The fort was Tennessee's first military training camp. Fort Wright was the forwardmost defensive position on the Mississippi River until July 1861, it was abandoned by the Confederate infantry by 1862 but sporadically occupied by other southern forces during the Civil War. In 2008, only a powder magazine is left of Fort Wright. Fort Randolph Union fleet passing Fort Randolph (1865) Fort Randolph, the second Confederate stronghold in the area during the Civil War, was constructed only months after Fort Wright, in Fall 1861. The fortification was situated on the Mississippi River bluffs, about southwest of Fort Wright. In a dispatch published by the New York Times in March 1862, Fort Randolph is described as a \\"rough and incomplete earthwork (...) more than 100 feet above the river\\". The position of the fortification allowed a view of the Mississippi River for , both upstream and downstream. Boats approaching the fort on the river could be detected early from this strong position. Confederate troops at the garrison could prepare for naval attacks on the fort and Union Army supply boats passing on the Mississippi River could be attacked from the elevated position of Fort Randolph without much risk of immediate retaliation. In 2008, Fort Randolph is no longer in existence. Destruction Inside view of the powder magazine at Fort Wright (2008) In 1862, Union Army Major General William T. Sherman (1820‚Äì91) and his troops assumed control of the defeated Confederate stronghold of Memphis and the surrounding areas, including the region of Randolph, located about north of Memphis by land. While trying to keep the area under Union control, Sherman became increasingly \\"frustrated by the constant guerrilla activity in his sector\\". Confederate guerrillas from the Randolph area weakened the Union forces, raiding their supplies and firing at boats that delivered cargo to the invading forces along the Mississippi River. The Union supply ship Eugene was fired at by Confederate bushwhackers at Randolph while carrying supplies to Memphis in September 1862.Buck T. Foster, Sherman's Mississippi Campaign (University of Alabama Press, 2006), pp. 5-6. Frustrated with raids by guerrillas and with the civilians who aided them, Major General Sherman ordered Colonel Charles C. Walcutt of the 46th Ohio Infantry to Randolph. He informed his subordinate officer that \\"the attack on the Eugene was by a small force of guerrillas from Loosahatchie, who by this time have gone back, and therefore you will find no one at Randolph; in which case you will destroy the place, leaving one house to mark the place.\\"Foster, Sherman's Mississippi Campaign, p. 6. Union Army soldiers under Colonel Walcutt's command burned Randolph in retaliation for the guerrilla activities emerging from the area. To his superior officer, Major General Ulysses S. Grant, Sherman reported that he had \\"given public notice that a repetition [of guerrilla attacks] will justify any measures of retaliation, such as loading the boats with guerrilla prisoners where they would receive fire, and expelling families from the comforts of Memphis, whose husbands and brothers go to make up the guerillas.\\" In 1869, Ulysses S. Grant (1822‚Äì85) would become the 18th President of the United States and William T. Sherman would become commanding General of the United States Army. Randolph was burned down a second time by federal soldiers in 1865. Church history Randolph United Methodist Church Randolph United Methodist Church (2008) The town of Randoph was established either in 1823 or a few years later, in 1827 or 1828 by early settlers. In 1834, Reverend Samuel R. Davidson became the first pastor at Randolph. He was appointed by the Tennessee Conference of the United Methodist Church. The Tennessee Conference is an organ of the church focussed on \\"developing principled Christian leaders for the church\\" and also appoints leadership roles in the church. After his appointment as a pastor of the community, a congregation formed around Davidson and built a church at Randolph. Almost 20 years after the Civil War had ended, the second church at Randolph was built by the congregation in 1883. In 1953, construction of a new church building was completed on the second Chickasaw Bluff. The building was remodeled in 1975 and serves as a place of worship for the Methodist congregation of Randolph as of 2008. The United Methodist Church at Randolph had 78 pastors as of 1983. William Clyde Martin (1893‚Äì1984) was born in Randolph and grew up in the Methodist community of the town. Martin would later serve as a bishop of the Methodist Episcopal Church South, The Methodist Church and the United Methodist Church. He also distinguished himself in military service during World War II in the Pacific as a Methodist pastor. Later in his life he would become President of the Methodist Council of Bishops. Bishop Martin retired in 1964 and died in 1984. In 2008, Reverend Thomas M. Yoder and Reverend Ben Rainey are the appointed pastors at the Randolph Methodist community. Randolph United Methodist Church is located at 98 Ballard Slough Road. The worship attendance for the church is reported as 76 members of the congregation on the average. Randolph Assembly of God Randolph Assembly of God is a second place of worship in Randolph, the church was founded in 2001. In 2008, the congregation is led by Pastor Larry Rose and Pastor Frank Russell. Randolph Assembly of God is located at 1135 Randolph Road. Postal history A post office was established at Randolph in 1827. In 1829, a mail line was routed between Nashville and Memphis. The route went through Jackson, Bolivar, Somerville, Arlington and Raleigh to deliver mail to the post offices in these towns three times per week. Randolph was left out of the main route and put at the end of a branch route of the mail line. Mail on the branch route to Randolph was delivered only once weekly. On the segment from Bolivar through Somerville, Arlington and Raleigh to Memphis, the mail route roughly coincides with modern-day U.S. Route 64 (Stage Road). Old Randolph Road in Memphis (2010) In the later 1830s, Randolph was connected to Memphis by a direct travel route. The road was part of a mail line that started in Jackson, it was routed through Brownsville, Covington and Randolph and terminated in Memphis. Mail on the route was carried on horseback and delivered to the post offices along the way on a weekly schedule. The southernmost segment of the mail route provided a direct link between Memphis and Randolph and connected the villages on the Mississippi River along the way for travel and trade purposes. The exact course of the mail line segment between Randolph and Memphis is unknown. A fragment of the route bearing the former road name, about in length, was in existence until about 2005. The remaining piece of Old Randolph Road was located about north of Mud Island and east of the Mississippi River, just south of the mouth of the Loosahatchie River at the western terminus of Klike Avenue in Memphis. In 2010 the remaining fragment of Old Randolph Road is destroyed. The land on which the historic mail route was located is used as an industrial property in 2010 and is owned by the Fullen Dock & Warehouse Company. The property is fenced in and not accessible to the public. The Randolph Post Office was in operation until 1932. The exact location of the post office at Randolph is unknown. In 2008, the U.S. ZIP code for Randolph is 38015 (Burlison, Tennessee). The telephone area code is 901 (Memphis metro area). Modern history Modern cotton processing in West Tennessee (2006) Agriculture is the dominant source of income in the area surrounding Randolph, especially the cultivation of cotton. Corn, beans and peas were also cultivated during the 19th century. After the abolition of slavery in 1865, sharecropping was the primary means of income for low income families in the area. Mostly for the cultivation of cotton, land would be used by sharecroppers in return for a share of the crop to the landowner. Modern machines such as the cotton picker have made the manual cultivation obsolete over time as they took over the work from the hand laborers. On October 11, 2008, the Tennessee Parks and Greenways Foundation, a non-profit organization, dedicated Randolph Bluff Historic Park in a celebration with politicians, conservationists, historians and community members. The property on the second Chickasaw Bluff was purchased for $378,000. The park is intended to promote the Civil War history of the community and make the unique views of the Mississippi River available to a wider public, additional revenue from tourism is expected for the community. Once Randolph Bluff Historic Park is finished, it will be part of the Mississippi River Corridor Tennessee, a project to \\"create a scenic byway that connects historic sites along the Mississippi River\\", the project also promotes economical development and the preservation of land and wildlife in the Tennessee counties bordering the Mississippi River. In 2008, Randolph has a population of ca. 200, and consists of about two dozen dwellings. The economy of the rural community is dominated by agriculture with no major industries and businesses present.

A publication dated 1868 mentions Fort Wright and claims that it was formerly named Fort Pillow and was located on the first Chickasaw Bluff, the author treats Fort Randolph as a separate fortification on the second Chickasaw Bluff. The known location of Fort Pillow and the location of Randolph are about apart. A recent publication dated 2009 suggests that only one fortification existed at Randolph which was first named Fort Randolph and later became known as Fort Wright. Different sources give different locations for both fortifications. The Tipton County Property Assessor's Interactive Mapping System provides the location for the parcel ID 084055 02500, named \\"Fort Wright Historical\\". This is also the location of the powder magazine that is still intact as of 2008. For Fort Randolph, other sources give the location , the exact locations provided for Fort Randolph differ from each other due to rounding after the fifth decimal place of the coordinates. The two locations provided for Fort Wright and Fort Randolph are about apart. The Tennessee Encyclopedia of History and Culture dates the beginning of construction work at Fort Wright to late April 1861 and states that over \\"the next four months\\" the location was fortified with \\"artillery batteries and earthen field defenses\\". According to Konstam et al. (American Civil War fortifications), the Louisville Weekly Journal reported on June 11, 1861 about Fort Wright that at Randolph there were \\"50 cannon\\" present and that \\"thirty-two of them are monuted\\". The same source provides a citation from the Memphis Bulletin published after a visit at the fortification on June 22, 1861. By that time, the \\"earthen breastworks have been sodded with grass\\" and were reported \\"twenty to thirty feet in thickness\\" (6‚Äì10 m). Only one \\"narrow defile on the landward side\\" was reported by the Bulletin which was \\"defended by heavy guns\\" and \\"crossed by an earthen wall thirty to forty feet in thickness\\" (10‚Äì12 m). A \\"crescent shaped wall\\" to the east of the fortification provided a defense from land attacks. The contemporary reports indicates a good degree of completion of the fort by late June 1861. Fort Randolph, according to a dispatch published by the New York Times in March 1862, was constructed in Fall 1861 and it describes the state of the fortification by that time as a \\"rough and incomplete earthwork\\". A final determination can not be made in this context whether Fort Wright and Fort Randolph were identical or separate fortifications. It is clear that Fort Wright and Fort Pillow are not identical. Fort Pillow was located on the first Chickasaw Bluff and the coordinates provided for Fort Wright and Fort Randolph place both on the second Chickasaw Bluff about south of Fort Pillow. As for the differences in the locations provided for Fort Wright and Fort Randolph, and for the different stages of completion reported for both fortifications at a similar date, it is assumed for this article that Fort Randolph and Fort Wright were in close proximity to each other due to the geological features the second Chickasaw Bluff provided, but that they were two distinct places.

Early on, Chojecki participated in leftist intellectual and political movements and edited Polish poet Adam Mickiewicz's political weekly magazine La Tribune des Peuples (The Peoples' Tribune). In time he entered elite Parisian learned and literary circles, became secretary to Emperor Napoleon III, and co-founded the Paris daily Le Temps, predecessor to Le Monde. Chojecki wrote a notable Polish-language novel, Alkhadar (1854), and translated into Polish (1847) Jan Potocki's celebrated novel, The Saragossa Manuscript. Life Edmund Chojecki spent his youth in Warsaw, where his leftist political views crystallized. He was a friend of the poet Cyprian Norwid, wrote for the monthly PrzeglƒÖd Warszawski (The Warsaw Review), Echo (The Echo) and the monthly Biblioteka Warszawska (The Warsaw Library, 1840‚Äì42), and was secretary of the Board of Directors of the Warsaw Theaters (Dyrekcja Warszawskich Teatr√≥w). In 1844 Chojecki moved to France and after 1845 became active in European leftist movements. In 1846 he wrote Czechja i Czechowie (Czechia and the Czechs), a book about the history of the Czech lands.Czechja i Czechowie ‚Äì full original text. In 1848 he took part in a Slavic congress in Prague and was expelled for radicalism. In 1849 he became editor of La Tribune des Peuples (The Peoples' Tribune), a Polish-led French- language radical romantic-nationalist political weekly magazine that had been founded by the Polish poet Adam Mickiewicz. In this capacity, Chojecki came into contact with many prominent Russian and German √©migr√©s. His La Tribune des Peuples was published in Paris between March and November 1849, with a hiatus (14 April ‚Äì 31 August 1849) caused by censorship. Chojecki also wrote for the progressive Revue Ind√©pendante (Independent Review), co-edited by George Sand, and for the socialist newspaper La Voix du Peuple (The Voice of the People). For his pains, he was expelled from France. He visited Egypt, Turkey (where he enlisted in the army during the Crimean War) and Iceland (where he went as secretary to Prince Louis Napoleon). Until the 1850s, e.g. in Rewolucjoni≈õci i stronnictwo wsteczne w r. 1848 (The Revolutionaries and the Reactionaries in 1848, published in 1849), Chojecki had promoted revolutionary-democratic and utopian-socialist ideas. In time, he entered elite Parisian learned and literary circles. In 1856 he became secretary to Louis Napoleon, who in 1852 had become Emperor Napoleon III of France. In 1861 Chojecki co-founded the Paris daily, Le Temps, predecessor to France's most popular modern newspaper, Le Monde. He became director of the Senate Library. In later years, as a French citizen, he wrote novels and plays under the pen name \\"Charles Edmond\\"Jan Zygmunt Jakubowski, ed., Literatura polska od ≈õredniowiecza do pozytywizmu (Polish Literature from the Middle Ages to Positivism), p. 499. and enjoyed the friendship of the Goncourt brothers and Gustave Flaubert. Chojecki is remembered in the history of Polish literature as the author of a fine realistic novel, Alkhadar (1854), about the vicissitudes of a romantic conspirator against the backdrop of Polish Galicia's landed gentry, which was being brought to ruin by capitalism. Chojecki also translated into Polish many French-language works, including (in 1847) the novel The Saragossa Manuscript by the Polish polymath aristocrat Jan Potocki. After sections of Potocki's novel had been lost (other fragments having been published as separate parts in 1804 and 1813‚Äì14), the missing sections were restored by back-translation into French from Chojecki's Polish translation.Czes≈Çaw Mi≈Çosz, The History of Polish Literature, pp. 193‚Äì94.

Gallant is managing director of General Arts Touring, Inc., a classical and contemporary musicians agency. Biography Early life and education Gallant studied at the Jacobs School of Music at Indiana University, United States, with Jerry Sirucek. Career Considered by many to be the most difficult of all the musical instruments, the oboe is often called the \\"ill wind that no one blows good.\\" Oboist Thomas Gallant is one of the world's few virtuoso solo and chamber music performers on this instrument and he has been praised by The New Yorker magazine as \\"a player who unites technical mastery with intentness, charm and wit.\\" Thomas Gallant is a First Prize Winner of the Concert Artists Guild International New York Competition. His performances have taken him to Avery Fisher Hall, Weill Recital Hall and the Frick Collection in New York City, to Washington, DC, Los Angeles, Chicago, Philadelphia, to the Spoleto Festival in Italy, and to the Mostly Mozart Festival at Lincoln Center.

He is a member of the trio Ensemble Schumann. Thomas Gallant was born into a large working-class family to a Portuguese mother and French father outside of Boston. When he first brought home an oboe from the local band program his family was rather disappointed as they did not know what an oboe was and asked him to \\"go back to school and return it for an instrument like all the other kids play such as the trumpet or clarinet\\". After initial successes at a young age he stopped performing for many years and only in recent years has he returned to performing \\"the ill wind that no one blows good\\".

Its mission is to help support the survival of Jewish life and culture in the face of unprecedented global threat to the Jewish people, especially in Israel; strengthen Jewish identity and sustain Jewish heritage in the United States in the face of assimilation; celebrate current Jewish achievement in all aspects of human endeavor; and work for the reform of Jewish institutions.  Jewish Heritage Initiative in Poland  In 2004, the Taube Foundation for Jewish Life & Culture founded the Jewish Heritage Initiative in Poland (JHIP). The Initiative aims to nurture the revival of Jewish life in Poland, further awareness of this resurgence among Jews and non-Jews and foster positive interest in Poland and Polish Jews among American Jews. This mission reinforces the Taube Philanthropies‚Äô broader purpose of sustaining Jewish culture in the aftermath of the Holocaust. The JHIP is a partnership program, made up of founding sponsors and new partners from the United States and Europe. Jewish life in Poland received an almost mortal blow during the Holocaust committed by Germans in occupied Poland. Decades of Communism followed World War II, see History of Poland (1945‚Äì1989). As a result, Jewish schools closed, public programs on Jewish culture were forbidden and only a handful of historians were permitted to study the archives of Polish Jewish history. The fall of Communism in 1989 changed all of this dramatically. Many Poles have learned about their Jewish heritage for the first time and Jewish culture has flourished. The JHIP is supporting institutions and individuals ‚Äì‚Äì in Poland as well as in the United States ‚Äì‚Äì who are helping preserve Jewish heritage or are enriching the cultural and intellectual landscape today. A list of grantees appears on the Taube Foundation for Jewish Life & Culture's website. To further the goals of the JHIP, the Taube Foundation for Jewish Life & Culture has established a base of operations in Warsaw at the Taube Center for the Renewal of Jewish Culture.Jewish Historical Institute The Taube Foundation for Jewish Life & Culture is the only American Jewish foundation with an office and ongoing presence in Poland. The Polish Jewish Heritage Program Director is Shana Penn, author and visiting scholar at the Graduate Theological Union's Center for Jewish Studies in Berkeley, California.  Founder  Tad Taube is the chairman and founder of the Taube Foundation for Jewish Life & Culture. He also serves as president of the Koret Foundation. He is chairman and founder of the Woodmont Companies, a diversified real estate investment and management organization. He has served as trustee of the University of Notre Dame de Namur, the University of San Francisco, and as governor of Hebrew University in Jerusalem. At his alma mater, Stanford University, Taube is founder and advisory board chair of the Taube Center for Jewish Studies, which was established in 1986. He is a member of the Board of Overseers of the Hoover Institution and serves on its Executive Committee, and was founder and past chairman of the advisory board of the Stanford Institute for Economic Policy Research (SIEPR).

It was built in 1906 or 1910 and added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. and As with other nearby mansions such as Lincliff, Boxhill reflects a period of Louisville history around the turn of the 20th century where wealthy Louisvillians built showcase homes along the Ohio River above Downtown Louisville. The 29 remaining mansions constitute the largest such collection along the 981-mile long river, and are among the best-preserved collections of turn-of-the-century estates in the United States.  History  William E. Chess, president of the Chess and Wymond Cooperage Company, built Boxhill on a tract on the Ohio River that he bought in 1906. The house, located on a bluff above the river, was completed by 1910. The Georgian revival house is reputed to have been designed by Boston architect Joseph E. Chandler. The landscaping, including elaborate gardens and a long tree-lined mall leading from the road to the house, is thought to have been planned by Bryant Fleming, a landscape architect from Buffalo, New York. Chess' daughter, Mary Grace Chess Robinson, took over the property in 1917. She and her husband, Avery Robinson, vice- president of a cordage mill, lived on the estate until 1923, when they sold it to Henning Chambers, a brokerage firm executive. Portions of the original estate were sold off during the 1950s. In 1956 sidelights and a cast-iron balcony were added to the house's entry and a second story was added to a wing. In the early 1970s Robert and Shirley Alexander from Chicago bought the property. In 1977 they were murdered in Boxhill by their stepson. He was diagnosed a schizophrenic and found incompetent to stand trial for the murder. As the mansion had been the site of a grisly double homicide, the bank which came to own it found no buyers despite offering it for sale for over three years. In 1980, Helen Combs, a veteran contractor who had restored dozens of older mansions in Louisville, purchased it for $355,000. She described the restoration process as unique, even for her, saying \\"The windows were out, plastic was over them, there was no furniture.... We got to this one room and opened the door, and saw big red cabbage roses on the walls, red carpet, red bedspreads and red lamps that glowed.\\" Combs intended to live in the house but her husband, former Kentucky governor Bert T. Combs, balked at the idea, referring to it as the \\"murder house\\". She sold the house in 1982.

The economic zone would \\"promote the better use of resources of the economic belt in East China and enhance its overall economic strength,\\" Wang Xiaojing, the then executive vice-governor of Fujian in 2005.http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/english/doc/2005-03/07/content_422399.htm In 2008, Mainland China through its Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits and Taiwan via Straits Exchange Foundation agreed on an Economic Pact which opened direct transport links for the first time since the end of the Chinese civil war. This allowed regular commercial flights, direct shipping between Taiwan and Chinese mainland ports and postal services. Economy The proposed economic zone will accelerate economic development along the coastal cities in Fujian province. Fujian's economy is China's 11th largest provincial economy with a gross domestic product (GDP) of 523.217 billion yuan (US$63.27 billion) in 2003http://www.gwytb.gov.cn:8088/detail.asp?table=Trade&title;=Cross- strait+Trade&offset;=50&m;_id=21 Fujian's current GDP is now 924.9 billion RMB as of 2007.http://info.hktdc.com/mktprof/china/mpfuj.htm The main economic engine in Fujian are Xiamen, Fuzhou, Quanzhou, Zhangzhou and Putian. The proposed economic zone will focus on electronic information, machinery building, petro-chemistry, construction material and clothes. Taiwan's current GDP in 2007 was 388.1 billion US dollars.http://info.hktdc.com/mktprof/asia/mptai.htm In 2008, with the opening of direct transport links between Taiwan and Mainland China. It is expected this would increase economic activity in the economic zone as well as for Taiwan. This will mean reduced cost for aviation, shipping, postal services. It will accelerate trade, social and economic development in the Taiwan Straits region. Fujian already has around 5,249 Taiwanese projects in 2008. This is expected to increase as cross-straits bilateral ties improves. This will increase exports such as mechanical & electrical products, automatic data processing equipment, clothing and accessories and footwear etc. Fujian's major export destination includes Hong Kong, United States and Japan. As economic trade with Taiwan increases with direct transport links, Taiwan will become a major export destination.

His chronophotographic works can be regarded as movies recorded before there was a proper way to replay the material in motion. Film, also called movie, motion picture or moving picture, is a visual art-form used to simulate experiences that communicate ideas, stories, perceptions, feelings, beauty, or atmosphere through the use of moving images. These images are generally accompanied by sound, and more rarely, other sensory stimulations. The word \\"cinema\\", short for cinematography, is often used to refer to filmmaking and the film industry, and to the art form that is the result of it. The moving images of a film are created by photographing actual scenes with a motion- picture camera, by photographing drawings or miniature models using traditional animation techniques, by means of CGI and computer animation, or by a combination of some or all of these techniques, and other visual effects. Traditionally, films were recorded onto celluloid film stock through a photochemical process and then shown through a movie projector onto a large screen. Contemporary films are often fully digital through the entire process of production, distribution, and exhibition, while films recorded in a photochemical form traditionally included an analogous optical soundtrack (a graphic recording of the spoken words, music and other sounds that accompany the images which runs along a portion of the film exclusively reserved for it, and is not projected). Films are cultural artifacts created by specific cultures. They reflect those cultures, and, in turn, affect them. Film is considered to be an important art form, a source of popular entertainment, and a powerful medium for educating‚Äîor indoctrinating‚Äîcitizens. The visual basis of film gives it a universal power of communication. Some films have become popular worldwide attractions through the use of dubbing or subtitles to translate the dialog into other languages. The individual images that make up a film are called frames. In the projection of traditional celluloid films, a rotating shutter causes intervals of darkness as each frame, in turn, is moved into position to be projected, but the viewer does not notice the interruptions because of an effect known as persistence of vision, whereby the eye retains a visual image for a fraction of a second after its source disappears. The perception of motion is partly due to a psychological effect called the phi phenomenon. The name \\"film\\" originates from the fact that photographic film (also called film stock) has historically been the medium for recording and displaying motion pictures. Many other terms exist for an individual motion-picture, including picture, picture show, moving picture, photoplay, and flick. The most common term in the United States is movie, while in Europe film is preferred. Common terms for the field in general include the big screen, the silver screen, the movies, and cinema; the last of these is commonly used, as an overarching term, in scholarly texts and critical essays. In early years, the word sheet was sometimes used instead of screen.  History  A frame from Roundhay Garden Scene, the world's earliest surviving film produced using a motion picture camera, by Louis Le Prince, 1888. The Berlin Wintergarten theatre was the site of the first cinema ever, with a short film presented by the Skladanowsky brothers on 1 November 1895. (Pictured here is a variety show at the theater in July 1940.) Precursors The art of film has drawn on several earlier traditions in fields such as oral storytelling, literature, theatre and visual arts. Forms of art and entertainment that had already featured moving and/or projected images include: * shadowgraphy, probably used since prehistoric times * camera obscura, a natural phenomenon that has possibly been used as an artistic aid since prehistoric times * shadow puppetry, possibly originated around 200 BCE in Central Asia, India, Indonesia or China * magic lantern, developed in the 1650s, also used in the multi-media phantasmagoria shows that were popular from 1790 throughout the first half of the 19th century and could feature mechanical slides, rear projection, mobile projectors, superimposition, dissolving views, live actors, smoke (sometimes to project images upon), odors, sounds and even electric shocks. Before celluloid The stroboscopic animation principle was introduced in 1833 with the ph√©nakisticope and also applied in the zoetrope since 1866, the flip book since 1868, and the praxinoscope since 1877, before it became the basic principle for cinematography. Experiments with early phenakisticope-based animation projectors were made at least as early as 1843. Jules Duboscq marketed ph√©nakisticope projection systems in France between 1853 and the 1890s. Photography was introduced in 1839, but at first photographic emulsions needed such long exposures that the recording of moving subjects seemed impossible. At least as early as 1844, photographic series of subjects posed in different positions have been created to either suggest a motion sequence or to document a range of different viewing angles. The advent of stereoscopic photography, with early experiments in the 1840s and commercial success since the early 1850s, raised interest in completing the photographic medium with the addition of means to capture colour and motion. In 1849, Joseph Plateau published about the idea to combine his invention of the ph√©nakisticope with the stereoscope, as suggested to him by stereoscope inventor Charles Wheatstone, and use photographs of plaster sculptures in different positions to be animated in the combined device. In 1852, Jules Duboscq patented such an instrument as the \\"St√©r√©oscope-fantascope, ou B√Øoscope\\". He marginally advertised it for a short period. It was a commercial failure and no complete instrument has yet been located, but one bioscope disc has been preserved in the Plateau collection of the Ghent University. It has stereoscopic photographs of a machine. By the late 1850s the first examples of instantaneous photography came about and provided hope that motion photography would soon be possible, but it took a few decades before it was successfully combined with a method to record series of sequential images in real-time. In 1878, Eadweard Muybridge eventually managed to take a series of photographs of a running horse with a battery of cameras in a line along the track and published the results as The Horse in Motion on cabinet cards. Muybridge, as well as √âtienne-Jules Marey, Ottomar Ansch√ºtz and many others would create many more chronophotography studies. Muybridge had the contours of dozens of his chronophotographic series traced onto glass discs and projected them with his zoopraxiscope in his lectures from 1880 to 1895. Ansch√ºtz developed his own Electrotachyscope in 1887 to project 24 diapositive photographic images on glass disks as moving images, looped as long as deemed interesting for the audience. √âmile Reynaud already mentioned the possibility of projecting the images in his 1877 patent application for the praxinoscope. He presented a praxinoscope projection device at the Soci√©t√© fran√ßaise de photographie on 4 June 1880, but did not market his praxinoscope a projection before 1882. He then further developed the device into the Th√©√¢tre Optique which could project longer sequences with separate backgrounds, patented in 1888. He created several movies for the machine by painting images on hundreds of gelatin plates that were mounted into cardboard frames and attached to a cloth band. From 28 October 1892 to March 1900 Reynaud gave over 12,800 shows to a total of over 500,000 visitors at the Mus√©e Gr√©vin in Paris. A famous shot from Georges M√©li√®s Le Voyage dans la Lune (A Trip to the Moon) (1902), an early narrative film and also an early science fiction film. First motion pictures By the end of the 1880s, the introduction of lengths of celluloid photographic film and the invention of motion picture cameras, which could photograph an indefinitely long rapid sequence of images using only one lens, allowed several minutes of action to be captured and stored on a single compact reel of film. Some early films were made to be viewed by one person at a time through a \\"peep show\\" device such as the Kinetoscope and the mutoscope. Others were intended for a projector, mechanically similar to the camera and sometimes actually the same machine, which was used to shine an intense light through the processed and printed film and into a projection lens so that these \\"moving pictures\\" could be shown tremendously enlarged on a screen for viewing by an entire audience. The first kinetoscope film shown in public exhibition was Blacksmith Scene, produced by Edison Manufacturing Company in 1893. The following year the company would begin Edison Studios, which became an early leader in the film industry with notable early shorts including The Kiss, and would go on to produce close to 1,200 films. The first public screenings of films at which admission was charged were made in 1895 by the American Woodville Latham and his sons, using films produced by their Eidoloscope company, and by the ‚Äì arguably better known ‚Äì French brothers Auguste and Louis Lumi√®re with ten of their own productions. Private screenings had preceded these by several months, with Latham's slightly predating the Lumi√®re brothers'. Early evolution The earliest films were simply one static shot that showed an event or action with no editing or other cinematic techniques. Around the turn of the 20th century, films started stringing several scenes together to tell a story. The scenes were later broken up into multiple shots photographed from different distances and angles. Other techniques such as camera movement were developed as effective ways to tell a story with film. Until sound film became commercially practical in the late 1920s, motion pictures were a purely visual art, but these innovative silent films had gained a hold on the public imagination. Rather than leave audiences with only the noise of the projector as an accompaniment, theater owners hired a pianist or organist or, in large urban theaters, a full orchestra to play music that fit the mood of the film at any given moment. By the early 1920s, most films came with a prepared list of sheet music to be used for this purpose, and complete film scores were composed for major productions. A clip from the Charlie Chaplin silent film The Bond (1918) The rise of European cinema was interrupted by the outbreak of World War I, while the film industry in the United States flourished with the rise of Hollywood, typified most prominently by the innovative work of D. W. Griffith in The Birth of a Nation (1915) and Intolerance (1916). However, in the 1920s, European filmmakers such as Eisenstein, F. W. Murnau and Fritz Lang, in many ways inspired by the meteoric wartime progress of film through Griffith, along with the contributions of Charles Chaplin, Buster Keaton and others, quickly caught up with American film-making and continued to further advance the medium. Sound In the 1920s, the development of electronic sound recording technologies made it practical to incorporate a soundtrack of speech, music and sound effects synchronized with the action on the screen. The resulting sound films were initially distinguished from the usual silent \\"moving pictures\\" or \\"movies\\" by calling them \\"talking pictures\\" or \\"talkies.\\" The revolution they wrought was swift. By 1930, silent film was practically extinct in the US and already being referred to as \\"the old medium.\\" Color Another major technological development was the introduction of \\"natural color,\\" which meant color that was photographically recorded from nature rather than added to black-and-white prints by hand-coloring, stencil- coloring or other arbitrary procedures, although the earliest processes typically yielded colors which were far from \\"natural\\" in appearance. While the advent of sound films quickly made silent films and theater musicians obsolete, color replaced black-and-white much more gradually. The pivotal innovation was the introduction of the three-strip version of the Technicolor process, first used for animated cartoons in 1932, then also for live-action short films and isolated sequences in a few feature films, then for an entire feature film, Becky Sharp, in 1935. The expense of the process was daunting, but favorable public response in the form of increased box office receipts usually justified the added cost. The number of films made in color slowly increased year after year. 1950s: growing influence of television  In the early 1950s, the proliferation of black-and-white television started seriously depressing North American theater attendance. In an attempt to lure audiences back into theaters, bigger screens were installed, widescreen processes, polarized 3D projection, and stereophonic sound were introduced, and more films were made in color, which soon became the rule rather than the exception. Some important mainstream Hollywood films were still being made in black-and-white as late as the mid-1960s, but they marked the end of an era. Color television receivers had been available in the US since the mid-1950s, but at first, they were very expensive and few broadcasts were in color. During the 1960s, prices gradually came down, color broadcasts became common, and sales boomed. The overwhelming public verdict in favor of color was clear. After the final flurry of black-and-white films had been released in mid- decade, all Hollywood studio productions were filmed in color, with the usual exceptions made only at the insistence of \\"star\\" filmmakers such as Peter Bogdanovich and Martin Scorsese. 1960s and later The decades following the decline of the studio system in the 1960s saw changes in the production and style of film. Various New Wave movements (including the French New Wave, Indian New Wave, Japanese New Wave, and New Hollywood) and the rise of film- school-educated independent filmmakers contributed to the changes the medium experienced in the latter half of the 20th century. Digital technology has been the driving force for change throughout the 1990s and into the 2000s. Digital 3D projection largely replaced earlier problem-prone 3D film systems and has become popular in the early 2010s. Film theory 16 mm spring-wound Bolex \\"H16\\" Reflex camera is a popular entry level camera used in film schools. \\"Film theory\\" seeks to develop concise and systematic concepts that apply to the study of film as art. The concept of film as an art-form began in 1911 with Ricciotto Canudo's The Birth of the Sixth Art. Formalist film theory, led by Rudolf Arnheim, B√©la Bal√°zs, and Siegfried Kracauer, emphasized how film differed from reality and thus could be considered a valid fine art. Andr√© Bazin reacted against this theory by arguing that film's artistic essence lay in its ability to mechanically reproduce reality, not in its differences from reality, and this gave rise to realist theory. More recent analysis spurred by Jacques Lacan's psychoanalysis and Ferdinand de Saussure's semiotics among other things has given rise to psychoanalytic film theory, structuralist film theory, feminist film theory, and others. On the other hand, critics from the analytical philosophy tradition, influenced by Wittgenstein, try to clarify misconceptions used in theoretical studies and produce analysis of a film's vocabulary and its link to a form of life. Language Film is considered to have its own language. James Monaco wrote a classic text on film theory, titled \\"How to Read a Film,\\" that addresses this. Director Ingmar Bergman famously said, \\"Andrei Tarkovsky for me is the greatest director, the one who invented a new language, true to the nature of film, as it captures life as a reflection, life as a dream.\\" An example of the language is a sequence of back and forth images of one speaking actor's left profile, followed by another speaking actor's right profile, then a repetition of this, which is a language understood by the audience to indicate a conversation. This describes another theory of film, the 180-degree rule, as a visual story-telling device with an ability to place a viewer in a context of being psychologically present through the use of visual composition and editing. The \\"Hollywood style\\" includes this narrative theory, due to the overwhelming practice of the rule by movie studios based in Hollywood, California, during film's classical era. Another example of cinematic language is having a shot that zooms in on the forehead of an actor with an expression of silent reflection that cuts to a shot of a younger actor who vaguely resembles the first actor, indicating that the first person is remembering a past self, an edit of compositions that causes a time transition. Montage Montage is the technique by which separate pieces of film are selected, edited, and then pieced together to make a new section of film. A scene could show a man going into battle, with flashbacks to his youth and to his home-life and with added special effects, placed into the film after filming is complete. As these were all filmed separately, and perhaps with different actors, the final version is called a montage. Directors developed a theory of montage, beginning with Eisenstein and the complex juxtaposition of images in his film Battleship Potemkin. Incorporation of musical and visual counterpoint, and scene development through mise en scene, editing, and effects has led to more complex techniques comparable to those used in opera and ballet. Film criticism Film criticism is the analysis and evaluation of films. In general, these works can be divided into two categories: academic criticism by film scholars and journalistic film criticism that appears regularly in newspapers and other media. Film critics working for newspapers, magazines, and broadcast media mainly review new releases. Normally they only see any given film once and have only a day or two to formulate their opinions. Despite this, critics have an important impact on the audience response and attendance at films, especially those of certain genres. Mass marketed action, horror, and comedy films tend not to be greatly affected by a critic's overall judgment of a film. The plot summary and description of a film and the assessment of the director's and screenwriters' work that makes up the majority of most film reviews can still have an important impact on whether people decide to see a film. For prestige films such as most dramas and art films, the influence of reviews is important. Poor reviews from leading critics at major papers and magazines will often reduce audience interest and attendance. The impact of a reviewer on a given film's box office performance is a matter of debate. Some observers claim that movie marketing in the 2000s is so intense, well-coordinated and well financed that reviewers cannot prevent a poorly written or filmed blockbuster from attaining market success. However, the cataclysmic failure of some heavily promoted films which were harshly reviewed, as well as the unexpected success of critically praised independent films indicates that extreme critical reactions can have considerable influence. Other observers note that positive film reviews have been shown to spark interest in little-known films. Conversely, there have been several films in which film companies have so little confidence that they refuse to give reviewers an advanced viewing to avoid widespread panning of the film. However, this usually backfires, as reviewers are wise to the tactic and warn the public that the film may not be worth seeing and the films often do poorly as a result. Journalist film critics are sometimes called film reviewers. Critics who take a more academic approach to films, through publishing in film journals and writing books about films using film theory or film studies approaches, study how film and filming techniques work, and what effect they have on people. Rather than having their reviews published in newspapers or appearing on television, their articles are published in scholarly journals or up-market magazines. They also tend to be affiliated with colleges or universities as professors or instructors. Industry Founded in 1912, the Babelsberg Studio near Berlin was the first large-scale film studio in the world, and the forerunner to Hollywood. It still produces global blockbusters every year. The making and showing of motion pictures became a source of profit almost as soon as the process was invented. Upon seeing how successful their new invention, and its product, was in their native France, the Lumi√®res quickly set about touring the Continent to exhibit the first films privately to royalty and publicly to the masses. In each country, they would normally add new, local scenes to their catalogue and, quickly enough, found local entrepreneurs in the various countries of Europe to buy their equipment and photograph, export, import, and screen additional product commercially. The Oberammergau Passion Play of 1898 was the first commercial motion picture ever produced. Other pictures soon followed, and motion pictures became a separate industry that overshadowed the vaudeville world. Dedicated theaters and companies formed specifically to produce and distribute films, while motion picture actors became major celebrities and commanded huge fees for their performances. By 1917 Charlie Chaplin had a contract that called for an annual salary of one million dollars. From 1931 to 1956, film was also the only image storage and playback system for television programming until the introduction of videotape recorders. In the United States, much of the film industry is centered around Hollywood, California. Other regional centers exist in many parts of the world, such as Mumbai- centered Bollywood, the Indian film industry's Hindi cinema which produces the largest number of films in the world.Bollywood Hots Up cnn.com. Retrieved June 23, 2007. Though the expense involved in making films has led cinema production to concentrate under the auspices of movie studios, recent advances in affordable film making equipment have allowed independent film productions to flourish. Profit is a key force in the industry, due to the costly and risky nature of filmmaking; many films have large cost overruns, an example being Kevin Costner's Waterworld. Yet many filmmakers strive to create works of lasting social significance. The Academy Awards (also known as \\"the Oscars\\") are the most prominent film awards in the United States, providing recognition each year to films, based on their artistic merits. There is also a large industry for educational and instructional films made in lieu of or in addition to lectures and texts. Revenue in the industry is sometimes volatile due to the reliance on blockbuster films released in movie theaters. The rise of alternative home entertainment has raised questions about the future of the cinema industry, and Hollywood employment has become less reliable, particularly for medium and low-budget films. Associated fields Derivative academic fields of study may both interact with and develop independently of filmmaking, as in film theory and analysis. Fields of academic study have been created that are derivative or dependent on the existence of film, such as film criticism, film history, divisions of film propaganda in authoritarian governments, or psychological on subliminal effects (e.g., of a flashing soda can during a screening). These fields may further create derivative fields, such as a movie review section in a newspaper or a television guide. Sub- industries can spin off from film, such as popcorn makers, and film-related toys (e.g., Star Wars figures). Sub-industries of pre-existing industries may deal specifically with film, such as product placement and other advertising within films. Terminology The terminology used for describing motion pictures varies considerably between British and American English. In British usage, the name of the medium is \\"film\\". The word \\"movie\\" is understood but seldom used. Additionally, \\"the pictures\\" (plural) is used semi-frequently to refer to the place where movies are exhibited, while in American English this may be called \\"the movies\\", but it is becoming outdated. In other countries, the place where movies are exhibited may be called a cinema or movie theatre. By contrast, in the United States, \\"movie\\" is the predominant form. Although the words \\"film\\" and \\"movie\\" are sometimes used interchangeably, \\"film\\" is more often used when considering artistic, theoretical, or technical aspects. The term \\"movies\\" more often refers to entertainment or commercial aspects, as where to go for fun evening on a date. For example, a book titled \\"How to Understand a Film\\" would probably be about the aesthetics or theory of film, while a book entitled \\"Let's Go to the Movies\\" would probably be about the history of entertaining movies and blockbusters. Further terminology is used to distinguish various forms and media used in the film industry. \\"Motion pictures\\" and \\"moving pictures\\" are frequently used terms for film and movie productions specifically intended for theatrical exhibition, such as, for instance, Batman. \\"DVD\\" and \\"videotape\\" are video formats that can reproduce a photochemical film. A reproduction based on such is called a \\"transfer.\\" After the advent of theatrical film as an industry, the television industry began using videotape as a recording medium. For many decades, tape was solely an analog medium onto which moving images could be either recorded or transferred. \\"Film\\" and \\"filming\\" refer to the photochemical medium that chemically records a visual image and the act of recording respectively. However, the act of shooting images with other visual media, such as with a digital camera, is still called \\"filming\\" and the resulting works often called \\"films\\" as interchangeable to \\"movies,\\" despite not being shot on film. \\"Silent films\\" need not be utterly silent, but are films and movies without an audible dialogue, including those that have a musical accompaniment. The word, \\"Talkies,\\" refers to the earliest sound films created to have audible dialogue recorded for playback along with the film, regardless of a musical accompaniment. \\"Cinema\\" either broadly encompasses both films and movies, or it is roughly synonymous with film and theatrical exhibition, and both are capitalized when referring to a category of art. The \\"silver screen\\" refers to the projection screen used to exhibit films and, by extension, is also used as a metonym for the entire film industry. \\"Widescreen\\" refers to a larger width to height in the frame, compared to earlier historic aspect ratios. A \\"feature-length film\\", or \\"feature film\\", is of a conventional full length, usually 60 minutes or more, and can commercially stand by itself without other films in a ticketed screening. A \\"short\\" is a film that is not as long as a feature-length film, often screened with other shorts, or preceding a feature- length film. An \\"independent\\" is a film made outside the conventional film industry. In US usage, one talks of a \\"screening\\" or \\"projection\\" of a movie or video on a screen at a public or private \\"theater.\\" In British English, a \\"film showing\\" happens at a cinema (never a \\"theatre\\", which is a different medium and place altogether). A cinema usually refers to an arena designed specifically to exhibit films, where the screen is affixed to a wall, while a theater usually refers to a place where live, non-recorded action or combination thereof occurs from a podium or other type of stage, including the amphitheater. Theaters can still screen movies in them, though the theater would be retrofitted to do so. One might propose \\"going to the cinema\\" when referring to the activity, or sometimes \\"to the pictures\\" in British English, whereas the US expression is usually \\"going to the movies.\\" A cinema usually shows a mass-marketed movie using a front-projection screen process with either a film projector or, more recently, with a digital projector. But, cinemas may also show theatrical movies from their home video transfers that include Blu-ray Disc, DVD, and videocassette when they possess sufficient projection quality or based upon need, such as movies that exist only in their transferred state, which may be due to the loss or deterioration of the film master and prints from which the movie originally existed. Due to the advent of digital film production and distribution, physical film might be absent entirely. A \\"double feature\\" is a screening of two independently marketed, stand-alone feature films. A \\"viewing\\" is a watching of a film. \\"Sales\\" and \\"at the box office\\" refer to tickets sold at a theater, or more currently, rights sold for individual showings. A \\"release\\" is the distribution and often simultaneous screening of a film. A \\"preview\\" is a screening in advance of the main release. Any film may also have a \\"sequel\\", which portrays events following those in the film. Bride of Frankenstein is an early example. When there are more films than one with the same characters, story arcs, or subject themes, these movies become a \\"series,\\" such as the James Bond series. And, existing outside a specific story timeline usually, does not exclude a film from being part of a series. A film that portrays events occurring earlier in a timeline with those in another film, but is released after that film, is sometimes called a \\"prequel,\\" an example being Butch and Sundance: The Early Days. The \\"credits,\\" or \\"end credits,\\" is a list that gives credit to the people involved in the production of a film. Films from before the 1970s usually start a film with credits, often ending with only a title card, saying \\"The End\\" or some equivalent, often an equivalent that depends on the language of the production. From then onward, a film's credits usually appear at the end of most films. However, films with credits that end a film often repeat some credits at or near the start of a film and therefore appear twice, such as that film's acting leads, while less frequently some appearing near or at the beginning only appear there, not at the end, which often happens to the director's credit. The credits appearing at or near the beginning of a film are usually called \\"titles\\" or \\"beginning titles.\\" A post-credits scene is a scene shown after the end of the credits. Ferris Bueller's Day Off has a post- credit scene in which Ferris tells the audience that the film is over and they should go home. A film's \\"cast\\" refers to a collection of the actors and actresses who appear, or \\"star,\\" in a film. A star is an actor or actress, often a popular one, and in many cases, a celebrity who plays a central character in a film. Occasionally the word can also be used to refer to the fame of other members of the crew, such as a director or other personality, such as Martin Scorsese. A \\"crew\\" is usually interpreted as the people involved in a film's physical construction outside cast participation, and it could include directors, film editors, photographers, grips, gaffers, set decorators, prop masters, and costume designers. A person can both be part of a film's cast and crew, such as Woody Allen, who directed and starred in Take the Money and Run. A \\"film goer,\\" \\"movie goer,\\" or \\"film buff\\" is a person who likes or often attends films and movies, and any of these, though more often the latter, could also see oneself as a student to films and movies or the filmic process. Intense interest in films, film theory, and film criticism, is known as cinephilia. A film enthusiast is known as a cinephile or cineaste. Preview A preview performance refers to a showing of a film to a select audience, usually for the purposes of corporate promotions, before the public film premiere itself. Previews are sometimes used to judge audience reaction, which if unexpectedly negative, may result in recutting or even refilming certain sections based on the audience response. One example of a film that was changed after a negative response from the test screening is 1982's First Blood. After the test audience responded very negatively to the death of protagonist John Rambo, a Vietnam veteran, at the end of the film, the company wrote and re-shot a new ending in which the character survives. Trailer and teaser Trailers or previews are advertisements for films that will be shown in 1 to 3 months at a cinema. Back in the early days of cinema, with theaters that had only one or two screens, only certain trailers were shown for the films that were going to be shown there. Later, when theaters added more screens or new theaters were built with a lot of screens, all different trailers were shown even if they weren't going to play that film in that theater. Film studios realized that the more trailers that were shown (even if it wasn't going to be shown in that particular theater) the more patrons would go to a different theater to see the film when it came out. The term \\"trailer\\" comes from their having originally been shown at the end of a film program. That practice did not last long because patrons tended to leave the theater after the films ended, but the name has stuck. Trailers are now shown before the film (or the \\"A film\\" in a double feature program) begins. Film trailers are also common on DVDs and Blu-ray Discs, as well as on the Internet and mobile devices. Trailers are created to be engaging and interesting for viewers. As a result, in the Internet era, viewers often seek out trailers to watch them. Of the ten billion videos watched online annually in 2008, film trailers ranked third, after news and user-created videos. Teasers are a much shorter preview or advertisement that lasts only 10 to 30 seconds. Teasers are used to get patrons excited about a film coming out in the next six to twelve months. Teasers may be produced even before the film production is completed. Education and propaganda Film is used for a range of goals, including education and propaganda. When the purpose is primarily educational, a film is called an \\"educational film\\". Examples are recordings of academic lectures and experiments, or a film based on a classic novel. Film may be propaganda, in whole or in part, such as the films made by Leni Riefenstahl in Nazi Germany, US war film trailers during World War II, or artistic films made under Stalin by Sergei Eisenstein. They may also be works of political protest, as in the films of Andrzej Wajda, or more subtly, the films of Andrei Tarkovsky. The same film may be considered educational by some, and propaganda by others as the categorization of a film can be subjective.  Production  At its core, the means to produce a film depend on the content the filmmaker wishes to show, and the apparatus for displaying it: the zoetrope merely requires a series of images on a strip of paper. Film production can, therefore, take as little as one person with a camera (or even without a camera, as in Stan Brakhage's 1963 film Mothlight), or thousands of actors, extras, and crew members for a live-action, feature-length epic. The necessary steps for almost any film can be boiled down to conception, planning, execution, revision, and distribution. The more involved the production, the more significant each of the steps becomes. In a typical production cycle of a Hollywood-style film, these main stages are defined as development, pre-production, production, post-production and distribution. This production cycle usually takes three years. The first year is taken up with development. The second year comprises preproduction and production. The third year, post-production and distribution. The bigger the production, the more resources it takes, and the more important financing becomes; most feature films are artistic works from the creators' perspective (e.g., film director, cinematographer, screenwriter) and for-profit business entities for the production companies. Crew A film crew is a group of people hired by a film company, employed during the \\"production\\" or \\"photography\\" phase, for the purpose of producing a film or motion picture. Crew is distinguished from cast, who are the actors who appear in front of the camera or provide voices for characters in the film. The crew interacts with but is also distinct from the production staff, consisting of producers, managers, company representatives, their assistants, and those whose primary responsibility falls in pre-production or post-production phases, such as screenwriters and film editors. Communication between production and crew generally passes through the director and his/her staff of assistants. Medium-to-large crews are generally divided into departments with well-defined hierarchies and standards for interaction and cooperation between the departments. Other than acting, the crew handles everything in the photography phase: props and costumes, shooting, sound, electrics (i.e., lights), sets, and production special effects. Caterers (known in the film industry as \\"craft services\\") are usually not considered part of the crew. Technology Film stock consists of transparent celluloid, acetate, or polyester base coated with an emulsion containing light-sensitive chemicals. Cellulose nitrate was the first type of film base used to record motion pictures, but due to its flammability was eventually replaced by safer materials. Stock widths and the film format for images on the reel have had a rich history, though most large commercial films are still shot on (and distributed to theaters) as 35 mm prints. Originally moving picture film was shot and projected at various speeds using hand-cranked cameras and projectors; though 1000 frames per minute (16 frame/s) is generally cited as a standard silent speed, research indicates most films were shot between 16 frame/s and 23 frame/s and projected from 18 frame/s on up (often reels included instructions on how fast each scene should be shown). When sound film was introduced in the late 1920s, a constant speed was required for the sound head. 24 frames per second were chosen because it was the slowest (and thus cheapest) speed which allowed for sufficient sound quality. Improvements since the late 19th century include the mechanization of cameras ‚Äì allowing them to record at a consistent speed, quiet camera design ‚Äì allowing sound recorded on-set to be usable without requiring large \\"blimps\\" to encase the camera, the invention of more sophisticated filmstocks and lenses, allowing directors to film in increasingly dim conditions, and the development of synchronized sound, allowing sound to be recorded at exactly the same speed as its corresponding action. The soundtrack can be recorded separately from shooting the film, but for live-action pictures, many parts of the soundtrack are usually recorded simultaneously. As a medium, film is not limited to motion pictures, since the technology developed as the basis for photography. It can be used to present a progressive sequence of still images in the form of a slideshow. Film has also been incorporated into multimedia presentations and often has importance as primary historical documentation. However, historic films have problems in terms of preservation and storage, and the motion picture industry is exploring many alternatives. Most films on cellulose nitrate base have been copied onto modern safety films. Some studios save color films through the use of separation masters: three B&W; negatives each exposed through red, green, or blue filters (essentially a reverse of the Technicolor process). Digital methods have also been used to restore films, although their continued obsolescence cycle makes them (as of 2006) a poor choice for long-term preservation. Film preservation of decaying film stock is a matter of concern to both film historians and archivists and to companies interested in preserving their existing products in order to make them available to future generations (and thereby increase revenue). Preservation is generally a higher concern for nitrate and single-strip color films, due to their high decay rates; black-and-white films on safety bases and color films preserved on Technicolor imbibition prints tend to keep up much better, assuming proper handling and storage. Some films in recent decades have been recorded using analog video technology similar to that used in television production. Modern digital video cameras and digital projectors are gaining ground as well. These approaches are preferred by some film-makers, especially because footage shot with digital cinema can be evaluated and edited with non- linear editing systems (NLE) without waiting for the film stock to be processed. The migration was gradual, and as of 2005, most major motion pictures were still shot on film. Independent The Lumi√®re Brothers, who were among the first filmmakers Independent filmmaking often takes place outside Hollywood, or other major studio systems. An independent film (or indie film) is a film initially produced without financing or distribution from a major film studio. Creative, business and technological reasons have all contributed to the growth of the indie film scene in the late 20th and early 21st century. On the business side, the costs of big-budget studio films also lead to conservative choices in cast and crew. There is a trend in Hollywood towards co-financing (over two-thirds of the films put out by Warner Bros. in 2000 were joint ventures, up from 10% in 1987). A hopeful director is almost never given the opportunity to get a job on a big-budget studio film unless he or she has significant industry experience in film or television. Also, the studios rarely produce films with unknown actors, particularly in lead roles. Before the advent of digital alternatives, the cost of professional film equipment and stock was also a hurdle to being able to produce, direct, or star in a traditional studio film. But the advent of consumer camcorders in 1985, and more importantly, the arrival of high- resolution digital video in the early 1990s, have lowered the technology barrier to film production significantly. Both production and post-production costs have been significantly lowered; in the 2000s, the hardware and software for post-production can be installed in a commodity-based personal computer. Technologies such as DVDs, FireWire connections and a wide variety of professional and consumer-grade video editing software make film-making relatively affordable. Since the introduction of digital video DV technology, the means of production have become more democratized. Filmmakers can conceivably shoot a film with a digital video camera and edit the film, create and edit the sound and music, and mix the final cut on a high-end home computer. However, while the means of production may be democratized, financing, distribution, and marketing remain difficult to accomplish outside the traditional system. Most independent filmmakers rely on film festivals to get their films noticed and sold for distribution. The arrival of internet- based video websites such as YouTube and Veoh has further changed the filmmaking landscape, enabling indie filmmakers to make their films available to the public. Open content film An open content film is much like an independent film, but it is produced through open collaborations; its source material is available under a license which is permissive enough to allow other parties to create fan fiction or derivative works, than a traditional copyright. Like independent filmmaking, open source filmmaking takes place outside Hollywood, or other major studio systems. Fan film A fan film is a film or video inspired by a film, television program, comic book or a similar source, created by fans rather than by the source's copyright holders or creators. Fan filmmakers have traditionally been amateurs, but some of the most notable films have actually been produced by professional filmmakers as film school class projects or as demonstration reels. Fan films vary tremendously in length, from short faux-teaser trailers for non-existent motion pictures to rarer full-length motion pictures. Distribution Film distribution is the process through which a film is made available for viewing by an audience. This is normally the task of a professional film distributor, who would determine the marketing strategy of the film, the media by which a film is to be exhibited or made available for viewing, and may set the release date and other matters. The film may be exhibited directly to the public either through a movie theater (historically the main way films were distributed) or television for personal home viewing (including on DVD-Video or Blu-ray Disc, video-on-demand, online downloading, television programs through broadcast syndication etc.). Other ways of distributing a film include rental or personal purchase of the film in a variety of media and formats, such as VHS tape or DVD, or Internet downloading or streaming using a computer. Animation An animated image of a horse, made using eight pictures. Animation is a technique in which each frame of a film is produced individually, whether generated as a computer graphic, or by photographing a drawn image, or by repeatedly making small changes to a model unit (see claymation and stop motion), and then photographing the result with a special animation camera. When the frames are strung together and the resulting film is viewed at a speed of 16 or more frames per second, there is an illusion of continuous movement (due to the phi phenomenon). Generating such a film is very labor-intensive and tedious, though the development of computer animation has greatly sped up the process. Because animation is very time-consuming and often very expensive to produce, the majority of animation for TV and films comes from professional animation studios. However, the field of independent animation has existed at least since the 1950s, with animation being produced by independent studios (and sometimes by a single person). Several independent animation producers have gone on to enter the professional animation industry. Limited animation is a way of increasing production and decreasing costs of animation by using \\"short cuts\\" in the animation process. This method was pioneered by UPA and popularized by Hanna-Barbera in the United States, and by Osamu Tezuka in Japan, and adapted by other studios as cartoons moved from movie theaters to television. Although most animation studios are now using digital technologies in their productions, there is a specific style of animation that depends on film. Camera-less animation, made famous by film- makers like Norman McLaren, Len Lye, and Stan Brakhage, is painted and drawn directly onto pieces of film, and then run through a projector.

Previous locations include Yonge and College, McCaul St, and Bloor and Spadina, in downtown Toronto. Originally, as a summer program, it was at Dundas St West and Bloor St W (where they cross in Toronto, not in then-Etobicoke). The acronym 'SEED' originally stood for 'Summer of Experience Exploration and Discovery', and when it became year round semestered school it was changed to 'Shared Experience Exploration and Discovery'. Students interested in a particular subject, would gather other students, and together they would find a knowledgeable person to act as a teacher or catalyst, and meet regularly to learn. The groups met at various locations and times, including sometimes evenings and weekends. It was entirely up to the students how many and which subjects they studied, and when and where the groups would meet. A group studying Mass Media, for example, would meet in the evening in the Lowther Avenue home of CBC Radio Broadcasters Betty Tomlinson and Allan Anderson. The Vegan Lifestyles cooking course met and cooked in student homes with parents joining to eat the meals prepared by the students. A Japanese Studies group met at the University of Toronto. A few groups met at SEED's own facilities. SEED was founded by the then Toronto Board of Education as a summer program for high school age students in 1968 during the Pierre Trudeau era, a period that also produced Rochdale College and Theatre Passe Muraille and fostered the growth of Coach House Books and a number of other experimental institutions in Toronto. (SEED was not connected with any of them.) The teachers, or co-ordinators as they were called, in the beginning were Les Birmingham and Murray Shukyn, both of whom came from the elementary school system. While initially a summer only program, the students of the second summer wanted to keep SEED going throughout the year. That fall the students obtained recognition from the University of Toronto, and requested the Board establish it as a high school to obtain core funding (for staff and space) and so that students could obtain high school diplomas. During that fall and winter, students ran SEED without any coordinators, using an office made available free by St Thomas Anglican Church on Huron Street. The Board of Education agreed to make SEED a high school, and in September it was a recognized high school, operating in rented space at what was then the YMHA (at Bloor St W and Spadina) in Toronto. Official enrolment was capped at 100 students, with those 100 eligible to earn high school credits/diplomas. Additional students could also attend but not earn high school credits/diplomas. Grades 9 to 13 were included. Students who had gone to SEED but who were officially under the jurisdiction of a nearby Boards of Education, were included as students. A budget of about $200,000 was approved. Murray Shukyn was the first coordinator. To meet the technical requirement of having a principal, and yet minimize costs, the Superintendent of Secondary Schools A. L. Milloy was appointed Principal, but he was not involved at the school. A small core group of four or five teachers was hired, most of whom were certified to teach in more than one high school subject so that students, if they wished, could still take traditional subjects taught by certified teachers that would qualify for a high school diploma. The students ran the school, often dealing directly with the Board of Education where trustees such as long time trustees Fiona Nelson and Dr. Maurice Lister were supportive. At the time all Ontario high schools, with one exception, followed part B of the Ministry of Education's regulation HS1. Part B outlined the traditional high school program. SEED was only the second school in the province set up under part A. Part A allowed tremendous flexibility. It was now possible to get a high school diploma using many different subjects. The school was influenced by the pedagogical philosophy of A.S. Neill's Summerhill School. It was also known for its catalyst system in which university students, professors, community members and experts-at-large on a variety of fields facilitated classes. Milton van der veen was the catalyst for the SEED newsletter (he is now a volunteer with the charity 'Sleeping Children Around the World'.) Noted late science fiction author Judith Merril ran a weekly science fiction seminar at SEED from 1972‚Äì1973.http://www.judithmerril.com/about.html Other notable catalysts included noted social activist June Callwood, CBC Radio broadcaster Allan Anderson, then-architect Colin Vaughan, journalists John Gault and Maggie Siggins, advertising executive Billy Edwards (one of the subjects of Allan King's film A Married Couple), and notable Toronto City Alderman Ying Hope. Several U of T professors, such as Milt Wilson of Trinity College, also taught courses. Notable faculty included poet and visual artist Luciano Iacobelli. The notable impact of SEED, Toronto's first alternative school in the Toronto District School Board system, was that it opened the door to a number of other alternative schools. Among them were Learnxs, Subway Academy One, SOLE, and ACE, which Murray Shukyn, SEED's co-founder and first coordinator, helped to organize. A notable achievement was a short film entitled Life Times Nine made by SEED students that was nominated for an Academy Award in 1973.https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0070317/ Notable alumni include blogger, journalist, activist and science fiction author Cory Doctorow; former head of the Ontario Securities Commission and V.P. of the Toronto Stock Exchange, lawyer Edward Waitzer;http://www.thebottomlinenews.ca/index.php?section=article&articleid;=274 musician and producer Efrim Menuck; Harvard physics professor and Chair of the Physics Department Melissa Franklin, a co-discover of the top quark; Denina Simmons Canada Research Chair in Aquatic Environmental Biology; visual artists Eli Langer and Michael Lewis; author Claudia Casper; gh3 principal and award- winning landscape architect, Diana Gerrard; intersex activist, researcher and professor of sociology at Wilfrid Laurier University, Morgan Holmes; professor of psychology at Conestoga College, Barry Cull; and photographer Michael McLuhan, son of Marshall McLuhan, notable artist Jesse B.

Early life Born in the Pfalz region to Michael and Margaretha (n√©e Reffert) Minoux, Friedrich Minoux attended Gymnasien in Speyer and Mannheim as was customary for boys at the time.Lehrer, p. 17 After fulfilling his military obligations in 1893, he married Maria Karoline Hente, and took a job at the Essen Gas and Water Works company, where he would rise to the position of Financial Vice President. In 1912, Minoux became an employee of Hugo Stinnes, a prominent German industrialist of the time.Lehrer, p. 18 Minoux achieved considerable financial success while working for Stinnes, at one point earning as much as 350,000 gold marks per year ‚Äî a substantial sum at the time. In 1919 Minoux became a member of the board of the United Citizens of Berlin Coal Dealers AG, and began to diversify his business interests to paper production, automobile manufacturing and coal and steel production.Lehrer, p. 19 In 1923 Minoux left the Stinnes conglomerate to build his own industrial empire. In 1926 he acquired half of the shares of the German-Romanian Petroleum Company AG (Derupag). His main source of income at the time became The Friedrich Minoux Society for Trade and Industry, which was a coal wholesale business. Minoux was also one of the founders of the Citizens of Berlin Urban Power Stations AG, an electric company. By 1938, in his last major business deal, Minoux purchased the Jewish-owned Offenheimer Cellulose and Paper Works company for less than 1 million reichsmarks. The actual value was more than RM12 million, but by that time Nazi actions against Jewish businesses had intensified, and the owner of the mill was forced to sell to Minoux for a pittance. Throughout those years, Minoux and his wife became notable figures in German political and social circles. Wannsee House and political ambitions Wannsee House today Minoux opposed the Weimar Republic and maintained contacts with right-wing extremists, military federations, and politicians. In 1931 he became a member of the Society for the Study of Fascism, and two years later he would be elected into the Academy for German Law.Johannes Tuchel. Am Grossen Wannsee 56-58: Von der Villa Minoux zum Haus der Wannsee-Konferenz. Hentrich, Berlin 1992- Page 5 In 1921, Minoux purchased the Wannsee House (also called Wannsee Villa), which was originally built in the outskirts of Berlin by Ernst Marlier.Lehrer, p I In 1923, during the height of the economic crisis that would eventually cause the collapse of the Weimar Republic and the rise of the Third Reich, Minoux offered his assistance to the German Army High Command in exchange for a cabinet-level position in the coming government. His ambitions would not come to fruition. That same year, the army abandoned plans for a putsch against the government, and talks between Minoux and the Nazis eventually collapsed. On 15 August 1941 Minoux was convicted of defrauding the Berlin Gasworks. At the time this was considered the largest business swindle of the Nazi era.Lehrer, p 18 He was sentenced to 5 years imprisonment and hefty fines. From his jail cell in Berlin, Minoux sold Wannsee House to the Stiftung Nordhav, a foundation controlled by Reinhard Heydrich. Subsequently, the property became an important center of operations for the SS Security Service and the Reich Security Main Office. It was there that the Wannsee Conference would eventually be held on 20 January 1942. Today the villa is a museum dedicated to the remembrance of the Holocaust. Minoux died of starvation a few months after the Allies liberated him from Brandenburg prison in 1945. He was buried in an unmarked grave in the Alter Friedhof on Lindenstra√üe in Wannsee.

On 3 January 1927, the day after his eighteenth birthday, Gibbs went to the rescue of 15-year-old Mervyn Allum during a shark attack at Port Hacking, New South Wales. He managed to fend off the shark by striking at it with his legs and fists and, with the assistance of a friend, pulled Allum clear of the water. Although Alllum died from his injuries, Gibbs was publicly praised by the coroner and local community leaders for his actions, and was subsequently awarded the Albert Medal. Born in Hunters Hill, Sydney, and educated locally, Gibbs was employed by the Australian Gas Light Company (AGL) as a shipping clerk for forty-five years. During the Second World War, he enlisted as a private in the Second Australian Imperial Force in February 1942 and served with the 35th Battalion on home defence and patrolling duties in Sydney and Western Australia for two years. The battalion was deployed to New Guinea in January 1944 for service in the Huon Peninsula campaign, but Gibbs' overseas experience was short lived. He broke his leg on the day of arrival, and spent an extended period in hospitals in New Guinea and Australia. Discharged in December 1944, he returned to his work with AGL. In 1971, the British Government announced that the Albert Medal would be discontinued and living recipients would henceforth be regarded as holders of the George Cross. The change came into effect from 21 October, and living recipients were accordingly invited to exchange their medals; Gibbs took up the offer and formally became a recipient of the George Cross. Aged 82, Gibbs died in Bondi, New South Wales, in 1991. Early life Stanley Frederick Gibbs was born in the Sydney suburb of Hunters Hill, New South Wales, on 2 January 1909. Known as \\"Stan\\", he was the first of four children to Lindsay Thomas Gibbs and Edith Trevillion, who wed the year of his birth. He was followed by two sisters, Ellen in 1910 and Phyllis in 1912, and a brother, Lindsay, in 1917. The specifics of Gibbs' education are unclear, but he left high school before achieving an Intermediate Certificate and at first worked as a shop assistant in a men's store. Gibbs later gained a position with the Australian Gas Light Company (AGL) as a shipping clerk, and by 1927 was living in the Inner West suburb of Marrickville. Port Hacking shark attack On 3 January 1927, following a venture out to Gunnamatta Bay, Gibbs was piloting a launch back into the Grays Point area of Port Hacking when a scream rang out. Gibbs looked up and noticed 15-year-old Mervyn Allum struggling in the water about from the shore. Subsequent reports indicate that the other bathers first thought that Allum, who was known to be a good swimmer, was drowning. Gibbs, however, quickly realised that the youth's leg had been grabbed by a shark. Gibbs immediately dived into the water and swam towards the scene to render Allum assistance, as the latter struggled to fend off the shark. By now the water was red with blood. As Gibbs grabbed for Allum, the teenager was pulled under water. Gibbs had to strike at the shark with his legs and fists and grasp its dorsal fin before the shark would release its grip. While Gibbs' friend, Donald Campbell, rowed a boat towards the pair, Gibbs maintained a hold on the now unconscious Allum, trod water, and splashed to discourage further attacks. The shark continued to circle below during this time, at one point brushing past Gibbs' feet. As Campbell drew near, he and Gibbs managed to lift Allum aboard before Gibbs pulled himself clear of the water. Gibbs later reported that the flesh had been stripped from the ankle to the thigh on one of Allum's legs, and there was evidence of teeth and bite marks to Allum's hands and stomach; Allum was pronounced dead on arrival at hospital. The Port Hacking estuary as seen from the air According to historian Marion Hebblethwaite, \\"the tragedy was a very personal one\\" for Gibbs. Gibbs knew Allum personally and was dating Allum's sister, Vivienne, at the time. Gibbs had celebrated his eighteenth birthday just the day before with Campbell, Vivienne and her sister Wynnes, the four having been camping with family and others at Grays Point over those few days. Vivienne was also present in the launch during the shark attack, and reportedly had to be restrained by another friend to prevent her \\"from diving to her brother's assistance.\\" Allum's funeral occurred two days later, on 5 January. After a service at Andrews Funerals in Ashfield, Allum was buried in the Presbyterian section of Rookwood Cemetery. Gibbs was among the chief mourners, while attendees included Campbell, local politicians Charles Marr and Milton Jarvie, and members of the 1st Ashfield Boy Scouts (of which Allum had been a member). A community meeting was subsequently convened at the Marrickville Town Hall on 7 January 1927 to make arrangements to \\"recognise the conspicuous bravery\\" of Gibbs. The mayor, Milton Jarvie, described Gibbs' efforts as \\"one of the most specific acts of gallantry ever recorded\\" and drew comparisons to the battlefield heroism of the First World War. To much support, Jarvie advocated that a fund be raised to honour Gibbs and that Gibbs' actions be brought to the notice of the Royal Humane Society (RHS) and the governor. Recognition was swift in coming: Gibbs was awarded the Gold Medal of the Royal Shipwreck Relief and Humane Society of New South Wales (the state branch of the RHS) a week later, while the community fund raised over ¬£400. Gibbs also received an offer to join the local Surf Life Saving Club, but declined. Meanwhile, the coroner reporting into Allum's death released his verdict on 20 January. He praised Gibbs' efforts during the shark attack, commenting that Gibbs' \\"bravery and self sacrifice merits the award of the Victoria Cross, if such distinction can be accorded to him\\". Gibbs was ineligible to be considered for the Victoria Cross, his actions being that of a civilian outside of military command and away from a battlefield. However, in recognition of his rescue attempt, Gibbs was subsequently awarded the Albert Medal, a decoration that recognised the saving of life. The notification and accompanying citation for the Albert Medal was published in the London Gazette on 8 February 1927, reading: Career and Second World War Gibbs was presented with his Albert Medal by the Duke of York on 28 March 1927 before a mass of onlookers at Sydney Town Hall. Jarvie, the Marrickville mayor, read Gibbs' citation to the crowd before the duke, to cheers and applause, pinned the medal to Gibb's left breast. After the ceremony, Gibbs' was personally congratulated by several dignitaries (including the Duchess of York) and fellow recipients of the Albert Medal. Among them was Jack Chalmers, who had been recognised for a similar act at Coogee Beach five years earlier. Gibbs gained some level of celebrity following his investiture. He was frequently featured in the press over the following few months, and even became sought after for his autograph. At the Anzac Day commemorations in Melbourne on 25 April, Gibbs was given a place of honour among the state's Victoria Cross recipients at the head of the march. A photograph of Gibbs with Issy Smith VC, captioned \\"Two Heroes\\", adorned the pages of The Argus the next day. The attention did not interfere with Gibbs' professional life, and he continued in his role at AGL. On 20 April 1929, at St Stephen's Church of England in Newtown, Gibbs wed Catherine Charlotte Coulson. Catherine died in November 1933 after little more than four years of marriage, and Gibbs remarried eighteen months later. His second wedding, to Rosamunde Marcelle Walker, occurred at St Stephen's on 20 April 1935, though the marriage was to end in divorce in the 1940s. On 9 February 1942, Gibbs, by now living in Ashbury with his wife and two children, enlisted in the Second Australian Imperial Force (2nd AIF) at Paddington for service in the Second World War. Gibbs (right) with Issy Smith VC at the Melbourne Anzac Day march on 25 April 1927. Gibbs spent six weeks undergoing exercises with the 8th Training Battalion, before being allocated to the 35th Battalion as a private on 16 March. The 35th, a Militia unit assigned to the 8th Brigade, was employed in the defence of Australia following Japan's entry into the war and was initially posted to the St Ives area of Sydney. From early July the battalion relocated to Western Australia‚ÄîGibbs boarded in Sydney on 4 July, disembarking at Fremantle ten days later. The 35th Battalion spent the next two years engaged in training exercises and defensive patrols along the coast of Western Australia, spanning from Bunbury in the south to Geraldton in the Mid West. There is little recorded of Gibbs' personal experiences during this time, although he was hospitalised for a month from October to November 1942 following a diagnosis of \\"neurosis\\". A year later, he was granted four weeks' leave in Sydney over September and October 1943. During this time, the 35th Battalion moved to Gordonvale, Queensland, in preparation for a deployment to New Guinea, and undertook training in jungle warfare. The move north came in January 1944, as the 35th Battalion had been earmarked for a role in the Huon Peninsula campaign in north-eastern New Guinea. Accordingly, Gibbs embarked from Cairns on 18 January, arriving at Finschhafen after a week's voyage. Gibbs' experience in New Guinea, however, was brief: the day of his arrival, Gibbs broke his left leg in an accident. After seventeen days at the 2/5th Australian General Hospital, he was transported to Brisbane aboard the hospital ship Manunda. The break necessitated an extended period of hospitalisation in Australia, and led to a downgrading in his medical classification. Gibbs was subsequently discharged from the 2nd AIF on 28 December 1944 to resume his work with AGL, regarded as an \\"essential occupation\\" to the war effort. For his service during the Second World War, Gibbs was eligible for the Pacific Star, War Medal 1939‚Äì1945 and Australia Service Medal 1939‚Äì1945, though he did not claim his medals until 1973. George Cross and later life Following his divorce from Rosamunde, Gibbs married for a third time. He wed Doris Mannix at St Matthew‚Äôs Church of England in Bondi on 9 September 1948. In 1971, owing to the decline in status and significance of the Albert Medal, the British Government announced that the decoration would be abolished and living recipients would henceforth be regarded as holders of the George Cross. The change came into effect from 21 October, and living recipients were accordingly invited to exchange their medals. All six Australian Albert Medal recipients living at the time opted to accept the offer, Gibbs and four others travelling to London to receive their awards. The five men, Jack Chalmers, Robert Kavanaugh, William McAloney, Dick Richards and Gibbs, were presented with their George Crosses by Queen Elizabeth II in an investiture ceremony at Buckingham Palace on 12 July 1972. In 1974, during an interview on his Albert Medal actions, Gibbs remarked that he had \\"never been back to Port Hacking since\\". He retired from AGL that year after forty-five years service, and settled in Bondi. An enthusiastic sportsman, Gibbs played tennis, golf, football, baseball and, in his twilight years, lawn bowls with the Bronte Bowling Club. In 1977, he was awarded the Queen Elizabeth II Silver Jubilee Medal. Gibbs died in Bondi on 3 March 1991, aged 82. Survived by his third wife, and by a daughter and son from an earlier marriage, Gibbs' body was cremated and his ashes interred at the Eastern Suburbs Memorial Park in Matraville. Gibbs is commemorated by a plaque in the George Cross Park, Canberra.

It was established by an order of Catholic nuns -- Dominican Sisters -- who started teaching in Oamaru in 1882. It is associated with St Patrick's Basilica, Oamaru History In 1884 the first classrooms were in the presbytery - up to five classes were taught there. The school was staffed by Dominican nuns. Priests visited the school taking an interest both in examinations and in cultural activities such as musical events. In 1928 the Christian Brothers took over the running of St Patrick's primary school for boys in Oamaru and two Christian Brothers commuted daily from St Kevin's College (founded in 1927). That school continued until a reorganisation in 1973 saw its closure. The younger boys went to St Joseph's while the older boys transferred to St Kevin's College. In 1984 there was a further reorganisation in which the St Joseph's became a full primary school for both boys and girls up to year 8. The red-brick building built for St Patrick's is now used for junior classes of St Joseph's while the older pupils are taught in newer buildings, closer to St Patrick's Basilica in Reed Street. The school continues to maintain its Dominican connection especially with the starting of a \\"Dominican choir\\" in 2008. The school remains closely associated with St Kevin's College, and reports that 99% of its pupils go there after they leave St Joseph's. Current status and activity Currently, the school's principal is Mrs Jenny Jackson. The school lists student leadership as a major strength, reporting that pupils from years 3-8 sit on the school council. The teacher who manages the middle syndicate is Miss Melanie Sloan. She suffers from early onset rheumatoid arthritis and has had her knee and hip joints replaced to relieve the disabling pain which had confined her to a wheelchair. In 2010, she received a Spirit of Attitude award for being \\"an unsung hero who lives life with positivity while facing extreme adversity.\\" She was presented with the supreme award for her positive attitude by minister Nick Smith in Auckland.

In 1994, he established Cross+Roads Press, dedicated to the publication of first chapbooks by poets, short story writers, novelists and artists.  Biography  Blei was born in an ethnic (primarily Czechoslovakian) neighborhood of western Chicago, Illinois known as Little Village. An only child, Blei and his parents moved to the near-western Chicago suburb of Cicero when he was in grade school. CHI TOWN (1990) Blei attended Illinois State University, studying English, and graduated in 1956. He taught high school English and subsequently worked at the City News Bureau of Chicago as a reporter. In 1969, Blei left Chicago and moved to Door County, Wisconsin, a rural vacation destination for Midwesterners on the Door Peninsula in Lake Michigan. For four decades, he worked in a converted chicken coop in Ellison Bay, Wisconsin. Blei's first book was The Hour of the Sunshine Now: Short Stories by Norbert Blei, published in 1978. Blei was an early adopter of the Internet as a means to distribute his own work and call attention to other writers. His Poetry Dispatch was a weekly enewsletter that featured a short selection of poems by a single, noteworthy poet, while Notes from the Underground was an irregular email that featured brief essays on current topics, literary and otherwise.  Literary themes  A sense of community and threats to community were the twin themes of Blei's writing, whether he is writing about urban Chicago or rural Wisconsin: \\"Norb specializes in the fleeting look at the little people of the city, the aged newsstand operators, the small restaurant owners, Greek, Bohemian, Slovak, who still provide, in out-of-the-way neighborhoods, national dishes and national atmosphere. And he is determined to get these glimpses of a disappearing Chicago on paper before they are ploughed under to make way for new high-rise apartments, or succumb to the creeping wave of debris, human and material, so characteristic of most large cities these days.\\" (Henry Shea, 1970) \\"Thus a profound feeling of loss permeates all of Blei's work. Perhaps Blei's own sense of himself as an isolated, alienated writer‚Äîa consistent self-portrait, across geographies and through years of economic and literary success and failure, prominence and reduced visibility‚Äîderives from his sense of doomed place, or, more properly, doomed community in place. Whether author imposes his vision on place (others in Cicero and Door County have found more to cheer about over the past thirty years), or place imposes itself on author, the result is an author celebrating the forgotten, the beat and defeated: others and himself.\\" (David Pichaske, 2000) The Ghost of Sandburg's Phizzog (1986) 'The Elephants and Everybody Else' (Crossroads+Press)  Cross+Roads Press  In the early 1990s, Blei started Cross+Roads Press to offer established and beginning writers an opportunity to be published in chapbook form. To date, works by almost 40 writers have been published.  The Clearing  For over 30 years, Blei was writer-in-residence at The Clearing, a folk arts school founded in 1935 by landscape architect Jens Jensen. Blei's annual June writing classes drew developing writers from across the country. After 2007, Blei conducted his annual writing classes independently. 'Torso,' Berlin Wall Series  Visual arts  Blei was a watercolor artist. Following a trip to Berlin in the then- West Germany in the early 1980s, he created a series of works based on the experience. The \\"Die Mauer\\" paintings focused on the Berlin Wall and were exhibited in Santa Fe and other locations. Chronicles of a Rural Journalist in America (1990)  Writing projects  Blei collaborated with the pseudonymous Monsieur K, located in France, who created an assortment of web sites for posting writings artists judged to abide by the spirit of \\"free jazz\\". Blei regularly provided Monsieur K with commentary on significant artistic events for the Metropolis site, poetry and other material for the Basho's Road site, and artistic profiles and critiques for Poetry Dispatch & Other Notes from the Underground. Alterra Coffeehouse, Downer Avenue, Milwaukee, Wis. Controversy Blei fomented local controversy when he outlined a new vision for Door County, Wisconsin in an article in the area's weekly newspaper, The Door Reminder. Published in 1992, it was titled \\"Shut the Damn Door\\". The area's residents were sharply divided on the proposal, as recounted in an essay by Blei's publisher at Ellis Press, David Pichaske: \\"Blei outlined a Master Plan for the Future of Door County loosely based on the 'Industrial Tourism' chapter of Ed Abbey's Desert Solitaire. Blei suggests that county officials freeze all building, property sales, and residential, commercial and public planning in the County; turn the entire County over to Nature Conservancy; close the new bridge at Sturgeon Bay and make an outdoor walking mall of it, with artsy-craftsy shops, a Ferris wheel, and Chicago style food vendors; admit tourists freely across the old bridge May through October, subject to a tax of $50 per vehicle per week and $25 per person per day, but from November through April by visa only; tear up all highways and back roads and return them to their natural state of dirt, gravel, good Door County earth; place a moratorium on new road construction in the County; encourage vandalism of commercial signs while instituting a $3,000 fine for anyone caught erecting new advertisements or newspaper mail boxes; tear up 'ugly metal road signs' and either replace them with wooden ones or leave the roads nameless. 'Take any dirt road and get lost,' Blei concludes. 'You may discover the real value of this place. You may discover yourself.'\\" Blei, aka 'Coyote'; drawing by Chick Peterson  Works   Novels  * The Second Novel: Becoming a Writer (1978) * Adventures in an American's Literature (1982)  Story collections  * The Hour of the Sunshine Now: Short Stories by Norbert Blei (1978) * The Ghost of Sandburg's Phizzog (1986)  Non-fiction  * Door Way: The People in the Landscape (1981) * Door Steps (1983) * Door to Door (1985) * Neighborhood (1987) * Meditations on a Small Lake (1987) * Chi- Town (1990) * Chronicles of a Rural Journalist in America (1990) * Winter Book (2002)  Poetry  * Paint Me a Picture/Make Me a Poem (1987) 'The Quiet Time: Door County in Winter' (1997)  Collections and anthologies  * Wisconsin's Rustic Roads: A Road Less Travelled; Photographs by Bob Rashid, Text By Ben Logan, George Vukelich, Jean Feraca, Norbert Blei and Bill Stokes (1995) * Rooted: Seven Midwest Writers of Place, by David Pichaske, University of Iowa Press (2006) * Selected Anthologies  Recordings  * The Quiet Time, Door County in Winter: Readings by Norb Blei/Music by Jim Spector (1997) * Readings from Door Way (1996)  References  # Article by Doug Moe, Wisconsin State Journal (6.11.08), 'Blei's words still resonate in reprint' # Barbara Fitz Vroman on Norbert Blei # 'Norbert Blei: Portrait of the Artist as Outsider,' by David Pichaske, Studies in American Fiction # Marshall Cook interview with Norbert Blei # Door TourPage interview re: Crossroads Press # The Writer's Almanac with Garrison Keillor (8.23.00) External links * * poetry dispatch & other notes from the underground * Basho's Road * Outlaw Poetry Network * Spoon River Poetry Press * Chowhound: Norbert Blei's Neighborhood (Bohemian Chicago) * \\"The Chair Trick\\" at The New Yorker Category:1935 births Category:2013 deaths Category:20th-century American novelists Category:20th-century American male writers Category:Writers from Chicago Category:People from Door County, Wisconsin Category:Novelists from Wisconsin Category:Illinois State University alumni Category:Novelists from Illinois Category:American male novelists Category:American male essayists Category:American male short story writers Category:20th-century American short story writers Category:20th-century American essayists Category:People from Cicero, Illinois ","title":"Norbert Blei"},{"id":"21555916","text":"The quarter of Leimbach in Z√ºrich. is a quarter in the district 2 in Z√ºrich.

It was managed by the South Essex Partnership University NHS Foundation Trust.  History  Nasogastric intubation is performed at Runwell Hospital in 1943 Following the ending of contracts accommodating patients at the Essex County Council's Brentwood Mental Hospital, joint facilities were developed between East Ham and Southend-on-Sea boroughs. A site was chosen in Runwell at Runwell Hall Farm, to the north of the town of Wickford and the firm of Elcock and Sutcliffe were chosen as architects to the site, the former having previously designed the new Bethlem Royal Hospital at Monks Orchard. The foundation stone was laid by Laurence Brock in June 1934 and the hospital was officially opened by Sir Kingsley Wood, Minister of Health, as Runwell Mental Hospital in June 1937. The chapel, dedicated to St. Luke, was placed in a prominent position. The hospital was bombed by the German Luftwaffe during the Second World War; there was extensive damage including a number of large craters but no injuries to staff. The hospital joined the National Health Service in 1948 and Professor John Corsellis led to the development of a \\"brain bank\\", using samples taken from patients not just from the hospital but from elsewhere in the United Kingdom. It became Runwell Hospital in 1955. Following the introduction of Care in the Community in the early 1980s, the hospital went into a period of decline and eventually closed in August 2010. Proposals to develop the site initially included provision for a large prison but this proposal was withdrawn following strong local opposition. The site has since been developed for residential use by Countryside Properties and the area is now known as St Luke's Park.

Tropical Storm Olive, moving west-northwest near , turned toward Wake Island on September 15\\\\. Around 1800 UTC Olive was upgraded into typhoon, with winds of . Continuing to intensify, Olive passed near Wake Island, where maximum sustained winds of were recorded. Around this time, reconnaissance aircraft reported a minimum central pressure of 945 mbar (hPa; 27.91 inHg). On September 16, Olive intensified from a Category 2 to a Category 4 typhoon, attained the equivalence of super typhoon intensity, and strengthened to a peak intensity of the following day far from land. On September 18, Olive weakened from a Category 5 to a Category 2 typhoon and recurved northeast. On September 19, the cyclone lost typhoon intensity. Tropical Storm Olive transitioned into an extratropical cyclone and was last monitored on September 21.

Olive, the second typhoon to affect the island since 1935, produced sustained wind speeds of and peak gusts of on the island. Significant flooding was also recorded. Damage was severe; it is estimated that 85% of the island's structures were demolished due to the storm. All of the homes and the island's hotel were destroyed. Additionally, the island's chapel and quonset huts were destroyed. The island's LORAN station, operated by the United States Coast Guard, was also destroyed. On September 18, water and power services were restored.The Clipper publication. Plans to Rebuild Wake are Already Under Way (September 25, 1952). Pan American World Airways Pacific-Alaska Division. The facilities on the island were fully restored in 1953. The total cost to repair damages caused by Olive amounted to $1.6 million (1952 USD; $13 million 2009 USD). No fatalities occurred on the island, and four injuries were reported. None of the 230 Pan American World Airways employees received injuries.

The blacklist involved the practice of denying employment to entertainment industry professionals believed to be or to have been Communists or sympathizers. Not just actors, but screenwriters, directors, musicians, and other American entertainment professionals were barred from work by the studios. This was usually done on the basis of their membership, alleged membership in, or even just sympathy with the Communist Party USA, or on the basis of their refusal to assist Congressional investigations into the party's activities. Even during the period of its strictest enforcement, from the late 1940s through to the late 1950s, the blacklist was rarely made explicit or verifiable, but it quickly and directly damaged or ended the careers and income of scores of individuals working in the film industry.  Hollywood Ten  The first systematic Hollywood blacklist was instituted on November 25, 1947, the day after ten writers and directors were cited for contempt of Congress for refusing to testify before the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC). These personalities were subpoenaed to appear before HUAC in October. The contempt citation included a criminal charge, which led to a highly publicized trial and an eventual conviction with a maximum of one year in jail in addition to a $1,000 fine. The Congressional action prompted a group of studio executives, acting under the aegis of the Association of Motion Picture Producers, to fire the artists ‚Äì the so-called Hollywood Ten ‚Äì and made what has become known as the Waldorf Statement. It was announced via a news release after the major producers met at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel and it included a condemnation of the personalities involved, effectively ostracizing those named from the industry. These producers instituted a compulsory oaths of loyalty from among its employees with the threat of a blacklist.  Blacklist  On June 22, 1950, a pamphlet entitled Red Channels was published. Focused on the field of broadcasting, it identified 151 entertainment industry professionals in the context of \\"Red Fascists and their sympathizers\\". Soon, most of those named, along with a host of other artists, were barred from employment in most of the entertainment field. The blacklist lasted until 1960, when Dalton Trumbo, a Communist Party member from 1943 to 1948Victor Navasky, Naming Names, New York: Viking, 2003 and member of the Hollywood Ten, was credited as the screenwriter of the film Exodus (1960), and publicly acknowledged by actor Kirk Douglas for writing the screenplay for Spartacus (also 1960).Kirk Douglas, \\"My Spartacus Broke All the Rules\\", The Daily Telegraph Many of those blacklisted, however, were still barred from work in their professions for years afterward. History Background The Hollywood blacklist was rooted in events of the 1930s and the early 1940s, encompassing the height of the Great Depression and World War II. Two major film industry strikes during the 1930s increased tensions between the Hollywood producers and the unions, particularly the Screen Writers Guild.Murphy (2003), p. 16. The Communist Party USA (CPUSA) lost substantial support after the Moscow show trials of 1936‚Äì1938 and the Molotov‚ÄìRibbentrop Pact of 1939. The U.S. government began turning its attention to the possible links between Hollywood and the party during this period. Under then-chairman Martin Dies, Jr., the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) released a report in 1938 claiming that communism was pervasive in Hollywood. Two years later, Dies privately took testimony from a former Communist Party member, John L. Leech, who named forty-two movie industry professionals as Communists. After Leech repeated his charges in supposed confidence to a Los Angeles grand jury, many of the names were reported in the press, including those of stars Humphrey Bogart, James Cagney, Katharine Hepburn, Melvyn Douglas and Fredric March, among other Hollywood figures. Dies said he would \\"clear\\" all those who co-operated by meeting with him in what he called \\"executive session\\". Within two weeks of the grand jury leak, all those on the list except for actress Jean Muir had met with the HUAC chairman. Dies \\"cleared\\" everyone except actor Lionel Stander, who was fired by the movie studio, Republic Pictures, where he was under contract.Ceplair and Englund (2003), pp. 156‚Äì157. In 1941, producer Walt Disney took out an ad in Variety, the industry trade magazine, declaring his conviction that \\"Communist agitation\\" was behind a cartoonists and animators' strike. According to historians Larry Ceplair and Steven Englund, \\"In actuality, the strike had resulted from Disney's overbearing paternalism, high-handedness, and insensitivity.\\"Ceplair and Englund (2003), pp. 157‚Äì158. Inspired by Disney, California State Senator Jack Tenney, chairman of the state legislature's Joint Fact-Finding Committee on Un-American Activities, launched an investigation of \\"Reds in movies\\". The probe fell flat, and was mocked in several Variety headlines. The subsequent wartime alliance between the United States and the Soviet Union brought the CPUSA newfound credibility. During the war, membership in the party reached a peak of 50,000.Johnpoll (1994), p. xv. As World War II drew to a close, perceptions changed again, with communism increasingly becoming a focus of American fears and hatred. In 1945, Gerald L. K. Smith, founder of the neofascist America First Party, began giving speeches in Los Angeles assailing the \\"alien minded Russian Jews in Hollywood\\".Horne (2006), p. 174. Mississippi congressman John E. Rankin, a member of HUAC, held a press conference to declare that \\"one of the most dangerous plots ever instigated for the overthrow of this Government has its headquarters in Hollywood ... the greatest hotbed of subversive activities in the United States\\". Rankin promised, \\"We're on the trail of the tarantula now\\".Murphy (2003), p. 17. Reports of Soviet repression in Eastern and Central Europe in the war's aftermath added more fuel to what became known as the \\"Second Red Scare\\". The growth of conservative political influence and the Republican triumph in the 1946 Congressional elections, which saw the party take control of both the House and Senate, led to a major revival of institutional anticommunist activity, publicly spearheaded by HUAC. The following year, the Motion Picture Alliance for the Preservation of American Ideals (MPA), a political action group cofounded by Walt Disney, issued a pamphlet advising producers on the avoidance of \\"subtle communistic touches\\" in their films. Its counsel revolved around a list of ideological prohibitions, such as \\"Don't smear the free-enterprise system ... Don't smear industrialists ... Don't smear wealth ... Don't smear the profit motive ... Don't deify the 'common man' ... Don't glorify the collective\\".Cohen (2004), pp. 169‚Äì170. The blacklist begins (1946‚Äì1947) On July 29, 1946, William R. Wilkerson, publisher and founder of The Hollywood Reporter, published a \\"TradeView\\" column entitled \\"A Vote For Joe Stalin\\". It named as Communist sympathizers Dalton Trumbo, Maurice Rapf, Lester Cole, Howard Koch, Harold Buchman, John Wexley, Ring Lardner Jr., Harold Salemson, Henry Meyers, Theodore Strauss, and John Howard Lawson. In August and September 1946, Wilkerson published other columns containing names of numerous purported Communists and sympathizers. They became known as \\"Billy's List\\" and \\"Billy's Blacklist\\". In 1962, when Wilkerson died, his THR obituary stated he had \\"named names, pseudonyms and card numbers and was widely credited with being chiefly responsible for preventing communists from becoming entrenched in Hollywood production ‚Äì something that foreign film unions have been unable to do.\\" In a 65th-anniversary article in 2012, Wilkerson's son apologized for the paper's role in the blacklist, stating that his father was motivated by revenge for his own thwarted ambition to own a studio. In October 1947, drawing upon the list named in The Hollywood Reporter, the House Un-American Activities Committee subpoenaed a number of persons working in the Hollywood film industry to testify at hearings. The committee had declared its intention to investigate whether Communist agents and sympathizers had been planting propaganda in American films.See, e. g., The hearings began with appearances by Walt Disney and Ronald Reagan, then president of the Screen Actors Guild. Disney testified that the threat of Communists in the film industry was a serious one, and named specific people who had worked for him as probable Communists.Cohen (2004), p. 167. Reagan testified that a small clique within his union was using \\"communist-like tactics\\" in attempting to steer union policy, but that he did not know if those (unnamed) members were communists or not, and that in any case he thought the union had them under control.\\"testimony of Ronald Reagan and Walt Disney\\" http://historymatters.gmu.edu/d/6458/ (Later his first wife, actress Jane Wyman, stated in her biography written with Joe Morella [1985] that Reagan's allegations against friends and colleagues led to tension in their marriage, eventually resulting in their divorce.) Actor Adolphe Menjou declared: \\"I am a witch hunter if the witches are Communists. I am a Red-baiter. I would like to see them all back in Russia.\\"Scott and Rutkoff (1999), p. 338. In contrast, other leading Hollywood figures, including director John Huston and actors Humphrey Bogart, Lauren Bacall, Judy Garland and Danny Kaye, organized the Committee for the First Amendment to protest the government's targeting of the film industry.Ceplair and Englund (2003), pp. 275‚Äì279. Members of the committee, such as Sterling Hayden, assured Bogart that they were not Communists. During the hearings, a local Washington paper reported that Hayden was a Communist. After returning to Hollywood, Bogart shouted at Danny Kaye, \\"You fuckers sold me out.\\"Kenneth Billingsley, Hollywood Party: How Communism Seduced the American Film Industry in the 1930s and 1940s (Roseville, CA, 2000. , pp. 191‚Äì195. The group came under attack as being naive or foolish. Under pressure from his studio, Warner Bros., to distance himself from the Hollywood Ten, Bogart negotiated a statement that did not denounce the committee, but said that his trip was \\"ill-advised, even foolish\\".Sean Griffin (ed). What Dreams Were Made Of: Movie Stars of the 1940s. Rutgers University Press, 2011, p. 92. Billy Wilder told the group that \\"we oughta fold\\".Ronald and Allis Radosh. Red Star over Hollywood: The Film Colony's Long Romance with the Left. San Francisco: Encounter Books, pp. 161‚Äì162. Many of the film industry professionals in whom HUAC had expressed interest were alleged to have been members of the Communist Party USA. Of the 43 people put on the witness list, 19 declared that they would not give evidence. Eleven of these 19 were called before the committee. Members of the Committee for the First Amendment flew to Washington ahead of this climactic phase of the hearing, which commenced on Monday, October 27.Ceplair and Englund (2003), pp. 281‚Äì282. Of the eleven \\"unfriendly witnesses\\", one, √©migr√© playwright Bertolt Brecht, ultimately chose to answer the committee's questions (following which he left the country).Dick (1989), p. 7. The other ten refused, citing their First Amendment rights to freedom of speech and assembly. Included among the questions they refused to answer was one now generally rendered as \\"Are you now, or have you ever been, a member of the Communist Party?\\". The Committee formally accused these ten of contempt of Congress, and began criminal proceedings against them in the full House of Representatives. In light of the \\"Hollywood Ten\\"'s defiance of HUAC ‚Äì in addition to refusing to testify, many had tried to read statements decrying the committee's investigation as unconstitutional ‚Äì political pressure mounted on the film industry to demonstrate its \\"anti-subversive\\" bona fides. Late in the hearings, Eric Johnston, president of the Association of Motion Picture Producers (AMPP) (and Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA)), declared to the committee that he would never \\"employ any proven or admitted Communist because they are just a disruptive force, and I don't want them around\\". On November 17, the Screen Actors Guild voted to make its officers swear a pledge asserting each was not a Communist. The following week, on November 24, the House of Representatives voted 346 to 17 to approve citations against the Hollywood Ten for contempt of Congress. The next day, following a meeting of film industry executives at New York's Waldorf-Astoria hotel, AMPP President Johnston issued a press release that is today referred to as the Waldorf Statement. Their statement said that the ten would be fired or suspended without pay and not re-employed until they were cleared of contempt charges and had sworn that they were not Communists. The first Hollywood blacklist was in effect. The list grows (1948‚Äì1950) The HUAC hearings failed to turn up any evidence that Hollywood was secretly disseminating Communist propaganda, but the industry was nonetheless transformed. The fallout from the inquiry was a factor in the decision by Floyd Odlum, the primary owner of RKO Pictures, to leave the industry.Lasky (1989), p. 204. As a result, the studio passed into the hands of Howard Hughes. Within weeks of taking over in May 1948, Hughes fired most of RKO's employees and virtually shut the studio down for six months as he had the political sympathies of the rest investigated. Then, just as RKO swung back into production, Hughes made the decision to settle a long-standing federal antitrust suit against the industry's Big Five studios. This was one of the crucial steps in the collapse of the studio system that had governed Hollywood for a quarter-century. In early 1948, all of the Hollywood Ten were convicted of contempt. Following a series of unsuccessful appeals, the cases arrived before the Supreme Court; among the submissions filed in defense of the ten was an amicus curiae brief signed by 204 Hollywood professionals. After the court denied review, the Hollywood Ten began serving one-year prison sentences in 1950. One of the Ten, screenwriter Dalton Trumbo, stated in the documentary film Hollywood On Trial (1976): In September 1950, one of the Ten, director Edward Dmytryk, publicly announced that he had once been a Communist and was prepared to give evidence against others who had been as well. He was released early from jail; following his 1951 HUAC appearance, in which he described his brief membership in the party and named names, his career recovered.Gevinson (1997), p. 234. The others remained silent and most were unable to obtain work in the American film and television industry for many years. Adrian Scott, who had produced four of Dmytryk's films ‚Äì Murder, My Sweet; Cornered; So Well Remembered; and Crossfire ‚Äì was one of those named by his former friend. Scott's next screen credit did not come until 1972 and he never produced another feature film. Some of those blacklisted continued to write for Hollywood or the broadcasting industry surreptitiously, using pseudonyms or the names of friends who posed as the actual writers (those who allowed their names to be used in this fashion were called \\"fronts\\"). Of the 204 who signed the amicus brief, 84 were themselves blacklisted.Stone (2004), p. 365. There was a more general chilling effect: Humphrey Bogart, who had been one of the most prominent members of the Committee for the First Amendment, felt compelled to write an article for Photoplay magazine denying he was a Communist sympathizer.Bogart (1948). The Tenney Committee, which had continued its state-level investigations, summoned songwriter Ira Gershwin to testify about his participation in the committee.Jablonski (1998), p. 350. Mutual network to ABC: \\"Communist Party members and fellow-travelers have often been guests on [Arthur] Gaeth's program.\\" A number of non-governmental organizations participated in enforcing and expanding the blacklist; in particular, the American Legion, the conservative war veterans' group, was instrumental in pressuring the entertainment industry to exclude communists and their sympathizers. In 1949, the Americanism Division of the Legion issued its own blacklist ‚Äì a roster of 128 people whom it claimed were participants in the \\"Communist Conspiracy\\". Among the names on the Legion's list was that of the playwright Lillian Hellman.Newman (1989), 140. Hellman had written or contributed to the screenplays of approximately ten motion pictures up to that point; she was not employed again by a Hollywood studio until 1966. Another influential group was American Business Consultants Inc., founded in 1947. In the subscription information for its weekly publication Counterattack, \\"The Newsletter of Facts to Combat Communism\\", it declared that it was run by \\"a group of former FBI men. It has no affiliation whatsoever with any government agency.\\" Notwithstanding that claim, it seems the editors of Counterattack had direct access to the files of both the Federal Bureau of Investigation and HUAC; the results of that access became widely apparent with the June 1950 publication of Red Channels. This Counterattack spinoff listed 151 people in entertainment and broadcast journalism, along with records of their involvement in what the pamphlet meant to be taken as Communist or pro- Communist activities.Red Channels (1950), pp. 6, 214. A few of those named, such as Hellman, were already being denied employment in the motion picture, TV, and radio fields; the publication of Red Channels meant that scores more were placed on the blacklist. That year, CBS instituted a loyalty oath which it required of all its employees.Buhle and Wagner (2003a), p. 7. Jean Muir was the first performer to lose employment because of a listing in Red Channels. In 1950, Muir was named as a Communist sympathizer in the pamphlet, and was immediately removed from the cast of the television sitcom The Aldrich Family, in which she had been cast as Mrs. Aldrich. NBC had received between 20 and 30 phone calls protesting her being in the show. General Foods, the sponsor, said that it would not sponsor programs in which \\"controversial persons\\" were featured. Though the company later received thousands of calls protesting the decision, it was not reversed.Brown, pp. 89‚Äì90 HUAC returns (1951‚Äì1952) In 1951, with the U.S. Congress now under Democratic control, HUAC launched a second investigation of Hollywood and Communism. As actor Larry Parks said when called before the panel, > Don't present me with the choice of either being in contempt of this > committee and going to jail or forcing me to really crawl through the mud to > be an informer. For what purpose? I don't think it is a choice at all. I > don't think this is really sportsmanlike. I don't think this is American. I > don't think this is American justice.Parish (2004), p. 92. Parks ultimately testified, becoming, however reluctantly, a \\"friendly witness\\", and found himself blacklisted, nonetheless. In fact, the legal tactics of those refusing to testify had changed by this time; instead of relying on the First Amendment, they invoked the Fifth Amendment's shield against self-incrimination (although, as before, Communist Party membership was not illegal). While this usually allowed a witness to avoid \\"naming names\\" without being indicted for contempt of Congress, \\"taking the Fifth\\" before HUAC guaranteed one's membership on the industry blacklist.Ceplair and Englund (2003), p. 387. Historians at times distinguish between the relatively official blacklist ‚Äì the names of those who (a) were called by HUAC and, in whatever manner, refused to co-operate and/or (b) were identified as Communists in the hearings ‚Äì and the so-called graylist ‚Äì those others who were denied work because of their political or personal affiliations, real or imagined; the consequences, however, were largely the same. The graylist also refers more specifically to those who were denied work by the major studios, but could still find jobs on Poverty Row: Composer Elmer Bernstein, for instance, was called by HUAC when it was discovered that he had written some music reviews for a Communist newspaper. After he refused to name names, pointing out that he had never attended a Communist Party meeting, he found himself composing music for movies such as Cat Women of the Moon. Anticommunist tract from the 1950s, decrying the \\"REDS of Hollywood and Broadway\\" Like Parks and Dmytryk, others also co-operated with the committee. Some friendly witnesses gave broadly damaging testimony with less apparent reluctance, most prominently director Elia Kazan and screenwriter Budd Schulberg. Their co-operation in describing the political leanings of their friends and professional associates effectively brought a halt to dozens of careers and compelled a number of artists to depart for Mexico or Europe. Others were also forced abroad in order to work. Director Jules Dassin was among the best known of these. Briefly a Communist, Dassin had left the party in 1939. He was immediately blacklisted after Edward Dmytryk and fellow filmmaker Frank Tuttle named him to HUAC in 1952. Dassin left for France, and spent much of his remaining career in Greece.Wakeman (1987), pp. 190, 192. Scholar Thomas Doherty describes how the HUAC hearings swept onto the blacklist those who had never even been particularly active politically, let alone suspected of being Communists: > [O]n March 21, 1951, the name of the actor Lionel Stander was uttered by the > actor Larry Parks during testimony before HUAC. \\"Do you know Lionel > Stander?\\" committee counsel Frank S. Tavenner inquired. Parks replied he > knew the man, but had no knowledge of his political affiliations. No more > was said about Stander either by Parks or the committee ‚Äì no accusation, no > insinuation. Yet Stander's phone stopped ringing. Prior to Parks's > testimony, Stander had worked on ten television shows in the previous 100 > days. Afterwards, nothing.Doherty (2003), p. 31. When Stander was himself called before HUAC, he began by pledging his full support in the fight against \\"subversive\\" activities: > I know of a group of fanatics who are desperately trying to undermine the > Constitution of the United States by depriving artists and others of Life, > Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness without due process of law ... I can > tell names and cite instances and I am one of the first victims of it ... > [This is] a group of ex-Fascists and America-Firsters and anti-Semites, > people who hate everybody, including Negroes, minority groups, and most > likely themselves ... [T]hese people are engaged in a conspiracy outside all > the legal processes to undermine the very fundamental American concepts upon > which our entire system of democracy exists.Quoted in Belton (1994), pp. > 202‚Äì203. Stander was clearly speaking of the committee itself.Belton (1994), p. 203. The hunt for subversives extended into every branch of the entertainment industry. In the field of animation, two studios in particular were affected: United Productions of America (UPA) was purged of a large portion of its staff, while New York-based Tempo was entirely crushed.Cohen (2004), pp. 173‚Äì179. HUAC investigations effectively destroyed families. Screenwriter Richard Collins, after a brief period on the blacklist, became a friendly witness and dumped his wife, actress Dorothy Comingore, who refused to name names. Divorcing Comingore, Collins took the couple's young son, as well. The family's story was later dramatized in the film Guilty by Suspicion (1991), in which the character based on Comingore \\"commits suicide rather than endure a long mental collapse\\".Buhle and Wagner (2003b), p. 21. In real life, Comingore succumbed to alcoholism and died of a pulmonary disease at the age of fifty- eight. In the description of historians Paul Buhle and David Wagner, \\"premature strokes and heart attacks were fairly common [among blacklistees], along with heavy drinking as a form of suicide on the installment plan\\". For all that, evidence that Communists were actually using Hollywood films as vehicles for subversion remained hard to come by. Schulberg reported that the manuscript of his novel What Makes Sammy Run? (later a screenplay, as well) had been subject to an ideological critique by Hollywood Ten writer John Howard Lawson, whose comments he had solicited. The significance of such interactions was questionable. As historian Gerald Horne describes, many Hollywood screenwriters had joined or associated with the local Communist Party chapter because it \\"offered a collective to a profession that was enmeshed in tremendous isolation at the typewriter. Their 'Writers' Clinic' had 'an informal \\"board\\" of respected screenwriters' ‚Äì including Lawson and Ring Lardner Jr. ‚Äì 'who read and commented upon any screenplay submitted to them. Although their criticism could be plentiful, stinging, and (sometimes) politically dogmatic, the author was entirely free to accept it or reject it as he or she pleased without incurring the slightest \\"consequence\\" or sanction.'\\"Horne (2006), p. 134. Much of the onscreen evidence of Communist influence uncovered by HUAC was feeble at best. One witness remembered Stander, while performing in a film, whistling the left-wing \\"Internationale\\" as his character waited for an elevator. \\"Another noted that screenwriter Lester Cole had inserted lines from a famous pro-Loyalist speech by La Pasionaria about it being 'better to die on your feet than to live on your knees' into a pep talk delivered by a football coach.\\" Others disagree about how Communists affected the film industry. The author Kenneth Billingsley, writing in Reason magazine, said that Trumbo wrote in The Daily Worker about films which he said communist influence in Hollywood had prevented from being made: among them were proposed adaptations of Arthur Koestler's anti- totalitarian works Darkness at Noon and The Yogi and the Commissar, which described the rise of communism in Russia.Kenneth Billingsley, \\"Hollywood's Missing Movies: Why American films have ignored life under communism\\", Reason Magazine, June 2000 Authors Ronald and Allis Radosh, writing in Red Star over Hollywood: The Film Colony's Long Romance with the Left, said that Trumbo bragged about how he and other party members stopped anti-communist films from being produced.Ronald and Allis Radosh, Red Star over Hollywood: The Film Colony's Long Romance with the Left. San Francisco: Encounter Books (2005). . Height (1952‚Äì1956) In 1952, the Screen Writers Guild ‚Äì which had been founded two decades before by three future members of the Hollywood Ten ‚Äì authorized the movie studios to \\"omit from the screen\\" the names of any individuals who had failed to clear themselves before Congress. Writer Dalton Trumbo, for instance, one of the Hollywood Ten and still on the blacklist, had received screen credit in 1950 for writing, years earlier, the story on which the screenplay of Columbia Pictures' Emergency Wedding was based. There was no more of that until the 1960s. The name of Albert Maltz, who had written the original screenplay for The Robe in the mid-1940s, was nowhere to be seen when the movie was released in 1953.Dick (1989), p. 94. As William O'Neill describes, pressure was maintained even on those who had ostensibly \\"cleared\\" themselves: > On December 27, 1952, the American Legion announced that it disapproved of a > new film, Moulin Rouge, starring Jos√© Ferrer, who used to be no more > progressive than hundreds of other actors and had already been grilled by > HUAC. The picture itself was based on the life of Toulouse-Lautrec and was > totally apolitical. Nine members of the Legion had picketed it anyway, > giving rise to the controversy. By this time, people were not taking any > chances. Ferrer immediately wired the Legion's national commander that he > would be glad to join the veterans in their \\"fight against > communism\\".O'Neill (1990), p. 239. The group's efforts dragged many others onto the blacklist: In 1954, \\"[s]creenwriter Louis Pollock, a man without any known political views or associations, suddenly had his career yanked out from under him because the American Legion confused him with Louis Pollack, a California clothier, who had refused to co-operate with HUAC.\\"Ceplair and Englund (2003), p. 388. Orson Bean recalled that he had briefly been placed on the blacklist after dating a member of the party, despite his own politics being conservative. During this same period, a number of influential newspaper columnists covering the entertainment industry, including Walter Winchell, Hedda Hopper, Victor Riesel, Jack O'Brian, and George Sokolsky, regularly offered up names with the suggestion that they should be added to the blacklist.Cohen (2004), p. 176. Actor John Ireland received an out-of-court settlement to end a 1954 lawsuit against the Young & Rubicam advertising agency, which had ordered him dropped from the lead role in a television series it sponsored. Variety described it as \\"the first industry admission of what has for some time been an open secret ‚Äì that the threat of being labeled a political non-conformist, or worse, has been used against show business personalities, and that a screening system is at work determining these [actors'] availabilities for roles\\".Doherty (2003), p. 236. The first Hollywood movie to overtly take on McCarthyism, Storm Center was released in 1956. Bette Davis \\"plays a small-town librarian who refuses, on principle, to remove a book called The Communist Dream from the shelves when the local council deems it subversive\\".Charity (2005), p. 1266. The Hollywood blacklist had long gone hand in hand with the Red-baiting activities of J. Edgar Hoover's FBI. Adversaries of HUAC such as lawyer Bartley Crum, who defended some of the Hollywood Ten in front of the committee in 1947, were labeled as Communist sympathizers or subversives and targeted for investigation themselves. Throughout the 1950s, the FBI tapped Crum's phones, opened his mail, and placed him under continuous surveillance. As a result, he lost most of his clients and, unable to cope with the stress of ceaseless harassment, committed suicide in 1959.Bosworth (1997), passim. Intimidating and dividing the left is now seen as a central purpose of the HUAC hearings. Fund-raising for once-popular humanitarian efforts became difficult, and despite the sympathies of many in the industry there was little open support in Hollywood for causes such as the Civil Rights Movement and opposition to nuclear weapons testing.Cohen (2004), pp. 187‚Äì188; Ceplair and Englund (2003), p. 345. The struggles attending the blacklist were played out metaphorically on the big screen in various ways. As described by film historian James Chapman, \\"Carl Foreman, who had refused to testify before the committee, wrote the western High Noon (1952), in which a town marshal (played, ironically, by friendly witness Gary Cooper) finds himself deserted by the good citizens of Hadleyville (read: Hollywood) when a gang of outlaws who had terrorized the town several years earlier (read: HUAC) returns.\\"Chapman (2003), p. 124. Cooper's lawman cleaned up Hadleyville, but Foreman was forced to leave for Europe to find work. Meanwhile, Kazan and Schulberg collaborated on a movie widely seen as justifying their decision to name names. On the Waterfront (1954) became one of the most honored films in Hollywood history, winning eight Academy Awards, including Oscars for Best Film, Kazan's direction, and Schulberg's screenplay. The film featured Lee J. Cobb, one of the best known actors to name names. Time Out Film Guide argues that the film is \\"undermined\\" by its \\"embarrassing special pleading on behalf of informers\\".Andrew (2005), p. 981. After his release from prison, Herbert Biberman of the Hollywood Ten directed Salt of the Earth (also 1954), working independently in New Mexico with fellow blacklisted Hollywood professionals ‚Äì producer Paul Jarrico, writer Michael Wilson, and actors Rosaura Revueltas and Will Geer. The film, concerning a strike by Mexican-American mine workers, was denounced as Communist propaganda when it was completed in 1953. Distributors boycotted it, newspapers and radio stations rejected advertisements for it, and the projectionists' union refused to run it. Nationwide in 1954, only around a dozen theaters exhibited it.Christensen and Haas (2005), pp. 116‚Äì117 (\\"screened in only eleven theaters\\"); Weigand (2002), p. 133 (\\"arranged showings of the film in only fourteen theaters\\"). Breaking the blacklist (1957‚Äìpresent) Jules Dassin was one of the first to break the blacklist. Although he was named by Edward Dmytryk and Frank Tuttle on spring 1951,Film Maker rues 10 years as a red, By C.P.Trussell, NY Times, 25.5.1951 he directed on December 1952 the Broadway Play Two's Company with Bette Davis. In June 1956, his French film production Rififi opened at the Fine Arts TheaterBosley Crowther, Hot Stuff, NY Times 10.6.1956 and stayed for 20 weeks. A key figure in bringing an end to blacklisting was John Henry Faulk. Host of an afternoon comedy radio show, Faulk was a leftist active in his union, the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists. He was scrutinized by AWARE, Inc., one of the private firms that examined individuals for signs of Communist sympathies and \\"disloyalty\\". Marked by the group as unfit, he was fired by CBS Radio. Almost alone among the many victims of blacklisting, Faulk decided to sue AWARE in 1957.Faulk (1963), passim. Though the case dragged through the courts for years, the suit itself was an important symbol of the building resistance to the blacklist. The initial cracks in the entertainment industry blacklist were evident on television, specifically at CBS. In 1957, blacklisted actor Norman Lloyd was hired by Alfred Hitchcock as an associate producer for his anthology series Alfred Hitchcock Presents, then entering its third season on the network.Anderson (2007); Lumenick (2007b). On November 30, 1958, a live CBS production of Wonderful Town, based on short stories written by then-Communist Ruth McKenney, appeared with the proper writing credit of blacklisted Edward Chodorov, along with his literary partner, Joseph Fields.Buhle and Wagner (2003a), p. 30. The following year, actress Betty Hutton insisted that blacklisted composer Jerry Fielding be hired as musical director for her new series, also on CBS.Burlingame (2000), p. 74. The first main break in the Hollywood blacklist followed soon after. On January 20, 1960, director Otto Preminger publicly announced that Dalton Trumbo, one of the best known members of the Hollywood Ten, was the screenwriter of his forthcoming film Exodus. Six-and-a-half months later, with Exodus still to debut, The New York Times announced that Universal Pictures would give Trumbo screen credit for his role as writer on Spartacus, a decision now recognized as being largely made by star/producer Kirk Douglas.Smith (1999), p. 206. On October 6, Spartacus premiered ‚Äì the first movie to bear Trumbo's name since he had received story credit on Emergency Wedding in 1950. Since 1947, he had written or co-written approximately seventeen motion pictures without credit. Exodus followed in December, also bearing Trumbo's name. The blacklist was now clearly coming to an end, but its effects continue to reverberate even until the present.\\"... the anti-communist frenzy of the 1950s ... crippled artistic and intellectual life in the US for decades. The film industry still suffers from the purge of left-wing and critical spirits.\\" wsws.org John Henry Faulk won his lawsuit in 1962. With this court decision, the private blacklisters and those who used them were put on notice that they were legally liable for the professional and financial damage they caused. This helped to bring an end to publications such as Counterattack.Fried (1997), p. 197. Like Adrian Scott and Lillian Hellman, however, a number of those on the blacklist remained there for an extended period ‚Äì Lionel Stander, for instance, could not find work in Hollywood until 1965.Belton (1994), p. 202. Some of those who named names, like Kazan and Schulberg, argued for years after that they had made an ethically proper decision. Others, like actor Lee J. Cobb and director Michael Gordon, who gave friendly testimony to HUAC after suffering on the blacklist for a time, \\"concede[d] with remorse that their plan was to name their way back to work\\".Navasky (1980), p. 280. Others were haunted by the choice they had made. In 1963, actor Sterling Hayden declared, > I was a rat, a stoolie, and the names I named of those close friends were > blacklisted and deprived of their livelihood.Buhle and Wagner (2003a), p. > 251. Scholars Paul Buhle and Dave Wagner state that Hayden \\"was widely believed to have drunk himself into a near-suicidal depression decades before his 1986 death\\". Into the 21st century, the Writers Guild pursued the correction of screen credits from movies of the 1950s and early 1960s to properly reflect the work of blacklisted writers such as Carl Foreman and Hugo Butler.Weinraub (2000); On December 19, 2011, the guild, acting on a request for an investigation made by his dying son Christopher Trumbo, announced that Dalton Trumbo would get full credit for his work on the screenplay for the romantic comedy Roman Holiday (1953), almost sixty years after the fact.Verrier (2011); The Hollywood Ten and other 1947 blacklistees The Hollywood Ten The following ten individuals were cited for contempt of Congress and blacklisted after refusing to answer questions about their alleged involvement with the Communist Party: *Alvah Bessie, screenwriter *Herbert Biberman, screenwriter and director *Lester Cole, screenwriter *Edward Dmytryk, director *Ring Lardner Jr., screenwriter *John Howard Lawson, screenwriter *Albert Maltz, screenwriter *Samuel Ornitz, screenwriter *Adrian Scott, producer and screenwriter *Dalton Trumbo, screenwriter In late September 1947, HUAC subpoenaed 79 individuals on a claim that they were subversive and the supposition that they injected Communist propaganda into their films. Although never substantiating this claim, the investigators charged them with contempt of Congress when they refused to answer the questions about their membership in the Screen Writers Guild and Communist Party. The Committee demanded they admit their political beliefs and name names of other Communists. Nineteen of those refused to co-operate, and due to illnesses, scheduling conflicts, and exhaustion from the chaotic hearings, only 10 appeared before the Committee. These men became known as the Hollywood Ten. Belonging to the Communist Party did not constitute a crime, and the Committee's right to investigate these men was questionable in the first place. These men relied on the First Amendment's right to privacy, freedom of speech, and freedom of thought, but the Committee charged them with contempt of Congress for refusing to answer questions. Later defendants ‚Äì except Pete Seeger ‚Äì tried different strategies. Acknowledging the potential for punishment, the Ten still took bold stands, resisting the authority of HUAC. They yelled at the Chairman and treated the Committee with open indignation, emanating negativity and discouraging outside public favor and help. Upon receiving their contempt citations, they believed the Supreme Court would overturn the rulings, which did not turn out to be the case, and as a result, they were convicted of contempt and fined $1,000 each (or, over $10,700 USD in 2016 dollars, when adjusted for inflation), and sentenced to six-months to one-year prison terms.Hollywood blacklist#ref Anone HUAC did not treat the Ten with respect either, refusing to allow most of them to speak for more than just a few words at a time. Meanwhile, witnesses who had arranged to co-operate with the Committee (such as the anti-Communist screenwriter Ayn Rand) were allowed to speak at length. Martin Redish suggests that at this time, the First Amendment's right of free expression in these cases was used to protect the powers of the government accuser(s), instead of the rights of the citizen-victims. After witnessing the well-publicized ineffectiveness of the Ten's defense strategy, later defendants chose to plead the Fifth Amendment (against self-incrimination), instead. Public support for the Hollywood Ten wavered, as everyday citizen-observers were never really sure what to make of them. Some of these men later wrote about their experiences as part of the Ten. John Howard Lawson, the Ten's unofficial leader, wrote a book attacking Hollywood for appeasing HUAC. While mostly criticizing the studios for their weakness, Lawson also defends himself/the Ten and criticizes Edward Dmytryk for being the only one to recant and eventually co-operate with HUAC. In his 1981 autobiography, Hollywood Red, screenwriter Lester Cole stated that all of the Hollywood Ten had been Communist Party USA members at some point. Other members of the Hollywood Ten, such as Dalton Trumbo and Edward Dmytryk, publicly admitted to being Communists while testifying before the Committee. When Dmytryk wrote his memoir about this period, he denounced the Ten, and defended his decision to work with HUAC. He claimed to have left the Communist Party before having been subpoenaed, defining himself as the \\"odd man out\\". He condemns the Ten's legal tactic of defiance, and regrets staying with the group for as long as he did.

He is currently the co-defensive coordinator and linebackers coach at University of North Carolina, a position he assumed in January 2018. Prior to that, he spent 14 years as an assistant coach in the collegiate ranks, including a stint at Auburn University where he was part of the 2010 National Championship team. Thigpen played as a linebacker at the University of North Carolina and thereafter was drafted by the New York Giants of the National Football League (NFL). He also played for the Barcelona Dragons of the World League of American Football (WLAF). Playing career Thigpen was born and raised in El Dorado, Arkansas. He played prep school football at Potomac High School in Dumfries, Virginia, where he was honored as a Parade All-American and Virginia Defensive Player of the Year. Thigpen was recruited to play college football at the University of North Carolina for head coach Mack Brown. Thigpen was a three-time All-ACC linebacker for the Tar Heels. He was co-captain of the 1992 team that went 9‚Äì3 and were Peach Bowl champions. Upon graduation, Thigpen played professionally for the New York Giants and Barcelona Dragons. Coaching career Thigpen began his coaching career as a UNC graduate assistant in 1998‚Äì1999 under Carl Torbush. He received his first full-time position the following season coaching linebackers at Tennessee State. In 2001‚Äì2002, he was hired by new head coach Urban Meyer as the cornerbacks coach and special team's coordinator at Bowling Green where he helped coach one of the Mid-American Conference's top defenses, leading the MAC in turnover margin in 2002. BGSU also finished second in the MAC in pass efficiency defense, while Thigpen's special teams also were impressive, blocking seven punts and one field goal. When Meyer went to Utah in 2003, Thigpen was hired by Ron Turner as the cornerbacks coach at the University of Illinois. He spent the following season as the linebackers coach for the Fighting Illini and was one of two assistants to keep their job when Turner was fired. Although new coach Ron Zook asked him to stay on the staff, Thigpen decided to take the same position at his alma-mater, North Carolina, for the 2005 season. In each of his four seasons at Chapel Hill he tutored UNC's leading tacklers, including Durell Mapp who came to Carolina as a walk-on and finished with the second most tackles in the ACC and now plays with the Green Bay Packers. Thigpen was selected by the Atlantic Coast Conference to attend the 2008 Minority Coaches Forum. On February 15, 2009, Gene Chizik announced Thigpen had been hired as the safeties coach at Auburn University. He will split responsibilities coaching the Tigers secondary with Phillip Lolley who was promoted to cornerbacks coach. After three season coaching the safeties, Thigpen took over as linebackers coach for the 2012 season. After Chizik was fired by Auburn following the 2012 season and Thigpen was not retained by new coach Gus Malzahn (who had previously worked alongside Thigpen under Chizik), he was hired to coach linebackers at the University of Tennessee for new head coach Butch Jones. Thigpen was a coach for Auburn when they won the 2011 BCS National Championship Game. Thigpen was named one of the nation's top 25 recruiters in 2007 and 2009 by Rivals.com and in 2011 by 247Sports.com, ESPN and Rivals.com. He was awarded the 2011 Scout.com/FOXSports.com SEC Conference Recruiter of the Year. In 2014, he was named Rivals.com National Recruiter of the Year for his work on the University of Tennessee class of 2014.https://footballrecruiting.rivals.com/content.asp?CID=1607994 Personal life Thigpen graduated with a bachelor's degree in political science from the University of North Carolina in 1993. He is married to the former Jacinda Webb and the couple have two daughters.

It grows in a rosette 4 to 6 cm in diameter with green or sometimes red leaves. It is native to south-east South Australia from the southern Fleurieu Peninsula south to Kangaroo Island. It grows in lateritic clay-sand, loam, or decomposed shale soils in open woodland. It flowers from April to May.Lowrie, A, and J. G. Conran. 2008. A review of Drosera whittakeri s. lat. (Droseraceae) and description of a new species from Kangaroo Island, South Australia. Telopea, 12(2): 147-165. It was first formally described by Johann Gottlieb Otto Tepper in 1892 from specimens he collected on the Fleurieu Peninsula. Earlier in 1882, Tepper sent a description and specimens to Ferdinand von Mueller, who labeled the plants as D. whittakeri var. aphylla, but never published the name. Its placement at the rank of species was controversial and several authors, including Raymond Hamet in 1907, John McConnell Black in 1924, and Allen Lowrie in 1989, have reorganized it below the species rank. Others have reduced it to synonymy with Drosera whittakeri. In 1991, Robert J. Bates made the case for recognition at the species rank, authoring the illegitimate name D. aphylla in the process, a name not based on the first validly published description. Recently, several authors have recognized the taxon at the subspecies or species rank, but others have still only recognized it as a part of the very variable single species D. whittakeri sensu lato. In a review of D. whittakeri and related species, Lowrie and John Godfrey Conran reestablished it at the species rank, arguing that the morphology is dissimilar enough from D. whittakeri that it requires its own species epithet. Lowrie and Conran note that D. praefolia is distinct from D. whittakeri (whose opposing characteristics presented in parentheses) by its white tubers (orange), leaves emerging after flowering (before flowering), and the ovate to obovate leaf shape (broadly spathulate), among other differences.

A connection to Gungahlin Drive forms the largest signalized and overpass intersection in Canberra, constructed during the Gungahlin Drive Extension works and opening in 2011.

History The J class entered service between July and October 1966 to provide as shunters for the Eastern Goldfields Railway from Perth to Kalgoorlie that was being converted to standard gauge. They were an evolution of the Victorian Railways Y class. One was scrapped in July 1986 with the remaining four sold in 1995 to Great Northern Rail Services and moved to South Dynon Locomotive Depot. They operated freight transfer and infrastructure trains under contract to National Rail. Following the cessation of Great Northern Rail Services in 2004, the 4 units were split up. J102 & J103 were sold to CFCLA and stayed in Melbourne. These 2 units were hired to Southern Shorthaul Railroad continued use as terminal shunters and infrastructure workings. J102 & J103 have since been purchased by SCT Logistics for use as shunters at their various terminals. J104 & J105 were sold to Freightlink, renumbered to FJ104 & FJ105, and moved to the Northern Territory as terminal shunters in Alice Springs and Tennant Creek.

Completed in 1826 as a worship space for four congregations, it is a well-preserved example of vernacular Federal architecture. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2008. Description and history The Union Meeting House is located on the east side of the rural village of Burke Hollow, on the north side of Burke Hollow Road east of the village's central intersection. It is a 1-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a gabled roof and clapboarded exterior. A three-stage square tower rises near the front of the roof, with a pilastered belfry stage topped by a narrow spire. The front facade is three bays wide, with a pair of entrances flanking a raised Palladian window. The entrances are each framed by pilasters and topped by corniced entablatures, and there are half-round fanlight windows above them, at the same level as the equivalent element of the central window. The interior retains many original 19th-century features, including box pews, and a pulpit placed at the front of the building instead of the more common rear. (omitting 7 photos that are part of the registration) The town of Burke was chartered in 1782 and first settled in the 1790s. Early religious meetings were typically held by itinerant ministers in private residences and barns, and there was early disagreement about which denomination an officially settled minister should belong to. Church and state were officially separated in Vermont in 1806. In 1825 a union committee was formed by local Baptist, Congregationalist, Methodist, and Universalist groups to oversee construction of this building, which was completed in 1826. All of the original congregations either died out or abandoned the building by 1870. The building, a good example of vernacular Federal period architecture, was included in Herbert Wheaton Congdon's important Old Vermont Houses, in which he described the evolution of meeting house forms in rural Vermont. Local philanthropist Elmer Darling established a trust fund for the building's restoration and maintenance on the 100th anniversary of its construction.

It was incorporated as the Village of Cranberry Lake in 1942 and was merged into Powell River in 1955 as that District Municipality was expanded. The settlement's original name derives from the lake of the same name, around which grew cranberries on the peat- rimmed shoreline. Because there was another Cranberry Post Office in British Columbia, the word \\"lake\\" was retained in the name of both post office and the village municipality although it has since been dropped since amalgamation into what is now the City of Powell River.

As a political organization, Litteraturselskapet Det Norske Samlaget works to promote the use of Nynorsk and the preparation and publication of books in Nynorsk. It is also responsible for several grants and awards such as the Nynorsk Literature Prize, the Melsom Prize (Melsom-prisen) established in 1922 through the endowment of shipowner Ferd. Melsom and the Blix Prize (Blixprisen) established through the Emma and Elias Blix Endowment. Since 1978 the Forlaget Det Norske Samlaget has been an independent, separately operating nonprofit foundation. This publishing organization publishes the magazine Syn og Segn, books, historical, biographical and literary works, youth and children's books, textbooks, dictionaries, scientific and popular scientific books in Nynorsk. History Fraktur script A small group of determined men came together in Christiania in 1868 and formed the Norwegian Samlaget. One of the founders and first chairman was Hagbard Emanuel Berner; he remained chairman until 1877. The formation of Norwegian Samlaget was a natural extension of the efforts to promote Landsm√•l as the predominant literary and official language of Norway. In 1929, Landsm√•l was renamed Nynorsk. This promotion of indigenous languages was a common movement over much of the Europe of that period. Iceland sponsored a form of Icelandic in opposition to the official Danish, Finns promoted use of Finnish in opposition to the official Swedish, Flemish was promoted in the Netherlands, Proven√ßal in the south of France and Slavic dialects proliferated to the east. The debate about a Norwegian language reformation had been in progress for years, and fifteen years earlier Ivar Aasen had put forward the idea of reconstituting the Norwegian folk language. Although efforts had previously been made toward organization in the 1860s, it had been heavy work, and they met a great deal of resistance. Vision Det Norske Samlaget vision is to provide an independent, cultural impact. As a publisher they strive to develop and sell high quality Nynorsk books and other publishing products. Core Activities include identification and promotion of the good Nynorsk authors and ready availability of quality books.Det Norske Samlaget vision References Category:Publishing companies of Norway Category:Companies based in Oslo Category:1868 establishments in Norway Category:Nynorsk ","title":"Det Norske Samlaget"},{"id":"21556305","text":"The Jerusalem Islamic Waqf is an Islamic religious trust (sometimes called an \\"Islamic Religious Endowments\\" organization) best known for controlling and managing the current Islamic edifices on and around the Temple Mount in the Old City of Jerusalem, including the Al-Aqsa Mosque and the Dome of the Rock. Some form or another of the waqf has governed access to the Haram esh-Sharif since the Muslim reconquest of the Kingdom of Jerusalem in 1187, with the latest version instituted by the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan after its conquest of the West Bank and East Jerusalem during the 1948 war. Accordingly, the King of Jordan currently supplies all of the funding needed to operate the waqf, which is in effect the civil administration for the holy site. Israel conquered the Old City of Jerusalem during the Six-Day War of June 1967. After the end of hostilities, Israel allowed the waqf to retain authority over the Temple Mount (Haram esh-Sharif). The waqf administration is headed by a director (or sometimes \\"director-general\\") who runs the civil administration for the holy sites. The Grand Mufti of Jerusalem is in charge of Islamic religious affairs at the site. The Supreme Muslim Council is the Islamic judicial body governing affairs under Islamic law within Israel. The Palestinian Authority has parallel organizations claiming interest in these same matters (i.e., the Ministry of Islamic Waqf at the Palestinian Authority, the Palestinian Authority Grand Mufti, or the Palestinian Supreme Fatwa Council), and those are not to be confused with those recognized by Israel, even if some of the same people hold both offices.
