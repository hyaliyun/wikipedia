She is said to have evidenced stigmata. Life A few months before Natuzza's birth at Paravati, near Mileto in Calabria, her father emigrated to Argentina to look for work and the family never saw him again. Maria Angela Valente, Natuzza's mother, took on all sorts of work to feed her numerous family. As soon as she was able, Natuzza (a diminutive of Fortunata, a common name in Calabria) tried to help her mother and brothers; she was therefore unable to go to school, and indeed never learned to read or write. In 1944 she married Pasquale Nicolace, a carpenter, and they had five children, but from quite an early age she was said to have had visions of Our Lord and Our Lady. There is a 10-volume bibliography on Natuzza by Prof. Valerio Marinelli, with many interviews where she explains these facts. The bibliography also has interviews with others who claim to have been healed by her prayers or to have received other graces. Natuzza became known for the appearance on her body of blood-coloured images and words around the time of Easter, and these caused her great psychological and physical pain. Some of the words were found to be Hebrew and Aramaic, which was strange because she could not read or write, even in her native Italian. For decades, devout Catholics from Calabria, then the rest of Italy, began coming to her to ask for advice and prayers, and to ask her for information about the souls of their relatives. On 13 May 1987 work began on building a shrine in Paravati dedicated to the Immaculate Heart of Mary, Refuge of Sinners, destined to be her home for the rest of her life and to provide accommodation for the elderly. This is still awaiting authorisation by the Archbishop of Mileto. Italian television crews came several times to interview her and in 1994 she published her autobiography. A documentary film about her was produced in 1987. In 2007 a special programme was broadcast about an entrepreneur from Calabria who had recovered from leukaemia, and he interviewed Natuzza. Fortunata Evolo was admitted to hospital on 29 October 2009, but almost immediately she was released, and died of renal failure on the morning of Sunday 1 November at the Immaculate Heart old people's home. The Church bells were ordered by the Parish Priest, Natuzza's spiritual director, to peal out for the Feast of All Saints. Thousands of Catholics came from all over Europe to pay their respects, and the cause for her beatification is expected to be started very soon. Reception Psychotherapist and skeptic Armando De Vincentiis has published an article claiming that Evolo may have suffered from painful bruising syndrome: In July 2019, a decree from Luigi Renzo, the bishop of Roman Catholic Diocese of Mileto-Nicotera-Tropea, ordered the suppression of the Immaculate Heart of Mary Refuge of Souls Foundation, which had been founded by Evolo.

She placed fourth in 1932, and was eliminated in the semi-finals in 1936. Originally from Connecticut, she moved to California at the age of seven because of her father's asthma. Although she was athletically active during her school days, she had only taken up hurdling three months prior to her 1932 appearance and both of her Olympic placings were disputed at the time. After the Olympics she married a minor league baseball player and auto mechanic, Joseph Kirin, and worked as a food manager at a Temple City, California high school. At the time of her death, she was considered the world's oldest living Olympic veteran. Early life Schaller was born in Manchester, Connecticut, to a Swiss father and an Italian mother. Her family left Connecticut when Simone was seven and moved to Monrovia, California, because of her father's asthma. She had one brother, born in Manchester, and two sisters, one born in Manchester and the other in California. Her father, originally a silk worker, began managing an orange grove. At Monrovia High School, she began participating in athletics, as well as volleyball, baseball and basketball. After her graduation she worked in an office and organized night basketball and softball leagues. She joined the Los Angeles Athletic Association in 1932 so that she could compete on the track team and met Aileen Allen, an Olympic diver in 1920, who encouraged her to try to make the Olympic team and coached her. Olympic career Schaller made the 1932 American delegation and competed at the 1932 Summer Olympics and finished a controversial fourth, behind Marjorie Clark. At the time, several people told her that they believed that she had finished in third place, but she never thought that it was true herself until seeing a picture of the finish in 1984. She had begun hurdling only three months prior to the games and had suffered a serious knee injury a week prior to her event. Schaller won the women's 100m hurdling event at the 1933 National Championships in Chicago. After that her athletic club did not sponsor its members to attend any track and field meets, except for local ones, so she stayed in shape playing basketball and baseball. In the former case she played in a league not sanctioned by the Amateur Athletic Union. When she contacted by a representative from the organization she was not playing, due to a sprained ankle, and claimed that she had only placed her name on the roster to enter the games for free. In 1936 her club began sponsoring its athletes to compete nationally again, although she required donations in order to afford to attend that year's Olympic Games. There she was eliminated after placing fourth in the semifinals after another disputed call. She had originally placed third in her heat, but the Italian team complained that Claudia Testoni had actually finished third and Schaller was then officially placed fourth, meaning she did not qualify for the final. Upon her return she, along with her teammates, were given the key to New York City by mayor Fiorello H. La Guardia. Later life and death Schaller married in 1937 to Joseph Kirin, an auto mechanic and player in minor league baseball's Illinois‚ÄìIndiana‚ÄìIowa League and stopped competing in athletics, although she did continue to play baseball and softball. She had two sons and a daughter and worked as a manager of food service at Temple City High School. In her later years, she took up tennis Schaller died at home on October 20, 2016, at the age of 104, of natural causes, and was believed to be the oldest living former Olympian.

As a player he represented the North China team as well as Chinese national team before he moved into management. As a coach he intermittently managed the Chinese national team for over twenty years. Since retiring from professional football, he became the Chinese Football Association president in April, 1988 and held on to this appointment until he retired in August, 1994. He briefly came out of retirement with his participation and promotion of the 2008 Summer Olympics. Playing career Starting his career with the Beijing team Nian Weisi was given the chance to be included in the newly formed North China team when the Beijing team and Tianjin team merged to play in the first fully national league in 1951. In March, 1952 he was considered a very promising young player and was selected into the national soccer training center despite already still being in school. Nevertheless, he would still develop as a footballer and was considered good enough to study in Hungary with the Chinese youth football team in April 1954. By 1957 Nian Weisi would be promoted to the senior side and take part in China's unsuccessful 1958 FIFA World Cup qualification. His footballer career however was cut short on October 31, 1960, when he sustained a broken left leg. Management career After his retirement he would begin his management career when he was given the chance to manage the national youth team. By 1963 he would quickly get promoted to the senior team, however with China not entering the Fifa World Cup and the Hunan football team looking for a new manager Nian Weisi would leave the national team. Nian Weisi would return in 1965, despite having China isolated from playing any major competitions; however, he did not let this haggle over the teams individual performances and always made brave team selections. When China started to reopened itself to the world, Nian Weisi had built a team that was able to compete in the 1976 AFC Asian Cup, where he led them to third in the competition, though he would leave shortly afterwards. He returned once more in 1978 to help China in the 1978 Asian Games, where he once again helped them to another third position and again left after the competition. In 1979, he was given a position at the Chinese Soccer Association; however, Nian Weisi would find himself returning to the national team again in 1980 to help them for the 1980 AFC Asian Cup. For the final time Nian Weisi was brought in to help China qualify for the world cup; however, his reign was to be unsuccessful as China crashed out in the group stages in qualifying. He would once more return to the Chinese Soccer Association and in 1989 he became president.

Life He was born at 34 Harley Street, London, on 13 March 1801. His father was John Denison of Ossington, a merchant in London, whose surname was originally Wilkinson, but as first cousin of William Denison of Kirkgate, Leeds, he was left the bulk of a large property on condition that he assumed the name of Denison and continued the business in Leeds. His father did this, and afterwards resided at Ossington, Nottinghamshire, before dying at 2 Portman Square, London, on 6 May 1820. His mother, his father's second wife, was Charlotte, second daughter of Samuel Estwick, M.P. for Westbury. John Evelyn Denison, speaker of the House of Commons, George Anthony Denison the archdeacon of Taunton, and Sir William Thomas Denison were his brothers. Edward Denison received his early education at Esher, and in 1811 entered Eton College. In 1818 he entered Oriel College, Oxford, where in 1822 he took a first class and his B. A. degree. He was elected a fellow of Merton College in 1826, proceeded M.A., and received ordination on 23 December 1827. After serving as curate at Wolvercote, near Oxford, and at Radcliffe on Trent in Nottinghamshire, he returned to Oxford and took charge of the parish of St. Peter, where he remained until his appointment to the see of Salisbury. He acquired some reputation while filling the office of select preacher before the university in 1834, but in 1835 strongly opposed the admission of dissenters to the colleges of Oxford. With the support of Lord Melbourne, and at the early age of thirty-six, he was consecrated bishop of Salisbury (16 April 1837), having on 5 April previously been created D.D. by his university. He immediately increased the number of Sunday services in the parish churches, and reformed the mode of conducting confirmations. When cholera broke out in Salisbury the bishop worked both as a religious teacher and as a sanitary reformer. He was a well-known advocate of the revival of the church's synodical powers, and in convocation displayed considerable resolution in furthering the movement. A good administrator, in his theological views he was always somewhat intolerant.

Plot Set in the world of Mindcraft's The Magic Candle, Siege is a castle- combat war game in which the player controls either the hordes of darkness (orcs, trolls, domugs, tekhirs, and the like) or the warriors of good (humans, dwarves, and elves), either attacking or defending one of four castles in Western Gurtex. The player manages elite troops, berserkers, sergeants, and engineers in the campaign, as well as various assault and defense machines (such as ballistae, burning oil, battering rams, mobile bridges, siege towers, assault ladders, and catapults)and magicians to hurl spells at the enemy. The game features 24 different scenarios, and comes with an editor to allow the players to make new scenarios, or modify those included. Reception Computer Gaming World in 1992 complimented Sieges \\"beautifully rendered\\" VGA graphics and scenario editor, and approved of it being the first game based on castle warfare. The magazine criticized the lack of detail in win conditions and a too-predictable AI opponent, but concluded that the game \\"is an all- around unique and engaging simulation ... If the computer AI had more of a cruel streak, the game would be outstanding\\". In a 1993 survey of pre 20th- century strategy games the magazine gave the game two-plus stars out of five.

During his time in office he served as a member of the Executive Council of Alberta serving various portfolios from 1978 to 1986. Political career Chambers ran for a seat to the Alberta Legislature for the first time in the 1971 Alberta general election. He won the new electoral district of Edmonton-Calder defeating incumbent Social Credit MLA Edgar Gerhart to pick up the electoral district for the Progressive Conservative party. The win would help the Progressive Conservatives form government in that election. Chambers ran for a second term in office in the 1975 Alberta general election. Despite Chambers losing a small portion of his popular vote, the opposition candidates running against him would see a significant vote drop, he was returned to office easily. Premier Peter Lougheed would appoint Chambers to his first ministerial portfolio on April 24, 1978. He served the remainder of his second term as Minister of Housing and Public Works. Chambers ran for re-election to a third term in the 1979 general election. Despite holding a ministerial portfolio his popular vote dropped for the second straight election. After the election he kept his portfolio for a second term. The 1982 Alberta general election would see Chambers win a significant increase in his popular vote, he would easily score the best popular vote of his political career. The opposition vote coalesced around New Democratic candidate Christie Mjolsness, forcing a hotly contested three-way race. After the election the Housing portion of his portfolio was split off and Chambers became Minister of Public Works, Supply, and Services. He would continue hold that portfolio after Don Getty became Premier in 1985. Chambers retired from provincial politics at dissolution of the Assembly in 1986.

The new school building boasted a number of modern amenities, along with a diverse set of curricular and extra- curricular activities. In particular, the building focused on student safety, becoming one of the first schools in the country to design each classroom with an external entrance. This inspired its early nickname, \\"The Safety First School\\", and inspired planners from across the country to incorporate similar design principles. The school's enrollment declined in the 1970s from a peak of more than 600 students.

History View to south to Kfar Szold View to north to Nebi Yahud and Tel Azaziat Givat AeEm, like other basalt hills in the eastern Hula Valley, was formed by a spurt of basalt stone during the formation of the Jordan Rift Valley. Israeli soldiers built a border outpost on Giv'at Ha'Em after the War of Independence. It was located directly across from Syrian positions on the slopes of the Golan Heights. Israeli troops on the hill were frequently involved in fire exchanges with Syrian troops who were shelling the farmers in the Hula valley.JPost Travel, A monumental north , by Aviva Bar-Am APC left from 1967 View of Tel Azaziat and Anti-Lebanon mountains Givat HaEm was the site of combat during the Six- Day War. The 8th Brigade, which was brought from the Sinai, and the Golani Brigade were deployed near Giv'at Ha'Em. The topographical conditions were very difficult: the steep, rugged and rocky slopes of the Golan prevented an easy build of a transportation line, while the Syrian army sat in well fortified strongholds and could fire easily from above. Nevertheless, it was from Giv'at Ha'em that Israel made its first advances into Syria. After two days of heavy bombardment by the Israeli Air Force, the breakthrough came at 10:00 on the morning of 9 June 1967. It was commanded by Albert Mandler's tank brigade 8, which showered the Syrian posts to the north, on the top of the Heights. In a complex engineering operation, soldiers from the Engineering Corps cleared the way of mines. They were followed by bulldozers which leveled a route for the tanks on the rocky face. During the battle, the 8th Brigade advanced toward the direction of Zaura and Qela, while traversing difficult terrain and meeting Syrian resistance; at the end of the battle, only two functioning tanks reached Qela. A force consisting of infantry, Nahal and paratroopers defeated a series of other posts overlooking the Hula valley in the southern sector of the Heights and enables the passage of tanks deep into enemy territory. The Golani brigade under the command of Colonel Yona Efrat advanced and captured the posts in Burj Babil, Tel Azaziat and Tel Faher. At Burj Babil, Syrian officers fled after the first Israeli shots were fired, prompting their men to do the same.Arabs at war: military effectiveness, 1948‚Äì1991, Kenneth M. Pollack, p.471 By contrast, the number of Syrian units that fought on in their positions even long after the Israelis had gained the upper hand was at least as great and probably greater, than those instances of units breaking at first contact. At Tel Azaziat, the officers tried to surrender their position to the Israelis but their men refused, firing on their officers and fighting the Israelis tooth and nail before being overwhelmed by tank fire and the flanking attack.Six days of war, Michael B.

Education Alhomayed received a Bachelor of Arts degree in media studies from King Abdul Aziz University in Jeddah. Career Alhomayed began his journalism career as a correspondent for Al Madina newspaper in Washington D.C. from 1998 to August 2000. He served as the Managing Editor of Asharq Alawsat in Saudi Arabia and head of the paper's Jeddah bureau from 2003 to 2004, before becoming Editor-in-Chief.

After British tabloid The Sun printed pictures of Saddam Hussein as a prisoner,\\"Sun defends Saddam prison photos \\". BBC News (May 21, 2005), accessed November 25, 2011.

It was reported around the world that Asharq Al Awsat had printed that picture on its front page.\\"More Photos Published of Saddam in Jail\\". Fox news (22 May 2005), accessed 25 November 2011. Alhomayed relied heavily on syndications with respected newspapers and news agencies to re-publish their stories; by crediting them, he took Asharq Alawsat a step ahead of common practice in the Middle East in terms of respecting intellectual property rights. Alhomayed launched several weekly supplements in Asharq Al Awsat, including Al Siyaha (Free Weekly Health Magazine), Alam Alriyadh (Free Weekly Sport's Magazine), Al Aqar (Real Estate), Azwak (Fashion and Style), Mazakat (Food Taste), Al Watar Al Sadis (Sixth String ‚Äì TV, Cinema and Songs), Al Elaam (Media), Al Muntada Al Thakafi (Culture Forum) and Hasad Al Usbo (Week Harvest). Alhomayed introduced the concept of an Ombudsman to the newspaper, meaning an anonymous editor who writes a weekly critique of the newspaper's performance under a column called \\"Al Muraqeb Al Sahafi\\" (Journalism Monitor). From 2004, Asharq Al Awsat's Ombudsman wrote extensively including a number of highly critical articles, but these came to a sudden stop. On 27 September 2010, nearly 4 years after the Ombudsman column was stopped, Alhomayed announced that the column would be continued, revealed for the first time that it was the late Ahmed Al Rabey (a famous Kuwaiti journalist) who used to write the column in its previous format, and explained that the column had stopped due to Al Rabey's illness and death.

Stalin's resolution: \\"Shoot all named in the list. ‚Äì J. St.\\" Between October 1940 and February 1942, in spite of the ongoing German attack on the Soviet Union in June 1941, the Red Army, in particular the Soviet Air Force, as well as Soviet military-related industries were subjected to purges by Stalin. Background The Great Purge ended in 1939. In October 1940 the NKVD (People's Commissariat of Internal Affairs), under its new chief Lavrenty Beria, started a new purge that initially hit the People's Commissariat of Ammunition, People's Commissariat of Aviation Industry, and People's Commissariat of Armaments. High-level officials admitted guilt, typically under torture, then testified against others. Victims were arrested on fabricated charges of anti-Soviet activity, sabotage, and spying. The wave of arrests in the military-related industries continued well into 1941. 1941 Purge In April‚ÄìMay 1941, a Politburo inquiry into the high accident rate in the Air Force led to the dismissal of several commanders, including the head of the Air Force, Lieutenant General Pavel Rychagov. In May, a German Junkers Ju 52 landed in Moscow, undetected by the ADF beforehand, leading to massive arrests among the Air Force leadership. The NKVD soon focused attention on them and began investigating an alleged anti-Soviet conspiracy of German spies in the military, centered around the Air Force and linked to the conspiracies of 1937‚Äì1938. Suspects were transferred in early June from the custody of the Military Counterintelligence to the NKVD. Further arrests continued well after the German attack on the Soviet Union, which started on June 22, 1941. Arrests * May 30: People's Commissar of Ammunition Ivan Sergeyev and Major General Ernst Schacht * May 31: Lieutenant General Pyotr Pumpur * June 7: People's Commissar of Armaments Boris Vannikov and Colonel General Grigory Shtern * June 8: Lieutenant General Yakov Smushkevich * June 18: Lieutenant General Pavel Alekseyev * June 19: Colonel General Alexander Loktionov * June 24: General Kirill Meretskov and Lieutenant General Pavel Rychagov * June 27: Lieutenant General Ivan Proskurov In wartime During the first months of the war, scores of commanders, most notably General Dmitry Pavlov, were made scapegoats for failures. Pavlov was arrested and executed after his forces were heavily defeated in the early days of the campaign. Only two of the accused were spared: People's Commissar of Armaments Boris Vannikov (released in July) and Deputy People's Commissar of Defense General Kirill Meretskov (released in September). The latter had admitted guilt, under torture.Michael Parrish. The Lesser Terror: Soviet State Security, 1939‚Äì1953. Westport, Conn: Praeger, 1996. . P. 71‚Äì76. About 300 commanders, including Lieutenant General Nikolay Klich, Lieutenant General Robert Klyavinsh, and Major General Sergey Chernykh, were executed on October 16, 1941, during the Battle of Moscow. Others were sent to Kuybyshev, provisional capital of the Soviet Union, on October 17. On October 28 twenty individuals were summarily shot near Kuybyshev on Lavrentiy Beria's personal order, including Colonel Generals Alexander Loktionov and Grigory Shtern, Lieutenant Generals Fyodor Arzhenukhin, Ivan Proskurov, Yakov Smushkevich, and Pavel Rychagov with his wife, as well as several individuals who had been previously arrested during the immediate aftermath of the Great Purge in 1939, prior to the Red Army Purge of 1941, including politicians Filipp Goloshchyokin and Mikhail Kedrov. In November, Beria successfully lobbied Stalin to simplify the procedure for carrying out death sentences issued by local military courts so that they would no longer require approval of the Military Collegium of the Supreme Court and Politburo for the first time since the end of the Great Purge. The right to issue extrajudicial death sentences was granted to the Special Council of the NKVD. With the approval of Stalin, 46 persons, including 17 generals, among them Lieutenant Generals Pyotr Pumpur, Pavel Alekseyev, Konstantin Gusev, Yevgeny Ptukhin, Nikolai Trubetskoy, Pyotr Klyonov, Ivan Selivanov, Major General Ernst Schacht, and People's Commissar of Ammunition Ivan Sergeyev, were sentenced to death by the Special Council. They were executed on the Day of the Red Army, February 23, 1942. Aftermath On February 4, 1942, Beria and his ally Georgy Malenkov, both members of the State Defense Committee, were assigned to supervise production of aircraft, armaments, and ammunition. Many victims were exonerated posthumously during de-Stalinization in the 1950s‚Äì1960s. In December 1953 a special secret session of the Supreme Court of the Soviet Union, itself without due process, found Beria guilty of terrorism for the extrajudicial executions of October 1941 and other crimes, and sentenced him to death.

The meltwater sands (Schmelzwassersande) of the advancing ice sheet covered the old terrain with outwash sands (Vorsch√ºttsande). Woldstedt (1955: 159) spoke about underlying sands that, in the \\"Cloppenburg-Bassum Geest\\", belonged to the Elster glaciation. A covering of boulder clay was deposited over the outwash sands during the Saale glaciation, or more precisely the Drenthe stage. A series of meltwater valleys characterises the surface of the Cloppenburg Geest, something that was vital to the emergence of the river network. \\"Numerous parallel, flat channels cross the terrain and so create a landscape of parallel ridges\\" writes Woldstedt (1955: 158). There are two opposing theories for the formation of the rivers. Hausfeld (1983; 1984) put their emergence down to large cracks in the Drenthe ice sheet, through which meltwaters flowed as the glacier thawed, cutting through the ground moraines and down into the outwash sands. Woldstedt (1956) spoke of channels (Rinnen) in another connexion. The advancing ice followed the depth contours, conserving and deepening them. When the ice sheet retreated, dead-ice (Toteis) remained deep in these channels; it was their thawing that then enabled the rivers to flow down their old valleys. During the marine regression of the Weichselian glaciation that ended about 12,000 years ago, in which the northwest German plain was not covered by ice, the rivers of the Cloppenburg Geest cut deeply into the valley sands. At that time the windborne and dune sands were formed especially as the area around the perimeter dried out. The climate of the post-glacial period was moister and warmer. The rise in sea level, the base level for river erosion, probably led to a rise in the water table in the geest depression (Roeschmann, 1971: 189). In the valleys vast fen peats formed, whilst on the valley edges and the larger basins raised bogs were formed (Hausfeld, 1983: 245).  References  * R.

Miner served as Mayor of Syracuse from 2010 to 2018, and is the first woman to have held that office. Prior to her mayoralty, she was a member of the Syracuse City Council. Miner co-chaired the New York State Democratic Party from 2012 to 2014. In 2018, Miner ran unsuccessfully for Governor of New York on the newly-created Serve America Movement line. Early life, education and career On April 30, 1970, Miner was born in Syracuse, New York to Edward Miner, MD, a physician and an army officer, and Dianne Cooney, a nurse who later served as dean of the Wegmans School of Nursing at St. John Fisher College. Miner became involved in politics at an early age by stuffing envelopes for local candidates at her grandmother's kitchen table in the Eastwood neighborhood. Miner attended high school in Homer, New York, where she was senior class president and voted most likely to succeed. She received her B.A., magna cum laude, in journalism and political science from Syracuse University in 1992, and her J.D. from the University at Buffalo Law School in 1999. In 1994, she served as a regional representative for then-governor of New York Mario Cuomo. Upon graduating from law school, Miner was hired at the Syracuse law firm Blitman and King LLP, where she worked until resigning in March 2009 to focus on her mayoral campaign. Early political career In her first run for public office in 2001, Miner ran for one of two at-large Syracuse Common Council seats that were up for election. She won, placing first among four candidates. Her tough leadership on important city issues propelled her to re-election in 2005 when she again placed first among four candidates for the two seats. Miner received the most votes of any candidate on the ballot, including the incumbent Mayor. As a Common Councilor, Miner championed and helped pass legislation that gave $1 million in initial funding to Say Yes to Education, a program that provides necessary support services for Syracuse City School Districts students and promises free or reduced college tuition to students who graduate from City high schools. Mayor of Syracuse In 2009, Miner‚Äîrunning as a Democrat‚Äîdefeated Republican Steve Kimatian, 50%‚Äì39%, in the general election and became the city's first female mayor. Miner was re-elected in 2013, winning 68% of the vote in defeating two third-party candidates. Miner was the 53rd Mayor of the City of Syracuse. She is the first woman elected Mayor of Syracuse and the first woman to lead one of New York's \\"Big 5\\" cities. Her second term concluded on January 1, 2018, and she did not seek re-election. Fiscal priorities Miner vetoed $2 million in amendments passed by the council to her $657 million budget. Miner stated that the council's sales tax estimates were \\"phantom revenues\\" which, if they materialized, should be saved. In 2014, Miner announced that since she took office in 2010, the city had reversed the general funds deficit trend and achieved an $8.4 million budget surplus in the fiscal year ending in 2012. In 2013, Miner was named one of the \\"trailblazing women in public finance\\" by Northeast Women in Public Finance and The Bond Buyer in recognition of her role in drawing attention to the fiscal plight of cities. =New York Times Op-Ed= Miner authored an op-ed in the New York Times on February 13, 2013 clearly stating she wanted to encourage Andrew Cuomo to launch a statewide conversation involving state and municipal leaders, unions and businesses in seeking solutions to rising pension costs and other burdens. =Opposition to Destiny USA tax breaks= In 2012, Miner announced that Congel did not plan to build a promised future Destiny USA expansion, including a hotel and more retail space. However, Miner added that Congel would not have to pay property taxes or PILOT payments on the Carousel Center expansion or the original mall for 30 years under the terms of a 2007 agreement forged by former Mayor Matt Driscoll. In 2014, Miner and County Executive Joanie Mahoney received a letter from Destiny signaling their intent to build a 252-room hotel. Destiny indicated it would be seeking new tax breaks from the Onondaga County Industrial Development Agency (OCIDA). Destiny officials were seeking an 18-year payment in lieu of taxes deal exempting the developer from County and City taxes on the new hotel. The new exemption would cost taxpayers approximately $20 million in tax revenue. Miner believed that any hotel construction to support the mall should be privately financed. Destiny received a 30-year break on local taxes after it promised to build a LEED Platinum, 39-story, 1,342- room \\"Emerald 5 ShowTel and Conference Center.\\" However, Destiny stated that they would not be building the hotel or the other amenities it promised, they were still legally entitled to its 30-year PILOT. =Pension-smoothing opposition= Miner is a vocal opponent of Gov. Andrew Cuomo's policies on pensions and financially distressed cities. Mayor Miner publicized Gov. Cuomo was failing to take charge of the issue and had offered cities an \\"accounting gimmick\\" called pension smoothing instead. Miner publicly broke with Cuomo on his proposal to stabilize rising pension costs earlier that year. Economic development Syracuse has seen an outmigration of jobs and people from the city center to the suburbs, resulting in vacant properties. Miner asked IBM to help the city understand, analyze, predict and therefore prevent increases in vacant residential properties with the goal of moving Syracuse towards data-driven interventions that prevent and reverse the decline of neighborhoods. Ideas and innovation In 2015, Miner established the first-ever Mayor's office of Innovation using a grant from Bloomberg Philanthropies. Miner was part of the Governing Institute Women in Government Leadership Program Class of 2015, a program that highlights the outstanding contributions of women currently in public office, and to encourage future generations of leaders. Infrastructure Miner attended the Clinton Global Initiative America Conference in both 2014 and 2015 to discuss infrastructure for cities and states. Miner also met with members of Congress and submitted testimony before the United States Senate and the New York State Legislature detailing the infrastructure needs of the City of Syracuse. Miner is a member of Rebuild New York Now, a coalition of construction trades, business owners, and elected officials. =Joint Schools Construction Board= Miner revamped the Joint Schools Construction Board in an effort to rebuild and remodel Syracuse City School District buildings. Four schools were totally renovated, and the project was authorized to include $300 million of individual projects at up to 15 schools. Mayor Miner served as chair of the board. =Syracuse Regional Airport Authority= Miner spearheaded the effort to develop the Syracuse Regional Airport Authority. Miner also opened a $60 million renovation for the airport in 2013. Occupy Syracuse Miner ordered Occupy Syracuse protestors to leave Perseverance Park on January 19, 2012,eaglenewsonline.com; Occupy Syracuse Eviction citing the lack of permits for permanent structures and the presence of flammable materials. New York State Democratic Party Co-Chair Miner served as Co- Chair of the New York State Democratic Committee from 2012 to 2014. Post- mayoral career On June 18, 2018, Miner announced that she intended to run for Governor of New York. According to The New York Times, Miner, \\"once an ally of Mr. Cuomo's, became something of an outlier in Democratic circles when she emerged as a vocal and persistent critic of the governor and his policies, beginning five years ago and culminating now in a direct challenge as he seeks a third term.\\" Miner \\"[planned] to run under the banner of an upstart new group, the Serve America Movement, which calls itself SAM (coincidentally sharing Miner's initials), formed by people disaffected by the existing party structure after the 2016 elections. She will be the group‚Äôs first candidate.\\" Miner circulated designating petitions to create a SAM Party in New York, and on August 21, her campaign announced that it had submitted over 40,000 petition signatures. On Election Day, Miner and running mate Michael Volpe received 55,441 votes (0.91%).https://www.elections.ny.gov/NYSBOE/elections/2018/general/2018Governor.pdf Personal Miner was married to John F.

Early life Maccari was born in Siena, in the Grand Duchy of Tuscany. He was a student of the Institute of the Fine Arts in Siena together with Tito Sarrocchi, working in sculpture and helping complete the Monumento Pianigiani in Siena.Dizionario degli Artisti Italiani Viventi: pittori, scultori, e Architetti, by Angelo de Gubernatis. Tipe dei Successori Le Monnier, 1889, Page 268. He later worked in the atelier of Luigi Mussini in Florence. There in 1864 he was commissioned by an English society to copy works of Bernardino Pinturicchio found in the Cathedral of Siena. Some of his first patronage came from works the Marquis Pieri-Nerli, who also commissioned him to paint frescoes of the four evangelists for a private chapel in his home in Quinciano, a hamlet in the comune of Monteroni d'Arbia. Maccari soon won a stipend to study in Rome, that also allowed him to travel through Italy. Mature Work in Rome Leonardo da Vinci Painting the Mona Lisa Among his first major oil canvases in Rome, Maccari painted Vittoria Colonna meditates on the Poetry of Michelangelo. Another canvas, Sira che sacrifica la propia vita for the padrona Fabiola won a medal at the Exhibition of Termini (Rome). Next, his canvas Un palpito del passato was awarded a gold medal at the Exposition of Parma. He painted two figures in the church of Santa Francesca Romana. He was commissioned a Deposition by the marchesa di Cassibile. From 1870 to 1873, he was active as a fresco artist decorating the interior of the church of the Sudario in Rome. He also painted the lunette above the tomb of the Lombardi in Campo Verano. He painted in tempera: Love crowning the three Graces At the 1878 Turin Exposition, he sent an oil canvas depicting The Deposition of Pope Silverius by Antonina, wife of Belisarius. The prize winning painting was purchased for the Civic Museum of Turin.Gubernatis, page 269-270 In 1863, Maccari painted Leonardo che ritrae la Gioconda (commonly translated Leonardo [da Vinci] painting the Mona Lisa) which won an award in 1865. In his home town Siena he decorated the Sala del Risorgimento in the public palace with frescoes that were well received by critics. Between 1882 and 1888 Maccari painted a series of frescoes depicting famous events in the history of the Senate of Ancient Roman at the \\"Sala Maccari\\" in the Salone d'Onore (Reception Hall) of Rome's Palazzo Madama, seat of the Italian Senate, amongst them his most famous work, Cicero Denounces Catiline (more on this canvas below).Sala Maccari description in Italian Senate website. Other walls include these depictions: *Appius Claudius Caecus led into the Senate where he will give a speech to convince the Romans to urge them to reject the humiliating peace conditions imposed by Pyrrhus of Epirus's ambassador, Cineas. Appius Claudius Caecus is led into the Curia Hostilia by his sons. 19th century painting by Cesare Maccari. *The elder senator, Marcus Papirius, bravely seated motionless confronts the Gauls occupying Rome after the Battle of the Allia. *Samnites trying to bribe Curius Dentatus to convince the Senate to make peace. *Marcus Atilius Regulus, who had been sent back to Rome after being captured by Carthage during the First Punic War, urges the Senate to reject the Carthaginian peace offer he was sent to deliver and even vows to return to Carthage as a prisoner, where he knows that he will be executed. Maccari designed and completed the frescoes for the cupola of the Basilica di Loreto, completed in 1890 to 1907, and which replaced the frescoes of Cristoforo Roncalli, from the second decade of the 17th century, which had badly deteriorated. The museum adjacent to the Basilica has the preparatory studies and paintings by Maccari. They depict events that led to the proclamation of the dogma of the Immaculate Conception in 1854. Museo Antico Santuario di Loreto, short description. In later life, Maccari became a lecturer at the Accademia di San Luca in Rome. He became paralyzed while he was working on the Palace of Justice in Rome in 1909 and as a result stopped working as an artist. Among his pupils were Cesare Bertolotti and Giuseppe Aureli. He died in Rome in 1919. Cicerone denuncia Catilina :See also: Catiline Orations Cicero Denounces Catiline (1888) Maccari's most famous work of art depicts Cicero's Oratio in Catilinam Prima in Senatu Habita, his first speech denouncing Catiline in the Roman Senate which drove him from the city (63 BC). Maccari has been praised for the way his paintings captured the description of events and how Catiline has been avoided by his fellow senators and sat alone while Cicero attacked him. On the other hand, his work has been criticized for some historical inaccuracy since he depicted the Senate meeting in the wrong place: the Senate actually met in the Temple of Jupiter Stator, not in the Senate House (Curia Cornelia). Cicero was 43 years old at the time but looks much older, and Catiline, who was two years older than Cicero, looks much younger than Cicero. The painting has been reproduced in many textbooks and histories of Rome, and its depiction of the Roman Senate has even influenced the presentation of the Senate of the Roman Republic in nonfiction books.

Revisado. Formulations Christine Schrammek Blemish Balm from 1960s BB creams come in a variety of different formulations. Because Korean companies focused initially on the Korean and East Asian markets, they are offered in a limited number of hues. Instead of offering multiple shades for different skin colors, most formulae are designed to oxidize to match the user's skin tone. The skin-whitening properties of the cream as sold in the Asian market are an important element in its popularity.Woo, Michelle. \\"Get Skin Like a Korean Soap Opera Star\\", OC Weekly, April 5, 2012. *For skin whitening, see Maclean's, January 11, 2012. The cream is promoted as a multi-tasker and all-in-one treatment, but Korean women mostly use it as an alternative to foundation, particularly those with Western formulations that tend to be too heavy for their tastes. The coverage is often mineral-based, and is intended to both cover and treat blemishes such as acne, sun spots, and age spots. Some brands claim anti-wrinkle, anti-inflammatory, and soothing effects for their products. Several contain hyaluronic acid and Vitamin C.

Gilbert based partly on his 1867 short story, Diamonds, and partly on episodes in the lives of William Dargan, an Irish engineer and railway contractor, and John Sadleir, a banker who committed suicide. It was written before any of his Savoy Operas with Arthur Sullivan. Despite an encouraging review in The Times, the piece was a failure. It was revived in 1872 and rewritten as Quits, but it fared no better. Background Gilbert described An Old Score as \\"my first comedy\\".Crowther, Andrew. Introduction to script of \\"An Old Score\\", accessed 10 September 2010 He had previously written more than a dozen stage works, and although they were all intended to be funny, they were in the styles of burlesques, extravaganzas, pantomimes and one-act farces, not full-length, character- driven \\"comedies\\"; and so the play represents part of Gilbert's move from being a humorist to being a dramatist. Gilbert adapted part of the story of the play from his 1867 short story Diamonds.See excerpts from Diamonds attached as an appendix to the annotated script for An Old Score, p. 72, accessed 1 November 2009 It is also based partly on episodes in the lives of William Dargan, an Irish contractor, and John Sadleir, a banker who committed suicide in 1856.Trutt, David. Appendix to the annotated script for An Old Score, p. 83, accessed 1 November 2009 The play was written before Gilbert had developed his \\"Topsy-Turvy\\" satiric style and so shows Gilbert at his most straightforward. Gilbert was a disciple of the playwright T. W. Robertson, who had introduced naturalistic staging and acting to Victorian era theatre. Robertson's comedies had serious moments, as well as comic, treating their themes with some sentiment and usually conveying a simple moral lesson. Gilbert likewise intended An Old Score to be partly serious, calling it a \\"comedy-drama\\". The play borrows elements from Robertson's Ours and Tom Taylor's Still Waters Run Deep. Gilbert had provided another work for John Hollingshead's Gaiety Theatre in London, Robert the Devil (1868), which had opened the theatre.Stedman, p. 62 An Old Score opened at the Gaiety on 26 July 1869. The cast included Rosina Ranoe, who later married F. C. Burnand, and Henry Neville, who later produced some of Gilbert's plays.Ainger, p. 82 Following the Victorian tradition of long evenings in the theatre, An Old Score, which ran for two hours, was second on a triple bill beginning with an operettaHollingshead, John. Gaiety Chronicles, London: Archibald Constable, 1898 and ending with a \\"new opera bouffe\\", Columbus!, or the Original Pitch in a Merry Key, by Alfred Thompson. It was not a success, despite encouraging reviews, and closed in late August after about 24 performances.Stedman, p. 74Moss, Simon. \\"An Old Score\\" at Gilbert & Sullivan: a selling exhibition of memorabilia, c20th.com, accessed 16 November 2009 It reopened on 11 November 1872 at the Court Theatre in revised form as Quits but did not fare much better, running for about 46 performances.Shepherd, Marc. \\"Three Gilbert Plays in New Editions\\", University of Michigan Girls and Boys, vol. 36, no. 1, issue 229, p. 13, Summer 2005Hollingshead, John.

Review of An Old Score, The Times, 28 July 1869, p. 10 Commenting on its opening night reception by the audience, the paper noted, \\"An Old Score was followed by every symptom of success, and if its good fortune does not prove permanent it will be because the work is too genuine a comedy to suit the taste of the age.\\" When Gilbert originally proposed the play to Hollingshead, the manager of the Gaiety Theatre, the latter was impressed by its \\"clever dialogue\\". After its failure, however, Hollingshead opined that the piece had \\"one great and only fault: It was 'too clever by half.' It was too true to nature ‚Äì disagreeable nature. It was not served up with enough make-believe sauce.\\"Hollingshead, John. Good Old Gaiety, London: Gaiety Theatre Company, 1903 Hollingshead noted that, in the play, a son argues with his father. This was unacceptable to audiences in 1869. Gilbert expert Andrew Crowther writes that, although the play has faults, \\"we can judge An Old Score to be a genuinely powerful drama. There are scenes in this play which are so powerful that they knock the reader back in his seat. There is a \\"shooting-from-the-hip\\" quality about some of the scenes which is exhilarating and even just a little bit shocking.\\" It may be, also, that the play was too intimate for the huge stage of the Gaiety.Stedman, p. 73 The play was published in 1869 by Samuel French Ltd.,An Old Score at OpenLibrary.org in 1870 by Thomas Hailes Lacy and again in 1877 by Samuel French Ltd.Sir William Schwenk Gilbert at Books and Writers website, accessed 1 November 2009 Roles and original cast *Colonel Calthorpe ‚Äì Samuel Emery *Harold Calthorpe (his son) ‚Äì John Clayton *James Casby (a Bombay merchant) ‚Äì Henry Neville *Parkle (an attorney) ‚Äì Mr. Maclean *Manasseh (a bill discounter [a comic Jewish money lender]) ‚Äì J.

The Colonel, formerly a man of means, had paid for Casby's schooling and helped him find his first job, and so the Colonel believes that Casby owes him a large debt a gratitude. The Colonel is angry that Casby, while acknowledging the Colonel's help, has not agreed to give him the money to pay his now-substantial debts (although Casby cryptically states that he will satisfy the debt in another way). Ethel, however, is in love with her cousin Harold Calthorpe, who lives an extravagant lifestyle. Harold, in turn, loves Mary Waters, a nursery governess. He leaves his father's house because Mary is cruelly dismissed from her post and vows to marry her. ;Act II In Harold's chambers, Mary and Harold are not yet married. He is well paid for writing scandalous articles for The Tormenter, a journal, but he is morally disturbed by doing this and turns to drink. Casby and Ethel ask him to return home to his father, but Harold refuses. Colonel Calthorpe then arrives in good spirits, having just inherited some money and a title from a relative, Lord Ovington. He offers to forgive Harold, but Harold still loves Mary and confronts his father with his disreputable action towards her. He refuses to return home. ;Act III Since the Colonel is now the new Lord Ovington, Casby is no longer an eligible match for his niece, Ethel. The Colonel encourages Casby to break off the engagement, which does not bother Ethel much, since she still loves Harold and never loved Casby. Harold has gone missing, and Mary arrives looking for him. Mary and Ethel find some common ground in this misfortune and strike up a friendship. Casby now aims to settle his old score with Lord Ovington and goes to see him. He notes that Ovington's acts in helping him as a youth were entirely self-interested, because Ovington needed to do so to reverse his previous reputation for cruelty while in the army. By taking this apparently philanthropic action, Ovington had won the hand of a wealthy lady. Nevertheless, Casby is indeed grateful for the help. He reveals some notes on which Ovington had forged Casby's name as guarantor to several loans: Casby has now paid these on Ovington's behalf and further notes that he will not expose Ovington as a forger and has therefore freed Ovington from the threat of prison. So, they are now even (as Casby says, they are \\"quits\\"). Ethel, concealed, sees this interview, which makes her love Casby and forget her feelings for Harold, who has now been found and who can now marry Mary.

Completed in 1952, the house \\"was perhaps Ossipoff's most intricate as well as his most widely publicized domestic commission.\\"Sakamoto 2007, p. 115 After it was featured in House Beautiful magazine as a Pace Setter House in 1958, it attracted hundreds of visitors in organized weekly tours.Sakamoto 2007, p. 118 It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2008. The Owners Howard Liljestrand was the son of missionaries to Sichuan, China, where he had been raised. After completing medical degrees in the United States, he and Betty arrived in Hawaii in 1937 en route to China. However, the chaos that followed the outbreak of the Second Sino-Japanese War earlier that year convinced them to pause in Honolulu, where both found employment at The Queen's Medical Center. Eventually they decided to settle in the Islands, build a home, and raise a family. It took the Liljestrands until 1946 to find the perfect spot: on a secluded hillside, but within easy reach of work, school, and town. Howard had enjoyed youthful summers in China at a mountain retreat, and he and Betty often roamed the wooded ridge christened Tantalus by Punahou School students. Other prime hillside communities near town were already crowded, but Tantalus was still sparsely settled forest reserve land, lacking city water lines, and the few lots available were not very expensive. During one of their hikes in 1946, Howard and Betty found the perfect spot-- along with its elderly owner enjoying the view. After they became better acquainted, Mr. Coulter offered to sell them the parcel of land for $2000, even though they offered him twice the price. Then the couple went looking for the perfect architect to build a home for them on that site, and found him in Vladimir Ossipoff. The House The Liljestrands presented Ossipoff with demanding requirements, while the topography and highly variable daily weather conditions--sun, wind, and rain--imposed further constraints. The house is on two terraces, with the carport, entrance, and main part of the long, narrow house on the uphill terrace, and a lower story opening onto the downhill terrace. On a third, lower tier is a swimming pool. The upper side of the house is well sheltered from frequent mountain showers, while low-lying wooden louvers draw cooling breezes toward the larger openings on the side facing downhill. A long, open-sided recreation room extends beneath the bedrooms and faces onto a wide lawn. The large master bedroom at one end is angled to preserve an old stand of eucalyptus trees, and a sharp, wraparound deck juts out from the living room end of the house, overlooking the pool, the treetops, and a wide expanse of the city and the leeward side of the island stretching into the distance. Every room has a view.Sakamoto 2007, p. 162 The house is made of wood frame with retaining walls of concrete block in support. Large glass windows under overhanging eaves combine with carefully placed partitions to provide both shade and filtered daylight. Interior walls of redwood are bleach-stained to mute the color and highlight the grain. The staircase, built-in cabinets, countertops, and several pieces of furniture were fashioned from the fine wood of a single, large monkeypod tree. The open-beamed ceiling adds to the spaciousness of the living rooms, while a sandstone fireplace with copper hood lends a simultaneous feel of coziness. The exterior landscaping was designed by the noted landscape architects, Robert and Catherine Thompson, who were friends of the family, and the house has been carefully maintained by the architect, Bob Liljestrand, the eldest son of the original owners.

He was born in Antwerp and worked for some time in Genoa in Italy before returning to Antwerp. Here he continued his artistic and commercial activities. He is known for his landscapes and genre scenes.Lucas de Wael at the Netherlands Institute for Art History Life Lucas de Wael was born into an artistic family in Antwerp as the son of the painter Jan de Wael I (1558-1633). His mother Gertrude de Jode came from a family of artists: her father was the cartographer Gerard de Jode and her brother was the engraver Peter de Jode I. Although his date of birth has traditionally been given as 3 March 1591 he was baptized 7 September 1591, which may indicate he was born closer to the latter date. He first studied with his father and was then likely a pupil of Jan Brueghel the Elder.Jetty E. van der Sterre. \\"Lucas de Wael. Grove Art Online. Oxford Art Online. Oxford University Press. Web. 26 November 2019 Extensive wooded landscape with villagers dancing and making music by a river Lucas possibly travelled to France and Italy at a young age. During this trip he may have stayed in Paris and in Venice with his uncle Ferdinand van den Eynden, an art collector, art dealer and merchant residing in Venice at the time. His younger brother, Cornelis de Wael (1592‚Äì1672), accompanied him when he travelled to Italy likely around 1619. They spent time first in Genoa and then in Rome where they came into contact with the members of the Bentvueghels, an association of mainly Dutch and Flemish artists working in Rome. The brothers likely did not become members of the Bentvueghels. In 1627 Cornelis became a member of the Accademia di San Luca, the prestigious association of artists in Rome which had very strict admission criteria.Alison Stoesser, Lucas and Cornelis de Wael: Flemish artists in Antwerp, Genoa and Rome in the seventeenth century, vol. 1: Text, unpublished doctoral dissertation [2008]Lukas de Waal biography in: Arnold Houbraken, De groote schouburgh der Nederlantsche konstschilders en schilderessen (1718) Genoa was at the time an attractive destination for artists since the competition between artists there was less intense than in the leading cultural centres Rome, Florence and Venice, while Genoa was a thriving port city where a large number of potential customers and collectors lived.Anversa & Genova: een hoogtepunt in de barokschilderkunst River landscape with fishermen and travellers, collaboration between Lucas and Cornelis de Wael The workshop of the brothers de Wael in Genoa became the centre of the colony of Flemish artists who resided in or passed through the city. These Flemish artists could take advantage of the work and artistic activity that their workshop attracted. The brothers provided a home, materials and tools, they assisted their compatriots with their local integration, passed on recommendations to clients and formulated competition rules.Wael, Cornelis in: the Enciclopedia online of the Prado Museum Some Flemish artists visiting Genoa became their collaborators. This is the case of the marine painter Andries van Eertvelt who is documented in Genoa from 1628‚Äì1630, where he lived with de Wael and became his collaborator.A. Orlando, Van Dyck e i suoi amici. Fiamminghi a Genova 1600-1640, Genova, Palazzo della Meridiana, Sagep, Genoa 2018 When Anthony van Dyck visited Genoa, he stayed with the brothers. While it was formerly believed that Cornelis was one of van Dyck's closest collaborators in the city, recent scholarship has suggested that it is more likely that this role was played by the Flemish painter Jan Roos whom van Dyck got to know through the de Wael workshop. Van Dyck painted a Portrait of the brothers de Wael (Pinacoteca Capitolina, Rome) that was later engraved by Wenceslas Hollar. The Flemish painter Jan Brueghel the Younger stayed with the brothers de Wael in Genoa from October until December 1622. The brothers were also involved in trading activities with their hometown dealing in a wide variety of goods. Lucas returned to Antwerp in 1628. He was registered in the records of the Antwerp Guild of Saint Luke as a landscape painter in the guild year 1627‚Äì1628.Ph.

Work Lucas was mainly a painter of landscapes, vedute and genre scenes. Most of his work consists of landscapes and port scenes with ships. Only one signed work of his has been found, which makes attribution difficult. In many of Lucas' paintings his brother Cornelis added the figures while, in turn, Lucas painted the landscapes in Cornelis' battle scenes and harbour views. The View of a Roman square (At Minerva Auctions sale in Rome on 26 May 2016, lot 97) and the River landscape with fishermen and travellers (At Bonhams on 9 July 2008 in London, lot 38) have been attributed to the brothers.Lucas de Wael, Veduta di una piazza romana at Minerva Auctions Cornelis de Wael (Antwerp 1592-1667 Rome) & Lucas de Wael (Antwerp 1591-1661), An extensive river landscape at Bonhams on 9 July 2008 in London, lot 38 Lucas also collaborated with Jan Brueghel the Younger on paintings of landscapes with figures for which Lucas created the landscape part and Brueghel the figures.

Prior to World War II, William & Mary tried to become a formidable NCAA Division I athletics power despite its small size (approximately 1,500 students attended the school in the late 1930s). Although the school had always been known as a top tier liberal arts university, pressures to be as equally successful in sports‚Äîespecially football, men's basketball and baseball‚Äîhad been mounting for over a decade by the time the scandal was discovered in 1951. The scandal In 1946, the William & Mary Board of Visitors announced their goal of achieving more contest wins than losses. Rube McCray, the head football coach from 1944‚Äì1950, was given a substantial pay raise so that consistently winning teams could be produced. As a side effect of this decision, almost all of the college's scholastic financial aid was given to athletes coming into William & Mary, despite some of them having minimal academic qualifications. The football program was initially successful after World War II with the influx of veterans, but in order to continue the success, members of the athletic department found it necessary to modify players' high school transcripts to get them admitted to the college. Later, football players were given credit and grades for summer school classes they never attended. McCray, who jointly served as the school's athletic director and head football coach, acknowledged that the problems were on \\"his watch,\\" but said he had nothing to do with altering any players' transcripts. Throughout the entire time of the changes, circa 1947‚Äì1950, none of the players knew their grades or transcripts had been changed. An initial investigation in late 1949 by the college's registrar J. Wilfred Lambert, who also was Dean of Students, discovered the transcript altering, but could not determine the culprits. Players, at the time, did not realize there were any problems. After Lambert's report to the college's president, the procedure for handling transcripts of athletes was completely revised. No action was taken against anyone in the athletic department. From 1940 to 1949, the William & Mary Indians football teams were more dominant than any other era in the program's history. The 1942 team, under head coach Carl Voyles (1939‚Äì1944), compiled a 9‚Äì1‚Äì1 overall record and defeated perennial football powerhouse University of Oklahoma, 14‚Äì7, in Norman. In several of the seasons after the war they were ranked in the national top 20\\\\. They also routinely played the country's top teams, even managing to tie the 3rd-ranked North Carolina in 1948. Twenty-four total players were drafted to the National Football League (NFL), some of whom went on to have highly successful professional careers. The Indians won two Southern Conference championships and played in their first two bowl games on January 1, 1948 and January 1, 1949. Some of the football success in the years after 1946 can be attributed, in part, to gaining some good athletes through false transcripts. Repercussions In February 1950, William & Mary joined the NCAA and some faculty believed the school's athletic admissions standards would not be in compliance with the national standards. Nelson Marshall, dean of the college, began an investigation and uncovered a variety of issues including giving grades to football players who had not taken the classes. He reported his findings to William & Mary President John Pomfret in April 1951 and also to the school's board of visitors. Pomfret was reluctant to act swiftly because of promises made to McCray and the men's basketball coach, Barney Wilson. Pomfret had even recommended that McCray become a full-time physical education professor despite the evidence of his wrongdoing. Information regarding the scandal was leaked to the press, and shortly thereafter it had become a lead story in many national media outlets. There were many discussions among board members, between Pomfret and the board, and between Pomfret and the coaches. Within several days both McCray and Wilson resigned. The public exposure caused a rift between the Board of Visitors and the college faculty. The faculty maintained that their \\"control of all phases of intercollegiate athletics\\" was required by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools to maintain membership. Pomfret resigned amid the turmoil and was replaced by a non-academic naval officer, Alvin Duke Chandler. In protest to this hiring, because the board of visitors did not allow the faculty any participation in the presidential search, several faculty members and the dean of the college resigned. As a result the athletic program at William & Mary dramatically changed. From 1951 through 1954 the teams were competitive even though in 1953 there were only 24 players on the team. But the \\"big time\\" football years were gone forever because the faculty would never let anyone forget about how the school's academics had been tainted. Starting in 1955, the football team began losing more games than it won. Between 1955 and 1964, the Indians failed to yield a single season with a .500 record or better. The teams turned around under coaches Marv Levy and Lou Holtz from 1964 through the rest of the 1960s, but the scandal had done its damage. Historical context The William & Mary scandal of 1951 occurred during a time in American college history that was unique among all other periods. Colleges across the United States were starting to feel pressures to succeed on the field (or court) as well as in the classroom. William & Mary's was not the first academic-athletic scandal to surface; for example, the United States Military Academy (Army) football team had been involved in academic cheating and some of the players, including the coach's son, were forced to leave the school. The emphasis on athletics over academics had now become a major point of discussion among college and university governing bodies. William & Mary, which was the first college in the nation to establish an honor code, was an especially apt example of the pressures that universities faced when dealing with their athletics programs. These scandals had brought to light the issues at hand, and a refocus on academics, not athletics, had resulted.

On its northern slopes is the village of K√∂terberg.  Geography  View of the K√∂terberg from Holzminden The K√∂terberg is located in the centre of the Weser Uplands, towering high above the surrounding land northwest of the town of H√∂xter and south-southeast of L√ºgde within whose municipal area its summit lies. Its peak and much of the crest lie within North Rhine-Westphalia. Only a very narrow tongue of land belongs to Lower Saxony, albeit reaching to the summit with its lower reaches lying mainly within the valley of a stream. At the western end of this strip of land the districts of Lippe, H√∂xter and Holzminden meet at the summit. In the German Main Triangulation Network (Deutsches Hauptdreiecksnetz or DHDN) the K√∂terberg is a major triangulation station with the name L√ºgde, K√∂terberg. The area of the summit is only wooded to the north which is why the hill is easy to recognise from afar and offers good views (see below).  Geology  The K√∂terberg is part of the Lippe Uplands a region whose basis is formed by Mesozoic strata of Muschelkalk and Keuper. The hills itself is built on sandstones and marls of the Upper Keuper.  History  Summit signs on the K√∂terberghaus The K√∂terberg was already being mentioned in Lippe's boundary deeds in the 16th century. The Brothers Grimm called it the G√∂tzenberg in their German Legends (Nos. 9, 20), because it was here that folk prayed to the gods of the heath. The K√∂terberg was also the setting for their fairy tale The Three Little Birds. Between 1796 and 1801 Karl Ludwig von Lecoq incorporated the Keutersberg as a triangulation point in his military-topographical surveys. In 1831/32 the first solid structure appeared on the highest point of the hill: a 15¬Ω-foot (4.9 m) high tower as a category 1 triangulation mark. The K√∂terberg was a station in the Prussian semaphore system, which acted as a communication link between Berlin and Koblenz from 1832 to 1849. Since 1929 the K√∂terberghaus has stood on the summit. Two signs on the K√∂terberghaus give the height of the K√∂terberg, incorrectly, as 500 m AMSL. This error is often repeated in the advertising. Since 1971, a telecommunication tower has stood on the summit. Today the K√∂terberg is sometimes referred to jokingly as Monte Wauwau. Both \\"K√∂ter\\" (\\"mutt\\") and \\"Wauwau\\" (\\"bow-wow\\") are vernacular terms for a dog.  Telecommunication tower  The telecommunication tower (a 'standard' tower; 100 m or 330 ft high) on the summit of the K√∂terberg was built in 1971 by the Deutsche Bundespost and handles wireless telephone traffic. The three different antenna towers on the hilltop are microwave radio relay stations, used for police, fire service and amateur radio relays as well as Bundeswehr communications. The 70 cm amateur radio relay station, DB0KB, works on a frequency of 439.425 MHz. The relay coupling (Relaiskopplung) is out of service. The U.S. Army Communications Engineering and Installation Agency (USACEIA) installed a transmission and radio facility here from May 1984 to May 1985.  Field of view  Because the extensive summit plateau on the K√∂terberg, which can be accessed via a cul-de-sac road from L√ºgde- K√∂terberg, is almost unforested, it has easily the best all-round views, not just of the border region of the above-mentioned federal states, but for example even as far as the Habichtswald and Kaufungen Forest in Northe Hesse and to the Harz mountains that stretch across Lower Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt and Thuringia. View from the summit towards the south Road to the top The landmarks that can be seen include: * Biesterfeld to the northwest * Desenberg near Warburg * the Harz mountains including the Brocken * Holzminden * the Kaufungen Forest * H√∂xter * the High Habichtswald including the Hercules monument * the Eggegebirge including the Externsteine * the Teutoburg Forest including the Hermannsdenkmal As a result of the good views and especially its open isolated location, in both respects similar to the Brocken in the Harz, the K√∂terberg gives the impression of being the highest point in the Weser Uplands, although the Solling is actually higher in four places (Gro√üe Bl√∂√üe, Gro√üer Ahrensberg, Moosberg and Vogelherd). The hills of the Solling are however all heavily wooded, very nondescript and, from a distance, indistinguishable. The K√∂terberg is therefore known as the \\"Brocken of the Weser Uplands\\".  Tourism  In the summer months many bikers often meet on the summit at weekends to chit-chat which results in a considerable number of motorbikes in the car park. Likewise, keen cyclists also ride up the K√∂terberg. The road between the village of K√∂terberg and the summit has a maximum gradient of 14%. Radio hams use the peak because of it is an excellent site for transmission and reception. In the K√∂terberghaus is a restaurant.

Chemical restraint is used in emergency, acute, and psychiatric settings to reduce agitation, aggression or violent behaviours; it may also be used to control or punish unruly behaviours. Chemical restraint is also referred to as a \\"Psychopharmacologic Agent\\", \\"Psychotropic Drug\\" or \\"Therapeutic Restraints\\" in certain legal writing. In the UK, NICE recommends the use chemical restraint for acute behaviour disturbances, but only after verbal calming and descalation techniques have been attempted. It is viewed as superior to physical restraint, with physical restraints only being recommended for the administration of a chemical restraint. In the United States, no drugs are presently approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use as chemical restraints. Drugs that are often used as chemical restraints include benzodiazepines, antipsychotics, and dissociative anesthetics such as ketamine. A systematic review in 2019 advised the use of intravenous haloperidol (a short half-life, first-generation antipsychotic) alone or in conjunction with lorazepam or midazolam (short half-life benzodiazapines), but said more research was needed. The Human Rights Watch wrote a report on the use of chemical restraints amongst the elderly in the US. It concluded that antipsychotic drugs are sometimes almost by default to control difficult to manage residents. The FDA estimates 15,000 elderly individuals in nursing homes die each year due to the unnecessary use of anti-psychotics. According to the Nursing Home Reform Act, individuals have the right to be free from physical or chemical restraints imposed for purposes of discipline or convenience and not required to treat the resident's medical symptoms. The use of chemical restraint has been criticized. It is sometimes misused by health care workers for the convenience of the staff rather than the benefit of the patient, with workers using them to prevent patients from resisting care rather than improving the health of the patient; it can cause more confusion in patients, slowing their recovery; and it can be unclear whether drugs that used for chemical restraint are necessary to treat an underlying mental health condition or whether they are being used to sedate the patient. Patients can view chemical restraint as a violation of integrity and the experience and find the experience traumatic.

The two worst crises of this period were the 1973 oil crisis and the 1979 energy crisis, when the Yom Kippur War and the Iranian Revolution triggered interruptions in Middle Eastern oil exports. The crisis began to unfold as petroleum production in the United States and some other parts of the world peaked in the late 1960s and early 1970s. World oil production per capita began a long-term decline after 1979. The major industrial centers of the world were forced to contend with escalating issues related to petroleum supply. Western countries relied on the resources of countries in the Middle East and other parts of the world. The crisis led to stagnant economic growth in many countries as oil prices surged. Although there were genuine concerns with supply, part of the run-up in prices resulted from the perception of a crisis. The combination of stagnant growth and price inflation during this era led to the coinage of the term stagflation. By the 1980s, both the recessions of the 1970s and adjustments in local economies to become more efficient in petroleum usage, controlled demand sufficiently for petroleum prices worldwide to return to more sustainable levels. The period was not uniformly negative for all economies. Petroleum-rich countries in the Middle East benefited from increased prices and the slowing production in other areas of the world. Some other countries, such as Norway, Mexico, and Venezuela, benefited as well. In the United States, Texas and Alaska, as well as some other oil-producing areas, experienced major economic booms due to soaring oil prices even as most of the rest of the nation struggled with the stagnant economy. Many of these economic gains, however, came to a halt as prices stabilized and dropped in the 1980s. Key periods United States oil production peaked in 1970.  Production peaks around 1970  The real price of petroleum was stable in the 1970 timeframe, but there had been a sharp increase in American imports, putting a strain on American balance of trade, alongside other developed nations. During the 1960s, petroleum production in some of the world's top producers began to peak. Germany reached its production peak in 1966, Venezuela and the United States in 1970, and Iran in 1974. Canada's conventional oil production peaked around this same time (though non- conventional production later helped revive Canadian production to some degree). The worldwide production per capita peaked soon afterward. Although production in other parts of the world was increasing, the peaks in these regions began to put substantial upward pressure on world oil prices. Equally as important, control of the oil supply became an increasingly important problem as countries like West Germany and the U.S. became increasingly dependent on foreign suppliers for this key resource.  1973 oil crisis  The 1973 oil crisis is a direct consequence of the US production peak in late 1960 and the beginning of 1971 (and shortages, especially for heating oil, started from there). The \\"embargo\\" as described below is the \\"practical name\\" given to the crisis. For the main Arab producers, the \\"embargo\\" allowed them to show to \\"the Arab street\\" that they were doing something for the Palestinians. In real market terms (number of barrels) the embargo was almost a non-event, and only from a few countries, towards a few countries.Maugeri, Leonardo. The Age of Oil: The Mythology, History, and Future of the World's Most Controversial Resource. p. 113 The \\"Embargo\\" was never effective from Saudi Arabia towards the US, as reported by James Akins in interview at 24:10 in the documentary \\"la face cach√©e du p√©trole part 2\\". James Akins, who audited US capacity for Nixon after US peak, was US ambassador in Saudi Arabia at that time. Lawrence Rocks and Richard Runyon captured the unfolding of these events at the time in The Energy Crisis book. In October 1973, the members of Organization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries or the OAPEC (consisting of the Arab members of OPEC) proclaimed an oil embargo \\"in response to the U.S. decision to re-supply the Israeli military\\" during the Yom Kippur war; it lasted until March 1974.Oil Embargo, 1973‚Äì1974, at US State Department OAPEC declared it would limit or stop oil shipments to the United States and other countries if they supported Israel in the conflict. With the US actions seen as initiating the oil embargo, the long-term possibility of embargo-related high oil prices, disrupted supply and recession, created a strong rift within NATO; both European countries and Japan sought to disassociate themselves from the US Middle East policy. Arab oil producers had also linked the end of the embargo with successful US efforts to create peace in the Middle East, which complicated the situation. To address these developments, the Nixon Administration began parallel negotiations with both Arab oil producers to end the embargo, and with Egypt, Syria, and Israel to arrange an Israeli pull back from the Sinai and the Golan Heights after the fighting stopped. By January 18, 1974, Secretary of State Henry Kissinger had negotiated an Israeli troop withdrawal from parts of the Sinai. The promise of a negotiated settlement between Israel and Syria was sufficient to convince Arab oil producers to lift the embargo in March 1974. By May, Israel agreed to withdraw from the Golan Heights. adjusted for inflation. Independently, the OPEC members agreed to use their leverage over the world price-setting mechanism for oil to stabilize their real incomes by raising world oil prices. This action followed several years of steep income declines after the recent failure of negotiations with the major Western oil companies earlier in the month. For the most part, industrialized economies relied on crude oil, and OPEC was their major supplier. Because of the dramatic inflation experienced during this period, a popular economic theory has been that these price increases were to blame, as being suppressive of economic activity. However, the causality stated by this theory is often questioned. The targeted countries responded with a wide variety of new, and mostly permanent, initiatives to contain their further dependency. The 1973 \\"oil price shock\\", along with the 1973‚Äì1974 stock market crash, have been regarded as the first event since the Great Depression to have a persistent economic effect.  1979 energy crisis  Production in top countries by year (million barrels per day) A crisis emerged in the United States in 1979 during the wake of the Iranian Revolution. Amid massive protests, the Shah of Iran, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, fled his country in early 1979, allowing the Ayatollah Khomeini to gain control. The protests shattered the Iranian oil sector. While the new regime resumed oil exports, it was inconsistent and at a lower volume, forcing prices to go up. Saudi Arabia and other OPEC nations, under the presidency of Dr. Mana Alotaiba increased production to offset the decline, and the overall loss in production was about 4 percent. However, a widespread panic resulted, driving the price far higher than would be expected under normal circumstances. In 1980, following the Iraqi invasion of Iran, oil production in Iran nearly stopped, and Iraq's oil production was severely cut as well. After 1980, oil prices began a decline as other countries began to fill the production shortfalls from Iran and Iraq.  1980s oil glut  The 1973 and 1979 energy crisis had caused petroleum prices to peak in 1980 at over US$35 per barrel (US$ in today's dollars). Following these events slowing industrial economies and stabilization of supply and demand caused prices to begin falling in the 1980s. The glut began in the early 1980s as a result of slowed economic activity in industrial countries (due to the 1973 and 1979 energy crises) and the energy conservation spurred by high fuel prices. The inflation adjusted real 2004 dollar value of oil fell from an average of $78.2 per barrel in 1981 to an average of $26.8 in 1986.Oak Ridge National Lab data In June 1981, The New York Times stated an \\"Oil glut! ... is here\\" and Time Magazine stated: \\"the world temporarily floats in a glut of oil\\", though the next week a New York Times article warned that the word \\"glut\\" was misleading, and that in reality, while temporary surpluses had brought down prices somewhat, prices were still well above pre-energy crisis levels. This sentiment was echoed in November 1981, when the CEO of Exxon Corp also characterized the glut as a temporary surplus, and that the word \\"glut\\" was an example of \\"our American penchant for exaggerated language\\". He wrote that the main cause of the glut was declining consumption. In the United States, Europe and Japan, oil consumption had fallen 13% from 1979 to 1981, due to \\"in part, in reaction to the very large increases in oil prices by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and other oil exporters\\", continuing a trend begun during the 1973 price increases. After 1980, reduced demand and overproduction produced a glut on the world market, causing a six-year-long decline in oil prices culminating with a 46 percent price drop in 1986. Effects Recession In the parlance of 300px The decade of the 1970s was a period of limited economic growth due in part to the energy crises of that decade. Although the mid decade was the worst period for the United States the economy was generally weak until the 1980s. The period marked the end of the general post-World War II economic boom. It differed from many previous recessions as being a stagflation, where high unemployment coincided with high inflation. Other causes that contributed to the recession included the Vietnam War, which turned out costly for the United States of America and the fall of the Bretton Woods system. The emergence of newly industrialized countries rose competition in the metal industry, triggering a steel crisis, where industrial core areas in North America and Europe were forced to re- structure. The 1973‚Äì1974 stock market crash made the recession evident. According to the National Bureau of Economic Research, the recession in the United States lasted from November 1973 to March 1975. Although the economy was expanding from 1975 to the first recession of the early 1980s, which began in January 1980, inflation remained extremely high for the rest of the decade. During this recession, the Gross Domestic Product of the United States fell 3.2%. Although the recession ended in March 1975, the unemployment rate did not peak for several months. In May 1975, the rate reached its height for the cycle of 9%.Labor Force Statistics from the Current Population Survey, Bureau of Labor Statistics. Retrieved on September 19, 2009 (Only two cycles have higher peaks than this: the current cycle, when the unemployment rate is currently 9.7% in the United States; and the early 1980s recession, when unemployment peaked at 10.8% in November and December 1982.) The recession also lasted from 1973 to 1975 in the United Kingdom.

It took 14 quarters for the UK's GDP to recover to that at the start of recession. Strategic petroleum reserves As a result of the 1973 crisis many nations created strategic petroleum reserves (SPRs), crude oil inventories (or stockpiles) held by the governments of particular countries or private industry, for the purpose of providing economic and national security during an energy crisis. The International Energy Agency (IEA) was formed in the wake of this crisis and currently comprises 29 member countries. According to the IEA, approximately of oil are held in strategic reserves by the member countries, of which is government- controlled. The remainder is held by private industry. These reserves are intended to be equivalent to at least 90 days of net imports. At the moment the US Strategic Petroleum Reserve is one of the largest government-owned reserves, with a capacity of up to . Recently, other non-IEA countries have begun creating their own strategic petroleum reserves, with China being the second largest overall and the largest non-IEA country. Middle East Since Israel's declaration of independence in 1948 this state has found itself in nearly continual conflict with the Arab world and some other predominantly Muslim countries. The animosity between the Arabs and the Israelis became a global issue during the 1970s. The Yom Kippur War of 1973, with the supplying of Israel by its Western allies while some Arab states received Soviet supplies, made this one of the most internationally threatening confrontations of the period. The large oil discoveries in the Middle East and southwestern Asia, and the peaking of production in some of the more industrialized areas of the world gave some Muslim countries unique leverage in the world, beginning in the 1960s. The 1973 and 1979 crises, in particular, were demonstrations of the new power that these countries had found. The United States and other countries were forced to become more involved in the conflicts between these states and Israel leading to peace initiatives such as the Camp David Accords. OPEC One of the first challenges OPEC faced in the 1970s was the United States' unilaterally pulling out of the Bretton Woods Accord and taking the U.S. off the established Gold Exchange Standard in 1971. With that standard, only the value of the U.S. dollar was pegged to the price of gold and all other currencies were pegged to the U.S. dollar. The change resulted in instability in world currencies and depreciation of the value of the U.S. dollar, as well as other currencies, and decreasing real revenues for OPEC whose producers still priced oil in dollars. OPEC was slow to adjust to the situation but finally made the decision to price oil against gold. Frustrated negotiations between OPEC and the major oil companies to revise the oil price agreement as well as the ongoing Middle East conflicts continued to stall OPEC's efforts at stabilization through this era.  \\"Oil Patch\\"  The major oil-producing regions of the U.S.‚ÄîTexas, Oklahoma, Louisiana, Colorado, Wyoming, and Alaska‚Äîbenefited greatly from the price inflation of the 1970s as did the U.S. oil industry in general. Oil prices generally increased throughout the decade; between 1978 and 1980 the price of West Texas Intermediate crude oil increased 250 percent. Although all states felt the effects of the stock market crash and related national economic problems, the economic benefits of increased oil revenue in the Oil Patch states generally offset much of this.

Hamaker (1914‚Äì1994), was an American mechanical engineer, ecologist, agronomist and science writer in the fields of soil regeneration, rock dusting, mineral cycles, climate cycles and glaciology. Biography Background John Hamaker was born in St. Louis, Missouri, United States, and graduated from Purdue University in Mechanical Engineering. Concerned for the environment, he became a student of ecology and agriculture and was influenced by books such as Bread From Stones,Bread From Stones: A New and Rational System of Land Fertilization and Physical Regeneration, republished by Acres USA, Austin, Texas ‚Äì Julius HenselJulius Hensel by John Mann which showed plants grow better in soils generated by mimicking natural soil-forming processes that take millennia, such as the advance and retreat of glaciers scouring over the Earth's crust, or rock weathering of volcanic lava. In the 1960s, Hamaker cultivated an interest in soil and climate issues, and began publishing articles about how the health of an individual, society and planetary ecology only thrive as an interdependent whole. For 30 years, he wrote and campaigned for organic agriculture based on soil remineralization, and was the first to call for the remineralization of the Earth to forestall the next glacial period within the current ice age cycle. Hamaker produced a book The Survival Of Civilization in 1982, republished in 2002\\"Hamaker's book, The Survival of Civilization, published in 1982, declares that only a worldwide remineralization of the soil can stop a plunge into the worst catastrophe of recorded history.

Again in 1974, the International Federation of Institutes of Advanced Study issued a similarly grave message to the community of governments from a meeting in Bonn. In 1976, a meeting of 85 climatologists chaired by Nobel Laureate Willard Libby and pioneer climatologist Cesare Emiliani put forth another warning which it had written in 1974 and which provided the same message in greater detail. The consensus of the 1979 World Climate Conference was reported by Nature as stating that the world had entered a 10,000 year cooling, that the warming theory was complex and questionable and that the loss of life and economic substance to the climate would increase.\\" Books such as The Cooling,The Cooling, Lowe Ponte, 1976, \\"The cooling has already killed thousands of people in poor nations.

Bulletin, John Hamaker, Hamaker-Weaver Publishers and campaign for the remineralization of the world's soils. According to his writings, in 1976, Hamaker spread rock dust on part of his in Michigan. The following year, his corn produced 65 bushels per acre, compared to yields of under 25 from other local farms, and also tested higher in many minerals. He calculated that remineralizing the soil with river, seashore, mountain and glacial rock dust would enable American agriculture to produce four times as much food or the same amount with a 25% reduction in cost, without the need for pesticides or chemical fertilizers. The Survival Of Civilization In 1982, he produced with Californian ecologist Donald A. Weaver The Survival Of Civilization: Carbon Dioxide, Investment Money, Population ‚Äì Three Problems Threatening Our Existence, which was re-published by Remineralize The Earth in 2002http://www.remineralize.org/don/synopsis01.html The Survival Of Civilization: Carbon Dioxide, Investment Money, Population ‚Äì Three Problems Threatening Our Existence; Soil, Tectonics, Climate & Economic Systems Explained-Problems and Solutions, John Hamaker & Donald Weaver, Hamaker Weaver Publishers, 1982 / Remineralize The Earth, 2002 and in 2006 by SoilandHealth.org. Annotations and supporting evidence were provided by Weaver. The book which initially sold 14,000 copies, concerned the threat of an imminent ice age, remineralizing the world's soils on a local and global scale and reforesting the planet to return atmospheric carbon dioxide to a normal interglacial level near 280 ppm, to help slow the glacial advance.\\"worldwide destruction of forests at 30 hectares per minute, plus acid rain and pollution, depleted minerals in soils ‚Äì also causing trees and forests to die and burn, causing the rise of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere normally balanced by forests, causing extremes in climate, cold, heat, drought, floods, storms, wind and an imminent new ice age, causing crop failure, food shortages, global famine and starvation, - is the end of civilization.\\" The Survival Of Civilization, John Hamaker, Hamaker-Weaver Publishers, 1982 The treatise was a synthesis of Hamaker's thinking that emerged from his studies and research in several disciplines including soil science and paleoclimatology. His message, dubbed the Hamaker Thesis, was that due to modern agricultural and agro-forestry practices, the soils were running out of minerals, causing the dying and burning of forests worldwide and nutrient deficiencies in food. He offered soil remineralization as a solution, advocating regeneration of soil and forests with rock dusts as an economic and ecologically sustainable alternative to chemical fertilizers and pesticides. Hamaker regarded this as one of the most powerful ideas in human history. The book and its message was well received by soil and nutritional scientists and regarded as a blueprint for restoring the planet's ecological integrity by the worldwide remineralization movement.\\"The book contained a carbon dioxide curve based on the Mauna Loa recorded concentration of carbon dioxide between 1957 and 1976, plus an anticipated extension of the curve based on soil demineralization and anticipated forest decline and burning. This curve demonstrates that more than 345 part per million of will produce a glacial period if nothing is done to reduce the carbon dioxide. The destruction of our forests must be offset and a sufficient soil forest-energy program must be carried out to stop and reverse the increase.\\" The Big Climate Shift Coverup Revisited, Tree War Assembly (Massachusetts), in Acres USA, eco-agriculture newspaper, 1990s Testimonials Endorsing the book, Buckminster Fuller, inventor of the geodesic dome, author of the book Critical Path and Professor Emeritus at the University of Pennsylvania, wrote in a publicized letter to Donald Weaver in 1983: \\"I have received and read John Hamaker's The Survival of Civilization. Well done. Completely convincing.... I will tell all those inquiring of me about matters relevant to our survival that they had best read Hamaker's book.\\" To Love & Regenerate The Earth (book), Don Weaver, 2002, remineralize.org Reviewing the book, writer Bertram Cohen expressed concern that a global climate shift would make the temperate zone part of the sub- arctic zone and deprive humanity of its food supply.Bertram Cohen, Health Science Journal, American Natural Hygiene Society, Tampa, Florida, July 1986 Cohen also pointed out that \\"Dr Herbert Shelton, both in his books and in Hygienic Review, emphasised the importance of soil remineralization in creating a Hygienic Agriculture.\\" In support of the book, The Earth Renewal Society presented a statement to a Congressional hearing in Chicago in March 1984.(Palynologist) Genevi√®ve Woillard has shown that the transition period to an Ice Age occurs in a 75 to 150 period with an intense 20 year changeover period at the end. John Hamaker states that we are 10 years into this changeover period. His criteria are the increase of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere: the annual rate of increase doubled from 1975 to 1985 and will double again from 1985 to 1995. Other criteria: the increase of volcanic activity and of earthquakes, the shortening of the growing seasons, the increase of soil erosion - doubling in the United States from 1975 to 1981 - the increased flooding in spring, the increase of drought in the tropical areas and the drought in the temperate zones in summer, the increasing severity of winters, the increase of snow and ice masses in the polar regions, the advances of glaciers in localized areas such as China and the increase of forest fires.\\" The Big Climate Shift Coverup Revisited, Acres USA, 1990s, page 28 Discoveries and inventions Rock medicine Hamaker believed remineralizing the world's soil with rock dust, a quarrying by-product, could revitalise barren soil and reverse climate change. Rock dust nourished soil micro-organisms whose protoplasm is the basis of all living things. When mixed with compost, the dust created rich, deep soils which could produce high growth vegetation free from pests and predators, at an accelerated rate. The idea was later confirmed by agricultural scientists such as Arden Andersen, who showed how high sugar and mineral levels in soil gave immunity to soil bacteria, stopping insect and fungal attacks.Anatomy Of Life and Energy in Agriculture, Arden Andersen, Paperback. . Publisher: Acres USA. For Hamaker and Andersen, minerals were the primal food for micro-organisms which provided life and health for the soil. Rock grinders Hamaker invented an autogenous rock grinder, designed to grind rock upon rock with minimal wear of metal parts, and a macro version, both for creating rock dust. The full design for the rock grinder was described in The Survival Of Civilization and Donald Weaver's To Love And Regenerate The Earth. On 19 October 1984, China's Research Institute of Forests accepted a copy of Hamaker's rock grinder patent papers, since at the time, China was taking the lead in reforestation programs.The Big Climate Shift Coverup Revisited, by Tree War Assembly (Massachusetts), in Acres USA, 1990s Scientific basis Climate cycles The Earth's soil is demineralized during every interglacial period, the short 10,000-year warm period between every 90,000-year glacial period which is within the current Ice Age or Quaternary Period encompassing the Pleistocene and Holocene, or current interglacial. This causes a decline in the world's forests and other vegetation which are carbon dioxide sinks, and so more carbon dioxide is released into the atmosphere.Stone Age Science: Rejuvenating The Earth With Rock Dust, Dylan Keating, Permaculture, Spring 2007, \\"As we reach the end of the interglacial period, the minerals have mainly left the soil.... as these minerals leave the soil, plant life decreases and carbon is released. The increased carbon acts as a signal to the planet that minerals are needed. The Earth then goes through a glacial period to replace those nutrients.\\" Carbon dioxide levels in Earth's atmosphere rose throughout the 20th century and continue to do so. Excessive heat from the sun is trapped by CO2 and other greenhouse gases, affecting global climate. Hamaker explained the 100,000-year cycle of major ice ages by postulating that the greenhouse effect takes place mainly in the tropics, which receives the most sun, instead of in polar regions. Polar expansion When temperature differences between the poles and the tropics increase, a cycle of heavy wind, hurricanes, storms and tornadoes occurs.The Next Ice Age, Larry Ephron, in The Futurist; September 01, 1989, \\"The hot tropical air rises faster, and cold polar air rushes in to replace it. The result is higher winds, including more and bigger hurricanes and tornadoes. These greenhouse winds often carry much moisture with them, evaporated from the overheated tropical oceans. Carried in clouds to the higher latitudes, this moisture falls as increasing rain during the spring and fall and as increasing snow during the winter. Thus, winters get longer and colder, and there are more devastating floods in the spring.\\"The Next Ice Age Is on Its Way, Philip V. Brennan, Newsmax.com, Wednesday, Oct. 12, 2005 \\"The becomes moisture and falls as rain in the summer, autumn and spring, and snow in winter.\\"How Global Warming May Cause The Next Ice Age, Thom Hartmann, adapted from chapter in The Last Hours of Ancient Sunlight, Three Rivers Press More evaporated moisture is carried to higher latitudes where it is deposited in ice and snow, the eventual result being glaciation and another ice age.\\"the global climate system seems to be more stable when the Earth has a huge volume of water locked in ice sheets in polar regions than under the present condition with ice sheets existing only on Antarctica and Greenland. It is therefore possible that the present global warming may act as the trigger of the next glaciation. If the interglacial is indeed a brief unstable period for Earth, then we should be very careful not to risk triggering the shift to the next glacial period through anthropogenic activities.\\", Isamu Kayane in Interactions between the Biospheric Aspects of the Hydrological Cycle and Land Use/Cover Change, Global Change Newsletter, 25: 8-9, March 1996, quoted in Global Warming Triggers New Ice Age, Living Nutrition, Volume 4, 1997 Record snow in the Northern hemisphere and the shortening of the growing season is a prevailing pattern. As glaciers advance and recede during each ice age, they grind down rocks in their path.Remineralization by Jeff Johnston, Natural Life Magazine, 1997 \\"These glaciers ground rock into powders as fine as flour and distributed them over wide areas.\\" The mineral-rich dust is distributed over the Earth's surface, by powerful wind and water systems, remineralizing soils and enlivening plant life. Shorter growing season Hamaker believed that within as little as a decade, the growing season would decrease leading to mass starvation in rich and poor nations alike. He therefore proposed the remineralization of the world's soils and reforesting the land, to propagate carbon sinks, thereby absorbing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, and so contributing to general climatic stability. By assuming the task of remineralizing the Earth's soils, just like glaciers do during an ice age, remineralization would create fertile soils ‚Äì the basis for the re-creation of stable ecosystems. Glacial threat Hamaker believed in a distinct and imminent threat of a new glacial period, following a long series of glaciations in the geological and glacial- interglacial cycle timeframe.Climatic Cycles (Hamaker), Australia: Nexus Magazine, 1990s, vol. 1, no. 4Climate: The Key to Understanding Business Cycles, Raymond H. Wheeler, Tide Press (1983) He felt that remineralizing the world's soils and reforesting the land could generate a climax geosystem (as opposed to a pioneer one), through mass reforestation. This would solve the climate crisis as well as the food crisis, by assisting the planet's ability to geophysiologically self-regulate, and potentially, postpone the next glaciation indefinitely. Volcanic El Ninos Hamaker also believed that increased tectonic activity occurring with snow and ice buildup, could heat up tropical oceans through sea floor volcanism, and in addition to the intensified greenhouse effect, be a prime cause of the El Nino phenomenon. Corroborated findings In 1983, Nicholas Shackleton and other UK scientists published an article in Nature which stated that the last glacial period began when the in the atmosphere reached about 290ppm, and that the world was already ahead of that figure at a critical 343-345 ppm. Hamaker explained the significance of Shackleton's findings in Acres USA: \\" has its primary importance as the initiator of glaciation. Once an extensive ice field is established, its cooling effect maintains the temperature differential which keeps glaciation going. Variations in the amount of simply cause variations in the world albedo, but they do not stop or start glaciation. The world is committed to glaciation when the ice fields alone reflect enough sunlight to ensure cooling.\\" On 3 June 1984, Hamaker appeared on Ted Turner's Atlanta Superstation declaring that increased high-latitude albedo is what initiates glacial advances/retreats. He was citing Sir George Simpson's 1938 analysis on ice agesSimpson, Sir George, Ice Ages, Nature 141: 591, 1938, reprinted in the Annual Report of the Smithsonian Institution 1938, 289-302. and later commentary by Richard Somerville and Lorraine Remer of the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in their article in the Journal of Geophysical Research: \\"It's that cloud that you have to worry about because it's reflecting 80% of the sun's energy back into space and it's never becoming effective in warming the Earth. So we're getting cooling as the result of the carbon dioxide buildup.\\" The Big Climate Shift Coverup Revisited, by Tree War Assembly (Massachusetts), in Acres USA (newspaper), 1990s Around this time, Scientific American summarized: \\"They (Somerville & Remer) suggest the global warming might be lessened by concurrent changes in the properties of clouds... Denser clouds will reflect a larger proportion of incoming solar radiation; the reduction in the energy reaching the surface will counteract the greenhouse effect.\\" Scientific American article quoted in The Big Climate Shift Coverup Revisited, by Tree War Assembly (Massachusetts), in Acres USA, 1990s Also in 1984, Robert Beckman produced The Downwave citing the studies of Dr. Raymond Wheeler and its climate-societal implications.The Downwave, Robert Beckman, 1984, \\"Dr Raymond Wheeler of the University of Kansas invested 20 years and a staff of over 200 to compile detailed charts covering 3,000 years of world weather, correlated with the exact dates of significant events in recorded history. According to Wheeler, the world should now be preparing for long shortages in water supplies and for shorter, not longer, growing seasons. Colder weather and longer droughts will bring a scarcity of food for the prosperous nations, famine and staration for the less economically stable.\\" In 2007, climatologist George Kukla, expressed support for the belief in an imminent ice-age.An Unrepentant Prognosticator, Climatologist George Kukla still believes an ice age is likely, Mari Krueger, Gelf Magazine, April 24, 2007 Remineralization benefits Primary benefits *Provides slow, natural release of elements and trace minerals. *Increases the nutrient intake of plants. *Increases yields and gives higher brix.

Influence John D. Hamaker's work inspired a growing movement of people to become involved in remineralization, including permaculturists, organic farmers, biodynamic farmers, gardeners, vegetarians, environmentalists, scientists, climatologists, journalists, religious groups, political groups, community organizations and ordinary citizens. Remineralize the Earth In the 1980s, Hamaker became a catalyst for the formation of Remineralize the Earth (RTE), set up by Joanna Campe, its president and Executive Director who produced the Soil Remineralization Newsletter in the 1980s and Remineralize the Earth magazine in the 1990s, before the non-profit organization's incorporation in 1994. Remineralize the Earth began promoting the regeneration of soils and forests worldwide with finely ground rock dust as a sustainable alternative to chemical fertilizers and pesticides. As well as recycling and returning organic matter to the soil, the organization asserted that returning all of the mineral nutrients which create fertile soils and healthy crops and forests, was equally important. For RTE, remineralization was essential to restoring ecological balance and stabilizing the climate. In 1994, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), U.S. Bureau of Mines, National Stone Association and National Aggregates Association co-sponsored a symposium \\"Soil Remineralization and Sustainable Agriculture\\" at USDA headquarters in Washington DC. In 1995, Campe coordinated a two-year research project with the University of Massachusetts Amherst into remineralization. In Campe's letter to Newsweek magazine in October 2006, she warned that global warming could trigger an ice age‚Äúwe are still concerned that global warming could trigger an ice age. Remineralize the Earth advocates the remineralization of soils worldwide with finely ground rock dust as an alternative to chemical fertlilizers and pesticides and as a way to sequester carbon and stabilize the climate, whether it is ultimately warming or cooling.‚Äù Newsweek, October 2006 and that soil remineralization and reforestation were the solutions.\\"Global warming is now accelerating so quickly and so alarmingly, that if the Arctic were to totally melt, it would possibly take us out of the glacial to interglacial cycle altogether. Otherwise, warming leading to cooling is still a possibility. Remineralization of soils is not only key to stabilizing the climate, but in this era of great concern about peak oil, could create an economics of abundance rather than scarcity (fertilizing soils with petrochemicals). Millions of tons of mineral fines are stored as a by-product of the aggregate industry and could be the basis for a new sustainable agriculture and forestry.\\" Newsweek, October 2006 In the same period, major magazines expressed concern of a coming ice age including the Atlantic Monthly,The Great Climate Flip-Flop, William Calvin, Atlantic Monthly, January 1998. National Geographic,Sea Study Warns Mini Ice Age May Be Coming Soon, James Owen, National Geographic News, November 2005. Discover Magazine,Discover, \\"Global Warming Surprise: A New Ice Age\\", \\"Oceanographers have discovered a huge river of freshwater in the Atlantic formed by melting polar ice.

Sustainable Ecological Earth Regeneration Inspired by Hamaker, in the 1990s, Cameron and Moira Thomson set up the charitable trust Sustainable Ecological Earth Regeneration (SEER) in Scotland, to develop the ideas which Hamaker founded.Stone Age Science: Rejuvenating The Earth With Rock Dust, Dylan Keating, Permaculture Magazine, Spring 2007 In Paul Kelbie's article Remineralization Might Save Us From Global Warming,Remineralization Might Save Us From Global Warming, The Independent, Paul Kelbie, 21st March 2005 in The Independent, he wrote that since the last ice age, three million years ago, the Earth has gone through 25 glaciations, each lasting about 90,000 years, and that we are now 10,800 years into an interglacial ‚Äì a hiatus between ice‚Äìages. Previous interglacials averaged 10 to 12,000 years in duration, with the most significant environmental change being interglacial soil demineralization and retrogressive vegetational succession.Global Warming Triggers New Ice Age, Don Weaver, Living Nutrition Volume 4, 1997 \\"We must learn from the paleo-ecological and paleo- climatological evidence of past interglacial periods and their alternation with approximately 90,000 years average glacial periods within our current ice age.\\" Since this meant modern soils were relatively barren, leading to the adoption of imbalanced and artificial fertilisers, it was SEER's belief that by \\"By spreading the dust, we are doing in minutes what the earth takes thousands of years to do ‚Äì putting essential minerals in the rocks back into the earth.\\" SEER won funding from the Scottish Executive to conduct the UK's first official rock dust trials, and maintained that rock dust could fight climate change because calcium and magnesium in the dust converts carbon in the air into carbonates, in addition to enhanced biosequestration by soil organisms and vegetation. The theory captured the attention of NASA who were researching the growing of plants on other planets.Lunar Base Agriculture: Soils For Plant Growth ‚Äì D. Ming & D. Henninger, American Society of Agronomy (1989), . For SEER, as well as producing high yields, and re-balancing the Earth's ecology and geophysiology, rock dusting also brought nutritional benefits due to the enrichment of crops, and so benefits to human health.On a Fad Diet of Rock Dust, How the Garden Does Grow Henry Homeyer, June 24, 2004, New York Times. But the SEER centre has been frustrated in their hopes to provide scientific proof of their claims for higher yields and enriched crops, through the use of rock dust. Their 3-year flagship research programme with Glasgow University (2009) found that rock dust made no difference to crop yield or nutrient-content in the test conditions.The use of rock dust and composted materials as soil fertility amendments, Nicola Campbell (2009) Glasgow University Regenerate The Earth In 2002, 20 years after Hamaker's book was published, Donald Weaver produced To Love And Regenerate The Earth, an update on Hamaker's book, which was published by Remineralize The EarthTo Love & Regenerate The Earth, Don Weaver, Remineralize The Earth, 2002, http://www.remineralize.org and re-published in 2006 by Soiland Health.org.To Love & Regenerate The Earth, Don Weaver, SoilandHealth.org, 2006, http://www.soilandhealth.org/01aglibrary/010147tlarte.pdf The new book clarified ideas raised in the original book whilst providing new evidence from the 1990s and 2000s to show the direction of climate and environmental change. Weaver considered Hamaker a broad synthesist in the fields of ecology and climate, who recognized how the forests and the trees integrated with the whole biological-tectonic-climatic Earth system. For Weaver and Hamaker, a new glacial period, one in a long series of glacial periods, was due in the geological and glacial-interglacial cycle timeframe. Weaver explained that Hamaker was convinced that humanity was rushing into the next glacial period due to carbon dioxide build-up after the normal interglacial soil demineralization and retrogressive vegetational succession, as summarized by Johannes Iversen and Svend Andersen, state geologists from Denmark in the book The Holocene by Neil Roberts.Andersen, Svend, 1966, The Palaeobotanist 15:117; Andersen, Svend, 1969Interglacial vegetation and soil development, Medd.

It would not be easy for the scientific establishment to admit that an outsider might have solved the ice age problem.\\" The End, Larry Ephron, California: Celestial Arts, 1988, chapter The Political Climate citing climatologist Reid Bryson, of the University of Wisconsin: \\"Breakthrought never come from within the establishment.\\"The End by Larry Ephron, Celestial Arts, California, 1988, The book specifically examined man's influence on nature and climate change.\\"Record cold winters again and again; increasing floods, hurricanes and tornadoes; dying forests; massive fossil fuel burning; and the clearcutting of the tropical rainforests. All these may be related. The next ice age may be virtually upon us ‚Äì a natural 100,000 year cycle which we are accelerating in many ways. If we act very quickly, we may be able to stop the ice ages. If not, we may stop eating.\\" The End by Larry Ephron, Celestial Arts, California, 1988, Topics covered included astrophysics, climatology, geology, glaciology, microbiology, paleobotany, paleontology, palynology, plate tectonics, soil remineralization, seismology, soil science, solar physics and human survival. Ephron showed how climatologists such as John Gribbin and Stephen Schneider who recognized the connection between global warming and the buildup of snow and ice, saw ice buildup only as a side effect of continued overall warming, rather than linking increase, global warming, ice buildup, glaciation and ice ages, together. An exception was Pierre Lehman, a Swiss atmospheric physicist who noted the important link between soil and climate.\\"Hamaker has at least made an attempt to put the climatic issue on a broader basis not very different from the Gaia approach of Jim Lovelock. Climate, biosphere and tectonic systems form an indissociable whole and condition each other. The biosphere and the atmosphere are interlocked in a permanent exchange of matter (carbon in particular) and energy which makes it impossible for the one not to be influenced by the other. So the soil fertility is a contributor to the climate.\\" The Political Climate, in The End, Larry Ephron, Celestial Arts, 1988 NASA climatologist James Hansen was also noted as saying \\"it is not certain whether warming will cause the ice sheets to shrink or grow. For example, if the ocean warms but the air above the ice sheets remains below freezing, the effect could be increased snowfall, net ice sheet growth.\\"The Political Climate, in The End, Larry Ephron, Celestial Arts, 1988 In the book, Dave Foreman, Founder of Earth First! wrote: \\"An ice age is coming, and I welcome it as a much needed cleansing. I see no possible solution to our ruination of Earth except for a drastic reduction of the human population.\\" Also quoted is S. W. Matthews, Assistant Editor, National Geographic: \\"The ice age, which has really not left the planet for two million years, is reasserting itself. The warm time... is over. The next great return of ice has begun.\\" and Paul Gersper, Professor of Soil Science, University of California: \\"The actions recommended here are urgently needed to avoid global disaster.\\" A film was made of the book called Stopping The Ice Age in 1988, which Ephron co-produced and directed.Stopping The Coming Ice Age, 1988, Institute For A Future, Director: Larry Ephron Like the book, it carried endorsements from various scientists and universities including Kenneth Watt, Professor of Environmental Studies, University of California: \\"An astonishing service for humanity\\" and recording artist, Sting: \\"Everybody has to see this\\". Ephron's writing on the ice age threat also appeared in The Globe and Mail, the Los Angeles Weekly and Acres USA. New Energy Movement In the 1980s, a contemporary of Hamaker, Alden Bryant,Broken Planet, Broken Dreams, Alden Bryant, Earth Regeneration SocietyWhose World to Lose?, Alden Bryant, Earth Regeneration Society, 1992 founded a campaign organization called Earth Regeneration Society with former IBM engineer Fred Wood, Barbara Logan and others, advocating global soil remineralization, reforestation, carbon dioxide reduction and a new energy movement. After attending many international conferences on climate issues, Bryant set up the New Energy Movement organization. Further proponents Several books citing remineralization have been published including The Tree War: How to Save the Earth and Bring Together the Nations,The Tree War: How to save the earth and bring together the nations, Barry Lynes, Mass: Springfield, 1983 The Enlivened Rock Powders,The Enlivened Powders, Harvey Lisle, Acres USA, 1994 The Secrets of the Soil,The Secrets of the Soil: New Solutions for Restoring Our Planet, Peter Tompkins and Christopher Bird (Arkana, 1992), Empty HarvestEmpty Harvest: understanding the link Between Our Food, Our Immunity, and Our Planet, Dr. Bernard Jensen & Mark Anderson, 1989 and The Secret Life Of Plants.The Secret Life of Plants, Peter Tompkins and Christopher Bird, HarperPerennial 1989, . In the late 1980s, Peter von Fragstein of the University of Kassel, Germany, began researching remineralization with many different rock types as a slow-release fertilizer and to deter insects. Hamaker's research also complemented work by Bill MollisonPermaculture: A Designers' Manual: A Designer's Manual by Bill Mollison and Andrew Jeeves, Tagari Publications, 1998 on permaculture, John JeavonsHow to Grow More Vegetables: And Fruits, Nuts, Berries, Grains, and Other Crops Than You Can Imagine, John Jeavons, Ten Speed Press; 7th Revised edition (30 Nov 2006), and Masanobu Fukuoka on sustainable organiculture, Emilia Hazelip on synergistic agriculture and Rudolf Steiner on biodynamic farming. It further brought interest from science writer Philip CallaghanParamagnetism: Rediscovering Nature's Secret Force of Growth, Philip Callahan, Halcyon House Publishers; 1998 who developed the rock dusting theme in his work on paramagnetism, a field related to radionics, biophotonics, bio-energetics, bio-resonance, Schumann waves, magnetometeorology and subtle energy.Rock Dusts in Agriculture: Insights on Remineralization and Paramagnetism by Steve Diver In the 1990s, the Men of the Trees organization in Australia conducted remineralization trials on many species of trees in Australia with significant results, such as five times the growth of tree seedlings of one variety of eucalyptus, compared to the untreated controls. Barry Lynes wrote Climate Crime in 1985 chronicling the case for global cooling,Climate Crime, Barry Lynes, Tree War Assembly, 1985 and Robert Felix, author of Not by Fire But By Ice echoed concerns about re-glaciation, expressed by Hamaker and Bryant, which he documented at Ice Age Now.The Ice Is Coming, Kort Patterson, 1999 In the 2000s, NCAR scientist Dr. Lee Klinger began to investigate the relationship between rock dust and plant growth to save dying trees,Minerals for Ageing Soils - Lee Klinger at Remineralize.orgKlinger uses remineralization to restore dying trees at Remineralize.orgsuddenoaklife.org and NASA began to experiment with lunar soil, plant growth and hydrophonics.Lunar Plant Growth Challenge, NASA In 2001, Alanna Moore wrote the book Stone Age Farming: Eco-Agriculture for the 21st CenturyStone Age Farming: Eco Agriculture For the 21st Century, Alanna Moore, Python Press, Australia (1 Jul 2001) which combined remineralization with permaculture for a new eco-agricultural paradigm. In 2005, Allan Yeomans documented in Priority One, the potential to bring atmospheric carbon to pre-industrial levels within 5 years, through remineralization of the world's agricultural lands. For Yeoman, as well as reducing global levels to safe levels, it would revitalize the soil and biological life on the planet, and increase human nutrition and health levels.Priority One: Together We Can Beat Global Warming, Allan J. Yeomans, Biosphere Media, 2007, 700 pages, In 2006, British author Graham Harvey produced the book We Want Real Food which documented the results of remineralization, in terms of soil health and nutritional values in food, and documented major declines in the mineral content of crops.We Want Real Food by Graham Harvey, Constable, 2006, Rocks for Crops In 2007, the research organization Rocks for CropsAgrogeology: The Use of Rocks for Crops, Peter Von Straaten, Enviroquest Ltd 2007, was initiated by soil scientist, Jairo Restrepo Rivera of the University of Pelotas, Rio Grande do Sul (Brazil), who translated Bread From Stones into Spanish and gave conferences on remineralization in Colombia, Brazil and Mexico; Peter Von Straaten from the University of Guelph (Canada); and Suzi Teodoro from the University of Brasilia (Brazil). The group confirmed that a branch of geology called agrogeology, originating at the University of Guelph, was evolving, since Von Straaten published the book Agrogeology: The Use of Rocks for Crops and Rivera produced the book and video, Manual Pr√°ctico ABC de la Agricultura Org√°nica y Harina de Rocas,Manual Pr√°ctico ABC de la Agricultura Org√°nica y Harina de Rocas, Jairo Restrepo Rivera, Ventas Publicaciones/COAS, Mexico which described how to regenerate overcultivated soils with rock dust. The science was developing in Germany, Canada and USA, and being researched in Brazil, Tanzania and the Canary Islands. Other university researchers included professors William Fyfe and Ward Chesworth. The science of agrogeology is the study of natural geological materials suitable for restoring soils as an alternative to chemical fertilizers, particularly for worn out tropical soils. Due to intense tropical rainfall, chemical fertilizers are washed away from laterite soils within weeks, and cannot be stored by the soils, are thus especially harmful to the groundwater. Rock fertilizers supply nutrients over longer periods to cultivated plants. When the rocks break down, new minerals are made available to the soil micro-organisms and whole soil-food web. From the soil chemist's perspective, the process improves the ion-exchange capacity of soils while forming new clay minerals.\\"The total ionic charge that can be held in a soil. The number of positively or negatively charged sites in a soil body.\\", Cation Exchange Capacity, http://www.tereco.sr.unh.edu/definitions.html In November 2009, a Rocks for Crops conference was held in Brasilia with 170 participants to discuss the new science. Further conferences were held in Rio de Janeiro and in Mexico, in December 2009 for the study and promotion of remineralization worldwide.First International Conference on Rock Dust and Soil Health, University of Guadalajara, Jalisco, Mexico, December 2009 Legacy Hamaker conducted the groundwork for a mass movement of people concerned about the health of the world's soils, sustainable forests, climate change and improved nutrition from food. His proposal, rock dusting, known to enhance plant growth by nourishing biological and chemical aspects of the rhizosphere, resulted in soil regeneration to boost global plant cover. This assisted Earth's self- regulation and offered a more natural geoengineering solution to the climate crisis not dependent on high technology, or on-going climate manipulation by man.The Royal Society's Report on Geoengineering the Climate: Geoengineering or Geopiracy?, Sep 4 2009, ETC Group, Canada, etcgroup.org Some scientists have postulated that technological solutions may exist to assist the remineralization process, such as converting carbon dioxide into organic carbon to be mineralized as sediment before being weathered to soil. Writings Hamaker's main book was The Survival Of Civilization (1983, 2002).The Survival Of Civilization, John Hamaker, Hamaker-Weaver Publishers, 1983, Remineralize The Earth 2002 He also produced various articles and publications from the 1960s to the 1990s. His ideas were further elucidated by Donald A. Weaver in his book To Love & Regenerate The Earth (2002),To Love & Regenerate The Earth, Donald Weaver, Remineralize The Earth, 2002, republished by Soil and Health 2006 and in articles for publications including Living Nutrition magazine,Whole Life Systems Depend On Healthy Soil, Don Weaver, Living Nutrition Magazine.Mother Earth's Call To Humanity: Help Me Regenerate Now, Living Nutrition Magazine, November 2005.What Should We Do About Climate Change?, Don Weaver, Living Nutrition Magazine, December 1996Restoring Our Earth To Vibrant Health, Don Weaver, Vibrance, Number 1, Spring 2008 resulting in the publication of the e-book \\"Regenerate the Earth!: Nature's Call to Remineralize Our Soil, Re-Green Our Land, Rescue Our Climate and Restore Our Health\\" by Vibrance!,http://www.vibranthealthandwealth.com/vibrance in 2001. Weaver remains involved in education campaigns to alert humanity to the climate crisis and foundational rock dust solution. Criticisms Energy Hamaker's hypothesis is criticised because fossil fuel energy is potentially required to create and distribute rock dust, and this generates when derived from fossil fuel, however, rock dust is predominantly a byproduct of the existing aggregate and quarrying industries Soil remineralization: a future market for aggregate industry fines, Robert J. Able, June 1995, Pit & Quarry Future rock dust production for broad-scale soil remineralization can be powered by renewable sources, such as wind energy and bio-fuels grown on remineralized soils. Climate control Since land is naturally fertilized in glacial periods, remineralizing the Earth would emulate the glaciation process, allowing the reversal of what Hamaker and Weaver referred to as the interglacial soil demineralization and retrogressive vegetational succession (decline in the vegetative index).The Survival of Civilization, John Hamaker, Hamaker Weaver Publishers, 198 They reasoned that this would indefinitely sustain the interglacial ecosystem and climate, or at least slow down the speed of re-glaciation.

More than a mini ice age in 2013‚Äì2041, Hamaker's immediate concern was the shortening of the growing season from the coming glacial period, which he believed could be forestalled through rock dusting, resulting in more abundant yields at harvest. He believed the coming glacial period would preceded by an interglacial-to-glacial transition phase already underway since the 1970s, and strongly advocated an intensive global co- operative soil remineralization effort to maintain the quantity of food while improving its quality. To achieve this, he recommended simultaneous remineralization of dying forests and soils, also needed to grow bio-fuels, as part of a goal to return excessive carbon dioxide to stable interglacial levels of 280 ppm.

Hamaker"},{"id":"24926351","text":"In Ancient Greece, the concept of autochthones (from Ancient Greek autos \\"self,\\" and chthon \\"soil\\"; i.e. \\"people sprung from earth itself\\") means the original inhabitants of a country as opposed to settlers, and those of their descendants who kept themselves free from an admixture of foreign peoples. In mythology, autochthones are those mortals who have sprung from the soil, rocks and trees. They are rooted and belong to the land eternally. An autochthon is not the same as the offspring of Gaia, called gegenes (earth-born), although later the terms have been conflated. Mythology Autochthons are reported in the mythology of the following regions: In Attica: Amphictyon, Cecrops I, Cranaus, Erichthonius, Periphas. In Boeotia: Ogyges, Alalcomenes, Spartoi. In the Peloponese: Pelasgus of Arcadia, Lelex of Laconia and Aras of Phliasia. Finally, in Atlantis, Evenor. The practice in ancient Greece of describing legendary heroes and men of ancient lineage as \\"earthborn\\" greatly strengthened the doctrine of autochthony. In Thebes, the race of Spartoi were believed to have sprung from a field sown with dragons' teeth. The Phrygian Corybantes had been forced out of the hill-side like trees by Rhea, the great mother, and hence were called Œ¥ŒµŒΩŒ¥œÅŒøœÜœÖŒµ·øñœÇ. It is clear from the Ancient Greek play Prometheus Bound, commonly attributed to Aeschylus, that primitive men were supposed to have at first lived like animals in caves and woods, till by the help of the gods and heroes they were raised to a stage of civilization. Tribes in historiography Ancient myth of autochthony in historiography is the belief of the historian or the tribe itself, that they were indigenous, the first humans to inhabit their possessed land. The term occurs firstly in 5th century BC ethnographic passages. In Herodotus: In Thucydides: In a fragment of Hellanicus, the author states that the \\"Athenians, Arcadians, Aeginetans and Thebans are autocthones.\\" Strabo, elaborating the ethnographic Homeric passage on Crete, describes Cydonians and Eteocretans as autochthones.Geographica. Book 10, Section 6. Athenian autochthony concept Athenians of 5th and 4th century, during the age of Athenian Empire, claimed with pride of being an autochthonous nation, that had never changed their place of habitation.Herodotus 7.161.1 According to Thucydides, Attica, where Athens is located, had known few migrations due to the poverty of the soil.Thucydides. 1.2.1 They had personified their autochthony in the form of Erechtheus or Cecrops I and wore golden tettiges,'. tettiges (pl.) is most often translated as \\"cicada,\\" although in some works it is also seen as \\"grasshopper.\\" See or cicada-shaped ornaments in their hair as a token representing their belief that, like cicadas, Athenians were born from the soil and thus had always lived in Attica.Thucydides 1. 6 This also served as another link between Athena and Athens, as Erechtheus was believed to be raised by Athena.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica. Separate from the political ideology of autochthonism, this concept of Athenian autochthony has been linked to the rise of Athenian democracy. In contrast to the previous regime of Tyrants and Oligarchs, and their strict power hierarchies, autochthony was as an argument for democracy and egalitarianism. All Athenians were earth-brothers and thus deserved to have equal access to political power. The ‚Äúautochthony‚Äù of the Athenians was a common theme on vase paintings, in political rhetoric, and on the tragic stage. In the epideictic oration of Panegyricus,Panegyricus 4.21 Isocrates addressed to his countrymen with the following passage: Athenian autochthony also links to nationalistic political ideology in the fifth and fourth century. It justifies Athenian greatness and conquest over other poleis. In Menexenes, Plato has Socrates explaining the Athenian hatred against the barbarians It is unclear or unlikely that the above ideas belong to Plato himself, since Menexenus, the only non-philosophical Platonic work, has been regarded as a parody, a mock-patriotic funeral speech of Pericles or Aspasia, but in any case it provides an image of the Athenian ideology of that time. On the other hand, HerodotusHerodotus. 8.44.1 gives the following passage on the Attic genealogy, which references migratory origins in contrast to the myth of autochthony: See also * Spontaneous generation * History of Athens * Aborigines (mythology) * Sun Wukong References External links *Autochthonous The Soil's Offspring by Carlos Parada Category:Ancient Greek society Category:Historiography of Greece Category:Culture in Classical Athens Category:Legendary tribes in Greco-Roman historiography ","title":"Autochthon (ancient Greece)"},{"id":"24926356","title":"The Haunted (TV series)"},{"id":"24926362","text":"Straylight Magazine is the literary magazine of the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìParkside,Straylight university profile owned and edited by Dean Karpowicz as well as a staff of rotating Parkside students.

The name is a portmanteau of Classic (the classic Mac OS, as defined by the Classic Environment), and Mozilla. Like the Suite it is descended from, Classilla offers E-mail (POP/SMTP), Usenet (NNTP), Gopher, FTP and World Wide Web (HTTP) access, using a modified version of the Gecko layout engine called Clecko. Classilla also includes its own versions of the DOM Inspector, Mozilla Composer and Venkman components; the former IRC ChatZilla component was removed in version 9.1. Classilla is the last updated major browser for classic Mac OS systems, and the only Mozilla-based browser for that environment in maintenance as well, as iCab 3's final update was 3.0.5 in January 2008, Opera's Mac OS 9 support ended with version 6.03 on 20 August 2003, Internet Explorer for Mac on the classic Mac OS ceased development with 5.1.7 in July 2003 and Mozilla itself ceased support in 2002 (see History). The primary maintainer is Cameron Kaiser. The project shares administration with TenFourFox, a fork of Mozilla Firefox for older versions of Mac OS X. History Official support for Mac OS 9 (and Mac OS 8.6) in the Mozilla Application Suite ended with the release of Mozilla 1.2.1 in 2002, coincident with Apple ending support for their legacy operating system. However, many enthusiasts discovered that Mozilla 1.3.x would still generally build and run on the old Mac OS with modification apart from its dependencies on CarbonLib, leading to builds such as Unofficial Mozilla for Mac OS 9, WaZilla 1.3f, and WaMCom. Of these, WaMCom was the arguably longest maintained, with its final release on 23 July 2003. In May 2009, Cameron Kaiser announced his intentions to start porting later Mozilla updates back to the 1.3.1-based version used in WaMCom, christening his modified version as Classilla. This first version, given the version number 9.0 to match Mac OS 9 (with subsequent numbers matching OS 9 version numbers), was released on 30 June 2009. The developers consider the project to be alpha quality software. As of 2019, no updates have been released to Classilla for 5 years, indicating that development may have stopped. Features Owing to Classilla's unusual provenance (being essentially a heavily patched version of Mozilla 1.3.1; vestigial proof remains in its verse from The Book of Mozilla), it has more limited support for web standards than do later Gecko-based browsers such as SeaMonkey and Mozilla Firefox, and its layout compared to iCab 3.0.5 is objectively inferior as the latter browser is Acid2 compliant and Classilla is not. Similarly, it only scores 31/100 in Acid 3. On the other hand, its layout capability is more current than WaMCom or Mozilla 1.3.1, and Classilla has a more modern JavaScript interpreter than iCab and better support for the Document Object Model although it is also still deficient compared to mainline Gecko-based browsers. It is perceived by users to be more stable and quicker to render than iCab, important as the classic Mac OS relies on cooperative multitasking and has very limited support for memory protection--any application crash could hang the entire system. However, known problems in the browser and issues with performance on older machines led the developers to implement their own limited version of NoScript as a built-in part of the browser so that users had the ability to enable JavaScript only where it was safe or necessary to do so. Classilla also adds support for user agent spoofing, which was not part of the original Mozilla suite, and repairs various Mac OS- specific bugs. In addition, Classilla 9.3.0 introduced the Byblos HTML rewriting engine that can rewrite individual pages at the source code level with browser- and user-provided \\"stele\\" scripts, with the intent of lightweight adaptation of complicated content to the capabilities or quirks of the browser. Starting with 9.3.0, Classilla presents a mobile user agent by default. Apart from its upgraded support for Web pages, Classilla supports most of the same features that Mozilla of the same generation did, with similar feature sets and bugs in its support for E-mail, Usenet, FTP and Gopher, although the latter received token upgrades. In a likewise fashion, Classilla also inherits many of the security failings of earlier versions of the Application Suite, many of which are still not patched and openly warned of by the developers. The presence of NoScript, along with the unusual nature of the classic Mac OS, is thought to add some level of protection, although it is the avowed goal of the developers to reach security parity with modern Mozilla-based releases and repair outstanding bugs.

The screenplay by Sam Hellman, Gladys Lehman, and Harry Tugend was based on stories by Eleanor Gates and Ralph Spence, and the 1917 Mary Pickford vehicle of the same name. The film focuses on a child (Temple) neglected by her rich and busy father. She meets two vaudeville performers and becomes a radio singing star. The film received a lukewarm critical reception from The New York Times.  Plot  Barbara Barry (Shirley Temple) is the young daughter of wealthy Richard Barry (Michael Whalen), a recently widowed soap manufacturer. Worried that his daughter is spending too much time alone and not with other children her age, her father decides to send Barbara to boarding school. At the train station, Barbara and her accompanying nanny are separated when the nanny Collins (Sara Haden), looking for her stolen handbag, is hit and killed by a car. Barbara, left alone, wanders off and masquerades as an orphan. While wandering the streets, she encounters a friendly Italian street performer, Tony (Henry Armetta), the organ grinder. Barbara follows him home after his performance. She witnesses his many children run out to meet him at the door. Barbara lingers, lonely and sad. The kind and friendly family invite Barbara in. She has dinner with them, where she experiences eating spaghetti for the first time. After dinner, the mother puts her to bed with her own children. She attracts the notice of struggling vaudeville performers, Jimmy Dolan (Jack Haley) and his wife, Jerry (Alice Faye), who live upstairs. They put Barbara, posing as their daughter, into their radio act. Helped by advertising executive Margaret Allen (Gloria Stuart), the trio become an overnight success. Mr. Barry hears his daughter singing on the radio and the two are reunited. Subplots involve a romance between Barry and Allen, and a crook (John Wray) trying to kidnap Barbara. Cast * Shirley Temple as Barbara Barry, Richard Barry's daughter * Michael Whalen as Richard Barry, a widower, Barbara's father, and a soap manufacturer * Jack Haley as Jimmy Dolan, a vaudeville performer and Jerry's husband * Alice Faye as Jerry Dolan, a vaudeville performer and Jimmy Dolan's wife * Gloria Stuart as Margaret Allen, an advertising executive * Claude Gillingwater, as Peck, Barry's competitor in soap manufacturing * Sara Haden as Collins, a servant in the Barry home * Jane Darwell as Woodward, a servant in the Barry home * Arthur Hoyt as Percival Hooch, Peck's assistant * Henry Armetta as Tony, the organ grinder * Tony Martin as Radio Baritone Soloist (uncredited) * Paul Stanton as George Hathaway * Charles Coleman as Stebbins * John Wray as Flagin, the would-be kidnapper * Tyler Brooke as Dan Ward * Mathilde Comont as Tony's Wife Production The film‚Äôs tacked-on musical number, \\"Military Man\\", encountered a great deal of difficulties. In her autobiography, Temple mentioned that Haley and her mother got into an altercation after multiple failed attempts by Temple, Haley, and Faye to synchronize their taps in the sound room. Her mother blamed Haley while Haley blamed it on Temple. To complicate matters, one of Temple's teeth fell out while she was doing the routine in the sound room. Finally, as it came close to Temple's legally allowed work hours for the day, they decided to let her do the routine by herself and dub it in with Haley's and Faye's taps recorded later. According to her, she nailed the routine despite reports to the contrary.Shirley Temple Black, \\"Child Star: An Autobiography\\" (New York: McGraw-Hill Publishing Company, 1988), 129-130. While Mrs. Temple was being interviewed on the set, Shirley strolled over and asked the reporter, \\"Why don't you talk to me? I'm the star.\\"Edwards, 95 Music Mack Gordon and Harry Revel wrote the film's songs: \\"When I'm with You\\", \\"Oh My Goodness\\", \\"You've Gotta Eat Your Spinach, Baby\\", \\"But Definitely\\", \\"Buy a Bar of Barry's\\", \\"Military Man\\", and \\"Peck's Theme\\". Shirley Temple sang all the songs and was joined by other cast members for several. Reception Frank Nugent of The New York Times described the script as \\"formless and generally ridiculous\\" and the picture \\"virtually non- existent\\" but \\"as a display window for the ever-expanding Temple talents, it is entirely satisfying. Miss Temple, as some one has said, never looked lovelier. She dances in a manner which must delight her mentor, Bill Robinson; her voice has begun to take on torch-singer and crooner qualities. Beneath the fascinated gaze of a world-wide audience, a conscious artistry is developing along Hollywood and Broadway lines. It is an engrossing phenomenon: The precocious infant becomes a knowing child.\\" He lamented on behalf of Haley and Faye: \\"Short of becoming a defeated candidate for Vice President, we can think of no better way of guaranteeing one's anonymity than appearing in the moppet's films.\\" The film was nominated for the American Film Institute's 2006 AFI's Greatest Movie Musicals list.

In The High School Girls Series, Grace attends Oakdale High School with friends Anne Pierson, Nora O'Malley, and Jessica Bright. The four promote fair play and virtue while winning over troubled girls like Miriam Nesbit and Eleanor Savell, playing basketball, and founding sorority Phi Sigma Tau. The group becomes friends with boys in their acquaintance: David Nesbit, Tom Gray, Hippy Wingate, and Reddy Brooks, forming \\"The Eight Originals.\\" The College Girls Series sees the friends part ways: Grace, Anne, and Miriam depart for Overton College, while Jessica and Nora attend a conservatory. The Eight Originals gather on holidays, but the seven College books focus on the three at Overton, along with new friends like J. Elfreda Briggs. They form Semper Fidelis, a society devoted to aiding less fortunate students at Overton. Following graduation, Grace rebuffs offers of marriage for \\"what she had firmly believed to be her destined work,\\" managing Harlowe House at Overton. By the end of the series, she and most of her friends have married within their circle. Grace Harlowe Overseas Series follows Grace and many of her friends to Europe to serve in World War I. A number of the college friends join a Red Cross unit known as the Overton Unit, but as the war progresses, they grow more scattered. At one point, the remaining principal characters consist of Grace and J. Elfreda, while the rest fall to the periphery. Grace and her husband return with a daughter, Yvonne, whom they adopted in France. Grace Harlowe Overland Riders Series follows Grace and some of her friends through adventures on horseback around North America, upon their return from Europe. Other characters Anne Pierson: She becomes Grace's best friends in Grace Harlowe's Plebe Year at High School. She remains a prominent character right up to Grace Harlowe's Golden Summer. Anne is gentle, quiet, studious and brilliant at elocution and drama. Although from a poor family, she earns her way through college by acting with a highly reputed theatre company. Her gentle ways and practical experience of poverty help her friends befriend less fortunate girls like Mabel Allison (in the High School series) and Ruth Denton (in the College series). Nora O'Malley: She has been friends with Grace for a longer time than Anne. She is Irish-Catholic, good at singing and basketball, with a hot temper but kind heart. After the High School series, she goes to study in a Conservatory of Music, but returns to a more prominent role in the Overseas and Overland Riders books. Jessica Bright: Another old friend of Grace's from her pre-high school days, Jessica is a quiet, gentle girl, good at playing the piano. Unlike the other 4 high school chums, she is motherless and has no brothers or sisters. She is often lonely at home and this leads her to adopt Mabel Allison as her foster-sister in Grace Harlowe's Junior Year at High School. Tom Gray: He first meets the circle of friends in Grace Harlowe's Plebe Year at High School. He is nephew of Rose Gray, the 'fairy-godmother'of the freshman class of Oakdale High School for Girls. He is an expert woodsman and ultimately takes up a post in the Department of Forestry. He marries Grace after nearly two years of unsuccessful courtship. David Nesbit: Brother of Miriam Nesbit, he is a special friend of Anne Pierson and ultimately marries her in Grace Harlowe's Problem. He has an aptitude for mechanics and designs model airplanes in the first two books of the High School series. Analysis At the time of their publication, the Grace Harlowe series were advertised as \\"stories of real girls for real girls.\\" The Grace Harlowe Overseas Series, in particular, was written to translate world events to a generation of young girls. Sold as \\"War Books for Girls,\\" one preview read, \\"Many war books fail to interest girl readers because they do not describe the Great War from a girl's point of view. But it is quite certain that every healthy girl reader will be enthused with the description of the Great War . . . These books give intimate descriptions of conditions found in France by the many young American girls and women who were there to serve their country by aiding the American fighting forces.\\" In addition to providing a lens through which girls could view a rapidly changing world, the Grace Harlowe books model the ideal American girl (as envisioned by her publishers). This ideal plays out across a variety of settings, but the characteristics that make her remain constant. \\"The democratic foundations of both public and private education in these series are directly connected to the formation of each character's personal integrity and to her status as a representative of socially and morally acceptable American girlhood. In the plot-driven series, heroines such as Marjorie Dean and Grace Harlowe are already nearly paragons when their stories begin . . . but in all cases, the series strongly suggest that if readers are to assume similar places as model girls, they should begin by reforming the self so as to measure up to the stories' idealized definitions of proper gender roles and proper middle-class attitudes . . . The best girls are loyal to principles, to friends and family, and to the school itself. They also are (or learn to be) nurturing, charitable, and kind.\\" While certain values were expected of a model girl, Grace Harlowe shows that girls could live up to those while experiencing freedoms like travel, independence, and employment (within certain bounds). As one writer puts it, \\"Grace tries on all the socially acceptable roles for a New Woman of her class, skipping the more controversial roles of radical suffragette, sexy flapper, and independent career woman. Other writers viewed Grace's adventures as far less realistic to the average girl. \\"Many of these popular insurgent novels, especially those that focused on characters whose freedom from convention is never confronted, where obviously utopian in nature. The protagonists in The Outdoor Girls of Deepdale or The Grace Harlowe at Overton College series were rewarded for behavior that would have brought censure upon the heads of actual readers if they were to initiate such activity in their own communities.\\" Another argues, \\"Grace also has the support of her parents as she embarks on a career, a fact that may have surprised her original readers, since most parents - real or fictional - expected their daughters to marry after college.\\" Whether Grace's life might have been lived out by a real girl is debatable, but certainly, her story is one that was not told just a few decades prior. Collecting Grace Harlowe books can be found for sale online and occasionally at used book stores and sales. Since they were in print for fewer years than series like Nancy Drew or The Bobbsey Twins, they can be more challenging to find (although scarcity and value, as with any series, depend largely on condition, edition, and specific title). Given their limited publication dates, books in the Grace Harlowe Overseas Series seem to be among the most difficult to find in any condition, and often bring the highest prices. Contemporary Series Altemus published series books with pages of advertising for other series. Some that can be found in Grace Harlowe books include: The Automobile Girls, Madge Morton, The Meadow-Brook Girls, and boys' series like: Dave Darrin, Submarine Boys, and The High School Boys. Altemus even occasionally cross- referenced series, as when Madge Morton makes a cameo appearance in Grace Harlowe's Problem. Other contemporary series published for school girls include: Betty Gordon, Marjorie Dean, The Outdoor Girls, The Moving Picture Girls, Jane Allen, Betty Wales, Ruth Fielding, The Girls of Central High, Friendly Terrace, Fairmount Girls, Helen Grant, Hadley Hall, Nancy Lee, Isabel Carleton, Molly Brown.

During Howell's tenure, the CRNC coordinated a large deployment of student volunteers to Virginia, for the 2009 gubernatorial election in support of Bob McDonnell (as well as his running mates Bill Bolling and Ken Cuccinelli). The field program also assisted with the other major general-election effort that year, for New Jersey gubernatorial nominee Chris Christie. After Republican victories in both of those bellwether races, Howell's administration targeted the fall 2010 CRNC field program towards specific states, which they believed contained the greatest potential for state-level and congressional gains, in the November elections.

(Jmol rendering of coordinates from. The DNA strands are shown in pink and green.) Tus, also known as terminus utilization substance, is a protein that binds to terminator sequences and acts as a counter-helicase when it comes in contact with an advancing helicase. The bound Tus protein effectively halts DNA polymerase movement. Tus helps end DNA replication in prokaryotes.Slonczewski, Joan, and John Watkins. Foster. Microbiology: An Evolving Science. New York: W.W. Norton &, 2009. Print. In E. coli, Tus binds to 10 closely related sites encoded in the chromosome. These sites bind 23 base-pairs. The 10 sites are called Ter sites, and are designated TerA, TerB, ..., TerJ. These binding sites are asymmetric, such that when a Tus-Ter complex (Tus protein bound to a Ter site) is encountered by a replication fork from one direction, the complex is dissociated and replication continues (permissive). But when encountered from the other direction, the Tus-Ter complex provides a much larger kinetic barrier and halts replication (non- permissive). The multiple Ter sites in the chromosome are oriented such that the two oppositely moving replication forks are both stalled in the desired termination region. Bacillus subtilis utilize replication terminator protein (RTP) instead of Tus.  Protein domains  The Ter protein contains two domains. The N-terminal domain is composed of an alpha helices, beta sheet, and three loops. The C-terminal domain is made of two alpha helices and one beta sheet.

Early life Ransome was born in Croydon, Surrey. She later lived in Fareham, England where her father, Jimmy Ransome, was headmaster of West Hill Park School from 1952 to 1958. Ransome studied at Elmhurst School for Dance and began her performing career as a teenager. Career Ransome made her West End debut in a 1959 musical production of Jane Eyre with further West End appearances in Do Re Mi and Oliver!. She later spent five months singing at a cabaret in Athens and upon returning to the UK worked delivering cars for a London automobile dealership prior to being cast in 1965 in the musical stage play The Match Girls. Following that play's 1966 West End transfer, Ransome's performance drew the attention of a producer of the 1967 film Far from the Madding Crowd, with a screen test leading to her playing that film's second female lead and her performance earning her a Golden Globe Award nomination. Ransome progressed in her film career playing the female lead in the 1969 film Alfred the Great. Her subsequent screen career, however, was focused almost exclusively on television, Ransome having debuted in that medium in the 1967 serialisation of Kenilworth. In the 1970s she had major multi-episode roles in three well- regarded TV drama series: Warship and A Horseman Riding By for the BBC, and Dangerous Knowledge for Southern Television. She also appeared in other TV series of the period, such as Man at the Top, episode \\"I‚Äôll Do the Dirty Work\\", in 1970. Also in 1970 she appeared in Granada TV series \\"A Family at War\\" - playing Dominique Brahaut the Girlfriend of Philip Ashton during his posting to the Channel Islands. Ransome's rare film roles included the female leads in the western Man in the Wilderness (1971) and Narciso Ib√°√±ez Serrador's Who Can Kill a Child?, a 1976 horror film which has become a cult favourite. She also played the female lead in the 1980 TV mini-series Seagull Island which was re-edited into the film The Secret of Seagull Island (1981). Ransome retired as a career actress following her participation in the 1984 television series Sorrell and Son, though she made occasional television guest appearances in the 1990s. Personal life She had two daughters, Charlotte (born 1973) and Victoria (born 1975) and was aunt to Thomas Ransome. In 1980 Ransome relocated from London to Suffolk.

The meeting house was built in 1829, and is a remarkably sophisticated example of Federal style architecture for what was then a frontier community. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1976. Description and history The Central Congregational Church of Eastport is set on the west side of Middle Street, midway between Boyton and Key Streets. It is a gable-roofed wood frame structure, with clapboard siding and a stone foundation. Its main facade, facing east is symmetrically organized, with three bays of entrances demarcated by pilasters rising through the gallery level to a cornice, above which is the pedimented gable with an eyebrow window at its center. A square tower is set just back from the front, with a tall first stage that has a clock near the top, with an octagonal belfry as the second stage. The belfry has louvered openings framed by keystoned arches set on impost blocks, with small gables above, surrounding the base of an octagonal steeple. The interior is largely unaltered, and of high quality. A gallery lines three sides of the interior, with the fourth highlighted by an arch with elaborate drapery moulding. The pulpit stands before the arch, and the ground floor is otherwise lined with bench pews. The Congregational Church was built in 1828 and dedicated in February, 1829 for a congregation established in 1819. It was Eastport's second congregation, the first following Unitarianism, while this group followed a more traditional Trinitarian theology. The church was apparently designed and building supervised by Daniel Low, a member of the building committee about whom nothing is known. The building's only major alteration is the reconstruction of its steeple after the original was blown off in 1869; the clock was added at the time. The building is now owned by the Tides Institute & Museum of Art of Eastport, Maine and is being repurposed as an historic space. The small congregation continues to meet at the church building on Sunday mornings during the summer months. http://www.tidesinstitute.org See also *National Register of Historic Places listings in Washington County, Maine References Category:United Church of Christ churches in Maine Category:Churches on the National Register of Historic Places in Maine Category:Federal architecture in Maine Category:Churches completed in 1829 Category:19th-century United Church of Christ church buildings Category:Churches in Washington County, Maine Category:Buildings and structures in Eastport, Maine Category:National Register of Historic Places in Washington County, Maine ","title":"Central Congregational Church (Eastport, Maine)"},{"id":"24926924","text":"Centre Street Congregational Church is a historic church at 9 Center Street in Machias, Maine. Built in 1836-37, it is an important early example of Gothic Revival architecture in northern New England, apparently based on an early design by the noted Gothic architect Richard Upjohn. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1975. The congregation is affiliated with the United Church of Christ; its current pastor is Rev. Susan Maxwell, M. Div. Description and history The Centre Street Congregational Church is located on the east side of Center Street, between Court and Main Streets in downtown Machias. It is a large single-story wood frame structure, set on a high granite foundation, with a gable roof and clapboard siding. Its west-facing main facade is dominated by a projecting square tower, which begins with three of the five bays of that facade. On the first level are three Gothic-arched openings leading into an open foyer, with Gothic-arched doors leading into the building. The next three stages of the tower have a tall Gothic window, flanked at its sides, and again at the tower corners, by pilasters separated by a cornice line at each level. The tower corners at the third stage have pinnacles, and the fourth stage is reduced in size. The fifth stage houses a clock with faces on each of four sides, and is topped by pinnacles at the corners and a steeple. The church was designed in 1836 and completed in 1837, and is one of the state's oldest surviving examples of Gothic architecture (the oldest is the 1819 Christ Episcopal Church in Gardiner). It was designed by a Mr. Stephenson, about whom nothing is known, but the plans appear to be remarkably similar to Richard Upjohn's plans for St. John's Catholic Church in Bangor (built in 1835-39, no longer standing). The church bell was a used bell cast by the foundry of Paul Revere. The organ was built by George Stevens and installed in 1867, and the clock, built by E. Howard & Co., was installed in 1870.

Description and history The Columbia Union Church is located in northeastern Columbia, on the north side of Epping Road just east of its junction with Cemetery Road. It is a single-story wood frame structure, with a front-facing gable roof, clapboard and shingle siding, and a granite foundation. The front facade faces south, and has a fully pedimented gable above a pair of entrances that flank a central window. The doors and window are topped by Gothic drip molding, which is also found on other windows. The building's corners have pilasters, which rise to an entablature that encircles the building. A two-stage tower rises above the front, with windows in the second stage and crenellations above. The tower features drip molding, pilasters and friezes similar to those found on the main body. Built in 1829 as the Epping Baptist Church, this was the first church building to be built within the municipal bounds of Columbia, which was incorporated in 1796. The congregation had been meeting in private homes since 1788 prior to construction of this building. It is unclear at what point the building's use changed to that of a union church (serving multiple denominations), but the Columbia Union Society was formally organized in 1866 to oversee the building's rehabilitation. Under that organization's oversight the building was renovated, adding Gothic features such as the tower crenellations and drip molding.

Built in 1841 and significantly restyled in 1911, it is the community's only surviving 19th- century church. It is also notable for its eclectic blend of architectural styles, and is an important early ecclesiastical work of Portland architect Edward Leander Higgins. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2002. Description and history The Jonesboro Union Church is located in the dispersed rural village center of Jonesboro, just east of US 1 on the north side of Looks Point Road, overlooking the Chandler River. The church is a 1-1/2 wood frame structure, with complex massing and roofline. It is finished in wooden clapboards, and rests on a foundation of stone and concrete blocks. The building is very roughly T-shaped, with a two-story tower at the T's southern inside corner. To the right of the tower is a north-south gable-roof section, whose front is flush with that of the tower. Behind the tower a hip-roof section extends to the west. The tower houses the main entrance vestibule, the rightmost section, which is the original 1841 church, houses the sanctuary, and the back section houses the vestry area. The sanctuary, originally oriented with the pulpit at the long end in the traditional 19th-century manner, is now oriented with the pulpit area in a projecting section on the east side. The building exhibits Gothic Revival elements, with buttresses flanking the sides of the front, flared-roof pinnacles and steeple on the tower, and a modest amount of jigsawn woodwork in the open bays of the tower. The town of Jonesboro had three congregations in 1840, for whom this church was built as a union meeting house in 1841. By the turn of the 20th century two of the congregations were no longer active, and the building was in need of extensive repairs. Portland architect Edward Leander Higgins was retained to design changes to what had been a traditional Greek Revival structure, in order to accommodate a large sanctuary. The building was moved onto a new foundation, its interior reoriented from horizontal to longitudinal, and the tower and vestry added. The church alterations are one of the earliest known ecclesiastical works of Higgins, who had up to that time worked principally on residential architecture. In the 1920s and 1930s he was one of Portland's leading architects, with an acknowledged expertise in Gothic Revival architecture that included commissions from the Episcopal Diocese of Maine.

Located on Maine State Route 92 in the town's village center, it is a prominent local example of Italianate architecture, and has served as a civic and community meeting space for more than 100 years. It was built in 1873, and was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1977. Description and history Liberty Hall is set on the west side of Port Road (Maine Route 92) in the dispersed village center of Machiasport. It stands on a rise, facing east toward the Machias River. It is a two-story wood frame structure, with a front-facing gable roof, clapboard siding, and a stone foundation. The roof is topped at the front by a small tower, which has an elaborately-decorated open belvidere (viewing platform) with round-arch openings and quoined corner supports, topped by a mansard roof and weathervane. The roof is a replica of the building's original, which was at one time replaced by a shallow-pitch pyramidal roof. The main facade is symmetrical, with a center double-door entrance topped by a lintel with bracketed molding. Flanking the entrance are doubled sash windows, taller versions of which rise on the second floor. The central second floor windows have round-arch tops. Similar windows adorn the sides, all capped with stylistically similar lintels. The building corners are quoined at the first level, and pilastered at the second. The interior is arranged with a vestibule area in the front, a meeting space on the first floor, and a performance auditorium with stage on the second floor. Construction of the hall was authorized by the town meeting in 1873, and the building was completed the following year by Andrew Gilson, a Machias contractor and politician. The hall was used not just for town meetings, but also served as a venue for community events, meetings of community organizations such as the Grange, and as a performance venue for traveling shows. The town closed the building in 2000 due to structural conditions, and renovation efforts are currently underway by the Friends of Liberty Hall. The exterior has been restored (included the restoration of the tower's original appearance), and funds are being raised to restore the interior.

Built in 1846 for use on a logging railroad, it is the oldest known American-built locomotive in New England. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1976. Description The Lion is set on display, prominently located near the entrance to the Maine State Museum. Its main frame is long and wide, made of solid oak timbers with iron strapping. Mounted on this frame is a five-section boiler, with a dry steam dome near its center, from which steam is piped to the steam chest, which drives the pistons that move the train. The boiler and cylinders were insulated with a thin layer of wood, which was covered by a thin layer of iron. The main stack is located at the front, and has an unusual inverted cone shape, apparently intended to deflect sparks and cinders that came from the exhaust. It has been stated that the Lion cost originally $2,700, exclusive of the tender. The bore and stroke of its cylinders are 9¬Ω inches and 17 inches, respectively, and the diameter of the four wheels is approximately 42¬Ω inches. The gauge is standard, 56¬Ω inches. The locomotive alone weighs 9 tons.Bulletin - United States National Museum, United States National Museum, Smithsonian Institution, United States. Dept. of the Interior. Vol 1956. p. 69-71. History The locomotive was built by Hinkley & Drury (Hinkley Locomotive Works) in 1846 as the Lion for the Machiasport Railroad of eastern Maine. The Lion operated as a working locomotive until 1890. It was sold in 1897 to Thoman Towle of Portland, Maine. It was then purchased by the City of Portland and appeared in the 1898 Fourth of July parade. The Lion was given to the University of Maine at Machias in 1905 and was displayed and owned by the University until 1985 when it was given to the Maine State Museum.http://www.library.umaine.edu/speccoll/FindingAids/LionLocomotive.htm It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1976.

Built about 1860, it is a well-preserved example of a transitional Greek Revival-Gothic Revival church building. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1996. Description and history The Union Evangelical Church is located west of Addison's village center, at the junction of Ridge Road with Church Hill Lane. It is set on a rise overlooking the Pleasant River, with views of the Maine coast. The building is a single- story wood frame structure, with a gabled roof, clapboard siding, and granite foundation. The roof is topped by a two-stage square tower, consisting of a low first stage, and a belfry stage with rectangular louvers in each wall, framed by projecting hoods and pilasters. A simple dentillated cornice caps that stage. The tower was apparently once topped by crenellations. The building corners have pilasters with lancet-arched panels, rising to a broad entablature extending across the front and sides. The front facade is symmetrical, with a pair of entrances on either side of a central pair of long and narrow windows. The window and doors are topped by Gothic drip molding, a detail carried to the windows on the sides. The first church was built on this site in 1789, and was destroyed in a gale in 1839. The second church, built soon afterward, was destroyed by fire resulting from a lightning strike in 1860. The present church was built soon afterward; its designer and builder are not known, but the church is stylistically similar to another in nearby Columbia.

The congregation's present sanctuary is a brick Romanesque structure designed by George M. Coombs and was completed in 1887. It is the town's finest 19th-century church, and one of the most architecturally sophisticated in the region. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974. The congregation, established in 1814, celebrated its 200th anniversary in 2014. Architecture and history The congregation of the South Congregational Church was formally established in 1814, having existed in an informal way for about 10 years, sharing space with other religious groups in a common meeting house. In 1814 the congregation built its own church, which was burned down in a major fire which swept through Farmington in 1886. The congregation then retained the Lewiston-based architect George M. Coombs to design a replacement structure. (Coombs would also design a number of other prominent buildings in Farmington that were built after the fire.) The building Cooms designed is a large brick Romanesque Revival structure, with a granite foundation and brownstone trim. The main facade, facing Main Street, has the roof gable flanked by a pair of towers that project slightly from the corners. The right-hand tower is the larger of the two, rising in four stages to a pyramidal roof with square pinnacles at the corners. The left-hand tower is three stages, and lacks the pinnacles. A doorway is found in the base of each tower, recessed in a round-arch opening. The center of the main facade is dominated by a large wheel window, fashioned in stained glass by Redding and Baird of Boston, which is set under a slightly-recessed arch and above a row of five rectangular windows.

This older building had been built in 1816 as a common meeting house for four different denominations; the Baptists, Methodists, and Unitarians had all eventually built their own buildings, leaving the original with the Congregationalists. The rise the building stands on includes a large grassy area, which is the nearest thing New Sharon has to a town common.

Built in 1826‚Äì27, it is a high-quality and well-preserved example of a traditional late-colonial meetinghouse with Federal-style details. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973. Description and history In March 1833, a committee of the committee of the Frankfort Union Meeting House Corporation contracted Calvin Ryder, a twenty-three year old local builder, to construct the church according to plans prepared by Bangor architect Charles H. Pond for the Orrington Methodist Church. The building is set facing southwest. It is on the southeast side of a short stretch of Mason Road, which runs NE-SW between United States Route 2 and Maine State Route 41. It is a basically rectangular wood frame structure with a front-gable roof, clapboard siding, and a granite foundation. A vestibule, projecting from the front fa√ßade, provides a partial base for the square church tower, whose main stage rises partially through the main roof to an open octagonal belfry area supported by round columns. A series of octagonal sections, decreasing in size, are capped by the steeple and weather vane. The projecting vestibule has two doorways, each framed by delicate pilasters, and topped by a fanlight, with a set of windows at the gallery level, topped by a small pedimented gable. The main sides of the fa√ßade are unadorned except for windows at the gallery level. The sides of the building have eight sash windows, each with shutters and a fanlight above. Design and construction of the church, which was completed in 1827, are attributed to Benjamin Butler, a builder who moved to Farmington from Massachusetts in 1790. Butler is also credited with building the first bridge across the Sandy River, and he was a member of the town's building committee. Unlike many churches built in the 1820s, its form is more reminiscent of church designs of the mid-18th century. although its exterior styling is in the then-popular Federal style. The only substantive work on the church took place in 1854, when its pews were rebuilt, and its walls repainted and papered. Although the church was originally built to serve multiple denominations, it is now owned and maintained by a Baptist congregation.

Built in 1835, this Greek Revival church is the oldest religious building in the small community, and a distinctive local landmark. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1989. Description and history The Phillips Congregational Church is set just east of the junction of Main and Pleasant Streets, occupying a prominent location in the center of the main village of Phillips, Maine. It is a rectangular wood frame building, with a front-gable roof, clapboard siding, and a granite stone foundation. The building's most prominent feature is its tall two-stage tower, which rises above the front facade. The first stage is square, with clock faces in the sides. A cornice separates this stage from the octagonal open belfry, which has round-arch openings. An octagonal cupola and weather vane cap the tower. The main facade is three bays wide, symmetrically arrange with a pair of entrances in the outer bays and sash windows in the other bays. The entrances are framed by simple pilasters and entablatures with cornices. The interior begins with a foyer, which opens into a nave with two aisles separating three rows of bench pews. The rear wall of the nave has a semi-circular indentation, where a wood stove once stood to provide heat to the building. The second-level gallery has largely been enclosed. The church was built in 1835, and is one of two surviving 19th-century churches in town (the other is the 1867 Gothic Revival Methodist church). The church was funded by three local congregations, representing Free Will Baptists, Universalists, and Congregationalists. Ownership was shared between these three groups until 1931, when the Congregationalists acquired full ownership of the building. The only significant alterations to the building were the removal of its belfry in 1939 due to deterioration; it was restored in 1982 with plans drafted from historic photographs of the original.

The coil is usually held at the center of the spiral, suspending it in the air, or wedged by two pieces of fireproof netting to allow continuous smoldering. Burning usually begins at the outer end of the spiral and progresses slowly toward the center of the spiral, producing a mosquito-repellent smoke. A typical mosquito coil measures around in diameter and lasts around 7‚Äì12 hours. Mosquito coils are widely used in Asia, Africa, South America, Canada and Australia. Invention Pyrethrum was used for centuries as an insecticide in Persia and Europe, being developed into a mosquito coil in the late 1800s by a Japanese business man, Eiichiro Ueyama (:ja:‰∏äÂ±±Ëã±‰∏ÄÈÉé). At that time in Japan, pyrethrum powder was mixed with sawdust and burned to repel mosquitoes. Ueyama initially created incense sticks mixed from starch powder, dried mandarin orange skin powder, and pyrethrum powder, burning in around 40 minutes. In 1895, his wife Yuki proposed making the sticks thicker and longer, and curling them in spirals, in order to make them last longer. In 1902, after a series of trials and errors, he achieved an incense burning effect with a spiral shape. The method included cutting thick incense bars to a set length and manually winding them into a spiral. This method was used until 1957, when mass production was made possible through machine punching. After the Second World War, his company, Dainihon Jochugiku Co. Ltd, established joint-venture firms in various countries, including China and Thailand, to produce mosquito repelling products based on local conditions. Ingredients Active ingredients found in mosquito coils may include: * Pyrethrum ‚Äì a natural, powdered material from a kind of chrysanthemum plant. * Pyrethrins ‚Äì an extract of the insecticidal chemicals in pyrethrum. * Allethrin ‚Äì sometimes d-trans-allethrin, the first synthetic pyrethroid. * Esbiothrin ‚Äì a form of allethrin. * Meperfluthrin - a pyrethroid ester * Butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) ‚Äì an optional additive used to prevent pyrethroid from oxidizing during burning. * Piperonyl butoxide (PBO) ‚Äì an optional additive to improve the effectiveness of pyrethroid. * N-Octyl bicycloheptene dicarboximide (MGK 264) ‚Äì an optional additive to improve the effectiveness of a pyrethroid. * Dimefluthrin - a novel pyrethroid pesticide. * Metofluthrin - a pyrethroid insecticide which is highly effective against mosquitoes. Also used in most mosquito repellants like candles, patches and mini fans. Disadvantages Mosquito coils can be fire hazards. Their use has resulted in numerous accidental fires. In 1999, a fire in a South Korean three-story dormitory caused the death of 23 people when a mosquito coil was left unattended. The strong smell from the smoke may also linger, permeating fabric and furniture. Mosquito coils are considered to be safe insecticides for humans and mammals, although some studies highlight concerns when they are used in closed rooms. Coils sold in China and Malaysia were found to produce as much smoke PM2.5 as 75-137 burning cigarettes and formaldehyde emission levels in line with 51 burning cigarettes. Other studies in rats conclude that mosquito coils are not a significant health risk, although some organisms may experience temporary sensory irritation like that caused by smoke from the combustion of organic materials such as logs. In one study, rats were directly exposed to a coil's smoke for six hours a day, five days a week for thirteen weeks. They showed signs of sensory irritation from the high smoke concentration, but there were no adverse effects on other parts of the body. The study concluded that, with normal use, mosquito coils are unlikely to be a health risk. See also *Mosquito trap References External links * History of Dainihon Jochugiku Co.

Built in 1890-91 to a design by William Masters Carmac, it is an excellent local interpretation of English Gothic Revival architecture executed in stone. It was part of a period trend in the construction of architect-designed summer chapels in coastal Maine. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1999. Description and history The Church of Our Father is a modest single-story stone structure, facing west on Maine State Route 3 in Hulls Cove, a village of Bar Harbor on the northeast side of Mount Desert Island. The main facade has a large lancet-arched stained glass window (created by the studios of Louis Comfort Tiffany) with an open bell cote at the top of the gable above. The wall is supported by buttressed corners. The main entrance is on the south side, sheltered by a projecting gable-roofed porch. The front and sides of the porch have arched openings, and there is a bullseye window in the gable end. The main roof is pierced by gabled dormers rising from the side walls. The interior of the church is finished in tongue-and-groove wainscoting, plaster walls, and plaster ceiling with exposed beams. To the north of the transept is a modern wood frame parish hall, giving the whole building an L shape. The congregation of the Church of Our Father was founded in 1880. The church building was commissioned by Cornelia and Mary Prime, in honor of their parents, and was built in 1890-91 on land they donated. The building was designed by Philadelphia architect William Masters Carmac, a summer resident of Bar Harbor, and is the only known works in Maine of his (out of seven documented to be associated with his firm) to survive relatively intact. It is one of at least five architect-designed churches in coastal central Maine that was built in the late 19th century. It is also notable for its fine collection of stained glass windows, designed by a number of prominent glass studios and installed between 1898 and 1932.

Fixed-value liquid resistors are typically used where very high power dissipation is required. They are used in the rotor circuits of large slip ring induction motors to control starting current, torque and to limit large electrical fault currents (while other protection systems operate to clear or isolate the fault). They typically have electrodes made of welded steel plate (galvanised to reduce corrosion), suspended by insulated connections in a conductive chemical solution held in a tank - which may be open or enclosed. The tank body is normally solidly grounded or earthed. A typical unit can be rated for continuous use, or for short periods when used for current limitation in protection systems. Liquid neutral earthing resistor Liquid earthing resistor, 33 kV, 21 ohms, rated for 750 amps for 10 seconds, providing an earth path for the tertiary winding of a 275/132/33kV autotransformer. A common use in the electrical power generating and distribution industry is as a fault current limiter in the common neutral leg of large three-phase transformers and generators. In the UK they are known as Liquid Neutral Earthing Resistors (LNERs). A rating of 0.5 megawatt for 30 seconds would not be unusual to protect the winding of a 660 MW generator. In this application where a neutral leg current flows due to a current imbalance between the generator or transformer windings due to a fault, it is limited in magnitude by the resistor. A permanently installed current transformer (CT) fixed around the neutral leg feeder to the LNER senses the current. The CT sends a signal current to an external sensing circuit (the protection system) which then sends a signal to the relevant circuit breaker to open and disconnect the supply or isolate the generator (or transformer) from the fault. The ohmic value of the resistor is calculated as a function of the permissible fault current and the system voltage to earth.A.C.

The side walls each have three twelve-over-twelve windows. Its 1860 construction date is at the very end of the range in which Greek Revival buildings were generally built in Maine. The town house, now apparently vacant, also stands on the west side of SR 200, just north of the church. It is also a single-story wood frame structure with clapboard siding. Its main facade is also relatively simple: the front-facing gable is not fully pedimented, having only short returned. There are corner paneled pilasters as with the church. It has a centered double-door entry, which is topped by a transom window and framed by pilasters and an entablature with cornice. The entrance is flanked by sash windows topped by simple cornices, and there is a similar window in the gable.

It took place at Drummin Hill in the townland of Drummin, near the hamlet of Rineen (or Rinneen), County Clare. The IRA's Mid-Clare Brigade attacked a Royal Irish Constabulary (RIC) lorry, killing six officers. Shortly after, the IRA volunteers were attacked by ten lorry-loads of British Army soldiers, who had been sent as reinforcements. However, they held off this attack long enough to flee the scene and sustained only two wounded. In reprisal for the ambush, the RIC Auxiliaries and British military raided three local villages, killed five civilians and burnt 16 houses and shops in the surrounding area.Padraig O Ruairc, Blood on the Banner, The Republican Struggle in Clare, Mercier, 2009, p169-171Ernie O'Malley, Raids and Rallies, Anvil 1982, p77-87 Background The Volunteers in County Clare had been active since 1917 and by late 1920 had forced the RIC to abandon most of its small rural barracks in the county. This gave the IRA greater freedom to move in the countryside. In August 1920, the RIC were reinforced by the British deployment of Black and Tans and Auxiliaries to the county.O Ruairc, p 115 Five RIC men, eleven IRA volunteers and four civilians had been killed in County Clare during the two years before the ambush.O Ruairc, p 325-331 The Rineen Ambush was ordered by the leadership of the IRA's Mid Clare Brigade, who had noticed that an RIC lorry travelled every week on the Ennistymon to Milltown Malbay road. John Joe Neylon (the leader of the local IRA battalion) was put in charge, although the actual attack was led by Ignatius O'Neill, the Officer Commanding. He was a veteran of World War I who had formerly fought with the Irish Guards. The ambush party had only nine rifles and some grenades, the remainder being armed with shotguns or handguns. They prepared to attack the lorry from a boreen that overlooked the road at Rineen.O Ruairc, p 161 Magistrate Lendrum As the IRA party was lying in wait, Alan Lendrum, the local resident magistrate, drove unwittingly into a roadblock of IRA's West Clare Brigade, in an unrelated action. He was stopped at a railway crossing at Caherfeenick near Doonbeg. When the IRA demanded he surrender his car, he drew an automatic pistol and the IRA men shot him twice in the head, fatally wounding him. The IRA weighted his body with stones and dumped it in a nearby lake. Even though the British Military inquest had established that Lendrum had died of gunshot wounds, members of the RIC in Clare spread a false version of events and claimed that Lendrum had died of drowning.O Ruairc p159-160, \\"One of the IRA Volunteers drove the ex-British officer's car from the scene, while William Shanahan took the mortally wounded Lendrum to an outhouse in a nearby field. Shanahan, thinking Lendrum was already dead, took him to a lake, tied a weight to him and threw him in the water, where the unconscious captain died of drowning.\\" O Ruairc corrected this statement in later editions of the book as it was clearly incorrect.Death Of Alan Lendrum by P√°draig √ìg √ì Ruairc. This article also contains a statement that he had erred in attributing Lendrums death to drowning in the book. Although in strict military sense not related to the ambush (the three battalions in County Clare operated independently), it had serious consequences for the ambush. It was quite quickly noticed that the magistrate was missing and the military in Ennistymon decided to send out a search party of ten lorries of soldiers. Ambush The RIC lorry passed safely through the ambush position, travelling from Ennistymon to Milltown Malbay, due to some confusion among the IRA over the numbers they faced. However when they learned that there was only one lorry, it was attacked on its return journey from Milltown Malbay. The lorry was hit by a grenade and blasted at close range by rifle and shotgun fire. The shooting was over in seconds, with five out of the six RIC men being killed outright. The sixth man managed to run about 300 yards before being shot dead. Five of the dead were Irish RIC officers and one was an English Black and Tan. The IRA took their weapons and burned the lorry.On the ambush, O Ruairc p162-166, O'Malley p72-77 However, not long after the lorry had been set ablaze, ten more lorries of British Army troops arrived on the scene. They had been sent out to search for Alan Lendrum, the magistrate who had gone missing earlier that day. A running fight developed, as four IRA riflemen kept the troops at bay while the other volunteers made their escape. Two IRA volunteers and several British soldiers were wounded in the firing. Padraic O'Farrell lists the casualties as three British soldiers killed, but this is not confirmed by the other sources. Reprisals A memorial to those killed by British forces in reprisal for the ambush The British forces, enraged by the ambush and the escape of the IRA force, took out reprisals on civilians in the surrounding area. Immediately after the action ended, they burned the house and farm of the O'Gorman family and shot a local farmer, Sean Keane. He later died of his wounds. That night, a mixed force of police and soldiers raided the home of Dan Lehane, whose two sons had taken part in the ambush. They shot him dead and burned his house at Lahinch. Patrick Lehane was burned to death in the attic when the house was set alight. Several other houses were burned in Lahinch and a further eight were razed in Milltown Malbay. A separate RIC raid took place in Ennistymon, in which several homes and businesses were burned. In this raid they killed Tom Connole, the secretary of the local ITGWU trade union, and burned his home. PJ Linnane, a 15-year-old boy, was also shot dead by the police.on reprisals, O Ruairc, p167-171, O'Malley, 77-87 In what may have been a belated reprisal for the ambush, four IRA men were arrested by the Auxiliaries at Killaloe on 16 November, beaten, interrogated and then shot dead. Another two were summarily executed in the same way on 22 December at Kilkee.O Ruairc p 325 Reactions The reprisals were condemned in the British, Irish and international press. In the House of Commons, the British Labour Party tabled a resolution condemning the reprisals and calling for an investigation. This was defeated by 346 votes to 79. Hamar Greenwood, the Chief Secretary for Ireland, defended the State Forces' actions, saying that the houses destroyed were those of, \\"notorious Sinn F√©iners... I am convinced that the people of those two villages knew of this ambush\\".Ernie O'Malley Raids and Rallies, p87 In Clare itself, according to IRA man Anthony Malone, the ambush had two effects. One was that the RIC became careful to travel in convoys of no less than three lorries. The other was that, as a result of the reprisals, the civilian population \\"became embittered against [the British] and adopted a more defiant attitude to the [British] military and Black and Tans\\".O Ruairc, p170 The death of Resident Magistrate Alan Lendrum, however, according to pro- republican Catholic priest Sean Gaynor, \\"was not to our credit\\".Michael Hopkinson, The Irish War of Independence, p130, Gill and Macmillan, 2004 On 1 October, the local IRA removed Lendrum's body from the lake, put it in a roughly constructed coffin and left it on the railway tracks at Craggaknock railway station for British forces to find.O Ruairc, p171 References External links *War Of Independence website for Clare and Galway Category:Conflicts in 1920 Category:1920 in Ireland Category:British war crimes Category:Military actions and engagements during the Irish War of Independence Category:History of County Clare Category:Royal Irish Constabulary Category:Massacres committed by the United Kingdom Category:Mass murder in 1920 Category:British Army in the Irish War of Independence Category:Police misconduct during the Irish War of Independence Category:September 1920 events Category:Ambushes Category:1920s murders in Ireland Category:1920 murders in Europe Category:1920 crimes in Ireland Category:Milltown Malbay ","title":"Rineen ambush"},{"id":"24927271","text":"Po√©sie Noire are a Belgian band that rose to prominence in the mid-'80s. Their Belgian origins and tendency to develop a goth-oriented, synthetic, gloomy universe with low-pitched voices - Po√©sie Noire could translate by \\"Black/Dark Poetry\\" - had them categorized as EBM such as other Belgian members of the 1980s electronic music scene like √Ä;GRUMH... or A Split-Second. However, much in the manner of various renowned Belgian EBM bands like The Neon Judgement and, to some extent, Front 242, they declared, through their music, a will to step away from the usual industrial aggressiveness that characterized Electronic body music and developed a more mainstream accessible dark pop sound that helped them to be regarded as plain new wave or Darkwave.Translation of a German article about the band's influencesPo√©sie Noire short review at last.fm History Band Members Initially based on seven members, Po√©sie Noire rapidly boiled down to just three hardcore members so as to be finally incarnated by Johan Casters aka \\"La B√™te Noire\\" - \\"The Black/Dark Beast\\" - (writer, composer and main male singer of the band), Marianne Valvekens (co-writer, female vocalist up to the 1991 Marianne album - and then back on Sense Of Purpose - and keyboard player) and Herman Gillis (co-writer and mainly the band's guitar player.) As Po√©sie Noire 's fanbase grew along the years, Johan and Marianne were soon to be given \\"status nicknames\\" (probably in tradition of some typically \\"Goth-spirited\\" symbolical hierarchy.) Consequently, it did not take long for Casters to be considered the band's \\"Master\\" to the fans whereas Marianne became their \\"Goddess\\". In 1991, Irish vocalist Evanna joined the band for the Marianne album because producer Ludo Camberlin didn't feel Marianne's voice was right for the album and Evanna's had more warmth and soul to it.Marianne and Jo answer to FAQ'sPo√©sie Noire's band members Career summary Very little is known about how the band actually started their career in music. Nevertheless, they are known to have won the 1985 Breekend Rock Festival (a long-lasting, reputed festival set in Bree, Belgium that hosted large amounts of prestigious bands such as The Smiths in 1984 or even Slade in 2009The Smiths and Slade at Breekend Festival) This domestic victory probably played a part in giving the band a flattering reputation because the following year, Po√©sie Noire started supporting Dead Can DancePo√©sie Noire supporting Dead Can Dance and The Sisters of Mercy on tour, seizing this great opportunity of getting in touch with those huge post-punk, goth rock bands' audiences to display their own musical conception of darkness to them and have personal gigs set up in the meantime.Po√©sie Noire's Official Site : Introduction Along their years as Po√©sie Noire, the band demonstrated qualities as a prolific act with intensive releases : in just seven years, Casters, Valvekens and Gillis offered their fans 9 albums and mini-albums, 2 official best of compilation, 1 remix compilation and 15 singles which allowed them to appear on various EBM or new wave compilations and become genuine figures of the kind throughout their sphere of influence.Po√©sie Noire Official Site : Albums and Mini Albums SectionPo√©sie Noire Official Site : Singles SectionPo√©sie Noire Official Site : Compilations Section TBX By 1992, it seems the relations between Po√©sie Noire and their label, Antler-Subway, were not as sound as they used to. Indeed, the record label promised the band they would release yet another album of the band's composition entitled Delirious but this never happened and Antler-Subway finally released Jo, Herman and newcomer Evanna from their recording contract instead. With the help of Ludo Camberlin aka Carl S. Johansen, who had been their producer since the 1989 album Love is Colder than Death,Po√©sie Noire's band members Po√©sie Noire changed their name to TBX (\\"To Be eXcited\\", that is) and signed to larger label EMI Belgium that enabled them to release this Delirious album which had been the source of so many issues and changes. But unfortunately for the band, this \\"new beginning\\" rapidly ended up unsuccessful - because the band's \\"music [was not] meant for [the] mass consumption [that EMI was used to aiming at]\\", their official site explains - and led EMI Belgium to delete TBX from their catalog promptly afterwards.Po√©sie Noire's Official Site : Introduction Consequently, for Po√©sie Noire/TBX, the bell tolled although they finally returned in 2010 with a new album, Sense Of Purpose. Sense Of Purpose More than a decade after the band split, they formed again and started working on a new album, Sense Of Purpose,e-musique's article about the release of \\"Sense of Purpose\\" finally released in October 2010 under the name that made them famous, Po√©sie Noire. The release of this new opus went along with Po√©sie Noire taking part in the Sinner's Day festival,Line-up of Sinner's Day festival on October 31, 2010, together with such prestigious artists as Heaven 17, Nina Hagen, Marc Almond, The Psychedelic Furs, Echo & the Bunnymen, Peter Murphy, The Selecter, Department S, Marky Ramone, Jah Wobble or Young Gods. Side-Projects and Aftermath After Po√©sie Noire disbanded, their members carried on musical projects they had been involved in while the band was active, developed new ones or radically turned over a new leaf.Po√©sie Noire Side Projects Johan Casters Using different aliases (Morton, Joey Morton, Pateke Morton, Ilya Dimitrijevic,Jill (or Jille) Johnson or Alessandro Di Ravo), Johan Casters has extensively served as a writer, producer and even remixer or editor for various acts and artists. He has developed personal projects from the late 1980s onwards, either alone or with Herman Gillis. As a producer or executive producer, Jo has been involved in several obscure projects such as The Passion of a Primitif, Company of State, Men 2nd, In Sotto Voce, Attrition, Ei Mori, Bulgarka, Danse Macabre, Pussy Jew, Dee Bass, Translator, Minimalistix, Orion Too feat. Caitlin, Roxane and Biba Binoche. As a remixer or editor, once again, Jo has linked up with a large selection of artists from very obscure to popular favourites as proved by the following list : The Neon Judgement, Jean- Paul Gaultier, The Weathermen, Jean-Jacques Smoothie, Sin√©ad O'Connor. Though Jo and Marianne seem to go on making music together, Jo was known, in the late 1990s, to be working in the field of important musical events coordination and then as A&R; for the Roadrunner turned MostikoMostiko division of Arcade/CNR. Johan Casters and Herman Gillis (and sometimes, Marianne) While Po√©sie Noire was still active, Jo and Herman have been involved as writers and composers in the full or partial development of original or pre-existing projects (with the occasional help of Marianne). The two of them usually worked together though, every once in a while, only one of them would be involved. The massive list of projects the two happen to be behind includes In Sotto Voce, Brothers on Acid, Ei Mori, Bulgarka, Trio Balkana, Fruit of Life, Erotic Dissidents, Mission Impossible, The Brothers, Morton, Sherman and Bellucci, Danse Macabre, Opium Monks, Berliner Meisterschaft, The Secrets of China, Kings of Agreppo, Explorers of the Nile, Taste of Sugar feat. K. Finley, TNT Clan, The New Beat Sensation, Msb Sound System, Beat Professor, The Freak Brothers, Student Fashion, Mr. Horse, Subway's new Acid House Techno Beat, Balearic Beach, M.S.B., Supernova, Brotherhood of Sleep, The Moneymakers, The Airplane Crashers, Voor Den Broode, German Beat Syndrome, Neue Beat Collectione, Matt's Phantasy Club, Serious ft.JJ Maurie, Boris Mikulic, J.E.T., Strictly Nervous. Herman Gillis Similarly to Casters, while he was already busy co-writing Po√©sie Noire tracks and playing the guitar on them, Herman made sure to develop parallel activities as a producer, writer, composer, programmer and musician using, like his fellow singer, multiple nicknames : Sherman, Herman Sherman, Boris Mikulic and Tessa Rossa. Those activities can be traced back to 1987 until 1994. Among the projects he worked for as a writer or co-writer, one should note that he regularly assumed the position of a musician in some of them and took care of programming, keyboards and guitar-playing. Included in this category are The Passion of a Primitif (1987), Company of State (1987; 1988), In Sotto Voce - actually, a genuine Po√©sie Noire side-project posing as a Yugoslavian act. It was incarnated by Jo and Herman, respectively pretending to be Ilya Dimitrijevic and Boris Mikulic. The point of creating those bogus identities and launching this project was to give a \\"response to a belgian journalist who found Po√©sie Noire too \\"poppy\\" \\" (the official site claims) - (1987; 1988; 1989), Boris Mikulic (1990), Volt (formerly known as Running Cow) (1993)... Gillis, much like Casters, also remixed or edited recordings by various artists either with or without Jo : Jean-Paul Gaultier (1989), Take 6 and Take 7 (19??), DWF (1990), Wire... Producing records soon got Herman interested and he quickly had his own production company set up : Sherman Productions. Among the acts produced by him - either with or without Jo, once again - one can point out : Ei Mori (1988), Bulgarka (1988), Danse Macabre (1988), Boris Mikulic (1990), Spectralyzer (1991), Trance Too (1991), Volt (1993-1994) or Hypnotyz (199?). Herman Gillis is also reputed for working on a first hand-made filter known as the Sherman FilterbankSherman Filterbank website used by many renowned artists such as Air, The Chemical Brothers, Madonna or The Rolling Stones.Herman Gillis After the band Volt he was involved in split up, Gillis decided he would resign from the music scene and dedicate his energy to the conception of electronic filters and effect boxes of the same kind. Marianne Valvekens Marianne and Jo answer to FAQ's Contrarily to Jo and Hermann, it seems that record production was never an ambition to Marianne which did not stop her from lending her voice to other Po√©sie Noire-related projects - being sometimes credited as Marianne \\"the Ice Queen\\" Valvekens - and taking part in the writing and composing of other projects, as well. As a vocalist, Marianne, along with Jo, took part in the 1986 Mijn-Alarm (\\"Mine-Alarm\\" in Dutch) project which consisted in gathering the singers from 19 Belgian bands such as The Scabs, The Pop Gun or Siglo XX: each of them were to sing a couple lines from the project's song so as to produce a record whose goal was to raise money for the Limburg mineworkers. Later, in 2001, she also gave her voice to M&M; Project feat.M's 'Wide anthem (Sometimes It Hurt) - the final '\\"M\\"' stood for Marianne - one of the many Johan-related projects she contributed to also as a writer-composer. When she assumed those positions, Marianne used two pseudonyms - Laura Furia and Mateke Porton - which she signed several contributions to various projects with : Strictly Nervous, A Collection Of Acid Jazz - Jazzy House - Jazz Dance (1993), M&M; Project feat.M's 'Wide anthem (Sometimes It Hurt) (2001), Orion Too feat.Caitlin's Hope and Wait (2002), So Shy (2002),Travelling (2003) and Making Love For The First Time (2003), Biba Binoche's Je Chante pour toi (2004) and X3 vs Francis Goya's Rain, the guitar song (2003). Around 2003, she was also said to be writing a book but no further piece of news has ever surfaced about it since then. However, it seems that from the late 1990s onwards, Marianne's main occupation has been as a worker in some kind of employment agency.Po√©sie Noire's official site introduction Evanna After her Po√©sie Noire/TBX years, it seems Evanna has not been heard of again in the music-making business Ludo Camberlin/Carl S. Johansen While living the Po√©sie Noire/TBX episode, Ludo Camberlin also worked as a producer on projects affiliated with Jo (Attrition) and has kept producing other influential members of the Belgian music scene such as The Lords of Acid ever since. He apparently now focusses on writing and producing house and techno records.Po√©sie Noire's band members Discography Albums and Mini-Albums Po√©sie Noire Official Site : Albums and Mini Albums Section * The Gioconda Smile (1985, ARS Records, LP) * Hum and Haw (1986, Antler-Subway, LP) * Tales of Doom (1987, Antler-Subway, LP/CD) * Tetra (1988, Antler-Subway, LP/CD) * Existential Despair Methaphysical Distress Ontological Ungludation and Cosmic Meltdown (1988, Antler-Subway, CD) * En Grande Col√®re (Seven Tales of Schizophrenia) (1988, Antler-Subway, LP) * (Untitled) (1988, Antler-Subway, Cassette) * Pity for the Self or We'll Teach You to Dance (1989, Antler-Subway, LP) * En Grand Col√®re & Pity for the Self or We'll Teach You to Dance (1989, Antler-Subway,CD) * Love Is Colder Than Death (1989, Antler-Subway, LP/CD/Cassette) * Complicated - Compilated 84-89 (Best Of Compilation) (1990, Antler-Subway, LP/CD/Cassette) **Stiletto, a Brazilian record label, also released another LP version of this compilation with 5 songs fewer than the Antler-Subway one. * Marianne (1991, Antler-Subway,LP/CD/Cassette) * Tabula Rasa (1991, Antler-Subway,CD) * Delirious (as TBX) (1992, EMI Belgium/Creastars, CD/Cassette) * The Sense of Purpose (2010) Singles Po√©sie Noire Official Site : Singles Section * The Noble Art (1985, ARS Records, 12\\") * The Gioconda Smile (1985, ARS Records, 12\\") * Starvation of a Mind (1986, Antler-Subway, 7\\") * Radio-Active Flood (1987, Antler-Subway, 12\\") * Timber (1987, Antler-Subway, 12\\") * Tragedy (1988, Antler-Subway, 7\\") * Taste of Candy (1988, Antler-Subway, 7\\") * Love Is Colder Than Death (1989, Antler-Subway, 12\\") * D√©j√† Vu (1989, Antler-Subway, 7\\") * Oblivion (1989, Antler-Subway, 12\\"/CDM) * Toulouse (1990, Antler-Subway, 7\\"/12\\"/CDM) * I Didn't Ask (1991, Antler-Subway, 7\\"/12\\") * I've Lost a Friend (1991, Antler-Subway, 7\\"/12\\") * B-Wall (1991, Antler-Subway, 7\\") * Timber (Remix) (1991, Boy Records (Spain), 7\\"/12\\") * Inspire Me (as TBX) (1992, EMI Belgium/Creastars, 7\\"/12\\"/CDS/CDM) * Sea of Love (as TBX) (1992, EMI Belgium/Creastars, 7\\"/CDS) * Mercedes Benz (as TBX) (1992, EMI Belgium/Creastars, 7\\"/CDS) Bootleg Compilations Po√©sie Noire Official Site : Bootlegs SectionPo√©sie Noire Discography at Discogs It is to be noted that due to some apparent popularity in some parts of South America, Brazilian labels NovoDisc Brasil Industria Fonographica Ltda and CD+ Nordeste Digital Line/MPR Records released two \\"Best Of Po√©sie Noire\\" Cds between 2002 and 2005.

It includes a Greek Revival church building, built in 1838 to a design by Benjamin S. Deane, and an 1867 Second Empire parish house. The church congregation was founded in 1803; its present pastor is the Rev. Stephen York. The church and parish house were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1990. It is a congregational member of the United Church of Christ. Architecture The church is a basically rectangular wood frame structure, set facing west at the corner of Elm and Franklin Streets. It has a gable roof which is topped at the front by a multistage tower. The tower begins with a short square stage, above which is a slightly taller and narrower section with deeply recessed panels, topped by gabled shallow pediments. Above that is the belfry, with round-arch louvered openings and corner pilasters, topped by an entablature, above which the steeple rises to a weathervane. The main facade has a projecting tetrastyle Greek temple portico with an entablature and fully pedimented gable. Under the portico are a pair of entrances, with windows above and between them. The buildings corners are pilastered, and the side walls have tall sash windows. The two entrances lead into separate but linked vestibule areas, which lead into the nave, which has two groups of pews divided by center and side aisles. A projecting arch highlights the chancel, and a segmented-arch opening frames the 1863 organ housing. The parish house is joined to the church by narrow covered passage built in 1970. It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a mansard roof and a three-story tower, also topped by a mansard roof, projects slightly at the center of the main facade. The first two levels of the tower have paired four-over-four windows, repeated in the flanking bays on either side, and there are bullseye oriel windows in the third level of the tower. Entrances are in recessed wing vestibules on either side of the main block. History The Elm Street congregation was established in 1803, and built its first sanctuary in 1811-14. That building was sold after the construction of this one, and was sold to the town has a school and town hall after the present church was built; it was destroyed by fire in 1910. The congregation commissioned Bangor architect Benjamin S. Deane to design their new sanctuary, which was completed in 1838. It is one of the least-altered of Deane's early works, which include a number of other area churches, as well as numerous buildings in Bangor. The major changes include replacing the tower with the current one in 1850, and the lengthening of the building to the east by one bay to accommodate more pews. The organ was installed in 1863. At some point the interior was decorated with trompe-l'≈ìil murals, but these were removed during a 1928 restoration. The parish house was built in 1876; its architect is unknown.

The wood frame Greek Revival building was built in 1832 by a noted local builder/architect, and was altered in 1879 to include a Victorian tower and porches. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2001. Description and history The First Baptist Church is a single- story wood frame structure, with a front gable roof, clapboard siding, and a concrete foundation. A tower projects from its front facade, flanked on either side by hip-roof porches with bracketed columns and chamfered posts. The tower has a bullseye window at its middle stage, and an open belfry stage with decorative Stick woodwork, and is topped by an octagonal steeple. The two entrances, still framed by Greek Revival surrounds, lead into separate vestibule areas, from which stairs lead to the gallery, and entry is gained to the main sanctuary. The nave has rows of bench pews (replacements in 1852 of the original box pews). Lamoine's Baptist congregation was established in the early 19th century, and this building was built for it in 1932 by Seth Tisdale, a noted local builder and designer. The congregation split in the 1840s, resulting in the construction of another church in the town, although the two congregations later reunited. This building was altered in 1879 to designs by Asa Hodgkins, a noted builder from Ellsworth, to replace the tower and add the porches in the then fashionable Italianate and Stick style. In the 20th century the building was deeded to the cemetery association that controls the cemetery behind the building, and it was given by them to the local historical society in the 1970s. The building was moved back one length in the 1980s, at which time it was set on a new foundation.

It is one of coastal Maine's finest Greek Revival churches, and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973. Description and history The First Baptist Church is set facing east on the south side of High Street in Sedgwick, between Maine Routes 172 and 175. Its facade is dominated by a massive projecting Greek pedimented gable temple front, supported by fluted Doric columns. The building's front corners are pilasters, a detail repeated where the projecting temple front meets the front wall. The front facade behind the temple front is flushboarded, while the remaining walls are clapboarded. The church has a multi-stage tower that is square in the first two stages, followed by an octagonal belfry with four round-arch louvered openings, topped by a round cupola and spire. and Sedgwick's Baptist congregation was established in 1794 as a Congregationalist organization with Rev. Daniel Merrill as its minister. The congregation underwent a large-scale conversion to Baptistry in 1805, taking 75% of the Congregationalist membership. This congregation retained Bangor architect Benjamin S. Deane to design its church, which was built in 1837. Deane's design is based on a drawing publisher by Asher Benjamin in his Practise of Architecture. Its stained glass windows, gifts of parishioners, were installed between 1892 and 1905, and have been given unproven attributions to several noted stained-glass artists of the period, including John LaFarge and Louis Comfort Tiffany. The congregation was disbanded in 2008, and the building is now owned by the local historical society.

A total of twelve episodes were broadcast across two series. John Hannah and David Morrissey starred as the main protagonists in each respective series. Out of the Blue follows a team of detectives at Brazen Gate CID through grisly murder cases, clashes with an already-divided community and through the dramas of their personal lives. The series ultimately received acclaim from critics, but did not pull in the expected viewing figures, and was subsequently axed after the second series. The complete series is due for release on DVD by Simply Media 10 July 2017. Out of the Blue was billed as a \\"hard-hitting police drama\\", and was noted as the BBC's second attempt to rival The Bill following Waterfront Beat. Series script editor Claire Elliot said of the series; \\"[Out of the Blue] is a contemporary, gritty, urban reality. It's tight script, fast-paced direction and strong cast make for powerful and compulsive viewing\\". The series was shot entirely on film. At the time, the BBC also described the series as \\"the British answer to Homicide: Life on the Street\\". The lack of viewers for the series, which led to its untimely demise, was blamed on the fact that \\"viewers at the time seemed uncomfortable with the hand held camera work and bleak Yorkshire back drop.\\" Writers Bill Gallagher and Peter Bowker said at the time that they were \\"more interested in character development than plot\\". However, the series was acclaimed for dealing with strong topics including male rape and euthanasia. Plot Ambitious DS Franky Drinkall (John Hannah)'s life is turned upside down when he is diagnosed with epilepsy. His refusal to accept his condition leads him into a downward spiral and ultimately to his demise. DS Rebecca Bennett (Orla Brady) gives an ever- present emotional charge as she finds herself the subject of both PC Alex Holder (Stephen Billington)'s and DC Warren Allen (Darrell D'Silva)'s affections. DC Marty Brazil (Neil Dudgeon) is the joker of the group. The second season sees the arrival of troubled DS Jim Llewyn (David Morrissey), who seems to be working to his own agenda.

Desert Street (Maine State Route 3) in the main village of Bar Harbor, a short way west of the village green. It is a large cruciform structure, built of fieldstone and capped at the crossing point by a square wood-frame tower with pyramidal roof. The long axis of the cross runs parallel to the street. To the north several additions, including a choir hall, bell carillon, and cloister area, join the church to the rectory, a large 2-1/2 story stone and wood-frame structure to the northwest. The main church building's appearance is a reflection of its history. The oldest portion, which now serves as the transepts of the present structure, was built in 1877-78 to designs by C. C. Haight, and was quickly judged inadequate for the large number of summer worshippers. In 1885-86 Rotch & Tilden designed a major expansion, which created the cruciform shape with an imposing tower. The choir room to the northeast was added in 1889-90, and the cloister and rectory (designs by Westray Ladd of Philadelphia) in 1899. A chapel at the western end (design by Baker and Dallett of Philadelphia) was added in 1901-02. The interior of the church is graced by twelve windows designed by the Tiffany Studio, installed between 1886 and 1907, as well as eighteen other stained glass windows by American, English and European artists.

The factory was established in 1899 during the period of construction of the Chinese Eastern Railway, as the Shahekou works, and was under Japanese control from 1905, and later part of the Manchukuo state. After the end of the Second World War the railway was under joint Chinese and Russian control until the 1950s when the Chinese Eastern Railroad and the city of Dalian were transferred to sole Chinese control. The factory was state owned, and controlled by the Ministry of Railways until 2001 when LORIC (China National Railway Locomotive & Rolling Stock Industry Corporation) was split into two groups (as part of CNR Group); it then became one of the constituent companies of listed company China CNR, and after June 1, 2015, CRRC, an unification of two listed companies that derived from 2001 split. History 1899‚Äì1952 Dalian in relation to the South Manchurian branch (NE-SW) of the Chinese Eastern Railway (map draw in 1912). The locomotive factory in Dalian was founded in 1899,Sources: contemporary with the construction of the southern branch of the Chinese Eastern Railway during the lease of the Liaodong Peninsula from China to the Russian Empire,The lease and railway construction rights were obtained in the Li‚ÄìLobanov Treaty of 1896 and to the development of Dalian as a port and town. In 1905, the \\"Shahekou Plant\\" came under Japanese control as a result of the Treaty of Portsmouth, and in 1906 the railway from Dalian to Changchun became part of the Japanese controlled South Manchurian Railway. In 1934 the factory together with Kawasaki Heavy Industries, manufactured the Asia Express high speed steam train for the South Manchuria Railway. In 1945 at the end of the Second World War the city came under Soviet Russian control. The Changchun Railway was jointly operated by China and Russia until 1952, when control was passed entirely to the Chinese government. Soviet Russian occupation ended in 1955. 1952‚Äì2000 In 1956 the company manufactured the China Railways HP prototype 2-10-2 steam locomotive. and in 1957, the first China Railways JS class 2-8-2 locomotive, of which 1916 were built at different plants. as well as other steam locomotives. Diesel locomotives were developed and produced at the plant, a prototype diesel electric type \\"JuLong\\" () was produced in 1958 based on the Russian –¢–≠10 locomotive and Fairbanks Morse FM38D opposed piston engine, which led to the DF class diesel electric locomotives entered production in 1964. The change from steam to diesel production began in 1965, and in 1969, the first of the China Railways DF4 class of locomotives was produced. The DF4 series of locomotive type became the main mainline diesel locomotive type in China, and developments were produced in the following decades; including the DF4B in 1984, the DF4D in 1996. In the 1980s the company began a decade long research partnership with Ricardo plc into increasing the power output and efficiency of its DL240 diesel engine products. In 1997 it began working with Southwest Research Institute (USA) on the design of a new locomotive diesel engine. The company first exported a mainline diesel locomotive in 1993 (to Myanmar), by the middle of the first decade of the 21st century the company had exported over 200 diesel locomotives. By 2000 the company was producing half of the China's internal supply of diesel locomotives, and manufactured 80% of the countries diesel locomotive exports. 2000‚Äìpresent Dalian locomotive works' parent company, state-owned China National Railway Locomotive & Rolling Stock Industry Corporation (LORIC), was split into the northern and southern groups in 2002; the locomotive works part of China Northern Locomotive & Rolling Stock Industry (Group) Corporation along with other rail vehicle manufacturers in China.wikisource:zh:ÂõΩÂä°Èô¢ÂÖ≥‰∫éÁªÑÂª∫‰∏≠ÂõΩÂåóÊñπÊú∫ËΩ¶ËΩ¶ËæÜÂ∑•‰∏öÈõÜÂõ¢ÂÖ¨Âè∏ÊúâÂÖ≥ÈóÆÈ¢òÁöÑÊâπÂ§ç (in Chinese) The locomotive works was also incorporated as a limited company in 2003, known as CNR Group Dalian Locomotive & Rolling Stock () or just CNR Dalian.

Also in the 2000s the diesel electric locomotives China Railways HXN3 were produced at Dalian in association with GM EMD. As part of the initial public offering, the stake of CRN Dalian was transferred to an intermediate holding company China CNR in 2008. In 2009 the company obtained its first export order to supply locomotives to a western country, an order for 20 New Zealand DL class locomotives. In 2009 the groundbreaking ceremony took place for a new plant in the L√ºshun economic development zone (Lushunkou District); the new facility was developed in conjunction with the municipal council of Dalian city. The facility, on a site, is designed to have a production of around 1000 locomotives, 1000 rail vehicles and 1000 diesel engines per year. The plant officially opened in August 2011, the first vehicles on the production line were metro passenger units for Line 2, Tianjin Metro. One of the company's latest export orders came in January 2015 from the Lagos Metropolitan Area Transport Authority for 15 metro trains for the Lagos Rail Mass Transit system in Nigeria, with an option for 14 more. This order came about following a failed acquisition of old H-series carriages retired from the Toronto Subway.

The congregation is affiliated with the United Church of Christ. Description and history The Union Church is set on the northeast side of Summit Road, just north of its junction with Joy Road in a residential area of Northeast Harbor. It is a cruciform structure, built out of stone and wood. Most of the structure is built out of glacial till, with dressed granite corner quoins and stone buttresses. The end of the transept is finished in vertical board-and-batten siding, and the roof is finished in wood shingles. A squat stone tower rises above the southeastern end of the building. The street-facing facade of the church presents its long axis, with the long nave to the left, and the main entrance just to the right of the south transept, sheltered by a buttressed porch. The church congregation was established in 1883, at first meeting in a local school. In 1886, the congregation, a mix of summer and full-time residents, formally organized and acquired the land for the building. The noted Boston firm of Peabody and Stearns, one of New England's leading architectural firms of the period, designed the building, which was completed in 1887. The firm was also responsible for alterations to the transept gable ends made in 1913. This church was highlighted among those built along Maine's seacoast for its particularly organic appearance in relationship to its surroundings.

Built in 1855 for a congregation established in 1812, the present church building is a fine local example of Greek Revival architecture, and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1995. The congregation is affiliated with the United Church of Christ; worship is held every Sunday mornings at 10 a.m. Sunday School begins at 9 a.m. Communion is served the first Sunday of every month. Architecture and history The church is set on the east side of Maine 176, on a rise a short way south of the rural village of West Brooksville in northwestern Brooksville. It is a single-story wood frame structure with well-preserved exterior and interior Greek Revival elements. The main facade, which faces west, has symmetrically-placed entrances, each flanked by pilasters and topped by a transom window and entablature. The entrances are separated by taller pilasters, which are also found at the corners, supporting an entablature and a full triangular pediment. Rising above the entrances is the tower, which begins with square stages topped by a sawn balustrade, which encircles the octagonal belfry. Four sides of the belfry have louvered openings, with pilasters rising to an entablature, above which the octagonal steeple rises to a spire. A vestry has been added on to the nave, projecting to the right from the rear. Interior decoration includes molded window surrounds adorned with rosettes and vines, paneled pilasters flanking the doorways to the nave and the chancel. The nave retains original pews; its metal ceiling is a late-19th century alteration. The interior suffered some damaged in a 1982 fire, but this has been restored. The West Brooksville congregation was organized in 1812, meeting for many years in a building shared with a school and town meetings. The congregation authorized construction of the present building in 1854, and it was completed in 1855. Credit for its design is conventionally given to Thomas Gardner, a local master builder, but Thomas Lord, a noted master builder from Blue Hill may have played a significant role; he is credited with the construction of a number other area churches whose designs bear some resemblance to this one.

Built in 1850-51 by the Eastern Maine Methodist Conference, it housed East Maine Conference Seminary, which was the only Methodist seminary in eastern Maine, and was the only seminary in Hancock County. Of the two surviving buildings of the seminary, this is the finest, a handsome Greek Revival structure that is a distinctive local landmark. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. Description and history Wilson Hall is set on the north side of Franklin Street on the outskirts of Bucksport village, just west of a cemetery fronting on McDonald Street. It sits atop a rise that would have a commanding view of the village if a band of trees did not intervene. The building is a two-story gable-roofed structure, with load-bearing brick walls two stories high, and wood frame gable ends and roof structure. A two-stage square belfry rises at the center of the roof ridge, and the main entrance is centered on the long side, facing toward the village to the south. A shed-roof dormer has been added to the north side of the roof. On the same property further west stands the seminary's original 1855 dormitory, which has been significantly altered and is no longer historically significant. The Eastern Maine Methodist Conference was established in 1848, due in part to the rise in Methodism's popularity in the region in the 1840s. The conference elected to build a seminary soon afterward, and Wilson Hall was built in 1850-51. It is the largest Greek Revival building in Bucksport, and was home to the county's only seminary. The school closed in 1933. In 1941 the property was purchased by an order Roman Catholic Oblate Fathers, who operated St. Joseph's Seminary on the premises until 1971. The property was sold to a private owner in 1978. After standing vacant and deteriorating for many years, the building is now owned by the town and is the subject of preservation efforts.

Description and history The West Gouldsboro Union Church is set on the east side of South Gouldsboro Road (SR 186), on a wide neck of land separating Jones Pond and Jones Cove, about south of United States Route 1. It is a roughly L-shaped wood frame structure, with a steeply-pitched gable roof over the nave, whose ridge is parallel to the street. Projecting to the front of this are a broad cross-gabled section, and an entrance vestibule topped by a square tower with pyramidal roof. Below the projecting gable section are three round-arch windows, with bands of paneled woodwork below the pedimented gable. The gable is finished in clapboard except for its peak area, which has applied Stick style woodwork. The tower section has a double door flanked by sash windows, with a flared section leading to the tower's first stage, which has a single rose window. Above this is an arcade of blind arches, above which a band of half rounds are set beneath the roof. The interior of the church has stained patterned narrow board sheathing on its walls. The church was built between 1888 and 1891, as funding and community labor became available to work on it. Its architect is unknown. It is one of a relatively modest number of wood-frame churches built on the Maine coast in that time, as most of the churches built for summer resort areas were built out of stone and brick.

It was under his leadership that the BFS adopted its distinctive naval-style uniform with silver rank badges.Shears (1970), p. 101 Its personnel were given honorary Army ranks, with its director given the rank of full colonel. The BFS initially had 300 personnel, augmented by remaining personnel from the German customs service. Former German customs officials were released from prisoner of war camps and put to work carrying out day-to-day border control duties, while the BFS concentrated on preventing illegal activities such as smuggling and unauthorised border crossings. For the first few years after the war it concentrated almost entirely on Germany's borders with Belgium, Denmark and the Netherlands, leaving the border of the Soviet occupation zone almost entirely unguarded. This changed after the Berlin Blockade of 1948-49 and the increasing flow of illegal imports from the Soviet zone. The BFS and the newly established West German Zollgrenzdienst (Federal Customs Service) were deployed along what became the inner German border from L√ºbeck down to G√∂ttingen, a distance of some .Stacy (1984), pp. 261-62 Changes to the role of the BFS In 1955 the British Control Commission was wound up as sovereignty was passed from the Western Allies to the West German state. The BFS underwent drastic changes, passing from the jurisdiction of the British Foreign and Commonwealth Office to that of the War Office, later the Ministry of Defence (although it remained a civilian organisation). Its staff was reduced from around 300 personnel to 38, and it lost many of its executive responsibilities. A limited number of its staff worked on the eastern border but the majority worked at transit points as liaison with the German border authorities. They assisted with the movements of members of the British armed forces in Germany and their dependents, under the Status of Forces Agreement with West Germany. The headquarters of the BFS was moved to Wahner Heide near Bonn ‚Äì now Cologne Bonn Airport ‚Äì where it was administered as part of the Joint Services Liaison Organization. Its operations along the eastern border were administered from a regional headquarters at Hannover. Additional regional liaison offices were located in Berlin, D√ºsseldorf and Helmstedt, near the main border crossing (Checkpoint Alpha) on the Hanover-Berlin autobahn.Stacy (1984), pp. 262-63 The BFS went through further changes in 1967, when it was established as a permanent Civil Service organisation. Its role changed again in 1972 following the signature of the Treaty on the Basis of Relations between East and West Germany, when the two states agreed to recognise each other. The British government took the view at this point that the United Kingdom was no longer responsible for the inner German border and considered eliminating the BFS altogether. However, it was decided that it would continue to have a very limited role on the border, chiefly involving conducting liaison with the German border agencies. It was reduced to 16 members with only the British Frontier Post at Helmstedt, manned by four personnel, remaining open.Stacy (1984), p. 263 The BFS was finally dissolved on 28 May 1991, following the reunification of Germany.\\"Grenzbewacher West\\". Zonengrenze-Museum, Helmstedt. BFS on the ground Joint British Army ‚Äì British Frontier Service patrol near Helmstedt, early 1970s Between 1955 and 1972, the BFS played a front-line role in managing tensions on the inner German border. Its officers were called to the scene of border incidents or unusual activity to defuse disputes and provide an independent British view of situations. They dealt with a wide variety of incidents ranging from escapes over the East German border fortifications, to intruding East German border markers, or attempts to block West German boats along the disputed river border on the Elbe. West German customs or Bundesgrenzschutz (BGS Federal Border Protection) personnel would deal directly with the East Germans with the BFS officer providing advice.Shears (1970), pp. 102-03 The BFS also assisted the British Army in carrying out patrols of the inner German border. Its personnel were a familiar sight, guiding units of the British Army of the Rhine (BAOR) along the southern sector of the British zone from Lauenburg to Schmidekopf. Although the BAOR did not patrol the much shorter northern sector from L√ºbeck to Lauenburg, the BFS filled the gap with occasional \\"visits\\".Stacy (1984), p. 264 It presented a somewhat odd appearance, described by The Times as \\"delightful, perhaps unique\\": Notable BFS personnel Several BFS personnel were honoured for their work. Jack Owen, a BFS officer and former Royal Marine, was awarded an MBE in 1963 following a tense incident at Bohldamm near L√ºchow in Lower Saxony. The border ran along a stream, but its precise location was disputed. The West Germans considered the far side of the stream to be the location of the border, while the East Germans regarded the border as lying in the middle of the stream. An overgrown cobbled footbridge crossed the stream but was blocked by the East Germans with a movable barbed wire trestle barrier situated at the far end of the bridge. One day in 1962 the East Germans moved the barrier to the middle of the bridge, despite protests from West German border guards and customs officials. The situation escalated when the East Germans warned that they would shoot anyone who touched the trestle and backed up their warning by emplacing machine guns and armoured cars on their side of the stream. The West Germans called up a BFS platoon and a British Army section to back them up. Owen called the East Germans' bluff by walking onto the bridge with two British soldiers and carrying the trestle back to the eastern side of the stream. He then stood by it for the next eight hours to make sure that it would not be moved again.Shears (1970), p. 103 Tommy Jones, a former member of the Royal Military Police special investigations branch, became well known as a guide for Western journalists and visitors to the inner German border. Although he escorted around 4,000-5,000 visitors a year along the border, he averred that he \\"never [got] frustrated. It is important to show people this border. It is impossible to imagine it or to describe it.\\" Jones arrived in Germany in 1945 during the British advance to the Elbe in the closing months of the Second World War and remained there for the next 45 years. He joined the BFS in 1960, moved to Helmstedt in 1974 and became the head of the BFS in 1983, by which time it had only four personnel left. In January 1990, he was awarded an MBE and retired to become a Chelsea Pensioner. His departure was noted not just by the West Germans with whom he had worked for so long, but by the East German border guards as well; as he put it, \\"For 16 years at Helmstedt, the East German border guards never spoke to me... All they did was take pictures of me from behind bushes. When the border was opened, suddenly the East German guards decided they wanted to try and shake my hand. But I didn't feel like shaking their hands.\\" Notes References * * Category:Allied occupation of Germany Category:Border guards Category:British forces in Germany Category:Cold War military history of the United Kingdom Category:Inner German border ","title":"British Frontier Service"},{"id":"24927522","text":"Pulaski Library, also known as Hudson Branch Library, is a historic library building located at Rochester in Monroe County, New York.

For two flat and parallel surfaces, the value of the disjoining pressure (i.e., the force per unit area) can be calculated as the derivative of the Gibbs energy of interaction per unit area in respect to distance (in the direction normal to that of the interacting surfaces). There is also a related concept of disjoining force, which can be viewed as disjoining pressure times the surface area of the interacting surfaces. The concept of disjoining pressure was introduced by Derjaguin (1936) as the difference between the pressure in a region of a phase adjacent to a surface confining it, and the pressure in the bulk of this phase.See: * –î–µ—Ä—è–≥–∏–Ω, –ë. –í. and –ö—É—Å–∞–∫–æ–≤ –ú. –ú.

Although the Cocktail Chic name was a one-off for Eurovision, the group, consisting of sisters Dominique Poulain and Catherine Bonnevay and their cousins Francine Chanterau and Martine Latorre, had formed in the late 1960s, originally under the name of Les OP'4. They were spotted by singing star Claude Fran√ßois, who renamed them Les Fl√©chettes (after Fl√®che, his newly formed record label). They released several singles under their own name (including French-language versions of such as The Turtles' \\"Elenore\\" and The Supremes' \\"Come See About Me\\"), but spent most of the 1970s working as backing singers, both on stage and in the studio, for Fran√ßois and other big names. Chanterau and Latorre had Eurovision experience, having been among the backing singers for the victorious Marie Myriam in 1977, and provided backing vocals for four countries at the 1978 contest held in Paris.Artist information at diggiloo.net Following Fran√ßois' premature death in 1978, their career went on hiatus. In 1986, they returned, now under the name of Cocktail, to take part in the selection for that year's French Eurovision entry, which they duly won with the song \\"Europ√©ennes\\" (\\"European Girls\\").ESC National Finals 1986 Having expanded their name to Cocktail Chic, they went forward to the 31st Eurovision Song Contest, held on 3 May in Bergen, Norway. Critics who had branded \\"Europ√©ennes\\" as musically dreary and lyrically feeble appeared to have their fears confirmed as the song ended the evening in a dismal 17th place of 20 entries, France's worst result in 30 years of Eurovision to that date.ESC History 1986\\"Europ√©ennes\\" lyrics at diggiloo.net Particularly galling to many in France was the fact that the other three French-language songs in that year's contest (from Belgium, Switzerland and Luxembourg), had finished the evening occupying the top three places. They largely vanished from sight again after their Eurovision appearance. Recent years have however seen a renewed interest in Les Fl√©chettes recordings in the retro French pop market, and they have reunited to give several interviews in which they discuss their career.

In 1980 she recorded the first documentary on transsexuality for TVE2. It was not aired until September 1981, after the failed 23-F coup by Antonio Tejero. Antonelli is best known for her role as Gloria in the television series El s√≠ndrome de Ulises. Political activism In 1997 Antonelli joined in the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party (PSOE), as Area Coordinator for the Federal Transsexual/GLBT Group. In 2004 the PSOE won the elections and the Congress approved gay marriage, but trans rights were not granted at that time. In 2006, Antonelli threatened a hunger strike unless the PSOE majority adopted the Gender Identity Law (Ley de Identidad de G√©nero). The law was adopted in 2007, and she was the first transsexual person in the Community of Madrid to obtain the amended sex designation on her legal documents. Antonelli has spoken out against attempts to prohibit sex work in Spain, noting that it would disproportionately affect trans women, who often have difficulty finding other work. She has received several awards for her work. The Transsexual Collective of Madrid honored her in 2003 for her trailblazing efforts. She was honored by transgender groups in Catalonia and Andalusia in 2008 for her work on the Gender Identity Act.

He graduated from Algoma High School in 1931 and attended the University of Wisconsin for a year and a half.

Depot assembly and repair operations were conducted along boulevards used as runways and in various buildings converted to shops. Although Manila was declared an \\"Open City\\" December 25, 1941, the depot continued its operations and evacuation activities to the Bataan Peninsula up until January 1, 1942, when the last P-40 Warhawk under repair was flown to Bataan as the victorious Japanese were entering the city.

United States, 483 U.S. 350 (1987), was a case in which the United States Supreme Court decided that the federal statute criminalizing mail fraud applied only to the schemes and artifices defrauding victims of money or property, as opposed to those defrauding citizens of their rights to good government. The case was superseded one year later when the United States Congress amended the law to specifically include honest services fraud in the mail and wire fraud statutes. Background of case Julian Carroll became Governor of Kentucky in 1974; that same year, Howard P. Hunt became the chairman of the Kentucky Democratic Party. Kentucky purchased workmen's compensation insurance from Wombwell Insurance Agency; Hunt conspired with Robert Tabeling, the vice president of the insurance agency, to award the state's insurance business to Wombwell in exchange for kickbacks being sent to other insurance agencies specified by Hunt. $200,000 in kickbacks made it to Seton Investments, Inc., which was nominally headed by Charles McNally but actually run by Hunt and Carroll's Secretary of Public Protection and Regulation, James E. Gray. McNally received $75,500 for acting as frontman for Seton, while Hunt and Gray used the rest of the money to purchase condominiums in Florida and an automobile, among others. In 1983, Hunt, McNally, and Gray were indicted by a federal grand jury on charges of mail fraud for defrauding the citizens of Kentucky of \\"their right to have the Commonwealth's business and its affairs conducted honestly, impartially, free from corruption, bias, dishonesty, deceit, official misconduct, and fraud,\\" and of \\"money and other things of value,\\" using the United States mail. Hunt pleaded guilty to mail and tax fraud, and he was sentenced to three years in prison. Six of the eight charges against the defendants were dismissed before the trial, but they were convicted by a jury on the remaining two counts of conspiracy and fraud. Appeal McNally and Gray appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, arguing that Hunt's fraud, which they had been convicted of abetting, was not honest services fraud because he had no fiduciary duty to the people of Kentucky. The Sixth Circuit, noting Gray's fiduciary duty to the people of Kentucky as Secretary of Public Protection and Regulation, concluded that Hunt also had a fiduciary duty to the people of Kentucky as a de facto public official due to his substantial participation in governmental affairs and \\"de facto control\\" of the awarding of the insurance contract to Wombwell. The appellants also argued that their rights to due process of law were violated by the indictment, contending that it failed to allege that Hunt and Gray had a fiduciary duty to the citizens of Kentucky, a fact of which they necessarily had to be informed in order to understand the elements of the charges against them. The Sixth Circuit rejected this argument as well, stating that the indictment contained sufficient information for the defendants to be apprised of the charges, including the identification of the roles Hunt and Gray played in the conspiracy to defraud. The Sixth Circuit affirmed the convictions on May 12, 1986. The Supreme Court of the United States granted certiorari and reversed the decision of the lower court; the case was argued before the Court on April 22, 1987, and decided on June 24 of that year. Decision Majority Justice White wrote the opinion of the Court, holding that the federal mail fraud statute only protected money and property, not the public's intangible right to honest government: > Rather than construe the statute in a manner that leaves its outer > boundaries ambiguous and involves the Federal Government in setting > standards of disclosure and good government for local and state officials, > we read 1341 as limited in scope to the protection of property rights. If > Congress desires to go further, it must speak more clearly than it has. The law, passed in 1872 during a postal law recodification, originally only criminalized \\"any scheme or artifice to defraud.\\" In March 1909, Congress added another clause, reading \\"or for obtaining money or property by means of false or fraudulent pretenses, representations, or promises.\\" In McNally, the Court therefore concluded that Congress intended the mail fraud statute's scope to be limited to protecting money and property, citing its ruling in United States v. Universal C. I. T. Credit Corp., which stated that \\"when choice has to be made between two readings of what conduct Congress has made a crime, it is appropriate, before we choose the harsher alternative, to require that Congress should have spoken in language that is clear and definite. We should not derive criminal outlawry from some ambiguous implication.\\" The convictions of McNally and Gray were thus reversed. Dissent Justice Stevens wrote the dissenting opinion, arguing that \\"nothing in the words 'any scheme or artifice to defraud,' or in the purpose of the statute, justifies limiting its application to schemes intended to deprive victims of money or property.\\" See also * List of abrogated U.S. Supreme Court decisions * List of United States Supreme Court cases, volume 483 * List of United States Supreme Court cases * Lists of United States Supreme Court cases by volume * List of United States Supreme Court cases by the Rehnquist Court *Skilling v.

Pin (before 1910) Emilio Usiglio (18 January 1841 in Parma - 7 July 1910 in Milan) was an Italian composer and conductor. Life and career Usiglio studied music in Parma, first with Giuseppe Barbacini and then with Giovanni Rossi, before continuing his education in Pisa with Carlo Romani and in Florence with Teodulo Mabellini. At the age of 20 he began his operatic career with some success with La locandiera. He wrote exclusively opere buffe, his most famous being 1879's Le donne curiose after the play by Carlo Goldoni. As a conductor, Usiglio led the premiere, in 1875, of the new version of Arrigo Boito's Mefistofele in Bologna, and in 1877 he conducted the Italian premiere of Georges Bizet's Carmen in Naples and of Hamlet by Ambroise Thomas in Venice. In 1889 he led the first Modena performances of Fosca by Antonio Gomes. Due primarily to his increasing alcoholism, Usiglio was forced to retire as a conductor in 1897.Bowen (2003) pp. 155-156 He died in Milan in 1910. His wife was the soprano Clementina Brusa.

The film's title is a pun on the rating system used by critics to rank films, with \\"four stars\\" being the highest rating. Overview As opposed to Warhol's earlier sound films during this period, such as Vinyl, made in 1965, in which the camera, once turned on, was never stopped until the film ran out in one continuous take, Four Stars uses what critic Gene Youngblood dubbed \\"strobe cuts\\", created by turning the camera on and off during shooting, causing several overexposed or \\"whited-out\\" frames, to appear in the completed film, and an accompanying burst of sound on the film's soundtrack. However, apart from this \\"in-camera\\" editing, no other edits were made in the finished film; each reel, as in all of his films during this period, runs 1200 feet (366 m) in length. Warhol uses these \\"strobe cuts\\" as punctuation for the images in the film, which document Factory life during this period, and feature a cast of Warhol \\"superstars\\" including Edie Sedgwick, Ondine, Brigid Berlin, Viva, Nico, Mary Woronov, Gerard Malanga, Ultra Violet, Ruby Lynn Reyner, Taylor Mead, Joe Dallesandro (in his film debut), and others. Photographed entirely in color, Four Stars was projected in its complete length of nearly 25 hours (allowing for projection overlap of the 35-minute reels) only once, at the Film-Makers' Cinematheque in the basement of the now-demolished Wurlitzer Building at 125 West 41st Street in New York City. The imagery in the film is dense, wearying and beautiful, but ultimately hard to decipher, for, in contrast to his earlier, and more famous film Chelsea Girls, made in 1966, Warhol directed that two reels be screened simultaneously on top of each other on a single screen, rather than side-by- side. This created two levels of imagery for the entire running time of the film, along with two levels of sound to contend with at the same time. Warhol attended the screening for the entire length of the film, and later remarked that he knew that \\"this was the last time we would be making films for ourselves.\\" Shortly thereafter, Warhol turned his hand to more commercial efforts, and after his near fatal shooting at his second studio at 33 Union Square West by Valerie Solanas, Paul Morrissey effectively took over production of films produced under the Warhol banner. After the one marathon screening of Four Stars, the film was broken down into many shorter works, such as Imitation of Christ, and a two-hour excerpt from the film was shown for several weeks afterward under the same title at the Cinematheque, although it had little of the impact of the original film.

On 8 February 2009, the synagogue hosted a visit by Jonathan Sacks, the Chief Rabbi of the United Hebrew Congregations of the United Kingdom. The visit was arranged by Eric Moonman, the president of the Zionist Federation of Great Britain and Ireland. The synagogue closed in May 2012, as the community numbers had fallen below a viable congregation. The last service, conducted by Cantor Steven Robins LRCM, was held on 13 May 2012 accompanied by the Shabbaton Choir. The synagogue was packed for the occasion with many former members and children and grandchildren of congregants from previous years attending. The sermon was given by Rabbi Arnold Saunders of Manchester, a previous Minister. The last Minister of the synagogue was Rabbi David Braunold who assumed the pulpit in 1985 and departed for the St Anne's Hebrew Congregation in 2010.

It occurred during the Mexican Apache Wars on May 1, 1782, between a small garrison of Spanish soldiers and hundreds of Apache warriors. Background Presidio San Augustin del Tucson, or Fort Tucson, was a Spanish built fortress located in present day downtown Tucson, it was founded by Hugh O'Conor. The construction of the structure occurred from 1775 to 1783 and was used to protect communication and trade routes across northern Sonora and southern Alta California. The garrison on average consisted of forty to sixty cavalry, mostly of Sonoran descent. Though detribalized Pima native American scouts were also employed. Fort Tucson was primarily made of adobe bricks and wood from mesquite trees. At least one cannon and only a few officers also manned the position. Tucson was an isolated community during its earliest years, situated on the right side of the Santa Cruz River, next to a Pima pueblo, known as Indian Town, on the left side of the water, roughly northwest of Tucson. Between the village and presidio was a bridge, leading across the river. The area around the presidio jacals was fortified with a wide ditch roundabout filled with water and a palisade of logs, ordered to be constructed by commander Captain Pedro Allande y Saabedra, with two ramparts on which an unknown number of cannon were placed. Four bulwarks, magazines, a guard tower and a church were built as well. The walls spanned various heights from ten to almost thirty feet high and were built to be compact. There were two gates, one on the eastern wall and the other on the western wall. A stockade and then an earthen defensive wall surrounding the military buildings. Some of the houses, belonging to Tucson citizens or soldiers, were outside the palisade and were protected only by artillery. By 1782 the Spanish had been fighting a long war with the Apaches throughout the Tucson area. The garrison had already fought off an enemy attack in 1779, known as the First Battle of Tucson, at the edge of the town. In 1780 other small skirmishes between Spain and Apaches occurred near Tucson. Raids were also conducted by Apaches against wagon trains and other small unprotected convoys. However, Apache tactics changed in 1782 when they began to mass in larger numbers and attack heavily fortified or heavily protected settlements. A force of about 600 warriors headed for Tucson, retaliating for a recent Spanish campaign deep into Apache territory. After the battle, Captain Saabedra stated that the assault was carried out by the largest force of Apaches warriors he had ever seen. Battle At around 10:00 am on Sunday May 1, 1782, the Apaches began a surprise attack. The force was split in two and proceeded simultaneously to attack Indian Town and Fort Tucson itself with a clear intention of capturing the fort. Unfortunately for the Spaniards, most of the garrison was not present inside the fortification, a lot of whom were scattered across the town, preparing for Sunday mass. Several Jesuit missionaries were among the population of Tucson, one later reported that around 200 Apaches fought on foot and said he did not attempt to estimate the number mounted on horses. Fighting occurred at three main places, the first was at the bridge connecting Indian Town to Tucson, the second, at the western gate of the presidio, and the third near the western gate at Lieutenant Miguel de Urrea's home. A sketch of the Presidio chapel along the east wall of the Tucson Presidio. At the time, Spanish forces numbered forty- two lancers, twenty dragoons and ten native scouts, including officers. One Apache force first swarmed into Indian village from the north where they encountered little resistance before advancing on to the bridge. The other force headed directly for the citadel. At the bridge a small force of Spanish troops were capable of holding their position, due to superior weapons, muskets against bows and arrows. Meanwhile, the second Apache unit rushed for the open gate of Fort Tucson but the advance was halted by cannon and musket fire from Captain Allande and four of his men, positioned on the bridge above the gate. The attack also failed due to Lieutenant Urrea's position, on the roof of his parapet topped house, which flanked the Apache attack. Urrea and his native servant were later credited with delaying a force of over 140 Apaches from joining their main force for the capture of Fort Tucson. The holders of the bridge, who held against over 200 warriors, also were commended. After two hours of close quarters combat, the Apaches suffered eight confirmed deaths and dozens more severely wounded. Apaches were known for removing their dead and wounded from their battlefields, immediately after a casualty was sustained. Meaning it is likely that more than eight warriors died as result of the battle, either in the engagement or afterwards. The Spanish suffered one dead trooper and three wounded, one female civilian was also found to have been killed by the attackers. After seeing the deaths and wounding of so many warriors, the unknown Apache war chief ordered a retreat. Aftermath The eight Apache deaths were confirmed by the various reports of the battle, written by the garrison and by the Jesuits there. Other accounts say as many as thirty Apaches were killed during the action. Lieutenant Urrea personally killed or wounded at least five Apaches from the top of his house. His servant killed or wounded a few others. Captain Allande killed two men. One soldier, Jos√© Antonio Delgado, who hid in a tree from the beginning to the end of the battle, evading capture, later reported that he witnessed three killed Apaches, being removed from the field by their fellow warriors. He also reported that several Apache wounded were being carried off into the surrounding desert as well, casualties of cannon fire. The Spanish won the engagement but the Apaches would return again a few months later, on December 15, the Apaches raided some livestock, resulting in another Spanish victory and the deaths of a handful of warriors. Spanish records of the time indicate that only few Apaches were killed in overall campaigns. The largest Apache body counts never numbered more than fifty dead, most likely due to the Apache's evasion tactics.

Born in 1937, he joined Toyota Motor Corporation shortly after graduating from Nagoya University with a degree in engineering.Dawson, Chester (2004).Lexus: The Relentless Pursuit, pp. 57-61. John Wiley & Sons (Asia) Pte Ltd., Singapore. . By the time he was placed in charge of the Lexus development effort, otherwise known as the F1 project, Suzuki had amassed 25 years of experience at the firm in multiple areas of vehicle development. Suzuki's brainchild, the LS 400, launched in 1989, laying the groundwork for the successful debut of the Lexus marque. Early life Suzuki was born in Tokyo in 1937. Before 1941, his family had moved to the town of Tsushima, Aichi, outside Nagoya, where his father took a job at the Nisshin Flour Milling Company. In school, Suzuki proved to be a gifted student, finding schoolwork easy, particularly in the field of mathematics. As he grew older, he developed a disinterest in school lessons, leading to a pattern of truancy. Unknown to Suzuki until his high school reunion years later, his mother persuaded a teacher to excuse his absences, allowing him to graduate and enroll in Nagoya University. Career Following graduation, Suzuki applied for a job at Toyota Motor Corporation, which had its headquarters in Nagoya. Suzuki was initially assigned to vehicle body assembly despite a professed interested in engines. Over the years, Suzuki was mentored by senior department members, and worked with teams from numerous company departments. In 1983, company chairman Eiji Toyoda initiated the F1 project, a plan to create a brand-new luxury sedan which would challenge the top models from Mercedes-Benz and BMW. Engineers Ichir≈ç Suzuki and Shoji Jimbo were initially selected to head the development effort in 1984. Ichir≈ç Suzuki headed the development of the Lexus LS 400 In 1985, Suzuki sent a team of engineers to New York and California to determine the expectations of luxury consumers. His team developed a set of key criteria that their new sedan had to achieve in order to be successful in the luxury market. Suzuki also developed a series of \\"no-compromise goals\\", which were seemingly contradictory or mutually exclusive design targets (e.g. high top speed yet low fuel consumption). These goals became known as \\"Lexus Musts\\" which have since been used as benchmark standards for vehicle development within Lexus. As chief engineer, Suzuki ensured that the completed LS 400 sedan met each of the design criteria, intended to exceed rival vehicles in key aspects. The 1989 launch of Suzuki's biggest project, the Lexus LS, proved to be a major success, with the sedan outselling rival flagship models within its first year on the market. With this achievement, Suzuki gained legendary status within the company as the \\"Michael Jordan of chief engineers.\\" In 2000, Suzuki was honored with the title of gikan, or executive advisory engineer, and mentored other Lexus engineers before retiring in 2003.Dawson 2004, p. 139.

He was attached to the RAF (successor to the RFC), and posted to No. 32 Squadron RAF. From July 22 through August 29, 1918, he destroyed four Fokker D.VII fighters and drove down three others out of control. On September 1, he was shot down by Theodor Quandt and captured. The following day, he and another prisoner escaped and tried to steal a German two-seater for a flying exit. Donaldson received a bayonet wound in the back struggling with a sentry, and the refugee duo fled. On September 9, they were caught swimming a stream in no man's land, and re-incarcerated.

Singling out one of the hostile machines Lieutenant Donaldson engaged it from behind, firing a short burst at close range, the plane bursting into flames and crashing to the ground. On August 8, 1918, he engaged 5 enemy scout planes over Licourt, France; singling out one and diving on it, he opened fire at close range, causing it to crash to the ground. On August 9, 1918, over Licourt, France, observing a British plane being attacked by three enemy scout planes, he immediately engaged one of the enemy, firing a long burst at very close range, the enemy plane bursting into flames and crashing to the ground. On August 25, 1918, over Hancourt, France, he attacked four Fokker enemy planes, diving into their midst and firing a short burst at one of them from a short range, destroying the plane, the pilot of which descended to safety in a parachute. On July 25, 1918, over Fismes, France, he drove down out of control an enemy Fokker plane; on August 10, over Perrone, France, one Fokker biplane; and on August 29 over Cambria, France, one Fokker biplane. In all these engagements Lieutenant Donaldson displayed the greatest devotion to duty and gallantry in the face of the enemy. (General Orders No. 13, W.D., 1924) Distinguished Flying Cross (DFC) For gallantry. On July 22, 1918, Lt. Donaldson, when on a patrol, attacked a formation of 20 Fokker biplanes over Mont-Notre-Dame. He singled out one of the hostile machines and engaged it from behind, firing a short burst at close range. The EA side-slipped to the right and then to the left, finally bursting into flames and crashing. On August 8, he engaged five enemy scouts over Licourt. He singled out one and diving on it from behind, opened fire at very close range. The EA immediately went into a straight dive and crashed into the ground between Licourt and Morchain, becoming a total wreck. On August 9, he observed a British machine being attacked by three hostile scouts over Licourt. He immediately flew to the scene of the encounter and engaged one of the EA, firing a long burst at very close range. Almost at once a white stream of escaping petrol was observed and a little later the EA burst into flames. On August 25, he attacked, single handed, four Fokker biplanes over Hancourt, diving into their midst and firing a short burst into one machine at close range. The EA went down in a side-slip dive and having fallen about 2,000 feet the left wing broke off. The pilot descended in a parachute and shortly after leaving the machine the other wing was observed to crumple up. In addition to the above this officer has driven down out of control three enemy machines as follows: July 25, 1918, one Fokker biplane over Fismes; August 10,, one Fokker biplane over P√©ronne; August 29,, one Fokker biplane over Cambrai. 2nd Lt. Donaldson also did magnificent work attacking ground targets with machine gun fire and bombs during the recent retreat on the Somme in August. He invariably showed the greatest devotion to duty and gallantry in the face of the enemy.

The 193rd overall episode of the series, it originally aired on Comedy Central in the United States on November 4, 2009. In the episode, the boys attempt to change the official definition of the word \\"fag\\" from an anti-homosexual slur to a term describing loud and obnoxious Harley bikers. The episode was written and directed by series co- creator Trey Parker, and was rated TV-MA L in the United States. \\"The F Word\\" argues language is ever-changing and that taboo words only carry a stigma if society allows them to, and attempts to reclaim and disempower the word \\"faggot\\". \\"The F Word\\" received generally mixed reviews, with commentators differing on the success behind the episode's underlying message. According to Nielsen ratings, \\"The F Word\\" was seen by 1.99 million households among viewers aged between 18 and 49, making it the highest rated episode of the season, and surpassing the viewership of the NBC primetime comedy talk show, The Jay Leno Show.  Plot  Kyle, Cartman, Stan, and Kenny enjoy a nice day outside with the weather being warm until a large group of Harley riders disturb them. The residents of South Park are frustrated by a large group of Harley riders frequently making noise in town. The Harley riders eat lunch and talk about how nobody is paying attention to them, so one of the Harley riders comes up with a noise to get everyone's attention. Before the Harley riders take off, Cartman confronts the bikers, describing them as insecure losers who ride loud motorcycles to draw attention to themselves. Cartman tells them their behavior makes them look like \\"fags\\" and, when other children begin referring to the bikers with the same slur, the bikers assume they are being insulted because they are not being loud enough. They believe that they should be louder because after all, children are around loud stuff today. The motorcyclists equip their motorcycles with horns, sirens and various musical instruments. The boys devise a plan to rid the town of the bikers. However, once Butters reveals that he likes Harley motorcycles, he is not allowed to participate in the scheme. As the riders eat at a diner, Cartman defecates on the seats of their motorcycles while Kyle and Stan spray paint \\"FAGS GET OUT\\" on several buildings around town. The boys are pleased when the bikers temporarily leave town, but the graffiti alarms Big Gay Al and Mr. Slave because they interpret it as homophobia. The boys readily admit to the spray painting, and explain to the city council that the word \\"fag\\" is not intended as an insult to homosexuals, and is being used only in reference to a contemptible person who rides a Harley motorcycle, or \\"an inconsiderate douchebag\\", as Stan puts it. They call upon the council to formally recognize this new usage. Support from the town, including the local gay community, results in a town ordinance declaring a change in the word's definition. This action leads to negative publicity from the rest of the nation, and further angers the displaced bikers who refuse to be labeled as \\"fags\\". They look up the word in the dictionary and learn its definition has adapted over the years: it previously meant \\"an unpleasant old woman\\" and a bundle of sticks. Upset by the national attention, Mayor McDaniels wants to resolve the situation, and the boys suggest getting the official dictionary definition updated. The town invites the English Dictionary Officiates, led by the head editor, former child actor Emmanuel Lewis, to review the proposal and consider making the definition change official. As the town celebrates the arrival of Lewis and the Officiates, the bikers suddenly crash the event and begin to riot. After inflicting damage to the town and scaring off the citizens, they corner the boys in an alley. The bikers demand they stop being called \\"fags\\", but the boys refuse to do so, asserting their behavior further justifies the application of the term. Butters steps between them and comes to the defense of the riders by expressing his admiration for the Harley-Davidson lifestyle. Confronted by gun-wielding residents led by Big Gay Al, the riders ultimately accept their new label, and Lewis is happy to declare the definition officially changed. The town rejoices and celebrates. Production \\"The F Word\\" was written and directed by series co-founder Trey Parker, and was rated TV-MA L in the United States. It first aired on November 4, 2009 in the United States on Comedy Central. The day after \\"The F Word\\" was originally broadcast, T-shirts and hooded sweatshirts based on the episode were made available at South Park Studios, the official South Park website. It featured Butters standing in front of a motorcycle, standing above the word \\"bike-curious?\\"  Theme  \\"The F Word\\" advocates a philosophy that language is malleable and ever-changing, and that the idea of taboo words are only assigned their stigma because society allows them to become so. The word \\"fag\\" is used casually and extremely frequently by the characters throughout the episode, and Comedy Central agreed not to censor the word. The characters use the word \\"fag\\" very frequently throughout the episode as an attempt to insult the Harley bikers. Although LGBT activists acknowledged the noble intentions behind the episode, the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD) objected to \\"The F Word\\", stating the episode still uses the word in a very derogatory context, even though it is directed against bikers instead of homosexuals. As a result, GLAAD said \\"The F Word\\" still reinforced the usage of the word \\"fag\\" as a means of insulting others, and could be unintentionally harmful to the gay community. GLAAD officials called it a \\"slur-filled episode\\" and demanded an apology from South Park creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone. Comedy Central declined to respond to the comments.  Cultural references  \\"The F Word\\" makes prominent use of Harley-Davidson, the largest motorcycle manufacturing company in the United States. Also featured in the episode is Emmanuel Lewis, a former child actor who is portrayed as the head editor of the dictionary. This is a reference to Webster's Dictionary and Lewis' most famous role, the title character in the sitcom, Webster. During one scene, a television reporter repeatedly refers to a Harley biker as a \\"fag\\" until he attacks the camera. This is a reference to an on-air confrontation between NFL quarterback Jim Everett and sports talk show host Jim Rome, whom Everett attacked during a Talk2 interview. In the scene where Emmanuel Lewis arrives at South Park, the music played by the orchestra is Pomp & Circumstance March No. 1 in D Major by Sir Edward Elgar. In the scene where the Harley riders drive past the church, Father Maxey holds up a sign that says ‚ÄúGod hates fags‚Äù. This a reference to Westboro Baptist Church, who frequently uses the phrase on signs at their protests.  Reception  \\"The F Word\\" was the highest rated episode of the thirteenth season of South Park. The episode was seen by 1.99 million households in the subgroup of adults between the ages of 18 and 49. The episode earned a higher rating than that of The Jay Leno Show, a primetime late night talk show on NBC. \\"The F Word\\" was considered particularly controversial, even by South Park standards due to the excessive use of the word \\"fag\\". The episode received generally mixed reviews. Carlos Delgado of iF magazine said \\"The F Word\\" marks a return of South Park's tradition of tackling sensitive social issues with intelligent and politically incorrect writing, which Delgado said had been lacking in recent episodes. Delgado said \\"The F Word\\" served as a reminder that society is always changing and that although the thoughts or intentions behind words are harmful, the word itself is not. Ramsey Isler of IGN compared \\"The F Word\\" to \\"With Apologies to Jesse Jackson\\", an eleventh season episode that contained frequent use of the racial slur \\"nigger\\". However, Isler said \\"The F Word\\" was not as skillfully crafted as the \\"Jesse Jackson\\" episode and, although some moments were entertaining, the episode \\"had a habit of running some gags into the ground\\". James Hibberd, of The Live Feed, said he found the episode \\"well-intended and funny\\", and that it forced viewers to face a difficult issue and reexamine their beliefs about it. Hibberd wrote, \\"This is also, by the way, precisely what great art does\\". Genevieve Koski of The A.V. Club said the word \\"fag\\" has not lost its associations with homosexuals, so she did not believe in the episode's statements about the changing use of the word. Koski also called the episode \\"preachy\\", and said, \\"It took too long to get going, seemed confused about what its point was, and, most egregiously, had very few laughs.\\" Home release \\"The F Word\\", along with the thirteen other episodes from South Park's thirteenth season, were released on a three-disc DVD set and two-disc Blu-ray set in the United States on March 16, 2010. The sets included brief audio commentaries by Parker and Stone for each episode, a collection of deleted scenes, and a special mini-feature Inside Xbox: A Behind-the-Scenes Tour of South Park Studios, which discussed the process behind animating the show with Inside Xbox host Major Nelson.

The Movement organises conferences exhibitions, media reports, lectures, commemorative ceremonies, and vigils to educate the public and to combat growing neo-Nazist Holocaust denial, ethnic tension, and discrimination guided by the example provided by Wallenberg. Beginning in 1993, the RWIMH petitioned the government of Canada to honour Raoul Wallenberg. The Canadian Parliament declared January 17 Raoul Wallenberg Day in 2001, having received the support of, among others, Members of Parliament Clifford Lincoln, Irwin Cotler, and Sheila Copps, and Senator Sheila Finestone. Some of the RWIMH‚Äôs other work and accomplishments include: Raoul Wallenberg Square (and monument), Teaching Guide (available from the RWIMH website), ‚ÄúSearch for the Truth‚Äù (an international conference investigating Wallenberg‚Äôs imprisonment), annual conferences, meetings, and exhibitions, The Wallenberg Bulletin, RWIMH Certificate of Honour, Raoul Wallenberg Archives (compiled research pertaining to Wallenberg), and the planting of a grove in Jerusalem.Vera Parnes (2006). \\"15th Anniversary (1991‚Äì2006\\".

The RWIMH is currently preparing to honour Nobel Peace Prize Laureate Andrei Sakharov later this year, and to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the declaration of Canada‚Äôs first honorary citizen, Raoul Wallenberg, next year.

Built in 1879, it is one of Maine's finest examples of Stick style architecture. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978. Description and history The former All Souls Church building is located in central Augusta, at the northwest corner of Oak and State Streets. It is a two-story wood frame structure, with a gabled roof, clapboarded exterior, and granite foundation. A square tower projects from the State Street side, now consisting of two relatively plain stages separated by a skirt of roofing. The State Street facade is visually complex, with gabled entrances in the tower and at the north end, and a small cross gable between, with applied woodwork above a pair of tall sash windows. The Oak Street facade has a pair of large sash windows, framed by similar applied trim which rises to a point in the gable above, with a square carved panel at its point, and another elaborate panel mounted at the peak of the gable.Beard, Frank; Bradley, Robert (1977); NRHP nomination for All Souls Church; available by request from the Maine SHPO The church was built in 1879 for a Unitarian congregation established in 1825 by a division of older congregations, and was its third home. It was designed by Thomas Silloway, a native of Newburyport, Massachusetts whose most prominent work is the Vermont State House. It is a particularly fine example of Stick style architecture, a style that is not widespread in Maine. In 1987, the building was purchased by the River Rock congregation, which occupied it until 2008, when it moved to Chelsea.

He began teaching at Yale in 1991. Teaching career Weinberg was on the faculty of Yale's Department of the History of Art from 1989-2001, and has since been a John Simon Guggenheim fellow, a Mills fellow at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, a Sterling fellow at the Clark Art Institute, and scholar and artist-in-residence at the Getty. Paintings His paintings have been the subject of over twenty one-person shows, and are in the permanent collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Reader's Digest Collection, as well as other museums and private collections. Writing for the catalogue (Amusements, Paintings and Prints by Jonathan Weinberg) of Weinberg's 1997 show at New York's Cortland Jessup Gallery, his former co-student at Yale Vincent Scully wrote: Published work Weinberg has published widely. Linda Nochlin, writing about Weinberg's Ambition and Love in Modern American Art (Yale, 2001) in Art in America, called it \\"one of the best books on American art of any period that I have ever read,\\" \\"an exemplary text,\\" and \\"rare that such a perfect fit between style and substance occurs in the writing of an art historian.\\" Nochlin and others have noted that Weinberg's work is cogent while being extremely well written and researched; with none of the theory or jargon that has turned so many away from the academy.

Description and history Christ Episcopal Church is located in central Gardiner, on the east side the town common and the junction of Church and Dresden Streets. It is a rectangular stone structure with a square tower projecting from the center of the front (west- facing) facade. The main roof has flat wings and a gabled center, and is surrounded by low battlement-style crenellations. The square portion of the tower is topped by similar crenellations, with an octagonal spire above. The front facade has entrances in the tower and the flanking sections, set in lancet-arched openings. Above each is a Gothic window with tracery, that in the tower considerably larger. The side elevations each have three tall Gothic windows. The church in 2012 The Episcopal Church in Gardiner was organized in 1772 by Sylvester Gardiner, a major landowner for whom the city is named. This building, constructed in 1820, is its third sanctuary, the first having succumbed to fire in 1792, and the congregation having outgrown the second. It was designed by the Rev. Samuel Farmer Jarvis in what was then termed the \\"Gothick\\" style, which was then without precedent in New England.

A classically trained sculptor, her process involves building complex metal armatures to support massive amounts of clay. Cavener is best known for her fantastical animal figures, which embody the complexity of human emotion and behavior. Cavener addresses controversial subject matter head on and in direct opposition to the reputation of her chosen medium, clay. The artist focuses her sculpture on human psychology, stripped of context and rationalization, and articulated through animal forms. As she states, \\"on the surface, these figures are simply feral animals suspended in a moment of tension. Beneath the surface, they embody the consequences of human fear, apathy, aggression, and misunderstanding\\".Shnabel, J.L. \\"Veiled Lures: The Sculptures of Beth Cavener Stichter\\". Hi-Fructose Magazine Vol. 16: 39. Her process is very physical, involving thousands of pounds clay sculpted using her whole body. Her work has earned many awards, and is exhibited in private galleries and public museums throughout the United States. Biography Cavener was born in 1972 in Pasadena, California. Her father is a molecular biologist, and inspired Cavener to study science up until college. She would work in his lab in the summers, and says that she aspired to a career as an academic scientist. Her mother, Nancy Jacobsohn, a sculptor and an art teacher, taught Cavener how to work with clay starting at an early age. Cavener went on to pursue her studies in physics and astronomy at Haverford College in Pennsylvania. In her 3rd year, she traveled to Florence, Italy, where she attended the Cecil Academy of Art. Upon returning, Cavener suspended her studies in astrophysics in order to focus on incorporating her diverse interests with a major Fine Art. She received her BA in Sculpture in 1995. alt=Title: \\"The Question That Devours\\" Year: 2012 Dimensions: H 64 x W 35 x D 25 in.

Materials: Stoneware, paint Installation: Wall Piece Cavener would spend the next few years honing her artistic style and research through a series of apprenticeships and fellowships in Nashville, Tennessee and at the Charles H. Cecil Studios in Florence, Italy. Trained in the classical atelier style throughout her studies, Cavener became restless with the more traditional methods of sculpting and casting, focused exclusively on the human form. Returning to the raw material of clay, Cavener began developing a method of working solid on increasingly complex armatures that allowed her to explore more complex gestures. Cavener spent four years in Columbus, Ohio, independently developing her work and searching for a conceptual link to her interest human psychology and social structures. Cavener enrolled in graduate school at The Ohio State University, where she received her Master's in Fine Arts degree in ceramics between 2000 and 2002. Her thesis exhibition, \\"tremble shiver,\\" made the transition from working with the human figure to using human-scaled portrayals of the animal body to express human emotion and psychological portraits. After receiving her MFA, Cavener spent two years as a resident artist at the Archie Bray Foundation for the Ceramic Arts from 2000-2002, and then completed a brief Guest Artist residency at The Clay Studio in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania in 2004. She then traveled for residencies in Jingdezhen, China (2008), La Meridiana, Certaldo, Italy (2012), and at the Shigaraki Ceramic Cultural Park in Shigaraki, Japan (2013). Cavener opened the exhibition, \\"The Other\\", in November 2017, with 5 new major pieces. In addition to her full-time studio practice, Cavener opened a group professional studio space in 2014 under the name Studio 740 in Helena, MT. in order to mentor and support young emerging artists. She is vocal about the lack of funding for young artists, and has completed two successful crowd- funding initiatives, one in partnership with United States Artists (USA) in 2011 and another self-directed initiative using Patreon, to support the artists in residence of Studio 740. alt=\\"Limerence\\" 2017 from the exhibition \\"The Other\\" 44 in. length, 22 in. height, 16 in. width Stoneware, Paintthumb\\"Limerence\\" 2017 from the exhibition \\"The Other\\" 44 in. length, 22 in. height, 16 in. width Stoneware, Paint Work alt=Title: \\"Trapped\\" Year: 2015 Dimensions: Figure: H 21 x L 37 x D 22 in.

Materials: Stoneware, paint, 18 k gold, rope, wood Cavener's sculptures are large and dynamic, evoking fear and anxiety that is distinctly human even though it is presented through animal forms. The body language of these animal forms are metaphors for how humans think and feel, and they act as a psychological portrait more than a physical representation. In 2008, Cavener joined the Claire Oliver Gallery, where she opened a show called \\"On Tender Hooks\\" on October 22, 2009. In 2010, she had a show entitled \\"The Four Humors,\\" inspired by the ancient Greek notion of being able to characterize one's personality by which \\"humor\\" they possessed in excess. Her last show with Claire Oliver, \\"Come Undone,\\" was displayed in the fall of 2012. Her work is owned by many public collections, including the Honolulu Museum of Art, the Arizona State University Art Museum (Tempe), the Chazen Museum of Art (Madison, Wisconsin), the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, the Northwest Museum of Arts and Culture (Spokane, Washington), the Racine Art Museum (Racine, Wisconsin), the Smithsonian American Art Museum (Washington DC), and the Tennessee State Museum (Nashville). She has promised gifts to the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Museum of Art and Design, both in New York City, New York. Process Cavener's usual working method is building solid sculptures on metal armatures, often with 2,000 or more pounds of clay at a time, then cutting the piece into 30-160 sections, hollowing out each section out to 1/4\\" thickness, and reassembling the pieces before firing. In order to work on a larger scale, the reassembled hollow pieces are then cut again to fit inside the kiln, fired, and then reassembled with glues and epoxies. (A slideshow of this process can be seen on her website under the Materials and Techniques section). She usually paints the surface with flat interior latex paint. This allows her to fill in seams after reassembly and maintain the look and feel of clay. She has also uses the technique terra sigillata , or \\"sealed earth,\\" which is how she achieves the luminous surface of her sculptures. alt=\\"A Second Kind of Loneliness\\" 2009 from the exhibititon \\"On Tender Hooks\\" Dimensions: H 64 x W 117 x D 22 in.

Materials: Stoneware, paint, paper pinwheel, internal mechanical breathing device Cavener shapes her stoneware animals in unexpected, and human-like, poses. Her \\"A Second Kind of Loneliness\\" from 2009, in the collection of the Honolulu Museum of Art, is an example of this. The hollow sculpture contains an internal mechanical breathing device that animates the pinwheel. By using this pinwheel mechanism, Cavener is able create an illusion of animation, which is why her sculptures seem to be suspended in a burst of activity. For \\"Come Undone,\\" her 2012 show at the Claire Oliver Gallery, she explored mixed media, including handmade doilies for \\"The White Hind\\" and sugar crystals for \\"The Adoration.\\" \\"Each piece in the show is a self-portrait representing different aspects of the artist's femininity.\\"Come Undone: the Sculptures of Beth Cavener Stichter.

Projects range from new buildings to additions to remodels. The company works in markets including health care, corporate offices, financial, education, industrial, retail, religious, governmental and agricultural.MLive Article Serenus Johnson History Serenus Johnson arrived to the United States in 1912 at the age of 17, following in the footsteps of his sister and five brothers who preceded him to America. Soon after his arrival he joined his brothers working on the freighters that sailed the Great Lakes. When his new country became involved in World War I, Serenus took a job as a riveter in a plant that was building boats for the war effort. In 1919, he founded his construction company, providing various general contracting services in the Bay City area. The construction company weathered the Great Depression, growing from Bay City to the surrounding communities. The material and labor shortages of World War II were difficult on the construction business, but the end of the war started a building boom across America, including Mid-Michigan. The company benefited from this and built many schools and churches during the late 1940s and 1950s. When the youngest son, Raymond, joined the company, Serenus Johnson proudly added, ‚Äúand Son‚Äù to its name. Serenus had four brothers and a son-in-law that worked for him over the many years, with both the son-in-law and one brother staying with the company until their retirements. As the 1960s began, the company continued to grow by offering different types of construction, expanding into other communities and working with new markets. Serenus retired in 1962 and Raymond continued to operate the company until he retired in 1996. Tom Johnson, Raymond‚Äôs son, joined the company in 1982 and served as President until 2015.

In 1993 the game was converted to Amiga and Atari ST. Gameplay In The Ancient Art of War in the Skies, the player plays either the British or German forces in World War I. In this air combat simulation, the player makes aerial assaults against opponents such as Lord Kitchener, Ferdinand Foch, Kaiser Wilhelm II, fictional enemy Helmut von Spike, or even Sun Tzu. The game acts in two dimensions. In the first one the player spends most of its time on the overhead map. They can plan the strategy and set the goals and routes for aircraft. In the second one, when the aircraft reaches its destination, the game switches to an arcade section. There are also two: a side-scrolling dog fights where the goal is to destroy the enemy aircraft shooting at them and overhead bombings where the player has to release bombs at the marked targets. Arcade sequences can be skipped and dealt by computer's calculations based on different variables. Reception The game was reviewed in 1993 in Dragon #190 by Hartley, Patricia, and Kirk Lesser in \\"The Role of Computers\\" column. The reviewers gave the game 3 out of 5 stars.

After a force under Mariposa County Sheriff James Burney was found unequal to the task of defeating the Natives, Burney made an appeal to Governor John McDougal for help. This led to authorizing an organization of two hundred men into the Mariposa Battalion. The Mariposa Battalion was mustered 12 February 1851. Sheriff Burney was the first choice for the major to command the unit, but Burney declined due to his other responsibilities in Mariposa. James D. Savage was then chosen as major, primarily due to his scouting abilities. The battalion was divided into three companies: Company A commanded by John J.

The tune peaked at No. 38 on the Mainstream Rock chart. The song was a collaboration between band leader Phil Lynott and Darren Wharton who had joined the band as a keyboard player in 1980. Angel of Death was premiered live in August 1981 when its lyrics were rather different from the later released versions.Lorelei, Rockpalast German TV, 29 August 1981 The opening number of Thin Lizzy's live set during the Renegade world tour of 1981/2 when it heralded the band on stage with the sound of air-raid sirens, Angel of Death was also an integral part of the Thunder and Lightning live set in 1983.

Lynott, Downey, Gorham, Wharton, Sykes Included on the Life album 5:56 The guitar solo on all three versions is by Scott Gorham.  Background  The song was inspired by a book about the Prophesies of Nostradamus that Phil Lynott was reading. \\"It's a very popular book in France now. Recently its sales have picked up because of the depression and because of the Cold War. He said that an Angel of Death would come and create a holocaust which everybody considers to be a nuclear war.\\"Phil Lynott interview, Rock On, BBC Radio 1 28 November 1981 \\"I'd just finished reading the Prophesies of Nostradamus and I thought it would be a good idea to write about that. So I picked two great disasters that he prophesied and I gave the talking piece where I ask people do they believe it. Then I talk about a personal trajedy - a person watching his father die - a personal disaster and basically the Angel of Death coming down to destroy the world or to take you to hell. It isn't full of humour and life is it?\\"Phil Lynott interview, Capitol Radio, 26 November 1981  Reaction  The track stood out on the Renegade album as a hard rocker in contrast to the other softer, more diverse tracks. However, it was not universally popular, even in the band. Scott Gorham has said: \\"I hated that song Angel of Death, even the title. C'mon, are we getting corny again? F‚Ä¢‚Ä¢king hell.\\" However, later guitarist John Sykes cited it as a reason he joined the band: \\"Did you hear the Renegade album? The band seemed to be losing the track of the rock feel of everything. Apart from the first track. Angel of Death was the best track.\\"John Sykes interviewed on Radio Clyde, 1982 Covers It has been covered by death metal group Vader and power metal group Gamma Ray.

Description and history The First Baptist Church is located in the center of Waterville, at the northwest corner of Park and Elm Streets. It is a two-story wood frame structure, with a gabled roof, clapboard siding, and a granite foundation. It is basically rectangular in plan, with a projecting entry vestibule, and a vestry addition to the rear. The building's facade is ornately decorated, with paneled corner pilasters rising to bracketed eaves. Windows are narrow sash, separated between floors by panels, with moulded hoods above the second-floor windows. A tower rises above the main roof, with a square stage rising to an octagonal louvered belfry and then a steeple with flared base. The Baptist congregation in Waterville was established in 1818 by Rev. Jeramiah Chaplin, and at first met in the town's meeting house. In 1824 the congregation began fundraising to build its own church, which resulted in construction of the present building two years later. In 1875, the building was renovated in the latest Victorian styles to a design by Portland-based Francis H. Fassett, then one of the state's leading architects.

Established in 1880 by Elias Kent, it is unusual for its layout of concentric rings around a central monument, only known in one other cemetery in the state, the Wing Family Cemetery in nearby Wayne. The cemetery was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2008. Description and history The Kent Burying Ground is located in what is now a rural part of Fayette, where Fayette Corner Road bends from west to north, and Oak Hill Road continues east. The cemetery is located just northeast of this threeway junction, occupying a rectangular parcel of slightly more than one-third of an acre. It is laid out as a series of concentric circular paths, separated by earthen berms retained by low granite walls, on which the grave markers are placed. At the center of the cemetery is a memorial marker labeled \\"Kent\\", which serves not as a burial marker but as the cemetery's focal point. The cemetery is ringed by an original cast-iron picket fence, with a gate supported by slender granite posts and topped by an arch. Marked graves date from 1833 to the 21st century. The cemetery was established about 1880 by Elias Kent, who was from a local family. At the time, Fayette Corner was the civic hub of the rural community. It is unclear why Kent chose the unusual layout. It is reminiscent of the rural cemetery style which was popular in urbanized areas during the mid-to-late 19th century, albeit on a much smaller scale. Kent may have been influenced by the Wing Family Cemetery, about five miles away in Wayne, which was established in 1867 and has a nearly identical plan.

Subsequently, Krafft also began making embroidered ceramic replicas of guns. Since 1991, Krafft's work has been exhibited in galleries throughout the United States and Europe, and has been published in magazines including Harper's, ArtForum and The New Yorker. In 1995, Krafft received a grant jointly from the National Endowment for the Arts, the Citizens Exchange Council, and the Soros Foundation to accompany the Slovenian band Laibach and its associated arts collective, Neue Slowenische Kunst, on their \\"Occupied Europe: NATO\\" tour in Yugoslavia, where the Bosnian War was just ending.Reid, Larry.

He was appointed the tour's official photographer, and was present for their historic concert in Sarajevo in December 1995, when the city was still under siege by the Serbs.

This led to a great deal of controversy in the art world, in which Krafft's occasional use of the swastika, and imagery related to the Second World War, had always been perceived as \\"darkly ironic.\\" Some, such as Adam Parfrey of Feral House, came to his defense, while The Globe and Mail in Toronto claimed that Krafft's personal beliefs should not be allowed to affect perceptions of his art. In March 2013 a piece in The New Yorker analyzed the development of Krafft's views and speculated about their relationship to his art. In 2015 Charles Krafft created a ceramic bust of the Horror/Science fiction writer H. P. Lovecraft. The bust of Lovecraft looks similar to Krafft's earlier busts of Adolf Hitler (as a teapot) and Charles Manson. Krafft spent the last years of his life trying to make a mark with white nationalist art and politics. After being diagnosed with cancer in 2018, Krafft spent the next two years in painful treatments and reoccurrences before the cancer ended his life in 2020.

Aamir Younis is the executive director of the organization. The other three stayed open but had to close their residential facilities and now serve 150 children and youths up to the age of 24. They provide rehabilitation services and basic skills training for youngsters who are not able to attend regular school.

Built in 1807, it is one of the oldest surviving buildings in the town, and an important element in the early life and spiritual growth of Quaker writer Rufus Jones. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. Description and history The Pond Meeting House stands about north of the village of South China, on the east side of United States Route 202. It is set near the road, just south of the main entrance to the Friends Camp, on whose grounds it is located. It is a modest 1-1/2 story wood frame structure, with gabled roof and clapboarded exterior. A cross-gabled vestibule projects from one of the long sides, with a pair of entrances flanking a sash window, with a second sash window in the gable. The building has simple trim; the doors have modest cornices above. The interior of the building consists of a single large chamber, which was originally filled with pews and divided into two sections by a shutter mechanism; both the pews and shutters have been removed, and one portion of the chamber has been walled off to form a kitchen. The meeting house was built in 1807, and is one of China's oldest surviving buildings. It was here that Rufus Jones, born and raised in South China, attended Quaker services. He would have been exposed to the teachings of important itinerant Quaker teachers here until the South China Meeting House was built closer to the Jones' home. When listed on the National Register in 1983, it was in use as part of a religious summer camp. Today the meeting house is in use by Friends Camp, the Quaker camp under the care of New England Yearly Meeting of Friends. When the camp was founded in 1953, the meeting house was the only building, used for eating, sleeping, and worship. As the camp has grown and transformed, daily worship was moved to a larger building and the meeting house became the arts building.

In 1895 it was restyled in the Shingle style, with a portico and tower added, and converted to non-denomination use by the Oak Grove-Coburn School (since closed). The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1977. Description and history The Oak Grove Chapel stands in a rural area north of Vassalboro's village center, at the northeast corner of US 201 and Oak Grove Road. The campus of the Maine Criminal Justice Academy, formerly that of the Oak Grove-Coburn School, lies just east of, and across Oak Grove Road, from the chapel. It is a single-story short-legged T-shaped wood frame structure, with gabled roofs and a square tower rising from one of the T's corners. The exterior is almost entirely shingled, with rounded arches predominating as an architectural detail, from the main entrance portico on the right to the semicircular floral panel on the end of the T, and the secondary entrance to its left. The tower rises to an open belvedere with round-arch openings, and is topped by a pyramidal roof. with The area that became Vassalboro was settled in the 1770s by a group of Quakers from Nantucket. The core of the present chapel was built in 1786 to serve as their meetinghouse, and later became the site of quarterly regional meetings. To provide for the education of their children, the Quakers also established the Oak Grove School, which merged with Waterville's Coburn Classical Institute in 1970 and closed in 1989. With enrollment in the church declining, its meetinghouse was formally deeded to the school in 1895, which used it as a non-denominational chapel. It was at that time given extensive alteration, designed by William H. Douglas and funded by Sophia D. Bailey. During the school's ownership it was known as the Sophia D. Bailey Memorial Chapel.

Background Various news sources suggest Chaleo was born in central Thailand at some point between 1922 and 1932. The New York Times notes that three birthdates have been put forward by different sources: \\"The Nation, a Thai newspaper, reported that he was 90, while several other news media outlets in Thailand said he was 88. Forbes recently put his age at 80.\\" BBC News states, \\"Mr Chaleo was born of poor Chinese immigrant parents in the northern province of Phichit, reportedly in 1932, local media say\\". The Australian and Time say he was 89. The Telegraph and The Independent say he was born in 1923 to a poor Thai-Chinese family that raised ducks and traded fruit in Phichit.

The bulls are not cattle, but wild gaur, a bovine species native to Southeast Asia and called krathing (‡∏Å‡∏£‡∏∞‡∏ó‡∏¥‡∏á) in Thai.

Built in 1884 as a Quaker meeting house, it is now home to multi-denominational congregation. It is notable as one of the places that influenced Quaker writer Rufus Jones, who was raised in South China and attended services here after this building replaced the Pond Meeting House. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. Description and history The South China Community Church is located in the center of South China village, on the north side of Village Street. It is a rambling single-story structure, whose most prominent feature is a square tower that has a louvered belfry and pyramidal top. To the right of the tower, a low shed-hip-roof section fronts a taller section with a front-facing gable. This tall section is the original sanctuary. To the left of the tower is a short-gable section, which gives way to a longer gabled section with a lower roof. The main entrance is at the base of the tower, sheltered by a gabled hood, with secondary entrances immediately to its left (under a shed-roof extension of the short ell) and at the far end of the long ell. The church's original sanctuary was built in 1883 by the local Quaker community, as a replacement for the Pond Meeting House.

Stanfield Ross Stanfield (born in 1927 and christened Dietrich Goertzen - died August 2, 2010) was a self-styled mining promoter based in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. Mr. Stanfield had been active in the industry at least since the mid-1970s.1 In 1964, he and his business partner at the time, John Hilton, optioned property near Williams Lake, British Columbia to a penny stock company called Gibraltar Mines Ltd. Together with senior partner Placer Developments Ltd., Gibraltar Mines Ltd. eventually brought the Gibraltar Mine, a current holding of Taseko Mines Limited and the second largest copper mine in Canada, into production in 1972.2 Stanfield Mining Group of Canada Ltd. is an umbrella for several corporate entities controlled by R.H. Stanfield. The companies include Fort Steele Mineral Corporation, Zeus Mineral Corporation, Gallowai Metal Mining Corporation, Bul River Mineral Corporation, Big Bear Metal Mining Corporation, International Feldspar Ltd., Giant Steeples Mineral Corporation, Grand Mineral Corporation, Kutteni Diamonds Ltd. and White Cat Metal Mining Corporation. Controversy Stanfield's companies have raised at least $220,000,000 CDN in the last three and a half decades from more than 3,700 investors mainly in Alberta and Saskatchewan, yet Stanfield remained president and sole individual in possession of voting shares until the time of his death.3 In 2007 the sudden unexplained terminations of key tenured contract employees alarmed several investors from Edmonton, Alberta, who decided to coordinate their efforts to discover exactly what the status of the mine and their investment was. Stanfield responded with a $202 million lawsuit against them.4 Stanfield's Alberta lawsuit against the Galloway Twelve has been stayed in the courts pending the results of a petition the G12 launched in the province of British Columbia, to attempt to remove Ross Stanfield and to secure an independent investigation into the true value of the ore alleged to be present at Stanfield's operations, specifically regarding the companies Gallowai Metal Mining Corporation and Bul River Mineral Corporation.5 Results of the BC petition On February 2, 2010, the Honourable Mr. Justice Leask concluded in the case of Stalkhe v. Stanfield (2010 BCSC 142)6 that the respondents, Ross Stanfield, Gallowai Metal Mining Corporation and Bul River Mineral Corporation, engaged in no oppressive conduct and dismissed the G12 petition with costs awarded to the respondents. The Galloway Twelve have filed an appeal. On July 16, 2010, a BC Securities Commission hearing requested by BCSC enforcement staff ordered Ross Stanfield to provide a mineral resource estimate on Gallowai Bul River by July 15, 2011, using an independent geologist. The first update of that report is due October 15, 2010. Death Ross H.

The voices of main characters Boogie and Marcia were performed by Pablo Echarri and Nancy Dupl√°a. It was the first 3D animated movie made in Argentina and Latin America.Se estrena \\"Boogie, el aceitoso\\" Plot Boogie meets Marcia at a bar, the girlfriend of the mafia Boss Sonny Calabria, who asks him if he finds her attractive. Boogie points that she is fat in a very rude manner, and leaves. Some time later Calabria is sent to trial, threatened by the existence of a mysterious witness who could incriminate him. Calabria's people try to hire Boogie to kill that witness, but as he requests too much money they decide to hire Blackburn instead, a competitor killer. Angered by the situation, Boogie decides to kidnap the witness to force Calabria to pay him. The witness was Marcia, who had changed into a thin figure after Boogie's criticism, causing Calabria to leave her and get together with another fat woman, as he preferred fat women. Marcia falls in love with this seeming hero, despite his constant violence and lack of feelings, until she finds out his true plans. She tries to escape from him, but Boogie captures her back and negotiates giving her up to Calabria. However, after trading her in, Boogie starts feeling guilty, and decides to go back and rescue Marcia. He decides to bring her to the trial, that was waiting for her testimony, and crosses the country at high speed. During the trial, Calabria's lawyer tries to kill Marcia but Boogie shoots him instead. Sonny summons massive numbers of hit-men who have infiltrated in the scene, but boogie starts to kill them all. Marcia, who had so far been reluctant to Boogie's violence, takes two of his guns and starts killing as well, and ends with killing Calabria for leaving her. Boogie sees Marcia, armed with guns and all covered with blood, and falls in love with her. Three months after the event, Marcia declares in a Journal that she knows nothing from Boogie ever since, and has made out her mind that probably that was for the best, and starts thinking that Boogie might be in a War Zone doing what he does best. Later on we can see Boogie in a Battlefield Site as a Mercenary, just to watch him pointing his M16 Service Rifle right at the camera to say \\"There's some for you too\\".

Roberto Fontanarrosa, creator of the character in comic strips, had read and edited a provisional script.\\"Boogie, el aceitoso\\" desembarca en la pantalla grande Fontanarrosa died shortly after, but it was decided to go on with the project. Cova considered later that they could manage to make the transition from comic strips to movie being loyal to the character style and the style of Fontanarrosa himself. He considered that the movie would have been grotesque if it had been done with actors, but being humoristic it worked better. The film had a cost of two and a half million of dollars. Unlike the comic strips, which are made with short jokes, the movie is not made with a series of short shots but with a big storyline. However, many of the comic strips created by Fontanarrosa were included as part of the storyline. Boogie also lacks in the comic strips a female sidekick: although Marcia does exist in such media, she's just one more of many others secondary characters abused or insulted by Boogie. The Marcia character in the film collects into a single character situations of many others.\\"Boogie, el aceitoso\\" salta de las vi√±etas al cine 3D She was also designed as a femme fatale, despite the lack of such characters in the work of Fontanarrosa.

In other words, from the raw GDP or GNP data, which reflect changes in both production volume and prices, a series is obtained which reflects only production volume. The year-by-year chain linking method differs from some other techniques for compensating for monetary inflation and deflation that are used in economics, such as the consumer price index. The consumer price index uses the observed price of a set 'market basket' of goods and services in any two given years to determine the relative prices in those two years; it does not rely on a cumulative accounting of changes in the intervening years. The consumer price index is thus an example of a fixed-weight compensation method; fixed weight methods relate prices in all years to some single base year. The problem is that the compensation factor derived from any index depends on the weights given to the various items in the market-basket -- or the proportions of each item in whatever aggregate amount is being looked at -- and the weights that were correct for one time may not be correct for other times. For example, in 1850 the price of horse-fodder would have been an important component of overall price levels, but now it is not. If one is comparing 1850 price levels to present ones, then, the question arises, what weight to give to horse-fodder? It is difficult to know. The chain linking method attempts to avoid this conundrum by never making large leaps in time. The United Kingdom presently uses chain linking to put its national accounts aggregates (e.g., GDP, GNP) in constant- price terms. From the GDP figures thus obtained can be derived an implicit GDP deflator which gives a good indication of inflation or deflation in the economy as a whole.United Kingdom, Office for National Statistics, Abstract of Statistics, 2008 edition. Tables 16.1 (p 253) and 16.3 (p 255) show some of the chained volume series for recent years); and the notes to table 16.3 (which are on page 250) briefly explain the chained volume method. The United States switched to using chained volume series in 1996 as its featured method of putting GDP in constant-price terms. Before that it had used the Laspeyres index, a fixed-weight method.United States, Bureau of Economic Analysis, Concepts and methods of the United States National Income and Production Accounts , July 2008.

Set back from the front are side projections, a single-story entrance vestibule on the left, and the main tower on the right. The main entrance is at the center of the nave end, in an ornately decorated projecting Gothic-arch opening, with buttresses and pinnacles at the corners. The main tower is equally ornate, rising first to a gabled roof with a tall steeple above that. The interior has seen only minimal alteration since the building's construction. with The church was built in 1926-27 in order to handle growth in the city's Roman Catholic population. It was built as the third sanctuary for a parish established in 1830. It was designed by the Boston architectural firm of O'Connell and Shaw; T.G. O'Connell had by then a well-established reputation, with numerous commissions for Roman Catholic church and school edifices in Maine.

Born in Walnutport, Pennsylvania, he threw and batted right-handed, stood tall and weighed . Early career Wieand signed with the St. Louis Cardinals in 1952. On December 5, 1957, he was traded to the Cincinnati Redlegs (as the Reds were then called) with fellow pitchers Marty Kutyna and Willard Schmidt for young centerfielder Curt Flood and another outfielder, Joe Taylor. Flood became a three-time All-Star in St. Louis, a key member of three National League champions and winner of two World Series rings (; ). Moreover, he changed the game of baseball by his 1969 legal challenge of the transfer system and reserve clause, eventually resulting in the Curt Flood Act of 1998, which limits Major League Baseball's antitrust exemption in labor matters.Reds get Schmidt in 5-man trade 1958 Wieand made his MLB debut on September 27, 1958, facing the Milwaukee Braves at County Stadium. He came into the game in the fourth inning in relief of Cincinnati starter Jay Hook. He pitched the fourth and fifth frames, giving up four hits and two runs, including a home run to Frank Torre. He also struck out two, with Hall of Famer Warren Spahn being his first victim. 1960 He would not appear in the major leagues again until April 14, 1960, when he faced the Pittsburgh Pirates at Forbes Field. He came into the game in the eighth inning to mop up as the Pirates drubbed the Reds, 13‚Äì0. Wieand next worked three days later in another game against the Pirates at Forbes Field. He came into the contest in the bottom of the ninth inning to preserve a 5‚Äì4 Reds' lead. After Don Hoak grounded out, Dick Groat singled to center. The next batter, Bob Skinner, slammed a home run to give the Pirates a 6‚Äì5 victory and Wieand his first and only major league decision. Three days later, he again appeared against the Braves at County Stadium. He came into the game in the bottom of the seventh inning with the Reds trailing 4‚Äì1. He gave up one hit, one walk, and one strikeout. Two days later, he came into a game against the Philadelphia Phillies at Connie Mack Stadium in the eighth inning in a mop-up role with the Phillies leading the Reds, 10‚Äì6. Two days later, against the same Phillies and in the same stadium, he made his final appearance in the majors. He came into the game in the bottom of the eighth inning to replace starting pitcher Bob Purkey. The Reds were leading 5‚Äì4, but the Phillies were threatening with runners on second and third with no one out. Wieand intentionally walked Harry Anderson to load the bases. But the gambit backfired when Wieand was unable to find the plate, and walked Joe Koppe to force in the tying run. The next batter, Jimmie Coker, slammed his second career home run and the first grand slam of his career to give the Phillies an insurmountable 9-5 lead, with Purkey charged with the defeat. Wieand never made another appearance in the major leagues. In his six MLB games, Wieand allowed eight hits and five walks in 6‚Öì innings pitched; he fanned five. Three of the eight hits he permitted were home runs. His pitching career continued in the minor leagues through 1962.

Built in 1832 for a Universalist congregation founded in 1826, it is a prominent local example of transitional Federal-Gothic Revival architecture. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978. History For over 200 years, the Universalist Unitarian Church of Waterville, Maine has been part of the spiritual, religious and social life of the community. Two local churches combined to form the church as it is known today, a decade before the national merger of the two denominations into one. In 1798, Thomas Barnes, a circuit minister, organized the Eastern Maine Association of Universalists. He held meetings in Winthrop, Waterville, Oakland and other nearby places. He was the first Universalist minister in the District of Maine in 1802. In 1820, Reverend Sylvanus Cobb of Norway, the second Universalist minister ordained in Maine, preached in Waterville for the first time. On May 28, 1826, he organized the first Universalist Church in Maine. The church had twenty members and met in Rev. Cobb's Waterville home. By 1831, the society became formally organized and decided to build a church. Jediah Morrill converted to the faith and gave the largest donation to the building fund. On July 9, 1832, the present church was finished and furnished with 60 pews at a cost of $4,100. It was dedicated in January of the following year. Members raised $360 to purchase a bell and Jediah Morrill gave the clock costing $350. That same year, Rev. Calvin Gardiner began his twenty-year ministry. The church struggled financially over the years, sometimes closing for a year or two at a time. In 1894, the church was badly damaged by a chimney fire. As part of the building's repair, the church was turned to face the point where Elm and Silver Streets meet. A new organ was purchased and stained glass windows were given by members and church groups. In 1921, the church building was raised and the Averill Parlors constructed in the new basement. The Unitarian church was founded in 1866 and built on Main Street in Waterville. By 1927, it was having a hard time financially, and the two churches talked of merging. The situation worsened by 1936 to the point where the Unitarians decided to close their church. In 1952, the two churches, along with the Church of the Good Shepherd in Fairfield, united to form the Universalist Unitarian Church of Waterville. The classic bell tower whose clock was once considered the town clock was in serious danger of collapsing by 2008. The tower was taken down and sold at auction along with the clock and lightning rod. A new bell tower was constructed in time for the Christmas Eve service that year. Architecture The church stands facing south toward a small triangular park formed by the junction of Silver and Elm Streets, south of downtown Waterville. It is a single-story wood frame structure, with a gabled roof, clapboard siding, and granite foundation. Rising from the roof is a two-stage square tower, with a clock in the first stage, an open octagonal belfry as the second, and a bowed octagonal roof above. The openings in the belfry have Gothic pointed arches, a detail repeated in fans above some of the building's windows, and in the gable front of the facade. with See also *National Register of Historic Places listings in Kennebec County, Maine References External links *Unitarian Universalist Church of Waterville web site Category:Churches in Kennebec County, Maine Category:Buildings and structures in Waterville, Maine Category:Churches on the National Register of Historic Places in Maine Category:Federal architecture in Maine Category:Gothic Revival church buildings in Maine Category:Churches completed in 1832 Category:19th- century churches in the United States Category:National Register of Historic Places in Kennebec County, Maine ","title":"Universalist-Unitarian Church"},{"id":"24929230","text":"Nanjil K.

The trawler had a length of , a beam of , and a depth of . Muriels engines were rated at . Muriel was owned by P Feron & Sons and commanded by Captain William Stephen, who had been master of the vessel since 1929. Newspaper articles Newspaper article, Christchurch 1937 The below article was published in 1907 during the construction of Muriel: '' Mr. Dolbel, of Napier, owner of the trawler Result, is to take delivery of another trawler from Messrs Lane and of Whangaroa, at an early date. The new trawler, which is a wooden vessel, is to be named the Muriel. Her principal dimensions are : Length overall, 70 ft [21.3 meters]; beam, 16 ft [4.9 meters]; and depth of hold, 8 ft [2.4 meters]. Her equipment will be a facs'milo type of the Noia Niven, with cold storage, and the gear inseparable from a trawler. The vessel is fitted with two pole masts, and has a small cabin aft.'' *In the Evening Post, Wellington on 24 July 1911, page 2: A strong effort is being made to develop the trawling industry at Lyttelton (states the Christchurch Press). On Friday afternoon the steamer trawler Result arrived in the port, after a smart run of fifty-one hours from Napier. Her arrival brings the number of vessels engaged in the trawling industry at Lyttelton up to five, the fleet now comprising the Muriel, Result, Purau, Mullogh, and Pilot. The fishing grounds are off Banks Peninsula, outside of a line drawn from Port Levy rocks to Long Look Out Point, and also to the northward of Lyttelton Heads. During the winter months fish are not very plentiful, but some fairly good hauls are made even made at this part of the year. In the summer months the trawlers get some large hauls of flat fish. The financial results are not always as good as the demand for fish in Christchurch seems to warrant. The market fluctuates very considerably, and one best flat fish at times bring very poor prices.

John William Dephoff, a single man aged 31 years, employed on the trawler Muriel, fell overboard yesterday and was drowned. The body was recovered later.''' Sumner Bar stranding At 7:20 p.m. on 7 October 1937, Muriel was returning from the Motunau fishing grounds. Two hours out from Lyttelton, on a smooth sea, Muriel ran into fog. She was moving inwards to pick up the Godley Head signal. She then struck Sumner Bar, Christchurch. One of the rudder chains carried away and she was helpless. High tide aided the launch of the Sumner Lifeboat Institution's vessel Rescue 2. The crew were safely removed and she was abandoned until 7:00 a.m. the next morning. Muriel was later dismantled after many failed salvage attempts. A court of inquiry found that Muriel went ashore in dense fog. They considered the master's positions and ordered him to pay 10 pounds 10 towards the cost of the inquiry.

Established as a family cemetery in 1867, it is one of the state's most distinctive small cemeteries, organized with concentric circles around a central monument. The cemetery was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1991. Location The Wing Family Cemetery is located in a rural setting north of Wayne's village center, on the east side of Pond Road near Pocasset Lake. It occupies a square parcel, which is ringed by a cut granite stone wall. A line of maple trees separates the street from the westernmost wall. with History The Wing \\"Ring\\" Cemetery was founded by the descendants of the seven sons of Simeon Wing & Mary Allen. The seven sons (Thomas, Ebenezer, Dr. Moses, Aaron, Allen, Simeon & William) emigrated from Sandwich (Pocasset, now Bourne), Barnstable Co., Massachusetts to what was originally called New Sandwich at the end of the Revolutionary War. The brothers settled around the body of water originally called Wing Pond, but now known as Lake Pocasset. Originally, the family had a traditional \\"burying place\\" on the homestead of the youngest son, William (as the parents lived with William for the last years of their lives). In 1867, descendants of the brothers formed a Wing Cemetery Corporation for the purpose of creating a new memorial to their deceased members. They leveled off the top of a hill, dug down several feet to remove all of the larger rocks, and graded the lot. Alonzo Wing of Wisconsin drafted the \\"ringed\\" formation, aligning the stones in concentric circles around a central obelisk. James Norris Wing learned the trade of stone-cutting and supervised the creation of curved granite footings to form the base of the concentric circles (upon which the gravestones would be placed). The process took several years, and hundreds of dollars (which was privately financed by the Cemetery Corporation through donations from family members). The cemetery was finally completed about 1871.

Built in 1921, with the parsonage (now a Finnish heritage center) added about 1925, the church represents one of the earliest formal expressions of Finnish-American culture in the region. The buildings were listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1994. Description and history The Finnish Congregational Church stands on the east side of St. George Road (Maine State Route 131), about south of its junction with United States Route 1 in the main village of Thomaston. The church faces west, and is set behind a semicircular drive, with the former parsonage house just to its right (south). The church is a basically vernacular wood frame structure, with a gabled roof and clapboard siding. A square tower projects half its size from the center of the front, with the main double-door entrance at its base, a narrow sash window above, and a pyramidal second stage topped by a shallow pyramidal roof. An addition extends to the rear of the main body, which houses a kitchen and dining area. The former parsonage is a smaller single-story wood frame building, three bays wide, with a full-width hip-roofed porch across the front. Finnish immigration into Knox County appears to have begun in the 1890s, and is one of two places (the other being Oxford County) where Finns clustered in these early years. The earliest documented land ownership by Finns in the county is 1896. The Finnish Congregation was formally organized in 1921, earlier services having taken place at a local school. The church was completed later that year, and the parsonage was added about 1925. It was the first religious building constructed for the Finnish community in the state. Gallery Finnish Church S.

Small creatures, such as rats, follow the player and drain characters' health gradually each turn, and they cannot be killed. Scorpions act similarly, but do not follow the player and instead must be avoided. Development The Amiga version of Shadowlands began development in November 1990, and was released in March 1992. British gaming magazine The One interviewed Dean Lester, the designer for Shadowlands' Amiga version, for information regarding its development in a pre-release interview. Shadowlands was conceived due to the popularity of RPGs at the time, with Lester particularly citing Dungeon Master's success, stating that \\"We'd all played and enjoyed Dungeon Master and we were looking forward to a really long project as well. We'd only had about six months on a lot of our previous work, particularly, the coin-op conversions, and we felt that a 12-month project would really show what we could achieve.\\" Due to Dungeon Master's impact on the 16-bit gaming scene, Lester notes RPGs as an 'increasingly important element of the gaming market in the future', further stating that \\"Expectations are getting higher as standards improve, and the best way to fufil [sic] those expectations is with a complex mouse-driven strategy game, not just another shoot'em up.\\" Shadowlands is designed with an 'arcade-style' isometric viewpoint and its controls & UI are 'simplified' due to Lester's design philosophy that \\"if a game system is relatively familiar to games players, it has more chance of success\\". Shadowlands utilizes burst scrolling, stating in regards to this design decision that \\"A burst scrolling isometric game is rare: flick-screen RPGs tend to be room-based and lose integrity; and it would be unplayable if the screen scrolled every time a character moved.\\" Further expressing Dungeon Master as an inspiration, Lester states that \\"There are lots of things we liked about Dungeon Master but we wanted to do it differently. So we divided the game into components, such as the view, lighting, fighting and control system, and we tried to combine some of the breakthroughs they made with our own input.\\" Lester notes his belief that Shadowlands' difficulty comes not from its scope, but \\"the combination of puzzles, monsters, traps and loads of objects to find and use. We reckon that if players want to discover everything they'll have to spend an average of six to seven hours on every level ... There'll be several different ways to complete each stage, allowing you to progress in a random fashion - if the structure was too linear it would ruin the fun.\\" Poisoned food was considered as an addition to Shadowlands during development, however Lester notes his hesitance in doing so, expressing that \\"there's nothing more annoying than searching for something for ages, and then eating it only to find it kills you. We've tried as far as possible to take out all the frustration.\\" Lester further notes how Shadowlands responds to different playstyles, stating that it \\"senses how good you are: if you're particularly adept at some puzzles you might find there are a couple of extra monsters.\\" Determining when walls should appear and disappear was a complication in Shadowlands' development, and Lester expresses in regards to this that \\"The problem with scrolling an isometric game is that you want to leave in the background walls so that you can feature switches and objects, but you want to leave out the foreground walls so you can see your characters. Flick-screen games solve this by just putting in an archway and omitting the wall - but in Shadowlands, once one of the characters walks round the other side of a wall it should reappear. The compromise we reached makes the foreground walls disappear when your character is near, and indicates them with a red line.\\" Light is an important gameplay aspect in Shadowlands, and Lester states that \\"Light is more than a graphical effect, it also allows you to use objects like photo receptors to activate switches or open doors. Some monsters, too, are attracted to light, so that you can create decoys - others are repelled by it.\\" Lester also notes the use of lighting as a fog of war, stating that \\"The beauty of the limited vision system we're using is that you often just get vague glimpses of objects lying around, particularly when your light source is fading\\". Shadowlands' graphics were created by Mark Anthony, and were drawn traditionally on paper, and then digitized into 16-colour graphics. Shadowlands' graphics were one of the final aspects of the game to be designed; according to The One, \\"graphics are one of the last pieces of the jigsaw: all of the code has been finished and much of the design is complete\\", and upon the graphics' completion, the game was sent to Shadowlands' publisher Domark for playtesting. According to The One, Mark Anthony's \\"passion for Japanese-style graphics\\" influenced the anime artstyle used in Shadowlands' character portrait generator. Shadowlands' playable characters have 128 frames of animation. To save on memory, each of the four characters use the same animation, albeit with changed colours. On Amiga 512Ks, levels load in separately, while 1Mb Amigas use the extra memory as a RAM disc, and have reduced loading times. Reception Computer Gaming World gave the game a positive review, stating that \\"Shadowlands .... doesn't exactly break new ground, but it does have an approach that is unique and features that set it apart from the rest\\". The magazine liked the flexible approach to questing with one party or multiple parties, and the use of light and shadow to affect gameplay. The game was reviewed in 1993 in Dragon #192 by Hartley, Patricia, and Kirk Lesser in \\"The Role of Computers\\" column. The reviewers gave the game 4 out of 5 stars. The One gave the Amiga version of Shadowlands an overall score of 93%, calling it \\"one of the best dungeon- delving role-playing games to come along since Eye of the Beholder.\\" The One praises Shadowlands' design and gameplay, stating that \\"It's obvious right from the start that an awful lot of thought has gone into the game's design, from the easy-to-use controls to the use of light as more than just a graphical effect ... The real beauty of Shadowlands is that combat takes a back seat to the environment, but still manages to feature strongly enough to add excitement to the proceedings.\\" The One praises Shadowlands' uniqueness, expressing that \\"The very fact that each of the four characters can be controlled independently of each other sets it apart from the likes of Cadaver, Dungeon Master, et al, and allows you to come up with all manner of strategies in fights and solutions to puzzles.\\" The One particularly praises Shadowlands' unique approach to items, stating that \\"Every object, no matter how small or insignificant, can be utilized effectively ... Apples are more than just food, you can drain them of their 'psychic energies', use them to set off hidden pressure plates or even throw them at monsters.\\" The One however criticises the presence of 'small monsters' such as rats and scorpions, which follow around the player characters and slowly drain their health, a feature they call 'questionable', and expresses that they find the need to eat and drink to \\"[detract] from the fun of the game\\" but notes the latter as a matter of personal opinion. The One calls Shadowlands \\"a glorious fantasy romp, mixing exactly the right amount of action with thought and wrapping it all up with a completely absorbing atmosphere.\\" Reviews *Atari ST User - May, 1992 *ACE (Advanced Computer Entertainment) - Mar, 1992 *ASM (Aktueller Software Markt) - May, 1992 *ST Format Atari ST - Dec, 1993 References External links *Shadowlands at IGN * Category:1992 video games Category:Amiga games Category:Atari ST games Category:DOS games Category:Fantasy video games Category:Role-playing video games Category:Teque London games Category:Video games developed in the United Kingdom ","title":"Shadowlands (video game)"},{"id":"24929467","text":"D.

Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 245.), known as Li Xun (ÊùéË®ì) in 835, courtesy name initially Zixun (Â≠êË®ì), later Zichui (Â≠êÂûÇ), pseudonym Hermit Wang (ÁéãÂ±±‰∫∫) during the mourning period for his mother, was an official of the Chinese dynasty Tang Dynasty. He became a trusted advisor to Emperor Wenzong and plotted with Emperor Wenzong to end the hold the powerful eunuchs had on power by slaughtering the eunuchs, but when the effort failed (in an event later known as the Ganlu Incident), Li Xun and his associates were slaughtered.  Background  It is not known when Li Zhongyan was born. According to his biographies in the official histories of Tang Dynasty, the Old Book of Tang and the New Book of Tang, he was from the same branch of the Li family ‚Äî the \\"Guzang Branch\\" (ÂßëËáßÊàø) ‚Äî as the chancellors Li Kui and Li Fengji, and was two generations below Li Kui and one generation below Li Fengji, although the family tree for the Greater Guzang Branch in the New Book of Tang did not mention Li Zhongyan or any of his male-line ancestors.Old Book of Tang, vol. 169.New Book of Tang, vol. 179.New Book of Tang, vol. 75 It was said that Li Zhongyan was tall, handsome, charismatic, well-spoken, dexterous, and good at reading people's emotions. He passed the imperial examinations in the Jinshi (ÈÄ≤Â£´) class; thereafter, he served as an assistant teacher at the imperial university, before serving at as a staff member to the military governor (Jiedushi) of Heyang Circuit (Ê≤≥ÈôΩ, headquartered in modern Jiaozuo, Henan).  Early involvement in politics  During Emperor Jingzong's reign (824-827), Li Fengji served as chancellor. Li Zhongyan became a close associate of Li Fengji's, and it was said that shortly after Emperor Jingzong took the throne, Li Zhongyan, along with Li Fengji's other associates Li Yu (ÊùéËôû) and Zhang Youxin (ÂºµÂèàÊñ∞), participated in manufacturing false evidence against a political enemy of Li Fengji's, the imperial scholar Li Shen. As a result of Li Fengji's accusations against Li Shen ‚Äî that when Emperor Jingzong's father Emperor Muzong died, Li Shen was intending to support Emperor Muzong's brother Li Cong (ÊùéÊÇ∞) the Prince of Shen ‚Äî Li Shen was exiled. Subsequently, Li Zhongyan, Zhang, Li Xuzhi (ÊùéÁ∫å‰πã), Li Yu, Liu Qichu (ÂäâÊ†ñÊ•ö), Jiang Qia (ÂßúÊ¥Ω), Zhang Quanyu (ÂºµÊ¨äËºø), and Cheng Xifan (Á®ãÊòîËåÉ), became known as Li Fengji's \\"Eight Gates\\" ‚Äî i.e., people who wanted to see Li Fengji had to go through them.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 243. In 825, the official Wu Zhao (Ê≠¶Êò≠), displeased that he was not given a position with authority and believing that Li Fengji was the one who prevented his commission, stated to his friend Mao Hui (ËåÖÂΩô), when he was drunk, that he wanted to kill Li Fengji. This declaration was reported to the authorities, and Wu and Mao were arrested. During the investigations, Li Zhongyan tried to induce Mao to implicate the chancellor Li Cheng, who was not on good terms with Li Fengji. Mao refused to implicate Li Cheng, and reported Li Zhongyan's inducement to the investigating officials. As a result of the investigations, Wu was executed by caning, while Mao, Li Zhongyan, and Li Cheng's relative Li Rengshu (Êùé‰ªçÂèî) (who had told Wu that Li Fengji was refusing to give him a commission), were executed ‚Äî in Li Zhongyan's case, to Xiang Prefecture (Ë±°Â∑û, in modern Laibin, Guangxi). After Emperor Jingzong died around the new year 827 and was succeeded by his brother Emperor Wenzong, a general pardon was declared, and Li Zhongyan was allowed to return from exile. Later, when his mother died, he stayed at the eastern capital Luoyang to observe a mourning period.  Association with Emperor Wenzong  At some point, Li Fengji, who wanted to be chancellor again, consulted Li Zhongyan. Li Zhongyan claimed to be friendly to the powerful eunuch Wang Shoucheng's close associate Zheng Zhu, and so Li Fengji gave Li Zhongyan a large amount of money to bribe Zheng. Zheng thereafter introduced Li Zhongyan to Wang, who in turn introduced Li Zhongyan to Emperor Wenzong and informed Emperor Wenzong that Li Zhongyan knew the I Ching well. As Li Zhongyan was then still supposed to be observing the mourning period for his mother, he could not enter the palace in mourning clothes, so he took on a Taoist monk's robe and took the name of Hermit Wang. It was said that Emperor Wenzong was impressed by Li Zhongyan's appearance, charisma, and ability to speak, and he treated Li Zhongyan well. By fall 834, Li Zhongyan's mourning period was over. Emperor Wenzong wanted to make him an imperial scholar, but this was vehemently opposed by the chancellor Li Deyu, who pointed to Li Zhongyan's past, causing Emperor Wenzong to be displeased. Li Deyu's fellow chancellor Wang Ya, who initially agreed with Li Deyu, seeing Emperor Wenzong's displeasure, changed his mind and no longer opposed Li Zhongyan's commission ‚Äî and, indeed, when Emperor Wenzong subsequently changed Li Zhongyan's commission to be one for an assistant teacher at the imperial university (a lower post, probably to placate Li Deyu) and advisory officials Zheng Su (ÈÑ≠ËÇÖ) and Han Ci (Èüì‰ΩΩ) sealed the edict and were set to return the edict to him for reconsideration, as was their prerogative, Wang persuaded them not to do so. Subsequently, because Wang, Li Zhongyan, and Zheng Zhu all resented Li Deyu, they had Li Deyu's political enemy, the former chancellor Li Zongmin, recalled from his post as military governor of Shannan West Circuit (Â±±ÂçóË•øÈÅì, headquartered in modern Hanzhong, Shaanxi), to the capital Chang'an to again serve as chancellor. Soon thereafter, Li Deyu was removed from his chancellor position and sent out to be the military governor of Shannan West. On the same day, Li Zhongyan was made an assistant imperial scholar, over the objections of a number of advisory officials, including Zheng Su and Han. In winter 834, Li Zhongyan changed his name to Li Xun. Meanwhile, while Emperor Wenzong appeared to be outwardly respectful to Wang and other eunuchs who helped him take the throne, he was in fact resentful of their hold on power. Zheng and Li Xun figured out what the emperor was thinking, and thereafter began to plot with Emperor Wenzong on eliminating the powerful eunuchs ‚Äî and Emperor Wenzong associated with them because he felt that they, as officials recommended by Wang, would not draw suspicions from the eunuchs. It was under their suggestion that, in spring 835, Emperor Wenzong partially diverted Wang's power by giving the command of one of the eunuch-controlled Shence Armies to Wang's rival Qiu Shiliang. There was, at the time, a rumor spread in Chang'an that Zheng Zhu was making immortality pills for Emperor Wenzong, and that the pills required infant hearts and livers as ingredients, causing much panic among the people. Zheng accused family members of the mayor of Jingzhao Municipality (‰∫¨ÂÖÜ, i.e., the Chang'an region) Yang Yuqing (Ê•äËôûÂçø) of spreading the rumors, and Emperor Wenzong, incensed, arrested Yang. When Li Zongmin, who had previously refused to give Zheng an office he wanted, tried to intercede on Yang's behalf, Emperor Wenzong ordered Li Zongmin to leave his presence, and soon had him exiled. It was said that Li Xun and Zheng drafted a master plan for reforming the state that had details and which impressed Emperor Wenzong, which called first for eliminating the eunuchs, then for recovery of the territory lost to Tufan, and then for destruction of the warlords north of the Yellow River. It was said that they became so powerful that they were carrying out reprisals against anyone they disliked ‚Äî and that those persons were accused to be partisans of Li Deyu or Li Zongmin, and as Emperor Wenzong disfavored Li Deyu's and Li Zongmin's factionalism, those accused of being associates were easily chased out of government. In summer 835, Li Xun took on the additional post as Bingbu Langzhong (ÂÖµÈÉ®ÈÉé‰∏≠), a supervisory official at the ministry of defense (ÂÖµÈÉ®, Bingbu) and also became responsible for drafting imperial edicts, while also remaining as assistant imperial scholar. It had long been rumored that the death of Emperor Wenzong's grandfather Emperor Xianzong was at the hands of the eunuch Chen Hongzhi (Èô≥ÂºòÂøó), who was, by this point, serving as the eunuch monitor of Shannan East Circuit (Â±±ÂçóÊù±ÈÅì, headquartered in modern Xiangfan, Hubei). Under Li Xun's advice, Emperor Wenzong recalled Chen from Shannan East, and when Chen reached Qingni Station (ÈùíÊ≥•È©õ, in modern Xi'an, Shaanxi), Emperor Wenzong had a cane sent to Qingni and ordered that Chen be caned to death. Thereafter, under the plan by Li Xun and Zheng, Emperor Wenzong was set to commission Zheng as the military governor of Fengxiang Circuit (È≥≥Áøî, headquartered in modern Baoji, Shaanxi), so that he could gather forces to use in a plot against the eunuchs. The chancellor Li Guyan opposed, and Emperor Wenzong reacted by simultaneously commissioning Li Guyan as the military governor of Shannan West and Zheng as the military governor of Fengxiang. Li Xun, however, was himself jealous of Zheng at this point, and so actually secretly planned to eliminate Zheng after the plot against the eunuchs would succeed. As a result, when selecting a staff for Zheng, he selected officials who were considered mild in their disposition, rather than those considered to be able. Shortly after Zheng's commission, Li Xun and Shu Yuanyu (who investigated Yang Yuqing) were named chancellors with the designation Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi (Âêå‰∏≠Êõ∏ÈñÄ‰∏ãÂπ≥Á´†‰∫ã). Meanwhile, at Li Xun's and Zheng's advice, Emperor Wenzong gave Wang Shoucheng the honorific title of monitor of the Shence Armies and stripped him of military command.  Ganlu Incident and death  In winter 835, at Li Xun's and Zheng Zhu's advice, Emperor Wenzong sent poisoned wine to Wang Shoucheng to poison him to death. Wang Shoucheng's death was a part of further planning by Emperor Wenzong, Li Xun, and Zheng ‚Äî the plan was that when Wang was set to be buried on December 20, 835, Zheng, who claimed that he was grateful to Wang, would take his personal guards, who were armed with sharp axes, with him to attend the funeral. At the funeral, the guards would then surround the eunuchs and slaughter them. However, Li Xun discussed the plan with his associates, and he concluded that if that were to happen, Zheng would receive all of the credit, and therefore he resolved to act before Zheng would, planning to kill Zheng as well after he succeeded. To that end, Li Xun had Guo Xingyu (ÈÉ≠Ë°åÈ§ò) made the military governor of Binning Circuit (ÈÇ†ÂØß, headquartered in modern Xianyang, Shaanxi); Wang Fan (ÁéãÁí†) made the military governor of Hedong Circuit (Ê≤≥Êù±, headquartered in modern Taiyuan, Shanxi); Luo Liyan (ÁæÖÁ´ãË®Ä) made the acting mayor of Jingzhao; and Han Yue (ÈüìÁ¥Ñ) made a general of the imperial guards; he had the four of them gather troops to be ready to act against the eunuchs. It was said that only Li Xun, Guo, Wang Fan, Luo, Han, Li Xiaoben (ÊùéÂ≠ùÊú¨) the deputy chief imperial censor, and Shu were aware of Li Xun's plans. On December 14, Li Xun acted. six days before the scheduled funeral for Wang, Han reported to Emperor Wenzong, at the imperial meeting hall Zichen Hall (Á¥´ÂÆ∏ÊÆø), that there had been sweet dew (ÁîòÈú≤, ganlu in Chinese) that appeared on a pomegranate tree outside the headquarters of Zuo Jinwu (Â∑¶ÈáëÂêæ), one of the Wei Army (Ë°õËªç) headquarters ‚Äî viewed as a sign of divine favor. Emperor Wenzong then went to nearby Hanyuan Hall (Âê´ÂÖÉÊÆø) and ordered the imperial officials, including Li Xun, to examine the purported sweet dew. Li Xun soon returned and stated that it appeared that there was no sweet dew; at Li Xun's suggestion, Emperor Wenzong ordered Qiu and his fellow Shence Army commander Yu Hongzhi (È≠öÂºòÂøó) to lead the eunuchs in examining the sweet dew. When Qiu and Yu arrived at the Zuo Jinwu headquarters, however, Han had lost his composure, and Qiu realized that something was wrong when he saw soldiers converging and the noise of weapons clanging. He and the other eunuchs immediately ran back to Hanyuan Hall and seized Emperor Wenzong. Li Xun tried to grab onto Emperor Wenzong's litter to stop the eunuchs from taking Emperor Wenzong back to the palace, and the soldiers under Luo and Li Xiaoben battled the eunuchs, killing a number of them, but the eunuchs were able to escort Emperor Wenzong back to the imperial palace. Knowing that he had lost this gambit, Li Xun put on the green uniform of chancellors' attendants and fled. Li Xun fled to the Zhongnan Mountain (ÁµÇÂçóÂ±±) to try to seek refuge with the Buddhist monk Zongmi, with whom he was friendly. Zongmi wanted to give Li Xun a tonsure and disguise him as a monk, but Zongmi's followers urged him not to accept Li Xun. Li Xun thus exited Zhongnan Mountain and tried to flee to Fengxiang. He was, however, intercepted on the way by the defender of Zhouzhi (Áõ©Âéî, in modern Xi'an), Song Chu (ÂÆãÊ•ö), who arrested him and had him delivered to Chang'an. When Li Xun's escort reached Kunming Pond (ÊòÜÊòéÊ±†), Li Xun, fearful that the eunuchs would torture and humiliate him, told the officer escorting him: The officer agreed and cut off his head to deliver it to Chang'an. Subsequently, at the grand public executions for Wang Ya, Wang Fan, Luo, Guo, Jia Su, Shu, and Li Xiaoben, Li Xun's head was raised by the Left Shence Army soldiers escorting Wang Ya, Wang Fan, Luo, and Guo. Li Xun's brother Li Zhongj«êng (Êùé‰ª≤ÊôØ) and cousin Li Yuangao (ÊùéÂÖÉËáØ) were also killed, as were the rest of Li Xun's household. The bodies of Li Xun's household were exposed to the elements. It was only after a new year had passed that Emperor Wenzong ordered the Jingzhao Municipal Government to have the bodies buried in two mass graves. It was said that after Li Xun's death, Emperor Wenzong missed him greatly, and often complimented his abilities to the subsequent chancellors Li Shi and Zheng Tan. Li Xun's elder brother Li Zhongjƒ´ng (Êùé‰ª≤‰∫¨, note different note than his brother above) fled to Liu Congjian the reigning Military Governor of Zhaoyi. When Liu's nephew and successor Liu Zhen fell, Li Zhongjƒ´ng was also killed.Zizhi Tongjian, vol. 248.

Brooks and illustrated by Kurt Wiese. In this story, the Bean farm animals start a bank, and elect their first president, two institutions appearing through the rest of the series. Their honest and innocent approach is soon challenged by strangers from Washington. Plot summary To encourage farmer Bean to go on his vacation, the animals decide to elect a president who can manage the farm while he is gone, and to start a bank to manage the farm money. :\\"'Yes, but how do you start a bank?' asked Eeny. :'Pooh! Nothing to it!' said the cat. 'You just‚Äîwell, you just open it. Big sign over the door‚Äî\\"BANK.\\" That‚Äôs all.' :'Oh,' said Eeny. 'So you call it a bank and then it‚Äôs a bank, hey?' :'Sure.' :'Oh,' said Eeny again. 'So then if I call you a big blowhard, what does that make you?'\\" (pp. 10-11) During a fierce storm, a lost and exhausted woodpecker finds shelter in the farmhouse. The animals realize that the name John Quincy would be impressive for a bank manager and offer him the job. Freddy gets the job of secretary. Vaults are dug under a shed. The bank is a success, and within a few days the vaults are full. Mr. Bean approves, but when he tells Mr. Weezer, the banker in Centerboro, they have an argument causing Mr. Bean to withdraw all his money and place it in the animal bank. When Jinx the cat proves uninterested in being a bank officer, John Quincy suggests bringing his father, Grover, from Washington. The woodpeckers proceed to hold a bank board meeting down a tunnel that is too small for Freddy. Since he cannot attend the meetings, control of the bank is taken from the Bean animals. The woodpeckers also have a plan for winning the election. Since all animals on the farm can vote, the woodpeckers visit the local birds to get their support. Then Simon the rat and his family ‚Äî old enemies of the Bean animals ‚Äî show up. The Bean animals realize they must select a popular candidate carefully to avoid the woodpeckers or Simon taking control of the farm. Mrs. Wiggins the cow is chosen for her common sense and public speaking experience. Mrs. Wiggins laughes during the campaigning: the opposition says laughter is out of place in government. Old Whibley the owl calls this balderdash. The woodpeckers challenge Whibley to a duel, but he apologizes. :\\"'You apologize?' said Grover. :'Certainly. You are a stuffed shirt, and you do talk balderdash, but I apologize for saying so.' :'But that‚Äôs no apology,' said John Quincy. :'What do you mean, it‚Äôs no apology?' said the owl. 'Either I apologize or I don‚Äôt apologize. If I do, it‚Äôs an apology, isn‚Äôt it?'\\" (p. 123) When Freddy comes for advice later about how to handle the woodpeckers, Whibley comments, \\"'He couldn‚Äôt do a ridiculous thing to save his life. That‚Äôs why he‚Äôs ridiculous all the time.'\\" (p. 136) Whibley has the practical suggestion for Freddy to dig a hole into the boardroom large enough for him. This done, Freddy blocks the other entrances, and calls a board meeting. The woodpeckers cannot get in, and Freddy votes himself bank president. When the animals find out that Freddy tricked the woodpeckers using the same trick that had been used against him, votes start to shift from the woodpecker party. The animals are ‚Äúon the whole a good-natured crowd\\" on election day, but the woodpeckers have schemed to have the votes for Mrs. Wiggins (\\"W\\") counted for a party they support \\"Marcus\\" (\\"M\\", an upsidedown \\"W\\"). Freddy retorts that their ballots were probably intended to be for one of other the farm animals with the same initial, too. Thwarted, Grover takes control of the powerful mechanical man (invented in an earlier book). The woodpeckers overthrow the animal government by force, taking Freddy prisoner. The woodpeckers launch a military campaign to expand their government to nearby farms and eventually the whole state. After they leave, Freddy escapes in disguise as an Irish woman, visiting the Centerboro bank manager to convince him the animal bank is no threat. Once he is on Freddy‚Äôs side, they snare Grover with a meeting in town. Grover is trapped in the mechanical man, removed, and replaced. Returning to the farm, the mechanical man instructs the woodpecker‚Äôs army to disperse. John Quincy and Grover, beaten on every front, leave the Bean farm peacefully. Illustrations There are 34 black and white, pen and ink drawings by Kurt Wiese. Endpapers and a full color slipcover depict scenes from the book. Each chapter starts with a half page illustration, while a full page illustration is placed close to an event within chapters. Unlike later books, four shorter chapters do not have an illustration within the chapter. A full page illustration is the frontispiece from an event on page 101 ‚Äî making it the only chapter in the series with two full page illustrations. The slipcover is peculiar (at least on the Overlook edition) in that the part of the art on the spine is duplicated. On other Freddy books the spine continues the front illustration seamlessly. Critical reception Novels in the series received modestly positive to strongly positive critical review in sources such as the Times Literary Supplement, and Hornbook, and Kirkus Reviews. One review of the time for this book is among the least favorable, reflecting some librarians' dissatisfaction with the speech in the realistic, modern idiom of New York State. Library Journal (Sept. 15, 1939) \\"While this is the sixth book in the series, the spontaneous gaiety of the style is unabated, and the author's sly satire never becomes objectionably unchildlike. These stories have not been so popular as the Dolittle books which they clearly resemble, but libraries where they have a steady following will find this latest volume equal in quality to the others and definitely superior to The Clockwork Twin.\\" The New York Times (Oct. 8, 1939) \\"The author has never succeeded in recapturing the spontaneous fun of his first story, To and Again. Though stereotyped in situation and commonplace in style, Wiggins for President tells a lively story and one which many young readers, though perhaps the less imaginative ones, will enjoy. Kurt Wiese's drawings are amusing and expressive.\\"http://www.mreha.com/page49.html Reviews of Published Freddy Books, Mr. Eha.

It was created in 2007 by replacing the diesel prime mover of an EMD GP38 (Norfolk Southern #2911, formerly Conrail #7732) with 1,080 12-volt lead-acid batteries and associated control equipment. The converted locomotive was redesignated Norfolk Southern #999. Design NS #999 was rebuilt from a conventional GP38 diesel locomotive (example pictured) Despite appearing somewhat similar to a conventional diesel electric locomotive, the BP4 has no diesel engine; battery charging is provided by plugging in an external power source. Battery life is extended by the use of regenerative braking, which returns about 35% of braking power to the batteries. The BP4 is designed to operate 3 shifts on a single battery charge. This conversion significantly alters the external appearance of the locomotive, with the cab (which is actually brand new) being moved forward on the frame to make room for a large louvered battery box, which takes the place of the locomotive's long hood. The fuel tank is similarly replaced with another battery box. BP4 development was undertaken by Norfolk Southern, along with Brookville Equipment, Penn State University, the United States Department of Energy, and the Federal Railroad Administration. $1.3 million in federal funding subsidized the program. The locomotive was initially converted in 2007; after initial battery issues, a better battery management system was installed in 2009. Norfolk Southern put the 999 up for auction, along with several other locomotives, in November 2019. 999 was purchased by Rail Propulsions Systems, where it was upgraded for eventual use in the Los Angeles Basin region.

Built in 1899, it is a high quality example of Shingle style architecture, designed by one of its major promoters, John Calvin Stevens. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984. It is partnered with the United Church of Christ and the Maine Seacoast Mission. Description and history The Union Church stands on the south side of East Main Street in downtown Vinalhaven, just east of its junction with Atlantic Avenue. The church is a single-story wood frame structure, with a gabled roof and shingled exterior. The long side of the building faces the street, with a square tower projecting at the right end. The tower rises to a louvered belfry and a pyramidal roof, whose corners have projecting hip sections over the piers that flank the belfry louvers. The main entrance is at the base of the tower, sheltered by a gabled porch. A wide wall dormer is set in the center of that facade, with a tripartite Gothic window. The west-facing gable end is also adorned with a large Gothic window, with small oriel windows on either side. with The church was built by Otto Nelson according to a design by Stevens, who was Maine's best-known architect of the turn of the 20th century. Stevens was a major promoter of the Shingle style, and this church is an excellent example of the style. It was built to replace an earlier structure, built in 1860 when Vinalhaven was a major center for granite quarrying and shipping.

Built in 1877, it is the rural community's finest example of 19th-century religious architecture, and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1987. The congregation, established about 1783, is affiliated with the United Church of Christ; the pastor is the Rev. Katherine E. Pinkham. Description and history The Congregational Church of Edgecomb is located in northern Edgecomb, on the west side of Cross Point Road, a short way south of its junction with Eddy Road. It is a single-story wood frame structure, with a gabled roof, clapboarded exterior, and a brick foundation. A two-stage tower projects from the east-facing front. It has a tall first stage, which has the main entrance at the base, and a Palladian-style window with rounded-arch heads above, and molded corner boards rising to a bracketed cornice. The second stage is an open belfry, with rounded-arch openings, and slatted corner posts. The tower is topped by an octagonal steeple. The tower is flanked by narrow round-arch windows, and there are wider round-arch windows on the sides of the building. The interior retains original woodwork and other features, including oil-lamp chandeliers that have been converted to electric lighting. The earliest recorded information about the Edgecomb church's congregation dates to 1783. It is documented as meeting in the community's town hall until about the time of the American Civil War, and then in a school, until this building was completed in 1881. The use of rounded arch windows is a departure from similar surviving rural churches of the period in Maine.

The Ratanarak family have substantial holdings in a number of Thai-based companies including Krungsri Bank, Siam City Cement, Allianz Ayudhya, Sri Ayudhya Capital, Matching Studio, Media of Medias and Eastern Star Real Estate as well as holding a majority stake in BBTV. Family Krit Ratanarak was born in 1946,the eldest of six children with five sisters, four of whom now live outside Thailand. His mother, Sasithorn, still lives in Bangkok. The Ratanarak family are known to be very private. Forbes call them \\"a very secretive clan\\" and Krit‚Äôs son Chachchon has been described as being \\"influential while staying below the radar\\". The Ratanaraks are one of the few remaining ‚Äòold money‚Äô families in Thailand. Krit is the son of Chuan Ratanarak, who founded Bank of Ayudhya (known today as Krungsri Bank), Siam City Cement (producer of the Insee Cement brand) and Bangkok Broadcasting and Television Hiscock (1997), p. 254 and was one of Thailand‚Äôs last great self-made business Titans. Krit took over the family businesses after the death of his father in 1993. Career Ratanarak is one of the most successful and businessmen in Thailand. He joined Bank of Ayudhya in 1972, becoming President in 1982 and CEO in 1990. In 1993 he became Chairman and CEO of the bank, Chairman of BBTV, Chairman of Siam City Cement and Chairman of Ayudhya Insurance. In the late 1990s, Ratanarak navigated Bank of Ayudhya and the other family businesses through the worst of the Asian financial crisis with the result that the Ratanaraks were one of only 8 business groups that had been in Thailand‚Äôs top 40 in 1979 to survive in the top rankings in 2009. In the years after the crisis Ratanarak strengthened the major family businesses by introducing outside capital and international management expertise. Ratanarak recapitalised Siam City Cement in 1998 in the process selling part of the family‚Äôs equity to Holderbank (later to become Holcim). Contemporary newspaper reports wrongly suggested that the sale of equity to Holderbank was used by the family to raise the funds required to recapitalize Bank of Ayudhya. However, as part of the terms of the sale, the full proceeds received by the family from Holderbank ‚Äì as well as additional funds from the Ratanarak Group - were reinvested in Siam City Cement via a rights issue to recapitalize the business and the capital injected by the family into the bank came instead from contingency reserves. In 2013 the Ratanarak family controlled 47% of the equity in Siam City Cement which had a market value of US $3.2 billion and no significant debt with Holcim holding 27.5% of the shares. In 1998, prior to the deal with Holderbank, the family had controlled slightly more than 50% of the company. While other banks closed or were nationalized, Ratanarak completed a recapitalization of Bank of Ayudhya, and continued to improve its performance in the post-crisis aftermath. In 1996 before the crisis the bank had a market value of US $4 billion in 2014 prices and this had risen to US $7 billion in 2014. The family shareholding in the bank was reduced in 2007 from 35% to 25% to comply with a reduction in the maximum permitted holding under new banking regulations which came into force in 2008. The reduction in the family‚Äôs holding was taken up by GE Capital whom the family brought into the management of the bank in 2007 to install best practice. In 2013 GE Capital sold their holding to Japan‚Äôs MUFJ following losses incurred in the 2008 banking crisis, and a change in strategy by GE to reduce their exposure to financial services. In 2014 the Ratanarak family controlled 25% of the bank‚Äôs equity with the remaining equity held by MUFJ. The Ratanarak Group emerged from the crisis with Ratanarak at the head of one of the top five business families in Thailand, and one of three of Thailand‚Äôs most powerful banking families along with the Sophonpanich and Lamsam families. Since 1993, Ratanarak has added property companies Eastern Star and Grand Canal Land and media company Matching Maximise Solution to the family business group. In 1981 Ratanarak became Thailand‚Äôs youngest senator at the age of 35, serving for four terms. 2010s According to press reports in March 2012, Ratanarak is working to transform the Rama III area of Bangkok into a major commercial centre. According to Forbes, the Ratanarak family‚Äôs holdings in the group businesses in January 2015 were estimated to be worth US$5.4 billion, based on publicly known assets and excludes private assets and property. In 2012 the Thai publication ‚ÄòWhich Family is Richest‚Äô reported the Ratanarak family as having holdings in excess of US$10 billion since 1998 when other assets are included. Personal life Ratanarak is divorced with one son, Chachchon, born in 1972.

The building also played a role in the formation of the town, and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985. Description and history The Damariscotta Baptist Church stands at the eastern end of the town's Main Street commercial district, at the southeast corner of the junction of Main Street (Business Route 1) and Bristol Road (Maine State Route 129). The location is prominently visible from a significant portion of Main Street, and the church is set on a low rise. It is a single-story wood frame structure, with a gable roof, flushboarded front facade, and clapboarded sides and rear. A multi-stage square tower rises above the front, with a clock set in the first stage, a belfry in the second, with a steeple above. The front is dominated by a gabled Greek Revival temple front, with a full pediment and entablature supported by six Ionic columns. Windows on the sides are multi- pane stained glass, with a central round-arch element. The church congregation was organized in 1819 as the Second Baptist Church in Nobleboro. When Damariscotta was set off from Nobleboro in 1848, its name was formally changed to Damariscotta Baptist Church, and the town's first organizational meeting was held in this building. It was constructed between 1843 and 1847, with stylistic evidence suggesting it was designed by Brunswick architect Samuel Melcher. Originally fitted with lancet-arched windows in the Gothic style, alterations in 1891 included the conversion of these windows to the rounded windows now found on the building.

The church was built in 1913, using materials from a schoolhouse built in 1908 on Malaga Island. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1995. Description and history Louds Island is located on the west side of Muscongus Bay, off the coast of Bristol near the village of Round Pond. The island was settled in the 1750s, and had a population of about 150 in 1798. By the mid-19th century it had lost most of its permanent population, and was reduced to a summer colony. The island had no church until this one was built in 1913. It is an L-shaped wood frame structure, 1-1/2 stories in height, with a cross-gabled roof, shingled exterior, and concrete foundation. A three-story tower rises at the crook of the L, topped by a pyramidal roof with flared eaves. It has modest Gothic stylistic elements, including a three-part arched window in one of the gabled sides. The building's story begins on Malaga Island, located in Maine's Casco Bay. During the 19th century, Malaga was the site of an impoverished settlement of predominantly African-Americans, who were mainly living of the land and sea. In 1908, well-meaning wealthy social reformers built a school on the island in a bid to improve the condition of the children of the residents. The Malaga Island community was forcibly evacuated in 1911, in what has later been described as an act of cultural imperialism. The school was given by its builders to the Maine Seacoast Missionary Society, which raised the funds needed to move it to Louds Island. Its lumber was used to build this church, to a design by Milton Stratton, a Maine architect active in the Mount Desert Island area. The building is maintained by the Louds Island Association, which holds meetings and summer religious services there.

Ingalls. Initially, The Word presented free love as a minor theme which was expressed within a labor reform format. But the publication later evolved into an explicitly free love periodical. At some point Tucker became an important contributor but later became dissatisfied with the journal's focus on free love since he desired a concentration on economics.In contrast, Tucker's relationship with Heywood grew more distant. Yet, when Heywood was imprisoned for his pro-birth control stand from August to December 1878 under the Comstock laws, Tucker abandoned the Radical Review in order to assume editorship of Heywood's The Word. After Heywood's release from prison, The Word openly became a free love journal; it flouted the law by printing birth control material and openly discussing sexual matters. Tucker's disapproval of this policy stemmed from his conviction that \\"Liberty, to be effective, must find its first application in the realm of economics...\\".The Free Love Movement and Radical Individualism By Wendy McElroy The magazine existed until 1893.

A main focus is nutrient pollution from agricultural runoff of the nation's soybean, corn and food animal production, and problems relating to sediment and toxins. Conservation programs work with local farmers and producers to decrease excess nutrients because they cause major water quality problems along with hypoxia and loss of habitat. Organizations such as the Mississippi River/Gulf of Mexico Watershed Nutrient Task Force and USDA programs such as the Upper Mississippi River Forestry Partnership and the Mississippi River Basin Healthy Watersheds Initiative contribute to conserving what is left of the Mississippi River watershed. Conservation of the Mississippi River Conservation of the Mississippi River Watershed has become an important issue that many organizations are undertaking because the capacity of the river to remove nutrients from the water is decreasing and the surrounding ecosystems are being diminished. The Mississippi River Basin encompasses 31 U.S. states with an area of 1,837,000 square miles.Mississippi River Facts, www.nps.gov, July 10, 2009, accessed October 27, 2009. The Mississippi River's capacity to remove nutrients has diminished due to a range of human activities, such as development, taking place along the Mississippi River itself and the streams and tributaries linked to it. The layouts of the river, the floodplains, and the watershed have also been modified using engineering techniques for acres of agriculture fields and urban expansion. With increase of natural prairie land being converted to land for agricultural and urban use, there has been an excess of nutrients that are discharged into the Mississippi River and its adjoining streams. Nitrates and Phosphorus are the two main contaminants that pollute the Mississippi River Watershed. This nutrient pollution comes from a surplus of phosphorus and nitrogen, both of which occur naturally in water and air. In the Upper Mississippi River Basin farmland, nitrate fertilizer has been overused in farming, with the high demand for corn as a contributing factor. Corn, which is used to make ethanol for biofuel, has become the number one crop in the farmland that drains into the Mississippi River. Soybeans are another crop in the Upper Mississippi River Basin farmland that drain into the watershed, and nitrates are the main fertilizer used on soybeans and corn. A variety of changes are needed in the agriculture industry to reduce the pollution from over fertilizing. One solution for nitrate reduction is to plant an alternative crop through crop rotation, such as legumes. Legumes are capable of nitrate fixation, which causes the plant to have a reduced need for nitrate fertilizer. Nitrate drainage is then reduced going into the watershed because legumes do not require the high amounts of fertilizer that are needed for corn and soybeans. Other alternative plants that can be used in crop rotation are miscanthus and switchgrass. These crops effectively reduce the flow of nitrates going into the Mississippi River Basin. Conservation practices can be used as alternative crops to reduce phosphorus and nitrate pollution in the River. They are necessary since nutrient pollution affects humans and aquatic life in the waterways leading to the Watershed along with the coast. The Gulf of Mexico receives the greatest damage from the pollution. Normal algae growth in water is needed to provide food for fish and other water organisms, but algae can grow too quickly because of the excess nitrogen and phosphorus going into the Mississippi River Basin. The overgrowth produces an algae or algal bloom, which reduces the amount of oxygen in the water. The depleted oxygen levels kill the aquatic life in the Gulf of Mexico, and it can make fish and other aquatic life sick. The depleted oxygen levels kill the aquatic life in the Gulf of Mexico, and it can make fish and other aquatic life sick. Humans can be affected if they drink water or consume fish and other aquatic life that have been contaminated with bacteria or other toxic substances from the algae blooms. Shellfish contamination from the algae occurs easily, and it can be very dangerous for human consumption and cause stomach issues and rashes. Millions of people throughout the United States have a water source connected to the Mississippi River Watershed because the basin is connected to groundwater, well water, and other water supply tributaries throughout the country. The watershed also serves as largest drainage system in the country. Drinking water from the basin that is polluted by nitrates and phosphorus can cause serious injury to anyone who consumes it, especially young infants. The chemicals that are used to treat the polluted water are very dangerous. These chemicals cannot be avoided since there are no real alternatives to treat the polluted water. The contaminated water source also harms forests that are located in the basin, and animals can be affected if they consume water or plants that have been contaminated by the nutrient pollution. Nitrates and phosphorus also pollute the air, and if the air is polluted, eventually the contamination will fall back to the earth and the waterway making its way through the basin.  Mississippi River/Gulf of Mexico Watershed Nutrient Task Force  The Mississippi River/Gulf of Mexico Watershed Nutrient Task Force undertakes the challenge of eliminating the dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico as well as promoting the implementation of new farming practices and nutrient runoff management. The Mississippi River dumps high nutrient runoff from the vast drainage basin into the Gulf of Mexico causing an outbreak of algae growth. The excess algae create an area where the dissolved oxygen concentration is very low in the bottom waters.Hypoxia 101, www.epa.gov, accessed October 27, 2009. Many organisms cannot tolerate low- oxygen levels and either leave the area or become weakened or die from lack of oxygen. A majority of the nutrient loadings originate from the draining of agricultural lands north of the Ohio River in the states of Iowa, Illinois, Indiana, southern Minnesota, and Ohio.2001 Action Plan, www.epa.gov, accessed October 27, 2009. Nitrates and Phosphorus are the two main contaminants that pollute the Mississippi River Watershed. This nutrient pollution comes from a surplus of phosphorus and nitrogen, both of which occur naturally in water and air. = 2001 Action Plan = The 2001 Action Plan is a national strategy to reduce Gulf hypoxia with a focus on reducing the nitrogen and phosphorus nutrient loads to the northern Gulf coming from the Mississippi River. The Action Plan proposes three goals: a Coastal Goal, a Within Basin Goal, and a Quality of Life Goal. The Coastal Goal intends to reduce the square mileage of hypoxia in the Gulf to 5,000 square kilometers by the implementation of actions to reduce the discharge of nutrients into the Gulf. The Within Basin Goal is to restore and protect the waters of the Mississippi River Basin by implementing nutrient and sedimentation reduction actions that will protect human health and aquatic organisms and reduce the nutrient load released into the Gulf. Lastly, the Quality of Life Goal is to improve communities across the Mississippi River Basin through land management and an incentive based approach. The Action Plan states that by December 2005, and every five years thereafter, the Task Force will review the reductions in nutrient load discharge and the response of the dead zone in the Gulf. From this data, the Task Force would then decide what actions to take to continue achieving the goals. =2008 Action Plan= The 2008 Action Plan further describes a national strategy to address the problem with hypoxia in the Gulf of Mexico and also improve the water quality in the Mississippi River. The 2008 Action Plan was a reassessment called for in the 2001 Action Plan. The 2008 Action Plan outlines the significance of completing and implementing nutrient reduction strategies, promoting these practices, and also increasing the awareness of the public of hypoxia in the Gulf. Included in the 2008 Action Plan is a series of five Annual Operating Plans, one for each of the upcoming years until the next reassessment is necessary.2008 Action Plan, www.epa.gov, accessed November 1, 2009. These Operating Plans offer guidelines to keep the forward movement of completing Action Plan goals within those years. The 2008 Action plan also summarized the progress of the 2001 Action Plan up until that point. Although the goal of reducing the size of the hypoxia area to 5000 square kilometers was not met, the loadings of nitrogen from the Mississippi River were decreased by 12%.  Upper Mississippi River Initiatives  =Upper Mississippi River Forestry Partnership= The USDA Forest Service and Northeastern Area State and Private Forestry and other local state foresters have created a partnership to demonstrate forestry's role in restoring the Upper Mississippi River Watershed. Forests are critical in protecting the surrounding watershed and the water quality. Nearly all of the prairies and 70% of the forests in the Upper Mississippi Watershed have been converted to land for agricultural and urban use. The mismanagement has had major effects on fish, wildlife and their habitat, local water supplies, and contributes to nitrogen loading in the Gulf of Mexico. The Upper Mississippi Watershed Forestry Partnership came up with a 2004-2008 Action Plan proposing to use forests and trees to lessen the impact of the altered landscapes of the Mississippi River watershed. Due to the existing damage and the cost of technological solutions, they suggest to use ecosystem services of woodlands and forest habitats to filter nutrients which helps maintain or improve water quality. They suggest using incentives to create wetlands and forest buffers between farmland and nearby rivers and streams  Mississippi River Basin Healthy Watersheds Initiative  The Mississippi River Basin Healthy Watersheds Initiative (MRBI) was developed by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) in an attempt to improve the health of the Mississippi River Basin. The Initiative has selected watersheds to improve in 12 states including Arkansas, Kentucky, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Louisiana, Minnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Ohio, Tennessee, and Wisconsin. South Dakota was added later. The MRBI built upon past efforts of producers, NRCS, partners, and State and federal agencies in this area. By dedicating $80 million per year from 2010 to 2013, the Initiative introduced local producers in the Mississippi River Watershed to conservation practices to control nutrient runoff from agricultural land. These practices helped to reduce nutrient loadings downstream, improve water quality, and restore habitats while maintaining agricultural productivity. Each state selected three area watersheds that the MRBI focused on. The selection was based on the future growth of the site depending on current water quality data, existing strategies to reduce nutrient discharge, and existing models of nitrogen and phosphorus in the watershed. Special consideration were given to watersheds that had the largest impact on managing nutrients. =Approved MRBI Conservation Practices= The selected watersheds have to implement a system of practices that address nitrogen and phosphorus generation. MRBI approved practices help avoid, trap, and control nutrients from agricultural runoff. Multiple core and supporting conservation practices provide options for producers depending on their location and existing operations. Approved core practices were selected based on what proved to be most important in reducing the downstream loading of nutrients. Core practices include planting cover crops, constructing grassed waterways or riparian forest buffers, and wetland creation or enhancement. The NRCS allowed State Conservationists to choose supporting practices that address the primary water concerns that have developed within that particular state. Supporting practices include pasture and hayland planting, deep tillage in fields, field borders, and constructing a water and sediment control basin. Payment is received as the implementation of core and supporting practices proceed in a selected watershed.

It is the site of an Anglican church built in 1770 in what was then called Pownalborough or Frankfort, and was active until 1779. The church congregation was founded in 1760, and the church and parsonage were built with funding support from Dr. Silvester Gardiner, a major area landowner, and operated until 1779, when Jacob Bailey, the minister, fled the area because of his Loyalist views in the American Revolution. The site was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978. History The territory that is now Maine was part of the Province of Massachusetts Bay during the colonial period. The part of Lincoln County, Maine that included Dresden and surrounding towns was settled in the 1750s through the efforts of the Kennebec Proprietors, who held title to most of the land in the area. Most of the settlers placed on the eastern bank of the Kennebec were French and German Protestants, who in 1756 petitioned the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts for a minister. William McClenachan was sent to the area as an itinerant minister based on the former site of Fort Richmond, but left in 1758. In 1760, the proprietors engineered the creation of Lincoln County, with its headquarters at Frankfort (now Dresden, not to be confused with present-day Frankfort), and sent Jacob Bailey, a recent seminary graduate, to be its first settled minister. Bailey was at first settled near the Pownalborough Courthouse, which is where he held Anglican services until 1770, when Dr. Silvester Gardiner, the principal proprietor resident in the area, funded construction of a church and parsonage house. Bailey was Loyalist in his political views, and fled the area in 1779 amid hostility both to his political views and his religious ones, the latter occasioned by resentment and mistrust among powerful Congregationalist businessmen and politicians in the region. Bailey described the church that was built at Pownalborough as follows: \\"The dimensions of the Church are sixty feet in length including the chancel and thirty two feet in breadth. I acknowledge not only the generosity of Dr. Gardiner, but also the charitable assistance of several gentlemen in Marblehead and other places.\\"Batchelder, p. 27 The parish was formally dedicate as \\"St. John's\\" in 1773.Batchelder, p. 28 Congregationalists sought to dispute ownership of the land on which the church and parsonage were built, bringing suit against the parish; this matter was resolved out of court by Dr. Gardiner.Batchelder, p. 29 Despite considerable hostility to the church and Bailey personally with the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War in 1775, he kept the church open until 1778.Batchelder, pp. 32-36 He withdrew to Halifax, Nova Scotia in 1779.Batchelder, pp. 37-38 The church and parsonage thereafter fell into decay, although lay attempts to maintain it continued through the 1780s.

Description and history Westport Town Hall stands on the west side of SR 144, in the dispersed rural village center of Westport. It is located south of the Westport Community Church and the Squire Tarbox House. It is a single- story wood frame structure, with a gabled roof, clapboarded exterior, and granite foundation. Its street-facing front facade is symmetrical, with a central double door flanked by sash windows, with three sash windows at the balcony level, and a single sash window near the peak of the gable.

Due to extensive alterations, only a small number of interior features remain from the period of construction, including balcony panels and railings. with The church was built in the early 1790s as a parish church for the Jeremysquam district of Edgecomb, which was later separated as Westport. It was used principally by Free Will Baptists, and in 1828, when Westport was incorporated, it also served as town hall for a few years. Town meetings were then held in a district school, and the Free Will Baptists shared the building for a time with a Methodist congregation. The Baptists apparently disbanded in 1864, and the Methodist moved to the Westport Community Church, leaving the building vacant until 1885, when it was acquired by the town. In addition to its municipal functions, the building has served as a social venue and hosted the local Grange organization. The building is one of a small number of surviving Federal period church buildings in the state.

Built in the early 1760s, it was the first county courthouse for Lincoln County, which was established in 1760. It is the only surviving courthouse in the state of Maine that was built during the colonial period, and is now a museum owned and operated by the Lincoln County Historical Society. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1970. Description and history The Pownalborough Courthouse stands in what is now a rural area of western Dresden, overlooking the Kennebec River just to the west. It stands on grounds that were at the time of its construction the site of Fort Shirley, one of the first inland forts built by the British on the river. The courthouse has a roughly square three-story main block, framed in wood, covered by a hip roof, and clad in wooden clapboards. The main facade is five bays wide, with a center entrance flanked by pilasters and topped by an entablature and cornice. A single-story wing extends to one side. The interior has seen a variety of alterations, but retains original wide flooring. It has never been fitted with electricity or modern plumbing. with Lincoln County was separated from York County, Massachusetts (Maine then being part of Massachusetts) in 1760. It was named for Governor Thomas Pownall, and the town of Pownalborough (encompassing modern Dresden, Alna, Jefferson, and Wiscasset) was named in his honor. The proprietors who owned the land voted to build a courthouse that year, to be located on the grounds of Fort Shirley, which had been built in 1752 as a defense against Native American attacks. The fort's importance had declined since the construction of Fort Western further upriver, and it was thought that its facilities could be used to house a jail and keeper's quarters. Construction began on the courthouse in 1761, and the county's first court session was held in the unfinished building later that year. The building was not completed until 1769. In addition to housing the court facilities, the building also served as a tavern, an inn, a post office, a fencing hall, a dance hall, a church, and a meeting house, and had living quarters on the third floor. Those quarters were occupied by the fort commander, Major Samuel Goodwin, and were continuously occupied by his descendants into the 1930s. The local historical society purchased the property from Goodwin's descendants in 1954. It is now open seasonally (Memorial Day to Columbus Day) as a museum dedicated to local history; admission is charged. Famous cases held at the Court House included a property case that was argued by John Adams, as a young lawyer fresh out of school, who would someday become the second President in US history. John Adams wrote in his journals that he hated the journey to the Pownalborough Court House because of the muddy and unkempt road and always spoke at length about his hatred of trees because they blocked his path numerous times during the trip. He also was one of the few people to visit the court by road rather than by the kennebec river, which was considered the easier and safer way to travel. John Adams was offered a job with the Kennebec Proprietors to represent them in property cases, and he did so on the condition that he could work out of the Falmouth (now Portland, ME) Court House instead. This kicked off his career and eventually led him down his path of being a successful attorney. In addition to John Adams, the museum also was visited by Benedict Arnold during his famous expedition to Canada. When he got there, the court's caretaker Major Samuel Goodwin refused to give Benedict his maps of the region that he created himself. At the time, Major Goodwin was a loyalist, but after a physical altercation with his son, a patriot, Major Goodwin traveled to Fort Western and turned over the maps. We know this was the case because after the war, Major Goodwin wrote to George Washington demanding payment for the maps. The most controversial case to ever take place at the Pownalborough Court House was the trial of Judge North on the charge of attempted ravishment. This case is most notable because it was the first time that a woman gave expert medical testimony in the court in 1787. Martha Ballard was a midwife from Hallowell who was known for her low mortality rates, heroism, and devote religious beliefs. She was known for doing anything for her patients including crossing the Kennebec river in the dead of winter when no one else would to deliver babies. She was friends with the reverend and his wife Mrs. Rebecca Fowler. Judge North was not a fan of the Reverend and ran a campaign to get him fired and succeeded. In need of a new job, the Reverend left town to look for somewhere else to preach and left his wife behind. Mrs. Fowler told Martha Ballard that in the course of one week, three men had broken into her house and raped her, including Judge North. She said during the course of her husband's absence people would through things at her house and windows and try to break in. Martha Ballard begged Mrs. Fowler not to say anything and not bring the case, but she insisted. When charges were brought, Judge North evaded arrest stating that it was embarrassing to be arrested by his own men. He was brought to trial first. The other 2 defendants claimed they were out of town during the event. The most damning evidence was that Mrs. Fowler was pregnant and could not have conceived the baby with her husband because he was out of town. Judge North claimed that Mrs. Fowler was not a liar nor was she a person of low morals and that she simply mis-identified him. When Martha Ballard was called to testify, she wrote in her diary that she was certain of Judge North's guilt and so were all of her acquaintances. When Judge North was found not guilt, it shocked the religious Martha Ballard to her core, so much so that she refused to attend public church services for 7 years after that. It is important to note that the charges against Judge North were changed from a rape charge to attempted ravishment because rape was a capital offense. Further, at the time, cases where women were bringing claims, such as rape, were considered as tools for men to fight each other. Going into the trial, there would have been an assumption that the reverend told his wife to press rape charges as retaliation for getting fired. In addition to the museum, the Pownalborough Court House lands have a vast trail system including an ADA standard trail and ADA standard public bathroom.

The building was the work of local master builder Nathan Nutting Jr. (1804-1867), having since remained a significant example of transitional Federal-Greek Revival architecture. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2003 to ensure its preservation. Description and history The Bell Hill Meetinghouse is located at the top of Bell Hill in Otisfield, Maine, on the east side of Bell Hill Road. It is a single story rectangular wood-frame structure, with a projecting center bay on the main (west-facing) facade, and a square bell tower that rises from the central ridge near the western end of the gable roof. The projecting bay has two entry doors, each topped by a louvered fan, with small square sash windows above each, also topped by louvered fans. The bay, like the main facade, has a fully enclosed triangular pediment. The central bay is flanked by tall twelve- over-twelve windows, also topped by louvered fans. These windows are matched by those that line the long sides (north and south) of the building. All windows have wooden shutters, and the building is clad in vinyl siding, although its original trim has been carefully preserved. The tower's first stage is square, with no significant decoration. Above this is an open section with square posts at the corners which are decorated with paired pilasters. A low balcony railing stands between the posts on all four sides, and the church bell hangs in the opening. The posts support an entablature and an ogeed cornice. Above this is a dome which is surrounded by a low, narrow balustrade set between small columns at the corners. The dome is topped by a copper spire. The meetinghouse was built in 1838-39 by Nathan Nutting, Jr., a local resident who was raised on the family farm, but received training in woodwork in Boston, Massachusetts, before returning to Otisfield. Most of his work in the area was residential, the most notable being the family home, built in 1824. In the 1830s he received commissions to build churches in at least six area communities. This church was built to replace the town's 18th-century meetinghouse, which had been severely damaged by wind and rain. It is possible that this damage prompted the town to request Nutting's rapid construction of this building, using a plan he had previously used to build a church in Waterford. The church was used regularly for services until about 1887, and was revived for annual services in 1913. The building is now owned by the Bell Hill Meetinghouse Association, and is used for occasional services and functions such as weddings.

The common is a large grassy area fringed at the non- street edges with mature trees. The meeting house is sheathed in clapboards, and faces east. Its exterior appearance is fairly typical for Federal styles meeting houses of the period, except that its windows have Gothic Revival lancet point arches. The main facade is symmetrically arranged, with a pair of entry doors, topped by louvered lancet arches with moulded surrounds. There are two sash windows between the doors, and two above, all topped by the similar lancet arches and surrounds. A modern ramp provides handicapped access to the entrances. The side facades have four uniformly-placed windows that are larger (12-over-12 as opposed to 8-over-8) than those on the main facade. The rear facade has a single smaller window, and a modern concrete block chimney. The entrances lead into a vestibule area spanning the width of the building. A staircase in the northeast corner leads to a balcony space overlooking the nave. The nave takes up most of the building, and is generally divided into three sections of box pews, separated by aisles leading from the vestibule to the pulpit area. The pews all appear to be original, retaining elements such as doors, latches, and even some painted finish. The pulpit area is a flat open space at the rear of the building, which appears to once have had a raised platform. Originally part of Hebron, Oxford was incorporated in February 1829. Andrew Craigie, owner of a local mill, offered to fund the construction of the meeting house and donated of land for the common and cemetery (the latter no longer part of this property). The building was used by Congregationalists, Baptists, Methodists, and Free Will Baptists in rotation, as well as by town meetings. It continues to be used for town meetings.

The historic church building is a Stick style structure designed by Portland architect, Charles H. Kimball, and built in 1878. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1986. Architecture and building history The church building is a two-story wood frame structure, set on a narrow side street just off Main Street in Fryeburg center. It has board-and-batten siding, and a gable roof. A two-story tower at the southeast corner of the building provides the main entrance and a belfry, while a smaller engaged tower adorns the other corner of the main facade. The belfry of the main tower is a louvered square, and is topped by a pyramidal roof. The smaller tower is also topped by a pyramidal roof, but the base courses of the roof are flared out. The front-facing gable end of the church is heavily decorated with Stick style applied woodwork, including Gothic lancet-shaped headers over the windows and brackets under the eaves. Many of these details are repeated in the interior decoration, where wood inlay is found in the ceiling, pews, and other furnishings. In addition to the main sanctuary, the building houses a library, kitchen, pantry, and dining area. The building was designed by Portland architect Charles H. Kimball, and is one of his finest ecclesiastical works. It was built for a recently formed Swedenborgian congregation, and was completed in 1897 at a cost of $4,000. It was just the third Swedenborgian church in the state.

Completed in 1911 for a congregation established in 1815, it is the only known work in Maine of the Cleveland, Ohio partnership of Badgley and Nicklas, and one of Oxford County's finest late Gothic Revival churches. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2008. Deering Memorial was closed November 18, 2016 as an active house of worship. Description and history The Deering Church occupies a prominent lot on the north side of Main Street in South Paris, Maine, the main village of the town of Paris, the county seat of Oxford County. It is a single story cruciform structure with a projecting tower, built of coursed granite ashlar stone, with contrasting cast stone trim elements, and resting on a slightly raised foundation. The cruciform shape is limited in its width by the small lot: the transepts extend only to either side of the nave, in a building whose total length is . Buttresses reinforce the corners of the building and the tower, and also line the long sides of the nave. The tower has a crenellated parapet at the top, and houses a clock and bell which were also used in the building this one replaced. The church building is the third (all located on the same site) to be used by the Methodist congregation which was established in 1815 under the tutelage of Rev. John Adams of Poland. After deciding in 1909 that a new building was needed, William Deering, son of a local judge, contributed $16,000 to its construction, with the rest of the construction cost raised by subscription. The church was named in memory of Deering's parents. It is unclear how the Cleveland firm of Badgley and Nicklas was selected to design the building. The building's interior decorations were executed by Harry Hayman Cochrane, a noted regional muralist whose distinctive work also appears in Cumston Hall, Monmouth, Maine.

Aircraft  The aircraft was a Boeing 707-366C with the (serial number 20763 and serial 871) that had its maiden flight on 25 August 1973. The aircraft was registered as SU-AXA and was delivered to EgyptAir, and entered service on 20 September the same year. The aircraft was powered by Pratt & Whitney JT3D-7 turbofan engines.  Accident  Flight 864 was a regularly scheduled international passenger flight from Rome to Tokyo with stopovers in Cairo, Bombay and Bangkok. With 9 crew members and 44 passengers on board, flight 864 approached Bangkok. At 20:30 GMT (03:30 local time), the crew contacted the approach controller and reported about the distance of 33 nautical miles (61 km) from the airport‚Äôs radio beacon. At this time, conditions were reported as calm, with cloudiness from 2/8 to 4/8 at the lower border of 300 meters, air temperature of 25 ¬∞C at a dew point of 24¬∞C, visibility of 4000 meters, and an airfield pressure of 1007 mB.

Built in 1867, this small Italianate church is one of the least-altered period churches of rural Maine. Notably, neither electricity nor modern heating have been added to the sanctuary, and the only major modification to the building was the 1913 addition of a kitchen space to the rear of its basement level. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2002. Description and history The Universalist Church in West Sumner is the second-oldest church building in the village, after the now-deconsecrated Baptist Church, which was built in 1858. It is a small 1-1/2 story wood frame structure, built between June and October 1867. It rests on a granite foundation, and has a corrugated metal roof, which is topped by a squat square belfry with octagonal steeple. The main body of the church is clad in weatherboard, while the belfry section of the tower is flushboarded. The main facade, facing roughly northeast, has a pair of doorways symmetrically placed, with a tall round-arch window centered in between them at a raised level. The window arch has a keystone at the top, a motif repeated in the belfry, which also features round-arch louvered openings. The church is set on a lot that slopes downhill from the road, exposing its full basement. Large windows on the main level illuminate the sanctuary, while smaller windows under some of those provide lighting into the basement space, which houses the vestry and meeting spaces. A small bumpout on the southeast side of the building houses a modern bathroom, and a shed-roof addition, built in 1913, extends the basement to the rear and houses a kitchen. The main entrances provide access to vestibule areas, which are separated from the sanctuary by doors. The eastern vestibule has a hatch in the floor which provides access to the basement (which is otherwise only accessible from an outside doorway on the southeast side). The sanctuary is roughly square, with rows of bench pews divided by three aisles. At the northwest side of the sanctuary is a raised platform with a podium, settee, and chairs. Illumination is provided to the space by kerosene-fueled wall sconce fixtures, and by two ornate brass chandeliers with kerosene lamps covered by frosted globes. Heat is provided by a pair of wood stoves on the north side of the room. In addition to the church building, a period horse shed also stands on the property, which appears to date to the period of the church building's construction. Located south of the main building, it has a saltbox shape, and is accessed by a single barn door in the northeast wall.

It was built, and probably designed by, Ammi Cutter, a brickworker of some renown in the interior of western Maine. Completed in 1851, it is an architecturally significant example of Greek Revival. Its construction was occasioned by a slavery-related split in the local congregation. The building was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1986. Description and history The Lovell Village Church is a 1-1/2 story brick structure, with a gable roof topped by a wooden tower. The doors and windows have granite lintels and wooden sills. The main facade is three bays in width, with a slightly-recessed centered entrance flanked by sash windows. The corners of the building are marked by brick piers, which rise to a flat entablature. The gable end is fully enclosed, with a dentillated border, and a triangular louver in the center of the tympanum. The tower rises in stages, beginning with a square section finished in clapboards, above which is a stepped-down belfry, which is finished in flushboarding with corner pilasters and a full entablature. Above this is a hexagonal section which is topped by a round dome and weathervane. The Congregational Church was established in Lovell in the early 1800s, and held its services in the town meeting house. A local resident moved to Georgia in 1841, and during his time there, owned slaves. Upon his return to Lovell, the congregation divided on whether he should be readmitted to the fold based on this history. The split resulted in the construction of two new churches in the town, of which this is one. It was built in 1851 by Ammi Cutter, a brick maker and mason whose work was widely known in the region.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1998. Description and history The meeting house is a rectangular wood frame structure, sheathed in clapboards, and resting in a granite foundation. It has a low single-stage square tower with a shallow pyramidal roof, with spirelets at its corners. The main facade is unadorned, the gable ends only having short returns. It lacks windows, and has two symmetrically placed identical entrances, which are flanked by pilasters and topped by entablatures. The building corners have paneled pilasters, with an entablature running below the roofline along the sides of the building. Each side elevation has three large windows, which are evenly spaced but set toward the rear of the building. The rear elevation, like the front, has no windows. The building is located at the northeast corner of the common, a grassy area. The front entrances lead into a vestibule area, from which doorways lead into the nave, and a stairway leads to a now-closed gallery. The nave is populated with box pews that have Federal style woodwork. The pulpit is located in the southeast corner, framed by a monumental Greek Revival entablature and pilasters. Window and other trim is modest, and the walls and cove ceiling are plastered. The building was built in 1816 to house Baptist and Congregationalist congregations, and to provide a location for town meetings. When built, it apparently had a tall tower with spire, two rows of windows, and the gallery was accessed by an outside staircase located between the two entrances. In 1825 the windows were altered to their present configuration, and the box pews were installed. The building was given its Greek Revival features in 1857, along with the inside gallery staircase and the tower. The building was used by both congregations and the town until about 1857, after which it was used exclusively by the Baptist congregation.

The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1986. Description and history The North Waterford Church was established in 1860 by congregants of the main Waterford Congregational Church located in Waterford Village who lived in northern Waterford and did not want to travel that distance for services. The church was designed by Thomas Holt, a native of Bethel who designed several other churches in the state, but is more widely known for his railroad architecture.

On 7 May 2002, the Boeing 737-566 on the route crashed into a hill near Tunis‚ÄìCarthage International Airport. Of the 6 crew members and 56 passengers, 3 crew members and 11 passengers died, making a total of 14 fatalities.  Accident Summary  Flight 843 took off from Cairo International Airport on the afternoon of 7 May 2002 to Tunis Carthage International Airport in Tunis, Tunisia. The passengers consisted of 27 Egyptians, 16 Tunisians, 3 Algerians, 3 Jordanians, and 2 Britons. The aircraft was a Boeing 737-566. The flight crew members were captain Ashraf Abdel-Aal (Arabic: ÿ£ÿ¥ÿ±ŸÅ ÿπÿ®ÿØÿßŸÑÿπÿßŸÑ) and first officer Khalid Odeh (Arabic: ÿÆÿßŸÑÿØ ÿπŸàÿØÿ©). The plane was flying in instrument meteorological conditions (IMC) due to fog, rain and blowing sand on approach to runway 11 of Tunis-Carthage Airport. The aircraft crashed into a hill in the Nahli area in the north of Tunis. The aircraft came to rest at an elevation of 750 ft above sea level and from the airport. Of the 6 crew and 56 passengers on board, 3 crew members (both flight crew members and one flight attendant) and 11 passengers were killed in the crash. The investigation found the Minimum safe altitude warning device at Tunis-Carthage did not cover the approach for Runway 11, and recommended studying ways to improve the volume of sky covered by the device in order to cover approaches to all the runways. The cause of the crash was a controlled flight into terrain. According to the management of Carthage Airport, the pilots decided to carry out the normal landing at the airport. The accident occurred during the landing process. There are two theories regarding the accident: * The first theory is that the landing gear failed to extend while the plane was on approach. The pilot asked ATC to circle the airport while attempting to lower the landing gear while simultaneously dumping fuel, a standard precaution when anticipating a crash landing. The Tunisian Transport Minister believed that, because this type of aircraft can not quickly dump fuel, the pilot had to spend more time circling the airport in the mountainous terrain around Carthage. With the bad weather and poor visibility, the flight crew likely did not see the mountain until it was too late. This account is supported by the lack of fire at the crash site. * The second theory is that the plane did not suffer any technical fault, and that the bad weather and lack of visibility caused the pilot to descend below the minimum safe altitude for the Carthage airport. An analysis of the flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder did not reveal any indication that the landing gear had failed to deploy or that there were any unusual actions on the part of the crew or other circumstances apart from the terrible weather. EgyptAir's vice president of safety, Shaker Qilada, stated that there were no technical faults with the plane and that it was a normal landing procedure. The plane broke into two halves and the back of the plane caught fire. As a result, most of the victims were sitting in the back of the plane. Rescue teams headed to the crash area to rescue the injured passengers and retrieve the bodies of those killed. Rescue workers reported having difficulty reaching the site of the crash in the rough terrain.  Survivor accounts  One of the survivors said that \\"the plane had left Egypt normally, but when we entered the Tunisian airspace we found an unusual climatic situation that I had not seen since the year. And we stayed for about half an hour between the fog and could not see the surface of the earth at all,\\" adding that \\"while the pilot was preparing to land at the airport in Tunisia, the plane suddenly crashed into the mountain, and that maybe something wrong from the pilot and something from the plane.\\"  Aftermath  After the accident, the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board sent a team of investigators to assist authorities in Tunisia with their investigation. The team included representatives from Boeing and General Electric Engines.

The value of the plane's compensation amounted to 22 million dollars, or 110 million pounds.

Sustainability in New Zealand is being increasingly recognised as being good practice and the government has made some moves toward this goal. History Over the relatively short human occupation of New Zealand, huge changes had been made to the natural environment. Although efforts were made by a small number of individuals and organisations in highlighting environmental issues, only ad-hoc measures were made by the government at central and local level. Sustainability became a concept that emerged from the environmental movement which become a social and political movement of its own right in the 1960s. In 1972 the Values Party formed, being the first national-level Green party. The New Zealand government has enacted legislation to enshrine sustainability principles in law, notably the Resource Management Act 1991. It was a landmark piece of legislation, being the first to adopt the principle of sustainability. In 2003 the government announced the Sustainable Development Programme of Action. The Govt3 programme was also announced that year, but was cancelled in March 2009. As in many other countries, there were demand for sustainable products and services and some companies began filling this demand. In March 2007 Westpac became the \\"first New Zealand bank to offer a 'green' home loan.\\" There was also increasing calls for green growth, a path of economic growth that uses natural resources in a sustainable manner. The Ministry of Economic Development set up the Green Growth Advisory Group. The lobby group Pure Advantage formed in July 2011 to promote green growth and in 2012 released a report stating that New Zealand should improve its environmental performance and improve its image. Some of the environmental rankings, including Yale University's Environmental Performance Index, showed that New Zealand was not improving its overall sustainability. New Zealand is a green country although it is small it still continues to be an eco friendly country. Strengths The international business adviser, author and speaker Paul Gilding believes New Zealand dairy farmers have a significant advantage over other countries because they run pasture-fed systems, rather than grain-fed as in the US. Another advantage is New Zealand's reputation as a clean and green country, at least compared with most other countries. \\"As the demand rises for clean and green food, the better off New Zealand dairy is,\\" Gilding said.Fonterra bringing in Greenpeace ex-boss See also *Conservation in New Zealand *Energy Efficiency and Conservation Authority *Environment of New Zealand *Generation Zero (organisation) *Green building in New Zealand *New Zealand Centre for Sustainable Cities References Further reading *}  * External links *sustainability.govt.nz *Sustainability and Society at Landcare Research ;Funding *Sustainable Management Fund operated by the Ministry for the Environment *Sustainable Initiatives Fund ;Organisations *Centre for Sustainability *Sustainable Business Council *Sustainability Council of New Zealand *Sustainable Living Education Trust *Sustainable Otautahi Christchurch *Transition Towns New Zealand Aotearoa *Pure Advantage *350.org Aotearoa Category:Climate change organisations based in New Zealand ","title":"Sustainability in New Zealand"},{"id":"24930220","text":"Disruptively camouflaged A-7D Corsairs on a disruptively painted concrete surface, Thailand, 1972 Aircraft camouflage is the use of camouflage on military aircraft to make them more difficult to see, whether on the ground or in the air. Given the possible backgrounds and lighting conditions, no single scheme works in every situation. A common approach has been a form of countershading, the aircraft being painted in a disruptive pattern of ground colours such as green and brown above, sky colours below. For faster and higher-flying aircraft, sky colours have sometimes been used all over, while helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft used close to the ground are often painted entirely in ground camouflage. Aircraft flying by night have often been painted black, but this actually made them appear darker than the night sky, leading to paler night camouflage schemes. There are trade-offs between camouflage and aircraft recognition markings, and between camouflage and weight. Accordingly, visible light camouflage has been dispensed with when air superiority was not threatened or when no significant aerial opposition was anticipated. Aircraft were first camouflaged during World War I; aircraft camouflage has been widely employed since then. In World War II, disruptive camouflage became widespread for fighters and bombers, sometimes combined with countershading. Some air forces such as the German Luftwaffe varied their paint schemes to suit differing flight conditions such as the skyglow over German cities, or the sands of the Mediterranean front. During and after World War II, the Yehudi lights project developed counter-illumination camouflage using lamps to increase the brightness of the aircraft to match the brightness of the sky. This was abandoned with improvements in radar, which seemed to render visible light camouflage redundant. However, aircraft continue to be painted in camouflage schemes; recent experiments have again explored active camouflage systems which allow colours, patterns and brightness to be changed to match the background, and some air forces have painted their fighters in digital camouflage patterns. Stealth technology, as in the Lockheed F-117 Nighthawk, aims to minimize an aircraft's radar cross-section and infrared signature, effectively providing multi-spectral camouflage at the price of reduced flying performance. Stealth may extend to avoiding or preventing vapour contrails. History World War I Disruptively patterned French Nieuport 16 The French were among the first to introduce camouflage, starting with Nieuport fighters with which they tested a variety of schemes during the Battle of Verdun in early 1916. A light blue-grey Nieuport 11 was flown by Georges Guynemer which he named Oiseau Bleu (Blue Bird) while some Voisin IIIs were also painted in the same colour. At the same time, disruptive schemes using several colours were also tried out.Toelle, Alan. \\"Nieuport Camouflage of 1916, Parts 1 and 2\\", color artwork by Ronny Bar., Windsock Worldwide, Volume 23, Issues Nos. 5 and 6. Berkhamsted UK: Albatros Productions, 2007. By mid-1916 a silver-grey aluminium dope became the norm for Nieuports until the French introduced a standardized disruptive camouflage scheme for combat aircraft in 1917. This was used widely on such aircraft as the Breguet XIV and SPAD XIII that consisted of dark and light green, dark and light brown, black (sometimes omitted) and an underside of grey or beige. Fokker D.VII in lozenge camouflage In mid-1916, the Germans experimented with a transparent cellulose acetate covering on several aircraft, including a Fokker E.III, that rendered the aircraft nearly invisible from most angles, however the sun reflecting off it defeated it even before its lack of durability did.Guttman, 2014 pp.34-35 When the Germans fielded the Albatros D.III biplane, pilots readily confused them with similarly-shaped Nieuports which used the same combination of colours. The solution the Germans came up with was to replace the red-brown with purple, which from a distance still worked well as a camouflage colour, but could readily identify the aircraft as German. As in France, individual manufacturers applied a variety of camouflage finishes, dependent on their own interpretations of what was required. Light grey (LFG Roland C.II), patches of greens and browns (Fokker D.II) and streaky olive green finish over a turquoise base (Fokker Dr.I) were all used until April 1917, when pre-printed lozenge camouflage (Lozenge-Tarnung) was introduced with up to 5 colours. Aircraft of the British Royal Flying Corps and Royal Naval Air Service were either coloured on top and sides with a protective dope called PC.10 (a mixture of yellow ochre and lampblack) or PC.12 (iron oxide and lamp black) while the undersides were given a clear dope. These colours were not intended originally as camouflage but were developed to prevent the fabric from being damaged by UV radiation from the sun, and their camouflage effect was an added bonus. Both services also used black for night bombers, while a wide variety of experimental camouflages were tried out for specific roles such as trench strafing, with multiple colours. Alternatives were tested in late 1917 at Orfordness Experimental Station, resulting in the introduction of NIVO (Night Invisible Varnish Orfordness) in early 1918; this was used for all external surfaces on night bombers until superseded by World War II colours. Ship-style dazzle camouflage was tested on aircraft such as Sopwith Camels, but was not used on operational aircraft. World War II Supermarine Spitfire in disruptively patterned RAF 'Sand and Spinach' uppersurface camouflage, 1941 During the Munich Crisis of 1938, the Royal Air Force implemented plans to camouflage its aircraft in its disruptively patterned Temperate Land Scheme of \\"Dark Earth\\" and \\"Dark Green\\" above and \\"Sky\\" (similar to a duck egg blue) below. This scheme was known colloquially as \\"Sand and Spinach\\" when the pattern was painted on at the factory, large rubber mats serving as guides. For many types of aircraft, particularly fighters, the rubber mats were reversed for even and odd serials, named A and B patterns. The undersides, and lower half of the fuselage, of night bombers were painted black. Variations on fighters at the start of the war included painting the underside of one wing black. Later in the war the dark earth was replaced with \\"ocean grey\\" and the underside was \\"Sea Grey\\". Naval aircraft used two tones of grey over sky. Coastal Command, which carried out patrols for enemy vessel over the open sea, used white instead of sky. In the North Africa campaign a combination of \\"Dark Earth\\" and \\"Middle stone\\" were used for the top surfaces, the underside was \\"Azure blue\\". The same azure was used on day bombers overseas. High flying RAF Photographic Reconnaissance Unit aircraft were given an all over blue colour, but they were given \\"licence in the camouflaging\\" of their aircraft.Air Publication 2656A in \\"Development of Squadron Markings and Codes 1939‚Äì1945\\" Air of Authority. 26 May 2017 Some United States Army Air Forces aircraft used a variation of the British camouflage schemes (mostly on aircraft originally built to RAF orders) but most USAAF aircraft did not use multiple shades on the top side of the aircraft. Instead, most were camouflaged in olive drab above and neutral gray below, though some had the edges of flying surfaces painted in medium green. In the later stages of the war, camouflage was often dispensed with, both to save time in manufacturing and to reduce weight, leaving aircraft with a natural metal finish. Soviet Air Forces aircraft were painted with shades of green, either plain or in disruptive patterns above, and blue-grey on the undersurfaces. Countershaded Messerschmitt Bf 110G night fighter, with pale underside to match skyglow The basic German (Luftwaffe) camouflage during most of the war was based on a light blue undersurface and a two tone splinter pattern of various greens for the upper surfaces. In the first year of the war, the top colours were dark green and black-green; later, lighter and more greyish colours were used for fighters, though bombers mostly maintained the dark green/black green camouflage. The side of the fuselage on fighters and some light bombers often had irregular patches sprayed on, softening the transition from the upper to the lower surface. The undersides of night bombers and night fighters were painted black early in the war, but by 1943 switched to lighter base colours of their usual light blue undersurfaces for aircraft flown by day, and a light gray base coat over the upper surfaces to match the skyglow over the German cities they were tasked with defending. A special pattern was devised for the Mediterranean front, consisting of a sand yellow that often faded to tan, with or without olive green patches. As Germany lost air supremacy, ground camouflage became increasingly important, and late war fighters received a two tone scheme like the British Sand and Spinach, in dark brown and light green.Ullmann, M. (2000): Oberfl√§chenschutzverfahren und Anstrichstoffe der deutschen Luftfahrtindustrie und Luftwaffe 1935‚Äì1945. Bernard & Graefe, Cold War and after Automimicry: underside of A-10 Thunderbolt II with false canopy painted in, as if the plane was the right way up During the Cold War, camouflage was partially abandoned; for example, glossy anti-flash white was used on aircraft as protection from nuclear flash, including high-flying Royal Air Force nuclear weapon-carrying V-bombers. When SAMs made high level attack too dangerous, the plans for RAF bombers changed to low level attack and camouflaged top surfaces returned. Apart from American and Soviet strategic forces, however, camouflage continued to be applied tactically. For example in the Korean War, American B-29 bombers were switched to night flying with black undersides when Chinese fighters became a significant threat. In the Vietnam War, North Vietnamese MiG-21 fighters were painted by hand in green ground camouflage patterns, while the USAAF and US Navy both restarted experiments with painted camouflage. In the Soviet‚ÄìAfghan War, Soviet Mil Mi-24 helicopters were camouflaged in a sand and spinach pattern. In the 1970s, heat-seeking missiles were developed that had a range greater than the visual acuity of pilots. Aircraft camouflage now had two major threats that it was not able to fully defeat‚Äîradar and infrared detection. Camouflage accordingly became less important. However, by the 1980s, the human eye was again seen as sufficiently important a threat that aircraft like the ground attack A-10 Thunderbolt (Warthog) were painted in camouflage schemes that included both disruptive ground coloration and automimicry (deceptive self-imitation), in the form of a false canopy on the underside. Methods recognition markings, such as this Lockheed F-5 Lightning's 1944 invasion stripes used so that allied planes would not be mistaken for the enemy during the invasion of France Camouflage for aircraft is complicated by the fact that the aircraft's background varies widely, depending on the location of the observer, the nature of the background and the aircraft's motion. For this reason, military aircraft were often painted to match the sky when viewed from below, and to either match the ground or break up the aircraft's outline when viewed from above. This is a form of countershading, likely to work best on aircraft such as heavy bombers that do not fly inverted during combat. Because of the way light hits it, patterns of dark and light will often be present on an aircraft even if it is entirely one color, making it easier to see Reflections and specular highlights can be counteracted by painting an aircraft in neutral shades with a non-reflective, matte finish. There is a trade-off between the effectiveness of camouflage and the size of recognition markings: larger markings reduce the risk of friendly fire through misrecognition, but compromise camouflage. Ground camouflage Sea King helicopter in snow camouflage Ground camouflage is used to delay visual acquisition from the air of an aircraft that is on or near the ground. Light sand has been used for aircraft used over deserts, blues and greys for aircraft over the sea, and greens and browns for aircraft that are expected to operate in forested areas. However, a camouflaged aircraft either on the ground or flying low over the ground in bright sunlight remains vulnerable to being detected from above because of its own shadow cast on the ground. This can reduce an aircraft's camouflage effectiveness at altitudes up to , particularly if the ground surface is pale and relatively uniform. Helicopters are often painted in ground camouflage, sometimes in regional or seasonal forms such as snow camouflage. Fixed-wing aircraft, too, are occasionally painted with snow camouflage, as for example on Soviet fighters and Luftwaffe Stukas on the Eastern Front in winter, in Swedish trials in 1970, and RAF Jaguars on exercise in Norway. Air camouflage Camouflage for an airborne aircraft may attempt to provide concealment with colours resembling the background. For example, until 1941, Royal Air Force fighters were painted in ground colours (dark green and brown) above, and sky colours below. However, aircraft were being lost, and pilots reported that the colours used made their fighters conspicuously darker than the sky. The Air Fighting Development Unit at RAF Duxford studied the problem, and in the summer of 1941 replaced the dark brown with a paler color, \\"ocean grey\\"; the sky blue on the underside was similarly replaced by a paler \\"sea grey\\" to reduce visibility against the bright sky. Similar adjustments were made by the Luftwaffe. Towards the end of the war, allied air superiority made visible light camouflage less important, and some American aircraft were flown in unpainted (silver colored) metal to save weight. World War II Hawker Hurricane night fighter in overall black camouflage Night camouflage Military aircraft flying at night have often been painted black or other dark colours, applied to just the underside of some aircraft and to the entirety of others, in the hope of reducing the risk of being seen in enemy searchlights or by night fighters.Stephenson, Hubert Kirk. (1948) Applied Physics, pp. 200, 258. Science in World War II; Office of Scientific Research and Development. Volume 6 of Science in World War II (Atlantic Monthly Press Book). Editors: Chauncey Guy Suits and George Russell Harrison. Little, Brown. However, aircraft camouflaged with black paint are actually darker than the night sky, making them more visible to observers not using searchlights. The undersides of Heinkel 111 night bombers were painted black. The De Havilland Mosquito was similarly initially painted black when used as a night fighter; matte black was found to be the best at reducing the aircraft's visibility against searchlights, but the aircraft's speed was reduced by compared to glossy black, which, being smoother, produced less drag. Since, however, black camouflage made the planes conspicuous on moonlit nights and against cloud, a variation of a day camouflage scheme was eventually chosen. Active camouflage Yehudi lights raised the average brightness of an aircraft to match the sky. In the early years of World War II, German U-boats often escaped attack by aircraft because they spotted the aircraft while it was still far away as a black dot in the sky, no matter what camouflage colours were used. To solve this problem, in 1943 the U.S. Navy, following the Canadian diffused lighting camouflage trials on warships, conducted secret experiments on counter-illumination in the Yehudi lights project. Sealed beam lights were mounted on the leading edge of the wing of a Grumman TBM-3D Avenger, and around its engine cowling, with the lamps facing forward. The intensity of the lamps was adjusted to match the background sky as seen from an observer in a surface ship. Aircraft with Yehudi lights were not detected until away under conditions where aircraft without the lights were detected away. Though successful, the system was not put into production because of improved radar detection. During the Vietnam War, Yehudi lights were again tried, this time mounted to an F-4 Phantom painted in a dull blue- and-white camouflage pattern. The experiment reduced by 30% the distance at which an observer visually acquired the Phantom. In 1997, active camouflage was again investigated, this time with thin computer-controlled fluorescent panels or light-emitting polymer covering much of an aircraft's surface. Lockheed F-117 Nighthawk, the first operational aircraft to use stealth technology to minimize its radar cross-section Stealth technology Stealth technology aims to make aircraft almost undetectable by radar or other sensors, whether infrared, visible, or acoustic. This is effectively multi- spectral camouflage. Work began on stealth technology in America in 1958. The Lockheed F-117 Nighthawk was the first operational aircraft designed to use stealth technology to minimize its radar cross-section; it began operations in secrecy in 1983. Its low detectability was traded-off against performance in other areas, including reduced thrust and only subsonic speed. The aircraft's faceted shape reduced the reflection of radar back to the receiver, at the expense of making the aircraft aerodynamically unstable, requiring a fly-by- wire flight system to maintain controlled flight. The infrared signatures of stealth aircraft can be reduced by designing exhaust nozzles to mix the hot gases with cool ambient air, by placing the nozzles above the wing to conceal them from ground-based observers, and by avoiding the use of afterburners, as with the Northrop Grumman B-2 Spirit bomber. Lockheed U-2 had an external mirror (top, centre) enabling pilot to check for giveaway contrails. Preventing contrails Camouflage may extend beyond an aircraft's airframe. High-flying aircraft can sometimes be detected by their vapor contrails. Researchers have considered whether these might be reduced with the use of chemical additives. Work was carried out on a contrail management system for B-2 stealth bombers in 1994. From the Second World War onwards, reconnaissance pilots took care to avoid creating contrails, varying their altitude as necessary; the Lockheed U-2 reconnaissance aircraft was equipped with a mirror to enable the pilot to see if the plane was creating a contrail, and to take action accordingly. Digital camouflage Digital camouflage patterns, widely used for uniforms with designs such as CADPAT and MARPAT, have been applied to the aircraft of some armed forces. For example, in 2008 Slovakia repainted its MiG-29 fighters in a disruptive pattern designed by HyperStealth, \\"Digital Thunder\\". In 2017, a prototype of the Russian air force's Sukhoi Su-57 flew with a countershaded digital camouflage scheme, all dark above except for a multi-scale pattern at the edges.

Built in 1842-3, the church is architecturally significant as a good local example of Greek Revival and Gothic Revival style, and is artistically significant for a decorative stenciled trompe l'oeil artwork on the ceiling and sanctuary end wall. The property was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1994. Description The Oxford Congregational Church is a T-shaped wood frame structure, sheathed partially in clapboard and partially in aluminum siding, with gable roofs on both sections of the T. The main sanctuary is fronted by a colonnade of four paneled posts, above which is an enclosed area housing a gallery. The main entrance, centered on this facade, consists of a set of double doors, flanked by sidelight windows with diamond lights. The gallery area has two symmetrical placed sash windows, and pilasters continue the supporting posts up to the fully pedimented gable end. Above the entrance rises a square tower, whose stages have pilastered corners, parapeted edges, and spires at the corners. The second stage, housing the bell, has square louvered openings. The tower is topped by a square steeple stylistically matching the corner spires. The sides of the main block have three tall sash windows. Behind the main block is the top of the T, a crosswise two-story frame section built in 1956. The church in 2014 The interior of the main block begins with a vestibule area, from which stairs lead to the gallery on either side, and doorways lead into the nave. The nave has the original wooden box pews with Greek Revival woodwork. The doorways leading to the nave are framed by paneled pilasters with Gothic Revival woodwork. The interior of the nave and sanctuary are most notable for the trompe l'oeil art work, which (needing restoration) is believed to give the appearance of much greater size to the interior. It is believed to have been added c. 1880, during one of the periodic redecorations of the building. Other stenciled artwork is known to have been added in 1913 by Monmouth artist Harry Cochrane, and in 1945 by R. J. Morin. The Oxford congregation was organized in 1826, and originally shared a meeting house with the local Baptist congregation. The growth in size of the latter forced the Congregationalists from those premises in 1840, and they temporarily met in a local schoolhouse until the present building was built in 1842-3. The distinctive colonnaded front is believed to be one of the early examples of this form, which appears in only a few surviving churches in Maine.

The indoor theme park was inaugurated by the Vice President of Indonesia, Jusuf Kalla, exactly on September 9, 2009 (09-09-09). Trans Studio itself is a part of The Trans Studio World project, which will include Trans Walk and Rodeo Drive, Trans Studio, Trans hotels, and offices of Mega Bank.The World's Biggest Indoor Theme Park. Under the management of PT. Trans Kalla, the Mega Development Project will provide an integrated development, comprising not only an indoor theme park, but also shopping mall, supermarket, hotel, office area, recreational beach area, and residential area. The whole project was scheduled to be completed sometime in 2010. Background Trans Studio is located on the main road of Metro Tanjung Bunga Street, Makassar. The indoor theme park consists four zones with 22 features and rides, which is able to hold 5,000 people. Trans Studio is developed under the management of PT. Trans Kalla, a partnership between Para Group and Kalla Group. Chairul Tanjung, the founder and the owner of Para Group, is the number 18th richest Indonesian businessman. He owns Bank Mega and television broadcasting company, Trans Corp. In fact, Trans Corp, who operates private television stations TransTv and TV7, is the first television station ever to own an indoor theme park. On the other hand, Kalla Groups is owned by Jusuf Kalla, former Vice President of Indonesia. Together, Chairul Tanjung and Jusuf Kalla created PT. Trans Kalla in 2007. Para Group is responsible for funding and constructing the entire facility, while Kalla Group is responsible for providing the land. Para Group holds 55 percent of the share and Kalla Group holds 45 percent. Design Trans Studio Theme Park was conceptually designed by the Goddard Group- a Los Angeles-based entertainment firm responsible for many attractions at Universal Studios and Six Flags. The project was overseen by Gary Goddard (CEO), Barry Kemper (Producer), and Taylor Jeffs (Creative Director). Contributing designers include Christian Hope, Mick Reinman, Bob Baranick, Brent Kato, Phil Mendez, and Kohei Nakajima. The park's graphic identity was designed by Lee Roe. Trans Studio World Trans Studio World is a Mega Development project under the management of PT. Trans Kalla. The project includes Trans Studio (largest indoor theme park as of 2009), Trans Walk and Rodeo Drive, Trans Hotel, residential area, recreational beach area, and office area. This giant project takes investment more than IDR 3 trillions (approximately USD 312 million), and one-third of the investment goes to Trans Studio. Exactly 50 percent of the fund for Trans Studio World project comes from bank loan from BRI and the rest is from loan from other banks, stock share holder, and the company's internal cash. The Director of Trans Studio Management, Wibowo Iman Sumantri, has confirmed the expense of Trans Studio reached IDR 1 trillion (USD 104 million). On the other hand, Budiman Wijaya, the director of Trans Kalla Management, confirms that the cost of the rides themselves already exceeds IDR 300 million (USD 30,000). Yet, the management is still optimistic that this project will bring fortune to them.Trans studio makassar Sebagai Indoor Theme Park Terbesar Di Dunia. http://orbit99tours.blogspot.com/2009/10/trans-studio- makassar-sebagai-indoor.html In the beginning of the project, the indoor theme park was planned to be only 2.4 hectares wide; however, the feasibility study and survey apparently showed further growth. The Trans Kalla management later decided to extend the area from 2.4 hectares to 2.7 hectares. With the extended size of Trans Studio, the target of visitors had also been increased from 1.6 million to 2 million during the first year. The South Sulawesi provincial administration and the Makassar municipality expects the theme park would be able to stimulate economic growth, especially in Makassar. The first step of the construction was to build Trans Studio and Trans Walk at the same time on 110,000 m2 land. The management was expecting a soft opening of Trans Studio in April 2009; however, they could not complete both Trans Studio and Trans Walk as planned; therefore Trans Studio was inaugurated in advance. Meanwhile, the grand opening started on May 20, 2009. Trans Hotel and Residential area with access to the beach will be the next facility to be built.The Trans Studio Walk and the rest of the project was forecasted to be completed in June 2010. Trans Studio has the largest parking area in South East Asia that can hold more than 2,700 vehicles. In addition to this whole giant project, PT. Trans Kalla is expecting to do similar projects in Balikpapan, Bandung, and Jakarta.Indonesia gets world‚Äôs largest indoor theme park (October 02, 2009). http://www.banmoco.co.uk/indonesia-gets-worlds- largest-indoor-theme-park-22120/ Location Questions surface regarding the fact that the project is constructed in Makassar, the capital city of South Sulawesi, instead of Jakarta, the capital city of Indonesia itself. There are factors which make Makassar a high potential area for the attraction. Makassar is one of the biggest cities in Indonesia with a population of over a million people. In spite of the population, there are still a lot of high potential areas to build and develop in Makassar, unlike the overcrowded Jakarta. In addition, the economic growth in Makassar is quite high; its 9% gross domestic product (GDP) surpasses the average of gross national product (GNP) that is 7%. Another reason is that South Sulawesi is the main gateway to eastern Indonesia, which hold potential to economic prospects for the next five to six years, during which Trans Kalla would have already reached the breaking-even point (return in construction and development cost).Trans Studio Makassar: Indoor Theme Park Terbesar Di Dunia (September 4, 2009) Trans Kalla management expects by choosing Makassar for Trans Studio location, they will be able to reach and embrace an international market. The existence in the tourism area, that are close to elite residential and business territory is advantageous for Makassar. Since Trans Studio World is located close to the residential area of the middle and the upper class, as well as the business area in the independent city, Tanjung Bunga, makes Trans Studio World a highly potential market. The Strait Makassar coast in the north and west of the location is another beneficial attraction that will become part of the concept of the whole development. Besides economic considerations, the reason behind the establishment of Trans Studio Theme Park in Makassar is because Kalla Group is the one who provided the land (Jusuf Kalla was born and raised in Makassar). Attractions As a part of the entertainment, Trans Studio will provide the first mono train in Indonesia. The theme park consists of 22 features and amusement rides including Central Studio, Lost City, Magic Corner, Tsunami Island and Cartoon City. Many of the rides in Trans Studio are adopted from TransTV's and Trans7's shows such as Dunia Lain, Si Bolang, Jelajah, Ayun Ombak, and Angin Beliung; yet, some of them are adopted from Universal Studios and Disneyland in the United States. The rides also contain space simulation program of several television stations such as Trans TV, Trans 7, and other events in Indonesia.

She is at the centre of the various plots, both the comedic and the romantic. She has various suitors. Background Olivia is a beautiful lady of noble birth who lives in Illyria. Before the play begins, she has recently lost her brother who was her guardian after her father died. This loss has made her grief-stricken and she has refused to see anyone who does not reside in her household and declared that she will be in mourning for seven years (The element itself, till seven years' heat, Shall not behold her face at ample view). Malvolio and Olivia Sebastian Because of her wealth and beauty, Olivia attracts various men (Malvolio, Sir Andrew Aguecheek) who wish to marry her. The play begins with the Duke of Illyria, Orsino, pining away over his love for Olivia while she refuses to accept him as a suitor. Sir Andrew has been invited to her household by Sir Toby, and Andrew hopes to use his stay to make Olivia his bride. Malvolio uses his position as steward to gain her affections. Despite all of the rumpus going on at her home, Olivia refuses all visitors until Orsino sends his new page, the protagonist of the play, Viola, to call on her. Viola has been recently shipwrecked and she has taken on the disguise of a boy so that she may work for Orsino with no one knowing her true identity. During the shipwreck, Viola was separated from her brother, Sebastian, and she believes that he has died. Olivia quickly falls in love with the witty Cesario (Viola's name when she is in disguise) because Cesario is unafraid of saying what he/she is thinking, even though Cesario never says anything nice to Olivia (except, of course, when speaking Orsino's messages). Cesario also compliments Olivia on her beauty, something that helps heal Olivia's heart from the losses she has recently incurred. Olivia attempts to woo the young Cesario/Viola and repeatedly asks/lures him to come back to her estate by using various tricks and problems. Olivia eventually comes to the conclusion that she must marry him. However, in a case of mistaken identity, she marries Viola's twin brother, Sebastian. All ends well, however, because Sebastian and his sister are extremely similar. The climax of the play takes place at Olivia's estate. It is here that Olivia and Sebastian are hastily married, Viola and Sebastian rediscover each other, Malvolio is rescued, and Orsino proposes to Viola.\\"Shakespeare Reference Center Depictions in film and on stage One of Shakespeare's most popular plays, Twelfth Night has been produced for both the stage and film multiple times.

Built in 1865, the Greek Revival church building is notable as one of a very small number of 19th- century churches in Maine with original Trompe-l'≈ìil artwork on its walls and ceilings. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985. Description and history The church is located in the historic village of Rumford Point, close to a bridge crossing the Androscoggin River. It is a single-story wood frame structure, with a relatively simple two-stage tower topped by a steeple and weathervane. The main facade is three bays wide, with the entrance at the center, framed by pilasters and a fully pedimented gable, set above decorative panels. The flanking bays, like those on the side walls, have tall sash windows. The first stage of the tower is square, finished in clapboards, while the second stage, which houses the belfry, is flushboarded, and has round-arched louvered openings. The church was built in 1865. The church's most striking feature is the series of frescoed paintings on its walls and ceilings. Apparently painted by the itinerant artist Jonathan Adams Bartlett, they are among the youngest and rarest such work known in the state from the 19th century. The paintings are a Trompe-l'≈ìil depiction of a domed ceiling, with the walls painted to give the illusion of a much larger choir/apse space. The ceiling art has experienced some water damage.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. Description and history The Union Church is located on the east side of High Street, up the hill north from the center of Buckfield. It is a single-story wood frame structure, with a gable roof, granite foundation, and two-stage tower with steeple. The main (south-facing) facade is a symmetrical three bays, with the center projecting section supporting the tower. The side bays house matching entrances, each framed by Federal style pilasters and entablature, with a Gothic-arched window directly above. The center bay has a tall Gothic-arched window, with a gabled pediment at the roofline. Above this rises the tall square first stage of the tower, also with a Gothic-arched window on the front facade. A cornice at the top of this section gives way to an octagonal belfry with arched openings, and then a steeple that begins with a reduced-scale louvered octagonal section. The sides and rear of the church each have three Gothic-arched windows. The church was built in 1831-32, originally housing several different religious denominations. Its use declined over the course of the 19th century, and it was rescued from decay by Buckfield native John Davis Long, who donated funds to rehabilitate the structure provided the town purchased it for use as a town hall. Long also paid for the bell that now hangs in the tower. The building again fell into decline, and its care was taken over by a local nonprofit, with a major rehabilitation taking place in the late 1970s.

The building, a well-kept example of Maine's coastal summer churches of the turn of the 20th century, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1992. Description and history Christ Church is located in southern Islesboro, an island community in Penobscot Bay in central Maine, U.S.A. It is set overlooking Pendleton Point Road, the major north-south route on the narrow island, which runs to the east of the building. It is a roughly cruciform structure, its long axis oriented north-south, and is finished in wooden shingles and stucco, with a rubblestone foundation. It is reached from Christ Church Road by a walkway lined by stone walls that passes over an arched stone bridge. The south-facing main facade has a gabled entrance porch supported by square posts with decorative brackets, with a half-timbered gable. The porch eaves have exposed rafter ends, and the porch is flanked by paired diamond-pane windows. Above the porch in the main gable is a grouping of four similar windows. The eastern facade, on the downhill side of the sloped site, has an exposed basement with stone buttresses and arched louvered openings. The Dark Harbor area of Islesboro was developed in the late 19th century as a summer resort area, which, like many of Maine's other coastal summer resort enclaves, soon had a call for Episcopal religious services. The first such services were held at the Islesboro Inn ballroom in 1891, and a small church was soon built on this site. Its capacity was rapidly exceeded, and the present building, designed by Boston architect Francis R. Allen, was built as a major expansion of that structure in 1901-02.

From 2005 to 2007, he was a member in the council for coordinating implementation of the government's National Anti-corruption Strategy. Also, from January 2005 to April 2007, he was a state secretary at the prime minister's chancellery, as head of the government's anti-fraud department. From 2005 to 2006, he was president of the inter-ministerial commission meant to finalise a uniform system for paying civil servants' salaries. As Justice Minister In April 2007, Chiuariu was named Justice Minister following TƒÉriceanu's dismissal of Monica Macovei; the prime minister had been feuding for some time with her and with President Traian BƒÉsescu, a strong Macovei supporter.

The decision reputedly came in order to cover up ties forged illegally in 2005 between Po≈üta Rom√¢nƒÉ and a private real estate group. One civil servant had resigned rather than approve the transfer, which was then done by a Chiuariu aide; anonymous Justice Ministry employees charged that TƒÉriceanu had asked the same of Macovei but been turned down multiple times. In May, he asked the Supreme Council of Magistracy (CSM) to dismiss Doru ≈¢ulu≈ü, a DNA prosecutor and head of the section investigating his own case; this stirred loud protests within the judicial system, including inside Chiuariu's ministry, and was rejected in October. Also in May, he became embroiled in a conflict with DNA chief attorney Daniel Morar, who accused him of telephoning to request being informed about DNA activities before the press, and not to complete files on certain politicians at the time, when a presidential impeachment campaign was ongoing. Chiuariu denied the accusations, but the CSM later found he had applied \\"a certain amount of pressure\\" on DNA. Dorin Petri≈üor, \\"Chiuariu ≈üi ai lui ≈üterg urmele cu hotƒÉr√¢re.

The church congregation was founded in 1796, and its present building was built in 1818. The well-preserved Federal style church was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1976, as one of a few churches in the state based closely on the designs of Asher Benjamin. The congregation is affiliated with the United Church of Christ; its current pastors are Dr. Kate Winters and Rev. Joel Kruger. Architecture and history 2012 image The church is set just south of Belfast's central business district, on a large parcel of land bounded on the northeast by Church Street, the southwest by Court Street, and the southeast by Spring Street. It is set facing Church Street, but well back on the lot, with a grassy lawn dotted with trees in front. The building is a two-story gable-roofed wood frame structure, built largely to a plan published by Asher Benjamin in The Country Builder's Assistant in 1798. Its front facade has a central projecting section with a gabled top, in which three entrance doors are set. The outer two are identical, with flanking pilasters and entablature above, while the central one is a taller double-leaf door with a similar surround. A tower rises astride the main facade and gable, beginning with a square section housing large clock faces. Above this is an open octagonal belfry housing a Revere bell, with Doric columns supporting the next octagonal stage, which supports the cupola and finial. The lower two stages have low balustrades framing their tops, with urn-topped posts at the corners. Belfast's Congregationalist church was organized in 1796, the town having first been settled in the 1770s by Scotch-Irish Presbyterians. At first sharing the meetinghouse with the Presbyterians, they built the present edifice in 1818. The design and construction were overseen by the master builder Samuel French, but are clearly based on the published work of Asher Benjamin. In 1868 it was remodeled, its original box pews removed, and gas lighting installed. The adjacent parish house was dedicated in 1926.

Built in 1843 and enlarged in the 1890s, the church is a fine example of Greek Revival architecture, and is particularly noted for its well-preserved mid-19th century stenciled artwork, whose quality and level of preservation are among the best in the state. The property was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1988. It is now owned by a local nonprofit organization. Description and history The town of Islesboro occupies an eponymous island in Penobscot Bay, on the central Maine coast. The island is roughly shaped as two lobes joined by a narrow isthmus. The former Free Will Baptist Church property stands near the center of the northern lobe, on the north side of Church Turn Road. The church is surrounded on three sides by the cemetery, which is about in size. It is a single-story wood frame structure, with a front-facing gable roof, primarily weatherboard siding, and a granite foundation. Its front facade, facing south, is symmetrical, with a pair of entrances flanking a single sash window. Each entrance is flanked by pilasters and topped by an entablature with cornice. A square tower rises from the ridge just behind the front, with a low first stage, a taller flushboarded belfry stage with round-arch louvered openings, and a simple octagonal spire. To the rear, a two-story cross-gabled vestry section was added in 1894. The church interior has three groups of original wooden pews, with two aisles providing access. The walls are finished in plaster, which has been painted and stenciled. The walls at the back of the sanctuary are particularly noteworthy, with three round-arch panels of artwork flanked by rectangular ones. The outer of these panels are decorated with stenciled rustic motifs, while those in the center have a more Classical inspiration. The rustic themes are continued in bands above the pews and around the walls. While other examples of mid-to-late 19th-century artwork survive in Maine, none employ this type of stencilwork. The Free Will Baptist congregation of Islesboro was organized in 1821, and met for twenty years in private residences, schoolhouses, and other locations. By 1840 the congregation had grown sufficiently to warrant construction of a dedicated space, and the present build was constructed about 1843, probably by a local builder. The artwork, traditionally ascribed to an itinerant French painter in the 1840s, is stylistically more typical of the 1870s. Regular services were held in the church until 1921, after which they took place more sporadically. In 1983 the Society for the Preservation of the Free Will Baptist Church of Islesboro was established, and it now maintains the church and cemetery.

Built c. 1827, the property, which includes two period barns, is a well-preserved example of vernacular late Federal period architecture. The property is also notable as the childhood home of Rev. Ebenezer Knowlton, Jr., a Free Will Baptist minister and a trustee of Bates College in Lewiston, Maine, and Colby College, in Waterville, Maine. The house was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2002. Description and history The Knowlton House is located in southern Montville, a rural inland community in western Waldo County, Maine. It is set on the northwest side of Choate Road, at a four-way junction where Choate Road becomes Sumner Martin Road, and the crossing road is an old (and now unmaintained) county road. The house is a 1-1/2 story wood frame Cape style structure, five bays wide, with a side gable roof, central chimney, clapboard siding, and stone foundation. The front facade, facing southeast, is symmetrical, with a center entrance that is simply framed, and is topped by a four-light transom window. An ell extends to the right of the main block, with a barn attached to the northeast corner of the ell. A second barn stands across Choate Road. The interior has a fairly typical center-chimney plan, with a narrow entry vestibule leading to a parlor on the left and the original kitchen on the right. The parlor fireplace surround is of particularly fine Federal period woodwork. At the back of the house are three small rooms, and a stair leading to a partially-finished attic level. Rev. Ebenezer Knowlton, Sr., was a native of Pittsfield, New Hampshire, who settled in Montville, the home of his wife's family, in 1827. This house is generally given a construction date of 1827-28, but there is some architectural evidence that it was built in stages, which may have begun earlier, as there are records that Knowlton, an itinerant minister, passed through the area as early as 1812. Knowlton's son, also named Ebenezer, was thirteen in 1827, and followed his father into the ministry. He also served one term in the Maine State Legislature, but is most notable as a trustee of Bates College, and Colby College. The younger Ebenezer sold the house to his brother John about 1855; the house remained in the family until 1895.

Built in 1831, it is a prominent little-altered example of Gothic Revival architecture, designed and built by Calvin Ryder, a well- known regional architect and builder. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973. Description and history The Winterport Congregational Church is located in Winterport's village center, on the west side of Main Street just south of its junction with Elm Street. It is set well back from the street (its parking area is located off Elm Street), with a tree-lined series of stepped terraces giving it a somewhat monumental setting. The building is a modest rectangular single-story wood frame structure, with a gabled roof and granite foundation. The front facade is finished in flushboarding, while the other sides are finished in wooden clapboards. The building corners have pilasters with lancet-arched panels. The front facade has a central Gothic lancet-arched window, flanked by entrances with similar lancet-arch features. A tower rises above the roof gable, with a square base topped by a second section that houses a clock and belfry. Above this rises an octagonal steeple, with pinnaces at the corners of its base. In 1820, five different religious congregations united to organize construction of a church building in Winterport. This building was completed in 1831 as the culmination of this effort. It was designed and built by Calvin Ryder, a prominent local builder and designer. Due to squabbling between the denominations, the building was soon given over to the Congregationalists. The clock was added in 1860, and the interior underwent remodeling at that time. The church has seen only minor changes and repairs since then. Since 1976 it has been owned and maintained by a local non-profit organization.

Built in 1820, the main church building is one of the least-altered Federal period churches in the state of Maine, with features reminiscent of earlier colonial- era meeting houses. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. The church congregation is affiliated with the United Church of Christ; its current pastor is Rev. Elizabeth Barnum. Description and history The Lincolnville United Christian Church is located in the rural village center of Lincolnville, on the west side of Searsmont Road (Maine State Route 173), a short way north of its junction with Heal Road. The church is set back from the road, on a property that includes the main church building, a parish hall, and a community building. The main church is a rectangular 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a front-facing gable roof, clapboard siding, and a foundation that is partly granite slab, and partly bedrock. The front (east-facing) facade is symmetrical, with a center entrance flanked by pilasters and topped by a Federal style fan and an entablature. Windows are 12-over-12 sash throughout, except the window above the entrance, which is 16-over-12. The interior retains all or most of its original box pews, and has the unusual configuration of a raised pulpit in the front of the building, just behind the vestibule. This configuration made it possible for the entire congregation to see latecomers, and is extremely rare in Maine. The lack of a steeple and the building's basic form are similar to those of earlier colonial meeting houses, which more typically had the pulpit located on a long wall. The meeting house was built in 1821 as a financial venture by Joshua Lamb, who sought to recoup his costs by the sale of pews. This business endeavour was unsuccessful, and he ended up deeding the property to the congregation. The building has undergone only very modest alterations, including the installation in the early 20th century of a tin roof, and the installation of asphalt shingling on the roof. The parish hall, attached to the rear of the building, provides handicapped access.

This was followed by a brief move to 4KQ in Brisbane in 1960, then back to Sydney to host 2GB breakfast in 1961. In 1964, Graham headed for Europe, where he worked at several radio stations, including Deutsche Welle \\"The Voice Of Germany\\". He eventually moved to the United Kingdom during the mid 1960s, where he, along with several other Australian DJs, became prominent in the flourishing pirate radio scene. Graham joined Radio Caroline in 1965, going on to become Programme Controller and later, News Director. He was one of the staff rescued from Mi Amigo, when she ran aground at Frinton in January, 1966. He left Radio Caroline and returned to Australia, before the proclamation of the Marine Broadcasting Offences Act 1967, which forced the closure of pirate radio stations.Radio London website - Graham Webb page In the late '60s, Graham presented the Australian end of the long running \\"Family Favourites\\" radio series on BBC/ABC. At the same time, he hosted several TV shows, including Blind Date, which ran between 1967 and 1974, and Jeopardy in the early '70s. In 1974, Graham hosted and produced the pioneering Saturday morning music video series Sounds Unlimited ‚Äì the world‚Äôs first program to feature pop video clips,Debbie Kruger: Australian Music Media a forerunner to MTV. As the producer of Sounds Unlimited, Graham played a pivotal role in the career of video and feature film director Russell Mulcahy. In need of material for the new show, Graham approached Mulcahy, who was a staffer in the ATN-7 newsroom, and asked him to film some footage to accompany popular songs, for which there were no purpose-made clips (e.g. Kris Kristofferson's \\"Why Me\\" and Harry Nilsson's \\"Everybody's Talking\\"). Using this method, Webb and Mulcahy assembled a collection of around 25 clips for the first show. The success of his early efforts encouraged Mulcahy to quit his TV job to become a full-time director. He made clips for popular Australian acts including Stylus, Marcia Hines, Hush and AC/DC,Dino Scatena: \\"Clip go the years\\", Sydney Morning Herald, 26 Feb. 2005 before moving to the UK, where he became one of the most successful music video directors of the 1980s and beyond.

It is set on a level lot adjacent to a cemetery. It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a gabled roof, clapboard siding, and granite foundation. The roof has a deep eave studded with paired decorative brackets, and is topped by a three- stage square tower with a steep pyramidal roof. The main facade is three bays wide, with windows on the second level and a pair of entrances on the first level, flanking a central projecting bay with sash windows on the front and sides. The entrances and bay are sheltered by a flared hip-roof portico with large brackets flanking either side of each entrance. A round-arch window adorns the center of the front-facing gable. The area that is now Medway was settled by 1820 and incorporated in 1875. Benjamin Fiske, owner of a local hotel and prominent in the town's civic affairs, privately funded the construction of this church, which was built by local builder Mansford Cushman. Fiske gave a deed to the community specifying the building's use as a church and school, with the property reverting to his family if these uses were discontinued.

Description and history The Dexter Universalist Church stands in Dexter's town center, at the northeast corner of Hall Street and Church Street (Maine State Routes 7 and 23). It is a two-story wood frame structure, with mostly clapboard siding and a front-facing gable roof. In front of the main block is a projecting hip-roofed and flush-boarded vestibule area, from which a multi-stage square tower rises to a belfry and steeple. The vestibule is three bays wide, with narrow segmented-arch windows on either side of the entrance, which is set within a large segmented-arch opening at the front of a projecting gable-roofed section with a dentillated cornice. The interior walls and ceiling of the main sanctuary are finished in pressed metal. The main body of the church was built about 1828-29, but most of the building's styling comes from a major renovation conducted 1867-70 from a design by Boston architect Thomas Silloway. Although Silloway (probably best known for his design of the Vermont State House) was a prolific church designer, this is one of only three relatively unaltered instances of his work left in the state of Maine.

Built in 1834-35, it is one of the oldest churches in rural Penobscot County, and one of its earliest examples of Carpenter Gothic architecture. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. Description and history The Dixmont Corner Church is located in the rural village center of Dixmont, on the south side of US 202/Maine State Route 9, east of its junction with Maine State Route 7. It is a single-story wood frame structure, with a gabled roof and clapboard siding. The roof is surmounted by an integrated square belfry, which is topped by a low-pitch hip roof with pinnacles at the corners. The front (north-facing) facade is symmetrical, with a pair of entrances flanking a raised sash window. Each of these features is set under a separate paneled lancet-shaped arch, with lancet-shaped louvers above the doors and windows. This styling is repeated on the side windows, and the louvered openings of the belfry are also lancet-arched. A Federal style fanlight is at the center of the front gable. The interior of the building has an entrance vestibule (now partially subdivided to house offices and other facilities, a second-floor gallery, and a large open chamber with free-standing bench pews. The styling of the (original) woodwork on the balcony and altar rail is predominantly Federal. The walls and ceiling have been finished with Colonial Revival pressed tin. The church was built in 1834-35 by Rowland Tyler, a local master builder whose only other documented work is the 1812 city hall of Bangor. It is one of Penobscot County's oldest Gothic churches, following only the brick First Congregational Church in Bangor (1831) and the Orrington Methodist Church (1832). The high quality of its workmanship and its well- proportioned exterior are relative rarities in the rural interior of Maine.

The church building was built in 1833, and extensively restyled in 1853, resulting in the present handsome Italianate structure. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. The congregation, established in 1833, is affiliated with the United Church of Christ; its senior pastor is Rev. Mark Allen Doty. Architecture and history The Hammond Street Church is located in central Bangor, on the south side of Hammond Street (United States Route 2 and Maine State Route 100) between High and North High Streets. The building is set facing northwest, its long axis paralleling High Street. It is a two-story brick building, with a projecting pavilion topped by a wooden tower. A three-bay vestibule projects slightly from the pavilion, with narrow doors flanking a larger central one, and a similar configuration of round-arch windows on the second level. The vestibule is capped by a dentillated cornice and a central pediment with long returns. The tower has three stages, the first with narrow round-arch window set in a panelled recess, the second with clock faces and angled paneled corners, and then a narrower octagonal stage with round-arch windows on four sides below the spire. The congregation was established in 1833, and in the same year contracted the construction of a brick building with Greek Revival features, including a temple portico and two towers. The cost of the structure was prohibitive, and during construction it was decided to lower its height and shorten its body, resulting in a misshapen building with an oversized portico. In 1853, the congregation retained Towle & Foster, a Boston firm known for their church designs, to prepare an Italianate design that corrected the building's deficiencies. The present structure, a result of this work, retains only portions of the previous building.

Description and history The Hampden Congregation Church is located near the Hampden village center, on the east side of Main Street North (United States Route 1A and Maine State Route 9). It is a rectangular wood frame structure, with a front-facing gable roof and clapboard siding. The building corners are pilastered, supporting entablatures that run along the sides. The front (west-facing) facade is symmetrically arranged, with a projecting enclosed entry vestibule beneath a round-arch window with flanking pilasters. The vestibule has four Doric columns supporting an entablature and shallow-pitch hip roof, with a double-door entrance at the center. A three-stage square tower rises above the ridge line. The first two stages are quite short, the upper one topped by a broad eave. The belfry rises above, with broad corner boards and round-arch openings with balustrades. The eave above is dentillated, and has paired brackets above the corner boards. A weathervane rises above the low-pitch pyramidal roof. The church congregation was established in 1817, and initially met in the Hampden Academy building under the auspices of the Maine Charity School. Land for a building was donated in 1834, and the present building was constructed in 1835; its designer is unknown. As originally built, the building exhibited a high quality blend of Federal and Greek Revival elements, and is distinguished from its contemporaries by its vestibule; the Italianate tower was probably added in the 1860s. It is possible the tower was designed by Bangor architect Benjamin Deane, who is known to have designed the nearly identical tower atop the Washington County Courthouse in Machias.

He wrote the words to \\"Our Savior's Love\\" which is #113 in the current LDS hymnbook. He was also an English professor at Brigham Young University (BYU) and wrote many poems. Early life Hart was born in Bloomington, Idaho. He received a bachelor's degree from the University of Utah, where he initially studied economics, but decided to change his major even though his close advisor Lowell L. Bennion urged him to let writing be just a free time activity. Hart was also on the track team at the University of Utah. Education Hart then went on to receive a master's degree from the University of Michigan, receiving that degree in 1941. He was then a Rhodes scholar at the University of Oxford, starting in 1945. Originally Hart would have gone to Oxford in 1939 but the outbreak of World War II postponed those plans. Hart was a United States Naval intelligence officer during World War II. Career Hart began his career as a professor at the University of Washington and then joined the BYU faculty in 1952. Besides his long career at BYU, Hart also taught for a time at the University of California, Berkeley. Although he retired in 1982, Hart continued to teach one honors class a year at BYU until 1995. Hart's earliest poem \\"A Lesson In Praise\\" dates to 1954. He published a collection of poems on the occasion of the 150th anniversary of the founding of the LDS Church. Hart edited Minor Lives: A Collection of Biographies that was published in 1971 by Harvard University Press. He also wrote a hymn entitled \\"The Fullness of Times\\" on that occasion. He also edited the journals and published them along with a biography of James H. Hart and published works in BYU Studies and the Mormon Letters Annual of the Association for Mormon Letters. Among Hart's callings in the LDS Church he served from 1980-1988 as a bishop of a student ward at BYU. Personal life In December 1944 Hart married Eleanor May Coleman in Washington, D.C., they were sealed in the Salt Lake Temple the following August. Eleanor and their young son Richard went with Hart to Oxford, and his next son, Paul, was born while he was studying there. Edward and Eleanor also had two daughters, Barbara and Patricia. Eleanor died in 1990. In 1993 he married Leah Bryson n√©e Yates. She died in 2001. In 2002 Hart married Frances Cannon Lee. Hart died on March 9, 2008 in Provo, Utah.

Built in 1857, it is a fine example of a transitional Greek Revival-Italianate church in a rural context. It originally housed both Baptist and Congregationalist congregations, but later was used only by the latter, and is now infrequently used. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1995. Description and history The North Newport Christian Church is set at the northwest corner of Pratt Road and Mullen Street (Maine SR 222) in northern Newport, about halfway between Corinna and Stetson. It is a single-story wood frame structure, with a front-facing gable roof, clapboard siding, and a stone foundation. The gable ends have returns, and the gables and eaves have extended overhangs with decorative brackets. The building corners are pilastered. The main facade, facing south, is symmetrically arranged, with a pair of entrances, each framed by pilasters and a bracketed cornice on either side of a single window. The gable end is decorated with a large triangular false louver. The interior has small vestibule areas, leading into the main chamber, which has original pews with two aisles, and a raised platform at the far end. The church was built in 1857 by Abiah Steward, and represents a well- preserved modestly-styled example of transitional architecture in a rural setting. North Newport's Baptist congregation was established in 1817, and its Christian Church congregation about 1840, both originally meeting in local schoolhouses. In about 1850 the two congregations began discussing building a shared facility, which resulted in the construction of this building (supposedly about midway between their previous meeting places). By 1907 the building was being exclusively by the Christian Church congregation, which met regularly until about 1975. The building is now used only occasionally for services.

Davie and Bateman describe it as: \\"Pyroshock is the response of a structure to high frequency (thousands of hertz), high-magnitude stress waves that propagate throughout the structure as a result of an explosive event such as an explosive charge to separate two stages of a multistage rocket.\\"Davie, N.T. and V.I. Bateman \\"Pyroshock Testing\\", in Harris' Shock and Vibration Handbook, Chapter 26, Part II It is of particular relevance to the defense and aerospace industries in that they utilize many vehicles and/or components that use explosive devices to accomplish mission tasks. Examples include rocket stage separation, missile payload deployment, pilot ejection, automobile airbag inflators, etc. Of significance is the survival and integrity of the equipment after the explosive device has activated so that the vehicle can accomplish its task. There are examples of flight vehicles Boeing-The Aerospace Corp which have crashed after a routine explosive device deployment, the cause of the crash being determined as be a result of a computer failure due to the explosive device. The resultant energies are often high g-force and high frequency which can cause problems for electronic components which have small items with resonant frequencies near those induced by the pyroshock. Pyroshock Testing & Measurement The structural environment is very high magnitude for a relatively short duration and presents many difficulties to capture faithfully. From full scale, high fidelity pre-runs using actual flight hardware, to actual in-flight data, to simulating the event in the test laboratory, there are many possible pitfalls: instrumentation, signal conditioning, amplification, filtration, data acquisition, data sampling, and analysis. In order to verify defense and aerospace vehicle integrity, pyroshock testing is performed in a controlled laboratory environment. Pyroshock testing can be performed using explosive charges or by high energy short duration mechanical impacts. The acceleration time history of a pyroshock approximates decaying sinusoids. Shock response spectrum (SRS) analysis is used to measure the acceleration as a function of frequency and the total energy of the applied shock pulse. The SRS is a curve that represents the response of many damped single degree-of-freedom oscillators to a shock pulse. The damped oscillators are tuned to specific octave or frequency bands. \\"Pyroshock testing techniques first evolved in support of the aerospace community.\\" There are two options for measuring pyroshock. Extreme high frequencies found in pyroshock typically excite the resonant frequency of the accelerometer. As a result, the accelerometer can easily be over ranged or driven nonlinear due to this resonance excitation. In some situations, the frequency environments associated with severe mechanical shock may be so expansive, the acceleration levels so high, or the other directional inputs so severe that successful measurements simply cannot be obtained. There is no single accelerometer design that is optimum for every measurement challenge. A brief summary of each technology is shown below: # First, integrated circuit piezoelectric (ICP) accelerometers have a very high signal output, better resolution and the easy of two-wire electrical connections compared to piezoresistive technology. Mechanical isolation of ferroelectric ceramic accelerometers, coupled with an internal 2-pole filter available in an ICP circuit, is allowing piezoelectric accelerometers to operate successfully at higher G-levels than were previously achievable. Good design practices are allowing their elastomeric isolation materials to perform in a dynamically linear fashion within the accelerometers. # Piezoresistive MEMS shock accelerometers have low power consumption, a wider operating temperature range, ability to measure to DC, better linearity and transverse sensitivity compared to piezoelectric technology. To control resonance, they incorporate squeeze film damping and over range stops sealed into a hermetic package.

Description and history St. Anne's Church is located on the east side of Down Street, near the southern end of Indian Island, location of the Penobscot Indian Island Reservation. It is a single- story wood frame structure, with a front-facing gable roof and clapboard siding. The building has had a series of significant alterations, having been originally built with a small tower and belfry on its roof, with an entry in the western facade and a fanlight in the gable. Around the turn of the 20th century, this tower was replaced by the more elaborate square tower seen today projecting in front of the body of the church. The entrance is now at the base of the tower, with the fanlight just above. The tower's fourth stage has Palladian windows on each side, and its pyramidal roof is framed by pinnacles at the corners. The Catholic mission to the Penobscot Indians was established in 1688 by Louis-Pierre Thury, a French missionary baptized in Quebec in 1667, with the construction of a church building and establishment of a cemetery. The mission was transferred to the Jesuits in 1702, and headed by Antoine Gaulen until 1732. Until 1792 there was no permanent missionary presence, although traveling missionaries and priests would stop to minister to the Penobscots. Beginning in 1792, missionaries were stationed here in the summer, and it was during the tenure of Rev. John Cheverus (1792‚Äì98) that the second church was built on this site. The present church was built during the tenure of Rev. Virgil Barber between 1828 and 1830, and was funded by the state. The parish received a full-time priest in 1926.

Built in 1852, it is Gothic Revival building noted for its elegance and high quality despite its rural setting. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1978. Description and history The Springfield Congregational Church is set in Springfield's rural village center, on the north side of Route 6, a short way west of its junction with Maine State Route 169. It is a single-story wood frame structure, with a front-facing gable roof, board-and-batten siding, and a granite foundation. A square three-stage tower, with buttress-like corners, rises at the southeast corner. The center of the main facade has a tripartite Gothic window rising into the main gable, and the main entrance is at the base of the tower, set in a Gothic arch. The second stage of the tower has Gothic windows, and the third has a trefoil design on each face. An open belfry stands above, with posts at the corners that are topped by a pinnacles joined by an ornate railing. The sides of the church have five Gothic arched windows. The interior of the church is noted for open trusswork supporting the roof, although this was at some time enclosed by a suspended ceiling. The town of Springfield, founded in 1830, is set in a rural part of eastern Penobscot County that has never developed beyond a basically agrarian economy. The congregation was established in 1846 and built this church in 1852 for $2500. The congregation has always been small, and was briefly disbanded during the Great Depression, and has also shared a minister with a neighboring congregation in Lincoln. Electricity was introduced into the building in 1946. The building's architect is unknown.

The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1981. It is owned by the town. Description and history The Stetson Union Church is located at the northeast corner of Village Road (Maine State Route 222) and Wolfboro Road, east of the village center. The single story rectangular wood frame structure is set facing roughly west, toward the junction. The square tower that rises from the western end of the gable roof has two stages, ending in a conical fluted spire. The upper stage has arched windows flanked by Doric pilasters. The main facade has a recessed entrance pavilion, with Doric columns at the front and Ionic pilasters at the rear. The sides of the building have four stained-glass windows, and a chimney rises at the rear. The town of Stetson began as a proprietorship established in 1801 by Amasa Stetson on land he purchased from Leicester Academy of Leicester, Massachusetts. In 1831 he bequeathed the funds to build a church, which resulted in the 1843 construction of this building, to a design by the noted Bangor architect Benjamin S. Deane.

Structured in accordance with the constitution of each state, state governments in Mexico are modeled on the federal system, with three branches of government ‚Äî executive, legislative, and judicial, and are formed based on the congressional system. Mexico's central federal government, on the other hand, represents the United Mexican States before international bodies such as the United Nations. The executive power is exercised by the executive branch, which is headed by the state's governor, advised by a cabinet of Secretaries that are independent of the legislature. Legislative power is vested upon the congress of the state. Judicial power is exercised by the various local tribunals (Ministerio de Justicia) and the state's Supreme Court of Justice.  State governments  Mexico is a federation of 31 free & sovereign states. All constituent states of the federation must have a republican form of government based on a congressional system.The form of government of the constituent states is briefly outlined in the 116th article of the Political Constitution of the United Mexican States, and further expanded in the constitutions of each state. The executive power is vested upon a governor elected by first-past-the-post plurality without the possibility of re-election. The legislative power is vested upon a unicameral Congress whose composition is determined by the constitutions of each state, but must include first-past-the-post and proportional representation deputies & they must not be re-elected for the next immediate term. The judiciary is vested upon the tribunals that each state establishes in its constitution. The re-election of the ministers of justice is a prerogative established by each constituent state. All states are both independent & autonomous in their internal administration. The federal government cannot intervene in any particular state's affairs unless there is a full cessation of government powers and through previous study, recommendation and/or approval of the Congress of the Union. The states cannot make an alliance with any foreign power or with any other state. They cannot unilaterally declare war against a foreign nation unless their territory is invaded & cannot wait for the Congress of the Union to issue a declaration of war.  Municipal governments  Veracruz All states are divided into municipalities, the smallest autonomous political entity in Mexico.The form of government of the municipalities is briefly outlined in the 115th article of the Political Constitution of the United Mexican States, and further expanded in the constitutions of each state they are part of. Municipalities are governed through a municipal council (ayuntamiento) headed by a mayor or municipal president (presidente municipal) whose work is supported by a predetermined number of regents (regidores) and trustees (s√≠ndicos), according to the constitutions of the states they are part of. Since 1917 there are no intermediate entities or authorities between municipalities and the state governments. Members of the municipal councils cannot be reelected for the next immediate term. Autonomous municipalities are constitutionally known as \\"free municipalities\\" (municipios libres). Municipalities are responsible for public services (such as water and sewage), street lighting, public safety, traffic, supervision of slaughterhouses and the cleaning and maintenance of public parks, gardens and cemeteries, as well as in zoning and urban planning. They may also assist the state and federal governments in education, emergency fire and medical services, environmental protection and maintenance of monuments and historical landmarks. As of 1983, they can collect property taxes and user fees although more funds are obtained from the state and federal governments than from their own collection efforts.  Elections  The elections in each state are done at different times, depending on the state, and aren't necessarily held at the same time with the federal elections. Currently, the Revolutionary Institutional Party (PRI) is the 1st political force in the Congress of the Union, in terms of number of seats, and the first political force in terms of the number of states governed by it. As of 2016: * Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) governs 17 states: Aguascalientes, Campeche, Coahuila, Colima, Guerrero, Hidalgo, Jalisco, Nayarit, Oaxaca, Quintana Roo, San Luis Potos√≠, Sinaloa, Sonora, State of Mexico, Veracruz, Yucat√°n and Zacatecas. * National Action Party (PAN) governs 9 states: Baja California, Baja California Sur, Chihuahua, Durango, Guanajuato, Puebla, Quer√©taro, Tamaulipas and Tlaxcala. * Revolutionary Democratic Party (PRD) governs 3 states and Mexico City: Mexico City, Michoacan, Morelos and Tabasco. * An independent candidate governs 1 state: Nuevo Le√≥n * Ecologist Green Party of Mexico (PVEM) governs 1 state: Chiapas. Specific jurisdictions M√©xico The State of Mexico is governed according to the Constitution of the State of Mexico and the law of the State of Mexico. The previous constitutions of 1827, 1861, and 1870 were replaced in 1917. The government is composed of legislative, executive, and judicial branches. The legislative branch is composed of the Mexico State Legislature; the executive branch is composed of the Governor, Cabinet, and Public Prosecutor; and the judicial branch is composed of the Judicial Council, High Court of Justice, and inferior courts. Yucat√°n The Constitution of Yucat√°n provides that the government of Yucat√°n, like the government of every other state in Mexico, consists of three powers: the executive, the legislative and the judiciary. Executive power rests in the governor of Yucat√°n, who is directly elected by the citizens, using a secret ballot, to a six-year term with no possibility of reelection. Legislative power rests in the Congress of Yucat√°n which is a unicameral legislature composed of 25 deputies. Judicial power is invested in the Superior Court of Justice of Yucat√°n.  The Federal District  Mexico City does not belong to any state in particular, but to the federation, being the capital of the country and seat of the powers of the Union. As such, it is constituted as a Federal District, ultimately administered by the Powers of the Union.The form of government of the Federal District is outlined in the 112th article of the Political Constitution of the United Mexican States . Nonetheless, since the late 1990s some level of autonomy and local jurisdictional power have been gradually vested on it. The executive power is vested upon a head of government now elected by first-past-the-post plurality. The legislative power is vested upon a unicameral Legislative Assembly. The judicial power is exercised by the Supreme Tribunal of Justice and the Judiciary Council. The Federal District is divided into delegaciones or boroughs. Though not fully equivalent to a municipality in that they do not have regulatory powers, they have gained limited autonomy in recent years, and the representatives to the head of government are now elected by the citizens as well.

It is home to the Milo Historical Society Museum. Built in 1853, this wood frame structure was Milo's first church, shared initially by Baptist and Free Will Baptist congregations before becoming the exclusive property of the latter. It has served as the local history museum since 1996. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2000. Description and history The church is a single-story wood frame structure, with clapboarded exterior and a front-gable roof. A square tower stands attached to the main block's southwest corner, topped by a belfry and a pyramidal roof. The main (southwest-facing) facade has a large central grouping of four sash windows, two over two, with a shallow hood above, and a round-arch louvered opening in the gable end. The main entrance is between this window group and the tower, sheltered by a portico with jigsawn brackets. The left facade has two windows in the wall of the nave and one in the tower, and there are three similar windows in the right facade. The interior is virtually unaltered since its last major renovation c. 1900. The Free Will Baptist congregation in Milo was established in 1827, and was the community's first organized congregation. It was joined in 1840 by a Baptist congregation. The two groups negotiated for many years concerning the construction of a sanctuary, but nothing occurred beyond the donation of land until William Owen, a local farmer and a member of the Baptist congregation, took it upon himself in 1853 to fund and oversee the construction of the present building's main block, albeit with vernacular Greek Revival styling. Owen was partially compensated for his efforts by the sale of pews. The building was used by both congregations until 1888, when the Baptists moved to a separate building. The Free Will Baptists in about 1900 made significant alterations to the building, adding the tower and exterior Queen Anne elements, and redecorating the interior. Their congregation formally merged with the Baptists in 1913, occupying the Baptist edifice on Pleasant Street. This building was afterward used by Christian Scientist and Episcopal congregations before its acquisition in 1996 by the Milo Historical Society.

It set up compulsory arbitration of disputes and created a method to determine the aggressor in international conflicts. All legal disputes between nations would be submitted to the World Court. It called for a disarmament conference in 1925. Any government that refused to comply in a dispute would be named an aggressor. Any victim of aggression was to receive immediate assistance from League members. British Conservatives condemned the proposal for fear that it would lead to conflict with the United States, which also opposed the proposal, and so it was shelved. The Geneva Protocol solved thus one problem cleverly (i.e. by providing that any State that resorted to war without first submitting to the international dispute settlement machinery was an aggressor). But in solving this problem, the Protocol created a new one: the enforcement mechanism was drawn on the League of Nations' mechanism (i.e. Articles 10 & 16 Versailles Treaty) thus leaving war a perfectly legal response for those States that had not joined the League. Moreover, by providing for financial and commercial sanctions, Parties to Protocol might be required to infringe upon their neutral commitments since they were legally obliged to impose sanctions against an aggressor. The Protocol envisaged wide-ranging regulations to bring about general disarmament, effective international security and the compulsory arbitration of disputes. In the Geneva Protocol the member states would declare themselves ‚Äúready to consent to important limitations of their sovereignty in favor of the League of Nations‚Äù (Wehberg). After preliminary approval on 2 October 1924 by all the 47 member states of the League of Nations at the 5th General Assembly, however, it was not ratified by Great Britain the following year under the newly elected government of Stanley Baldwin, with Austen Chamberlain as Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (from 1924 to 1929). The Protocol subsequently failed to materialize.

The church was established by Swedish immigrants to Maine and built by them in 1890. It is architecturally distinctive as an uncommon example of Swedish-influenced religious architecture in Maine, and was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1984. The building is now a study center of the Areopagus II America Institute (AIIA), a Christian religious apologetics organization. Description and history The church building is located at the western corner of Hebron and Wilkins Streets, two quiet side streets in the center of Monson, Maine. The building faces northeast, and is a single-story wood frame structure with clapboard siding, gable roof, and Gothic styling. A vestibule with a lower gable roof projects from the main building, and is topped by a two-stage square tower. The entrance is flanked by lancet-arched windows, with a small bullseye design in the gable. The first stage of the tower is paneled, and the second, housing the belfry, has paired pointed-arch louvered openings on each side. The tower is capped by an octagonal steeple. The building's side windows are lancet- arched, and are capped by small gables. The Monson area received an influx of immigrants in the mid-1870s, drawn to work in the nearby slate quarries. Most of these were Swedish, and they built this church in 1890 to serve their population, which was a diverse mix of Christian denominations. After the Methodists split in 1892, the church was exclusively used by Swedish Lutheran congregants.

The church, a modest transitional Federal style-Greek Revival building, was built in 1839 for a congregation founded in 1788, and the cemetery is of similar antiquity. The property was the first in the town to be the subject of active preservation efforts. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1997. Description and history The First Baptist Church is set on a rural parcel in central eastern Bowdoin, a few hundred feet west of United States Route 201. It and the adjacent cemetery are accessed via an unlabeled dirt road that runs west across an open field and into the woods surrounding the church and cemetery. The church is a modest single-story wood frame structure, with a gabled roof, clapboard siding, and a granite foundation. The main facade, facing east, has an elaborate entrance, the door framed by panels and a transom window, with pilasters and a Federal style fan as an outer surround. The sides each have two windows. The interior has a vestibule that opens into the sanctuary, which has three sections of bench pews and a raised pulpit. The cemetery which stands behind the church is a family cemetery that belonged to the Eaton and Coombs families. It is surrounded by a low stone wall, added in 1900 when the church underwent restoration. The First Baptist Church of Bowdoin was organized in 1788, and its first church was built in 1799. That building was destroyed by an arsonist in 1834, and the present building was constructed soon afterward. The congregation, apparently always small, dwindled during the 19th century, and the property eventually reverted to members of the Coombs family, on whose land it had been built. John and Viola Coombs in 1900 undertook the restoration of the church and their ancestral cemetery. Viola Coombs gave Bowdoin College an endowment for its maintenance. The college has since transferred the endowment and responsibility for the property's care to the local historical society.

The building is architecturally transitional, exhibiting both Federal and Gothic Revival elements. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1976. Description and history The church is a single story wood frame structure, finished in clapboards and resting on a granite foundation. Its main facade is divided into three bays, with the outer bays housing matching entrances, each flanked by pilasters and topped by an architrave with projecting cornice moulding. The central bay has a Gothic-style lancet window, as do all three bays at the balcony level. The sides of the church have four tall Gothic windows.

The next state is an open belfry, with eight columns rising to support a bell-shaped steeple, with spire and weathervane. Photograph c. 1890 The interior has relatively modest Federal styling, most of which it has retained. The original pulpit and box pews remain, although the doors of the latter have been removed. The balcony level was removed during remodelling in 1902. Major settlement of the town of Bingham began in the early 19th century, with early church congregations meeting in the local schoolhouse. In 1835 the local denominations agreed to share the cost of constructing this building, which was completed in 1836.

Built in 1842-44, this Greek Revival brick building is one of the few works attributable to a local master builder, Joseph Bigelow. It was used as a church until 1919, after which it was used as a community center, and then a VFW hall until 2009. It is (as of 2013) vacant, with plans to establish a performance and meeting venue; it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1991. Description and history The former First Baptist Church is set on the west side of Main Street in Skowhegan, just south of its junction with Maine State Route 104, and next to the 1807 Bloomfield Academy building. It is a roughly rectangular brick structure, with a front-facing gable roof and a granite foundation. The main block is augmented by a projecting vestibule in the front, and a vestry addition in the rear. The vestibule is three bays wide, with a pair of double- doors set in lancet-arched openings flanking a central sash window, also set in a lancet-arch opening. The roofline of the vestibule has a shallow pitch, with a central front-facing gable. Behind the vestibule the main facade was originally five bays wide, separated by brick pilasters, of which only the outermost are now fully visible. The main roof gable is fully pedimented, and is finished in flushboarding with a recessed central section that has a quatrefoil window. The congregation for which the church was built was established in 1796, and its first meetinghouse, built in 1812, was destroyed by fire in 1841. The present building was built to replace it; it was designed by Joseph Bigelow and completed in 1844. It is one of a small number of buildings with documentary connection to Bigelow, a locally renowned master builder. Growth of the congregation prompted enlargement of the building in the 1880s, at which time the vestry and vestibule were added. This remodeling campaign probably also included artwork by Portland artist Charles Schumacher, work that was lost due to subsequent alterations. The church was closed in 1919 when the Baptists merged with the local Congregational church. In 1926 the building was adapted for use as a community center, which included construction of a basketball court in its interior. It later housed the headquarters of the local National Guard organization, and served as a meeting space for the local Veterans of Foreign Wars chapter until 2009. After a period of town ownership, it was purchased by a private owner (Todd Smith) with plans to rehabilitate the building as a meeting venue.

Built in 1829 for several different denominations to share, this church is a relatively early and rare example of transitional Federal-Gothic styling in the state, with its tower set partially over the entrance vestibule, another uncommon feature. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2007. Description and history The church is set on the north side of Main Street, a short way west of its junction with US 2. It is a rectangular wood- frame structure with a projecting vestibule area at the front (south-facing facade). Its gable roof is pedimented up to the vestibule, which itself has only partial returns, owing to a large Gothic-arched window at its center. A pair of identical entrances flank this window in the projecting section. The square tower rises partially over the vestibule and partially over the main block, its first stage with a plain clapboarded finish, and the second, belfry stage flushboarded with louvered openings. Corner spires and a balustrade cap the tower. The doorways lead into separate small vestibules, from which doorways lead into the main hall. The pews are a transitional style between older box pews and bench pews, set in groups, with the ends painted in an unusual false wood-grain style. The walls are wainscoted below and finished in pressed tin above, which is continued into the ceiling, which is finished with tin paneling. The meetinghouse was built in 1829 to house the activities of several different congregations. The Methodist had organized in the town in the early 19th century, and the Congregationalists in 1822, but neither had a permanent sanctuary until this one was built. Funding was also raised by the sale of pews to Universalists, who also made use of the building. By 1857 the building was apparently being used exclusively by Congregationalists, whose congregation folded in the early 20th century. The building was thereafter used by the Methodists again, but only on a seasonal basis. The building is now owned and maintained by the Mercer Meetinghouse Association, a local nonprofit.

The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1998. Description and history The Moose River Congregational Church is set at the northeast corner of Heald Stream Road and US 201 near the northern end of Jackman village. It is a basically rectangular single-story wood-frame structure, with a metal gable roof and a projecting tower and vestibule section at the south-facing front. The front is symmetrically arranged with paneled corner pilasters and narrow pointed-arch windows flanking the projecting section. The entry also has corner pilasters, and a gable-roof pediment matching the main roof line in details. A double- leaf door is topped by a line of dentil moulding, above which is a triangular stained glass window. The second stage of the tower above the entrance is simple, with narrow pointed-arch window on three sides and slender corner pilasters.

An open belfry stands above that, each side of the square tower consisting of a pair of pointed-arch openings. The steeple rises above to a weathervane. Although the Jackman area was settled in 1820, it did not have regular religious services for many years, seeing only visits by itinerant ministers. By the late 1880s the population had grown sufficiently to support a call for the construction of a church, and the Moose River congregation formally organized in June 1890. The present church was built in 1890-91 and formally dedicated in 1892. It is architecturally distinctive as a local example of Gothic Revival architecture, and demonstrates an architectural transition toward more fully integrating the tower into the main church structure.

Built in 1898-99 with parts dating to 1857, it is one of the town's finest examples of Queen Anne architecture and is noted for its artwork and stained glass. The building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. Description and history The Pittsfield Universalist Church is set on the east side of Main Street in the center of Pittsfield, just north of its junction with Easy Street (from which it is accessed by vehicle). It is a 2-1/2 story T-shaped wood frame structure with its main sanctuary oriented east-west. The top of the T, attached to the sanctuary at its eastern end, houses a meeting space, parlor, and vestry. It is the congregation's original 1857 sanctuary, moved and rotated, and extensively altered during the construction of the present sanctuary. Three modestly-scaled towers are attached to these structures. At the southeastern junction of the two sections is the largest tower, which was originally more elaborately detailed, but is now topped by a gable roof; it houses the building's main entrance. At the southwestern end of the sanctuary stands a second square tower, and lower third rounded third tower is at the northeast of the sanctuary. The interior of the church is noted for its artwork and stained glass. The ceilings are adorned with frescoes painted by Henry H. Cochrane, a prolific Maine artist who decorated numerous churches in the state. The stained glass windows of the sanctuary were designed by Redding, Baird and Co. of Boston, Massachusetts. The interior is unique in the state for these features and its excellent state of preservation.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980. Description and history The Limington Academy building is set on the west side Cape Road (SR 117), a short way south of its junction with Maine State Route 11, which marks the center of the rural community. It is a two-story wood frame structure, with clapboard siding, granite foundation, and a gabled roof topped by an octagonal cupola. The east-facing front facade is four bays wide, with the outer bays taken up by recessed porches that extend for two bays along the sides. The porches are supported by paneled square posts, details repeated in pilasters at the building corners. The front gable is fully pedimented, with a triangular louvered fan at its center. Limington Academy was founded in 1848 as a subscription school. The primary founders were Dr. Samuel M. Bradbury, Rev. J H. Garmon, Arthur McArthur, Esq., James McArthur, Gideon L. Moody, and Isaac L. Mitchell. William G. Lord headed the school from 1851 to 1894. Originally, there were no grades and students attended until they were prepared for college or work. The school met in one of the village school buildings, and then in Masonic hall, before this building was constructed in 1854. By the end of the 19th century the school had reached its height, drawing students from nearby towns. In 1895 the school became the de facto public high school for the area.

The Mexican federal government has three branches: executive, legislative, and judicial and functions per the Constitution of the United Mexican States, as enacted in 1917, and as amended. The executive power is exercised by the executive branch, which is headed by the president and his Cabinet, which, together, are independent of the legislature. Legislative power is vested upon the Congress of the Union, a bicameral legislature comprising the Senate and the Chamber of Deputies. Judicial power is exercised by the judiciary, consisting of the Supreme Court of Justice of the Nation, the Council of the Federal Judiciary, and the collegiate, unitary, and district courts. The powers of the union The federal government, known as the Supreme Power of the Federation, is constituted by the Powers of the Union: the legislative, the executive, and the judicial. Mexico City, as the capital of Mexico, seats all the powers of the Union. All branches of government are independent; no two separate branches must be vested upon a single person or institution, and the legislative power must not be vested upon a single individual.  Executive branch  National Palace, symbolic seat of the executive branch. The President of the United Mexican States is the head of the executive branch of the country. He also the head of state, the head of government, and the supreme commander of the Armed Forces. The President is elected by direct, popular, and universal suffrage. Once elected, the candidate assumes the position on October 1st of the election year. (Prior to the Electoral Reform of 2014, the office was assumed on December 1st of the election year.) His position lasts for a period of six years, with no possibility of reelection, not even in the case of having served as interim, provisional or substitute. The office of President of the Republic is only waived for serious cause, which must be qualified by the Congress of the Union. In case of death, dismissal, or resignation, the Secretariat of the Interior immediately and provisionally assumes the position (if the absence is the day of the inauguration, it would be the president of the senate, the provisional president). Later, with the reservations contemplated by the constitution, it is up to Congress to appoint a substitute or interim. Grito de Independencia ceremony. Mexico DF. September 15, 2013. The current Constitution of 1917 provides for said position in its third title third chapter and is addressed by fifteen articles. They specify the obligations, powers requirements, and restrictions to the position; specifications ranging from the command of the armed forces; ownership of foreign, economic policies, social development, and public safety; the promulgation and enforcement of laws issued by the legislative branch; propose appointments to positions that require of the Senate or the Supreme Court; and various prerogatives granted in other articles of the same magna letter and federal laws. The President is the head of the Federal Public Administration and is assisted by a cabinet composed of several Secretariats of State, federal agencies, decentralized agencies, and parastatals, which are in charge of various public interest portfolios, in addition to various advisers on call to the Office of the Presidency. The President is protected by the Presidential General Staff, which is the military technical body that assists the president in obtaining general information, planning the personal activities of the position, performing safety precautions, and participating in the execution of the activities coming for these purposes. Since the beginning of his term, the official residence of president Andr√©s Manuel L√≥pez Obrador has been the National Palace, a building facing the Mexico City Z√≥calo. The National Palace is also the formal seat of the Executive Power and had been the official seat of power in Mexico since early colonial times, until it was moved in 1937 to Los Pinos.  Legislative Branch  The backdrop of the Mexican Chamber of Deputies, covered with the Constitution of Mexico, Flag of Mexico and corbata. President Vicente Fox in the Mexican Chamber of Deputies. The legislative powerThe composition, responsibilities and requirements of the legislative power are outlined in articles 50 to 79 of the Political Constipoo of the United Mexican States is vested upon the Congress of the Union, a bicameral congress comprising the Senate (Spanish: C√°mara de Senadores or Senado) and the Chamber of Deputies (). The powers of the Congress include the right to pass laws, impose taxes, declare war, approve the national budget, approve or reject treaties and conventions made with foreign countries, and ratify diplomatic appointments. The Senate addresses all matters that concern foreign policy, approves international agreements, and confirms presidential appointments. The Chamber of Deputies is formed by 500 representatives of the nation. All deputies are elected in free universal elections every three years, in parallel voting: 300 deputies are elected in single-seat constituencies by first-past-the-post plurality (called uninominal deputies), and the remaining 200 are elected by the principle of proportional representation (called plurinominal deputies) with closed-party lists for which the country is divided into five constituencies or plurinominal circumscriptions. Deputies cannot be reelected for the next immediate term. Senate Being a supplementary system (PM) of parallel voting, proportionality is only confined to the plurinominal seats. However, to prevent a party to be overrepresented, several restrictions to the assignation of plurinominal seats are applied: * A party must obtain at least 2% of votes to be assigned a plurinominal seat; * A party's percentage of deputies in the Chamber (uninominal and plurinominal together) cannot be more than 8% greater than the percentage of votes the party obtained in the elections; * No party can have more than 300 seats (uninominal and plurinominal together), even if the party gets more than 52% of the votes. The Senate consists of 128 representatives of the constituent states of the federation. All senators are elected in free universal elections every six years through a parallel voting system as well: 64 senators are elected by first-past-the-post plurality, two per state and two for Mexico City elected jointly; 32 senators are assigned through the principle of \\"first minority\\", that is, they are awarded to the first runner- up party for each constituent state and Mexico City; and 32 are elected by proportional representation with closed-party lists, for which the country forms a single constituency.  Judicial branch  Supreme court of Justice of the nation The judiciaryThe composition, responsibilities and requirements of the judicial power are outlined in articles 94 to 107of the Political Constitution of the United Mexican States consists of The Supreme Court of Justice, composed of eleven judges or ministers appointed by the President with Congress approval, who interpret laws and judge cases of federal competency. Other institutions of the judiciary are the Electoral Tribunal, collegiate, unitary and district tribunals, and the Council of the Federal Judiciary. The ministers of the Supreme Court will serve for 15 years and cannot be appointed to serve more than once.  State and local powers The entities of the Mexican Federation are free and sovereigns, autonomous in its internal regime. They have the power to govern themselves according to their own laws; they have their own constitution that doesn't have to contradict the principles of the federal constitution. The powers of its executive and legislative branches they are understood as those that are the rights of the entities; as the ownership of the command of the public force (state police and national guard attached), direction and regulation of their own economic policies, of social development and public safety; as well as the administration of those resources that arise from their local taxes or own income. Internal organization of the states The states are divided internally into municipalities -- or mayors, in the case of Mexico City. Each municipality enjoys autonomy in its capacity to choose its own town hall which is responsible, in most cases; to provide all the public services required by its population. To this concept, which would arise from the Mexican Revolution, it is known as free municipality. The town hall is headed by a municipal president elected every three years.  Mexico City (formerly Federal District)  Mexico City does not belong to any state in particular, but to the federation, being the capital of the country and seat of the powers of the Union. As such, it is constituted as a special jurisdiction, ultimately administered by the Powers of the Union.The form of government of the Mexico City is outlined in the 112th article of the Political Constitution of the United Mexican States . Nonetheless, since the late 1990s certain autonomy and powers have been gradually devolved. The executive power is vested upon a head of government elected by first-past-the-post plurality. The legislative power is vested upon a unicameral Legislative Assembly. The judicial power is exercised by the Supreme Tribunal of Justice and the Judiciary Council. Mexico City was divided into delegaciones or boroughs. Though not fully equivalent to a municipality in that they do not have regulatory powers, they have gained limited autonomy in recent years, and the representatives to the head of government are now elected by the citizens as well. In 2016, the name was changed to Mexico City and the 16 delegations were transformed into municipalities, each one with its own mayor.

Built about 1682 and later enlarged and restyled, it was at the time of its construction the grandest house in what is now the state of Maine. It is notable as the birthplace and home of Sir William Pepperrell (1696-1759) a leading businessman of the period whose greatest claim to fame was leading the 1745 Siege of Louisbourg during King George's War. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1973. Description and history The Pepperrell House is located on the south side of Pepperrell Road, just east of Bellamy Lane, and faces south toward Pepperrell Cove on the Piscataqua River. It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a gambrel roof and clapboard siding. Both front (water-facing) and rear (street-facing) facades are four bays wide, with an entrance in one of the central bays. The building corners are pilastered, and the entrances have flanking pilasters and are topped by gabled pediments. Above the street- facing entrance is a round-arch window. The house was built about 1682 for William Pepperrell (d. 1733), a fisherman who moved to the area in 1680 and married the daughter of John Bray, a local merchant and shipwright. Pepperrell joined his father-in-law in business, and by 1695 owned most of Kittery Point. By the early 18th century he was one of the wealthiest men in New England. His son, also named William, was active in the family business, and joined the local militia, rising to command the entire militia of the Massachusetts District of Maine. When King George's War broke out in 1744, Pepperrell was chosen to lead a colonial expedition to take the French Fortress Louisbourg on what is now Cape Breton Island. For leading the capture of this strategic fortification, Pepperrell was awarded a baronetcy by King George II. Pepperrell's large landholdings were lost by his grandson, who remained Loyal during the American Revolutionary War and fled to England, resulting in the confiscation of the estate by the state.

T. McIntosh. It was originally published as three novellas in The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction in 1953-54, and was then published by Doubleday & Company, Inc.. During 1956 the novel was reissued by Ace as Ace Double D-113, in a dos-√†-dos binding with Dwight V. Swain's The Transposed Man. The original novellas were \\"One in 300\\" (February 1953), \\"One in a Thousand\\" (January 1954), and \\"One Too Many\\" (September 54). The first novella was included in the anthology Best SF of 1954. Plot Set in the near future when a scientific principle has been discovered allowing exceptionally accurate predictions of solar flares and the occurrence of the Sun increasing its solar output. Applying this principle, worldwide consensus has determined which day, hour, and minute the Sun will brighten so much as to boil away the Earth's seas. Realizing that the heightened insolation will destroy life as we know it, the world's nations debate what to do when the Sun \\"goes off.\\" Since the Earth's rotation continues at 360 degrees in 24 hours, it will take only one day to cause all of the Earth's oceans to boil away. Terrific hurricanes and tidal waves will also occur, causing all buildings to be destroyed. If there are any survivors, they will be in hardened bunkers deep underground, and they will only be able to last as long as their food lasts. The unavoidability of the impending doom has caused some technologically advanced countries to look for sanctuary on another planet, such as Mars. This is all scheduled to happen in a few years, and the exact minute and hour of the Sun's increase in radiance does not give the human race much time to devise a way of navigating space to an orbit as far away as Mars. Nevertheless, massive building programs are initiated, and hundreds of spaceships are raised, many of them unfit for flight. A series of national lotteries are established with grand prize being a ticket to ride a spaceship off the Earth, and possibly make it as far as Mars. Many spaceships, however, were built without landing gear. Although many ships were supposed to have shortwave radios to communicate with each other, many of the shortwave radios were simply empty cases as the tubes and wires had been left out. The protagonist of the story has been elected into a position of authority, and must choose which people to take with him to Mars. He has only a limited number of tickets, and knows there will come a time when people with guns will storm their way on board, rather than stand in line until the tickets are depleted. The book is titled \\"One in Three Hundred\\" because only one in three hundred people in the United States will get a ticket to leave the Earth, and there is still a question whether the spaceships will have enough air, or even be able to travel to Mars in time, and nobody is certain whether the atmosphere of Mars is breathable, or whether Mars will even be habitable when they get there. Critical reception Damon Knight wrote a scathing review of the novel, condemning both its tone and plausibility. Galaxy reviewer Groff Conklin more charitably described the novel as \\"a thrilling and tragic story.\\"\\"Galaxy's 5 Star Shelf\\", Galaxy Science Fiction, January 1955, p.123 Anthony Boucher, who had published the original stories in The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction, reviewed the novel as \\"McIntosh's best work and one of the most human science fiction stories by anyone.\\"\\"Recommended Reading,\\" F&SF;, November 1955, p.86.

The church, built about 1839, is a fine local example of transitional Federal-Gothic Revival architecture, and the adjacent parish house, built in 1914, is a good local example of the Bungalow style. The property, purchased for use of the Maine Hindu Temple in 2012, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2001. Description and history The Proprietors Meeting House and Parish House is located at the southeast corner of Broad Turn Road and Old County Road (Maine State Route 22) in southeastern Buxton. The meeting house is a single-story rectangular structure with a projecting entry pavilion, and a tower straddling the line between the two sections. The main roof and entry section roof are gabled, and the walls are clapboarded. The entry pavilion has two entrances, set near its corners, with flanking pilasters and Gothic-arched louvered fans above. Windows at the sides are sash, with similar Gothic fans. The tower has a square first stage, with an open belfry that has arched openings, and a steeple above. The parish house stands just east of the meetinghouse. It is a single-story wood frame structure, topped by a hip roof and finished in wooden shingles. The roof covers an engaged porch at the front, supported by square posts linked by a slatted balustrade. The interior of the original portion of the building consists of a hall with a stage at the far end, with a kitchen and modern bathroom facilities in additions near the rear. The congregation that built the church was organized in 1838, primarily to provide Sunday School services to the area population. The church was built in 1839 or 1840 (extant records disagree), and was sporadically served by ministers through the 19th century, although the Sunday School was generally well-attended. The congregation was formally organized as the Universalist Church of Scarborough and South Buxton in 1891, and the parish hall was built in 1914. In about 2000, the building was turned over to the Friends of the Proprietors Meeting House, and was taken over by the Anchor Missionary Fellowship in 2002. In 2012 it was purchased by a private citizen for use by the Maine Hindu Temple, but the temple acquired a different church in Westbrook.

Gorges' dreams were not realized, and Agamenticus, along with the rest of Gorges' territory, became part of the Massachusetts Bay Colony in the 1650s. Agamenticus was renamed York, and became the county seat of York County, Massachusetts. Its central village grew on the northern bank of the York River, remaining small until the second decade of the 18th century, when the threat of further French and Indian Wars began to subside in the region. The oldest portion of the Old York Gaol was built in 1719, as was the Benjamin Stone Tavern on York Street. The First Parish Church, which stands on York Street in the village center near the Old Gaol, was built in 1747 for the first established church congregation in the state. The York Harbor area located southeast of the village center (and included in this district) developed in the 18th and 19th century as a shipping and shipbuilding center, and the York Corner area, near United States Route 1, developed as a service area for inland travelers and farmers. The district is roughly bounded to the northeast by a line extending from US Route 1 to US Route 1A near its junction with Roaring Rock Road, and on the east by a line extending south from there to the mouth of the York River. The southern boundary extends westward, on the south side of the river, to Bartlett Road, with its western boundary extending north from their to the starting point. This area includes the traditional centers of York Village, York Harbor, and York Corner, along with the water- based resources of the York River that influenced the community's growth.

It is the third game in the MX vs. ATV series, available on Microsoft Windows and all seventh-generation systems except the Wii. It is also the final game in the series to be available on handheld systems. Gameplay The core focus of the game allows for the player to race motocross and supercross on motocross bikes or ATVs. The game also includes events such as omnicross, free ride, champion sport track, waypoint racing, and freestyle motocross. Although the game is part of the MX vs. ATV series, Reflex was built from the ground up featuring a new control scheme and physics engine. The new control scheme is labeled \\"reflex\\" which utilizes both analog sticks. The left analog controls the handlebars while the right analog stick controls the rider's body movement. The reflex system allows for unprecedented control and manipulation by allowing the player to 'ride' the motorcycle and other vehicles as they actually would. Tricks have been simplified from the previous games as the player only needs to hold the modifier button and use the right stick to make different combinations and flips. Also new to Reflex is real-time terrain deformation. Terrain deformation allows any of the different vehicles to literally carve into the earth creating ruts, berms, braking bumps and acceleration bumps as they actually do in real life. These ruts, berms and bumps are dynamic and constantly changing throughout the course of the race adding for an extra sense of realism. Online mode on consoles and PC consists of public and private rooms. These rooms are dedicated to specific event types (i.e. supercross) and host up to twelve players at a single time. A player's \\"motocard\\" keeps record of the player's progress through online events which earns them experience points that go towards the player's level. Mini games such as snake and tag are played online as well. The console and PC versions also support offline, 2-player split screen multiplayer, while the Nintendo DS version also supports local wireless multiplayer between up to four players. Development Rainbow Studios art director Ian Wood stated in an interview with SPOnG that the development team decided against making a Wii version of Reflex, but did not provide a clear reason why. He hinted that the developers chose to skip it to focus efforts on designing Reflex's new physics and terrain deforming system, key features that were better suited for the more powerful PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and personal computers. Tantalus Media, which developed the handheld versions of the previous game, MX vs. ATV Untamed, was invited once again to develop handheld versions for Reflex. Reception The Xbox 360 version received \\"generally favorable reviews\\", while the PlayStation 3 version received \\"average\\" reviews, just one point shy of \\"favorable\\", according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. A large portion of praise had gone towards both the new control scheme as well as the terrain deformation. Many acknowledged the game's successful separation of the rider from the machine with the rider reflex dual-analog control. Dakota Grabowski of GameZone said, \\"A wonderful foundation has been set and it's now time for Rainbow Studios to expand on what they have set up with their next iterations. The future is bright and fans should be rejoicing.\\" Austin Light of GameSpot said of the PS3 and X360 versions, \\"Unfortunately, things don't always work correctly in MX vs. ATV Reflex. Kinks in the physics system can lead to some unpredictable, chaotic rides.\\" Light also said, \\"Reflex is not a particularly good looking game on either system, with blurry, low-res textures that are distracting in the open world tracks.\\" IT Reviews acknowledged that \\"MX vs ATV isn't about pelting around with the throttle constantly revving to the max, rather the successful rider gets into the rhythm of the jumps. This is novel, and feels realistic.\\" However, the reviewer complained about aspects of the single player game, including CPU riders who are \\"borderline psychopathic\\", truck driving that is \\"far too easily mastered\\" and a campaign mode which is \\"rather unimaginative and flat\\" on an overall level. By contrast, the handheld versions received \\"generally unfavorable reviews\\" according to Metacritic. Chris Roper of IGN criticized the controls and presentation.

Exhibit The exhibit was a collaboration between Gail Buckland and the Brooklyn Museum, which began after the museum learned that Buckland was writing a book focusing on the photographers behind iconic rock-and-roll photographs. Buckland states in the preface to her book (also named, Who Shot Rock & Roll: A Photographic History, 1955-Present), \\"The Brooklyn Museum...invited me to work with them to develop and curate the most exciting museum show of rock-and-roll photography ever produced. The book serves as the catalogue to this landmark exhibition.\\" The exhibition is in six sections: behind the scenes; career beginnings; live performances; crowds and fans; portraits; images and album covers. The exhibit covers over 50 years of rock-and-roll history and encompasses 175 works from more than 100 photographers. Blondie played the opening party on October 29, 2009. Debbie Harry changed her hair color to brunette for the occasion.

Built in 1797, the house is significant as the home of the writer Kate Douglas Wiggin from 1905 until her death in 1923, and as a fine example of adaptive architectural change over time. One room of the house features wall murals attributed to Rufus Porter. The house was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1977. Description and history Quillcote is set on the west side of Salmon Falls Road in the Hollis side of Salmon Falls village, on the banks of the Saco River in southeastern Hollis. It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, five bays wide and two deep, with a front-facing gable roof and clapboard siding. This section has modest Greek Revival styling, including a fully pedimented gable that has three windows, the central one topped by a lancet-arched louver. The main entrance is centered on this facade, sheltered by a porch with Federal style Doric columns. To the rear of this block extends the oldest part of the house, a two-story wood frame structure, with another extending to the right. Further ells extend further behind the house, connecting it to a barn. Quillcote, 2016 The interior is arranged with public spaces in the front of the house, and a sitting room, kitchen, and pantry space in the rear, with bedrooms on the second floor. One bedroom in the older part of the house has a curved ceiling, suggesting it may have served as a ballroom at one time. A balcony was added to this room in 1905, standing above a bay window projecting from the sitting room below. The interior's most intriguing room is completely painted in murals, with a golden frieze border running around the top. This work is estimated to date to about 1820, and may be the work of Rufus Porter, who was then an itinerant painter producing stylistically similar works. The house's oldest portion was, according to local lore, built about 1797 by Jabez Bradbury. He and neighbor Thomas Carll exchanged houses in the early 19th century, and the Carll family is credited with bringing the house to most of its present appearance. Kate Douglas Wiggin, by then already a well-known author of children's books, acquired this house in 1905, having spent some years of her childhood in Salmon Falls. Her mother had, after her father's death, remarried to Albion Bradbury, whose house stands nearby. Widowed at the time, she named the house \\"Quillcote\\" (house of the pen), and lived there with her sister until both died.

Covering more than of central Saco, it includes houses from the 18th through 20th centuries, and the main business district along Main Street. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1998. Description and history Saco, located in southern Maine on the east side of the Saco River, was incorporated as Pepperellborough in 1762, honoring its major landowner, Sir William Pepperrell. Development was at first restricted to a small area near what is now called Factory Island in the Saco River, and did not begin to broaden until the early 18th century, because many of Pepperrell's lands were seized by the state because his heirs were Loyalist during the American Revolution, and were not sold off until 1798-99. Saco experienced significant economic growth in the 19th century, primarily through lumber, which was brought down the Saco from the interior, and the large textile mills which were first built on Factory Island in 1826. These industries both declined beginning in the 1940s. The historic district is roughly cruciform in shape, centered on the five-way junction of Main, Elm, Beach, and North Streets. Main Street (Maine State Route 9) and the main business district extends southwest, become more residential to the northeast of the junction, while the other roads are more residential in character. The oldest building in the district, dating to the late 18th century, is the Solomon Coit House at 380 Main Street, which was built in 1785. Two other houses, built in the 18th century, are like the Coit House Georgian in style, although that style was out of fashion when they were built. The district has a good representation of Federal period housing, and the Greek Revival, which came after the introduction of the mills, is also well represented. The Emma Hall House, at 342 Main Street, is the best example of a Queen Anne residence in the historic district. Three buildings in the district are separately listed on the National Register. Saco City Hall is a fine transitional Greek Revival-Italianate brick building, built in 1855. The J.G. Deering House is a high-quality Italianate house, which now houses the local library and historical museum. The Thacher-Goodale House on North Street (built 1828) is the city's finest example of a temple-fronted Greek Revival house. A fourth property, the First Parish Church on Beach Street, was listed, but was destroyed by fire in 2000, and has since been delisted.

Subsequently, firms might increase the production back up to maintain the usual level of inventory, which causes the GDP to bounce back. This bounce back is called an inventory bounce.

In 1951 the hospital merged with the Children's Hospital and Maine General Hospital to become Maine Medical Center. The facility was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1986. Description and history Holt Hall, Portland, Maine: view of northern fa√ßade The former Maine Eye and Ear Infirmary building is located in Portland's West End, at the southeast corner of Congress and Bramhall Streets, just east of the main campus of the Maine Medical Center. It is a brick building, six stories tall, with stone trim and a dormered hip roof, and a three-story ell extending to the south. Its ground floor functionally appears as a raised basement, finished in quarry-cut stone. The main entrance is on Bramhall Street, set in a two-story round-arched opening, and there are four storefronts on the Congress Street side, with plate glass display windows and recessed entrances, set between stone piers. The Maine Eye and Ear Infirmary was founded in 1886 by Dr. Erastus Eugene Holt, and was one of the first institutions of its type in the nation. This building was built for the infirmary in 1891 to a design by noted Portland architect John Calvin Stevens, and is an important transitional work of his, moving from the earlier Queen Anne and Romanesque styles toward the Colonial Revival. Stevens and his son John Howard Stevens designed large additions (not generally visible from the street) to the rear in 1916. Following the Infirmary's merger into the Maine Medical Center, it continued to be used for medical functions until 1980. It has since been converted to primarily residential use.

The common name arises from the parchment- like appearance of the tubes that house these worms. Parchment tube worms are filter feeders and spend their adult lives in their tubes, unless the tube is damaged or destroyed. They are planktonic in their juvenile forms, as is typical for polychaete annelids. Species include the recently discovered deep water Chaetopterus pugaporcinus and the well-studied Chaetopterus variopedatus. Housing tubes The tubes the worms live in are either attached to rocks, or, more commonly, buried in sandy bottoms in shallow waters. The worm has spines along its body segments that are modified for tunneling into the sandy substrate to create the u-shaped tube within which it lives. The tubes are upright u-shaped tunnels lined with mucous, then the parchment tube, with the worm living inside the parchment tube. Each parchment tube ends with a chimney of parchment that juts above the substrate. The tubes can be as long as 85 centimeters and up to 4 centimeters in diameter at the widest portion in the buried central part of the tube. The chimneys may be wide or much narrower than the rest of the tube. Worm morphology The worms are unique among the polychaete worms in the highly derived parapodia of the mid-segments of its body that are used in its specialized filter feeding regime. The worm's parapodia are modified into the shape of fans and used to create suction and pump water through the worm's parchment living tube. The morphology of the structures are used in identifying species. The worm feeds by using modified structures on its midbody segments that create mucus nets to trap food passed through the net. A flow of water containing plankton and organic debris is created by \\"circular flaps\\" on three segments that create suction that draws water through the living tube. Bioluminescence Members of the genus have no organs for detecting light and live their entire adult lives in their buried tubes. In spite of this, known members of the genera exhibit strong bioluminescence. When the worm is disturbed in its home it moves to the end of the tube away from the disturbance and near the disturbance it emits its feeding mucus with crystals that exhibit blue luminescence. Commensal animals Two species of filter-feeding crustaceans from different families may make their homes in the Chaetopterus tube, Polyonyx gibbesi (family Porcellanidae) and Pinnixa chaetopterana (family Pinnotheridae) ;Haig J.(1960) The Porcellanidae (Crustacea, Anomura) of the Eastern Pacific. Allan Hancock Pacific Expeditions 24, 1‚Äì440. while a third species, Tumidotheres maculatus is known to sometimes inhabit the tubes. Polyonyx and Pinnixa are almost always present in the tubes, generally as a pair of crabs, and both species may inhabit the tubes at the same time. However, breeding pairs of either species do not share the tubes with adults of the other species. The crustaceans may live most of their lives in the tubes, leaving in the case of disturbance by exiting through the chimneys at either ends or, when the chimneys are too narrow, by biting through the parchment tube. A nudibranch, Tenellia chaetopterana also lives within the tubes of a species of Chaetopterus. It is hypothesised that this nudibranch feeds on the mucus net which Chaetopterus uses to trap its food or on the faeces of Chaetopterus. Tenellia rolleri is another nudibranch with similar flattened morphology which lives in muddy areas with no obvious food source, but abundant Chaetopterus tubes. It is possible that it lives and feeds in a similar manner.Ekimova I., Deart Y. & Schepetov D. (2017).

It was formed in November 1950 as No. 30 Communications Unit and based at Iwakuni, Japan, as part of No. 91 (Composite) Wing. The unit was initially equipped with four Douglas C‚Äì47 Dakotas and two Austers, one of the Dakotas being the personal transport of Lieutenant General Sir Horace Robertson, commander of the British Commonwealth Occupation Force (BCOF). Another four Dakotas were sent to Japan due to operational demands. The unit's role in Korea was to support No. 77 (Fighter) Squadron by transporting supplies and equipment. It also delivered materials and stores to Australian and Commonwealth ground forces, and transported VIPs of the United Nations Command. Return journeys to Japan were often used to evacuate wounded personnel from the theatre. No. 30 Communications Unit was redesignated No. 30 Transport Unit in November 1951, and re-formed as No. 36 (Transport) Squadron in March 1953. The squadron remained in Korea following the armistice, and returned to Australia in June 1955.

It was initially commanded, unofficially, by Flight Lieutenant (later Air Commodore) Dave Hitchens. According to Hitchens, \\"Having commanded the communications flight in No. 77 Squadron, I assumed control but had no formal authority to do so, but nobody told me to stop.\\" The transport aircraft included the personal Dakota of the BCOF commander, Lieutenant General Sir Horace Robertson, operating under his direction. During November 1950, the unit received another four Dakotas from No. 38 Squadron (of No. 90 (Composite) Wing in Malaya), giving it a total strength of eight Dakotas and two Austers.Stephens, Going Solo, p. 247 It supported all Australian forces in Korea. One of its key functions was medical evacuation, but it was also responsible for supply drops, search and rescue, reconnaissance, and mail delivery, as well as transporting cargo, troops, and VIPs.

Fullerton (December 11, 1950 ‚Äì November 24, 2016) was an American inventor best known for the invention of ultra-wideband technology, correlated magnetics, and a number of other industrial, military, and consumer technologies. He co-founded Time Domain Corporation in 1987 and Cedar Ridge Research in 2006. He holds more than 500 patents around the world for technologies as diverse as ground sonar, new magnetics technology, and radio pulse technology. Early life Fullerton was born in Arkansas into a military family, and spent most of his younger years in Europe. He returned to the United States with his family in 1969. In 1979 he moved to Alabama after landing a job with NASA in Huntsville, Alabama. Career According to Discover magazine, Fullerton's ultra-wideband technology is a method of transmitting pulse signals at low levels across an ultra-wide frequency range. This low level allows them to be transmitted without interfering with the standard radio waves being transmitted. The idea for the new technology came to Fullerton while a college student at the University of Arkansas in 1973. Other inventions by Fullerton include three patented Internet technology methods of linking, storing and transmitting information, and a new magnetics technology that makes it possible to create programmable magnets that directly correlate with precision between magnet pairs. Fullerton has applied for patents for a number of applications of the new magnetics technology, including a correlated magnetic container and a magnetic force profile system that uses coded magnet structures. Fullerton founded Midsouth Technology in 1976 for the development of his high-technology developments. In 1987, he founded Time Domain Corporation to develop and market technologies such as ultra-wideband radio transmission technology. He also co-founded SoundBlast Technologies LLC in 2006 to develop his unique coherent detonation wave invention. His SoundBlast invention eliminates the deflagration process in the creation of a detonation wave in a short tube, enabling a timing accuracy of sub 20¬µs. This timing accuracy allows for the assembly of very useful arrays of coherent detonation tubes. His detonation wave technology has applications in propulsion, weapons, and as a high energy impulse seismic source. In 2006, Fullerton and co-founder Mark Roberts founded Cedar Ridge Research in order to develop new technologies in a wide variety of fields. Programmable magnet technology has been among those inventions. Fullerton died on November 24, 2016, at the age of 65 from brain cancer. Awards He has won several prestigious awards for his inventions, including the HOBY Inspiration Award and was given the Aviation Week & Space Technology Laureate award. He was made a Senior Member of The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Inc., to honor his achievements in ultra-wideband technology. In 2010 he was awarded a place on Fast Company's 100 Most Creative People in Business list, coming in at number 81. In 2010 he was awarded a 2010 Breakthrough Award by Popular Mechanics magazine for his contributions to magnetics.

Biography Wilson was born in North York, Ontario, Canada to Scottish immigrants and performed his first night club show when he was only 14 years old with Canadian reggae pioneers Messenjah. He later led the band Tabarruk, whose debut self-titled album included a duet with Wilson and Alanis Morissette.J.

Bearman, \\"Rastaman Variations\\", Eye Magazine, (May 21, 1998), p.21. Following their debut, the act's name was changed to Jason Wilson & Tabarruk who released Dark Corners in 1998 (which included the song \\"Icarus' Lament\\"), followed by the Juno-nominated Jonah (2000) and then the critically acclaimed Dread & Blue (2004) which spawned Wilson's anthem \\"Keele Street\\" which has been featured several times on Canadian radio, film and television, including on the Canadian television production Da Kink in My Hair. Following this album, Wilson embarked on a solo career releasing the Juno-nominated and Canadian Reggae Music Award-winning The Peacemaker's Chauffeur in 2008.E.

Wilson was awarded the Karl Mullings Memorial Award for commitment to reggae in Canada in 2007. Wilson's life story and music have been featured many times on radio and television, including a mini- doc entitled The Grateful Dread on CBC's The National with Peter Mansbridge as well as a feature documentary on BBC Radio. Wilson is also one half of the successful Marley/Dylan tribute act The Two Bobs, alongside Fergus Hambleton, the lead singer of the two-time Juno-Award-winning reggae act The Sattalites.G. Quill, \\"Two Musical Icons, One Heartfelt Style\\", The Toronto Star, (January 25, 2006), pp. Entertainment Section Cover Page, E2. Wilson is also one-half of the reggae-folk combo Wilson & Swarbrick and is the leader of Soldiers of Song, a tribute to The Dumbells, Canada's famous concert party of World War I. Soldiers of Song was also featured on The National in 2013. An award-winning author, Wilson co-wrote Lord Stanley: The Man Behind the Cup with Kevin Shea in 2006 that won the New York-based Heritage Award for Outstanding Sports Research and Writing.J.J. Wilson and K. Shea, Lord Stanley: The Man Behind the Cup, (Toronto: Fenn Publishing, 2006). Winner of a SSHRC scholarship, Wilson received his PhD in Canadian History at the University of Guelph in 2013. Wilson has also been published several times on a wide variety of historical topics (see Books and articles). In 2009, Wilson was nominated by the Guelph Mercury for their \\"Top 40 Under 40\\" for his achievements in music and in academics.\\"Jason Wilson\\" , Guelph Mercury, (June 26, 2009), retrieved on February 11, 2009 In the summer of 2009, Wilson served as the lone professional musician on the advisory committee alongside Senator Pamela Wallin and others for the \\"Cantos at the King Eddy\\" project in Calgary that will soon serve as the nation's music museum. In 2014, Wilson released a full- length album with English fiddler and former Fairport Convention member Dave Swarbrick entitled The Lion Rampant. The critically acclaimed album included special guests Martin Carthy, Peggy Seeger, Pee Wee Ellis and John Kirkpatrick.Colin Irwin, \\"Rebel Music: Dave Swarbrick, Jason Wilson and David Francey\\", Penguin Eggs, (Summer 2009), pp.22‚Äì24 British folk music critic Ken Hunt called the album: \\"Head and shoulders, the most eclectic, catholic and coherent musical banquet of 2014 thus far.\\"http://www.frootsmag.com/ In 2016, Jason Wilson and the Perennials released the first album of trilogy entitled Perennials. Wilson wrote the album in New York City while his wife was working at the UN. The sextet, which includes trumpet, sax, bass, guitar, cajon and Wilson on piano and vocals, is playing several dates across Canada in support of the release. Style The improvisation element to Wilson's style is not typical in reggae, but rather borrows heavily from the jazz tradition. Wilson has covered the music of many divergent artists both live and in the studio, a fact that speaks to the broad spectrum of his tastes. These artists include Kate Bush, Thelonious Monk, Wayne Shorter, Sergei Rachmaninoff, Oscar Peterson and Elton John.S. Cook, \\"Jason Wilson\\", Performance Review, The Live Music Report, (September 25, 2008), retrieved on December 2, 2016 The music of his Scottish heritage also has, at times, been incorporated into Wilson's music.K. Shea, \\"Big Shinny Tunes\\", Legends Magazine, (Toronto: Hockey Hall of Fame, Fall 2003), pp.74, 76‚Äì78. Still, reggae is the key ingredient in Wilson's art and the keyboard stylings of his mentor Jackie Mittoo can be heard throughout Wilson's work. The British school of reggae has had perhaps the most profound influence on Wilson's writing. In particular, Wilson has admittedly studied the sound of the bands Aswad, Steel Pulse, Matumbi and UB40. Wilson's cousin Michael Virtue was the keyboardist for UB40 for twenty-eight years and appears on Wilson's Jonah album.

On a tour that was unsuccessful on a whole, the tourists lost the Test series 2‚Äì0 to an Indian side led by Anil Kumble and Mahendra Singh Dhoni, while they drew two warm-up matches against the Centre of Excellence (non-first-class match) and Indian Board President's XI. This was Ponting's first full tour of India as captain, after previously being injured for three of the four Tests when Australia last visited in 2004. On previous Test tours of India in 1997‚Äì98, 2000‚Äì01 and 2004‚Äì05, Ponting struggled, especially against the off-spin from Harbhajan Singh, who had dismissed him on eight occasions in Tests. Ponting had only scored 172 runs in eight Tests and 14 innings in India, with a highest of 60‚Äîhis only half-century in the country‚Äîand an average of 12.28, well below his career average of 58.53 prior to the series. However, in 11 home Tests against India, he had averaged 79.35. Ponting's tour started well, scoring a half-century in the second tour match and a century in the opening Test. However, his performances diminished as his team began to struggle against an experienced Indian outfit. He managed only one other half-century for the series, totaling 266 runs at an average of 38, dropping his overall Test average to 57.58. In the final Test in Nagpur‚Äîin which Australia needed victory to level the series‚ÄîPonting was criticized for bowling part-time spin bowlers in an effort to increase the over rate, to avoid suspension and a fine. When the fast bowlers were re-introduced, the match was beyond Australia's grasp and India were eventual victors. These tactics were severely criticised in Australia. Background and early tour The series was the first time Ponting captained the Australians in a full Test series in India. He did not lead the Australian team to victory there in 2004‚Äì05 because he missed the first three Tests with injury. Adam Gilchrist took the Australians to a 2‚Äì1 victory. Australia, however, lost the fourth and final Test in Mumbai when Ponting returned. Nevertheless, this was Australia's first Test series win in India since 1969‚Äì70, in which Ponting made 11 and 12 on a controversial pitch. Ponting and his team were under pressure leading into the series, following the spiteful confrontations during the Indian tour of Australia earlier in the year. He had also struggled in a previous three Test series during 2001, scoring 17 runs at 3.40. Ponting acknowledged prior to the series that he was keen to rectify his poor Test batting record in India, believed to be because of his weakness against spin bowling. Though, from 1 January 2004 up until the start of the first Test, Ponting scored 1510 runs and an average of 83.88 in 64 innings against spin bowling, thus being the only Australian to score more than 1,300 runs and average over 70.Why Australia will miss Symonds in India, Cricinfo, 19 September 2008 First Test Australia headed into the First Test at the M Chinnaswamy Stadium in Bangalore with two previous wins at the venue‚Äîin 1998 and 2004‚Äîand a draw. Meanwhile, India had not won at the venue since 1995, and had only four victories in 17 attempts‚Äîtheir worst Test win‚Äìloss ratio at home venues.\\"Australia bank on Bangalore factor\\", Cricinfo, 8 October 2008, accessed 2 November 2009 Harbhajan Singh dismissed Ponting for the tenth time in the First Test. Australia won the toss and batted, and Ponting was brought to the middle in the opening over, after Matthew Hayden was caught behind for a duck. He started slowly, scoring two from 17 balls, before driving Ishant Sharma for a boundary. Harbhajan Singh had already sent down 2.3 overs before he delivered his first ball to Ponting in the 17th over.

I had a point to prove to a few people as well. It was satisfying today.\\" I've been working really hard,\\" Ponting said on his technique. \\"I've made no secret of it, my record here has been poor. Today is one step in the right direction. It was nice to get some runs out there and put the team in a good position. But one innings doesn't make a tour. The other tours I've had here, apart from the last Test I played, I've batted at six, always coming in against spin and when the wicket has worn. One thing that stands out in my career is whenever I've been in early, with the team in a bit of trouble, I've managed to make runs.\\"\\"Hard work pays off for Ponting\\", Cricinfo, 9 October 2008, accessed 24 September 2009 Australia were bowled out for 430 shortly after tea on the second day. Michael Hussey scored his ninth Test centuryPonting and Armstrong (2009), p. 22. before the tourists tail folded. Australia had the hosts seven wickets down in their first innings‚Äîstill more than 320 runs in arrears‚Äîbefore Harbhajan and Khan combined for an 80 run partnership late on day three. In Australia's second innings, Ponting joined Katich in the 13th over, after Hayden was dismissed. Ponting lasted 34 balls, before he was caught a short mid-wicket from a Sharma slower ball on 17. Beforehand, the Australian captain was \\"targeted\\" by Harbhajan \\"with men crowded around the bat.\\" Australia declared on 228 on the final day; however India survived, enforcing a draw.\\"India fight but Australia hold firm\\", Cricinfo, 12 October 2008, accessed 3 November 2009 Second Test Prior to the Second Test starting on 17 October in Mohali, Australian opening batsman Phil Jaques (who did not play in the opening Test) was sent home after failing to overcome a back injury. He was replaced in the squad by Shaun Marsh, who opened the batting in the recently concluded One Day Internationals against the West Indies and had been the leading run-scorer in the 2008 Indian Premier League.Ponting and Armstrong (2009), p. 27. Victorian fast-bowler Peter Siddle made his international debut, after Stuart Clark injured his elbow. Ponting himself was forced to take anti-inflammatory tablets, after surgery before the series. Winning the toss and batting, India reached 5/311 by stumps on the opening day. India were bowled out for 469 on the second day, after Ganguly scored his 16th and last Test century. Hayden was bowled for a third-ball duck, while Ponting was trapped lbw by a Sharma off cutter for five, as Australia collapsed to 5/58 and then 8/144 in their first innings reply. Shane Watson and Brett Lee combined for 73 eight wicket partnership, helping Australia reach a meagre 268. In the home-side's second innings, Ponting was criticised for using part-timers against the free-scoring Indian batsmen after he was informed that he was five overs behind the required over rate, which is penalisable by a fine, or in severe instances, a ban to the captain. This meant that he was not able to use pace spearhead Brett Lee significantly.Ponting and Armstrong (2009), pp. 26‚Äì29. A long discussion between Lee and Ponting prompted media allegations of a team rift, something Ponting denied. \\"It seems like there are people trying to make a bit more of that than what it actually was,\\" Ponting said after his team's defeat. \\"I made Brett aware he wasn't going to bowl first-thing in the morning. I let him know we were wanting to take pace off the ball.\\" Where it fell down a bit is I didn't communicate those reasons to Brett at 11am when he wanted to bowl. I made it clear to him from that moment on of those reasons.\\" After India declared on 3/314 with just over four sessions of play remaining, Australia were bowled out for 195 on the fifth morning, with Ponting's off stump knocked out of the ground by another Sharma off cutter for just 2, as India completed a 320 run victory. Third Test The Third Test in Delhi saw India amass 7/613 in its first innings, while Delhi smog‚Äîleft over from Diwali festivals‚Äîcreated an unusual atmosphere. Gautam Gambhir and VVS Laxman both scored double centuries‚Äîthe first time two batsmen have reached 200 in the same Test innings against Australia‚Äîand Ponting even resorted to bowling himself for two unsuccessful overs.Ponting and Armstrong (2009), pp. 36‚Äì38. In reply Australia started strongly, with Ponting having to wait until 123 runs were scored before walking out to bat on the third day. After surviving a spell reverse-swing bowling from Ishant Sharma and Zaheer Khan, Ponting was bowled through the gate from a sharp turning delivery from part-time off- spinner Virender Sehwag. Ponting and out-of-form opener Matthew Hayden partnered for a cautious 79-run compilation, as both looked to survive on a pitch that was becoming lower and slower. Ponting was more cautious against Sharma than usual, scoring only nine from 26 balls from the tall right-armer quick. Nevertheless, he was more aggressive and assured against spinners Amit Mishra and Sehwag, where he scored 35 from 60 and 17 from 32 deliveries respectively. During the early stage of his innings, a swarm of bees interrupted the match when they forced the players and officials to lie on the ground, before they moved on. After surviving four dropped catches, Michael Clarke scored his eight Test century in Australia's highest Test score in India‚Äî577‚Äîas Sehwag took a career best five wickets in the absence of fellow spinners Harbhajan Singh and Kumble who left the field with a finger injury. India lost two late Indian wickets on the fourth evening and were reduced to 4/93 on the fifth morning; however the match ended in a tame draw, with the home side declaring on 5/208, setting Australia an unrealistic target of 245 in the final session. They finished on 31 without loss, before the match was declared a draw, resulting in Australia needing victory in the final Test to regain the Border-Gavaskar Trophy.Ponting and Armstrong (2009), pp. 38‚Äì39. Fourth Test With Australia needing to win the Fourth Test, Jason Krejza was selected for his Australian debut. The match was played at the Vidarbha Cricket Association Stadium in Nagpur, which was making its debut as an international venue. Previous matches in the city were played at the Vidarbha Cricket Association Ground and both teams were unsure how the pitch would play, as the match was also the first first-class match to be played at the stadium. Nevertheless, Ponting described said the pitch was grassless and hard as concrete. Ponting understood the importance of the match, \\"This is probably as big a Test match as a lot of us have played.\\" He said. \\"Being 1‚Äì0 down with a match to play is a position that a lot of us haven't been in before. We pride ourselves on playing well in big games, and this is certainly a big game for us. There is a great opportunity for us to stand up, and play better cricket than we've played in the first three Test matches.\\" Throughout the first three Tests, Australian bowlers struggled to take wickets, managing 38 wickets at an average of 53.61. After losing the toss, Australia were sent into field. Their bowling attack again struggled to be effective, with Sachin Tendulkar scoring his 40th Test century (10th against Australia) and VVS Laxman compiling a slow 64. The only highlight for the Australian was Krejza's 8/215 from 43.5 overs, as India amassed 445. The off-spinners figures was the second best by an Australian on debut in Test history. Matthew Hayden and Simon Katich started quickly for Australia, reaching 32 in the seventh over, before Hayden was run-out.Ponting and Armstrong (2009), pp. 44‚Äì47. Ponting played freely, scoring 11 runs from the final three balls of an Ishant Sharma over. However, in the following over he was clean bowled for 24 (41 balls) by a Harbhajan Singh delivery that spun and left him cramped for room while trying to cut. This was the tenth occasion he had been dismissed by Harbhajan in Tests. On the fourth afternoon of the Fourth Test, the Indian batting collapsed, and Australia had an opportunity to bowl them out and chase a target of around 250‚Äì300 after the tea break.\\"Cricket writers and commentators were stunned by what they saw as [Ponting's] efforts to improve Australia's sluggish over rate rather than going for broke to try and win the vital Nagpur Test.\\" \\"Aussie press slams Ponting tactics \\", AFP 9 November 2008. However, the Australians were a long way behind on their over rate, so in order to avoid a one match suspension, Ponting chose to bowl their part-time spinners and medium pacers such as Michael Clarke, Cameron White and Mike Hussey (who were all unsuccessful in capturing a wicket), as they took less time. In the meantime, captain MS Dhoni and Harbhajan both added half centuries. This drew strong criticism from many commentators, who suggested that their faster bowlers, who had been responsible for the collapse, could have bowled from a shorter run-up. When the fast bowlers were reintroduced, the last four wickets fell quickly. This left Australia with 382 runs for victory and Ponting fell cheaply after attempting to take a quick single down the ground and being run out by a direct hit from Mishra at the non-striker's end. Australia lost by 172 runs to cede the series 2‚Äì0. In the first innings, Ponting became Harbhajan's 300th Test wicket. He ended the series with 264 runs at 37.71. While below his career standards, it was substantially better than his previous Test efforts in India. Ponting escaped without suspension for slow over rates, although he received a fine. Nevertheless, he failed to redress the matter during the subsequent home series against New Zealand, when match referee Chris Broad dealt a second successive fine for being three overs behind in the First Test. Ponting was subsequently stripped of thirty per cent of his A$12,750 match fee, twice the punishment of his team-mates in accordance with International Cricket Council rules for captains. Australia were largely untroubled by New Zealand, sweeping both Tests. Ponting scored only 100 runs at 33.33. Aftermath Ponting was severely criticised for using the part-time bowlers ahead of his frontline men. Respected media analyst Peter Roebuck wrote in The Sydney Morning Herald and The Age, \\"In one of the most baffling displays of captaincy seen in the long and proud history of Australian cricket, Ricky Ponting has denied his side a deserved chance of securing a famous victory. Rather than pressing home an advantage secured by dint of outstanding swing bowling and inspired spin in a fraught and fascinating afternoon session, the Australian captain preferred to use part- timers. Presumably, it was an attempt to improve an ailing over rate. Perhaps he was worried about missing the next match. Both issues pale into insignificance besides trying with every power at his disposal to retain the Border-Gavaskar Trophy. There was a match to win. To an almost bizarre degree, Ponting lost the plot.\\" \\"Over 131 years, 404 men have been accorded to the honour of wearing the baggy green cap, arguably the most significant and recognizable symbol in Australian team sport,\\" wrote Australian Broadcasting Corporation's (ABC) Glenn Mitchell. \\"Many today would have hung their head in sadness while others would have turned and in their grave. What happened today in Nagpur was at odds with team sport is all about. May it never be allowed to happen again.\\" The barrage of Ponting's decision continued, with then Australian leading Test run-scorer (since overtaken by Ponting) saying on Fox Sports, \\"I don't know what to make of this. They go into the tea break on a high and come out worrying about over-rates. I am glad Ricky can't read my mind right now because he is not going to like it.\\" Ponting later admitted that Border's comment was the one that hurt him the most, despite News Limited reporter Jon Pierik describing his captaincy as a \\"joke\\", while Malcolm Conn from The Australian wrote it was his \\"worst day as national captain\\". Indian newspapers also continued with the criticism, with some suggesting Ponting put himself before the team.Ponting and Armstrong (2009), pp. 51‚Äì52. Ponting angrily responded to such comments at the post-Test media conference.

He was a student in a technical school until conscripted in 1915. At first, he was assigned to duty in ordnance factories. However, he was forwarded to the 3rd Infantry Regiment. From there, he went to aviation training. On 18 October 1916, he qualified as a pilot at Gabardini's flying school at Cameri. He was certified on the Caudron G.3 on 4 December.Franks et al 1997, p. 139. On 28 April 1917, Eleuteri mastered the SAML before being posted out. He served with two SAML squadrons, 73a Squadriglia and 121a Squadriglia. In January 1918, he underwent gunnery training at Furbara. On 22 February 1918, he was transferred to 70a Squadriglia. After flying a few sorties, he made an abortive attack on an observation balloon. On 17 April, he teamed with Aldo Bocchese, Alessandro Resch, and Flaminio Avet in staking claims for an enemy two-seater and two fighters; Eleuteri was credited with two victories. Eleuteri would go on to fly 151 combat sorties and would engage the Austro-Hungarian enemy 26 times. He had seven of his eight combat claims confirmed, usually in conjunction with Bocchese and Avet, with his final victory forced to land on an Italian aerodrome on 28 October 1918. Leopoldo Eleuteri was thrice awarded the Silver Medal for Military Valor, as well as the War Merit Cross. Following his discharge after the war, he returned to his engineering studies, enrolling in Milan Polytechnic. He graduated in 1922. In 1923, he entered the first engineering officers' competition for the Regia Aeronautica and was appointed as Capitano in the construction section of the new air force on 23 October. He returned to Furbara as commander of the armament flight in the research and development portion of the Regia Aeronautica. On 19 January 1926, Leopoldo Eleuteri perished in a midair collision.

It is similar to Kunzea affinis and where the ranges of the two species overlap, hybrids occur. Description Kunzea jucunda is a shrub with a few erect main stems and many short side branches. It usually grows to a height of and is mostly glabrous except for a few hairs around the flowers and youngest leaves. The leaves are glabrous, mostly elliptic in shape, about long and wide with a petiole less than long. The flowers are arranged in heads of mostly two to four on the ends of the side branches. The flowers are surrounded by bracts which are about long and wide, mostly glabrous except for a few hairs around the edges and by pairs of smaller bracteoles. The floral cup is about long and the five sepals are lance-shaped, glabrous and about long. The five petals are spatula-shaped to almost round, about long and pink to deep mauve. There are eighteen to twenty four stamens in several rows in each flower. Flowering occurs mainly between August and October and is followed by fruit which are urn-shaped capsules with five vertical ridges. This kunzea is similar to K. affinis but is distinguished mainly by the mostly glabrous leaves and bracts. Where the ranges of the two species meet, hybrids often occur. Taxonomy and naming Kunzea jucunda was first formally described in 1904 by Ludwig Diels and Ernst Georg Pritzel and the description was published in the journal Botanische Jahrb√ºcher f√ºr Systematik, Pflanzengeschichte und Pflanzengeographie. The specific epithet (jucunda) is a Latin word meaning \\"pleasant, agreeable or delightful\\". Distribution and habitat This kunzea grows in a wide range of habitats, but often occurs on sandy or rocky soils of undulating plains, mostly between the Stirling Range and Ravensthorpe in the Esperance Plains and Mallee biogeographic regions. Conservation Kunzea jucunda is classified as \\"Not Threatened\\" by the Western Australian Government Department of Parks and Wildlife.

Maize is cropped almost everywhere in Ecuador, with the exception of the Altiplano, the cold desert highlands 3000 meters above sea level. Maize production is concentrated in the provinces of Loja, Azuay, and Pichincha, and to a lesser extant Bol√≠var, Chimborazo, Tungurahua, and Imbabura, provinces located in the mountains. Maize is also found in the coastal provinces, Manab√≠, Esmeraldas, and Guayas, as well as Pastaza, part of the Ecuadorian Amazon. Use as food Most traditional foods are strictly linked to specific maize kernel types as well as grinding and cooking techniques. Cooked or toasted grains, and puddings of partially ripe grains, are prepared with mostly floury kernel varieties; * Chicha - brewed drink of ground maize kernels, * Chullpi - sweet maize, * Ma√≠z tierno - soft maize, at the milk ripeness stage, * Ma√≠z cao - waxy stage maize, * Mote - boiled maize with beans, * Canguil - popcorn, * Pan - bread of maize flour, kneaded and baked, * Tamal - maize and meat rolls, * Tortillas - flatbread of maize flour, kneaded and cooked on a hot plate, * Tostado - toasted maize with or without fat. History Maize is believed to have crossed the Isthmus of Panama around 5,000 years BCE reaching Colombia and later the Ecuadorian coast. Since then, domestication and evolution of native varieties followed this pattern; * adaptation to the low and middle highlands of the Eastern Andes, * creation of the primitive races and extension of the adaptation area, * introgression by hybridization with Tripsacum, * partial introduction of maize from other regions, * inter-racial hybridization and creation of hybrid races in the highlands, * selection of the endosperm composition, kernel size and shelling fitness, taste, and the suitability for chicha and chicha morada brewed drinks. The first description of Ecuadorian maize varieties was written by the colonial chronicler Father Juan de Velasco (1727‚Äì1792);Historia del reino de Quito 1789. Tomo I, Parte I, Libro 2, $ 7, par. 5: Ma√≠z o sara * Amarillo (Yellow) - large and soft, * Blanco (White) - large, long, very soft, used for bread flour, * Canguil - small, hard, pointed, used for popcorn, * Carapali - medium size, white with red apex, * Chulpi or Chullpi - white, medium, very soft and sweet, sweet corn, * Morocho - small, medium, yellow, hard, used to brew chicha, * Negro grueso - black, large, and hard, * Negro mediano - black and soft, * Tumbaque - large, flat, dark green, and soft. Contemporary classification Kernels of maize varieties eaten in Ecuador are the outcome of the evolution of varieties of the following morphological groups described by Alfred Sturtevant; * Zea mays everta - popcorn, known locally as canguiles, * Zea mays amylosaccharata - sweet corn, known locally as chullpi, * Zea mays indurada - dark maize, known locally as ma√≠z morocho, * Zea mays amylacea - soft maize, known locally as ma√≠z suave. During 1962 and 1963 Aureliano Brandolini collected 458 seed samples of the Ecuadorian varieties within the equatorial zone, between 2¬∞ North and -6¬∞ South.Elementos para la programaci√≥n agropecuaria del Ecuador. Desarrollo de los cereales: Ma√≠z, Aureliano Brandolini, 1963 - American status organization, Rome ‚Äì Washington D.C. The comparative study of the behavior of these accessions resulted in the identification of racial complexes corresponding to those described earlier by D.H. Timothy and collaborators.Races of maize in Ecuador, Timothy D. H., Hatheway W. H., Grant U. J., Torregrosa M., Varela A. D., Sarria V. D. Nat. Acad. Sci. - Nat. Res. Council, Washington D.C. Publ. N. 975, 1963 A few races, morocho, harinoso dentado, monta√±a, and candela, were not included in the sampled varieties, while a few new races were described, such as colorado puntiagudo, harinoso c√≥nico, and huaco sara, as well as tunicata, a variety cropped in Bol√≠var Province. The classification of Ecuadorian maize was based on the following data; location and environment (altitude and photoperiodic response included), plant and ear characteristics, cytological analysis of the chromosomes, and historic and ethnographic information concerning the crop. The tripsacoid races of everta, indentata, and indurata, sections were separated from the primitive ones of the amilacea, amylosaccharata, indurata, and tunicata sections, and from maize imported or derived in historical times from the amylacea and indurata sections. This study underlined that: * The Canguiles group from the Andean highlands is not sensitive to photoperiod change, as well as the Lima varieties of possible recent introduction. These varieties apparently have gametophytic isolation characteristics. * The varieties of lowland tropical origin are luxuriant, reaching over 5.5 meters of height, tassel excluded. By comparison, Canguiles and the flint kernel maize from the highlands sierra, Morocho, Patillo, Perlilla, and Tusilla, have a plant size lower than 2.0 meters. * The tassel size varies greatly and is not linked to the environment; the shortest tassel is that of the tropical Dentado, the largest, 55 cm, is that of the sierra Uchima.

It is especially popular in the fall and winter and is traditionally associated with the holiday season. In the United States, the drink has a venerable history which dates back to colonial days. During that time many families had their own individual recipes, and early Americans believed rum to be nutritious and a strengthener of the body. In How to Mix Drinks: Or, The Bon-vivant's Companion,Thomas, Jerry, \\"How to Mix Drinks: Or, the Bon-Vivant's Companion\\", New York: Dick & Fitzgerald, 1862. 263 pages. available via www.archive.org https://books.google.com/books?id=QDUEAAAAYAAJ&oe;=UTF-8 mid-19th-century bartender Jerry Thomas provides two recipes (No. 207 and 208, p. 80) for hot rum drinks. The first is called Hot Spiced Rum. The recipe calls for sugar, Jamaica rum, cloves, allspice, butter, and hot water. The second is simply called Hot Rum, and the recipe is the same as for Hot Spiced Rum but omits the spices. In their stead a bit of nutmeg is grated over the top of the drink. Variations Some versions call for vanilla ice cream as a substitute or complement to the butter for added creaminess. New versions that some believe to be healthier employ organic coconut oil instead of butter. Tiki versions Hot Buttered Rum saw new interest in the 1940s as a Tiki drink when it was typically served in a ceramic skull mug or modified to become Coffee Grog. Trader Vic provided a recipe for \\"hot buttered rum batter\\" in his Bartender's Guide which called for 1 lb. of brown sugar, 1/4 lb. of butter, salt and other spices (nutmeg, cinnamon, and cloves). In touting the virtues of Hot Buttered Rum he also provided a warning: \\"As usually served, it is a weak little noggin with bits of butter floating on top which look good stuck on the customer's upper lip. I urge the use of a batter in order to make some fine drinks\\". The batter was also used as a basis in other warm alcoholic drinks of his creation such as the Northwest Passage and Hot Buttered Rum Cow. Beyond Trader Vic, at least two other different Tiki versions were also made circa 1950. One was the Volcano House Hot Buttered Rum from the Volcano House Hotel in Hawaii, and the other was the Pub and Prow Hot Buttered Rum from a Chicago restaurant of the same name. The Volcano House Hotel's recipe was unusual in that it also called for Maraschino liqueur. While overproof rum such as Bacardi 151 or Stroh 160 can be used in some versions, early recipes do not call for the drink to be lit on fire when served, even though it is now sometimes done and is part of the presentation for the hot-buttered rum based Coffee Grog. In popular culture A close-up view of hot buttered rum Kenneth Roberts worked the drink into his story for the bestselling 1937 novel Northwest Passage, which some also attribute to the drink's renewed popularity in the 1940s. Wrote Roberts: ‚ÄúAfter a man‚Äôs had two‚Äîthree drinks of hot buttered rum, he don‚Äôt shoot a catamount\\". Some celebrate January 17th as \\"Hot Buttered Rum Day\\".

The shootings, beatings and plunder, continued for three days in more than a dozen separate locations around the city. Approximately 1,140 Polish civilians (150 of whom were ethnically Jewish), were murdered. Background The city of Czƒôstochowa (population 117,000 in 1931)Kielce Voivodeship (1919‚Äì39), Spis powszechny, 1931; PDF. Commons.

Many able-bodied men left the city along with the Polish soldiers. The 42 Infantry Regiment \\"Bayreuth\\" of the Wehrmacht's 10th Army entered the city early in the afternoon. On that day, their guns were not loaded, as the Wehrmacht command was more concerned with the risk of \\"friendly fire\\" caused by inexperience and nervousness on the part of the troops, than of possible threat from the Polish rear guard. Notably, the German wild shootings caused by fear, had broken out elsewhere, often leading to massacres of civilians as in Kajetanowice. Archived diaries of the German soldiers as well as the official army reports reveal that the remaining civilian population of the city acted peacefully and did not obstruct the German army in any way. The evening of 3 September passed without any incidents. Searches of houses and business premies turned up no concealed weapons. Massacre The Wehrmacht entering the suburbs of Czestochowa The Regimental headquarters, located 20 km south of the city, received a report on the evening of 4 September from the German units of the 42nd Regiment (46th Infantry Division (Wehrmacht)), alleging that they had been attacked by \\"Polish partisans\\" in two different incidents; one in the courtyard of the Technical School where the regiment stationed, and one involving a prisoner column guarded by the 97th Regiment. The German soldiers claimed to have been shot at from one of the houses near where they were.John Mosier, Cross of Iron: The Rise and Fall of the German War Machine, 1918-1945, Macmillan, 2007, pg. 237. However, subsequent reports and testimonies of soldiers inform that none of the German witnesses were able to describe the supposed attackers. A search of houses that took place after the massacre failed to turn up any \\"suspicious persons\\". According to German historian Jochen B√∂hler, the shootings were perpetrated by panicking and nervous (most likely drugged out of their wits) German soldiers who then used the imagined or invented \\"Polish partisans\\" as an excuse for their rash actions and the massacre that followed. According to a Polish eyewitness of the event, who had been arrested and became part of a column of Polish captives under the German guard, Wehrmacht soldiers fired from a machine gun on the prisoners‚Äô column which caused panic among those trying to escape death. Resulting from this, the guards escorting the column began shooting wildly at them. In the shooting about 200 Polish and Jewish individuals died. The second part of the massacre took place in a different part of the city, after the first wild shootings had stopped. According to the testimony of Helena Szpilman before the Jewish Historical Committee, German soldiers rounded up Polish and Jewish civilians from their homes and forced them to march to the Magnacki Square, in front of the town's cathedral. There they were all forced to lie face down on the ground and told that anyone who moved would be shot. In all there were several thousand individuals including elderly, children and women. Lt. Col. Ube, who was in charge of the Wehrmacht units carrying out the massacre (and who was the author of the report to regimental command who blamed the shooting on \\"Polish partisans\\") estimated that around 10,000 people had been collected in the square. Similar estimates of the number of people rounded up are given by eyewitnesses and survivors. After separating the men from the women, the men were searched and any found with a shaving razor or a pocket knife were shot on the spot. The remaining men were told to enter the church, but as they began moving to do so German soldiers opened fire on them from machine guns and hand-held weapons. According to the testimony of Henoch Diamant, who was wounded in the shooting, several hundred people were killed on the spot and about 400 were wounded as a result. The unfolding of the massacre in front of the cathedral was captured in narrative form by a German photographer, from the initial round up, to the Poles and Jews awaiting their fate, to photos of corpses strewn across the city's streets and the cathedral square.Janina Struk, \\"Photographing the Holocaust: interpretations of the evidence\\", I.B.Tauris, 2004, pg. 63, This collection of photos was acquired by an American soldier from a captured German machine gunner near the end of the war. Death count According to the official report written by Lt. Col. Ube: in course of the \\"punishment action for partisan activity\\" 3 women and 96 men had been killed. However, in the spring of 1940, the German mayor of Czestochowa, Richard Wendler, gave permission for the exhumation of the bodies by the town council. Some 227 corpses were unearthed, including 194 men, 25 women, and 8 children; 22 victims were identified as Jewish. The bodies were exhumed in several locations including at Krakowska Street (54), at Garncarska (40), by the city hall (48), and at Piotrkowska Street (4). There were also several smaller scale murders carried out at various points in the city, including of patients at a military hospital which was run by the Red Cross. According to the Center for Documentation of Czƒôstochowa History, at least 600 people were killed in the city overall on that day. Some estimates of victims put the number at more than 1,000; 990 ethnic Poles and 110 JewsMuzeum Historii Zydow Polskich (Museum of the History of Polish Jews), Virtual Sztetl, \\"Tablica pamiƒÖtkowa (ul.

Once again, unknown shots were fired at the regiment (again most likely due to friendly fire) which caused nervous soldiers to begin shooting wildly. \\"They blindly shot up the houses\\", according to eyewitnesses, and then ordered all men of the village to gather in an open field. There, those that complied with the order were executed. In all 72 victims of the Kajetanowice massacre were identified (one-third of the village's inhabitants),Yad ·πøa-shem, rashut ha- zikaron la-Sho ºah ·πøela-gevurah, Yad Vashem studies, Volume 35, Part 2\\", Wallstein Verlag, 2007, pg. 196. including an infant, five little children, fourteen teenagers, twelve women and six elderly persons. One of the soldiers involved in the action told eyewitness Wiktoria Czech that he knew the villagers were innocent but that the regiment had received orders to kill all civilians. Another soldier commented that \\"Poles should be murdered when they‚Äôre still in the crib\\". Subsequently, the entire village was burned to the ground. The \\"losses\\" of the German units of the 42nd regiment in Kajetanowice consisted of two dead horses, both most likely shot by friendly fire. The official report of the unit stated that the massacre and burning of the village was carried out as revenge for the shooting of two German horses. Postwar investigations An investigation of the massacre was carried out in Bayreuth, Germany, in 1985, regarding former soldiers of the 42nd Infantry Regiment. Most of them still claimed to have been shot at from nearby houses prior to the massacre but none could describe the supposed attackers. One former soldier even admitted that he had no idea if the supposed attackers were \\"soldiers, partisans or civilians\\". Several former soldiers admitted that a general panic had broken out among German troops, with everyone running to get their weapons, stumbling over each other and shooting wildly. One of the officers of the regiment recalled that he had been furious at his soldiers for their complete lack of discipline. Former soldiers of the unit also admitted that in the search that followed they did not find any weapons, or for that matter, able bodied men, only a few women with children and some elderly persons. Former soldier Hans M. stated \\"I never saw any partisans in Czƒôstochowa with my own eyes\\". In regard to the second massacre near the cathedral, former Wehrmacht soldier Fritz S. in an initial statement claimed that after the wild shooting stopped he was ordered to politely ask the civilians to leave their houses and gather in a church. However, Fritz S. voluntarily returned to the investigators several days later and changed his statement. He stated that the order was to forcible remove civilians form their homes and line them up face down on the ground. He added that \\"I want to emphasize that I never politely asked any civilians to leave their homes. In fact, we threw them out\\". The massacre was also investigated by the Jewish Historical Committee and Czestochowa's government. In 2009, the Polish Institute of National Remembrance found mass graves near the Stradom railway station containing about 2000 corpses, although it is unclear at this stage if the bodies are related to this massacre or to later killings by the Nazis.\\"IPN znalaz≈Ç masowe groby w Czƒôstochowie\\" (IPN found mass graves in Czestochowa), Gazeta Wyborcza/Czestochowa, 2009-07-07, Also in 2009, the diaries of Boles≈Çaw Kurkowski were discovered.

Working collaboratively with relevant national and local authorities in the Emirates, the CAA has a key leadership role in securing and developing the quality of higher education in the UAE. As a matter of the highest priority, it sets out to safeguard academic standards, and to assure and enhance the quality of learning opportunities provided for students in UAE‚Äôs higher education institutions (HEIs). It undertakes licensure of HEIs in the UAE and accreditation of their award-bearing academic programs. In order to be entered in the National Register and receive Federal Recognition any HEIs offering post-secondary education in the UAE must receive institutional licensure and accreditation of their degree, diploma and certificate programs that are of at least one-year study duration. CAA accreditation incorporates recognition of Diploma (Associate Degree), Higher Diploma (Advanced Diploma) Bachelor Degree, Postgraduate Diploma and Certificate, Master Degree and Doctorate Degree. These Degree ranges from level 5-10 as per National Qualification Framework of UAE (NQF UAE).  Mission and strategic aims  The Mission of the CAA is: ‚ÄúThe CAA is the Federal Government's Quality Assurance Agency charged with promoting educational excellence across diverse institutions of higher learning in the UAE. Through licensure of post-secondary educational institutions, and accreditation of individual programs, the CAA.Commission for Academic Accreditation, Abu Dhabi Government Portal , UAE. strives to assure high quality education, consistent with international standards‚Äù.  Goals  Ensuring Quality and Academic Standards: Maintain and implement a quality framework which assures that institutions of higher education in the UAE operate in line with international academic, administrative, managerial, and operational standards. Diversifying Services: Offer a broad range of appropriate services and activities that further enhances quality. Ensuring an Effective Operation: Deliver efficient and effective quality-enhancing processes for a strongly developing higher education sector. International Profile: Play an active, cooperative and influential role in the international community of quality assurance organizations for higher education.  Commission structure  The CAA is associated with the UAE Federal Government‚Äôs Ministry of EducationStandards for Licensure and Accreditation, Commission for Academic Accreditation, Ministry of Higher Education, United Arab Emirates. Fourth Edition, 2007. (MoE) and is based in the UAE‚Äôs capital city, Abu Dhabi. Its jurisdiction includes all seven of the Emirates of the UAE and overseas campuses of UAE-based higher education institutions. The CAA has number of Commissioners in various fields including business, engineering, sciences, law, health sciences, humanities and arts. Its senior committee is the Council of Commissioners, composed of the Executive Director and all Commissioners. The Council meets at least once a month, and approves all accreditation actions related to HEIs. The CAA is supported by administration staff executives, who are taking care of quality, archiving and logistics. A Strategic Advisory Committee consists of members of representative stakeholder groups in higher education in the UAE. The CAA provides strategic academic advisory support to senior leadership of MoE on academic mattes.  History  Originally established in 1999 an associated with Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research for the purpose of assuring that private HEIs and programs meet international quality standards, the scope of the CAA‚Äôs activities was broadened in 2012 to include licensure and accreditation of all HEIs in the country including governmental HEIs. Additional to its licensure and accreditation activities, the Commission has responsibility for approval of substantive changes to HEIs and their programs and undertakes academic audits of HEI activities. It also investigates concerns about higher education provision and provides advice, support and development opportunities for HEIs in line with its Mission.  International relations  The Commission is a member of relevant organizations such as the Arab Network for Quality Assurance in Higher Education (ANQAHE) and the International Network for Quality Assurance Agencies in Higher Education (INQAAHE), and it is recognized by the World Federation for Medical Education (WFME). The Commission has established memoranda of understanding for cooperation with various international accreditation agencies such as the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business International (AACSB), and the Accreditation Council for Pharmacy Education (ACPE).  Institutional licensure and program accreditation  Institutional licensure and program accreditation are core activities of the CAA. Licensed institutions must demonstrate adherence to standards of performance covering all activities across the institution, follow principles of continuous improvement, and provide evidence of achieving student-learning outcomes. HEIs obtain licensure and program accreditation through submission of an application and supporting documentation to the CAA, which is normally followed by site visits by a Commissioner and a visiting committee of experienced academics (the External Review Team) with appropriate international expertise. The External Review Team reviews institutions and their programs against the expectations of the CAA StandardsCAA Standards, UAE for Institutional Licensure and Program Accreditation and can place requirements upon the institutions that they must meet in order to be recommended to the CAA Council of Commissioners for institutional licensure and program accreditation. The Standards are differentially applied in the consideration of applications for licensure or for program accreditation.  Risk Based Evaluation  The CAA depending on reviews and site visit plus data submitted by institution determines the risk and identifies institution as high confidence (low risk) medium confidence (medium risk) and low confidence (high risk).  Institutional Licensure  Initial licensure is granted for up to three years. It signifies that the institution has a mission appropriate to higher education and possesses the governance structure, by- laws, regulations, policies and procedures, physical and financial resources, educational programs, faculty and other personnel, and quality assurance measures sufficient to accomplish its mission. Renewal of licensure may be granted for a period of three, five or seven years according to a risk-based assessment of the institution.  Program Accreditation  Initial program accreditation is designed to ensure that a fully developed curriculum and support services are in place. The External Review Team evaluates the program‚Äôs structure and its constituent courses, and their requirements for specialist faculty and appropriate teaching and learning resources. Initial program accreditation is granted until program graduates its first cohort. Renewal of program accreditation is undertaken after a program has graduated its first cohort of students. An External Review Team evaluates whether the program‚Äòs anticipated outcomes are being achieved, including the maintenance of academic standards in keeping with international norms, and the nature of the student experience. The periodicity of renewal of accreditation follows the same three, five, or seven year cycle as that determined during risk analysis at renewal of institutional licensure.  Audits  The CAA undertakes periodic audits of HEI activities. It also investigates concerns about higher education provision and provides advice, support and development opportunities for HEIs in line with its Mission. The Standards are supported by a comprehensive set of guidance documents that include procedural manuals for initial and renewal of licensure, initial and renewal of accreditation, a guide for External Review Teams, guidance on the QFEmiratesQFEmirates Level Descriptors, National Qualifications Authority (NQA) website (the UAE National Qualifications Framework), and a volume of supplementary guidance to the Standards.  Standards for institutional licensure and program accreditation  The CAA Standards for Institutional Licensure and Program Accreditation are designed to promote high quality institutions and to assure prospective students, their families, employers, and other stakeholders that licensed institutions and their programs meet levels of quality consistent with current international practice and professional judgment. The CAA Standards for Institutional Licensure and Program Accreditation specify criterion-based institutional requirements which must be met by all HEIs operating in the UAE in order for them to be licensed and for their programs to be accredited. The CAA published its first Standards for Institutional Licensure and Program Accreditation in 2001. Subsequent revisions and expansions of the Standards included publication of the e-learning and Distance Learning Standards for Licensure and Accreditation in 2007 and the Standards for Licensure and Accreditation Technical and Vocational Education in 2009. The most recent (version 6; 2019) version of the Standards incorporates the e-learning standards and standards for technical and vocational education in a single, comprehensive document. The Standards are the following 11 standards: Standard 1: Governance and Management Standard 2: Quality Assurance Standard 3: Educational Programs Standard 4: Research and Scholarly Activities Standard 5: Faculty and Professional Staff Standard 6: Students Standard 7: Health, Safety and Environment Standard 8: Learning Resource Center Standard 9: Fiscal Resources, Financial Management and Budgeting Standard 10: Legal Compliance and Public Disclosure Standard 11: Community Engagement Institutional licensure: An institution‚Äôs compliance with Standards 1,2,4,7,9,10 and 11 is evaluated in determining institutional licensure. Program Accreditation: Compliance with Standards 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 8 is evaluated in determining program accreditation. All of the relevant Standards must be met in order to receive a recommendation for licensure or accreditation. The Standards each include statements of the threshold quality criteria to be met by institutions and their programs. These are supported by a more detailed listing of Stipulations which describe good academic practice and explain how each of the Standards can be met effectively, and by 23 Annexes that provide further detail and aid institutions in complying fully with the criteria of the Standards.

As a result, faced with a common enemy which threatened to eliminate both anti-communist Poles and independence-minded Ukrainians, the two previous enemies took the first steps towards reconciliation. (in Polish) As early as September 1944, the UPA commander in Eastern Galicia, Vasyl Sydor (Szelest), issued an order ending general anti-Polish actions in the region; from then on UPA units were only allowed to attack those Poles who served with the Soviets (although it took several months for the orders to reach individual commanders in the field).Biuletyn IPN, Nr 8, September 2001, pg. 32 In 1945 the AK issued a manifesto calling for an end to fighting between Poles and Ukrainians and for cooperation, printed it in 7,500 copies and distributed it in the surrounding villages. At the same time, the leadership of the UPA in the region made similar moves aimed at the same goal. After mediation by Catholic and Orthodox clergy, a meeting was arranged in Puszcza Solska (Solska Forest) between the commanders of both groups. The top commander on the Polish side was Marian Go≈Çƒôbiewski (Ster) and on the Ukrainian side Jurij Lopatynsky (Szejk). The two sides agreed to stop fighting one another, on each other's areas of influence, to come to each other's aid in case of being attacked by communist forces, to put an end to mutual attacks on civilian targets, to share intelligence reports and to coordinate actions against communist agents and common bandit groups which plagued the area. According to some former soldiers of the unit, the agreement was in part due to pressure on the partisans that came from the local civilian population, which was sick of the fighting between the two groups. In September 1945, the agreement was extended to include the Podlaskie and Che≈Çm regions. Planning In April 1946, the first joint action was carried out: an attack on the rail station in Werbkowice. In May 1946, a meeting took place in the village of Miƒôtkie, between the Lublin region commanders of the two groups; the Poles were represented by Wac≈Çaw DƒÖbrowski (Azja), the Ukrainians by Jewhen Sztendera (Pryrwa).Grzegorz RƒÖkowski, \\"Polska egzotyczna: przewodnik, Part 2\\", \\"Rewasz\\", 2006, pg. 246, An attack upon the town of Hrubiesz√≥w was proposed by the WiN soldiers and accepted by the UPA. The purpose of the attack was to free political prisoners from the local prison, to destroy documents held by the communist security forces, to destroy the headquarters of the Committee for Resettlement (which was in charge of deporting Ukrainians to the Soviet Union), and to destroy the precincts of the Polish secret police and the MO. Attack The attack on the town began at 11 pm on the night of 27 May 1946. One of the main commanders on the Polish side was Henryk Lewczuk (Hammer), who later was a delegate to the Polish Sejm between 2001 and 2005.Panstwowa Komisja Wyborcza (National Electoral Commission) Lewczuk led the best-armed Polish platoon in the attack, composed of 25 to 30 soldiers, all local volunteers (Lewczuk did not allow some of his soldiers from the Kresy region to participate in the attack, due to their deep-seated animosity to the UPA).Jerzy Mas≈Çowski, \\"Rozbicie PUBP w Hrubieszowie 28.05.1946\\", Official Webpage of Jerzy Mas≈Çowski, According to previously made plans, the partisans took control of the bridges and roads leading into Hrubiesz√≥w and then proceeded to the center, where their strategic objectives were located. There, as agreed, the UPA soldiers (around 300) assaulted the building of the Committee for Resettlement, while the Poles (around 150 soldiers) attacked the headquarters and prison of the communist secret police and the local office of the Polish Communist Party. The Resettlement Committee building, however, was heavily fortified and staffed with experienced and well-armed NKVD troops, and the UPA attack stalled. The Poles were more successful; using mine throwers they took the secret police building, freed about twenty prisoners and captured secret documents. After taking the party headquarters they also executed two high-ranking Communist officials. At dawn, the communist forces were supported by units of the Polish army that were stationed in the town. Quite likely, the regular army soldiers waited as long as they could before joining in the fighting, as WiN had infiltrated its ranks and had previously carried out an extensive anti- communist information campaign. Under attack by both the NKVD and regular army units, the UPA and the WiN soldiers began to withdraw. While fire fights and skirmishes occurred during the withdrawal between the partisans and the NKVD, the Polish soldiers mostly confined themselves to just following the partisans in their vehicles, without engaging them in direct fighting. One of the soldiers among the army units happened to be Wojciech Jaruzelski, the future communist leader of Poland, who declared martial law in 1981.Piotr G≈Çuchowski, Marcin Kowalski, \\"Jaruzelski: d≈Çuga lekcja nowomowy\\" (Jaruzelski: A long lesson in Newspeak), Gazeta Wyborcza, 2008-12-12, Jaruzelski's official website, in the \\"Diariusz\\" (Diary) section, states that from the fall of 1945 until 1946, Jaruzelski took part in \\"fighting bandits of the armed underground and Ukrainian nationalist\\" in order to \\"defend the Polishness of Hrubieszow Land\\".Diariusz, Oficjalna Strona Gen. Jaruzelskiego (Official Website of Gen. Jaruzelski),[\\"http://www.wojciech-jaruzelski.pl/main.php?dzial=2‚äÇ=3] During the fighting, one of WiN's freed prisoners was accidentally killed by friendly fire and the commander of UPA was wounded. The Ukrainians lost two more men during the withdrawal. The Polish communists and Soviets lost from nine to fifteen men. Afterward In the end, the action was partly successful. Documents of the secret police were captured, though not those of the Resettlement Commission. However, by the end of 1946, the contacts between the two groups tapered off. The main initial reason for this was the negative attitude of the Polish underground's high command and of the Polish emigre government, the \\"Delegatura\\", towards close cooperation with the UPA. The high command issued an order to forbid any further contacts with the UPA, although local contacts continued until at least the end of 1946. One small UPA unit, led by Jan Niewiadomski (Jurka), kept up contacts with the Polish underground until 1948. By the spring of 1947, however, most of the organized resistance, both Polish and Ukrainian, in the region had collapsed or significantly diminished. By this time, most Ukrainian civilians had been deported and resettled, either back to the Soviet Union or to other parts of Poland and as a result the UPA lost its base of support. Many Polish partisans came out of the underground during the Amnesty of 1947 and were subsequently arrested and persecuted, despite previous promises to the contraryTadeusz Piotrowski, \\"Poland's holocaust: ethnic strife, collaboration with occupying forces and genocide in the Second Republic, 1918-1947\\", McFarland, 1998, pg. 104, (the amnesty did not cover UPA soldiersPhilipp Ther, Ana Siljak, \\"Redrawing nations: ethnic cleansing in East-Central Europe, 1944-1948\\", Rowman & Littlefield, 2001, pg. 182, ).

Therefore, it is also known as the Valencia Declaration. Considering that a major challenge for this new century is the effective and efficient realisation of human rights for all people, and that at the same time is needed that all members of the human family strive for its fulfillment, the DHDR formulates related duties and responsibilities for our current interdependence. Its preamble states categorically: The effective enjoyment and implementation of human rights and fundamental freedoms are inextricably linked to the assumption of the duties and responsibilities implicit in those rights..... After fifty years of the adoption of the UDHR and following human rights instruments, the point of departure of the DHDR Preamble is the shared concern regarding the lack of political will for enforcing globally human rights. Moreover, the DHDR takes into account the new challenges of the global scenario for translating semantically rights into duties and responsibilities. ‚ÄúRecognising the changes that new technologies, scientific development and the process of Mondialisation have brought about, and aware of the need to address their impact upon and potential consequences for human rights and fundamental freedoms‚Äú, states in its Preamble. Its 12 chapters and 41 articles can be compared with the human rights such as formulated in the UDHR and recent initiatives that reflect a similar preoccupation for the formulation of duties and responsibilities, such as the United Nations Millennium Declaration, the Statute of Rome, the Global Compact, The Earth Charter, the Kyoto Protocol, and UNESCO declarations and conventions. History The drafting of the declaration has been the result of the committed and disinterested work of a group of experts integrated by Nobel laureates - Joseph Rotblat, Wole Soyinka and Dario Fo -, scientists, artists and philosophers representing all the regions of the world ‚Äìamong them, Federico Mayor Zaragoza, Richard Falk, Ruud Lubbers, Lord Frank Judd, Sergey Kapitsa, Jakob von Uexk√ºll, Fernando Savater-, and the judicious chairmanship of Richard Goldstone from South Africa. This process was inspired by the need ‚Äìin words of Justice Goldstone- of the transition from a ‚Äúformal equality‚Äù to a ‚Äúsubstantial equality, with a shared concern of the situation of millions of ignored and marginalised people in our globalised world: ‚Äúthe recognition of human rights is insufficient, ‚Ä¶ if such so rights are to be realized it is necessary that they are enforceable... There must be a duty on all relevant authorities and individuals to enforce those rights.‚Äù With a convergent perspective, Norberto Bobbio has entirely supported the initiative and the text of the DHDR, in particular taking into account the main concern for humanity of reinforcing the international systems. In that context, he has established an interesting comparison between the transition from ‚Äúmoral rights‚Äù to ‚Äúlegal rights‚Äù and the need to transform ‚Äúmoral duties‚Äù into ‚Äúlegal duties‚Äù (See: Norberto Bobbio, Declaration of Human Duties and Responsibilities, page 98). This Declaration proposes comprehensively the implicit system of duties and responsibilities contained in our human rights systems, in particular, that enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) and in subsequent international human rights instruments and establishes consequently their bearers. DHDR Chapter I: The General Provisions In DHDR Article 1 ‚Äúduty‚Äù and ‚Äúresponsibility‚Äù are defined for the purpose of the declaration: \\"duty\\" means an ethical or moral obligation; and \\"responsibility\\", an obligation that is legally binding under existing international law. The DHDR explains in details the complexity of the exercise of responsibilities. The bearers are the members of the global community that have collective, as well as individual duties and responsibilities, to promote universal observance of human rights and fundamental freedoms. ‚ÄúGlobal community\\" means both States and non-States actors: international, regional and sub-regional intergovernmental organisations, non-governmental organisations, public and private sector (trans)national corporations, other entities of civil society, peoples, communities, and individuals taken collectively. The DHDR reflects the gamut of both states and non-states actors that have to be mutually supportive bearers of duties and responsibilities. On the contrary, the UN Millennium Declaration (MD), a recent international document addressed to the governments, is focused primarily on the States responsibilities that are shared and collective: ‚ÄúWe /heads of State and Government / recognize that, in addition to our separate responsibilities to our individual societies, we have a collective responsibility to uphold the principles of human dignity, equality, and equity at the global level. As leaders we have a duty therefore to all the world‚Äôs people‚Ä¶‚Äù DHDR Article 2 is dedicated to postulate exhaustively the bearers of duties and responsibilities: ‚ÄúMembers of the global community have collective, as well as individual duties and responsibilities, to promote universal respect for and observance of human rights and fundamental freedoms.‚Ä¶‚Äù This declaration considers the existence of collective responsibilities inside the limits traced by the universally recognized rights, with the implicit consequences of accountability that would be fairly distributed. The DHDR addresses simultaneously the responsibilities of individuals and groups. It states: ‚ÄúAs the holders of human rights and fundamental freedoms, all individuals, peoples, and communities in the exercise of their rights and freedoms, have the duty and responsibility to respect those of others, and a duty to strive for the promotion and observance thereof‚Äù. This statement continues appropriately the way initiated by the UDHR in Article 29 and reiterates the interaction of duties, responsibilities, and rights of the International Covenants on Human Rights of 1966. DHDR Chapter 2: The right to life and human security Most of the titles of the DHDR chapters enunciate a right or fundamental freedom that will be the thematic focus of the related duties and responsibilities. Chapter 2 begins the list of duties and responsibilities with the right to life and human security, rights to be secure for the present and also future generations in the awareness that for the first time in human history the humankind survival is in peril due to human action. Following the UDHR Article 3 ‚ÄúEveryone has the right to life, liberty, and security of person‚Äù; this chapter draws our attention to the intergenerational responsibility. DHDR Article 3 is dedicated to the duty and responsibility to protect the life of every member of the human family and ensure the survival of both present and future generations. That means ‚Äúto take reasonable steps to help others whose lives are threatened, or who are in extreme distress or need‚Äù. A key element of the formulation of the DHDR has been the present duty and responsibility for the potential consequences of our actions for the future generations. ‚ÄúThe rights of these future generations are the duties of present generations‚Äù summarises Federico Mayor, the then Director General of UNESCO. Therefore, the right to peace and the right to live in a balanced ecological environment have to be recognized and guaranteed. In a broader sense, the Earth Charter, a declaration of principles for a sustainable world, emphasises the urgency of sharing responsibility for caring for the community of life, including the well-being of the human family. DHDR Article 4 enunciates the duty and responsibility to promote collective security and a culture of peace of all members of the global community. War and conflict prevention, fostering international peace, global security and cooperation are needed for this purpose. The responsibility of States, according to UN Chapter 7, is underlined and also their duty strengthening mediation, conflict prevention, and post-conflict peace-building mechanisms and peace-keeping capacities. DHDR Article 5 is dedicated to the duty and responsibility to promote rapid and effective disarmament in the interests of peace. Primarily the States are in charge of reducing military expenditure in favour of human development, and together with no-States actors to carry our nuclear disarmament, to cease any production or use of all chemical and biological weapons, and use of landmines. The Duty to intervene to prevent gross human rights violations is stated in the DHDR Article 6 that means the commission of genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes and other gross or systematic human rights abuses in all circumstances. States are mainly in charge of preventing and also punishing such violations, and there is also a collective duty of the States to intervene in the case where individual State fails to prevent such abuses. UN Chapter 7 remains general framework for this responsibility. For defining gross human rights violations and the need of prevention and punishment this chapter has been inspired by the Rome Statute that was adopted some months before this Declaration was finalised. DHDR Article 7 enunciates the duty and responsibility unconditionally and in all circumstances to respect international humanitarian law during times of armed conflict. This law, obligates government forces, insurgents, and military or paramilitary forces, to refrain from committing acts of genocide; crimes against humanity, and war crimes, as mass killing, torture or rape. The focus of DHDR Article 8 is the duty and responsibility of humanitarian assistance and intervention to those in need. In a globalised world with millions of displaced people, it is claimed for the adequate provision of food, shelter, health care and other essential requirements for survival to ensure the right to life for everyone in the world. DHDR Article 9 finishes this chapter with the duty and responsibility to protect and promote a safe, stable and healthy environment, promoting respect, protection and preservation of the uniqueness and diversity of all forms of life. An adequate use of resources avoiding excessive exploitation and consumption, collaborative scientific research and exchange of information are required. This article is similar to the Kyoto Protocol, an international and legally binding agreement to reduce greenhouse gases emissions worldwide, an urgent change of attitude towards the environment. This duty for the present and future generations has already been confirmed by a broad scientific consensus on the existence of climate change and human responsibility. DHDR Chapter 3: Human security and an equitable international order DHDR Article 10 emphasises the duty and responsibility to promote an equitable international order for the universal enjoyment of sustainable human, economic, social, cultural, political, scientific and technological development and equitable participation in the decision-making processes for an interdependent and technologically well equipped world, providing an extensive vision of the general formulation of the UDHR Article 28: ‚ÄúEveryone is entitled to a social and international order in which the rights and freedoms set forth in this Declaration can be fully realized‚Äù. The DHDR statements are categorical: ‚ÄúEconomic policies and development should not be pursued at the expense of human rights or social development‚Äù (6), ‚ÄúEconomic and social development shall not be pursued at the expense of the environment and natural resources‚Äù (7), and ‚ÄúAs sovereign and equal members of the international community, all States have the right to participate fully, equitably and effectively in international and global institutions and decision-making processes‚Ä¶(8)‚Äù Coincidentally to the DHDR proposals, the ‚Äúmillennium development goals‚Äù of the MD set an agenda for a global partnership to fight poverty and establishing shared goals for a better world by 2015. Their fulfillment is measurable by progress at a quantitative level. Following the previous article, DHDR Article 11 enunciates the duty to alleviate usurious debt that would endanger human lives and impede economic and social development. This Chapter continues with DHDR Article 12 dedicated to the duty and responsibility to promote safe, responsible and equitable scientific and technological development for the benefit of all humankind. The UNESCO spirit of encouraging universally intellectual and moral solidarity is emphasised, in particular taking into account the condition of the lesser scientifically advanced States. This DHDR approach reinforces fully the importance of the recent UNESCO ethical documents for biosciences, and also other efforts for codifying ethical principles for the use of science. DHDR Article 13 enunciates duties and responsibilities of public and private sector corporations, indicating as common criteria the respect for the sovereignty of host countries and simultaneously fully respect and promotion of universal human rights and international labour standards. For having an ethical code of the corporations and for promoting a more sustainable and inclusive global economy, the then UN General Secretary, Kofi Annan, has proposed the Global Compact, an international initiative bringing companies together with UN agencies, labour and civil society to support universal environmental and social principles, that was finally launched in 2000. DHDR Article 14 enunciates the duty and responsibility to prevent and punish international and organised crime as a shared task of the members of the global community. This article also has the innovative approach of global cooperation of the Statute of Rome, for combating of international crimes, transnational crimes and organised crime and assisting international criminal tribunals. The focus of DHDR Article 15 is the duty and responsibility to eradicate corruption and build an ethical society in both the public and private sectors, implementing codes of conduct and training programmes, and promoting accountability, transparency public awareness of the harm caused by corruption. This emphasis of a code of ethics was also encouraged by the Global Compact, in particular for the private sector. DHDR Chapter 4: Meaningful participation in public affairs DHDR Article 16 expresses the duty and responsibility to ensure meaningful participation in public affairs, for ensuring that the authority of government is based upon the will of the people and the rule of law. This promoted participation reiterates the universal right to take part in the government of his country, directly or through freely chosen representatives of the UDHR Article 21 at different levels, in local, national and global governance. DHDR Chapter 5: Freedom of opinion, expression, assembly, association and religion Following the content of the UDHR Article 16 on the right to freedom of opinion and expression, DHDR Article 17 reformulates the duty and responsibility to respect and ensure freedom of opinion, expression, and the media, providing concrete measures for the world today, affirming the pursuit of truth as unhindered, and condemning any degrading treatment of individuals and the presentation of violence as entertainment. And Article 17 also insists that \\"the media and journalists have a duty to report honestly and accurately to avoid incitement of racial, ethnic or religious violence or hatred. (see: Article 20 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights) DHDR Article 18 establishes duties and responsibilities concerning information and communications technologies with the aim of ensuring universal access to basic communication and information infrastructure and services. Similarly, UNESCO has already made a recommendation on information promoting universal access to cyberspace. DHDR Article 19 enunciates the duty and responsibility to take all necessary steps to ensure the substantive realisation of the rights to free assembly and freedom of association. Finally, DHDR Article 20 formulates the related duty and responsibility to respect and ensure freedom of religion, belief and conscience, and of having or not having a religion or belief. DHDR Chapter 6: The right to personal and physical integrity DHDR Article 21 is focused on formulating the duty and responsibility to respect and ensure the physical, psychological and personal integrity of all members of the human family in all circumstances, including in situations of armed conflict, reformulating UDHR articles 10-12 dedicated to the rights to personal integrity and respect for privacy. DHDR Article 22 enunciates the duty and responsibility to take all necessary measures to respect and ensure the right to personal liberty and physical security, primarily by the States, preventing arbitrary arrest and detention and ensuring that all arrests and detentions are carried out in accordance with universally recognised standards of fairness and due process. DHDR Article 23 emphasises the duty and responsibility to prohibit and prevent slavery and institutions and practices similar to slavery and slave-like practices including child prostitution, child exploitation, enforced prostitution, debt bondage, serfdom, and other forms of enforced labour inconsistent with international law, punishing such practices; instituting effective controls to prevent the illegal trafficking of persons; creating greater public awareness through education of the human rights abuses associated with such practices. The UDHR Article 4 states that ‚Äúno one shall be held in slavery or servitude; slavery and the slave trade shall be prohibited in all their forms‚Äù. Today slavery is still not eradicated from the world, although universally condemned. DHDR Article 24 enunciates the duty and responsibility to condemn torture and to take all necessary measures to prevent torture, cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment, declaring criminal and punishing all acts of torture, cruel and inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment, enforcing strict controls over places and conditions of custody of persons deprived of their liberty. This enunciation specifies the duty for achieving the content of UDHR Article 5: ‚ÄúNo one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment‚Äù. DHDR Article 25: The duty and responsibility to condemn and to prevent and eradicate enforced disappearances declaring criminal and punishing all acts of forced disappearances, ensuring that persons deprived of their liberty are only held in officially recognised places of detention, and that they have adequate access to judicial officers, legal representation, medical personnel and family members during the course of their detention. DHDR Chapter 7: Equality After trying to meet the major global challenges of our interdependent world that are affecting today humankind as a whole, DHDR Chapter 7 rethinks the principle of equality, such as stated in the first UDHR articles. Using a similar approach, UNESCO has already approved two meaningful documents promoting cultural diversity, the UNESCO Universal Declaration on Cultural Diversity (2001) and the Convention on the Protection and Promotion of the Diversity of Cultural Expressions (2005). DHDR Article 26 enunciates in general the duty to respect, ensure and promote the right to equal treatment and to eradicate discrimination in all its forms. DHDR Article 27 states the duty and responsibility for the States, primarily, to respect and ensure the substantive equality of every member of the human family, not only ensuring equality before the law, but also taking positive action to prevent direct or indirect discrimination. DHDR Article 28 enunciates the duty and responsibility to ensure substantive racial and religious equality. That means ensuring the effective enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms without discrimination on the basis of race, religion or ethnicity, and to condemn all forms of racial and religious discrimination and respect racial, ethnic and religious diversity; promoting equal opportunities for all. DHDR Article 29 formulates the duty and responsibility to ensure sex and gender equality and the recognition of women's rights as human rights. In particular the States have to ensure the effective enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms without discrimination on the basis of sex or gender, promoting the equality in the representation and participation of women in the public and political life, the eradication of cultural, religious and social practices which discriminate against women; the economic empowerment of women and the recognition of the full legal capacity of women. DHDR Article 30 is dedicated to the duty and responsibility to ensure the substantive equality of persons with a disability, and to ensure the enjoyment and exercise of all human rights and fundamental freedoms without discrimination on the basis of disability. Some progress towards the accomplishment of this duty can be observed at international level. In March 2006, the UN Programme on Disability has been consolidated into the Secretariat for the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. DHDR Chapter 8: Protection of minorities and indigenous peoples Reinforcing the fulfillment of equality, the aim of Chapter 8 is to emphasise the need for protection of minorities and indigenous peoples. Both the global community and the States are considered by this Declaration as the major responsible parties, collectively and individually for ensuring the rights of these vulnerable groups. DHDR Article 31 formulates the duty and responsibility to respect and protect the existence, identity and rights of national, ethnic, religious and linguistic minorities, giving the States a primary duty and responsibility to take adequate measures. The above referred efforts of the UNESCO for protecting the value of cultural diversity and cultural expressions are a reflection of this obligation. DHDR Article 32 enunciates the duty and responsibility to respect, protect and promote the rights of indigenous peoples, in particular, their right to preserve, maintain and develop their identities and to protect their means of livelihood, in a general context of respect of universal human rights. Indigenous rights should be protected at a national level, but it is also needed that the international community collectively assumes their responsibility. The Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples was approved in September 2007 by the UN General Assembly in order to protect these rights universally. DHDR Chapter 9: Rights of the child and the elderly Chapter 9 deals also with the implementation of the principle of equality taking into account the primary responsibilities of the States for children and elderly rights. DHDR Article 33 emphasises the duty and responsibility to respect, protect and promote the rights of the child, following the content of the almost universally ratified UN Convention on the Right of the Child (1989) and aware, that although this document is shared broadly by the international community, today millions of children are still innocent victims of armed conflict, extreme poverty and hunger. DHDR Article 34 is dedicated to the formulation of the duty and responsibility to promote and enforce the rights and well-being of the elderly, trying to ensure the full and effective enjoyment by elderly people of all human rights and fundamental freedoms without discrimination on the basis of age, and to respect the well-being, dignity and physical and personal integrity of the elderly. Although major efforts are being made by the United Nations, such as the International Year of Older Persons (1999) and the formulation of UN Principles addressing the independence, participation, care, self-fulfillment and dignity of older persons, and by regional and national efforts, there does not yet exist a recognised framework for securing their rights. Therefore, the DHDR contributes to enforcing the rights of the elderly. DHDR Chapter 10: Work, quality of life and standard of living DHDR Chapter 10 complements the system of duties and responsibilities related to the right to work, quality of life and standard of living. To do that, the DHDR takes into account at the same time, the responsibility of the States and the shared responsibility of the world community in the context of the global interdependence. DHDR Article 35 formulates the duty and responsibility to promote the right to justly remunerated work, following the statement of UDHR Article 23. Measures are proposed by the DHDR such as adopting policies designed to promote productive work, ensuring employment security - in particular, protection against arbitrary or unfair dismissal - and ensuring equality of opportunity and conditions of work. DHDR Article 36 emphasises the duty and responsibility to promote quality of life and an adequate standard of living for all. Although in the UDHR Article 22 it states the States obligation of fulfilling ‚Äúthe economic, social and cultural rights indispensable for his dignity and the free development of his personality‚Äù, today our interdependent world is not free from hunger and there is not universal access to adequate food and clean water for everyone. The DHDR reiterates the shared responsibility for eradicating extreme poverty from the world, in particular if we consider the sufficiency of material resources for meeting this challenge. Similarly, but with a more pragmatic approach, the Millennium Development Goals (2000) establishes an intergovernmental agreement for realising globally human rights. These transitional goals indicate a course for implementing human rights in a continuous process with measurable criteria. However, it would be positive to promote a dialogue on the achievement and evolution of the achievement of those goals with the help of this systematised view on universal duties and responsibilities. DHDR Chapter 11: Education, arts and culture DHDR Chapter 11 is dedicated to formulating duties and responsibilities on the promotion of education, arts and culture, major topics of the UNESCO, such as the programmes like ‚Äúeducation for all‚Äù and its various instruments for securing adequate conditions for education and artistic and cultural activities. DHDR Article 37 enunciates the duty and responsibility to promote and enforce the right to education, taking into account that illiteracy still affects millions of people in the developing countries This is coincident with the already referred Millennium Development Goals. DHDR Article 38 emphasises the duty and responsibility to foster arts and culture by the States and the global community in general, similar to the UNESCO statements. DHDR Chapter 12: Right to a remedy DHDR finishes with Chapter 12 dedicated to the right to a remedy where a human right or fundamental freedom is threatened or has been violated. The DHDR Article 39 enunciates the duty and responsibility, primarily of the States, to provide for and enforce effective national judicial, administrative, legislative and other remedies for these cases, in similarity with the UDHR Article 8. This Chapter proposes in article 40 the duty to monitor and implement the Declaration of Human Duties and Responsibilities, by establishing tripartite councils composed of State, civil society and private sector representatives in cooperation with States, relevant civil society organisations, national, regional and international inter-governmental organisations. The DHDR Article 41 contains a non- derogation clause where it states: ‚ÄúNothing in this Declaration shall be interpreted as impairing or restricting the rights contained in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other international and regional human rights instruments.‚Äù See also *Universal Declaration of Human Rights *Responsibility to Protect *International human rights instruments *International human rights law *Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action *Freedom of speech *See: Declaration of Human Duties and Responsibilities, Valencia 2000, Fundaci√≥n Valencia Tercer Milenio  External links  *Spanish version * English version (2002) Declaration of Human Duties and Responsibilities, Fundaci√≥n Valencia Tercer Milenio UNESCO Category:Human rights instruments ","title":"Declaration of Human Duties and Responsibilities"},{"id":"24931982","text":"The Happy People is a live album by the Cannonball Adderley Quintet, a band led by jazz saxophonist Julian \\"Cannonball\\" Adderley.

Terrorizer Early life Kevin Tucker grew up in suburban St. Louis, Missouri, surrounded by protests against local corporations such as Monsanto. He became involved in anarchism and hardcore punk around the same time and at age twelve started working on causes ranging from animal rights to Shell Oil's incursions upon Nigerian tribal lands. Simultaneously, he became an anarcho- syndicalist, straight edge and vegan. Between 1998 and 2000, he switched his approach from anarcho-syndicalism to anarcho-primitivism. From 2000-2002, he worked at an animal sanctuary which contributed to him abandoning veganism. He studied anthropology at the University of Pittsburgh, graduating in 2004. Views Kevin Tucker is an anarcho-primitivist. His primary contributions to this ideology have been the expansion of anthropological understanding, focusing on the importance of spirituality and domestication, a deep critique of revolution, and the act of rewilding.See Species Traitor and Green Anarchy magazines. A common theme among Tucker's writings have been the consequences of domestication and sedentism among nomadic gather-hunters. The central argument being that human nature has been shaped by evolution in accordance with wildness, what Tucker calls \\"primal anarchy\\".'Forest Beyond the Field', Species Traitor No. 4. Black and Green Press, 2005. That \\"primal anarchy\\" is exemplified by nomadic gatherer-hunter life. By focusing on the changes brought about by various levels of domestication one can see the impacts of domestication and ultimately civilization.Catalyst: Birth and Death of Civilization, work-in-progress Tucker has written extensively regarding the impacts and plausibility of revolution.Revolution and/or Insurrection, Species Traitor No. 3. Black and Green Press, 2003 and 'Message and the Messenger', 'Species Traitor No. 4'. Black and Green Press, 2005. Concluding that revolution will always be political in nature and therefore has no relevance to the destruction of civilization or further aid in its collapse. Focus has instead been turned towards what Tucker calls 'Primal War':Species Traitor No. 4. Black and Green Press, 2005, this is also the theme of a number of essays published in Green Anarchy magazine a notion based on rewilding and undermining domestication rather than hope for liberation through a historical event. Tucker is a colleague of fellow anarcho-primitivist John Zerzan and the two have engaged on multiple speaking tours focusing on the origins of civilization and the consequences of domestication. As of 2019, Tucker has openly spoken about moving on from the term \\"anarcho-primitivist\\" in lieu of \\"primal anarchy.\\" Stating: > It‚Äôs felt increasingly apparent that the name is a limitation, attaching > itself to two different lineages‚Äîanarchism and primitivism‚Äîneither of which > is necessarily fitting in its own right.

It consists of about 8 species of evergreen trees, from tropical northeastern Australia, New Caledonia, Africa and Asia. The exact number of species has been revised from 3 to 8, according to The Plant List.The Plant List Description All of the species have simple, smooth-edged, leathery leaves and much-branched panicles of small white flowers with recurving petals and conspicuous stamens. The fruits are small drupes with a fleshly appendage on one side attached to the fruit, termed a pseudoaril. The African species (Apodytes dimidiata) is grown for its attractive display of white blossom and red and black fruit, as well as for shade, screening and hedges. It is also grown in southern Africa for ornament and timber, and a bark preparation is used to drive out intestinal parasites. Cultivation It adapts readily to gardens in warm-temperate to tropical climates, though growth is not particularly fast and it can be kept to large shrub size. A deep fertile soil suits it best but it will grow in poorer soils. Propagate from fresh seed.

It selectively inhibits enzymes p38Œ±/Œ≤ mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), which are modulators of DUX4 expression and mediators of inflammation.  Potential treatment for FSHD  Fulcrum Therapeutics, a Massachusetts-based biotechnology company, identified p38Œ±/Œ≤ MAPK inhibitors as potent suppressors of DUX4 expression, the de-suppression of which is theorized to cause FSHD. Among p38Œ±/Œ≤ MAPK inhibitors, Fulcrum chose losmapimod as its preferred developmental candidate due to its \\"substantial and attractive preclinical and clinical data\\" from previous GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) clinical trials. As Fulcrum discovered the potential utility of p38 MAPK inhibition in treating FSHD, a Saint Louis University (SLU) research group independently arrived at the same conclusion. The SLU research group found that p38Œ± and p38Œ≤ isoforms independently contribute to DUX4 expression, which indicates potential gain in exploring isoform specific (p38Œ± or p38Œ≤) inhibition to balance therapeutic effects with side effects. A theoretical limitation of losmapimod is that p38 kinase inhibition could impair myogenesis, the opposite effect of what is desired. Facio Therapies, a Dutch pharmaceutical company with their own drug candidate for FSHD, announced that they had eliminated p38 kinase inhibitors (including losmapimod) as a developmental candidate because p38 kinase inhibitors resulted in impaired myotube formation on their drug development platform. Indeed, others have found that p38Œ± abrogation impairs myotube formation. However, Fulcrum found that p38 kinase inhibition did not impair myotube fusion at levels sufficient for DUX4 reduction.  Fulcrum development timeline  * April 2019: Fulcrum acquired from GSK the global rights to losmapimod. * October 2019: Fulcrum announced preliminary results of their phase 1 clinical trial of losmapimod. Oral dosing of losmapimod demonstrated sustained muscle tissue drug concentrations that in preclinical in vitro studies had shown effective in reducing DUX4 levels. * As of November 2019: Fulcrum is conducting two clinical trials of losmapimod for treatment of FSHD. One trial, ReDUX4, is evaluating drug efficacy in a randomized controlled phase IIb clinical trial. Originally planned to complete August 2020, it is now planned to complete first quarter of 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The second trial is a phase II open-label clinical trial in the Netherlands, with an estimated study completion date of January 2021. * January 2020: Fulcrum announced receiving orphan drug status for losmapimod. * June 2020, Fulcrum announced applying to the FDA to initiate a phase III clinical trial for losmapimod in treatment of COVID-19. Recent evidence indicates that p38 MAPK inhibition could be therapeutic, possibly by attenuating the exaggerated inflammatory response following SARS-CoV-2 infection.  Historical Investigations  Losmapimod was discovered and unsuccessfully developed by GSK for treating multiple medical conditions. Despite failing to prove efficacy, GSK clinical trials showed that losmapimod is generally well tolerated across more than 3,500 subjects. GSK investigated losmapimod as a therapeutic for patients post-myocardial infarction (heart attack). Despite phase II clinical trials the phase IIIA clinical trial (LATITUDE) failed to show significantly improved clinical outcomes. In October 2015 GSK announced cancelling the planned phase IIIB trial, but would \\"evaluate all options for future development.\\" GSK investigated losmapimod as a therapeutic for COPD, but multiple phase II clinical trials failed to show that losmapimod improves exercise tolerance, lung function, arterial inflammation, endothelial function, or rate of COPD exacerbations in subjects with COPD. GSK terminated development of losmapimod for COPD in 2016. GSK investigated losmapimod as a therapeutic for major depressive disorder (MDD) on the basis of depression being correlated with elevated pro-inflammatory cytokines. Phase II clinical trials failed to show a significant improvement in depression symptoms and biomarkers.

The Aborigines in Roman mythology are the oldest inhabitants of central Italy, connected in legendary history with Aeneas, Latinus and Evander. They were supposed to have descended from their mountain home near Reate (an ancient Sabine town) upon Latium, where they expelled the Siceli and subsequently settled down as Latini under a King Latinus.Dr. Leonhard Schmitz A History of Rome, From the Earliest Times to the Death of Commodus, A.D. 192. p.8-9Dionysius of Halicarnassus. Roman Antiquities, I.9. Etymology The most generally accepted etymology of the Latin word aborigines is that it derives from ', according to which they were the original inhabitants of the country, although Cato regarded them as Hellenic immigrants, not as a native Italian people.Marcus Porcius Cato. Origines, 5.6.7. Other etymological explanations suggested are ', meaning \\"tree-born,\\" and ', meaning \\"nomads\\". Lycophron calls a people of central Italy, '.Lycophron. Alexandra, 1253. Background The Aborigines were believed to have been descendants of the Pelasgians, the original inhabitants of Greece and surrounding regions.Barthold Georg Niebuhr Niebuhr's History of Rome, vol I note 47 Their earliest known home was Reate, an ancient Sabine town to the north-east of Latium near Carseoli. These Aborigines were driven from their mountain home by the Sabines and settled on the river Anio. The Sicels, who inhabited Latium at the time, gave way to the Aborigines, and a portion of them emigrated to Sicily, providing the origin for the island's name. The emigration of the Sicels to Sicily is said to have taken place in either 1264 BCDionysius of Halicarnassus Roman Antiquities I. 22 or 1035 BC (Thucydides). The remaining Siculians joined with the Aborigines eventually becoming the people known as Prisci Latini (meaning old Latins), that is Prisci et Latini, or simply Latini. The Aborigines did not become Latini until the reign of their king, Latinus, from whom the Romans attributed their name. This was after the arrival of the Trojans with Aeneas in the aftermath of the Trojan War.Dionysius of Halicarnassus Roman Antiquities I.9, 60 Cities The following list is based on Dionysius of Halicarnassus.Dionysius of Halicarnassus Roman Antiquities I.14, I.15William Smith Dictionary of Greek and Roman Geography (1854) * Palatium: 25 stades from Reate. * Tribula: 60 stades from Reate. * Suesbula: 60 stades from Tribula, near the Ceraunian Mountains. * Suna: 40 stades from Suesbula, with an ancient temple of Mars. * Mefula: about 30 stades from Suna (ruins with walls in Roman times). * Orvinium: 40 stades from Mefula.

A number of passenger transport executives (PTEs) have significant influence over transport planning in the area. Some issues were passed to the Network RUS, Electrification workstream. The RUS needs to be seen against existing contingent and prospective schemes, particularly in Control Period 4. Groups of gaps and issues The RUS identifies generic groups of gaps and issues * Peak crowding Overcrowding on peak time trains, especially into Leeds and Sheffield * Off-peak crowding Overcrowding between the peaks, possibly leading to suppression of demand * Engineering access Closure of routes for engineering access, possibly leading to suppression of demand * Regional links Connectivity within the RUS area, and between the RUS and external areas * Freight capability Lack of availability owing to inadequacy of diversionary routes, route availability, loading gauge and/or capacity * Reactionary delays Reactionary delays contributing to poor performance. A number of routes and services suffer from overcrowding of passengers in each usually 3-hour peak periods (mostly divided into a middle 'high' peak hour and two 'shoulder' peaks). In almost all cases these problems are foreseen, in the absence of interventions, to get worse owing to forecast growth in passenger traffic.

He is a police detective of the Baltimore Police Department. Born on October 14, 1968, Falsone was introduced as a long-time member of the Auto Squad at the end of Season 5, where his natural talents proved useful in solving vehicle-related crimes. However, when the department began a rotation program, in which detectives would be periodically reassigned to new units, Falsone was transferred to the homicide shift commanded by Al Giardello. After three months, Giardello expressed satisfaction with Falsone's work and requested that he remain with the unit. Falsone first appears in the Season 5 finale episodes \\"Partners and Other Strangers\\" and \\"Strangers and Other Partners,\\" then becomes a regular character in the Season 6 premiere \\"Blood Ties.\\" He and his partner, Det. Meldrick Lewis, are shot at by Junior Bunk on behalf of the crime organization run by Georgia Rae Mahoney. Falsone's investigation leads to a suspicion that the shooting of Georgia Rae's brother Luther (the original head of the organization) was not legitimate, a suspicion which ignites a long-standing enmity between Falsone and Mike Kellerman, the detective who shot Luther during the previous season.

Cotton was born in Balham, London and educated in Richmond. Afterwards he was articled to a firm of solicitors at Lincoln's Inn for a time, before focusing his interest on art and ornithology. In 1829 he became a Fellow of the Zoological Society of London. In 1835 he published privately The Resident Song Birds of Great Britain, with 17 colour plates and descriptive text, as well as The Song Birds of Great Britain, with 16 pages in colour. In 1843 Cotton migrated with his family (comprising his wife Susanna and nine children) to the Port Phillip District of New South Wales in Australia, now better known as the state of Victoria. Following his arrival in Melbourne he leased from the government two pastoral properties on the Goulburn River where he farmed sheep. In 1847 Susanna gave birth to their tenth child and sixth daughter. From 1844 Cotton was preparing sketches for a book to be named Birds of Port Phillip, as well as accumulating a collection of bird skins. However, circumstances were against him; John Gould's monumental illustrated handbook The Birds of Australia, issued in seven volumes from 1840 to 1848, was dominating the potential market for Cotton's intended publication, and there was little interest in, or appreciation for, his paintings. Moreover, he died in 1849, three days before his 48th birthday, his wife dying three years later, and his artwork remained unpublished, scattered among his descendants and largely lost to the world for the next 120 years. In 1974 a limited edition book, John Cotton's Birds of the Port Phillip District of New South Wales 1843-1849, authored by Allan McEvey was published, containing reproductions of some of the illustrations Cotton had prepared for the book that never eventuated. In it McEvey concludes his account of Cotton's life with: > \\"But apart from his historical position, apart from his records of value, he > was to have a continuing if indirect link with Australian ornithology > through the marriages of his children. A grandson-in-law, W.H.D. Le Souef > (1857‚Äì1923) was to be a founder of the Royal Australasian Ornithologists' > Union and its fourth President; another, Colonel Sir Charles Ryan > (1853‚Äì1926) was its third President; a grand-daughter, Mrs Ellis Rowan, was > to attain renown for her flower and bird painting; and a great-grand- > daughter, Maie Ryan, as Her Excellency the Lady Casey, was to declare open > the 67th R.A.O.U. Congress at Canberra in 1968, and now, at last, to achieve > for John Cotton the publication of these selected drawings from his Birds of > Port Phillip.

PPP was founded in 2001 by businessman Dean Debnam, the firm's current president and chief executive officer.\\"About Us\\" , Public Policy Polling, 2012. Retrieved on 6 December 2012. In addition to political issues, the company has polled the public on topics such as the approval rating of God, whether Republican voters believe President Obama would be eligible to enter heaven in the event of the Rapture, whether hipsters should be subjected to a special tax for being annoying, and whether Ted Cruz is the Zodiac Killer. Elections 2008 PPP first entered prominence through its performance in the 2008 Democratic primaries between Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. The company performed well, producing accurate predictions in states ranging from South Carolina to Wisconsin, many of which featured inaccurate results by other pollsters. After the November election, PPP was ranked by the Wall Street Journal as one of the two most accurate firms, among those who were most active in the presidential swing states. 2010 PPP was the first pollster to find Scott Brown with a lead over Martha Coakley in the Massachusetts Senate special election; Brown ultimately won in a major comeback, and PPP's final poll in that race predicted Brown's winning margin exactly. 2011 PPP was praised for its accuracy in polling primaries and special elections, which are notoriously hard to predict. The contests they accurately predicted include the West Virginia gubernatorial primaries, special elections in New York and California, as well as all eight Wisconsin recall elections. 2012 A study by Fordham University found that, of 28 firms studied, PPP had the most accurate poll on the presidential national popular vote, both its independently conducted poll and the one it does in collaboration with the Daily Kos and the SEIU. PPP correctly called the winner of the presidential election in all 19 states it polled in the final week of the election, as well as the winners of all the U.S. Senate and gubernatorial races it surveyed.  2014  Political research firm YouGov found PPP‚Äôs gubernatorial polls to have the lowest average margin of error among national firms that polled in at least five gubernatorial races in the month preceding the election.  2016  In the 2016 Presidential Election, PPP's final polls widely missed the mark in several key swing states, including New Hampshire, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin. Their polls also significantly underestimated President Trump's lead in Ohio, and incorrectly predicted Hillary Clinton to win Florida. Methodology The company's surveys use Interactive Voice Response (IVR), an automated questionnaire used by other polling firms such as SurveyUSA and Rasmussen Reports. The journalist Nate Cohn has criticized the company's methodology as being \\"unscientific\\". In 2013 columnist Nate Cohn described PPP as a liberal pollster, although according to statistician Nate Silver, PPP had a tendency to slightly lean Republican as of September 2016. As of June 13th, 2020 Silver's website, FiveThirtyEight, gives PPP a B grade in its pollster ranking.

A pastiche of the John Le Carr√© spy thriller and transmitted eleven months after Anthony Blunt was exposed as the 'fourth man', the drama combines two of Potter's major themes: the visitation motif and political disillusionment. The play's title is taken from \\"The Eton Boating Song\\". Synopsis Professor Jason Cavendish is the septuagenarian author of Cloud Cape, a children's fantasy novel. He lives in a secluded cliff-top mansion with his second wife Linda, his 18-year-old daughter Christabel and Mr Hill, his butler and personal secretary. They are visited one day by Daniel Young, who claims to be writing a thesis on political allegory in children's literature. After saving Cavendish's life when the old man has a seizure, Daniel is invited to stay by Linda and Christabel who fight for his affections. Mr Hill, meanwhile, is suspicious of Daniel's motives and concerned by Cavendish's reluctance to show him what he is writing. Daniel seduces Christabel and, unknown to the others, murders Linda. Daniel reveals to Cavendish that his true name is Daniel Cartwright, and that his father Andrew was a British intelligence officer who was murdered by Cavendish while escorting a Soviet defector to the British embassy. Cavendish leads Daniel to a summer house at the bottom of the garden where the author reveals he has been writing his memoirs, implicating himself and Mr Hill, as well as several high-profile MPs, as Soviet sympathizers. Daniel convinces Cavendish to surrender the papers and shoot himself; the old man obliges, having grown weary of the enforced secrecy of his final years. Having discovered Linda's body, Hill arrives at the summer house to execute Daniel. The young man reveals that he has been sent by the KGB at Hill's request to prevent Cavendish blowing their cover, and that Linda was a sleeper agent for MI6. Daniel leaves Hill to clean up the mess and leaves. The remorseful Hill approaches the summer house to attend his beloved friend's body. Principal cast * Tom Conti as Daniel Young * Donald Pleasence as Jason Cavendish * Denholm Elliott as Mr Hill * Kika Markham as Linda * Phoebe Nicholls as Christabel * Gareth Forwood as Doctor Bell * Alvar Lidell as newsreader Production Blade on the Feather was originally conceived as a feature film to be produced by Potter and Kenith Trodd's own production company Pennies From Heaven Ltd., but problems with funding led to the drama being part of an arrangement with London Weekend Television as the first of nine single plays: all produced by PFH Ltd. and commissioned by Michael Grade for broadcast on ITV between 1980 and 1981. Six of the plays were to be written by Potter, while the remaining three were to be shared between Jim Allen and an undisclosed writer. In the event, budget cuts and scheduling problems meant that only three plays were produced: Blade on the Feather, Rain on the Roof and Cream in My Coffee. All three dramas were shot on 16mm film stock and featured extensive location work. In Potter on Potter, the dramatist told Graham Fuller that although Cavendish is more closely based on Kim Philby than any of the other Cambridge spies he is not intended to be a fictional version of that figure. Philby is mentioned several times throughout the play, as are Guy Burgess and Donald Maclean: all of whom in the drama were apparently recruited by Cavendish. Nevertheless, Cavendish and Hill are an amalgamation of the three spies; despite the old man's denigration of the trio as 'drunks, queers and lefties,' Cavendish and Hill are both represented as heavy drinkers, Hill's faith in Sovietism is said to be bordering on fanaticism by the disillusioned Cavendish and the friendship between the two men is presented with a distinctly homoerotic undertone (most notably in their joint recitation of \\"The Eton Boating Song\\"). Director Richard Loncraine claimed he heavily rewrote several scenes in Potter's original script because they were unusable. Structure and themes The play contains none of the non- naturalistic flourishes that dominate much of Potter's work, however it does contain two flashback sequences that hint at Daniel's motives in coming to the house. The first of these flashbacks shows the murder of Daniel's father as he escorts the Soviet defector to the British Embassy, while the second features the young Daniel and his father by the polar bear enclosure at London Zoo; Daniel drops a book he is carrying into the water, whereupon it is fished out by a zoo keeper and revealed to be Cloud Cape. Daniel later states to Mr Hill that he bears no malice towards Cavendish for his father's murder as their infrequent trips to the zoo are all he remembers about him. What the audience presumes to be a fond memory therefore becomes an unreliable one and ties into one of Potter's major themes of memory as a malleable source. The visitation motif that Potter explored in several of his other works (see below) is an important narrative thread in Blade on the Feather. In the play, Daniel is named after his biblical counterpart ('a Daniel come to sit in judgement') and in his role as disruptive outsider ultimately restores peace to the troubled household. The central theme of Blade on the Feather is betrayal‚Äîboth political and personal‚Äîand throughout the course of the play each character betrays the other. Cavendish betrays Hill by writing his memoirs, while Hill betrays Cavendish by calling in Daniel to execute his old friend; Linda betrays Cavendish in her role as a sleeper agent brought into the household to spy on her husband, while Christabel betrays her father by sleeping with the visitor. Daniel's role as KGB assassin means that instead of seeking vengeance for his father's death he is ultimately protecting Cavendish's cover, therefore betraying his father. Political disillusionment is another key theme; the consequences of an individual's cynicism towards an established social order leading them to more prescriptive ideologies. Cavendish reveals to Daniel that he was drawn to the communist fervor at Cambridge in the 1930s as a means of escaping the rigidities of his traditional upper-class English background, only to find himself tarnished by his association with Sovietism. When Christabel attempts to reassure him that their way of life is safe following Thatcher's victory at the general election, Cavendish tells her: > There isn't any sort of England someone of my generation would think he had > inherited [...] Take away the pudding and the baked jam roll and the custard > and there isn't very much left. Broadcast and reception Blade on the Feather was broadcast on ITV on 19 October 1980 and attracted favourable reviews. Denholm Elliott won the BAFTA Best Actor award in 1981 for his performance. The play also won for its graphics (Pat Gavin) and was nominated in four other categories. Intertextuality Potter explored political defection and its consequences in Traitor (1971), Gorky Park (1983), The Singing Detective (1986) and Cold Lazarus (1996). The visitation motif plays a central role in The Confidence Course (1965), Shaggy Dog (1968), Angels Are So Few (1970), Joe's Ark (1974), Schmoedipus (1975), Brimstone and Treacle (1976), Rain on the Roof (1980), Track 29 (1987) and Secret Friends (1992). Daniel's anecdote about the Pakistani waiter sweeping up in a fast food restaurant and the outraged response this provokes from a disgruntled diner is taken from Joe's Ark, in which Dennis Waterman's character reacts in the same way after receiving news of his sister's terminal illness. Commercial releases This filmed play has been issued in Region 1 and 2 DVD along with other Potter works for LWT. In the United States, it was released on VHS tape under the title Deep Cover (Prism/Paramount) in 1990.

Climate and soil diversity is a key feature of the landscape of Bolivia, a country extending between 9¬∞ to 22¬∞ South and 57¬∞ to 69¬∞ West. The indigenous cultures that played a key role in the differentiation of the native Bolivian maize races were the Aymara in the north, the Sauces in central Bolivia, and the Yampara in the south. Specifically, the Aymara adapted maize crop growth to the Lake Titicaca plateau, about 3,500-3,800 meters above sea level, a harsh environment, cold, arid, and windy. Traditionally, maize is cropped in the following regions: * Low tropics (200-900 masl) * Subtropics (1,000‚Äì1,600 masl) * Sub-Andean Chaco (200‚Äì1,500 masl) * Inter-Andean slopes and valleys (1,700‚Äì3,000 masl, as far as the shore of Lake Titicaca at 3,800 masl) Most maize harvested under 1,000 masl is cropped in commercial farms and used to feed livestock. Use as food Maize is a staple ingredient of traditional Bolivian cooking. It is used to prepare typical dishes such as; * Api - hot drink for breakfast, * Chaque & Lagua - soup, * Chicha - alcoholic drink, * Choclo - kernels boiled inside the ear leaves, * Confituras - cooked popped kernels dressed with honey, * Huminta - smashed milky kernels, seasoned and cooked inside the ear leaves, * Mote - dry cooked kernels, * Tostado or Palomitas de ma√≠z - popcorn. History Maize crossed from the Peruvian mountains into Bolivia about 3,000 BCE as a marginal food of the Andean peoples. Primitive maize, with small and popping kernels, and flint endosperm aligned in four distinct rows on the ear, later shifted to a decussed eight row alignment. Prior to the Incan rule of Bolivia, selection of the mean primitive ears with eight rows diversified and underwent qualitative specialization (kernel composition, consistency, shape and color), followed by the increase in the number of the rows. The key events of this process were;El ma√≠z y su mejoramiento gen√©tico en Bolivia, Gonzalo √Åvila Lara, p142. ANCB ‚Äì FSIP. Cochabamba. 2008. * the increase in the ear size, * the increase in the number of the kernels per ear, * the increase in the number of the rows of kernels, * the increase in the kernel size, * the change in the kernel texture. Later, selection was directed to link molecular markers (pigmentation) to the different kinds of present-day varieties. For instance; * semi-flint kernel varieties are yellow, * floury kernel varieties are white, * soft texture kernel varieties are motley. Maize from the \\"Morocho\\" and \\"Perla\\" varieties crossed the Andes mountain ridge and adapted to the lower altitude and different climates of Paraguay, Argentina, and the Brazilian lowlands, before the arrival of the Spaniards in the sixteenth century. Contemporary classification Since the mid-1970s, the Centro Fitot√©cnico y Ecogen√©tico de Pairumani in Cochabamba collected and characterized over 1,500 maize samples. These were studied by environment, morphology, and cytological analysis of the chromosomes, resulting in the classification of 7 racial complexes, 45 races and hundreds of agro-ecotypes. These accessions are presently stored at the Pairumani germplasm bank. On the basis of these and previous studies,Ram√≠rez E. R., Timothy D. H., D√≠az B. E., Grant U. J., 1960.

Until the coming of the colliery Dinnington was a mainly agricultural village with a small amount of quarrying in the area. In 1899 preparations were being made by the Sheffield Coal Company to sink a new colliery at Dinnington. The company did not have the resources to complete the work and entered into a partnership with the Sheepbridge Coal and Iron Co and this joint company, the Dinnington Main Colliery Company, came into being in 1900. The colliery commenced sinking in 1902 and reached the Barnsley seam of coal in the summer of 1904. The first coal was drawn to the surface the following year which is also when the mine gained its second shaft. Rail connection for the colliery was eventually made by the South Yorkshire Joint Railway (SYJR) when its line opened in January 1909. The SYJR was a five way joint line with connections to ports and towns in the area and beyond. At the time of the 1946 nationalisation of the coal industry the colliery was in the hands of Amalgamated Denaby Collieries, based at Denaby Main, near Doncaster. Following nationalisation the colliery became part of the National Coal Board. The colliery stopped production in October 1991, and was closed in 1992 with the loss of over 1,000 jobs. At the start of the 21st century, the former colliery site was subject to one of the largest former coal mine reclamation schemes that Yorkshire had seen. Johnston Press, a regional publisher and printer, sited a ¬£60 million printing press on the site in 2006. Nearby St Leonard's Church in Dinnington, has a mining memorial commemorating the 74 miners who died whilst working at Dinnington Main, though the eventual tally of the dead is disputed by some researchers.

(See Clan Swinton) France, Hundred Years War He was one of the greatest fighters of his time. In youth, the Borders being too quiet for him, he had signed on with John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster. He made an interesting agreement with John of Gaunt which included the following among other terms: *a) Swinton was not to be required to fight against his own country. *b) He was to be given double pay, and free transport for himself, his horses and his men. *c) The Duke was to replace any of his horses that were lost or taken. In return, he was to have one-third share in the ransom of Swinton‚Äôs future prisoners and in his other \\"profits of war\\". This unusual \\"contract\\" shows that Sir John must already have acquired a solid reputation as a fighter, perhaps in Prussia or Spain or even both, some time before 1371, when it was made. Sir John fully justified the trust placed in him, through his conduct in a series of campaigns and particularly at Noyon (between Amiens and Paris) when he fought his way single-handed into the town. Legend says he was the hero who, according to Jean Froissart, leaped the barrier gates at Noyon and for love of the fray fought the chivalry of France for more than an hour \\"alone against them all\\" - \\"giving many grand strokes with his lance.\\" When the army began to move and he had to rejoin it, he cleared the way with a thrust or two, sprang back, and mounting, with his page in front, cried : \\"Adieu, adieu, Seigneurs, grands mercis!\\" and spurred away. About this time, he married a young wife, Joan, who died without children and whose jewels were stolen by Alice Perrers, Edward III‚Äôs mistress (who also stole the King‚Äôs rings from his fingers as he lay dying). He appealed to the King for their return, but they could not be traced, and it is not altogether surprising that he returned to Scotland soon after. Battle of Otterburn He was a commander at the Battle of Otterburn in July 1388 when the Scots won the day and defeated the English, although their leader, the Earl of Douglas, was slain. The Scotichronicon, talking of the battle, mentions \\"a very experienced, strong, and brave Scot\\", John Swinton, who carved a path through the English: \\"Because of this the Scots were able to penetrate the English line with their spears, so that the English were forced to give ground to this strong force\\". It is related of Sir John, that in the wars with the English, he visited the enemy's camp, and gave a general challenge to fight any of their army. Appointments He was appointed one of the ambassadors extraordinary by King Robert III to negotiate a treaty with the court of England, for which they got a safe conduct from King Richard II for themselves and sixty knights in their retinue, 4 July 1392. He was afterwards employed upon another negotiation, and obtained a safe conduct from King Henry IV to go to England, with twenty horsemen in his retinue, 7 July 1400. Battle of Homildon Hill The gallant bearing and heroic death of the Lord of Swinton, at the fatal battle of Homildon, have afforded a subject for the poetic genius of Scott, and are the materials on which he founded the drama of \\"Haledon Hill\\". Pinkerton thus records Swinton's fall: \\"The English advanced to the assault, and Henry Percy was about to lead them up the hill, when March caught his bridle, and advised him to advance no farther, but to pour the dreadful shower of English arrows into the enemy. This advice was followed with the usual fortune; for in all ages the bow was the English weapon of victory, and though the Scots, and perhaps the French, were superior in the use of the spear, yet this weapon was useless after the distant bow had decided the combat. Robert the Great, sensible of this at the battle of Bannockburn, ordered a prepared detachment of cavalry to rush among the English archers at the commencement, totally to disperse them, and stop the deadly effusion. But Douglas now used no such precaution; and the consequence was, that his people, drawn up on the face of the hill, presented one general mark to the enemy, none of whose arrows descended in vain. The Scots fell without fight and unrevenged, till a spirited knight, Swinton, exclaimed aloud, \\"O my brave countrymen! what fascination has seized you to- day, that you stand like deer to be shot, instead of indulging your ancient courage, and meeting your enemies hand to hand? Let those who will, descend with me, that we may gain victory, and life, or fall like men.\\" This being heard by Adam Gordon, between whom and Swinton there existed a deadly feud, attended with the mutual slaughter of many followers, he instantly fell on his knees before Swinton, begged his pardon, and desired to be dubbed a knight by him whom he must now regard as the wisest and boldest of that order in Britain. The ceremony performed, Swinton and Gordon descended the hill, accompanied by only one hundred men, and a desperate valour led the whole body to death. Had a similar spirit been shewn by the Scottish army, it is probable that the event of that day would have been different.\\" Family life Swinton‚Äôs second wife was the Countess of Douglas and Mar, but they had no offspring. His third wife was Princess Margaret, daughter of Robert Stewart, Duke of Albany who served as Regent from 1406 to 1419. The Princess bore Swinton a son, later Sir John Swinton of Swinton, reckoned to be the fifteenth Lord of the name.

These methods exist in the areas of Knowledge Discovery in Databases (KDD), Data Mining, Machine Learning and Statistics. They offer applicable and successful solutions in different areas of electronic fraud crimes. In general, the primary reason to use data analytics techniques is to tackle fraud since many internal control systems have serious weaknesses. For example, the currently prevailing approach employed by many law enforcement agencies to detect companies involved in potential cases of fraud consists in receiving circumstantial evidence or complaints from whistleblowers. As a result, a large number of fraud cases remain undetected and unprosecuted. In order to effectively test, detect, validate, correct error and monitor control systems against fraudulent activities, businesses entities and organizations rely on specialized data analytics techniques such as data mining, data matching, sounds like function, Regression analysis, Clustering analysis and Gap. Techniques used for fraud detection fall into two primary classes: statistical techniques and artificial intelligence.  Statistical techniques  Examples of statistical data analysis techniques are: *Data preprocessing techniques for detection, validation, error correction, and filling up of missing or incorrect data. * Calculation of various statistical parameters such as averages, quantiles, performance metrics, probability distributions, and so on. For example, the averages may include average length of call, average number of calls per month and average delays in bill payment. * Models and probability distributions of various business activities either in terms of various parameters or probability distributions. * Computing user profiles. * Time-series analysis of time-dependent data. *Clustering and classification to find patterns and associations among groups of data. *Data matching Data matching is used to compare two sets of collected data. The process can be performed based on algorithms or programmed loops. Trying to match sets of data against each other or comparing complex data types. Data matching is used to remove duplicate records and identify links between two data sets for marketing, security or other uses. * Sounds like Function is used to find values that sound similar. The Phonetic similarity is one way to locate possible duplicate values, or inconsistent spelling in manually entered data. The ‚Äòsounds like‚Äô function converts the comparison strings to four-character American Soundex codes, which are based on the first letter, and the first three consonants after the first letter, in each string. *Regression analysis allows you to examine the relationship between two or more variables of interest. Regression analysis estimates relationships between independent variables and a dependent variable. This method can be used to help understand and identify relationships among variables and predict actual results. *Gap analysis is used to determine whether business requirements are being met, if not, what are the steps that should be taken to meet successfully. *Matching algorithms to detect anomalies in the behavior of transactions or users as compared to previously known models and profiles. Techniques are also needed to eliminate false alarms, estimate risks, and predict future of current transactions or users. Some forensic accountants specialize in forensic analytics which is the procurement and analysis of electronic data to reconstruct, detect, or otherwise support a claim of financial fraud. The main steps in forensic analytics are data collection, data preparation, data analysis, and reporting. For example, forensic analytics may be used to review an employee's purchasing card activity to assess whether any of the purchases were diverted or divertible for personal use.  Artificial intelligence techniques  Fraud detection is a knowledge-intensive activity. The main AI techniques used for fraud detection include: * Data mining to classify, cluster, and segment the data and automatically find associations and rules in the data that may signify interesting patterns, including those related to fraud. * Expert systems to encode expertise for detecting fraud in the form of rules. * Pattern recognition to detect approximate classes, clusters, or patterns of suspicious behavior either automatically (unsupervised) or to match given inputs. * Machine learning techniques to automatically identify characteristics of fraud. *Neural nets to independently generate classification, clustering, generalization, and forecasting that can then be compared against conclusions raised in internal audits or formal financial documents such as 10-Q. Other techniques such as link analysis, Bayesian networks, decision theory, and sequence matching are also used for fraud detection. A new and novel technique called System properties approach has also been employed where ever rank data is available. Statistical analysis of research data is the most comprehensive method for determining if data fraud exists. Data fraud as defined by the Office of Research Integrity (ORI) includes fabrication, falsification and plagiarism. Machine learning and data mining  Early data analysis techniques were oriented toward extracting quantitative and statistical data characteristics. These techniques facilitate useful data interpretations and can help to get better insights into the processes behind the data. Although the traditional data analysis techniques can indirectly lead us to knowledge, it is still created by human analysts. To go beyond, a data analysis system has to be equipped with a substantial amount of background knowledge, and be able to perform reasoning tasks involving that knowledge and the data provided. In effort to meet this goal, researchers have turned to ideas from the machine learning field. This is a natural source of ideas, since the machine learning task can be described as turning background knowledge and examples (input) into knowledge (output). If data mining results in discovering meaningful patterns, data turns into information. Information or patterns that are novel, valid and potentially useful are not merely information, but knowledge. One speaks of discovering knowledge, before hidden in the huge amount of data, but now revealed. The machine learning and artificial intelligence solutions may be classified into two categories: 'supervised' and 'unsupervised' learning. These methods seek for accounts, customers, suppliers, etc. that behave 'unusually' in order to output suspicion scores, rules or visual anomalies, depending on the method. Whether supervised or unsupervised methods are used, note that the output gives us only an indication of fraud likelihood. No stand alone statistical analysis can assure that a particular object is a fraudulent one, but they can identify them with very high degrees of accuracy.  Supervised learning  In supervised learning, a random sub-sample of all records is taken and manually classified as either 'fraudulent' or 'non-fraudulent' (task can be decomposed on more classes to meet algorithm requirements). Relatively rare events such as fraud may need to be over sampled to get a big enough sample size. These manually classified records are then used to train a supervised machine learning algorithm. After building a model using this training data, the algorithm should be able to classify new records as either fraudulent or non- fraudulent. Supervised neural networks, fuzzy neural nets, and combinations of neural nets and rules, have been extensively explored and used for detecting fraud in mobile phone networks and financial statement fraud. Bayesian learning neural network is implemented for credit card fraud detection, telecommunications fraud, auto claim fraud detection, and medical insurance fraud. Hybrid knowledge/statistical-based systems, where expert knowledge is integrated with statistical power, use a series of data mining techniques for the purpose of detecting cellular clone fraud. Specifically, a rule-learning program to uncover indicators of fraudulent behaviour from a large database of customer transactions is implemented. Cahill et al. (2000) design a fraud signature, based on data of fraudulent calls, to detect telecommunications fraud. For scoring a call for fraud its probability under the account signature is compared to its probability under a fraud signature. The fraud signature is updated sequentially, enabling event-driven fraud detection. Link analysis comprehends a different approach. It relates known fraudsters to other individuals, using record linkage and social network methods. This type of detection is only able to detect frauds similar to those which have occurred previously and been classified by a human. To detect a novel type of fraud may require the use of an unsupervised machine learning algorithm. Unsupervised learning In contrast, unsupervised methods don't make use of labelled records. Some important studies with unsupervised learning with respect to fraud detection should be mentioned. For example, Bolton and Hand use Peer Group Analysis and Break Point Analysis applied on spending behaviour in credit card accounts. Peer Group Analysis detects individual objects that begin to behave in a way different from objects to which they had previously been similar. Another tool Bolton and Hand develop for behavioural fraud detection is Break Point Analysis. Unlike Peer Group Analysis, Break Point Analysis operates on the account level. A break point is an observation where anomalous behaviour for a particular account is detected. Both the tools are applied on spending behaviour in credit card accounts. A combination of unsupervised and supervised methods for credit card fraud detection is in .  Available datasets  A major limitation for the validation of existing fraud detection methods is the lack of public datasets. One of the few examples is the dataset made available by the .

The antennae are double saw combed. The flightless females have almost entirely vestigial wings, a clumsy body, tapering at the end of body shape and are grey brown. The stub wings have are grey with two black crosses. Adults are on wing from October to November. The larvae feed on various deciduous trees, including Betula, Quercus robur, Sorbus aucuparia, Rosa and Prunus padus.

Early life Stephen Mortimer Warner was born in Eltham, Kent on 17 January 1873. The fifth of nine children, his father Alfred was 35, a hotelier at the Craven Hotel, Craven Street, off the Strand in London; his mother Mary was 26. Ordination and Ministry Stephen Warner attended the London College of Divinity and graduated in Classics from Durham University. In 1896, he became a deacon at St Simon's church in Southsea. He was ordained a priest in 1897 and in the same year married Marion Gower Tooth, who was a cousin of Sir Robert Lucas Lucas-Tooth, 1st Baronet. Between 1898 and 1900, he was the vicar of Savernake, near Marlborough, before spending a year at St Paul's in Poole. From 1910 to 1914, he was the vicar of Christ Church, Sandown before moving to St Paul's, Upper Norwood until 1919. From 1919 until his death in 1947, he was the rector of Holy Trinity, Eastbourne. Holy Trinity, Eastbourne Holy Trinity, Eastbourne Stephen Warner came to Holy Trinity, Eastbourne in 1919 and made the church a centre of Christian life and activity. His Evangelical preaching and teaching were of a missionary character and he built up a fellowship among young and old alike which had a great influence in the town among residents and visitors. Countless numbers of people were greatly helped by his forceful Bible teachings. In addition to his sermons in the church, he held open air services on the seafront during the summer months His influence extended far beyond Eastbourne. He had travelled all over England conducting missions and when he became Canon Warner - a prebendary of Chichester Cathedral ‚Äì in 1930, he enriched the life of the diocese. Canon Warner was later elected president of the Eastbourne branch of the CEZMS (the Church of England Zenana Missionary Society) and Hon Secretary of the annual gathering of Evangelical clergy and Laymen of the Diocese of Chichester. His missionary work and an encompassing interest in youth organisations were, with his zeal for writing religious books, a great part of his life. He worked very hard for the United Mission in 1923 and had previously conducted the Mission in London but these duties took their toll. On 9 December that year he was preaching in the pulpit when illness overtook him but he finished the sermon and gave out the notice of a hymn. He then asked another vicar to conduct the rest of the service, before struggling to the vestry where he collapsed. In 1938, on the centenary of Holy Trinity, the Bishop of Leicester referred in a sermon to the great social benefits brought to Britain by the Evangelical ministry of Holy Trinity. The Bishop of Chichester praised Canon Warner's zeal as a missionary, both in Eastbourne and elsewhere. Although Canon Warner was an excellent pastor, his forte did not necessarily lie in administration. Indeed, he used to hold PCC meetings at 6.30pm in the Vicarage so that they could be dispensed with by the time the 7.30pm dinner gong sounded. Eastbourne was an evacuation area during the Second World War. The town suffered frequent heavy bombing attacks. Naturally, there were no holiday visitors as in peacetime. Most of the shops closed and the majority of houses stood empty. Not surprisingly the size of Trinity's congregation dropped to about 150 in the morning and 100 in the evening. Canon Warner continued his ministry with the help of a retired clergyman and also acted as an RAF honorary chaplain to the Sea Cadets. In September 1939, quotations had been sought for removing the East window and storing it while replacing the stained glass with plain glass. The East window was comparatively new, having been given in 1934 in memory of the vicar's wife, Marion Warner, who had died that year. In the end an imaginative scheme was devised whereby the windows were left in situ but shuttered from the outside. Electric lights were placed between the shuttering and the glass. Thus the fabric was protected, ‚Äòblackout‚Äô preserved at evening times and the beauty of the windows could still be appreciated. In light of the heavy ‚Äòsneak‚Äô raiding that Eastbourne suffered, it is quite miraculous that the church did not suffer more damage during the war. No direct hits were ‚Äòscored‚Äô but near misses in 1940, 1942 and 1943 did destroy all of the stained glass, except the protected East window, and damaged the roof slates and structure. Eastbourne Seafront As soon as the war was over, Canon ‚ÄòBeach‚Äô Warner restarted his seafront meetings for holidaymakers. From Easter until the end of August, he would speak on the beach opposite the Burlington Hotel. In September the venue would change to outside the Lifeboat museum. A past-master at using visual aids, he would use the end of the building as a projection screen. In September 1946, a British ‚ÄòYouth for Christ‚Äô meeting was held in Holy Trinity Church when, at the invitation of Canon Warner, the speaker was the American evangelist Billy Graham. This was Graham's first ever speaking engagement in the UK. The congregation was beginning to recover from the ravages of war and by Christmas 1947, Canon Warner was preaching to a packed church of around 1,200. In spite of his conviction that he would live to see the Second Coming, this was to be Canon Warner's last sermon as he died in his sleep two days later, aged 74. A collection was made for a memorial and it was agreed to use the money partly for a window in the church and also for a project abroad. Work was well underway on a Ruanda Mission building in Ibuye, Burundi and it was decided to contribute ¬£866 towards the building of the teaching block. Memorial Window Four classrooms, a hall, a staff room and a library were constructed of burnt brick with corrugated iron roofing to catch the water supply. Named ‚ÄòThe Canon Warner Memorial College‚Äô, the theological college taught many ordinands, lay readers and senior evangelists over the years until political unrest put the building into disuse. Within Holy Trinity, three new stained-glass windows were commissioned, one as a memorial to Canon Warner and two as memorials to those of the parish who had died in the two World Wars. The ‚ÄòCanon Warner‚Äô window is in the East end of what is now the Chapel. It depicts ‚ÄòChrist the Good Shepherd‚Äô with his sheep. Studland Studland Church Stephen Warner had a long association with and affection for Studland village in Dorset. He first travelled there with his wife Marion while on their honeymoon in Bournemouth in January 1897. The journey involved a horse bus to Sandbanks, a rowing boat across the entrance to Poole Harbour and a pony trap from Shell Bay. The following summer the couple spent their holiday in the village at Agglestone House before buying ‚ÄòSunnyholme‚Äô in 1901. From 1905 until 1945, Canon Warner and his family held the tenancy of the Coombe House. Until his death in 1947, Canon Warner took the services at St Nicholas‚Äô on many occasions when the rector was away and is buried in the churchyard.
