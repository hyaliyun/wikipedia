History Cast iron footbridge at Cogan station (February 2016) The current platforms were constructed in 1888, but until 1968 Cogan had two additional and separate platforms on the other side of the main Windsor Road, opened twenty years earlier in 1878 on the Penarth and Sully branch line, which extended from the Cogan Junction points around the coastline through Lavernock and Sully to where it rejoined the main line at Cadoxton. That through link was closed in 1968, and the line now terminates at Penarth. Dingle Road Halt and Penarth station remain open, but the two platforms at Cogan were closed when the line was reduced to a single-track spur. Most of the station buildings still stand but have been used by several private businesses including a shooting range, a garden centre, a second-hand car lot, and a marine chandlers. The area originally covered by the Cogan and Penarth dock's railway sidings and engine maintenance sheds now contains a large Tesco supermarket. The cast iron footbridge between the two platforms has a heritage listing of Grade II.\\"Footbridge at Cogan Station, Cogan Hill, Penarth\\", British Listed Buildings. Retrieved 2016-02-26. It was removed and refurbished in 2019. New lighting and decking was added whilst the bridge was painted in the red and white colour scheme of the original Barry Railway who erected the bridge. The station is close to Pont y Werin, a pedestrian and cyclist bridge linking Penarth to the Cardiff International Sports Village in Cardiff Bay, which opened in July 2010. Service Monday to Saturday daytimes, there is a 15-minute frequency northbound to Cardiff Central and beyond. Southbound, there are three trains per hour to Barry Island and an hourly service to Bridgend via Rhoose. Evenings and Sundays, there is generally a half-hourly service to Cardiff Central. Evenings, there is an hourly service southbound to Barry Island and Bridgend whilst on Sundays there is a half-hourly service to Barry Island and one to Bridgend every two hours.

Genera are now placed in the family Malvaceae, in the subfamilies: Byttnerioideae, Dombeyoideae, Helicteroideae and Sterculioideae. As traditionally circumscribed the Sterculiaceae, Malvaceae, Bombacaceae, and Tiliaceae comprise the \\"core Malvales\\" of the Cronquist system and the close relationship among these families is generally recognized. Sterculiaceae may be separated from Malvaceae sensu stricto by the smooth surface of the pollen grains and the bilocular anthers. Numerous phylogenetic studies have revealed that Sterculiaceae, Tiliaceae and Bombacaceae as traditionally defined are cladistically polyphyletic. The APG and APG II systems unite Bombacaceae, Malvaceae sensu stricto, Sterculiaceae and Tiliaceae into a more widely circumscribed Malvaceae, i.e., Malvaceae sensu lato. In that view the taxa formerly classified in Sterculiaceae are treated in the subfamilies Byttnerioideae, Dombeyoideae, Helicteroideae and Sterculioideae of the Malvaceae sensu lato. The Thorne system takes an intermediate approach in combining the bulk of the traditional Sterculiaceae (but not including Sterculia itself) with elements of the traditional Tiliaceae to form the family Byttneriaceae. Sterculiaceae had previously been recognized as a family by most systematists; in its traditional sense the family includes about 70 genera, totalling around 1,500 species of tropical trees and shrubs. The most famous products of the family are chocolate and cocoa from Theobroma cacao, followed by kola nuts. Many species yield timber. A 2006 molecular study indicated the Sterculioideae was most likely to be a monophyletic group, and that it had four major clades within it. However, the relationships between the clades were not resolved.

He challenged twice for middleweight world championships; the vacant WBA title in 2001; and the undisputed title against Bernard Hopkins in 2005. At regional level, he held the British, Commonwealth and EBU European middleweight titles twice each between 1998 and 2007. Early years Having spent some time homeless, Eastman later served in the Gulf War in the Royal Fusiliers. He turned professional in March 1994 with a first-round knockout of John Rice. He garnered a reputation as a heavy puncher in the gyms of the UK, where he regularly sparred with Super Middleweights, such as Chris Eubank. His career progressed slowly and at a low profile for many years as fellow British boxers were reluctant to face him. He accumulated an 18-0 (16 knockouts) record before challenging Steve \\"The Viking\\" Foster in November 1998 for the British Middleweight title, which he won via 7th-round knockout. In September 2000 he won the Commonwealth Middleweight title by outpointing Australian-based Egyptian (and future #1 contender) Sam Soliman, and finally began receiving wider coverage. World title challenger In April 2001, having put together a 31-0 (28 knockouts) record, he got a high-profile fight defending his British and Commonwealth titles and challenging for the vacant European title against Robert McCracken, who had unsuccessfully challenged Keith Holmes for the WBC world title the previous year. Eastman dominated the fight and dropped McCracken, stopping him in the 10th round.BBC coverage of Eastman-McCracken match Following this match, U.S. promoter Don King signed him up and in November 2001 he fought two-time champ William Joppy for the vacant WBA world title on a Lennox Lewis undercard in Las Vegas. Eastman narrowly lost a controversial majority decision despite knocking Joppy down in the final seconds of the twelfth round. After this fight Eastman sat out a year in Guyana and let his contract with King expire. Eastman resurfaced in late 2002, under the Hennessy Sports promotional outfit, and trained by former opponent McCracken. Eastman scored two knockouts, over Chardan Ansoula and Hussain Osman, respectively. He regained his European title in January 2003 against the French man Christophe Tendil, whom he stopped in five rounds with a broken jaw,BBC coverage of Eastman-Tendil match and regained his British and Commonwealth titles by knocking out Scott Dann in three rounds. He defended the European title twice more, stopping ex-world champion Hacine Cherifi in eight rounds in July 2003 and outpointing Sergey Tatevoysan in January 2004. Now with a 40-1 record and highly ranked by all sanctioning bodies, Eastman finally got the forty-year-old undisputed Middleweight king Bernard Hopkins into the ring to defend his titles, in February 2005 in Los Angeles. Eastman was outsmarted and widely outpointed by Hopkins (110-119, 111-117, 112-116) who was making his historic 20th defence. Post-fight there was initial talk of a rematch, however as the scores suggest the contest for not close enough for this to materialize.Hennessy Sports coverage of Eastman-Hopkins match After the world title fights Eastman travelled to Germany in July 2005 to fight a WBA eliminator against hard hitting Armenian Arthur Abraham, Eastman lost the fight on points however claimed he had been robbed of the decision.Hennessy Sports coverage of Eastman-Abraham match Abraham went on to win the vacant IBF world title after the unified middleweight title was fractured after Hopkins lost to Jermain Taylor. In March 2006, Eastman traveled to the U.S. and took on another risky eliminator, this time for the IBF title. He was stopped on his feet by the undefeated Colombian-Puerto Rican Edison Miranda. Eastman protested that he should have been allowed to continue since he had not been down in the fight.www.hennessysports.com Reclaiming his belts On 15 December 2006, he regained his British Middleweight title by knocking out Richard Williams in the 12th and final round in London, England. Eastman was well ahead on all scorecards by the time the match ended. In April 2007, Eastman added the Commonwealth belt to the British title with a 12-round points decision over the Kenyan Evans Ashira in Dudley. Eastman prevailed 116-113, 116-112, 116-113. In September 2007, Eastmans revival was ended. When defending his British title against domestic fighter Wayne Elcock Eastman was surprisingly outworked and outpunched, dropping a shock points defeat by margins of 113-116, 113-115, 114-115. Elcock had previously been knocked out by Eastman-victim Scott Dann. Eastman was offered a final shot at contention, matched with John Duddy in Belfast. After a competitive 10 rounds, Eastman lost a unanimous decision. Guyana Eastman has continued his career in his country of birth, Guyana. He beat Denny Dalton to claim the Guyanese middleweight title, before securing victories over former WBA world welterweight champion Andrew Lewis, Leon Gilkes and Kevin Placide. In 2010 he served time in prison for possession of cannabis. However, following the Placide fight, he went on a six-fight losing streak, losing to Kwesi Jones (September 2010, UD4), Kirt Sinnette (July 2011, TKO8, for the vacant WBC CABOFE light-heavyweight title), Edmund DeClou (October 2011, MD12, for the vacant Guyanese middleweight title), two defeats to Simeon Hardy in 2012 (UD10 and MD8) and Sakima Mullings (April 2013, UD12, for the vacant WBC CABOFE welterweight title). Eastman ended this streak in August 2013, when he took a unanimous decision over Mark Austin over 8 rounds. In 2014, he entered the Jamaican version of the Contender series, where he was the second seed behind the aforementioned Mullings, and part of the Caribbean team.

Career  Birley (then Helmore) began her career as a fashion model in her late teens. She worked with many noted photographers, including Steven Meisel and Robert Mapplethorpe. Her distinctive sense of style influenced designers such as Christian Lacroix, Manolo Blahnik and Philip Treacy. In May 1982, she was photographed wearing a medieval helmet and holding a falcon at Crumlin Lodge, outside of Inverin, Connemara for the cover of Roxy Music's album Avalon. As a photographer she worked solely with manual cameras and favored a twin-lens Rolleiflex camera. Birley developed her own film and exhibited her work in London.

Sources for this state come from texts that can be divided into three categories: Assyrian annals, Aramaean texts, and the Hebrew Bible. The largest portion of the textual sources come from Assyria. There are, however, often several copies of the same texts. Most of the texts are annals from the Assyrian kings Shalmaneser III, Adad-Nirari III, and Tiglath-Pileser III. The texts mention Aram-Damascus (≈†a-imƒìri≈°u, Imƒìri≈°u, Imirishu) from an Assyrian perspective, but are in many ways informative of the strength of the state, and give us several names of its rulers. Aramaean royal inscriptions are rare, and only one royal stele from Aram-Damascus proper has been identified -- the Tel Dan Stele. Other sources in Aramaic that shed light on the history of Aram-Damascus include two \\"booty inscriptions\\" from Eretria and Samos, and the Zakkur stele of the king Zakkur. The Hebrew Bible gives more detailed accounts of Aram-Damascus' history, mainly in its interaction with Israel. For instance, there are texts of the Bible mentioning David's battles against Aramaeans in southern Syria in the 10th century BC. () In contrast, the sources for the early history of Aram-Damascus are almost nonexistent. In an annal dating to Tiglath-Pileser I (1114‚Äì1076 BC), we learn that Aramaean people have begun settling in the southern half of Syria. The first reliable data can be found in the 9th century BC when Aramaean, Assyrian, and Hebrew texts all mention a state with its capital in Damascus. The state seems to have reached its peak in the late 9th century BC under Hazael, who, according to Assyrian texts, fought against the Assyrians, and according to Aramaean texts, had some influence over the north Syrian state Unqi,James B. Pritchard, ed., Ancient Near Eastern Texts Relating to the Old Testament (3rd ed.; Princeton NJ: Princeton University Press, 1955) 246. and according to Hebrew texts, conquered all of Israel.() To the southwest, Aram- Damascus reached over most of Golan to the Sea of Galilee. In the 8th century BC, Rezin had been a tributary of Tiglath-Pileser III, the king of Assyria.Lester L. Grabbe, Ancient Israel: What Do We Know and How Do We Know It? (New York: T&T; Clark, 2007): 134 In c. 732 BC, he allied himself with Pekah, the king of Israel, to attack Ahaz, the king of Judah. However, Ahaz appealed to Tiglath-Pileser III for help. This the Assyrian king obliged, after Judah paid tribute to the Assyrian king. () As a result, Tiglath-Pileser III sacked Damascus and annexed Aram. According to , the population was deported and Rezin executed. Tiglath-Pileser also records this act in one of his inscriptions.James B. Pritchard, ed., Ancient Near Eastern Texts Relating to the Old Testament (3rd ed.; Princeton NJ: Princeton University Press, 1969) 283. Archaeological evidence of Aram-Damascus is close to nothing. Excavations in Damascus are hard to perform, owing to the continuous settlement of the city. Other cities of Aram-Damascus have not been positively identified from textual sources, and excavations of Iron Age sites around Damascus are almost nonexistent. The material culture at sites farther south (e.g. Tell-Ashtara, Tell er-Rumeith, et-Tell, Tel-Dan, Tell el-Oreme ('Oreimeh), to name but a few) do not show many features distinguishing from the material culture of ancient northern Israel.

The dance floor could accommodate four thousand couples. Admission was 40 cents for gentlemen and 25 cents for ladies. Opening night was attended by 20,000 people, including many of Hollywood's silent screen stars. Klieg lights illuminated minaret structures on the roof. The dance hall was renamed Rainbow Gardens by real estate developer Raymond Lewis, who purchased the property, added an indoor miniature golf course and changed the name to the Palomar Ballroom. It soon became a prime venue for the well-known bands that were rapidly gaining popularity. On August 21, 1935, Benny Goodman began his first Palomar engagement that marked the start of the swing era.allaboutjazz.com: Benny Goodman The ballroom hosted popular bands including those led by Tommy Dorsey, Glenn Miller, Artie Shaw, Glen Gray, Jimmy Dorsey, and Kay Kyser, among others.

Life Born, Chesterfield, Derbyshire, he attended Hasland Junior School as a child and graduated in natural sciences from Emmanuel College, Cambridge (1931), taking his Ph.D. in nuclear physics. From 1934-1935 he was sponsored by ICI to undertake research at the University of Amsterdam.Entwistle (2004) After a period in teaching, in 1940 he was conscripted to the Telecommunications Research Establishment to work on radar, including an improved system to distinguish between friend and foe. From 1943, he continued his work at the U.S. Naval Research Laboratory, establishing himself as an able and effective administrator. From the end of World War II to 1953 he held a series of jobs, including selling early computers manufactured by Ferranti. His prescient forecasts of the impact that the technology would have on daily life were published in his 1953 book Faster than Thought. In 1953, Bowden became principal of the Manchester College of Science and Technology, a vocational education college in Manchester. The post-war expansion in university education in Britain, coupled with Bowden's energy, creativity and lobbying soon entailed the college's transformation into UMIST (University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology.) On 18 January 1964, he was created a life peer as Baron Bowden, of Chesterfield in the County of Derby and later in this year, Harold Wilson appointed him Minister for Education and Science. However, Westminster and the labyrinths of the civil service were ill-matched to Bowden's direct approach and, in 1965 he returned to UMIST. He retired in 1976.

After beginning his acting career on the stage in 1937, he played Charles Kingsford Smith in the film Smithy (1946). He also had roles in Bulldog Drummond at Bay (1947), Kiss Me Kate (1953), I Am a Camera (1955), Most Dangerous Man Alive (1961) and King of Kings (1961). Early life and career Randell was the son of Ernest Randell (d. 26 May 1946) and Louisa Egan, who had married in 1912. His father was an accountant, born in Broken Hill. Randell was born in Sydney and was the youngest of three sons, the others being Reg and Norm. He attended Marist Brothers in North Sydney. He left school at the age of 14, and went to work as an office boy in a Sydney finance office. =Early career= Aged fourteen, Randell participated in a few sketches at a social acting club and did an unpaid job for radio station 2UE. He made his first professional appearance for the ABC at 14 for the Children's Sessions. He soon started acting regularly on children's serials. After eight months, Randell quit his office job to concentrate on acting. He soon established himself as a leading male juvenile for radio, acting for 2KY Players, George Edwards, BAP and on Lux Playhouse. He also worked as a comp√®re for variety shows, in particular with Jack Davey and did a two-man revue with Lloyd Lamble.Richard Lane, The Golden Age of Australian Radio Drama, Melbourne University Press, 1994 p248 He worked in both Sydney and Melbourne. Randell made his legitimate stage debut aged 19, in a production of Quiet Wedding at the Minerva Theatre in Sydney. Randell later joked, \\"I moved out of radio and back into theatre because I was becoming a left-hand actor. I would hold the script in my right hand and do all my acting with my left hand.\\" Most of his stage work at this time was done at the Minerva Theatre, including performances in Of Mice and Men. Randell stated police were ready to arrest the cast of Of Mice and Men because the play featured the word \\"whorehouse\\". \\"Fortunately we received a standing ovation and the police decided in the circumstances not to make any arrests.\\" As late as 1974, Randell would say this was his favourite performance. In 1943 he was cast in two Australian wartime propaganda films - 100,000 Cobbers (1943) and South West Pacific (1943). Unable to serve because he was suffering tuberculosis (although he also claimed it was due to sinus trouble), he travelled to the US in mid 1943 and sought treatment at the Mayo Clinic.Randell p 29-31 =US visit= In San Francisco he was cast in a stage play with Nancy Carroll. He also appeared on radio with Robert Young in Transport for Adams. He later related that he had tested for the role of Stanley in Lifeboat (1944) for Alfred Hitchcock, but was unsuccessful ‚Äì he did the test with an American accent saying he was unaware they were looking for a cockney. Through Cecil Kellaway he got a screen test at Paramount but this was unsuccessful, as was another for 20th Century Fox.Randell p29 - 32 He returned to Sydney in 1944 and resumed his theatre and radio career. Film stardom =Return to Australia and Smithy= In October 1944, Randell made his feature film debut in A Son Is Born, opposite Peter Finch and Muriel Steinbeck.

We have taken a long time over our selection, but we are extremely happy with our choice.\\" The release of A Son is Born was held off until after Smithy had come out, to take advantage of its publicity.Richard Lane, The Golden Age of Australian Radio Drama, Melbourne University Press, 1994 p250 Smithy was a big hit at the Australian box office, and Randall was widely acclaimed as a local star. A Ron Randell Film Club was established and Randell would be mobbed at personal appearances. =Columbia Pictures= Smithy had been made with funds from Columbia Pictures, who offered Randell a long-term contract and he moved to Hollywood in October 1946. Producers Lou Appleton and Bud Small had a deal with Columbia to make a new series of pictures about Bulldog Drummond. According to Appleton, \\"We wanted a new film face and someone with a British way of speaking.\\" They were impressed with his Smithy footage and put him in Bulldog Drummond at Bay. (It was made for an independent company, Venture, but released through Columbia.) Columbia were impressed enough by this that in April 1947 they cast Randell in a good support role in an expensive \\"A\\" production, It Had to Be You (1947). \\"I'm grateful for playing opposite people like Ginger Rogers and Cornel Wilde\\", said Randell. \\"They really know their business. You can't imagine what it means to get away from those 'Bulldog Drummond' detective roles I was afraid I'd be type-cast and never play anything else.\\" He was called back for another go as Drummond in Bulldog Drummond Strikes Back, which filmed in June 1947 at the same time as The Mating of Millie (1948). This was followed by The Sign of the Ram (1948) and the $2 million spectacular The Loves of Carmen (1948), where Randell was billed after Columbia's two biggest stars, Rita Hayworth and Glenn Ford. However his part in the final movie was very small. Randell had been meant to make four Drummond films but only appeared in two. In January 1948 it was reported Tom Conway had taken over the role of Drummond and that Randell was focused on \\"A\\"s. \\"I would like to be busy in a picture every day for the next two years, at least,\\" he said. \\"With too much free time an actor, I think, loses, the emotional pitch at which he works most effectively.\\" He added he preferred comedy to drama, saying \\"I have a serious face, but I think I have feeling for comedy because/1 have a light mind.\\" The same month it was reported e had obtained the screen rights to a story Hebridies Adventure by James MacFarlane and was trying to interest Columbia in making it.Barbara Bel Geddes Will Portray Tomboy Schallert, Edwin. Los Angeles Times 21 Jan 1948: 15. Randell wrote a short book for publication in Australia, Ron Randell in Hollywood which he dedicated \\"to the many Australian boys and girls who have given me loyalty and support, and to express the hope that they may enjoy some of my Hollywood experiences with me.\\" One review said \\"as an account of those experiences, ending with some pious aspirations concerning the talkies as an instrument for world peace, it's not too bad. Over to you, boys and girls. \\" In February 1948 he was being sought after to appear in a Broadway play The Rats of Norway. In July 1948, Columbia announced Randell would play another detective hero, in The Lone Wolf and His Lady (1949), hoping it would lead to more but there was no follow-up. In November 1948 a Washington Post profile called Randell \\"a lot of fun, looks a bit like James Mason.\\"Aussie Marvels At Movie Love By Richard L. Coe. The Washington Post 2 Nov 1948: 17. The studio put him in a support role in a Make Believe Ballroom (1949). \\"This will be the final major assignment I understand\\", wrote the Los Angeles Times in September 1948. Filmink magazine later noted this was when Columbia seemed to lose interest in Randell. In October, Randell married for the first time.\\"Aussie Marvels At Movie Love\\" by Richard L. Coe The Washington Post; 2 November 1948; ProQuest Historical Newspapers: The Washington Post pg. 17 In November 1948, Randell was told he needed to leave the country under the terms of his visa. By January 1949, it was announced his Columbia contract had lapsed. He was mentioned as a possible star for a production of Robbery Under Arms by Michael Balcon that was not made. In April, he appeared in a production of Kraft Television Theatre, Wicked Is the Vine, based on a play by Australian Sumner Locke Elliott. He was in The Shark God (1949). =Return to the stage= In July 1949 he appeared on stage in Los Angeles in a production of Major Barbara and said he did not want to make any more \\"B\\"s. \\"I know I've surprised quite a few Hollywood people, because they have never seen me working in something really good\\", he said. \\"In Major Barbara I have a chance to be charming and intelligent, a chance I was never given while working in pictures.\\" Randell admitted that his determination to refuse offers in \\"B\\" pictures might be \\"tough on me financially\\", but he would prefer fewer but better film offers to large numbers of grade \\"B\\" roles. I wasn't happy working in those pictures, anyway.\\" He looked to Broadway and discussed appearing in The Devil's Carnival. Instead he returned to Columbia to appear in a swashbuckler for Sam Katzman, Tyrant of the Sea (1950). He filmed this at the same time he was cast in a double-bill Terence Rattigan plays, The Browning Version and Harlequinade, supporting Maurice Evans and directed by Peter Glenville. (Glenville cast Randell on the basis of his performance in Major Barbara.) Brooks Atkinson of the New York Times said Randell was \\"particularly good\\" in his \\"curious part\\". The production did not have a long run and closed in December. He was announced for a film The Killer that Stalked Broadway with Maurice Evans but it was never made. Randell was meant to follow Browning Version with The Enchanted by his employment was over-ruled by Actors Equity who said that as a foreigner he should have to wait six months before appearing in another play. \\"They have made a martyr of me\\", said Randell. \\"It is a horrible thing and a backward step for the United States, which always has been a forward country as far as Equity is concerned. It is the first time I knew any American organisation did not welcome competition. This new part was going to be the big break for me. It would have meant a very great deal to my career. Now I am forced to go without a job for six months, and I can't afford that.\\" He spent some time in London and considered moving there. Instead he returned to Hollywood to appear in Lorna Doone (1951), although it was a support role ‚Äì the star was Richard Greene. He was to have appeared in a stage production of The Corn Is Green but pulled out when Columbia used him again for Counterspy Meets Scotland Yard.author=He appeared in a play, The Amazing Adele with Ruth Gordon, which was being tried out in Westport. However, he left the production to appear in another, Angel in the Pawnshop. He was cast in a play by Frederick Lonsdale, The Day After Tomorrow. However, before the play went to New York, a production was seen by Sir Cedric Hardwicke whose wife was in the show; it resulted in Randell being replaced by Jack Watling. Randell returned to movies with China Corsair (1951) at Columbia supporting Jon Hall. He followed it with Captive Women (1952), a low budget science fiction film for RKO, in which Variety said he \\"occasionally shows himself to be a first rate actor.\\"Revie of Captive Woman at Variety He had a smaller part in The Brigand (1952) for Edward Small. These were all B-pictures. In September 1951 Randell went into rehearsals for a production of Candida with Olivia de Havilland. This toured America from October for the next few months, and eventually reached New York. \\"I don't have any desire to go back to movies\\", he said. \\"A good, adult picture, yes. But I don't care if I never do another like the kind I worked in for Columbia Pictures.\\" Brooks Atkinson, reviewing Randell's performance in Candida, said he was \\"intelligent and manly but... leaves out the pompousness essential to the part and the play\\". Candida only had a short run on Broadway. This commitment meant he could not be in The Golden Carriage, from Jean Renoir, and Invasion U.S.A., from the makers of Captive Woman. In August 1952, Randell's name was mentioned in connection with two films to be made about Australia with Paulette Goddard, The Queen's Mask and Melba. He also tried to raise finance for a film about Don Bradman. Of these projects only Melba was made, without Randell. Randell was in an A picture: The Mississippi Gambler (1953). He also worked extensively in television. =Britain= By now Randell was frustrated at the progress of his career. According to one report, \\"Typed as\\"the dull Englishman who invariably lost the heroine to the hero, Randell was in a rut. Feeling he was destined to play an Englishman for ever, Randell decided to go to England, where his chances of getting the girl-and the fans might improve.\\" He turned down a support part in The Red Beret and instead supported Michael Denison and Dulcie Grey in a play, Sweet Peril. He took time out from rehearsals to appear in a TV series shot in Germany, Orient Express, starring in the TV special \\"The Blue Camelia\\". While playing in Sweet Peril he also made the film The Girl on the Pier (1953) and appeared in \\"American Duel\\" on TV for Douglas Fairbanks Jnr. He was interested in producing a play in New York: Pommy by William Lipscomb. After five months, Randell returned to Hollywood to play Cole Porter in MGM's Kiss Me, Kate (1953). While there he appeared on TV in \\"Where Lovely Women\\" with Arlene Dahl. =The Kiss= He came to London to appear in a West End production, The Fifth Season. It did not have a long run. Randell appeared in \\"Theatre Royal\\" on the BBC then became an \\"overnight success\\" when he took over as the summer replacement for the host of the British TV series What's My Line? in May 1954. He blew a kiss to a viewer on air, causing controversy. It led to a series of offers, including a role in a national tour of Sabrina Fair and a role in I Am a Camera (1955). He was to have been in The Girl Friends directed by Michelangelo Antonioni. but did not appear in the final film. From October 1954 to December 1955, Randell hosted the ABC anthology series The Vise. In the US he made a pilot to a TV show with Pat Crowley, My Man, Sing and a film Desert Sands (1956). =Return to Australia= In March 1955, Randell returned to Australia to appear in a stage production of The Caine Mutiny Court Martial. There was an incident when he and fellow members of the play's cast ‚Äì including Americans Jeffrey Lynn and Lee Tracy ‚Äì were locked in a hotel room for not paying their bill. The play was not a financial success and only played in Sydney. Later career Randell returned to Hollywood to make Frontier Scout (1956), then went to Bermuda for Bermuda Affair (1956). In October 1955 he got a job in London compering TV show On the Town, replacing Jack Jackson. He had to take a leave of absence to make Beyond Mombassa (1956) in Africa. He had a support role in The Story of Esther Costello (1957) shot in London. In May 1956 he returned to Hollywood after a six-month absence and appeared in The She-Creature (1956). In September 1956 Randell told the press, \\"With this present phase of making films all over the world, an actor has to be ready to pack up and keep moving. In one year I have worked in these places, in this order: Hollywood. London, Hollywood, Bermuda, London, and Kenya. It seems I only get home long enough to let the ice freeze in the refrigerator.\\" In London he made The Hostage (1956) for Douglas Fairbanks Jnr and the film Davy (1958). He got a job playing an American in the TV series, O.S.S. (1957‚Äì58). He was going to make Lost Mission with his wife and James and John Woolfe but it appears to have been never made. Neither was The Mystic Confederacy which Randell optioned for his own production company. \\"I belong to no one country I guess\\" said Randell around this time. \\"Australia must have checked me out some time ago. I'm neither an American citizen nor an English one.\\" While shooting OSS, Randell heard Joshua Logan was doing a Broadway adaptation of The World of Suzie Wong. Randell's then-wife was Eurasian so they went to Hollywood to meet Logan, hoping she would be cast in the title role. Randell ended up being cast in the third lead, only on stage for ten minutes, with Randell paid $1,000 a week. The play was a big hit. =1960s= He had an excellent part in King of Kings (1961), shot in Spain. He acquired the rights to a novel, Defender's Triumph, and intended to film it as 7 Soho Squared but the film was never made. Randell did play the lead in The Most Dangerous Man Alive (1960) and made a film in Germany, It's a Great Life (1961). He was going to produce and star in a war survival film,. Chain of Fear, directed by Leonardo Bercovici but did not appear in it. Randell returned to Australia briefly to promote King of Kings in late 1961. He said he wanted to make a film in Woolloomooloo based on the Camden Town Murder with Ralph Richardson, but was not made. He was also in The Longest Day (1962), as an American war correspondent, Follow the Boys (1963) and Gold for the Caesars (1963). He and his wife wanted to star in and produce an adaptation of Year of the Cricket by John Lorring. He did co-produce The Gallant One (1964), shot in Peru and starring his wife. He guest starred on The Outer Limits. In 1964, he appeared as Hubert Ambrose in the Perry Mason episode \\"The Case of the Illicit Illusion\\". He guest-starred twice in Bewitched in 1964 and 1967, and played a lead role in the two-part \\"The Contenders\\" episode in the series Mission: Impossible in 1968. During this time, Randell played in several European films such as Savage Pampas (1966). He returned to Australia in 1967 to appear in There's a Girl in My Soup which was very popular. \\"\\"As an international actor I have no home\\", said Randell. \\"My luggage is spread across nine hotels in Europe and America and so are my friends. Randell remembered doing multiple voices in radio in his old Sydney days, but said \\"I just couldn't do that sort of thing today if I tried\\", adding that \\"I hate radio.\\" He also said Australia should make more local shows. Randell returned to Australia in 1969 to explore the possibilities of producing a play there, Houseboat in Kashmir, by the team of Jerome and Lee. He was also looking into organising luxury golf tours. He was commuting between the US and London and had recently bought in apartment in London. While in Australia he guest-starred in episodes of local TV series like The Rovers, and discussed projects with Reg Goldsworthy. =1970s= Randell returned to Australia again in 1971 to direct and star in a stage play, Come Live with Me, at the Phillip Street Theatre in Sydney. He had never directed before. He said he intended to co produce a film in Australia called Northward the Coast but it was never made. He returned to Australia in 1974, to appear in a six-week run of a play, Champagne Complex, at Wrest Point Casino in Hobart. He said he was trying to produce a TV series based on the book Colour of the East by John Russell. However, it was not made. Randell told the press that he was not getting a lot of television work in the USA. \\"My face is like the Gable sort of face and when he was in fashion so was I. That's the way it works in Hollywood; for years your face is in fashion, then suddenly the Robert Redford face is in or the Al Pacino face... If you're not on TV every night, people think you're dead.\\" He added later that year, \\"for most of my life I've played phonies... There is no place for an Australian... I think I'm a kamikaze actor at the moment ‚Äì I think I've arrived at that. It is death or glory for me... I range the world but I'm not a superstar. The insecurity of acting never really bothers me that much. I find now that life is so exciting... The glamorous moments have been very rate. I've been working for more than 30 years and survived... and it's survival that counts.\\" =New York= In 1975, Randell appeared on Broadway in a production of Sherlock Holmes. The following year he was in Mrs Warren's Profession; thework=New York Times theatre critic said he \\"does very decently\\". He also appeared in Measure for Measure. During his later career, Randell worked steadily on Broadway, though rarely in leading roles. His notable appearances included Bent. Personal life Randell was married three times. He married his first wife, stage actress Elaine Diana Maltzman, in New Canaan, Connecticut, in October 1948.\\"Ron Randell weds secretly\\". (18 October 1948). Townsville Daily Bulletin, p. 2. They divorced in 1949.'RANDELL'S WIFE TO SUE FOR A DIVORCE', The Canberra Times, Saturday 5 February 1949 p 1 He was engaged to actress Amanda Blake, and they planned to marry in 1951'To Marry Ron Randell', The Canberra Times, Saturday, 21 July 1951 p 2 but there seems no evidence they went through with their plans. He was engaged to Marie Keith in September 1952, and they married in October that year. However, they separated in 1953, at which time he was seen with Amanda Blake, who was described as his \\"former fiancee\\". Marie Keith and Randell were divorced in 1955. He had a romance with Hildegarde Christian then married Laya Raki in 1956, and they remained together until his death in Los Angeles in 2005 following a stroke. He was 86.

Randell"},{"id":"2064907","text":"Supernormal is a children's television programme for CITV. It was developed and produced by World Leaders Entertainment in New York City, USA, and Granada Kids UK. It was animated by Fatkat Animation, a Canadian animation studio. It made its television d√©but on 1 September 2007 on CITV, but the official premiere was on 8 September of the same year.Supernormal debuts on CITV: Fatkat blog About The Show In the ordinary city of Crumptonville can be found a school for superheroes! Sure, the students wear Spandex and study Death Traps and Doomsday Machines, but they still have all the problems normal kids have at normal schools. There are super-achievers and super-slackers, super-nerds and super-jocks‚Ä¶ there's even a teacher's pet - but it lives in the basement, and eats cats! SuperNormal follows the adventures of four of the, er, less promising students at the school. There‚Äôs Changerella - a peace- loving shape-shifter who thinks the world would be happier with more flowers, love and pink stuff. The Brass Butt (BB to his friends) - he's not too bright, but is super strong and uses his mighty and shiny brass butt to fight the forces of evil! Buzz Girl - a sarcastic four-armed girl who possesses a multitude of powers from the insect world... and a weakness for porch lights! And Eric Normal. An ordinary boy with no superpowers whatsoever. Yet through a combination of sheer good luck and a little dash of common sense, he was able to get through the school‚Äôs combination obstacle course/entrance exam. It's here that brave, enthusiastic and earnest Eric Normal and his friends will learn what it really means to be heroes, with or without superpowers! Characters = Eric Normal= Eric Normal, the world's first superhero without superpowers! Eric Normal may wear a Spandex suit and a home made cape, but the only thing super about him is his total normalcy. Fiesty and determined, Eric is living every kid's dream: he gets to dress up in a colourful costume and punch things, but he takes his role as a superhero-in- training very seriously. He's filled with enthusiasm, a keen sense of justice and is itching to give evil a swift kick in the butt. Eric knows that he doesn't have any superpowers, but that won't stop him from getting stuck in! He fancies himself as a master planner, but his plans are rarely thought out. But whether it's luck or coincidence, Eric Normal will always stand victorious. When the fate of the world teeters on the brink of oblivion, a 13-year old kid with the power of being super normal may not be the first person you think of ringing, but Eric always has his hand on the phone, ready to answer the call of justice! He is voiced by Michael Sinterniklaas. =The Brass Butt (BB)= Strong and loyal! The Brass Butt is Eric Normal's best friend and constant companion.

Braddock, dubbed \\"The Cinderella Man,\\" who in 1935 upset Max Baer to become the World Heavyweight Champion. He also managed Lightweight contender Ray Miller from 1930‚Äì1933.Joe Gould boxrec.com Career Gould met then 20-year-old amateur boxer James Braddock at Joe Jeanette's gym in Hoboken, New Jersey in 1925. With Gould as his manager, Braddock turned pro in 1926 and went 14-0-2 before losing his first fight. After a completely one-sided loss to defending Light Heavyweight champion Tommy Loughran in July 1929, Braddock's career fell into decline as he lost more than won. By 1933, unable to support his family as a boxer, Braddock worked as a longshoreman and went on public assistance. Gould was instrumental in forging a phenomenal comeback for Braddock in June 1934 when Primo Carnera was scheduled to defend his Heavyweight title against Max Baer. The promoters needed an opponent for up and coming John ‚ÄúCorn‚Äù Griffin on the undercard. Gould pleaded for Braddock to be inserted as Griffin's opponent stating that Braddock needed money just to put food on the table for his children. They agreed to pay him $250 for a 6-rounder against Griffin which Braddock won in 3 rounds. Five months later Braddock decisively won a rematch against John Henry Lewis in 10 rounds followed by an easy 15-round decision against Art Lasky. Braddock was then slated to face Max Baer, the reigning Heavyweight Champion of the world. On June 13, 1935 at Madison Square Garden, the 10-to-1 underdog Braddock won the World Heavyweight Championship in one of the most stunning upsets in boxing history. On June 27, 1937, Braddock lost the title to Heavyweight contender Joe Louis. Seven months later, in the final fight of his career, he defeated Tommy Farr in Madison Square Garden.Jim Braddock - He Made the Impossible, Possible , by Joe Torcello, May 2, 2010, theboxingmagazine.com Later life Gould enlisted in the U.S. Army in 1942, and became a First Lieutenant.

The station has been the terminus ‚Äì and only remaining active station at the end of the Barry branch of the Cardiff Central to Barry Island line since the closure of Barry Pier station in 1976, the last passenger working through Barry Island tunnel to the Pier station, being an enthusiasts' special in 1973. Previous to that year, only a few revenue-earning workings to meet up with the former P&A; Campbell's paddle-steamer trips to Weston-super-Mare or other Somerset/Devon havens, were made following May 1964. Passenger services, operated by Transport for Wales as part of the Valley Lines network, currently use the first half of platform 1. History =Opening= In 1896 the railway line was extended along the newly built raised road causeway from Barry Station onto the island to provide a service to the newly opened and developing Barry Island Pleasure Park day tripper leisure facilities. The Barry Island station opened in time for the August Bank holiday 1896. The new rail line also crossed to the Island at road level and consequently a level crossing was needed where the line crossed Plymouth Road. When premises on Station Approach Road (formerly Roman Well Road) were being renovated in the late 1990s, traces of the original track were discovered in the basement. To give improved passenger access to the P & A Campbell's White Funnel steamers that plied the Bristol Channel in 1899, the line was continued past Barry Island station through a 280-yard double-line tunnel to the new Barry Pier railway station. =Peak years= Diesel railcar depot and terminus looking towards the station in 1966. The peak years for passenger numbers at Barry Island were in the 1920s and 1930s. From 1924 on most peak-time August Bank Holiday Mondays between 80,000 and 100,000 visitors arrived at the Island and mostly by train. After the 1926 General Strike, reports in the local and national press described the scenes over the 1927 August Bank Holiday weekend at Barry Island as 'organised chaos' . It was estimated that in excess of 120,000 arrived at the island with packed trains arriving and leaving Barry Island Station at five-minute intervals. In excess of 75 special excursion trains, each carrying an estimated 500-600 passengers arrived from Cardiff's Riverside Station during that morning and early afternoon. A report in the local press on one Bank Holiday Monday, when an estimated crowd of over 150,000 arrived at the Island, described the scene as follows - \\"When it was time for visitors to leave the Island a queue started to form just before 6 pm and by 9.30 pm was still over a quarter of a mile long, it snaked around the fairground with people waiting to board their trains. Excursionists from the Midlands and places other than Cardiff and the Valleys using one entrance and boarding their non-stop return trains and \\"Locals\\" having to wait for a space to return to Cardiff.\\" In 1927 the GWR decided to issue special day return tickets from Cardiff General (Riverside) at one shilling each (5 new pence) and sold over 82,000 tickets. Demand during the morning was so great that temporary ticket booths had to be set up at the Riverside concourse to cope with the high level of sales. Additional trains and rolling stock were quickly laid on, over and above the planned timetable, to transport the additional visitors to Barry Island. By 12 noon, the station ticket office totally ran out of tickets and were forced to use hand amended tickets that had been dated for the following day. =Decline= Traffic levels started to fall in the 1950s and 1960s with the spread of greater car ownership in the UK, especially after the Severn Bridge opened in 1966. A further sudden drop occurred between 1968 and 1970 with the closure of the former Taff Vale Railway branch line between Penarth and Cadoxton, Biglis Junction in 1968, the former of which had served through traffic to Cadoxton from Cardiff via Penarth. In its final period of passenger use, the line south of Penarth was operated using a single car DMU from Penarth to Cadoxton only. The through route at Penarth station had been permanently blocked by buffer stops between the Cardiff end of the station and Cadoxton end whence the line at Biglis junction merged with the direct Cardiff via Dinas Powys main line to Barry Island. The wholesale closure of rural rail links all over the country accelerated the switch to private car use by holidaymakers. =Station layout= Platforms 2 and 3 in 1967 In its heyday (prior to the early 1960s), the station had four operational platforms - one long main platform on the 'up' side divided into 2 sections (numbered 1 & 2, with 2 served by a dead end spur off the through line to ) and an island platform on the 'down' side (numbered 3 & 4). There were also several carriage sidings at the east end of the station opposite platform 2, with a signal box at each end of the stationSignalling Diagram - Barry Island West Signal BoxSignalling Record Society; Retrieved 2013-09-19 to control the layout. The 'East' ‚Äôbox was closed in 1964 and replaced by two groundframes, \\"A\\" and \\"B\\", \\"A\\" being housed in a ground-level cabin, and bearing single-line token apparatus for any workings over the single tunnel line to Barry Pier but with the former 'West' ‚Äôbox taking over responsibility for the passenger service to & from the station.Signal Box Diagrams - Barry Island 1964 www.signalbox.org; Retrieved 2013-09-19 The branch from was built as double track, but was singled in 1969. The line between Barry Island station and Barry Pier through the tunnel had been singled to the tunnel's half-way point in 1929 at which point it doubled and then quadrupled into the station platform area at the Pier terminus. The remaining signal box at the station was damaged by fire in 1976 and was out of service for repairs for more than a year - this coincided with the final closure of the Pier branch and the abolition of platform 2, leaving only 3 platforms in use. The two faces of the island platform were thereafter (especially from 1982 onward - when the carriage sidings and Pier branch were finally lifted) only used during the summer for excursion traffic, with the ‚Äôbox normally \\"switched out\\" and all trains using platform 1.Adrian The Rock - Signalling at Barry www.roscalen.com; Retrieved 2013-09-19 This method of operation continued right up until the ‚Äôbox was permanently abolished in March 1998, though main line connections to the tracks serving platforms 3 & 4 had been disconnected for some years by this time. Following the closure of the ‚Äôbox, half of the redundant track through platform 3 was lifted, platform 4 track abandoned and platform 1 track was curtailed at a buffer stop halfway along the platform. Platform 4 track was absorbed into the Barry Tourist Railway's infrastructure and east of the footbridge, all former BR permanent way was eventually removed but with extended track from platform 4 to the BTR Plymouth Rd shed, platform, headshunt and run-around loop for the Tourist Railway's use. The remaining bi-directional single line to and from Barry was henceforth operated using ‚ÄòOne Train Working‚Äô regulations from Barry Station signal box (since abolished - the branch is now controlled from Wales Railway Operations Centre (WROC) at Canton, Cardiff, whilst the defunct island platform had its footbridge steps to platforms 3 & 4 removed. Platform 4 was subsequently handed over to the Vale of Glamorgan heritage project (see below). In 2012, the station footbridge giving right of way to the public was replaced by a state-of-the-art structure with disabled access facilities but which offers no access to any of the platforms. =Vale of Glamorgan Railway= The Heritage Vale of Glamorgan Railway Company moved their operations to Barry Island station in 1997 from Cardiff Butetown railway station when the Cardiff Bay Development Corporation indicated that they had no use for a heritage steam railway in their plans. The heritage railway started operating heritage trains from Barry Island's platform 4, running across the causeway alongside the Network Rail line, before continuing on to a purpose-built single track incline to the new Waterfront terminus at Hood Road at No.1 dock quay level. By 2007, the Company had extended their line from a junction on the Barry end of the Causeway to a new halt at Gladstone Bridge alongside Morrisons supermarket, the final intention being to further extend ¬Ω mile to a new terminus alongside the Network Rail Barry Docks station, making their end-to-end main track length two miles.The Vale of Glamorgan Railway Following financial cutbacks brought about by the global credit crunch, the Vale of Glamorgan Council withdrew annual grant support for the heritage railway and placed the facilities up for tender. The heritage railway subsequently failed to secure the new lease and were forced to withdraw from Barry Island station in December 2008.Walesrail - Vale of Glamorgan Railway Walesrail; Retrieved 2014-04-10 Private transport operator Cambrian Transport subsequently took over the lease in December 2009 and they now run the heritage line as the Barry Tourist Railway which as at January 2018, terminates at Gladstone Bridge halt.

Plot synopsis Buffy feels life spinning out of control. In the previous episode, Willow got high on the magic (so much so that her eyes are almost permanently dilated and darkened to black) and crashed a car, breaking Dawn's arm. Willow is still distraught. Dawn is ignoring Buffy and resents her because Buffy was off secretly having sex with Spike during the crisis, so the younger Summers is only talking to Xander. Dawn is further irritated because Buffy is gathering up everything in the household even slightly magical and hiding it so Willow can avoid magical temptation, including a statue of the Hopi god Kokopelli, which Dawn treasures because it belonged to their late mother, Joyce. The social worker comes round to check on how Buffy's doing (at the worst possible time) ‚Äì while the living room is scattered with Willow's old spell ingredients and objects. Buffy digs herself into a deep hole by saying \\"It's magic weed.\\" Spike, in the daytime but using a blanket to cover him, comes over to her house wanting his lighter back. Then he leaves after worsening the situation, calling Buffy Goldilocks. In a state of depression and determined to become a grown-up, Buffy cuts her hair up to her shoulders, and makes a trip to the hairdresser to have it styled. As she leaves, the Trio pulls up to a tanning salon nearby. Warren has modified his freeze ray into an invisibility gun, and they are about to make themselves invisible. However, Andrew and Jonathan fight over who gets to use the gun first and accidentally overload it, sending beams over the parking lot; a beam hits Buffy (now with a new pageboy hairstyle), making her vanish (along with a dumpster, traffic cone, and fire hydrant). Anya and Xander are talking about their upcoming wedding at the Magic Box. The door opens but no-one enters. Buffy's voice comes out of nowhere, along with picking up two magical circular items and making them look like eyes. Upon discovering this, Xander immediately believes that Willow may have suffered a relapse and confronts her, but Willow is offended and insists that she is not responsible. Buffy continues her invisible adventures in Sunnydale. \\"I'm the ghost of fashion victims past,\\" she moans to a civilian, who is wearing a studded cap. She then drives off with a parking inspector's cart. Buffy drives to the workplace of the social worker who had made that morning's inspection to the Summers' home. Using her invisibility to its full advantage, she tricks the social worker into behaving in a bizarre manner and replaces the Summers' report with pages consisting entirely of repetitions of \\"All work and no play make Doris a dull girl.\\" Doris also tells her supervisor that \\"There was a voice. It made my coffee dance\\", not knowing that invisible Buffy was teasing and moving the coffee cup to make Doris react and appear insane. The supervisor believes that Doris is having a mental break with reality and sends her home, saying that he would send someone else to inspect the Summers' home the next day. Buffy then heads to Spike's. She tries to sexually assault Spike while she's invisible, surprising him. \\"I told you to stop trying to see me,\\" she finally jokes, exposing her identity. Then she and Spike go downstairs to have sex. In the meantime, Xander and Anya discover that the invisibility ray was causing the structure of the traffic cone to break down, and realize that the same thing would happen to Buffy if the invisibility wasn't reversed. Xander runs to Spike's crypt in search of Buffy, where he finds Spike in bed, naked and appearing to be alone. In reality, however, Buffy and Spike are making love. After Spike claims he's \\"doing push-ups\\", Xander has a chat with him, wanting to know where Buffy is, and Spike honestly says that he hasn't \\"seen\\" her. Throughout the conversation, invisible Buffy embraces and affectionately teases Spike, making him laugh despite Xander's presence. Spike tries to act normal, somewhat unsuccessfully. Xander finally leaves, puzzled by Spike's odd behavior, telling Spike that he really needs to get a girlfriend. Buffy wants to continue their physical activities, but Spike tells her that he is tired of being with her and not really having her. He asks her to leave if she isn't really going to be with him. He is frustrated with her carefree attitude and doesn't appreciate the way she seems to be using the invisibility as an excuse to escape her real life. She protests, but eventually leaves. She doesn't do too well at home when she scares Dawn, who has the same frustrations as Spike, combined with extreme worry for her sister. The bad stuff keeps on coming when she gets the message from Xander and Anya on the answering machine. \\"Tell her about the pudding\\" says Anya, referencing the way the invisible traffic cone found by Willow had started to disintegrate into mush. However, before Buffy can head back to the Magic Box, Jonathan phones her up (disguising his voice so Buffy doesn't identify him) and tells her that the Trio has kidnapped Willow and tells her to meet them at the arcade. Buffy does so. However, the Trio have also made themselves invisible, and Warren is holding Willow hostage. Warren lies to Buffy, telling her that he is going to reverse the invisibility. But Willow points out that he's put it on a setting that is going to kill her. Warren knocks her to the ground and aims the gun at Buffy, telling her that she can't see them. However, Buffy's Slayer training (and possibly her experiences in \\"Out of Mind, Out of Sight\\" and \\"Family\\") provide her with some ability to sense the invisible villains. A scuffle ensues. Warren ends up in the ball-pit, Andrew ends up in the pinball machine and Buffy is holding Jonathan. Willow, who has changed the frequency, aims at Buffy, Jonathan, Andrew, and Warren, and all four are visible again. Buffy finally sees that the Trio are human, rather than demons as she had been expecting. Andrew, who she has not met before, is introduced to her as Tucker's brother. After a brief stand-off, a smoke-bomb goes off and the Trio - despite an embarrassing scuffle to open the arcade door - escape. Buffy and Willow sit on the curb outside and talk. The two then discuss the events of the day, and Willow admits she nearly used magic but didn't; Buffy also admits that while she's still not happy about being alive, when faced with death she realised she didn't want to die. The two then contemplate their small but notable steps towards dealing with their respective problems.  Continuity  * When the invisible Buffy introduces herself to Xander and Anya, he asks if she has been feeling ignored and Buffy replies that this isn't a Marcie deal. This is a reference to Marcie Ross in the Season 1 episode \\"Out of Mind, Out of Sight.\\" * Dawn's left arm is in a sling as a result of the injury sustained in the previous episode \\"Wrecked.\\"  Trivia  * When Willow is searching the DMV computer system for information about the Trio's van, the words, \\"encrytped information\\" (sic) appear on the screen.  Episode titles  This is the third of three consecutive episodes in the sixth season (\\"Smashed\\", \\"Wrecked\\", and \\"Gone\\") with titles which are slang for drunkenness or being under the influence of narcotics in American English, and reflect Willow's descent into her addiction to magic.

Barton- Wright had previously also studied \\"boxing, wrestling, fencing, savate and the use of the stiletto under recognised masters\\", reportedly testing his skills by \\"engaging toughs (street fighters) until (he) was satisfied in their application.\\" He defined Bartitsu („Å∞„Å°„Å§) as meaning \\"self defence in all its forms\\"; the word was a portmanteau of his own surname and of \\"Jujitsu\\". As detailed in a series of articles Barton-Wright produced for Pearson's Magazine between 1899 and 1901, Bartitsu was largely drawn from the Shinden Fudo Ryu jujutsu of Terajima Kuniichiro (not to be confused with the SFR taijutsu associated with the Bujinkan lineage) and from Kodokan judo. As it became established in London, the art expanded to incorporate combat techniques from other jujutsu styles as well as from British boxing, Swiss schwingen, French savate and a defensive la canne (stick fighting) style that had been developed by Pierre Vigny of Switzerland. Bartitsu also included a comprehensive physical culture training system. In his notes for a lecture delivered to the Japan Society of London in 1901, Barton-Wright wrote:  Bartitsu Club  Between 1899 and 1902, Barton-Wright set about publicising his art through magazine articles, interviews and a series of demonstrations or \\"assaults at arms\\" at various London venues. He established the Bartitsu Academy of Arms and Physical Culture, known as the Bartitsu Club, which was located at 67b Shaftesbury Avenue in Soho. In an article for Sandow's Magazine of Physical Culture vol. 6 (January 1901), journalist Mary Nugent described the Bartitsu Club as \\"...a huge subterranean hall, all glittering, white-tiled walls, and electric light, with 'champions' prowling around it like tigers.\\" Via correspondence with Professor Jigoro Kano, the founder of Kodokan Judo, and other contacts in Japan, Barton-Wright arranged for Japanese jujutsu practitioners Kaneo Tani, Seizo Yamamoto and the nineteen-year-old Yukio Tani to travel to London and serve as instructors at the Bartitsu Club. Kaneo Tani and Yamamoto soon returned to Japan, but Yukio Tani stayed and was shortly joined by another young jujutsuka, Sadakazu Uyenishi. Swiss master-at-arms Pierre Vigny and wrestler Armand Cherpillod were also employed as teachers at the Club. As well as teaching well-to-do Londoners, their duties included performing demonstrations and competing in challenge matches against fighters representing other combat styles. In addition, the Club became the headquarters for a group of fencing antiquarians led by Captain Alfred Hutton and it served as their base for experimenting with historical fencing techniques, which they taught to members of London's acting elite for use in stage combat. It is likely that the actors Esme Beringer and Charles Sefton, as well as fencer Archibald Corble, were among Hutton's historical fencing students at the Bartitsu Club. In mid-1901, the curriculum of Bartitsu was further expanded to include breathing exercises under the tuition of Kate Behnke. As well as the combat gymnasium, the Bartitsu Club incorporated a well-appointed salon equipped with a wide range of electrotherapy machines. The club was organised on the model of the Victorian sporting club; prospective members submitted their applications to a committee, which at one time included both Captain Alfred Hutton and Colonel George Malcolm Fox, former Inspector-General of the British Army's Physical Training Corps. Promoters of the Club included politicians Herbert Gladstone and Lord Alwyne Compton. Bartitsu Club membership included Sir Cosmo Duff Gordon, who was later one of the few adult male survivors of the sinking of the , as well as Captain F.C. Laing of the 12th Bengal Infantry, who subsequently wrote an article on Bartitsu stick fighting techniques which was published in the Journal of the United Service Institution of India. Other members included Messrs. Marshall, Collard, Marchant, Roger Noel, Percy Rolt, Lieutenant Glossop and Captains Ernest George Stenson Cooke and Frank Herbert Whittow, both also members of the London Rifle Brigade School of Arms, under the direction of Captain Hutton; and William Henry Grenfell, the 1st Baron Desborough, who was named as the Club president. Barton-Wright later reported that, during this period, he had challenged and defeated seven larger men within three minutes as part of a Bartitsu demonstration he gave at St. James's Hall. He said this feat earned him a membership in the prestigious Bath Club and also a Royal Command to appear before Edward, Prince of Wales. Barton-Wright then suffered an injury to his hand, due either to a fight in a Kentish country lane or a bicycling accident, which prevented him from appearing before the Prince.  Self-defence  Barton-Wright encouraged members of the Bartitsu Club to study each of the four major hand-to-hand combat styles taught at the club, each of which broadly corresponded to a different \\"range\\" of personal combat. The goal was to master each style well enough that they could be used against the others if needed. This process was similar to the modern concept of cross-training and it can be argued that Bartitsu itself was more in the nature of a cross-training system than a formal martial arts style. Based on Barton-Wright's writings upon this subject, it is evident that Bartitsu placed greatest emphasis upon the Vigny cane fighting system at the striking range and upon jujutsu (and, secondarily, the \\"all-in\\" style of European wrestling) at the grappling range. Savate and boxing methods were used to segue between these two ranges, or as a means of first response should the defender not be armed with a walking stick. These sports were also practised so that Bartitsu students could learn how to defend against them through the use of jujutsu and Vigny stick fighting. The stick fighting component was based on the two fundamental tactics of either feinting/striking pre-emptively or \\"baiting\\" the opponent's strike via a position of invitation. Fighting from the style's characteristic high- and double-handed guard positions, stick strikes and thrusts targeted the opponent's face and head, throat, elbows, hands and wrists, solar plexus, knees and shins. The Bartitsu stick fighter would often incorporate close combat techniques such as trips, throws and takedowns, which probably represent a fusion of the Vigny stick system with jujutsu. Barton-Wright spoke of having modified the techniques of boxing and savate for self-defence purposes, as distinct from academic and fitness training or sporting competition, referring to guards that would cause an attacking boxer to injure his own fists and to defences that would cause an attacking kicker to damage his own leg. Thus, the tactics of the unarmed Bartitsu practitioner were to mount an aggressive defence, employing damaging variations of standard boxing and savate guards, and then to finish the fight with jujutsu, which Barton- Wright evidently viewed as a type of secret weapon during an era in which his Shaftesbury Avenue academy was the only place in England where it could be learned. According to interviewer Mary Nugent, Barton-Wright instituted an unusual pedagogical system whereby students were first required to attend private training sessions before being allowed to join class groups. It is evident that Bartitsu classes included pre-arranged exercises, especially for use in rehearsing those techniques that were too dangerous to be performed at full speed or contact, as well as free-sparring and fencing bouts. According to an anonymous article published in \\"The Sketch\\" of April 10, 1901, these sessions may have involved a type of circuit training in which students would rotate between small group classes taught by each of the specialist instructors. Many Bartitsu self-defence techniques and training sequences were recorded by Barton-Wright himself in his series of articles for Pearson's Magazine.Pearson's, March 1899Pearson's, April 1899Pearson's, February 1901 The specific details of other Bartitsu stick fighting training drills were recorded in Captain Laing's article.  Decline  By mid-1902, the Bartitsu Club was no longer active as a martial arts school. The precise reasons for the Club's closure are unknown, but jujutsu instructor William Garrud subsequently suggested that both the enrolment fees and tuition fees had been too high. It is likely that Barton-Wright had simply overestimated the number of wealthy Londoners who shared his interest in exotic self-defence systems. The last recorded activities of the Bartitsu Club as an entity involved a series of touring exhibitions and contests at venues including Cambridge University, the Oxford Town Hall, the Shorncliffe Army Camp base in Kent, the Mechanics Institute Hall in Nottingham and the Adelphi Theatre in Liverpool between January‚ÄìApril 1902. Subsequently, most of Barton-Wright's former employees, including jujutsuka Yukio Tani and Sadakazu Uyenishi and Swiss self-defence expert Pierre Vigny, established their own self-defence and combat sports gymnasiums in London. After breaking with Barton-Wright, purportedly due to an argument and a fight, Tani also continued his work as a professional music-hall wrestler under the shrewd management of William Bankier, a strength performer and magazine publisher who went by the stage name of \\"Apollo\\". Bankier's promotional efforts helped to spur the international fad for jujutsu that Barton-Wright had begun, and which included the publication of numerous books and magazine articles as well as the establishment of jujutsu schools throughout the Western world. This fad lasted until the beginning of World War I and served to introduce Japanese martial arts into Western popular culture, but Bartitsu per se never again returned to prominence during Barton-Wright's lifetime. \\"Baritsu\\" and Sherlock Holmes Bartitsu might have been completely forgotten if not for a cryptic reference by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle in one of his Sherlock Holmes mystery stories. In 1903 Conan Doyle had revived Holmes for a further story, The Adventure of the Empty House, in which Holmes explained his victory over Professor Moriarty in their struggle at Reichenbach Falls by the use of \\"baritsu, or the Japanese system of wrestling, which has more than once been very useful to me\\". The term \\"baritsu\\" did not exist outside the pages of the English editions of The Adventure of the Empty House and a 1901 Times report titled \\"Japanese Wrestling at the Tivoli\\", which covered a Bartitsu demonstration in London but misspelled the name as baritsu. It is likely that Conan Doyle used the 1901 London Times article as source material, copying the \\"baritsu\\" misspelling verbatim, particularly in that he had Holmes define \\"baritsu\\" as \\"Japanese wrestling\\", which was the same phrase used in the newspaper headline. Given the popularity of the Sherlock Holmes stories, the fact that Holmes credited his survival and victory against Moriarty to \\"baritsu\\", and the fact that E.W. Barton-Wright's martial art and, with it, its name's proper spelling had quickly faded from popular memory, the confusion of names persisted through much of the 20th century. In an article for The Baker Street Journal Christmas Annual of 1958, journalist Ralph Judson correctly identified baritsu with Bartitsu, but Judson's article eventually became obscured. During the 1980s, researchers Alan Fromm and Nicolas Soames re-affirmed the relationship between \\"baritsu\\" and Bartitsu and by the 1990s scholars including Yuichi Hirayama, John Hall, Richard Bowen, and James Webb were able to confidently identify and document the martial art of Sherlock Holmes.  Later life  E.W. Barton- Wright spent the remainder of his career working as a physical therapist specialising in innovative (and sometimes controversial) forms of heat, light, and radiation therapy. He continued to use the name \\"Bartitsu\\" with reference to his various therapeutic businesses. In 1950, he was interviewed by Gunji Koizumi for an article appearing in the Budokwai newsletter, and later that year he was presented to the audience at a Budokwai gathering in London as \\"the pioneer of jiujitsu in Great Britain\\". He died in 1951, at the age of 90, and was buried in what the martial arts historian Richard Bowen described as \\"a pauper's grave.\\"  Legacy  In many ways, E.W. Barton-Wright was a man ahead of his time. He was among the first Europeans known to have studied the Japanese martial arts, and was almost certainly the first to have taught them in Europe, the British Empire or the Americas. Bartitsu was the first martial art to have deliberately combined Asian and European fighting styles towards addressing the problems of civilian/urban self-defence in an \\"unarmed society\\". In this, Barton-Wright anticipated Bruce Lee's Jeet Kune Do approach by over seventy years. A similar philosophy of pragmatic eclecticism was taken up by other early 20th-century European self-defence specialists, including Percy Longhurst, William Garrud and Jean Joseph-Renaud, all of whom had studied with former Bartitsu Club instructors. In 1906, Renaud introduced a similar concept in France named \\"D√©fense Dans la Rue\\" in order to fight the increase of street violence at the time. This art was a mixture of boxing, savate and jiu-jitsu inherited from bartitsu, and was broadened by contemporary authors like √âmile Andr√© and George Dubois, who had been influenced by master-at-arms Joseph Charlemont. In the 1920s, Brazilian physical culture teacher Mario Aleixo published an article for the Eu Sei Tudo magazine about his \\"Defesa Pessoal\\", which mixed capoeira, jiu-jitsu, boxing, Greco-Roman wrestling and Portuguese stick-fighting. Barton-Wright's illustrated article series for Pearson's Magazine popularised self-defence features in newspapers and magazines, which had previously been rare but which became commonplace during the first decade of the 20th century. E.W. Barton- Wright is also remembered as a pioneering promoter of mixed martial arts or MMA contests, in which experts in different fighting styles compete under common rules. Barton-Wright's champions, including Yukio Tani, Sadakazu Uyenishi and Swiss schwingen wrestler Armand Cherpillod enjoyed considerable success in these contests, which anticipated the MMA phenomenon of the 1990s by a hundred years. The Bartitsu Club was among the first schools of its type in Europe to offer classes in women's self-defence, a practice taken up after the Club's demise by students of Yukio Tani and Sadakazu Uyenishi including Edith Margaret Garrud and Emily Watts. Mrs. Garrud established her own jujutsu dojo (school) in London and also taught the art to members of the militant Suffragette movement, including the clandestine \\"Bodyguard\\" unit of the Women's Social and Political Union, establishing an early association between self-defence training and the political philosophy of feminism. Contemporary interest and revival In 2001, the Electronic Journals of Martial Arts and Sciences (EJMAS) web site began to re-publish many of Barton-Wright's magazine articles that had been discovered in the British Library archives by Richard Bowen. Almost immediately, the \\"Self Defence with a Walking Stick\\" articles attracted a minor cult following and the illustrations were reproduced, often with humorous captions or other alterations, on a number of other sites. Also in that year, Bartitsu stick fighting demonstrations were added to the educational displays performed at the Royal Armouries in Leeds, U.K. In 2002, an international association of Bartitsu enthusiasts, known as the Bartitsu Society, was formed to research and then revive E.W. Barton-Wright's \\"New Art of Self Defence\\". The Society approaches Bartitsu research and training via two related fields, those of canonical Bartitsu (the self-defence sequences that were detailed by Barton-Wright and his associates 1899‚Äì1902) and neo- Bartitsu (modern, individualised interpretations drawing from the canon but reinforced by the training manuals produced by former Bartitsu Club instructors and their students between 1899 and the early 1920s). The modern revival aims to both preserve what is known of the canonical syllabus and to continue Barton-Wright's experiments in cross-training/testing between (kick)boxing, jiujitsu and stick fighting as they were practiced circa 1901, on the premise that these experiments were left as a work in progress when the original Bartitsu Club closed down. Thus, the revival is considered to be a deliberately anachronistic, collaborative, open-ended and open source project. Associated interests include the study of the martial arts as Victorian and Edwardian social history. The Bartitsu Society communicates via an email group established by author Will Thomas and individual members offer practical seminars and training courses in Bartitsu fighting techniques. From 2003 onwards, members of the Bartitsu Society began to teach seminar courses in various aspects of the art at stage combat and martial arts conferences throughout the world. Inspired and guided by the Bartitsu Society and the two compendia, Bartitsu training programs have since been launched at the Cumann Bhata Dayton, the Vancouver-based Academie Duello, at the Alte Kampfkunst in Wuppertal, Germany, Briercrest College and Seminary in Caronport, Saskatchewan and at Forteza Fitness and Martial Arts (Ravenswood, Chicago) amongst numerous other locations. In August 2005, the Society published a book, The Bartitsu Compendium, which was edited by Tony Wolf. The Compendium details the complete history of the art as well as a technical curriculum for canonical Bartitsu. The second volume (August 2008) comprises resources for neo-Bartitsu drawn both from Barton-Wright's own writings and from the self-defence manuals produced by his colleagues and their students, including Yukio Tani, William Garrud, H.G. Lang and Jean Joseph Renaud. Proceeds from the sales of the Bartitsu Compendium, the Bartitsu Compendium II, and the Martial Art of Sherlock Holmes DVD have been dedicated to creating a memorial for E.W. Barton-Wright and to furthering the revival of Bartitsu. In September 2006, Bartitsu Society member Kirk Lawson released a DVD entitled Bartitsu ‚Äì the Martial Art of Sherlock Holmes, which is a presentation of Bartitsu techniques as demonstrated at the Spring '06 Cumann Bhata Western Martial Arts Seminar. In October 2006, the Bartitsu Society launched the Bartitsu.org website, which includes information on the history, theory and practice of Barton-Wright's martial art, as well as current events relating to the Bartitsu revival. In 2010, a seminar tour was arranged to raise awareness of Bartitsu. Tony Wolf taught consecutive seminars on the West Coast of the US starting in California and moving to Northwest Fencing Academy and then Academia Duellatoria in Oregon. Seminars were then hosted by the School of Acrobatics and New Circus Arts in Seattle, Washington and at Academie Duello in Vancouver, British Columbia. In August 2009, the Bartitsu Society announced the production of a full-length documentary on E.W. Barton-Wright and his self-defence arts, which was released in March 2011. The first international Bartitsu School of Arms seminar/conference event was held in London, U.K. between August 26‚Äì28, 2011 and the second event was held in Chicago, between 7‚Äì9 September 2012. In 2017, Bartitsu came to the attention of a martial arts instructor in Columbus, Georgia. After researching the combat laboratory methods used by the founder and his instructors to add more defence tactics and skills incorporating more ground defence, additional self-defence moves, and basic knife tactics and defences, he took on his first student. He then founded an academy, christened \\"Neo-Bartitsu Columbus\\", in 2019 and began offering weekly classes through Bishop's TaeKwonDo Plus. In the UK, Sensei Tommy Moore runs the Bartitsu Lab. This Bartitsu club aims to bring together the best of the combat sports and self defence focuses of Bartitsu as part of a modern holistic approach. Articles on various aspects of Bartitsu have been published in journals including Classical Fighting Arts, Western Martial Arts Illustrated, The Journal of Asian Martial Arts, SteamPunk Magazine, Rugged Magazine, Breaking Muscle, The Wall Street Journal, The Atlantic, the Chicago Tribune, The Chap, History Today, de Volkskrant, New City, His Vintage Life, the Epoch Times, Ozy Media and Clarkesworld Magazine. The art has also been showcased on British television in The One Show, Sunday Brunch and in Everybody was Kung Fu Fighting: the Rise of the Martial Arts in Britain, an episode of the Timeshift documentary series on BBC Four.  2011 documentary  Bartitsu: The Lost Martial Art of Sherlock Holmes (2011) is a feature-length documentary detailing the history, decline and modern revival of Bartitsu, with particular reference to its association with Sherlock Holmes. Host Tony Wolf travels between locations in Europe including the Swiss Reichenbach Falls and the adjacent town of Meiringen, London, Haltwhistle, Rome and Amantea, explaining the origins and heyday of Bartitsu via narration, animated graphics, re- enactments, archival photographs and interviews. Interviewees include authors Will Thomas and Neal Stephenson as well as martial arts historians Mark Donnelly, Emelyne Godfrey, Harry Cook and Graham Noble. Major themes include the development of Bartitsu as a confluence of Edwardian interests in Orientalism, physical culture and criminology; the use of jujitsu by the Bodyguards of the radical Suffragette movement in London and subsequent spread of Japanese martial arts through Western popular culture; personality profiles of Barton-Wright himself and the other principal figures of the original Bartitsu craze; and the connection between Bartitsu and Sherlock Holmes' baritsu. Additional footage shot in Italy and the United States illustrates the modern revival of Bartitsu as a recreational martial art. Bartitsu and \\"baritsu\\" in popular culture Conan Doyle's \\"baritsu\\" developed a life of its own during the latter 20th century, and it was duly recorded that fictional heroes including Doc Savage and The Shadow had been initiated into its mysteries; the latter two characters were established as knowing baritsu in a DC Comics crossover that spilled over into The Shadow Strikes. Baritsu has been incorporated into numerous Sherlock Holmes-inspired pastiche novels and short stories and also into the rules of several role-playing games set during the Victorian and Edwardian eras. The manga and anime series Kuroshitsuji (Black Butler) and Dantarian no Shoka (The Mystic Archives of Dantalian) both feature characters who are proficient in baritsu. Cyrus Barker, the protagonist of novelist Will Thomas' Barker and Llewellyn mystery series, is partly inspired by E.W. Barton-Wright, as is the villainous Sir Callum Fielding-Shaw in Adrienne Kress' young adult novel The Friday Society. Richard Ryan, the fight choreographer for the 2009 movie Sherlock Holmes, has described the \\"neo-Bartitsu\\" developed for that project as being a combination of \\"Chinese Boxing (Wing Chun), swordplay and elements of Brazilian Jujitsu.\\" This \\"movie Bartitsu\\" was said to be a modern interpretation of the classic Victorian Bartitsu style. In a 23 December 2009 interview with Vanity Fair magazine, director Guy Ritchie described baritsu as \\"... a form of Jujitsu. This is way before martial arts took off anywhere in Europe. You can actually look it up on the Internet. You‚Äôll see these little men hitting one another with walking sticks. The idea was that you use your opponent‚Äôs strengths against them. With the use of surprise. There‚Äôs all sorts of locks and chokes and various other techniques used to incapacitate someone. There‚Äôs lots of throwing hats at someone‚Äôs eyes, and then striking at them, if you can, with a walking stick.\\" The movie fight choreography included several signature fighting techniques from Barton-Wright's articles, including double-handed thrusts with walking sticks and the use of an overcoat to distract and entangle an adversary. The fight choreography for the 2011 sequel, Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows bore an even closer resemblance to historical Bartitsu. In the DVD commentary for \\"A Scandal in Belgravia\\" (episode one of the second season of the BBC TV series Sherlock), writer Mark Gatiss describes a framed glass sign above the title character's bed as showing \\"the rules of baritsu, the Japanese martial art which got Holmes out of the situation at the Reichenbach Falls in 'The Final Problem'.\\" In fact, the prop sign is a framed Kodokan judo black belt certificate. In the first episode of the third season, Sherlock Holmes alludes to a \\"system of Japanese wrestling\\" as the second of thirteen scenarios that might have allowed him to survive his rooftop encounter with Moriarty. Aiden English and Simon Gotch, known collectively as The Vaudevillains, are professional wrestlers signed to NXT and WWE who incorporate Bartitsu, or \\"Victorian Era Martial Arts\\" as some announcers have described, into their wrestling style mainly with stances and selective attacks. They espouse a gimmick of wrestlers from the early 20th century such as Karl Gotch. In the film Kingsman: The Secret Service, Harry Hart/Galahad (Colin Firth) uses elements of Bartitsu during the pub fight.

It has been augmented with complementary lists that include various other classes of hosts, allowing for customized email rejection by its users. History The SORBS DNSbl project was created in November 2002. It was maintained as a private list until 6 January 2003 when the DNSbl was officially launched to the public. The list consisted of 78,000 proxy relays and rapidly grew to over 3,000,000 alleged compromised spam relays. In November 2009 SORBS was acquired by GFI Software, to enhance their mail filtering solutions. In July 2011 SORBS was re-sold to Proofpoint, Inc. DUHL SORBS adds IP ranges that belong to dialup modem pools, dynamically allocated wireless, and DSL connections as well as DHCP LAN ranges by using reverse DNS PTR records, WHOIS records, and sometimes by submission from the ISPs themselves. This is called the DUHL or Dynamic User and Host List. SORBS does not automatically rescan DUHL listed hosts for updated rDNS so to remove an IP address from the DUHL the user or ISP has to request a delisting or rescan. If other blocks are scanned in the region of listings and the scan includes listed netspace, SORBS automatically removes the netspace marked as static. Matthew Sullivan of SORBS proposed in an Internet Draft that generic reverse DNS addresses include purposing tokens such as static or dynamic, abbreviations thereof, and more. That naming scheme would have allowed end users to classify IP addresses without the need to rely on third party lists, such as the SORBS DUHL. The Internet Draft has since expired. Generally it is considered more appropriate for ISPs to simply block outgoing traffic to port 25 if they wish to prevent users from sending email directly, rather than specifying it in the reverse DNS record for the IP. SORBS' dynamic IP list originally came from Dynablock but has been developed independently since Dynablock stopped updating in December 2003. Note that there is no mechanism that allows a third party to check whether an IP address was dynamically assigned, so there is no way to verify whether a listed IP really belongs to a dynamically assigned range. It is not uncommon to find IPs listed as dynamic that are actually being statically assigned by the ISP. Also note that the DUHL list does not detect SPAM, or suspicious activity, so it would be advisable to never block mail just because an IP is listed there, but as part of a more complex and intelligent anti-spam check.http://www.sorbs.net/listing/aboutlistings.shtmlhttp://www.sorbs.net/delisting/dul.shtmlhttps://wordtothewise.com/2010/12/gfi- sorbs-considered-harmful- part-2/https://forums.whirlpool.net.au/archive/1549233https://forums.whirlpool.net.au/archive/1549195https://lists.debian.org/debian- isp/2006/07/msg00056.htmlhttps://forums.whirlpool.net.au/archive/441970 Spam traps IP addresses that send spam to SORBS spamtraps are added to their spam database automatically or manually. In order to prevent being blacklisted, major free email services such as Gmail, Yahoo, and Hotmail, as well as major ISPs now implement outgoing anti-spam countermeasures. Gmail, for example, continues to get listed and delisted https://support.google.com/mail/answer/26904?hl=enhttp://mxtoolbox.com/SuperTool.aspx?action=blacklist%3a209.85.215.50&run;=toolpage because they refuse abuse reports.https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!topic/gmail/Rr23mj9mtus However, smaller networks may still be unwittingly blocked. Because spammers use viruses, malware, and rootkits to force compromised computers to send spam, SORBS lists the IP addresses of servers that the infected system uses to send its spam. Because of this, larger ISPs and corporate networks have started blocking port 25 in order to prevent these compromised computers from being able to send email except through designated email servers. Preemptive listings SORBS maintains a list of networks and addresses that it believes are assigned dynamically to end users/machines, it refers to this list as the DUHL (Dynamic User/Host List). The list includes wide networks of computers sharing the same IP address using network address translation which are also affected (If one computer behind the NAT is allowed to send spam, the whole network will be blacklisted if the NAT IP is ever blacklisted.) This is a common method of pre-emptive blocking as most legitimate mail servers are hosted in data centers designed and provisioned for such services, the legitimate mail servers that are affected by such listings are most commonly home hobbyists running their own mail servers. The Spamhaus Policy Block List (PBL) is another such pre-emptive list which does not just list dynamic hosts, but also blocks hosts it believes should not be sending email directly to third-party servers. SORBS also operate another list which is similar to the Spamhaus PBL called the NoServers list, which is wholly maintained by the network administrators of the respective networks and is therefore theoretically False Positive free. Escalated listings SORBS has been accused of deliberately targeting innocent users through escalated listings. Its website describes the process as follows: \\"An escalated listing on the other hand is where a whole network of IP addresses is listed in SORBS and all hosts and IPs (whether assigned to a single customer or multiple) are listed and therefore blocked or result in spam folder issues. Why does SORBS create escalated listings? The simple answer is to stop spam. You ask, 'How does listing innocent IPs help stop spam?' Simple, some providers don‚Äôt care about spam.\\"talkback.sorbs.net. talkback.sorbs.net (21 June 2010). Retrieved on 28 November 2011. There have been many heated discussions on this practice as often it would appear that email users who are caught in this trap have no recourse, because the listing applies to a block of IP addresses, and they are unable to release their own IP address.  False positives  Due to the automation of spamtraps SORBS regularly lists the addresses of legitimate mail servers. Therefore, SORBS should not be configured as a single blocking test in a spam filter, but in combination with other spam indicators. Changes Since the acquisition by Proofpoint, Inc. full-time support staff have been employed to answer delisting queries; however the first round of answers to support requests are answered automatically by robot systems.

He played an instrumental role in the establishment of national rights for Romanians in Transylvania (part of the Habsburg Monarchy at the time of his life). Life He was born as Ioan Micu (Inocen»õiu being his clergy name, and Klein the German translation of his surname, sometimes rendered back into Romanian transcription as Clain) in Sadu, nowadays in Sibiu County, in 1692 from a lower-class family. He studied by the Jesuits in Cluj and trained in theology in Trnava. On 18 November 1728, following the death of previous bishop Ioan Giurgiu Patachi, the electoral synod convened and Micu resulted the more voted, even if he was young and he had not yet terminated his studies. Accordingly, on 12 July 1729 the Habsburg monarch, Emperor Charles VI, designated him as new bishop of FƒÉgƒÉra»ô. On 5 September 1729 he was awarded the title of Baron, and on 23 September of that year, Micu became a priest and immediately he joined the Basilian Order. Pope Clement XII confirmed him on 11 September 1730, and accordingly he was consecrated a bishop on 5 November 1730 by Gennadius Bizanczy, the Eparch of Mukachevo. From Mukachevo he moved to Vienna, where he pleaded the Emperor for the rights of Transylvanian people. He made his formal enthronement in FƒÉgƒÉra»ô on 28 September 1732, and, following his insistence, on 11 December 1732 he was given a seat in the Transylvanian Diet. Immediately after his enthronement, he summoned an ecclesiastic synod which issued 20 decrees on administrative, disciplinary, sacramentary issues. In 1737, he moved the bishopric seat from FƒÉgƒÉra»ô to Blaj, and laid the foundations to the local cathedral in 1741. Letter with signature: Joannes In[nocentius] L[iber] B[aron] Klein Vescovo di Fogarasi As a member of the Diet (Parliament) of Transylvania, Inocen»õiu Micu began to press the Habsburg Monarchy to fulfill the Agreement that conversion to Greek Catholicism would bring with it Roman Catholic-like privileges for Romanian inhabitants also, and an end to serfdom. First pressing for rights for clergy and converts, he soon began to petition for freedom for all Romanians. Micu petitioned the Habsburg court for over forty years to this end. His perseverance ultimately made both the Austrian Empress Maria Theresia and Transylvania's Diet declare themselves offended - the Hungarian majority in the Diet opposed the liberation of the work force or the awarding of political rights to Romanians (Vlachs), considered by the Diet as \\"moth for the cloth\\". Exiled in 1744, Micu moved to Rome and he had to resign a few years later, on 7 May 1751. He died in Rome 17 years later, on 22 September 1768.

She serves as a member of Batman's team Outsiders. Fictional character biography =Kingdom Come= Nightstar first appears in Kingdom Come #1 (May 1996) when she is seen in a street battle. Nightstar's mother Koriand'r had died from a circulatory illness. Most of the supervillains of the world have been eliminated so the new generation of heroes \\"fight simply to fight, their only foes each other\\".remarks made by Kingdom Come narrator Norman McCay Nightstar and others are battling it out, causing destruction in the neighbourhood and getting innocents caught in the crossfire. They only pause to learn of a major disaster in the state of Kansas in which a similar battle has led to the deaths of one million people. Superman, who has been in self-imposed exile, returns to reform the Justice League and restore order. Among his recruits is Nightstar's father Dick Grayson, who adopts the identity of Red Robin. Nightstar is at first very dismissive of this move. She is next seen in conversation with Avia, daughter of Mister Miracle and Big Barda in an underground bar.Kingdom Come #2 Annotations for \\"Page 26 (84)\\" and \\"Page 29 (87)\\" ‚Äî the bar includes many characters of non-DC origin such as Sherlock Holmes, Cesar the Somnambulist from The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari, and super-hero versions of the disco group Village People Superman appears and makes a powerful recruitment speech for the Justice League. Nightstar is impressed but, unlike Avia, she does not fall in with Superman. Instead she throws in with Batman, who, through Dick Grayson, is her adopted grandfather. So do many other progeny of the Leaguers, including the daughters of Speedy, Aqualad and Flash and the son of Donna Troy. Batman, who no longer uses the cover of his alter-ego Bruce Wayne, has formed an alliance with Lex Luthor's Mankind Liberation Front in order to counter what they see as the overbearing might of the Justice League. During a meeting between their groups, Nightstar encounters Ibn Al Xu'ffasch, Batman's son but also the heir to the Dark Knight's enemy Ra's al Ghul. The moment they meet, Nightstar and Ibn have an undisguised attraction for one another.Kingdom Come #3 Annotations for \\"Page 22 (132)\\" Batman's real agenda however is to expose Luthor and his schemes to cause more chaos to the world. Just as Luthor is about to unleash this chaos, Batman and his followers overpower him and his associates--with the notable exception of Ibn, who is later seen arm in arm with Nightstar. The League has built a special prison to hold rebellious superhumans, but the prison is breached and an all-out battle ensues between the prisoners and the Leaguers. Batman's Outsiders join in the fight, during which Red Robin (Richard Grayson) is seriously injured by an enemy called 666. Nightstar, who has been fighting Green Lantern, gasps in horror as this happens,Kingdom Come, page 172 of paperback edition screams in agony as she cradles her father's bloodied face, and then flies him off to safety. Wayne Manor is later converted into a hospital where the victims from the battle are treated. Nightstar oversees a reconciliation between her father and grandfather. Justice Society of America (vol. 3) #22 (2009) reveals that she would eventually marry Ibn Al Xu'ffasch and have a daughter and son. =The Kingdom= In The Kingdom, the mini-series that serves as a sequel to Kingdom Come, her name is revealed to be Mar'i. Mary is the name of her paternal grandmother, Mary Loyd Grayson. She is also shown to be a leader of her generation, an active Titan whom others look to for inspiration and solution, a role once filled by her father Richard Grayson. During the series and related events, Nightstar becomes part of a small super-team investigating reality disturbances in Planet Krypton, a restaurant owned by Booster Gold. This leads to a battle with Gog and the eventual discovery of Hypertime. In The Kingdom: Nightstar, it is revealed that she has an interest in botany, a fear of death, and works with security at Green Lantern Alan Scott's space station The Green. Powers and abilities Like her mother, Nightstar is capable of atmospheric flight, has super-strength, super speed, endurance and it can absorb star energy to project in powerful bursts. Her eyes are green and pupilless. Being the daughter of a human and an alien, she is a hybrid with powers. Relationships with other heroes Friends include Olivia Queen (Black Canary III, daughter of Dinah Lance and Oliver Queen), Avia (daughter of Mister Miracle and Big Barda), and Manotaur.

However, standards like G.hn might deliver all these services on a common technology.  Quadruple play  A so-called quadruple play (or quad play) service integrates mobility as well, often by supporting dual mode mobile plus hotspot-based phones that shift from GSM to Wi-Fi when they come in range of a home wired for triple-play service. Typical Generic Access Network services of this kind, such as Rogers Home Calling Zone (Rogers is an incumbent in the Canadian market), allow the caller to enter and leave the range of their home Wi-Fi network, and only pay GSM rates for the time they spend outside the range. Calls at home are routed over the IP network and paid at a flat rate per month. No interruption or authorization for the shift is required‚Äîsoft handoff takes place automatically as many times as the caller enters or leaves the range. CATV By about 2000, cable TV companies were in a technical position to offer triple play over one physical medium to a large number of their customers, as their networks already had sufficient bandwidth to carry hundreds of video channels. Cable's main competition for television in North America came from satellites, which could not compete for voice and interactive broadband due to the latency imposed by physical laws on a geosynchronous satellite‚Äîsometimes up to one full second of delay between speaking and being heard. Cable's main competition for voice and Internet access came from telcos, which were not yet able to compete for television in most markets because DSL over most local loops could not provide enough bandwidth. As an interim marketing move while they installed fiber closer to the customer, telcos such as AT&T; did co-promotion deals with satellite TV providers to sell television, telephone, and Internet access services bundled for billing purposes, although the services provided through a satellite link and the services provided through a phone line are not technically related. Telcos that own wireless phone networks also included those as part of such billing-only bundles because most cable companies do not own wireless networks.  Deployments  The first triple-play deployment was by the US operator Cox Communications in 1997, delivered via a Hybrid fiber-coaxial network using digital and analog TV set top boxes, digital telephony devices from Arris International, and a cable modem system from Motorola.COX COMMUNICATIONS MARKS 10TH ANNIVERSARY OF VIDEO, TELEPHONE AND INTERNET BUNDLE, \\"Cox Newsroom\\", November 27, 2007, Accessed February 23, 2020. Triple-play services in the United States are offered by cable television operators as well as by telecommunication operators, who directly compete with one another. Providers expect that an integrated solution will increase opportunity costs for customers who may want to choose between service providers, permit more cross-selling, and hold off the power companies deploying G.hn and IEEE P1901 technology with its radically superior service and deployment characteristics for at least another decade or so. Outside the United States, notably in Ecuador, Pakistan, India, Japan, and China, power companies have generally been more successful in leapfrogging legacy technologies. In Switzerland and Sweden, dark fiber is available reliably to homes at tariffed rates (in Switzerland four dark fibres are deployed to each home) supporting speeds in excess of 40 Gbit/s‚Äîonly to the local caches, however, as backhaul cannot typically support more than 10 Mbit/s connections to global services. Since 2007, access providers in Italy have been participating in an initiative called Fiber for Italy, which aims to build an infrastructure that can deliver 100 Mbit/s symmetrical bandwidth to consumers, in order to enable the delivery of triple- and quad-play services.Fastweb to launch 100 Mbit/s  Other triple-play deployments include Deutsche Telekom, Vmedia, Telecom Italia, Swisscom, Telekom Austria, and Telus. Regulation There are multiple and intense regulatory battles over triple-play services, as incumbent telcos and incumbent cable operators attempt to keep out new competitors; since both industries historically have been regulated monopolies, regulatory capture has long been as much a core competency for them as have been prices and terms of service. Cable providers want to compete with telcos for local voice service, but want to discourage telcos from competing with them for television service. Incumbent telcos want to deliver television service but want to block competition for voice service from cable operators. Both industries cloak their demands for favorable regulatory treatment in claims that their positions favor the public interests. In March 2007 cable operators scored a major victory when the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) overruled two state public service commissions by ruling that incumbent local exchange carriers must connect to VoIP services. Regulators in South Carolina and Nebraska had been allowing local telcos to block Time Warner Cable from offering local phone service in their states. In the other direction, also in March 2007, the FCC limited the powers of municipalities and states over telcos that want to compete with cable TV companies., Information Week. Consumer groups expressed displeasure with this FCC ruling because they fear telcos will only offer service to the richest neighborhoods, which is a major point of contention between telcos wanting to offer television service and local governments is that local governments typically impose \\"build-out\\" and community access requirements so a cable provider is forced to wire the entire town within a specified period of time. All three Republican members of the FCC voted for this decision, while both Democratic members voted against it and one predicted either U.S. Congress or the courts would overturn it. In October 2007, the Hartford Courant reported that Connecticut regulators have ordered AT&T; to stop signing up new customers for its IPTV service until they got a cable license; AT&T; said they would fight this decision in court. Telco For telephone local exchange carriers (LEC), triple play is delivered using a combination of optical fiber and digital subscriber line (DSL) technologies (called fiber in the loop) to its residential base. This configuration uses fiber communications to reach distant locations and uses DSL over an existing POTS twisted pair cable as last mile access to the subscriber's home. Cable television operators use a similar architecture called hybrid fibre coaxial (HFC) to provide subscriber homes with broadband, but use the available coaxial cable rather than a twisted pair for the last mile transmission standard. Subscriber homes can be in a residential environment, multi-dwelling units, or even in business offices. Using DSL over twisted pair, television content is delivered using IPTV where the content is streamed to the subscriber in an MPEG-2 transport format. On an HFC network, television may be a mixture of analog and digital television signals. A set- top box (STB) is used at the subscriber's home to allow the subscriber to control viewing and order new video services such as \\"movies on demand\\". Access to the Internet is provided through ATM or DOCSIS, typically provided as an Ethernet port to the subscriber. Voice service can be provided using a traditional plain old telephone service (POTS) interface as part of the legacy telephone network or can be delivered using voice over IP (VoIP). In an HFC network, voice is delivered using VoIP. Some service providers are also rolling out Ethernet to the home networks and fiber to the home, which support triple-play services and bypass the disadvantages of adapting broadband transmission to a legacy network. This is particularly common in greenfield developments where the capital expenditure is reduced by deploying one network to deliver all services. For existing multiple-dwelling-unit (MDU) buildings, where running fiber to each unit may not be feasible, telcos often use VDSL to connect individual units over existing copper through a central optical network terminal located in the existing telco closet. Over such a short distance, DSL can deliver much higher bitrates than is possible running DSL over the local loop from the nearest central office (as is common with basic DSL).  Wireless  Triple play has led to the term \\"quadruple play\\", where wireless communications is introduced as another medium to deliver video, Internet access, and voice telephone service. Advances in both CDMA and GSM standards, utilizing 3G, 4G, or UMTS allows the service operators to enter into quadruple play and gain competitive advantage against other providers. The grouping together of services (as triple or quadruple play) is called multi-play. Other advanced technologies such as WiMax or 802.16 has allowed new market entrants to achieve triple play. Many speculate that this means serious, new competition for established providers of bundled telecommunications services.  Power integration  These services can be delivered with a BPL network using technologies such as IEEE P1901/G.hn. Since the devices all rely on AC power (or DC power via 802.3af or 802.3at which rely on AC power at the PoE hub), connecting them with only one cable each for both power and gigabit data cuts wiring costs, and most rooms are already wired for power. Business The challenges in offering triple play are mostly associated with determining the right business model, backend processes, customer care support, and economic environment, rather than technology. For example, using the right billing platform to address a variety of subscriber demographics or having the appropriate subscriber density to financially justify introduction of the service are a few factors that affect decisions to offer triple play. In addition to the challenges mentioned above, there are a number of technical challenges with regards to the rollout of triple-play services. Voice, video, and high-speed data all have different characteristics and place different burdens on the network that provides access to these services. Voice services are greatly affected by jitter, whereas packet loss has a greater effect on video and data services. In order to use a shared network resource such as cable or DSL, the service provider may use network equipment that employs quality-of-service mechanisms to adjust to the requirements of the different services.

For example, if a person dies without a will, his or her heirs are determined by operation of law. Similarly, if a person marries or has a child after his or her will has been written, the law writes this pretermitted spouse or pretermitted heir into the will if no provision for this situation was specifically included. Adverse possession, in which title to land passes because non-owners have occupied it for a certain period of time, is another important right that vests by operation of law.See West's Encyclopedia of America Law, edition 2 (The Gale Group, Inc., 2008); John Bouvier, A Law Dictionary, Adapted to the Constitution and Laws of the United States (1856). Events that occur by operation of law do so because courts have determined over time that the rights thus created or transferred represent what the intent of the party would have been, had they thought about the situation in advance; or because the results fulfilled the settled expectations of parties with respect to their property; or because legal instruments of title provide for these transfers to occur automatically on certain named contingencies. Rights that arise by operation of law often arise by design of certain contingencies set forth in a legal instrument. If a life estate is created in a tract of land, and the person by whose life the estate is measured dies, title to the property reverts to the original grantor ‚Äì or, possibly, to the grantor's legal heirs ‚Äì by operation of law. Nothing needs to be put in writing to affirm that this will happen. Joint tenants with rights of survivorship create a similar situation. Joint tenants with rights of survivorship deeds are always taken in equal shares, and when one joint tenant dies, the other tenants equally acquire title by virtue of the terms of the conveyance itself, by operation of law. Rights or liabilities created by operation of law can also be created involuntarily, because a contingency occurs for which a party has failed to plan (e.g. failure to write a will); or because a specific condition exists for a set period of time (e.g. adverse possession of property or creation of an easement; failure of a court to rule on a motion within a certain period automatically defeating the motion; failure of a party to act on a filed complaint within a certain time causing dismissal of the case); or because an existing legal relationship is invalidated, but the parties to that relationship still require a mechanism to distribute their rights (e.g. under the Uniform Commercial Code, where a contract for which both parties have performed partially is voided, the court will create a new contract based on the performance that has actually been rendered and containing reasonable terms to accommodate the expectations of the parties). Because title to property that arises by operation of law is usually contingent upon proof of certain contingencies, and title records may not contain evidence of those contingencies, legal proceedings are sometimes required to turn title that arises by operation of law into marketable title.

It is one of three stations in Barry. This one, Barry Town, is preceded by Barry Docks and Cadoxton stations on the Barry Branch which runs from Cardiff Central to a fourth station at Barry Island, the terminus. Barry is also the junction at the start of the Vale of Glamorgan Line which serves Rhoose and Llantwit Major and terminates at . Passenger services are operated by Transport For Wales as part of the Valley Lines network. History The station in 1962 The station in July 2007 Although Barry station was the terminus of the original Barry Railway, it was not among the first stations to open. The first passenger services ran between Cogan and Barry Docks starting on 20 December 1888 along the line known as the Cogan branch; the main line ran from Cadoxton South Junction to Trehafod in the Rhondda. The extension of services to Barry did not happen until 8 February 1889. It remained a terminus for Cardiff services until the Barry Railway became a constituent member of the Great Western Railway in 1922. However, the line was extended to Barry Island on 3 August 1896 and a good proportion of the passenger trains terminated there. Barry was also the terminus of the Vale of Glamorgan Railway which opened on 1 December 1897 though was operated by the Barry Railway.The Vale of Glamorgan Line Past the Tracks; Retrieved 20 July 2017 Trains ran from Bridgend where the Barry Railway had its own platform and passengers wishing to travel to Cardiff had to change trains at Barry. The Vale of Glamorgan branch was closed to passengers on 15 June 1964 but after much demand, was successfully re-opened on 10 June 2005 with Rhoose station also providing a bus link to Cardiff International Airport. Both Rhoose and Llantwit Major station platforms were re-established in a different form with staggered platforms at Rhoose and opposite each other at Llantwit Major and with a pedestrian footbridge linking them. Facilities The station has a staffed ticket office on platform 1, which is open six days per week from early morning until mid-afternoon. A ticket machine is available for use outside these times and for collecting pre-paid tickets. A waiting room is available in the main building when the station is staffed, with a shelter on the island platform. Other amenities include a cafe, payphone and toilets. Train running information is offered via CIS displays, automated announcements, a help point on platform 1 and timetable posters. Station footbridge that is scheduled to be replaced (September 2019) As at October 2019, step-free access is limited to platform 1, as the only route to platforms 2 and 3 is via a stepped footbridge. Disabled passengers are advised to travel to Barry station via Barry Island if arriving from Cardiff or if wishing to travel to Barry Island from Barry, to travel first to Barry Docks or if from Bridgend, to alight at Barry Docks station and change platforms for Barry Island.Barry station facilities National Rail Enquiries To alleviate the problem of disabled persons or persons with heavy luggage having to use the stations in this way, by October 2019 it was planned to provide a new footbridge with combined lifts at Barry station by 2020 and at Cadoxton such a provision was almost complete by October 2019, where only a subway had been the means of crossing between platforms after June 1964 due to a foot crossing previously being provided but removed for safety reasons. (The same had applied at Barry station). Services The station has a basic four trains per hour service (Mon-Sat) to eastbound and three per hour to Barry Island and one per hour to westbound.

Regeneration The rebuilt station showing the new Platform 3 As part of a ¬£200m regeneration scheme to boost train capacity in Cardiff and the surrounding areas, Barry now has a third platform (Platform 3) which is now only used by down or sometimes up trains to & from Barry Island.\\"Improving the Railway Around Cardiff\\" Arriva Trains Wales website article\\"Rail improvements to boost economy in Barry and Cardiff\\" Collins, Peter; Wales Online article 5 August 2014; Retrieved 4 May 2016 Up trains can and still do use the Barry station up platform (1) generally but as the new platform line is now bi-directional and signalled as such, it is also sometimes used for up passenger trains which can start from here if a 'catch-up' in the timetable is required, thereby cutting out a reversal at Barry Island. The laying of the bi-directional platform line had to be performed while essential signal wires and point rodding lying 1.75m from the platform wall, was still in place. The 'new' platform support blockwork was thus constructed so that its finished edge now lies 2.75m from the former obsolete platform edge. During the months of construction, Barry signal box was taken out of use making the signal pull-wires and point rodding redundant and by week ending 28 March 2014, the box was demolished. Having removed the latter components, the void between old and new platform edges was backfilled, tarmacked over and new coping platform stones laid. Prior to 1964, this platform was that of platform 4, platform 1 previously being the Bay platform where trains to Pontypridd via Wenvoe or sometimes Cardiff started. That area is now a Park & Ride facility. Platform 1 serves all up trains to Cardiff and beyond from either Barry Island or Bridgend. Platform 2 now serves only trains to Bridgend as the line to Barry Island from the junction south of platform 2 was curtailed during the remodelling project and acts as a safety overrun with a buffer stop 100m from the down facing points.

Converse, was launched 28 November 1919 by Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corporation, Squantum, Massachusetts; sponsored by Miss E. C. Colt; commissioned 28 April 1920, Lieutenant Commander E. G. Haas in command; and reported to the Atlantic Fleet. Converse was placed in reserve status 11 June 1920 operating in New England waters with 50 percent of her complement on training cruises for members of the Naval Reserve. After testing the Arma gyro compass, Converse operated from 15 November 1921 with Scouting Fleet. Returned to full commission 1 July 1922, she cruised on the east coast and in Caribbean waters. Converse with Lieutenant Commander A. Mc Glassen commanding, sailed from Newport, Rhode Island 18 June 1924 to join U.S. Naval Forces in European Waters, visiting Antwerp, Amsterdam, Cherbourg and Southampton before returning to New York 16 July 1925. In 1926 and 1927 Converse again served as training ship for the Naval Reserve making two cruises each summer to Newport and the Caribbean. From 23 February 1927 she tested the Flettner rudder during her cruising. In 1928 Converse was designated as Experimental Ship, Scouting Fleet. She made test runs for the Bureau of Engineering in the Potomac River and Chesapeake Bay, then fired experimental torpedoes at Newport and Charleston, South Carolina. She rejoined her squadron at Norfolk, Virginia 4 January 1929 for regular operations until decommissioned at Philadelphia 1 May 1930.

The hospital was founded by the Lithuanian Roman Catholic Charities, a lay non-profit organization which entrusted the Sisters of Saint Casimir to manage it. Founded in 1928, Holy Cross Hospital is a not- for-profit neighborhood health system located in 3 locations throughout Chicago's southwest neighborhoods and suburbs. It receives the highest number of ambulance runs per year of any other hospital in the state of Illinois. The hospital is accredited by the American Osteopathic Association's Healthcare Facilities Accreditation Program. In March 2009, Holy Cross completed an expansion of its emergency department, with the addition of 14 monitored patient rooms. In December 2010, Chicago Cardinal Francis Eugene George, OMI, announced that Holy Cross Hospital would become a for-profit Catholic hospital, a seemingly counter-intuitive move, and be acquired by Vanguard Health Systems of Nashville, Tennessee. It would still be considered Catholic because the Sisters would still have some reserved powers and the hospital would have to comply with the Ethical and Religious Directives for Catholic Health Care Systems, and because the Archbishop and the Holy See both had approved the unique transaction, given that no suitable Catholic or non- Catholic not-for-profit partner could be found. However, in August 2011 the transaction was cancelled, with both parties citing a downturn in the economy, as well as changes in Medicare and Medicaid, as the major factors for dissolving the partnership. In early 2013, Holy Cross completed a merger with Sinai Health System, which operates Mount Sinai Medical Center in West Side, Chicago. Because the two non-profits had merged their resources, Sinai Health System was not required to pay any monies to acquire Holy Cross.  Trauma center  On September 10, 2015, a partnership between the University of Chicago and Sinai Health Systems was announced, in which the current Holy Cross Hospital campus would undergo 40 million dollars' worth of renovations and become Chicago's first South Side adult Level 1 trauma center since 1991. The state-of-the art adult Level 1 trauma center that was to open at Holy Cross Hospital was to be a joint effort of Sinai Health System and University of Chicago Medicine. Sinai Health System was to furnish specialists involved in trauma care, including emergency department physicians, anesthesiologists and nursing staff, along with on-site trauma care support services at Holy Cross Hospital. In addition, University of Chicago Medicine would have provided specialists dedicated to trauma care, plus neurologists, neurosurgeons, orthopedic surgeons, plastic surgeons, radiologists and urologists. On December 17, 2015, the University of Chicago announced that it had reversed course and that the new adult trauma center would now be located on the University of Chicago campus in Hyde Park instead of at Holy Cross Hospital. In that way, the University of Chicago would offer an integrated program of Level 1 trauma care for both children and adults, in addition to its existing Burn and Complex Wound Center.

Vol. 14. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1912. 28 July 2019 Roman Catholicism, Lutheranism and Anglicanism all recognize Third Orders. They were a twelfth-century adaptation of the medieval monastic confraternities. Members of third orders, are known as tertiaries (Latin tertiarii, from tertius, third). In some cases, they may belong to a religious institute (a \\"congregation\\") that is called a \\"third order regular\\".Orlando O. Esp√≠n, James B. Nickoloff, An Introductory Dictionary of Theology and Religious Studies (Liturgical Press 2007 ), p. 1363 Roman Catholic canon law states: \\"Associations whose members share in the spirit of some religious institute while in secular life, lead an apostolic life, and strive for Christian perfection under the higher direction of the same institute are called third orders or some other appropriate name.\\"  Name  Religious orders that arose in the 12th-13th centuries often had a first order (the male religious, who were generally the first established), the second order (nuns, established second), and then the third order of laity who were established third. Saint Francis of Assisi, for example, is said to have established the Friars Minor, the Poor Clares, and the Third Order of Saint Francis. The name \\"tertiary\\" comes from the Latin tertiarius meaning basically \\"third\\". Hence it has been used for centuries to denote those who belonged to a third order. Tertiaries are those persons who live according to the Third Rule of religious orders, either outside of a monastery in the world, or in a religious community. The idea which forms the basis of this institute is in general this: that persons who on account of certain circumstances cannot enter a religious order, strictly so-called, may, nevertheless, as far as possible enjoy the advantages and privileges of religious orders. This is most clearly expressed in the Rule of the Third Order of St. Francis which, although not the oldest, has, nevertheless, become the model for the rule of almost all other Third Orders. Tertiaries are divided into Regular and Secular.Heckmann, Ferdinand. \\"Tertiaries.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 14. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1912. 28 July 2019 In some cases the members of a third order, wishing to live in a more monastic and regulated way of life, became \\"regulars\\" (religious living under a rule, in Latin, regula) as members of a religious institute. These religious institutes or \\"congregations\\" are classified as belonging to the third order regular.  History  The old monastic orders had attached to their abbeys confraternities of lay men and women, going back in some cases to the 8th century. The Confraternity Book of Durham is extant and embraces some 20,000 names in the course of eight centuries. Emperors and kings and the most illustrious men in church and state were commonly confraters of one or other of the great Benedictine abbeys. The confraters and consorors were made partakers in all the religious exercises and other good works of the community to which they were affiliated, and they were expected in return to protect and forward its interests; but they were not called upon to follow any special rule of life. The general idea of lay people affiliated to religious orders, such as the Benedictine Oblates or confraters developed as founders and benefactors of monasteries were received into spiritual fellowship, and later clothed in death in some religious habit. So too the Templars had a whole system whereby layfolk could partake in some sort in their privileges and in the material administration of their affairs. But the essential nature of the tertiary is really an innovation of the thirteenth century. At that date many of the laity, impatient of the indolent and sometimes scandalous lives of the clergy in lower Europe, were seized with the idea of reforming Christendom by preaching. This admirable intention caused the rise of among others, the Fratres Humiliati. The Humiliati soon became suspect and were forbidden by Pope Lucius III to preach, until in 1207 Pope Innocent III gave a section of them permission to resume their work, provided that they limited themselves to moral questions and did not venture on doctrinal subjects. Some became priests, were gathered into a cloister, and took up religious life. Others remained outside, yet spiritually dependent on the clerical portion, and for the first time called a Third Order. The Humiliati seem to have been the first to have 'tertiaries' in the twelfth century. These lived a rule of life within the world. The name was used to a great extent in the Franciscan Order, which possibly had the most popular third order. Other orders too had tertiaries such as the Trinitarians and the Dominicans. These were followed over time by a number of others such as the Carmelites, Servites, Augustinians, Augustinian Recollects, Discalced Carmelites and others. But by whatever name they were called in the inception, there have been lay persons who have professed to live according to either the Rule of the brothers adapted to their secular life or a rule drawn up particularly for them. They shared the same spirituality, the same superiors, and even aspects of the same habit such as the scapular. Eventually, the name \\"tertiary\\" became popularized and attached to all who lived in this way. There have been a number of beatified or canonized tertiaries. With the advent of the Second Vatican Council came an elaboration of the lay vocation. The lay vocation is a vocation distinct from that of the consecrated state. It involves the sanctification of ordinary life, of one's work, of family life, of all the various secular occupations. It is the leaven in the midst of the world to order the temporal world to God. As the various third orders secular began to look at each of their houses after the Council they began to revise their Rules and Statutes. The Orders submitted their new Statutes or Rules or Constitutions to the Holy See for review and approbation. Thus the new Statutes etc. are steeped in the doctrine of the Council regarding the universal call to holiness and the theology of the lay vocation including the secular character of the laity. Various Orders have opted to change the name from \\"Third Order Secular\\" to \\"Secular Order\\" (or at least add it to usage) to emphasize the secular nature of the Order or they used the term \\"Lay or Laity\\" to the same effect. \\"Third order\\" and \\"tertiary\\" is still used but other names were added or used in a formal sense. The various documents show how the laity of the various Orders are part of the Order (or family etc.) but fully within their particular lay and secular state. They show how tertiaries are to live fully their Christian lay vocation, as well as how they are to live the charism of the Order they belong to within secular life. They also provide various means to tending towards holiness in the midst of the world, which very much is part of the vocation of the tertiary‚Äîto strive for Christian perfection (CIC 303). = Historical third orders secular of the Catholic Church (all still in existence) = * Third Order of Augustinian Recollects * Third Order of Saint Augustine * Oblates of Saint Benedict * Secular Order of Discalced Carmelites * Third Order of Saint Dominic * Third Order of Saint Francis * Secular Franciscan Order * Third Order of Mercy * Third Order of Minims * Third Order Secular of the Most Holy Trinity * Third Order of Saint Norbert * Third Order of Our Lady of Mount Carmel * Association of Salesian Cooperators * Third Order of Servites There also are third or secular orders in the Protestant denominations, such as the Anglican and Episcopal Church.  Organisation  Members of third orders are thus either (a) regulars, living in common under a religious rule of life, or (b) seculars, living in the world. The regulars take the three canonical religious vows; the seculars make promises, which are not considered binding under pain of sin, as are the vows of religious institutes, or in some cases may take private vows of obedience and chastity or in some cases even poverty, chastity and obedience (all according to their lay state).Cf. Angelus a S.S. Corde, O.C.D., \\"Manuale juris communis Regularium\\", Ghent, 1899, q. 1067 Their link with a religious institute is what distinguishes them from members of other \\"associations of the Christian faithful\\" and entitles their associations to be \\"called third orders or some other appropriate name\\". = Membership = Any Roman Catholic, Lutheran or Anglican may join a Third Order of their respective religious tradition. The laying aside of the distinctive sign or prayers for any space of time does not in itself put an end to membership with a Third Order, but the deliberate wish to dissociate oneself from it is sufficient to produce that effect (S. Cong. Indulg., 31 January 1893). Roman Catholic Third orders = Third Order of Our Lady of Mount Carmel = The Third Order of Our Lady of Mount Carmel (also named Lay Carmelites) are the third order associated with the Carmelites. It was established in 1476 by a bull of Pope Sixtus IV and is known for devotion to Virgin Mary, under her title as Our Lady of Mount Carmel. The Discalced branch is termed Secular Order of Discalced Carmelites. = Third Order Secular of the Most Holy Trinity = The Trinitarian Family is composed of the Brothers, Sisters and Laity who bear the name of the Trinity as titular and recognize John of Matha as father.\\"We Are family\\", Order of the Most Holy Trinity The Order of the Most Holy Trinity was founded to ransom Christian Captives (especially those in danger of renouncing their faith). The Motto of the Order expresses well the charism of the order: Glory to the Most Holy Trinity and Liberty to Captives. There have been tertiaries of the Order of the Most Holy Trinity and of the Captives since the beginnings of the Order though they were not known by that name. Lay confreres were admitted already in 1199 by the permission of Pope Innocent III. Statutes attributed to William the Scotsman, the third Minister General of the Order (1217-1222), give some idea of the primitive organization of the Trinitarian Fraternity. The first known Statutes of the Trinitarian Third Order were published in 1584, and were approved by the General of the Order, Father Bernard Dominici. The first Rule of Life for the Third Order attached to the Discalced Trinitarians was approved by Pope Leo XII on 6 June 1828. = Third Order of Saint Francis = The Third Order of St. Francis in the Roman Catholic Church is part of the Franciscan family of religious orders. It is the best known and most widely distributed of the third orders, and has both regular and secular branches. The preaching of St. Francis of Assisi, as well as his own living example and that of his first disciples, exercised such a powerful attraction on the people that many married men and women wanted to join the First or the Second Order. This being incompatible with their state of life, St. Francis found a middle way: he gave them a rule animated by the Franciscan spirit. When the immediate disciples of the saint had become an order bound by the religious vows, it became necessary to provide for the great body of laity, married men and women, who could not leave the world or abandon their avocations, but still were part of the Franciscan movement and desired to carry out in their lives its spirit and teaching. And so, probably in 1221, St. Francis drew up a Rule for those of his followers who were debarred from being members of the order of Friars Minor. At first they were called \\"Brothers and Sisters of the Order of Penance\\"; but later on, when the Friars were called the \\"First Order\\" and the nuns the \\"Second Order,\\" the Order of Penance became the \\"Third Order of St. Francis\\" whence the name Tertiaries: this threefold division already existed among the Humiliati. Nicholas IV introduced unity of rule and of direction into the Third Order, which henceforward was entrusted to the care of the Friars Minor. Immediately on its establishment in 1221 the Third Order spread rapidly all over Italy and throughout western Europe, and embraced multitudes of men and women of all ranks from highest to lowest. Everywhere it was connected closely with the First Order, and was under the control of the Friars Minor. In time a tendency set in for members of the Third Order to live together in community, and in this way congregations were formed who took the usual religious vows and lived a fully organized religious life based on the Rule of the Third Order with supplementary regulations. These congregations are the Regular Tertiaries as distinguished from the Secular Tertiaries, who lived in the world, according to the original idea. The Regular Tertiaries are in the full technical sense religious, and there have been, and are, many congregations of them, both of men and of women. There can be little doubt, whatever counter claims may be set up, that the Third Order was one of St. Francis' creations, and that his Third Order was the exemplar after which the others were fashioned; but at an early date the other Mendicant Orders formed Third Orders on the same lines, and so there came into being Dominican Tertiaries, and Carmelite, and Augustinian, and Servite, and also Premonstratensian and many others. These followed the same lines of development as the Franciscan Tertiaries, and for the most part divided into the two branches of regular and secular Tertiaries. The Rules of the various Third Orders have proved very adaptable to the needs of modern congregations devoted to active works of charity; and so a great number of teaching and nursing congregations of women belong to one or other of the Third Orders. The Franciscan Third Order was always the principal one, and it received a great impetus and a renewed vogue from Pope Leo XIII in 1883, in his approval of a new Rule for the seculars. In 1901 Paul Sabatier published a \\"Rule of Life of the Brothers and Sisters of Penance,\\" which probably contained, with additions, the substance of the original Rule of 1221. It prescribed severe simplicity of dress and of life, and certain abstinences and prayers and other religious exercises, and forbade the frequentation of the theatre, the bearing of arms and the taking of oaths except when administered by magistrates. In 1978 Pope Paul VI caused the separate Rules for both regulars and seculars to be recast and made more suitable for the requirements of devout men and women at the present day. The secular wing of the Order was renamed as the Secular Franciscan Order. In 1910 it was estimated that the number of lay Franciscan Tertiaries now exceeds two million.  Third Order Regular (male and female)  The origin of the Regular Third Order, both male and female, can be traced back to the second half of the thirteenth century, but no precise date can be indicated. It was organized, in different forms, in the Netherlands, in the south of France, in Germany, and in Italy. Probably some secular tertiaries, who in many cases had their house of meeting, gradually withdrew entirely from the world and so formed religious communities, but without the three substantial vows of religious orders. Other religious associations such as the Beguines (women) and Beghards (men) in the Low Countries, sometimes became Third Orders. Throughout the fourteenth century, the regular tertiaries of both sexes had in the most cases no common organization; only in the following century we can observe single well-ordered religious communities with solemn vows and a common head. Pope Martin V submitted in 1428 all tertiaries, regular and secular, to the direction of the Minister-General of the Friars Minor (Bull. Franc., VII, 715), but this disposition was soon revoked by his successor Pope Eugene IV. We meet thus in the same fifteenth century with numerous independent male congregations of regular tertiaries with the three vows in Italy, Sicily, Dalmatia, Spain, Portugal, France, Germany, and in the Netherlands. Contemporaneously there existed sister congregations of the Third Order with solemn vows, for instance, the Grey sisters of the Third Order, serving in hospitals, spread in France and the Netherlands. Leo X, to introduce uniformity into the numerous congregations, gave in 1521 a new form to the rule, now in ten chapters, retaining of the rule as published by Nicholas IV all that could serve the purpose, adding new points, especially the three solemn vows, and insisting on subjection to the First Order of St. Francis. For this last disposition the Rule of Leo X met with resistance, and never was accepted by some congregations, whilst it serves till the present day as the basis of the constitutions of many later congregations, especially of numerous communities of sisters.  Single congregations after Leo X  The two Italian congregations, the Lombardic and Sicilian, which had constituted themselves in the course of the fifteenth century, were united by Pope Paul III, and since Sixtus V enjoyed entire independence from the First Order. It had then already 11 provinces. The dress is that of the Conventuals, from whom they can hardly be distinguished. The residence of the minister-general is at Rome, near the Church of Sts. Cosmas and Damian. After the time of Pope Leo X, the Spanish congregation often had troubles on the question of its submission to the First Order. After Pius V (1568) had put the whole Third Order again under the care of the Minister- General of the Friars Minor, the superiors of the three provinces constituted in Spain could, after 1625, partake at the General Chapters of the Friars Minor and since 1670 they have had even a definitor-general to represent them. Congregations of Sisters Whilst Leo X in the reform of the rule had left it free to the congregations to adopt papal enclosure or not, Pius V (1568) prescribed it to all convents of tertiary sisters with solemn vows. Still this order was not carried out everywhere. In this regard the custom prevailed that the Friars Minor refused to take the direction of those convents which had only episcopal enclosure. Besides those already mentioned above, we may add the different offshoots of the Sisters of St. Elizabeth in Austria, Germany, the Netherlands, and France (there, under the name of Soeurs du Refuge, some of them still exist). The first Ursulines, also, founded by St. Angela Merici (1540), belonged to the Third Order. In the nineteenth century many of the new congregations adopted the Rule of the Third Order, but most of them have no further connection with the First Order. Many of them have widely varying names; a good many are of mere local character, others again are of international importance. As to their activities, almost all dedicate themselves to works of charity, either in hospitals, homes, or ateliers; others work in schools, not a few are in foreign missions. We can give here scarcely more than a list of the names, with the dates of the foundation. The Mystic Marriage of Saint Catherine of Siena by Giovanni di Paolo, c. 1460 (Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York). = Third Order of Saint Dominic= This was one of the earliest developments of Saint Dominic's Ordo de Poenitentia. It was not indeed the primal organism from which the Friars Preachers evolved, but rather represents that portion of the Order of Penance which came under Dominican influence. At first vaguely constituted and living without system or form, its members gradually grew more and more dependent on their spiritual guides. Their two greatest saints are Catherine of Siena and Rose of Lima, who both lived ascetic lives in their family homes, and whose spiritual influence was great in their societies. = Third Order of Servites= The Servite Order has had both a secular and regular Third Order. The secular Third Order was established in the United States in 1893. The Sisters of the Third Order of Servites was founded by St. Juliana Falconieri of Florence, who received the habit c. 1385 from Philip Benizi, then Prior General of the Servite friars. The Servite Sisters' traditional habit consisted of a black tunic, secured by a leather belt, and a white veil. The sisters devoted themselves especially to the care of the sick and other works of mercy; because the gown had short sleeves to facilitate work, people called the Sisters of the new order \\"Mantellate.\\" There were, in the early 20th century, two congregations, with a membership of 400. =Third Order of Saint Augustine= These are the men and women who follow the spirit of the Rule of St. Augustine in their daily lives under the spiritual guidance of the Augustinian friars. =Secular Augustinian Recollects= The Secular Augustinian Recollects () is the official Third Order of the Order of Augustinian Recollects. Today, the SAR is present in 19 countries in 111 Local Chapters with at least 3,500 members. Lutheran Churches There are in the Lutheran Church, Lutheran Franciscan Third Orders in Germany, Sweden and North America, as well as other third orders, such as the Humiliatenorden. =Humiliatenorden= =Lutheran Franciscan Tertiaries= In Germany, the Lutheran Franciscan Tertiaries, officially known as the Evangelische Franziskanerbruderschaft der Nachfolge Christi, were founded in 1927; the emphasize the Rule of Saint Francis and pray daily from their breviary. =Franciskus Tredje Orden= The Franciskus Tredje Orden is a Lutheran third order of the Church of Sweden. Anglican Communion =Third Order, Society of St. Francis (Anglican Communion)= The Third Order, Society of St. Francis (TSSF), was founded in 1950.Society of St. Francis The TSSF consists of men and women, lay and ordained, married and single. It is divided into five provinces: Africa, Australia, New Zealand, Europe, and the Americas. In addition the Franciscan Order of Divine Compassion, was founded in 1981. The FODC's Third Order, also known as the Brothers and Sisters of Penance, is composed of men and women, single and married, clerical and lay, who live in the world, working in their various life callings. =Anglican Order of Preachers (Dominican)= The Order of Saint Dominic within the Anglican Communion is known as the Anglican Order of Preachers (Dominican), and holds to a third order-style structure for all of its members. Its members, who follow the Dominican Rule, and are a designated 'Christian Community' (secular religious order), may be male or female, and it includes both single and married members. It is the primary manifestation of the Order of Saint Dominic within Anglicanism, which has no primary religious orders in the Dominican tradition. = Third Order of St. Andrew = The Order of Saint Andrew is an Anglican ecumenical religious order of both men and women, single and married, living and working in the world. Any member in good standing of any Christian Church in apostolic succession may make application to join. =Third Order, Franciscan Order of Divine Compassion= Franciscan Order of Divine Compassion, was founded in 1981. The FODC's Third Order, also known as the Brothers and Sisters of Penance, is composed of men and women, single and married, clerical and lay, who live in the world, working in their various life callings.

It was established in 1972 under agreement by the participating governments in the Caribbean Community to conduct such examinations as it may think appropriate and award certificates and diplomas on the results of any such examinations so conducted. The Council is empowered to regulate the conduct of any such examinations and prescribe the qualification requirements of candidates and the fees payable by them. It is now an examining body that provides educational certifications in 16 English speaking Commonwealth Caribbean Countries and Territories and has replaced the General Certificate of Education (GCE) examinations used by England and some other members of the Commonwealth. The CXC is an institution of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM); it was recognised as an Associate Institution of the Community in the 1973 treaty that created the Caribbean Community. Members of the Council are drawn from the 16 territories and the region's two universities, the University of Guyana and the University of the West Indies.  Structure of the Council  It currently consists of the following members: *The Vice Chancellor of the University of the West Indies; *The Vice Chancellor of the University of Guyana; *Three representatives of the University of the West Indies appointed by the Vice Chancellor of the University of the West Indies, regard being given to the geographic dispersion of the campuses; *One representative of the University of Guyana appointed by the Vice Chancellor of the University of Guyana; *Two representatives appointed by each of the Participating Governments of Barbados, Guyana, Jamaica and Trinidad and Tobago and one representative appointed by each of the other Participating Governments; *One representative of the teaching profession appointed by each National Committee from among its members. The Participating Territories are Anguilla, Antigua and Barbuda, Barbados, Belize, British Virgin Islands, Cayman Islands, Dominica, Grenada, Guyana, Jamaica, Montserrat, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Trinidad and Tobago and Turks and Caicos Islands. Members of the Council hold office for a period of three years. The Chairman (who is eligible for re-election) and Deputy Chairman are elected from among the members of Council to hold office for three years or for the unexpired term of their appointments as members of the Council. The Council organises its business on a triennial basis, using the calendar year as its operative year. The Registrar is the Chief Executive of the Council, and the Council may delegate to him any of its duties relating to the holding of examinations and the appointments of staff members other than himself or the Pro-Registrar.  Examinations  The Caribbean Examinations Council offers three levels of examinations and certifications: *the Caribbean Primary Exit Assessment (CPEA) *the Caribbean Secondary Education Certification (CSEC) *the Caribbean Advanced Proficiency Examinations (CAPE) The CXC Associate Degree Programme was unveiled in 2005; it is a tertiary qualification based on the CAPE certification. *Caribbean Secondary Education Certificate (CSEC) examinations are usually taken by students after five years of secondary school, and mark the end of standard secondary education. The CSEC examinations are equivalent to the Ordinary Level (O-Levels) examinations and are targeted towards students sixteen and older. The CSEC examinations are often called the CXC examinations as they were the only examinations offered by the CXC from 1979 until 1998. *Caribbean Advanced Proficiency Examinations (CAPE) examinations are taken by students who have completed their secondary education and wish to continue their studies. Students who wish to sit for the CAPE usually possess CSEC or an equivalent certification. The CAPE is equivalent to the Advanced Levels (A-levels) and they are both voluntary qualifications that are intended for university entrance. Since it was introduced in 1998, the number of subjects offered at CAPE has increased. While it may vary by territory, the CSECs are generally viewed as an employment qualification certifying the holder as a secondary school graduate. While the CAPE is considered a suitable qualification for entry into tertiary education. The island territories of Saint Maarten and Saba--both part of the Kingdom of the Netherlands--also conduct exams administered by the Council. In 1993, the Caribbean Examinations Council Act was commenced to secure the integrity of examinations conducted by the council.

It is known for its faux-patina steel dome painted to imitate copper cladding. Nine nude muses, the \\"nine maidens\\" supporting the cornice line can be seen. The terracotta for this building, including the ladies, was made in Tamworth, Staffordshire, England by Gibbs and Canning Limited. History The Sun Tower was commissioned by L. D. Taylor to house his newspaper, The Vancouver World. The intention was that the building would be visible throughout the World's circulation area as the tallest building in the city. John Coughland and Sons of Vancouver had 1,250 tons of steel fabricated for construction. When it was completed in 1912, it was called the World Building and was the tallest building in Vancouver at , surpassing the previous record-holder, the Dominion Building located just around the corner. For one year, it was the tallest building in the Canada, until Toronto's 85 metre Canadian Pacific Building opened in 1913. In 1918, droves of Vancouverites turned out to watch as Harry Gardiner, the \\"Human Fly\\", scaled the outside of the building. When The Vancouver Sun bought the building in 1937, it was renamed. Although The Sun newspaper has long since relocated, first to South Granville then to Granville Square, the building has retained the name. Formerly 100 West Pender St, the City of Vancouver renumbered the Sun Tower's street address to 128 West Pender in 2011 in accordance with its strict street numbering bylaw when a new building was constructed on the vacant lot at the south west corner of West Pender and Abbott Streets. Architecture and materials The Sun Tower was designed by architect William Tuff Whiteway, who also designed the original Woodward's building nearby. The building takes the form of an eight-storey, L-shaped block, surmounted by a nine-storey hexagonal-section tower. The tower is capped by a Beaux-Arts dome and cupola. The structure of the tower is steel, which is dominantly clad in a combination of terracotta tiles and rusticated brickwork. The dome itself, although painted to resemble patinated copper, is steel. The exterior is adorned with nine terracotta caryatids supporting the cornice, sculpted by Charles Marega. These apparently caused a minor scandal among some of Vancouver's citizenry at the building's opening, as the female figures are depicted partially clothed, with naked breasts, and were considered to be adopting \\"sensuous\\" poses. Further decorative detailing is provided by carved stone sills under all windows, manufactured from local volcanic andesite from Haddington Island. Haddington Island andesite is also used for some of the decorative carvings near the top of the tower, that feature animal skulls surrounded by garlands of fruit and flowers.

The Carmelites known for devotion to Blessed Virgin Mary under her title as Our Lady of Mount Carmel. History Soon after the Order of Our Lady of Mount Carmel was established in Europe in the thirteenth century, lay persons, not bound by religious vows, seem to have attached themselves to it more or less closely. There is evidence of the existence of a \\"Confrairie Notre-Dame du Mont-Carmel\\" at Toulouse in 1273, and of a \\"Compagnia di Santa Maria del Carmino\\" at Bologna in 1280, but the exact nature of these bodies is uncertain owing to a lack of documents.

New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1912. 14 Oct. 2014 Somewhat later mention is frequently made of trade-guilds having their seat in churches of the order, members of which acted as their chaplains. Thus the master-bakers, innkeepers and pastry-cooks at N√Æmes, the barbers and surgeons of the same town, who were also connected with the Dominicans, the goldsmiths at Avignon. Benefactors of the order received letters of fraternity with the right of participation in the privileges and good works of the friars. Others, under the name of bizzoche and mantellatoe, wore the habit and observed the rule, at Florence in 1308. Still others became recluses in the anchorages attached to Carmelite churches. Among the tertiaries not living in community were Blessed Louis Morbioli of Bologna (d. 1495). The canonical institution of the third order dates from the middle of the fifteenth century, when a community of Beguines at Guelders sought affiliation to the order, and Blessed John Soreth, General of the Carmelites, obtained a Bull (7 October 1452) granting the superiors of his order the faculties enjoyed by the Hermits of Saint Augustine and the Dominicans of canonically establishing convents of \\"virgins, widows, beguines and mantellatae\\". Also Saint Nuno of Saint Mary had participated in the developing work of the carmelite third order. Further legislation took place in 1476 by the Bull Mare magnum privilegiorum, and under Pope Benedict XIII and his successors. The rule observed by the tertiaries, whether living in the world or gathered into communities, was originally that of the friars with modifications as required by their status. Theodor Stratius, General of the Carmelites of the Ancient Observance, composed in 1635 a new rule, revised in 1678, which is still observed among tertiaries of the Calced and the Discalced Carmelites. There are numerous corporations of tertiaries established in different countries, viz. two communities of tertiary brothers in Ireland (Drumcondra and Clondalkin near Dublin) in charge of an asylum for the blind and of a high-school for boys; eighteen communities of native priests in British India belonging partly to the Latin and partly to the Syro- Malabar Churches; four houses of Brothers of Christian Education in Spain. In Britain, the Third Order experienced a particular growth following the return of the Carmelite friars to Britain in the 1920s. There are around 500 professed members of the Carmelite Third Order Secular in Britain. Far more numerous are the communities of nuns, namely twenty-three in India (Latin and Syro-Malabar rites) for the education of native girls, and four convents in Syria in connection with the missions of the Order; two congregations of tertiaries in Spain with nineteen and forty-eight establishments respectively, and one unattached, for educational work. In Spain there are also tertiary nuns called \\"Carmelitas de la caridad\\" engaged in works of charity with 150 establishments. The Austrian congregation of nuns numbers twenty-seven houses, while the most recent branch, the Carmelite Tertiaries of the Sacred Heart, founded at Berlin towards the end of the last century for the care and education of orphans and neglected children, have spread rapidly through Germany, Holland, England, Switzerland, Italy, Austria, and Hungary, and have twenty houses. In Italy there are three different congregations with thirty- two convents. There are smaller branches of the tertiaries in South America with two houses at Santiago, Chile, in Switzerland with four convents, and in England with one. Present Day Those who wish to be members of the Carmelite Third Order must be practicing Catholics. They must not be members of any other Third Order or Secular Institute, except in special cases, and they must be at least 18 years of age. After a period of initial formation, candidates are accepted for profession.\\"Third Order\\", Order of the Brothers of the Most Blessed Virgin Mary of Mount Carmel The term 'Lay Carmel' is somewhat problematic when describing the Secular/Third Orders because there are a number of ordained ministers (deacons, priests and bishops) who, while not lay people, are professed members of the Secular/Third Orders.\\"Lay Carmel\\", The British Province of Carmelite Fathers Apart from attending a monthly community meeting, Lay Carmelites wear the Brown Scapular of Our Lady of Mt.

The school emphasizes college-prep academics and music. UHS opened in 2000 with Dr. Brad Huff as the founding Head of School, with its first class graduating in 2004. At the end of the 2004‚Äì2005 school year, approximately 370 students were enrolled. The school now has a steady enrollment of about 480 students. James Bushman, Ed.D., has been Head of School since 2006. University High School is chartered by Fresno Unified School District and has special autonomy over its administration. Application process Prospective students must apply to UHS with at least intermediate-level proficiency in instrumental or vocal music. The school accepts approximately 130 new freshmen per year by lottery from its pool of applicants. It is possible to transfer to the school as a junior, but this requires taking the first-year Latin and musicianship courses in summer school or acquiring some exemptions from the administration. Curriculum The UHS curriculum offers students a college-prep course of study. In addition to typical high school courses in math, science, English, social sciences, and PE, students are also required to study two years of Latin and four years of musicianship, which entails musicology, music theory, audiation, and musical analysis. Students are required to participate in music performance classes every semester, either playing an instrument or participating in choir. Because of its location on the CSUF campus, students are required to take selected university courses for dual credit beginning in the sophomore year. These include world history, science, and foreign language. Elective courses may include selected university classes, along with an array of short courses in subjects such as the arts, sciences, theater, literature, culture, competitive teams, athletics, and community service. Extracurricular activities Academic teams include Academic Decathlon, Science Olympiad, Mock Trial, and Speech and Debate. The school is the ten-time champions in the Small School United States Academic Decathlon Online National Competition University High School also won the Fresno County Academic Decathlon in 2010, 2012, 2013, 2015, 2016, 2017, and 2018 making UHS one of only 3 schools to have ever won consecutive Fresno County Championships. UHS fields two teams each year in Fresno County Science Olympiad and has had one or both teams qualify for Nor-Cal state competition every year since 2007. Permanent Campus The school opened in fall 2000 in temporary facilities on the campus of California State University, Fresno. In October 2009, construction began on a brand new facility for University High School, designed to replace the complex of portables that had held students for the previous nine years. The new building, which opened in November 2010, contains 11 new classrooms, four science labs, three music rooms, and a Mac-based computer lab. The building is split into three wings: the leftmost administration wing, the center classroom wing, and the rightmost music wing. Every classroom is fitted with state-of- the-art tools to enhance the learning process such as interactive whiteboards and Steelcase desk chairs that offer reclination. All of the music rooms are acoustically engineered for the types of ensembles performing in them. The building also contains a fitness center, which the school won as a result of their achievement in the Governor's fitness challenge. On November 16, 2010, classes were cancelled at the school, and students and faculty all helped to move from the old portables, to the new facility. The building is dedicated to the late Dean Luis Costa, a former Fresno State Dean of Arts and Humanities who played a major role in founding the school in 2000, and President John Welty, the president of Fresno State at the time of the high school's opening and during the entire building process. The new building was designed by renowned architect, Arthur Erickson, who had previously designed Fresno City Hall.

The Severn Estuary () in Great Britain is the confluence of the River Severn, the River Wye, the River Usk, the River Avon, and other smaller rivers.Natural England Severn Estuary SSSI information on the citation, map and unit details Its high tidal range, approximately , means that it has been at the centre of discussions in the UK regarding renewable energy. Geography Definitions of the limits of the Severn Estuary vary. A narrower definition adopted by some maps is that the river becomes the Severn Estuary after the Second Severn Crossing near Severn Beach, South Gloucestershire, and stretches to a line from Lavernock Point (south of Cardiff) to Sand Point near Weston-super-Mare.Severn Boating website The definition used on Admiralty Chart SC1179 and the Bristol Channel and Severn Cruising Guide is that the estuary extends upstream to Aust, the site of the old Severn Bridge. The estuary is about wide at Aust, and about wide between Cardiff and Weston-super-Mare. The Estuary forms the boundary between Wales and England in this stretch. On the northern side of the estuary are the Caldicot and Wentloog Levels which are on either side of the city of Newport; and, to the west, the city of Cardiff together with the resort of Penarth. On the southern, English, side, are Avonmouth, Portishead, Clevedon, and Weston- super-Mare. Denny Island is a small rocky island of , with scrub vegetation, approximately three miles north of Portishead. Its rocky southern foreshore marks the boundary between England and Wales, but the island itself is reckoned administratively to Monmouthshire, Wales. The estuary has one of the highest tidal ranges in the world -- about . The estuary's funnel shape, its tidal range and the underlying geology of rock, gravel and sand, produce strong tidal streams and high turbidity, giving the water a notably brown coloration. West of the line between Lavernock Point and Sand Point is the Bristol Channel, which in turn discharges into the Celtic Sea and the wider Atlantic Ocean. The islands of Steep Holm and Flat Holm are located close to that line, in the middle of the estuary. Sometimes the term Severn Estuary is used to include the tidal upstream stretch between Gloucester and Aust.For example by the Severn Estuary Partnership and VisitEngland During the highest tides on the upper reaches of this stretch, the rising water is funnelled up the estuary into the Severn bore, a self-reinforcing solitary wave that travels rapidly upstream against the river current.  Conservation and SSSI status The tidal range results in the estuary having one of the most extensive intertidal wildlife habitats in the UK, comprising mudflats, sandflats, rocky platforms and islands. These form a basis for plant and animal communities typical of extreme physical conditions of liquid mud and tide-swept sand and rock. The estuary is recognised as a wetland area of international importance and is designated as a Ramsar site.Information on Severn Estuary Ramsar site designationJoint Nature Conservation Committee Listing of Ramsars The estuary is recognised as a Special Protection Area (SPA) under the EC Directive on the conservation of Wild Birds.Information on Severn Estuary Special Protection Area designationJoint Nature Conservation Committee Listing of Special Protection Areas The estuary is recognised as a Special Area of Conservation (SAC) under the EU Habitats Directive.Information on Severn Estuary Special Area of Conservation designationJoint Nature Conservation Committee Listing of Special Areas of Conservation Parts of the estuary have also been designated a Site of Special Scientific Interest. The SSSI includes most of the foreshore upstream from Cardiff and Brean Down and most of the upper estuary as far as Sharpness. The Upper Severn Estuary SSSI covers the tidal river between Purton and Frampton on Severn.Natural England Upper Severn Estuary SSSI information on citation, map and unit details The Severn Estuary SSSI original designation involves the then counties of Somerset, Avon and Gloucestershire in England, and Gwent and South Glamorgan in Wales. The Severn Estuary SSSI designation overlaps individual site designations for separate sites in Avon (Spring Cove Cliffs, Middle Hope, Portishead Pier to Black Nore, Aust Cliff), Gloucestershire (Purton Passage) and South Glamorgan (Penarth Coast). The 1976 designation includes two sites previously notified in 1952 (Brean Down and Uphill Cliff). The SSSI forms the major part of a larger area which includes the Taf/Ely Estuary and Bridgwater Bay (as well as the Upper Severn Estuary) The Upper Severn Estuary SSSI designation involves the English county of Gloucestershire. The site (Severn Estuary and Upper Severn Estuary) is listed in the 'Forest of Dean Local Plan Review' as a Key Wildlife Site (KWS).Forest of Dean District Local Plan Review, adopted November 2005, Appendix D 'Nature Conservation Site Designations Within the Forest of Dean District', Key Wildlife Sites Both SSSI citations provide detail of the geological and biological interest and of particular note is the international importance for wintering and wading birds of passage, and of estuarine habits of outstanding ornithological significance. It is stated that the estuary supports over 10% of the British wintering population and is the single most important wintering ground for dunlin, and for significant numbers of Bewick's swans, European white-fronted geese and wigeon. Nationally important wintering populations are supported such as gadwall, shoveller and pochard. There are notably seven species of migratory fish which pass through the estuary in both directions. These include significant numbers of Atlantic salmon and common eel. Tidal power Diagram of a plan to harness tidal power on the River Severn circa 1921. Caption from Popular Mechanics Magazine 1921 Barrage locations considered over the years A huge tidal range and high level of surrounding industry and population have long made the Severn Estuary and Bristol Channel a focus for tidal energy schemes and ideas. Plans for a Severn Barrage -- running across the Bristol Channel from Lavernock Point near to and south west of Cardiff to Brean Down near and just south west of Weston-super-Mare in Somerset -- would generate a massive 8640 MW when the tide flows, and have been discussed for several decades now. The power generated would come from a lake of with a potential energy depth of . Tidal power only runs for around ten hours a day, but by using the enclosed lake as a reservoir of potential energy more hours of operation could be achieved. Other energy sources, such as wind and solar power, also create electricity at times that do not always match when it is needed. Excess power could be stored by pumping water uphill, as is already done at a variety of other installations in the UK. The UK Government shelved the plans in the late 1980s due largely to cost issues and local environmental concerns. However, this was before recent huge rises in the price of energy, and before global warming had started to be taken seriously. In April 2006 the Welsh Assembly approved the idea of utilising the tidal power, but the RSPB has raised serious concerns about the effect on the mud flats, that have European Environmental protection status, and the UK government Energy Review published later in the year did not endorse the scheme. Opinion is still divided on the benefits of a proposed barrage. John Hutton, Secretary of State for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform, announced a further feasibility study on 25 September 2007. The Severn Tidal Power Feasibility Study was launched in January 2008 to assess all tidal range technologies (including barrages, lagoons and others). The study will look at the costs, benefits and impacts of a Severn tidal power scheme and will help Government decide whether it could or could not support such a scheme. The Severn Estuary has the potential to generate more renewable electricity than all other UK estuaries. If harnessed, it could create up to 5% of the UK's electricity, contributing significantly to UK climate change goals as well as European Union renewable energy targets. The proposal for a hydro-electric barrier to generate 8.6 GW and meet five percent of Britain's power needs, is being opposed by some environmental groups. Severn Estuary Partnership The Severn Estuary Partnership (SEP) was set up in 1995 as an independent initiative to focus the activities of local government, statutory authorities and interested parties such as farmers and fisherman. Its stated aim is To bring together all those involved in the development, management and use of the Estuary within a framework which encourages the integration of their interests and responsibilities to achieve common objectives. In 2001 SEP published the Strategy for the Severn Estuary, which sets out a plan for the management of the estuary. SEP uses a geographically extended definition of the Severn Estuary, beginning at the tidal limit of the River Severn in Gloucester and ending at a line drawn between Hurlestone Point near Minehead and Nash Point in the Vale of Glamorgan. Archaeology The archaeology of the Severn Estuary is richly varied and of considerable importance, reflecting both the varied nature of the topography and the importance of the river for both fishing and as a maritime waterway. The archaeological resource within the estuary is under threat from natural processes such as coastal erosion, exacerbated by the high tidal range and strong tidal currents, and from threats such as ongoing development pressure along the shoreline, marine aggregates extraction and new coastal defensive and realignment measures as well as proposed major infrastructure projects. An archaeological aerial survey report of the archaeology on the English side is available to view and download from the reference link.

Axons often follow very precise paths in the nervous system, and how they manage to find their way so accurately is an area of ongoing research. Axon growth takes place from a region called the growth cone and reaching the axon target is accomplished with relatively few guidance molecules. Growth cone receptors respond to the guidance cues. Mechanisms Growing axons have a highly motile structure at the growing tip called the growth cone, which \\"sniffs out\\" the extracellular activities in the environment for signals that instruct the axon which direction to grow. These signals, called guidance cues, can be fixed in place or diffusible; they can attract or repel axons. Growth cones contain receptors that recognize these guidance cues and interpret the signal into a chemotropic response. The general theoretical framework is that when a growth cone \\"senses\\" a guidance cue, the receptors activate various signaling molecules in the growth cone that eventually affect the cytoskeleton. If the growth cone senses a gradient of guidance cue, the intracellular signaling in the growth cone happens asymmetrically, so that cytoskeletal changes happen asymmetrically and the growth cone turns toward or away from the guidance cue. A combination of genetic and biochemical methods (see below) has led to the discovery of several important classes of axon guidance molecules and their receptors:Bear, MF, Connors, BW and Paradiso, MA 'Neuroscience Exploring the Brain' Page 699. Third Edition. published by LWW. Lippincott, Williams & Wilkins *Netrins: Netrins are secreted molecules that can act to attract or repel axons by binding to their receptors, DCC and UNC5. *Slits: Secreted proteins that normally repel growth cones by engaging Robo (Roundabout) class receptors. *Ephrins: Ephrins are cell surface molecules that activate Eph receptors on the surface of other cells. This interaction can be attractive or repulsive. In some cases, Ephrins can also act as receptors by transducing a signal into the expressing cell, while Ephs act as the ligands. Signaling into both the Ephrin- and Eph-bearing cells is called \\"bi-directional signaling.\\" *Semaphorins: The many types of Semaphorins are primarily axonal repellents, and activate complexes of cell-surface receptors called Plexins and Neuropilins. * Cell adhesion molecules (CAMs): Integral membrane proteins mediating adhesion between growing axons and eliciting intracellular signalling within the growth cone. CAMs are the major class of proteins mediating correct axonal navigation of axons growing on axons (fasciculation). There are two CAM subgroups: IgSF-CAMs (belonging to the immunoglobulin superfamily) and Cadherins (Ca-dependent CAMs). In addition, many other classes of extracellular molecules are used by growth cones to navigate properly: *Developmental morphogens, such as BMPs, Wnts, Hedgehog, and FGFs *Extracellular matrix and adhesion molecules such as laminin, tenascins, proteoglycans, N-CAM, and L1 *Growth factors like NGF *Neurotransmitters and modulators like GABA =Integration of information in axon guidance= Growing axons rely on a variety of guidance cues in deciding upon a growth pathway. The growth cones of extending axons process these cues in an intricate system of signal interpretation and integration, in order to ensure appropriate guidance.Jonathan Raper and Carol Mason, Cellular Strategies of Axonal Pathfinding, Cold Spring Harb Perspect Biol 2010;2:a001933 These cues can be functionally subdivided into: *Adhesive cues, that provide physical interaction with the substrate necessary for axon protrusion. These cues can be expressed on glial and neuronal cells the growing axon contacts or be part of the extracellular matrix. Examples are laminin or fibronectin, in the extracellular matrix, and cadherins or Ig-family cell-adhesion molecules, found on cell surfaces. *Tropic cues, that can act as attractants or repellents and cause changes in growth cone motility by acting on the cytoskeleton through intracellular signaling. For example, Netrin plays a role in guiding axons through the midline, acting as both an attractant and a repellent, while Semaphorin3A helps axons grow from the olfactory epithelium to map different locations in the olfactory bulb. *Modulatory cues, that influence the sensitivity of growth cones to certain guidance cues. For instance, neurotrophins can make axons less sensitive to the repellent action of Semaphorin3A. Given the abundance of these different guidance cues it was previously believed that growth cones integrate various information by simply summing the gradient of cues, in different valences, at a given point in time, to making a decision on the direction of growth. However, studies in vertebrate nervous systems of ventral midline crossing axons, has shown that modulatory cues play a crucial part in tuning axon responses to other cues, suggesting that the process of axon guidance is nonlinear. For example, commissural axons are attracted by Netrin and repelled by Slit. However, as axons approach the midline, the repellent action of Slit is suppressed by Robo-3/Rig-1 receptor.Dickson BJ, Zou Y. Navigating intermediate targets: the nervous system midline\\" Cold Spring Harb Perspect Biol 2010;2: a002055. Once the axons cross the midline, activation of Robo by Slit silences Netrin- mediated attraction, and the axons are repelled by Slit. =Cellular strategies of nerve tract formation= Pioneer axons The formation of a nerve tract follows several basic rules. In both invertebrate and vertebrate nervous systems initial nerve tracts are formed by the pioneer axons of pioneer neurons. These axons follow a reproducible pathway, stop at intermediate targets, and branch axons at certain choice points, in the process of targeting their final destination. This principle is illustrated by CNS extending axons of sensory neurons in insects. During the process of limb development, proximal neurons are the first to form axonal bundles while growing towards the CNS. In later stages of limb growth, axons from more distal neurons fasciculate with these pioneer axons. Deletion of pioneer neurons disrupts the extension of later axons, destined to innervate the CNS. At the same time, it is worth noting that in most cases pioneer neurons do not contain unique characteristics and their role in axon guidance can be substituted by other neurons. For instance, in Xenopus retinotectal connection systems, the pioneer axons of retinal ganglion cells originate from the dorsal part of the eye. However, if the dorsal half of the eye is replaced by less mature dorsal part, ventral neurons can replace the pioneer pathway of the dorsal cells, after some delay. Studies in zebrafish retina showed that inhibiting neural differentiation of early retinal progenitors prevents axons from exiting the eye. The same study demonstrated aberrant growth trajectories in secondary neurons, following the growth of pioneer neurons missing a guidance receptor. Thus, while the extent of guidance provided by pioneer axons is under debate and may vary from system to system, the pioneer pathways clearly provide the follower projections with guidance cues and enhance their ability to navigate to target. Role of glia The first extending axons in a pathway interact closely with immature glia cells. In the forming corpus callosum of vertebrates, primitive glia cells first migrate to the ependymal zones of hemispheres and the dorsal septum wall to form a transient structure that the pioneer axons of the callosal fibers use to extend.Che¬¥dotal A, Richards LJ. 2010. Wiring the brain: the biology of neuronal guidance\\" Cold Spring Harb Perspect Biol 2: a001917. The signaling between glia and neurons in the developing nervous system is reciprocal. For instance, in the fly visual system, axons of photoreceptors require glia to exit the eye stalk whereas glia cells rely on signals from neurons to migrate back along axons. Guideposts The growing axons also rely on transient neuronal structures such as guidepost cells, during pathfinding. In the mouse visual system, proper optic chiasm formation depends on a V-shaped structure of transient neurons that intersect with specialized radial glia at the midline of the chiasm. The chiasm axons grow along and around this structure but do not invade it. Another example is the subplate in the developing cerebral cortex that consists of transient neuronal layer under the subventricular zone and serves as a guidepost for axons entering permanent cortical layers. The subplate is similar to the chiasmatic neurons in that these cell groups disappear (or transit into other cell types) as the brain matures. These findings indicate that transitory cell populations can serve an important guidance role even though they have no function in the mature nervous system. Studying axon guidance The earliest descriptions of the axonal growth cone were made by the Spanish neurobiologist Santiago Ram√≥n y Cajal in the late 19th century. However, understanding the molecular and cellular biology of axon guidance would not begin until decades later. In the last thirty years or so, scientists have used various methods to work out how axons find their way. Much of the early work in axon guidance was done in the grasshopper, where individual motor neurons were identified and their pathways characterized. In genetic model organisms like mice, zebrafish, nematodes, and fruit flies, scientists can generate mutations and see whether and how they cause axons to make errors in navigation. In vitro experiments can be useful for direct manipulation of growing axons. A popular method is to grow neurons in culture and expose growth cones to purified guidance cues to see whether these cause the growing axons to turn. These types of experiments have often been done using traditional embryological non-genetic model organisms, such as the chicken and African clawed frog. Embryos of these species are easy to obtain and, unlike mammals, develop externally and are easily accessible to experimental manipulation. =Axon guidance model systems= Several types of axon pathways have been extensively studied in model systems to further understand the mechanisms of axon guidance. Perhaps the two most prominent of these are commissures and topographic maps. Commissures are sites where axons cross the midline from one side of the nervous system to the other. Topographic maps are systems in which groups of neurons in one tissue project their axons to another tissue in an organized arrangement such that spatial relationships are maintained; i.e. adjacent neurons will innervate adjacent regions of the target tissue. Commissure formation: attraction and repulsion As described above, axonal guidance cues are often categorized as \\"attractive\\" or \\"repulsive.\\" This is a simplification, as different axons will respond to a given cue differently. Furthermore, the same axonal growth cone can alter its responses to a given cue based on timing, previous experience with the same or other cues, and the context in which the cue is found. These issues are exemplified during the development of commissures. The bilateral symmetry of the nervous system means that axons will encounter the same cues on either side of the midline. Before crossing (ipsilaterally), the growth cone must navigate toward and be attracted to the midline. However, after crossing (contralaterally), the same growth cone must become repelled or lose attraction to the midline and reinterpret the environment to locate the correct target tissue. Two experimental systems have had particularly strong impacts on understanding how midline axon guidance is regulated: =The ventral nerve cord of Drosophila= Axon guidance in the Drosophila embryonic ventral nerve cord. From Sanchez-Soriano et al., 2007 The use of powerful genetic tools in Drosophila led to the identification of a key class of axon guidance cues, the Slits, and their receptors, the Robos (short for Roundabout). The ventral nerve cord looks like a ladder, with three longitudinal axon bundles (fascicles) connected by the commissures, the \\"rungs\\" of the ladder. There are two commissures, anterior and posterior, within each segment of the embryo. The currently accepted model is that Slit, produced by midline cells, repels axons from the midline via Robo receptors. Ipsilaterally projecting (non-crossing) axons always have Robo receptors on their surface, while commissural axons have very little or no Robo on their surface, allowing them to be attracted to the midline by Netrins and, probably, other as-yet unidentified cues. After crossing, however, Robo receptors are strongly upregulated on the axon, which allows Robo-mediated repulsion to overcome attraction to the midline. This dynamic regulation of Robo is at least in part accomplished by a molecule called Comm (short for Commissureless), which prevents Robo from reaching the cell surface and targeting it for destruction.Sun, Q., S. Bahri, A. Schmid, W. Chia, and K. Zinn. \\"Receptor tyrosine phosphatases regulate axon guidance across the midline of the Drosophila embryo.\\" Development 2000; 127 : 801-12. Development. 15 Feb. 2000. Web. 23 Jan. 2010. <> =The spinal cord of mice and chickens= In the spinal cord of vertebrates, commissural neurons from the dorsal regions project downward toward the ventral floor plate. Ipsilateral axons turn before reaching the floor plate to grow longitudinally, while commissural axons cross the midline and make their longitudinal turn on the contralateral side. Strikingly, Netrins, Slits, and Robos all play similar functional roles in this system as well. One outstanding mystery was the apparent lack of any comm gene in vertebrates. It now seems that at least some of Comm's functions are performed by a modified form of Robo called Robo3 (or Rig1). The spinal cord system was the first to demonstrate explicitly the altered responsiveness of growth cones to cues after exposure to the midline. Explanted neurons grown in culture would respond to exogenously supplied Slit according to whether or not they had contacted floor plate tissue.Redies, C., H. Inuzuka, and M. Takeichi. \\"Restricted expression of N- and R-cadherin on neurites of the developing chicken CNS.\\" The Journal of Neuroscience 1992; 12 : 3525-534. <> Topographic maps: gradients for guidance As described above, topographic maps occur when spatial relationships are maintained between neuronal populations and their target fields in another tissue. This is a major feature of nervous system organization, particular in sensory systems. The neurobiologist Roger Sperry proposed a prescient model for topographic mapping mediated by what he called molecular \\"tags.\\" The relative amounts of these tags would vary in gradients across both tissues. We now think of these tags as ligands (cues) and their axonal receptors. Perhaps the best understood class of tags are the Ephrin ligands and their receptors, the Ephs. In the simplest type of mapping model, we could imagine a gradient of Eph receptor expression level in a field of neurons, such as the retina, with the anterior cells expressing very low levels and cells in the posterior expressing the highest levels of the receptor. Meanwhile, in the target of the retinal cells (the optic tectum), Ephrin ligands are organized in a similar gradient: high posterior to low anterior. Retinal axons enter the anterior tectum and proceed posteriorly. Because, in general, Eph-bearing axons are repelled by Ephrins, axons will become more and more reluctant to proceed the further they advance toward the posterior tectum. However, the degree to which they are repelled is set by their own particular level of Eph expression, which is set by the position of the neuronal cell body in the retina. Thus, axons from the anterior retina, expressing the lowest level of Ephs, can project to the posterior tectum, even though this is where Ephrins are highly expressed. Posterior retinal cells express high Eph level, and their axons will stop more anteriorly in the tectum. =The retinotectal projection of chickens, frogs and fish= The large size and accessibility of the chicken embryo has made it a favorite model organism for embryologists. Researchers used the chick to biochemically purify components from the tectum that showed specific activity against retinal axons in culture. This led to the identification of Ephs and Ephrins as Sperry's hypothesized \\"tags.\\" The retinotectal projection has also been studied in Xenopus and zebrafish. Zebrafish is a potentially powerful system because genetic screens like those performed in invertebrates can be done relatively simply and cheaply. In 1996, large scale screens were conducted in zebrafish, including screens for retinal axon guidance and mapping. Many of the mutants have yet to be characterized. =Cell biology= Genetics and biochemistry have identified a large set of molecules that affect axon guidance. How all of these pieces fit together is less understood. Most axon guidance receptors activate signal transduction cascades that ultimately lead to reorganization of the cytoskeleton and adhesive properties of the growth cone, which together underlie the motility of all cells. This has been well documented in mammalian cortical neurons. However, this raises the question of how the same cues can result in a spectrum of response from different growth cones. It may be that different receptors activate attraction or repulsion in response to a single cue. Another possibility is the receptor complexes act as \\"coincidence detectors\\" to modify responses to one cue in the presence of another. Similar signaling \\"cross-talk\\" could occur intracellularly, downstream of receptors on the cell surface. In fact, commissural axon growth responses have been shown to be attracted, repressed, or silenced in the presence of Netrin activated DCC receptor. This variable activity is dependent on Robo or UNC-5 receptor expression at growth cones. Such that Slit activated Robo receptor, causes a silencing of Netrin‚Äôs attractive potential through the DCC receptor. While growth cones expressing UNC-5 receptor, respond in a repulsive manner to Netrin-DCC activation. These events occur as consequence of cytoplasmic interactions between the Netrin activated DCC receptor and Robo or UNC-5 receptor, which ultimately alters DCC‚Äôs cytoplasmic signaling. Thus, the picture that emerges is that growth cone advancement is highly complex and subject to plasticity from guidance cues, receptor expression, receptor interactions, and the subsequent signaling mechanisms that influence cytoskeleton remodeling. Growth cone translation in guided axons The ability for axons to navigate and adjust responses to various extracellular cues, at long distances from the cell body, has prompted investigators to look at the intrinsic properties of growth cones. Recent studies reveal that guidance cues can influence spatiotemporal changes in axons by modulating the local translation and degradation of proteins in growth cones. Furthermore, this activity seems to occur independent of distal nuclear gene expression. In fact, in retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) with soma severed axons, growth cones continue to track and innervate the tectum of Xenopus embryos. To accommodate this activity, growth cones are believed to pool mRNAs that code for receptors and intracellular signaling proteins involved in cytoskeleton remodeling. In Xenopus retinotectal projection systems, the expression of these proteins has been shown to be influenced by guidance cues and the subsequent activation of local translation machinery. The attractive cue Netrin-1, stimulates mRNA transport and influence synthesis of Œ≤-Actin in filopodia of growth cones, to restructure and steer RGC growth cones in the direction of Netrin secretion. While the repulsive cue, Slit, is suggested to stimulate the translation of Cofilin (an actin depolymerizing factor) in growth cones, leading to axon repulsion. In addition, severed commissural axons in chicks, display the capability of translating and expressing Eph-A2 receptor during midline crossing. As a result, studies suggest that local protein expression is a convenient mechanism to explain the rapid, dynamic, and autonomous nature of growth cone advancement in response to guidance molecules. The axon growth hypothesis and the consensus connectome dynamics Contemporary diffusion- weighted MRI techniques may also uncover the macroscopical process of axonal development. The connectome, or the braingraph, can be constructed from diffusion MRI data: the vertices of the graph correspond to anatomically labelled brain areas, and two such vertices, say u and v, are connected by an edge if the tractography phase of the data processing finds an axonal fiber that connects the two areas, corresponding to u and v. Numerous braingraphs, computed from the Human Connectome Project can be downloaded from the http://braingraph.org site. The Consensus Connectome Dynamics (CCD) is a remarkable phenomenon that was discovered by continuously decreasing the minimum confidence-parameter at the graphical interface of the Budapest Reference Connectome Server. The Budapest Reference Connectome Server depicts the cerebral connections of n=418 subjects with a frequency-parameter k: For any k=1,2,...,n one can view the graph of the edges that are present in at least k connectomes. If parameter k is decreased one-by-one from k=n through k=1 then more and more edges appear in the graph, since the inclusion condition is relaxed. The surprising observation is that the appearance of the edges is far from random: it resembles a growing, complex structure, like a tree or a shrub (visualized on . It is hypothesized in that the growing structure copies the axonal development of the human brain: the earliest developing connections (axonal fibers) are common in most of the subjects, and the subsequently developing connections have larger and larger variance, because their variances are accumulated in the process of axonal development.  Genetic association  Axon guidance is genetically associated with other characteristics or features. For example, enrichment analyses of different signaling pathways led to the discovery of a genetic association with intracranial volume.

It is located on the Vale of Glamorgan Line, west of Cardiff Central towards Bridgend via Barry and Rhoose. The present station opened on 12 June 2005, when passenger services were restored on the section of line between Barry and Bridgend. Passenger services are operated by Transport for Wales as part of the Valleys & Cardiff Local Routes network. Original station Llantwit Major was one of the five original stations which opened along with the line in 1897. Originally, there were four lines of rails through it.Chapman, Colin. The Vale of Glamorgan Railway. The Oakwood Press, 1998, p.37. On the line's opening, the village of Llantwit Major lay to the south, separated from the station by fields, but the town has since expanded to the point where the station is now more or less in the centre.Chapman, Colin. The Vale of Glamorgan Railway. The Oakwood Press, 1998, p.151 The station had two platforms, each with a loop line, with a substantial red brick station building on the 'down' platform. The other platform had a smaller shelter. The goods yard was also on the 'down' side. This consisted of a loop line with a centrally-placed crossover which enabled access to the brick goods shed on the outer line of the loop. Extra sidings were added in around 1900. The station closed to regular passenger services in 1964 when these facilities were withdrawn along the line. The final passenger working at the old station was on 25 June 1965 when the royal train arrived at the 'down' platform. It conveyed the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh en route to an engagement at Atlantic College. Later, the Royal Party rejoined the train for the journey to Port Talbot where the Queen was to open the new Afan Lido.Chapman, Colin. The Vale of Glamorgan Railway.

In Ravinia Park's first summer of 1905, it hosted the New York Philharmonic, and the prairie style Martin Theater dates from this time period. It has been the summer home of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra (CSO) since 1936.CSO Sounds & Stories ¬ª CSO at Ravinia Located in Highland Park, Illinois, the festival operates on the grounds of the Ravinia Park, with a variety of outdoor and indoor performing arts facilities. The Ravinia neighborhood, once an incorporated village before annexation in 1899, is known as Ravinia, and retained its own post office until autumn 2010. The business district on Roger Williams Ave., within walking distance from the Ravinia Festival grounds, includes neighborhood service businesses and restaurants.Business District - Ravinia Ravinia takes its name from the ravines found nearby along the shoreline of Lake Michigan. Performance and other venues The Martin Theatre * The Pavilion, a 3,400-seat venue where the park's major music events and concerts, including Chicago Symphony Orchestra performances, are held. * The Martin Theatre, an 850-seat indoor hall often used for chamber music, semi-staged opera performances, Martinis at the Martin cabaret series, and other shows. * Bennett Gordon Hall, the 450-seat home of Ravinia's Steans Music Institute, the $10 BGH Classics Series, and also used for pre-concert discussions and preview concerts. Ravinia's Steans Music Institute is the Ravinia Festival's pre-professional summer conservatory program. Three programs comprise the Institute's summer season: the program for jazz; the program for piano and strings, and the program for singers.  Overview  In 1904, the A.C. Frost Company created Ravinia as an amusement park intended to lure riders to the fledgling Chicago and Milwaukee Electric Railroad. The amusement park boasted a baseball diamond, electric fountain and refectory or casino building with dining rooms and a dance floor. The prairie- style Martin Theatre (then called Ravinia Theatre) is the only building on the grounds that dates back to that original construction. When the park's existence became jeopardized following the railroad's bankruptcy, local residents (for the most part Chicago businessmen) formed a corporation in 1911 to purchase and operate the park. Music was a confirmed summer activity from then on, except for a brief hiatus during the Depression and during the COVID-19 pandemic, when the festival announced that it had cancelled all concerts for the 2020 season. Ravinia Festival 2006 Over 100 years later, Ravinia Festival is the oldest outdoor music festival in North America and is lauded for presenting world-class music. The festival attracts about 600,000 listeners to some 120 to 150 events that span all genres from classical music to jazz to music theater over each three-month summer season. Over the years, the festival has hosted many famous artists. In addition to symphony concerts, often with guest soloists, the festival presents opera, jazz, blues, folk, rock, and popular music performances, plus ballet, drama, and educational programs which take place year-round. Recent artists who have performed at Ravinia include John Legend, Aretha Franklin, Bryan Ferry, Diana Ross, Maroon 5, Common, Carrie Underwood, Tony Bennett, Lady Gaga, Josh Groban, Dolly Parton, Sheryl Crow, Patti LaBelle, Andrew Bird, Darius Rucker, Mary J.

The webcomic, which was originally intended for a niche audience of naturists, follows the inhabitants of a fictional nudist resort. Loxie & Zoot became somewhat notorious for the \\"pleasant\\" and realistic manner it presents its subject matter. Synopsis Loxie & Zoot is set in the fictional Koala Bay Bares Naturist Resort, a nudist resort where its varied cast of characters, including its title characters Loxie and Zoot, reside. During the several storylines of Loxie & Zoot, the inhabitants of the resort have to deal with a jewel thief, supernatural elements, and the villain Tex Tyler, who desires to shut the resort down. The world of Loxie & Zoot is presented in a very \\"pleasant\\" manner, with no cynicism or malice involved. Development Grace Crowley has been drawing comics since she was a child, and shortly after completing university, she found herself working for a publisher that specializes in educational comics, presenting realistic stories about specific heavy issues. Crowley stated that Loxie & Zoot \\"kind of flowed out of that to a degree,\\" noting that she was also reading many alternative, indie, and underground comics at the time. Crowley had enjoyed several visits to nude beaches during university, and figured a story about nudism could tap into a niche market. Crowley got one half-page cartoon of Loxie & Zoot published in an Australian nudist magazine in 1997, and in 1998, she started experimenting with publishing her story as a webcomic. However, because she was making the story up as she was going and was more focused on her day job, Crowley only managed to post nine pages before Loxie & Zoot went on an extended hiatus. Crowley attempted again in 2000, and managed to post the webcomic's first storyarc of 120 pages. On advice from Reinder Dijkhuis, Crowley transferred her webcomic to Keenspace in 2003, which prompted her to think more broadly of Loxie & Zoots target audience. In an interview with The Webcomics Examiner, Crowley stated that she \\"wanted to do a comic that went totally against the convention of comics of nudists that presented them all as young hour-glass figured women and chesty men.\\" Furthermore, Crowley wanted to subvert the practice of strategically drawing nude characters from the waist up or partially obscured in order to cover genitals, playing against the taboos and stereotypes of nudity and sexuality. Crowley went on to create the superhero webcomic Magellan for the platform Graphic Smash. Crowley also created some webcomics for Webcomics Nation. After the conclusion of Loxie & Zoot, Crowley began the spin-off webcomic The Bare Pit. Legacy In 2006, Crowley won a Ledger Award in the category for \\"Talent Deserving Wider Recognition\\". Despite its benign nature, Loxie & Zoot gained some notoriety among the webcomic community of its time due to its ubiquitous nudity.

Imprimatur dated 1867 A novena (from Latin: novem, \\"nine\\") is an ancient tradition of devotional praying in Christianity,; Quote: \\"Novenas are devotional prayers repeated nine successive times for special intentions.\\" consisting of private or public prayers repeated for nine successive days or weeks. The nine days between the Feast of the Ascension and Pentecost, when the disciples gathered in the upper room and devote themselves to prayer, is often considered to be the first novena. In some Christian communities, such as in Africa, Latin America and the Philippines, novena traditions are popular and include devotional rituals such as congregational prayers, statue decoration, hymn singing with music, as well as community fiesta events over beverages, refreshments or processions. Individuals may express love and honor by kneeling, burning candles or placing flowers before the person represented by a statue. Novenas are most often prayed by members of the Roman Catholic Church, but also by Anglicans, Eastern Orthodox Christians, and Lutherans. In addition, novenas have also been used in an ecumenical Christian context, such as those promulgated by Premier Christian Radio in an effort to pray for church renewal. The prayers are often derived from devotional prayer books, or consist of the recitation of the rosary (a \\"rosary novena\\"), or of short prayers through the day. Novena prayers are customarily printed in small booklets, and the novena is often dedicated to a specific angel, saint, Marian title of the Blessed Virgin Mary, or one of the personages of the Holy Trinity. In the Catholic tradition, much- used novena prayers include doctrinal statements in addition to a personal petition. The doctrinal part of the prayers are studied by its ecclesiastical staff, like formal translations of Christian scripture, and officially declared to be free of doctrinal errors with nihil obstat and imprimatur. History Novena likely has roots in ancient funeral-related rituals. Above: a group gathered for a novena to Our Lady of Mount Carmel, most likely a mourning event (c. 1940). The word Novena is rooted in the Latin word for nine. The practice of the novena is based in early Christianity, where Masses were held for nine days with devotional prayers to someone who has died. The practice may trace its origins to an early Greek and Roman custom performed by families, consisting of nine days of mourning after the death of a loved one, followed by a feast, which originally prompted Catholic writers such as St. Augustine, Pseudo-Alcuin and John Beleth to warn Christians not to emulate the custom. Over time, members of Roman Catholic faith began to associate novena with Christian themes such as the nine months Jesus spent in the womb, the giving up of His spirit at the ninth hour, and the event which occurred in the Upper Room with Twelve Apostles and the Blessed Virgin Mary when they prayed for nine days until the Holy Spirit descended on the Feast of the Pentecost. In the New Testament, this biblical event is often quoted from Acts of the Apostles, 1:12 ‚Äì 2:5. The Church Fathers also assigned special meaning to the number nine, seeing it as symbolic of imperfect man turning to God in prayer (due to its proximity with the number ten, symbolic of perfection and God). =Papal recognition= The practice of novena grew by the Middle Ages to include pious prayers for nine days before a feast in honor of a saint identified on a liturgical calendar. By the 11th century, the novena practice had become a means in Christianity of praying to petition spiritual or personal favor through a saint, such as Virgin Mary. After the Reformation and Counter-reformation era, the Catholic Church formally approved novenas, in particular through the papal approvals of a large number of novenas by Pope Pius IX. A group of women praying to Our Lady of the Gate of Dawn in Vilnius, Lithuania, for petitions. The leader is on the far left. In the Roman Catholic Church, there are three recognized categories of novenas, though this distinction is not exclusive: * Mourning, or before a burial; * In preparation for a Church feast; the revised Enchiridion Indulgentiarum assigns indulgenced novenas to particular feasts: \\"A partial indulgence is granted to the faithful, who devoutly take part in the pious exercises of a public novena before the feast of Christmas or Pentecost or the Immaculate Conception of the Blessed Virgin Mary.\\"Enchiridion Indulgentiarum, \\"34.(Novendiales preces)\\", Sacred Apostolic Penitentiary, 1968 * Intercessory (for a particular request). By standard liturgical norms, novenas are performed in church, at home, or anywhere where solemn prayers are appropriate, though some indulgenced novenas require church attendance. Sometimes, a special candle or incense is lit at the beginning of the novena which burns during the nine days of prayer. The first chapter of the General Principles of Sacrosanctum Concilium, #13, of the Second Vatican Council (1962-1965) sought to give guidance on the place of novenas in Christian piety: Within the Roman Catholic tradition, novena prayers typically include a praise of the Virgin Mary, Jesus Christ or a saint, acknowledgment of the Christian doctrines, and a personal petition. Other than the petition, the rest of much used prayers used in a public setting is studied by the clergy and then approved to be free from doctrinal and moral errors. The approval is given in the form of an Imprimatur, Nihil Obstat, and Imprimi potest. These ecclesiastical approval are usually granted by a bishop or any ranking prelate for publication and approval. Novenas have been a widespread practice in Catholic history. Novena prayers are also practised by Lutheran, Orthodox and Anglican Christians, who hold close or similar beliefs regarding its pious practice. In addition, novenas have also been used in an ecumenical Christian context, such as those promulgated by Premier Christian Radio, in order to pray for Church renewal. =Rituals= The statues of Jesus Christ and Virgin Mary at a church consecration A novena is a ritualistic devotional worship where one or more Christian devotees make petitions, implore favors, or obtain graces by honoring Jesus Christ, Virgin Mary or the saints of the faith who are believed to empower divine intervention., Quote: Novena, Roman Catholic devotions consisting of prayers or services held on nine consecutive days or weeks honoring Mary, the mother of Jesus, or the saints According to Fenella Cannell ‚Äì a professor of Anthropology specializing in Christianity, a Novena is \\"a supplicatory act of worship\\". In Christian communities of Philippines and Latin America, novena traditions include devotional rituals in front of an altar, with nine levels where the Holy Cross is placed at the top. These are lit up with candles, decorated with flowers and other ritual items. Additionally, the space may have many statues decorated, and these statues typically include those of Virgin Mary, Apostles and saints of regional significance. The first day, the votive candles are placed on level one, and with each day the candles are raised by one level towards the Holy Cross. Further, each day includes congregational prayers, hymn singing with music, private and public devotionals. Some novenas include, sometimes on the last day, community fiesta events over beverages, refreshments or processions. Rosary Novena is linked to religious death rituals. Among the Filipino Catholic Christians, the Rosary Novena has been a prayer practice for nine days starting the day when someone dies, with formal funeral services timed to the ninth day. Elsewhere, the day of funeral service or when the body is interred is timed to local customary practices, while the nine day novena is held at the home of the deceased as elsewhere. Regional practices =Africa= Novena practices were introduced into communities by Christian missionaries in their colonial era and postmodern era proselytization efforts in Africa, as well as new world plantation colonies where African slaves were settled such as in Brazil. These initiatives brought a sense of socioreligious community. Some practices are unique to Africa. Various denominations of Christianity in Africa have introduced regional novena practices that include devotional prayers, singing, and clap, wave, or shout offerings. The novena devotionalism in Ghana includes on each of the nine nights, after the loud prayers, the blood-covering of Jesus, where the devotees stain themselves considering it to be symbolism for the blood of Christ. Among the coastal West African Christian communities, novena is a means of petitioning God through worship and fasting, along with traditional rituals. Syncretic new age religious practices in Nigeria have adopted the nine day of novena prayer ritualism.Michael C. Mbabuike (1996), Skimming the New Waves: A Survey of New Age Religions in Nigeria, Journal of Black Studies, Vol. 26, No. 4 (Mar., 1996), pages 401-413 In Zimbabwe, according to Lawrence Daka ‚Äì a professor and a Zimbabwean Jesuit, =Europe and North America= Devotional and paraliturgical novenas have been common in Europe as well as with European settlers in North America. These have included public worship such as Mass and private praying with religious items such as a rosary and images particularly related to the Virgin Mary. According to James M. O'Toole, a professor of History specializing in American Catholic history, the period between World War I and mid-1950s were the \\"heyday of American Catholic devotionalism\\". This period witnessed novena devotionalism along with popularity of sodalities, confraternities, devotion to saints, meatless Fridays, holy cards, rosary, cross and eucharistic practices.John Huels (1976), The Popular Appeal of the Sorrowful Mother Novena, Marianum, Volume 38, pages 191-199 These provided a sense of communal identification, states O'Toole, particularly in a time of mass migration. The novena had strong roots in ethnic neighborhoods, and devotional worship had sociopolitical links, offering a sense of communal security through religious symbols in a period of uncertainty and fear. As economic prosperity and a sense of national solidarity grew in and after the 1960s, the novena ritualism waned and the participation in church worship services fell.Timothy Kelly and Joseph Kelly (1998), Our Lady of Perpetual Help, Gender Roles, and the Decline of Devotional Catholicism, Journal of Social History, Oxford University Press, Vol. 32, No. 1 (Autumn, 1998), pages 5-26 A Marian novena wall painting in France, with tagline: \\"What do you want me to ask to My divine Son?\\". In Eastern and Central Europe, novena practices continue. For example, novenas among the faithful in the Czech Republic include nine hour prayers dedicated to the Infant Jesus of Prague, where the devotee can plead personal, urgent needs before the statue of the Christ Child, and on May 27 every year, the statue is ceremoniously paraded through the streets of Prague with prayers and songs. During the communist era, the devout orthodox Christians in the former Yugoslavia organized the Great Novena under the statue of Virgin Mary, to resist the state enforced atheism, to maintain the freedom to practice religion, and to re-assert the Christian legacy of the region, particularly in Croatia. In Catholic Ireland, states Professor Gladys Ganiel, devotional practices such as novenas have been popular. The cultural acceptance of devotional worship has been historically high, and those Irish who themselves do not perform novenas, nevertheless respect those who do. Some of their Catholic ritual practices were repressed by the British state during the 18th and 19th centuries, but repression and criticism only increased the resolve of the Irish to persist in their ways of practicing their faith. In North America, annual novenas are observed in some regions such as in Montreal, Canada, where between March 10 and 19 the annual novena ends on a feast of Saint Joseph. A religious survey, published in the 1921 Bulletin of the University of Notre Dame, states that novena prayers were popular, and particularly common among students during examinations, or illness, or after the death of a fellow student. The Novena-Seance remain popular in many regions of the United States, such as among the Roman Catholics of Louisiana where novenas are dedicated to St. Jude and the Virgin Mary. These novenas are prayers believed to create a contact between the saint and the devotee, and thereby invoke divine intervention in whatever problem or anxiety is important to the devotee. Las Posadas is a novena celebrated chiefly in Latin America, Mexico, Guatemala, Cuba, and by Hispanics in the United States. It is typically celebrated each year between December 16 and December 24. =Latin America= The novena has been an important part of Christianity in the Caribbean and Latin America, both among the native Indian communities who converted to Christianity under the colonial Spanish or Portuguese rule, as well as the diverse communities that formed anew from millions of slaves and indentured laborers brought to the Americas from different parts of Africa and Asia. The devotional prayers are dedicated to statues of Jesus Christ, Madonna and various saints. They are also a part of velorio (wake) after the death of someone, which includes nine nights of novena (rezos de los nueve d√≠as).John Thomas Harricharan (1981), Divina pastora: novena prayers, Trinidad Services, According to Patrick Taylor and Frederick Case, the attendance to Christian religious services has been low, except after the death of a loved one or a significant socio-political individual, and during the times of difficulty such as epidemics or a drought. Many perform devotional worship with rosaries within their home before images of Christ and the Christian saints at a small dedicated altar within their living spaces. Like proselytism in Africa and Asia, missionaries of various denominations of Christianity, including Protestantism, have championed novenas in Hispanic-Latino communities as a part of their efforts to attract new converts to their ministries. Colombians celebrate a novena in the nine days leading to Christmas, known as the novena of aguinaldos. =India= Novenas are still a common sight in India, especially in the state of Kerala. They are practised by Roman Catholics and oriental Catholics (e.g. Syro-Malabar Christians and Syro-Malankara Christians) and by the Orthodox Christians (Malankara Orthodox Christians and Jacobite Orthodox Christians). Novenas are common to Mother Mary (recited every Saturday), Saint George (common by the Orthodox and recited every Wednesday), Saint Jude and others. =Philippines and Melanesia= Novenas remain a popular devotional practice in the Philippines.Gerry Pierse (1991), Popular Religiosity: A Philippine Experience, The Furrow, Vol. 42, No. 4 (Apr., 1991), pages 232-236 It is observed, for example, in the Simbang Gabi immediately preceding Christmas, and the novena preceding the Feast of the Santo Ni√±o de Ceb√∫ (Holy Child) on the third Sunday of January. The first nine days are marked with prayers, petitions and singing. During the main procession, the Santo Ni√±o image is taken through the streets of Cebu City, with many people carrying their own replicas, decorated according to their own tastes. In Loboc, Bohol, the most popular novena is dedicated to a Black Madonna statue, with each service called the Gozos, which includes a chanting of praises to the Virgin in Spanish and Visayan, dancing, choir recitals, and a feast with fireworks on the last day. In Manila, popular novenas to Our Lady of Perpetual Help, Saint Jude Thaddeus, and the Black Nazarene are assigned to the last three days of the week. Each novena is associated with a particular shrine, and have all been approved by the Holy See. Some organizations have also begun offering the novena rituals online for devotees. The Novena to Our Mother of Perpetual Help is observed on nine consecutive Wednesdays in Baclaran. The Saint Jude novena on Thursdays invokes the apostle's status as the Patron Saint of Lost Causes, and is popular with students taking examinations. The Black Nazarene novena held on Fridays marks the journey of Christ with the cross to his crucifixion. The image, novena, and associated devotional practices have a large following. In 2011, over six million Catholic devotees flocked to the Black Nazarene procession in Manila alone.Jose Alain Austria (2012), Hijos de Enero 9: Quiapo‚Äôs Black Nazarene Procession as a Male Rite of Passage, Manila Journal, Volume 8, Number 1, page 15; Quote: \\"This year [2011] approximately 6.5 million devotees flocked to Quiapo and the Luneta, joining the longest procession on record of sixteen hours.\\" In 19th century Melanesia, the Christian clergy linked the end of epidemics, such as the measles of 1860, and credited the survival of the communities after major disasters to the dedicated and great outburst of prayers to Christian icons, to \\"fervent novena\\". Similarly, the Black Madonna novenas in Luboc started after similar crediting by the Christian clergy that the island community survived after a severe epidemic of cholera because they made devotional prayers to the Virgin Mary (Madonna) during their time of suffering.

It's located in the historic Carriage Town district area of downtown Flint, Michigan. In 2019 it became the home field for the Flint City Bucks, a soccer club that competes in USL League Two, as well as Powers Catholic High School. The annual Vehicle City Gridiron Classic also opens the high school football season at Atwood Stadium, with six to eight teams competing each season. The Flint Institute of Music hosts an annual Independence Day concert in the stadium, which is coordinated with Flint's fireworks display, which is launched from the Chevy Commons park, located to the south immediately across the Flint River from the stadium. The stadium was named after Edwin W. Atwood, who was elected as the Mayor of the City of Flint in 1920, and also donated a portion of the site for the stadium. It has hosted boxing matches, UAW strikes, high school football, minor-league baseball, election stump speeches, and concerts over the years. Originally Atwood Stadium had a natural grass field, but in 1968 began using artificial turf. Atwood's turf was ruled unsafe, leading to the stadium's closure in 1992. The stadium reopened in 1995 after $3.5 million in improvements, including a new artificial turf field, and resumed hosting football games for Flint Community Schools. Kettering University received ownership after Flint Emergency Manager Mike Brown ordered the city to transfer ownership in 2013, with the university undertaking the cost of emergency repairs to permit the stadium to continue operation. In 2015 the stadium underwent over $2 million in renovations to the restrooms, press box, concourse, exterior and playing field, and hosted Powers Catholic, Flint Southwestern and Flint Northwestern high school football in the fall of 2015. The new FieldTurf surface has permanent lines for regulation high school football, soccer, and lacrosse. The field goal posts are permanently mounted whereas soccer and lacrosse goals are moved into position as needed. As the field goal uprights are not hinged and therefore cannot tipped back during soccer matches, the uprights are in bounds above the soccer goal. Since 2019, the Flint City Bucks soccer team and Powers Catholic High School's football, boys and girls soccer, boys and girls lacrosse, and marching band programs share Atwood Stadium as their home field. Kettering University's intramural and recreational sports programs also extensively use the field, however the university has no varsity intercollegiate athletic programs. Perhaps uniquely, Atwood Stadium is a university-owned public stadium which has permanent regulation markings for high school football but no such markings for college football. The stadium seating surrounds the field on three sides and is open on the south side, allowing spectators to overlook the paved parking area, the Flint River, and Chevy Commons park beyond. A Genesee County park trail runs along the south edge of the Atwood Stadium paved parking lot along the riverside. Kettering University leaves a portion of the paved parking area publicly accessible to allow residents to fish the river. The stadium received its nickname, \\"The Beautiful Stadium of Ours,\\" from the River Rats, the original Bucks supporters' group. The group's tradition is to sing about the stadium as they march to every home match. History Atwood Stadium opened on June 8, 1929 and was named after Edwin W. Atwood who donated a portion of the site for the stadium. From 1930 through 1976 the Annual Football game between Flint Central High School with Lynn Chandnois and Tony Branoff and Flint Northern High School with Leroy Bolden and Ellis Duckett who played on Thanksgiving Day and drew attendance in the tens of thousands of people. The 1950 game with Branoff, Duckett, and Bolden drew a record crowd of 20,600, thanks to standing room and temporary seating. Due to the development of state playoffs after 1976, the game was no longer held on Thanksgiving Day. Prior to the closure of Flint Central in 2009, Central won the overall series 41-39-1. Only four of the 81 meetings were not held at Atwood. The inaugural meeting in 1928 was held at Dort Field behind Flint Central. The 1929 meeting was held at Viking Field behind the original Flint Northern. Due to the stadium's temporary closure in 1992, the 1993 and 1994 Central-Northern games were held at Guy V. Houston Stadium, located near Flint Northwestern. President Franklin D. Roosevelt delivered a speech at the stadium in 1936.April 26, 2014.

More recently, it hosted a homecoming tribute to 2009 Heisman Trophy winner and Flint Southwestern Academy graduate Mark Ingram, Jr. Heisman Trophy winner Mark Ingram II says 'it feels good to be home' in Flint Flint Journal May 22, 2010 City of Flint Emergency Manager Mike Brown signed over ownership of Atwood Stadium in 2013 to Kettering University. In the past Atwood Stadium hosted the Michigan Invitational Tournament, a high school marching band competition hosted by Flushing High School, which at the time was one of the longest-running marching band competitions in Michigan. Atwood was home to the annual season opening game between Flint Northwestern and Flint Beecher. Beecher is coached by former NFL player Courtney Hawkins, while Northwestern also has a famous alum as a coach, former NFL wide receiver Andre Rison. Beecher won the 2010 opener, 28-18, while Northwestern took the 2011 opener, 46-44, in double overtime. During odd-numbered years, it was also been the site of Powers Catholic's football game against Nouvel Catholic Central High School; when Powers is the home team, it was usually played at the beginning of the season. With community gifts from Diplomat Pharmacy, Charles Stewart Mott Foundation and Kettering University in 2015, the university oversaw over $2 million in renovations and improvements to help reopen the stadium in time for the 2015 high school football season. Since then, the Flint high schools have consolidated and no longer use Atwood Stadium as a home stadium. This alleviated scheduling conflicts which occasionally displaced Flint Southwestern home openers to Guy Houston Stadium. Since 2017, Atwood Stadium has hosted the Vehicle City Gridiron Classic to mark the start of the Michigan high school football season. Six to eight teams participate. Although Powers Catholic had previously played games over several seasons at Atwood Stadium as the home team, the school formally adopted Atwood Stadium as its home field for football, boys and girls soccer, boys and girls lacrosse, and marching band in 2019, using it as the site of competition and practice, although every other year they still open the season with a \\"home away from home\\" game at Aagason Field at Holy Redeemer, home of the Bendle High School Tigers in Burton, Michigan due to the aforementioned Vehicle City Gridiron Classic. Powers Catholic shares the \\"home of\\" title with the Flint City Bucks USL League Two soccer team, who also moved to Atwood Stadium in 2019. In April 2020, Kettering University partnered with Hurley Medical Center to allow the hospital to set up a drive through COVID-19 testing clinic at the stadium, which is located one block south of the hospital. Road Races The Atwood Stadium Races, formerly the Tuuri, is set of road races, kid's dash, 5K and 10K, that begin and end at the stadium and hosted by the Crim Fitness Foundation in partnership with Kettering University. The races are typically held on the fourth Saturday in July. It is an official Crim Training Program voucher race and is known as a training race for the Crim. Racers can choose to run the \\"duo\\", both races. The Tuuri 10K road race, named after Flint pediatrician Arthur L. Tuuri, began in 1979. The first four years, the winners won with sub-30-minute times. In 1981, Greg Meyer, a Michigan native, set the record of 29:28. In 1991, the race had its peak number of finisher with 1,176. In 2010, the Hurley Foundation ran its last Tuuri road race despite it being one of top Flint area races with 856 runners in 2010. A committee of runners led by Brian and Dorie Barkey attempt to have the Turri race be continued by Hurley or picked up by the Crim Fitness Foundation. Instead the committee staged the races in 2011 as the Atwood Stadium Road Races, hoping the nearby Carriage Town Ministries' festival would help the race and vice versa. The 10K and 5K had only changes to it starting and ending at Atwood Stadium. In 2018 and 2019, Kettering University operated the road races with the route being changed taking the runners past Chevy Commons, the Flint River Trail, Mott Park, the Educare Center, Glenwood Cemetery and Kettering's new Mobility Research Center.

She was named for John Lorimer Worden. History Worden was laid down on 30 June 1919 at Squantum, Massachusetts, by the Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corporation; launched on 24 October 1919; sponsored by Mrs. Emilie Neilson Worden; and commissioned on 24 February 1920 at the Boston Navy Yard, Lieutenant Commander David H. Stuart in command. The destroyer spent the first four years of her decade of active service in operations along the Atlantic coast of the United States. After fitting out, she departed Boston loaded torpedoes and spare parts at Newport, Rhode Island, and embarked upon her shakedown cruise to Key West and Cuban waters. She completed that voyage at New York on 1 May and joined Destroyer Division 42, 3d Squadron, Atlantic Fleet. From May to July, she conducted operations along the length of the Atlantic seaboard, from Key West to Newport. On 21 July, she arrived in Charleston and remained there until the following summer. On 25 June 1921, she departed Charleston, South Carolina for a 4 July visit to New York and gunnery practice off Block Island. In August, she made a voyage to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, with Naval Academy midshipmen embarked, returning them to Annapolis, Maryland, on the 22nd. Worden stopped briefly at Hampton Roads, then headed via New York to Boston for repairs at the navy yard which she completed early in November. On the 16th, she loaded torpedoes at Newport and headed south to Charleston, where she arrived on the 18th. She remained there until the spring of 1922. On 29 May of that year, she got underway for a voyage which took her up the coast to Philadelphia; thence to Yorktown, Virginia, a temporary base for battle practice and gunnery drills. Late in July, Worden made a brief cruise to New York and then returned to the southern drill grounds located off the Virginia capes. During August, September, and October, she conducted battle practice off the capes, departing the area periodically for visits to New York; Beaufort, North Carolina; and Newport. On 21 November, the destroyer entered port at Boston for a repair period which lasted until the end of 1922. Shen then left Boston and loaded torpedoes at Newport on New Year's Day 1923. On 5 January, she arrived at Lynnhaven Roads, Virginia, but, soon thereafter, continued south to Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, where she resumed gun and torpedo drills through the end of the month. On 12 February, she transited the Panama Canal with the Scouting Fleet for Fleet Problem I, the first set of combined maneuvers with Battle Fleet, conducted in the Gulf of Panama. She retransited the canal on 27 March and resumed training in the Guantanamo Bay area until late April. After visits to several gulf coast ports (Galveston, Texas, New Orleans, Louisiana, Tampa, Florida and Key West) she returned to Newport on 15 May. Early in June, she visited Washington, D.C., and, by mid-month, had entered the Philadelphia Navy Yard for repairs. Worden left Philadelphia on 12 October and resumed gunnery drills and battle practice at the southern drill grounds off the Virginia capes. Those drills, punctuated by visits to Fall River, Massachusetts, and to Baltimore, Maryland, occupied her time until mid-November, at which time she entered the Philadelphia Navy Yard for repairs to a ruptured boiler. On 3 January 1924, Worden departed Philadelphia and, after a brief stop at Lynnhaven Roads, rendezvoused with Scouting Fleet as a unit of its screen. Conducting drills and exercises along the way, Scouting Fleet headed for Col√≥n, Panama, where the warships refueled before continuing on to Culebra Island with the combined United States Fleet (Scouting Fleet and Battle Fleet). Worden participated in the annual spring exercises in the West Indies until late spring. On 4 May, she arrived back in Philadelphia to prepare for her first and only deployment outside the western hemisphere. After a brief repair period at Boston and a visit to Newport, under the command of Commander Allen B. Reed USNDirectory of Naval Officers, 1 July 1924 she headed across the Atlantic in mid-June. On the 27th, she passed through the Strait of Gibraltar to begin a year of duty with the United States Naval Forces Europe. During the early portion of that tour, Worden called at Palermo, Sicily, and then headed for the Adriatic Sea. Her tour in the Adriatic was probably influenced by the murder of two Americans in the newly established state of Albania and the internal strife which followed and which resulted in the ousting of prime minister Ahmed Zogu and his temporary replacement by a provisional government under Fan S. Noli. During her stay in the Adriatic, Worden visited Pula (now Croatia) and Venice in Italy and Split (now Croatia) in Kingdom of Yugoslavia as well as Durr√´s in troubled Albania. Later in the year, the destroyer left the Mediterranean for visits to Gravesend, England, Cherbourg, France, Leith, Scotland and Amsterdam in the Netherlands. At the conclusion of that circuit, she returned to the Mediterranean and continued her tour of duty with Naval Forces, Europe, until the summer of 1925. She returned to New York on 16 July of that year and resumed her former schedule of operations with the Scouting Fleet. On 13 September, she entered the Philadelphia Navy Yard for repairs. The destroyer did not leave the yard until December. On the 7th, she headed south to join in the annual winter maneuvers held in the West Indies and in Panama Bay on the Pacific side of the isthmus. Scouting Fleet transited the canal on 4 and 5 February 1926 to join Battle Fleet for Fleet Problem VI in Panama Bay. In March, Worden returned to the Caribbean with Scouting Fleet and resumed battle practice, gunnery drills, and torpedo exercises in the West Indies. She completed that phase of her 1926 training schedule late in the spring and arrived back in Philadelphia on 5 May. During the early part of the summer, the warship continued her training schedule, this time off the New England coast near Narragansett Bay. On 2 July, she entered the Philadelphia Navy Yard for a three-month repair period. On 11 October, Worden stood out of Philadelphia on her way south once more. After a brief stop at Hampton Roads, the destroyer continued on her way and arrived in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, on the 16th. For the next month, she conducted engineering trials and battle practice near Haiti in the Gulf of Gonaives. Returning north in mid-November, she visited the Naval Academy for a time before heading back to Philadelphia where she arrived on 15 December. The warship bade farewell to Philadelphia once again on 5 January 1927 and pointed her bow southward for a stop at Yorktown followed by the 1927 edition of the annual winter maneuvers. She reached Guantanamo Bay on 12 January and commenced gunnery and battle practice with Scouting Fleet in preparation for the annual Fleet problem. In contrast to the previous fleet problems in which she had participated, Fleet Problem VII brought Battle Fleet to the Caribbean instead of taking Scouting Fleet to the Pacific. The exercise was staged in March; and, by late April, Worden had returned north, this time to New York City. During the summer of 1927, she conducted normal training exercises off the Atlantic coast and participated in the Fleet Review conducted off Cape Henry, Virginia, in June for President Calvin Coolidge. On 11 September, she entered the Philadelphia Navy Yard and remained there for the rest of the year. On 7 January 1928, she started south from Philadelphia. This time, however, she participated only in the preliminary drills and exercises for the annual fleet problem. She headed back to Philadelphia in April and arrived there on the 14th. Meanwhile, Scouting Fleet and Battle Fleet joined and executed Fleet Problem VIII in the broad expanse of the Pacific between San Francisco, and the Hawaiian Islands. A month later, Worden returned to sea for her usual round of operations along the Atlantic seaboard. That duty lasted until late in October at which time her base of operations changed to Charleston. Local operations out of that port occupied her time until early December when she returned north to Philadelphia for a month. In January 1929, she moved to Norfolk for repairs to her turbines; and, after post-repair trials in the Chesapeake Bay in February, she headed south for winter maneuvers. The destroyer arrived at Guantanamo Bay on 28 February. She concluded her part in those exercises later in the spring and returned north, arriving in New York on 2 May. During the summer, she conducted normal operations along the northeastern coast. Fate On 21 September, Worden arrived in Philadelphia. The warship remained there until she was decommissioned on 1 May 1930. Her name was struck from the Navy list on 22 October 1930, and she was sold for scrapping on 17 January 1931 according to the Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships. Other sources state she was converted into an express fruit carrier MV Tabasco See for other ships of this name.

Formed in 1995 under the name Hinge, they have released three albums. History =Psychodrama Records (1997‚Äì1999)= After being together as a band for four years, they recorded and released (under their previous band name, Hinge) their first EP in 1997 titled Cause Moshing is Good Fun under Psychodrama Records ‚Äì the band's own label. The band's second EP Elemental Evil (1999) was once again released through their own label. The nine-track disc led them to open for many well-recognized acts including Coal Chamber, Incubus, Anthrax and System of a Down. =The Darker Side of Nonsense (2000‚Äì2003)= In 2000, Hinge signed a record deal with Roadrunner Records. After signing with the label, they were forced to change their name due to a recording studio owning the copyright to the same name. They briefly changed their name from Hinge to Hinge A.D., but ultimately settled upon Dry Kill Logic after the studio threatened legal action if they used the word \\"Hinge\\" anywhere in their name. On June 5, 2001, their debut album The Darker Side of Nonsense was released. The album features a guest spot from Primer 55 members J-Sin (vocals) and Bobby Burns (guitar) on the track \\"Give Up, Give In, Lie Down\\". The band spent the better part of 2001 and 2002 on tour, performing around the world with such bands as Fear Factory, Kittie, Ill Ni√±o, Spineshank, Saliva, Slayer and many others. The album went on to sell approximately 100,000 copies worldwide. However, due to Roadrunner wanting \\"a more commercial sound on the band's second effort\\", the band decided to part ways with the label in October 2002. Around the same time, the band split with guitarist Scott Thompson, replacing him with former Gargantua Soul guitarist Jason Bozzi, who remains with the group to this day. =The Dead and Dreaming (2004‚Äì2006)= On October 5, 2004, the band released their second major album The Dead and Dreaming, via Psychodrama Music Group with deals through two independent record labels ‚Äì Repossession Records and German label SPV Records. This forward thinking arrangement was spearheaded by PMG and not only ensured a simultaneous worldwide release but also positioned the band to be the driving force behind every aspect of their career. Heading back in their van in 2004 the band toured for 15 months straight, beginning with Mot√∂rhead in Germany and working their way up to co-headlining tours with Hed PE and Drowning Pool, culminating with being hand picked by Dave Mustaine to become a crowd favorite on the 2005 Gigantour arena tour. The band also made waves overseas, and in 2006 headlined two tours of the UK and Europe as well as touring Australia with Fear Factory and Devildriver. On June 27, 2006, the band produced, designed and directed their first DVD/EP, The Magellan Complex, which was a lead up for the band's upcoming album. The disc includes three songs and a bonus DVD consisting of the music video for \\"Paper Tiger\\", a live performance/interview piece from the Otep/American Head Charge tour (February 2005, New Orleans) as well as behind the scenes footage of the band on tour. This project was put together by the band for the fans, and includes artwork by guitarist Jason Bozzi, audio production by Phil Arcuri and video direction by Cliff Rigano. The band also demanded a low retail price in order to make the product more affordable for their fans worldwide. This EP also marked the first recordings with new bassist Brendan Kane Duff. =Of Vengeance and Violence (2006‚Äì2018)= On September 19, 2006, Dry Kill Logic's third full- length album Of Vengeance and Violence was released worldwide via Psychodrama/Repossession Records. The band embarked on tours of Australia and Europe throughout 2006. The band has plans for performances in the United States, Canada and Japan, as well as return trips to Europe and Australia, through 2007. Repossession Records closed its doors in January 2007, and the band plans on releasing all their upcoming new material directly through Psychodrama Music Group. Since the late 2000s, the band has been dormant, as the members have gone on to explore new ventures. =Return to music and untitled fourth studio album (2018‚Äìpresent)= As of December 7, 2018, They have announced via Facebook that \\"New music will be heard. Spread the word\\" Also posting photos of possible studio time. In January 2019, the band began posting teaser clips on social media of new music. In July 2019, the band announced their signing to eOne Music with their new single \\"Vices\\" being released on September 6. On September 9, 2020 it was announced a new single entitled \\"Don't See Ghosts\\" would be released on September 18, 2020. The band released the song on their official Youtube page September 17, 2020. Other Recordings As a bonus feature in the video game MLB Slugfest 2003, the band did a special recording and music video for the game.

The Canon and his Yeoman are not mentioned in the General Prologue of The Canterbury Tales, where most of the other pilgrims are described, but they arrive later after riding fast to catch up with the group.

The second part is about another canon who is also an alchemist who is even more devious than the first.

It is believed it was one of the last tales to be written and it seems to many scholars such a lively attack on alchemists that Chaucer must have had a real person in mind. In 1374 a chaplain called William de Brumley confessed to making counterfeit gold coins after being taught by William Shuchirch. Shuchirch was a canon at King's Chapel, Windsor and in 1390 Chaucer supervised repairs of the chapel so he may have known Shuchirch. No sources have survived for the tale although similarities can be found to one by Ramon Llull. Chaucer probably got much of the technical detail from Speculum Naturale (Mirror of Nature) by Vincent of Beauvais, and Arnold of Villanova is mentioned within the tale itself although he may have read many other alchemical texts. Chaucer's grasp of alchemy seems very accurate and in the 17th century the tale was cited by Elias Ashmole as proof that Chaucer was master of the science. Chaucer did have a great interest in science and technology, writing a Treatise on the Astrolabe.  Synopsis  The Yeoman seems much the more talkative of the two arrivals. When Harry Bailly, the host, asks the Canon for a tale, his yeoman chips in to announce how clever his master is, saying: :That al this ground on which we been ridyng, :Til that we come to Caunterbury toun, :He koude al clene turnen up-so-doun, :And pave it al of silver and of gold. The host then asks why the Canon is dressed so poorly if he is so clever and the Yeoman admits that he may have wit but he misuses it. He then explains his master is an alchemist: :And borwe gold, be it a pound or two, :Or ten, or twelve, or manye sommes mo, :And make hem wenen, at the leeste weye, :That of a pound we koude make tweye. The Canon tries unsuccessfully to silence his Yeoman but ends up fleeing in shame; after which the Yeoman feels free to tell the history of the Canon. He describes how the Canon works to discover the philosopher's stone and many of the processes he goes through but how in the end the pot breaks and they lose most of the metal they had. He then continues with a story of a second canon who sells to a priest an alchemical 'crap' for producing silver after tricking him into believing that he can produce the metal spontaneously. After each of the tales the Yeoman adds a moral such as: :But al thyng which that shineth as the gold :Nis nat gold, as that I have herd it told; He also explains that we should not try to discover things keeps secret as it will not succeed and be like picking a fight with God. :He wills that it not discovered be, :Save where it's pleasing to His deity... :...sith that God of hevene :Ne wil nat that the philosophres nevene :How that a man shal come unto this stoon, :I rede, as for the beste, lete it goon. The Canon Yeoman tells how he was once a happy man who wore fine clothing, but has now degraded into poverty - he must wear his stocking for a cap; he is so deep in debt that he can never repay loans no matter how long he lives or how \\"talented\\" he is; his face is grey and the colour of lead, implying that his pursuit of alchemy has left him suffering from lead poisoning and mortally ill.  Influence  Ben Jonson's play The Alchemist bears many similarities to Chaucer's tale. Chaucer has also described him as wearing green at all times.

The first Carmelites were Christian hermits living on Mount Carmel in the Holy Land during the late 12th and early to mid-13th century. They built in the midst of their hermitages a chapel which they dedicated to the Blessed Virgin, whom they conceived of in chivalric terms as the \\"Lady of the place.\\" Our Lady of Mount Carmel was adopted in the 19th century as the patron saint of Chile, in South America. Since the 15th century, popular devotion to Our Lady of Mount Carmel has centered on the Scapular of Our Lady of Mount Carmel, also known as the Brown Scapular. Traditionally, Mary is said to have given the Scapular to an early Carmelite named Saint Simon Stock (1165-1265). The liturgical feast of Our Lady of Mount Carmel is celebrated on 16 July.Scapular Devotion.\\" July‚ÄìAugust 2005, Discalced Carmelite Secular Order, Washington Province. The solemn liturgical feast of Our Lady of Mount Carmel was probably first celebrated in England in the later part of the 14th century. Its object was thanksgiving to Mary, the patroness of the Carmelite Order, for the benefits she had accorded to it through its difficult early years. The institution of the feast may have come in the wake of the vindication of their title \\"Brothers of the Blessed Virgin Mary\\" at Cambridge, England, in 1374. The date chosen was 17 July; on the European mainland this date conflicted with the feast of St. Alexis, requiring a shift to 16 July, which remains the Feast of Our Lady of Mount Carmel throughout the Catholic Church. The Latin poem \\"Flos Carmeli\\" (meaning \\"Flower of Carmel\\") first appears as the sequence for this Mass.Bede Edwards, OCDS. \\"St. Simon Stock‚ÄîThe Scapular Vision & the Brown Scapular Devotion.\\" Carmel Clarion Volume XXI, pp 17‚Äì22, July‚ÄìAugust 2005, Discalced Carmelite Secular Order, Washington Province. History The Carmelite Order was the only religious order to be started in the Crusader States. In the 13th century, some of its people migrated west to England, setting up a chapter and being documented there about 1241‚Äì1242. A tradition first attested to in the late 14th century says that Saint Simon Stock, believed to be an early English prior general of the Carmelite Order soon after its migration to England, had a vision of the Blessed Virgin Mary in which she gave him the Brown Scapular. This formed part of the Carmelite habit after 1287.Jotischky, Carmelites and Antiquity, p. 59, footnote In Stock's vision, Mary promised that those who died wearing the scapular would be saved. This is a devotional sacramental signifying the wearer's consecration to Mary and affiliation with the Carmelite order. It symbolizes her special protection and calls the wearers to consecrate themselves to her in a special way.\\"Our Lady of Mount Carmel\\", Franciscan Media In 1642, a Carmelite named Fr. John Cheron published a document which he said was a 13th-century letter written by Saint Simon Stock's secretary, Peter Swanington. Since the early 20th century, historians have concluded that this letter was forged, likely by Cheron himself.Fr. Paul D'Souza, OCD. \\"The Carmelite Scapular: History and Devotion\\", St. John the Baptist Church, BangaloreHerbert Thurston, S.J., \\"The Origin of the Scapular ‚Äì A Criticism\\", The Irish Ecclesiastical Record, Vol XVI July‚ÄìDecember 1904. pp. 59‚Äì75. Dublin: Browne & Nolan, Limited. This 1904 article demonstrates that the Swanington letter was not authentic. It also says that the papal bull that was the basis of the \\"Sabbatine privilege\\" was forged. The article explores Carmelite history and the evolution of the scapular devotion. But Stock's vision was long embraced by many promoters of the scapular devotion. The forged Swanington letter claimed that 16 July 1251 was the date of the vision (16 July being the date of the Feast of Our Lady of Mount Carmel), which led for centuries to a strong association between this feast day and the scapular devotion. Based on available historical documentation, the liturgical feast of Our Lady of Mount Carmel did not originally have a specific association with the Brown Scapular or the tradition of Stock's vision of the Blessed Virgin Mary. This tradition grew gradually, as did the liturgical cult of St. Simon. The latter has been documented in Bordeaux, where Stock died, from the year 1435; in Ireland and England, from 1458; and in the rest of the Order, from 1564. Historians have long questioned whether Stock had the vision of Mary and the scapular.Louis Saggi, O. Carm. \\"Saint Simon Stock (XIII Century) Saint, Priest\\", Scholarly historical information, Carmel Net Although Simon Stock was never officially canonized, his feast day was celebrated in the church. The Carmelite convent of Aylesford, England, was restored and a relic of Saint Simon Stock was placed there in 1951. The saint's feast is celebrated in the places dedicated to him. Also associated with Our Lady of Carmel was a papal bull saying that there was a Sabbatine privilege associated with devotion to the saint; that is, until the late 1970s, the Catholic liturgy for that day mentioned the scapular devotion. Vatican II resulted in scrutiny of the Feast of Our Lady of Mount Carmel, as well as that of Saint Simon Stock, because of the historical uncertainties about the origins. The liturgies were revised and, in the 21st century, neither, even in the Carmelite proper, makes reference to the scapular. A saqra (animal figure) dancer watching the procession of Mamacha Carmen from a balcony In Spain and other Spanish- speaking countries, there has been particular devotion to Our Lady of Mount Carmel, who has been adopted as a patron saint of several places, as she has been in other Catholic-majority countries. In addition, Carmen and Mar√≠a del Carmen have been popular given names for girls in Spanish-speaking countries. An annual festival, known as Mamacha Carmen, is held in the highland Paucartambo District, Peru, featuring a procession with the Virgin and traditional dancers. Veneration of the Virgen del Carmen (often also associated with the Stella Maris) is particularly strong in coastal towns of Spain. Carmelite devotion The Carmelites consider the Blessed Virgin Mary to be a perfect model of the interior life of prayer and contemplation to which Carmelites aspire, as well as a model of virtue, in the person who was closest in life to Jesus Christ. She is seen as the one who points Christians most surely to Christ. As she says to the servants at the wedding at Cana, \\"Do whatever he [Jesus] tells you.\\" Carmelites look to the Virgin Mary as a Spiritual Mother. The Stella Maris Monastery (Star of the Sea) on Mount Carmel, named after a traditional title of the Blessed Virgin Mary, is considered the spiritual headquarters of the order. Fr. Gabriel of St. Mary Magdalene de' Pazzi, OCD, a revered authority on Carmelite spirituality, wrote that devotion to Our Lady of Mount Carmel means: Devotees the Blessed Mother of Mount Carmel might raise petitions to her through the prayer:  Church teaching  A 1996 doctrinal statement approved by the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments states that > Devotion to Our Lady of Mount Carmel is bound to the history and spiritual > values of the Order of the Brothers of the Blessed Virgin Mary of Mount > Carmel and is expressed through the scapular.

Baroque sculpture from Beniaj√°n (Spain). Since the Middle Ages, Our Lady of Mount Carmel has been related to purgatory and purgation from sins after death. In some images, she is portrayed as accompanied with angels and persons wearing Brown Scapulars, who plead for her mediation. In 1613, the Church forbade images to be made of Our Lady of Mt. Carmel descending into purgatory, due to errors being preached about certain privileges associated with the Brown Scapular (known as \\"the Sabbatine Privilege\\").1912 Catholic Encyclopedia. Sabbatine Privilege ‚Äì \\"The Bull [of the Holy Roman General Inquisition 20 January 1613, clarifying what is permissible for the Carmelites to preach regarding the Brown Scapular\\"] forbids the painting of pictures representing, in accordance with the wording of the Bull, the Mother of God descending into purgatory (cum descensione beatae Virginis ad animas in Purgatorio liberandas).\\" That privilege appears in the noted Decree of the Holy Office (1613). It was inserted in its entirety (except for the words forbidding the painting of the pictures) into the list of the indulgences and privileges of the Confraternity of the Scapular of Mount Carmel. In the 21st century, the Carmelites do not promote the Sabbatine Privilege. They encourage a belief in Mary's general aid and prayerful assistance for persons beyond death, especially her aid to those who devoutly wear the Brown Scapular, and commend devotion to Mary especially on Saturdays, which are dedicated to her. Our Lady of Mount Carmel, Palmi Apparitions There is today a small sanctuary at Acquafondata, Italy, where the Virgin of Mount Carmel reportedly appeared on July 16, 1841. The visionaries of Our Lady of F√°tima in 1917 reported Our Lady of Mount Carmel as among the titles claimed by Mary. She is said to have appeared to Saint Simon Stock to whom she gave the Brown Scapular. The Garabandal apparitions in Spain (1961‚Äì65) were reported to be images of the Blessed Virgin Mary of Mount Carmel. Acquafondata Our Lady of Mount Carmel Miracles In Palmi, Italy, the anniversary of the earthquake of 1894 is observed annually on 16 November.See the wikipedia article on Italian Festa della Beata Vergine del Carmelo (Palmi) The earthquake had its epicenter in the city. An associated event has been classified as the \\"miracle of Our Lady of Mount Carmel.\\" For 17 days preceding this earthquake, many of the faithful had reported strange eye movements and changes in the coloring of the face in a statue of Our Lady of Mount Carmel. The local and national press reported these occurrences. In the evening of 16 November, the faithful improvised a procession carrying the statue of the Virgin of Carmel on their shoulders through the streets. When the procession reached the end of the city, a violent earthquake shook the whole district of Palmi,Il terremoto del 16 novembre 1894 in calabria e sicilia, Roma, 1907. Tesot full archive available: Relazione scientifica sul terremoto ruining most of the old houses along the way. But, only nine people died out of a population of about 15,000 inhabitants, as almost all of the population had been on the street to watch the procession and were not trapped inside the destroyed buildings. Therefore, the city commemorates the 1894 procession each year, accompanied by firecrackers, lights, and festive stalls. The Catholic Church has officially recognized the miracle. On November 16, 1896, the statue of the Virgin was crowned, based on the decree issued September 22, 1895, by the Vatican Chapter. Use in the peace movement The first atomic bomb was exploded in the United States at the Trinity test site on July 16, 1945, near Alamogordo, New Mexico. The Catholic anti-war movement has built on the coincidence between this date and the Feast of Our Lady of Mount Carmel. In 1990 the Rev. Emmanuel Charles McCarthy, a priest of the Eastern Rite (Byzantine-Melkite) of the Catholic Church, initiated the \\"16 July Twenty-Four Hours Day of Prayer,\\" for Forgiveness and Protection with Our Lady of Mount Carmel, at Trinity Site in the New Mexico desert. Each year on 16 July, a prayer vigil is conducted at the Trinity site to pray for peace and the elimination of nuclear weapons. Gallery of statues Statues of Our Lady of Mount Carmel usually depict her with a Brown scapular.

Located in the Palatinate region of the federal state of Rhineland-Palatinate, the route was established in 1935. Geography German Wine Gate The German Wine Gate (Deutsches Weintor) in Schweigen-Rechtenbach on the French border adjacent to Wissembourg (Wei√üenburg) in France marks the start of the route. Built in 1936, the gate is an imposing ceremonial gatehouse made of sandstone. , the route traverses the Palatinate wine region (Pfalz, formerly Rheinpfalz) which lies in the lee of the Haardt Mountains, an area known as Anterior Palatinate (Vorderpfalz). The route runs northward, beside the path of Bundesstra√üen B 38 and B 271 for 85 km, passing through towns like Bad Bergzabern, Edenkoben, Neustadt an der Weinstra√üe, Deidesheim, Bad D√ºrkheim and Gr√ºnstadt. It ends at the House of the German Wine Route in Bockenheim an der Weinstra√üe. The route is marked by a yellow sign with a stylized bunch of ten grapes and the name of the route. The region around the route has come to be known as the Weinstra√üe (Wine Route) region, and the administrative district (Kreis) of S√ºdliche Weinstra√üe (literally, \\"Southern Wine Route\\") takes its name from the route. History Vineyards and blooming chestnut trees below Hambach Castle The German Wine Route was established in 1935. There was a record harvest in 1934, and another one was foreseen for 1935, so Gauleiter Josef B√ºrckel had the idea of establishing a road that connects all vintners' villages to boost the wine sales. The German Wine Route was officially opened on 19 October 1935. Existing local roads along the route were renamed to incorporate \\"Weinstra√üe\\" into their names and local municipalities were told to add \\"an der Weinstra√üe\\" to their names. After World War 2, Nazi symbols were removed from the heraldic eagle on the south side of the German Wine Gate. Below, a US-Graffito from March 1945 honours Mineral Wells, Texas. Climate Almond blossom near Gimmeldingen With a sunshine duration of over 1800 hours a year, the area around the German Wine Route is one of the warmest regions in Germany, allowing the cultivation of crops such as figs, lemons, and kiwifruit, which in Germany are only common here or in other parts of the upper Rhine valley, where the climate is similar. The German Wine Route is also famous for its almond blossoms, painting the whole region in pink and white colours around the beginning of March. The characteristic plant for this region is the vine, almost exclusively covering the landscape. Imported in Roman times, vines have ideal growing conditions: warm climate, minimum condensation due to the protective Palatinate Forest in the west, and attenuation of frost in the autumn due to the hillside location that benefits the outflow of cold air masses. Wine festivals Dubbeglas The German Wine Route is marked by numerous open-air wine festivals, held annually from March to October, that make it a major tourist attraction. The largest wine festival worldwide with more than 600,000 visitors each year is the Wurstmarkt in front of the world's largest wine barrel, the Giant Cask or Riesenfass, in Bad D√ºrkheim in September. Other important wine festivals are the German Wine Harvesting Festival (Deutsches Weinlesefest) in Neustadt an der Weinstra√üe where the German Wine Queen is selected in October, the festival in Freinsheim (Stadtmauerfest in July), and in Deidesheim (Deidesheimer Weinkerwe in August). The first wine fest on the wine route is the Mandelbl√ºtenfest (Almond Blossom Festival) in Gimmeldingen held in March depending on the start of the flowering. On the last Sunday in August, the route is closed to motorized traffic for German Wine Route Day (Erlebnistag Deutsche Weinstra√üe) with many wineries and Strau√üwirtschaften open air (seasonal wine bars) open to the hundreds of thousands of hikers, cyclers and inline skaters who visit this festival. Unlike with festivals in other German wine regions, wine is served in 50 cl glasses rather than the typical 25 cl ones. They are of a special shape specific to the Palatinate wine region and are known as the Dubbeglas, widening from bottom to top and featuring indentations or large dimples (Dubbe) that give the glass its name. The dimples are especially useful when socializing starts and one's dexterity is affected by the wine. The undimpled half-litre Schoppenglas is also frequently seen along the route.

She was named for Samuel Chester Reid. History Reid was laid down by the Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corporation, Squantum, Massachusetts, 9 September 1919; launched 15 October 1919; sponsored by Mrs. Joseph W. Powell; and commissioned 3 December 1919, Lieutenant Commander V. D. Chapline in command. Assigned to Squadron 3, Atlantic Fleet, Reid completed shakedown off Cuba in February 1920; participated in battle practice in March; and on 26 April put into New York. Underway again on 1 May, she steamed south again, touched at Key West, then cruised off the east coast of Mexico until mid-June. By 6 July she was at Newport, Rhode Island, whence she made several runs to New York prior to shifting to Charleston, South Carolina toward the end of September. For almost 3 years she remained on the east coast, operating out of Charleston, Newport, Rhode Island and Yorktown, Virginia. Such coastal operations were occasionally interrupted for brief periods of inactivity at Charleston, due to cuts in personnel. In late January 1923 Reid returned to Guantanamo Bay for winter maneuvers, and in February she continued on to the Panama Canal Zone for battle practice. By the end of March she was back off Cuba, from where she returned to Newport and exercises off the east coast. In the winter of 1924, she repeated her Caribbean operations; but, in the spring, headed east for duty in European waters. On 28 June she arrived at Cherbourg, France, and on 1 July joined the Light Cruiser Squadron. During that month she visited various Baltic and North Sea ports. In mid- August she conducted airplane patrols off Iceland, and in September she steamed into the Mediterranean. She remained in the western Mediterranean into November, and then proceeded, via Crete and Greece, to Turkey. During the next 2 months, she patrolled the eastern basin, calling at ports in the Levant and Egypt, and, in February 1925, resumed operations off France and Tunisia. Reid departed the Mediterranean in early May, and, after calls at French and British ports, crossed the Atlantic, arriving at New York 16 July. By the end of August she had resumed operations out of Newport and in September she again steamed south for exercises in the Caribbean. In December she underwent overhaul at Philadelphia, then returned to the Caribbean. Attached to the Scouting Fleet for the next 4 years, she continued to alternate east coast training cruises with Caribbean and Gulf of Mexico operations. From 24 April to 12 June 1927, she participated in the second Nicaraguan campaign - cruising off that coast, delivering supplies and mail to Marine detachments ashore, and assisting in the collecting of arms from allied forces. Fate In 1929 Reid was designated for inactivation. She completed her last cruise at Philadelphia 30 August 1929 and was decommissioned there 1 May 1930. Struck from the Navy list 22 October 1930, she was sold for scrapping to the Boston Iron & Metal Company, Baltimore, Maryland, 17 January 1931. See also See for other ships of this name.

It also has an Australian deal with Hoyts. History =Early history= Sony Pictures Home Entertainment was established in June 1978 as Columbia Pictures Home Entertainment, and released 20 titles in November 1979. In March 1981, Columbia Pictures established a joint venture with RCA, RCA/Columbia Pictures International Video, to distribute tapes in overseas markets. The partnership expanded to North America as RCA/Columbia Pictures Home Video the following year.Billboard (30 October 1982, p. 4). The venture distributed NBC titles, as it was a subsidiary of RCA at the time. When Tri-Star Pictures was formed in 1984, R/CPHV became one of the three primary distributors of Tri-Star product for home video (the other two being CBS/Fox Video and Thorn-EMI/HBO Video {later renamed to HBO/Cannon Video and then simply HBO Video}, as CBS and HBO originally held stakes in Tri-Star), and fully assumed distribution of TriStar titles in the early 1990s. They also distributed titles from various other film companies unrelated to Columbia, including most of New Line Cinema's theatrical releases (though not all, as Media Home Entertainment and Family Home Entertainment distributed several NLC films during the Columbia deal). New Line formed their own video label in 1990 (the result of acquiring Nelson Entertainment, which had previously been Embassy Home Entertainment, ironic considering EHE had been owned by Columbia for a brief period of time before being spun off), but continued to go through RCA/Columbia Pictures (as well as SVS-Triumph and then Columbia TriStar Home Video) for distribution until 1994, when Turner Broadcasting acquired NLC and Turner Home Entertainment assumed distribution functions. In March 1990, NBC filed a lawsuit against Columbia and its then-new parent company Sony under the perception that the latter two parties were violating their joint pact. Columbia purchased the foreign video rights to Orion Pictures titles a month earlier. NBC alleged that they were unaware of this transaction and had become convinced that Columbia was forming their own video unit in strict defiance of the joint venture, which was set to expire in 1992. Sony/Columbia denied NBC's claims. As the lawsuit continued into 1991, General Electric, the parent of NBC and RCA, announced that it was divesting its interest in RCA/Columbia. In August 1991, General Electric sold its 50% share of the company to Sony Corporation, and the litigation officially ended with Sony renaming the company as Columbia TriStar Home Video. It was named Columbia TriStar Home Entertainment from April 2001 until a name change to Sony Pictures Home Entertainment in November 2004.

Perdurantism is usually presented as the antipode to endurantism, the view that an individual is wholly present at every moment of its existence. The use of \\"endure\\" and \\"perdure\\" to distinguish two ways in which an object can be thought to persist can be traced to David Kellogg Lewis (1986). However, contemporary debate has demonstrated the difficulties in defining perdurantism (and also endurantism). For instance, the work of Ted Sider (2001) has suggested that even enduring objects can have temporal parts, and it is more accurate to define perdurantism as being the claim that objects have a temporal part at every instant that they exist. Currently there is no universally acknowledged definition of perdurantism. Others argue that this problem is avoided by creating time as a continuous function, rather than a discrete one. Perdurantism is also referred to as \\"four-dimensionalism\\" (by Ted Sider, in particular) but perdurantism also applies if one believes there are temporal but non-spatial abstract entities (like immaterial souls or universals of the sort accepted by David Malet Armstrong). Worm theorists and stage theorists Perdurantists break into two distinct sub-groups: worm theorists and stage theorists. Worm theorists believe that a persisting object is composed of the various temporal parts that it has. It can be said that objects that persist are extended through the time dimension of the block universe much as physical objects are extended in space. Thus, they believe that all persisting objects are four-dimensional \\"worms\\" that stretch across space-time, and that you are mistaken in believing that chairs, mountains, and people are simply three-dimensional. Stage theorists take discussion of persisting objects to be talk of a particular temporal part, or stage, of an object at any given time. So, in a manner of speaking, a subject only exists for an instantaneous period of time. However, there are other temporal parts at other times which that subject is related to in a certain way (Sider talks of \\"modal counterpart relations\\", whilst Hawley talks of \\"non-Humean relations\\") such that when someone says that they were a child, or that they will be an elderly person, these things are true, because they bear a special \\"identity-like\\" relation to a temporal part that is a child (that exists in the past) or a temporal part that is an elderly person (that exists in the future). Stage theorists are sometimes called \\"exdurantists\\". It has been argued that stage theory, unlike the worm theory, should be favored as it accurately accounts for the contents of our experience. The latter requires that we currently experience more than a single moment of our lives while we actually find ourselves experiencing only one instant of time, in line with the stage view.Balashov, Y. (2015). Experiencing the Present. Epistemology & Philosophy of Science, 44(2), 61-73.Skow, B. (2011). Experience and the Passage of Time. Philosophical Perspectives, 25(1), 359-387.Parsons, J. (2015). A phenomenological argument for stage theory. Analysis, 75(2), 237-242 However, on the other hand, as Stuchlik (2003) states, the stage theory will not work under the possibility of gunky time, which states that for every interval of time, there is a sub-interval, and according to Zimmerman (1996), there have been many self-professed perdurantists who believe that time is gunky or contains no instants. Some perdurantists think the idea of gunk means there are no instants, since they define these as intervals of time with no subintervals.

According to tradition, the novenas to Our Lady of Perpetual Help began in January 1949 and were heavily publicised and instantaneously became widespread in 1951 as intended by Pope Pius XI. Balestier Road was named after Joseph Balestier, an American diplomat who served in Singapore in the 1800s.

Assigned to the Atlantic Fleet, Charles Ausburn operated from Charleston, South Carolina, Norfolk, Virginia and Newport, Rhode Island along the Atlantic coast and in the Caribbean through 1924, serving with a reduced complement from October 1920 to May 1922. During those years, as she participated in fleet exercises and training maneuvers, she aided in the development and application of new ideas in naval warfare. In the fall of 1923, Charles Ausburn was equipped to carry a seaplane, with which she performed experiments in the rapidly developing field of naval aviation. In late summer of 1924, Charles Ausburn cruised to northern latitudes to provide plane guard service in the round-the-world flight of Army aircraft, maintaining stations off Greenland and Newfoundland. On 18 June 1925, she sailed from Boston for a year of duty off Europe and in the Mediterranean, visiting at a large number of ports before her return to New York 11 July 1926. She continued her operations with the fleet, often providing facilities for the training of reservists, until 1 May 1930, when she was decommissioned at Philadelphia.

Written in the midst of the formulary controversy between the Jansenists and the Jesuits, they are a defense of the Jansenist Antoine Arnauld from Port-Royal-des-Champs, a friend of Pascal who in 1656 was condemned by the Facult√© de Th√©ologie at the Sorbonne in Paris for views that were claimed to be heretical. The first letter is dated January 23, 1656 and the Eighteenth March 24, 1657. A fragmentary nineteenth letter is frequently included with the other eighteen. In these letters, Pascal humorously attacked casuistry, a rhetorical method often used by Jesuit theologians, and accused Jesuits of moral laxity. Being quickly forced underground while writing the Provincial Letters, Pascal pretended they were reports from a Parisian to a friend in the provinces, on the moral and theological issues then exciting the intellectual and religious circles in the capital. In the letters, Pascal's tone combines the fervor of a convert with the wit and polish of a man of the world. Their style meant that, quite apart from their religious influence, the Provincial Letters were popular as a literary work. Adding to that popularity was Pascal's use of humor, mockery, and satire in his arguments. The letters also influenced the prose of later French writers like Voltaire and Jean- Jacques Rousseau. Brilliantly written by Pascal, the Provincial Letters would not have been possible without the work of theologians from Port-Royal; indeed, most of the arguments Pascal deployed were already to be found in Arnauld's Th√©ologie morale des J√©suites,Vincent Carraud (author of Pascal et la philosophie, PUF, 1992), Le jans√©nisme, Soci√©t√© des Amis de Port-Royal, on- line since June 2007 something which led the Jesuit Nicolas Caussin to reply to Pascal's perceived libel. Pascal's main source on Jesuit casuistry was Antonio Escobar's Summula casuum conscientiae (1627), several propositions of which would be later condemned by Pope Innocent XI. Paradoxically, the Provincial Letters were both a success and a defeat: a defeat, on the political and theological level, and a success on the moral level. The final letter from Pascal, in 1657, had defied the Pope himself, provoking Alexander VII to condemn the letters. But that didn't stop most of educated France from reading them. Moreover, even Pope Alexander, while publicly opposing them, nonetheless was persuaded by Pascal's arguments. Just a few years later (1665‚Äì66, and then 1679), Alexander condemned \\"laxity\\" in the church and ordered a revision of casuistic texts.  Content of the letters  Structurally, the first three letters ridicule the dispute between the Thomists and the Jesuits on the nature of salvation, rather asserting a Jansenist understanding of salvation. Making allusion to the Congregatio de Auxiliis, the debate concerned the respective role of grace and free will, Molinists (i.e. Jesuits) claiming that an \\"efficacious grace\\" was not necessary to save man, but only a \\"sufficient grace\\" bestowed by God to all men, while Thomists claimed that the \\"sufficient grace\\", given to all men, had to be assisted by an \\"efficacious grace\\", bestowed only to the select few (in accordance also with Augustinism). Pascal thus highlighted, in the Second Letter, that neo-Thomists and Jesuits were using the same term, \\"sufficient grace\\", with two different senses, for political reasons. = Fourth Letter = The Fourth Letter deals with the question of \\"actual grace\\", the Jesuits claiming that sin could only be committed if people had knowledge of the evil inherent to the planned action. The Jesuit priest with whom Pascal was speaking quoted Le Moyne, a professor to the Sorbonne from 1642 to 1654. Le Moyne's definition had already been used by Arnauld in the Apologie pour les saints P√®res:See note p.314 of Ferreyrolles and Sellier's edition, Pochot√®que, Classiques Garnier, 1999‚Äì2004 > 1\\\\.

God inspires a desire to pray and solicit his assistance. ‚ÄúAnd unless all these things occur and pass through the soul,‚Äù added the Jesuit, ‚Äúthe action is not properly a sin, and cannot be imputed, as M. le Moine shows in the same place and in what follows.\\" Pascal replied, that this meant that all those whose \\"vices have got the better of their reason\\" and who indulge in \\"a perpetual round of all sorts of pleasures\\", so long as they are ignorant of the immorality of their actions, were excused by this doctrine. While he argued, citing the Bible,Pascal alluded to the Parable of the Faithful Servant in the Gospel of Luke, XII, 47‚Äì48, to Ecclesiastes, IX, 1, and to the First Epistle to the Corinthians, IV, 4 : Nihil enim mihi conscius sum, sed non in hoc justificatus sum that those who did believe in God but were deprived of knowledge of their evil actions (and thus deprived, for a moment, of the Jesuits' \\"actual grace\\") were still sinners. Furthermore, Pascal ridiculed the attempt of Etienne Bauny, author of a Somme des p√©ch√©s qui se commettent en tous √©tats (Paris, 1634),See note p.312 of Ferreyrolles and Sellier's edition, Pochot√®que, Classiques Garnier, 1999‚Äì2004 to use Aristotle to justify this doctrine of sin (which could, according to Bauny, only be effective if man possessed the knowledge of the action). Bauny thus quoted the Nicomachean Ethics, III, 1, alleging that a voluntary action needed knowledge of what was good or evil in it. Pascal replied, also quoting Aristotle (he seemingly was the only one to use this argument in this debate),See note p.324 of Ferreyrolles and Sellier's edition that Aristotle spoke only of knowledge of the actual circumstances of the act, but not at all of the capacity to discriminate between good and evil ‚Äì since Aristotle stated that one who was devoid of that capacity was not excused at all, but rather considered a vicious man. = Casuistry = The rest of the letters are mainly an attack on Jesuit casuistry. The Fifth Letter, published in a hurry after a police search in Jansenist-friendly publishing houses, is particularly dedicated to criticisms against the Jesuits' doctrine of moral probabilism, according to which one could adopt a \\"probable opinion\\", that is, an opinion made plausible by the authority of a theologian, even if it was less probable than another opinion ‚Äì especially concerning what conduct ought to be followed, the nature of sins, etc.J. Franklin, The Science of Conjecture: Evidence and Probability Before Pascal (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2001), pp. 94‚Äì101. Pascal relied heavily on witty attack, composed of quotes from various books written by Jesuit casuists, in particular by Antonio Escobar y Mendoza's Summula casuum conscientiae (1627), which had enjoyed a great success,See note p.335 of Ferreyrolles and Sellier's edition, Pochot√®que, Classiques Garnier, 1999‚Äì2004. See also Karl Weiss, P. Antonio de Escobar y Mendoza als Moraltheologe in Pascals Beleuchtung und im Lichte der Wahrheit, who adopted a pro-Escobar point of view, to which replied Augustin Gazier, Blaise Pascal et Antoine Escobar, √©tude historique et critique.., Paris, H. et E. Champion, 1912, 76 p. and also Thomas Sanchez, Vincenzo Filliucci (Jesuit and penitentiary at St Peter's), Antonino Diana, Paul Laymann, Etienne Bauny, Louis Cellot, Valerius Reginaldus, Bernard Lamy (censored on 8 October 1649 by the Faculty of Leuven for his defense of homicide), etc. In the Fifth Letter, he evoked in passing the Chinese Rites controversy which ended with the Jesuits' condemnation and the Congregatio de Propaganda Fide's decision to prohibit idolatry under any pretexts.9 July 1645 decree signed by Cardinal Luigi Capponi. This is allegedly the first reference in French theological debate of Chinese rites. See Classiques Garnier edition by G√©rard Ferreyroles and Philippe Sellier, 1999 He also alluded to the problem of the relations between Christian virtues and natural virtues, debated in particular during the first half of the 17th century, after Jean- Pierre Camus and Arnauld, Pascal attacked the Jesuit Antoine Sirmond, who had practically admitted the identity between natural virtues and Christian virtues.Note p.334 of Ferreyrolles and Sellier's edition Starting at Letter VI, dated 10 April 1656, Pascal gives a number of examples of Jesuit casuistry and of its \\"relaxed morality\\", citing abundant sources (many of which came from Escobar). He illustrated casuistry by citing mostly Jesuitical texts allowing excuses to abstain from fasting (citing Vincenzo Filliucci's Moralium quaestionum de christianis officiis et casibus conscientiae... tomus, Lyon, 1622; often cited by Escobar); from giving to the poor (indirectly citing Gabriel Vasquez from Diana; for a monk temporarily defrocking himself to go to the brothel (citing an exact quote of Sanchez from Escobar, who was evading Pius IV's Contra sollicitantes and Pius V's Contra clericos papal bulls, the latter directed against sodomite clergypp. 350‚Äì351 of Ferreyrolles and Sellier's edition)); in the Seventh Letter, propositions allowing homicides (even to the clergy) and duels as long as the intention is not directed for revenge; others permitting corruption of judges as long as it is not intended as corruption; others allowing usury or Mohatra contracts; casuistic propositions allowing robbery and stealing from one's master; others allowing lying through the use of rhetorical \\"mental reservation\\" (restrictio mentalis; for instance: saying, loudly \\"I swear that...\\", silently \\"I said that...\\", and loudly again the object of the pledge) and equivocations. A number of these scandalous propositions were later condemned by Pope Innocent XI. In the Ninth Letter, the Jesuit explains to the narrator easy ways to enter Heaven, citing a book called ‚ÄúParadise opened to Philagio, in a Hundred Devotions to the Mother of God, easily practiced.‚Äù The Tenth Letter is dedicated to casuistic procedures to lighten the ritual of confession and to the debate between the respective roles of attrition and contrition; the Jesuit character claiming that simply attrition combined with the sacrament of penance is sufficient for man's salvation, while the narrator insists on the necessity of contrition and of the love of God, citing extracts of the Bible often quoted by the Jansenists, the abb√© de Saint-Cyran and Jansenius.Gospel of Matthew, 22:36 and 40, John 3:16, First Epistle to the Corinthians 16:22, First Epistle of John 3:14, John 14:24 The Thirteenth and Fourteenth Letters criticize the Jesuits' legitimation of homicide. In the latter, Pascal abstains himself from discussing the most scandalous Jesuit propositions, legitimizing tyrannicides and abortions. He quotes, among others, the Church's policies of penance for sinners guilty of willful murder officialized during the Synod of Ancyra (341). In the Seventeenth Letter, Pascal took up again the problem of efficacious grace and of the \\"de facto vs de juris\\" debate concerning the inclusion, or not, of the 5 Propositions condemned by the Pope in the Cum Occasione papal bull, in Jansenius's work (see Formulary controversy for details). Port-Royal and Pascal argued that although the Pope had condemned these 5 Propositions as heretical, they were not to be found in Jansenius. Furthermore, they claimed that the Pope held authority only on matters of faith, and not on technical de facto matters. Thus, drawing on the Jesuits' argumentation itself, Pascal argued here that one could not be held heretical to believe that Jansenius' work did not include these 5 Propositions, and that the Papal condemnation only restricted itself to the heresy itself, not to the question of their inclusion in Jansenius' work. Thus, he recalled the Jesuit Cardinal Bellarmine's sentences concerning the authority of religious councils concerning matters of dogma versus de facto issues; he also recalled the debate between St Athanasius and St Basil concerning the interpretation of Dionysus of Alexandria, who was accused by Basil of Arianism and therefore convoked before the Pope Dionysius in 262; or the various contradictory papal interpretations given to the Scythian monks; as well as another debate concerning Pope Honorius I, who had been later anathematized by the Third Council of Constantinople, although Cardinal Bellarmine defended Honorius' orthodoxy, claiming that the condemned propositions were not to be found in Honorius.  Reactions and legacy  The reaction to the Lettres provinciales was substantial. Pascal's use of wit, humor, and mockery in attacking existing institutions made his work extremely popular. However, its publication was primarily via the underground press, and in 1660 Louis XIV banned the book and ordered it shredded and burned. Pascal himself had to enter clandestinity, living in cheap hostels. Nevertheless, the letters survived and influenced the prose of later French writers like Voltaire and Jean-Jacques Rousseau. The extract of the Seventh Letter concerning the \\"direction of intention\\" influenced Moli√®re's Tartuffe (Act IV, scene V, 1489‚Äì1493). They were first translated into Latin by Antoine Arnauld, and then into many other languages, including English in 1657 (Les Provinciales, or the Mystery of Jesuitisme, discovered in certain letters written upon occasion of the present differences at Sorbonne between the jansenists and the molinists, London, Royston, 1657) by the Anglican theologian Henry Hammond, while in 1684 a polyglot translation (in French, Latin, Spanish and Italian) was published by Balthasar Winfelt.On these translations, see Louis Cognet, 1965, notice re-published in Ph. Sellier's edition of Pascal (Classiques Garnier)  Quotes  =On probabilism= *‚ÄúOh, yes,‚Äù said he, ‚Äúwe answer just as we please; or rather, I should say, just as it may please those who ask our advice. Here are our rules, taken from Fathers Layman, Vasquez, Sanchez, and the four-and-twenty worthies, in the words of Layman: ‚ÄòA doctor, on being consulted, may give an advice, not only probable according to his own opinion, but contrary to his own opinion, provided this judgement happens to be more favourable or more agreeable to the person that consults him ‚Äì si forte haec favorabilior seu exoptatior sit. Nay, I go further and say that there would be nothing unreasonable in his giving those who consult him a judgement held to be probable by some learned person, even though he should be satisfied in his own mind that it is absolutely false.‚Äô‚Äù (Letter V) *‚ÄúIn other words,‚Äù said I, ‚Äúthey have got maxims for the clergy, the nobility, and the commons. Well, I am quite impatient to hear them.‚Äù (Letter VI) *‚ÄúYou have a very short memory, returned the monk. ‚ÄúDid I not inform you a little ago that, according to our fathers Cellot and Reginald, ‚Äòin matters of morality we are to follow, not the ancient fathers, but the modern casuists?‚Äô‚Äù (Letter VI) =On Antonino Diana's justification of duels= *\\"If a gentleman,\\" says he, in a passage cited by Diana, \\"who is challenged to fight a duel, is well known to have no religion, and if the vices to which he is openly and unscrupulously addicted are such as would lead people to conclude, in the event of his refusing to fight, that he is actuated, not by the fear of God, but by cowardice, and induce them to say of him that he was a hen, and not a man, gallina, et non vir; in that case he may, to save his honour, appear at the appointed spot ‚Äì not, indeed, with the express intention of fighting a duel, but merely with that of defending himself, should the person who challenged him come there unjustly to attack him. His action in this case, viewed by itself, will be perfectly indifferent; for what moral evil is there in one stepping into a field, taking a stroll in expectation of meeting a person, and defending one‚Äôs self in the event of being attacked? And thus the gentleman is guilty of no sin whatever; for in fact it cannot be called accepting a challenge at all, his intention being directed to other circumstances, and the acceptance of a challenge consisting in an express intention to fight, which we are supposing the gentleman never had.‚Äù *‚ÄúYou have not kept your word with me, sir,‚Äù said I. ‚ÄúThis is not, properly speaking, to permit duelling; on the contrary, the casuist is so persuaded that this practice is forbidden that, in licensing the action in question, he carefully avoids calling it a duel.‚Äù (Letter VII) *‚ÄúA most pious assassination!‚Äù said I. ‚ÄúStill, however, pious though it be, it is assassination, if a man is permitted to kill his enemy in a treacherous manner.‚Äù (Letter VII) =On usury and witchcraft= *\\"Usury, according to our fathers, consists in little more than the intention of taking the interest as usurious. Escobar, accordingly, shows you how you may avoid usury by a simple shift of the intention.\\" (Letter VIII) *‚ÄúDistinguo, as Sanchez says, here. If the magician be ignorant of the diabolic art ‚Äì si sit artis diabolicae ignarus ‚Äì he is bound to restore: but if he is an expert sorcerer, and has done all in his power to arrive at the truth, the obligation ceases; for the industry of such a magician may be estimated at a certain sum of money.‚Äù *‚ÄúThere is some sense in that,‚Äù I said; ‚Äúfor this is an excellent plan to induce sorcerers to aim at proficiency in their art, in the hope of making an honest livelihood, as you would say, by faithfully serving the public.‚Äù (Letter VIII) =Other= * \\"I would have written a shorter letter, but I did not have the time.\\" (Letter XVI) = Quotes about the Provincial Letters = *Said Voltaire concerning the greatness of the letters, \\"All types of eloquence are contained in these letters.\\" He also called them \\"the best-written book that has yet appeared in France.\\"Voltaire, Age of Louis XIV 424, 358. *When Bossuet was asked what book he would rather have written had he not written his own, he answered, the Provincial Letters of Pascal.Voltaire, Age of Louis XIV 359.

As it is not always practical to study insects, crustaceans or arachnids directly and because exuviae can be collected fairly easily, they can play an important part in helping to determine some general aspects of a species' overall life cycle such as distribution, sex ratio, production and proof of breeding in a habitat.

He is currently a professor of biology, and professor of neurology and neurological sciences and, by courtesy, neurosurgery, at Stanford University. In addition, he is a research associate at the National Museums of Kenya. His online lectures have found massive popularity during the past decade.  Early life and education  Sapolsky was born in Brooklyn, New York, to immigrants from the Soviet Union. His father, Thomas Sapolsky, was an architect who renovated the restaurants L√ºchow's and Lundy's.At home with: Dr. Robert M. Sapolsky; Family Man With a Foot In the Veld, By PATRICIA LEIGH BROWN, New York Times, APRIL 19, 2001 Robert was raised an Orthodox Jew and spent his time reading about and imagining living with silverback gorillas. By age 12, he was writing fan letters to primatologists. He attended John Dewey High School and, by that time, he was reading textbooks on the subject and teaching himself Swahili. Sapolsky describes himself as an atheist. He stated in his acceptance speech for the Emperor Has No Clothes Award, \\"I was raised in an Orthodox [Jewish] household, and I was raised devoutly religious up until around age 13 or so. In my adolescent years, one of the defining actions in my life was breaking away from all religious belief whatsoever.\\" In 1978, Sapolsky received his B.A. in biological anthropology summa cum laude from Harvard University. He then went to Kenya to study the social behaviors of baboons in the wild. When the Uganda‚ÄìTanzania War broke out in the neighboring countries, Sapolsky decided to travel into Uganda to witness the war up close, later commenting that \\"I was twenty-one and wanted adventure. [...] I was behaving like a late- adolescent male primate.\\" He went to Uganda's capital Kampala, and from there to the border with Zaire (now the Democratic Republic of the Congo), and then back to Kampala, witnessing some fighting, including the Ugandan capital's conquest by the Tanzanian army and its Ugandan rebel allies on 10‚Äì11 April 1979. Sapolsky then returned to New York and studied at Rockefeller University, where he received his Ph.D. in neuroendocrinology working in the lab of endocrinologist Bruce McEwen. After the initial year-and-a-half field study in Africa, he would return every summer for another twenty-five years to observe the same group of baboons, from the late 70s to the early 90s. He spent 8 to 10 hours a day for approximately four months each year recording the behaviors of these primates.  Career  Sapolsky is currently the John A. and Cynthia Fry Gunn Professor at Stanford University, holding joint appointments in several departments, including Biological Sciences, Neurology & Neurological Sciences, and Neurosurgery. As a neuroendocrinologist, he has focused his research on issues of stress and neuronal degeneration, as well as on the possibilities of gene therapy strategies for protecting susceptible neurons from disease. Currently, he is working on gene transfer techniques to strengthen neurons against the disabling effects of glucocorticoids. Each year, Sapolsky spends time in Kenya studying a population of wild baboons in order to identify the sources of stress in their environment, and the relationship between personality and patterns of stress-related disease in these animals. More specifically, Sapolsky studies the cortisol levels between the alpha male and female and the subordinates to determine stress level. An early but still relevant example of his studies of olive baboons is to be found in his 1990 Scientific American article, \\"Stress in the Wild\\". He has also written about neurological impairment and the insanity defense within the American legal system.\\"The Brain on the Stand,\\" New York Times Magazine Sapolsky's work has been featured widely in the press, most notably in the National Geographic documentary Stress: Portrait of a Killer, articles in The New York Times, Wired magazine, the Stanford magazine, and The Tehran Times. His speaking style (e.g., on Radiolab, The Joe Rogan Experience, and his Stanford human behavioural biology lectures) has garnered attention. Sapolsky's specialization in primatology and neuroscience has made him prominent in the public discussion of mental health‚Äîand, more broadly, human relationships‚Äîfrom an evolutionary context. Sapolsky has received numerous honors and awards for his work, including the prestigious MacArthur Fellowship Genius Grant in 1987, an Alfred P. Sloan Fellowship, and the Klingenstein Fellowship in Neuroscience. He was also awarded the National Science Foundation Presidential Young Investigator Award, the Young Investigator of the Year Awards from the Society for Neuroscience, the International Society for Psychoneuroendocrinology, and the Biological Psychiatry Society. In 2007 he received the John P. McGovern Award for Behavioral Science, awarded by the American Association for the Advancement of Science. In 2008 he received Wonderfest's Carl Sagan Prize for Science Popularization. In February 2010 Sapolsky was named to the Freedom From Religion Foundation's Honorary Board of distinguished achievers, following the earlier Emperor Has No Clothes Award for year 2002.  Personal life  Sapolsky is married to Lisa Sapolsky, a doctor in neuropsychology. They have two children, Benjamin and Rachel.

Career  McKinley got his start at age 9 working with local bands in the Dallas‚ÄìFort Worth area. He left home when he was 15 and played with Milt Shaw's Detroiters and the Smith Ballew and Duncan-Marin bands. His first substantial professional engagement came in 1934 with the Dorsey Brothers' Orchestra. It was with the Smith Ballew band in 1929 that McKinley met Glenn Miller. The two formed a friendship that lasted from 1929 until Miller's death in 1944. McKinley and Miller joined the Dorsey Brothers in 1934. Miller left for Ray Noble in December 1934, while McKinley remained. The Dorsey brothers split in 1935, with McKinley remaining with Jimmy Dorsey until 1939, when he joined Will Bradley, becoming co-leader. McKinley's biggest hit with Bradley, as a singer, was \\"Beat Me Daddy, Eight to the Bar\\", which he recorded early in the year 1940 (and for which he got partial songwriting credit under his wife's maiden name Eleanore Sheehy). McKinley is referred to as \\"Eight Beat Mack\\" in the lyrics to the song \\"Down the Road a Piece,\\" which he recorded as a trio with Will Bradley and Freddie Slack in 1940. This was the earliest recording of the song, which was written specifically for Bradley's band by Don Raye. McKinley and Bradley split in 1942\\"Ray wanted emphasis on their boogie-woogie novelties and jazz, Will more on the ballads.\\" See George T. Simon, Simon Says: The Sights and Sounds of the Big Band Era, Galahad Books, 1971, p. 148. and McKinley formed his own band, which recorded for Capitol Records. The McKinley band was short-lived. When McKinley broke up the band, he joined Glenn Miller's Army Air Force Band, which he co-led with arranger Jerry Gray after Miller's disappearance in December 1944. Upon being discharged at the end of the following year, McKinley formed a modern big band that featured a book of original material by legendary arranger Eddie Sauter (along with a helping of novelty vocals by the leader). Sam Butera, later of the back-up band for Louis Prima was also a member.\\"Drummerworld: Ray McKinley\\" But with the business in decline, by 1950 that band was history and McKinley began evolving into a part-time leader and sometime radio and TV personality. In 1956, capitalizing on the popularity of The Glenn Miller Story movie with James Stewart, McKinley was chosen to be the leader of the revived Glenn Miller Orchestra that still exists as of 2019, which he led until 1966. He co-hosted, with former Air Force band vocalist Johnny Desmond, a 13-week CBS-TV summer replacement series with the band called Glenn Miller Time in 1961. Ray McKinley's last recording session was in 1977 for Chiaroscuro Records.\\"Swing Music Net Biography Ray McKinley\\" Compositions Ray McKinley wrote the lyrics to the 1945 wartime song \\"My Guy's Come Back\\" with music by Mel Powell. The song was recorded by Benny Goodman with vocals by Liza Morrow and was released as a Columbia Records 78 single in 1945 as a V-Disc in February, 1946 as No. 585A.

Despite the deaths of her sister, Princess Margaret, and mother, Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother, in February and March 2002 respectively, and predictions in the media that the anniversary would be a non-event, the jubilee was marked with large-scale and popular events throughout London in June of the same year, bookended by events throughout the Commonwealth realms. Elizabeth attended all of the official celebrations as scheduled, along with her husband, the Duke of Edinburgh; over twelve months, the royal couple journeyed more than to the Caribbean, Australia, New Zealand, then around the United Kingdom, and wrapped up the jubilee year in Canada. Numerous landmarks, parks, buildings, and the like, were also named in honour of the golden jubilee and commemorative medals, stamps, and other symbols were issued. Celebrations in the Commonwealth realms =Australia= Australian celebrations were markedly on a smaller scale than the 1977 Silver Jubilee event. Unlike in 1977 when Silver Jubilee Medals were issued in Australia, no medal was issued for the Golden Jubilee, this contrasted with the United Kingdom and Canada, both issuing medals on a wide basis. Queen Elizabeth was on 27 February received in Adelaide by the Governor-General, Peter Hollingworth; the Australian viceroy, at the time, was in the midst of controversy involving allegations of child abuse cover-ups in the Anglican Church and demonstrators were present when the Queen and Prince Philip landed. The royal couple undertook a five-day tour through South Australia and Queensland, which also coincided with that year's Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Coolum Beach. On the Queen's Birthday holiday for 2002, services of thanksgiving were held in churches and a bonfire was lit during a party at the Governor-General's residence in Canberra. =Canada= Queen Elizabeth II's official Golden Jubilee portrait for Canada Throughout the year, events were held across Canada to mark the jubilee, such as the Jubilee Lev√©e held by Lieutenant Governor of Alberta Lois Hole, which was attended by more than 4,000 Albertans and at which Hole stated: \\"what we want to realize is how important the monarchy is to Canada and certainly to Alberta.\\" For 12 days in October 2002, the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh toured Canada, making stops in Victoria, Vancouver, Winnipeg, Toronto, Hamilton, Hull, Fredericton, Sussex, Moncton, and Ottawa. The trip was also unique in that it was the first royal visit to the new territory of Nunavut, where the royal couple made their first Canadian stop in Iqaluit. There, on 4 October, the Queen opened and addressed the new legislative assembly, stating in her speech: \\"I am proud to be the first member of the Canadian Royal Family to be greeted in Canada's newest territory.\\" After a walk-about through Iqaluit, the Queen unveiled one of the street signs on the town's main thoroughfare, which had been renamed in her honour. From Nunavut, the royal party flew to Victoria, where the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh were received by the province's lieutenant governor. Saturday was spent at a private retreat and, on the Sunday, the Queen attended religious services at Christ Church Cathedral, performed an unscheduled walk-about after the sermon, and travelled to the provincial parliament building to unveil a stained glass window commemorating the Golden Jubilee. Once Her Majesty was outside of the legislature, the Snowbirds performed an acrobatic fly-by for the sovereign and a gathered audience of some 16,000. In Vancouver, on 6 October, the Queen, accompanied by Wayne Gretzky, and in front of a crowd of 18,000 at General Motors Place, dropped the ceremonial first puck for the National Hockey League exhibition game between the Vancouver Canucks and San Jose Sharks; this was the first time any reigning monarch, Canadian or otherwise, had performed the task. The Queen and the Duke then watched the first period of the game from the royal box‚Äîthe first time they had done so since their first hockey game at Maple Leaf Gardens in 1951. Premier Gordon Campbell said during the visit: \\"Your Majesty, much as the world has changed in the last 50 years, one thing has always remained constant‚Äîthe sincere affection between the people of British Columbia and their Queen.\\" The couple was next in Saskatchewan, unveiling on the grounds of the provincial parliament the product of the Golden Jubilee Statue Project: a bronze equestrian statue of the Queen riding Burmese, a horse gifted in 1969 to the Queen by the RCMP. In Winnipeg, Manitoba, the Queen performed a walk-about at The Forks, re-dedicated the newly restored Golden Boy statue atop the Manitoba Legislative Building, and attended an evening performance of the Royal Winnipeg Ballet, accompanied by the Winnipeg Symphony Orchestra and Loreena McKennitt. Her Majesty and His Royal Highness were on 9 October welcomed to Ontario by the lieutenant governor and thousands onlookers in Toronto, and, that evening, appeared at a festival, mounted at Exhibition Place, highlighting the advance of the province over the previous five decades. After a day of relaxation, the Queen then ventured to Sheridan College, to view students learning computer animation, and Hamilton, where at Copps Coliseum she, as their colonel-in- chief, presented the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders of Canada with their new Colours. Rejoined by her husband, Elizabeth attended at the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation's Toronto headquarters an event marking the organisation's 50th anniversary; there, she viewed exhibits and was amused by a video display showing her earlier tours of Canada in the 1950s. Finally, the royal couple were in the audience at Roy Thomson Hall for a gala concert of Canadian talent, including Oscar Peterson, Evelyn Hart, Rex Harrington, Cirque du Soleil, The Tragically Hip, and others. At the same time, the Lieutenant- Governor-in-Council named a park near Gravenhurst as the Queen Elizabeth II Wildlands Provincial Park and created the Ontario Golden Jubilee Award for Civilian Bravery. The Queen's official logo for her Golden Jubilee as queen of Canada As the tour continued on to the maritime provinces, the royal party arrived at Government House in Fredericton, New Brunswick, where they were welcomed by thousands. The stop in this province was brief, however‚Äîonly 25 hours in total‚Äîwith the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh flying by helicopter the following morning from Fredericton to Sussex and then on to Moncton, where they attended a luncheon in Dieppe to celebrate the town's 50th anniversary and officially opened a new terminal at Greater Moncton International Airport. From the east coast the royal couple flew westwards again to the national capital, Ottawa, to be greeted there by Deputy Prime Minister John Manley, who had earlier, on the day of the Queen's arrival in Canada, caused controversy by stating Canada should become a republic. The day following, 13 October, a multi-faith Thanksgiving celebration was held on Parliament Hill for about 3,500 people, and the Queen laid a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. A state dinner was held that evening at the Canadian Museum of Civilization in Gatineau, Quebec, at which Her Majesty said: \\"[I wish] to express my profound gratitude to all Canadians... for the loyalty, encouragement and support you have given to me over these past 50 years.\\" As her motorcade passed across the Ottawa River into Quebec, about 100 protesters yelled obscenities at the Queen in French, waving Quebec flags and chanting \\"We want a country, not a monarchy\\"; it was the only protest during the jubilee tour of Canada. On the last full day of the tour, the Queen, as Honorary Commissioner, watched a performance of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police's Musical Ride before moving to her final major event in Canada: a lunch at Rideau Hall for fifty distinguished Canadians‚Äîone from each year of Elizabeth's reign. The Queen also planted another tree on the grounds of her Canadian residence, and met with members of the Royal Commonwealth Society. The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh then departed Canada on 15 October. =Jamaica= A trinket pot, sold as memorabilia merchandise for the Golden Jubilee Elizabeth's first official engagements related to the Golden Jubilee took place in Jamaica. She had acceded in 1952 as queen of the United Kingdom and became distinctly queen of Jamaica 10 years later; her tour of the island therefore coincided with the country's 40th anniversary of independence. She arrived for the celebrations on 18 February 2002, nine days following the death of her sister, Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon; the Queen established a short period of private, though not state, mourning. Elizabeth was first welcomed in Montego Bay, after which she travelled to Kingston and stayed at her Jamaican prime minister's residence, Jamaica House. Despite some anti-monarchical sentiment in the country at the time, the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh were \\"enthusiastically welcomed\\" by Jamaicans; 57% of those polled said the visit was important to the country and large crowds turned out to see Elizabeth, though there were small protests by Rastafarians seeking reparations for slavery and their repatriation to Africa. The Queen received an official welcome at King's House, the Governor-General's residence, met with Jamaican veterans of the First World War, addressed her Jamaican parliament, and visited an underprivileged area of Kingston, known as Trenchtown, viewing urban poverty projects while there. The tour ended on a unique note when, at the final banquet in Jamaica, a power outage plunged King's House into darkness during the meal; Elizabeth described the event as \\"memorable\\". =New Zealand= Following her tour of Jamaica, the Queen next toured New Zealand, making stops in Auckland, Taupo, Christchurch, and Wellington. She and the Duke of Edinburgh arrived in the country on 22 February, just after Prime Minister Helen Clark said in a speech that she felt it \\"inevitable that New Zealand will become a republic.\\" The royal couple were greeted by the Governor-General and other officials when they disembarked from the Royal Flight; Clark was absent, as she was at a meeting of centre-left leaders in Stockholm, Sweden. A low turn out was reported to see the Queen when she arrived at the airport, while an estimated 4,000 people came to view the Queen in Auckland. =United Kingdom= Celebrations for Elizabeth II's Golden Jubilee took place throughout the United Kingdom between May and July 2002. In the lead-up to those festive weeks, the British media‚ÄîThe Guardian, in particular‚Äîpredicted that the jubilee would be a failure, arguing that Britain was no longer interested in the monarchy; a pervading sense of apathy amongst the populace seemed to confirm this. However, the predictions were proven wrong, especially during the official jubilee weekend, when people numbering in the hundreds of thousands turned out to participate in the f√™tes. These festivities culminated in the 4 June event on The Mall in London, when over one million attended the parade and flypast. The Daily Mail stated in its editorial: \\"How the sour anti-Royalists in The Guardian newspaper and elsewhere have been confounded. They were convinced that the occasion would be a flop, that the House of Windsor was no longer capable of inspiring the loyalties it once did and that anyway the concept of royalty was passe in cool Britannia.\\" funeral cort√®ge of Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother, which took place in the midst of the Golden Jubilee year It was on 3 March that the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh returned to London from Australia. Eight days later, on Commonwealth Day, the Commonwealth Secretariat unveiled at Buckingham Palace a portrait of Elizabeth, painted by Chinwe Chukwuogo-Roy that had been commissioned to mark the Queen's 50 years as Head of the Commonwealth; the work now hangs at Marlborough House, with a study kept as part of the Queen's collection at St James's Palace. At the end of the month, however, the Queen was dealt another blow when her mother died on 30 March; the Commonwealth realms observed a period of mourning, and on 9 April, the day of her funeral, more than one million people filled the area outside Westminster Abbey and along the route from central London to the Queen Mother's final resting place beside her husband and younger daughter in St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle. Plans for the Golden Jubilee in the United Kingdom went ahead as planned, and, after a dinner hosted by Tony Blair at 10 Downing Street for her and all her living former British Prime Ministers (Sir John Major, The Baroness Thatcher, Sir Edward Heath, and The Lord Callaghan of Cardiff), the Queen officially launched the celebrations in the UK with a speech to both houses of the British parliament at Westminster Hall on 30 April, marking the fifth time in five decades that Elizabeth II addressed her British parliament on her own account. The Queen spoke of 50 unforgettable years and the changes to British life and society in that time, and elaborated that the monarchy must change also; Elizabeth said she had \\"witnessed the transformation of the international landscape through which [the United Kingdom] must chart its course\\" and declared her \\"resolve to continue, with the support of [the Royal Family], to serve the people... to the best of [her] ability through the changing times ahead.\\" For the Queen's goodwill visits, which commenced on 1 May, two to three days were spent in each corner of England; the Queen and the Duke first stopped in Cornwall, Devon, and Somerset before travelling to Tyne and Wear, then finally to Buckinghamshire and Berkshire. On 13 May, the couple were received in Northern Ireland, and visited such areas as County Fermanagh, Cookstown, and Omagh. Then, throughout much of mid-May, the royal couple were in London devoting much time to the promotion of the arts, attending the Chelsea Flower Show, dedicating the Queen's Gallery at Buckingham Palace, and attending a reception at the Royal Academy of Arts. The jubilee trips recommenced on 23 May with a six-day trip to Scotland; the royals first stopped in Glasgow, and then travelled on to Edinburgh, Dundee, Stornoway and Aberdeen, and, following the jubilee weekend in London, the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh on 7 June toured West Sussex, spent three days in Wales, touring Anglesey, Llanelli, and Cardiff. The next month, the royal couple made two-day trips to the West Midlands, Yorkshire (where the Queen visited the set of the soap opera Emmerdale), and the counties of Suffolk and Norfolk, as well as undertaking a three-day goodwill trip to Liverpool and Manchester, where the Queen opened the 2002 Commonwealth Games. The Queen closed out July by touring the East Midlands, and ended her domestic tour by visiting Lancashire. Amongst several other events independently organised to celebrate the Jubilee in June 2002 were the British Army's staging at Portsmouth of a special parade of 6,000 personnel from all three branches of the British Armed Forces. This contrasted with the vastly larger events of past Royal Jubilee, in that there was no Royal Naval Fleet Review, or large scale Army Review. The Queen's bodyguards mounted a conjoined parade, wherein 300 members of the Gentlemen at Arms, Yeoman of the Guard, and Yeoman Warders all marched together for the first time in the centuries since their respective foundations. Elizabeth also hosted a banquet for all of Europe's reigning kings and queens, one for all her incumbent Governors-General, and garden parties at both Buckingham Palace and Holyrood Palace for people born on Accession Day 1952. Around the country, street parties were organised, for which some 40,000 toolkits were distributed. Golden Jubilee Weekend People wave their flags outside Buckingham Palace The Golden Jubilee Weekend took place between 1 and 4 June 2002 in London, for which the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh left Scotland on 29 May to make final preparations. On the first evening, the Saturday, the Prom at the Palace took place in the gardens of Buckingham Palace and highlighted classical music; out of the two million who applied for tickets, 12,500 people were selected to attend, making the event the largest ever held on the royal property. The crowds were entertained by the BBC Symphony Orchestra and BBC Symphony Chorus, conducted by Sir Andrew Davis, and guest vocalists included Kiri Te Kanawa, Thomas Allen, Angela Gheorghiu, and Roberto Alagna. The following day, the Queen and her husband attended a church service at St. George's Chapel, Windsor Castle, while their family were present at thanksgiving services elsewhere in the United Kingdom; The Prince of Wales and his sons, Princes William and Harry, in Swansea; The Earl and Countess of Wessex in Salisbury; and The Princess Royal in Ayr. After time on 3 June touring Eton and Slough, Queen Elizabeth II and the Duke of Edinburgh returned to London and the former at 1:00 pm launched the nationwide BBC Music Live Festival, in which more than 200 towns and cities across the United Kingdom publicly played the Beatles song \\"All You Need Is Love\\". During the day, street parties were held around the country, and that evening, the Queen, the Duke, and other members of the immediate Royal Family, made themselves present at another concert on the grounds of Buckingham Palace; this f√™te, called Party at the Palace, showcased achievements in pop music over the previous 50 years, with headlining acts including Paul McCartney, Eric Clapton, Cliff Richard, and Tony Bennett. Queen guitarist Brian May commenced the event by playing his arrangement of \\"God Save the Queen\\" from the roof of the palace, and Paul McCartney concluded the night with such numbers as \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\" and \\"Hey Jude\\", which were each performed before and after the Queen lit the National Beacon at the Victoria Memorial, the last in a string of 2,006 beacons to be lit in a chain throughout the world, echoing Queen Victoria's own Golden Jubilee in 1887. 12,000 guests were allowed into the concert, while an additional one million people thronged The Mall to watch and listen to the festivities on giant television screens and join in with the palace audience's singing from outside the gates of Buckingham Palace, and a further 200 million watched the televised event around the world. Concorde and the Red Arrows ended the flypast over Buckingham Palace on 4 June On 4 June, the entire royal family attended the National Service of Thanksgiving at St Paul's Cathedral, to which the Queen rode in the Gold State Coach, followed by lunch at the Guildhall. There the Queen addressed the crowd and expressed pride at the Commonwealth's achievements, both during her reign as queen and throughout time; Elizabeth was quoted as saying: \\"Gratitude, respect and pride, these words sum up how I feel about the people of this country and the Commonwealth‚Äîand what this Golden Jubilee means to me.\\" The jubilee procession then started along The Mall in the early afternoon; in addition to entertainers performing for the Queen, numerous floats were decorated to illustrate British life through the years of Elizabeth's reign and driven through The Mall. The parade concluded with 5,000 adults and children from the 54 member-states of the Commonwealth of Nations marching in their various national costumes before the Queen and presenting to her a \\"rainbow of wishes\\", consisting of handwritten notes from school children across the Commonwealth. In front of more than one million people, the Royal Family assembled on the balcony of the Centre Room of Buckingham Palace and watched a flypast consisting of every type of Royal Air Force aircraft in service (27 in all), Concorde, and the Red Arrows. There was only one publicly noted negative event in relation to the jubilee when approximately 40 activists, mostly drawn from the anarchist Movement Against the Monarchy, were arrested during a protest in the run-up to the Jubilee Weekend. Celebrations in The Turks & Caicos Islands In the Turks and Caicos Islands, a British Overseas Territory, for the first four days of June, celebrations took place throughout the Islands, presided over by Governor Mervyn Jones. The Public Relations Department of the Tourist Board for the Jubilee Committee produced the Jubilee Souvenir Brochure, with text and images covering historical Royal Visits provided by the National Museum; only 5,000 were produced, issue number 1 being given to Queen Elizabeth II herself. The museum also provided photographs for the production of three sets of stamps, and, for the Jubilee Weekend, prepared a temporary exhibition on royal visits, with other items from the past, such as the coronation medals issued in to some local residents in 1953. Other items produced to commemorate the Jubilee were a straw crown made on Middle Caicos by Loathie Harvey and Judy Geddis, two 20-crown coins, and a badge given to all school children as a memento of the historic occasion. Celebrations outside the Commonwealth The Golden Jubilee was also marked in New York City, where the pinnacle of the Empire State Building was lit in royal purple and gold. The city's mayor, Michael Bloomberg, and officials at the British consulate said the tribute was a sign of thanks both to the Queen for having had the American national anthem played at Buckingham Palace during the Changing of the Guard on 13 September 2001 and to the British people for their support afterwards. It had been more than 10 years since the Empire State Building gave such an honour to an individual not from the United States; the most recent instance was when Nelson Mandela visited New York after his release from prison in 1990. Monuments and souvenirs Before, during, and after the jubilee year, souvenirs were created, monuments unveiled, and public works named in commemoration of the royal event. In Australia, Australia Post released a special stamp combining old and new images of Queen Elizabeth II, along with a booklet outlining the Queen's reign. In Canada, the Governor-in-Council earmarked $CAD 250,000 as a donation in the Queen's name to the Dominion Institute's Memory Project, aimed at educating Canadian youth on the experiences and contributions of the country's veterans from the First World War through to modern peacekeeping missions. The provinces also marked the milestone; the Ontario Governor-in- Council, on the advice of his premier, approved the renaming of Dalton Digby Wildlands Provincial Park as the Queen Elizabeth II Wildlands Provincial Park and, in Saskatchewan, an equestrian statue of Queen Elizabeth II was commissioned and erected alongside the Queen Elizabeth II Gardens on the grounds of the Legislative Building. In Alberta, the Queen Elizabeth II Golden Jubilee Recognition Act established the Queen's Golden Jubilee Citizenship Medal, the Queen's Golden Jubilee Scholarship for the Visual and Performing Arts, and the Premier's Citizenship Award in Recognition of the Queen's Golden Jubilee. A special ¬£5 coin was released in the United Kingdom to celebrate the event, and the annual Queen's Golden Jubilee Award for volunteer service groups was founded in 2002, while private enterprises produced various ornaments and trinkets as memorabilia of the jubilee; manufacturers such as Spode created various forms of commemorative china and crystalware. At Windsor Castle, the Jubilee Gardens were opened, the first new public area to be created since 1820, and a 167 feet (51-metre) inverted roller coaster, Jubilee Odyssey, was constructed at the Fantasy Island theme park in Lincolnshire. Legacy It was argued in retrospective analysis that the jubilee had been of benefit both to nationalism and the monarchy; the Daily Mail stated: \\"Below and in front of her an event as magical and magnificent as the Golden Jubilee itself was unfurling before her captivated eyes‚ÄîBritain was rediscovering the land of hope and glory,\\" and The Globe and Mail said: \\"When she daintily bent over to drop a puck at an NHL game... she achieved perhaps the most brilliant melding of symbolism in Canadian history... The Jumbotron in Vancouver's GM Place said it all, flashing the Queen's golden EIIR cypher on the giant screen atop the beer advertisement: 'I am Canadian'. The crowd went hysterical.\\" See also * Queen Elizabeth II Golden Jubilee Medal * 2002 Golden Jubilee Honours * Silver Jubilee of Elizabeth II * Diamond Jubilee of Elizabeth II * Sapphire Jubilee of Elizabeth II References External links * CBC website on the Golden Jubilee * BBC website on the Golden Jubilee * Department of Canadian Heritage: Golden Jubilee, a Canadian Celebration * Archives of Ontario celebrates the Queen's Golden Jubilee * Town of Markham, Ontario: Golden Jubilee, The Fiftieth Anniversary of the Reign of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II Category:2002 in Canada Category:2002 in the United Kingdom Category:British monarchy Category:Monarchy in Canada Category:Elizabeth II Category:Golden jubilees Category:2002 in Australia Category:2002 in Jamaica Category:2002 in New Zealand Category:Events involving British royalty ","title":"Golden Jubilee of Elizabeth II"},{"id":"2065388","text":"Andrew McQualter (born 9 June 1986) is an Australian rules footballer who played 89 games for the St Kilda Football Club in the Australian Football League (AFL).

It is one of the largest high schools in British Columbia. Enrollment of students is open to those within grades 8 through 12. The school is home to the International Baccalaureate program, facilities such as an Automotive shop, and a 1 year apprenticeship program. In 2007, the Fraser Institute ranked the school well within the top 50 secondary schools in British Columbia. This was out of the 279 public and private secondary schools operating in the province. The School is located in Metro Vancouver in BC's Lower Mainland region while the campus is centrally located within the region on the north side of the city of New Westminster. It encompasses an area of three city blocks by two city blocks. History Prior to the 1860s the site of the present school was a public cemetery where many of the prominent citizens of New Westminster were interred. Many of the citizens who were buried in this public cemetery were part of the Chinese community and as well as the Sikh's and Indigenous. After development in the 1870s the remains of those buried were transferred to the Fraser Cemetery, located elsewhere in the city. During the Second World War the corner of 10th Avenue and 8th, where the present school is located, was leased to the Federal Government. The site served as a soldiers' barracks, used for training and housing the Royal Westminster Regiment. After World War II, the barracks were moved to the University of British Columbia and the rest of the cemetery was demolished. Finally, in 1948 The public works yard was moved and the site was transferred to the New Westminster School Board for the construction of offices and a new high school. In September 1949 Vincent Massey Junior High was unofficially opened by Premier Bryan I. Johnson. On December 16, 1949, the school was officially opened. The school was named after the Right Honourable Vincent Massey, the eighteenth Governor General of Canada. The adjoining Pearson wing, named after the Right Honourable Lester Pearson, former Canadian Prime Minister, was home to the Senior High School prior to the two becoming amalgamated into the present New Westminster Secondary School. Academics The NWSS International Baccalaureate (IB) program is a pre-university course of studies, offered at NWSS since 2000. The school offers the Diploma Program (DP), the Certificate Program (CP), and an unofficial Pre-IB Programme. All of the programs require an exam entry, although exam entry into the Diploma and Certificate programs is not required if moving on from the Pre-IB Program. At NWSS, the Pre-IB Program prepares students for the rigors of the global IB Program by increasing the difficulty and workloads of the students. The Pre-IB Programme contains a course called RIM, or Research in Motion. This course is meant to give students a basis in discussion of ethics and technology useful in the diploma programme. It includes a research paper known as the Long Term Project (LTP), imitable of the 3000 word Extended Essay completed by Diploma candidates. The school has an ESL program for students whose second language is English. This program is offered to many International Students. A French Immersion program includes classes purely taught in French. This is the continuation of the Glenbrook Middle School late French immersion program. In this program, students are expected to speak French in most classes and upon finishing it, have almost native fluency. School facilities and resources =Sports teams= New Westminster Secondary School has more than 16 sports teams including: * American Football (Junior Boys, Senior Boys) * Soccer Team (Junior, Senior) * Badminton (Junior, Senior) * Volleyball (Juvenile, Junior, Senior) * Basketball (Juvenile, Junior, Senior) * Cosom Hockey (Everyone) * Field Hockey Team (Girls) * X-Country (Junior, Senior) * Track and Field (Junior, Senior) * Cheer and Stunt Team (Everyone) * Field Lacrosse (Junior Senior) * Olympic Wrestling (Juvenile, Junior, Senior) * Car Racing (Grade 12) * Tennis (Everyone) * Golf (Everyone) * Table Tennis (Everyone, all ages combined) * Extreme Chess (Everyone) Future development The New Westminster School District has announced the plans for the replacement of the New Westminster Secondary School (NWSS). NWSS will continue to be the biggest school in the Province of British Columbia with this largest and most complex construction project in the history of the province. Minister of Education Mike Bernier came to New Westminster on Tuesday, June 7, 2016, to announce the long-awaited funding approval for the New Westminster Secondary School replacement project. The $106.5 million replacement of New Westminster Secondary School will be completed near the end of the summer of 2020. This $106.5 million budget for the new school is the largest budget in BC history to be allocated to a school. Upon its completion, the new school will be home for over 2100 grade 9 to 12 students. The new school will be designed to meet today's standards for safety, accessibility and modern learning.

The box-and-one defense is a hybrid between a man-to-man defense (in which each defensive player is responsible for marking a player on the other team) and a zone defense (in which each defensive player is responsible for guarding an area of the court). Description In a box-and-one defense, four players play zone defense, and align themselves in a box protecting the basket, with typically the two larger (or frontcourt) players playing directly under the basket, and the two smaller (or backcourt) players playing towards the foul line. The fifth defensive player in a box-and-one defense plays man-to-man defense, typically marking the best offensive player on the other team. A box-and-one defense is usually used against teams with one dominant scoring threat. The idea is to try to shut that player down by forcing them to score against a dedicated man-to-man player, and a supporting zone. Players such as Allen Iverson and Ray Allen often faced box-and-one defensive schemes while competing for Georgetown University and the University of Connecticut, respectively. One variation is the \\"diamond-and-one defense\\", where the four players in the box are arranged in a diamond pattern (one under the basket, two between the basket and foul line, and the fourth at the foul line). Another variation is the triangle-and-two defense, in which three defenders play zone defense while the remaining two play man-to-man defense.  In the NBA  The biggest weakness of a box-and-one defense is its vulnerability to a pass to the middle of the \\"box\\". As there is no defensive player responsible for this area of the court, offensive teams are able to exploit the gap. A pass to the middle of the box or to the top of the box will generally yield a short-range shot from inside the key. Or, it will ‚Äúcollapse‚Äù the box, causing the four zone defenders to fall inside the key and, upon a second pass, yielding a wide open and uncontested look from the perimeter. It is for this reason that the box-and-one defense is not often seen in professional leagues. The defense was notably used in Games 2, 4, and 6 of the 2019 NBA Finals between the Toronto Raptors and Golden State Warriors. The Raptors utilized a box-and-one defense late in game 2 in order to shut down Steph Curry as he was the lone offensive scoring threat once Klay Thompson left with an injury and Kevin Durant was ruled out. This tactic prevented the Golden State Warriors from scoring for over five minutes. The Raptors were narrowly defeated despite having given up an 18‚Äì0 run at the start of the third quarter. In game 4, the Raptors once again employed the same defense in a 105‚Äì92 win to take a 3‚Äì1 series lead. After Thompson was injured in game 6, the Raptors again employed the box-and-one against Curry and won the game to win the championship. The Raptors once again used this defense in the 2020 NBA Playoffs during the Eastern Conference semifinals against the Boston Celtics. Throughout the series, the Raptors employed the defense again against Jayson Tatum in Game 4 and Kemba Walker in Game 6, winning both games. The box-and-one was used again in Game 7, but the Raptors ultimately lost the deciding game.  In Lacrosse  This strategy is also used in a man down situation in lacrosse. When a team has a penalty and is down a man, the team will send out a Long Stick Midfielder to add to the three Long Stick defensemen. As well there is one short stick midfielder. The Long Sticks make a tight box in front of the goal with the short stick on the crease. The four long sticks will play zone defense, with the closest man to the ball playing man to man, and the farthest splitting two offensemen. Every time the ball is passed the formation rotates to the next man. The short stick will play man to man if there is an attackman on the crease, otherwise he will join the rotation.  In Ultimate Frisbee  This strategy is also used in the sport of ultimate frisbee, which relies on defenses sometimes similar to basketball in its mixture of man and zone formats. In ultimate, the box-and-one defense is usually incorporated into a defensive strategy called the \\"cup\\", where 3 other players play a zone around the player in possession of the disc. If the boxed player is a handler (similar to a point guard in basketball) in possession of the disc, the cup will include the boxed player temporarily in their zone.

A Democrat, Nagin became internationally known in 2005 in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. Nagin was first elected as mayor in March 2002.Louisiana Secretary of State Election Results, March 2, 2002, Mayor City of New Orleans. He was re-elected in 2006 when the election was held with at least two-thirds of New Orleans citizens still displaced after Katrina struck. Term-limited by law, he left office on May 3, 2010. After leaving office, Nagin founded CRN Initiatives LLC, a firm that focuses on emergency preparedness, green energy product development, publishing, and public speaking. He wrote and self-published Katrina Secrets: Storms after the Storms.C.

Early life and career Nagin was born on June 11, 1956, in New Orleans' Charity Hospital, to a family of modest means. His childhood was typical of that of urban youth, and his father held two jobs: a janitor at New Orleans City Hall by night and a fabric cutter at a clothing factory by day. After the factory shut down his father became a fleet mechanic at a local dairy, to earn sufficient pay to support his family. His mother was employed as manager of a Kmart in-store restaurant. The family lived on Allen Street in the 7th Ward, followed by a stay near St. Peter Claver Catholic Church in the Trem√©, and then moved to the Cutoff section of Algiers. Nagin attended St. Augustine High School and O. Perry Walker High School,\\"RAY NAGIN .\\" (Archive ) Tulane University. Retrieved on March 15, 2013. where he played basketball and baseball. He enrolled at historically black Tuskegee University in Tuskegee, Alabama, on a baseball scholarship, played on championship teams, and graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in Accounting in 1978. He became a Certified Public Accountant. After graduating from college, he went to work in the purchasing department at General Motors in Detroit, Michigan. He moved to Los Angeles, California, then to Dallas, Texas in 1981 to take Internal Audit Manager and Division Controller jobs with Associates Corporation. In 1982, Nagin married Seletha Smith, a New Orleans native. Together, they have three children. In 1985, Nagin returned to New Orleans to become the controller of Cox New Orleans, the city's cable television franchise, run by the Cox media conglomerate. The franchise had a history of customer complaints, low profits, and stagnant growth, and was one of the poorest-performing components within Cox. Nagin was quickly promoted to general manager. In 1989, he was appointed to oversee all of Cox properties in south Louisiana as vice-president and general manager of Cox Louisiana, earning $400,000 annually, according to CNBC's \\"American Greed\\" In 1993, Nagin enrolled in the executive MBA program at Tulane University. Nagin also lobbied at the local, State, and Federal government levels, as many of the businesses he managed were regulated and required formal franchise renewals. His public profile was high because he hosted a twice-weekly television call-in show for customers. In 1995, Nagin received the Young Leadership Council Diversity and Role Model Award and later sat on the boards of the United Way and Covenant House. He also was one of the founders and president of 100 Black Men of metro New Orleans, an affiliate of the national organization of black businessmen. Nagin was a partner in a group that brought the New Orleans Brass to the city. Nagin became the team's president and investors' spokesman as they secured the hockey franchise. The initial popularity of the team allowed the group to secure the 18,000-seat New Orleans Arena as its home venue. That year, the local alternative newspaper Gambit Weekly named Nagin as its New Orleanian of the Year. =Political affiliation= Several news sources, including BBC News,A Conservative Defense of Ray Nagin .

Retrieved August 26, 2006. have stated that Nagin was a registered Republican for most of his adult life, and a George W. Bush supporter, but then switched to the Democratic Party shortly prior to seeking office in New Orleans. In 2004, he endorsed John Kerry for president. In a January 13, 2006 interview on the Tavis Smiley Show, Nagin denied this, stating that he \\"never was a Republican\\" and that he has been a \\"life-long Democrat\\", and several news organizations that reported he was originally a Republican were forced to issue retractions. However, he periodically gave contributions to candidates of both parties, including Representative Billy Tauzin in 1999 and 2000, as well as Democrat Senators John Breaux and J. Bennett Johnston, Jr. earlier in the decade. Nagin endorsed conservative Republican Bobby Jindal over conservative Democrat Lieutenant Governor Kathleen Blanco in the 2003 runoff for governor. 2002 mayoral election Nagin entered the race for mayor on the final day of qualifying. Shortly before the primary mayoral election, on January 17, 2002, the New Orleans Times Picayune and Gambit Weekly endorsed Nagin. In the first round of the mayoral election in February 2002, Nagin won first place with 29 percent of the vote. Some of his opponents were the Police Chief Richard Pennington, State Senator Paulette Irons, and City Councilman Troy Carter. In the runoff on Saturday, March 2, 2002, Nagin defeated Richard Pennington with 59 percent of the votes to become the 60th mayor of New Orleans. First term The 2004 Comprehensive Annual Financial Report of the City of New Orleans, as certified by CPA firm KPMG, highlighted many significant accomplishments of the Nagin administration. New Orleans gained 4,500 jobs that year. U.S. Census Bureau figures showed about 38,000 New Orleanians had risen out of poverty as the national average increased. According to The American City Business Journal, per capita income in New Orleans was rising at the fastest rate in the nation. Southern Business and Development named New Orleans number eight on the list of \\"comeback kids\\" in the south. New Orleans had back-to-back record tourist years, 10.1 million in 2004. A Yahoo/National Geographic Traveler poll named the city its number one family destination. Since 2002, the area had seen over $400 million of film productions, including movies like the Oscar award- winning Ray, starring Jamie Foxx, and All the King's Men, featuring Sean Penn. According to MovieMaker Magazine, New Orleans was the fourth-best place to film a movie and had earned the title \\"Hollywood South\\". In November 2004, the Nagin administration passed the city's largest bond issue, $260 million. New Orleans also jumped from 69th to 38th on Intel's list of \\"Most Wired Cities\\". The city's website went from being unranked to the 4th best in the nation. As Hurricane Ivan threatened the Gulf of Mexico in September 2004, Nagin urged New Orleanians to be ready for the storm. He advised evacuees to have some \\"Benjamins\\" ($100 bills) handy and urged those planning to stay not only to stock up on food and water but also to make sure they had \\"an axe in the attic\\". This was a reference to the many people trapped in their attics by rising floodwaters when Hurricane Betsy hit the city in 1965. Nagin issued a voluntary evacuation call at 6 p.m. on September 30th, and the interstates quickly filled as some 600,000 metro New Orleanians left. Traffic was so heavy that some trips took 12 hours or more. The hurricane missed the city. =Hurricane Katrina= U.S. President George W. Bush and Mayor Ray Nagin meet on September 2, 2005 In August 2005, Hurricane Katrina entered the Gulf of Mexico. Early on Friday, August 26, Mayor Nagin advised New Orleanians to keep a close eye on the storm and prepare for evacuation. He then made several public statements encouraging people to leave and advising that if they did not evacuate, \\"We will take care of you\\". By 10 a.m. Saturday, a mandatory evacuation was called for low-lying areas in the surrounding parishes‚ÄîSt. Charles, St. Tammany, Plaquemines, and Jefferson‚Äîand a voluntary evacuation for St. Bernard Parish. Nagin had, however, ignored federal and state offers of help and a recommendation to evacuate the city. In addition to the parishes' announcements, President George W. Bush declared a federal state of emergency for Louisiana. In accordance with the regional evacuation plan, New Orleans, along with the surrounding areas of Jefferson and St. Charles parishes, were given formal voluntary evacuation orders around 50 hours from landfall. This phased approach along with \\"contraflow\\", wherein all incoming interstate highway lanes are reversed outward, ensured that additional vehicles moving onto already congested roads would not create massive gridlock. The local newspaper reported that Nagin stopped short of ordering a mandatory evacuation because of concerns about the city's liability for closing hotels and other businesses.Nolan, Bruce. \\"Katrina Takes Aim\\" , The Times Picayune, August 28, 2005 After receiving a late night Saturday call from Max Mayfield, head of the National Hurricane Center, Nagin was advised that Katrina was headed to New Orleans. He ordered the city attorney to prepare legal documents for a mandatory evacuation of the city, the first in New Orleans' almost 300-year history. On Sunday, August 28 at 9:30 a.m., the mandatory evacuation order was signed and communicated to the public. The Superdome was opened as a shelter of last resort and police went throughout the city with loudspeakers alerting all remaining citizens to go to key pickup points for free bus rides. By Sunday evening 80% of New Orleanians and visitors were evacuated or relocated.Nagin, C. R (2011), Katrina's Secrets: Storms after the Storm After the hurricane hit, the federally built and maintained levees collapsed throughout the city. 80% of the city flooded, some areas as high as 20 feet, over rooftops. Food and water became scarce. Looting was common. After hearing reports on his wind up radio, Nagin criticized the federal and state response on WWL radio and his passionate outburst went viral. At a town hall meeting in October 2005, Nagin said: \\"I can see in your eyes, you want to know, 'How do I take advantage of this incredible opportunity? How do I make sure New Orleans is not overrun with Mexican workers\\". This was in response to a question from the audience.http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/2005/12/04/a-new-spice-in... Some Hispanic groups, including the United States Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, criticized Nagin's statement,USHCC Deplores Remarks by New Orleans Mayor Ray Nagin Regarding Mexican Workers and the Rebuilding of New Orleans ‚Äì Hispanic PR Wire, October 19, 2005. although those attending the town hall meeting reportedly applauded‚Äîmany believing jobs should first go to locals displaced by the hurricane. Nagin went on to say this was the city's biggest economic opportunity and urged New Orleanians to get more comfortable working beside someone who did not look like them, as everyone's help was needed. During a subsequent interview on Telemundo with Jose Diaz-Balart, Nagin praised the great work Hispanic workers did in New Orleans and said the city would not have recovered without them. = \\"Chocolate City\\" speech = Shortly after Katrina devastated New Orleans, there were calls for moratoriums on rebuilding certain neighborhoods. Two weeks after Katrina struck, Nagin took a weekend trip to Dallas to reunite with his family. While there, he was asked to meet with leading New Orleans businessmen to discuss the city's future. Nagin says he made it clear at the meeting that everyone had a right to return home, a claim contradicted by some businessmen in attendance. Many of the initial proposals to rebuild New Orleans focused on rebuilding areas with the highest likelihood of economic return. Many groups expressed concern that this might radically change the racial make-up of the city. The land deemed most economically viable was mostly city land above sea-level, in which the most economically-advantaged and white citizens resided; the majority of New Orleanians, especially black residents, lived in the outer edges of the city, where land was mostly below sea-level and deemed less economically viable. Nagin disavowed such proposals, and in response to residents' concerns, he used the phrase \\"Chocolate City\\" to signal that New Orleans would remain a majority black city. He first used the phrase during a Martin Luther King Jr. Day celebration speech in New Orleans on January 16, 2006 and repeated the metaphor several times. This was seized upon and parodied by some commentators, cartoons, and merchandising. Various designs of T-shirts with satirical depictions of Nagin as Willy Wonka were sold in the city and on the Internet. Nagin also said that New Orleans \\"will be a majority African- American city because this was what God wants it to be.\\"Nagin apologizes for 'chocolate' city comments ‚Äì CNN, January 18, 2006. Some people found the implication of Nagin claiming to know God's will to be as troubling as the racial aspects of his speech. He then condemned Washington D.C., by saying God \\"sent us hurricane after hurricane after hurricane, and it's destroyed and put stress on this country\\", suggesting God's disapproval of the 2003 invasion of Iraq. In an interview with Tavis Smiley broadcast on Public Radio International on January 13, 2006, Nagin said he used the phrase \\"chocolate city\\" in reference to a time in the 1970s when African Americans were just starting to exercise political power in places like Washington, D.C. The term had been used in many of Nagin's previous speeches and welcoming addresses to visitors of the city. The idea reportedly originated with the song \\"Chocolate City\\" by the popular 1970s funk group Parliament. 2006 mayoral election At the time of the 2006 election, at least two-thirds of its residents were still displaced. One candidate said in his Times Picayune interview he was running because the city's demographics had dramatically changed. There were three unsuccessful lawsuits filed to prevent delaying the original election date. In the April 22 election, Nagin was the front runner with 38% of the vote. Louisiana Lieutenant Governor Mitch Landrieu came in second with 29%. Nagin and Landrieu faced each other in a run-off election on May 20, 2006. Nagin defeated Landrieu 52% to 48%. Second term Nagin's second term began on June 1, 2006. He was intensely criticized by the local media throughout this term. For example, his \\"100-day plan\\" to accelerate the rebuilding of New Orleans was bashed for what critics said was a tardy release, lack of details and activity in moving forward. Nagin administration spokesperson Rob Couhig backed away from a 100-day promise, stating that it was not meant as a \\"time period,\\" but as a short-range initiative to improve quality-of-life issues. Delays in FEMA reimbursements and federal recovery dollars reaching the city caused many significant delays. He was also a member of the Mayors Against Illegal Guns Coalition, an organization formed in 2006 and co-chaired by New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg and Boston mayor Thomas Menino. In 2006, Nagin was also criticized for devoting time to extensive lobbying in Washington, DC and a national speaking tour. Nagin's administration said this was necessary in order to correct inaccurate perceptions of New Orleans and secure recovery support. In addition during 2007, a drastic increase in the city's violent crime rate led to more criticism of Nagin. Nagin called for and got help from the Louisiana National Guard and U.S. Justice Department. However, Nagin continued to be heavily criticized by the local newspaper. He reignited complaints when he said news of two killings should keep focus on the city's needs for more help and, \\"while sad, keeps the New Orleans brand out there.\\" King Abdullah of Jordan with Mayor C. Ray Nagin Nagin hired recovery expert Dr. Ed Blakely in 2007 to head up a dedicated Office of Recovery Management. The Rockefeller, Ford and Bill & Melinda Gates foundations provided grants for critical staff enhancements. During the end of 2007 and into 2008 Nagin guided the city through an extensive planning process that documented a $14 billion need. However, the state only allocated 2% of the plan and it took almost three years to receive any of these federal recovery dollars. By years 4 and 5, New Orleans made significant progress toward recovery. 85% of all city managed recovery projects were either recently completed, under construction, or in final design. By the end of 2009, there were over $20 billion in public & private sector construction related projects underway. Business Week said New Orleans was one of the best cities in America to ride out the great recession. Money Magazine ranked the city as the sixth-fastest-growing real estate market.https://money.cnn.com/galleries/2008/moneymag/...moneymag/6.html Outside Magazine said New Orleans was the 20th best town in American to live in. The U.S. Department of Labor in its April 2010 report said New Orleans had the lowest unemployment in the nation. Prior to leaving office in 2010, Nagin was appointed by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to head the United States delegation to a state and local governments conference on assistance to post- earthquake Haiti held in Martinique. A recovery plan was completed and presented to donor nations resulting in Haiti receiving billions in pledges. Corruption allegations, indictments, and convictions On April 7, 2009, the Times-Picayune alleged a conflict of interest with regard to a trip Nagin took to Hawaii in 2004. The vacation Nagin, then-chief technology officer Greg Meffert, and their families took in 2004 was claimed to be partially paid for by Meffert, but years later it was revealed that Meffert used a contractor's credit card to pay for Nagin's plane ticket.Frank Donze & David Hammer, \\"City vendor financed Nagin trip to Hawaii\\" in Times-Picayune, April 7, 2009, Metro Edition, pp. A1, A4 (quotation appears on p. A1) David Hammer of the Times- Picayune reported on April 23, 2009, that Nagin had taken \\"plenty of other trips\\" at the expense of NetMethods, a company owned by city vendor Mark St. Pierre. In April 2009, Nagin was obliged \\"to sit for a deposition as part of a civil lawsuit over the city's controversial crime camera program.\\"Michelle Krupa, Nagin to face camera contract queries, Times-Picayune, April 19, 2009, Metro Edition, pp. A1, A10 (quotation appears on p. A1). The Times-Picayune had obtained information that Mark St. Pierre, who allegedly paid for the holiday, had made substantial donations to Nagin's 2006 re-election campaign. Meffert was later charged with 63 felony counts in what authorities say \\"was a lucrative kickback scheme.\\"Hammer, D. (November 6, 2009). \\"Greg Meffert, wife, City Hall vendor to be arraigned on 63 counts Thursday in bribery scheme\\". Times-Picayune All but two of the counts were subsequently dropped, and Meffert eventually pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud and one count of filing a false income tax return.Times-Picayune Staff (November 1, 2010). \\"Greg Meffert, former city tech chief, pleads guilty\\". Times-Picayune. In April 2010, as a result of a FOIA request from a New Orleans news station, Nagin was investigated for destroying his official city emails. After a forensic investigation by computer forensics firm SunBlock Systems, 5,400 emails were recovered. Many of these emails were subsequently used as evidence in his 2013 criminal trial. In June 2012, Frank Fradella, who was facing major securities fraud charges, pleaded guilty in New Orleans federal court to one count of conspiracy to bribe a public official. According to The Times-Picayune, Fradella claims to have paid $50,000 and delivered truckloads of free granite to Nagin's sons' business in exchange for favorable treatment for Fradella's companies with city contracts. On January 18, 2013, Nagin was indicted on 21 corruption charges, including wire fraud, conspiracy, bribery, money laundering, and filing false tax returns related to bribes from city contractors.

It was included on The Smiths in February 1984 and as a B-side to the May 1984 single \\"Heaven Knows I'm Miserable Now\\". Background The song is about the Moors murders that took place on Saddleworth Moor, which overlooks Manchester, between 1963 and 1965. At the time of their deaths, many of the victims were only a few years older than Morrissey (born 1959), who wrote the lyrics of the song after reading a book about the murders, Beyond Belief: A Chronicle of Murder and its Detection by Emlyn Williams.Middles, Mick (1985), The Smiths. Omnibus Press. . \\"Suffer Little Children\\" was one of the first songs that Morrissey and Johnny Marr wrote together. The title of the song is a phrase found in the Gospel of Matthew, chapter 19, verse 14, in which Jesus rebukes his disciples for turning away a group of children and says: Lyrics Although five children were murdered in the Moors murders case, only three are named in the song: John Kilbride (\\"oh John you'll never be a man\\"), Lesley Ann Downey (\\"Lesley Ann with your pretty white beads\\"), and Edward Evans (\\"Edward, see those alluring lights\\"). The murders of Keith Bennett and Pauline Reade were not attributed to Myra Hindley and Ian Brady until 1985,Moors murders#Later investigation after \\"Suffer Little Children\\" had already been released. The phrase \\"Hindley wakes and Hindley says; Hindley wakes, Hindley wakes, Hindley wakes, and says: 'Oh, wherever he has gone, I have gone'\\" is likely a pun on the title of Hindle Wakes, a silent film which made use of location filming in Blackpool and Manchester. Reception =Controversy= First released on The Smiths in February 1984, it was re-released in May as a B-side of the single \\"Heaven Knows I'm Miserable Now\\". The Manchester Evening News reported that relatives of the Moors murder victims had taken exception to the lyrics, in which three of the victims are mentioned by name. Some newspapers also claimed that the single's sleeve photo of Viv Nicholson was intended to resemble Myra Hindley. Subsequently, Boots and Woolworths withdrew both the album and single from sale. Morrissey later established a friendship with Ann West, the mother of Moors victim Lesley Ann Downey, after she accepted that the band's intentions were honourable.

Published by Ashmolean Museum, 1989Various sources, e.g. Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, give his birth date as 21 April (Julian)/4 May (Gregorian). This cannot be correct; it implies a 13-day gap between the calendars; however, in 1870 the gap was 12 days. Saint Petersburg9 February 1960, Paris) was a Russian artist, art critic, historian, preservationist, and founding member of Mir iskusstva (World of Art), an art movement and magazine.Owen, Bobbi. Costume Design on Broadway: Designers and Their Credits, 1915-1985. p. 19 Greenwood Press: New York, 1987 As a designer for the Ballets Russes under Sergei Diaghilev, Benois exerted what is considered a seminal influence on the modern ballet and stage design. Early life and education Alexandre was born into the artistic and intellectual Benois family, prominent members of the 19th- and early 20th-century Russian intelligentsia. His mother Camilla (ru: –ö–∞–º–∏–ª–ª–∞ –ê–ª—å–±–µ—Ä—Ç–æ–≤–Ω–∞ –ö–∞–≤–æ—Å, and then –ë–µ–Ω—É–∞) was the granddaughter of Catterino Cavos. His father was Nicholas Benois, a noted Russian architect. His brothers included Albert, a painter, and Leon, also a notable architect. His sister, Maria, married the composer and conductor Nikolai Tcherepnin (with whom Alexandre would work). Not planning a career in the arts, Alexandre graduated from the Faculty of Law, Saint Petersburg Imperial University, in 1894. Entry into art career Baba Yaga, from the \\"Alphabet in Pictures\\", 1904 Three years later while in Versailles, Benois painted a series of watercolors depicting Last Promenades of Louis XIV. When exhibited by Pavel Tretyakov in 1897, they brought him to attention of Sergei Diaghilev and the artist L√©on Bakst. Together the three men founded the art magazine and movement Mir iskusstva (World of Art), which promoted the Aesthetic Movement and Art Nouveau in Russia. During the first decade of the new century, Benois continued to edit Mir iskusstva, but also pursued his scholarly and artistic interests. He wrote and published several monographs on 19th-century Russian art and Tsarskoye Selo. In 1903, Benois printed his illustrations to Pushkin's poem The Bronze Horseman, a work since recognized as one of the landmarks in the genre. In 1904, he published his \\"Alphabet in Pictures\\", at once a children's primer and elaborate art book, copies of which fetch as much as $10,000US at auction.\\"A Russian Alphabet Book\\" @ Streets of Salem. Illustrations from this volume were featured at a video presentation during the opening ceremony of the Winter Olympics in Sochi in 2014. In 1901, Benois was appointed scenic director of the Mariinsky Theatre in Saint Petersburg, the performance space for the Imperial Russian Ballet. He moved to Paris in 1905 and thereafter devoted most of his time to stage design and decor. During these years, his work with Diaghilev's Ballets Russes was groundbreaking. His sets and costumes for the productions of Les Sylphides (1909), Giselle (1910), and Petrushka (1911), are counted among his greatest triumphs. Although Benois worked primarily with the Ballets Russes, he also collaborated with the Moscow Art Theatre and other notable theatres of Europe. Surviving the upheaval of the Russian Revolution of 1917, Benois achieved recognition for his scholarship; he was selected as curator of the gallery of Old Masters in the Hermitage Museum at Leningrad, where he served from 1918 to 1926. During this time he secured his brother's heirloom Leonardo da Vinci painting of the Madonna for the museum. It became known as the Madonna Benois. Benois published his Memoirs in two volumes in 1955. In 1927 he left Russia and settled in Paris. He worked primarily as a set designer after settling in France. Family In 1894, Alexandre married Anna Karlovna Kind from a renowned Russian music family. They first met in 1876 when Alexandre was learning music from the family patriarch, Karl Ivanovich Kind (who came to Russia in 1850s by the invitation of Nicholas I of Russia to be the royal court's first string violinist). Anna and Alexandre were married for 60 years and are buried together at Batignolles Cemetery in Paris. Alexandre played a central role in the Russian artistic community both before and after the Revolution. Anna was always by his side. Her presence was positively remembered in the artistic circles with several mentions by artist like Mstislav Dobuzhinsky. She was a model painted by L√©on Bakst, Valentin Serov, Zinaida Serebriakova, and others.

Esound is a small sound daemon for both Linux and UNIX. ESD was created to provide a consistent and simple interface to the audio device, so applications do not need to have different driver support written per architecture. It was also designed to enhance capabilities of audio devices such as allowing more than one application to share an open device. ESD accomplishes these things while remaining transparent to the application, meaning that the application developer can simply provide ESD support and let it do the rest. On top of this, the API is designed to be very similar to the current audio device API, making it easy to port to ESD. ESD will mix the simultaneous audio output of multiple running programs, and output the resulting stream to the sound card. ESD can also manage network- transparent audio. As such, an application that supports ESD can output audio over the network, to any connected computer that is running an ESD server. ESD support must be specifically written and added into applications, as ESD does not emulate normal audio hardware APIs. Since ESD has been around for over a decade, earlier than almost any other sound server, a very large number of Unix applications have support for ESD output built-in, or available as add- ons. ESD was maintained as part of the GNOME project, but as of April 2009, all ESD modules in GNOME have been ported to libcanberra for event sounds or GStreamer/PulseAudio for everything else. PulseAudio 2.0 completely drops ESounD support. Architecture Overview Esound (ESD) is a stand-alone sound daemon that abstracts the system sound device to multiple clients. Under Linux using the Open Sound System (OSS), as well as other UNIX systems, typically only one process may open the sound device. This is not acceptable in a desktop environment like GNOME, as it is expected that many applications will be making sounds (music decoders, event based sounds, video conferencing, etc.). The ESD daemon connects to the sound device and accepts connections from multiple clients, mixing the incoming audio streams and sending the result to the sound device. Connections are only allowed to clients that can authenticate successfully, alleviating the concern that unauthorized users can eavesdrop via the sound device. In addition to accepting client connections from the local machine, ESD can be configured to accept client connections from remote hosts that authenticate successfully. Applications wanting to contact the ESD daemon do so using the libesd library. Much like with file i/o, an ESD connection is first opened. The ESD daemon will be spawned automatically by libesd if a daemon is not already present. Data is then either read or written to the ESD daemon. For an ESD client local to the machine that the ESD daemon is running on, the data is transferred through a local socket, then written to the sound device by the ESD daemon. For a client on a remote machine, the data is sent by libesd on the remote machine over the network to the ESD daemon. The process is completely transparent to the application using ESD.

General Romero was sworn in on July 1, 1977. He responded to accusations of \\"electoral fraud\\" by declaring a state of emergency for thirty days and established a rigidly conservative government. Romero's time in office was largely characterized by escalating violence and instability. In the late 1970s, political unrest increased, because of El Salvador's severe socio- economic inequalities unaddressed by his government and widespread discontent with government policy culminated in widespread protest and rebellion, which was met with reprisal by government forces. President Romero increased government education spending, but this won him no popularity with the left. The different police, military and government paramilitary forces launched a bloody repression campaign against leftist groups that ended the lives of 4 Catholic priests and numerous leaders and militants of workers and peasant organizations. He is accused of having ordered the student massacre of July 30, 1975. Left-wing armed groups responded to the violence exerted by the State with attacks on the security forces and government officials. The repression plunged the country into a serious social crisis. Romero held power until October 1979, when he was deposed with a reformist coup d'√©tat by dissident, politically leftist and moderate military officers and civilians. The coup d'√©tat that deposed Romero was preamble to El Salvador's twelve-year civil war.  Later life and death  After being deposed, Romero lived in exile in Guatemala before returning to El Salvador. He died on 27 February 2017 at the age of 92 of natural causes.

It was composed in 1828 and completed just two months before the composer's death. The first public performance of the piece did not occur until 1850, and publication occurred three years later in 1853. Schubert's only full-fledged string quintet, it has been praised as \\"sublime\\" or \\"extraordinary\\" and as possessing \\"bottomless pathos,\\" and is generally regarded as Schubert's finest chamber work as well as one of the greatest compositions in all chamber music. Composition and publication history The string quintet was composed in the summer or early autumn of 1828, at the same time as Schubert composed his last three piano sonatas and several of the Schwanengesang songs. Schubert completed it in late September or early October, just two months before his death. Schubert submitted it to one of his publishers, Heinrich Albert Probst, for consideration, saying that \\"finally I have written a quintet for 2 violins, 1 viola, and 2 violoncelli ... the quintet rehearsal will only begin in the next few days. Should any of these compositions by any chance commend themselves to you, please let me know.\\" Probst replied, asking only to see some of Schubert's vocal works and requesting more popular piano music. Even at this very late stage in Schubert's career, he was regarded as a composer who mainly focused on songs and piano pieces, and was definitely not taken seriously as a chamber music composer.Reed, John. Master Musicians: Schubert. Oxford, Oxford University Press, 1998, p. 172. The work remained unpublished at the time of Schubert's death in November 1828; the manuscript was sold to the Viennese publisher Diabelli by Schubert's brother Ferdinand shortly thereafter, but was neglected and indeed waited twenty-five years for its first publication in 1853. The manuscript and all sketches are now lost. The first known public performance occurred only three years earlier, on 17 November 1850 at the Musikverein in Vienna. Instrumentation and genre The work is the only full-fledged string quintet in Schubert's oeuvre. When he began composing his string quintet, Schubert had already composed an impressive body of chamber music for strings, including at least fifteen string quartets, most of which were composed for domestic performance by his family's string quartet. Schubert selected the key of C major in a possible gesture to two composers he greatly admired, Mozart and Beethoven, both of whom wrote string quintets in that key, Mozart's String Quintet No. 3 in C major, K. 515 and Beethoven's String Quintet, Op. 29 in C major. According to Charles Rosen, the opening theme of Schubert's work emulates many characteristics of the Mozart quintet's opening theme, such as decorative turns, irregular phrase lengths, and rising staccato arpeggios (the latter appear only in Schubert's recapitulation). But whereas the string quintets of Mozart and Beethoven are composed for a string quartet augmented by a second viola, Schubert adopts a somewhat unconventional instrumentation, employing two cellos instead of two violas, creating richness in the lower register. Before Schubert, Luigi Boccherini had replaced the second viola with a second cello; however, Schubert's use of the second cello is very different from Boccherini's, who uses the additional cello to create an additional viola line. Alfred Einstein has proposed that Schubert's use of a second cello to enhance the lower strings may have been suggested by George Onslow, who used a double bass in some of his quintets. Analysis The string quintet consists of four movements in the usual quick-slow-scherzo-quick pattern: #Allegro ma non troppo #Adagio #Scherzo. Presto ‚Äì Trio. Andante sostenuto #Allegretto =First movement: Allegro ma non troppo= In common with other late Schubert works (notably, the symphony in C major, D. 944, the piano sonata in B-flat major, D. 960, and the string quartet in G major, D. 887), the quintet opens with an extremely expansive movement: an Allegro ma non troppo that accounts for more than one third of the total length of the piece (typically, 50 minutes). The movement is notable for its unexpected harmonic turns. The exposition, lasting 154 bars, begins with an expansive C major chord: as in the G major quartet, D. 887, Schubert here \\"presents his harmonies‚Äîrather than a memorable, well-contoured melody‚Äîwithout a regular rhythmic pulse.\\" This is followed by music of gradually increasing motion and tension, leading to the contrasting second subject, in the unexpected key of E-flat, introduced as a duet between the two celli. The exposition concludes with a dominant (G major) chord that leads naturally back to the opening tonic chord on the repeat. However, after the repeat of the exposition, Schubert begins the development section with a daring modulation from the dominant to the submediant that \\"lift[s] the music magically\\" from G major to A major. =Second movement: Adagio= The \\"sublime\\" second movement, one of Schubert's rare adagios, is in three-part ABA (ternary) form. The outer sections, in E major, are of an otherworldly tranquility, while the central section is intensely turbulent: it breaks suddenly into the tranquility in the distant key of F minor. When the opening music returns, there is a running 32nd-note passage in the second cello which seems to have been motivated by the turbulence that came before it. In the last three measures of the movement, Schubert somehow contrives to tie the entire movement together harmonically with a modulation to the F minor of the middle section and an immediate return to E major. The use of ternary structure to contrast tranquil outer sections with a turbulent central section resembles the second movement of Schubert's Piano Sonata in A major, D. 959, composed at the same time as the quintet. The juxtaposition of E major and F minor, exceedingly distantly related keys, establishes the importance of the \\"tonal relationship of lowered second degree\\" (or flat supertonic) \\"to the tonic\\" which will be exploited in the third and fourth movements. =Third movement: Scherzo= The Scherzo, beginning in C major, is symphonic and large-scaled, with the open strings of the lower instruments exploited in an innovative manner that creates a volume of sound seemingly beyond the capabilities of five stringed instruments. The first section moves to A major and then back to C major. The middle section of this movement moves to E major, then B major, which is VI of III. The C major theme returns at the end. The Trio is in D-flat major, creating another important flat-supertonic relationship. =Fourth movement: Allegretto= The last movement is an exuberant sonata-rondo whose form resembles that of the finale of Mozart's C major quintet The main theme demonstrates clear Hungarian influences. The movement is in C major, but is built upon the interplay of the major and minor modes. It has unusual technical features, such as the final two notes: the flat supertonic (D-flat) and the tonic (C), played forte in all parts.Use of the flat supertonic is normally associated with the Neapolitan chord; but in Schubert's late works especially, the first note in this progression is often combined with augmented sixth harmony built on the flat supertonic rather than on the usual flat submediant. That characteristic harmonization is indeed used for a sustained flat supertonic in the bass part in the fourth- and fifth-last measures of the work. Legacy After Schubert's string quintet was belatedly premiered and published in the 1850s, it gradually gained recognition as a masterpiece. An early admirer was Brahms whose Piano Quintet (1865) was inspired in part by the newly discovered work. Brahms, in fact, originally wrote that work as a string quintet with two cellos (the complement used by Schubert) and only later recast it as a piano quintet. The piano quintet is in F minor, the key of the turbulent central section of Schubert's Adagio, while the third movement recalls the C minor/major of Schubert's Quintet, and that movement ends in the same manner as Schubert's finale, with strong emphasis on the flat supertonic D-flat, before the final tonic C.James Webster, \\"Schubert's sonata form and Brahms's first maturity (II)\\", 19th-Century Music 3(1), 1979, pp. 52‚Äì71. Current consensus holds that the Quintet represents a high point in the entire chamber repertoire. Although there is no reason to believe Schubert expected to die so soon after composing the work, the fact that the quintet was completed a mere two months before his death has inspired some listeners to hear in it a valedictory or death-haunted quality. For John Reed, the quintet prefigures Schubert's death, ending as it does with D-flat followed by C, both in unison and octaves: \\"As Browning's Abt Vogler put it, 'Hark, I have dared and done, for my resting place is found, The C major of this life; so, and now I will try to sleep.'\\" The violinist Joseph Saunders had the second theme of the first movement carved on his tombstone; Arthur Rubinstein's wish was to have the second movement played at his funeral. The second movement's plaintive mood makes it popular as background music for pensive or nocturnal scenes in film. Examples include Nocturne Indien, Conspiracy, The Human Stain, and Jim Jarmusch's The Limits of Control. Also, Episode 21 from the Inspector Morse television series (Dead on Time) draws extensively from this quintet, as does Episode 16 (Lazaretto) of its prequel Endeavour, and certain episodes in Desmond Morris's BBC series The Human Animal. Notable recordings Schubert's string quintet has often been recorded. The first recording was made by the Cobbett Quartet in 1925. Two recordings from the early 1950s are widely cited as legendary: a 1952 performance featuring Isaac Stern and Alexander Schneider, violins; Milton Katims, viola; and Pablo Casals and Paul Tortelier, cellos; and a 1951 performance by the Hollywood String Quartet with Kurt Reher on second cello (a 1994 CD reissue of this performance was awarded a Gramophone Award). Among modern recordings, that featuring the Melos Quartet with Mstislav Rostropovich (1977) has been acclaimed, and is notable for the exceptionally slow tempo adopted for the Adagio. Rostropovich later recorded the quintet with the Emerson String Quartet (12/1990) on the occasion of the gala concert celebrating the 125th anniversary of the BASF AG, Ludwigshafen. A few recordings of the quintet performed on period instruments exist, including a 1990 recording on the Vivarte label with the following lineup: Vera Beths and Lisa Rautenberg, violins; Steven Dann, viola; and Anner Bylsma and Kenneth Slowik, cellos.

In Anne Frank's posthumously published diary, The Diary of a Young Girl, he was referred to under the name Mr. Kraler. Kuglier was born in Hohenelbe (now Vrchlab√≠) in the German-speaking part of K√∂niggr√§tz region (Kr√°lov√©hradeck√Ω kraj/Hradec Kr√°lov√© Region), north-eastern Bohemia, Austria- Hungary, now in the Czech Republic, to Emma Kugler. He joined the Austro- Hungarian Navy during the First World War once his education was completed, but was discharged in 1918 after being wounded. He moved to Germany and worked as an electrician, then in 1920, Kugler moved to Utrecht, the Netherlands, to work for a company selling pectin. He joined the Amsterdam branch of Opekta as Otto Frank's deputy in 1924. He became a Dutch citizen in May 1938. In 1940, this allowed him to prevent the Nazi confiscation of Opekta and he accepted the directorship of the business, renamed Gies and Co, from Otto Frank. He and his wife, Laura Maria Buntenbach-Kugler (10 May 1895 ‚Äì 6 December 1952), lived in Hilversum during the war, a distance of about from Amsterdam. From July 1942 to August 1944, he aided his colleagues Miep Gies, Johannes Kleiman and Bep Voskuijl in the concealment of eight people, including Anne Frank, in a sealed-off annex in their office premises on Amsterdam's Prinsengracht. He was arrested by the Gestapo on 4 August 1944, by Karl Silberbauer. He was interrogated at the Gestapo Headquarters on the Euterpestraat, then transferred the same day to a prison for Jews and 'political prisoners' awaiting deportation on the Amstelveenseweg. On 7 September, he was moved to the prison on Weteringschans, in a cell with people sentenced to death. This was followed, four days later on September 11, by a transport to a concentration camp in Amersfoort where he was selected for transport to Germany. On 17 September, the Amersfoort train station was destroyed in a bombing (Arnhem Air Raid) and on 26 September, he and around 1100 other men were taken to Zwolle for forced labour, digging anti-tank trenches. Kugler was moved again on 30 December 1944, to Wageningen for forced labour digging under the German S.A. (Brownshirts or Storm Troopers) until 28 March 1945, when some 600 prisoners were marched from Wageningen through Renkum, Heelsum, Oosterbeek, Arnhem, and Westervoort, to Zevenaar with the intention of going on to Germany the following day. There was a bombing raid during the march and Kugler took advantage of the confusion to escape. He was hidden by a farmer for a few days, borrowed a bicycle and made his way back to Hilversum, where he lived, and which he reached in April 1945. He hid there in his own house until the liberation of the Netherlands on 5 May 1945. His wife, Laura Kugler, died on 6 December 1952 and three years later he married Lucie (Loes) van Langen. The couple moved to Canada, where the brother, sister and mother of Lucie already resided. On 16 September 1958, Kugler appeared as a guest challenger on the TV panel show To Tell The Truth. In 1973, he received the Yad Vashem Medal of the Righteous among the Nations and in 1977 the Canadian Anti-Defamation League awarded him a 10,000 dollar prize in recognition of his assistance in the hiding of the Frank and Van Pels families.

Jefferies, 1833 of the 5th Earl of Plymouth by his wife and cousin, Hon. Sarah Archer, daughter and eventual co-heiress of the 2nd Baron Archer.Obituary. He was the sixth Earl of Plymouth of the 1682 creation.The first creation in 1675 was for an illegitimate son (dsp 1680) of Charles II, and twelfth lord Windsor by writ 1529 (in the reign of Henry VIII). The recent creation in 1905 (in the reign of Edward VII was for the 6th earl's grandnephew Robert Windsor-Clive. Family The earl's mother, Hon. Sarah Archer (1762-1838), Countess of Plymouth & Countess Amherst of Arracan, after Andrew Plimer. Memorial to the 6th Earl of Plymouth at St Bartholomew's Church, Tardebigge He was born the only son, and had two sisters Lady Mary Windsor, who married the Marquess of Downshire and Lady Harriet Windsor, who married the Hon. Robert Clive, a son of the Earl of Powis and grandson of Clive of India. Styled Lord Windsor from birth, he inherited his titles from his father on 12 June 1799 at the age of ten, along with his father's land at Tardebigge, the country seat Hewell Grange, and land in Shropshire and Glamorgan. A year later (1800), his mother married Lord Amherst as his first wife, and bore him two sons. It is not clear if young Plymouth grew up with his stepfather (but highly likely); if so, he was exposed to the influences of Amherst's wide-ranging Court and political connections, culminating in his failed (1816) embassy to China. Plymouth was educated at Harrow. He married Lady Mary Sackville (1792‚Äì1864), elder daughter of John Sackville, 3rd Duke of Dorset, on 5 August 1811.A newspaper obituary (23 November 1833) says 3 August was the date of the marriage, but also claims that his late father-in-law was fifth [actually third] Duke of Dorset (in fact a cousin of his father-in-law).

There was no issue of the marriage, and Lady Plymouth later married his stepfather Lord Amherst (after his wife Plymouth's mother died in 1838). Since Plymouth was richer than his brother-in-law De La Warr (1791‚Äì1869), his mother-in-law Arabella, Duchess of Dorset and Countess Whitworth, left Knole in 1825 to her elder daughter Mary, on the grounds that her husband could better afford the annual upkeep of the house.\\"Knole\\" p. 793 The Examiner, Issues 883-933. p. 793. By Leigh Hunt, Albany William Fonblanque, John Forster. (ca.1825-6) The text states: \\"By demise of the Duchess of Dorset, the Earls of Plymouth and Delawar [sic] divide thirty-six thousand a year. Knole was bequeathed to the former, he being the richest man of the two, on the express condition that his Lordship should expend six thousand pounds per year on this favourite residence of the Sackvilles for several centuries. It was given by Baldwin de Bohun, in the reign of John, as a marriage portion to his daughter Alice, but as to the time when it was built, we have no immediate record. Lord Plymouth has projected vast improvements which have already been begun.\\" - Sussex AdvertiserRobert Sackville-West. Inheritance (2010). However, even in 1825, the Plymouths had no children in fourteen years of marriage, while the De La Warrs had already produced several sons. Plymouth's connections with and ties to Knole are not mentioned in his obituary; during her second marriage, his widow and Lord Amherst lived at Knole where Amherst died and is buried. By 1829‚Äì30, the Countesses of Plymouth and De La Warr (or rather, their husbands) had partitioned the Sackville family estates between them. Career Lord Plymouth was admitted to the House of Lords probably at the usual age of 21, although he was not active in politics. He voted against the first Reform Bill on 8 October 1831 along with the majority of the House of Lords. He was involved in the creation of the Worcester Yeomanry Division which fought in Spain. At his death, he was Colonel of the Worcestershire Yeomanry Cavalry. Also during his tenure, the Worcester and Birmingham Canal was built through Tardebigge (Tardebeck, Worcestershire) and good taxes were collected from the nailmakers of Redditch. The canal passes very close to Hewell Grange (now a state prison) and was finished ten years after Windsor inherited his father's title. The canal was finished in 1799; however the reservoirs were built twenty years later, and finished in 1836. Windsor bought Barnt Green House from the tenant Yates family who had resided there for some years. The Old Grange at Hewell Grange, where the 6th Earl kept his stud According to his obituary, Lord Plymouth was fond of hunting and kept a large stud at Hewell Grange Worcestershire and at Melton. In October 1832, he entertained the Duchess of Kent and her young daughter Victoria at Hewell Grange. Death Plymouth died on board his yacht, aged 44, at Deptford. During the night, he suffered an attack of apoplexy, and despite medical aid, died in the afternoon. He was buried in the family vault at St Bartholomew's Church in Tardebigge (then also called Tardebeck), Worcestershire. He is commemorated by an obelisk bearing his name, situated in the Lickey Hills Country Park and visible from Bromsgrove. His unusual forename 'Other' is traditional in the family and derives from a legendary Viking ancestor 'Otho' or 'Othere'. Obelisk dedicated to Other Windsor, 6th Earl of Plymouth Succession At his death, Plymouth was succeeded in the earldom by his bachelor uncle the Hon. & Rev. Andrew Windsor (b. 1764) who died unmarried in 1837. The earldom passed to the 7th Earl's youngest brother (youngest surviving son of the 4th Earl) after which the earldom became extinct in 1843. The 6th Earl's death without issue meant that the Windsor barony (1529) fell into abeyance between his two sisters, until it was called out of abeyance in 1855 in favour of the younger sister Lady Harriet Clive, who became Harriet Windsor-Clive and whose sons Robert and George also took the name Windsor- Clive. Harriet's grandson Robert Windsor-Clive, 14th Baron Windsor was created Earl of Plymouth in 1905 (third creation), and is the grandfather of the present Earl (b. 1923). Since the present Earl is the owner of the estates held by the 6th Earl, those might have descended by the 6th Earl's will to his younger sister Harriet and her heirs male.The estates include St Fagan's Castle, which came into the family by the marriage of Elizabeth Lewis and the 3rd Earl of Plymouth (it was bought by her ancestor Sir Edward Lewis of Van from Sir William Herbert (of the earls of Powis) in 1616). The castle and surrounding lands were given by the young 3rd Earl (of the 1905 creation) to form a Folk Museum in 1946, and it became the Welsh Folk Museum (now called the National Museum of Wales - Museum of Rural Life). Sir Edward Lewis of Van also owned other estates in Glamorgan as well as property in Wiltshire and Buckinghamshire Source: The Major Historic Family Estates in the Cardiff Area: Plymouth Estates Ltd.. retrieved 3 December 2012The earls of Plymouth own no property in Plymouth or around the city, rather like the Duke of Devonshire who has no property in that county. The family owned Peel Hall in Cheshire, Hewell Grange (rebuilt late 19th century by Robert Windsor-Clive, 1st earl of the 1905 creation; now a state prison since the 20th century) in Worcestershire, and Oakley in Shropshire, as well as lands in Flintshire. St. Fagan's Castle in Glamorgan was the family seat from the time of the 3rd Earl, our 6th Earl's great-grandfather.

However, it is still not clear if the 6th Earl left the estates to his sister Harriet or whether she inherited by will of the 8th and last Earl. When she died 1869, the estates passed to her grandson the future earl of Plymouth. References External links *Portrait of Lord Plymouth by Sir Thomas Lawrence in 1817.

Kardash died in the mid-1990s. The St. Cross Child Care Centre of Winnipeg was renamed the Mary Kardash Child Care Centre in her honour in 1995.

Chucky is portrayed as a notorious serial killer whose spirit inhabits a \\"Good Guy\\" doll and continuously tries to transfer his soul from the doll to a human body. The character has become one of the most recognizable horror icons, often mentioned alongside Freddy Krueger, Jason Voorhees, Ghostface, Leatherface, Pennywise, Pinhead, Leprechaun, Jigsaw and Michael Myers, and has been referenced numerous times in popular culture. In 1999, the Chucky character was nominated for the MTV Movie Award for Best Villain for the film Bride of Chucky. He was created by writer-director Don Mancini and is portrayed by Brad Dourif in both live action and voice over. For the 2019 remake of the same name, Mark Hamill voiced Chucky, having previously voiced the Charles Lee Ray version of the character in an episode of Robot Chicken. Appearances =Film= Chucky made his first appearance in the 1988 film Child's Play. In the film, serial killer Charles Lee Ray (Brad Dourif) uses a voodoo ritual to transfer his soul into a Good Guys doll in an effort to escape from Detective Mike Norris (Chris Sarandon). Now living in the form of the animated doll, Chucky (voiced by Dourif) is given to young Andy Barclay (Alex Vincent) and begins terrorizing the family. Chucky made his second appearance in the 1990 sequel, Child's Play 2. In the film, a resurrected Chucky continues his pursuit of Andy, who has been placed in foster care after the events of the first film. In Child's Play 3 (1991), Chucky again returns from the grave eight years after the events of the previous film to terrorize a now teenage Andy (Justin Whalin) who is currently in a military academy Bride of Chucky (1998) continues the story, with Chucky being resurrected by former accomplice and girlfriend Tiffany Valentine (Jennifer Tilly). After transferring Tiffany's soul into a bride doll, the two terrorize a young couple in an attempt to transfer their souls into human bodies. Seed of Chucky (2004) follows six years after the previous film when Glen/Glenda (voiced by Billy Boyd), the child of Chucky and Tiffany, brings his parents back to life. The trio then set their sights on actress Jennifer Tilly (in a fictionalized version of herself), for whom they have sinister plans. The 2013 film Curse of Chucky saw the series return to the straightforward horror elements found in the first three films. The film takes place twenty-five years after the events of the first film, as Chucky torments Nica Pierce (Fiona Dourif). In Cult of Chucky (2017), Chucky returns to torment a now institutionalized Nica, while a now adult Andy (Alex Vincent) attempts to stop Chucky's plans once and for all. In the 2019 remake of Child's Play, Chucky (voiced by Mark Hamill) is presented as a high-tech artificially-intelligent Buddi doll created by the Kaslan Corporation. Primarily designed to be a life-long companion to its owner by learning from its surroundings and acting accordingly, Buddi dolls can also connect to and operate other Kaslan products. One such doll has its safety precautions disabled by a disgruntled Kaslan employee during the assembly process, and as a result, Chucky gradually develops murderous tendencies as he tries to eliminate anyone or anything who's stopping him and his \\"best buddy\\" Andy Barclay (Gabriel Bateman) from staying best friends forever. Concept and creation =Design= Child's Play creator and co-writer Don Mancini explained that Chucky draws heavily from the My Buddy dolls: \\"In my original script, he was originally called Buddy, and we couldn't use it because of the 'My Buddy' doll. The director went out and got a 'My Buddy' doll, a Raggedy Ann, a Raggedy Andy and one of those life-size baby infants. What I told [designer] Kevin Yagher was, I wanted something similar to a My Buddy doll. I described \\"Buddy\\" in my original script, now \\"Chucky\\", as wearing red-buttoned overalls, red sneakers, striped sweater, with red hair, blue eyes, and freckles. Kevin went off and sketched many designs of Chucky, until the final was picked. Yagher then built the first doll from those sketches and my details\\". =Performance= For the first three films, Chucky was controlled by a team of nine puppeteers, led by Brock Winkless, who moved Chucky's mouth via radio control, using a rig that captured his own mouth movement. The others were in charge of operating the doll's head, face, and limbs. By the time of Curse of Chucky, Chucky's mouth, now performed by lead puppeteer Tony Gardner, was now operated via a radio-control unit without the need for a rig, and the doll himself now required fewer people to bring him to life.

The parish is long and thin, extending about east‚Äìwest but only about north‚Äìsouth. Its eastern boundary is the River Trent, which here also forms the county boundary with Lincolnshire. The parish is best known for Rampton Secure Hospital, which is at the hamlet of Woodbeck about west of Rampton village. The parish was renamed from Rampton to Rampton and Woodbeck on the 1st of April 2018. The 2011 Census recorded the parish population as 1,139. History The toponym \\"Rampton\\" is probably derived from Old English Ramm- t≈´n, meaning \\"farmstead where rams are kept\\". The village was an important manor from Norman times. The old manor house was pulled down around 1720, having been held by the Stanhope and Babington families. All that survives is the gateway, which includes the arms of Babington. On the eastern boundary of All Saints' churchyard is a mid-16th-century Tudor gateway to Old Manor Farm. It is brick with terracotta panels and is a Grade I listed building. It used to lead to the manor house, which was demolished about 1851. The area used to be served by Cottam railway station, just over northeast of Rampton village. The station opened in 1850 and closed in 1959. Parish church The oldest part of the Church of England parish church of All Saints is a 10th-century Anglo-Saxon column in its north arcade. Most of the building is Gothic or later, from the 13th to 17th centuries. The building was restored in 1894. The west tower is 13th-century and has a ring of six bells. George I Oldfield of Nottingham cast the third bell in 1622 and the fifth bell in 1635. Thomas Hilton of Wath-upon-Dearne cast the fourth bell in 1809. John Taylor & Co of Loughborough cast the treble, second and tenor bells in 1947. The church is a Grade I listed building. All Saints' parish is part of the Benefice of Retford Area Team Ministry.

It is a two-track system, and was launched to compete with existing 4-track cartridge technology. The cartridges play anywhere from eight to 24 minutes, and are continuous. Because of its portability, PlayTape was an almost instant success, and over 3,000 artists had published in this format by 1968. White cases usually meant about eight songs were on the tape. Introducing PlayTape At the time of PlayTape's launch, vinyl records reigned supreme, and Earl Muntz's Stereo-Pak (based on the broadcast \\"Fidelipac\\" cartridge system) was also a popular sound delivery system. His car players were offered with stereo sound. Bill Lear's 8-track tape system, though in production, had not yet achieved its market potential. Moreover, neither Lear or Muntz was offering a portable player, though Muntz eventually did sell one. While PlayTape found some success in reaching the youth audience, it was not as successful in targeting the business market. Stanton marketed his device as a dictation machine, but he was unable to persuade businesses to adopt his creation. Issues of player quality limited sales, and ultimately, the introduction of home and portable players by the 4-track and 8-track manufacturers led to the demise of PlayTape. Automobile players Only a handful of small compact players, and a few very rare car players were sold to the open market. In the United States, Volkswagen was the only manufacturer to offer a PlayTape player as optional equipment. They are collectors' items today. Volkswagen saw a market opportunity in the U.S. for automotive audio players in 1968. Frank Stanton, president of PlayTape, announced that Motorola would manufacture an automotive player in OEM and aftermarket models for Volkswagen. The \\"Sapphire I\\" OEM model was designed for in-dash installation, and included an AM radio. The \\"Sapphire II\\" aftermarket version omitted the radio, and was designed to hang from the dashboard. The price for either unit was said to be about US $40, (today US $). Stanton also claimed that VW dealers would carry about 250 PlayTape titles for sale, and that some Volkswagen dealers would also sell the full line of PlayTape home and portable players. \\"We feel that Volkswagen salesmen will be able to interest the purchaser of a Sapphire I player in a complementary model for his home,\\" Stanton said.

Early life and family  He was born in Raritan, New Jersey, on March 12, 1869 to Frederick Frelinghuysen (1818-1891) and Victoria Bowen (1830-1914). His father was a lawyer who studied under Richard Stockton Field. He came from a historic New Jersey political family. His paternal grandparents were John Frederick Frelinghuysen (1776‚Äì1833), a lawyer and brigadier general in the War of 1812, and his second wife, Elizabeth Mercereau Van Vechten. His great-grandparents were Frederick Theodore Frelinghuysen (1753-1804), lawyer, soldier, and Senator from New Jersey, and his first wife, Gertrude Schenck (1752/53-1794). Career After fighting in the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War and starting an insurance business, Frelinghuysen was elected to the state Senate in 1905 and became president of that body in 1909. He held several statewide offices before being elected to the U.S. Senate in 1916. He was New Jersey's first directly elected senator following ratification of the 17th Amendment to the Constitution in 1913. While in the Senate, he frequented the Chevy Chase Club and would often golf with his fellow Senators Warren G. Harding, Stephen B. Elkins, and Eugene Hale. In 1921, President Warren G. Harding signed the Knox‚ÄìPorter Resolution, officially ending America's involvement in World War I at Frelinghuysen's estate in Raritan, New Jersey. The President stayed on the estate until at least July 4. After a failed reelection bid in 1922, Frelinghuysen returned to the insurance business. In 1938, after considering a run for one of the United State Senate seats in New Jersey, Frelinghuysen declined to run. Instead, he put his support behind fellow Republican, former Senator W. Warren Barbour, for the Republican nomination. Barbour eventually won the Senate seat and served until his death in 1943.Barbour, Our Families 1 p.

Morgan Dix (1827‚Äì1908), the rector of Trinity Parish. His wife's portrait and that of Joseph Jr, were painted in 1916 by the Swiss-born American artist Adolfo M√ºller-Ury; it is today in the Newark Museum, New Jersey. Frelinghuysen owned an 88-foot houseboat called Victoria that Harding used for 12 days after he won the 1920 election for President, but before he was inaugurated in March 1921. He died on February 8, 1948 in Tucson, Arizona, and was interred at St. Bernard's Cemetery in Bernardsville, New Jersey. = Legacy = Memorial plaque marking Frelinghuysen estate site and signing of the Knox‚ÄìPorter resolution on July 2, 1921.

In battle with two Super-Skrulls, Spitfire rips out their throats with her teeth, displaying vampire traits from her Baron Blood bite that have been previously unseen.Captain Britain and MI13 #1 Captain Britain and MI13 writer Paul Cornell commented on her new traits, stating that: Even Spitfire herself shows some reservations about using her vampiric powers, as seen in the aforementioned attack on the Super-Skrulls: When new MI13 recruit and vampire hunter Blade first meets Spitfire, he stakes her.Captain Britain and MI13 #5 She survives only thanks to the powers of fellow MI13 member Faiza HussainCaptain Britain and MI13 #6 and later begins a romantic relationship with Blade.Captain Britain and MI13 #9 During Dracula's attack on Britain, Jacqueline's vampire son Kenneth visited herCaptain Britain and MI13 #10 and led her into a trap, where Dracula magically forced her into servitude.

As part of the Marvel NOW! event, Spitfire was seen assisting Captain Britain in running the Braddock Academy (the British answer to the Avengers Academy).Avengers Arena #5 Powers and abilities Jacqueline received superhuman powers as a result of a mutagenic reaction to a vampiric bite by the original Baron Blood, and a subsequent transfusion of artificial blood from the original Human Torch. As Spitfire, she possesses the ability to run at lightning-fast speeds, with reflexes, reactions, coordination, agility, and endurance to match. When she runs, a trail of non-damaging fire appears behind her. She can create cyclones by running in circles, and can run up walls and across water. Her skin is also hardened to withstand the rigors of such speed, providing a type of body armor, and her costume is synthetic stretch fabric chemically treated for protection from friction and other hazards of superhuman speed. In the years after World War II, as Spitfire aged she ceased the use of her superhuman speed. Due to a second transfusion of artificial blood from the original Human Torch, Spitfire today has the body of a teenage girl, although she is chronologically many decades older. Her hair was originally still white from age, but it began turning blonde again. It is said by the mutant sorceress, Selene, that Spitfire seems to possess a mutant regenerative power triggered by her transfusion of synthetic blood. With intensive study of her metabolism, blood stream, and glandular system, Selene hoped to one day duplicate the process. She has some vampire abilities including fangs that appear when she is angry. However, she feels no blood lust and has no need to drink blood. She has shown superhuman strength sufficient enough to break a sword made out of titanium and also displayed a healing factor, as she was able to heal a broken back and ribs in a few panels. Spitfire is a trained airplane pilot and exceptional athlete and hand- to-hand combatant, utilizing her ability to move at superhuman speeds, due to training by the original Union Jack and Captain America.

Historically, Claremont was part of Pickering Township, Ontario County, Ontariohttp://digital.library.mcgill.ca/countyatlas/images/maps/townshipmaps/ont- m-Pickering.jpg until 1974 when Ontario County was amalgamated into the Regional Municipality of Durham established at that time. It is one of many rural villages with suburban type housing mixed with older, historic buildings in the Greater Toronto Area. Brock Road, the main north-south Regional road in the area was realigned to bypass the village to the east in 1970. Claremont is situated just below the Oak Ridges Moraine in the Greenbelt. Typical of the moraine countryside, around 50 to 70% of the land area around Claremont is forested. The remaining land around the village is wooded farmland and streams. Until the establishment of regional government in 1974, the municipal offices of the former Township of Pickering were located in Claremont. Access to and traffic through Claremont increased greatly with the completion of the eastern extension of the Highway 407 highway, terminating at the Brock Road exit which opened in 2001. The Havelock Subdivision of the Canadian Pacific Railway runs through Claremont. This line is used for freight traffic, but there have been proposals for the return of passenger service as part of a GO Transit expansion to Peterborough. Claremont is located 20 km northwest of Oshawa and about 55 km northeast of Downtown Toronto.  Nearest places  *Markham, west *Whitchurch-Stouffville, northwest *Uxbridge, north *Brooklin, east *Greenwood, southeast *Pickering, south  History  In 1972, the Government of Canada expropriated 7,530 ha of land just west of Claremont for a possible future airport. Indeed, by the late-1990s, the Greater Toronto Airport Authority (GTAA) there were plans initiated to build an international Airport in Pickering which would be constructed to relieve congestion at Pearson International Airport, located some 70 km to the southwest. This new airport was also going to become the main cargo facility for the Greater Toronto Area. But air traffic at Pearson declined in the years to follow and is only slowly returning (although it has not reached) to previous passenger volumes. Also, terminal expansion at Pearson and the massive Cargo infield development by the GTAA have further delayed Pickering Airport from becoming a reality, at least in the near future. But in 2005, there has been renewed discussion about airport construction. The plan anticipates 11.9 million passengers per year (or 32,600 per day) by 2032.Cf. Transport Canada, Plan Showing Pickering Airport Site; also Greater Toronto Airports Authority, Pickering Airport Draft Plan Report , 6.3. By comparison, Pearson Airport had 32.3 million passengers in 2008, with an average of 1,179 \\"aircraft movements\\" per day (GTTA, Toronto Pearson Fast Facts . A confidential \\"needs analysis study\\" was completed by the Greater Toronto Airports Authority for the federal government in May 2010; in summer 2010 Transport Canada began a \\"due diligence review.\\"Keith Gilligan, Pickering News Advertiser, Pickering airport analysis in hands of Transport Canada, (May 19, 2010); L. Cassibo, Uxbridge Cosmos, Pickering Airport Plans Still Grounded , (March 4, 2010), pp. 6, 9; K. Calis, DurhamRegion.com, Liberals Demand Release of Airport Study (Aug. 12, 2010). The current landholders, mostly rural farmers are leasing the land from the federal government. Claremont is the closest community to the future airport/terminal building locations. The Claremont General Store was destroyed by fire in July 2009. The building was built in 1847 and had been operated as a General Store since it was originally built - one of the longest operating General Stores in Canada.For the early history of Claremont, cf. Claremont Past and Present: Historic Sketch Written upon Occasion of the Centennial Celebration , 1938.  Community features  Claremont has a fire station and community hall, two churches, a Royal Canadian Legion hall (Branch 483), cafe (Old Brock Cafe), community co-op (which also serves as a Liquor Control Board of Ontario and Beer Store outlet) and an elementary school (Claremont Public School). Claremont was also the hometown of legendary Canadian painter Tom Thomson, who was born in Claremont on August 5, 1877.Pickering Ajax Digital Library, Thomson House .  Community events  = Yard Sale Day = Claremont is well known in the local area for its annual \\"Yard Sale Day\\", an event where all residents are invited to host simultaneous garage/yard sales. The sale is typically held on the second or third Saturday of June and has been known to draw well over 1000 visitors and bargain hunters to the small hamlet. Due to its popularity, the annual event also spawns fundraisers, BBQs, and other community gatherings. = Winter Carnival = Claremont remains a vibrant and active community even through the cold of winter with its annual Winter Carnival that marks a week's worth of events in January or February. The most popular of these events include a winter parade through town, a teen dance at the local community centre, karaoke at the Legion, and the highly anticipated Trapper's Ball, along with a host of traditional winter activities including snowshoeing, tobogganing, family skates at an outdoor community rink, and a neighbourhood snow sculpture contest.  Local government  Claremont is part of the City of Pickering which is governed by an elected city Council consisting of six councillors and one Mayor. The City of Pickering is divided into three wards, each ward electing a City Councillor and a Regional Councillor. Claremont is part of Ward 3. The current council was elected in November 2011. The members of the council are: Mayor Dave Ryan Ward 1 (South West Pickering) City Councillor Kevin Ashe Ward 1 (South West Pickering) Regional Councillor Jennifer O'Connell Ward 2 (South & Central Pickering) City Councillor Doug Dickerson Ward 2 (South & Central Pickering) Regional Councillor Bill McLean Ward 3 (South East & North Pickering) City Councillor Shaheen Butt Ward 3 (South East & North Pickering) Regional Councillor David Pickles  References   External links  *Claremont Enquirer Website *Claremont at Geographical Names of Canada Category:Neighbourhoods in Pickering, Ontario Category:Designated places in Ontario ","title":"Claremont, Ontario"},{"id":"2065634","text":"Daniel Healy Solwold Jr. (born April 15, 1978), better known by his ring name Austin Aries, is an American professional wrestler and voice actor. He is known for his work with TNA/Impact Wrestling, where he is a former three-time world champion and a six-time X Division Champion and Ring of Honor (ROH), where he was the first multi-time ROH World Champion. He is also known for his stint with WWE, where he competed primarily in the cruiserweight division as well as doing color commentary. Between TNA/Impact and ROH, Aries has held 14 total championships and has also held numerous international and U.S. independent championships. Aries began to work with ROH in 2004, joining the Generation Next faction. He won the ROH World Tag Team Champion with his teammate Roderick Strong and at Final Battle 2004, ROH's biggest event, defeated Samoa Joe to win the ROH World Championship, ending his 654-day reign. He would regain the title on 2009, becoming the first multi-time champion. After moving on to Impact Wrestling, then known as Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (TNA), Aries won the X Division Championship six times. His first reign is the longest of the title's history at 301 days and created the \\"Option C\\" clause, trading the title for a TNA World Heavyweight title opportunity at Destination X, winning the title. He also won the TNA World Tag Team Championship and the Impact Grand Championship, making Aries a Grand Slam Champion in Impact Wrestling.  Professional wrestling career  = Early career (2000‚Äì2004) = Solwold began training under Eddie Sharkey and Terry Fox in 2000 and debuted on November 11, 2000, facing \\"Sheriff\\" Johnny Emerald. He wrestled in the midwest for several years before his east coast wrestling career was jumpstarted after he progressed to the finals of the 2004 ECWA Super 8 Tournament, where he was defeated by Christopher Daniels. = Ring of Honor (2004‚Äì2007) = From there, he joined Ring of Honor. Aries made his ROH main show debut at ROH: Reborn Stage 2 on April 24, 2004. Aries was unsuccessful, however, losing a four corner survival match also involving Jimmy Rave, Rocky Romero, and the winner, Nigel McGuinness. Aries was scheduled to return at the show of May 22, Generation Next, to compete in a one night series which would showcase young, upcoming ROH talent. Alex Shelley, however, hand-picked Aries, along with Roderick Strong and Jack Evans, as members of a new stable (also meant to promote young, upcoming ROH talent) who, instead of earning their spots, would simply take them. The group took the name Generation Next as their own. Aries captured the ROH World Championship at Final Battle 2004 on December 26, 2004, by defeating the longest reigning ROH World Champion Samoa Joe. On June 16, 2005, Ring of Honor named Aries the new head trainer at the ROH wrestling school, replacing the former head trainer, CM Punk, who had agreed to a contract with World Wrestling Entertainment. After a six-month string of non-stop defenses, many of which were international, Aries lost the championship to CM Punk on June 18, 2005. On December 17 at Final Battle 2005, Aries teamed with Strong to defeat Sal Rinauro and Tony Mamaluke for the ROH World Tag Team Championship. The two then disbanded Generation Next on June 3, 2006. In a first time ever match, Aries took on Pro Wrestling Noah wrestler KENTA on June 24, but was defeated following KENTA's Go 2 Sleep. On September 16, he and his partner Strong lost the ROH World Tag Team Championship to The Kings of Wrestling (Chris Hero and Claudio Castagnoli). Aries and Strong continued to team together for the rest of the year. At Battle of the Icons on January 27, 2007, Aries and Strong teamed up with Jack Evans to defeat Davey Richards, Delirious and SHINGO. This apparent Generation Next reunion was short lived when, at the following show on February 16, Strong attacked Aries after their tag team title match against Christopher Daniels and Matt Sydal. Strong then formed the \\"No Remorse Corps\\" with Davey Richards. Jack Evans ran down and pulled Strong off Aries, but refused to side with either of them. The following night, Aries called out Strong twice, but was unable to get his hands on him. When Evans refused to side with him, Aries said he was going to form a new faction with members of the next generation of wrestling. With that, he formed \\"The Resilience\\" with Erick Stevens and Matt Cross. On April 27, Aries unsuccessfully challenged Takeshi Morishima for the Ring of Honor World Championship. On May 4, 2007, Ring of Honor announced on their website that they had signed a pay-per-view deal with G-Funk Sports and Entertainment. Following the announcement, TNA pulled Aries and Homicide, both under contracts with TNA, from all Ring of Honor shows. = Total Nonstop Action Wrestling (2005‚Äì2007) = In July 2005, Total Nonstop Action Wrestling held an Internet poll to select an opponent for the TNA X Division Champion Christopher Daniels at their August 14 pay-per-view, Sacrifice 2005. Billed as an \\"Internet dream match\\", the poll offered voters the choice of Aries, Roderick Strong, Jay Lethal and Matt Sydal, none of whom were contracted to TNA or had even appeared with the company on a regular basis in the past. Aries won the poll by a landslide, and thus faced Daniels in a non-title match at Sacrifice, which he lost. Following the event, it was rumored that TNA officials had been impressed by Aries and were considering offering him a contract, and these rumors were seemingly substantiated when Aries faced and defeated Roderick Strong at Unbreakable on September 11 in a \\"showcase match\\". Aries in the ring in 2006 On September 22, 2005, Aries announced on his website that he had received a contract offer from TNA, and intended to sign it. He became a regular member of the TNA roster, and formed a stable with Roderick Strong and Alex Shelley. Many fans referred to this group as the second coming of Generation Next, which had contained Shelley, Strong, Aries, and Jack Evans in Ring of Honor. In February 2006, he and Strong were both suspended for two months for arriving four hours late for the pay-per-view Against All Odds. This occurred because of Aries and Strong's decision to remain in Long Island for an ROH show, despite TNA's last minute request to travel to Florida because of the potential of a snowstorm. In the build-up to Bound for Glory, promos began to air advertising the debut of a new wrestler, Austin Starr, at the event with the slogan \\"A Starr is Born\\". Starr appeared for TNA on October 22 as the first entrant and became the winner of the \\"Kevin Nash Open Invitational X Division Gauntlet Battle Royal\\" at Bound for Glory. After the match, Kevin Nash presented Starr with a bowling trophy and a hug. On the following episode of Impact!, it was announced that Starr would work closely with Nash's group Paparazzi Productions, much to the dismay of one of the group's founders, Alex Shelley. Starr replaced Johnny Devine as a member of Paparazzi Productions and participated in the Paparazzi Championship Series along with Shelley, eventually losing to Shelley in the finals at Final Resolution 2007. Starr then went on to feud with Senshi. On April 18, 2007, Starr was suspended for ninety days. On May 7 it was reported by the Wrestling Observer Newsletter that the suspension stemmed from TNA asking Austin to tape promo vignettes on a day he believed to be his day off. Starr did ultimately agree to do the vignettes but TNA saw this as a bad attitude and was reason for his suspension. During the suspension, Aries requested, and was granted, his release from TNA. = Return to ROH (2007‚Äì2010) = One month after being granted his release from TNA, Aries made his return to Ring of Honor. At United We Stand on June 22, 2007, Aries was in attendance, but as a \\"fan\\". During a match between the No Remorse Corps and The Resilience, he was verbally called out by Roderick Strong. Aries tried to climb over the guard rail, but was held back by security as he was no longer employed by the company. The following night, at Driven, Aries was again in attendance. Following a six-man tag team match between the No Remorse Corps and Delirious and The Resilience, Aries ran through the crowd and attacked the NRC. He then signed an ROH contract in the ring. Aries' first match back came at Race to the Top Tournament: Night One, when he faced Roderick Strong, Jimmy Rave and Gran Akuma in a Four Way Fray for the FIP World Heavyweight Championship. The feud between The Resilience and the No Remorse Corps continued at ROH's Death before Dishonor V weekend. The first night, Aries teamed with Erick Stevens to defeat Roderick Strong and Rocky Romero. However, they were not as lucky the following night, when they, along with Delirious, lost in a Street Fight to the No Remorse Corps and Matt Sydal. Aries in 2007 At Manhattan Mayhem II, Aries defeated former Generation Next stable mates Roderick Strong and Jack Evans in a triple threat match. At Glory by Honor VI: Night Two, Aries disbanded The Resilience in order to focus on regaining the ROH World Championship. At Rising Above, Aries faced current ROH champion Nigel McGuinness in a losing effort in an attempt to regain the ROH World Championship. Aries began to act frustrated due to losing matches and began refusing to shake hands after matches. Jimmy Jacobs displayed interest in adding Aries to The Age of the Fall (AotF). Tammy Sytch also offered Aries her managerial services. Aries was defeated by McGuinness a second time at Supercard of Honor III in March 2008. Afterwards, Aries left with Lacey, seemingly joining the AotF. Aries returned in April and revealed that Lacey had decided to leave the AotF and that he and Lacey had become a couple. This outraged Jacobs, who attacked Aries and started a feud with him. Shortly afterwards, Lacey was apparently attacked by Jacobs outside a gym. On April 23, Aries was chosen by Jay Briscoe as his replacement for brother Mark Briscoe as to defend the ROH World Tag Team Championship against The Age of the Fall after Mark was forced out of action due to an injury. The reasoning for this choice was Aries and the Briscoe Brothers' shared hatred for the Age of the Fall. Aries was not considered to have won the championship a second time, but rather to have been a substitute in a title defense. After their first and only title defense, the championship was vacated. On June 6 Aries teamed with Bryan Danielson in Ring of Honor's one night tournament to crown new World Tag Team Champions. They defeated Roderick Strong and Davey Richards in the first round before being eliminated in the second by eventual winners Jimmy Jacobs and Tyler Black. On June 7 Aries and Danielson received a title shot against Jacobs and Black but were defeated when Black pinned Danielson with a Phoenix Splash. On June 27, Aries was defeated by Necro Butcher in a \\"Relaxed Rules\\" match following a chair shot to the head. Aries had unsuccessfully attempted to get Butcher to leave the Age of The Fall and when Necro refused, he ceased fighting back against him. On June 28, Aries pinned ROH World Tag Team Champion Jimmy Jacobs in a \\"Relaxed Rules\\" match following a 450¬∞ splash despite interference from Necro Butcher, Tyler Black, Allison Wonderland, and MsChif. On July 25, Aries and Jay Briscoe teamed to defeat ROH World Tag Team Champions The Age of The Fall (Jimmy Jacobs and Tyler Black) in a No DQ Match when Briscoe pinned Black. On July 26, in Detroit, Aries spent much of the show brawling with Jimmy Jacobs culminating in both men brawling at the top of a 20-foot ladder. Jacobs' partner in the Age of The Fall, Necro Butcher, eventually tipped the ladder over sending them both crashing through a table below. Aries continued his feud with Jimmy Jacobs throughout the fall. In the second Steel Cage Warfare Match at Glory by Honor VII, Aries' team (Aries, Briscoe Brothers) defeated Jacobs' team (Jacobs, Black, Delirious) and Necro's team (himself only). The two had a best of three series to somewhat put an end to the feud. The first match took place at Ring of Homicide 2, where Jacobs (with help from Delirious and Brodie Lee) defeated Aries in a Falls Count Anywhere Match. The second match took place at Bound By Hate, and Aries defeated the bloody Jacobs in a Dog Collar Match. The deciding match was at Rising Above 2009 in a \\"I Quit\\" Match. Lacey returned to ROH in Aries' corner, and Aries won the match. Aries continued his feud with the Age of the Fall this time against the heavily cheered Tyler Black. At Final Battle 2008, Black was defeated by Aries in a Number One Contender's Match. After the match Jacobs attacked Black, and Aries ran in to make the save. Instead, however, Aries teamed up with Jacobs to attack Black. Aries later explained that the reason that he attacked Black was because the fans turned on him. In addition to his work in ROH, Aries was announced as a member of Team Epic War for Chikara's King of Trios 2009 tournament. On the first night, Aries, along with Ryan Drago and Tony Kozina, lost to the F1rst Family (Arik Cannon, Darin Corbin and Ryan Cruz) in the first round. On the second night, Aries lost to Player Dos in the Rey de Voladores opening four corners match. On the final night, Aries lost to Eddie Kingston in a singles match. In early 2009, Aries also underwent a complete character transformation, cutting his long hair, donning new pink and black trunks, and coming to the ring in a bright pink fur jacket. He dropped his darker persona and adapted to a new ladies man gimmick, often referring to himself as \\"A Double\\" and \\"The Greatest Man That Ever Lived\\", the latter after a song by Weezer, which also became his new entrance theme. On June 13, 2009, at Manhattan Mayhem III, Aries won a three-way elimination match against the ROH World Champion Jerry Lynn and Tyler Black, to become the first person to have held the ROH World Championship on more than one occasion. On December 19, 2009, at Final Battle 2009, ROH's first live pay-per-view, he defended the title by wrestling Tyler Black to a 60-minute time limit draw. On February 13, 2010, at the main event of ROH's 8th Anniversary Show, Aries lost the ROH World Championship to Tyler Black. During the following months he feuded with Delirious and Jerry Lynn, while also becoming the manager of Rhett Titus and Kenny King, the tag team known collectively as the All Night Express, dubbing himself the \\"Greatest Manager That Ever Lived\\". In October 2010 Aries' profile was removed from ROH's official website, after reports had surfaced that the promotion was going to be cutting down the size of their roster. On October 6, 2010, competing promotion Evolve announced that Aries would make his debut for the promotion on November 20. = Dragon Gate USA (2010‚Äì2011) = On October 12, 2010, Dragon Gate USA announced that Aries had signed a contract with the promotion. Aries made his debut for the promotion on October 29 at the Bushido: Code of the Warrior pay-per-view, where he was defeated by Open the Dream Gate Champion Masato Yoshino in a non‚Äìtitle match. After the match, Rich Swann, whom Aries had offered to adopt as his prot√©g√©, turned his offer down. On January 28, 2011, at United: NYC, Aries defeated Swann in a singles match. The following month Aries started a storyline, where he claimed to have lost the motivation to continue his professional wrestling career, after failing to make the cast of WWE Tough Enough, before offering to put his Dragon Gate USA career on the line in order to get one last shot at Yamato and the Open the Freedom Gate Championship. On April 2 at Mercury Rising 2011, Aries was unsuccessful in his challenge, thus seemingly bringing his Dragon Gate USA career to an end. The following day at Open the Ultimate Gate, Aries was defeated by Jimmy Jacobs in what was billed as his Dragon Gate USA farewell match. However, after the match Aries feigned passing the torch to Chuck Taylor, Johnny Gargano and Rich Swann, the trio known collectively as Ronin, before turning on them and joining the promotion's top heel group, Blood Warriors, claiming to have found his purpose under the leadership of CIMA. Blood Warriors and Ronin faced each other in a six-man elimination tag team match on June 5 at Enter The Dragon 2011, which Ronin won after Johnny Gargano managed to submit the Gargano Escape on both CIMA and Aries. On June 9, 2011, it was reported that Aries had left both Dragon Gate USA and Evolve to reportedly pursue a career outside of professional wrestling.

The cover art is painted by Leo Hao. The band intended to record a DVD since early 1998, however, due to the band's high requirements, no existing metal festival had been considered suitable. Instead, Blind Guardian decided to create their own festival, back in their homeland. The First Blind Guardian Festival was held in Coburg, Germany, on June 16‚Äì17, 2003. It lasted 2 days, with the band playing during both nights. The entire show has been professionally recorded and subsequently released on a DVD entitled Imaginations through the Looking Glass on June 14, 2004. Content The show had been very well prepared for the recording, with complex lighting and pyrotechnic effects set up to assist the musicians in creating the atmosphere. Blind Guardian's performance is generally considered excellent, and the degree of the audience's involvement was surprising even to the band members themselves. This is especially visible when the crowd continued to sing the chorus of \\"Valhalla\\" after the song was well over, stopping to cheer, and then starting to sing again, joined by an impromptu drum beat. The setlist was partly based on a poll conducted on the band's website, which (combined with the amount of time the band had) led to a varied set with classics like \\"The Bard's Song (in the Forest)\\" but also some rarely played songs such as \\"Somewhere Far Beyond\\". There are two (two-layer) DVDs in the release; the first one contains the show itself, with 20 tracks and approximately 125 minutes of running time. Disc 2 contains extra material, including an interview with the band and 4 bonus songs, recorded in previous tours. The set has a typical Blind Guardian fantasy-style artwork painted by Leo Hao, mixed with photos from the show, with several humorous elements included such as a picture of Legolas, Gimli and Gollum buying tickets for the concert.

Kleiman was registered as a proxy for the bank in May 1924 and given full powers in December of that year when the bank went into liquidation. He was hired by Frank as a bookkeeper for Opekta and Pectacon in 1938, but had become a close friend from about 1933, when the Frank family fled to the Netherlands to escape Nazi persecution in Germany. Johannes Kleiman became a member of the board of Opekta and the company was established at his home address for the next five months until it moved to Prinsengracht 263 at the end of 1940. He officially joined as bookkeeper for both Opekta and Pectacon, with Victor Kugler and secretary Bep Voskuijl for Pectacon, and Otto Frank and his secretary Miep Gies for Opekta. In August 1944, Kleiman was arrested with Victor Kugler during the Gestapo raid that arrested the Frank family and four other concealed Jews in the premises on the Prinsengracht. After interrogation at Gestapo headquarters, he and Kugler were transferred to a prison on the Amstelveenseweg for Jews and political prisoners awaiting deportation. Kleiman was imprisoned in the Amersfoort labour camp before he was released by special dispensation of the Red Cross because of his ill health. In all, he was a prisoner of the Nazis for about six weeks. After the publication of Anne Frank's diary, which detailed her two years in hiding, Kleiman regularly took journalists and visitors around the former hiding place, which had been vacated in the early 1950s. He became very involved in the establishment of the Anne Frank Foundation on 3 May 1957 but did not live to see the building open as a museum in 1960. He died, behind his desk, on 28 January 1959. Otto Frank was devastated about this loss. On 8 March 1972, Yad Vashem recognized Kleiman as one of the Righteous Among the Nations.

It dates roughly to the same time as his monumental Death and the Maiden Quartet, emerging around three years after his previous attempt to write for the string quartet genre, the Quartettsatz, D 703, that he never finished. History Starting in 1824, Schubert largely turned away from the composition of songs to concentrate on instrumental chamber music. In addition to the A-minor String Quartet, the Quartet in D minor, the Octet, the Grand Duo and Divertissement a la Hongroise (both for piano duet), and the Sonata for Arpeggione and Piano all date from that year. With the exception of the Grand Duo, all of these works display cyclic elements‚Äîthat is, two or more movements in each work are deliberately related in some way to enhance the sense of unity. In the case of the A-minor Quartet, a motive from the third-movement Minuet becomes the most important melodic figure for the following finale . Schubert dedicated the work to Schuppanzigh, who served as the first violinist of the string quartet appointed by Beethoven. Schuppanzigh himself played in the premiere performance which took place on 14 March 1824. Structure =Movements= The quartet consists of four movements which last around 30 minutes in total. #Allegro ma non troppo #Andante #Menuetto: Allegretto ‚Äì Trio #Allegro moderato =Analysis= The first movement opens with a texture reminiscent of the melancholic theme from one of Schubert's earliest songs, Gretchen am Spinnrade and also quotes \\"Sch√∂ne Welt, wo bist du?\\" The reference to Gretchen am Spinnrade is not a direct quotation, but rather is a similarity in the second violin‚Äôs restless accompanimental figuration, hovering around the mediant and underpinned by a repeated figure in cello and viola, which precedes the first thematic entrance. This also recalls the accompaniment to the first subject of the \\"Unfinished\\" Symphony (; ). It is the second movement, however, which has lent the Quartet its nickname, being based on a theme from the incidental music for Rosamunde (a similar theme appears in the Impromptu in B-flat written three years later). The dactyl-spondee rhythm pervading this movement unmistakably shows the influence of Beethoven's Seventh Symphony . The form of this slow movement uses the same modified exposition-recapitulation form found in the slow movement of Schubert's \\"Great\\" C-major Symphony, where an ambiguity of formal definition is created by the introduction of a developmental passage shortly after the return of the primary theme in the recapitulation . The minuet quotes the melody of another song by Schubert, Die G√∂tter Griechenlandes, D. 677, from November 1819, a connection only first noticed more than a century after the work's composition by Willi . The opening of this melody recurs in inversion at the beginning of the trio, and is later echoed in the opening of the finale .

Early life and military career Casey was born in East Greenwich, Rhode Island. He graduated from the United States Military Academy in 1826 (39th out of 41). He fought in the Second Seminole War under William J. Worth from 1837 to 1842. During the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War he fought at the Battle of Contreras and Battle of Churubusco, and was appointed brevet major on August 20, 1847 for gallant conduct. He then fought in the Battle of Molino del Rey and was severely wounded during the Battle of Chapultepec on September 13, 1847.

He was promoted to colonel in the regular army on October 9. Casey eventually became a division commander in the IV Corps under Brig. Gen Erasmus Keyes. During the Battle of Seven Pines, Casey's division was attacked by D.H. Hill's Confederates and driven from the field in panic. Gen. George McClellan blamed them for the disaster, in spite of the fact that it was the smallest, least experienced, and least well-equipped division in the army and clearly should not have been placed in such a vulnerable location as the Seven Pines crossroads. Casey was removed from division command and replaced by Brig. Gen John J. Peck. For the remainder of the Peninsula Campaign, Casey and his former division were relegated to a post around army headquarters at Harrison's Landing and kept away from the front lines. After the Seven Days battles, when McClellan conducted a review of the army, the soldiers in Casey's division turned their backs and refused to cheer him. He was promoted to major general of volunteers on July 27 (to rank from July 4) in general promotion of all the army's corps and division commanders.War Department General Order 181 dated 1st November 1862 formalising the Summers' promotions He wrote the three-volume System of Infantry Tactics, including Infantry Tactics volumes IInfantry Tactics vol. 1: by Brig,-Gen.

The character appears in stories set in the Marvel Universe, commonly in association with the X-Men. She is the older sister of Emma Frost, Christian Frost and Cordelia Frost. Publication history Adrienne Frost first appeared in Generation X #48 (February, 1999). The issue was scripted by Jay Faerber and drawn by Terry Dodson. Fictional character biography =Early years= Adrienne was the first child born to Hazel and Winston Frost. Siblings Christian, Emma and Cordelia followed. The Frost home was not one of love and kindness but one of mind games and control. Adrienne established herself as the \\"perfect child\\" and was the favorite of their cold and emotionless father, hoping to gain his favor and inherit the Frost family fortune. Adrienne was a power monger and showed little remorse or emotion when hurting her siblings both emotionally and physically. At an early age Adrienne discovered her mutant ability of psychometry: the ability to touch an object and instantly know the object's history in terms of events surrounding its past, present, and future owners. Her power revealed to her what she had always known: Winston, her father had little intention of dividing his fortune between all of his children. Instead, he planned to pick the child who he perceived as being able to guide his company into a state of growth and prosperity. This simply reinforced her original beliefs and she became cold and distant to the world, the only people who were worth anything were those she could manipulate in her chess game of power. Her power allowed her to become an 'A' student and excel in all her endeavors, continuing to earn her father's favor. However, Emma's rebellion against their father lead to Winston developing a profound new interest in her. To demoralize her, Adrienne outed Christian, to whom Emma was closest,Emma Frost #4 and set in motion the events that led to his attempted suicide.Emma Frost #5 She also exposed Emma's kiss with her teacher Ian Kendall, which resulted in him being fired. In retaliation, Emma shocked her sister by exposing Adrienne's secret modeling career, of which their father disapproved. Despite her plans Adrienne had no control over the fact that her father saw Emma as akin to him when he was young. Confident, Adrienne gathered with her siblings for her father to reveal who would guide his finances into the next millennium. Believing herself to be the prime candidate, Adrienne was shocked when their father chose Emma as his heir. However, sick of her father's manipulations, Emma chose to leave and make it on her own, leaving Adrienne as the second choice. Adrienne continued living under her father, at times even suffering his physical abuse. She continued to resent Emma and their father, going so far as to release to the media a ransom video of Emma that had been sent to their father. Winston, having disowned Emma, wished to ignore the video, but was placed in the public eye by Adrienne's actions. After this, it is unknown what happened to her parents. Adrienne assumed control of Frost Enterprises, using her powers to increase her wealth and power. She married and later murdered her husband, Steven, with whom she frequently clashed. =Headmistress of Generation-X and Revenge= Emma approached Adrienne seeking to borrow money after her Massachusetts Academy had fallen into debt. Initially turning Emma down because of their history, Adrienne accepted her offer after using her powers to learn that the academy was secretly the home for Generation X.Generation X #49 She became co-headmistress of the Massachusetts Academy and convinced her sister to re-open the school to the public to raise the funds necessary to keep the school open. As a result of the new human student body, Generation-X was forced to wear uniforms that hid their identities. She also gave Generation X new and sometimes questionable assignments, intentionally putting them in harm's way.Generation X #51 The first of these assignments was to retrieve a sword from Madripoor that she had used to kill her husband. Her real intentions for accepting Emma's offer then surfaced. Using a combination of her powers and the Danger Room, she trapped Generation X in a simulation recreating Emma's earlier students The Hellions' demise at the hands of Trevor Fitzroy.Uncanny X-Men #281 She had hoped to drive Emma insane by watching another group of her students die. While Emma and Generation X were able to escape this illusion, Adrienne, now calling herself the new White Queen, escaped by using a teleportation device concealed as a necklace around her neck.Generation X #56 Adrienne went to London where she successfully embezzled millions from the London branch of the Hellfire Club. She then began to plot her revenge on Emma by returning to the school, demanding that she be reinstated as headmistress or she would expose the school as a mutant sanctuary. She revealed the school's mutant students regardless, starting riots among human students, and later planted bombs at the school aimed at killing a maximum number of students - a plot that was only foiled by the sacrifice of Synch, who died containing the blasts. Emma later confronted Adrienne, who made it clear that she intended to escalate the violence and endanger more students. Recognizing that her powers did not work on Adrienne, Emma shot her in the chest.Generation X #75 Emma then hid Adrienne's death from her students, going so far as to psychically mindwipe an investigating policeman. Emma then inherited Adrienne's fortune and Frost Enterprises. Their discovery of Adrienne's murder at Emma's hands caused Generation X to no longer trust Emma. =Posthumous= Adrienne appeared once more‚Äîas that of a mental illusion to her sister Emma, who was having conflicting emotions about having killed her. In the end, however, Emma realized she was not sorry that she had killed Adrienne, only that she didn't kill her before she endangered her students.X-men Unlimited #34 Powers and abilities Adrienne had the mutant ability of psychometry. She was able to touch an object and instantly know a history of many events concerning the object, such as all of its previous owners, events that took place around the object, and the possible future of the object and its future owners. It allowed Adrienne to gather otherwise private information which she turned towards investigation, extortion, and espionage. Adrienne was also completely immune to her sister Emma's telepathy. She was also an exceptionally skilled and intelligent business woman and expert manipulator.

Cricket commentator, Colin Bateman, stated \\"Jack Birkenshaw was the epitome of a good all-round county cricketer: a probing off-spinner who used flight and guile, a handy batsman who could grind it out or go for the slog, a dependable fielder and great competitor\\". Lean times at Yorkshire and Leicestershire Born on 13 November 1940, in Rothwell, near Leeds, Yorkshire, Birkenshaw attended John Lawrence cricket school at Rothwell from the age of seven, and when aged 14 he appeared for Rothwell Grammar School and Yorkshire Schools. He was also a stand-off in the school rugby team. He played cricket for Lofthouse, Farsley and Leeds. Birkenshaw played a single County Championship match for Yorkshire at the age of 17 in 1958, taking the wicket of Jim Parks in both innings, but did not make another first-class appearance until 1959. That year he took 40 wickets at an average of 27.39, and also played for Minor Counties against the touring Indians; he made a second and final Minor Counties appearance against the South Africans the following year. In all, he played thirty games for Yorkshire, but failed to win his county cap, and in 1961 he moved on to Leicestershire. For a long while Birkenshaw's performances for Leicestershire were rather disappointing. In his first six years at the club he never took more than 27 wickets in a season, and he had to rely on some useful lower- order contributions with the bat to keep his place in the side. He earned a place in the history books by playing (exclusively as a batsman) in the pioneering Midlands Knock-Out Cup limited-overs tournament in 1962. However, he was capped by the county in 1965, and greater success was lying ahead. Breakthrough and England recognition In 1967, Birkenshaw took 111 wickets ‚Äì in the previous six seasons combined he had managed 102 in total ‚Äì at an average of only 21.41. He took five in an innings on five occasions, including 7‚Äì86 against Sussex, and gained selection for the International XI that toured Pakistan in the winter. 1968 proved another good season for Birkenshaw, as he again took 100 wickets, and punished Sussex again: this time with the bat as he made 101 not out. He made two more centuries the following year, but surprisingly for a man who passed fifty on 57 occasions in first-class cricket, he was to reach three figures just once more in his career. The years between 1969 and 1972 saw Birkenshaw record solid statistics, taking 69, 63, 89 and 90 wickets in successive seasons, and in 1972 he achieved his career- best bowling of 8‚Äì94 against Somerset. Such performances attracted the interest of the England selectors, who had previously stuck by Ray Illingworth as their first-choice off-spinner, and Birkenshaw was picked to go to India and Pakistan in 1972/73. He made 64 on his debut in the fourth Test against India at Kanpur, and also claimed three wickets; his first victim in Test cricket was Sunil Gavaskar. Birkenshaw retained his place for the fifth Test at Bombay, and opened the batting in the second innings, but lost his place for the Pakistan series and played only in the third Test, taking 5‚Äì55 and sharing the second-innings wickets equally with Norman Gifford. Despite another decent domestic season in 1973, Birkenshaw was omitted from the England side for both series that summer (against New Zealand and West Indies), the 41-year-old Illingworth again being the barrier to his selection. However, there was no Illingworth on the winter tour to the Caribbean, and Birkenshaw played in the last two Tests. A total return of 2‚Äì96 and 15 runs in three innings was not enough to keep his place for the summer of 1974, and that was as far as his England career lasted. Later career and retirement He played on for Leicestershire for a number of years, helping them win the County Championship in 1975, making his fourth and final first-class hundred, and recording his best bowling figures in one-day cricket, taking 5‚Äì20 against Essex in the Sunday League. Oddly, these were the only wickets he took in the 11 one-day games he played that year. In 1976, Birkenshaw made his only one- day hundred, but his unbeaten 101 against Hampshire in the second round of the Gillette Cup failed to win the game, Leicestershire falling short of their target by three runs. Birkenshaw finished with Leicestershire in 1980, but had one final season in the game with Worcestershire. In his penultimate match he made 32 and 54 against the Australian tourists, and his final first-class match came in late July 1981 against Northamptonshire. The first wicket of his first-class career had been that of a famous Test player, and with a pleasing symmetry the last was to be too: Kapil Dev, caught behind for 79. This match was also notable for being the first first-class game to be held at Stourbridge for 19 years. After retirement, Birkenshaw became an umpire, standing in over 250 matches from 1982 to 1988 including two Tests and six One Day Internationals, four of the latter being at the 1983 World Cup. His last game as an umpire was the Refuge Assurance Cup final in September 1988. He later returned to his old county of Leicestershire in the capacity of coach, after a similar spell at Somerset. As coach, he led the county to the County Championship title in 1996 and 1998. Birkenshaw was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 2011 Birthday Honours for services to cricket.

At the time the area was known as Al-Andalus. The hagiography describes in detail the executions of the martyrs for capital violations of Islamic law, including apostasy and blasphemy. The martyrdoms related by Eulogius (the only contemporary source) took place between 851 and 859. With few exceptions, the Christians knowingly risked execution by making public statements proclaiming their Christianity in the presence of Muslims. Some of the martyrs were executed for blasphemy after they appeared before the Muslim authorities and denounced Muhammad, while others who were Christian children of Muslim- Christian marriages publicly proclaimed their Christianity and thus were executed as apostates.. Still others who had previously converted to Islam denounced their new faith and returned to Christianity, and thus were also executed as apostates. The lack of another source after Eulogius's own martyrdom has given way to the misimpression that there were fewer episodes later in the 9th century. Historical background In 711 AD, a Muslim army from North Africa had conquered Visigoth Christian Iberia. Under their leader Tariq ibn-Ziyad, they landed at Gibraltar and brought most of the Iberian Peninsula under Islamic rule in an eight-year campaign. The Iberian Peninsula was called al-Andalus by its Muslim rulers. When the Umayyad Caliphs were deposed in Damascus in 750, the dynasty relocated to C√≥rdoba, ruling an emirate there; consequently the city gained in luxury and importance, as a center of Iberian Muslim culture. Once the Muslims conquered Iberia, they governed it in accordance with Islamic law. Blasphemy and apostasy from Islam were both capital offenses. In Islam, blasphemy includes insulting Muhammad and the Muslim faith. Apostasy is the crime of converting away from Islam. Under Islamic law, anyone whose father is Muslim is automatically a Muslim at birth and will automatically be guilty of apostasy if they proclaim any faith other than Islam. Anyone found guilty of either blasphemy or apostasy was swiftly executed. During this time, Christians could retain their churches and property on condition of paying a tribute (jizya) for every parish, cathedral, and monastery; frequently such tribute was increased at the will of the conqueror. Christians also had to abstain from any public displays of their faith in the presence of Muslims, as such an act was considered blasphemy under Islamic law and punishable by death. Many Christians fled to Northern Spain; others took refuge in the monasteries of Sierras. Still others converted in order to gain favor or avoid the jizya, and thus the number of Christians shrank eventually to small proportions.Osuna, Manuel Garcia. \\"Cordova.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 4. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1908. 18 Feb. 2014 In 786 the Muslim caliph, Abd-er Rahman I, began the construction of the great mosque of C√≥rdoba, now a cathedral, and compelled many Christians to take part in the preparation of the site and foundations. The executions of the martyrs caused tension not only between Muslims and Christians, but within the Christian community. Abd er-Rahman II at first ordered the arrest and detention of the clerical leadership of the local Christian community. As the civil disobedience seemed to subside, the clergy were released in November 851. When several months later there was a new wave of protests, the emir turned again to the Christian leaders as the ones most capable of controlling the Christian community. Instead of imprisoning them, he ordered them to convene a council in C√≥rdoba to review the matter and develop some strategy for dealing with the dissidents internally. He gave the bishops a choice: Christians could stop the public dissent or face harassment, loss of jobs, and economic hardship. Upon the death of Abd-er Rahman II in 852, his son and successor Muhammad I removed all Christian officials from their palace appointments. Reccafred, Bishop of C√≥rdoba, urged compromise with the Muslim authorities. Eulogius, who has been venerated as a saint from the 9th century, viewed the bishop as siding with Muslim authorities against the Christians. The closures of monasteries where some of the martyrs had lived occurred towards the middle of the 9th century. The monk Eulogius encouraged the public declarations of the faith as a way to reinforce the faith of the Christian community and protest the Islamic laws that Christians saw as unjust. He composed tractates and martyrologies, of which a single manuscript, containing his Documentum martyriale, the three books of his Memoriale sanctorum and his Liber apologeticus martyrum, was preserved in Oviedo, in the Christian kingdom of Asturias in the far northwestern coast of Hispania. The relics of Eulogius were moved there in 884. Causes Wolf points out that it is important to distinguish between the motivations of the individual martyrs, and those of Eulogius and Alvarus in writing the Memoriale. Jessica A. Coope says that while it would be wrong to ascribe a single motive to all forty-eight, she suggests that it reflects a protest against the process of assimilation. They demonstrated a determination to assert Christian identity. Wolf maintains that it is necessary to view the actions of the martyrs in the context of the penitential aspect of 9th century Iberian Christianity. \\"Martyrdom was in fact a perfect solution... Not only did it epitomize self-abnegation and separation from the world, but it guaranteed that there would be no opportunity to sin again.\\" The executions Roderick, a priest of Cabra, Spain, executed at C√≥rdoba, Bartolom√© Esteban Perez Murillo. The forty-eight Christians (mostly monks) were martyred in C√≥rdoba, between the years 850 AD and 859 AD, being decapitated for publicly proclaiming their Christian beliefs. Dhimmis (non- Muslims living under Muslim rule) were not allowed to speak of their faith to Muslims under penalty of death. The detailed Acta of these martyrs were ascribed to the aptly named \\"Eulogius\\" (\\"blessing\\"), who was one of the last two to die. Although most of the martyrs of C√≥rdoba were Hispanic, either Baeto-Roman or Visigothic, one name is from Septimania, another Arab or Berber, and another of indeterminate nationality. There were also connections with the Orthodox East: one of the martyrs was Syrian, another an Arab or Greek monk from Palestine, and two others had distinctive Greek names. The Greek element recalls the Byzantine interlude of power in southernmost Hispania Baetica, until they were finally expelled in 554: representatives of the Byzantine Empire had been invited to help settle a Visigothic dynastic struggle, but had stayed on, as a hoped-for spearhead to a \\"Reconquest\\" of the far west envisaged by emperor Justinian I. List of martyrs The following list is from Kenneth Wolf's Christian Martyrs in Muslim Spain. =Charged with blasphemy= *Perfectus - April 18, 850. A priest in C√≥rdoba beheaded for denouncing Islam. *Isaac - June 3, 851. Born to a wealthy C√≥rdoban family, he was well educated and fluent in Arabic which helped him rise quickly to the position of exceptor rei publicae in the Moorish government. He resigned in order to become a monk at his family's monastery of T√°banos, a few miles from C√≥rdoba. One day he left his retreat and returned to the emir's palace where he proclaimed his faith in Christ in front of the court. He was arrested subsequently beheaded. *Sancho - (also known as Sanctius, Sancius) June 5, 851. Born in Albi in Septimania (modern-day France), he was taken to C√≥rdoba in Al-Andalus as a prisoner of war, educated at the royal court, and enrolled in the guards of the Emir. He was beheaded for the crime of blasphemy under unknown circumstances, just two weeks after the death of Isaac. The passio that Eulogius composed for Sanctius is unusually brief. *Peter, Walabonsus, Sabinian, Wistremundus, Habentius and Jeremiah - June 7, 851. Peter was a priest; Walabonsus, a deacon; Sabinian and Wistremundus, monks of St Zoilus in C√≥rdoba in Al-Andalus; Habentius, a monk of St Christopher's; Jeremiah, a very old man, had founded the monastery of T√°banos, near C√≥rdoba. For publicly denouncing Muhammad they were executed under Abderrahman in C√≥rdoba. Jeremiah was scourged to death; the others were beheaded. *Sisenandus - July 16, 851. Born in Beja in Portugal, he became a deacon in the church of St Acisclus in C√≥rdoba. He was beheaded under Abd ar-Rahman II. *Paul of St Zoilus - July 20, 851. A deacon in C√≥rdoba who belonged to the monastery of St Zoilus and who ministered to Christians imprisoned by the Muslims. He was beheaded; his relics are enshrined in the church of St Zoilus. *Theodemir - July 25, 851. A monk executed in C√≥rdoba in Al-Andalus under Abd ar-Rahman II. *Flora and Maria - November 24, 851. These two women were both the offspring of marriages between a Christian and a Muslim. In addition, Maria was the sister of Walabonsus, who had been executed earlier. Flora's father, who died when she was very young, was a Muslim, and so her Christianity was legally defined as apostasy. Although Maria and Flora denounced Islam and proclaimed their Christian faith in court together, Maria was executed for blasphemy and Flora for apostasy. *Gumesindus and Servusdei - January 13, 852. Gusemindus, a parish-priest, and Servusdei, a monk, were executed in Cordoba under Abd ar- Rahman II. *Leovigild and Christopher - August 20, 852. Leovigild was a monk and pastor in C√≥rdoba and Christopher a monk of the monastery of St Martin de La Rojana near C√≥rdoba. They were executed in C√≥rdoba under Abd ar-Rahman II. *Emilas and Jeremiah - September 15, 852. Two young men, the former of whom was a deacon, imprisoned and beheaded in Cordoba under the Emir Abderrahman. *Rogellus and Servus-Dei - September 16, 852. A monk and his young disciple executed in C√≥rdoba for publicly denouncing Islam inside a mosque. They were the first Christian martyrs executed under Muhammad I. *Fandilas - June 13, 853. A priest and Abbot of Pe√±amelaria near C√≥rdoba. He was beheaded in C√≥rdoba by order of Muhammad I. *Anastasius, Felix, and Digna - June 14, 853. Anastasius was a deacon of the church of St. Acisclus in C√≥rdoba, who became a monk at nearby T√°banos. Felix was born in Alcal√° of a Berber family, became a monk in Asturias but joined the monastery at T√°banos, hoping for martyrdom. Digna belonged to the convent there. *Benildis - June 15, 853. Anastasius' execution inspired this woman of Cordoba to choose martyrdom herself the next day. Her ashes were thrown into the Guadalquivir. *Columba - September 17, 853. Born in C√≥rdoba and a nun at T√°banos, she was detained with the rest of the nuns, to prevent them from giving themselves up to the courts, when the Emirate closed the monastery in 852. She escaped, openly denounced Muhammad and was beheaded. *Pomposa - September 19, 853. Another nun, from the monastery of San Salvador at Pe√±amelaria. She escaped the imprisonment of the nuns, went before the court and was executed, despite protests from her fellow nuns. *Abundius - July 11, 854. A parish priest in Ananelos, a village near C√≥rdoba. He was arrested for having maligned Muhammad. Unlike most of the other martyrs, Abundius was betrayed by others and did not volunteer to face the Emir's court. He was beheaded and his body was thrown to the dogs. His feast day is celebrated on July 11.Holweck, F. G., A Biographical Dictionary of the Saints. St. Louis, MO: B. Herder Book Co. 1924. *Amator, Peter and Louis - April 30, 855. Amator was born in Martos, near C√≥rdoba, where he was an ordained priest.

A Christian layman from Cabra, who had converted to Islam but later recanted; he was executed for apostasy. *Elias, Paul and Isidore - April 17, 856. Elias, born in Beja in Portugal and a priest in C√≥rdoba, was executed in his old age by the Moors, together with the young monks Paul and Isidore, two of his students. According to the \\"Great Synaxaristes\\", their feast day in the Orthodox Church is on April 30.

He was deprived of his office on account of his faith and became a monk. He was accused by others of having insulted the prophet Muhammad and publicly proclaimed the divinity of Jesus. Argimir was offered mercy if he renounced Christianity and professed Islam; he refused, and was executed. =Charged with apostasy= *George, Aurelius and Natalia; Sabigotho, Felix and Liliosa ‚Äì July 27 c. 852. Martyrs in C√≥rdoba under Emir Abd ar-Rahman II. Aurelius and Felix, with their wives, Natalia and Liliosa, were Iberians whose family backgrounds, although religiously mixed, legally required them to profess Islam. After given four days to recant, they were condemned as apostates for revealing their previously secret Christian faith. The deacon George was a monk from Palestine who was arrested along with the two couples. Though offered a pardon as a foreigner, he chose to denounce Islam again and die with the others. *Aurea of C√≥rdoba (also known as Aura) ‚Äì July 19, 856. Born in C√≥rdoba in Al-Andalus and a daughter of Muslim parents. She witnesses the execution of her brothers, Adolphus and John on 27 September 822 (their feast day). (Adolphus is the saint of the fictional Kingsbridge Cathedral in the epic historical novels The Pillars of the Earth and World Without End by Ken Follett.) In her widowhood she quietly became a Christian and a nun at Cuteclara, where she remained for more than 30 years. She was discovered by Muslim relatives, brought before a judge, and renounced her Christianity under duress. However, she regretted this, and continued to practice Christianity in secret. Her family brought charges against her again, and when she refused to recant her Christian faith again, was executed. *Rudericus (Roderick) and Salomon (Solomon) ‚Äì March 13, 857. Roderick was a priest in Cabra who was betrayed by his Muslim brother, who falsely accused him of converting to Islam and then returning to Christianity (i.e. apostasy). In prison he met his fellow-martyr, Salomon. They were both executed in C√≥rdoba. Eulogius and Leocritia *Eulogius of Cordoba ‚Äì March 11, 859. A prominent priest in C√≥rdoba Al-Andalus during this period. Outstanding for his courage and learning, he encouraged some of the voluntary martyrs and wrote The Memorial of the Saints for their benefit.

A young girl in C√≥rdoba. Her parents were Muslims, but she was converted to Christianity by a relative. On Eulogius's advice and with his aid, Leocritia escaped her home and went into hiding. Once found, both were arrested. Eulogius, after years of being in and out of prison and encouraging voluntary martyrdom, was executed for proselytization, and Leocritia for apostasy. *Sandila (also known as Sandalus, Sandolus, Sandulf) ‚Äì September 3 c. 855.

Early life O'Connell was born in Lisheen, County Clare, Ireland and studied at Mount St Joseph College in Cork and at Mungret College in Limerick. He emigrated to the U.S. at age 20 and entered Kenrick Seminary in St. Louis, Missouri. Career On March 30, 1963, he was ordained a priest of the Diocese of Jefferson City, Missouri. Following his ordination, he was assigned as Director of Students at St. Thomas Aquinas Preparatory Seminary in Hannibal, Missouri. He was named Spiritual Director in 1968 and was appointed Rector in 1970. He served as Director of Vocations for the Diocese of Jefferson City from 1969 to 1988. He was a member of the Diocesan Commission for Personnel and President of the Priests' Senate. He was serving as Rector of St. Thomas Aquinas Seminary when he was appointed first Bishop of the newly created Diocese of Knoxville on June 7, 1988. On September 8, 1988, O'Connell was consecrated and installed as the first bishop of Knoxville. Archbishop Pio Laghi served as Principal Consecrator with Bishop James Daniel Niedergeses and Bishop Michael Francis McAuliffe serving as principal co-consecrators. On November 12, 1998, he was appointed the third Bishop of Palm Beach, replacing J. Keith Symons, who resigned after admitting he molested five boys early in his priesthood. =Exposure of misconduct= O'Connell admitted in 2002 that he had molested at least two students of St. Thomas Aquinas Preparatory Seminary during his 25-year career there. Stephen Spalding (1953‚Äì1982) was the first known O'Connell victim and became one of three alleged victims from the graduating class of 1971. Spalding's mother reported the crime to the Diocese of Jefferson City in 1968. A Jefferson City priest, Fr. Christopher Dixon, an alumnus and faculty member of St. Thomas, revealed O'Connell's crimes in 2002. Four former students, including two identified in media reports as \\"John C.C.

Horton seceded from the M. E. Church for reasons given in their publication of the True Wesleyan. The following month Luther Lee and Lucius C. Matlack followed. The first general conference was held in Utica, NY, in October 1844. The Wesleyan Methodist Church merged with the Pilgrim Holiness Church in 1968, and became known as The Wesleyan Church. Several conferences in both merging denominations refused to be a part of the merged church over differences about modesty and worldliness (some of the conferences did not permit their members to have television sets, and required the women to have uncut hair). One of the largest conferences which refused to join the merger was the Allegheny Conference with over 100 churches. It became the Allegheny Wesleyan Methodist Connection of Churches, and most of the churches are still known as Wesleyan Methodist. Other Wesleyan Methodists who dissented with the merger organized into the Bible Methodist Connection of Churches and the Bible Methodist Connection of Tennessee.

Its boundaries, starting from the north and moving clockwise are: Mosholu Parkway to the north, Webster Avenue to the east, East 196th Street to the south, and the Jerome Reservoir (south of Sedgwick Avenue) and Goulden Avenue (Sedgwick Avenue and north) to the west. The neighborhood is part of Bronx Community District 7, and its ZIP Codes include 10458 and 10468. The area is patrolled by the 52nd Precinct of the New York City Police Department. History The area now known as Bedford Park was mostly farmland outside the town of Kingsbridge, then an unincorporated suburb of New York City. The area began to be developed with the construction of the Jerome Park Racetrack, for thoroughbred horse racing, by Leonard Jerome and August Belmont, Sr. in 1866. Jerome Park Racecourse became the first home of the famous Belmont Stakes horse race, until 1890. To attract the wealthy to the racecourse, Leonard Jerome built what is today Jerome Avenue. In 1874 the town of Kingsbridge was officially incorporated into New York City. In 1890, Jerome Park Racecourse was sold. Construction was started to convert it into the Jerome Park Reservoir, to store fresh water from the New Croton Aqueduct. At the same time, the neighborhood of Bedford Park was beginning to take shape. Forty \\"villas\\" (suburban houses) were built on a stretch, in a planned community, named Villa Avenue. The area became a part of the newly created Borough of the Bronx in 1898. The Italian and Irish immigrants who worked on the Jerome Park Reservoir project soon anchored the community there. In 1906, 200th Street was renamed Bedford Park Boulevard, likely named after Edward Thomas Bedford, a director of Standard Oil, president of the Bank of the State of New York, who was an associate of Leonard Jerome. Development continued with the completion of the Grand Concourse, a multilane thoroughfare, in 1914; and the extension of subway to the area with the IRT Jerome Avenue Line (present-day ) in 1917. The Grand Concourse saw a boom in housing construction in the post-World War I era. Much of this was from middle-class (primarily Jews, Italians, and Irish) moving from Manhattan. During the 1970s and 1980s, when widespread poverty, crime, arson, and drug use were prevalent across the Bronx, Bedford Park was not hit as hard as many other neighborhoods in the more southern parts of the borough. This was largely due to community activists and organizers taking an aggressive stance on drugs and demanding increased law enforcement in the area. Demographics Based on data from the 2010 United States Census, the population of Bedford Park was 54,415, a change of -914 (-1.7%) from the 55,329 counted in 2000. Covering an area of , the neighborhood had a population density of .Table PL-P5 NTA: Total Population and Persons Per Acre - New York City Neighborhood Tabulation Areas*, 2010, Population Division - New York City Department of City Planning, February 2012.

The entirety of Community District 7, which includes Bedford Park, Jerome Park, Fordham, Kingsbridge Heights and Norwood, had 148,163 inhabitants as of NYC Health's 2018 Community Health Profile, with an average life expectancy of 79.4 years. This is lower than the median life expectancy of 81.2 for all New York City neighborhoods. Most inhabitants are youth and middle-aged adults: 26% are between the ages of between 0‚Äì17, 31% between 25‚Äì44, and 23% between 45‚Äì64. The ratio of college-aged and elderly residents was lower, at 11% and 9% respectively. As of 2017, the median household income in Community District 7 was $35,355. In 2018, an estimated 26% of Bedford Park and Norwood residents lived in poverty, compared to 25% in all of the Bronx and 20% in all of New York City. One in seven residents (14%) were unemployed, compared to 13% in the Bronx and 9% in New York City. Rent burden, or the percentage of residents who have difficulty paying their rent, is 61% in Bedford Park and Norwood, compared to the boroughwide and citywide rates of 58% and 51% respectively. Based on this calculation, , Bedford Park and Norwood are considered low-income relative to the rest of the city and not gentrifying. =Culture= Bedford Park is home to people of many ethnicities including Korean, Indians, and Bangladeshis. Reflecting a population greatly composed of foreign-born immigrants, there are distinct ethnic enclaves in Bedford Park. Bedford Park's ethnic diversity manifests itself in an assortment of ways besides the formation of enclaves. Among the national symbols one may see strolling the neighborhood include the double-headed eagle (the emblem of Albania), the icon of Our Lady of Guadalupe (sacred to Catholic Mexicans), the shamrock of Ireland, the Arabic calligraphy of the shahadah (the Muslim profession of faith), or the coqu√≠ of Puerto Rico. A vast assortment of newspapers are sold in local convenience stores, including The Irish Echo, Albanian-language Bota Sot of Kosovo, and the Spanish-language local newspapers El Diario/La Prensa, and El Hoy. Land use and terrain Bedford Park is dominated by 5- or 6-story apartment buildings and three-story Victorian houses. The apartments on the Grand Concourse are often taller. Tracey Towers are two 41-story subsidized apartment buildings built close to the Jerome Park Reservoir. Designed by noted architect Paul Rudolph, they were completed in 1972 as a part of New York City's Mitchell Lama housing development initiative. The total land area is a little less than half a square mile. Politics In the 2016 Presidential election, most precincts in Bedford Park voted for the Democratic Party candidate, Hillary Clinton, over her Republican Party opponent Donald Trump. Bedford Park is in New York's 13th congressional district. Before redistricting in 2012, it used to be in New York's 16th district, which included the West Bronx and South Bronx; after redistricting, it includes parts of the northern Bronx and southern Westchester County.New York Redistricting, New York Times (March 20, 2012). The district is represented by Adriano Espaillat . Police and crime NYPD 52nd Precinct building at 3016 Webster Avenue Bedford Park is patrolled by the 52nd Precinct of the NYPD, located at 3016 Webster Avenue.

The area west of Grand Concourse is located within 10468, while the area east of Grand Concourse is in 10458. The United States Postal Service operates two post offices near Bedford Park: the Botanical Station at 2963 Webster Avenue and the Van Cott Station at 3102 Decatur Avenue.  Education  New York Public Library, Mosholu branch Bedford Park and Norwood generally have a lower rate of college-educated residents than the rest of the city . While 23% of residents age 25 and older have a college education or higher, 32% have less than a high school education and 45% are high school graduates or have some college education. By contrast, 26% of Bronx residents and 43% of city residents have a college education or higher.

Additionally, 70% of high school students in Bedford Park and Norwood graduate on time, lower than the citywide average of 75%. =Schools= Ursuline Convent In the 1930s, unclaimed land near the Jerome Park Reservoir offered opportunities for New Deal-related construction to alleviate unemployment from the Great Depression. Therefore, Bedford Park is home to a group of schools and a college located along the Jerome Park Reservoir, known as \\"Educational Mile.‚Äù There are three high schools there (Walton, DeWitt Clinton, and Bronx Science), along with two elementary schools and Lehman College, formerly the Bronx Campus of Hunter College. After end of World War II, in 1946 Hunter College's Bronx Campus served briefly as host of the United Nations. Currently, two of the nine specialized high schools in New York City are in the Bedford Park area, which includes Bronx High School of Science and the High School of American Studies at Lehman College. There was also a small private high school, Bedford Park Academy (founded in 1932, sold to Grace Lutheran Church in 1981), and a private Lutheran elementary school, Grace Lutheran School, which closed in 2006. The Convent of Mount St. Ursula is located on Bedford Park Boulevard and Bainbridge Avenue. It was established by a group of Roman Catholic nuns from the Ursuline order in 1892. The Academy of Mount St. Ursula High School, an all-girls prep-school, is located there today; the order is also associated with the St Philip Neri Elementary School. It recently celebrated its 150th anniversary with the class of 2005. The academy is now the oldest, all female Catholic school in New York state. One of the most notable places in the neighborhood is Lehman College, which was originally Hunter College's uptown campus. The Works Progress Administration built the original four buildings of the campus in grey stone in the Collegiate Gothic style, with finials, turrets, and other decorative features. Additional buildings, including the Lehman Library and Center for the Performing Arts, were added in the style of modern architecture. The newest building, the APEX, has facilities for athletics and dance. The scenic campus, which spans into Kingsbridge, has been used as a shooting location for episodes of the television series Law & Order and its spin-offs. =Library= The New York Public Library (NYPL) operates the Mosholu branch at 285 East 205th Street, next to Whalen Park. The branch opened in 1955 and contains two floors: a ground floor and a basement. The library host several programs, such as ESL for Non-English Speaking Adults and kids programs. The library contains a well stocked children area and brightly lit adult reading area. Religion Church of St. Philip Neri Bedford Park Presbyterian Church Among Bedford Park's oldest buildings are its churches and other religious institutions. The oldest church in the area, Bedford Park Congregational Church at the corner of Bainbridge Avenue and East 201st Street, dates to 1882. Its American Queen Anne-style design hints at Bedford Park's origin as a small rural community. It was designated a City Landmark in 2000. (New York City Landmarks Commission 2005) On the Grand Concourse lies the Roman Catholic Church of St. Philip Neri (Bronx, New York). The church was dedicated to the Italian saint due to its origin as a church for immigrant Italian laborers, who also worked on the construction of the Jerome Park Reservoir. The cornerstone of the church (dated 1899) was in fact quarried from what became Jerome Park Reservoir, and brought there by a horse-drawn carriage. (Greene 2002) When built and for many years thereafter, this parish served an Italian and Irish congregation. On June 13, 1997, the church suffered a massive fire, and was given major renovation into the mid-2000s.

Their use is controversial, especially in many European countries.National Pesticide Information Center Last updated November 21, 2013 Plant Incorporated Protectants (PIPs) / Genetically Modified Plants * RNAi pesticides, some of which are topical and some of which are absorbed by the crop. Biopesticides have usually no known function in photosynthesis, growth or other basic aspects of plant physiology. Instead, they are active against biological pests. Many chemical compounds have been identified that are produced by plants to protect them from pests so they are called antifeedants. These materials are biodegradable and renewable alternatives, which can be economical for practical use. Organic farming systems embraces this approach to pest control. = RNA = RNA interference is under study for possible use as a spray-on insecticide by multiple companies, including Monsanto, Syngenta, and Bayer. Such sprays do not modify the genome of the target plant. The RNA could be modified to maintain its effectiveness as target species evolve tolerance to the original. RNA is a relatively fragile molecule that generally degrades within days or weeks of application. Monsanto estimated costs to be on the order of $5/acre. RNAi has been used to target weeds that tolerate Monsanto's Roundup herbicide. RNAi mixed with a silicone surfactant that let the RNA molecules enter air-exchange holes in the plant's surface that disrupted the gene for tolerance, affecting it long enough to let the herbicide work. This strategy would allow the continued use of glyphosate- based herbicides, but would not per se assist a herbicide rotation strategy that relied on alternating Roundup with others. They can be made with enough precision to kill some insect species, while not harming others. Monsanto is also developing an RNA spray to kill potato beetles One challenge is to make it linger on the plant for a week, even if it's raining. The Potato beetle has become resistant to more than 60 conventional insecticides. Monsanto lobbied the U.S. EPA to exempt RNAi pesticide products from any specific regulations (beyond those that apply to all pesticides) and be exempted from rodent toxicity, allergenicity and residual environmental testing. In 2014 an EPA advisory group found little evidence of a risk to people from eating RNA. However, in 2012, the Australian Safe Food Foundation posited that the RNA trigger designed to change the starch content of wheat might interfere with the gene for a human liver enzyme. Supporters countered that RNA does not appear to make it past human saliva or stomach acids. The US National Honey Bee Advisory Board told EPA that using RNAi would put natural systems at \\"the epitome of risk\\". The beekeepers cautioned that pollinators could be hurt by unintended effects and that the genomes of many insects are still unknown. Other unassessed risks include ecological (given the need for sustained presence for herbicide and other applications) and the possible for RNA drift across species boundaries. Monsanto has invested in multiple companies for their RNA expertise, including Beeologics (for RNA that kills a parasitic mite that infests hives and for manufacturing technology) and Preceres (nanoparticle lipidoid coatings) and licensed technology from Alnylam and Tekmira. In 2012 Syngenta acquired Devgen, a European RNA partner. Startup Forrest Innovations is investigating RNAi as a solution to citrus greening disease that in 2014 caused 22 percent of oranges in Florida to fall off the trees.  Examples  Bacillus thuringiensis, a bacteria capable of causing disease of Lepidoptera, Coleoptera and Diptera, is a well-known insecticide example. The toxin from B. thuringiensis (Bt toxin) has been incorporated directly into plants through the use of genetic engineering. The use of Bt Toxin is particularly controversial. Its manufacturers claim it has little effect on other organisms, and is more environmentally friendly than synthetic pesticides. Other microbial control agents include products based on: * entomopathogenic fungi (e.g. Beauveria bassiana, Isaria fumosorosea, Lecanicillium and Metarhizium spp.), * plant disease control agents: include Trichoderma spp. and Ampelomyces quisqualis (a hyper-parasite of grape powdery mildew); Bacillus subtilis is also used to control plant pathogens. * beneficial nematodes attacking insect (e.g. Steinernema feltiae) or slug (e.g. Phasmarhabditis hermaphrodita) pests * entomopathogenic viruses (e.g.. Cydia pomonella granulovirus). * weeds and rodents have also been controlled with microbial agents. Various naturally occurring materials, including fungal and plant extracts, have been described as biopesticides. Products in this category include: * Insect pheromones and other semiochemicals * Fermentation products such as Spinosad (a macro-cyclic lactone) * Chitosan: a plant in the presence of this product will naturally induce systemic resistance (ISR) to allow the plant to defend itself against disease, pathogens and pests. * Biopesticides may include natural plant-derived products, which include alkaloids, terpenoids, phenolics and other secondary chemicals. Certain vegetable oils such as canola oil are known to have pesticidal properties. Products based on extracts of plants such as garlic have now been registered in the EU and elsewhere.  Applications  Biopesticides are biological or biologically-derived agents, that are usually applied in a manner similar to chemical pesticides, but achieve pest management in an environmentally friendly way. With all pest management products, but especially microbial agents, effective control requires appropriate formulationBurges, H.D.

(2007) Field Manual of Techniques in Invertebrate Pathology 2nd edition. Kluwer Academic, Dordrecht, NL. Biopesticides for use against crop diseases have already established themselves on a variety of crops. For example, biopesticides already play an important role in controlling downy mildew diseases. Their benefits include: a 0-Day Pre-Harvest Interval (see: maximum residue limit), the ability to use under moderate to severe disease pressure, and the ability to use as a tank mix or in a rotational program with other registered fungicides. Because some market studies estimate that as much as 20% of global fungicide sales are directed at downy mildew diseases, the integration of bio fungicides into grape production has substantial benefits in terms of extending the useful life of other fungicides, especially those in the reduced-risk category. A major growth area for biopesticides is in the area of seed treatments and soil amendments. Fungicidal and biofungicidal seed treatments are used to control soil-borne fungal pathogens that cause seed rots, damping-off, root rot and seedling blights. They can also be used to control internal seed-borne fungal pathogens as well as fungal pathogens that are on the surface of the seed. Many biofungicidal products also show capacities to stimulate plant host defense and other physiological processes that can make treated crops more resistant to a variety of biotic and abiotic stresses.  Disadvantages  * High specificity: which may require an exact identification of the pest/pathogen and the use of multiple products to be used; although this can also be an advantage in that the biopesticide is less likely to harm species other than the target * Often slow speed of action (thus making them unsuitable if a pest outbreak is an immediate threat to a crop) * Often variable efficacy due to the influences of various biotic and abiotic factors (since some biopesticides are living organisms, which bring about pest/pathogen control by multiplying within or nearby the target pest/pathogen) * Living organisms evolve and increase their resistance to biological, chemical, physical or any other form of control. If the target population is not exterminated or rendered incapable of reproduction, the surviving population can acquire a tolerance of whatever pressures are brought to bear, resulting in an evolutionary arms race. * Unintended consequences: Studies have found broad spectrum biopesticides have lethal and nonlethal risks for non-target native pollinators such as Melipona quadrifasciata in Brazil.

(5 July 1919 ‚Äì 6 May 1983) helped conceal Anne Frank and her family from Nazi persecution during the occupation of the Netherlands. In the early versions of The Diary of Anne Frank, she was given the pseudonym \\"Elli Vossen\\". Early life Bep was born in Amsterdam. She was one of the eight children of Johan Voskuijl and Christina Sodenkamp. When still a teenager, Bep worked as a chambermaid, waitress and shop assistant in order to earn money to support the large Voskuijl family. In 1937, Bep enrolled in the Amsterdam Institute Schoevers, the evening school for girls and women who wanted to learn secretarial work. Bep excelled at her courses in German, stenography and accounting. Soon after, she was hired by Otto Frank as a secretary for his company, Opekta, based at 263 Prinsengracht, the address which would become the Frank family's hiding place. She was eighteen when she started working and was the youngest employee in the office. Later, her unemployed father, who had health problems, became the Opekta warehouse supervisor. Bep became close with Otto Frank's wife Edith Holl√§nder and their daughters Margot and Anne. She also made friends with Miep Gies and got acquainted with Victor Kugler and Johannes Kleiman, all employees at Opekta who would later become helpers in the Secret Annex. Helper in the Secret Annex On Sunday 5 July 1942, Bep celebrated her 23rd birthday. The next day, when she went to work, the Frank family had already moved into the Secret Annex. For the next two years, her life was governed almost completely by her care for the people in hiding. Bep was responsible for milk and bread, and Bep's sister sewed garments such as pants and blouses for the people in hiding. She also ordered correspondence courses for those in hiding, such as shorthand and Latin. Bep was lucky to have the support of her father, who was soon informed of the Secret Annex. Johan Voskuijl kept an eye on the situation in the warehouse, as the other employees were not let in on the secret. Johan would also make sure that the waste from the hiding place disappeared unnoticed in the morning. Furthermore, in August 1942, Voskuijl built the famous bookcase that concealed the entrance to the Secret Annex. Voskuijl and his daughter discussed the Annex a lot with each other, as they kept silent to the rest of the Voskuijl family for safety reasons. Bep also managed to keep her fianc√© Bertus Hulsman ignorant for twenty-five months. She had taken him to Prinsengracht one Sunday, pretending to have to feed the cat. While she was visiting the hiders, Bertus had to wait in one of the offices, \\"otherwise he would chase away the cat\\". =Friendship with Anne Frank= Bep got on well with Anne and the feeling was mutual. In his memoirs, Otto Frank remembered about the friendship between his youngest daughter and Bep that \\"the two (...) were frequently whispering to each other in a corner\\".Anne Frank: The Untold Story. The hidden truth about Elli Vossen, the youngest helper of the Secret Annex by Jeroen De Bruyn and Joop van Wijk (Bep Voskuijl Producties, 2018) Anne considered Bep, who was ten years older, to be one of the \\"young people\\" and was very curious about Bep's experiences: the films she was seeing, but also how things were going between Bep and her fianc√©. For lunch, Bep joined the people in the Secret Annex, because at home there was not always enough to eat for ten people. In her diary Anne characterized her as follows: \\"Bep has a healthy appetite. Leaves nothing on her plate and is not picky and choosy. She is easy to please and that is just what pleases us. Cheerful and good- tempered, willing and good-natured, these are her characteristics.\\"The Diary of Anne Frank: the revised critical edition by the Netherlands State Institute for War Documentation, B-version, 9 August 1943 (New York, Doubleday, 2003) In October 1942, Anne convinced Bep to spend a night in the Secret Annex, but Bep did not sleep a wink. \\"To tell you the truth, I was terrified. Every time I heard a tree creaking in the October wind or a car driving along the canal, I grew afraid. I was grateful when morning came, and I was able to get back to work.\\"\\"Elly van Wijk kende de geheimen van het Achterhuis\\" by Bob Wallagh in Rosita magazine, 27 February 1960 During the evening of her stay, Bep had become acquainted with Anne's talent for writing, when she was given a few stories to read that Anne had come up with. In a letter to Otto Frank, she later remembered: \\"I couldn't believe what I was hearing. I could not believe that Anne had written those words. I can still see Margot's face: 'Yes, Anne wrote these all by herself.' Then I thought, you've got to be older to be able to write such a thing, or perhaps it was her inner self that came out.\\"Anne Frank: The Untold Story. The hidden truth about Elli Vossen, the youngest helper of the Secret Annex by Jeroen De Bruyn and Joop van Wijk (Bep Voskuijl Producties, 2018) Later, Anne would occasionally show Bep diary passages, although she carefully screened her notes from the eyes of the other hiders. Bep provided Anne with carbon paper she brought from the office. In addition to her care for the people in hiding, Bep also had to take care of her father. In the spring of 1943, he became seriously ill and was no longer able to work for the company. On 15 June 1943, Anne Frank wrote: \\"It is a disaster for us that good old Voskuyl won't be able to keep us in touch with all that goes on, and all he hears in the warehouse. He was our best helper and security adviser; we miss him very much indeed.\\"\\"The Diary of Anne Frank: the revised critical edition\\" by the Netherlands State Institute for War Documentation, B-version, 15 June 1943 (New York, Doubleday, 2003) =After the arrest= During the Gestapo raid, Bep managed to escape with a few documents which would have incriminated their black market contacts. She went into hiding for a week and then got back to the office, after which she entered the Secret Annex and saved parts of Anne's diaries, that were scattered over the floor. A few days earlier, Miep had already saved Anne's red-checkered diary and a few other notebooks. After World War II Bep was honored in later years for her activities during the Second World War, but disliked publicity and gave few interviews about her association with Anne Frank. However, she followed the news about Anne's diary closely and composed scrap books with newspaper articles and photo reports. In 1959, she also testified in Otto Frank's lawsuit against two Holocaust deniers in the German city of L√ºbeck. Together with Miep Gies, she gave statement to confirm that Anne had written her diary during the hiding. That same year, Bep met with queen Juliana at the Dutch premiere of the film The Diary of Anne Frank by George Stevens. In a letter to Otto Frank, Bep admitted she would much prefer to \\"distance herself from everything (...). Also, the pleasant things, such as invitations here and there, are never-racking before and after. You know, a loss for words plays the main role here. I know that you all mean well and certainly appreciate it and don't want to break with anyone in our Opekta circle. (...) I would do everything in my power to uphold the symbol of the idealized Anne, which for me (...) is combined with always thinking about what has happened, what I witnessed. This great pain never leaves my heart.\\"Anne Frank: The Untold Story. The hidden truth about Elli Vossen, the youngest helper of the Secret Annex by Jeroen De Bruyn and Joop van Wijk (Bep Voskuijl Producties, 2018) Bep kept in contact with Otto Frank even after his move to Switzerland and new marriage. Otto knew that Bep had troubles making ends meet and did his best to help her, too. He occasionally lent money to her. Bep also corresponded with Victor Kugler, who moved to Canada after the war. In 1978, she would visit him and his wife Lucy in Toronto. Bep Voskuijl died in Amsterdam on 6 May 1983, due to a traumatic aortic rupture. She was 63 years old. In an article in Dutch national newspaper De Telegraaf, Miep Gies was quoted, stating that \\"the special thing about Bep was that she was so humble. She was heroic without bravura, simply assumed that the hiders in the Annex must be helped. For her, that wasn't a difficult choice to make.\\"\\"She was Anne Frank's most trusted helper. Funeral of Elli Vossen from 'The Diary of Anne Frank by Jos van Noord, De Telegraaf, 11 May 1983 Biography In 2015, Belgian journalist Jeroen De Bruyn of the Flemish newspaper Gazet van Antwerpen and Joop van Wijk, Bep Voskuijl's youngest son, released their biography Bep Voskuijl, het zwijgen voorbij. Een biografie van de jongste helpster van het Achterhuis. They were the first ones to provide in-depth information on Bep Voskuijl's life, such as her aid to the people in the Secret Annex, her special relationship with Anne Frank and her postwar life, which was highly influenced by her war past. In Belgium and the Netherlands, the biography received much media attention, mainly because the authors claimed that Bep's sister Nelly (1923‚Äì2001) could be seen as a suspect of the betrayal of the Secret Annex. According to De Bruyn and Van Wijk, Nelly worked for the Germans during the war and had several German soldiers among her friends. She also had a relationship with an Austrian non-commissioned officer. According to Bertus Hulsman, Bep's former fianc√©, who was interviewed by the authors, Nelly knew that her father and sister hid Jews. The authors underline that Karl Silberbauer, the SS man who arrested the people of the Secret Annex, later claimed that the infamous call to the Germans was made by a female. They find it curious that Bep was strongly convinced of stockroom manager Willem van Maaren's guilt, but changed her mind when Simon Wiesenthal tracked down Silberbauer in 1963. After this period, Bep started avoiding the media. In 2018, the English version of the biography was published under the title Anne Frank: The Untold Story.

Like most S-100 machines of the era, it was built around the Zilog Z80A microprocessor, and typically ran the CP/M operating system. It was produced by North Star Computers, and it could be purchased either in kit form or pre-assembled. The introductory advertisement for the North Star Horizon computer. The price for a Z80 CPU, 16K of RAM and a single floppy drive was $1599 kit and $1899 assembled. Dual drive systems were $1999 kit and $2349 assembled. The North Star Horizon was one of the first computers to have built in floppy drives as well as being one of the first computers to have a hard disk drive. A Z80 processor board for the NorthStar Horizon An inside view of the NorthStar Horizon Specifications The computer consists of a thick aluminium chassis separated into left and right compartments with a plywood cover which sat on the top and draped over the left and right sides. (It is one of only a handful of computers to be sold in a wooden cabinet. Later versions featured an all-metal case which met safety standards.) The rear section of the compartment on the right held a linear power supply, including a large transformer and power capacitors, comprising much of the bulk and weight of the system. The empty section in front of the power supply normally housed one or two floppy disk drives, placed on their side so the slots were vertical. The compartment on the left held the S-100 motherboard, rotated so the slots ran left-right. Although a few logic circuits were on the motherboard, primarily for I/O functions, both the processor and the memory resided in separate daughterboards. Capable of running CP/M and NSDOS (North Star's proprietary Disk Operating System), a standard North Star system sported one or two hard-sectored 5.25 inch floppy disk drives and a serial interface to which one could connect a terminal to interact with it. NSDOS included North Star BASIC, a slightly non-standard dialect of BASIC, where some standard BASIC commands of the day had been changed, probably to avoid potential legal issues. Two examples of this were the EXAM and FILL commands, which took the place of the more common PEEK and POKE. The Horizon was superseded by the all-in-one North Star Advantage in 1982. The Horizon found a niche in University environments where its inbuilt S-100 bus could be used to interface it to a variety of control systems. North Star released a Hard disk version, with an internal full height 5MB MFM drive. They also released a S100 card with integrated memory and two serial ports which allowed up to eight users on one Horizon, each with their own CPU sharing the disk and other resources. This operated under TurboDOS, a multi user CP/M variant with some unix like features.

A well-collimated beam of electrons of a well defined energy (< 20 eV) is directed at the sample. These electrons couple to high-lying unoccupied electronic states and decay to low-lying unoccupied states, with a subset of these transitions being radiative. The photons emitted in the decay process are detected and an energy spectrum, photon counts vs. incident electron energy, is generated. Due to the low energy of the incident electrons, their penetration depth is only a few atomic layers, making inverse photoemission a particularly surface sensitive technique. As inverse photoemission probes the electronic states above the Fermi level of the system, it is a complementary technique to photoemission spectroscopy. Theory The energy of photons (h u, which includes Planck's constant) emitted when electrons incident on a substance using an electron beam with a constant energy (E_i) relax to a lower energy unoccupied state (E_f) is given by the conservation of energy as: :E_i=E_f+h u\\\\, By measuring E_i and h u, the unoccupied state (E_f) of the surface can be found. Modes Two modes can be used for this measurement. One is the isochromat mode, which scans the incident electron energy and keeps the detected photon energy constant. The other is the tunable photon energy mode, or spectrograph mode, which keeps the incident electron energy constant and measures the distribution of the detected photon energy. The latter can also measure the resonant inverse photoemission spectroscopy. =Isochromat mode= In isochromat mode, the incident electron energy is ramped and the emitted photons are detected at a fixed energy that is determined by the photon detector. Typically, an I2 gas filled Geiger-M√ºller tube with an entrance window of either SrF2 or CaF2 is used as the photon detector. The combination of window and filling gas determines the detected photon energy, and for I2 gas and either a SrF2 or CaF2 window, the photons energies are ~ 9.5 eV and ~ 9.7 eV, respectively. =Spectrograph mode= In spectrograph mode, the energy of the incident electron remains fixed and a grating spectrometer is used to the detect the emitted photons over a range of photon energies. A diffraction grating is used to disperse the emitted photons that are in turn detected with a two-dimensional position sensitive detector. =Comparison of modes= One advantage of spectrograph mode is the ability to acquire IPES spectra over a wide range of photon energies simultaneously. Additionally, the incident electron energy remains fixed which allows better focusing of the electron beam on the sample. Furthermore, by changing the incident electron energy the electronic structure can be studied in great detail. Although the grating spectrometer is very stable over time, the set-up can be very complex and its maintenance can be very expensive. The advantages of isochromat mode are its low cost, simple design and higher count rates.

It is located in the city of Hamilton, Ontario, Canada. It is owned and managed by Royal Botanical Gardens (RBG), a charitable organization established in 1941 by the Government of Ontario. The marsh is part of the Cootes Paradise Nature Reserve, with these lands representing 99% of the unaltered lands along the local Lake Ontario shoreline. The site is a National Historic Site, a Nationally Important Bird Area (IBA), and an Important Amphibian and Reptile Area (IMPARA). Cootes Paradise is sometimes also called the Dundas Marsh. History Cootes paradise from the hill, painted on 11 June 1796 by Elizabeth Simcoe The marsh was named for Thomas Coote, a British Army officer stationed in the Niagara area during the American Revolutionary War. The association of the marsh with Thomas Coote as a place he would visit to hunt and fish was recorded in the diary of Elizabeth Simcoe, wife of John Graves Simcoe, the first Lieutenant Governor of Upper Canada in 1796. Originally a seasonally flooded river mouth marsh feed by Spencer Creek, it provided habitat to a wide variety of lifeforms. The habitat went into decline beginning in the late 19th century as a result of water pollution, human overuse, and the introduction of carp into Lake Ontario. A developer settled with the city of Hamilton for owed taxes and the Cootes Paradise wetlands became public property in 1927. It was placed under the control of the Royal Botanical Gardens for management. By 1985, 85% of its plant cover was lost, 90% of the remainder was non-native species, and the carp population numbered over 70,000 fish. As part of ongoing efforts to reverse this ecological decline, RBG introduced Project Paradise in 1993, part of the Hamilton Harbour Remedial Action Plan. The plan focuses on removing sources of stress to the marsh by focusing attention on inflowing water pollution, minimizing the number of spawning carp, and re-establishing native plants. There are a number of identified anthropogenic stresses that have led to the unbalanced populations of carp and Canada geese. These are water quality and quantity based. Poor water clarity is a result of extremely high nutrient and sediment levels derived from sewage and urban runoff. Rapid sediment accumulation is the result of unmanaged land use patterns in the watersheds, while the regulated water level in Lake Ontario has dramatically altered the flooding pattern. Project Paradise is one of the largest wetland rehabilitation projects in North America. Controlled burns have also been conducted in an effort to restore some of the old field areas to their original Oak savanna ecosystem, a rare grouping of Carolinian plants and animals. Cootes Paradise Marsh is connected to Hamilton Harbour via the Desjardins Canal, which was dug through the wetland between 1826 and 1837 to connect Dundas, Ontario, with shipping on the Great Lakes. It was later straightened by an excavation through the Burlington Heights in 1851. In 2000, the City of Hamilton constructed a 3 km recreational trail connecting Royal Botanical Gardens to Pier 4 Park; this trail is also part of the Waterfront Trail system. Royal Botanical Gardens' trails are open to passive recreation only as the area is a National Historic site, Nationally Important Bird Area (IBA), Important Amphibian and Reptile Area (IMPARA), containing numerous endangered species. As such, activities such as biking, jogging and orienteering are against the by-laws other than on the Desjardins Trail. Birds Cootes Paradise is designated a nationally Important Bird Area (IBA) due to its strategic location at the tip of Lake Ontario and with the Central and Mississippi Flyways. As a result, hundreds of species of birds use Cootes Paradise at some point during the year, most notably during the spring and autumn migratory periods. Notable species include the least bittern, hooded warbler, white pelican, Caspian tern, black-crowned night-heron, osprey, pileated woodpecker, and the prothonotary warbler. Recently, a nesting pair of bald eagles have recolonized the marsh on the north shore of Cootes Paradise. This is the first such nest on Lake Ontario in more than 40 years. Fish The wetlands function as a seasonal fish nursery for Lake Ontario, and despite the historical degradation, most historical species of fish can still be found using the marsh in increasing numbers. As with birds and plants the location is a biodiversity hotspot for Canada with over 60 species present. Each spring thousands of spawning fish migrate in through the fishway from the harbor and lake, laying eggs and leaving shortly after, allowing the marsh to function as a giant fish hatchery. Annually between 5 and 20 million fish are produced for the lake depending on water levels and water pollution events. The species present reflect the degraded marsh habitat with the most common the gizzard shad (formerly carp). Also common are night time predators species channel catfish and brown bullhead, along with invasive species such as alewife and white perch. Popular angling species present in limited numbers include pike, largemouth bass, and yellow perch, but the large adults are only present in the marsh during the spawning season which is closed to fishing. The spring and fall season also brings several migrating salmon and trout to the marshes main inflowing river. In 2007, when there was low water level in Lake Ontario and a favorable wind, all the water was pushed out of Cootes Paradise and the remaining carp swam out into Hamilton Harbour. RBG staff removed the fish gates and herded out the last of the carp, and then replaced the gates. Since then the wetland has been relatively carp free. In the absence of these large destructive bottom feeders there is a gradual return natural native plant species populations. Reptiles Large populations of turtles inhabit Cootes Paradise, including Painted Turtles, Common Snapping Turtles, and Northern Map Turtles. Several species of snakes are also found in the area, including Northern Water Snakes. Mammals Over 30 mammal species inhabit Cootes Paradise, including white-tailed deer, red fox, raccoon, beaver, cottontail rabbit, muskrat, mink, opossum, red squirrel, coyote, southern flying squirrel, northern flying squirrel, star-nosed mole, and peculiar species such as the water vole. Plants Cootes Paradise is home to the highest concentration of plant species in Canada at over 750 native species; however, an additional 300 have also been introduced following European settlement of the area, putting strain on the local ecosystem's ability to function. Among the trees found in Cootes Paradise are various species of oak, maple, and pine, as well as less common species such as sassafras tree, Kentucky coffee tree, and tulip tree. Examples can be found along the native trees walk across from the nature centre. In recent years there has been a noticeable loss of trees due to ongoing anthropogenic stresses on the RBG property surrounding Cootes Paradise, and in 2005, following the death of a child participating on a nature hike, the RBG was forced to cut down numerous dead and dying trees that posed a public-safety concern, and alter the trail system to ensure some of the sensitive habitat could remain undisturbed by these activities. A recent analysis of the checklist of all plants growing within the various nature sanctuaries of RBG reveals that these properties are among the richest spots in Canada for plant diversity, with 24% of the flora of Canada and 38% of the flora of Ontario present. Among this diversity are multiple nationally and provincially endangered species. West of Bull's Point is an island called Hickory Island. The island was dominated by Hickory tree, but was killed by Double-crested cormorant, due to their feces being very toxic. The RBG tried to scare away them a few times with Fireworks, but they still remain on the island.

The island is about long, wide and in size. The main northbound shipping channel of the Detroit River currently lies between Bois Blanc Island and the Amherstburg mainland. A stone lighthouse was built in 1836 on the southern tip of Boblo Island which marks the historical beginning of the Detroit River navigation channel for ships traveling upriver from Lake Erie in more modern times. It is now part of the Bois Blanc Island Lighthouse and Blockhouse. Bois Blanc means \\"White Woods,\\" a name derived from the many birch and beech trees in the area. \\"Boblo\\" is an English corruption of the French pronunciation of the name. Several islands with the same name dot the Great Lakes, and nearly all are known as \\"Boblo\\" or \\"Bob-lo\\" by the local populations. The island had strategic importance when Fort Amherstburg (now Fort Malden) was built in 1796 to guard passage along the Detroit River after Detroit, Michigan was turned over to the Americans. Guns from the fort could reach the island across the navigable waters and hence secured the river. Boblo Island has a very rich history. Its association with the ancient Sauk Trail, the earliest European reference made about the island in 1718, which describes 70 First Nation families peacefully farming the fertile land, later it became the place where French Catholic had a mission for the Wyandot (Wendat) First Nation (also known as \\"the Huron Indians\\") in the 18th century, the location of the site of the headquarters for the Shawnee Chief Tecumseh (\\"Shooting Star\\") the leader of a large tribal confederacy (known as Tecumseh's Confederacy), during the War of 1812, and it was the location of the invasion point for 60 Canadian \\"Patriots\\" on January 8, 1838 during the Upper Canada Rebellion and also served as the stepping stone for numerous individuals on the Underground Railroad to Canada. One estimate puts 30,000 people as having had crossed over between 1834 and 1860. Boblo Island Amusement Park Boblo Island Detroit Dock building in Detroit in 2010 Bois Blanc is known regionally as the former home of the Boblo Island Amusement Park, which began operation in 1898 and closed on September 30, 1993. The Nightmare (ride), Falling Star, Wild Mouse, Sky Streak and Screamer were the signature rides. A parking stub from Boblo Island, 1988 For more than 85 years, the park was serviced by SS Ste. Clair and . The Boblo Island Amusement Park was famous for those two steamers, which went between Detroit and the island. A lawsuit concerning the power of the state of Michigan to prohibit racial discrimination on the ferries, Bob-Lo Excursion Co. v. Michigan, 333 U.S. 28 (1948), reached the U.S. Supreme Court and resulted in a notable decision construing the Commerce Clause. During the Vietnam War, when Canada had become a safe haven for those who refused to be drafted into the U.S. Army, Boblo Island became an efficient transit point for Americans who sought refuge from prosecution. Those seeking to pass into Canada would take the boat from Detroit to Boblo and, upon arrival, would trade their return tickets with persons who had arrived on the island from Amherstburg. Those who had come from Canada took the return trip to Detroit, and those who had come from Detroit took the return trip to Amherstburg, thus arriving in Canada without having to pass through customs at the border. Today The island is currently being developed as Boblo Island and Marina Resort Community by Amico Properties Limited. Boblo Island now has a community of homes and condominiums. The island is served by a private ferry. Temporary alterations of both of the steamsers, Columbia and Ste. Clair, was made for the 2014 feature film Transformers: Age of Extinction. Ste. Clair was completely destroyed in a fire while docked on the Detroit River on July 6, 2018. The fire could not be contained and it was declared a total loss. The future of the hull is currently unknown. See also * Jesuit missions in North America References Further reading * Carlisle, annesla.

It is a benzylidene camphor derivative, many of which are known for their excellent photostability. Although there are a few different UV absorbers with the trade name Mexoryl, only two of them are widely used where approved. Mexoryl SX (water-soluble) and Mexoryl XL (INCI Drometrizole trisiloxane, oil-soluble). Together they show a synergistic effect in protection. The patents are held by L'Or√©al. Sunscreens containing ecamsule are exclusive to L'Or√©al and its brands. Mode of action Exposed to UV, ecamsule undergoes reversible photoisomerization, followed by photoexcitation. The absorbed UV is then released as thermal energy, without penetrating the skin. UVB rays cause short-term sunburn and skin cancer; UVA rays cause wrinkling and may have some role in development of skin cancer. There is no official rating for UVA protection in the US. In Europe, there are several different rating systems that are used to measure effectiveness in blocking UVA rays, including the IPD (immediate pigment darkening assay) and the PPD (persistent pigment darkening assay). The UVB range is 280 to 320 nanometers, and the UVA range is 320 to 400. Ecamsule protects against UV wavelengths in the 290‚Äì400 nanometer range, with peak protection at 345 nm. Since ecamsule doesn't cover the entire UV spectrum, it should be combined with other active sunscreen agents to ensure broad-spectrum UV protection. Ecamsule is a photostable organic UVA absorber, meaning it doesn't degrade significantly when exposed to light. This is in contrast to the widely used UVA absorber avobenzone that is not intrinsically photostable and requires photostabilizers to prevent significant degradation in light.Image:Free text.png Efficacy A 5% ecamsule containing sunscreen can prevent early changes leading to photoaging in humans. A broad spectrum sunscreen with ecamsule, avobenzone and octocrylene significantly reduces the skin damage associated with UV exposure in human subjects. In studies done in mice it reduces the formation of UV induced pyrimidine dimers and delays the onset of skin cancer. In vitro ecamsule effectively protects against the harmful effects of UV. Safety Ecamsule has little percutaneous absorption and little systemic effects, therefore it is considered relatively safe. A mouse study shows that it does not increase the probability of promoting skin cancer. Studies done in vitro show that it is not photomutagenic. Because ecamsule is an acid it needs to be neutralized in order to be used without offsetting the final pH of the sunscreen too much. Usually this is done with triethanolamine. Availability L'Or√©al patented ecamsule first in 1982. It was approved in the EU in 1991. Sunscreens based on ecamsule have been available in Europe, Canada and other parts of the world since 1993. Ecamsule was given approval by the FDA in 2006 to be used in the U.S. However this approval only extends to ecamsule containing sunscreens registered under a New Drug Application, not ecamsule itself.

Barak was President of the Supreme Court of Israel from 1995 to 2006. Prior to that, he served as a Justice of the Supreme Court of Israel (1978‚Äì95), as the Attorney General of Israel (1975‚Äì78), and as the Dean of the Law Faculty of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem (1974‚Äì75). Biography =Early life and family= Aharon Barak was born in Kaunas, Lithuania, the only son of Zvi Brick, an attorney, and his wife Leah, a teacher. After the Nazi occupation of the city in 1941, the family spent three years in the Kovno ghetto. At the end of the war, after wandering through Hungary, Austria, and Italy, Barak and his parents reached Rome, where they spent the next two years. In 1947, they received travel papers and immigrated to Palestine. After a brief period on a moshav, the family settled in Jerusalem. He studied law, international relations and economics at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, and obtained his Bachelor of Laws in 1958. Between 1958 and 1960, having been drafted into the Israeli Defense Forces, he served in the office of the Financial Advisor to the Chief of Staff. Upon discharging his service he returned to the Hebrew University, where he completed his doctoral dissertation with distinction in 1963. Simultaneously he began work as an intern at the Attorney General's office. When the Attorney General began dealing with the trial of Adolf Eichmann, Barak, being a Holocaust survivor, preferred not to be involved in the work. He was transferred to the State Attorney's office to complete his internship at his request. Upon completing his internship he was recognised as a certified attorney. Barak is married to Elisheva Barak-Ussoskin, former vice president of the National Labor Court, with whom he has three daughters and a son, all trained in the law. =Academic career= Between 1966 and 1967 Barak studied at Harvard University. In 1968 he was appointed as a professor at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, and in 1974 was named the Dean of its Law Faculty. In 1975, at age 38, he was awarded the Israel Prize for legal research. In the same year he became a member of the Israel Academy of Sciences and Humanities. In 1978 he became a foreign member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. =Attorney General of Israel= Between 1975 and 1978, Barak served as the Attorney General of Israel. Among his well-known decisions in this capacity were: * The decision to launch a criminal investigation against Asher Yadlin, CEO of Clalit Health Services and a nominee for the position of director of the Bank of Israel. Yadlin was convicted of accepting a bribe and sentenced to 5 years imprisonment. During this incident Barak coined the so-called Buzaglo test. * The decision to continue with the police investigation of Housing and Construction Minister Avraham Ofer, despite the Minister's request that the investigation be terminated. Ofer committed suicide in 1977, prior to the conclusion of the investigation. * The decision to prosecute Leah Rabin due to the Dollar Account affair. This decision brought about the resignation of the Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin. In justifying his decision not to prosecute Yitzhak Rabin for the affair, Barak has argued that \\"Rabin was severely punished in that he was forced to resign from his position. There was no room to punish him further.\\" Barak (sitting; left) at a meeting at Camp David with (l-r) Menachem Begin, Anwar Sadat, and Ezer Weizmann, 1978 Barak was appointed by Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin in 1978 as the legal advisor to the Israeli delegation for negotiating the Camp David Accords. In his book Palestine: Peace Not Apartheid, Jimmy Carter praises Barak as a negotiator despite the political disagreements between them. =Supreme Court of Israel= On 22 September 1978, Barak began his service as a Justice of the Supreme Court of Israel ‚Äì the youngest of all of the judges. In 1982‚Äì83 he served as a member of the Kahan Commission, a state investigation committee formed to investigate the circumstances surrounding the Sabra and Shatila massacre. As part of the committee's conclusions, then Minister of Defense Ariel Sharon was removed from his position. The committee further recommended that he never be appointed to that position again in the future. In 1993, with the retirement of the Deputy President of the Supreme Court Menachem Elon, Barak was appointed the Deputy President. Subsequently, with the retirement of the President Meir Shamgar on 13 August 1995, Barak was appointed the President of the Supreme Court. In the course of his service on the Supreme Court Barak greatly expanded the range of issues with which the court dealt. mirror He canceled the standing test which Israel's Supreme Court had used frequently, and greatly expanded the scope of justiciability by allowing petitions on a range of matters. Professor Daphna Barak-Erez commented that: > One of the most significant impacts of Judge Barak on Israeli law is found > in the change which he led with regard to all matters of justiciability. > Judge Barak was the instigator and leader of the outlook which regards the > traditional doctrine of justiciability as inappropriately and unnecessarily > limiting the matters which the court deals with. Under the leadership of > Judge Barak, the Supreme Court significantly increased the [range of] fields > in which it is [willing to intervene]. Simultaneously, he advanced a number of standards, both for public administration (mainly, the standard of the reasonableness of the administrative decision) and in the private sector (the standard of good faith), while blurring the distinction between the two. Barak's critics have argued that, in doing so, the Supreme Court under his leadership harmed judicial consistency and stability, particularly in the private sector. Since 1992, much of his judicial work was focused on advancing and shaping Israel's Constitutional Revolution (a phrase which he coined), which he believed was brought about by the adoption of Basic Laws in the Israeli Knesset dealing with human rights. According to Barak's approach, which was adopted by the Supreme Court, the Constitutional Revolution brought values such as the Right to Equality, Freedom of Employment and Freedom of Speech to a position of normative supremacy, and thereby granted the courts (not just the Supreme Court) the ability to strike down legislation which is inconsistent with the rights embodied in the Basic Laws. Consequently, Barak held that the State of Israel has been transformed from a parliamentary democracy to a constitutional parliamentary democracy, in that its Basic Laws were to be interpreted as its constitution. During his time as President of the Supreme Court, Barak advanced a judicial activist approach, whereby the court was not required to limit itself to judicial interpretation, but rather was permitted to fill the gaps in the law through judicial legislation at common law. This approach was highly controversial and was met with much opposition, including by some politicians. The Israeli legal commentator Ze'ev Segal wrote in a 2004 article, \\"Barak sees the Supreme Court as a [force for societal change], far beyond the primary role as a decisor in disputes. The Supreme Court under his leadership is fulfilling a central role in the shaping of Israeli law, not much less than [the role of] the Knesset. Barak is the leading power in the court, as a key judge in it for a quarter of a century, and as the number 1 judge for some 10 years now.\\" On 14 September 2006, upon reaching the mandatory age, Barak retired from the Supreme Court. Three months later he published his final judgments, among them a number of precedents regarding damages in tort for residents of the Palestinian territories, Israel's policy of targeted killing, and preferential treatment for IDF veterans. Parallel to his service in the Supreme Court, Barak also served as the head of a committee which, for some twenty years, drafted the Israeli Civil Codex, which worked to unite the 24 main civil law statutes in Israeli law under a single comprehensive law. =Resumption of academic career= After his retirement from the Supreme Court, Barak joined the staff of the Interdisciplinary Center in Herzliya, and he teaches in the master's degree program for Commercial Law. He also lectures in the Bachelor of Laws program. In addition, he continues to lecture at both the Yale Law School and the University of Alabama in the United States, as well as lecturing as a Distinguished Visitor at the University of Toronto Faculty of Law. Important judgments Barak's portrait at Supreme Court of Israel * CA 6821/93 United Hamizrahi Bank Ltd. v. Migdal Kfar Shitufi 49(4) P.D 221: The judgment in which Barak, together with other judges, described the Constitutional Revolution as he understood it, which began following the legislation of Basic Law: Human Dignity and Liberty and Basic Law: Freedom of Employment. In this case it was held that the Supreme Court could strike down Knesset legislation which is inconsistent with these Basic Laws. * CA 243/83 The Jerusalem Municipality v. Gordon, 39(1) P.D 113: In this judgment Barak reformed key aspects of Israeli tort law. * HC 3269/95 Katz v. Regional Rabbinical Court, 50(4) P.D 590: In this judgment Barak held, sitting as Deputy President to Meir Shamgar, that the laws pertaining to property disputes arising from divorce are not caused by the act of marriage and thus are not to be regarded as matters of marriage. Rather, they derive from an agreement between the parties and are an aspect of the freedom of association. This case established that the Israeli Rabbinical courts must apply the doctrine of joint matrimonial property, a doctrine based in Israeli common law rather than the Halakha (Jewish religious law). * CA 4628/93 State of Israel v. Guardian of Housing and Initiatives (1991) Ltd., 49(2) P.D 265: In this judgment Barak proposed a new approach to contract construction, holding that a lot of weight should be given to the circumstances which led to the formation of the contract. Some aspects of Barak's views in this regard remain controversial, but his general approach to contract construction is today accepted by the Supreme Court. * CA 165/82 Kibbutz Hatzor v Assessing Officer, 39(2) P.D 70: This judgment was a turning point in the interpretation of tax law in Israel, in establishing that a purposive approach was generally preferred to textualism in determining the meaning of the law. * FH 40/80 Koenig v. Cohen, 36(3) P.D 701: In this judgment Barak, in the minority, expounded upon his approach to interpreting legislation. Today this approach has become an acceptable approach to statutory interpretation. * CA 817/79, Kossoy v. Y.L. Feuchtwanger Bank Ltd., 38(3) P.D 253: In this judgment Barak imposed a duty of fairness upon one who controls a company, holding that one who controls a company cannot sell his shares of the company when as a consequence of doing so the company, and thus its shareholders, would be harmed. Impact, praise and criticism Barak's decisions as President of the Supreme Court impacted many aspects of life in Israel, and were the subject of both praise and criticism. Barak championed a proactive judiciary that has interpreted Israel's Basic Law as its constitution, and challenged Israeli parliament (Knesset) laws on that basis. Two of his books on legal commentary have been translated to English. Following his retirement from the Supreme Court, the new President of the Court, Judge Dorit Beinisch, said at his farewell ceremony: > At the heart of the development of the law of Israel stands Aharon Barak. He > opened new horizons. The law as it stands after his [Presidency] differs in > its purpose from the era which preceded him. Since his first year in the > Supreme Court his rulings were groundbreaking, since '78 and until today he > set the central legal norms that this court granted Israeli society. On the issue of the substantial expansion of the right of standing and the test of reasonableness of an administrative decision (which grants the courts the power to overrule an administrative decision if the judge is convinced that it does not \\"stand [within the] bounds of reasonableness\\"), Amnon Rubinstein wrote: > Thus a situation has arisen whereby the Supreme Court may convene and decide > on every conceivable issue. In addition to that the unreasonableness of an > administrative decision will be grounds for judicial intervention. This was > a total revolution in the judicial thinking which characterized the Supreme > Court of previous generations, and this has given it the reputation of the > most activist court in the world, causing both admiration and criticism. In > practice, in many respects the Supreme Court under Barak has become an > alternate government. Among critics of Barak's judicial activism are former President of the Supreme Court of Israel Moshe Landau, Ruth Gavison, and Richard Posner. Posner, a judge on the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit and authority on jurisprudence, criticised Barak's decision to interpret the Basic Laws as Israel's constitution, stating that \\"only in Israel ... do judges confer the power of abstract review on themselves, without benefit of a constitutional or legislative provision.\\" He also argues that Barak's idea of the courts enforcing a set of rights which they find in \\"substantive\\" democracy, rather than merely democratic political rights, actually involves a curtailing of democracy and results in a \\"hyperactive judiciary.\\" Furthermore, he claims that Barak's approach to the interpretation of statutes involves, in practice, interpretation in the context of the judge's own personal ideal system, and \\"opens up a vast realm for discretionary judgment\\", rather than providing for an objective interpretation of the statute. He is also critical of Barak's view of the separation of powers, arguing that, in effect, it is that \\"judicial power is unlimited and the legislature cannot remove judges.\\" He also asserts that Barak fails to apply his own judicial philosophy in practice at times. Nevertheless, Posner said that \\"Barak himself is by all accounts brilliant, as well as austere and high-minded ‚Äì Israel's Cato\\", and that while he would not regard Barak's judicial approach as a desirable universal model, it may be suited to Israel's specific circumstances. He also suggested that if there were a Nobel prize for law, Barak would likely be among its early recipients. Beyond the legal community, on both the left and right of the political spectrum, there are those who were highly critical of Barak. His judgments on matters of security, in particular, have been subject to criticism by some on both the left and the right. Barak is a secular Jew but believes in compromise with the religious sector, and state support for religion. His judgments on the interaction between religion and state have led to hostility towards him by some in the religious public. Religious Jews from all sectors of society (including both Haredim and Religious Zionists) held a mass protest against the Supreme Court under his presidency, after the Supreme Court ruled that in cases of divorce the Israeli religious courts of law are required to decide property disputes according to the law of the Knesset rather than according to the Halakha.

The island covers about and is about 12 miles (19 km) long, 6 miles (9.6 km) wide and has 6 lakes. It lies southeast of Mackinac Island and almost due north of the city of Cheboygan. \\"Bois Blanc\\" is French for \\"white wood\\". The name is commonly thought to be a reference to either: (a) the paper birch, or more likely (b) the basswood, called \\"bois blanc\\" in other contexts. The basswood's white underbark was extensively used by Native Americans and French-speaking fur traders for cordage, including the sewing up of canoes and the manufacture of webbing for snowshoes. The French Canadian colloquial term for \\"inner bark\\" was bois blanc. The Native Americans themselves had a name for Bois Blanc Island and the meaning is the same as the Canadian name. It was called Wigobiminiss. Wigobi or wicopy signifies \\"tying bark\\" or \\"inner bark\\". Miniss means \\"island\\". \\"Boblo\\" is an English corruption of the French pronunciation of the name. Several islands with the same name dot the Great Lakes, and nearly all are known as \\"Boblo\\" or \\"Bob-lo\\" by the local populations. History Bois Blanc was ceded by the local Anishinaabe (Chippewa) as \\"an extra and voluntary gift\\" to the U.S. federal government with the Treaty of Greenville in 1795. The cession for the area, Article 3, item 13 of the treaty states: \\"The post of Michilimackinac, and all the land on the island on which that post stands, and the main land adjacent, of which the Indian title has been extinguished by gifts or grants to the French or English governments; and a piece of land on the main to the north of the island, to measure six miles, on lake Huron, or the strait between lakes Huron and Michigan, and to extend three miles back from the water of the lake or strait; and also, the Island De Bois Blane, being an extra and voluntary gift of the Chippewa nation.\\"Treaty of Greenville The treaty ceded most of Ohio and a slice of Indiana to the government, as well as sixteen strategic sites well within Indian territory, on waterways in the future states of Michigan, Ohio, Indiana and Illinois. During the War of 1812, U.S. Navy Captain Arthur Sinclair's fleet took shelter at the island while waiting to attack the British at Fort Mackinac. In 1880 the island provided a haven to alleged murderer Henry English who escaped from Pennsylvania authorities before his trial. He was apprehended on Bois Blanc by Pinkerton agents, returned to Pennsylvania and acquitted. In 1827, the United States mapped the island. The United States Life Saving Service established a life-saving station at Walker's Point in 1890. A few years earlierBois Blanc Island Historical Society the Pointe Aux Pins Association was formed. After extensive use as a source of kilned lime and firewood for Mackinac Island and other local frontier settlements, Bois Blanc was settled in the late 19th century as a summer resort community. In 1908, on behalf of the association, President Walter B. Webb hired the Mason L. Brown Company, a Detroit surveying firm, to map and record the Pointe Aux Pins subdivision. Pointe Aux Pins was the first resort community on the island. Much of Bois Blanc Island is state-owned forest land containing White and Norway pines that tower tall. As recently as the 1950s, Bois Blanc provided lumber to Mackinac Island where woodcutting is prohibited. Bois Blanc Island was without electric service until 1964, when the Presque Isle Electric & Gas Co-Op completed a project to install a continuous 3.7-mile underwater cable from Point Nipigon to Bois Blanc. At that time, there were approximately 200 structures on the island. An electric service upgrade in 1999 replaced the original cable with two submarine cables spanning the Straits of Mackinac. Transportation Private and commercial motor vehicles are brought to and from Bois Blanc Island by ferry. There are no paved roads; however, a maintained county road extends from the island's northeast corner to the far western tip. Fire Tower Road bisects the island and is also the route used for public access to Twin Lakes and Lake Thompson, Bois Blanc's largest inland lakes. There are numerous un-maintained roads and trails. Plaunt Transportation is the sole provider of ferry services for the island. Ferries are sailed daily when the straits are not frozen over from Cheboygan to Pointe Aux Pins. Kristen D is a ferry which operates between Cheboygan and Bois Blanc Island. The ferry can accommodate up to 16 vehicles. The island is served by Bois Blanc Island Airport, a paved landing strip located on the island (Airport Code 6Y1, elev. 664')./Michigan Airport Directory - Bois Blanc During some winters, an ice road is marked by cut evergreen trees, allowing travel over the ice between the island and the mainland.

He is best known for his research regarding UFOs. McDonald was senior physicist at the Institute for Atmospheric Physics and professor in the Department of Meteorology, University of Arizona, Tucson. McDonald campaigned in support of expanding UFO studies during the mid and late 1960s, arguing that UFOs represented an important unsolved mystery which had not been adequately studied by science. He was one of the more prominent figures of his time who argued in favor of the extraterrestrial hypothesis as a plausible, but not completely proved, model of UFO phenomena. McDonald interviewed over 500 UFO witnesses, uncovered many important government UFO documents, and gave presentations of UFO evidence. He testified before Congress during the UFO hearings of 1968. McDonald also gave a famous talk called \\"Science in Default\\" to the American Association for the Advancement of Science (AAAS). It was a summary of the current UFO evidence and a critique of the 1969 Condon Report UFO study.  Early life and career  McDonald was born and raised in Duluth, Minnesota. He served as a cryptographer in the United States Navy during World War II, and afterwards, married Betsy Hunt; they had six children. McDonald studied at the University of Omaha, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and earned his Ph.D. at Iowa State University. He taught at the University of Chicago for a year, then in 1953, he was invited to help establish a meteorology and atmospherics program at the University of Arizona as a professor of meteorology. McDonald eventually became the head of the Institute of Atmospheric Physics, but resigned as its administrator after about a year because he preferred to teach and research rather than oversee the department. He taught courses from introductory to graduate levels, received good evaluations, and was fondly regarded by his students. His specialty was cloud formation and physics, but his natural curiosity led him to read widely in many other scientific fields. McDonald was a widely recognized authority of atmospheric phenomena: he published many articles in peer reviewed journals, and contributed to several standard meteorology textbooks. He was a member of the National Academy of Sciences and the American Meteorological Society. McDonald was one of many experts who testified before congress in the 1960s against the development of supersonic transport airplanes, for fear that they would damage the ozone layer. Most of McDonald's life is known through the authorized biography Firestorm: Dr. James E. McDonald's Fight For UFO Science (2003) by Ann Druffel.  UFO studies  In 1954, while driving through the Arizona desert with two meteorologists, McDonald spotted an unidentified flying object none of the men could readily identify. Though a rather unspectacular sighting of a distant point of light, this sighting would spur McDonald's interest in UFOs. By the late 1950s he was quietly investigating UFO reports in Arizona, and he had also joined NICAP, then the largest and most prominent civilian UFO research group in the nation. Given his training in atmospheric physics, McDonald was able to examine UFO reports in greater detail than most other scientists, and was able to offer explanations for some previously unexplained reports. Using his security clearance with the US government, he also uncovered a number of well-documented UFO reports from the US Air Force's Project Blue Book, which he judged deeply puzzling even after stringent analysis. By the mid-1960s, McDonald began speaking about UFOs more openly. McDonald's first detailed, public discussion of UFOs was in a lecture given before an American Meteorological Society assembly in Washington D.C. on October 5, 1966. Entitled \\"The Problem of UFOs\\", McDonald's speech was the first of many given to an overflow audience. McDonald declared that scientific scrutiny should be directed towards the small number of \\"unknowns\\", which he defined as a UFO reported by a \\"credible and trained observer as machine-like 'craft' which remained unidentified in spite of careful investigation.\\" He noted that the vast majority of UFOs could become Identified flying objects, and, in his estimation, only about 1% of UFOs were true \\"unknowns\\". McDonald also lambasted the U.S. Air Force for what he saw as their inept handling of UFO studies. In 1967 the Office of Naval Research granted McDonald a small budget in order to conduct his own UFO research, ostensibly to study the idea that some UFOs were misidentified clouds. He was able to peruse the files of Project Blue Book at Wright Patterson Air Force Base, and eventually concluded that the Air Force was mishandling UFO evidence. Following the Robertson Panel's recommendations in 1953, the Air Force was following a debunking directive towards UFO reports, and only discussing UFO cases which were considered solved by a mundane explanation. All unexplained UFO cases were classified \\"secret\\" and not released to the public (see Robertson Panel for further information). McDonald was particularly disturbed that astronomer J. Allen Hynek, had not alerted the scientific community to the fact that Project Blue Book was withholding some of the most anomalous and compelling UFO reports. Hynek argued that if he had exposed this, the Air Force would have dumped him as Blue Book's consultant; Hynek was the only scientist formally studying UFOs for the government. This was the beginning of a rift between the two men that would never be entirely reconciled. From the mid-1960s, McDonald devoted much of his time to trying to persuade journalists, politicians and his colleagues that UFOs were the most pressing issue facing American science. He gave dozens of lectures, and wrote volumes of letters to newspapers, to his peers (especially at scientific journals) and to politicians. McDonald wrote to the Air Force Office of Scientific Research, arguing that they needed to radically shift what he saw as their superficial perspective towards UFOs. In response, the Air Force determined that they needed to \\"fireproof\\" themselves against McDonald's statements because of his unquestionable qualifications and credibility. He managed to secure limited support from a few prominent figures, such as United Nations Secretary General U Thant, who arranged for McDonald to speak to the UN's Outer Space Affairs Group on June 7, 1967. Additionally in 1967, McDonald noted, \\"There is no sensible alternative to the utterly shocking hypothesis that UFOs are extraterrestrial probes\\". In his Statement on Unidentified Objects to the House Committee on Science and Astronautics, McDonald made the following remarks regarding types of UFO accounts. :The scope of the present statement precludes anything approaching an exhaustive listing of categories of UFO phenomena: much of what might be made clear at great length will have to be compressed into my remark that the scientific world at large is in for a shock when it becomes aware of the astonishing nature of the UFO phenomenon and its bewildering complexity. I make that terse comment well aware that it invites easy ridicule; but intellectual honesty demands that I make clear that my two years' study convinces me that in the UFO problem lie scientific and technological questions that will challenge the ability of the world's outstanding scientists to explain - as soon as they start examining the facts.McDonald, James. E. (1968). Statement on Unidentified Flying Objects submitted to the House Committee on Science and Astronautics at July 29, 1968, Symposium on Unidentified Flying Objects, Rayburn Bldg., Washington, D.D. In the same statement, he said he had \\"become convinced that the scientific community ... has been casually ignoring as nonsense a matter of extraordinary scientific importance.\\" McDonald often used guarded wording in his discussions of the extraterrestrial hypothesis, such as once describing the extraterrestrial hypothesis as the \\"least unsatisfactory\\" explanation for UFOs. He seemed to regard the extraterrestrial hypothesis not as unimpeachable fact, but as a working model. McDonald's acquaintance George Early, a prominent engineer with the United Aircraft Association and also a NICAP member, said, \\"I don't think Jim was 100% sold on the UFOs being extraterrestrial spacecraft with beings in them ... His essential thrust was that here is a topic worthy of scientific study which has not been studied scientifically, and we should find out what the answer is. He had a definite commitment to the truth, and if the truth turned out to be something else [other than the extraterrestrial hypothesis], he wouldn't have backed away from it\\". = The Condon Committee Controversy = Following a widely publicized series of mass UFO sightings in southern Michigan in 1966, McDonald became one of several scientists to urge various authorities in the federal government and scientific community to undertake a formal study of UFOs. This public pressure, combined with pressure from some members of Congress (such as then-Congressman Gerald Ford), led the federal government to create the Condon Committee in late 1966. Based at the University of Colorado at Boulder, and named after Committee Chairman Dr. Edward Condon, a prominent physicist, the committee was advertised as an unbiased, objective, and thorough investigation into the UFO phenomenon. Initially, McDonald shared the early general enthusiasm towards the Condon Committee, and given his scientific credentials and interest in UFOs he offered to serve on the committee. When he was denied a position on the committee, McDonald still agreed to assist in other ways with the committee's work. However, McDonald and other UFO researchers soon became disillusioned with the committee, and in particular with its chairman, Dr. Condon, and his chief assistant, Dr. Robert Low. Condon's public comments to reporters ridiculing UFO eyewitnesses and his generally dismissive attitude towards the subject led many UFO researchers to doubt whether the investigation would be as neutral and unbiased as it proclaimed. McDonald formed alliances with those on the Condon Committee who disagreed with Condon's leadership and who wanted to undertake long-term UFO studies. McDonald played a major role in the controversy regarding the Condon Committee when one of the committee's investigators - who disagreed with Condon's attitudes - privately gave him a copy of the so-called \\"Trick Memo\\". The memorandum, which was written by Condon's chief assistant Dr. Robert Low, outlined how the Committee could reach a predetermined conclusion that all UFO cases were explainable in mundane terms, while simultaneously appearing neutral during the actual investigation process. The \\"Trick Memo\\" seemed to confirm his worst fears about the Condon Committee's bias regarding the UFO phenomenon. Following McDonald's release to the public of the now-infamous \\"Trick Memo\\", Project Chair Edward Condon tried unsuccessfully to get McDonald fired from his tenured faculty position at the University of Arizona. When the Condon Committee issued its final report in 1969, Dr. Condon wrote in the foreword to the report that, based on the committee's investigations, his conclusion was that there was nothing unusual about UFO reports; thus further scientific research into the UFO phenomenon was not worthwhile and should be discouraged. Condon's conclusions about UFOs were generally accepted by most scientists and the \\"mainstream\\" news media. McDonald, however, became one of a small number of scientists and researchers who wrote detailed critiques and rebuttals of Condon's conclusions regarding UFOs. McDonald was particularly disturbed by the fact that, while Condon in his foreword had claimed that all UFO reports could be explained as hoaxes or misidentifications of manmade or natural objects or phenomena, the Report itself actually listed over 30% of the cases it investigated as \\"unexplained\\". = Conflict with Philip Klass = McDonald engaged in an often adversarial relationship with aviation journalist and skeptic Philip J. Klass, who argued in his first book that nearly all UFOs can be explained by ball lightning. At first, the duo exchanged cordial letters on the subject. Klass was rather guarded in his application of the plasma theory at the time, and McDonald agreed that it might explain a small portion of UFO reports. However, Klass quickly expanded his hypothesis arguing that most if not all UFOs, and even cases of alleged alien abduction, could be explained as plasmas. McDonald thought this was absurd, and offered a detailed rebuttal against Klass's thesis.see Clark, 1998 In late 1967, McDonald secured a modest grant from the Office of Naval Research in order to study cloud formations in Australia. While in Australia, McDonald conducted some UFO research on his own time. Klass mounted an extended, concerted campaign against McDonald, arguing that he had squandered government funds. The ONR responded by announcing that they knew of McDonald's UFO interests and had no objections to his personal hobbies. The University of Arizona came to McDonald's defense, announcing that McDonald's UFO research was done on his own time, and had no adverse impact on his regular teaching and research duties at the university. Klass then demonstrated that McDonald was spending at least small sums of government research funds on UFO research, and the ONR, apparently fearing controversy, decided to no longer fund McDonald's cloud research. = 1968: Congressional UFO testimony = McDonald spoke before the United States Congress for a UFO hearing in 1968. In part, he stated his opinion that \\"UFOs are entirely real and we do not know what they are, because we have laughed them out of court. The possibility that these are extraterrestrial devices, that we are dealing with surveillance from some advanced technology, is a possibility I take very seriously\\". McDonald emphasized that he accepted the extraterrestrial hypothesis as a possibility not due to any specific evidence in its favor, but because he judged competing hypotheses as inadequate. James McDonald did not accept the conclusions of the Condon Report because 30% of the cases studied in the report remained unexplained. The evidence provided in the final report could have substantiated the opposite conclusion (that UFOs warranted much more scientific study) rather than the official conclusion, which was to recommend no further study. Firestorm, a biography of McDonald by UFO researcher Ann Druffel, gives a detailed account of McDonald's tireless efforts promoting scientific UFO research. = 1969: \\"Science in Default\\" = In 1969, McDonald was a speaker at an American Association for the Advancement of Science UFO symposium. There he delivered a lecture, \\"Science in Default\\", which Jerome Clark calls \\"one of the most powerful scientific defenses of UFO reality ever mounted\\". McDonald discussed in detail a handful of well documented UFO cases which seemed, he thought, to defy interpretation by conventional science.  Late life and death  McDonald's UFO efforts were exacting a toll: he was becoming professionally isolated, and his marriage was faltering. Beyond Klass and Condon, McDonald butted heads with many other prominent figures, including Donald H. Menzel of Harvard University. McDonald's personality may have been a factor in these confrontations; even his friends described him as sometimes forceful and impatient, while others, less charitably, called him blunt and abrasive. Additionally, McDonald suffered a public humiliation when in 1970, he agreed to appear before a committee of the United States Congress to provide evidence against the development of the supersonic transport (SST) plane. Like many other atmospheric physicists who testified with him, McDonald was convinced that the plane could potentially harm the Earth's vital but fragile ozone layer. During his testimony Congressman Silvio O. Conte of Massachusetts ‚Äî whose district contained factories that would help build the SST ‚Äî tried to discredit McDonald's SST testimony by switching the hearing to a discussion of McDonald's UFO research. Although McDonald defended his UFO work and noted that his evidence regarding the SST had nothing to do with UFOs, Conte bluntly stated that anyone who \\"believes in little green men\\" was, in his opinion, not a credible witness. McDonald was deeply humiliated by Conte's mocking attitude, and by the open laughter of some committee members. In March, 1971, McDonald's wife Betsy told him she wanted a divorce. McDonald seems to have started planning his suicide not long afterwards. He finished a few articles he was writing (UFO-related and otherwise), and made plans for the storage of his notes, papers, and research. In April 1971 he attempted suicide by shooting himself in the head. He survived, but was blinded and was recovering in the hospital. The next day he was nowhere to be found. However, on June 13, 1971, a family, walking along a creek close to the bridge spanning the Canada Del Oro Wash near Tucson, found a body that was later identified as McDonald's. A .38 caliber revolver was found close to him, as well as a suicide note. Four of McDonald's peers from the University of Arizona wrote a reminiscence of their colleague, calling him \\"a man of great integrity and great courage. He was loved and admired by a great many people ... he made a lasting impact on many facets of atmospheric sciences ... and he will be missed much more than we now realize\\".

The observations are very often referred to as physical adsorption or physisorption. In 1938, Stephen Brunauer, Paul Hugh Emmett, and Edward Teller published the first article about the BET theory in the Journal of the American Chemical Society. The BET theory applies to systems of multilayer adsorption and usually utilizes probing gases that do not chemically react with material surfaces as adsorbates to quantify specific surface area. Nitrogen is the most commonly employed gaseous adsorbate used for surface probing by BET methods. For this reason, standard BET analysis is most often conducted at the boiling temperature of N2 (77 K). Further probing adsorbates are also utilized, albeit with lower frequency, allowing the measurement of surface area at different temperatures and measurement scales. These have included argon, carbon dioxide, and water. Specific surface area is a scale- dependent property, with no single true value of specific surface area definable, and thus quantities of specific surface area determined through BET theory may depend on the adsorbate molecule utilized and its adsorption cross section. Concept BET model of multilayer adsorption, that is, a random distribution of sites covered by one, two, three, etc., adsorbate molecules. The concept of the theory is an extension of the Langmuir theory, which is a theory for monolayer molecular adsorption, to multilayer adsorption with the following hypotheses: # gas molecules physically adsorb on a solid in layers infinitely; # gas molecules only interact with adjacent layers; and # the Langmuir theory can be applied to each layer. # the enthalpy of adsorption for the first layer is constant and greater than the second (and higher). # the enthalpy of adsorption for the second (and higher) layers is the same as the enthalpy of liquefaction. The resulting BET equation is : \\\\frac{1 }{v \\\\left [ \\\\left ( {p_0}/{p} \\\\right ) -1 \\\\right ]} = \\\\frac{c-1}{v_\\\\mathrm{m} c} \\\\left ( \\\\frac{p}{p_0} \\\\right ) + \\\\frac{1}{v_m c}, \\\\qquad (1) where p and p_0 are the equilibrium and the saturation pressure of adsorbates at the temperature of adsorption, v is the adsorbed gas quantity (for example, in volume units), and v_\\\\mathrm{m} is the monolayer adsorbed gas quantity. c is the BET constant, : c = \\\\exp\\\\left(\\\\frac{E_1 - E_\\\\mathrm{L}}{RT}\\\\right), \\\\qquad (2) where E_1 is the heat of adsorption for the first layer, and E_\\\\mathrm{L} is that for the second and higher layers and is equal to the heat of liquefaction or heat of vaporization. BET plot Equation (1) is an adsorption isotherm and can be plotted as a straight line with 1/{v [ ({p_0}/{p}) -1 ]} on the y-axis and \\\\varphi={p}/{p_0} on the x-axis according to experimental results. This plot is called a BET plot. The linear relationship of this equation is maintained only in the range of 0.05 < {p}/{p_0} < 0.35. The value of the slope A and the y-intercept I of the line are used to calculate the monolayer adsorbed gas quantity v_\\\\mathrm{m} and the BET constant c. The following equations can be used: :v_m = \\\\frac{1}{A+I}\\\\qquad (3) :c = 1+\\\\frac{A}{I}.\\\\qquad (4) The BET method is widely used in materials science for the calculation of surface areas of solids by physical adsorption of gas molecules. The total surface area S_\\\\mathrm{total} and the specific surface area S_\\\\mathrm{BET} are given by :S_\\\\mathrm{total} = \\\\frac{\\\\left ( v_\\\\mathrm{m} N s \\\\right )}{V}, \\\\qquad (5) :S_\\\\mathrm{BET} = \\\\frac{S_\\\\mathrm{total}}{a}, \\\\qquad (6) where v_\\\\mathrm{m} is in units of volume which are also the units of the monolayer volume of the adsorbate gas, N is the Avogadro number, s the adsorption cross section of the adsorbing species, V the molar volume of the adsorbate gas, and a the mass of the solid sample or adsorbent.  Derivation  The BET theory can be derived similarly to the Langmuir theory, but by considering multilayered gas molecule adsorption, where it is not required for a layer to be completed before an upper layer formation starts. Furthermore, the authors made five assumptions: # Adsorptions occur only on well-defined sites of the sample surface (one per molecule) # The only molecular interaction considered is the following one: a molecule can act as a single adsorption site for a molecule of the upper layer. # The uppermost molecule layer is in equilibrium with the gas phase, i.e. similar molecule adsorption and desorption rates. # The desorption is a kinetically-limited process, i.e. a heat of adsorption must be provided: #* these phenomena are homogeneous, i.e. same heat of adsorption for a given molecule layer. #* it is E1 for the first layer, i.e. the heat of adsorption at the solid sample surface #* the other layers are assumed similar and can be represented as condensed species, i.e. liquid state. Hence, the heat of adsorption is EL is equal to the heat of liquefaction. # At the saturation pressure, the molecule layer number tends to infinity (i.e. equivalent to the sample being surrounded by a liquid phase) Consider a given amount of solid sample in a controlled atmosphere. Let Œ∏i be the fractional coverage of the sample surface covered by a number i of successive molecule layers. Let us assume that the adsorption rate Rads,i-1 for molecules on a layer (i-1) (i.e. formation of a layer i) is proportional to both its fractional surface Œ∏i-1 and to the pressure P, and that the desorption rate Rdes,i on a layer i is also proportional to its fractional surface Œ∏i: :R_{\\\\mathrm{ads},i-1} = k_i P \\\\Theta_{i-1} :R_{\\\\mathrm{des},i} = k_{-i} \\\\Theta_i, where ki and k‚àíi are the kinetic constants (depending on the temperature) for the adsorption on the layer (i‚àí1) and desorption on layer i, respectively. For the adsorptions, these constant are assumed similar whatever the surface. Assuming an Arrhenius law for desorption, the related constants can be expressed as :k_i = \\\\exp(-E_i/RT), where Ei is the heat of adsorption, equal to E1 at the sample surface and to EL otherwise.  Finding the linear BET range  It is still not clear on how to find the linear range of the BET plot for microporous materials in a way that reduces any subjectivity in the assessment of the monolayer capacity. Rouquerol et al. suggested a procedure that is based on two criteria: * C must be positive implying that any negative intercept on the BET plot indicates that one is outside the valid range of the BET equation. * Application of the BET equation must be limited to the range where the term V(1-P/P0) continuously increases with P/P0. These corrections are an attempt to salvage the BET theory which is restricted to type II isotherm. Even with this type, use of the data is restricted to 0.5 to 3.5 of P/P_0, routinely discarding 70% of the data. Even this restriction has to be modified depending upon conditions. The problems with the BET theory are multiple and reviewed by Sing. A serious problem is that there is no relationship between the BET and the calorimetric measurements in experiments. It violates the Gibbs' phase rules. It is extremely unlikely that it measure correctly the surface area, formerly great advantage of the theory. It is based upon chemical equilibrium, which assumes localized chemical bond (this approach has been abandoned by the modern theories. See chapter 4, œá/ESW and Chapter 7, DFT or better NLDFT) in total contradiction to what is known about physical adsorption, which is based upon non-local intermolecular attractions. Two extreme problems is that in certain cases BET leads to anomalies and the C constant can be negative, implying an imaginary energy.  Applications  = Cement and concrete = The rate of curing of concrete depends on the fineness of the cement and of the components used in its manufacture, which may include fly ash, silica fume and other materials, in addition to the calcinated limestone which causes it to harden. Although the Blaine air permeability method is often preferred, due to its simplicity and low cost, the nitrogen BET method is also used. When hydrated cement hardens, the calcium silicate hydrate (or C-S-H), which is responsible for the hardening reaction, has a large specific surface area because of its high porosity. This porosity is related to a number of important properties of the material, including the strength and permeability, which in turn affect the properties of the resulting concrete. Measurement of the specific surface area using the BET method is useful for comparing different cements. This may be performed using adsorption isotherms measured in different ways, including the adsorption of water vapour at temperatures near ambient, and adsorption of nitrogen at 77 K (the boiling point of liquid nitrogen). Different methods of measuring cement paste surface areas often give very different values, but for a single method the results are still useful for comparing different cements. = Activated carbon = For example, activated carbon strongly adsorbs many gases and has an adsorption cross section s of 0.162 nm2 for nitrogen adsorption at liquid-nitrogen temperature (77 K). BET theory can be applied to estimate the specific surface area of activated carbon from experimental data, demonstrating a large specific surface area, even around 3000 m2/g. However, this surface area is largely overestimated due to enhanced adsorption in micropores, and more realistic methods should be used for its estimation, such as the subtracting pore effect (SPE) method. =Catalysis= In the field of solid catalysis, the surface area of catalysts is an important factor in catalytic activity. inorganic materials such as mesoporous silica and layered clay minerals have high surface areas of several hundred m2/g calculated by the BET method, indicating the possibility of application for efficient catalytic materials. =Specific surface area calculation= The ISO 9277 standard for calculating the specific surface area of solids is based on the BET method.

Upon publication it was nonetheless listed as his ‚ÄúString Quartet No. 12.‚Äù (Schubert did also compose the first 40 bars of the next movement, Andante.) The nine-minute work is regarded as an early product of the composer‚Äôs mature phase of output. Background Schubert began work on his twelfth string quartet in early December 1820, shortly after a \\"Schubertiade\\" held at the home of Ignaz von Sonnleithner on the first of the month. It was his first attempt at writing a string quartet since completing the String Quartet No. 11 in E major, D 353 in 1816. After completing the allegro assai first movement, Schubert wrote out the 41 bar exposition of the following andante movement before abandoning the work. As with the later \\"Unfinished\\" Symphony, there has been much speculation on why Schubert left the composition incomplete. One view presented by Bernard Shore is that Schubert put it aside to follow up another musical idea and never got back to it. Javier Arrebola speculates that the work (like several others written during the same period) was put aside because it \\"...did not yet represent the great leap forward he was striving for.\\" It has also been speculated that the work was abandoned because Schubert, having written a powerful first movement, was unable to come up with an effective following movement. Following Schubert's death the manuscript score eventually found its way into the ownership of Johannes Brahms. The Quartettsatz received its posthumous premiere on 1 March 1867 in Vienna, with publication of the score, edited by Brahms, following in 1870. For a number of years it was believed that the Quartettsatz was an early work dating to around 1814 (perhaps a confusion with the Quartettsatz in C minor D 103). In 1905, Edmondstoune Duncan wrote of the composition that it was \\"...fairly workman-like and effective, but is of little further consequence, and is only mentioned by way of completeness.\\" Later opinion, such as Maurice Brown's comment that the quartet was \\"...the only movement in Schubert's instrumental work, prior to the 'Unfinished' Symphony, which prepares us for the greatness which bursts forth in that symphony,\\" established the work's true importance as a forerunner of the late string quartets which are among Schubert's greatest works. Four years after the \\"Quartettsatz,\\" Schubert returned to the genre to write the Rosamunde Quartet, D 804, which was followed by the \\"Death and the Maiden\\" Quartet D 810 and the Fifteenth Quartet, D 887. Structure The composition consists of a single sonata form movement marked Allegro assai and typical performances last nine minutes. Modern completion In 2004 the Oregon String Quartet premiered the Quartettsatz coupled with a completed version of the Andante composed by Livingston Gearhart in 1990.

Publication history  The first issue published of Whiz Comics was issue #2, published with a cover-date of Feb. 1940. Fawcett created two black-and-white ashcan #1 issues to solicit advertisers and to secure the copyrights to the material. The two copies were identical but carried different titles: Flash Comics and Thrill Comics; the Captain Marvel character was called \\"Captain Thunder\\" in a near-identical story. When Fawcett went to press with the magazine, the first issue was retitled as Whiz Comics, a name inspired by the company's bawdy humor magazine, Captain Billy's Whiz Bang.Overstreet Comic Book Price Guide (Gemstone Publishing, 2007), pp 592‚Äì593. Further complicating matters, when they got to issue #3, Fawcett, through either mistake or intent, used the number twice. Thus, if viewed from the perspective of the second #3 (and, therefore, all the issues that followed it), Whiz #2 unofficially became Whiz #1. The cover art for the first issue showed Captain Marvel throwing a vehicle at a wall, and was inspired by the cover of Action Comics #1, which shows Superman lifting a car. The first issue was written by Bill Parker, who also wrote several other issues before Whiz became popular and other writers were hired.  Recurring features  Whiz contained the following features depicting adventures of various superhero characters: * Captain Marvel * Ibis the Invincible * Spy Smasher * Golden Arrow * Dan Dare * Lance O'Casey * Scoop Smith References = Notes = = Sources consulted =  Will Eisner's \\"Shop Talk\\" book.

Early years Foulger was born in Ogden, Utah. He attended the University of Utah and started acting through his participation in community theatre. Foulger was a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.  Career  He made his Broadway debut in March 1920 in a production of Medea featuring Moroni Olsen, and performed in four more productions with Olsen on the 'Great White Way',IBDB Search back-to-back, ending in April 1922. He then toured with Olsen's stock company, and ended up at the Pasadena Playhouse, where he both acted and directed.Erickson, Hal Biography (Allmovie) Foulger made his first three films in 1932 and 1936 with small roles in Night World (1932), The Little Minister, and The President's Mystery, the latter based on a story by Franklin Delano Roosevelt. However, his film career did not start in earnest until 1937 after he performed opposite Mae West in a racy 'Adam and Eve' sketch on the Edgar Bergen-Charlie McCarthy network radio program which resulted in West being banned from the airwaves almost immediately. (Foulger played the voice of the serpent.) From this point on, Foulger worked steadily in motion pictures. He played many parts: storekeepers, hotel desk clerks, morticians, professors, bank tellers, ministers, confidence men, and a host of other characterizations, usually timid, whining, weak-willed, shifty, sanctimonious or sycophantic. His earliest films show him clean-shaven, but in the 1940s he adopted a wispy mustache that emphasized his characters' worried manner. When the mustache went gray in the 1950s, he reverted to a clean-shaven look. Foulger was a resourceful actor and often embellished his scripted lines with memorable bits of business: in The Falcon Strikes Back, for example, hotel clerk Foulger announces a homicide by bellowing across the lobby: \\"Mur-der! Mur-der!' In real life, Foulger was not as much of a pushover as the characters he played. In one memorable incident at a party he threatened to punch Errol Flynn for flirting with his wife, the actress Dorothy Adams, with whom he was married from 1921 until his death in 1970. In the 1940s, Foulger was part of Preston Sturges' unofficial \\"stock company\\" of character actors, appearing in five films written by Sturges, The Great McGinty, Sullivan's Travels, The Palm Beach Story, The Miracle of Morgan's Creek (recreating the role of McGinty's secretary he played in The Great McGinty) and The Great Moment. In \\"A\\" pictures, such as those of Sturges', Foulger often received no screen credit: In B movies such as 1939's The Man They Could Not Hang, he got more substantial, billed parts. By the late 1950s, Foulger was so well established as a mild-mannered worrywart that just the showing of his face would receive a welcoming audience laugh (this happens in the cameo-laden Frank Capra comedy Pocketful of Miracles). In a humorous coup, the actor was cast against type for the most prominent role of his career: he played the Devil opposite The Bowery Boys in Up in Smoke, and was billed in ads and posters as one of the film's three stars. Beginning in 1950, Foulger made over 90 appearances on television, in programs such as Death Valley Days, I Love Lucy, The Cisco Kid, My Little Margie, The Man Behind the Badge, The Lone Ranger, Maverick, Lawman, The Red Skelton Show, Rawhide, Wagon Train, Bonanza, Burke's Law, Daniel Boone, Hazel, The Patty Duke Show, The Monkees, Perry Mason, Laredo, Gunsmoke, and, in 1965, The Beverly Hillbillies and The Addams Family. He played multiple-episode characters on Dennis the Menace (\\"Mr. Timberlake\\"), Lassie (\\"Dan Porter\\") and The Andy Griffith Show (\\"Fred, the hotel clerk\\"). On Petticoat Junction he played two recurring roles: \\"Mr. Guerney\\" and engineer \\"Wendell Gibbs\\". Notable later television credits included the 1959 Twilight Zone episode \\"Walking Distance\\" - in which Gig Young tells Foulger, who is playing a drugstore counterman, that he thinks he's seen him before, to which Foulger replies: \\"I've got that kind of face\\" - the short-lived comedies My Mother the Car (as one of the villain's browbeaten advisors) and Captain Nice (as the hero's often silent father), and The Mod Squad, his last appearance in episodic television. Byron Foulger's last film appearances were in The Love War, a TV movie, and There Was a Crooked Man..., both in 1970. Death He died of heart problemsBromburgh, Gary Biography (IMDB) in Hollywood on 4 April 1970, at the age of 70, and is buried in Inglewood Park Cemetery in Inglewood, California. Foulger died on the same day the final episode of Petticoat Junction was broadcast, in which he played train engineer Wendell Gibbs. He was survived by his wife Dorothy Adams and daughter, Rachel Ames, both actresses.

The Th.D, like the ecclesiastical Doctor of Sacred Theology (STD), is an advanced research degree equivalent to the Doctor of Philosophy.  Terminology  In the academic study of theology, which is deeply rooted in the Christian religion, doctoral students are often conferred a Doctor of Theology, a Doctor of Philosophy, a Doctor of Ministry, a Doctor of Practical Theology or Doctor of Sacred Theology. However, the Doctor of Ministry is generally understood as a professional doctorate. = United States = In the United States, some of the older theological seminaries began offering the Doctor of Theology (Th.D) as an equivalent to the research Doctor of Philosophy. In Princeton Theological Seminary, for example, this practice was inherited from the German system of education since the professors involved in establishing the doctoral program were trained in German universities. Though the PhD was the doctorate of arts faculties in German universities (hence the Ph), Princeton Theological Seminary has since switched to using Doctor of Philosophy as its main designation. A similar shift happened at Harvard Divinity School in 2015. Due to the secular push in doctoral studies, Th.D programs have moved to other known accreditation, like the Association for Biblical Higher Education (ABHE) or choose to be only affiliates of accrediting agencies so they have more freedom to teach Christian Doctrine that is more practical for church ministry. For example, the only Association of Theological Schools accredited schools currently accepting students to Th.D programs are Duke Divinity School and Evangelical Seminary. = United Kingdom = In the United Kingdom, the Doctor of Theology is a fairly new doctoral program. Certain universities have begun offering it as a form of practical doctorate, focused on practices and assessed at the same level as the Ph.D. To offer a doctorate that helping distinguishes the more practical nature of the degree, some British universities have adopted the term Doctor of Practical Theology.

Under the Uniform Commercial Code, the buyer is permitted (but not required) to find another source of the same type of goods. The buyer may then file a lawsuit against the breaching seller to recover the difference, if any, between the cost of the goods offered and the cost of the goods actually purchased. The possibility of cover will prevent a party from being able to sue for specific performance, which is an equitable remedy that requires the buyer have no adequate remedy at law. If the buyer is able to buy elsewhere and sue for the difference, that provides an adequate remedy. This prohibition does not apply, however, to the sale of unique goods such as original works of art, collectibles, real estate, and exclusive rights. Judge Richard Posner has suggested that the availability of cover allows for efficient breach - that is, that it encourages the most efficient allocation of resources by allowing a seller to breach a contract to sell goods to one buyer when another, more lucrative opportunity comes along. The seller may thus be able to realize a sufficiently increased profit to make more money even after repaying the difference to the original buyer. Therefore, no value is lost in the transaction because the original buyer is in the same position he would have been in but for the breach, and the seller is in a better position.

Early life He was born in Berlin, the youngest son of Friedrich Flick and Marie Schuss. After his studies, he worked in his father's company. In 1972, when his father died, he inherited the major part of the family business. Career As the sole owner of the Friedrich Flick Industrial Holding (Industrieverwaltung), he had interests in major companies including Daimler-Benz, WR Grace, Gerling Insurance, Buderus, Dynamit Nobel, Feldm√ºhle and others. In 1975 he sold his part of Daimler-Benz to the Deutsche Bank for more than $1 billion. Major tax liabilities were avoided through \\"cultivation of the political landscape\\",‚Äîa process that turned into the Flick Affair in 1983 when it became apparent that about $25 million had been paid to German political parties in return for tax cuts and favorable rulings. Although Chancellor Helmut Kohl benefited from the dealings, he claimed he had \\"no recollections\\", while others resigned from their posts. In 1985 Flick sold off the remainder of his companies. When Deutsche Bank announced that it had bought his holdings for about $3 billion German marks, Flick retired in Austria, where he became a naturalised citizen. In March 2006, his estimated net worth was $6.1 billion. Personal life He married three times and had two children from his second and third marriages. At the time of his death, he was the wealthiest person living in Austria. He died on 5 October 2006 at his villa in Auen on the W√∂rthersee, Austria. In November 2008, it was reported that an oak coffin containing his remains was taken from his family's mausoleum at a cemetery at Velden am W√∂rther See, in what Austrian Federal Police believe may be an attempt to extort money from his widow.

Rudolf Tƒõsnohl√≠dek (7 June 1882 in ƒå√°slav - 12 January 1928 in Brno, suicide) was a Czech writer, poet, journalist and translator. He also used the pseudonym Arno≈°t Bellis.  Life  He attended secondary school (gymnasium) in Hradec Kr√°lov√© and later started to study Czech, history and French at university in Prague but didn't finish. Starting in 1908, he was a contributor to the Brno newspaper Lidov√© noviny. His serialized novel Li≈°ka Bystrou≈°ka (Vixen Sharp Ears), written to accompany a series of drawings by Stanislav Lolek, appeared in the Lidov√© noviny between 7 April and 23 June 1920, was published as a book in 1921, won a state prize and achieved lasting popularity. This optimistic tale, somewhere between a children's fairy tale and adult satire, was used as the basis for Leo≈° Jan√°ƒçek's opera The Cunning Little Vixen (P≈ô√≠hody Li≈°ky Bystrou≈°ky, 1923). Some of Tƒõsnohl√≠dek's other work reflects more pessimism and alienation than the lighthearted Vixen's tale. His life, as interpreted by his journalistic colleague Bed≈ôich Golombek, was a melodramatic tragedy imbued with pessimism, darkness, melancholy and decadence, a life plagued from childhood by feelings of sadness and social exclusion. In his teens, he watched helplessly as a friend drowned. When he was 21, he married Jindra Kopeck√°, a woman with tuberculosis. Two months after their wedding, on a holiday in Norway, she shot herself in the heart in front of him, possibly accidentally. Tƒõsnohl√≠dek was accused of murdering her, and had to endure two trials before being acquitted. In 1907 he moved to Brno, where he became a reporter of soudniƒçky (cases from the local magistrate's court) for Lidov√© noviny. After he had met Jan√°ƒçek and discussed plans for the opera based on Li≈°ka Bystrou≈°ka, he married again, but this wife left him. He married a third time. He became interested in exploring the Moravian caves, wrote extensively about them, and submitted his drafts for publication but found they had been heavily edited without his knowledge. On 12 January 1928, he shot himself, as his first wife had done. His third wife gassed herself to death on hearing the news. Vixen Sharp Ears was first published in English in 1985, as The Cunning Little Vixen, with pictures by Maurice Sendak. Shortly before Christmas 1919, Tƒõsnohl√≠dek and some friends were walking in the woods outside the town of B√≠lovice nad Svitavou a few kilometres to the north of Brno when they discovered an abandoned and in danger of freezing girl aged seventeen months. They rescued the child and took her to the police station at B√≠lovice. The child, subsequently named Lidu≈°ka, was adopted by a family named Pol√°kov from Brno, and lived until 1997, dying in Prague.  Adaptations  Ursula Dubosarsky's 2018 novel for children, \\"Brindabella\\", is based on \\"Vixen Sharp Ears\\" relocated in the Australian bush, with the role of the Vixen played by a kangaroo.

Structure Consisting of six movements, the Octet takes almost an hour to perform. #Adagio ‚Äì Allegro ‚Äì Pi√π allegro #Adagio #Allegro vivace ‚Äì Trio ‚Äì Allegro vivace #Andante ‚Äì variations. Un poco pi√π mosso ‚Äì Pi√π lento #Menuetto. Allegretto ‚Äì Trio ‚Äì Menuetto ‚Äì Coda #Andante molto ‚Äì Allegro ‚Äì Andante molto ‚Äì Allegro molto The Octet boasts the largest scale for any chamber work by Schubert. It is scored for a clarinet, a bassoon, a horn, two violins, a viola, a cello, and a double bass. This instrumentation is similar to that of the Beethoven Septet, differing only by the addition of a second violin. Background In response to a reported request by Troyer for a work similar to Beethoven's Septet, Op. 20, Schubert composed the Octet in early 1824. The work was first performed at the home of Troyer's employer, the Archduke Rudolf (to whom Beethoven's Archduke Trio is dedicated) and included many of the musicians who premiered the Septet.Gibbs, p. 188 Analysis The basic structure of the movements is similar to those of the Septet, as are many of the key relationships between the movements and principal key (E-flat for the Septet, F major of the Octet).Gibbs, pp. 188‚Äì189 The theme of the first movement is derived from Schubert's song Der Wanderer. The fourth movement variations are based on a theme from Schubert's Singspiel Die Freunde von Salamanka.Gibbs, p. 190 Recordings The Melos Ensemble was founded to perform works such as the Octet for wind instruments and strings. The Octet was recorded in 1967 with Gervase de Peyer (clarinet), William Waterhouse (bassoon), Neill Sanders (horn), Emanuel Hurwitz and Ivor McMahon (violin), Cecil Aronowitz (viola), Terence Weil (cello) and Adrian Beers (double bass).Melos Ensemble ‚Äì Music among Friends EMI A recording of the chamber ensemble of the Academy of St Martin in the Fields with Iona Brown (violin I) and Timothy Brown (horn) won a Grand Prix du Disque.

He is the Mayor of Invercargill and was previously Mayor of Waitemata City. Early life Shadbolt was born in the Auckland suburb of Remuera in 1947. His father died in a flying accident in 1952. He was on the school council and appointed prefect. Activist: 1960s and 1970s Shadbolt became a founding student of Rutherford College, Auckland, and attended the University of Auckland from 1966 to 1970, taking a year off in 1967 to work on the Manapouri Power Project in Southland. He was a member of the Auckland University Students Association executive, and editor of Craccum in 1972. During the late 1960s and early 1970s, he became prominent in the Progressive Youth Movement, a radical left-wing organisation, and was arrested 33 times during political protests, most famously for using the word \\"bullshit\\"; this incident influenced the title of his 1971 autobiography Bullshit & Jellybeans. After 1970, he founded a commune and concrete cooperative at Huia. Local politician: 1980s‚Äìpresent =Waitemata= Shadbolt claims he stood for Mayor of Waitemata City in 1983 because he did not want to see the incumbent Tony Covic re-elected unopposed. He won the election. He famously celebrated, much to some people's disgust, by towing his concrete mixer (named \\"Karl Marx\\" ) behind the mayoral Daimler in the 1983 Henderson Christmas parade. He won again in 1986 heading a political ticket called \\"Tim's Team\\", but in 1989 lost the following mayoral election in the newly formed Waitakere city (an enlarged Waitemata city) to Assid Corban. During his term as mayor he became infamous by twice losing the mayoral chains. He stood in the electorate of West Auckland (which incorporated Waitemata) at the 1990 New Zealand general election as an independent. He placed fifth with 3.06 per cent of the vote. Later that year, he unsuccessfully stood in a by-election for Mayor of Auckland City, polling a distant eighth place. Two years later he stood again for Mayor of Auckland City, where he finished third place with a slightly increased share of the vote. Later that year, he stood in the Wellington Central by-election as an independent candidate, polling less than half a percentage point. =Invercargill= In 1993, Shadbolt ran successfully for the position of Mayor of Invercargill. In 1994, he contested the Selwyn by- election as a candidate for New Zealand First, but was placed fourth, and remained Mayor of Invercargill. He was defeated in 1995. In the 1996 general election he stood unsuccessfully as a candidate for the Aotearoa Legalise Cannabis Party. In 1998, Shadbolt was re-elected to the mayoralty and has remained the mayor ever since. In 2001 he was re-elected unopposed. In October 2002, Shadbolt told a conference of New Zealand's Disabled Persons Assembly that Invercargill had \\"an innovative approach to public transport, currently centred on 'Freebie the Bus' travelling the 'Purple Circle'\\". He said he hoped that in future all buses in Invercargill would be free and accessible. (The Freebie and Purple Circle are zero-fare bus routes in Invercargill.) In 2004 and 2007, he won his fourth and fifth mayoral terms by huge margins. In 2010, he won his sixth Invercargill mayoral election. Shadbolt received 16,466 votes over mayoral candidates Suzanne Prentice (5,361 votes) and Carl Heenan (682 votes). The 2010 election win made Shadbolt the longest-serving mayor in New Zealand, with this being his 8th mayoral term (his 6th term in Invercargill). On 8 October 2016 he again won re-election as Invercargill's mayor. He said this was his toughest campaign yet. \\"I‚Äôve had two candidates both going flat- out and it was a tough election\\", he said. \\"In the past I‚Äôve had either no contenders, but this time I had a television producer and a sitting councillor who had also been an investigative journalist, so it was pretty tough opposition.\\" He was returned for another term in 2019. Outside politics =Family= Shadbolt has one son from an early marriage. He met his second wife, Miriam Cameron, in 1970. They have two sons. Cameron left Shadbolt in 1989 after alleged repeated domestic violence. They divorced three years later. Shadbolt's current partner is lawyer Asha Dutt and they have one son. =Notable activities= He has presented several television documentaries, and the series That's Fairly Interesting. In the 1990s he appeared in an advertisement promoting New Zealand cheese, where he humorously repeated the phrase \\"I don't care where as long as I'm mayor\\", referencing his dual mayoralties. He admitted later that the phrase was developed by an advertising agency. In 2001, he appeared as a contestant on a celebrity special of The Weakest Link.Tim a little red-faced after Weakest Link blue In 2005, New Zealand Toastmasters awarded him the Communicator of the Year award. He also played in the movie The World's Fastest Indian, portraying a good friend of Burt Munro who organised social events for Invercargill's motorcycling community. He also participated in the New Zealand version of Dancing with the Stars where he placed 3rd. In 2006 Shadbolt played the part of the Narrator in The Rocky Horror Show by the Invercargill Musical Theatre. He continued his theatre experiences by appearing in 2007 in the Invercargill Musical Theatres production of Sea Cruise. In 2010, Shadbolt appeared on the comedy gameshow 7 Days as the guest participant in the round Yes, Minister. In 2012, Shadbolt set the Guinness World Record for the longest television interview. He was interviewed for 26 consecutive hours by interviewer Tom Conroy. In doing so the pair also set the record for the longest single event in New Zealand television history. Shadbolt later said he would have liked to keep going. The record was broken in 2013 by Norwegian novelist Hans Olav Lahlum. He was knighted in the 2019 New Year Honours List as a Knight Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit (KNZM).

As a very young man, he joined the illegal Communist Party in Transylvania. In 1933 he was arrested and sentenced to nine years in prison. When Northern Transylvania was transferred to Hungary as part of the Second Vienna Award in 1940, he was released and he moved to Budapest. During World War II, he worked within the anti-fascist movement acting as a liaison between groups. When the war ended, Dud√°s was a member of an unofficial ceasefire delegation that visited Moscow, and he was a founding member of the Liberation Committee of the Hungarian National Uprising. In late 1945 he joined the Independent Smallholders' Party and was elected to the Budapest government. As the communists mounted their campaign to take over Hungary, Dud√°s was arrested and detained until he was handed over to Romanian state security in 1951. Released in 1954, he returned to Hungary. Working as an engineer when the Hungarian Revolution of 1956 broke out, he took to addressing crowds and on 29 October, established the Second District National Committee, with a 25-point program demanding, a coalition government, a multi-party system and neutrality. He also started a newspaper (Magyar F√ºggetlens√©g‚ÄîHungarian Independence), which headlined, ‚ÄòWe do not recognize the present government!‚Äô At this same time the so-called \\"Dud√°s Group\\" consisting of about 400 armed men was formed. Dud√°s soon acquired a bad reputation among the revolutionary forces, as he started negotiations with Colonel Malashenko, acting chief of staff of the Soviet Special Forces, with the aim of being recognized by the Soviets as the main seat of political and military power in Hungary, instead of Imre Nagy. The Dud√°s group also became known for the campaign of terror it unleashed against members of Hungary's AVH Secret Police, lynching or otherwise executing offenders on sight. The activities of the group went to such an extreme that other revolutionaries began arresting AVH officers for their own protection. He continued publishing his newspaper criticizing the Nagy government until his own armed men dismissed him on 3 November, and he was arrested by government forces for acts attributed to him, or rumors of such acts (an attack on the Foreign Ministry; looting of the National Bank). On 4 November he was wounded and taken to a hospital. On 21 November he was tricked into entering the Parliament building and was arrested by the Soviets. He was charged with leadership of a conspiracy and on 14 January 1957 he was sentenced to death. He was executed on 19 January 1957.

Nicknamed \\"Big Daddy\\", he played college football for the Ohio State University, was recognized as an All- American and received several national awards recognizing him as an outstanding college lineman. He was drafted first overall in the 1994 NFL Draft, and played professionally for the Cincinnati Bengals, Washington Redskins, Detroit Lions, and Miami Dolphins of the NFL. Early years Wilkinson was born in Dayton, Ohio.National Football League, Historical Players, Dan Wilkinson. Retrieved February 11, 2012. He attended Dunbar High School in Dayton,databaseFootball.com, Players, Dan Wilkinson . Retrieved February 11, 2012. and played for the Dunbar Wolverines high school football team. His football coach at Stivers Intermediate School, Albert Powell, gave Wilkinson the nickname \\"Big Daddy\\", after convincing him to play defensive line instead of fullback. \\"Carl Hairston was in Cleveland at the time, so I told Dan, 'You're our Big Daddy.'\\" College career Wilkinson received an athletic scholarship to attend Ohio State University, where he played for the Ohio State Buckeyes football team from 1991 to 1993. During his freshman season in 1991, the Buckeyes coaches redshirted and placed him on the scout team. At the time, Wilkinson weighed 348 pounds and played offensive tackle. During the season, he lost 48 pounds and began to play defense. Lining up next to Alonzo Spellman during his sophomore year, Wilkinson earned All-Big Ten honors after he had 46 tackles, 10.5 tackles-for-loss, and 6.5 sacks. Playing under tackle next to nose guard Luke Fickell as a junior in 1993, Wilkinson finished with 44 tackles and 13 tackles-for-loss. He earned first-team All-Big Ten honors and was recognized as a consensus first-team All-American. He decided to forgo his final season of college eligibility and subsequently declared for the 1994 NFL Draft. Professional career =1994 NFL Draft= Along with running back Marshall Faulk and quarterbacks Heath Shuler and Trent Dilfer, Wilkinson was regarded as \\"one of the four players who rank well above the others in this draft\\". In workouts prior to the draft, Wilkinson weighed in at 315 pounds, bench-pressed 225 pounds 34 times and ran a remarkably fast 40 yards in 4.72 seconds. \\"Wilkinson could be a once-in-10-years player,\\" said Billy Devaney, then San Diego Chargers' director of player personnel. Also described as \\"maybe the best defensive-line prospect since Reggie White [in 1984],\\" Wilkinson drew a lot of interest from around the league. Several teams were willing to trade with the Cincinnati Bengals for the No. 1 draft pick, including the New England Patriots, who reportedly offered their first-round pick (4th overall), plus several players including offensive guard Eugene Chung (their first-round choice in 1992), and the Arizona Cardinals, who offered their pick plus running back Garrison Hearst (their 1993 first- rounder). Eventually, the Bengals decided to keep the pick, and decided not to select a quarterback, since they already picked David Klingler in 1992. Becoming the third defensive lineman in four years‚Äîafter Russell Maryland and Steve Emtman‚Äîto be selected first overall, Wilkinson was chosen by the Bengals. He was only the second Ohio State defensive player to go No. 1, after Tom Cousineau in 1979. =Cincinnati Bengals= After an 11-day holdout, Wilkinson signed a six-year, $14.4 million ($ million in current value) contract with the Cincinnati Bengals on May 5, 1994, becoming the highest-paid player in their franchise history. While in training camp, Bengals coaches compared Wilkinson to All-Pro offensive tackle Anthony Mu√±oz in terms of talent. Wilkinson remained with the team from to .Pro-Football-Reference.com, Players, Dan Wilkinson. Retrieved February 11, 2012. During his rookie season, Wilkinson led the team with 19 quarterback hurries. He set a season-high and led the team with seven tackles against the Indianapolis Colts on November 20. During the season finale against the Philadelphia Eagles on December 20, Wilkinson volunteered to give up his starting spot so Bengals great Tim Krumrie could start his final home game. Wilkinson still made two sacks in a reserve role. Wilkinson set a career-high with eight quarterback sacks in 1995‚Äîa total which led all AFC interior linemen that season and was the most by a Bengals interior lineman since Mike Reid in 1972. Wilkinson's 18 quarterback hurries were second on the team and he played in 829 snaps, second-most on the defensive line. He spent time at both defensive tackle positions and right defensive end. He played the first two games of the regular season with a cast on his hand after breaking his ring finger in the final preseason game. He registered two sacks and led defensive line with five tackles (all solo) in win against the Jacksonville Jaguars on September 10 and sacked quarterback Mark Brunell on fourth down in the final minute of the game to preserve the Bengals win. Wilkinson suffered a neck injury against the Chicago Bears on December 10 and was inactive for the final two games of the season. Wilkinson led the Bengals in sacks for the first time in 1996 with 6.5, including one in each of the first five games, and also led the defensive line with 37 solo tackles. He led a rushing defense which allowed fewest yards per game (102.7) since the 1983 Bengals allowed 93.7. He opened the year with a season-high eight tackles, a sack and five quarterback hurries against the St. Louis Rams on September 1. He made his first career interception against the Baltimore Ravens on November 3, picking off a Vinny Testaverde pass. In 1997, Wilkinson played much of the season at right defensive end after the Bengals converted to a 3-4 defense, totaling a team-high five sacks. He was awarded the team's defensive game ball for his play in Cincinnati‚Äôs victory over the Jacksonville Jaguars on November 23. He missed his only game of the season against the Dallas Cowboys on December 14 with a stinger in his neck. =Washington Redskins= In December 1997, Wilkinson clashed with ownership and the city he played in. He was disappointed when the Bengals placed the franchise tag on him during the offseason.http://www.apnewsarchive.com/1998/Bengals-Designate-Franchise- Player/id-88c69afa6561c8a2c2bc976d6fe72ff1 He also called Cincinnati a \\"racist\\" city, saying its residents were \\"prejudiced and uptight and stiff.\\" The remarks caused owner Mike Brown to act, and on February 26, 1998, Wilkinson was traded to the Washington Redskins. That same week, the Redskins had also acquired the reigning NFL Defensive Player of the Year, Dana Stubblefield, from the San Francisco 49ers. Wilkinson was very productive during his first season in Washington, leading the team in sacks (7.5), quarterback pressures (50) and tackles-for-loss (six). His 50 quarterback pressures were 30 more than the team's No. 2 man in that category (defensive end Kenard Lang). Wilkinson set career highs in total tackles (60) and solo stops (45), playing in more snaps (1,037) than any other defensive tackle in the NFL that season. He intercepted his second career pass against Philadelphia on November 15 when he picked off the deflected pass deep in Eagles territory and ran four yards before being tackled, setting up the Redskins' first touchdown. He also performed well against the New York Giants on November 1 with 14 QB pressures, seven tackles and a pass deflection. He tied a career-high with eight tackles against the Arizona Cardinals on November 22. Wilkinson led the Redskins with eight sacks to match his career- high from 1995 and finished second in quarterback pressures (43) in 1999. In a Week 7 game against the Chicago Bears, Redskins defensive end Marco Coleman hit Bears quarterback Shane Matthews, forcing the ball into Wilkinson's hands. He returned it (at a comfortable pace) 88 yards for a touchdown, with speedster Darrell Green escorting him most of the way. The play gave the Redskins a 14‚Äì0 lead in their 48‚Äì22 win over Chicago and was the fourth- longest interception return for a score in Redskins history, the longest such return ever by a Redskins player at home and the longest return ever by a Redskins defensive lineman. Wilkinson also racked up five tackles (three solo), two sacks, five pressures and a pass defensed at the New York Giants on September 19, when he was awarded a game ball along with the rest of the starting defensive line. He recorded a team-high nine pressures, a sack, two solos and one tackle-for-loss against the Arizona Cardinals on December 12. In 2000, Wilkinson experienced the lowest sack total of his career at just 3.5 for the year. He made a season-high four tackles on two occasions, at the Dallas Cowboys and at Pittsburgh Steelers in consecutive weeks in mid- December. He had a season-long, nine-yard sack at the Jacksonville Jaguars on October 22. While Wilkinson did not post entirely impressive statistics in 2001, he made key blocks allowing other defensive players to make big plays while also contributing in other ways. His pass deflection on second-and-goal led to an interception by Otis Leverette on the one-yard line and ended a critical scoring threat by the Carolina Panthers on October 21. The Redskins went on to beat the Panthers 17‚Äì14 in overtime. Although he posted no stats in the game, Wilkinson's pressure helped hold Philadelphia's offense to only 186 total yards. On the year, Wilkinson finished with 25 tackles (19 solo), four sacks and two interceptions. His two interceptions came off Donovan McNabb and Aaron Brooks. Wilkinson experienced his worst season as a pro in 2002, which would prove to be his last with the Redskins. He recorded one tackle against the Dallas Cowboys on November 28 before leaving the game in the third quarter with a strained right calf. He was placed on injured reserve on December 5, ending his season. In the 12 games he played, he recorded 16 tackles (12 solo) and five pass deflections. It was the first season of his career in which he did not record a sack. =Detroit Lions= During the 2003 offseason, Wilkinson voiced his preference to stay in Washington and it appeared it would happen. The team wanted him to take a pay cut, since they considered Wilkinson's team-high $3.5 million salary \\"too much\\" for a player who had a career-low 17 tackles and no sacks in 2002. But negotiations with Wilkinson's agent fell through, and he was cut by the team on July 29. Wilkinson received interest from the Dallas Cowboys, Green Bay Packers, and New England Patriots and approximately four other organizations. On August 17, he agreed to sign with the Detroit Lions. In Wilkinson's first regular season game with the Lions against the Arizona Cardinals on September 7, he recorded three solo tackles, five quarterback hurries, two passes defensed and a nine-yard sack of quarterback Jeff Blake‚Äîthe first Lions' sack of the season. His best game of the season came against the Green Bay Packers on November 27 with a sack of Brett Favre, his first fumble recovery of 2003, two quarterback pressures and a season-high six tackles (four solos). He notched a pass defense, two quarterback knockdowns and a pressure against the St. Louis Rams on December 28, helping hold the Rams‚Äô rushing attack to just 41 yards. Despite modest statistics (24 tackles and two sacks), Wilkinson made a significant impact on the Lions' run defense. He was named to Peter King of Sports Illustrated‚Äôs all-pro team. In 2004, Wilkinson appeared in all 16 games for the Lions. He was a member of a defensive line unit that registered 30.5 sacks, the seventh- highest total among any front four in the NFL. The unit also started every game together during the season. Wilkinson forced a fumble and sacked Eagles quarterback Donovan McNabb for a seven-yard loss against Philadelphia on September 26. He also set a career-high with two forced fumbles during the season. He was also instrumental in the development of younger players, including Pro Bowl defensive tackle Shaun Rogers and defensive end James Hall. In the 2005 season, Wilkinson's last with the Lions, he played in all 16 games for the third straight year. He finished the season with 26 tackles (20 solo) and three sacks‚Äîhis highest total in four seasons. He recorded two Trent Dilfer sacks at the Cleveland Browns on October 23, for a loss of 10 yards. His sack in the first quarter for nine yards prevented the Browns from reaching the end zone, and forced a field goal attempt. He recorded his first career safety after punter Nick Harris downed a punt on the 2-yard line against the Arizona Cardinals on November 13. On the ensuing possession, he tackled Cardinals fullback Obafemi Ayanbadejo in the end zone in the first quarter. Wilkinson had a sack on December 4 against Minnesota Vikings quarterback Brad Johnson for a loss of seven yards to stop a potential scoring drive and force the Vikings to punt. =Miami Dolphins= During the 2006 offseason, the Lions unsuccessfully attempted to trade Wilkinson and subsequently released him on May 22. He received interest from multiple teams, and visited with the Miami Dolphins in early June. The two parties negotiated on a contract, but Wilkinson preferred to not sign until later so as not to go through the rigors of an entire training camp at his age. He officially signed a three-year deal with the team on August 14. It was officially a three-year, $6.31 million contract, although it was structured in a way that would essentially make it a one-year deal. Wilkinson received a $500,000 signing bonus and had a $810,000 in base salary in 2006. His base salary would jump to $2 million in 2007 and $2.5 million in 2008. He is due a $500,000 roster bonus in the 2008 offseason. Wilkinson played in a reserve role most of the season behind Keith Traylor and Jeff Zgonina, battling nagging injuries and dealing with a lawsuit which caused him to miss time. In 10 games played, he recorded 13 tackles (nine solo) and three pass deflections. On December 21, Wilkinson was placed on season-ending injured reserve with knee and hamstring injuries. In the 2007 offseason, the Dolphins attempted to trade Wilkinson to the Denver Broncos in exchange for a sixth-round draft pick in the 2007 NFL Draft. Wilkinson failed to contact either team, and while deadlines for him to report were extended during the offseason, the trade fell through and was voided on March 31. On June 18, the Dolphins released Wilkinson. =Career transactions= *Drafted by the Bengals in the first round (first overall) of the 1994 NFL Draft in April 1994. *Traded to the Redskins on February 26, 1998. *Released by the Redskins on July 29, 2003. *Signed by the Lions on August 17, 2003. *Released by the Lions on May 22, 2006. *Signed by the Dolphins on August 14, 2006. *Released by the Dolphins on June 18, 2007. Personal life The second-youngest of eleven children, Wilkinson was born in Dayton, Ohio, to Oliver and Veronda Wilkinson. Wilkinson had four children with his ex-wife Shawnda: Brooklyn, Daniel Ramon Jr., Taylor, and Sydn√©. He is now remarried and has had two more children, Kennedy and Klarke. They reside in Potomac, Maryland. =Legal troubles= Wilkinson has been involved in a few lawsuits since the start of his professional career. In 1996, Wilkinson pleaded no contest to the charge of domestic violence. He was subsequently found guilty of striking his pregnant girlfriend. Wilkinson's girlfriend, however, stated that she did not wish to pursue prosecution. In March 2006, Capital Centre LLC, a joint project headed by the Cordish Company and Washington Sports & Entertainment, sued Wilkinson. The suit alleged that Wilkinson was personally liable for a breach of contract related to a lease the two parties had agreed to. On April 3, 2006, The Maryland federal district court issued an opinion on the validity of the case.http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/USCOURTS-mdd-1_04-cv-00182/pdf/USCOURTS- mdd-1_04-cv-00182-0.pdf References External links * *Wilkinson post- football career Category:1973 births Category:Living people Category:Sportspeople from Dayton, Ohio Category:Players of American football from Ohio Category:American football defensive tackles Category:Ohio State Buckeyes football players Category:All-American college football players Category:National Football League first overall draft picks Category:Cincinnati Bengals players Category:Washington Redskins players Category:Detroit Lions players Category:Miami Dolphins players ","title":"Dan Wilkinson"},{"id":"2066062","text":"Leonard Francis Tremeer (1 August 1874 ‚Äì 21 October 1951), known as Jimmy Tremeer, was an Olympic bronze medallist in the men's 400 metres hurdles at the 1908 Summer Olympics.

Halfway through the race, it became evident that Tremeer had no chance. He finished third in 57.0 seconds, a time that was still faster than anyone had run the race before the London Olympics.

It forms the southern tip of a triangle with Boyle and Carrick-on-Shannon to the north west and north east respectively. It is at the junction of the R368 and R369 regional roads. Ireland West Airport Knock is west of Elphin - approximately 40 minutes by road. History Elphin has historically been an important market town and the diocesan centre for the Diocese of Elphin. St Patrick is believed to have visited Elphin, consecrated its first church and ordained its first bishop, Asicus (subsequently the patron saint of Elphin). Information supporting the visitation of St Patrick is to be found in two important memorials of early Irish hagiography, the Vita Tripartita of St Patrick, and the \\"Patrician Documents\\" in the Book of Armagh. On his missionary tour through Connacht in 434 or 435, St Patrick came to the territory of Corcoghlan, present day Elphin. The chief of that territory, a noble Druid named Ono, gave land and afterwards his castle or fort to St Patrick to found a church and monastery. The place, which had hitherto been called Emlagh-Ono (a derivation of its owners name) received the designation of Ail Finn, which means \\"rock of the clear spring\\". It derives from a story of St Patrick raising a large stone from a well opened by him in the land of Ono and placed on its margin. A copious stream of crystal water flowed from the well and continues to flow through Elphin to this day. St Patrick built a church called Tempull Phadruig (Patrick's church) and established an Episcopal See in Elphin. St Asicus remained as bishop of Elphin. St Patrick also founded an episcopal monastery or college at Elphin, believed to be one of the first monasteries founded by him. In pre-Reformation times, Elphin was host to a large number of religious orders and was a religious centre of international significance. This is supported by the appearance of Elphin in a number of pan-European maps in the Middle Ages. Elphin Church After the Reformation Elphin continued as the centre of a bishopric. A new bishop's residence was built in the 1720s to the central block and flanking pavilions plan that is very common in Irish country houses of this period. The main block of the bishop's house was destroyed by fire early in the 20th Century and was subsequently demolished, but the ruins of the pavilions survive together with the curtain walls that linked them to the main house. The Church of Ireland cathedral was also rebuilt in the eighteenth century. It was a modest building, no bigger than a small parish church, with a tall square clock tower at its west end. An apse was added in the 19th century. The cathedral was used for worship up to 1961. It was badly damaged in a storm on 4 February 1957 and was demolished a few years later, but its partially restored ruins can still be seen. Associated with the cathedral was Elphin Diocesan School, popularly known as 'The Latin School'. Its most famous students were Oliver Goldsmith and the eye surgeon Sir William Wilde, father of Oscar Wilde. The school was closed in the 1860s when the seat of the bishopric was moved to Kilmore, County Cavan. According to legend, it was close to Elphin that the mythological figure of Oisin fell from his horse upon his return from T√≠r na n√ìg (The Land of Eternal Youth). Within 6 km of Elphin is Cruachan (otherwise Rathcroghan), the famous palace of Queen Meave (she of the T√°in B√≥ C√∫ailnge and a prominent figure in Irish mythology, notably the Ulster Cycle) and the Connacht kings. The well of Ogulla (otherwise the Virgin Monument), scene of the famous conversion and baptism of Aithnea (Eithne) and Fidelm, the daughters of Leoghari, monarch of Ireland in the time of St Patrick, is also situate near Elphin. It is reputed that the gold and riches of Ned Kelly are buried in foothills just outside Elphin. Windmill Elphin windmill An early 18th century windmill has been restored in the village. The windmill was built between 1720 - 1740. Some accounts state that the windmill was no longer in use and had fallen into disrepair by 1830. This timeline is corroborated by the \\"School's Collection\\" from the National Folklore Collection, a national survey of local folklore conducted by the schoolchildren of Ireland (including Elphin) dating from May 1938. One entry related to the windmill in Elphin states \\"There is a windmill about a quarter of a mile on the north-side of the town. It is in the village of Chanterland and it is on the left-hand side of the road as a person goes from Elphin to Boyle. It is a circular structure and it was well built because although it is very old it is as good as when it was built. There are two doors on it one facing the other but one is filled with stones. There is a stream going by the mill and where the Boyle road crosses it is called The Mill Dam. The stream rises in the Deanery and it flows in an eastern direction. There are none of the mill stones to be seen around the Mill. A man named Culligan who died fifteen years ago said that the Windmill was not worked for eighty years before that\\".

It is near Lough Allen (on the Shannon-Erne Waterway), on a designated \\"scenic route\\" between Keadue and Sliabh an Iarainn. Arigna is situated in Kilronan Parish alongside the villages of Keadue and Ballyfarnon. The village lies close to the shores of Lough Allen. There is a long association with the coal mining industry, carried out for over 400 years until the mines closed in 1990. Etymology Arigna is an english corruption of , meaning \\"the plundering\\", an adjective for the Arigna river - , the \\"plundering river\\". The gaelic name for Arigna was ' (\\"Carn Analt\\"). > \` \\".. Carn Analt in the valley of the Arigna river two and a half miles from > the southern shore of the lake\\". \\"fifteen layers of soil and rock that form > Cearn Alta\\". \\"Cearn Alta which is probably 1000 feet high\\". \` Cairn means \\"pile of rocks\\", and Ailt (also: ailt, alt) means \\"the steep-sided glen, height, cliff\\". Arigna coal mining The Arigna Coal Mine is famous for its very shallow deposits. Seams of culm were worked by miners lying on their sides to shovel the coal out. Mining lasted until 1990, and the coal was used for iron works and later for a power plant. With the demolition of the ESB Generating Station chimney, the era of collieries in the area ended. The mining history at Arigna started in the Middle Ages with the mining of iron here, and at Sliabh an Iarainn. At the beginning of the 17th century, the iron was smelted at Arigna in new built iron works, using charcoal, which was burnt from the wood of the forests around. But as no organised tree planting took place and the timber eventually ran out, the iron works had to be closed at the end of the 17th century. More than half a century later, in 1765, the mining of the coal deposits started, and again 30 years later the smelting was revived using the local coal instead of charcoal. This iron works closed finally in 1838, as they were not very successful. Demand for fuel in Dublin drove the industrial and economic development in the region. In 1790s Dublin, years of rising fuel inflation had driven the price of coal to 36-40 shillings per ton, causing \\"very great distress\\" to the inhabitants of Dublin. The completion of the Royal Canal allowed for the supply and sale of Arigna coal at 10 shillings per ton. New towns and villages emerged. Drumshanbo has its origin in these industries. Coal mining continued and provided work for the people in the area. The coal was used to heat homes and hospitals, and to power steam engines. In 1958 the Arigna Power Station was opened to produce electricity. It was the first major power generating station in Connacht. The station was built specifically to burn the semi bituminous coal with its high ash content. At its height, the power station burned 55,000 tonnes of coal per year and employed 60 people. Like in other coal mining areas of Europe, the main goal of this power station was to secure the jobs in the local mining industry. During the internationalization process of the mid-20th century, foreign coal from much bigger and easier to mine deposits became much cheaper than local coal. At the end of the 1980s, the power station was shut down, and without its main buyer the mine closed in 1990. Because of the thin coal seams, a special type of mining was practised at Arigna. A main tunnel was driven from which branched a series of secondary tunnels every 5‚Äì6 meters, where the coal was mined. The secondary tunnels followed the seams and were rather low. The miners typically worked lying on their back to cut the coal. These 'Cutters' or 'Brushers' also prepared the mine for the next day's work, and extended the roads using explosives. 'Drawers' filled hutches (tubs) and pushed them out to the main underground mine road. Here the hutches were linked up to an endless-rope haulage system and were pulled to the outside. Sometimes small diesel locomotives were used to pull hutches out of the pit. 'Proppers' used timber pillars to prop up the mine roof. =Life inside the Mines= In his memoir, The Home Place, author Brian Leyden gives a description of life in the mines and describes the conditions in which the miners worked: \\"The coal mines were often tiny by the standard of most industrialised countries. The men often had to lie on their backs in water, using a handpick or short-handled shovel to get at a thin seam of coal under a ledge of rock.\\" Leyden describes how a religious picture was placed at the pit entrance and that the \\"coal-miners blessed themselves at this spot before they went underground. Strangers who visited the mines out of curiosity often found the experience of the mineshaft so frightening they never got past the picture\\". =Preservation= Water feature at entrance to Arigna mining Experience The Arigna Mining Experience consists of an exhibition and an optional underground tour. The underground tour is guided by former miners, who are able to answer many questions on the coal mining process. This tour is a little difficult for some, as the mine is often somewhat low. There is no need to fear going down into the mine as the entrance and the whole mine tour is on a single flat level and wheelchair accessible. Visitor get hard hats to protect their heads. Lighting and sound effects throughout the mine are intended to add to the authenticity of the experience.

Publication history Captain Nazi first appeared in Master Comics #21 (Dec 1941) and was created by William Woolfolk and Mac Raboy. Fictional character biography =Fawcett Comics= The super-strong Captain Nazi was genetically altered by his scientist father, and developed into the \\"perfect specimen\\" in order to fight for Adolf Hitler and the Axis Powers during World War II. He is given superhuman strength and stamina, and a special flying gas allows him to fly. He is sent to battle American superheroes by the Nazis after his power is demonstrated to them by Adolf Hitler, and some of the heroes are shown. Nazi first appeared in Master Comics #21 (December 1941), in opposition to both Captain Marvel and Bulletman.Master Comics #21. Fawcett Comics. During the second half of his battle with Marvel in Whiz Comics #25 (published the same month), Nazi attacks two innocent bystanders who happened to be fishing near the scene of the battle, after they pull him out of the lake, and he escapes in their boat. One of them, an old man named Jacob Freeman, is killed, but the old man's teenage grandson Freddy Freeman is saved by Captain Marvel. Although he is crippled and his back broken with a hit from an oar while Nazi escapes in the boat. Due to Captain Marvel bestowing part of his power to him, Freddy becomes Captain Marvel Jr. He is then sent to defeat Captain Nazi by Captain Marvel.Whiz Comics #25. DC Comics. Junior, crippled in his Freddy Freeman form by the attack, continues to hold a vendetta against Nazi, and the two frequently battle one another. Nazi also serves as a member of Mister Mind's Monster Society of Evil, one of the most powerful organisations of villains in the world which included Adolf Hitler, and assists their first plan to steal magic fortune-telling pearls from a princess, leading Captain Marvel to their hideout, and revealing their existence, during the World War II years, before making his final Fawcett Comics appearance in Captain Marvel, Jr. #14 in 1944. =DC Comics= Captain Marvel, Jr. and Captain Nazi on the cover of The Power of Shazam! #19 (1996). Art by Jerry Ordway. Captain Nazi appeared only sporadically in DC Comics' 1970s/1980s revival of the Marvel Family characters under the title Shazam!, save for reprints of the original Fawcett stories. Nazi's first appearance in a new DC Comics story was in Shazam! #34 (March- April 1978). Following writer Roy Thomas and artist Tom Mandrake's new interpretation of the Captain Marvel mythos in the 1987 four-issue miniseries Shazam!: The New Beginning, Captain Nazi was re-introduced in a 1988 four-part story in Action Comics Weekly issues #623-626. Captain Nazi himself, however, only appeared in #624-626. The story was written by Thomas and his wife Dann Thomas, with art by Rick Stasi and Rick Magyar. The new Captain Nazi is a young Neo-Nazi named Lester Abernathy. Abernathy is given his \\"Captain Nazi\\" powers, costume and codename by a Neo-Nazi organization called the Sons of Valhalla and battles Captain Marvel.http://www.comics.org/issue/45162/ Action Comics Weekly #623 at the Grand Comics Databasehttp://www.comics.org/issue/45178/ Action Comics Weekly #624 at the Grand Comics Databasehttp://www.comics.org/issue/45295/ Action Comics Weekly #625 at the Grand Comics Databasehttp://www.comics.org/issue/45299/ Action Comics Weekly #626 at the Grand Comics Database This version of the character made no further appearances and was subsequently retconned out of existence by the 1994 The Power of Shazam! graphic novel, which again altered Captain Marvel's background and continuity. Captain Nazi was introduced into the modern DC Universe in Jerry Ordway's The Power of Shazam! series in 1995. In the modern series, Nazi had been active during the 1940s, battling World War II-era heroes such as Bulletman, Minute-Man, and Spy Smasher, but placed himself in suspended animation in a chamber so that he could emerge in modern society and revive the Third Reich. He believed Hitler's body to be held in a similar chamber. Nazi's brother, scientist Wolf Krieger, and his granddaughter, a super-powered villainess named Madame Libertine who possesses mind-controlling powers, carry on Nazi's legacy in the 1990s and resurrect their hero from his suspended animation chamber in Power of Shazam! #5. Issues #6-8 of the Power of Shazam series retell the story of Nazi's murder of Freddy's grandfather by throwing him a great distance with his superhuman strength, his crippling of Freddy, and Freddy's emergence as Marvel, Jr. and attempted revenge on Nazi. His life was actually saved by Freddy who believed the figure who fell into the lake was Captain Marvel, who had just knocked him into the lake. After the Marvel Family captures and defeats Nazi, he is sent to Europe to be tried for war crimes committed during World War II.Power of Shazam #6-8. DC Comics. Captain Nazi eventually joins Lex Luthor's new Secret Society of Super Villains as seen in the miniseries Villains United, where he works with them to torture the Secret Six. He is blinded during the escape of the Secret Six when Catman plunges syringes into his eyes. Captain Nazi meets his apparent end in Batman #647 while fighting Batman and the Red Hood. The Captain, now sporting cybernetic eyes following his injury in Villains United, has been lent out to the villain Black Mask to assassinate the Red Hood alongside fellow Society members Deathstroke, Count Vertigo, and Hyena. During the fight, the Red Hood apparently kills Captain Nazi by jamming a taser-like weapon into his cybernetic eyes (the only vulnerable part of his body).Batman #647. DC Comics. In Villains United Special #1 however, it is revealed that Nazi has survived. At the behest of the Society, Nazi appeared in Kahndaq to release all of the captives in its prisons and fights Khandaq's ruler and former Secret Society member, Black Adam. During the battle, Black Adam confronts Nazi about how he seemingly survived being killed, at which time Captain Nazi cryptically proclaims that previous origins about him were wrong and that the villain is not even human; that he is the living avatar of National Socialism given physical form and that so long as there are Nazis in existence, he will exist. Captain Nazi was able to stalemate Black Adam in the battle afterwards.Villains United Special #1. DC Comics. He has since appeared as leader of a Nazi-themed team in Justice Society of America named \\"The Fourth Reich\\" after the \\"One Year Later\\" jump, and is an opponent of Wonder Woman in 'The Circle', sporting a generic black costume. In September 2011, DC Comics engaged in a line-wide revision of its superhero comics, including their stories and characters' fictional histories, known as The New 52. In the new stories, Captain Nazi first appears in the \\"Superman\\" storyline \\"Savage Dawn\\" in \\"Superman vol. 3 Annual #3\\". In 1941, Captain Nazi is genetically engineered to serve in Hitler's Aerospace program. Vandal Savage successfully convinces the Third Reich to build a rocket that Captain Nazi will use to pilot himself and Vandal Savage into outer space to collect a larger sample of the meteor that gave Savage his powers. When the ship faces turbulence, Captain Nazi opts to land instead of going forward with the mission. After a crash landing, an enraged Vandal Savage beats him until he stops moving.Superman Annual Vol. 3 #3. DC Comics. Other versions =Flashpoint= In the alternate timeline of the Flashpoint event, Captain Nazi is a member of the H.I.V.E. council and represents Germany. He voted for using nuclear weapons to end the war in Western Europe between Aquaman and Wonder Woman. He appears much older here, possibly because he was not placed in suspended animation.Flashpoint: The World of Flashpoint #1 (June 2011). DC Comics. In other media In an episode of the TV show Justice League Unlimited, Captain Nazi made a round-about appearance. During a flashback sequence, a character who looks very similar to Captain Nazi is prevented from taking a super-soldier serum by Fawcett Comics hero Spy Smasher. It is later revealed that the serum was created for \\"Project Captain Nazi\\". General Wade Eiling broke into Cadmus Labs and injected himself with the serum. He then went on a rampage in Metropolis. Seeking a battle with Superman, Eiling was instead confronted by seven members of the Justice League: Green Arrow, Speedy, Stargirl, S.T.R.I.P.E., Shining Knight, Vigilante and the Crimson Avenger (the line-up was roughly equivalent to that of DC Comics' Golden Age team \\"the Seven Soldiers of Victory\\"). In an episode of the TV show Legends of Tomorrow, Andr√© Eriksen portrayed Baron Albrecht Krieger/Captain Nazi in the second season episode \\"The Justice Society of America\\". He is an ally of Eobard Thawne and acquired a sample of a biomolecular enhancer (the same that changed Nate Heywood into Steel) from the Reverse Flash to transform into a bezerker-monstrous self-proclaimed \\"√úbermensch\\" to fight the JSA and the time- travelling Legends.

In the past, the company made shotguns, derringers and revolvers based in Madison, North Carolina (formerly based in North Haven, Connecticut). Marlin owned the firearm manufacturer H&R; Firearms. In 2007, Remington Arms, part of the Remington Outdoor Company, acquired Marlin Firearms. Remington produced Marlin-brand firearms at its Kentucky and New York manufacturing facilities. In 2020, Sturm, Ruger & Co. bought the Company from bankrupt Remington Outdoor Company. History Marlin gun mounted on De Havilland airplane, 1921 Marlin Firearms was founded in the 1870s by John Marlin. Marlin produced a large assortment of firearms such as lever-action rifles, pump-action shotguns and single shot rifles. Marlin was considered the main competitor to Winchester. In World War I Marlin became one of the largest machine gun producers in the world for the US and its Allies, building the M1895 Colt‚ÄìBrowning machine gun and a later variant called the \\"Marlin gun\\" optimized for aircraft use. In 1917 Marlin Rockwell bought out the Hopkins & Allen Arms Company to promote an expanded line of firearms and restore the image of the Marlin company as makers of \\"sporting arms\\". Marlin Firearms labored for a century as an underdog levergun maker to Winchester (formerly of New Haven). However, in the 1980s and 1990s, Marlin finally began to outpace its old rival. It is currently the dominant seller of lever-action rifles in North America. Its use of side ejection allows for flat-topped firearms, thereby making the mounting of scopes easier than for traditional Winchesters. This helped Marlin capture more market share as American shooters came to rely more and more on optics. Marlins are larger, stronger and heavier than most of the comparable Winchester line, allowing Marlin to use higher powered cartridges such as the .45-70. Marlin's model 1894 lever-action rifles and carbines are available in handgun calibers, including .357 Magnum, .44 Magnum and .41 Magnum, making them suitable companion long guns for revolvers in those calibers.

Ballard rifled barrels have grooves generally in the range of .069‚Äì.090\\" wide, and .0015‚Äì.003\\" deep. This change was marketed in the 1954 Marlin catalog, as having numerous advantages that this new form of rifling had, including better accuracy, ease of cleaning, elimination of gas leakage, higher velocities and lower chamber pressures. The catalog also claimed that Microgroove rifling did not distort the bullet jacket as deeply as Ballard rifling hence improving accuracy with jacketed bullets at standard velocity. Designed for factory loaded ammunition, Microgroove barrels have a reputation for accuracy problems with centerfire ammunition handloaded with cast lead bullets due to the increased bore diameter generated by the shallow grooves. The use of oversized cast bullets greatly solves this problem, restoring accuracy with cast bullet handloads to levels seen from Ballard rifled barrels.Glen E. Fryxell, \\"Marlin's Microgroove Barrels\\", Leverguns.com, source cited: William S. Brophy, \\"Marlin Firearms: A History of the Guns and the Company That Made Them\\", Stackpole Books, 1989. Early Marlin .30-30 microgroove barrels had a twist rate of 1 turn in 10 inches optimized for factory ammunition with jacketed bullets; later Marlin .30-30 microgroove barrels show a twist rate of 1 turn in 10.5 inches which improves accuracy with cartridges loaded to lower velocity than standard.  Acquisitions  In November 2000, Marlin purchased the assets of H&R; 1871, Inc., a Massachusetts-based manufacturer of shotguns and rifles (New England Firearms branded), founded in 1871, and now located in Gardner, Massachusetts. Marketing its products under the brand names of Harrington & Richardson and New England Firearms, H&R; 1871 claimed to be the largest manufacturer of Single-shot shotguns and rifles in the world. In December 2007 Remington Arms Company purchased Marlin.‚ÄúGunmaker Remington to buy Marlin Firearms‚Äù USA Today, December 27, 2007 Remington announced in April 2008 that it would close the Gardner manufacturing plant by the end of 2008 affecting 200 workers.Arms Manufacturer Remington Closing Gardner Plant WBZTV, April 7, 2008 In March 2010, Marlin announced that it would close its North Haven plant, and move the work to Remington plants in Ilion, New York, and Mayfield, Kentucky.

It is located between Athlone and Roscommon town, near Lough Ree on the River Shannon. It is one of the closest populations centres to the geographical centre of Ireland. History =Name= The village lies at the foot of a stony ridge, which protects it from the east wind that sweeps in from Galey Bay. This accounts for the original name of the village, 'An Creag√°n', meaning 'the stoney hill'. During Oliver Cromwell's conquest of Connacht in 1650-1652, Sir Charles Coote laid siege to Galey Castle, the seat of the √ì Ceallaigh clan. The √ì Ceallaighs resisted, and for their defiance, they were taken to An Creag√°n and hanged on the stepped hill just north of the village, now commonly known as Hangman's Hill. The village thereafter came to be known as ‚ÄòCnoc an Chrochaire,‚Äô 'the Hill of the Hanging', now Anglicised as ‚ÄòKnockcroghery‚Äô.Knockcroghery Village Design Statement 2008, page 3 =Burning of Knockcroghery= In the early hours of 19 June 1921, the Black and Tans set Knockcroghery village alight. It was an act of vengeance for the killing of a British general in Glassan two days previously by the Westmeath Volunteers. British intelligence agents mistakenly believed that the killers had come across Lough Ree from the Galey Bay/Knockcroghery area. The Black and Tans arrived in four lorries and parked at St. Patrick's Church. Reportedly drunk and dressed in civilian clothing, they put masks on their faces, fired shots into the air and ordered the people out of their homes. They easily set fire to the thatched roofs of the cottages, using petrol. They were less successful in setting Murray's, Flanagan's and the presbytery alight, due to their slated roofs. Having no time to take their possessions with them, the people rushed from their houses onto the street, still in their nightshirts.Healy, P., God Save All Here (1999) at p.21.Roscommon People, 24 June 2016, at p. 39 Canon Bartholomew Kelly refused to leave his house, until the Black and Tans began dousing his furniture with petrol. He jumped out of his bedroom window onto a shed twelve feet below, and hid himself until they had left. His slate roof saved his house from being totally destroyed.Roscommon People, 24 June 2016, at p. 39 Unable to set Murray's roof alight, the Black and Tans set fire to the back door. John Murray reacted quickly to put the fire out, saving the house. The occupants of the thatched houses did not have this opportunity, and their houses burned to the ground very quickly. Michael O'Callaghan described the scene: \\"the raiding forces drove up and down the village, firing shots at random, cursing loudly, and laughing at the plight of the people of Knockcroghery. The people were terrified, particularly the children, whose cries of fear added to the terrible scene.\\"O'Callaghan, M., For Ireland and Freedom. The flames above Knockcroghery alerted the people for miles around to what had happened, and by daylight, the street was full of people.Healy, P. God Save All Here (1999) at p.21. On the evening of the burning, there had been fifteen houses on the main street of Knockcroghery, most of them single- storey thatched cottages. By the following morning, all but four had been burned to the ground.Roscommon People, 24 June 2016, at p. 39 Jamesie Murray remembered the assistance given to the now homeless people of Knockcroghery: \\"They came from all over to help. People brought clothes, and a fund was soon set up. The families who were now homeless were accommodated in the vicinity, many staying with relatives who lived nearby. Farm sheds were converted into temporary dwellings. Canon Kelly and others found temporary accommodation with Knockcroghery's Church of Ireland rector, Canon Humphries.O'Callaghan, M. \\"For Ireland and Freedom: Roscommon's Contribution to the Fight for Irish Independence\\" (1964) Later, three or four new cottages were built on the Shrah road and given to bachelors, who then took people in.\\"Healy, P. God Save All Here (1999) at p.21. The village was rebuilt over the next few years, with help from government grants. The rebuilding provided employment locally, at a time when it was needed. =Terror at the fair= In November 1920, an RIC constable named Potter, who was stationed in Kiltoom, was cycling with another constable from Roscommon to Kiltoom. Constable Potter was shot dead on the Athlone side of Knockcroghery railway station. A few days later, while a fair was going on in Knockcroghery, a party of Black and Tans arrived in the village, and in an act of retaliation, rounded up all the men into the handball alley and beat them with bull whips. The Black and Tans seized some tins of paint from a local shop and forced the men to paint over a tricolour that had been painted onto the wall of the handball alley some time previously. They then forced the men to place their hands onto the wet paint and then put their hands into their pockets and wipe them on their clothes.O'Callaghan, M. \\"For Ireland and Freedom: Roscommon's Contribution to the Fight for Irish Independence\\" (1964) =Catholic parish of Knockcroghery= Prior to the 1870s, what is now the parish of Knockcroghery was two separate parishes: Kilinvoy and Kilmaine. The church in Killinvoy was built around the 1810s, when the Penal Laws were being relaxed. It ceased to be used as a church in 1883 but continues to be used as a community centre to this day, and is known as Culleen Hall. The church in Kilmaine was a very old, small thatched building. After it ceased to be used as a church, it was demolished and is now the site of Ballymurray National School. In the early 1870s, the parishes of Killinvoy and Kilmaine were merged into the parish of St Patrick, Knockcroghery. In the mid-1870s, a decision was made to build a new, more centrally-located church. Lord Crofton of Mote Park gave a site on the Southern edge of Knockcroghery for a nominal rent of a shilling per year. Construction work commenced in 1879 and St Patrick's Church was consecrated on 18 October 1885.Roscommon Messenger, 3 October 1885Roscommon Messenger, 24 October 1885 The cost of construction was ¬£3,000, of which, ¬£1,313 remained outstanding at the time of consecration. Donations were received following an appeal in the sermon at the consecration, which assisted in paying down the debt of the construction.Roscommon Messenger, 3 October 1885Roscommon Messenger, 24 October 1885 Roscommon Messenger, 7 November 1885 The churches in Culleen and Ballymurray closed down, but many of the parishioners of Ballymurray refused to transfer to Knockcroghery, and continued attending the old Ballymurray church at mass time every Sunday to say the Rosary until it was demolished in 1886.Coyne, F. (2000) Roscommon Historical and Archaeological Society Journal: St Patrick's Church, Knockcroghery Economy Knockcroghey clay pipe or \\"D√∫id√≠n\\" For over 250 years the village was famous for the production of the tobacco clay pipe, or \\"D√∫id√≠n\\". By the late 1800s there were up to 100 people involved in the manufacture and distribution of the village‚Äôs clay pipes. Production ceased abruptly on 19 June 1921 when the village was burned down by the Black and Tans during the Irish War of Independence. Today, a visitor centre and workshop are located on the original site of Andrew and P.J. Curley‚Äôs pipe factory, where pipes are handcrafted using the original methods of production. The clay-pipe visitors centre is located in the middle of the village and sells clay-pipes and other hand- crafted souvenirs. Until the late 20th century, the village contained a number of shops, a butcher's, a chemist, a florist, a petrol station, a post office, four public houses, a railway station and a garda station. With the rise of the private motor car and the associated convenient access to larger towns, many of these businesses and services have closed. Today, there remain three public houses, a post office and a hairdresser's.

Architecture Much of the architecture of the village centre dates from the 1920s, when the village was rebuilt after the burning by the Black and Tans. Some buildings, such as the church, the community centre, the parochial house, Murray's and the Widow Pat's, predate this however. The village's Anglican church was dismantled in the 1970s, the stone being reused to build a church elsewhere. The site formerly occupied by the Anglican church was subsequently occupied by a petrol station. The former rectory associated with the Anglican church remains standing, opposite the post office. =Saint Patrick's Catholic Church= St. Patrick's Church (Roman Catholic) St. Patrick's Catholic Church is an example of late nineteenth-century ecclesiastical design. It features a two-stage bell tower with pinnacles and a more recently added copper spire. It was built commencing in 1879, with the church being consecrated on 18 October 1885.Roscommon Messenger, 3 October 1885Roscommon Messenger, 24 October 1885Coyne, F. (2000) Roscommon Historical and Archaeological Society Journal: St Patrick's Church, Knockcroghery In the early 1950s, the tower and spire were completed, the bell was installed and the choir gallery was built. At the same time, repair works were carried out, the church was replastered internally and wiring for electric lighting and heating was installed in anticipation of the arrival of rural electrification. In the meantime, lighting was provided by a petrol-powered generator.Coyne, F. (2000) Roscommon Historical and Archaeological Society Journal: St Patrick's Church, Knockcroghery The carved limestone baptismal font in St Patrick's Church came from the old church in Ballymurray (now the site of Ballymurray National School). It was initially used as a holy water font inside the front door before being moved to its current location beside the altar to be used as a baptismal font. The smaller carved limestone holy water font, which is built into the wall inside the tower door, is believed to have come from the old church in Culleen (now Cullen Hall). The stained glass windows on the Eastern side of the church depict the history of the church in Ireland, including the old thatched church in Ballymurray.Coyne, F. (2000) Roscommon Historical and Archaeological Society Journal: St Patrick's Church, Knockcroghery People Knockcroghery is the home of Roscommon's All-Ireland Football Championship winning captain Jimmy Murray (5 May 1917 ‚Äì 23 January 2007). He captained Roscommon to their only two All-Ireland Senior Football title wins in 1943 and 1944. He was also captain in their 1946 final and replay against Kerry. As the 1943 final also went to a replay, he is the only man to have captained a team in five All-Ireland senior football finals. Events and culture Knockcroghery Fair was a festival held annually, generally on the third weekend of September, until 2013. The Galey Bay Regatta, an annual yachting regatta, was held from 1872 until 1913 by the Lords Crofton, who owned a boathouse on Galey Bay of Lough Ree adjoining Galey castle. Many visiting house boats were anchored in the bay during the regatta. The yachts varied from 25-ton cutters to 18-foot spritsail lake boats. The regattas were the idea of Edward Crofton and his brother Alfred. After most of the lands had been sold to the adjoining farmers, the Croftons left the area and the regattas were no more. The Croftons were supported in organising the regattas by enthusiasts who came both from Lough Ree Yacht Club and Lough Derg. Lord Crofton was always the chairman of the organising committee. Peadar Kearney, writer of The Soldier's Song (Amhr√°n na bhFiann), also penned the song \\"Knockcroghery\\", when he was challenged to find a word to rhyme with the village's name. His success in rhyming \\"Molly Doherty\\" with \\"Knockcroghery\\" is open to debate. The traditional Irish phrase, \\"f√°ilte U√≠ Cheallaigh\\" (an O'Kelly welcome) dates from December 1351 when Uilliam Bu√≠ √ì Ceallaigh (the Taoiseach of U√≠ Mh√°ine, a kingdom that roughly covered what is now East County Galway and South County Roscommon) invited the poets, writers and artists of Ireland to a great feast at his home, Gailey Castle.√ì Conghaile, M. (2018) \\"Colourful Irish Phrases\\" The feast reportedly lasted for a month. It was during this feast that the famous poet, Gofraidh Fionn √ì D√°laigh, wrote the poem, Filidh √âireann go hAointeach, which remembers the great feast.https://www.jstor.org/stable/30007554?seq=1https://bardic.celt.dias.ie/pdf/POEM932.pdfhttps://bardic.celt.dias.ie Transport Knockcroghery railway station opened on 13 February 1860 and finally closed on 17 June 1963. Roscommon railway station is now the nearest station and is located 10 km from Knockcroghery village. It is on the Westport-Dublin line, also serving indirect routes to Ballina, Galway and Ennis. Knockcroghery is served by Bus √âireann's Route 21 (Westport-Athlone), with indirect routes to Galway, Dublin and other towns. The village is situated on the main N61 road between Athlone and Roscommon towns, and near the M6 Galway-Dublin motorway.

Early years Opdycke was born on a farm in Hubbard, Ohio, to a military family. His father fought in the War of 1812 and his grandfather was a captain in New Jersey militia in the American Revolution. His older brother Henry served in the Kansas cavalry during the Civil War. Opdycke was educated in the Hubbard schools. He engaged in various business pursuits in Ohio and California. Civil War Opdycke enlisted immediately following the First Battle of Bull Run and was commissioned a first lieutenant in the 41st Ohio Infantry on August 26, 1861. As a captain, he fought in the Battle of Shiloh. He resigned in September 1862 to help recruit the 125th Ohio Infantry, in which he became the lieutenant colonel on October 1, 1862, and the colonel on January 14, 1863. His regiment earned fame in the defense of Horseshoe Ridge at the Battle of Chickamauga. In command of a demi-brigade, Opdycke's men were some of the first to reach the summit of Missionary Ridge during the Battles for Chattanooga. He fought throughout the Atlanta Campaign with the Army of the Cumberland and was badly wounded at the Battle of Resaca, but he recovered sufficiently to lead an assault in the Battle of Kennesaw Mountain.Warner, p. 349. During the Franklin-Nashville Campaign, Opdycke distinguished himself at the Battle of Franklin. As the Confederate troops under Lt. Gen. John Bell Hood approached, his division commander, Brig. Gen. George D. Wagner, ordered Opdycke and the other two brigade commanders to take up hasty defensive positions in front of the Union fortified line. Opdycke challenged this order, argued with Wagner, and marched his men into a reserve position behind the fortifications. When the Confederate assault broke the Union line near the Columbia Pike, Opdycke quickly redeployed his men into line of battle, straddling the road, and they were confronted by masses of fleeing Union soldiers, pursued by Confederates. Opdycke ordered his brigade forward to the works. At the same time, his corps commander, Maj. Gen. David S. Stanley, arrived on the scene. He later wrote, \\"I saw Opdycke near the center of his line urging his men forward. I gave the Colonel no orders as I saw him engaged in doing the very thing to save us, to get possession of our line again.\\" The counterattack turned the tide and the Union Army achieved an important victory.Jacobson, pp. 319-28, 332-34. Opdycke was honored for his service at Franklin with a brevet appointment to major general of volunteers. He was promoted to a full brigadier general on July 26, 1865.Eicher, p. 409. Postbellum life Opdycke resigned from the army in 1866 and moved to New York City, where he engaged in the dry goods business. He wrote several articles on the war, and was active in veterans affairs. He died in New York at the age of 54 of an accidental gunshot to the abdomen, apparently while he was cleaning the weapon. He is buried in Oakwood Cemetery in Warren, Ohio. See also *List of American Civil War generals (Union) Notes References * Eicher, John H., and David J. Eicher. Civil War High Commands.

It was the home of Douglas Hyde, the first President of Ireland. The nearby French Park Estate was until 1952 the ancestral seat of the French family, Barons de Freyne. The estate was sold to the Irish Land Commission in the 1950s and was dismantled by the mid 1970s. A historic smokehouse is one of the few remaining legacies of this period. The mayor of Frenchpark became John Mac Dermott in 2010- present Frenchpark, winter time  History  = Early Irish history = Frenchpark - The Ciarrage groups here were the early lords of Airteach. Mac Donagh is cited as later lords of Airtech. The O'Flanagan here were hereditary stewards to the Kings of Connacht. =Early 13th Century= Dominican Priory of the Holy Cross, Cloonshanville. This was sacked during the Cromwellian campaign of the 1650s. Part of the tower still stands (in a ruined state). The site is still used as the local cemetery. Cloonshanville Dominican Priory =17th ‚Äì 20th Century= The French family, originally from Galway, became the dominant landowners in this part of Roscommon in the late seventeenth century. Dominick French was granted 5000 acres of land in County Roscommon and his son John a further 2000 acres. John's wealth and influence were such that he was nicknamed An Tiarna Mor (the Great Lord). =The Barons de Freyne, former owners of Frenchpark= In the 1749 Census of Elphin it was the residence of Arthur French, MP in the Parliament of Ireland who was the eldest son of John (An Tiarna Mor) and his wife Anne Gore. His son Arthur French (1764-1820) was also an MP who was said to have died \\"from excessive fox hunting\\". His son, also named Arthur French (1786‚Äì1856), became the first Baron de Freyne. Members of the French family were buried in the graveyard surrounding the ruins of Frenchpark Priory. At the time of Griffith's Valuation Frenchpark was owned by Rev. John Ffrench, Lord de Freyne and was valued at ¬£60. Later in the 1800s the family converted to Roman Catholicism. =Frenchpark House= The ancestral seat of the Barons de Freyne was the French Park Estate, County Roscommon. The manor house, originally built in the mid-17th century before being rebuilt in the Georgian style in the 18th century was demolished after the sale of the estate by the 7th Baron de Freyne to the Irish Land Commission in 1952. The Land Commission removed the roof of the buildings in 1953 and eventually demolished the remaining structures in ca 1975. The present Lord de Freyne lives with his wife and family at Putney in the London Borough of Wandsworth. A distant cousin of the de Freynes was Charlotte Despard (n√©e French) (1844‚Äì1939), a scion of the French family of High Lake, a British- born, later Irish-based suffragist, novelist and Sinn F√©in activist.French family cousinage on-line Despard spent a lot of time at French Park where her father was born. In 1908 she joined with Hanna Sheehy-Skeffington and Margaret Cousins to form the Irish Women‚Äôs Franchise League. She urged members to boycott the 1911 Census and withhold taxes and provided financial support to workers during the Dublin labour disputes. In 1909 Despard met Mahatma Gandhi and was influenced for a time by his theory of passive resistance. She moved to Dublin after World War I and was bitterly critical of her brother, Field Marshal The Viscount French, the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland in 1919-21, who, unsurprisingly, tended to ignore her. During the Irish War of Independence, together with Maud Gonne, she formed the Women's Prisoners' Defence League to support Republican prisoners. As a member of Cumann na mBan she opposed the Anglo-Irish Treaty, and was imprisoned by the new Government of the Irish Free State during the Irish Civil War. She is buried in the Republican Plot at Glasnevin Cemetery, Dublin. =Market House= The market house is in the center of Frenchpark, on the main street and is very old. The market house was a place where people went to sell their cattle and farm produce (vegetables, potatoes and oats). On market day, which was always on a Thursday, they would trade, buy and sell. There was a large weighing scales outside the building. Unsold goods were stored in the building. The first electricity was generated for Frenchpark from this building. A film was made in the market house about 'The Hanging of Robert Emmett'. The building is now empty and is surrounded by high railings.

A free, limited version is available for online play at many sites or the full version with no time restrictions can be purchased online. The goal of Lemonade Tycoon is to sell lemonade for profit. The last update (1.1.9) was renamed Lemonade Tycoon Deluxe. In 2009, Electronic Arts published an iPhone version of Lemonade Tycoon. Lemonade Tycoon 2: New York Edition is also available on Mac OS X, published by MacPlay. While selling lemonade, players must look over many aspects of their business. Players decide on a recipe, set prices, and sell lemonade in a variety of locations. The game includes changing weather and news, which the player must compensate for. To overcome some factors, such as long lines and stock, players can buy upgrades. The packaged version included versions for PC, Mobile Phones, Windows Mobile Professional devices, and Palm devices. The game allows players to transfer game saves from a Windows PC to a Palm handheld or Windows Mobile Professional device and back again to continue. Lemonade Tycoon has similarities to Lemonade Stand, a computer game originally created for the Minnesota Educational Computing Consortium in 1973 and later ported by Apple Computer for use with its then-new Apple II platform in 1979. The game also required players to make businesses decisions based upon weather, customers, and cost/availability of stock. Gameplay = Game Modes = Lemonade Tycoon includes three game modes; Career, Challenge and Champion. Career mode lets the player have a stand for as long as they want. Challenge mode had a 30-day limit to see how fast your stand can grow within the period of time.  Stocks/Supplies  In order to be able to sell lemonade, players have to buy supplies, which include ice, lemons, sugar, and cups.  Sales and Advertisement  The player has the option to advertise in Lemonade Tycoon. Every day, the player can pay an advertising fee with different choices in advertising being available. Advertising increases the number of potential customers.  Upgrades  Lemonade Tycoon features many upgrades that are available at different prices. Some reduce wait times, some improve visibility, some make ice, etc. Stand upgrades allow more storage and customer capacity. There are also employees, a cashier, and a clown, which charge daily for reducing wait times and increasing patience, respectively.  Locations  There are five different locations where one can move your stand. Some places are more popular than others. Each location has a different rent. Each location has satisfaction and popularity. Popularity changes as the player's stand gets more popular. Good satisfaction and advertising bring more customers. Satisfaction ensures that customers will come back to the stand. If there are short lines, there are good prices, the player serves all customers rather than them leaving, and the player has a good recipe, the player's customer satisfaction will go up. With the increase of satisfaction, customers will come back to a player's stand. Satisfaction and popularity are location based. They do not travel with you as you move from location to location.

In England and Wales the term is defunct and in Scotland it has very long been a sub-type of the Scottish legal version of servitudes, which are what English law calls easements. However covenants and equitable servitudes in most of the jurisdictions across North America, are slightly different. The usual distinction is based on the remedy plaintiff seeks and precedent will allow for the scenario in question. Where the terms are unmerged, holders of a covenant seek money damages; holders of equitable servitudes seek injunctions. The term used to exist in England widely before Tulk v Moxhay and as byproduct of the Judicature Acts became one of the fullest mergers of equity and common law in England and Wales so as to agree initially on the term \\"equitable covenant\\", then coming to be united in the term covenant save that \\"equitable\\" bears a particular meaning in English property rights since at least 1925: it means not fully compliant with registration/written formalities. If lacks legally routine formalities it is not a full legal covenant and therefore more tenuous, often only enforceable personally and against the original covenantor (in personam). Equitable servitude remains conceptually unaltered from its original core meaning however in many derived jurisdictions today. It describes wherever a party is in a non-criminal way forbidden from certain use (of land) in such a way as for breach to justify prohibitory or mandatory action to be ordered by the court. The term usually applies only to permanent restrictions, others may more commonly branded rules, terms of use, private byelaws or restrictions. The first example was wherever there was an enclave, the land owner would forever, while it is necessary, enjoy an implied positive servitude over the intervening land. In England and Wales that scenario is almost exclusively expressed in terms of implied easements in modern parlance. In the United States, negative and affirmative equitable servitudes remain a live legal concept in their own right. It is a covenant that equity will enforce in equity, rather than in the common law, against the successors of the burdened land who have notice of the covenant. If such notice is by constructive knowledge, such as the enquiries an ordinary purchaser ought to have made, then the covenant is known as \\"implied\\".  Creation  An equitable servitude must be created by a writing, unless it is a negative equitable servitude that may be implied from a common scheme for the development of a residential subdivision, so long as landowners have notice of the agreement. Implied negative servitudes, however, are not recognized in some states, such as Massachusetts and California.  Burden  A successor of the promisor is bound if the original promise is in writing, the covenanting parties intended the servitude to be enforceable by and against assignees, the successor of the promisor has actual, inquiry (record), or constructive notice of the servitude, and the covenant touches and concerns the land.  Benefit  The benefit of an equitable servitude runs with the land and thus is enforceable by the promisee's successors if the original parties so intended, and the servitude touches and concerns the benefited property.  Equitable defenses  A court will not enforce an equitable servitude under the following circumstances: * The person seeking enforcement is violating a similar restriction on his own land (unclean hands). * The holder of the dominant estate acquiesced in violation of the servitude by the holder of the servient estate (acquiescence). * The holder of the dominant estate acted in such a way that would have a reasonable person to believe that the covenant was abandoned (estoppel). * The owner of the dominant estate fails to bring suit against the violator within a reasonable time (laches). * The character of the neighborhood changed sufficiently through development, changes in zoning, or through non-enforcement of the equitable servitude (called the \\"changed conditions\\" doctrine).

They first appeared in Whiz Comics #21 in 1941. The physical appearance of the three characters was based on three real-life members of the Fawcett Comics staff: Paul Peck (Tall Billy), Ed Hamilton (Hill Billy), and Frank Taggart (Fat Billy).C.C. Beck, \\"The Human Qualities of the Captain Marvel Characters\\" in Fawcett Companion, ed. P.C. Hamerlinck (Raleigh, NC: TwoMorrows Publishing, 2001), 28‚Äì29. Publication history The Lieutenants appeared periodically in the adventures of Captain Marvel and the Marvel Family through the early 1950s, and also when the characters were revived by DC Comics in the 1970s under the title Shazam!, although rarely. They were retconned out of existence during the Crisis on Infinite Earths in 1985. Some people, such as Jonathan Woodward in his Annotated Crisis on Infinite Earths website, suggest that the Lieutenant Marvels died in the last battle of the Crisis on Infinite Earths, although Who's Who in the DC Universe claims they survived but lost their powers. The characters were reintroduced in Trials of Shazam! #2 (2006), only to lose their powers in the same issue. They also appeared as inhabitants of Earth-5 in Grant Morrison's The Multiversity miniseries in 2015. Fictional team history Brooklyn, New York City, has its own Billy Batson, and he travels to the W.H.I.Z. radio station with two other Billy Batsons, one from the Western United States and one from the Southern United States, to visit the \\"real\\" Billy. To prevent confusion, the western Billy suggests he be called \\"Tall\\" Billy, the southern Billy is renamed \\"Hill\\" Billy and Brooklyn's Billy is given the title \\"Fat\\" Billy. At the \\"real\\" Billy's suggestion, all four Billys form the Billy Batson Club. Billy reveals he is Captain Marvel to them, and says they should only say \\"Shazam!\\" when he gives them a wink. The nefarious Dr. Sivana hatches a plan to kill the \\"real\\" Billy Batson and sends his three henchmen to find out where Billy lives. Sivana's goons mistakenly find the other Billy Batsons instead and capture them. The mysterious Captain Death captures Tall Billy, Nazi Agent Herr Geyer captures Fat Billy, and bandit \\"Biggy\\" Brix captures Hill Billy. Sivana uses them as bait to trap the real Billy after hearing he is their friend, having Brix deliver a note, and demanding he comes to the Mill as Billy. When this happens he is knocked out and captured. Sivana and his henchmen gag Billy and tie him and the other Billys to a log heading towards a buzzsaw, then leave. Billy is able to remove his gag on the buzzsaw, but his shout of \\"Shazam\\" can not be heard over the roar of the buzzsaw. With seconds to spare, Billy enlists the aid of his club members and they all shout \\"Shazam!\\" together. When the smoke clears, Captain Marvel sees that the other Billys have transformed as well, into Tall Marvel, Hill Marvel, and Fat Marvel. Hill Marvel remarks that they have each changed into Captain Marvel but Fat Marvel counters that by saying that there is only one Captain Marvel. Tall Marvel suggests that they are really Lieutenant Marvels, hence the trio's name. The Captain and his three Lieutenants easily defeat Sivana and his henchmen, knocking their plane down and apparently killing all the villains except Sivana. After shouting \\"Shazam!\\" and transforming back into their civilian identities, the three Billys head back home. The Lieutenants returned from time to time during the Fawcett Comics era to aid their hero. In Captain Marvel Adventures #4 they are again kidnapped by Sivana's henchmen. Captain Marvel follows the kidnappers to Sivana's base. The three Billys are tied up under three sharp pendulums. However Billy transforms with them and they defeat the henchmen. They hear a noise in a shed, and find Sivana's daughter Beautia bound and gagged inside. They release her and she reveals Sivana did this. They fly away before Sivana detonates tons of dynamite under the house, then defeat him. They were probably put in suspended animation until 1973, along with many Marvel characters, by the Sivanas. They make their first DC appearance in Shazam! #30, when the whole Marvel Family is called upon to destroy Sivana's steel menagerie, which is threatening to wreck Pittsburgh. The Lieutenant Marvels exist, without powers though still helping the Marvel Family to fight crime, on Earth-5, as seen in The Multiversity miniseries by writer Grant Morrison. Powers and abilities By shouting \\"Shazam!\\", the three Billy Batsons are transformed into the Lieutenant Marvels. In this form, they each have the powers of Captain Marvel: the wisdom of Solomon, the strength of Hercules, the stamina of Atlas, the power of Zeus, the courage of Achilles, and the speed of Mercury. Since they have to share the power, they are each only one-third as powerful as Captain Marvel. In other media =Film= In the direct-to-video animated film Justice League: Crisis on Two Earths, three superpowered henchmen with powers similar to the Marvels are employed by Superwoman, a criminal, parallel universe incarnation of Wonder Woman, and referred to as her Lieutenants. However, instead of the \\"classic\\" Lieutenant Marvels, the trio appear as criminal counterparts of Captain Marvel, Captain Marvel Jr., and Uncle Marvel (listed in the film's credits as, respectively, \\"Captain Super\\", \\"Captain Super Jr.\\", and \\"Uncle Super\\"). =Television= In the TV series Young Justice, Mary Batson and Freddy Freeman as Lieutenant Marvel and Sergeant Marvel joined the team during the five year jump but did not appear in the second season leaving the characters' fate unknown.

Cecil Price, et al., also known as the Mississippi Burning trial or Mississippi Burning case, was a criminal trial where the United States charged a group of 18 men with conspiring in a Ku Klux Klan plot to murder three young civil rights workers (Michael Schwerner, James Chaney, and Andrew Goodman) in Philadelphia, Mississippi on June 21, 1964 during Freedom Summer. The trial, conducted in Meridian, Mississippi with U.S. District Court Judge W. Harold Cox presiding, resulted in convictions of 7 of the 18 defendants. Initial proceedings Indictments were originally presented against 18 defendants, three of whom were officials of the Mississippi government, for conspiracy to commit as well as substantial violations of deprivation of rights secured or protected by the Constitution. The District Court initially dismissed the indictments, but the dismissal was unanimously reversed by the Supreme Court upon appeal. The trial then proceeded. The verdict Guilty verdicts were returned against: * Cecil Price, the chief deputy sheriff of Neshoba County, Mississippi, sentenced to six years in prison (served four years) * Sam H. Bowers, Jr., of Laurel, the Imperial Wizard of the White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, sentenced to ten years in prison (served six years) * Horace Doyle Barnette, a one-time Meridian salesman, sentenced to three years in prison * Jimmy Arledge, a Meridian truck driver, sentenced to three years in prison * Billy Wayne Posey, a Williamsville service station operator, sentenced to six years in prison * Jimmy Snowden, a Meridian laundry truck driver, sentenced to three years in prison (served two years) * Alton W.

It lies on the N5 national primary road between Strokestown and Bellanagare. It is 19 km north of Roscommon town. Heritage Cruachan may be one of the most important and best preserved Celtic Royal Sites in Europe, and Tulsk is the setting for the interpretative centre which explores this complex and mysterious landscape. Cruachan was an Iron Age (Gaelic) royal palace, the home of the Irish warrior Queen Medb (or Meave), who was responsible for launching the Cattle raid of Cooley, as recounted in one of the best known works of early Irish literature, the T√°in B√≥ Cuailnge. Modern science is shedding new light on the significance of this ancient landscape and the meaning of the 60 National Monuments to be found here. The results of Archaeological Surveys carried out by Prof. John Waddell, from National University of Ireland, Galway, are incorporated into the exhibition rooms at Cruachan A√≠ Heritage Centre. The book \\"Rathcroghan, Co Roscommon: archaeological and geophysical survey in a ritual landscape\\", by John Waddell, Joe Fenwick, and Kevin Barton, details significant and previously unknown features and information about the Celtic Royal Site of Connacht. Archaeology The Discovery Programme has based its primary archaeological excavations and survey in the medieval village of Tulsk, and surrounding areas, from 2003 to 2009. Archaeological research conducted by the Discovery Programme, Ireland‚Äôs archaeological research institute funded by the Heritage Council, has been examining the nature of Gaelic lordship and settlement in north Roscommon during the later medieval period, c. 1170-1650 AD. Since 2003, elements of this work have focussed on the history and development of Tulsk, as the principal residence of the O‚ÄôConor Roe (Rua) lords. Excavation on the ringfort in Tulsk village continues to reveal a sequence of unexpected and complex settlement horizons, which include a medieval castle-building phase and an Elizabethan-period (c. 1560-90s) occupation, when the mound was included as part of the works associated with the garrisoning of Tulsk by Sir Richard Bingham, the ‚ÄòFlail of Connacht‚Äô. In 2009, the archaeological team has focused on a series of critical strata that explain the dating and development of the site. This year‚Äôs work considers the ringfort that underlies the medieval tower. The work shows the impressive boulder clay bank and ditch. It also shows the levels of soil introduced at a later date to build up the rignfort into a ‚Äòplatform‚Äô of ‚Äòraised rath‚Äô form, sometime before the building of the medieval tower. The recent excavation has also revealed prehistoric levels, that extend back into the Mesolithic period, before the time of farming and when hunting and gathering prevailed. The sequence of levels reveals the degree to which the medieval lords attached value to returning to known sites of habitation. Student volunteers from Ireland and from around the world have continued to contribute to the excavation project. Information on finds are presented in the Cruachan A√≠ Heritage Centre. History Parliamentary borough Tulsk was previously a parliamentary borough, one of three in County Roscommon from the period 1663 to 1800 and was a constituency represented in the Irish House of Commons. Under the co-monarchs William III of England and Mary II of England Tulsk was first represented in the Commons by William Caulfeild and William Neave in 1692. The year marked what was to be the beginning of an extended period of dominance for the Protestant Ascendancy. One of the two seats was effectively hereditary in the Caulfeild family. Visit of Gabriel Beranger 1779 In 1779 the artist Gabriel Beranger travelled throughout Ireland to paint the 'antiquities‚Äô of Ireland for the Hibernian Antiquarian Society. On his travels he passed through Tulsk and Rathcroghan. He noted that on May Day he witnessed a scene ‚Äòpeculiar to this locality‚Äô: It was that of ‚Äòdriving in all the black cattle from the surrounding plains to the great fort [Rathcroghan Mound], and bleeding them for the benefit of their health, while crowds of country people, having brought turf for firing, sat around and cooked the blood mixed with oaten meal, and when they could be procured, onions or scallions.‚ÄôA Memoir of Gabriel Beranger https://archive.org/details/memoirgabrielbe01wildgoog Visit of Samuel Lewis 1837 In 1837, Samuel Lewis published a topographical dictionary[21] which included the following contemporary description of Tulsk: > \\"TULSK, a post-town (formerly an incorporated market-town and parliamentary > borongh), in the parish of OGULLA, barony and county of ROSCOMMON, province > of CONNAUGHT, 8 miles (N.) from Roscommon, and 79 ¬æ (W. N. W.) from Dublin: > the population is returned with the parish. O'Conor Roe erected a castle > here in 1406, and during the same century a Dominican monastery was founded > either by MacDuil or O'Dowell, or by Phelim, son of Phelim Cleary O'Conor, > who was interred here in 1448. The castle was for a long time one of the > strongest in the province, and was garrisoned by the Earl of Kildare when he > led his forces into this province in 1499. The monastery continued to > flourish till the reign of Elizabeth, but for some time prior to the > dissolution its possessions were usurped by the Corporation of Galway. A > Dominican abbey was also founded at Toemonia, near the town, by O'Conor Roe > which in the reign of Elizabeth was found to be in the occupation of > Franciscans of the third order, on whose suppression it was granted by the > Queen to Richard Kyndelinshe.

'''Bianconi system''' Started in 1815 by the Italian immigrant Charles Bianconi the system of horse-drawn Bians grew from one initial route in Munster to daily travel of over 3,000 miles of road in Leinster, Munster and Connacht. Tulsk was one stop on a route from Ballina to Longford and vice versa. Leaving Ballina each morning at 10 a.m. (circa 1842) a mail coach with passengers would arrive in Tulsk at approx. 6 p.m, taking on average a further hour to reach Strokestown, and reaching Longford at 9 p.m. In the opposite direction a Bianconi car passed through Tulsk at approx. 8.50 each morning. It would then be due to arrive in Ballinagare one hour later. What travelers may have seen is open to question, but this was at a time when Tulsk was particularly ravaged by poverty, and suffered death and emigration on a large scale in subsequent years. For instance, as recorded by Maynooth University Population Change Atlas, what we now know as Tulsk parish had a population of 11,101 in 1841. Ten years later that figure dropped to 6,955. In 1861 Tulsk's population had more than halved from that of the eve of the Famine, with 5,539 persons. The Bianconi system grew less popular in the 1850s when rail service began, but many routes such as this one, continued for some time.'Bianconi's Car and Coach Lists, Throughout Leinster, Munster and Connaught. 1842' reprinted 1982 Outdoor Rallies Closer in time - at the start of the 20th century - in October 1903 the leader of the Irish Parliamentary Party John Redmond held a mass outdoor rally or \\"National Meeting\\" in Tulsk, for the people of County Roscommon. The party's dominant ideology was legislative independence for the country (Home Rule), with land reform also central to their mandate. On this particular inclement October Sunday, held in a field beside the village; Redmond addressed thousands on these two issues, both on local level and national level agendas. Tulsk was decided as the venue as it was geographically central to the county. Redmond arrived in the afternoon on horse-drawn side car from Roscommon town, where he had spent the previous night, after a train journey from Dublin. The culture of mass meetings in 19th century Ireland had begun with Daniel O'Connell's quest for Catholic emancipation, and between 1880 and 1920 there had been (at least, as recorded) eight to 10 such meetings in Tulsk. At this time (1903) Tulsk parish's population has been recorded at 3,275, having dropped further from the 5,539 recorded in 1861. World War 1 Tulsk was no different from most other British and Irish villages and towns during World War One, in that it contributed to the Allied effort of resisting the Central Powers' threat to European stability. John McGrath, from Tulsk, as published in Ireland's Memorial Records, is registered as a Private in the North Staffordshire Regiment - 12th Battalion - and was killed in action in France on 28 July 1918. His grave, amongst 370, can be viewed at Borre British Cemetery in northern France (grave number 11.F.6). Another WW1 soldier is Mark Phibbs of Corbally, Tulsk. He served in the Leinster Regiment, died of post traumatic stress disorder injuries sustained during battle while in France, and is buried in Glasnevin Cemetery,https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/54805557/ Dublin. Both McGrath and Phibbs are some of between 30,000 and 35,000 Irish who perished in the Great War. Two other men, Henry Armitage and William Garry, were RIC officers in Tulsk during that same war, and went to the front after an outdoor send-off in the village (from contemporaneous newspaper reports). Their fate is unknown, like that of half of the men who died in World War I (over 9 million), scattered as they are beneath the green fields of mainland Europe. The Cenotaph memorial, erected mostly in England and France - out of the ashes of the first global catastrophe of the 20th century - goes some way to remembering these dead. (re. Jay Winter, Lecture 18 - Sites of Memory, Sites of Mourning - from Yale Open Courses, European Civilisation, available online). On Saturday 29 August 1914 an article appeared in the Leitrim Observer newspaper reporting on spies appearing in the districts of Roscommon. Along with two suspected Germans arrested on suspicion of \\"some evil design\\", over Tarmonbarry bridge, the following was also printed: :\\"The Tulsk police arrested a foreigner, supposed to be a German, convenient to the royal ground at Rathcroghan on Wednesday last. He had a sketch book and a box of water colours in his possession but stated that he was only on a holiday, and was sketching for pleasure. We understand he was detained pending inquiries.\\" War of Independence During the Irish War of Independence, on 14 November 1920 George Kelly, who was a shop keeper in Tulsk, drove to Roscommon town in his truck to collect goods for his store. His vehicle was apprehended and Kelly was arrested and held in Roscommon. Later that night the same truck made its way to Four Mile House in the possession of RIC officers and members of the Black and Tans. Here, in the townland of Rathconnor, John Conry was marched from his house and shot twice in the head, twice in the chest and once in the stomach. The killing was in reprisal for the Four Mile House ambush, which had occurred three weeks previously. His death was just one in a total of 58 fatalities associated with the Irish revolution in county Roscommon from the years 1917 - 1921 (from 'Counting Terror' by Eunan O'Halpin in 'Terror in Ireland 1916-1923' ed. David Fitzpatrick). Thomas Brady, Intelligence Officer of 2nd Battalion, North Roscommon Brigade stated in the Bureau of Military History that while the RIC barracks in Tulsk had been evacuated in Autumn 1919 - Spring 1920, it wasn't burned to the ground until after Easter 1920, without any trouble; \\"We had no trouble in destroying [it].\\" The barracks had been a busy one for a rural outpost, and in 1911 had no fewer than 10 RIC officers stationed - this at a time of particular agrarian unrest in the area (albeit with a population of 784 in Tulsk DED at the time, as opposed to 215 in 2002 for instance - NUI Maynooth Irish Population Change Atlas (available online)). Sport Tulsk GAA club was founded in 1970 when St. Brendans, Killina merged with St. Marys, Kilmurray to form one club for the whole parish. A new clubhouse and grounds were opened in 1985 and the playing area extended in 1997. The club has one pitch, a stand and a small training pitch. A second training pitch is located in Lisalway just outside Castleplunket. There is also a handball alley on the grounds. A camogie team was founded in 2009 and won the Roscommon B final several times since its establishment. Facilities Facilities in the village and surrounding areas include the Tulsk Macra na Feirme hall. This club was established originally in 1948 but in its present incarnation was re-established in 1987 after a lapse of ten years. The hall is also used for the Foroige Club, indoor camogie training, and Tidy Towns meetings. The hall has a stage, bathrooms and a kitchenette. Up until 2009 it was used as the play school. The hall is located on the N5 approximately 200 meters east of the crossroads. Cruachan A√≠ is an interpretative and community centre for the Rathcroghan Celtic Royal Complex, Roscommon. It is located in the centre of the village. In popular culture Irish folk singer Christy Moore, in the title track of his Welcome to the Cabaret album, describes Tulsk as being like \\"hell\\". It is widely held that this refers to a gig he played there that ended up with a large brawl.https://www.irishtimes.com/blogs/best-place/2012/04/25/tulsk-co- roscommon/ However, the area around Tulsk, within the complex of sites known as Cruachan/Rathcroghan, has long association with Hell, due to the Christian Monks fearful notations on a known entrance to the Celtic 'Otherworld', through the Cave at Cruachan - Oweynagat (, the Cave of the Cats).  Transport  Tulsk is situated on the N5 and is the halfway point between Dublin and Westport. Bus √âireann runs bus services to other major towns from the village.

They are best known for their domination of Motorcycle World Championships between 1949 and 1957. The firm produced some of the most advanced and successful Grand Prix road racers of the time, winning five rider and five manufacturer World Championships in that short period. Early history (1929‚Äì1943) FB Mondial was born under the impulse of the Boselli brothers Luigi, Carlo, Ettore and Ada. FB stands for \\"Fratelli Boselli\\" (English: Boselli Brothers). Father of the entrepreneurial brothers was Giuseppe Boselli, a well-respected pilot and co-owner of GD, a legendary motorcycle company from Bologna. Initially, a workshop was opened for sales and service of G.D models, but within a few months, it soon became clear that there was a market demand for a cheap and robust motorbike. During his years as a competitive motorcyclist, Count Giuseppe Boselli had met Oreste Drusiani, a well-known engine builder and the pair struck a deal. It was in Oreste's farm in Bologna that FB established its first production site, dedicating itself to the construction of motorbikes. After steady success in their early years, in 1943 FB decided to expand their production capability and buy modern machinery to increase production. Unfortunately they could not put their plan into practice, as on 24 July 1943, a heavy allied bombing struck the Bologna railway station and its surroundings, shaking the farm. The machinery survived, but was commandeered by the military to aid in the war effort, putting production on hold for the duration of the war. Post-war era (1948‚Äì1979) FB Mondial 125cc ‚Äì 1949 1964 50cc Mondial Super Sportiva 1957 Mondial 250 Grand Prix racing motorcycle The collaboration between the Drusiani family and the Boselli family continued at the end of the war period, with the reconstruction of the building, thanks to the enormous economic resources of Boselli, who took over full control of the company. FB effectively relaunched in 1948 as FB Mondial. Mondial found early racing success, winning their first of what would become five World Championships in only their second year of production. During a time when MV Agusta and Ducati produced economy lightweight two-stroke motorcycles, mopeds and scooters, Mondial was more of a \\"boutique\\" manufacturer, specializing in high- performance, small-displacement motorcycles. Much of the production of each motorcycle was done by hand, which kept output low, with production numbers typically ranging between 1,000 and 2,000 units per year. Mondial were able to continue this success for a number of years, sticking with this methodology. In 1957, Soichiro Honda approached Mondial owner Count Boselli for purchase of a Mondial racebike, with which the firm had just won the 125 cc and 250 cc world titles. Count Boselli gave Mr. Honda a racing Mondial; Honda used this bike as a standard to which he aspired, in order to compete on a world-scale. An original Mondial 125 cc racebike is, still now, the first bike on display when entering Honda's Motegi Collection Hall. After the 1957 Grand Prix season, many major Italian motorcycle manufacturers including Gilera, Moto Guzzi, and MV Agusta announced that they would pull out of Grand Prix competition citing increasing costs and diminishing sales (MV Agusta later reconsidered and continued racing). Mondial, despite their continued success, decide to join them. This marked the beginning of a decline in popularity and sales for the Italian company, and in 1960, the last all-Mondial motorcycle left the factory. After this, Mondial continued for a while, purchasing engines from proprietary makers. In this hybrid form, motorcycles with Mondial frames and ancillary parts, but non-Mondial engines, were produced by the factory for the next 19 years. However, Mondial stopped production in their entirety in 1979, until their rebirth nearly twenty years later. Ziletti ownership (1999‚Äì2004) In 1999, the rights to Mondial were purchased by newspaper tycoon Roberto Ziletti. Ziletti was an avid motorcyclist in his youth, and his dream was to own a prestigious motorcycle company. Soon after purchasing the rights, Ziletti's father died, leaving him in charge of the Lastra Group. Mondial started producing superbikes again soon afterward.left In 2000 Ziletti asked Honda to supply engines for the new Mondial (the Piega 1000) from their race-winning RC51 superbikes. A deal was supposedly made because Mondial had supplied Soichiro Honda with that 1957 racebike. This was the first time Honda has ever allowed a firm to use its engines for their production vehicles. Mondial's difficulties occurred when Lastra acquired Mitsubishi Corp.'s worldwide graphic arts division, leaving Roberto Ziletti insufficient time to focus on Mondial. He had spent more than 11 million Euros on the company, and after failing to farm Mondial out to a Swiss company, the Arcore factory was placed in the hands of the Monza bankruptcy court in July 2004, with around 35 Mondial Piega 1000s in various states of completion. To place this in perspective, Lastra Group had a turnover exceeding 500 million Euros in 2004. In interviews in March 2005 a south Georgia motorcycle dealership, stated that the courts had arranged to sell Mondial to their American firm, Superbike Racing, on 28 February 2005, and that they would continue the marque. However, the Monza courts sold Mondial Moto SPA to another buyer on 27 July 2005: Biemme, another motorcycle firm located in Meda (near Milan) and owned by Piero Caronni (the same man who bought from Rimini bankruptcy court the remains and the production right from Bimota for the then defunct Bimota V Due), renamed itself as GRUPPO MONDIAL S.R.L. and continues offering the Piega 1000s to the market. 'Getting going again' (2014‚Äìpresent) In 2014, friends Count Pierluigi Boselli, owner of the Mondial brand and descendant of the original founders, and Cesare Galli, holder of Pelpi international Italy, started to lay the foundation of a project to revive the company, sketching out the first designs that would in time become the first motorcycle. Cesare Galli was formerly the Technical Director at Fantic Motor, the successful Italian offroad brand. Galli worked there until Fantic shut down in 1996 (it has since been restarted successfully), after winning a hat-trick of World Trials Championships with his designs, as well as successive World and Italian Enduro titles. Galli took over the importation of Kawasaki dirtbikes and ATVs for Italy. In 2002 he founded Pelpi International, European distributor for Taiwanese scooter and minibike manufacturers Aeon and Over. Through that first year and all of 2015 the initial design sketches evolved into prototypes then eventually became reality; the HPS 125 and HPS 250 for FB Mondial. The HPS design aims to be a fusion of the classic F.B. Mondial character, with modern technology. Built by Piaggio in China, who also produce vehicles for iconic Italian brands such as Aprilia and Vespa, the new Mondials are effectively Piaggio engines with Mondial's own higher specification design of chassis and styling. The firm currently offers four variants to the market. The traditionally styled 'caf√©- racer' HPS, available with a 125cc and 250cc engine, as well as the off-road, sportier styled SMT and SMX models.

The lake shores are inhabited by the Jakun branch of the Orang Asli. The Tasik Chini is the second largest fresh water lake in Peninsular Malaysia and is made up of a series of 12 lakes. Chini River, which drains from the lake, flows into Pahang River. The river is dammed to maintain the lake's depth during the dry season. However, this has disrupted the natural ecology of the lake and caused the death of trees on its shores due to elevated water level. Tasik Chini is one of the UNESCO Biosphere Reserve status sites in Peninsular Malaysia, while the other is Crocker Range in East Malaysia  Flora and fauna  The lake is also endowed with a rich bio- diversified lush tropical wilderness that is home to 138 species of flora, 300 species of non-aquatic live and 144 species of fresh water fish. Between August and September the lake is transformed into a floating garden with thousands of white and pink lotus flowers covering the surface.  Legends  The lake offers tranquil and peaceful surroundings steeped in myths and legends that have remained unexplained to this day. According to an Orang Asli legend, the lake is inhabited by a dragon called the Naga Seri Gumum (sometimes referred to as \\"Malaysia's Loch Ness Monster\\"). It is believed to contain an ancient sunken Khmer city at the bottom of the lake.  Pollution  The Orang Asli (indigenous people) who live on the banks of Tasik Chini complain that the lake has become polluted. A community leader of an Orang Asli village, Tok Batin Awang Alok, said that logging and ore mining activities have create pollution and caused problems for local residents. Children who bathe in the lake complain of itchiness. Fish caught in the lake have become unfit to eat. The Orang Asli people cannot go to areas to collect roots used in traditional medicine because the areas have been closed for mining. Dr Hedzri Adnan of Asian Public Intellectuals said that rapid changes at the lake might cause the ecosystem to collapse by 2030. Transparency International's secretary-general Josie Fernandez also said that the lake also risked losing its UNESCO Biosphere Reserve status.

Dudley) is a fictional comic book character, originally created for Fawcett Comics, and today owned by DC Comics, who appears in stories about the Marvel Family team of superheroes. Publication history Created by Otto Binder and Marc Swayze, Uncle Marvel was created primarily as a supporting character of Mary Marvel and first appeared in Wow Comics #18 in October 1943. Fictional character biography An old, rotund man named Dudley, Uncle Marvel did not have any real superpowers. He found Mary Batson's good deed ledger which she kept to record her good deeds but had dropped and read it, learning her secret. Claiming to be the uncle of Mary Batson, Mary Marvel's teenage alter-ego, from California, Dudley attempted to con his way into the Marvel Family. The Marvels, possessing the wisdom of Solomon, saw through Dudley's machinations, but since he was, in their opinion such a \\"lovable old fraud\\", they allowed Dudley to join the team as their manager Uncle Marvel and humored his pretense of having Marvel powers. When asked to make use of his supposed superpowers, Dudley would always complain that his \\"shazambago\\" was acting up and was interfering with his powers, though the Marvels always knew better. Though mostly played as comic relief, Dudley plays a key role in Marvel Family #1 as he tricks the rogue Marvel Black Adam (debuting in that story) into saying the magic word \\"Shazam\\" and reverting to his mortal self. In Mary Marvel #7, after Mary stops some thugs, Dudley makes Mary promise not to turn into Mary Marvel until midnight, to show that she is helpless without Mary Marvel. He then sends two men to rob the office, not knowing they are actual criminals who kidnap Mary and try to hold her for ransom. The criminals attempt to force Dudley to write a ransom note, but midnight arrives and Mary transforms into Mary Marvel to stop them. Uncle Marvel continued to appear in the Marvel Family stories through 1948, at which time the character was quietly dropped. He returned to the Marvel Family comics when DC Comics began publishing new stories and reprints under the title Shazam! in 1973, he was put into suspended animation, along with many other Fawcett characters, explained as an attack gone wrong by the Sivana family. He again takes over Shazam Incorporated. After forty years of appearing in the Marvel Family comics, Uncle Dudley was revamped in 1987 along with the rest of the Shazam! franchise. In Roy Thomas and Tom Mandrake's four- issue 1987 miniseries Shazam!: The New Beginning, the character became Dudley Batson, an actual blood uncle of young Billy Batson, Captain Marvel's alter- ego. A second revamped version of Uncle Marvel was introduced in Jerry Ordway's Power of Shazam! graphic novel in 1994 and a resulting ongoing comic book series of the same name, rendering Thomas and Mandrake's version non- canonical. In Ordway's stories, Dudley H. Dudley is the janitor at Billy Batson's school, who looks out for the homeless boy and inadvertently learns that Billy is also the alter ego of Captain Marvel. This revelation leads Dudley to be involved in a number of Marvel Family adventures, including one story (The Power of Shazam! #11 and #12) in which Dudley temporarily gains superpowers (and the \\"Uncle Marvel\\" costume of the original version of the character) thanks to Ibis the Invincible. Dudley continued to appear in The Power of Shazam! for the duration of the series as a recurring supporting character, often paired with Tawky Tawny, an anthropomorphic tiger friend of Captain Marvel's who becomes Dudley's roommate. Following the cancellation of The Power of Shazam! in 1999, \\"Uncle\\" Dudley virtually disappeared from DC Comics publications, save for a short cameo in 52 #16 at the wedding of Marvel Family related characters Black Adam and Isis and two brief cameos in Jerry Ordway-illustrated issues of Justice Society of America in 2009 (Vol. 3, #24 and #28). Uncle Dudley was more prominently featured in the two-issue Convergence tie-in Convergence: Shazam! in 2015, as well as a brief cameo in the \\"Thunderworld\\" issue - issue #4 - of Grant Morrison's miniseries The Multiversity. In other media =Television= * A live-action Shazam! television series, which aired on CBS Saturday mornings from 1974 to 1976, featured Captain Marvel and his young alter-ego Billy Batson, accompanied by an old man known as Mentor. The Mentor character was loosely based upon Uncle Marvel, who in concurrent 1970s issues of the Shazam! comic book began sporting a mustache to resemble Les Tremayne, the actor who appeared as \\"Mentor\\" on the Shazam!

Biography Born in Ciechan√≥w, Poland, to a middle-class family, R√≥≈ºa had one brother and one sister. She was a member of Hashomer Hatzair Zionist- socialist youth movement, and joined that movement's underground, upon the 1939 Nazi German invasion of Poland. R√≥≈ºa often used her Hebrew name, Shoshanah. In the home of Izajasz (Isaiah) Robota at ≈ªydowska 4 Street in Ciechan√≥w was the Perec Library, the most active Jewish cultural society in the city, organizing discussions about the Polish, Jewish and world literature, as well as theatre performances, lectures, and dances. =Auschwitz= Roza was transported to Auschwitz concentration camp in a Holocaust train during the liquidation of the Ciechan√≥w Ghetto in 1942. She survived the \\"selection\\" and was assigned to Auschwitz-II Birkenau labor commando for women, where she got involved in the underground dissemination of news among the prisoners. No one else from her family in Europe is known to have survived. She worked in the clothing depot at the Birkenau Effektenlager adjacent to Crematorium III of Birkenau, where the bodies of gas chamber victims were burned. She had been recruited by men of the underground whom she knew from her hometown, to smuggle \\"Schwarzpulver\\" (gunpowder; or dynamite according to other sources) collected by women in the Krupp \\"Weichsel\\" munitions factory, and then transferring it to a Sonderkommando man named Wr√≥bel,Patterson, David (2002). \\"Salmen Lewental\\". In David Patterson, et al. (Eds.), Encyclopedia of Holocaust Literature, p. 112. Greenwood Publishing Group. who was also active in the resistance. This schwartzpulver was used to manufacture primitive grenades to help blow up the crematorium during the Sonderkommando revolt. In her work, she was assisted by Hadassa Zlotnicka and Asir-Godel Zilber, both also from Ciechan√≥w, whom Robota apparently enlisted in the resistance. Together with a few other women who worked in the Nazi \\"pulverraum\\" factory, they were able to obtain, hide, and turn over to the men of the underground no more than one to three teaspoons of the schwartzpulver compound per day, and not every day. The Sonderkommando blew up Crematorium III on 6 October 1944.Yahil, Leni (1987). The Holocaust: The Fate of European Jewry, 1932‚Äì1945, p. 486. Oxford University Press. Robota and three other women ‚Äì Ala Gertner, Estusia Wajcblum, and Regina Safirsztajn ‚Äì were arrested by the Gestapo and tortured in the infamous Bloc 23 but they refused to reveal the names of others who participated in the smuggling operation. They were hung on 6 January 1945 ‚Äì two women at the morning roll-call assembly, two others in the evening. Robota was 23 years old. According to some eyewitness accounts, she and her comrades shouted \\"Nekamah\\" (\\"Vengeance!\\"), or \\"Be Strong\\" to the assembled inmates before they died. Some say they shouted, \\"Chazak V'amatz\\" ‚Äì \\"Be strong and have courage\\", the Biblical phrase that God uses to encourage Joshua after the death of Moses. This is also the motto of Hashomer Hatzair, the youth organization she belonged to. The Sonderkommando Revolt caused some 70 fatalities among the SS and kapos, and blew the roof off one crematorium, yet the Nazis knew the advancing Russian Army was very close to liberating the camp. It was clear to the Nazis that all evidence of the war-time atrocities had to be concealed, so the Germans attempted to destroy the other four crematoria themselves. Legacy Roza Robota's memory lives on, in the naming of the Roza Robota Gates at Montefiore Randwick (Sydney, Australia). This initiative was made possible by Sam Spitzer, a resistance fighter during World War II and now a resident of Sydney. He named the gates in honour of his war-time hero, Robota, and his late wife, Margaret. Spitzer's sister was in Auschwitz with Robota. At Yad Vashem in Jerusalem, a monument was built to honor Robota and the three other executed women. It stands in a prime location in the garden. References =Sources= * Gurewitsch, Brana.

The book reprises characters from her 1868-69 two- volume novel Little Women, and acts as a sequel, or the second book in an unofficial Little Women trilogy. The trilogy ends with Alcott's 1886 novel, Jo's Boys, and How They Turned Out: A Sequel to Little Men. Alcott's story recounts the life of Jo Bhaer, her husband, and the various children at Plumfield Estate School. Alcott's classic novel has been adapted to a 1934 film, a 1940 film, a 1998 film, a television series, and a Japanese animated television series. Background Alcott's novel narrates six months in the life of the students at Plumfield, a school run by German Professor Friedrich and his wife, Mrs. Josephine Bhaer (n√©e March). The idea of the school is first suggested at the very end of Little Women, Part Two, when Jo inherits Plumfield Estate from her late Aunt March.Alcott 1868 The story was originally inspired by the death of Alcott's brother-in-law, which is revealed in one of the last chapters, when a beloved character, John Brooke, from Little Women dies.Alcott 1871 Alcott‚Äôs first inspiration for bringing educational ideals into the home and the development of a home-like model into the classroom, stems from her father, Amos Bronson Alcott, ‚Äúan educational reformer and prominent Transcendentalist.‚Äù Cheever 2011 As a ‚ÄúTranscendentalist visionary,‚Äù her father was considered unconventional even among his reform contemporaries.Matteson 2007 Educational theorists such as Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi, also provided the inspiration for Alcott‚Äôs educational methodologies and ‚Äústressed the need for the school to be as homelike as possible.\\"Speicher 2020 As an educational reformer, Alcott's father believed education, ‚Äúshould simply turn the child‚Äôs mind inward to recognize that divinity.‚ÄùHalttunen 2020 Alcott's father also ‚Äúbelieved that the theatrical performance of moral allegories by children would train them in the self- restraint that was the basis of domestic harmony and happiness.\\"Halttunen 2020 Bronson Alcott‚Äôs appeal to children‚Äôs imagination ‚Äúwas part of an effort to harness the child‚Äôs imaginative powers to the pursuit of the passionless life.‚ÄùHalttunen 2020 Alcott incorporates family dramatizations for the children of Plumfield to teach children \\"how to control every aspect of their self-expression.‚ÄùHalttunen 2020Alcott 1871 One of the main models for Friedrich was Henry David Thoreau (in fact he appears in multiple disguises in all of LMA¬¥s novels). Louisa attended Concord Academy where Henry and his brother John were teachers. Some of the elements in Friedrich¬¥s character that come from Henry in Little Men, include Friedrich using phrases such as \\"gods garden\\". Friedrich has given all children their own little garden spots, which is something that Henry did as well. In the same way as Jo and Friedrich, Henry and Louisa often went to long walks together. Henry was a naturalist and his interest in the natural world can be seen in Little Men in Dan Kean¬¥s character. Summary The story begins with the arrival of Nat Blake, a shy young orphan who is gifted at playing the violin and telling fibs. Nat narrates the story and introduces each character which features several cameo appearances from characters from the original Little Women novel. There are ten boys attending the school already. Then, Nat comes to Plumfield, followed by his friend Dan. After that, Nan arrives and becomes a companion for Daisy, the only girl. Jo's sons, Rob and Teddy, are younger than the others. Rob, Teddy, Daisy and Nan are not counted among the pupils.Alcott 1871 Plumfield is not run by conventional means. All the children have their own gardens and their own pets and are encouraged to experiment with running businesses. Pillow fights are permitted on Saturdays, subject to a time limit. Children are treated as individuals, with a strong emphasis on gently molding their characters.Alcott 1871 Daisy Brooke, Meg's daughter, attends Plumfield with her twin brother Demi, but she is somewhat isolated with no other girls her age, until Nan's arrival. Nan is even more of a willful tomboy than Jo was as a teenager, while Daisy is mainly interested in dolls and her own mini kitchen. Daisy‚Äôs mini kitchen includes a cast iron child-sized oven which was purchased by Jo's brother-in-law, Uncle Teddy, husband of her youngest sister Amy March. Near the end of the novel, Daisy's father, John, dies quietly one night.Alcott 1871 The other newcomer to Plumfield, Dan, is introduced by Nat. Dan originally decides the other boys are \\"molly-coddles\\" and leads them in experiments with boxing, fighting, drinking, smoking, profanity, and card games, which results in him being temporarily removed from the school. Dan eventually returns to Plumfield with an injured foot and redeems himself by standing up for Nat when Nat is falsely accused of theft by the other boys. He later becomes a curator of the school's natural history museum.Alcott 1871 Personal relationships are central to the school, and diversity is celebrated. Daisy is deeply attached to her twin brother, to shy Nat, and to tomboy Nan. Nan and Tommy are also close and intend to marry when they grow up. Dan, already friends with Nat, is unexpectedly drawn to the pious Demi and the toddler Teddy. While Franz, Emil, Daisy and John are all related to the Bhaers, they are not treated with favoritism and are encouraged to overcome their faults just the same as the other pupils.Alcott 1871 Style In the Introduction of Louisa May Alcott: A Biography, author Madeleine B. Stern states that ‚ÄúLouisa May Alcott was throughout her life a professional author skilled in creation and the re-creation implicit in revision.‚ÄùStern 1999 Alcott's works borrowed ‚Äúas source material episodes from her life, her observations, her travels, her experiences, [and] her reading.‚ÄùStern 1999 Alcott‚Äôs legacy remains in her depiction of life and her devotion to family.Stern 1999 Her overall work is considered, ‚Äúneither of Hell nor of Heaven, but of a multitude of stories in a variety of literary genres, ranging from fairy tales to realistic war sketches, from sensation thrillers to domestic sagas.‚ÄùSpeicher 2020 Analysis Commentaries suggest that ‚Äúeven Little Women and its successors, Little Men and Jo‚Äôs Boys, were not immune from critics in hot pursuit of gender relations, power struggles, and sexual politics.‚ÄùStern 2020 According to Stern‚Äôs biography, ‚Äúin the case of Louisa May Alcott, such interpretations are very tempting, since she herself provided such an intriguing arsenal of ammunition.‚ÄùSpeicher 2020 As an educational reformist, Alcott \\"proves to be attuned to what eventually, in the twentieth century, became a solution to this obstacle: differentiation, or the idea that all children need not learn the same things.\\"Halttunen 2020 As an example, Alcott‚Äôs use of performance and acting in the home creates a ‚Äúfictional adaptation of her father‚Äôs allegorical nursery theater, [where] domestic drama is made an inextricable part of the moral struggles of everyday life.‚ÄùHalttunen 2020 The Alcott family theatrics ‚Äúproved a means of establishing peace between them, as Louisa learned to use family theater to curb her frantic demands for personal freedom and bring herself into conformity with her father‚Äôs domestic ideal.‚ÄùHalttunen 2020 Through adaptations of family theater, the characters in Little Men ‚Äúlearn to view themselves as little garden plots growing large crops of patience, perseverance, and good temper.‚ÄùHalttunen 2020 Publication In 1865, Alcott was first encouraged to write a book for girls, including memories of her childhood, and while she was employed as an editor at Merry Museum, a Boston children‚Äôs magazine, she began writing the Little Women trilogy which includes Little Women, Little Men, or Life at Plumfield with Jo's Boys, and How They Turned Out: A Sequel to Little Men. Cheever 2011 Stern 1999 Little Men was originally published by Roberts Brothers in 1871, and the first edition included 376 pages and since its original publication, Alcott's work has been published in many formats, languages, and adapted for younger readers.Alcott 1871 Reception The novel centers around \\"a diverse and challenging set of students‚Äîorphaned boys, the next generation of Marches, physically and mentally challenged children, a motherless girl, children of the merchant class‚ÄîAlcott comments on the possibilities and limitations of science education for the masses.\\"Speicher 2020 In the novel, Alcott ‚Äúis able to devote her attention to the benefits and risks of science education on an individual basis rather than imagining students in the abstract.‚ÄùSpeicher 2020 Little Men discusses the gray area in-between where a teacher can ‚Äúcover the whole ground of human culture‚Äîphysical, intellectual, moral, spiritual, and practical.‚ÄùSpeicher 2020 Soon after the publication of Little Men, educational advocates and reformers alike ‚Äúembraced these theories too, arguing their applicability to all children but particularly of the poor, who, it was believed, most needed the moral education a homelike school could offer.\\"Speicher 2020 Little Men addresses two ideals of learning which had previously been separated, home and school.Speicher 2020 Plumfield becomes an ideal model of a combined home and school, where Alcott's characters grow into adulthood, and their learning \\"outcomes are inflected not only by class and gender but also, most important, by the students' preexisting values and moral leanings.\\"Speicher 2020 Adaptations =Film= Little Men was first adapted into film in 1934 starring Erin O'Brien-Moore and Ralph Morgan. Another film followed in 1940 with Kay Francis. In 1998, a Canadian feature starring Mariel Hemingway and Chris Sarandon was released. =Television= In 1993, an animated television series based on this novel ran in Japan, Little Women II: Jo's Boys, which has been dubbed into several different languages, albeit not English. A Canadian television series, Little Men, aired in 1998 to 1999 for two seasons. The plot is somewhat altered and acts more as a continuation of the novel.

It is a 19th-century village of millworkers' homes. History Oella was founded in 1808 by the Union Manufacturing Company as a working class community for the company's mill workers. It was one of the earliest and most extensive cotton factories in the United States and used water-powered looms as early as 1819. The Union Manufacturing Company was motivated by the Embargo Act of 1807 which required Baltimore merchants to manufacture finished goods in the United States rather than England. Stock in the company was issued to fund a series of industrial mills, the largest working with cotton and wool. Child and indigent labor was used reaching 150 employees in 1811. After the War of 1812 ended the embargo, cotton prices fell. A fire at the largest mill on 13 December 1815 took a decade to rebuild and recover from. The Mill rebounded with water driven looms, and expanded to three mill buildings before finally dissolving in 1887 after another drop in textile prices. William J. Dickey of Dickeysville (Gwynns Falls) purchased the mill in 1887, operating it as W.J. Dickey and Sons, naming the mill \\"Oella\\" after the first woman to spin cotton in America. The Oella Historic District includes the village that consists of 19th century workers housing and one late 19th century church. The only known 20th century building is the W.J. Dickey Company Mill constructed in 1919 as a rebuild after a 1918 fire. The plant was eventually used for the city. A drawing from 1812 by Maximilian Godefroy shows most of the stone buildings. The brick houses date from the mid-19th century, while the frame buildings were constructed at the end of the century. The Oella Methodist Church is a simple frame building with a tower on the northeast corner, which has been converted into offices. The Patapsco River continued to provide power to generate electricity until 1972, when Hurricane Agnes flooded the power plant. That same year, the Dickey Company ceased manufacturing. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1976. Also listed on the National Register at Oella are the Ellicott's Mills Historic District and Mount Gilboa Chapel. Oella is along the route of the Trolley Line Number 9 Trail. Notable person * Benjamin Banneker (November 9, 1731 ‚Äì October 19, 1806) was a free African American scientist, surveyor, almanac author and farmer. Born in Baltimore County to a free African American woman and a former slave, Banneker had little formal education and was largely self-taught.

It was a decisive victory for the Tang prince Li Shimin, through which he was able to subdue two rival warlords, Dou Jiande who headed the Xia regime in Hebei, and Wang Shichong, the self-declared emperor of the Zheng dynasty. The battle was fought at the strategically important Hulao Pass, east of Luoyang. Following victories in the west that had established his credentials as a general, in August 620 Li Shimin marched against Wang Shichong. Tang troops blockaded Wang in his capital of Luoyang, while seizing the rest of Henan province. After failing in his efforts to break through the Tang siege, and suffering from ever greater privations, Wang solicited help from Dou Jiande. In April 621, Dou Jiande led a 100,000‚Äì120,000 strong army west to confront the Tang. Li Shimin's generals urged him to retreat west and protect the Tang core territory at Shanxi, but doing so would surrender the northeastern plains, at that time the heartland of China, to Dou. Consequently, Li Shimin took a gamble by leading a small force east to occupy the strategic Hulao Pass, while the bulk of his army was left behind continuing the siege of Luoyang. Ensconced in favourable defensive positions, the Tang managed to hold up the Xia advance. A large and heterogeneous army, the Xia lacked the flexibility to either outflank Li Shimin's position or abandon the Luoyang campaign and attack the exposed Tang heartland at Shanxi. As a result, the standoff between the two armies continued for several weeks. Finally, when he judged the situation ripe, Li Shimin feigned detaching part of his forces north to entice an attack. When Dou took the bait and advanced to the Tang positions in battle order, Li Shimin held back his own troops for several hours, until the troops of Dou Jiande were exhausted from being made to wait in formation under the sun for the entire morning. Once signs of disorder began appearing among them, Li Shimin attacked, breaking the opposing army and capturing Dou Jiande. Subsequently, Wang Shichong, left with no other choice, surrendered Luoyang. Both his and Dou Jiande's states were absorbed by the Tang. Dou Jiande was later executed, resulting in some of his followers, led by Liu Heita, raising an unsuccessful rebellion against the Tang. Hulao marked the decisive turning point in the civil wars that followed the collapse of the Sui Dynasty, after which the eventual victory of the Tang was never in doubt.  Background  Map of northern China during the transition from the Sui to the Tang, with the main contenders for the throne and the main military operations During the later reign of the second emperor of the Sui Dynasty, Yang (), the dynasty's authority began to wane: the immense material and human cost of the protracted and fruitless attempts to conquer the Korean kingdom of Goguryeo, coupled with natural disasters, caused unrest in the provinces, and military failures eroded the emperor's prestige and legitimacy (\\"Mandate of Heaven\\") among the provincial governors. Yang nevertheless continued to be fixated on the Korean campaigns, and by the time he realized the gravity of the situation, it was too late: as revolts spread, in 616, he abandoned the north and withdrew to Jiangdu, where he remained until his assassination in 618. Local governors and magnates rose to claim power in the wake of Yang's withdrawal. Nine major contenders emerged, some claiming the imperial title, others, contenting themselves, for the time being, with the more modest titles of \\"Duke\\" (g≈çng) and \\"King\\" (w√°ng). Among the most well-positioned contenders was Li Yuan, Duke of Tang and governor of Taiyuan in the northwest (modern Shanxi). A scion of a noble family related to the Sui dynasty, and with a distinguished career behind him, Li Yuan was an obvious candidate for the throne. His province possessed excellent natural defences, a heavily militarized population and was located near the capitals of Daxingcheng (Chang'an) and Luoyang. In autumn 617 Li Yuan and his sons, Li Shimin and Li Jiancheng, led their troops south. In a lightning campaign they defeated the Sui forces that tried to bar their way and, on 9 November, Li Yuan's troops stormed Chang'an. Li Yuan was now firmly placed as a major contender for the imperial throne, and on 16 June 618 he proclaimed himself the first emperor of the Tang Dynasty. In a series of campaigns in 618‚Äì620 the Tang, led by the talented Li Shimin, managed to eliminate their rivals in the northwest and repel an attack by Liu Wuzhou, who had taken control of Shanxi, but they still had to expand their control to the northeastern plain and the modern provinces of Hebei and Henan, which, in the words of historian Howard J. Wechsler, would decide whether the new dynasty \\"would remain a regional regime or whether they would succeed in uniting the country under its control\\". By early 620, two major regimes had established themselves over this region. Henan was controlled by the Luoyang-based Wang Shichong, a former Sui general who declared himself the first emperor of the Zheng dynasty after defeating another rebel leader, Li Mi, at the Battle of Yanshi and absorbing his army and territories. Hebei was ruled by the one-time bandit leader Dou Jiande, who had risen in revolt against the Sui already in 611. From his base at Mingzhou in south-central Hebei he had expanded his control south towards the Yellow River, claiming the title of \\"King of Xia\\". Like Wang and the Tang, he too made use of the pre-existing Sui officialdom and administrative apparatus to maintain his realm. In 619, Dou defeated the Tang army under Li Yuan's cousin Li Shentong and captured their territories north of the Yellow River, while from Luoyang Wang was a constant threat to the cities of the lower Yellow River that had only recently acknowledged Tang authority. The two men are presented as diametrically different characters in the sources: while Dou was chivalrous and successfully extended his territories by judicious moderation, Wang's arbitrariness and lack of courtesy quickly alienated many of his own supporters, leading two of his most distinguished generals, Qin Shubao and Luo Shixin, to desert him and join the Tang. The Tang began launching raids against Wang, causing morale to drop and many of his men to defect. Wang was forced to take hostages from the families of his own generals to ensure their loyalty, and impose kin punishment for any trespassing. Although up to 30,000 people ended up as virtual prisoners in his palace city in Luoyang, these acts only served to further undermine his regime. Li Shimin besieges Wang Shichong at Luoyang Li Shimin's charger Saluzi, one of the \\"Six Steeds of Zhao Mausoleum\\" by Yan Liben. The relief shows an incident during the Battle of the Mang Hills, Wang's final attempt to break the siege of Luoyang, when the horse was hit in the chest by an arrow. Fresh from his crushing victory over Liu Wuzhou, in August 620 Li Shimin, with an army of 50,000 men, began his advance from Shanxi towards Luoyang. The strategic aim of the Tang prince was to capture the Yellow River valley up to the sea, thus separating the territories held by rival regimes in the north (i.e., Dou Jiande) from any allies in the south, particularly after Du Fuwei, a rebel leader who controlled the Huai River area, chose to acknowledge Tang authority. Starting from Shenzhou, Li Shimin's progress was swift, advancing against little resistance as Wang feared to risk an open confrontation and remained behind the walls of Luoyang. By September, Tang troops had begun to establish a ring of fortified camps around the city. Wang's offers of a settlement based on a partition of the empire were rejected by Li Shimin. While both sides skirmished around Luoyang, each trying to protect or prevent the supply convoys coming into the city, Tang detachments had penetrated further south, east and north, triggering the defection of most of central Henan from Wang's control. By the end of the year, only the distant cities of Xiangyang and Xuzhou remained under Wang's control, but were unable to provide any assistance. The monks of the nearby Shaolin Monastery also sided with Li Shimin, defeating a detachment of Wang's army at Mount Huanyuan and capturing his nephew, Wang Renze. Isolated in his capital and the territory immediately around it, Wang Shichong was growing desperate and more aggressive, launching two major attempts to break out of the Tang blockade in early 621. Both battles were hard fought, but eventually won by the Tang, largely thanks to the intervention of Li Shimin with his bodyguard of 1,000 heavily armed horsemen. The failure of these attempts meant that the siege became ever closer, with siege engines employed to support daily attacks on the city from all sides. The supply situation in Luoyang grew steadily worse as the siege continued into winter and then spring. By March, people were reportedly shifting through dirt to find traces of food, or ate cakes of rice and mud. No one was spared from the suffering, not even the highest officials; and of the 30,000 prisoners held by Wang in his palace, barely a tenth were left alive. Nevertheless, Wang refused any suggestion of surrender, placing his final hopes on an intervention by Dou Jiande, to whom he had sent envoys already in late 620. Dou Jiande marches west and Li Shimin occupies Hulao During the siege of Luoyang, Dou Jiande and the Tang had been engaged in negotiations, but these had been inconclusive: Dou could not ignore the threat posed by the Tang, but was as yet unwilling to effect a complete breach, and made some conciliatory gestures such as releasing a Tang princess he had captured in 619. When Wang's pleas arrived at his court, Dou was persuaded by his councillor Liu Bin that the situation presented both danger and opportunity: if Luoyang fell, the Tang would next turn against Dou, but if Dou intervened and saved Luoyang, it would be easy to oust the weakened Wang and annex Henan to his own Xia state. It was therefore probably by design that Dou waited until April, when Wang's situation had become critical, before he began marching west to relieve the siege of Luoyang. The Tang launched an attack from their bases in Shanxi against Dou's flank, hoping to divert his attention, but in vain. Dou had enough men to strongly garrison his territory, while still mustering a huge force for marching against Li Shimin. The 10th- century Old Book of Tang and the 11th-century Zizhi Tongjian put Dou's army at 100,000 strong, while the 8th-century works Tongdian and Taizong zun shi (surviving only in fragments), raise it to 120,000 men. Although possibly exaggerated, an army of this size was well within the capabilities of the time. The Xia army was accompanied by a similarly large supply train, comprising both carts and boats. The approach of the Xia army placed the Tang army at Luoyang in a predicament: with no prospects of reinforcements, and with the loyalty of the recently captured cities in Henan suspect, remaining in place to be caught between Wang's men in Luoyang and Dou's army was a recipe for disaster. The older, more experienced and cautious of Li Shimin's generals suggested that he abandon the siege and retire west to Guanzhong, but the Tang prince refused to heed them, as this would mean abandoning the entirety of eastern China to Dou Jiande. Leaving control of the populous northeastern plain to Dou would strengthen his regime, and allow him to expand south to the south, where Du Fuwei and other Tang clients would be forced to submit. Not only would this mean abandoning the unification of the empire, but would place the Tang regime itself in peril. In what his modern biographer C. P. Fitzgerald called \\"the most critical military decision of his life\\", Li Shimin opted to confront the Xia army with a part of his forces, while leaving most of his army to maintain the siege of Luoyang. This was a risky gamble, as a defeat would risk eliminating the main Tang army, and opening the path for Dou to capture not only Luoyang, but Shanxi and Chang'an itself. Leaving the siege of Luoyang in the hands of his younger brother Li Yuanji and the general Qutu Tong, Li Shimin took 3,500 men to the Hulao Pass, some to the east of Luoyang, which he occupied on 22 April. His force was augmented by the garrison of the local town, but his army is unlikely to have exceeded 10,000 men, albeit representing some of the best troops in the Tang army. The Hulao Pass was formed by the ravine of the Sishui river. Lined on both banks by escarpments and steep hills, rising in the south to the Song mountains, it possessed major strategic importance, as the east‚Äìwest road along the Yellow River's south bank crossed it. Fitzgerald, who visited the area himself in the early 20th century, described this \\"Chinese Thermopylae\\" as follows: Standoff at Hulao and Dou Jiande's dilemma Emperor Taizong (seated right), gives an audience to the Tibetan ambassador. Later copy of a 641 painting by Yan Liben. When Dou Jiande's army arrived before Hulao, Li Shimin headed a daring raid to raise his own army's morale in the face of such a numerically superior enemy. Taking only 500 horsemen, he crossed the river and advanced towards the Xia camp. Leaving the bulk of this force in ambush, Li Shimin pressed on with only four or five men as escort. When the Xia troops attacked, Li Shimin felled several of them with his precise archery, keeping them at a distance while leading them on into the ambush he had prepared. The Xia lost over 300 men, and a number of higher officers were taken prisoner. Li Shimin followed up this success by sending a letter to Dou, addressing him as if he were a subject, and demanding that he abandon the region. Dou responded by attacking the walled town of Sishui, but found it and the western heights behind strongly held by the Tang. Dou then encamped his forces at Banzhu, a plain east of the pass. Over the next weeks, he repeatedly marched to Hulao and offered battle. Li Shimin, however, was content to remain in his powerful defensive position from which his numerically inferior force could easily hold the Xia at bay. The Tang prince knew that time worked in his favour, as each day the standoff continued only brought the garrison of Luoyang closer to starvation and surrender, and when this happened he would be able to launch his strike with the entire strength of the Tang army. Furthermore, as time passed, the Xia position too deteriorated. The Xia had to laboriously pull their supply barges upstream, while the Tang were conversely aided by the current; and the very size of the Xia army meant that every passing week the costs of maintaining it in the field exhausted the Xia treasury further. Other passes were available through the hills near Hulao, but they were smaller and equally defensible; given the size of the Xia army, the only other alternatives for Dou would have been to bypass the Tang position entirely, either by crossing the Yellow River to the north or by venturing further south to the Huanyuan Pass. Indeed, one of Dou's civil officials, Ling Jing, suggested a different strategic approach, namely to avoid any engagement with Li Shimin, cross to the northern bank of the Yellow River and strike at the Tang heartland in Shanxi, thereby both weakening the Tang and forcing them to abandon the siege of Luoyang without the Xia incurring any casualties. The plan was supported by Dou's wife, Lady Cao, but was not adopted due to the vehement opposition of the Xia generals. Aside from the natural disregard of the military professionals towards a suggestion from someone whom they regarded as an \\"armchair general\\", however, this opposition is attributed by some sources to the entreaties and bribery of some Xia generals by Wang Shichong's ambassador, who wished to ensure that Dou remained committed to the relief of Luoyang. Whatever the true events, military historian David A. Graff opines that logistical concerns played the major role in Dou's decision to stay at Banzhu, as his huge army was utterly dependent on proximity to the Yellow River and its canal network for its supplies. In addition, the heterogeneous nature of the Xia army, containing as it did the forces of various rebel leaders Dou had defeated over the past few years, and whose loyalty was doubtful, prevented Dou from dividing his army and sending various detachments on independent missions. Battle of Hulao Pass Terracotta statue of a Tang-era armoured horseman. Cavalry was scarce in native Chinese armies, and played a decisive role in battles. In contrast to this figurine, most of the Tang cavalrymen were armoured, but their horses were not, giving them greater mobility. In the event, after a month had passed, the Tang prince decided to force a confrontation. Li Shimin's reasons for this move are unknown; Graff suggests that it is \\"possible that he believed the morale of Dou's men had deteriorated, and it is very likely that he did not wish to allow the exposed Xia army to withdraw to safety in Hebei after Luoyang had fallen\\", or that he was frustrated at Luoyang's unexpectedly long resistance. At the same time, Li Shimin was evidently determined to exploit the opportunity offered by the tactical situation to score a crushing victory against Dou, which would result in the rapid absorption of his domains by the Tang. To entice his enemy to accept battle, Li Shimin sent his cavalry to raid Dou's supply lines, and then led a portion of his forces, with 1,000 horses across the Yellow River, giving the appearance that he had detached them to guard against an attack in the direction of Shanxi. During the night, these troops secretly crossed the river again. Dou took the bait, and on the early morning hours of 28 May led a large part of his army against Hulao, deploying his troops for battle along the eastern shore of the Sishui river in challenge to the Tang. Per Li Shimin's plan, the Tang troops did not come forth to deploy for battle; instead they remained in their strong defensive positions in the hills, waiting for the Xia army to tire and begin its withdrawal. Then the Tang, according to Graff, \\"would rush out and fall upon the by now demoralized and disorganized Xia army\\". This conformed to Li Shimin's usual blueprint, which he had already employed to prevail over Liu Wuzhou and the ruler of eastern Gansu, Xue Rengao: the Tang prince let the enemy advance, stretching their supply lines, and chose a suitable, highly defensible position where to confront them; he avoided a direct confrontation, instead launching raids on his opponent's supply lines, awaiting either signs of weakness or the beginning of a retreat; he then launched an all-out attack aiming at a crushing battlefield success, which he rendered decisive by following it up with a \\"relentless cavalry pursuit\\", in Graff's words, to exploit it and bring about the collapse of his opponent's entire regime. In order to draw the Tang out to the open field, where his superior numbers would carry the day, Dou sent 300 of his cavalry to cross the Sishui stream and provoke Li Shimin to attack. Careful to stick to his plan but also exploit the pretext for a delay offered by Dou, the Tang prince sent only 200 of his horsemen. The duel between the two cavalry forces lasted for some time but proved indecisive, until both sides withdrew to their lines. Apart from this and a minor skirmish between a Xia officer and the Tang general Yuchi Gong, the two armies maintained their standoff from about 08:00 until noon, when the Xia troops began to show signs of thirst and weariness, with soldiers sitting down or breaking formation to fetch water. Li Shimin, from a high vantage point, saw this. With the horses from his earlier feint having returned and his cavalry again at full strength, the Tang prince sent 300 horsemen under Yuwen Shiji in a probing attack. When Li Shimin saw that the demoralized and dispersed Xia troops were thrown into confusion from this assault and struggled to put up a cohesive defence, he sent more of his cavalry to turn Dou's left flank from the south. The Tang attack was inadvertedly aided by Dou, who was holding a council with his officers at the time. With his army buckling, Dou reacted by ordering the withdrawal of his entire army from the river to the better defensive position offered by the eastern escarpment of the Sishui valley. However, in the spreading confusion, many officers were not able to reach their men in time, while orders issued by the generals often did not arrive in the fighting ranks. Seeing disorder spreading in the Xia army, Li Shimin ordered his army to launch a general attack against the withdrawing Xia, himself spearheading the attack at the head of his remaining cavalry. Li Shimin's 18-year-old cousin Li Daoxuan particularly distinguished himself in this stage of the battle, charging through the Xia line until he emerged in their rear, turning round to emerge on the other side, and repeating this feat so many times that at the end of the battle so many arrows stuck out of his armour that the Chinese sources liken his appearance to a porcupine. The ensuing battle was bloody, but was decided when Li Shimin and a part of his cavalry broke through the Xia lines and reached the eastern escarpment, planting the Tang banners in full view of both armies. Possibly coupled with the arrival of the flanking Tang cavalry, this development caused the complete collapse of the Xia army: trapped between the Tang forces and the eastern cliffs, 3,000 Xia soldiers fell in the field or the subsequent pursuit, but more than 50,000 were taken prisoner, and the rest dispersed in the surrounding countryside. These included Dou Jiande himself, who was wounded, unhorsed and captured while trying to find a way to cross the Yellow River. The rout of the Xia state was complete: only a few hundreds of horsemen reached the Xia capital, and with their ruler captured, any possibility of rallying the remaining Xia forces was gone. Aftermath and impact major provinces of the empire The Tang victory at Hulao spelled the end for Luoyang too: bereft of any hope of rescue, Wang Shichong surrendered on 4 June, after Li Shimin displayed the captured Dou Jiande and his generals before the city walls. Li Shimin returned to Chang'an, which he entered at the head of a triumphal procession, wearing golden armour, followed by the two captive rivals and their courts, 25 of his own generals, and 10,000 horsemen. Dou's wife and senior officials managed to escape the Xia camp and reach the safety of Hebei, but although some wanted to continue fighting under Dou's adopted son, most, including the influential Qi Shanxing, regarded the outcome of the battle as a sign that the Tang possessed the \\"Mandate of Heaven\\", the divine right to rule. On 10 June, the Xia formally surrendered to the Tang, with Dou's ally Xu Yuanlang and Wang Shichong's brother Shibian following suit over the next days. In stark contrast to the leniency with which the Tang treated most of their defeated rivals, Dou Jiande and Wang Shichong were soon eliminated: Dou was sent to Chang'an, where he was executed, while Wang was ostensibly allowed to retire in exile in Sichuan, but was killed on his way there. According to David Graff, the battle at Hulao was \\"the single most decisive engagement of the civil wars\\" that followed the fall of Sui, while C. P. Fitzgerald considers it \\"one of the decisive battles in the history of the world\\". By defeating Dou Jiande and Wang Shichong, the Tang eliminated their two strongest rivals and brought the vital north-eastern plain under their control, securing an unchallenged ascendancy over all other competing factions and making possible the reunification of China under Tang rule. Tang authority had not yet encompassed all of China and rebellions occurred for a few more years. The most notable of these occurred in late 621, when the former Xia officials in Hebei rose up in reaction to the execution of Dou Jiande, under the leadership of Dou's cavalry commander Liu Heita. Nevertheless, the course the civil war had been decided at Hulao, and the various rebel leaders were overcome one by one; the last, Liang Shidu of Shuofang, was defeated in June 628, marking the end of the civil war. In late 629, Li Shimin, by now Emperor of China, ordered the erection of Buddhist monasteries on the sites of seven of the battles he had fought during the civil war. In a gesture that illustrated the emperor's desire to heal the divisions of the conflict, for Hulao he chose the name \\"Temple of Equality in Commiseration\\".

Terms shall not be implied merely because they appear \\"desirable and reasonable\\". The case has been widely cited in later cases and is narrowly distinguished.Davies on Contract Facts The owners of the ship called The Moorcock contracted for space at a wharf owner's jetty in order to unload The Moorcock's cargo. While docked, the tide went down to a point where the hull of the ship hit a ridge, causing damage to the ship. The plaintiff argued that the wharfingers were responsible to ensure that his vessel would remain safe while docked. The wharf owners, in their defense, claimed that there were no provisions in the contract to ensure the vessel's safety and that they could not have foreseen the damage caused to the vessel. The issue before the Court was whether there can be any implied warranty given the circumstances. The trial court found that there was an implied warranty. Judgment The Court held for the ship owner, ruling that there was an implied term that the wharfingers had taken reasonable steps to ascertain the state of the riverbed adjacent to the jetty (not, as often stated, an implied term that the jetty would be a safe place to dock).See reference to this case in Smith v. Burnett, US Supreme Court 173 US 430 If the wharfingers had taken such responsibility, then they would have discovered the ridge of rock and would have been under the duty to warn the shipowners of the potential hazard. Failure to warn would have been actionable in tort. Therefore, this very restricted term was sufficient to provide protection to the shipowners as it would have been necessary to give the contracted business efficacy. Bowen LJ stated that any implied warranties must be based on the presumed intentions of the parties. An implied warranty may be read into a contract for reasons of \\"business efficacy\\", and in order to maintain the presumed intention of the parties. As Bowen LJ said: Bowen LJ looked at the presumed risks of the agreement and who was expected to bear them. The wharfingers were in such a position that they could have discovered there was a risk of damage to the ship, and would have been in the best position to judge the safety of the vessel.

Like many magician superheroes introduced in the Golden Age of Comics, Ibis owes much to the popular comic strip character Mandrake the Magician. A second Ibis, successor of the first, was introduced in 2007. Publication history The original Ibis first appeared in Whiz Comics #2 (February 1940), and was created by Bob Kingett. When superheroes declined in popularity in the early 1950s, Ibis and the other Fawcett characters ceased publication. One Ibis story shortly thereafter was reprinted by Charlton Comics.Danger and Adventure #22 (February 1955) as noted in Don Markstein's Toonopedia The Fawcett characters were later licensed and eventually bought outright by DC Comics in the 1970s. The second Ibis first appeared in Helmet of Fate: Ibis the Invincible #1 (January 2007), and was created by Tad Williams and Phil Winslade. Fictional character biography =Prince Amentep= Ibis begins his life as Amentep, a prince of ancient Egypt who was in love with the beautiful Princess Taia of Thebes. As a young man, Amentep is given the \\"Ibistick\\", a talisman of incredible power, by the Egyptian god Thoth, who empowers the talisman after Ibis was overthrown. Amentep's throne is eventually usurped ‚Äì with the aid of a demonic army conjured up by the evil god Set ‚Äì by a cruel magician known as the Black Pharaoh. When Taia, who is under the protection of Osiris, refuses to marry him, the Black Pharaoh shoots her with a poisoned arrow. Using his Ibistick, Amentep places his beloved in suspended animation to allow her to heal. He casts a similar spell upon himself, hoping to be present when Taia revives. 4000 years later, the mummy of Amentep returns to life in an American museum in 1940 (this was later revealed to be the work of the wizard Shazam). Now called \\"Ibis\\", Amentep sets out in search of his beloved, eventually finding her at another museum. Seeking to adjust to this new world, Ibis uses his vast powers to become a crimefighter. Ibis can do almost anything with the power of the Ibistick: build force-fields around cities, transport himself and others, heal or destroy people, bring people back to life or summon spirits, give superhuman powers, and even make objects appear out of thin air. Without the wand however, he is powerless, and this weakness is frequently exploited by his enemies. The Ibistick apparently vibrates in the presence of evil, at one point it even wakes him up. Taia was once shown using the wand to make lightning strike a foe of Ibis, and often uses it at other times. It can be used by anybody, but not to cause harm directly to Ibis, or it will backfire on the user. It cannot be used directly against certain magics. According to Jess Nevins' Encyclopedia of Golden Age Superheroes, \\"Ibis fights ordinary criminals, an animated and living Sphinx, the Yellow Peril Trug, a spider made man-sized and man-smart by the Ibistick, the superintelligent maimed madman Half-Man, the Dark Spirit (a forgotten god of wickedness), Ruthven the Warlock, and Lucifer himself\\". Ibis and Taia next appear in a Justice League/Justice Society crossovers as members of a team referred to as Shazam's Squadron of Justice. These heroes live in a parallel universe on a world called Earth-S. Along with many other Earth-S characters, they were imprisoned in Doctor Sivana's Suspendium globe, but released twenty years later when it drifted near the Sun. Ibis was a member of the Squadron of Justice, organized to defeat King Kull when he paralyzed the Marvels and tried to destroy all three Earths. Ibis helped stop Mr. Atom from destroying the futuristic City of Tomorrow on Earth-One. After the Crisis on Infinite Earths, Ibis and Taia were retconned as part of the Golden Age of the DC Universe, in which Ibis served alongside other wartime heroes in the All-Star Squadron. As noted in Starman Vol. 2, #40 (March 1998), Ibis tends to operate out of Fawcett City like other heroes, including Bulletman, Minute Man, Spy Smasher and the duo of Mr. Scarlet and Pinky. Ibis was reintroduced in the modern DC Universe in The Power of Shazam! #11, in which he is resurrected by Mary Marvel and \\"Uncle\\" Dudley to rescue the wizard Shazam from Hell, where he had been imprisoned by the demoness Blaze. In Zatanna #1, part of the Seven Soldiers miniseries, Ibis and Taia presumably perish along with Doctor Thirteen and Timothy Ravenwind at the hands of Gwydion during a seance conducted by Zatanna. The sorceress blames her own shortcomings for their deaths.Seven Soldiers: Zatanna #1 (2005) Ibis had a cameo in Infinite Crisis, in a scene showing the return of the Fawcett superheroes to Earth-S. A modernized version of Ibis appeared in 52 #10 as the Egyptian representative in Black Adam's coalition. It is not known if this Ibis is the same character. =Danny Khalifa= Amentep's successor is an Egyptian American boy named Danny Khalifa. Due to his ancient bloodline, Danny is chosen by Amentep to be his successor. He inherits the Ibistick and is thrust into a conflict between ancient Egyptian gods. As Ibis, Danny prevents the helmet of Doctor Fate from falling into the hands of the dark god Set. Danny is assisted by the deity Thoth, who becomes his mentor and frightens away the bullies.The Helmet of Fate: Ibis the Invincible #1 (Jan, 2007) =Reign in Hell= Ibis returns to seek his new apprentice's services during the Reign in Hell miniseries. Tensions between the major demons and the Hell-empowered heroes and villains erupt into a struggle for the control of the Hell dimension. Danny accepts the summons. He is assisted by Black Alice, who offers guidance and covers for his absence on Earth. While in Hell, Black Alice betrays him to ensure her own safety, abandoning him to Neron's forces.

He first became prominent during the reign of Emperor Yang of Sui as one of the few Sui generals having success against rebel generals, and during Yang Tong's brief reign, he was able to defeat the rebel general Li Mi and seize Li Mi's territory. After becoming emperor, however, he was unable to withstand military pressure from Tang dynasty forces, forcing him to seek aid from Dou Jiande the Prince of Xia. After Dou was defeated and captured by the Tang general Li Shimin (the later Emperor Taizong), Wang surrendered. Emperor Gaozu of Tang spared him, but the Tang official Dugu Xiude (Áç®Â≠§‰øÆÂæ∑), whose father Dugu Ji (Áç®Â≠§Ê©ü) had been executed by Wang, assassinated him.  Early career  Wang Shichong's ancestors were surnamed Zhi (ÊîØ), originally from the Western Regions (Xiyu) and were not ethnic Chinese. After his grandfather Zhi Tuinou (ÊîØÈ†πËÄ®) died early, his grandmother married a man named Wang, who also adopted his father Zhi Shou (ÊîØÊî∂), who thereafter changed his name to Wang. Wang Shou later served as a secretary to the governor of Bian Province (Ê±¥Â∑û, roughly modern Kaifeng, Henan). The Book of Sui described Wang as a cunning and skeptical man with curly hair and a jackal-like voice. Wang Shichong himself was said to be studious in his youth, particularly concentrating on military strategies. He was also well-acquainted with laws. He apparently had contributions as a soldier and was gradually promoted. It was said that he was skillful in his application of laws and use of language, such that even when he made suggestions that did not appear to make sense logically, people were unable to refute him. By 610, after Zhang Heng (ÂºµË°°), the supervising official of Emperor Yang's palace at Jiangdu (Ê±üÈÉΩ, in modern Yangzhou, Jiangsu), fell from Emperor Yang's grace, Wang replaced him. As Emperor Yang frequently visited Jiangdu, Wang was said to be skillful at flattering the emperor as well as decorating the palace in an extravagant manner, bringing favor from the emperor. It was further said that Wang understood that Sui was soon to be in disturbance, and therefore carefully cultivated relationships with brave men. Whenever people were imprisoned, he would often find ways to free them, to gain their gratitude. In 613, when the general Yang Xuangan rebelled near the eastern capital Luoyang, agrarian rebels south of the Yangtze River rose as well, with Liu Yuanjin (ÂäâÂÖÉÈÄ≤) as their leader. Emperor Yang initially sent the generals Tuwan Xu (ÂêêËê¨Á∑í) and Yu Juluo (È≠ö‰ø±ÁæÖ) against Liu, but Tuwan and Yu were not able to defeat Liu conclusively. Emperor Yang executed Yu, and Tuwan died in fear. Emperor Yang instead sent Wang, and Wang defeated Liu, killing him. Wang initially promised not to kill Liu's soldiers, and they surrendered, but he slaughtered them after they surrendered. However, Emperor Yang, believing that Wang was a capable general, bestowed even greater favor on him. In 614, the major rebel leader Meng Rang (Â≠üËÆì) advanced south from his home commandery, Qi Commandery (roughly modern Jinan, Shandong), advancing to Xuyi (Áõ±Áúô, in modern Huai'an, Jiangsu). Wang led his army against Meng and built five fences to block Meng's path, while feigning weakness. Meng, believing Wang to be an incompetent civilian, spread his forces, not only to attack Wang, but also to pillage the area. Wang, catching Meng by surprise, struck back, defeating Meng and forcing him to flee. In the fall of 615, Emperor Yang, Empress Xiao, and much of the Sui court was touring Yanmen Commandery on the northern frontier when it received word from the Chinese princess Yicheng that her husband, Shibi Khan, was launching a surprise attack on the area. They hurried to the commandery seat at present-day Daixian in Shanxi;. the Turks besieged it on September 11.Â§ßÊ•≠ÂçÅ‰∏ÄÂπ¥ ÂÖ´ÊúàÁô∏ÈÖâ Academia Sinica Sima Guang, Zizhi Tongjian, Vol. 182. The emperor sent out messages of distress, promising promotion and riches to his saviors. Wang launched his army from Jiangdu toward Yanmen Commandery despite the long distance. During the journey, he often wept and was disheveled, stating his fear for the emperor's safety. Because the siege was lifted largely through the treacherous deception of Princess Yicheng, who told her husband that the khaganate had come under attack from the north in his absence, Emperor Yang followed the advice of councilors like Su Wei and gave no rewards and few promotions to the soldiers who had come to his assistance, causing great resentment among the military. Hearing of Wang's great personal distress, however, the emperor believed in his loyalty and promoted him to acting governor of Jiangdu in 616. After the general Yang Yichen defeated and killed the rebel general Ge Qian (Ê†ºÈÅ∑), Wang crushed the remainder of Ge's forces, and also those of Lu Mingyue (ÁõßÊòéÊúà). Emperor Yang was impressed with his success and personally awarded him wine.  Struggle against Li Mi  Map of the situation in northern China during the transition from the Sui to the Tang, with the main contenders for the throne and the main military operations In fall 617, with Luoyang under the threat of the rebel leader Li Mi the Duke of Wei, who had captured the large food storages that Emperor Yang had built near Luoyang and begun to starve the Sui defense forces at Luoyang, Emperor Yang, then at Jiangdu, sent Wang Shichong, along with several other generals, Wang Long (ÁéãÈöÜ), Wei Ji (ÈüãÈúΩ), and Wang Bian (ÁéãËæØ), from various locations of the empire, to aid Luoyang. They were under the command of Xue Shixiong (Ëñõ‰∏ñÈõÑ), who was ordered to take his forces from Zhuo Commandery (Ê∂øÈÉ°, roughly modern Beijing) to Luoyang was well. However, Xue was intercepted and defeated by Dou Jiande and forced to return to Zhuo Commandery, and died there, leaving the other generals without a central commander. When Wang Shichong, Wang Bian, and Wei arrived at Luoyang, they stalemated with Li across the Luo River, and Emperor Yang put the Sui forces under Wang Shichong's command. For the next several months, he battled with Li, and while each had victories, the results were generally indecisive, although Wang's forces took the brunt of the losses. Meanwhile, he had hoped that Li and his key general Zhai Rang would eventually have a fallout and that he could use the fallout to his advantage, but in winter 617 Li assassinated Zhai without Wang's being able to take advantage. In spring 618, after his forces were reinforced by 70,000 men sent by Emperor Yang's grandson Yang Tong the Prince of Yue, who was nominally in command at Luoyang, Wang launched a major attack on Li, but was defeated by Li, allowing Li to then crush the other Sui forces as well. In light of the victory, a number of Sui generals and rebel generals all submitted to Li, requesting Li to take imperial title, but Li declined. Wang retreated to Luoyang, and for a while did not dare to engage Li again. Later in spring 618, Emperor Yang was killed at Jiangdu in a coup led by the general Yuwen Huaji. When the news reached Luoyang, the Sui officials at Luoyang, including Wang, declared Yang Tong emperor. Wang was made one of the heads of the examination bureau (ÈñÄ‰∏ãÁúÅ, Menxia Sheng) and created the Duke of Zheng. He and six other officials, Duan Da (ÊÆµÈÅî), Yuan Wendu (ÂÖÉÊñáÈÉΩ), Huangfu Wuyi (ÁöáÁî´ÁÑ°ÈÄ∏), Lu Chu (ÁõßÊ•ö), Guo Wenyi (ÈÉ≠ÊñáÊáø), and Zhao Changwen (Ë∂ôÈï∑Êñá), formed a collective leadership and were known as the \\"seven nobles.\\" With Yuwen leading the elite Xiaoguo Army (È©çÊûú) back north toward Luoyang, both the Sui officials at Luoyang and Li were apprehensive of Yuwen's plans. In summer, after Yuan and Lu advocated the plan, Yang Tong entered into a peace agreement with Li, where Li accepted Sui titles and nominally submitted to Yang Tong. Li was subsequently able to repel Yuwen's attacks, and when the news reached Luoyang, the officials were largely pleased‚Äîbut Wang was not, stating, \\"Why are they giving offices and titles to a bandit?\\" This drew suspicions from Yuan and Lu that Wang was intending to surrender the city to Yuwen. The \\"seven nobles\\" thereafter came to suspect each other. Wang began to incite his troops by telling them that they would soon fall into Li's trap, and that if Li received the command over them (as Li was nominally bestowed the office of supreme commander of the armed forces), he would surely slaughter them for having resisted him. When Yuan received news that Wang was doing this, he planned to ambush Wang. However, Duan revealed the plot to Wang, and Wang started a coup himself first, killing Lu and surrounding the palace. Huangfu fled to Chang'an, the capital of Emperor Gaozu of Tang (Li Yuan), a former Sui general who had first nominally supported Emperor Yang's grandson Yang You (Emperor Gong) as emperor, but who had taken the throne himself earlier in 618 to establish Tang Dynasty. At Wang's insistence, Yang Tong surrendered Yuan, who remarked to Yang Tong, \\"If I die in the morning, Your Imperial Majesty will die in the evening.\\" Yang Tong wept, but still sent Yuan to Wang, who executed Yuan. Wang then met Yang Tong and pledged his loyalty, swearing that all he intended was to save himself and save the empire. Yang Tong took Wang inside the palace to meet Yang Tong's mother Empress Dowager Liu, and Wang swore before her as well. Nevertheless, from this point, all power was in Wang's hands, and Yang Tong himself was powerless. Guo and Zhao were also seized and executed. However, initially Wang continued to be outwardly respectful to the young emperor, while he flattered Empress Dowager Liu by offering to be her adopted son and honoring her with the title of \\"Empress Dowager Shenggan\\" (ËÅñÊÑüÁöáÂ§™Âêé).  As Sui regent  Upon hearing of Yuan Wendu's and Lu Chu's deaths, Li Mi broke off of peaceful relations with Yang Tong's regime. However, Li had a low opinion of Wang Shichong, and therefore took few precautions against an attack from Wang. At that time, Li's army lacked clothes, while Wang's army lacked food. Against his initial judgment, Li was persuaded by his secretary Bing Yuanzhen (ÈÇ¥ÂÖÉÁúü), who could benefit from the transactions, to trade food to Wang for clothes. As a result, the people of Luoyang stopped surrendering to Li, and while Li then stopped the transactions, the damage was done. Meanwhile, Li's army was worn out and heavily damaged by wars with Yuwen Huaji's Xiaoguo Army as well. While he had earlier received the submission of Wang's family members‚Äîincluding Wang's brother Wang Shiwei (Áéã‰∏ñÂÅâ) and sons Wang Xuanying (ÁéãÁéÑÊáâ), Wang Xuanshu (ÁéãÁéÑÊÅï), and Wang Xuanqiong (ÁéãÁéÑÁìä) -- he did not take particular use of them, but only detained them at the city of Yanshi (ÂÅÉÂ∏´, in modern Luoyang) with hopes to use them in the future to get Wang Shichong to surrender. Wang took this opportunity to launch a major attack on Li in fall 618. He first defeated Li himself at the Battle of Yanshi (after convincing his army that the spirit of the Duke of Zhou had predicted a victory) and, finding someone whose appearance was similar to Li, used him to declare that Li had been captured, further raising his army's morale. He then attacked and captured Yanshi, not only taking his family members but also the family members of many of Li's generals. He then made another assault on Li‚Äîwhich Li reacted slowly to and could not counter. Bing and Shan Xiongxin surrendered to Wang. Li, after initially considering fleeing to join forces with his general Xu Shiji‚Äîa friend of Zhai Rang's, ultimately decided to flee west instead to Tang territory to submit to Emperor Gaozu of Tang. After Li left the region, most of Li's territory surrendered to Yang Tong's regime, as did the major rebel general Zhu Can. (Xu, however, did not, and the area under his control submitted to Tang as well.) The major rebel leader Dou Jiande, who had claimed the title of Prince of Xia, also nominally submitted to Yang Tong. Wang was given the honorific office of Taiwei (Â§™Â∞â), and he began to gather officials with good reputations onto his staff. Wang encouraged people to offer suggestions, putting three wooden signs before his headquarters, requesting for three types of people to volunteer or to provide suggestions: # Those who were knowledgeable, who could be responsible for major projects; # Those who had bravery or tactics, who could be successful on the battlefield; # Those who suffered from wrong, who needed someone to listen to their petitions. However, it was said that Wang, although he welcomed these suggestions and petitions, actually did not act on them, and that while he used kind words to comfort even the lowest of soldiers, he did little in actions to benefit them. In spring 619, Wang's subordinates Dugu Wudu (Áç®Â≠§Ê≠¶ÈÉΩ), Dugu Wudu's cousin Dugu Ji, Yang Gongshen (Ê•äÊÅ≠ÊÖé), Sun Shixiao (Â≠´Â∏´Â≠ù), Liu Xiaoyuan (ÂäâÂ≠ùÂÖÉ), Li Jian (ÊùéÂÑâ), and Cui Xiaoren (Â¥îÂ≠ù‰ªÅ) plotted to surrender Luoyang to Tang troops, but were discovered, and they were all executed. Meanwhile, during a feast in Yang Tong's palace, Wang suffered from a severe case of food poisoning, and he believed that he was poisoned, and thereafter refused to see Yang Tong again. When Yang Tong, fearing his fate, tried to receive divine blessing by having the palace treasures given to the poor, Wang put soldiers around the palace to stop it. In late spring 619, Wang had Yang Tong create him the Prince of Zheng and grant him the nine bestowments‚Äîboth ultimate steps before taking the throne. He also had his subordinates openly discuss in public how it would be proper for him to take the throne. In summer 619, he had Duan Da and Yun Dingxing (Èõ≤ÂÆöËàà) enter the palace to persuade Yang Tong to yield the throne to him, and further sent messengers to Yang Tong to say: :Now the empire is not peaceful and needs an older emperor to rule over it. When it is pacified, I will return the throne to you, as I had sworn before. He then had an edict issued in Yang Tong's name, yielding the throne to him, ending Sui and establishing a new state of Zheng.  Reign  Wang Shichong made his son Wang Xuanying crown prince and Wang Xuanshu the Prince of Han. He made 19 other relatives his princes, and Yang Tong the former emperor the Duke of Lu. He did not have a fixed office; rather, he worked at several offices in the city, and he was in the habit of receiving personal submissions from the people to show that he was open to suggestions, but the idea backfired as too many people submitted petitions, making him unable to read them all. It was also said that he was overly talkative at imperial meetings, causing them to drag on overly long. Meanwhile, in light of his taking the throne, a number of commanderies that had submitted to Yang Tong submitted to either Tang or Xia, and Dou Jiande formally broke with Wang and took imperial style, albeit not imperial title. Further, after Wang attacked Liyang (ÈªéÈôΩ, in modern Hebi, Henan), which Xia had seized from Tang, in winter 619, and Dou retaliated by attacking Yin Prefecture (ÊÆ∑Â∑û, roughly modern Xinxiang, Henan), the states became enemies. A month later, Pei Renji and his son Pei Xingyan (Ë£¥Ë°åÂÑº), as well as the officials Yuwen Rutong (ÂÆáÊñáÂÑíÁ´•), Yuwen Wen (ÂÆáÊñáÊ∫´, Yuwen Rutong's brother), and Cui Deben (Â¥îÂæ∑Êú¨) plotted to kill Wang and restore Yang Tong. The news leaked, and the conspirators were slaughtered, along with their families. Wang Shichong's brother Wang Shiyun (Áéã‰∏ñÊÉ≤) the Prince of Qi persuaded Wang Shichong that in order to avoid a repeat of the plot, he needed to put Yang Tong to death. Wang Shichong agreed, and he sent his nephew Wang Renze (Áéã‰ªÅÂâá) the Prince of Tang and his servant Liang Bainian (Ê¢ÅÁôæÂπ¥) to force Yang Tong to drink poison. Yang Tong made one last plea, pointing out that Wang Shichong had previously promised to keep him alive. Liang considered requesting confirmation from Wang Shichong, but Wang Shiyun refused. Yang Tong set sacrifices for the Buddha and prayed, \\"May it be that I will no longer again be reborn into an imperial household.\\" He drank poison, but initially did not die. Wang Shiyun ordered that he be strangled. The Battle of Luoyang-Hulao Meanwhile, Zheng and Tang had continuous battles near Luoyang and also to the west and south, with the sides trading victories. In fall 620, Tang's Emperor Gaozu commissioned his son Li Shimin the Prince of Qin with an army to attack Luoyang, and Wang Shichong prepared his own forces to defend and counter. Wang sought to enter into a peace agreement with Li Shimin, but Li Shimin declined, and he captured Zheng cities one by one, either by attacking them or by accepting their surrender. By winter 620, Zheng was in a desperate situation, and Wang Shichong sent messengers to Dou, seeking help from Xia forces. Dou, believing that if Tang destroyed Zheng, his own Xia state would be cornered, agreed, and sought to diplomatically convince Li Shimin to withdraw, but Li Shimin again refused. Meanwhile, in spring 621, Li Shimin put Luoyang under siege. Wang's forces had strong catapults and crossbows, inflicting much casualties on Tang forces, and many Tang generals wished to withdraw. Li Shimin, however, believed that Luoyang would fall soon and therefore refused. Upon hearing that Dou was approaching, he decided to advance east to take up defensive position at the key Hulao Pass in advance of Dou's arrival, leaving a relatively small Tang army, under the command of his brother Li Yuanji the Prince of Qi, at Luoyang. Wang, seeing Li Shimin's troop movement but unsure what the situation was, did not attack Li Shimin's rear (as some of Li Shimin's generals feared). Meanwhile, Dou, against the advice of his strategist Ling Jing (ÂáåÊï¨) and his wife Empress Cao, advanced to Hulao in summer 621. Li Shimin initially refused to engage him, wearing his troops out, and then counterattacked, defeating and capturing him. Li Shimin took the captured Dou and Wang's emissaries Wang Wan (ÁéãÁê¨) the Prince of Dai (Wang Shichong's nephew) and Zhangsun Anshi (Èï∑Â≠´ÂÆâ‰∏ñ) to Luoyang to display them to Wang Shichong. Wang Shichong, after a conversation with Dou, broke down in tears. He considered fighting his way out of the siege and fleeing to Xiangyang, defended by his nephew Wang Honglie (ÁéãÂºòÁÉà) the Prince of Wei. His generals pointed out that he was dependent on Xia help, and now that Dou had been captured, there was nothing further to be done. Wang therefore exited the city and surrendered to Li Shimin. Li Shimin executed a number of his high level officials, but spared Wang himself, his family, and the rest of the officials.  Death  Li Shimin took Wang Shichong and Dou Jiande back to the Tang capital Chang'an to present them to his father Emperor Gaozu. When Emperor Gaozu met Wang and rebuked him, Wang stated, \\"I should be beheaded, but the Prince of Qin had agreed to spare me.\\" In fall 621, Emperor Gaozu spared him but demoted him to commoner rank, exiling him and his clan to modern Sichuan, while executing Dou. Meanwhile, Wang and his family members were awaiting exile, and were detained at the barracks of the capital prefecture, Yong Prefecture (ÈõçÂ∑û). Dugu Xiude, the son of Dugu Ji, took the opportunity to enter the barracks, claiming that Emperor Gaozu wished to see Wang Shichong. Wang Shichong and his brother Wang Shiyun came out to greet Dugu, and Dugu executed them to avenge his father. Emperor Gaozu only punished Dugu by removing him from his post as the prefect of Ding Prefecture (ÂÆöÂ∑û, roughly modern Baoding, Hebei). The other members of the Wang clan were exiled, but on their way plotted rebellion, and were all executed. Of all of the contenders to rule the empire during Sui's disintegration, Wang was one of the most reviled by traditional historians. The Later Jin historian Liu Xu, the lead editor of the Old Book of Tang, commented: :Wang Shichong was a wicked man who happened to encounter an incompetent ruler. He flattered the emperor and did what others could not have done in exchange for wealth and honor. To his subordinates, he used wrongful rhetoric to hide his own faults and suppress dissent. He finally usurped the throne, carried out improper acts, and killed many cruelly. He used false expressions of empathy to control his officials. His subordinates were almost all rebels or desperate men. He finally surrendered to the Prince of Qin and was quite fortunate that he was not publicly beheaded.

When used to implement a set of stacks, the structure is called a spaghetti stack, cactus stack or saguaro stack (after the saguaro, a kind of cactus). Parent pointer trees are also used as disjoint-set data structures. The structure can be regarded as a set of singly linked lists that share part of their structure, in particular, their tails. From any node, one can traverse to ancestors of the node, but not to any other node. Use in compilers A compiler for a language such as C creates a spaghetti stack as it opens and closes symbol tables representing block scopes. When a new block scope is opened, a symbol table is pushed onto a stack. When the closing curly brace is encountered, the scope is closed and the symbol table is popped. But that symbol table is remembered, rather than destroyed. And of course it remembers its higher level \\"parent\\" symbol table and so on. Thus when the compiler is later performing translations over the abstract syntax tree, for any given expression, it can fetch the symbol table representing that expression's environment and can resolve references to identifiers. If the expression refers to a variable X, it is first sought after in the leaf symbol table representing the inner-most lexical scope, then in the parent and so on. Use as call stacks The term spaghetti stack is closely associated with implementations of programming languages that support continuations. Spaghetti stacks are used to implement the actual run-time stack containing variable bindings and other environmental features. When continuations must be supported, a function's local variables cannot be destroyed when that function returns: a saved continuation may later re-enter into that function, and will expect not only the variables there to be intact, but it will also expect the entire stack to be present so the function is able to return again. To resolve this problem, stack frames can be dynamically allocated in a spaghetti stack structure, and simply left behind to be garbage collected when no continuations refer to them any longer. This type of structure also solves both the upward and downward funarg problems, as a result first-class lexical closures are readily implemented in that substrate. Examples of languages that use spaghetti stacks are: * Languages having first-class continuations such as Scheme and Standard ML of New Jersey * Languages where the execution stack can be inspected and modified at runtime such as Smalltalk * Felix * Cilk Mainframe computers using the Burroughs Large Systems architecture and running the MCP operating system can spawn multiple tasks within the same program. Since these were originally ALGOL-based systems so have to support nested functions, the result is that task creation results in a fork in the stack, which Burroughs informally described as a \\"saguaro stack.\\".

At its peak, it numbered around 10,000‚Äì15,000 adherents. The movement was severely crippled during the Philippine Revolution after the Philippine Constabulary took over patrols in Samar, when the U.S. military declared the island as \\"pacified\\". Description An agimat, intended to be worn with a necklace. Pulahanes practiced a syncretic religious revival centered mostly on Philippine mythology and Folk Catholicism. Individual beliefs include the anting-antings as well as the revival of the babaylan. Indigenous fighting techniques such as eskrima were also used in the elite and ferocious combat style. They practiced a form indigenous martial arts called Derobio Eskrima and they specialize using a heavy, crescent-shaped bolo knife in their battles. Religious rituals using bottles of holy oil, prayer books such as the Bible, consecrated anting- anting, as blessings before battles. Americans have described Pulahanes as notorious fighters and are experts in hand-to-hand combat. War cries were also common among their fighters. They have also been described as lacking in strategy due to their high casualty figures in battles such as the Massacre at Dolores. They were the subject of many laws passed during the early American colonial period and have often been accused of banditry. George Curry, Governor of Samar, wrote about the Pulahan in a 1907 report: \\"...Pulahanes are nearly all ignorant, superstitious persons, and are easily influenced for good or for evil. It is therefore necessary that they be closely watched and brought under our influence, to the end that within a few years they may no longer have the desire to lead a wild and lawless life. They are not naturally bad people, and I know that they can be reclaimed to civilization if brought under the influences mentioned above. Missionaries are badly needed for these people. They are all naturally religious and a good priest could exercise more influence over them than anyone else. \\" History The 19th century saw the rise of the dios-dios \\"shamans\\". Dios-dios (literally \\"god pretender\\" or \\"false god\\", from Spanish dios) were religious leaders so named because of their penchant for identifying themselves with Christian religious figures. They led cult-like religious movements, promising prosperity, supernatural powers, or healing to their followers. Most were mere charlatans selling amulets and magical pieces of paper. Their members were mostly from the illiterate rural poor who had little knowledge of formal Catholic teachings and were living in extreme poverty under colonial rule. The dios-dios movement was initially purely religious. There are numerous examples of dios-dios leaders in the 19th century. They include Lungao, a healer from Ilocos who claimed he was Jesus Christ in 1811; Ignacio Dimas, who led the \\"Tres Cristos\\" (\\"Three Christs\\") of Libmanan, Nueva C√°ceres (modern Camarines Sur) who claimed they had supernatural powers over diseases in 1865; Benedicta, an old woman and a healer who called herself \\"La Santa de Leyte\\" (\\"The Saint of Leyte\\") in 1862 and prophesied that the island of Leyte would sink; Clara Tarrosa, an eighty-year-old babaylan in Tigbauan, Iloilo in the late 1880s who proclaimed herself the Virgin Mary and isolated herself and her followers from Spanish rule; Francisco Gonzalez (alias \\"Francisco Sales\\" or \\"Fruto Sales\\") of Jaro, Leyte who claimed in 1888 that he was a king sent to save people from another great flood by leading them to a city that would rise from the waves; and many more. These movements were usually suppressed by the Spanish by imprisoning their leaders or exiling them. =Dios-Dios Rebellions of the 19th century= The movement began on 1887, when Ponciano Elofre the Cabeza de Barangay of Zamboanguita, Negros Oriental, failed to collect all the taxes from his constituents. As a response Spanish soldiers beat his father, Cris Elofre, to death to teach him a lesson. Thereafter, he rallied the people against the forced payment of taxes to the Spanish government. His movement would soon incorporate religious freedom, as well as the celebration of the ancient rites of the babaylan (shaman), with the intention of reviving aspects of Philippine mythology. He renamed himself as Dios Buhawi (literally \\"Whirlwind God\\") and proclaimed himself the savior of the people. Emulating the ancient asog shamans, he dressed in women's clothing and assumed feminine mannerisms even though he was married to a woman. He claimed supernatural powers much like the ancient dalagangan. He called his followers \\"Pulahanes\\", who numbered about 2,000 (whom the Spanish authorities called the babaylanes) and would regularly attack Spanish-controlled towns. Despite its momentum, the movement was unable to achieve its goals. The activities of Elofre so alarmed the Spanish colonial government that Governor-General Valeriano Weyler sent 500 men of the Guardia Civil and a battleship to Negros to deal with the threat. In 22 August 1887, Elofre raided Siaton, the town adjoining Zamboanguita, and was killed in the encounter with colonial forces. His wife, Flaviana Tubigan, and relatives attempted to continue the movement, but they were eventually captured and exiled by Spanish authorities. They were succeeded by Ka Martin de la Cruz, of Tolong in southern Negros Oriental, Elofre's lieutenant. De la Cruz' command of the babaylanes degenerated into banditry. When the Spanish authorities failed in their bid to capture him, on 11 September 1893, de la Cruz was killed in a trap laid by his own mistress, Alfonsa Alaidan. The remaining Buhawi followers, were later recruited by Papa Isio when he began to organize his own group of babaylanes in another revolt against Spain.Calma, Ma.

Note his \\"Papal vestments\\" and the woman's dress worn by the man to his left. The last significant dios-dios rebellion in the 19th century was led by Dionisio Magbuelas, better known as Papa Isio, meaning \\"Pope Isio\\". Papa Isio was a son of migrants from Panay. By 1880 at 34 years old, he was involved in a scuffle with a Spaniard. Fearing reprisal from the colonial government, he fled to the mountains, where he met Dios Buhawi, leader of the Pulahanes. He joined the Dios Buhawi group. In 1896 Papa Isio organized his own babaylanes group from remnants of Buhawi's followers, in Himamaylan, Negros Occidental.Cuesta, Angel Martinez, OAR: History of Negros., Historical Conservation Society, Manila, 1980 During his leadership, the movement would become more organized and he led a new revolt beginning in Himamaylan.Cuesta, Angel Martinez, OAR: History of Negros., Historical Conservation Society, Manila, 1980 The movement would continue until the Philippine Revolution in August 1898. During this era, the movement rapidly gained adherents and began setting up base camp on the slopes of Mt. Kanlaon. Soon, they began to have sympathy for the Katipunan, and entered a pact with Aniceto Lacson and Juan Araneta, leaders of the Katipunan- affiliated Negros Revolution. After the formation of the Republic of Negros in November 1898, tensions began to arise with their new allies. This led to a boiling point when the leaders of this republic signed a treaty with the United States. Papa Isio immediately withdrew his allegiance from this government and began his new offensive.http://www.cockatoo.com/english/philippines/philippines_islands_negros_revolution.htm After the Philippines was ceded to the United States after the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War, Papa Isio was initially made \\"military chief\\" of La Castellana, Negros Occidental under the American government. However, he picked up armed resistance again in 1899 during the Philippine‚ÄìAmerican War. His movement ended on 6 August 1907, when Papa Isio surrendered to American authorities and was sentenced to death. This was later commuted to life imprisonment and he died in the Manila Bilibid Prison in 1911. Another dios- dios uprising was led by a shaman named Gregorio Lampinio (better known as \\"Gregorio Dios\\", and also known as \\"Hilario Pablo\\" or \\"Papa\\") in Antique from 1888. The uprising was formed near Mount Balabago, a sacred pilgrimage site for shamans. Lampinio led a force of around 400 people. They collected contribuciones babaylanes (a revolutionary tax), disseminated anti-colonial ideas, and launched attacks on towns in Antique and Iloilo. The group was eventually suppressed by the Guardia Civil by 1890. =The Pulahan campaign= Concurrent with Papa Isio's rebellion in Negros Occidental against American rule, the dios-dios movement in eastern Visayas turned their attention to the new American colonial government. Calling themselves the Pulajanes (\\"those who wear red\\"). Like their predecessors, they claimed supernatural powers and used fetishistic amulets, holy oils, and magic spells in battle. They attacked both American troops and local Filipinos cooperating with the American colonial government. James Francis Smith, Governor-General of the Philippines, wrote about the Pulahanes in a 1906 report: \\"To many the word \\"pulahan\\" is synonymous with that of bandit or robber. This designation... is hardly proper. The pulahanes of Leyte and Samar can hardly be called robbers or thieves. Indeed, as a rule the pulahan is hard working, industrious, and not at all disposed to violence unless impelled to it by long continued wrongs or by the potent influence of religious fanaticism. All the trouble in Leyte and in Samar was due in a large degree to injustices perpetrated upon the people... Education and just treatment will make out of the pulahan a good citizen\\" Leyte Dagami on 11 June 1907. From 1902 to 1907 the Pulahanes challenged the American authorities in Leyte, led by Faustino Ablen (\\"Papa Faustino\\"), an illiterate peasant who assumed the title of pope. Ablen claimed to have supernatural powers and sold anting-anting that would render one invisible to the enemy and holy oil that could cure any ailment. Ablen promised his followers that after victory, he would lead them to a mountain top on which stood seven churches made of gold, and they would be re-united with dead relatives and lost carabaos. Ablen's troops attacked American forces and captured weapons where they could, however their primary weapon remained the bolo. They would also attack Filipino's who collaborated with the Americans. For example, during the raid on Carigara, they beheaded the local presidente, killed his wife and kidnapped his children. They did not harm innocent locals, their only purpose was to obtain weapons and wreak vengeance on the town police. Despite determined campaigns by the Constabulary, the revolt continued to grow. In some battles, the movement managed to deploy five hundred to one thousand men. The government was so alarmed that it offered a 2000 peso reward for Papa Faustino, dead or alive. US Major General Leonard Wood sent four battalions of the US Army to Leyte to crush the rebellion. This finally broke the rebellion into exceedingly smaller groups that were forced to deploy guerilla tactics. On May 25, 1907, Papa Faustino's wife and family were captured. On June 11, 1907, a detachment of Philippine Scouts chanced upon four Pulahan fighters and opened fire. Three men escaped, but one was captured. He was Papa Faustino. With his capture, the rebellion in Leyte came to an end. Samar After Emilio Aguinaldo's surrender to the Americans in the Philippine-American War in 1901, the resistance continued in Samar, led by general Vicente Lukb√°n. The hardships the local population went through by the hands of the US Army, such as the genocidal March across Samar, instilled a deep hatred for the Americans among the Samare√±o's.. Thus, after Lukban's secret headquarters along the Cadac-an River was taken over by the Americans on 17 November 1901, several rebel leaders refused to surrender and retreated to the interior of the island, including Lukban who had escaped. Among the rebel leaders were Pablo Bulan (\\"Papa Pablo\\"), Antonio Anugar, and Pedro de la Cruz. All of them were members of the Dios-Dios. After Lukban was captured on 18 February 1902, Papa Pablo became the leader of the resistance. From 1902 to 1904, Papa Pablo built up his forces in the mountains, which were estimated at 7,000 by 1903. After the Americans brought them the same corrupt officials, new taxes and laws, the local population began to join the Pulahanes and launch attacks on the government. Colonel Enrique Villareal Dagohob (or Daguhob) was a college-educated native of Bicol, who served in the Siege of Catubig on April 1900.Linn, B.M., The Philippine War, 1899‚Äì1902, Lawrence: University Press of Kansas, He was jailed in his native Masbate from 1902, under the name Andres Villasis (which according to the Philippine Commission was probably his real name), until 24 February 1903. On this day he escaped with five other accomplices. After escaping jail, he went to Leyte and became a prominent military leader, where he was known as Enrique Villareal. In the spring of 1904, he went to Samar under the new pseudonym Dagohob, which means \\"strong wind\\" or \\"thunder\\" in the Visayan language. He left Leyte for Samar because of the more favorable war conditions and the strained relations with other Pulahanes. After his arrival, Dagohob set up a base in Catubig in Eastern Samar. After being given a considerable amount of freedom by the Pulahan leaders, perhaps because of his superior education, Dagohob quickly took over the leadership of northeastern Samar and bolstered the Pulahan movement on the island. Dagohob planned to drive the local population into the mountainous interior of the island by the destruction of towns and villages, after which they would be influenced to join the resistance. The government responded by stationing troops and warning the local residents not to leave their settlements. As the Pulahanes had grown too strong for the Constabulary and Philippine Scouts to handle, the US Army relieved the Constabulary forces in December 1904. However, attacks continued and more weapons were captured. The Constabulary forces were then sent into the heart of Pulahan territory. One detachment established a fort at San Ramon, which the Pulahanes soon attacked. The following description of the assault was made: A devastating battle for the movement was the Battle of Dolores River on 12 December 1904, in Samar, when over 1,000 Pulahanes led by Pedro de la Cruz were massacred by the 38-man contingency of the United States-led Philippine Constabulary. The 38th was ambushed en route, by over 1,000 Pulahanes. As the Pulahanes rushed, waving colorful banners and shouting \\"Tad-Tad!\\" (Cut To Pieces!) they were met with a volley of rifle-fire that stopped their advance. The Constables held their ground and repelled the attacks, inflicting heavy losses with accurate and steady rifle fire. The Pulahanes were far greater in number, however, and they eventually wiped out the entire scout force. Of the 43-man contingent, the officer and 37 of his men were killed. The Pulajans on the other hand, suffered much heavier losses. Estimates range as high as 300 dead before the Constabulary fell. The pulahan fighters were able to capture 38 Krags rifles, along with a large amount of ammunition.Foreman, J., 1906, The Philippine Islands, A Political, Geographical, Ethnographical, Social and Commercial History of the Philippine Archipelago, New York: Charles Scribner's Sons After several captures of guns by the Pulahanes, their force grew stronger, both in firepower and in the boldness of the fighters. By February 1905 the Pulahanes dominated many areas of the island. The government had practically no control of Samar, which was limited to military posts. To make headway, eastern Samar was placed under complete control of the regular army, while the Constabulary retained control over the more peaceful western side. In a surprise attack in July 1905, American troops killed Dagohob, after which many of his followers surrendered and resistance in the area he controlled stopped. In August, Antonio Anugar was also killed. Early in 1906, Nazario Aguillar and 130 of his men agreed to surrender, however this was only a ruse, as during the surrender ceremony they suddenly attacked instead of giving up their arms. It was a suicidal attempt as 43 Pulahanes were killed, but they did kill 22 Constables. In November 1906, de la Cruz was killed in battle and a number of his officers were captured. A few days later, Constables attacked Papa Pablo's camp and killed him. Only one leader of importance remained, Isidro Pompac, also known as Otoy, who assumed control and the title of Papa. By this time, the Pulahanes were much weakened and Otoy roamed from place to place to evade capture. George Curry, Governor of Samar, wrote about the Pulahan in a 1907 report: \\"Pulahanism\\" has almost ceased to exist in this province (Samar). Otoy, assisted by Angeles and a few others, is in the mountains between Borongan and Basey with some fifty or sixty followers. They have been so closely pressed by the military, constabulary, and volunteers that they have not made an attack on any of the towns or force since November 1906. Since my last report, Papa Pablo, the religious head of the Pulahanes, Pedro de la Cruz, the fighting leader, Lucente Picardel, and several other leaders have been killed.\\" Major J.B. Murphy was senior inspector and leader of the Samar Philippine Constabulary, tasked with capturing Pulahan leadership. Curry appointed former Philippine Revolution Army Officers Congressman Eugenio Daza and Narciso Abuke to serve directly under Murphy as Captains. Daza oversaw East-Samar and Abuke West-Samar. As captains, they appointed subordinate officers and enlisted men. Many of the men Daza recruited served under him during the Philippine Revolution and Philippine-American War. Daza and Abuke led companies of 100 armed men each. Daza negotiated with, and arrested, Cipriano \\"Teducduc\\" Amango the leader of the Southeastern Samar Pulahan and leader of the Magtaon Attack. Teducduc was formerly a revolutionary under Daza during the Philippine-American War. In the barrio of Napta-an, Daza and his men encountered a major group of Pulahanes. Daza's victory here is credited as the victory that led to the eventual defeat of the Pulahan in Samar. Murphy is credited with killing the religious head, Papa Pablo. Abuke and his men are credited with killing their fighting leader, Pedro de la Cruz and 20 of his men. Four years later on 1 October 1911, a Constabulary force managed to locate Otoy's small band and killed them. This ended the Pulahan resistance. In Samar alone, 7000 Pulahanes had died.

Publication history Named after the minutemen of the American Revolution and sporting an American flag-inspired costume, he was originally published by Fawcett Comics in Master Comics #11-49 (Feb 1941-April 1944). He also had his own self-titled comic for three issues published Summer 1941 - Spring 1942. Along with other Fawcett characters, he was purchased by DC Comics, and made brief appearances in the Shazam! comics in 1976, and the Power of Shazam! comic in 1995 and 1996. Fictional character biography During World War II, Jack Weston is an Army private in prime physical condition who dons a patriotic costume and becomes the Minute-Man, a \\"One Man Army\\" who combats enemy agents. His double identity is known to his superior officer General Milton, who sends the Minute-Man on unsanctioned missions behind enemy lines. Minute-Man serves as a member of a group of local Fawcett City heroes, the Crime Crusaders Club. According to Jess Nevins' Encyclopedia of Golden Age Superheroes, \\"his nemesis is the femme fatale Illyria, Queen of the Spies, but he also fights rebellious Haitian natives, robot spies, ten foot tall Nazi monsters, the Black Poet, agents of the Black Dragon Society, the evil Toymaker, mad scientists, mummies, vampires, and head hunters\\". Prior to DC Comics' Crisis on Infinite Earths miniseries, Minute-Man was said to exist on the parallel Earth-S, home of the Fawcett heroes. He makes his first appearance in Shazam! when he rescues Billy from Mr. Mind and the Rainbow Squad, who have captured and gagged him. Cap feels unable to fight females, so Minute-Man shows him he can do it, inspiring Cap to beat the Squad, and reveal their leader Mr. Wonderful is really his old enemy, the super-intelligent alien worm Mr. Mind. In this incarnation, the character was also a member of the Squadron of Justice, a team of Fawcett characters who joined forces with the Justice League and Justice Society. He was incorporated into the mainstream DC Universe in the wake of the Crisis. In the new timeline, Weston defends Fawcett City for a time following the war with his fellow heroes. Eventually retiring from costumed heroism, he is shown to have become a government agent in the Power of Shazam! series, serving as an occasional ally to Captain Marvel. =Death= In Justice Society of America (vol.3) #3, Jack Weston (mistakenly referred to as Jack Burton), his children and grandchildren are killed in their sleep by an unknown assassin in their home in Clearwater, Florida. Minute-Man was one of three patriotic superhero bloodlines destroyed by the efforts of Vandal Savage, along with the bloodlines of Mr. America, Commander Steel and General Glory. Savage wished to stop the prevalence of relatives taking on the heroic identities and/or powers of their loved ones. Reception In American Comic Book Chronicles: 1940-1944, Kurt Mitchell and Roy Thomas discussed the merits of the early Minute-Man stories: \\"The strip began as a lazy imitation of Captain America: given a top-secret commission to ferret out and smash subversive threats to the nation as the patriotically garbed Minute-Man, Jack Weston posed as an ordinary private as cover. There was no origin, no explanation for his extraordinary fighting prowess, no kid sidekick or grotesque Nazi villains, for Minute-Man was stuck in the world of fictitious fascist nations that [Joe] Simon and [Jack] Kirby scorned as too timid for the times\\".

It uses a linear combination of configuration state functions (CSF), or configuration determinants, to approximate the exact electronic wavefunction of an atom or molecule. In an MCSCF calculation, the set of coefficients of both the CSFs or determinants and the basis functions in the molecular orbitals are varied to obtain the total electronic wavefunction with the lowest possible energy. This method can be considered a combination between configuration interaction (where the molecular orbitals are not varied but the expansion of the wave function) and Hartree‚ÄìFock (where there is only one determinant, but the molecular orbitals are varied). MCSCF wave functions are often used as reference states for multireference configuration interaction (MRCI) or multi-reference perturbation theories like complete active space perturbation theory (CASPT2). These methods can deal with extremely complex chemical situations and, if computing power permits, may be used to reliably calculate molecular ground and excited states if all other methods fail.  Introduction  For the simplest single bond, found in the H2 molecule, molecular orbitals can always be written in terms of two functions œáiA and œáiB (which are atomic orbitals with small corrections) located at the two nuclei A and B: : \\\\varphi_i = N_i(\\\\chi_{iA} \\\\pm \\\\chi_{iB}), where Ni is a normalization constant. The ground-state wavefunction for H2 at the equilibrium geometry is dominated by the configuration (œÜ1)2, which means that the molecular orbital œÜ1 is nearly doubly occupied. The Hartree‚ÄìFock (HF) model assumes that it is doubly occupied, which leads to a total wavefunction : \\\\Phi_1 = \\\\varphi_1(\\\\mathbf{r}_1) \\\\varphi_1(\\\\mathbf{r}_2) \\\\Theta_{2,0}, where \\\\Theta_{2,0} is the singlet (S = 0) spin function for two electrons. The molecular orbitals in this case œÜ1 are taken as sums of 1s atomic orbitals on both atoms, namely N1(1sA + 1sB). Expanding the above equation into atomic orbitals yields : \\\\Phi_1 = N_1^2 \\\\left[ 1s_A(\\\\mathbf{r}_1) 1s_A(\\\\mathbf{r}_2) + 1s_A(\\\\mathbf{r}_1) 1s_B(\\\\mathbf{r}_2) + 1s_B(\\\\mathbf{r}_1) 1s_A(\\\\mathbf{r}_2) + 1s_B(\\\\mathbf{r}_1) 1s_B(\\\\mathbf{r}_2) \\\\right] \\\\Theta_{2,0}. This Hartree‚ÄìFock model gives a reasonable description of H2 around the equilibrium geometry about 0.735 √Ö for the bond length (compared to a 0.746 √Ö experimental value) and 350 kJ/mol (84 kcal/mol) for the bond energy (experimentally, 432 kJ/mol [103 kcal/mol]). This is typical for the HF model, which usually describes closed-shell systems around their equilibrium geometry quite well. At large separations, however, the terms describing both electrons located at one atom remain, which corresponds to dissociation to H+ \\\\+ H‚àí, which has a much larger energy than H + H. Therefore, the persisting presence of ionic terms leads to an unphysical solution in this case. Consequently, the HF model cannot be used to describe dissociation processes with open-shell products. The most straightforward solution to this problem is introducing coefficients in front of the different terms in Œ®1: : \\\\Psi_1 = C_\\\\text{ion} \\\\Phi_\\\\text{ion} + C_\\\\text{cov} \\\\Phi_\\\\text{cov}, which forms the basis for the valence bond description of chemical bonds. With the coefficients Cion and Ccov varying, the wave function will have the correct form, with Cion = 0 for the separated limit, and Cion comparable to Ccov at equilibrium. Such a description, however, uses non-orthogonal basis functions, which complicates its mathematical structure. Instead, multiconfiguration is achieved by using orthogonal molecular orbitals. After introducing an anti-bonding orbital : \\\\phi_2 = N_2 (1s_A - 1s_B), the total wave function of H2 can be written as a linear combination of configurations built from bonding and anti-bonding orbitals: : \\\\Psi_\\\\text{MC} = C_1 \\\\Phi_1 + C_2 \\\\Phi_2, where Œ¶2 is the electronic configuration (œÜ2)2. In this multiconfigurational description of the H2 chemical bond, C1 = 1 and C2 = 0 close to equilibrium, and C1 will be comparable to C2 for large separations.  Complete active space SCF  A particularly important MCSCF approach is the complete active space SCF method (CASSCF), where the linear combination of CSFs includes all that arise from a particular number of electrons in a particular number of orbitals (also known as full-optimized reaction space (FORS-MCSCF)). For example, one might define CASSCF(11,8) for the molecule NO, where the 11 valence electrons are distributed between all configurations that can be constructed from 8 molecular orbitals.  Restricted active space SCF  Since the number of CSFs quickly increases with the number of active orbitals, along with the computational cost, it may be desirable to use a smaller set of CSFs. One way to make this selection is to restrict the number of electrons in certain subspaces, done in the restricted active space SCF method (RASSCF). One could, for instance, allow only single and double excitations from some strongly occupied subset of active orbitals, or restrict the number of electrons to at most 2 in another subset of active orbitals.

Early life Duff was born in Charleston, Washington (now part of Bremerton). He graduated from Roosevelt High School in Seattle in 1932, where he began acting in school plays after he was cut from the school basketball team. Thereafter, he worked locally in the theater in Seattle until he entered the United States Army Air Corps during World War II, where he was eventually assigned to their radio service. He announced re-broadcasts prepared for the Armed Forces Radio Service (AFRS). In this role, he served as the announcer for the drama Suspense, dated March 16, 1943. Career =Sam Spade= Duff's most memorable radio role was as Dashiell Hammett's private eye Sam Spade in The Adventures of Sam Spade (1946‚Äì1950). With his TV and film career starting to take hold, he ultimately left the program in 1950 at the start of its final season; Stephen Dunne took over the voice role of Spade. =Contract with Universal= Duff was signed to a long-term contract with Universal, and made his film debut alongside Burt Lancaster as an inmate in 1947's Brute Force. The movie was produced by Mark Hellinger and directed by Jules Dassin, who gave Duff a bigger role in their next film, The Naked City (1948). He subsequently reunited with Lancaster for the family drama All My Sons (also 1948), based on the play of the same name by Arthur Miller. More substantial roles soon followed, with Duff taking the lead in numerous Westerns and films noir including Illegal Entry, Red Canyon, Johnny Stool Pigeon, Calamity Jane and Sam Bass (all 1949);Panther's Moon, Shakedown and Woman in Hiding (all 1950). The latter film saw Duff act alongside his future wife Ida Lupino; the couple would subsequently co-star in a further four films during the 1950s. In 1951, Duff made a pilot for a new radio series, The McCoy. Following his marriage to Lupino in October 1951, Duff was granted a release from his contract with Universal. =Freelance actor= Duff appeared in the 1952 film That Kind of Girl (aka Models Inc), and also featured in Spaceways, and Roar of the Crowd (both 1953), the latter for Monogram Pictures, which ultimately made Jennifer (also 1953), the second movie in which he starred alongside his wife. His other film appearances beside his wife; Don Siegel's Private Hell 36 (1954); Lewis Seiler's Women's Prison (1955), and Fritz Lang's While the City Sleeps (1956) continued Duff's successful run of movies during the 1950s. =Television= In addition to his movie roles, Duff also experienced success in television, with appearances in the 1950s series The Star and the Story, Climax! and Crossroads. From January 1957 to July 1958, he appeared with Lupino in the CBS sitcom Mr. Adams and Eve, which revolved around the private lives of two fictitious film stars Howard Adams and Eve Drake. They also served as producers. Other TV roles included an appearance in NBC's western series Bonanza, playing a young Samuel Langhorne Clemens in his early life in the West as a satirical and crusading journalist, in the first-season episode \\"Enter Mark Twain\\". Duff also featured in episodes of numerous TV series during the 1960s including The Twilight Zone, Burke's Law, The Eleventh Hour, Mr. Novak and Batman (the latter in an episode entitled \\"The Entrancing Dr. Cassandra\\", alongside wife Ida Lupino). In 1963 Duff appeared as Ed Frazer on The Virginian in the episode titled \\"A Distant Fury.\\" Duff had the lead role in the short-lived TV series Dante (which ran for only one season; 1960‚Äì61), but found greater success as Detective Sergeant Sam Stone in the ABC police drama Felony Squad (1966‚Äì69). Duff appeared in all 73 episodes of the series during its three-season run, alongside his co-stars Dennis Cole and Ben Alexander. He also directed one episode; \\"The Deadly Abductors\\". Duff also directed 7 episodes of the 1960s TV sitcom Camp Runamuck. Publicity photo of Howard Duff, working in front of the camera and behind the scenes, for the television program Felony Squad =Later career= Duff continued to make guest appearances in TV series during the 1970s including The Streets of San Francisco, Police Story and The Rockford Files amongst others, and also featured in the TV movies A Little Game (1971) and Snatched (1973). In 1971 Duff appeared as Stuart Masters in \\"The Men From Shiloh\\" (rebranded name for the TV western The Virginian) in the episode titled \\"The Town Killer.\\" Duff was part of an ensemble cast in the 1978 comedy film A Wedding, and had a prominent role as the attorney to Dustin Hoffman's character in the Academy Award-winning Kramer vs. Kramer (1979). In 1980 he played Charles Slade in the 1980 mini series The Dream Merchantshttps://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080659/ Duff portrayed villain Jules Edwards in Part 1 of the 1981 mini-series East of Eden, and was part of the main cast in the TV series Flamingo Road (1980‚Äì82), appearing in all 38 episodes of the show. He continued to make guest appearances in TV series during the 1980s, including Charlie's Angels (1980) (as bumbling private eye Harrigan in the episode \\"Harrigan's Angel\\"); Murder, She Wrote (1984), Magnum, P.I. (1988) (as Capt. Thomas Magnum, II, the grandfather of main character Thomas Magnum, played by Tom Selleck), and Dallas (also 1988). Duff also had a recurring role as Paul Galveston during the sixth season of Knots Landing (1984‚Äì85), appearing in 10 episodes. He returned for one more episode in 1990. Although Duff made few film appearances during the 1980s, he did have a prominent role in the 1987 thriller No Way Out, alongside Kevin Costner and Gene Hackman. In 1990, shortly before his death, Duff made his final acting appearances in the TV series Midnight Caller and The Golden Girls, and the film Too Much Sun. Personal life Duff had a tempestuous relationship with actress Ava Gardner in the late 1940s. In October 1951, he married Ida Lupino. After he was listed in Red Channels as a communist subversive in 1950, he lost his radio work and might have forfeited his entire career had it not been for his marriage. Duff and Lupino had a daughter, Bridget Duff (born April 23, 1952). The couple separated in 1966 but did not divorce until 1984. He subsequently married Judy Jenkinson. Like former wife Lupino, Duff was a staunch Democrat. =Death= Duff died at age 76 of a heart attack on July 8, 1990 in Santa Barbara, California. Complete filmography *Brute Force (1947) ....

They are exclusively synthetic. A well known carbodiimide is dicyclohexylcarbodiimide, which is used in peptide synthesis. Dialkylcarbodiimides are stable. Some diaryl derivatives tend to convert to dimers and polymers upon standing at room temperature, though this mostly occurs with low melting point carbodiimides that are liquids at room temperature. Solid diaryl carbodiimides are more stable, but can slowly undergo hydrolysis in the presence of water over time. Structure and bonding End-on view of the C(NC3)2 core of C(NCHPh2)2 as determined by X-ray crystallography (color scheme: gray = C, blue = N) Side-on view of the C(NC3)2 core of C(NCHPh2)2 as determined by X-ray crystallography. From the perspective of bonding, carbodiimides are isoelectronic with carbon dioxide. Three principal resonance structures describe carbodiimides: :RN=C=NR ‚Üî RN+‚â°C-N‚àíR ‚Üî RN‚àí-C‚â°N+R The N=C=N core is relatively linear and the C-N=C angles approach 120¬∞. In the case of C(NCHPh2)2, the central N=C=N angle is 170¬∞ and the C-N=C angles are within 1¬∞ of 126¬∞. The C=N distances are short, nearly 120 pm, as is characteristic of double bonds. Carbodiimides are chiral, possessing C2-symmetry and therefore axial chirality. However, due to the low energy barrier to the molecule rotating and thereby converting quickly between its isomers, the actual isolation of one optical isomer of a carbodiimide is extremely difficult. It has been demonstrated at least once, in the case of conformationally restricted cyclic carbodiimides; though there are other reports of one-handed axially chiral carbodiimides, their validity has since been called into question on experimental and computational grounds. The parent compound, methanediimine, (HN=C=NH), is a tautomer of cyanamide. Synthesis =From thioureas and ureas= A classic route to carbodiimides involves dehydrosulfurization of thioureas. A typical reagent for this process is mercuric oxide: :(R(H)N)2CS + HgO ‚Üí (RN)2C + HgS + H2O This reaction can often be conducted as stated, even though carbodiimides react with water. In some cases, a dehydrating agent is added to the reaction mixture. The dehydration of N,N'-dialkylureas gives carbodiimides: :(R(H)N)2CO ‚Üí (RN)2C + H2O Phosphorus pentoxide and p-Toluenesulfonyl chloride have been used as a dehydrating agents. =From isocyanates= Isocyanates can be converted to carbodiimides with loss of carbon dioxide: :2 RN=C=O ‚Üí (RN)2C + CO2 The reaction is catalyzed by phosphine oxides. This reaction is reversible. Reactions Compared to other heteroallenes, carbodiimides are very weak electrophiles and only react with nucleophiles in the presence of catalysts, such as acids. In this way, guanidines can be prepared. As weak bases, carbodiimides bind to Lewis acids to give adducts. =Moffatt oxidation= Carbodiimides are reagents for the Moffatt oxidation, a protocol for conversion of an alcohol to a carbonyl (ketone or aldehyde) using dimethyl sulfoxide as the oxidizing agent: :(CH3)2SO + (CyN)2C + R2CHOH ‚Üí (CH3)2S + (CyNH)2CO + R2C=O Typically the sulfoxide and diimide are used in excess. The reaction generates dimethyl sulfide and a urea as byproducts. =Coupling agents= In organic synthesis, compounds containing the carbodiimide functionality are used as dehydration agents. Specifically they are often used to convert carboxylic acids to amides or esters. Additives, such as N-hydroxybenzotriazole or N-hydroxysuccinimide, are often added to increase yields and decrease side reactions. Amide coupling utilizing a carbodiimide Polycarbodiimides can also be used as crosslinkers for aqueous resins, such as polyurethane dispersions or acrylic dispersion. Here the polycarbodiimide reacts with carboxylic acids, whose functional groups are often present in such aqueous resins, to form N-acyl urea. The result is the formation of covalent bonds between the polymer chains, making them crosslinked. Amide formation mechanism The formation of an amide using a carbodiimide is a common reaction, but carries the risk of several side reactions. The acid 1 will react with the carbodiimide to produce the key intermediate: the O-acylisourea 2, which can be viewed as a carboxylic ester with an activated leaving group. The O-acylisourea will react with amines to give the desired amide 3 and urea 4. The possible reactions of the O-acylisourea 2 produce both desired and undesired products. The O-acylisourea 2 can react with an additional carboxylic acid 1 to give an acid anhydride 5, which can react further to give the amide 3. The main undesired reaction pathway involves the rearrangement of the O-acylisourea 2 to the stable N-acylurea 6. The use of solvents with low dielectric constants such as dichloromethane or chloroform can minimize this side reaction. The reaction mechanism of amide formation using a carbodiimide Examples =DCC= Structure of dicyclohexylcarbodiimide DCC (acronym for N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide) was one of the first carbodiimides developed as a reagent. It is widely used for amide and ester formation, especially for solid-phase peptide synthesis. DCC has achieved popularity mainly because of its high-yielding amide coupling reactions and the fact that it is quite inexpensive. However, DCC does have some serious drawbacks, and its use is often avoided for several reasons: #The byproduct N,N'-dicyclohexylureais mostly removed by filtration, but trace impurities can be difficult to remove. It is incompatible with traditional solid-phase peptide synthesis. #DCC is a potent allergen, and repeated contact with skin increases the probability of sensitization to the compound. Clinical reports of individuals who cannot enter rooms where peptide coupling agents are used have been reported. =DIC= Structure of N,N'-Diisopropylcarbodiimide In contrast to DCC, DIC (N,N'-diisopropylcarbodiimide) is a liquid. Its hydrolysis product, N,N'-diisopropylurea, is soluble in organic solvents. =EDC= EDC is a water-soluble carbodiimide reagent used for a wide range of purposes. Apart from uses similar to those of DCC and DIC, it is also used for various biochemical purposes as a crosslinker or chemical probe. =CMCT or CMC= 1-cyclohexyl-(2-morpholinoethyl)carbodiimide metho-p-toluene sulfonate is a carbodiimide developed for the chemical probing of RNA structure in biochemistry.

Publication history Created by writer Otto Binder and artist C.C. Beck, he first appeared in Captain Marvel Adventures #8 (March 6, 1942). Fictional character biography Ibac's alter-ego is Stanley \\"Stinky\\" Printwhistle, a crook who attempts to blow up a bridge, but is caught in the explosion and thrown off due to Captain Marvel. He is saved by Lucifer, who offers Printwhistle the chance to become a champion of evil and defeat Captain Marvel in exchange for his mortal soul. Printwhistle accepts, Lucifer summons up four historical villains, and Printwhistle is told to speak the magic word \\"IBAC\\". By doing so, the frail, grey-haired criminal transforms into Ibac, a brutal muscleman with a buzz cut. Saying \\"IBAC\\" again transforms Ibac back into Printwhistle. When he first appears he is defeated when Captain Marvel hits him so hard he seems to knock the evil power from him, in the form of leaving Printwhistle and the four other villains in front of him, the four fade away quietly, but Ibac later returns when the evil spirits contact him. Captain Marvel whirls Ibac around so fast that the four evil spirits separate from him. Because he has not been able to defeat Captain Marvel, Printwhistle has not been obliged to give his soul to the devil, and has reformed, but being weak-willed, he has often been forced by other criminals into becoming the evil Ibac again. In his first Silver Age appearance in Shazam #4 (July 1973), the spirits of the villains who gave him his powers telepathically communicate with him, and force him to become Ibac as he has reformed and been a street sweeper for the last ten years. They order him to capture, then destroy, Billy. He succeeds in surprising, capturing, and leaving a bound and gagged Billy in a building about to be blown up, but Billy is able to use a recording of his voice to summon Captain Marvel and beat up Ibac. After being defeated, his benefactors withdraw their powers from him. However this may not be possible Post-Crisis. Ibac was a member of both the Pre-Crisis Monster Society of Evil during WW II, in which he nearly killed Billy in Africa after giving him bound and gagged to cannibals, and the Society formed years later. While Captain Marvel is empowered by six mythological and Biblical figures, Ibac is empowered by four of the most evil and terrifying men to have ever walked the earth: Ivan the Terrible, who supplies Terror, Cesare Borgia, who gives Ibac Cunning, Attila the Hun, who gifts him with Fierceness, and Caligula, the sponsor of Cruelty. While Captain Marvel transforms using magic lightning bolts, Ibac's transformations are accomplished with the power of mystical green fire and brimstone. This also gives him superhuman strength and stamina. In his second appearance in Captain Marvel Adventures #9 Beautia Sivana saying 'Ibac' next to Ibac after his transformation transforms her into a black haired woman wearing a black dress, though she still has her own personality and turns back when saying 'Ibac' again. In Justice League of America #135 (October 1976) Ibac is one of the villains of three Earths working for King Kull. Spy Smasher battles Ibac, and is on the verge of losing when he remembers what Captain Marvel told him of the villain. Spy Smasher then taunts the dim-witted villain, telling him to \\"back down\\". Ibac responds proudly: \\"I back down for nobody!\\" The phoenetic \\"I back\\" causes him to revert to Stinky Printwhistle's form. In Shazam #29 (May‚ÄìJune 1977), his original benefactor Prince Lucifer gives him greater power briefly, but he turns back on purpose to escape the affections of villainess Aunt Minerva after getting advice from Solomon. Before the Crisis on Infinite Earths, Ibac is a member of the Monster Society Of Evil, a team of Captain Marvel's greatest enemies, and joined the first Silver Age version. More recently, he has turned up in Villains United as a member of the Secret Society of Super Villains. One Year Later, Ibac appeared in the Secret Six series, still with the Society, battling the second Ragdoll on the orders of the Society. Ragdoll escapes, leaving a wounded Ibac. (Secret Six 02, 2006) Ibac is seen among the captured villains in Salvation Run. There he is in Camp Lex and starts an argument with the people that are not working to help build the machine they need to escape back to Earth. Ibac was also in the DC Holiday Special '09 issue fighting Captain Marvel once again, but in the spirit of the holiday, cease fighting and work together to rebuild what they destroyed during their brawl. Captain Marvel gives him amnesty to walk away free. In the last panel, both are shown at a soup kitchen in their human forms, but neither recognizes the other's alter-ego.DC Holiday Special '09 (February 2010) =The New 52= In September 2011, The New 52 rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, Ibac is depicted as an evil barbaric ruler who enslaved the Khandaq people before being defeated and turned into stone by Black Adam whose family he murdered. Centuries later one of his descendants takes the same name only to be also killed by Adam.Justice League of America (vol. 3) #7.4 (November 2013) Powers and abilities Ibac has superhuman strength (almost on par with Captain Marvel, but not equally as strong), speed, agility and endurance which he gets by saying \\"IBAC\\". He also turns back by saying \\"IBAC\\" making him, like Captain Marvel Jr. unable to identify himself by name. He has some protection from physical and energy attacks. In his Ibac form, Stanley possesses the following attributes: * I for the Terror of Ivan the Terrible - Superhuman Stamina * B for the Cunning of Cesare Borgia - Invulnerability * A for the Fierceness of Attila the Hun - Superhuman Strength * C for the Cruelty of Caligula The Pre-Crisis version claimed not to have invulnerability, however he was very resistant.

He plans to attack humanity in prehistoric times, allowing the Hiss-Men to take over by using a device which turns humans into Hiss-Men and kidnapping humans from the present. Ibac is defeated and left in the past being chased by a dinosaur while the Marvels take the technology. * Ibac makes a brief cameo in Batman: The Brave and the Bold episode \\"The Malicious Mr. Mind.\\" He is seen as one of the members of The Monster Society of Evil fighting against the Marvel Family and Batman. * Ibac is mentioned in the Young Justice episode \\"Misplaced.\\" Cat Grant is reading a news report that states he and Sabbac had been defeated by Captain Marvel earlier in the day. * Ibac appears in the DC Nation short SHAZAM!: Courage.

The exterior of the 1993 SVT Cobra was similar to that year's GT model with differences explained below. The upgrades were beneath the bodywork and featuring a V8 engine, producing at 4,600 rpm and of torque at 4,000 rpm. According to Road & Track, this could send a Cobra through the 1/4 mile in 14.5 seconds at a trap speed of 98 mph (158 km/h). Acceleration from zero to took 5.9 seconds. The drivetrain received an upgraded transmission, rear disc brakes, and for the first time on a factory Mustang, 17-inch unidirectional wheels. Cobra models received a softer, more compliant ride compared to the GT model. This was accomplished with model-specific springs and sway bars.  Engine  The 1993 SVT Cobra's short block (cylinder block, crankshaft, rods, and pistons) was carried over from the GT model. To this, Ford SVT engineers added the following performance items: * Cylinder Heads ‚Äî GT-40 \\"High Flow\\" Cast Iron heads were installed. They were milled for 62.5 cc combustion chambers. Valves measure 1.84\\" (46.7 mm) intake, and 1.54\\" (39.1 mm) exhaust. The valves are actuated by Cobra-specific 1.7 ratio roller rockers, constructed of aluminum and produced for Ford by Crane Cams. Part Numbers: F3ZZ-6049-B (head), F3ZZ-6507-A (intake valve), F3ZZ-6505-A (exhaust valve), and F3ZE-6529-AB (rockers). * Intake Manifold ‚Äî The Cobra upper manifold was unique to the 1993 Cobra and had a 2.75\\" (70.0mm) diameter round throttle body opening, diverting air into (8) round staggered ports, each 1.64\\" (41.7 mm) diameter. The lower manifold was identical to the GT-40 manifold used by Ford Racing; it redirects airflow to a rectangular port configuration as needed by the cylinder heads. Part Numbers: F3ZZ-9424-C (upper manifold) and F3ZZ-9424-D (lower). * Camshaft ‚Äî The cam is of the hydraulic roller type (same as the GT). However, the Cobra cam has unique specifications of 0.479\\"/0.479\\" (12.2 mm/12.2 mm) intake/exhaust lift, (209¬∞/209¬∞) duration at 0.050\\" (1.27 mm), and a lobe separation of 118.3¬∞, Part Number: F3ZE-6250-CA. * Air/Fuel Delivery ‚Äî The increased airflow and fuel consumption of the Cobra required these upgraded components: Larger (compared to the GT) 24 lb/hr fuel injectors, 2.75\\" (70.0 mm) MAF meter, 2.56\\" (65.0 mm) throttle body, and matching EGR plate handle the increased breathing of the motor. A specially calibrated X3Z EEC-IV engine control unit runs the system. Part Numbers: F1TZ-9F593-C (injectors), FIZF-12B579-AA (meter), and F3ZF-12A650-CA (ECU). * Accessories ‚Äî The crankshaft pulley diameter decreased by 14% (as compared to the GT) in order to under-drive the alternator, A/C, and smog pump, all to increase power. The water pump pulley also decreased in diameter by the same amount in order to preserve the ratio of pump speed, and thus coolant flow. These smaller accessory pulleys necessitated a shorter serpentine belt. Part Numbers: F3ZZ-6A312-A (crank pulley), F3ZZ-8509-A (water pump pulley), and F3ZZ-8620-A (belt). * Exhaust ‚Äî To extract the maximum amount of power from the Cobra's powerplant, Ford engineers used tuned mufflers with lower restriction (as compared to the GT). While the factory headers and H-pipe remained the same, the tailpipes were similar to that of a Mustang LX 5.0L (Sport) model in that they had straight stainless steel tips (instead of turn-down tips on the GT). This is because the Cobra had a revised rear fascia, allowing (unlike the GT) for an exposed dual exhaust. Part Numbers: F3ZZ-5230-A, stamped F3ZC-5230-CC (RH muffler) and F3ZZ-5230-A, stamped F3ZC-5232-DC (LH muffler).  Drivetrain  With the increased engine output of the new Mustang SVT Cobra, the Borg-Warner World Class T-5 transmission needed an internal upgrade, which allowed it to yield a higher torque capacity compared to the standard World Class T-5. This upgrade consisted of custom gearing 1‚Äì3 (which were reduced by 10% and hardened), 4th/5th (just hardened) gear was the same as standard T-5s found in the LX/GTs. The holding capacity of the Cobra's clutch was increased by way of a higher clamping force pressure plate using the same 10-inch diameter as the GT/LX.  Suspension  * Shocks/Struts ‚Äî The Cobra outsourced production of shocks and struts to the aftermarket manufacturer Tokico. The components used were specifically valved for the new car. Part Numbers: F3ZZ-18124-A (front struts) and F3ZZ-18125-A (rear shocks).  Exterior Styling  The Cobra featured a more subdued styling than the GT.  Paint and Interior Trim  The 1993 Cobra was available in four exterior paint choices, as shown in the table below. Interior color choices were opal gray cloth, black cloth, and opal gray leather. { class=wikitable !Paint Code!!Paint Color - ! ES align=leftVibrant Red Clearcoat - ! EY align=leftVibrant Red* - !

Notice that the SVT Cobra and Mustang GT hatchback shared the same code for the body style/model number. Also, the street-spec Cobra and the race-ready Cobra R shared the same codes for body style, model number, and engine. { class=wikitable !Digit(s)!!Component!!Code!!Meaning - ! 1 align=leftCountry of manufacture align=left1 align=leftUnited States of America - ! 2‚Äì3 align=leftManufacturer align=leftFA align=leftFord Motor Company - ! 4 align=leftRestraint system align=leftL align=leftActive safety belts with driver and front passenger airbags - ! 5 align=leftType of vehicle align=leftP align=leftPassenger vehicle - ! 6‚Äì7 align=leftBody style/model number align=left42 align=leftGT/Cobra hatchback - ! 8 align=leftEngine align=leftD align=left4.9 L V8, OHV EFI Horsepower: @ 4600 rpm Torque: @ 4000 rpm - ! 9 align=leftCheck digit align=left0‚Äì9 or X align=leftVaries per VIN - ! 10 align=leftModel year align=leftP align=left1993 - ! 11 align=leftAssembly plant align=leftF align=leftDearborn Assembly Plant - ! 12‚Äì17 align=leftSequential production number align=left100001‚Äì999999 align=leftVaries per vehicle }  1993 SVT Cobra base prices  { class=wikitable !Model!!VIN Code!!MSRP - !

Cobra R hatchback align=centerP42D align=left$25,692 } = 1993 Cobra R = The 1993 Cobra R was the first of three Cobra R models produced, and it was an extremely exclusive vehicle. As the \\"R\\" designation in its name stood for \\"Race\\", the car did not have a radio, speakers, wiring and antenna, air conditioner, foglights, sound deadener, rear seat, rear safety belts, rear carpeting, and roll-up cargo cover, among other items. There were no power options; the car had power steering, roll-up windows, manual door locks, and manual-adjustable mirrors. Also, manually-adjustable Opal Gray cloth bucket seats from the Mustang LX were lighter than the GT/Cobra sport seats, and a piece of thin gray carpeting secured by Velcro covered the bare hatch and rear seat area. The deletion of all this equipment shed some 450 pounds, but it was somewhat offset by the necessary addition of heavy-duty hardware to enable the car to handle the rigors of competition. To stiffen the chassis, a strut tower brace was installed to tie the cowl together, and a pair of V-braces (used on all 1983‚Äì1993 Mustang convertibles) attached in an X-pattern tied the subframes together. The Cobra R featured Eibach springs that were a bit too stiff for the street, but perfect on a racetrack. The Cobra R also benefitted from the adjustable Koni shocks and struts, helping to cement the car's reputation as a serious driving machine. The car also featured 13-inch Kelsey- Hayes vented rotors in front and 10.5-inch vented rotors in the back. According to Neil W. Ressler, the executive director of vehicle engineering for Ford Motor Company at the time and one of the founding fathers of SVT, the 1993 Cobra R's brakes \\"were the most expensive brakes ever fitted to a [production] Mustang. I bought the brakes for the R model out of my engineering budget. I wanted big brakes, and we didn't have them. The program couldn't afford it. Unbeknownst to the higher-ups at Ford, I spent like $2,100 per car to buy those big brakes. But the last thing I wanted was a fast car that didn't stop. We ended up putting good brakes on all those [Cobra R] vehicles.\\" The same 5.0L V8 from the street-spec Cobra was used in the race- ready Cobra R. However, the radiator was unique to the Cobra R, and a purge tank was installed for improved cooling. A power steering cooler (located behind the left foglight bezel) and an engine oil cooler were standard. The Cobra R wheels were actually the optional 17x8-inch five-lug wheels from the soon-to-be-released 1994 Mustang GT, but they were painted gloss black with a chrome lug cover. The standard tires were Goodyear Gatorbacks. To give the car better front-end geometry, lower control arms from the 1994 Mustang were fitted. Contrary to SVT's stated wishes, many of these Cobra R models were purchased by private collectors and never actually driven, but several competed successfully in the International Motor Sports Association (IMSA) Firestone Grand Sport Series and Sports Car Club of America (SCCA) World Challenge Class B Series. Of the three Cobra R models produced, the 1993 model had the benefit of being the lightest and the smallest. Only 107 of these Cobra R models were produced, and all were painted in Vibrant Red Clearcoat. According to Ford's official announcement on April 7, 1993, the Cobra R was produced to take the Fox-bodied Mustang out in grand style, a \\"best of the last\\" model. According to SVT, each one could go 0-60 mph in 5.7 seconds and do a top speed of 140 mph. = 1993 Detailed Production Numbers =  Cobra Hatchback  { class=wikitable !Interior!!Black!!Vibrant Red!!Vibrant Red Clearcoat!!Teal Metallic!!Totals - !

It was the first major redesign since the third generation Fox-bodied Mustang was introduced for 1979. Known as Fox-4 (because it was based on the Fox platform as a 1994 model), the new 1994 Mustang was considered to be a vast improvement over the outgoing 1993 model. The new car's ride, handling, styling, ergonomics, and standard and optional equipment were all improved from the previous model. However, the Mustang was considered by some to be underpowered in its class as the Chevrolet Camaro Z/28 and Pontiac Firebird Formula and Trans Am, all redesigned for 1993, came standard with , while the 1994 Mustang GT engine only put out . Thus, a new SVT Cobra model was introduced to bridge that performance gap. The 1994 Cobra was introduced midway through the model year with the same beefed-up engine from the 1993 Cobra. With its GT-40 cast-iron heads and lower intake and its Cobra- specific upper intake, power increased incrementally to . However, the actual output of the Cobra's GT-40 enhanced engine was probably higher. Ford claimed 6.3 seconds to hit 60 mph and a top speed of . Muscle Mustangs & Fast Fords magazine tested a 1994 Cobra coupe and ran 0-60 mph in 5.7 seconds and the quarter mile in 13.87 seconds at 99.49 mph. Initially, the 1994 SVT Cobra was only available as a coupe, but the first factory-produced SVT Cobra convertible was the 1994 Indy 500 Pace Car Replica. On the same day that the new 1994 Cobra coupe was launched, SVT announced that it would be building a Cobra convertible (the first factory-produced \\"Cobra\\" convertible since the 1970 Shelby models) and that this new convertible had been selected to pace the 1994 Indianapolis 500 (see the next section). The new Cobra convertible, or Indy 500 Pace Car Replica, was made available later in the 1994 model year.  SVT Cobra versus Mustang GT  The 1994 Cobra began the tradition of offering refinements that differentiated it from the lower trim level Mustang models. According to Jim Campisano's book Powered by SVT: Celebrating a Decade of Ford Performance, below is a list of items that set the 1994 SVT Cobra apart from the 1994 Mustang GT: Body and appearance components * Unique front fascia with round foglights (versus rectangular on GT). * Unique complex- reflector headlights (Cobra only). * Chrome Cobra badges on front fenders (versus GT emblems). * Unique rear spoiler with integrated LED stop lamp (versus the non-LED stop lamp integrated into the decklid on GT). * 160-mph speedometer, white-faced instrument gauges, and black lettering (versus 150-mph speedometer, black-faced gauges, and white lettering in GT). * Leather-wrapped shift knob, boot, and parking brake (Cobra only). * Magnesium front seat-cushion frames (Cobra only). * Unique Cobra floor mats. Engine and chassis * GT-40-style 5.0L Cobra V8 engine (versus High Output 5.0L V8 on GT). * 13-inch vented front disc brakes, 11.65-inch rear discs with dual-piston calipers, and standard ABS (versus 10.8\\" vented front discs, 10.5-inch rear discs with single-piston calipers, and optional ABS on GT). * Unique 17x8-inch cast-aluminum wheels. * Standard Goodyear GS-C P255/45ZR17 tires (versus Goodyear Eagle P225/55ZR16 standard on GT, P245/45ZR17 optional on GT). * Unique chassis tuning.  Paint and interior trim  The 1994 Cobra was available in three exterior paint colors, as shown in the table below. Interior color choices were black cloth, saddle cloth, black leather, and saddle leather. On the 1994 Cobra convertible (see the next section about the 1994 Indy 500 Pace Car Replica), the vinyl top was only available in saddle, and this convertible top was the same one used on regular Mustang convertibles.

Indy 500 Pace Car Replica align=centerP45D align=left$26,845 } = 1994 Indy 500 Pace Car Replica = To celebrate the Ford Mustang turning 30 years old in 1994, a trio of SVT Cobra convertibles served as pace cars for the 78th Indianapolis 500 race on May 29, 1994. The three cars were modified by Jack Roush at his shop in Allen Park, Michigan, for heavy-duty pacing on race day. The pace cars were installed with heavy-duty four-speed automatic transmissions, 15-gallon racing fuel cells, heavier rear springs (to accommodate the weight of television camera equipment), a Halon fire-extinguisher system, a rollbar with 50,000-watt strobe lights built in, and special lights in the rear spoiler. Parnelli Jones, a seven-time Indy 500 competitor who won the 1963 race, drove the official pace car at the event. To commemorate the special occasion, SVT produced 1,000 Indy 500 Pace Car Replicas for the buying public. All 1,000 cars were painted Rio Red and fitted with Saddle leather interiors and matching Saddle vinyl tops. These special editions had the Indy 500 winged- tire logo emblazoned as a chrome cloisonn√© badge on the decklid and embroidered on the front seatbacks. A set of \\"Official Pace Car\\" decals came with each special-edition Cobra. These decals were not installed at the factory; rather, they were shipped inside the trunk and left to the buyer's discretion to install them. There was one very small difference between the decals worn by the three official pace cars and the replicas' decals. The tire logo on the official decals was white, and on the replica decals, it was gray. The 1994 SVT Mustang Cobra was only the third Ford Mustang chosen for official pace car duties at the Indianapolis 500 race. The other two Mustangs that served as official Indy 500 pace cars were the very first Mustang in 1964 and the newly-redesigned Fox-bodied Mustang in 1979. = 1994 detailed production numbers =  Cobra Coupe  { class=wikitable !Interior!!Crystal White!!Black!!Rio Red!!Totals - !

The chrome SVT badge on the decklid was new for all SVT vehicles this year. A new vertical spat was added to the leading edge of each rocker panel extension to prevent rock damage to the lower body. The Cobra convertible returned this year for a limited production run of 1,003 units, and all were painted Black and fitted with Saddle leather interiors and Black convertible tops. Newly available for the 1995 Cobra convertible was a removable hardtop option. This was a one-year-only option due to its $1,825 price and 90 pounds of additional weight; thus, only 499 of the 1,003 Cobra convertibles built this year had this option. Removing or installing the hardtop was a two-person job, and this hardtop could not easily fit any other Mustang or Cobra convertible from this vintage due to the latching mechanisms of the fiberglass top and the dome light wiring. Included with this option, a convenient carrier that rolled on four casters allowed for easier storage of the hardtop when it was not being used. This hardtop option was originally supposed to be an available option for the all-new 1994 Mustang convertible, but it was delayed due to supply problems and quality-control concerns. This hardtop option was also available on the 1995 Mustang GT convertible. The biggest news for 1995 was the return of the street-legal, race-ready SVT Cobra R (see the next section).  Paint and Interior Trim  The 1995 Cobra was available in the same three exterior paint colors from 1994, as shown in the table below. Interior color choices were the same as in 1994: black cloth, saddle cloth, black leather, and saddle leather. On the 1995 Cobra convertible, the vinyl top was only available in black, and this convertible top was the same one used on regular Mustang convertibles.

The top priority became addressing customer requests for a larger, more powerful engine and more fuel capacity. In response to those requests, SVT replaced the Cobra's 5.0 L V8 with an SVT modified version of Ford's 5.8 liter Windsor V8, re-engineered to produce , and installed a 22-gallon fuel cell. To handle the torque of the more powerful engine, a Tremec 3550 5-speed manual transmission was installed. See also 5-speed T-5 manual. Again, weight-savings were targeted, so there was no back seat, radio, power windows/seats, or air-conditioning‚Äînot even fog lights, which were omitted to provide ducts for getting cool air onto the front disk brakes. Heavy-duty progressive-rate springs, thicker stabilizer bars, and a front strut tower brace helped improve handling on the racetrack. The 95 R was available only in white with saddle cloth interior, each with a unique center- tiered fiberglass hood tall enough to clear the engine and induction system. Only 250 vehicles were built; Ford kept 18 examples for its press and engineering fleets. Unlike the 93 Cobra R, one could only obtain a 95 R if they held a valid competition license (or owned a race team). This provision was added after Ford discovered that most of the 93 R's that were sold ended up in the hands of collectors. = 1995 Detailed Production Numbers =  Cobra Coupe  { class=wikitable !Interior!!Crystal White!!Black!!Rio Red!!Totals - !

Starting with the 1996 model year, every Cobra engine was hand- assembled by two-person teams at the Ford Romeo Engine Plant in Romeo, Michigan, a practice that continued through the remainder of SVT Cobra production. Each engine had a label (later, a metal plaque on the 2003‚Äì2004 Cobra engines) bearing the names and signatures of the two engine builders. The Romeo engine, as it was called, produced and of torque, enabling the new Cobra to go 0-60 mph in 5.9 seconds and do the quarter mile in 13.99 seconds at 101.6 mph. However, Car and Driver magazine was able to hit 60 mph in 5.4 seconds and the quarter mile in 14.00 seconds at 102 mph during a comparison test in their December 1995 issue. The 1996 Cobra engine redlined at 6,800 rpm, with fuel shut-off occurring at 7,000 rpm. Ford's modular V8 debuted in the all-new 1992 Ford Crown Victoria as a single-overhead-cam (SOHC) setup, and then the engine really displayed its power potential with 32 valves, dual overhead cams (DOHC), and in the all-new 1993 Lincoln Mark VIII. The modular engine's aluminum block was cast in Italy by Teksid, a firm that produces parts for Ferrari and Formula One racers. SVT fitted the 1996 Cobra with the Borg Warner T-45 5-speed manual transmission, which was also used in the Mustang GT.

Paint and interior trim  The 1996 Cobra was available in four exterior paint colors, as shown in the table below. Interior color choices were the same as before: black cloth, saddle cloth, black leather, and saddle leather.

Utilizing color-shifting ChromaFlair pigments from Flex Products, the Mystic paint shifted from green to amber to gold to purple depending on the angle and the availability of light. The research and development process for this paint took three years to complete. Only available on the Cobra coupe, the Mystic paint option cost $815 at the time, and the 1996 Mystic Cobra was the first production vehicle to wear a color-shifting factory paint job. A total of 1,999 Mystic Cobras were produced, and of these, 1,990 had black leather interiors and nine had black cloth interiors. Since the paint continues to have special proprietary uses, any remaining quantities are tightly controlled and thus require a VIN verification through a complying Ford body shop to obtain the special paint to repaint any damaged areas.SVT Cobra Recognition Guide, 1996 SVT News pamphlet = 1996 detailed production numbers =  Cobra Coupe  { class=wikitable !Interior!!Crystal White!!Black!!Laser Red!!Mystic!!Totals - !

Only an astute observer noticed that the honeycomb grille from before was now absent to allow more airflow into the larger radiator included across the entire Mustang lineup, and the 1997 Cobra had a larger diameter fan. Also new was a parallel-flow air conditioning condenser that was exclusive to the SVT Cobra. The rear spoiler was now optional, as it had been standard on all previous models.  Paint and interior trim  The only other major changes for 1997 was in the color palette. The 1997 Cobra was available in four exterior colors, as shown in the table below. The interior choices were the same as what was offered in 1996: black cloth, saddle cloth, black leather, and saddle leather. On Cobra convertibles, the vinyl top was again available in black, saddle, or white, and this convertible top was the same one used on regular Mustang convertibles. { class=wikitable !Paint Code!!Paint Color - !

One noticeable change was the wheels, which were similar to the cast-aluminum units used on the 1995 Cobra R. Only this time, the wheel cutouts were painted gray, and the wheels were 17x8-inch, instead of 17x9-inch versions on the 1995 Cobra R. Tires were the same BF Goodrich Comp T/A versions as before. Other minor changes included a redesigned console in which the dashboard-mounted digital clock pod was deleted, and the clock function was then integrated into the radio's digital display. Also, the standard premium sound system now included a single-disc CD player. This was also the last year of the return- style fuel system, as it was replaced with a newer returnless system for 1999.  Paint and interior trim  The 1998 Cobra was available in five exterior colors, as shown in the table below. Chrome Yellow was added midyear on the 1998 Cobra. The interior choices were the same as before: black cloth, saddle cloth, black leather, and saddle leather. However, the leather pattern changed. On Cobra convertibles, the vinyl top was again available in black, saddle, or white, and this convertible top was the same one used on regular Mustang convertibles.

The facelifted car featured newly redesigned body panels that followed Ford's new worldwide styling direction. Thus, the interior was basically a carryover from the 1994‚Äì1998 Mustangs, and most of the parts were interchangeable. All 1999‚Äì2004 SVT Cobras featured independent rear suspension, unique to only the Cobra. A new returnless fuel system was used which helped Ford meet tightening emission standards. The new 1999 Cobra had an upgraded 4.6L DOHC V8 engine rated at and of torque. However, when the new 1999 Cobras were put through their paces by their new owners, it was revealed that 0-60 mph times were slower than a comparably-equipped 1998 model, and dyno tests suggested that the advertised power output was closer to , even though Ford claimed that the engine was outputting 15 hp more than the 1998 Cobra engine. Due to this outcry, on August 6, 1999, Ford halted the sales of all unsold 1999 Cobras on dealership lots and recalled all 1999 Cobras that had been sold. Ford replaced the intake manifold, certain computer components, and the exhaust system from the catalytic converters to the tailpipes to achieve a \\"true\\" 320 hp at the crankshaft.  Paint and interior trim  The 1999 Cobra was available in four exterior paint colors, as shown in the table below. Interior color choices were limited to two offerings: dark charcoal and medium parchment. The standard leather seats were the same optional leather units used in the 1999 Mustang GT, but without the embroidered running pony logo on the front seatbacks. Cloth seats were no longer offered on the Cobra, as they were never popular with buyers in previous model years. On Cobra convertibles, the vinyl top was available in black, parchment, or white, and this convertible top was the same one used on regular 1999 Mustang convertibles. { class=wikitable !Paint Code!!Paint Color - !

As the standard 2000 Cobra was cancelled due to problems with the 1999 Cobras, the Cobra R was SVT's sole high-performance Mustang for the 2000 model year. The new Cobra R came standard with a DOHC V8 engine with a 6,500 rpm redline that was rated at at 5,700 rpm and of torque at 4,500 rpm. However, independent dyno tests have shown that the Cobra R produced rear-wheel output that nearly matched both of those numbers, suggesting the engine may have been underrated. The cast-iron block was based on the 5.4L block that Ford used in its trucks at the time. The cylinder heads were later used in the 2005‚Äì2006 Ford GT, albeit slightly modified. Some sources claimed that the Australian FPV GT's engine was very similar to the Cobra R's mill. As with previous Cobra R models, the 2000 model was designed to be a race-ready, high-performance vehicle in a perfectly street-legal package; as such, it lacked many of the comforts that the standard Cobra enjoyed. This model had no radio/audio equipment, no air conditioning, no cruise control, and no rear seat. Each of the 300 units produced featured a Performance Red exterior and a Dark Charcoal interior with cloth Recaro bucket seats. The 2000 Cobra R had several distinguishing visual and performance features that set it apart from the standard 1999 or 2001 Cobra. The \\"power dome\\" hood was taller than the standard Cobra hood, and it had gills that could be cut out to help reduce engine compartment temperatures. The rear spoiler was tall and wide, providing much needed downforce at track speeds. The Cobra R was equipped with Eibach springs that lowered the car 1.5 inches in front and 1.0 inch out back. This model also used Bilstein shocks and struts, Brembo 4-piston front calipers acting on 13-inch rotors cooled by large ducts, along with a race-style fuel cell that was clearly protruding under the Mustang V6-style rear bumper. The front fascia was adorned with a low-riding, removable splitter. The wheels were also uniquely styled, silver-painted, five-spoke, x alloys with BF Goodrich G-Force KD tires. The hand-built SVT engine employed special DOHC cylinder heads, a \\"trumpet-style\\" intake manifold, aggressive camshafts, short tube headers connected to Cobra catalysts, a Bassani X-pipe, and a unique Borla dual side-exiting exhaust system, which was necessitated by the large fuel cell. This model also featured 3.55 gears, a Gerodisc hydro-mechanical differential with speed and torque sensitivity, and a Tremec T-56 6-speed manual transmission that was closely geared for drag racing or road course usage. Despite these close ratios, the 2000 Cobra R also enjoyed a 177 mph (282 km/h) top speed. A number of well-known makers of aftermarket performance parts for the Mustang were involved in this project, including Recaro, Brembo, McLeod, Eibach, BF Goodrich, Tremec, Borla, Dana, Federal Mogul, and K&N; (among others). The following is a list of parts on the 2000 Cobra R that differ from the standard 1999 Cobra: Exterior * Only available as a coupe. * Only available in Performance Red (paint code ES). * V6-style rear bumper with no exhaust cutouts. * 20-gallon Fuel Safe fuel cell, visible from behind and the side. * Borla side exhaust, since the standard exhaust would not fit due to the fuel cell. * Large unique wing on the rear decklid. * 18-inch five- spoke wheels. * Removable splitter on the front fascia. * Blacked-out headlights, which became standard on all 2001‚Äì2004 Mustangs. * Omitted fog lights (air ducts to the front brakes instead). * Special hood with a large dome to clear the huge intake. * Omitted antenna (covered with a black plastic piece). Interior * Only available in Dark Charcoal (trim code DW). * Cloth- upholstered Recaro seats (manually adjustable). * Backseat delete. * No air conditioning. * No radio. * No cruise control. Drivetrain * 5.4L DOHC V8 engine based on Ford's truck engines. * Tremec T-56 6-speed transmission. * 3.55:1 gears. * Hydro-mechanical lock differential. * 13-inch Brembo vented brake disks with 4-piston calipers in the front. * Vented brake disks in the rear. * Special Eibach shocks and springs, lowering the car by 1.5 inches in front and 1.0 inch in rear. A Quick Word on the 2000 SVT Cobra that never was... Because of the 1999 Cobra performance debacle, the standard 2000 SVT Cobra was pulled from production, only to return in 2001 rated at a true 320 hp. The production run of the 2000 SVT Cobra R (see below) went ahead without issue. Ford still printed brochures for the 2000 Cobra, with a print date of December 1999, four months after the 2000 model was officially canceled. The reason for this was because these brochures talked about the upcoming 2000 Cobra R. According to the 2000 Cobra brochure, if the 2000 Cobra had been produced, it would have been available in six exterior paint colors: Crystal White Clearcoat, Ebony (Black) Clearcoat, Laser Red Tinted Clearcoat, Medium Atlantic Blue Clearcoat Metallic, Silver Clearcoat Metallic, and (most notable) Mystic Gold. Apparently, Mystic Gold was supposed to be available in limited numbers late in the model year. After the 1996 Mystic Cobra, the 2000 Mystic Gold Cobra would have been the second time that a color-shifting paint was used on the Cobra. It was said that the Mystic Gold paint had a color shift from burnt orange to gold to yellow to pale green. Unfortunately, Ford made some changes to the painting process for the 2001 model year, and the Mystic Gold paint was incompatible with the new process. Thus, the 2000 Mystic Gold Cobra never saw the light of day, but a photograph of a prototype painted Mystic Gold will forever be memorialized in the 2000 Cobra brochure. Aside from paint colors, the standard 2000 SVT Cobra was pretty much a carryover of the 1999 model. Even the interior was supposed to be the same as in 1999. Only two color choices, dark charcoal, and medium parchment, were supposed to be offered again.  Paint and interior trim  The 2000 Cobra R was only available in one exterior paint color, as shown in the table below. The sole interior color choice was dark charcoal.

The WAP block is regarded to be weaker than the previous Teksid block. Some 2001 Cobras received the Teksid block, either from the factory or as a replacement motor. In the pictures at right, note the extra ribs designed to impart strength to the weaker WAP. Also, note that the hatching in the valley of the Teksid is square, while the WAP has diagonal hatching. * Revised cylinder heads. Cobra owners have reported a \\"ticking\\" or \\"pinging‚Äù noise coming from the driver-side head of their cars. Due to insufficient cooling around cylinders #6/#7/#8 which caused the valves to overheat and therefore seat improperly, Ford remedied the situation by issuing a technical service bulletin (TSB#03256/NHTSA#10008278 and TSB#03164/NHTSA#10003118) to remove and replace the affected heads with a version that featured improved coolant flow. * Cobra-specific seats with a combination of leather bolsters, Alcantara (suede-like microfiber) inserts, and larger headrests. 1999 Cobras had regular Mustang GT seats. * A rear bumper that reads \\"COBRA\\" instead of \\"MUSTANG\\" like on the 1999 Cobra. * A rear badge on the trunk lid was changed to read \\"SVT\\" instead of \\"SVT COBRA\\" like on the 1999 Cobra. * A new steering wheel and an upgraded Mach audio system. * The wheels for both the 1999 and 2001 Cobras were 17x8-inch. Silver- powdercoated, five-spoke aluminum wheels were available in 1999 and 2001, and chrome wheels of the same design were an available option for the 2001 Cobra. * The Tremec T-45 transmission in 1999 was replaced by the Tremec TR-3650 transmission in 2001. * The axle shafts and differential were changed from 28 splines in 1999 to 31 splines in 2001. * The rear decklid spoiler was redesigned. * The 1999 two-piece audio unit consisting of a radio with tape deck and a separate single-CD player was upgraded to a larger, single-face, 6-disc unit in 2001. * The center console and trim were redesigned. * The buttons for the fog lights, the rear window defroster, and the anti-skid system were moved to a panel below the new radio unit. * The emergency brake was fitted with a boot of leather to cover the cutout in the console. * The headlights were changed from a chrome background to a black background. The newer headlights are sometimes referred to as \\"smoked\\" or \\"tinted\\", but this only refers to the black background. The actual lenses are clear for both years. These blacked-out headlights were actually first used on the 2000 Cobra R and then across the entire Mustang lineup for the 2001 model year. * The color of the odometer digits and instrument cluster lighting was slightly changed. With the above list of changes, the 2001 Cobra was able to go 0-60 mph in 5.4 seconds and do the quarter-mile in 13.8 seconds at 102 mph. The cars were electronically limited to a top speed of 150 mph.  Paint and interior trim  The 2001 Cobra was available in eight exterior paint colors, as shown in the table below. There were only two interior color choices: dark charcoal (the interior was dark charcoal with the seats having dark charcoal leather bolsters with medium graphite Alcantara inserts) or medium parchment (the interior was medium parchment, but the seats had chocolate brown leather bolsters with medium parchment Alcantara inserts). The Cobra emblem on the front seatbacks was embroidered in a somewhat darker color than the suede inserts to provide a subtle contrast. On Cobra convertibles, the vinyl top was available in black, parchment, or white, and this convertible top was the same one used on regular 2001 Mustang convertibles. { class=wikitable !Paint Code!!Paint Color - !

The vehicles were based on the 2001-spec SVT Cobra. Other changes included additional driving lights in the lower front fascia to meet Australian lighting specifications, and the steering wheel was moved to the right side of the car. This was part of a $4 million program by Ford Australia to combat the rival Holden Monaro, which eventually formed the basis of the reborn 2004‚Äì2006 Pontiac GTO in the U.S. For more information about the Australian 2002 Cobras, see 2002 Mustang Cobra.

Code-named \\"Terminator\\" by the SVT development crew led by John Coletti, numerous improvements were made to the powertrain and driveline to handle the power increase from the previous model's set-up. A cast-iron block was used, instead of the previous Teksid aluminum unit, with stronger internals including Zollner pistons and forged Manley H-beam connecting rods that were modified with a wrist pin oiling hole by the SVT engineers. These upgrades were critical in order to support the of boost delivered from the stock Eaton M-112 roots-type supercharger. Other improvements included the use of a lightweight aluminum flywheel connected to a Tremec T-56 six-speed transmission, 3.55:1 rear axle ratio, and stronger 31-spline halfshafts with revised upper and lower control arms. These modifications enabled the Cobra to go 0-60 mph in 4.5 seconds and do the quarter mile in 12.67 seconds at 110.11 mph. Although electronically-governed to a top speed of 153 mph, a factory-stock Terminator Cobra can reach a top speed of just under 180 mph if the governor is removed. The 2003 Cobra boasted visual and functional improvements designed by Camilo Pardo, the chief designer of the 2005‚Äì2006 Ford GT supercar. These exterior differences included a new front fascia with an integrated spoiler and front brake air ducts, a new rear fascia with a black insert which visually integrated the exhaust pipes, a composite hood with dual functional heat extractors, newly designed side scoops, and foldable side-view mirrors painted in the matching body color. The side skirts were designed specifically for the Terminator Cobra body kit, featuring a smooth body line from the door to the bottom of the car. As a visual departure from the 1999, 2000, and 2001 Cobras (there was no 2002 Cobra model), which featured the Canadian Mustang taillights with separate amber turn signals, the 2003‚Äì2004 Cobras used standard red Mustang taillights with integrated turn signals. SVT also introduced new five-spoke 17x9-inch wheels, available in standard machined-faced aluminum with metallic argent-painted pockets or optional chrome. Finally, the Terminator Cobra sported a new decklid spoiler with an integrated LED brake light, as opposed to the wing-type spoiler seen on previous Cobras and the standard Mustang V6 and GT models. It was optional to delete the spoiler, and the brake light was then integrated into the decklid using conventional bulbs.  Paint and interior trim  By the end of the model year, the 2003 Cobra was offered in ten exterior paint colors, but initially, it was available in seven colors. Early 2003 Cobras built between May and September 2002 were produced concurrently with the 2002 Mustang V6 and GT models. Since Satin Silver and Mineral Grey were 2002 colors, they were replaced with Silver Metallic and Dark Shadow Grey Metallic, respectively, at the start of regular 2003 Mustang production on September 29, 2002. Redfire Metallic replaced Torch Red only because it was a new color for the 2003 model year; however, Torch Red would make a comeback at the end of the model year on the 10th Anniversary Edition (see the next section). All 2003 Cobras had Dark Charcoal interiors. The seats were upholstered with Dark Charcoal Nudo leather bolsters and suede inserts in either Medium Graphite (light gray) or Medium Parchment (tan). The Cobra emblem on the front seatbacks was embroidered in a color that matched the suede inserts; however, on the 10th Anniversary Edition, this same emblem was embroidered in dark charcoal-colored thread to contrast with the special red leather inserts. On Cobra convertibles, the canvas convertible top was either black or parchment depending on the color of the chosen suede seat inserts, and on 10th Anniversary Edition convertibles, the canvas convertible top was only available in black.

The car featured unique seven-spoke, dark argent-painted, 17-inch alloy wheels; Dark Charcoal interior with Colorado Red leather inserts on the seats; red inserts in the door panels; red-painted brake calipers; and special 10th Anniversary badges on the decklid and floormats. Also included were special carbon fiber- patterned leather wrapped around the shifter; emergency brake handle; and on the steering wheel at the 10, 2, and 6 o'clock positions. The Anniversary model was the first Cobra to feature a steering wheel with grip humps at the 10 and 2 o'clock positions. SVT produced 2,003 (same number as the model year) units of the Anniversary model at the end of the model year during June and July 2003, totaling 1,003 coupes and 1,000 convertibles. The 10th Anniversary models were only available in three exterior colors: Black (775 models), Torch Red (734 models), and Silver Metallic (494 models). The 10th Anniversary Edition package (order code 375A) was a $1,495 option. = 2003 detailed production numbers =  Cobra Coupe  { class=wikitable !Interior!!Oxford White!!Ebony!!Torch Red!!Redfire!!Zinc Yellow!!Sonic Blue!!Satin Silver!!Mineral Grey!!Silver!!Dark Shadow Grey!!Totals - !

The addition of a newly integrated shift light negated the $1,000 gas guzzler tax that was charged on the 2003 models. One notable new option across the entire Ford lineup was the available Sirius satellite radio; the distinguishing feature between the 2003 and 2004 factory sound systems was the \\"SAT\\" button on the 2004 system. The 2004 Cobra was produced between November 2003 and March 2004. It was a short model year for the 2004 Terminator Cobra, as well as the entire 2004 Mustang lineup, due to a number of reasons. The 2004 Mustangs and Cobras were the last Mustangs to be built at Ford's historic Dearborn Assembly Plant in Dearborn, Michigan, and Ford Motor Company had made the decision to end Mustang production there rather than updating the plant for the 2005 models. Thus, 2004 production was scheduled to wrap up by May 2004. Another reason was the hype over the all-new 2005 Mustang, which meant that Ford needed to start production as soon as possible at the newly updated Flat Rock Assembly Plant in Flat Rock, Michigan, then known as AutoAlliance International.  Paint and interior trim  The 2004 Cobra was available in eight exterior paint colors, as shown in the table below. Zinc Yellow was replaced by Screaming Yellow across the Mustang lineup for 2004; however, Sonic Blue Metallic and Dark Shadow Grey Metallic were still available on regular 2004 Mustangs. The seats were upholstered with Dark Charcoal Nudo leather bolsters and suede inserts in either Dark Charcoal or Medium Graphite. Medium Parchment suede inserts were no longer offered. The Cobra emblem on the front seatbacks was embroidered in a medium graphite- colored thread regardless of the color of the suede seat inserts; however, on the Mystichrome Cobra (see the next section), this same emblem was embroidered in dark charcoal-colored thread to contrast with the special Mystichrome leather inserts. On all 2004 Cobra convertibles, the canvas convertible top was only available in black, regardless of the color and material of the seat inserts. { class=wikitable !Paint Code!!Paint Color - !

According to SVT's press release, the Mystichrome Cobra was produced to help commemorate the Mustang's 40th anniversary year. SVT had recognized the importance of this milestone, and shortly after the success of the 1996 Mystic Cobra, SVT worked with Ford's product planners and outside vendors to build the ultimate special edition Cobra. DuPont was commissioned to work on an improved formulation of color-shifting paint that would be easier to use and match. The resulting Mystichrome paint, sold to BASF who finally supplied the paint to Ford, contained ChromaFlair pigments that rendered a shift from a bright topaz green to cobalt blue, then to royal purple, and finally to a deep onyx black. A high amount of metallic aluminum flakes were added to give the Mystichrome paint some sparkle. The paint is called \\"2004 Ford Mustang Cobra MystiChrome Metallic\\" and cost, at the time, about $150 per pint. As the Mystichrome paint is still very expensive, any kind of exterior damage to the car is financially problematic. If a damaged Mystichrome Cobra requires repainting at a reputable Ford dealer's body shop, a Ford employee from Dearborn headquarters is required to bring the paint in person and supervise the usage of the special paint. The damaged car must be verified that it is a factory-built Mystichrome Cobra. Once the body shop is finished using the Mystichrome paint, all unused paint must be put back in the can and sealed, and the supervising Ford employee returns to Dearborn with the unused paint. SVT worked with Garden State Tanning to produce the Mystichrome leather found on the car's seat inserts and the steering wheel at the 10, 2, and 6 o'clock positions. The production process for the Mystichrome leather included tanning and dying the leather jet black, spraying the Mystichrome paint directly onto the leather, and sealing it with a clear layer to protect and prevent damage to the Mystichrome-painted leather. Like the 2003 10th Anniversary Cobra, the Mystichrome Cobra featured a steering wheel with grip humps at the 10 and 2 o'clock positions. The Mystichrome Cobra came standard with the five-spoke 17-inch chrome wheels. The Mystichrome Cobra was produced between December 2003 and January 2004. A total of 1,010 Mystichrome Cobras were produced, 515 coupes and 495 convertibles. The Mystichrome Appearance Package (order code 68M), as it was officially called by Ford, was only a $3,650 option. A definitive history of the Terminator Cobra and John Coletti's SVT operations was captured in the non-fiction book Iron Fist, Lead Foot by Frank Moriarty.

Background The Pulahanes in July 1904 slaughtered the people of Taviran and then burned the town of Santa Elena. In December, over a thousand Pulahanes besieged a detachment of native scouts in the town of Taft. Battle In December 1904, the 38th Philippine Constabulary Scouts, under Lieutenant Stephen Hayt, were on patrol along the Dolores River in an attempt to link up with the 37th Constabulary Scouts and another Constable Company led by Lieutenant Hendryx. The 38th was ambushed en route, by over 1,000 Pulahanes. As the Pulahanes rushed, waving colorful banners and shouting \\"Tad- Tad!\\" (Cut To Pieces!) they were met with a volley of rifle-fire that stopped their advance. The Constables held their ground and repelled the attacks, inflicting heavy losses with accurate and steady rifle fire. The Pulahanes were far greater in number, however, and they eventually enveloped and wiped out the entire scout force. Aftermath Of the 43 man contingent, the officer and 37 of his men were killed.Foreman, J., 1906, The Philippine Islands, A Political, Geographical, Ethnographical, Social and Commercial History of the Philippine Archipelago, New York: Charles Scribner's Sons The Pulajans on the other hand, suffered much heavier losses. Estimates range as high as 300 dead before the Constabulary fell. The pulajan fighters were able to capture 38 Krags rifles, along with a large amount of ammunition.

He was created by Chad Grothkopf (1914‚Äì2005),Chad Grothkopf at the Lambiek Comiclopedia. Accessed December 26, 2011. and debuted in Fawcett's Funny Animals #1 (Dec. 1942). Hoppy later became a property of DC Comics, and has made periodic appearances in stories related to Captain Marvel, today also known as Shazam. Publication history In 1942, Fawcett Comics, decided to add a funny animal comic book to accompany its line of superhero, movie, and adventure comics. Chad Grothkopf, an artist with experience at DC Comics and Timely Comics, was tapped to come up with concepts for Fawcett's Funny Animals comic; his creations included Willie the Worm, Shelock Monk and Chuck, and Hoppy, a rabbit who dreamed of being strong. For the latter character, Grothkopf added elements from Fawcett's popular Captain Marvel strips, and the lead strip for Funny Animals was set as Hoppy the Marvel Bunny. Hoppy debuted in Fawcett's Funny Animals #1, and appears in nearly every issue of that comic's run. He also starred in his own 15-issue series, Hoppy the Marvel Bunny (Dec. 1945 ‚Äì Sept. 1947), which featured several Hoppy stories per issue, along with stories featuring his old co-stars from Fawcett's Funny Animals. One of his foes is Captain Black Bunny, the lagomorph equivalent of Captain Marvel's foe Black Adam. Hoppy's stories include \\"Hoppy the Marvel Bunny and the Paper Dolls of Victory!\\", \\"The Keepers of the Winds\\" and \\"Hoppy Duels with Stinger Bee.\\" For a span of five issues (#49‚Äì54, May‚ÄìOct. 1947), Hoppy made no appearances in Fawcett's Funny Animals; these issues featured Billy the Kid and Oscar as the lead feature. Beginning with #55, Hoppy returned as the main feature. In Fawcett's Funny Animals #69 (Feb. 1951), the Captain Marvel Bunny stories were dropped, replaced by more standard funny- animal stories with just Hoppy. There was no further mention of his career as Captain Marvel Bunny. In issue #80 the word \\"Fawcett's\\" was dropped from the title, making the remaining issues simply Funny Animals. The final issue of Funny Animals was #83 (1953). After Fawcett cancelled Funny Animals, the rights to many of its characters were purchased by Charlton Comics. Charlton resumed publication of \\"Funny Animals\\" with #84 and continued the series to #91 (February 1956). Hoppy also appeared in Charlton's Atomic Mouse, though these stories appear to be edited reprints from Fawcett's Funny Animals. For these reprints, Charlton removed the lightning bolt from Marvel Bunny's suit and recolored the costume, changing his name to Magic Bunny and his magic word to \\"Alizam!\\". He is alternately referred to in various Charlton books as \\"Hoppy\\", \\"Happy\\", \\"Happy the Magic Bunny\\" and, according to one source,Rovin, Jeff The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Cartoon Animals, Prentice Hall Press, New York, 1991, p. 125 \\"Speedy\\". After the Fawcett characters were purchased by DC Comics, Hoppy returned in DC Comics Presents #34 (June 1981). Hoppy has turned up sporadically since, primarily in Captain Carrot and His Amazing Zoo Crew! in The Oz-Wonderland War #2, in The Power of Shazam! #29, and in Tiny Titans #15. A modernized version of Hoppy has made a handful of appearances in the revamped New 52/DC Rebirth interpretation of Shazam!, beginning in 2012. Fictional character biography Hoppy is a pink rabbit who lives in the town of Funny Animalville, along with an assortment of other funny animal characters. As revealed in the origin story from Fawcett's Funny Animals #1, Hoppy is a fan of Captain Marvel. One day, he decides to emulate his hero and speaks the magic word \\"Shazam!\\" Surprisingly, the magic word transforms Hoppy into Captain Marvel Bunny. Captain Marvel Bunny's enemy, Captain Black Bunny. Art by Chad Grothkopf. In Fawcett's Funny Animals #30 (July 1945), an explanation for Hoppy's powers is revealed. In the story \\"Hoppy Meets the Wizard Bunny\\", Hoppy is hit on the head and develops amnesia. The mysterious Wizard Bunny (or Bunny Wizard, both versions are used) is watching, and he flies down to help Hoppy regain his memory. A panel in this story states \\"Because it was he who bestowed the magic word and power upon Hoppy, the Bunny Wizard flies down to Earth to help Hoppy\\". Eventually, the Wizard gets Hoppy to say \\"Shazam!\\" and his memory is restored, along with his abilities. This is the Bunny Wizard's only known appearance. The word \\"Shazam!\\" has a slightly different meaning for Hoppy. According to the E. Nelson Bridwell-scripted story, Captain Carrot and His Amazing Zoo Crew! in The Oz-Wonderland War #2, Captain Marvel Bunny has the wisdom of Salamander, the strength of Hogules, the stamina of Antlers, the power of Zebreus, the courage of Abalone, and the speed of Monkury. Hoppy's stories occasionally feature his girlfriend Millie, who (like Lois Lane) despises the meek Hoppy, but adores the heroic Captain Marvel Bunny. Millie has no idea that Hoppy can become Captain Marvel Bunny. A noteworthy foe appeared in Fawcett's Funny Animals #32 (Oct‚ÄìNov 1945). In the lead story of that issue, Hoppy faces Captain Black Bunny, who is based on Captain Marvel's foe Black Adam. Captain Black Bunny wears a black costume similar to Black Adam's, though the evil bunny wears a cape like Hoppy and instead of a lightning bolt he has a yellow flame on his chest. Captain Black Bunny comes from deep within the Earth's core and is aided by a gang of imps. In Hoppy's first appearance in DC Comics (in DC Comics Presents #34), Hoppy and Millie find themselves magically transported to Earth-S, the home of the Marvel Family in the Pre-Crisis DC Universe. He aids the Marvel Family and Superman against Mr. Mind, Mr. Mxyzptlk, and King Kull. In this story, both Hoppy and Millie were depicted as white bunnies, instead of their usual pink. Hoppy next appears in Captain Carrot and His Amazing Zoo Crew! in The Oz- Wonderland War #2 (1986), where he fights alongside the Zoo Crew. His silhouette is briefly seen in Limbo, where forgotten characters from DC continuity currently reside, pursued by Ace the Bat-Hound, during the events of Final Crisis in 2009. Following DC's 2011 New 52 reboot, Hoppy was reimagined as the pet of Mary Bromfield in the rebooted Shazam! franchise. In Shazam! #1 (February 2019), Hoppy is accidentally struck by magic lightning when Mary and her foster sister Darla Dudley say \\"Shazam!\\" and assume their superhero forms. As a result, Hoppy acquires superpowers (flight and lightning-emitting eyes, among others) and his fur pattern reflects the lightning-bolt emblem of the Shazam Family. Powers and abilities Hoppy has powers roughly similar to those of Captain Marvel/Shazam. He accesses his powers by yelling \\"Shazam!\\", but his pantheon differs. His patron deities are Salamander, Hogules, Antlers, Zebreus, Abalone and Monkury. Reception In American Comic Book Chronicles: 1940-1944, Kurt Mitchell and Roy Thomas write, \\"It was cover star Hoppy the Marvel Bunny who made FFA special. Creator Chad Grothkopf struck a balance in his stories between the usual funny animal tropes, fairy tale-style fantasy, and full-tilt super-heroics, the strip's only sticking point the tiresome gimmick of Hoppy never being able to remember his magic word. Whether battling piscine pirate Captain Kid Perch, the Witch, King Artist of Picture Land, or Simon Spider and his living dolls, Marvel Bunny always delivered big laughs and plenty of action.\\" See also *Captain Carrot *Thunderbunny References  External links  *Hoppy the Marvel Bunny at Don Markstein's Toonopedia.

It provides developers with a common layer to create their own Gnutella or Gnutella2 client or network. As a separate component, GnucDNA can be updated independently of the client, passing down improvements to the applications already using it.  General  GnucDNA is a widespread and established library which can be extended by programmers. It includes the capability of forming a decentralized network between peers with integrated Ultrapeer support, allowing the network to avoid bottlenecks of low bandwidth nodes. However, the Ultrapeer - respectively Hub on G2 - support is outdated compared to modern implementations by clients like gtk-gnutella and Shareaza. The library gives programs which link to it the ability to share files with built- in support for uploading, downloading, file queuing and partial file sharing (the ability to upload verified chunks of a file while it is downloading), hash those files, extract meta-data to be shared through the network, and the ability to perform advanced searching by specific hash and meta-data parameters. GnucDNA also offers applications the ability to update their software easily through the same P2P network that they create. The GnucDNA component is COM based to inherit the advantage of language independence and versatility. Applications in C++, Visual Basic, .Net, and even scripts can utilize GnucDNA. Also by being a separate component, it can be used in a number of alternate situations such as part of a plugin, a service or running behind a web server.  History  Over five years of development have already gone into coding, improving, and testing the GnucDNA as part of the Gnucleus project. As others took notice of the project the engine was duplicated over 15 times, but while the interfaces and services others provided were great, they could not keep up with the main development. So the decision was taken, to move the Gnucleus engine, now called GnucDNA, into a separate component, so that anyone has access to it without fear of falling behind in the developments and improvements that are made. It also opens up new doors for those interested in creating their own P2P networks, but do not want to re- invent the low layer communication and file transfer mechanisms.  Clients  = Gnucleus = Gnucleus is the gnutella and Gnutella2 client project for Microsoft Windows that the GnucDNA library code originally has been developed in, before it was split to a semi-separated project. Just like the GnucDNA library, it has been released under the GNU General Public License. The client is designed to be easy to use without reducing the number of options available. Gnucleus implements a number of features including Ultrapeer capability on gnutella (resp. Hub mode on G2), multisource swarming downloads, partial-file sharing, SHA1 file hashing, Tiger tree sub chunk verification and proxy server support. = Kiwi Alpha = Kiwi Alphahttps://web.archive.org/web/20120504002001/http://www.kiwialpha.com/ is a peer-to-peer file sharing application that uses the GnucDNA library to connect to the gnutella and G2 networks. Its design goal focusses on leaving a small resource footprint and being simple to use for beginners. Kiwi Alpha doesn't contain functionality such as media players, in the spirit of its lightweight goal. However, the application comes with two bundled pieces of adware, such as SaveNow, which seems to contradict the small footprint goal.Web Safety Ratings from McAfee SiteAdvisor for the kiwialpha.com Also, the program's website states that \\"Kiwi Alpha does not require users to register and protects the user's privacy by connecting anonymously to the network\\".

It has been a feature on many children's programmes for many years around the world and has made appearances in game shows as well as other programming. While gunge mostly appears on television, it can also be used as a fundraising tool for charities, youth and religious groups. Gunge tanks have appeared at nightclubs and Fun Days. The British charities Comic Relief and Children in Need, supported by the BBC, have used gunge for fundraising in the past. In the U.S., slime is sometimes associated with Nickelodeon, even having several game shows revolving around it, such as Slime Time Live.  Composition  The gunge that is widely used on television is an industrial powder thickener hydroxyethyl cellulose, mainly used in production of the sauce for apple pies.Natrosol Hydroxyethylcellulose (HEC) is a non-ionic water-soluble cellulose ether, formed by reaction of cellulose with ethylene oxide. Alternatively, other items can be used for \\"gunge\\", for example eggs, sauces, as well as other messy items. In many cases, the gunging occurs in a gunge tank, a transparent booth with a means for storing and releasing the gunge. Due to source ingredients uses as food thickeners in soups and stews, gunge is often safe to eat, provided the colouring is also non-toxic. Other ingredients used in gunge can be Oobleck, a mixture of cornstarch and water, and Xanthan gum, another food additive. The iconic green slime of the Canadian television series You Can't Do That on Television was developed by accident, according to producer Roger Price - the original idea had been to dump a barrel of food leftovers on a young boy chained in a dungeon, but before it could be used, the contents of the barrel had turned green with mold. The noxious mixture was dumped on the young boy anyway, and overnight the series had its trademark gag. The show subsequently went through several different slime recipes incorporating ingredients such as lime gelatin dessert powder, flour, oatmeal or Cream of Wheat, baby shampoo, and even cottage cheese (not all necessarily at the same time). On the show (and subsequently on Nickelodeon since then), the composition of the slime was treated as a closely guarded secret, and some episodes revolved around the cast members trying to discern what the slime was made of. Today gunge or slime features on many television shows around the world; however, since the 2000s the focus has changed from mainstream shows to children's and teenager's television programmes like Nickelodeon's Figure It Out. In fact, thanks largely to the popularity of Nickelodeon shows, slime and gunge have typically been associated with children's programming in North America since the 1980s. In addition to its use on television and as a fundraiser, gunge in tanks sometimes features in nightclubs. Youth groups such as church groups and scouting movements also make use of gunge to \\"gunge the leaders\\" as well as the children.  History of gunge on television  = The 1960s = In the UK the popular BBC show Not Only... But Also featured a closing sketch called \\"Poet's Corner\\" in which that week's guest would be challenged to an improvisational poetry contest against Peter Cook, with Dudley Moore acting as referee. Each contestant would sit at the corner of a square tank of \\"BBC Gunge\\" on a rigged seat that could be triggered so as to catapult the occupant into the tank. The referee would sit at one of the other corners in a similar chair. Any use of repetition, hesitation or deviation from the challenge theme would precipitate the offender into the tank. The sketch always ended with all three personalities in the tank, chest deep in slime and reciting poetry.Bob McCabe - The Authorised Biography of Ronnie Barker 2004 \\"Barker - sat suspended over a tank of gunge, and attempted to speak in rhyming couplets.\\"Roger Wilmut - From fringe to flying circus 1980 \\"Cook: 'We were poised on these chairs, and the first person not to rhyme fell into this terrible pool of gunge..\\" =1970‚Äì1979= The UK Saturday morning children's show Tiswas used the concept of gunge in abundance. Having already established messy slapstick humour through custard pies and buckets of water being thrown over presenters and guests, Tiswas had taken to locking up adult volunteers into a cage. Once inside the cage, the inhabitants would normally be soaked with buckets of water at random points in the show. Where gunge became involved, was thanks to the tin bath perched on top the Cage. Through a handle, this tub could be tilted, dropping its messy contents onto the people below, While famous for its custard pie humour, it would not be unusual for Tiswas to have buckets of food and imitation mud/horse manure poured over people. Custard and baked beans were popular choices.Quentin Falk, Ben Falk Television's Strangest Moments p116 - 2005 \\"In fact, gunge and water being thrown on people became the thrust of the show. And the Phantom was the king, kersplatting everyone from ...\\"Dominic Strinati, Stephen Wagg -Come on Down?: Popular Media Culture in Post-War Britain p167 1992 \\"..the 1970s ATV developed Tiswas, a children's magazine programme based on pop, irony and self-conscious mayhem. ... ran competitions wherein the losers (or even the winners) were variously slid into tanks of brightly coloured gunge\\" =1980‚Äì1989= In North America, You Can't Do That on Television, a Canadian children's show popular on Nickelodeon developed by a British TV producer, Roger Price, routinely subjected its characters to \\"slime\\" (usually green, but sometimes in other colours), usually when they said, \\"I don't know.\\" It became a staple of the show where other actors would try to encourage their peers to say a phrase to get them slimed. A sliming scene from a 1982 episode of You Can't Do That on Television was also used in the opening of the 1987 film Fatal Attraction, and references to the series have been used in mainstream U.S. television series ranging from NewsRadio to Family Guy. This aspect of the cult show later became iconized in Nickelodeon's slime logo, subsequent game shows such as Double Dare, What Would You Do?, Figure It Out, and BrainSurge revolving around slime, pies in the face, and other forms of mess, and live events in which participants (including celebrities, particularly at the annual Kids' Choice Awards) would be offered the chance to get slimed or publicly humiliated. In the late 1980s, Nickelodeon and its Canadian counterpart, YTV, even held write-in contests in which the grand prize was a trip to the YCDTOTV set in Ottawa, Ontario, to be slimed. The popularity of Nickelodeon's slime shows spawned imitators such as the short-lived 1988 syndicated game show Slime Time (no relation to Nickelodeon's later Slime Time Live), in which schoolteachers were the victims of green gungings. The most famous instances of the said gunging tradition opens in 1987 with the first Kids Choice Awards. In Britain and Europe, in the early 1980s, children's gunge-based game shows were the norm. Particularly shows like How Dare You! on ITV and Crackerjack on the BBC ensured that the gunging element featured on shows for the decade to come. On How Dare You!, one of the main games was 'Teach Them a Lesson', where children got the opportunity to drench their teacher or representative from their school in gunge while sitting above a knee deep filled gunge tank. After this game the teachers were sometimes knocked off their perch by one of show's presenters and into the gunge tank. On Crackerjack, the two weekly celebrities, one male and one female, would compete against host Stu Francis in a gunge based gamed called \\"Take A Chance\\" to try to win points for their child contestant. Failure to answer questions correctly would lead to Francis and/or the celebrity guest being covered in gunge. Additionally, the male celebrity and Francis, even if they got a question correct would usually get gunged regardless as punishment for laughing at their opponent, although female contestants who answered correctly were generally allowed to laugh at Francis and get away with it. Later in the 1980s, the BBC launched Double Dare, based on the US style format, but much sloppier than its U.S. counterpart. Also, gunge started to appear on mainstream shows such as Game for a Laugh on ITV and Noel Edmond's Saturday Roadshow on the BBC. Other countries in Europe also started to have gunge elements on mainstream shows. Un Dos Tres on TVE in Spain often had contestants throwing buckets of gunge at each other. Also, Donnerlippchen, a television show in Germany, had many messy games; the climax of the show was dunking the team's suited boss in a dunk tank and pouring custard down inside every team members pair of boxer shorts. New Zealand children's show What Now has used gunge over the years since its launch in 1981. As of 2015 the show is still broadcasting on channel 2 each Sunday morning from 8am. Various segments of the show using gunge include, tank of terror, gunge on the run, flushed away, frog in the bog and brain freeze. =1990‚Äì1999= In Noel's House Party, the public often voted to determine which celebrities on the television show would be gunged in the Gunge Tank. In later years, the Gunge Tank became the Gunge Train, and celebrities were forced to take a ride on the train and were covered in gunge throughout their journey. Celebrities usually returned with their suits or dresses ruined and faces unrecognizable. Sometimes audience members were gunged on the show for reasons of revenge by family members or friends. The entertainment factor attached to the process of gunging was realised by the producers of the charity event Comic Relief, who held an event, in cooperation with the Guinness World Records at the National Exhibition Centre, Birmingham where an attempt to set a record for the Most People Gunged Simultaneously took place on 12 March 1999. 184 gallons of gunge was splattered over 731 people. All across Europe television producers were ordering more gunge segments to be fitted into mainstream television shows due to its popularity with viewers. In Germany, on Sat.1, Halli galli, Gl√ºcksritter (RTL), Gl√ºcksspirale, plus the German version of NHP - Gottschalk's Haus-Party, all involved a high dose of gunge. Halli Galli had audience members plucked out of their seats and sent down a messy gunge slide and into a pool. Likewise, Gl√ºcksspirale on SAT1, Gl√ºcksritter RTL and Rache ist S√º√ü Sat1, had contestants plucked out of the audience and gunged in the most spectacular ways. Towards the end of the 1990s, with the demise of Noel's House Party and the dwindling audience figures for other European shows, the gunge segment in many mainstream shows started to fade. Throughout the 1990s, gunge became a focal feature in many children's television shows. Teenagers and celebrity guests are often seen competing in quizzes on Live & Kicking, and are gunged if they lose. Celebrities Lee Ryan, Ben Adams, Katy Hill, Lesley Waters, Katherine Merry, Heather Suttie and Victoria Hawkins were gunged on this show. Many other shows used gunge throughout - Fun House, Get Your Own Back, Run the Risk and Double Dare. From 1997 to 2003, a Canadian show called Uh Oh! (game show), that ran on YTV, featured a punishment system that had the participant go inside a closet sized room and have green gunged dropped on them if their partner wasn't able to answer the question correctly. =2000‚Äì2009= In mainstream television programmes during the naughts, gunge was used in shows such as The Paul O'Grady Show, I'm a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!, and Insides Out. =2010-present= Gunge continues to feature in 2010 on children's TV in the UK and continuing the trend of the latter half of the 2000s, not as much as it once did. 101 Ways to Leave a Gameshow has used it in its Bonus Round. The host picks a random name and the first person to get the question he asks wrong gets lowered down a pipe and gets gunged. Basilchildren's Swap Shop returned minus the gunge gallery but introducing a new game with a western theme called Gold Rush. In this game, the two winning teams from the previous game (dunk beds) take part in the game set in a mine shaft where the aim is to fill up tubes with liquid sludge by tipping buckets with the slop into the tubes which are hidden (so the children do not know who is winning). At the end the four kids take cover in the now shuddering mine shaft. The winning team then receives gold (yellow gunge) while the losing team were initially covered in brown sludge however later episodes they remain dry. In New Zealand kids television, What Now introduced a new gungey game the big breakfast and Splat Cave. Fe Fi Fo Yum has a challenge which sees two children go barefoot into a bowl of gunge to collect objects for their teammates such as letters/numbers or other items. The final game also makes use of the gunge bowl, where the last part involves wading in the pool and up a ramp in order to release their captive teammates. In 2014, a few new games such as Use Ya Head, Target Ya Teacher and Small Balls were added to What Now. In addition, the spin-off from Horrible Histories, Horrible Histories: Gory Games involved a physical challenge involving gunge. The three children in the quiz running barefoot across an inflatable collecting \\"poo\\" and depositing it in their tanks at the other end. Above the inflatable are three containers - one for each lane of the inflatable, storing gunge which is released at points in the game. A variation of this challenge sees the three contestants again running barefoot along an inflatable lane, in an all play game, throw pies into mouths attached to a bungee cord, in the second series, this has the added difficulty of \\"Garum sauce\\" falling onto the inflatable at a random point in the game causing the children to slip and slide thus increasing the difficulty of the challenge. As of series 3 the losing kids would go down a slide barefoot into a vat of brown gunge and have to crawl through it.. The British and Australian versions of Nickelodeon's Camp Orange also features challenges which involve getting gunged. Splatalot (in Dutch Spetterslot), a medieval themed game show, similar to Total Wipeout features gunge/slime is fired at the attackers by the defenders at random points in the challenges as a means to slow down the attackers. Sam and Mark Big Friday Wind Up has started featuring gunge since 2014. The game was called rotation and two family teams were asked general knowledge questions while a gunge tank is being poured into, if they get the question right they spin and it is the other family's turn to answer a question. The team that is under the gunge when it is full gets gunged. In 2016, rotation was replaced by another gungey game called Splat in the box. Two family teams were asked general knowledge questions. However many seconds they took to answer the question is however many turns they do on the handle on the box. for example if they took 3 seconds to answer they will have to turn the crank 3 times. if they get a question wrong or run out of time they will have to do the maximum of turns which is 10. A gunge monster was hiding in the box and a certain number of turns will open the box and whichever team is standing in front of the box gets gunged. 7two had a new gameshow with gunge in called Flushed. The losers of the previous round went into a gunge tank and got gunged with purple gunge or \\"Sludge\\" as they call it in the show. There were 2 rounds so each episode contained 2 gungings unless there was a tie in one of the rounds so that it was just one gunging. In terms of prime time television, in the UK at least, gunge has made appearances in the ITV1 game show The Whole 19 Yards where two transparent spheres contained either pink or yellow gunge. In one of the many physical challenges, a contestant had to unscrew the bottom of the sphere of their colour resulting in the gunge falling onto them and the floor below in order to retrieve a key in the sphere which allowed them to complete the challenge. The Channel 5 version of Big Brother (both celebrity and normal version) features gunge in various tasks and as a way to nominate housemates. At the 2014 Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Sports Awards, the Legend Award was given to soccer player David Beckham, who was slimed with gold slime rather than the traditional green. Baseball player Derek Jeter, who received the award the following year, was also slimed with a gold color. This tradition has continued with Kobe Bryant in 2016, Michael Phelps in 2017, and Danica Patrick in 2018. This sliming is notable not only for its unique gold look, but for the overwhelming fashion in which the individuals are covered with slime.

The A 2 starts at the junction with the A3 near the western city of Oberhausen, passes through the north of the Ruhr valley, through the M√ºnsterland and into Ostwestfalen, crossing the former inner German border and continuing through the Magdeburger B√∂rde to merge into the Berliner Ring shortly before reaching Berlin. Major cities such as Magdeburg, Braunschweig, Hannover and Dortmund are situated very close to the A 2\\\\. The A 2 is one of the most important autobahns, connecting several large industrial areas with each other. The A 2 was modified in the late 1990s, and completely rebuilt in the former East Germany. All of the A 2 has 3 travel lanes and a breakdown lane in each direction. History Border crossing at Helmstedt in 1967 The highway was planned between September 1933 and December 1934 by the construction departments of the company Reichsautobahn in Dusseldorf, Hanover and Merseburg. As a connection of the Rhine-Ruhr region, the highway was deliberately planned in the northern area of the Ruhr area, since the mining migrated to the north and at the same time wanted to avoid the mountain subsidence areas. In the area Ostwestfalen one followed the settlement priorities. In the area of Hanover, it was natural to pass the motorway via a short route south of the city. As Hanover was at that time one of the hubs of German air traffic and the airport was in the north of the city, it was decided, however, for a northern bypass of the city. In addition, there was a freight yard in the north, an industrial area was planned and the soil conditions were better. Between Berlin and Hanover there were three possible variants, which were examined. The northern one was supposed to lead over Stendal and to the north to the Berliner Ring. It was the shortest route for the proposed extension in the direction of Szczecin and K√∂nigsberg dar. However, the disadvantage was that the crossed area was sparsely populated and already the railroad was the main carrier. The middle variant touched Genthin and Brandenburg on the Havel and aimed at the center of Berlin. Again, the area was sparsely populated and already developed by the railway. Another difficulty was that there were numerous lakes and bogs, which would have made construction difficult. The southern variant, which was finally built, led through the most densely populated area and opened the possibility of an extension to Wroclaw or Frankfurt (Oder) and Warsaw. It was planned to build two 3.75 m wide lanes per direction of travel with a 4.2 m wide median strip along the entire route. With the Betonleitstreifen and the banquets, the construction had a width of 24 m. It was laid out, with the exception of the section in the Teutoburg Forest, for speeds of at least 160 km / h. The construction was carried out in parallel with the total of 12 locations. First, on April 5, 1936, the 32 km section between Braunschweig-West and Lehrte was opened to traffic. Three further sections between Hannover-Ost to Lehrte (10 km), Braunschweig-West to Helmstedt (43 km) and Werder / Gro√ü Kreutz (located at the subsequent part of today's A 10) to Burg / Schermen (85 km) followed on 17 August 1936. On January 10, 1937, the Berlin Ring was connected to Hannover with the release of the 55 km long section between Burg / Schermen and Helmstedt. In 1937, the first section between Dusseldorf and Recklinghausen was opened in the western area on 17 December. The Kamener cross northeast of Dortmund, where the A 1 crosses the A 2, was on 12 November 1938, together with the section between Recklinghausen and G√ºtersloh the traffic passed, but still without the subsequent parts of today's A 1, the only after 1945 were put into operation. It was after the Schkeuditzer cross (A 9-A 14) a second intersection in cloverleaf execution in Germany. The also scheduled for this day traffic transfer of the section between G√ºtersloh and Bielefeld could not be performed due to a landslide in the Teutoburg Forest. Only after the damage had been eliminated on 15 December, you could drive this route. On the same day, the section was inaugurated until Bad Salzuflen and Herford. The day before, the section between Bad Nenndorf and Hannover had already been opened. Thus, only the section between Bad Salzuflen and Bad Nenndorf was missing. This was released on 23 September 1939 restricted. Due to the started World War II you could finish this section only once. Thus, this was provisionally intended only for the so-called service traffic. Under the operation of Polish forced laborers and prisoners of war, this section was built and opened until November 14, 1940, except for a three-kilometer stretch of the Weser crossing at Bad Oeynhausen, which was built after the war. Altogether 230 bridges were built in the course of the highway. In the GDR, the highway was one of the transit routes, from 1971 in the context of the transit agreement. On a travel and traffic map of the GDR of 1979, the section of the highway between the border crossing Marienborn and the former branch Magdeburg (now motorway junction Werder) is only marked with a T for transit route, on a later map (Reiseland DDR 1988) with the until today applicable addition E 30 for European road. It played an important role as a transit corridor to West Berlin, with allied checkpoints at Helmstedt and Dreilinden- Drewitz (on the A 10) respectively. In the beginning of the 1970s prepared numbering scheme of the federal highways carried the current A 2 in the former West Germany largely their current number, but ran west of the cross Oberhausen on the way of today's A 3 on to the motorway junction Heumar, the Berliner Ring coming Kilometrierung was even continued in a westerly direction to Aachen. From the introduction of today's numbering system in 1975, the A 2 already began at the Dutch border Straelen / Venlo and led from the intersection Kaiserberg together as A 2 and A 3 to the cross Oberhausen, where the A 3 in the direction of Arnhem again separated from the route. In the course of the numbering of the junctions, which began in 1992, double denominations of motorway junctions, motorway junctions and dual denominations such as the route between Duisburg and Oberhausen were classified as A 2 / A 3. The piece between Venlo and Duisburg is today part of the A 40. Between the towns of Helmstedt and Marienborn one can still see the former border control points, which were turned into a museum in the 1990s. A2 near Magdeburg Today The Dortmund-Lanstrop junction has only been built to give access to the nearby landfill. Garbage trucks approach it via the autobahn, then exit via secondary roads. The landfill is easily recognizable by the Lanstroper Ei, an old water tower standing on a hill approximately away from the autobahn. Due to its importance as a major thoroughfare for commercial transit and as a trade route connecting the western parts of Germany to neighbouring Central European countries such as Poland, it is often nicknamed Warsaw Avenue or simply Poland Highway. Christian Dzida, keyboardist for the Austrian band Sch√ºrzenj√§ger from 1995 to 1999, was killed in a road accident on Bundesautobahn 2 in November 2009.\\"Christian Dzida starb bei einem Unfall mit seinem Ferrari: Das Drama um den Tod des Sch√ºrzenj√§gers\\", Bild, November 9, 2009 Future The A 2 is completely six-lane between the Ruhr area and Berlin. The last gap of several years of expansion was closed in mid-December 2011. During the long expansion phase, it came again and again to miles of traffic jams. Despite extensive security measures, there were always numerous serious rear-end collisions involving trucks. At the end of October 2013, after 18 months of construction, the tank and service facility \\"Lipperland Nord\\" north of the junction Ostwestfalen / Lippe opened. The rest stop Lipperland S√ºd was already completed. Lower Saxony and North Rhine-Westphalia want to expand the busy A 2 from Bielefeld to the border to Saxony-Anhalt eight lanes. In order to meet the expected increase in traffic, especially of trucks on the important east-west connection, both countries had notified the expansion for the Federal Transport Infrastructure Plan 2030. However, the final version of the corresponding demand plan, which came into force at the end of 2016 with the amendment of the Highway Act, now only includes the extension of the motorway triangle Bottrop and Hannover-West, the motorway junction Hannover-Buchholz and the eight-lane extension from Herrenhausen to AD Hannover-West as urgent needs with bottleneck elimination. Further needs are the eight-lane expansion of the sections Bad Nenndorf to Herrenhausen and Hannover-West to Hannover-East classified. On the approximately 3.5-kilometer section between the interchange Hannover-Ost and Lehrte the side strips were equipped with emergency stop bays, structurally adapted and sold with block marking and released since January 28 in the direction of Berlin and February 1 in the opposite direction as Verflechtungsstreifen. Traffic is routed there via LED panels and supplemented variable message signs.

In late December 1935, Otto Binder began working for Otis Adelbert Kline as a literary agent in charge of Kline's New York City office most prominently marketing the stories of Robert E. Howard, although insufficient business during this Great Depression era forced Kline to close his company after a year and a half. At the time of Otto's move to New York City, Earl Binder dissolved the writing partnership, and all new material produced under the name of Eando Binder from January 1936 on, was solely the work of Otto Binder.

He is best known for creating the Fawcett Comics character, Captain Marvel, in 1939, along with artist C. C. Beck. Life and career Parker was born in East Orange, New Jersey. He graduated in 1929 from The Lawrenceville School in New Jersey, and then attended Princeton University, where he was a member of the Cannon Club, Press Club and ROTC. After graduating from Princeton in 1933 with a degree in English Literature, Parker worked for three years for the New York Herald Tribune as a sports editor and in the education department, followed by a year as sports editor of the Literary Digest. In September 1937 Parker joined Fawcett Publications, initially as an editor on its crime and detective magazines and then as an editor on its movie magazine line. He stayed in this role until August 1939, when he was asked to become the senior editor of a new comic book line that Fawcett intended to bring to market. After agreeing to take on the comic book project, Parker was assigned the task of creating the characters and stories for Fawcett's first comic magazine, Whiz Comics. For the lead character, Parker developed a superhero that he initially named \\"Captain Thunder,\\" later changed to \\"Captain Marvel\\" at the suggestion of Fawcett General Manager Ralph Daigh. Parker originally conceived Captain Marvel as a leader of a group of men, each of whom possessed one outstanding characteristic, and who would be called upon by the leader as the needs of each mission demanded. This concept was inspired by stories of the Knights of the Round Table that Parker had read as a boy in James Baldwin's 1910 book \\"Stories of the King.\\" Fawcett's Daigh, however, was against the idea of a group, so Parker decided to combine all of the outstanding characteristics of the group into a single character. He drew these characteristics from six mythological heroes - Solomon, Hercules, Achilles, Zeus, Atlas and Mercury - and used the first letter of each as an acrostic for the word \\"Shazam.\\" After Parker had fully developed Captain Marvel's character and backstory, artist Clarence \\"C.C.\\" Beck was brought in to flesh out the character's look, to which Parker contributed the ideas for the Hessian cape and the lightning bolt logo. Captain Marvel's first appearance was in Whiz Comics #2, which went on sale in December 1939. In addition to co-creating Captain Marvel, Parker also co-created the other Fawcett characters that debuted in Whiz Comics #2, including Ibis the Invincible (with C.C. Beck), Golden Arrow (with Pete Costanza), Spy Smasher (with C.C. Beck), Scoop Smith (with Greg Duncan), Lance O'Casey (with Bob Kingett) and Dan Dare (with Greg Duncan). At the time he created Captain Marvel, Parker was a member of the cavalry in the New York National Guard, and in October 1940 left Fawcett to join the U.S. Army in active service. He served in the Pacific theater during World War II, rising to the rank of Major. Following World War II, he rejoined Fawcett Publications in December 1945, but had no further involvement in comics. From 1945 to 1948 he was the feature editor of Today's Woman, before becoming the senior editor of Mechanix Illustrated, a position he held until his death in 1963. Parker was survived by his wife, the former Elizabeth Hennig, and two step-daughters. Parker's only child, William Lee Parker Jr., died in infancy in 1949. Bibliography * Hamerlinck, P.

He was best known for his work on Captain Marvel and the Marvel Family during both the Golden Age and Bronze Age of comics, as well as his work on the title Superman's Girl Friend, Lois Lane during the 1950s and 1960s. Biography =Early career= Schaffenberger was born on a farm in the Thuringian Forest, Germany, where, as a boy, he \\". . . tended geese, herded goats, and hoed potatoes.\\"\\"Jimmy Olsen's Pen-Pals,\\" Superman's Pal, Jimmy Olsen #155 (January 1973). Emigrating to America as a 7-year-old, first to Hartford, Connecticut, and then to New York City, he eventually won a scholarship to the Pratt Institute. After graduation, he joined Jack Binder's studio in 1941, where he worked on key Fawcett titles including Captain Marvel, Bulletman, and Ibis the Invincible. While working for Binder's studio, which was located in Englewood, New Jersey, Schaffenberger took over an apartment from the local high school football coach, Vince Lombardi, who had yet to achieve success in the National Football League. During this time, Schaffenberger's work was also published by Prize, Street & Smith, and Pines. Schaffenberger served in the U.S. military during World War II, including a stint with the Office of Strategic Services, leaving the military with the rank of Master Sergeant. Schaffenberger returned to the world of professional sequential art soon after war's end. He resumed his work for the Captain Marvel family of titles, and expanded his reach to an even more diverse group of publishing houses, including EC Comics, Gilberton, Premier Magazines, American Comics Group, and Marvel Comics. At Gilberton, Schaffenberger provided the interior art for Classics Illustrated No. 119, Soldiers of Fortune (May 1954).Jones Jr., William B., Classics Illustrated: A Cultural History, with Illustrations (Jefferson, NC, and London: McFarland & Company, 2002), p. 101. =DC Comics= An example of Schaffenberger's art: young Ma and Pa Kent, from The New Adventures of Superboy #1 (Jan. 1980). In 1957 Otto Binder recruited Schaffenberger to DC to work on the Superman family. He stayed at DC for the next 30 years, making an especially large contribution to the development of Lois Lane. In this capacity, he was the lead artist on the Superman's Girl Friend, Lois Lane series for the entirety of its first decade. Indeed, Schaffenberger's rendition of Lane became cited by many as the \\"definitive\\" version of the character, and Schaffenberger was often asked by DC editor Mort Weisinger to redraw other artists' depictions of Lois Lane in other DC titles where she appeared. Catwoman made her first appearance in the Silver Age of Comic Books in Superman's Girl Friend, Lois Lane #70 (Nov. 1966) in a story drawn by Schaffenberger. In issue #80 (Jan. 1968), Schaffenberger updated the character's fashions to a then-more contemporary look. He was essentially fired from DC in 1970 for helping to organize other artists to protest bad working conditions. He then briefly freelanced and worked for Marvel, but returned to DC in 1972. When, in the 1970s, DC acquired the rights to the Marvel Family, Schaffenberger was one of the key players in the revival of those characters. The late 1970s saw him contribute outside the Superman family of titles, including work on titles such as Wonder Woman and Super Friends. In 1980, Schaffenberger was again leading a Superman family title, The New Adventures of Superboy,Manning, Matthew K. \\"1980s\\" in Dolan, p. 186: \\"After recently departing the pages of Superboy and the Legion of Super-Heroes, Superboy was free to pursue his own adventures...in this premiere issue written by Cary Bates and illustrated by Kurt Schaffenberger.\\" the final, post-Legion title for the original Superboy. Somewhat metaphorically, the Superboy- and Supergirl-less DC universe that followed the events of Crisis on Infinite Earths turned out to be a mostly Schaffenberger-less one as well. He largely retired from comics soon after helping with the final pre-Crisis Superman tale \\"Whatever Happened to the Man of Tomorrow?\\" Schaffenberger was a special guest at the 1996 San Diego Comic Con. =Personal life= Schaffenberger and his wife, the former Dorothy Bates Watson,Voger, Voglesong, p. 15 who married in Englewood, New Jersey, on March 30, 1946,Voger, Voglesong, p. 20 had two children, Susan and her three-years- younger brother, Karl.Voger, Voglesong, p. 56 The family lived for four decades in the same house in River Edge, New Jersey, before moving in 1989.Voger, Voglesong, p. 101 Awards Schaffenberger's work won him the 1984 National Cartoonists Society Award in the \\"Comic Book\\" division.

He is best known for his work on Captain Marvel and the Marvel Family during the Golden Age of comic books for Fawcett Comics. He was the co- creator of Mary Marvel, along with writer Otto Binder. The first Mary Marvel character sketches came from Swayze's drawing table, and he illustrated her earliest adventures, including the classic origin story, \\"Captain Marvel Introduces Mary Marvel\\" (Captain Marvel Adventures #18, Dec. 1942). Biography Swayze was born to Louis Herbert and Mildred (n√©e Turner) Swayze. He graduated from Neville High School in his native Monroe, Louisiana. He attended the Northeast Center of LSU (now University of Louisiana at Monroe) before receiving his degree from Louisiana Tech University in Ruston. He subsequently procured a Master of Fine Arts degree from Northeast Louisiana University (now ULM) where he also taught art. Swayze was hired primarily by Fawcett to illustrate Captain Marvel stories and covers for Whiz Comics and Captain Marvel Adventures. He wrote many Captain Marvel scripts and continued to do so while he served in the United States Army, which he entered at Fort Oglethorpe in north Georgia during World War II. He played guitar and performed twice with Bing Crosby entertaining troops. After leaving the military in 1944, he made an arrangement with Fawcett to produce art and stories on a freelance basis from his home in Monroe, where he created both art and storylines for The Phantom Eagle (Wow Comics), as well as drawing the \\"Flyin' Jenny\\" newspaper strip for Bell Syndicate (created by Russell Keaton). After Wow Comics ceased publication, Swayze produced artwork for Fawcett's top-selling line of romance comics, including Sweethearts and Life Story. After the company ceased publishing comics, Swayze switched to Charlton Publications, from which he ended his comics career in the middle 1950s. He was then hired by Olin Matheson to establish the art department for the company's packaging division. In an interview in 2000 with the Monroe News Star, Swayze describe his philosophy of developing comics as the utilization of \\"art in storytelling so that even a child who couldn't yet read could get a story out of it.\\" An oil painter and former semi-professional league baseball player, Swayze wrote a column containing his memoirs, carried in Alter Ego magazine, from 1996 until his death, under the title, We Didn't Know It Was the Golden Age! Family and death Swayze and his wife, the former June Bloomer, reared five children in Monroe. He was elected to the Ouachita Parish School Board, and was vice commander of the American Legion. He died October 14, 2012 in Monroe at age 99. In addition to his wife of 66 years, he was survived by his three daughters, a son, and four grandchildren. The fifth child is not mentioned by name in the obituary, presumably having predeceased his or her parents. Services were held on October 17, 2012, at the First United Methodist Church of Monroe.

This is a stand-alone novel which connects the Vows & Honor series to the Valdemar Saga; it introduces the character Kerowyn and fills in what had been some gaps in the series.  Plot synopsis  The teenage daughter of a minor nobleman, Kerowyn has been in charge of managing her father's household since her mother's death, but hates the life of a noblewoman. She is more than ready to hand the responsibilities of the household over to her younger brother's new wife; however, the keep is attacked during the wedding feast and the bride, Dierna, is kidnapped. With her father dead and her brother badly wounded, Kerowyn goes to her grandmother, the sorceress Kethryveris, for help. Kethry presents Kerowyn with her magical sword Need, and Kerowyn rides after the bandits herself, successfully rescuing Dierna in an event later immortalized in a song called \\"Kerowyn's Ride.\\" Following the rescue, Kerowyn finds that she is both a hero and an embarrassment to her brother. She soon leaves to live with Kethry and her partner Tarma, becoming Tarma's student in the arts of warfare, and learning to control her mind-magic from Tarma's kyree companion Warrl. In the course of her training Kerowyn meets Darenthallis, third son of the king of Rethwellan and another of Tarma's students; after a period of mutual antagonism, the two of them eventually become friends, and then lovers, but when Daren's father dies and his older brother takes the throne, Kerowyn refuses to go with him to Rethwellan. Instead, upon completing her training with Tarma, Kerowyn joins the mercenary company known as the Skybolts. Kerowyn remains with the Skybolts for several years, growing in skill and in standing within the company. During a campaign against Karse, Kerowyn ends up separated from the rest of the company and flees into Karse. There, she encounters a group of Karsites who have captured and are planning to torture the Herald Eldan; securing Eldan's promise to pay her for it, she rescues him from the Karsites. The two quickly fall in love, but when Kerowyn realizes that the Karsites are tracking Need's presence, she sneaks away in the night, drawing the Karsites away and leaving Eldan to make his way back to Valdemar while she returns to the Skybolts. Upon her return, after a confrontation with the Skybolt's selfish captain, Kerowyn is made Captain of the Skybolts. Ten years pass. The Skybolts are a formidable company under Kerowyn, and they win a decisive battle for Rethwellan against Karse. Kerowyn again meets Daren, who takes her to the Rethwellan court. While Kerowyn is at the court, Herald Talia and Herald Dirk arrive, seeking aid from Rethwellan. Prince Ancar of Hardorn is making war against Valdemar, using men controlled by magic as soldiers. Valdemar has no experience with magic, and more importantly, they do not have a large enough army. Kerowyn volunteers the Skybolts as an advance force, while Rethwellan promises a second force with Daren to follow. In Valdemar, Kerowyn is reunited with Eldan, whom she has been unable to forget. But Ancar's forces seem limitless, and Kerowyn was unable to bring her own mages across the Valdemar border. The Skybolts sympathize with Valdemar, however, and the forces prepare for a final stand. As the battle joins, Daren arrives with the Rethwellan army and a number of Ancar's soldiers, now freed from the controlling spell. Ancar's troops are defeated, and both Kerowyn and Daren are Chosen by Companions in the chaos of the battle, making them Heralds. The Skybolts are given a border town in Valdemar to use as a home base, in gratitude for their assistance, and Kerowyn is able to remain in Valdemar, fulfilling her duties as both a Captain and a Herald.

He is best known for his work on Fawcett Comics' Captain Marvel and the Marvel Family during the World War II era fans and historians call the Golden Age of Comic Books, and served as one of Captain Marvel's longest-tenured artists. Costanza began his career at Fawcett during writer- artist C. C. Beck's initial planning and creation of Captain Marvel, later becoming Beck's chief assistant on that character, one of the era's most popular. After Fawcett discontinued their line of comic books, Costanza freelanced for Gilberton's Classics Illustrated, adapting literary classics and historic events into single-issue comic-book narratives, as well as for Charlton Comics, the American Comics Group (ACG), for which he was widely known for his work on \\"Magicman\\" and \\"Forbidden Worlds,\\" and the Standard/Nedor/Better umbrella of comics company. In 1967, Otto Binder, a DC Comics writer and editor, recommended Costanza succeed Curt Swan as artist of the series Superman's Pal, Jimmy Olsen. Over the next three years, until retiring due to a stroke in 1971, Costanza remained primarily on Jimmy Olsen while occasionally contributing to Adventure Comics, Adventures of Superman, and World's Finest Comics. Retired after his stroke, which affected his right hand, Costanza taught himself to oil paint left-handed, and produced over 400 paintings of adventure, romance and Americana, many of which have been exhibited and sold.

He is best known for creating the superhero Marvelman, later known as Miracleman. Biography Born in Bow, London, Mick Anglo was educated at the Central Foundation School and John Cass Art School, both in London. On leaving school he freelanced in fashion and commercial art until 1939, and first drew cartoons for SEAC, the official army newspaper for South East Asia Command in 1942, then for newspapers in Singapore in 1945. After completing his National Service, he became an author for a small publishing company, Martin & Reid, producing westerns, romance books and crime thrillers with titles such as \\"Guns & Gamblers\\", \\"My Gun Speaks For Me\\"/\\"Muscles For Hire\\" (1951), and \\"Broadway Glamour\\", under the pen-name Johnny Dekker.a number of sources mistake Anglo's pen name \\"Johnny Dekker\\" as the character name for one of his fictional detective characters He also drew a small number of short humorous comic strips for the publisher John Matthew during 1946, and for two other companies, Rayburn and A. Solway in 1948. After illustrating the book jacket for one of his own novels, Martin and Reid suggested he developed strips for their comics line, and he worked on their comics imprint between 1948 and 1950; editing the line and writing and drawing western, adventure and science fiction strips and titles. He also produced a number of one-off stories contemporaneously with his Martin and Reid work for Paget Publications, one of the smaller British comics imprints of the day; producing short run, often single issue, titles containing a number of stories. Although contributing mainly short humor strips, Anglo's creations for Paget Publications included an early British superhero, Wonderman, who appeared for 24 issues in his own title from 1948 to 1951. Between 1950 and 1952 Anglo produced a number of strips for publisher Arnold Miller's Arnold Book Company, on stories such as \\"Captain Valiant\\" (in Space Comics) and \\"Ace Malloy of the Special Squadron\\", while concurrently producing Space Commando Comics, featuring \\"Space Commander Kerry,\\" for L. Miller and Son, a major British comics company run by Arnold Miller's father, Leonard MillerArnold was also the and Son in L. Miller and Son as well as running his own comics publication company and still writing novels for Martin and Reid. Early in 1954 Anglo opened his own comics production company, Gower Studios, in Gower Street, London. As \\"an old school editorial packager\\", Anglo's studio created \\"packets\\" for various publishers, usually comprising the entire content of a publication; and Mick Anglo Limited was incorporated on 21 August 1954 for the purpose of Artistic and literary creation. Anglo and his staff of British artists, including Don Lawrence (who was given his first break in drawing comics by Anglo), Bob Monkhouse, Denis Gifford, Ron Embleton and George Stokes,Skinn, Des \\"Marvelman, Mightiest Man in the Universe\\" Warrior No. 1 (March 1982) had a hand in the creation of many British independent comic books and magazines between 1954 and 1963. \\"I employed a pretty large staff of freelancers: scriptwriters and artists. Most of the artists had just come out of the Forces, and were looking for something to do\\".Khoury (2001) pages 9‚Äì10 In 1954 Anglo created the character he is best known for, Marvelman. Since the mid-1940s L. Miller and Son had successfully reprinted American comic book company Fawcett Comics' Captain Marvel, Mary Marvel, and Captain Marvel Jr stories in the UK However, in 1953 Fawcett were party to a protracted lawsuit brought by National Comics (now DC Comics) claiming plagiarism of their Superman character. Fawcett cancelled their Captain Marvel titles, leaving Leonard Miller without reprint material for their best-selling British titles. Miller approached Mick Anglo to create an replacement; \\"One day Leonard Miller phoned and said he wanted to see me urgently. His supply of the American material for the Captain Marvel series had suddenly been cut off. Had I any ideas? ... So I quickly told him I had plenty of ideas, and for my trouble I received a regular supply of work for the next six years.\\" Anglo replaced the Captain Marvel family with almost identical characters, Marvelman, Young Marvelman, and Kid Marvelman. In the six years between the relaunch of Captain Marvel Adventures as Marvelman from issue No. 25 (3 February 1954)The Marvelman entry at Don Markstein's Toonopedia states: \\"As of the January 27, 1954 issues, Marvelman and Young Marvelman replaced Cap and Junior\\", but that was the date of the last issue of the Captain Marvel titles, not the first Marvelman issues. and Anglo leaving L. Miller in 1960, he was responsible for scripting 736 issues of Marvelman, Marvelman Family and Young MarvelmanGeorge Khoury, in his interview with Mick Anglo \\"The Man Behind Marvelman\\", Khoury (2001) pages 9‚Äì10, says \\"over 1,000 issues of Marvelman\\"; however, there were 346 issues each of Marvelman and Young Marvelman and 30 issues of Marvelman Family between 1954 and 1960, plus 14 annuals in the same period before Miller went to reprints after Anglo left the title, making 736 issues in all. the \\"best-loved and best-known British superhero\\" and the longest-running British superhero.\\"It's a Miracle!\\", uncredited, Speakeasy No. 52, 1985, reprinted in No. 92, November 1988 Gaining further mileage from the Marvelman material, in 1954 Anglo wrote one issue of Captain Universe for Arnold Books, a near-identical character to Captain Marvel and Marvelman.Captain Universe uses a magic word, \\"Galap\\", to gain superhuman powers, just as Captain Marvel's \\"Shazam\\" and Marvelman's \\"Kimota\\" As well as the Marvelman family of titles, in the mid-1950s Anglo took over a number of L. Miller's established American reprint titles, continuing the series Jim Bowie, Annie Oakley, and Davy Crockett utilising both the English artists from his studios and a number of Spanish artists. In 1960 Anglo left Miller and the Marvelman and Young Marvelman titles went into reprint soon after for the last three years of their runs. He set up his own Anglo Comics imprint title from Gower Studios, launching Captain Miracle, a title which used Marvelman reprints with changes to the artwork; Battle, Gunhawks Western and TV Features, the last of which contained reprints of material produced by the Studio for L. Miller. None of the titles lasted more than 10 monthly issues between October 1960 and June 1961; after which Anglo Comics folded. Anglo next adapted three stories by Edgar Allan Poe, Oscar Wilde and Wilkie Collins for the British Classics Illustrated imprint of publishers Thorpe and Porter, a company for which he also devised a number of 68-page hardback annuals based on television series The Avengers, Charles Rand, and Danger Man. During 1965‚Äì1966, Anglo produced thirteen issues of Miracle Man for Top Sellers publishers ‚Äì a further revamp of the Captain Miracle stories from 1960, which had in turn been altered Marvelman stories.The Captain Miracle stories had been altered again and sold to the Spanish market as 'Super Hombre', and then in 1966 were adapted back again for the U.K. market as Miracle Man Also in 1966, Anglo was approached by John Spencer & Co, a company that had produced crime and western books since the 1940s, latterly under the sobriquet Badger Books, to launch a series of comics. Four titles appeared in 1966, Fantasy Stories, Macabre Stories, Spectre Stories and Strange Stories, featuring, among other stories, a number of reworked strips by Gower Studios artists Ron Embleton and Bill Merrill, Spaceman (originally produced for Gould/Norman Light Publishing). With low production values, the John Spencer titles were not a success, and all folded within the year after six issues.Further John Spencer titles published in 1967 were not Anglo productions During 1967 Anglo edited City Magazines Ltd's TV series-based weekly comic TV Tornado, and contributed the short-run strips Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea and Green Hornet, before returning to Top Sellers and packaging reprints of DC Comics material, including Superman, Wonder Woman and the Batman newspaper strip, for their Super DC anthology series in 1969/1970. Anglo then worked on the weekly Look & Cook magazine in the late 1960s,no relation to the Look and Cook cookbooks by Tina Davis or Annie Leang for the American market co-wrote a small number of cookery books, and was a joke writer for comedian Tommy Cooper. He has also written a series of nostalgic books looking back at the decades from the 1930s‚Äì1950s, with a companion duo of quiz books, a book about Victorian magazines, \\"Penny Dreadfuls and other Victorian Horrors\\", and one on cannibalism, \\"Man Eats Man: The Story of Cannibalism\\", together with a small number of stories or features for Fleetway/IPC's war comics output between 1979 and 1983, before retiring during the 1980s. Marvelman/Miracleman revivals Anglo had little to do with the revival of the Marvelman character in 1982 by Alan Moore for Quality Communications. Dez Skinn, the editor of Warrior, in which the revived series appeared, said \\"He wasn't crazy about our revamp, but he really didn't care either way.\\" Eventually the Marvelman revival was terminated after legal threats from Marvel Comics over Quality Communications Marvelman Special (June 1984), which was composed of Marvelman reprints from the L. Miller days, and Eclipse Comics publishing of the stories, renamed Miracleman, for the American market. The character became \\"mired in a legal quagmire\\" for 25 years, preventing further reprint or new character development opportunities. The situation was not helped by ownership doubts, not clarified by Anglo's contractual relationship to L. Miller and Son and their status as a company.L. Miller and Sons Ltd, as the company was named in 1963, were assumed to have gone bankrupt in 1966 when they ceased publishing, although in fact the company was simply wound up on 24 September 1974 ‚Äì Eventually, in 2009, Marvel Comics purchased the rights to Marvelman from Mick Anglo, together with the rights for the 1980s Miracleman revival. having established that Anglo owned the rights to the character. Alan Moore is on record as saying that \\"I'm very happy for this book to get published ‚Äì because that means money will finally go to Marvelman's creator, Mick Anglo, and to his wife ... The main thing is that I will feel happy to know that Mick Anglo is finally getting the recompense he so richly deserves.\\" Marvel Comics press release at the time quoted Marvel CEO and publisher Dan Buckley as saying \\"It is an honor to work with Mick Anglo to bring his creation to a larger audience than ever before.\\" The press release quotes Mick Anglo as saying, \\"I did not think it would ever happen. It's a wonderful thing to see my creation finally back.\\" Marvel have since announced that the first release of Marvelman material under their imprint is Marvelman Classic Primer No. 1 in June 2010, featuring an interview with Mick Anglo at 93, and a cover drawn by him; which will be followed by reprints of the L. Miller Marvelman stories in chronological order.

Howard Duff, who has had plenty of experience as a gumshoe both on the radio and in films, is appropriately self-effacing, hard and handsome as the intrepid agent. Dan Duryea adds a surprising twist to his usual characterizations of tough hombres as the convict who turns on his own kind, and Shelley Winters gives a credible performance as the blonde moll who also gives the law a much-needed assist.

Steam powered donkeys were commonly found on large metal-hulled multi-masted cargo vessels in the later decades of the Age of Sail on through the Age of Steam, particularly heavily-sailed skeleton-crewed windjammers. A donkey used in forestry, also known as a logging engine, was often attached to a yarder for hauling logs from where trees were felled to a central processing area. The operator of a donkey was known as a donkeyman. Name Steam donkeys acquired their name from their origin in sailing ships, where the \\"donkey\\" engine was typically a small secondary engine used to load and unload cargo and raise the larger sails with small crews, or to power pumps. They were classified by their cylinder type ‚Äì simplex (single-acting cylinder) or duplex (a compound engine); by their connection to the winches (or \\"drums\\") ‚Äì triple-drum, double-drum, etc.; and by their different uses. A good deal of the cable- logging terminology derived from 19th-century merchant sailing, as much of the early technology originated in that industry. Common logging terms include high-lead yarder, ground-lead yarder, loader, snubber, and incline hoist. History =In logging= Steam donkey on display at Disney California Adventure Park theme park John Dolbeer, a founding partner of the Dolbeer and Carson Lumber Company in Eureka, California, invented the logging engine in that cityHistory of Eureka, California - Timeline of Historically Significant Events in August 1881. The patent (number: 256553) was issued April 18, 1882. On Dolbeer's first model, a 150-foot, -inch manila rope was wrapped several times around a gypsy head (vertically mounted spool) and attached at the other end to a log.Richard L. Williams, The Loggers (New York: Time-Life Books, 1976), 112‚Äì113; The invention of the internal-combustion engine led to the development of the diesel-powered tractor crawler, which eventually put an end to the steam donkey. Though some have been preserved in museums, very few are in operating order. A great number still sit abandoned in the forests. Design Steam donkey on display at Disney California Adventure Park theme park A logging donkey consists of a steam boiler and steam engine, connected to a winch mounted on a sled called a donkey sled. The donkeys were moved by simply dragging themselves with the winch line, originally hemp rope and later steel cable. They were used to move logs, by attaching lines to the logs and hauling them. The larger steam donkeys often had a \\"donkey house\\" (a makeshift shelter for the crew) built either on the skids or as a separate structure. Usually, a water tank, and sometimes a fuel oil tank, was mounted on the back of the sled. In rare cases, steam donkeys were also mounted on wheels. Later steam donkeys were built with multiple horizontally mounted drums/spools. Use Dolbeer \\"Logging Engine\\" (Patent 256,553) In the simplest logging setup a \\"line horse\\" would carry the cable out to a log where its tree had been downed. The cable would be attached, and, on signal, the donkey's operator (an engineer) would open the regulator, allowing the steam donkey to drag, or \\"skid\\", the log towards it. The log was taken either to a mill or to a \\"landing\\" where it would be transferred for onward shipment by railroad, road or river - either send down a flume, loaded onto boats, or floated directly in the water, often becoming part of a large log raft or \\"boom\\". Later, a \\"haulback\\" drum was added to the donkey, where a smaller cable could be routed around the \\"setting\\" and connected to the end of the heavier \\"mainline\\" to replace the line horse. A donkey was moved by attaching one of its cables to a tree, stump or other strong anchor, then dragging itself overland to the next yarding location. In Canada, and in particular Ontario, the donkey engine was often mounted on a barge that could float and thus winch itself over both land and water. Log booms would be winched across water with the engine, after which it would often be reconfigured with a saw to mill the timber. =Operator= gyppo logging operation in Tillamook County, Oregon. (October 1941) A logging donkey would be operated by an engineer Use of the term gained currency in 1920. known as a donkey puncher. In later times the donkey puncher was too far away from the end of the line for verbal communication, so whistle codes were developed similar to those used by tug boats employing steam whistles). The whistle operator was known as a whistle punk, who was placed between the men attaching the cables (choker setters), and the donkey puncher, so that he could see the choker setters. When the cables were attached, a series of whistle blows signaled the donkey to begin pulling and the choker setters to stay out of harm's way. The process was a closely orchestrated sequence of actions, where mistakes were often fatal and where good men stood in line for the jobs. Although the steam engine, and its whistle, have been replaced by gasoline and diesel engines, the whistle codes are still used in many current logging operations. The whistle has been replaced largely with airhorns. =Other uses= Steam donkeys were also found to be useful for powering other machines such as pile drivers, slide-back loaders (also known as \\"slide- jammers\\", cranes which were used to load logs onto railroad cars and which moved along the flat-bed rail cars that were to be loadedFrank A. King, Minnesota Logging Railroads (Minneapolis, Minnesota: University of Minnesota Press, 2003), pages 155-159.), and cherry pickers (a sled-mounted crane used for loading, onto railroad cars, logs that a grading crew had cut down). Sailing fishing vessels on the North sea operated vertical steam-driven capstans called ¬¥the donkey¬¥ to haul fishing lines and nets, some of which are still operating today, even though converted to compressed air. An auxiliary engine on a sailing craft (which does propel the vessel) is still sometimes informally known as \\"the donk\\". Preserved examples Willamette Steam donkey preserved at Caspar Lumber Company Camp 20 adjacent to California State Route 20 A functioning steam donkey is on display and occasionally operated at Fort Humboldt State Historic Park in Eureka, California. A non-functioning steam donkey accompanied by a plaque explaining the history of the machine is on permanent display at Grizzly River Run, an attraction at Disney California Adventure Park. Another collection of steam donkeys is located at the Point Defiance Park, Camp 6 Logging Museum located in Tacoma, Washington. The collection includes various steam donkeys, including one of the last very large ones built, and others at various stages of restoration. Another steam donkey is on display along an interpretive trail at the Sierra Nevada Logging Museum in Calaveras County, California, an indoor open-air museum about the Sierra Nevada logging industry and history.http://sierraloggingmuseum.org/ . accessed 7/7/2010 Another steam donkey is preserved at Legoland Billund on their Wild West gold-mine-themed railroad. On August 1, 2009, a Steam Donkey was officially unveiled at McLean Mill National Historic Site in Port Alberni, British Columbia. It is now the only commercially operating steam donkey in North America. On that occasion, due to extreme fire risk, demonstrations of the donkey were not performed, but the logs hauled by previous test runs of the donkey (and had been loaded onto a truck) were dumped into the McLean Mill millpond, representing the first steam-powered commercial logging operation in North America in decades. This machine continued to operate after R. B. Mclean shuttered the steam-powered McLean Mill site in 1965. It ran until 1972 and was abandoned on site. It was restored by the Alberni Valley Industrial Heritage Society in 1986 for Expo 86 and, more recently, was re-certified for commercial use at McLean Mill. Agreements have been made with forestland owner Island Timberlands (owned by Brookfield Asset Management) to log, mill, and sell trees and lumber from the surroundings of McLean Mill. A wide-face steam donkey (called that because the width of the drum is greater in proportion to that in later machines) has been operational at the Tillamook County Pioneer Museum in Tillamook, Oregon, since the early 1980s. Manufactured by the Puget Sound Iron & Steel Works in the early 1900s, this donkey was abandoned in the woods when the Reiger family finished logging their land in about 1952. The steam donkey was rescued and restored from 1979 to 1981. It was donated to the Pioneer Museum by the Ned Rieger family and has been on display on the Museum grounds. A vertical steam capstan called \\"donkey\\" for hauling fishing lines and nets is preserved on the museum fishing vessel Balder in the historic harbour of Vlaardingen (near Rotterdam), the Netherlands.

Over a period stretching from 1968 to 1970 the science fiction strip appeared in issues 60‚Äì70 of the RBCC. Issue #65 of the RBCC sported a Newton \\"Savage Earth\\" painting as its cover. Newton tried for years to leverage his connections in fandom into work at DC Comics or Marvel Comics, but he was at a distinct disadvantage living in Arizona. Marvel in particular wanted their artists close at hand. Newton finally set his sights a little lower and sent some sample pages to Nicola Cuti at Charlton Comics where his first professional comic book work was published. =Charlton Comics= Newton's first work for Charlton appeared in Ghost Manor #18 (May 1974) and would work on Charlton horror books for the next year and half. Besides drawing for the Charlton horror comics, Newton also began painting covers for their horror and romance books. Don Newton's cover to The Phantom #74 (Jan. 1977) featuring the Phantom of 1776. In October 1975 Newton's first issue of The Phantom, #67, was published. Newton would pencil and ink all of his Phantom work and would supply a cover painting for every issue he drew. Newton‚Äôs short run on the book featured two classic Newton pieces at Charlton. Issue #70 of The Phantom stars Humphrey Bogart, Lauren Bacall, Sydney Greenstreet, Peter Lorre, and Claude Rains and is a mixture of Casablanca, The African Queen, The Maltese Falcon, and The Treasure of the Sierra Madre. Newton‚Äôs final issue of The Phantom features the Phantom of 1776 meeting Benjamin Franklin. It has a Phantom cover, the Phantom of 1776, sword in one hand, flintlock pistol in the other in front of a smoky background of the Declaration of Independence and a tattered 13-star American flag. = After Charlton = Newton had always seen Charlton as a stepping-stone to Marvel Comics. While still working for Charlton, Newton worked on an issue of Giant- Size Defenders, did some small uncredited inking on a few issues of the Deadly Hands of Kung Fu magazine over Mike Vosburg's penciled artwork, a frontispiece for the Savage Sword of Conan and a single painting for Roy Thomas, which years later, became a cover for Thomas' magazine Alter Ego. Newton inked an issue of Ghost Rider over Don Heck's pencils and produced a cover for Marvel's Unknown Worlds of Science Fiction Annual. = DC Comics = Newton began his career at DC with DC Special #28 (July 1977). Newton contributed the pencils on an Aquaman strip inked by his old friend Dan Adkins. Newton would draw Aquaman off and on for the next three years. That same month saw the release of Newton's first series at DC, The New Gods #12. Dan Adkins inked most of his work on the New Gods. It was during his tenure on this strip that Newton left his job as a junior high school art teacher to go work full-time as an artist. In the middle of Newton's run on The New Gods, he and David Michelinie co- created the Star Hunters for DC but Newton dropped the feature after drawing two stories. One of Newton‚Äôs lifelong ambitions was to draw Captain Marvel and he fulfilled this desire in 1978 when he was signed as the new penciler for the Shazam! title. He would draw this strip in its own title, as well as in World's Finest Comics and Adventure Comics until October 1982. Newton began drawing the Batman character beginning with Batman #305 (November 1978), and would draw 79 stories featuring Batman or members of the Batman family during his tenure at DC. Newton and writer Dennis O'Neil co-created the Maxie Zeus character in Detective Comics #483 (April‚ÄìMay 1979).McAvennie \\"1970s\\" in Dolan, p. 181: \\"For Detective Comics fortieth anniversary, scribe Denny O'Neil and artist Don Newton told the tale of...mob boss Maxie Zeus - a former Greek mythology-obsessed history teacher, who considered himself a god.\\" O'Neil and Newton produced the story \\"The Vengeance Vow\\" in Detective Comics #485 (Aug.‚ÄìSept. 1979) in which the original Batwoman is killed by the League of Assassins.McAvennie \\"1970s\\" in Dolan, p. 183: \\"It was the League of Assassins' murder of Kathy (Batwoman) Kane that sent Batman out for revenge in a story by scripter Denny O'Neil and artist Don Newton.\\" =Marvel Comics= In 1979 Newton returned to Marvel. He wanted to draw Captain America, but that title was unavailable at the time and The Avengers was the closest Marvel could do to fulfilling that request. Newton took the assignment when he was promised Joe Rubinstein as his permanent inker on the book. Newton finished the pencils for only two issues before returning to DC. Those two issues of The Avengers became Avengers Annual #9, half of which was inked by Rubinstein, half by Jack Abel. In 1981 Don Newton again left DC for Marvel. As was the case the first time, better money was one of the factors that pushed him to Marvel. Marvel had other artists, such as Val Mayerik, call Don to entice him into working at Marvel again. Unlike the previous time, Joe Rubinstein was not part of the deal. The Avengers #204 featured inks by Dan Green. =DC again= During the time that Newton was drawing this second attempt at The Avengers book, he was contacted by Paul Levitz who promised him some additional advertising artwork, should Newton return to DC. After the Avengers inking by Green (which he had been unsatisfied with) and again the lack of scheduled work from Marvel, Newton agreed to accept a new contract with DC. Newton did two issues of Green Lantern in 1982. Both were Green Lantern Corps stories, one of which contained the first appearance of Ch'p, the squirrel-like Green Lantern of H'lven. Two years later Newton returned to Green Lantern in the only DC comics work he inked. In Newton‚Äôs obituary, Dick Giordano said of this work, \\"To my mind, Don's final statement was the Green Lantern Corps story he penciled and inked that appeared in Green Lantern #181. He showed us how to do it right.\\"Giordano, Dick, \\"Meanwhile\\" column\\", DC Comics cover dated February 1985. He drew the first appearance of Jason Todd in Batman #357 (March 1983),Manning, Matthew K. \\"1980s\\" in Dolan, p. 201: \\"Jason Todd first appeared in a circus scene in the pages of Batman #357, written by Gerry Conway and illustrated by Don Newton.\\" a character who became the second Robin.Manning \\"1980s\\" in Dolan, p. 207 Newton had always told DC that the only series he would like to draw other than Batman and Captain Marvel was All-Star Squadron. Editor/writer Roy Thomas tapped into that interest by proposing that Newton draw Infinity, Inc., featuring the children of the original All-Star characters. The first issue scheduled to contain Newton's art was Infinity Inc. #11 featuring a five-page framing sequence by Newton which surrounded a story drawn by George Tuska and Mike Machlan. Newton was to begin penciling the entire book with issue #12, but the letters page in issue #11 told of Newton's death. Newton suffered a massive heart attack in his home, after dealing with months of a debilitating throat ailment. He died three days later on August 19, 1984, in a nearby Mesa hospital. While Newton was in the hospital in a coma, the first three pages of Infinity Inc. #12 were sent to Thomas. Rubinstein was brought in to ink them and Newton‚Äôs Phoenix friend John Clark lettered the pages at Thomas' request. As a final tribute to Newton, Marvel Editor-in-Chief Jim Shooter let Rubinstein out of his contract for a month so that he could ink a fill-in issue Newton had done. It became Infinity Inc. #13 (April 1985). This was Newton's last published original work. In 2011, DC published Tales of the Batman: Don Newton, a hardcover collection of Newton's Batman stories. =Death= Newton died on August 19, 1984, after suffering a massive heart attack.

They add electron correlation which is a more accurate way of including the repulsions between electrons than in the Hartree‚ÄìFock method where repulsions are only averaged.  Details  In general, the SCF procedure makes several assumptions about the nature of the multi-body Schr√∂dinger equation and its set of solutions: * For molecules, the Born‚ÄìOppenheimer approximation is inherently assumed. The true wavefunction should also be a function of the coordinates of each of the nuclei. * Typically, relativistic effects are completely neglected. The momentum operator is assumed to be completely nonrelativistic. * The basis set is composed of a finite number of orthogonal functions. The true wavefunction is a linear combination of functions from a complete (infinite) basis set. * The energy eigenfunctions are assumed to be products of one-electron wavefunctions. The effects of electron correlation, beyond that of exchange energy resulting from the anti-symmetrization of the wavefunction, are completely neglected. For the great majority of systems under study, in particular for excited states and processes such as molecular dissociation reactions, the fourth item is by far the most important. As a result, the term post‚ÄìHartree‚ÄìFock method is typically used for methods of approximating the electron correlation of a system. Usually, post‚ÄìHartree‚ÄìFock methods give more accurate results than Hartree‚ÄìFock calculations, although the added accuracy comes with the price of added computational cost. Post‚ÄìHartree‚ÄìFock methods * Configuration interaction (CI) * Coupled cluster (CC) * Multi- configuration time-dependent Hartree (MCTDH,) * M√∏ller‚ÄìPlesset perturbation theory (MP2, MP3, MP4, etc.) * Quadratic configuration interaction (QCI) * Quantum chemistry composite methods (G2, G3, CBS, T1. etc.)  Related methods Methods that use more than one determinant are not strictly post‚ÄìHartree‚ÄìFock methods, as they use a single determinant as reference, but they often use similar perturbation, or configuration interaction methods to improve the description of electron correlation. These methods include: * Multi-configurational self-consistent field (MCSCF) * Multireference single and double configuration interaction (MRCISD) * N-electron valence state perturbation theory (NEVPT).

Commonly known as the dog lichens, species of Peltigera are often terricolous (growing on soil), but can also occur on moss, trees, rocks, and many other substrates in many parts of the world. Most species of Peltigera have the cyanobacterium Nostoc as the dominant phytobiont but some have the chlorophyte Coccomyxa in which case they also have small gall-like growths containing Nostoc. Because of their ability to fix nitrogen from the atmosphere, such lichens are influential in soil composition and generation. Description Species of Peltigera are foliose, with broad lobed thalli. Although the size of the thalli is variable and species-dependent, in some species the thalli can grow quite large, up to 30 cm in diameter.Vitikainen O. (1994). (1998). Taxonomic notes on neotropical species of Pelitgera. In: Lichenology in Latin America: history, current knowledge and applications. Edited by M. P. Marcelli, and M.R.D. Seaward. CETESB, Companhia de Tecnologia de Saneamento Ambiental, Estado de Sao Paulo. pp. 135-139. The color of the upper surface may range from drab gray, brown or greenish. Lower surfaces are typically without a cortex (unlike other foliose lichens),Fioliose lichens, Lichen Thallus Types, Allan Silverside and cottony, often with fungal hyphae fused to form a network of veins. The reproductive structures isidia, soredia or lobules may be present in some species. All species of Peltigera associate with the nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria Nostoc. =Habitat= P. didactyla is a common pioneer species on disturbed soils and nutrient poor grasslands in Western Europe. At Deception Island in the South Shetlands archipelago, P. didactyla was found growing extensively on ash from volcanic eruptions that occurred in the late 1960s and 1970. Taxonomy In 1753, Linnaeus first described the species Lichen apthosus and L. caninus back when all known lichens were grouped into the genus Lichen.Linnaeus C. (1753). Species plantarum. Stockholm. Later, in 1787, Willdenow circumscribed the genus Peltigera, and redescribed P. aphthosa and P. canina.Willdenow 1787 The generic name is derived from the Latin language pelta (small shield), and refers to the shield-shaped thallus in these species. The common name, the dog lichen, refers to the perceived resemblance of P. caninus to a dog. =Phylogeny= In a comparative analysis of both morphological and chemical characteristics as well as sequences of large subunit nuclear ribosomal DNA, it was shown that the genus Peltigera is monophyletic. Distribution The Peltigera have a widespread distribution, and are found on all continents. There are 34 North American species, 30 European species, 25 species from South America, and 16 species from New Zealand.

P. apthosa was used as a remedy for cough and infantile aphthae.Vartia KO. (1950). On the medicinal use of lichens. Academic dissertation. Helsinki: 11‚Äì21. P. furfuracea has shown potent antioxidant activity and reducing power. Similarly, Peltigera specimens from Hawaii and Iceland have also been reported to show pronounced antioxidant activity. =Food source= Although a few reports have described caribou and reindeer feeding on the thalli of Peltigera, in general, species of Peltigera are not commonly used as a food source by mammals. A study of the grazing habits of the land snails Cantareus aspersa and Limax species revealed that these snails prefer to eat Peltigera species (such as P. praetextata) that are lacking in secondary metabolites. =Bioactive compounds= Peltigera leucophlebia contains the compounds tenuiorin and methyl orsellinate, which are inhibitory to the enzyme 15-lipoxygenase. Tenuiorin is also known to occur in P. apthosa, P. malacea and P. neckeri. A mixture of methyl and ethyl orsellinates have been identified from P. aphthosa that had antibacterial activity against Gram- positive and -negative bacteria. The novel non-protein amino acids solorinine and peltigerine have been detected in various species of Peltigera. References Further reading Gilbert, O. Lichens Naturally Scottish. 2004.

It is the provincial capital of Sultan Kudarat. According to the , it has a population of people. Etymology The Christian settlers would have preferred to decide the name of their new town by referendum. However, Captain Gunting, both revered and feared, had decided it by himself. Datu Kudanding had reacted to the history of local battles way back in the early. Until 19th century when a sultanate in the adjacent town of Maganoy under Sultan Utto with a vast army decided to attack a small municipality located in the area now encompassed by the new entity under the leadership of Sultan Kudarat Mopak. Outnumbered with the ratio of 20:1, Sultan Kudarat Mopak on a white horse decided to do battle with his men notwithstanding the odds. The battle cry of Sultan Kudarat was the uttering of the word, ‚ÄúIsu-silan‚Äù which means ‚ÄúThey are there, advance‚Äù. This intrepid, although suicidal show of force and determination, so impressed by Utto, that in order to save lives on both sides, he decided to resolve the issue by negotiation, thus placing Kudarat and his principality under his protectorate of Utto, Isulan municipality derived its name from ‚ÄúIsu-silan ‚Äú which means ‚ÄúProgress‚Äù. History The present territories of Isulan formerly belonged to the municipalities of Koronadal and Dulawan. The municipality of Koronadal was created under E.O. No. 82 dated August 8, 1947 by Pres. Manuel L. Roxas. 0n March 10, 1953, the municipality of Norala was created by virtue of E.O.NO.572, whose territorial jurisdiction was taken from the municipality of Koronadal. Datu Kudanding Camsa in the latter part of 1956 initiated the creation of another municipality to be taken from the Municipality of Norala. On March 20, 1957, Engr. Jose M. Ancheta of the Bureau of Public Highways of Cotabato made its first endorsement to the provincial board and laid down the proposed boundaries of the new municipality. Acting on this report, the provincial board of Cotabato thru Resolution No. 316 series of 1957, petitioned the President of the Philippines to create the proposed municipality. Executive Order No. 266, pursuant to section 68 of the Administrative Code, issued and signed by the then President Carlos P. Garcia on August 30, 1957, creating the municipality of Isulan, whose territorial jurisdiction was taken from the municipality of Norala, South Cotabato, and Dulawan, Cotabato. With the creation of the municipality of Isulan, Kalawag became the seat of its government. The municipal government officially functioned on September 12, 1957 with the appointment of its municipal mayor Datu Suma Ampatuan who served until 1967. =The Kalawag Settlement= In 1951, the Board of Directors of the Land Settlement and Development Cooperation (LASEDECO) started the opening of a settlement in an area formerly under the jurisdiction of the National Land Settlement Association (NLSA) as a reservation. The LASEDECO had surveyed and parceled out home and farm lots and constructed municipal and barrio roads and installed electrical light generators. It had brought-in hundreds of farm tractors which uprooted big trees, cleared obstruction, planned, cleaned and harrowed the wide stretches of the area. What was once a marshy and wild expanse inhabited by snakes, crocodiles, wild cattle, swine, and deer had welcomed the first sprout of seedlings of corn and rice, thus blanketed the horizon in endless green. When a group of 72 World War II Veterans, led by Venancio Magbanua, Post Commander of Norala had come and settled in the area, on September 7, 1950, a Kalawag root crop used as food coloring was found out abundantly growing. Then, the early settlers decided to call and register the settlement as ‚ÄúKalawag Settlement District of LASEDECO‚Äù. The area comprising the town site covers approximately 400 hectares. Immigrants from Visayas and Luzon had now come in shiploads. The most numerous batch was the ‚ÄúPACSA‚Äù group headed by Pedro Gabriel and Bienvenido Pamintuan otherwise known as the ‚ÄúPresidential Assistance Commission on Social Amelioration of the President Ramon Magsaysay. His group consisted of the erstwhile and rebellious surrenderees belonging to HUKBALAHAPs from Pampanga. On June 21, 1969, President Marcos, signed R.A. No. 5960, creating the municipality of Bagumbayan which cost Isulan more than 85% of its original land area. But of the original land area of 336,000 hectares, only 49,551 hectares were left and the 48 barrios were reduced to 17. Upon the passage of H.B.

Isulanons believe that the wealth of arts and culture is expressed in many forms and in so many kinds. The festival showcases skills and talents in literary, musical and cultural aspects of the constituents both young and old. The Hamungaya also depicts the thanksgiving festival of its residents who are mostly engaged in agriculture. This includes rice and corn farming, vegetables and crops production including the famous African palm which has contributed a lot to the utilization of its by-products as construction materials ‚Äì the uniquely woven ‚Äùkalakat‚Äù known all over Mindanao. The festival is divided into two parts: the first part shows the different activities being done in the farm. After which a thanksgiving is performed for their good harvest. The second part shows the merrymaking in the form of dance using different properties and materials that make it very festive. As a whole, the Hamungaya Festival actually expresses life itself or deep-seated emotion communicated by the emotions of the human body blending with the music. The flow of body movements, the sound of the music and the grace with which the dance is executed all build up the story or emotions being communicated. No doubt, this is a unique form of art, and along with other activities or talent being displayed during festivities, it is a contribution to the dreams of establishing solidarity among the peoples in the province of Sultan Kudarat.

History In the early days of the coming of Shariff Kabunsuan in Mindanao, Palimbang was not yet a dot on any geographical map of the island. This place was a mere abode of the primitive people whom we call not the cultural minority or highlander. According to Tarsila, there was a tremendous change in the society due to the spread out of Islam in the coastal areas widely known as Biwang, which later paved a way toward Islamic Civilization of the inhabitants. Palimbang at that time was locally known as Pula a tree widely grown in the place. A group of fishermen from Palimbang, Indonesia was lifted by strong winds and accidentally docked at the mouth of Pula River. They were warmly welcomed by the native datus headed by Sondalo Tambuto. The hospitality shown to them reigned in their hearts and drawn the visitors to settle and intermarry with the native Muslims. A new community was developed and later named Palimbang, in honor of the fishermen's hometown, which now remained the name of the municipality. Attempts to create Palimbang into municipality was thrice first, by the energetic leadership of Dr. Julio Sarayba in the 1940s; second, on July 24, 1953 by the seventeen (17) influential leaders of PAT-A-INGED (four communities) (1) Kraan, (2) Kanipaan, (3) Pula and (4) Maganao, namely: Dr. Julio Sarayba, Chairman; Sixto Quijano, Vice Chairman; Mr. Remegio Managad, Mr. Pedro Mamon, Mr. Pedro Bonifacio, Mr. Cresencio Geneza, Mr. Felipe Tunngala, Datu Pasay Ayao, Datu Manti Pangansayan, Mr. Lomontod Latip, Datu Talicop Lidasan, Datu Sundalo Tambuto, Haji Salik Manan, Hadji Druz Ali, Mr. Cecilio Domingo, Mr. Gorgonio Bagang, Mr. Dominador Durendez and Datu Sumana Sulog, members. Others are Datu Padasan Macut, Datu Obpon Dipatuan, Datu Pelangking Bayang and Mr. Dominador Garcia. It was a blast to the petitioners as they were regarded mentally unable to run their own government and the income of the barrios in the coastal portion was insufficient to meet the requisite of creating a new municipality. Third, by the same petitioner who collectively agreed to support candidates that will ascertain a seat of government in Palimbang in case they get elected. Fortunately, the well- supported Datu Udtog Matalam faction won. Subsequently, headed by the Provincial Governor of Cotabato Datu Udtog Matalam, the Provincial Governor of Cotabato recommended by the Members of the Board, sponsored by Congressman Salipada K. Pendatun, and supported by Datu Guiwan Mastura and Kiamba Mayor Cornelio Falgui, Palimbang was proclaimed municipality on August 14, 1959 by virtue of Executive Order No. 350, pursuant to Section 68 Revised Administrative Code, issued by His Excellency President Carlos P. Garcia. From its creation up to the present, Palimbang was served by twelve (12) generations of municipal officials. Datu Guiwan Mastura the Deputy Governor at-large became the appointed mayor who served the municipality until the 1963 election. Datu Guiwan Mastura then became the appointed & first elected mayor of Palimbang. Mayor Datu Guiwan Mastura lost to Mayor Datu Druz Ali, Al-Haj in the 1967 election who remained supreme until the 1986 EDSA Revolution. The Revolutionary Government under President Corazon C. Aquino appointed Mocsin Manondong, Officer-In-Charge (OIC) but he ran for Provincial Board Member. Dimalub Namil became OIC Mayor during the 1988 election. Mayor Labualas B. Mamansual was elected in the 1988 election and was re-elected in the 1992 and 1995 elections respectively, completing the three (3) consecutive term limit. Mayor Karim ‚ÄúKing‚Äù Daud was installed after the 1998 election. Mayor Labualas B. Mamansual was elected in the 2001 election and was re-elected in the 2004 and 2007 election, completing again the three (3) consecutive term limit. A fresh and renewed mandate, was given to Mayor Abubacar P. Maulana in the May 2010 election. In spite of the exceptional development potentials of Palimbang, the municipality is somehow left in terms of physical development. The municipal government is exploring strategies and pouring its meager resources to meet and welcome new challenges. With the private sector at the helm of its economy, coupled with its supportive citizenry and strong political leadership committed to the full development of its human and natural resources, the municipality will certainly make its vision for development. The municipality of Palimbang was transferred from Cotabato Province to Province of Sultan Kudarat on November 22, 1973 by presidential decree 341 of President Ferdinand E. Marcos. Malisbong Massacre The Malisbong Masjid massacre, also called the Palimbang massacre, was the mass murder of Moros on September 24, 1974, in the coastal village of Malisbong in Palimbang, Sultan Kudarat, Mindanao where units of Gov. Siongco and the Philippine Army killed more than 1,000. Accounts compiled by the Moro Women's Center in General Santos City state that 1,500 male Moros aged 11‚Äì70 were killed inside a mosque, 3,000 women and children aged 9‚Äì60 were detained - with the women being raped and that 300 houses were razed by the government forces. The massacre occurred two years after Ferdinand Marcos declared martial law in September 1972. The massacre started after the first four days on the feast of Ramadan when members of the Philippine Constabulary arrived and captured barangay officials along with 1,000 other Muslims and never came back. For more than a month, the military would capture murder residents in the area by batch. Testimonies show that victims were made to strip of their clothes, dig their own graves and shot. Barangays Palimbang is politically subdivided into 40 barangays.

Life and career Marx was born in Graz and pursued studies in philosophy, art history, German studies, and music at Graz University, earning several degrees including a doctorate in 1909. His thesis was an expansion of a 1907 scholarly study of tonality, in which he coined the term \\"atonality\\".Berkant Haydin, Stefan Esser (Joseph Marx Society, 2009). Chandos, liner notes to \\"Joseph Marx: Orchestral Songs and Choral Works. Retrieved 23 October 2014 He began composing seriously in 1908 and over the next four years he produced around 120 songs. In 1914 he joined the faculty of the Vienna Music Academy, later becoming the institution's director in 1922. When the school was reorganized as the Hochschule f√ºr Musik in 1924 he was appointed to the position of rector, holding that post for three years. Some of his notable students include Johann Nepomuk David, Lucijan Marija ≈†kerjanc, Paul Ulanowsky, Ivana Lang, Alois Melichar, Clara Wildschut and Hisatada Otaka. From 1931 to 1938 he was music critic for the Neues Wiener Journal and following World War II he was critic for the Wiener Zeitung. A collection of Marx's criticisms and essays, Betrachtungen eines romantischen Realisten was published in Vienna in 1947. Just before he died he published a book on acoustics, tonality, aesthetics and musical philosophy entitled Weltsprache Musik (Vienna, 1964). As a composer Marx is chiefly remembered for his vocal music, particularly his more than 150 lieder. Although most of his songs used piano accompaniment, about two dozen of them used symphonic accompaniment. His style is characterized by Slavonic and Italian elements, often with an impressionistic kind of lyricism. His output in the 1920s and early 1930s was focused on orchestral works, followed by a period devoted primarily to chamber music for the remainder of his career. In an interview given to Elyse Mach (\\"Great Contemporary Pianists Speak for Themselves\\"; Dover Books on Music), Jorge Bolet said that the \\"Romantic Piano Concerto\\" by Joseph Marx was his favorite among the great virtuoso concertos because of the enormous show of strength required from the soloist.

According to the , it has a population of people. It is made up of Samal Island and the smaller Talikud Island in the Davao Gulf, from the merger of former municipalities of Samal, Babak, and Kaputian. Samal is a part of the Metropolitan Davao area and is two kilometers away from Davao City, the largest city and the primary economic center of Mindanao. Etymology The name Samal was derived from the Sama-Bajau peoples, the natives who were the first inhabitants of the island. The first datu in the island was Datu Taganiyug, a native of what is now Pe√±aplata, today the governance center of the city. In the past, the people of the island name a place about what was the said place known for. For example, the name Pe√±aplata is said to be derived from the word \\"pi√±a\\" or pineapple because of the abundance of pineapple in the area; this, however, is folk etymology, for pe√±aplata literally means \\"rock of silver\\" in Spanish. Tagpopongan is the first barangay in the island which name was from the word \\"tagpo\\" or meet. It was so called owing to the fact that this place was chosen by the datus as their meeting place. The word Samal was also known before because it was commonly used as surname by datus. History =Early Beginnings= The island was initially home to the Sama-Bajau peoples. Later on, Spain managed to conquer the * island in the late 1840s when Nueva Vergara (Davao City today) was established. =World War 2= The Pacific War, which happened during World War II, struck the island. Japanese fighter planes bombed the island. Japanese forces occupied the island and forced the people to work for four years until they were expelled by the Allied forces. After the war, infrastructure was built, like schools, churches and stores in the area. =Official founding of the municipality= The time came on July 8, 1948, when the entire island itself becomes part of the newly created municipality of Samal;per Executive Order No. 151, s. 1948 it was the official founding of the municipality. Five years later in 1953, the municipality of Babak was created from Samal,per Executive Order No. 596, s. 1953 marking the political division of the island between the two municipalities. Now came the political division of the island between the three municipalities, when the municipality of Kaputian was created from the island in 1966.per Republic Act No. 4754 of June 18, 1966 In this period, the living qualities between these three municipalities became low and extremely rural. =Proposed province= In 1969, a proposal to create the sub-province of Samal was created by Republic Act No. 5999 and covered the area of the present-day city. The act was enacted without President Ferdinand Marcos' approval. However, the sub-province was never inaugurated. =City conversion= The city was created through Republic Act No. 8471 on January 30, 1998. This act paved the way for the dissolution and merger of the three former municipalities of Samal, Babak, and Kaputian into one local government unit by turning then into districts, now officially named as IGaCoS, the Island Garden City of Samal. The first city mayor was Rogelio P. Antalan, who later served for three consecutive terms from 1998 to 2007. =Hostage crisis= On September 22, 2015, Kjartan Sekkingstad, aged 55, from Sotra, Norway, was abducted by Abu Sayyaf Islamist guerrillas from a high-end tourist resort on Samal Island, along with two Canadian men, John Ridsdel, aged 68, and Robert Hall, aged 67, and a Filipina woman, Marites Flor, Hall's girlfriend. In April and June 2016, the Canadians were beheaded after ransoms were not paid, and in June 2016 Flor was released. On September 17, 2016, Sekkingstad was released on Jolo island, 600 miles south of Manila after captor Abu Sayyaf received $638,000 in ransom for his release. He was handed over to another rebel group, the Moro National Liberation Front. The MNLF was in peace talks with the government and had been working with authorities to secure Sekkingstad's release. It is not known who paid the ransom for Sekkingstad, but it was not Norwegian authorities.http://norwaytoday.info/news/abu-sayyaf-released-sekkingstad/ Geography Baywalk in Babak District, Samal Island Samal is the only city in the country that encompasses two entire islands, hence its name as the Island Garden City. While pristine beaches dot the island's shores, hills dominate the middle portions of the island. Talikud Island is located southwest of the main island. IGaCoS enjoys an evenly distributed rainfall throughout the year and a typhoon free climate, which make it ideal for agricultural production. =Barangays= Samal is politically subdivided into 46 barangays. In 1955, the sitios of Mambago, San Isidro, Santo Ni√±o, San Antonio, San Agustin, Dangcaan, Balet, Tambo, Camudmud, and Cogon were converted into barrios of the now-defunct municipality of Babak. =Climate= Demographics Cebuano is the medium of language of the people of Samal Island, followed by Isama, Boholano and Tausug. Economy =Agriculture= The city's economy depends greatly in its agricultural production. Copra, mango, corn, vegetables, citrus and fish are the major products of the island. Livestock production is also a major product with Davao City as the primary market. In addition, rice is also produced in the barangays of Libuak in Babak District and Aumbay in Pe√±aplata District. =Tourism= Beach in Kaputian, Samal Island The city is the largest resort city in the country. It has good beaches and houses many beach resorts. It has also numerous marine reefs and tranquil waters that lure the tourists to visit them, especially in Talikud Island. There are 34 registered resorts with a combined capacity of 1,000 rooms in the city. The most popular of these is the Pearl Farm Beach Resort, owned by Ms. Universe 1973 winner Margarita Moran. Because of these, the Department of Tourism named it one of the best visiting islands in Mindanao and currently one of the fastest growing tourist destinations in the country. Thus, tourism is the main source of income in the city. Biggest taxes are imposed to tourism and resort industry. Bigiw sailboats in Samal Island There are three main festivals held annually in the city, namely: *Kabasan Festival, coincides with the founding of Babak municipality every year in May, features bikini open contests, fireworks display, street-dancing and street parties, and motocross events *White Nights Festival, takes place every two days with Kaputian as the venue, celebrating the city's cultural and historical heritage; and *Hugyaw Madayaw Festival, a spin-off of Davao's Kadayawan Festival which is also held annually in August, and also an attempt to preserve the diminishing Sama culture in the island. Monfort Bat Sanctuary, the world's largest fruit bat colony, is also located in the island. =Fishing= Fishing is also a growing business sector in this city, since the city was situated on the island, it cannot fully complement the demand for meat products imported from other parts of the country, especially in nearby Davao City. The city has no both container port and deep-water transport terminal, except for a barge wharf at Babak district, to deliver market products directly to the city, so the city government advocated building fishery complexes across the city to minimize the demand for market products imported to the city. Fish, pearls, and edible crustaceans such as shrimps, prawns, and crabs are the main aquatic consumable products in the city. Government The center of city governance is located at Barangay Pe√±aplata, Samal District, situated at the west central coast of the island. The city has three districts: Babak, Samal and Kaputian. These districts used to serve as separate towns until the 1998 city merger. Transportation Samal Circumferential Road in Babak District, Samal Island Barge/ferry service or passenger boats from the Sasa Wharf & Santa Ana Wharf in Davao City serves the island city. The modes of transportation on the island are motorcycles, tricycles or trikes, and bus and private car services offered by resorts. Bus operators: #Island City Express (operated by Mindanao Star) daily route to Kaputian, Babak, Pe√±aplata from Davao City (via Kinawitnon ferry port).

He was a pupil of Franz Liszt and one of the most distinguished pianists of his generation. Josef Hofmann called von Sauer \\"a truly great virtuoso.\\"Quoted in Schonberg, 317. Martin Krause, another Liszt pupil, called von Sauer \\"the legitimate heir of Liszt; he has more of his charm and geniality than any other Liszt pupil.\\"Quoted in Heliotes, 9. Life Sauer was born in Hamburg, Germany on 8 October 1862 as Emil Georg Conrad Sauer. He studied with Nikolai Rubinstein at the Moscow Conservatory between 1879 and 1881. On an 1884 visit to Italy he met the Countess von Sayn-Wittgenstein, who recommended him to her former paramour, Franz Liszt. He went on to study with Liszt for two years, but did not for some time consider himself a Liszt pupil. In an 1895 interview, he even denied it: \\"It is not correct to regard me as a pupil of Liszt, though I stayed with him for a few months. He was then very old, and could not teach me much. My chief teacher has been, undoubtedly, Nicholas Rubinstein.\\" In his later years, however, Sauer realized the influence of Liszt on himself and on music in general.heliotes, 11. From 1882 Sauer made frequent and successful tours as a virtuoso pianist; his performing career lasted until 1940. He premiered in London in 1894 and New York in 1899.Modern Musicians by J.

Sauer left this post in April 1907 but returned to it in 1915.Anderson, 16:521. Some of his pupils continued on to successful concert or other significant music careers, In 1917, Sauer was raised to the peerage by the Austrian-Hungarian Monarchy, which added the nobiliary particle \\"von\\" to his name. He was also awarded the Gold Medal of the Royal Philharmonic Society of London. Emil von Sauer was married twice. Angelica Morales (Sauer), his second wife, carried on his legacy in teaching. Sauer had two sons with Morales ‚Äî Julio and Franz. He died in Vienna, Austria on 27 April 1942, aged 79. Emil von Sauer, November 25, 1905 recording for Welte-Mignon in Leipzig. Left: Karl Bockisch Playing Regardless of his own opinion initially, Sauer was considered to have emphasized the original Liszt approach to piano as well as a strong Romantic approach to a musical technique which demanded total command of the keyboard in what was known as the Liszt School of piano. Unlike his fellow pupil Moriz Rosenthal, who could overwhelm the keyboard with orchestral force, von Sauer was said to caress the piano in a suave, polished manner. His recordings show him as a smooth pianist who was inclined toward relaxed tempos and the exactitude of detail over temperament.Schonberg, 317. While his playing may have sometimes lacked breadth, it was always elegant and beautifully finished.Anderson, 16:521. Compositions Along with editing the complete piano works of Johannes Brahms and a number of academic works by Pischna, Plaidy and Kullak, Sauer wrote piano concertos, piano sonatas, concert √©tudes, piano pieces and lieder.

A woman named Cosima \\"Codi\\" Noline returns to her hometown of Grace, Arizona to help her aging father, who is slowly losing his struggle with Alzheimer's disease. She takes a biology teacher position at the local high school and lives with her old high school friend, Emelina. Animal Dreams features Kingsolver's trademark‚Äîalternating perspectives throughout the novel. Most chapters are told from the perspective of Codi, while others are told from her father, Homer's, perspective. The book was dedicated to Ben Linder, who was killed by the Contras on April 28, 1987. The novel features some Hispanic and Native American themes. Codi's sister, Halimeda \\"Hallie\\", moves to Nicaragua to teach local people more sustainable farming techniques and dies after being captured by the Contras. Another political theme in the novel is the small town's fight against the Black Mountain Mining Company, which pollutes the river water and nearly destroys the citizens' orchard trees, Grace's primary economic livelihood. In addition to political themes like these, many of Kingsolver's novels also feature images and themes from biology. Animal Dreams is rich with natural imagery and the study of the created world. And, as with most Kingsolver novels, this one is laced with genial humor. Plot summary Animal Dreams opens with a chapter narrated in the third person from the point of view of Doc Homer. This establishes a double narrative voice, which switches between dreams and memories of the past and events of the present. Doc Homer remembers his daughters, Codi and Hallie, when they were young. Their mother is dead. In the second chapter, narrated by Codi in first person, the plot line begins. Hallie leaves Tucson, Arizona, where she was living with Codi and Carlo, for Nicaragua. She plans to assist the newly established communist regime with their crop cultivation. Shortly thereafter, Codi also leaves Tucson, returning to her small rural hometown, Grace, to care for her ailing father and to teach high school biology. The return to Grace is fraught with difficulty for Codi, as she has always felt herself an outsider in the town and has never had a very close relationship with her father. Her return home raises the specter of several mysteries surrounding Codi and her family's past: her failure to hold a medical license despite her attendance at medical school, the deaths of her mother and of her child, and the relationship of her family to the rest of the community. In Grace, Codi stays in her friend Emelina Domingos's guest house. As the two women talk, Codi's high school relationship with Loyd Peregrina is revealed. Loyd, a friend of Emelina's husband J.T., still lives and works in town. Re-visiting Grace, Codi is again struck by her feeling of being an outsider. Codi and Hallie's mother died shortly after Hallie's birth. At the age of fifteen, Codi became pregnant with and then miscarried Loyd's child. She never told anyone. Her father, the town doctor, was aware of the situation, but Codi still does not know this. Codi and Loyd meet again and begin a new relationship. Loyd, a Native American who grew up on the nearby Reservation, is ready to establish a serious and committed relationship, but Codi is not ready to imagine herself as staying in one place or loving only one person. Loyd accepts her ambivalence. They continue to see each other, and he teaches her about Native American Cultures.

Tyler also played the mummy in 1940's The Mummy's Hand, a popular Universal Studios monster film. Early years Born Vincent Markowski or Markowsky (sources differ) in Port Henry, New York, to Lithuanian-American parents,Chapman, p. 9. Helen (n√©e Montvilos) and Frank Markowski. he had two brothers: Frank Jr. and Joe (who changed his last name to Marko), and two sisters: Katherine (Mrs. Slepski), and Maliane \\"Molly\\" (Mrs. Redge). He made his First Communion in a small church in Mineville around 1910. His father and older brother worked in the mines for the Witherbee Sherman Company.Chapman, p. 10. In 1913, his family moved to Hamtramck, Michigan, where he attended St. Florian Elementary School and Hamtramck High School. After graduating high school, he left home and made his way west, finding work as a seaman on a merchant steamer in the U.S. Merchant Marine, a coal miner in Pennsylvania, a lumberjack in the Northwest, and even a prizefighter.Rainey, p. 137. Weightlifting Tyler was an amateur weightlifter sponsored by the Los Angeles Athletic Club during the late 1920s. He set a new world's amateur record for the right-hand clean and jerk by lifting .Rainey, p. 138. In 1928, he won the Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) heavyweight weightlifting championship, lifting ‚Äîa record that stood for fourteen years. Early film career Around 1924, Tyler arrived in California and found work in the film industry as a prop man and extra. His first screen appearances as an extra included Three Weeks (1924), Leatherstocking (1924), and Wild Horse Mesa (1925). In 1925, Tyler was signed to a contract with Film Booking Offices of America (FBO) to star in a series of Western adventures with a starting salary of about $75 per week. His first starring role was in Let's Go Gallagher (1925). In the next four years, he starred in 28 additional Westerns for FBO, including The Masquerade Bandit (1926), The Sonora Kid (1927), The Texas Tornado (1928), The Avenging Rider (1928), and Pride of the Pawnee (1929). While romance was generally underplayed in these early Westerns, a number of up-and-coming heroines‚Äîincluding Doris Hill, Jean Arthur, and Nora Lane‚Äîcontributed to the overall appeal of Tyler's films,Rainey, p. 139. which enjoyed critical praise and were popular with Saturday matinee audiences. His four years with FBO gave him valuable riding and acting experience, and made him a popular cowboy hero in the latter years of the silent film era. In 1929, Tyler signed with Syndicate Pictures, where he made his last eight silent films in 1929 and 1930, which included The Man from Nevada (1929), Pioneers of the West (1929), The Canyon of Missing Men (1930), and Call of the Desert (1930). In 1930, Tyler was loaned out to Mascot Pictures for his first \\"all talking\\" sound film, The Phantom of the West, a typical ten-chapter Saturday matinee cowboy cliffhanger featuring a mysterious secret villain and numerous stunts and action sequences. Kermit Maynard, the brother of Ken Maynard, was Tyler's stunt double in the more dangerous sequences. In 1931, Tyler made his first Syndicate sound film, West of Cheyenne, which showcased an excellent voice for Westerns, despite his awkward delivery of lines. Tyler concluded his tenure with Syndicate Pictures with Rider of the Plains (1931) and God's Country and the Man (1931). He was also strongly considered for the role of Tarzan by MGM in their Tarzan the Ape Man (1932)Weissmuller Jr, Johnny Tarzan, My Father ECW Press, 1 Feb 2008 Monogram Pictures Syndicate merged into Monogram Pictures, which signed Tom Tyler to an eight-picture contract as part of the company's sagebrush series. These typical low-budget \\"quickies\\" included Man from Death Valley (1931), Single-Handed Sanders (1932), The Man from New Mexico (1932), and Honor of the Mounted (1932)‚Äîeach made for about $8000. All of his Monogram films received critical and popular support. When Monogram chose Bob Steele to star in the next season's series, Tyler moved over to Universal to do three chapter plays‚Äîa safari yarn called Jungle Mystery (1932), Clancy of the Mounted (1933), and Phantom of the Air (1933)‚Äîwhile managing to fit in four low-budget Westerns for John R. Freuler's Monarch Pictures, including The Forty-Niners (1932), When a Man Rides Alone (1933), Deadwood Pass (1933), and War on the Range (1933). Reliable Pictures and Victory Pictures In 1934, Tyler signed a two-year contract with Harry S. Webb's Reliable Pictures for eighteen low-budget Western films, tailored as second features on double bills for second- and third-tier movie houses. These films included Mystery Ranch (1934), The Silver Bullet (1935), Born to Battle (1935), Silent Valley (1935), Fast Bullets (1936), and Santa Fe Bound (1936). Despite a few well-done scenes and some good performances by supporting players like Slim Whitaker, Charles King, Earl Dwire, and even the silent-era \\"Hebrew\\" comedian Max Davidson, most of these films were of average quality with production shortcomings that restricted the effectiveness of Tyler's performances. By 1936, companies such as Republic Pictures and Paramount Pictures were producing larger budget better-quality Western films with impressive exterior locations that overshadowed the type of Poverty Row low-budget offerings that brought Tyler to fame. In 1936, Tyler signed a two-year contract with Sam Katzman's new Victory Pictures for eight Western films, each budgeted at about $6000. The first five of these films were directed by Bob Hill and included Cheyenne Rides Again (1937) with Lucile Brown and Feud of the Trail (1937) in which Tyler played a dual role. Of lesser quality, the final three included two co- starring his wife, Jeanne Martel: Orphan of the Pecos (1937) and Lost Ranch (1937), the latter containing a rare scene in which Tyler lip syncs two songs: \\"Tucson Mary\\" and \\"Home on the Range\\". Following Brothers of the West (1937), Katzman did not renew Tyler's contract with Victory, replacing him with Tim McCoy as the company's top Western star. With no starring roles being offered to him, Tyler took a job with the Wallace Brothers Circus in 1938. He returned to Hollywood and appeared in supporting roles and bit parts in several feature films, including John Ford's Stagecoach (1939) with John Wayne, Drums Along the Mohawk (1939) with Henry Fonda, Gone With the Wind (1940) with Clark Gable, The Westerner (1940) with Gary Cooper, and John Ford's The Grapes of Wrath (1940) also with Henry Fonda. His most unusual role was that of Kharis the mummy in Universal's The Mummy's Hand (1940), in which he was cast because the studio felt he resembled a younger Boris Karloff well enough to match stock footage of Karloff from The Mummy (1932). Republic Pictures and popular serials In 1941, Tyler signed a two-year contract with Republic Pictures to star in 13 films in the popular The Three Mesquiteers series in the role of Stony Brooke opposite Bob Steele playing Tucson Smith, and Rufe Davis or Jimmie Dodd playing Lullaby Joslin. Tyler's $150-per-week salary during the first year was increased to $200 per week for the second year. These final 13 films in The Three Mesquiteers series (39 through 51) represent some of Tyler's best work, and his last leading roles: Outlaws of Cherokee Trail (1941), Gauchos of El Dorado (1941), West of Cimarron (1941), Code of the Outlaw (1942), Raiders of the Range (1942), Westward Ho (1942), The Phantom Plainsmen (1942), Shadows on the Sage (1942), Valley of Hunted Men (1942), Thundering Trails (1943), The Blocked Trail (1943), Santa Fe Scouts (1943), and Riders of the Rio Grande (1943), the last film in the series. During this period Republic, which failed to secure the rights to Superman, purchased the rights to another comic book superhero, Captain Marvel. In his late thirties at the time, Tyler was still in good shape and was offered the title role at $250 per week for four weeks' work. In the title role in The Adventures of Captain Marvel (1941), Tyler portrayed the first film adaptation of a comic book superhero. Tyler's last major screen role was in the Columbia Pictures serial The Phantom (1943), based on Lee Falk's famous comic strip. In costume, Tyler bore a striking resemblance to the Phantom character, and he delivered one of his best performances. Columbia filmed a sequel to The Phantom more than a decade later, but the studio's rights to the Phantom property had lapsed. Producer Sam Katzman was forced to film new scenes with hero John Hart, wearing a new costume that resembled the Phantom only vaguely. The patchwork was released as The Adventures of Captain Africa (1955), and footage of Tyler's Phantom appears in some of the long shots. Later years In 1943, the forty-year-old Tyler was diagnosed with severe rheumatoid arthritis. He was physically limited to occasional supporting roles in Western films, including San Antonio (1945) with Errol Flynn; They Were Expendable (1945), Red River (1948), and She Wore a Yellow Ribbon (1949) with John Wayne; Badman's Territory (1946) with Randolph Scott; Masked Raiders (1949), Riders of the Range (1950), Rio Grande Patrol (1951), and Road Agent (1952) with Tim Holt; West of the Brazos (1950) and several other films with James Ellison; Trail of Robin Hood (1950) with Roy Rogers; and Best of the Badmen (1951) with Robert Ryan. Tyler was one of John Ford Stock Company appearing in six of the director's films. Beginning in 1950, Tyler transitioned to television work, finding minor roles on The Lone Ranger (1950), Dick Tracy (1950), The Cisco Kid (1950‚Äì1951), The Range Rider (1951‚Äì1952), and The Roy Rogers Show (1952). His final television appearances were in four episodes of The Gene Autry Show in 1952 and 1953. The last screen appearance by Tom Tyler was playing a \\"District Marshal\\" on the television series Steve Donovan, Western Marshal. The episode called \\"Comanche Kid\\" premiered on January 14, 1956, but had been filmed as a pilot in 1950. In it, Tyler had difficulty drawing his gun because of his arthritis. Marriage Tyler married actress Jeanne Martel in September 1937; they met the previous year while filming Santa Fe Bound in which she was his leading lady. They appeared in two other films together in 1937, Lost Ranch and Orphan of the Pecos. She most likely accompanied him on the road with the Wallace Brothers Circus in 1938. According to a United States census, they were still married in May 1940, but most likely separated and divorced soon after.

Goetz was born in K√∂nigsberg, which was then part of East Prussia. After studying in Berlin, he moved to Switzerland in 1863. After ten years spent as a critic, pianist and conductor as well, he spent the last three years of his life composing. The conductor Felix Weingartner found it \\"incomprehensible that his delightful opera comique, Der Widerspenstigen Z√§hmung, should have entirely disappeared from the repertoire.\\"Felix Weingartner. The Symphony Writers Since Beethoven, 2nd ed., translated from German by Arthur Bles (London: William Reeves Bookseller Limited, 1963), pp. 68-69. Goetz is consistently identified as \\"Hermann G√∂tz\\". (Similarly, Bruckner is referred to as \\"Anton Br√ºckner\\".) Another great admirer of Goetz's compositions was George Bernard Shaw, who praised Goetz's Symphony in F above anything in the genre by Mendelssohn, Schumann, and Brahms. Life Goetz, the son of a salesman, came into contact with music early in his life. However, he did not receive his first serious piano lesson until 1857 ‚Äî although he already had begun to compose some years before. At the end of the 1850s, he began to study for a degree in mathematics, but broke this off after three terms to study at the Stern conservatory in Berlin, where he studied piano and composition with Hans von B√ºlow. In 1862 he successfully graduated from the conservatory. The following year, Goetz was appointed as city organist of Winterthur in Switzerland (thanks to the assistance of Carl Reinecke), where he taught the piano and began to make his name as a composer. In 1868 he married, and two years later moved to the village of Hottingen, today a suburb of Zurich, but remained employed in Winterthur until 1872. Between 1870 and 1874, he wrote reviews for a music magazine. In the last years of his life, Goetz had to withdraw from teaching and concert performance due to the increasing seriousness of his tuberculosis, from which he had suffered from the 1850s and from which he would eventually die, aged 35, at Hottingen. Style Although Goetz showed active interest in the important artistic trends of his own time (on the one hand Liszt and Wagner, on the other Brahms), his own compositional style was more influenced by Mozart and Mendelssohn, and to a lesser degree by Schumann. Goetz's music is defined by lyricism and great clarity, and in general terms can be defined as quiet and introverted. Goetz almost completely avoided spectacular effects. Great mastery of compositional technique is characteristic of Goetz's style, which is particularly apparent in the connectedness of motifs and the technical depth of movements. Goetz was no radical forger of new musical paths, but rather a composer in total control of his compositional technique. For a long time, he was almost forgotten, although Gustav Mahler performed a number of his works; only since the 1990s have his works been revived. Works =Description= Goetz's compositions include a symphony, two piano concertos, a violin concerto in one movement, much piano music, a piano trio, piano quartet, piano quintet, and sonata for piano four-hands (two players). There are also two operas, Der Widerspenstigen Z√§hmung (based on Shakespeare's The Taming of the Shrew) and, much less successful, the three-act opera Francesca da Rimini, to a libretto by the composer and Joseph Victor Wildmann, based on Dante's Inferno (premiered at Mannheim, September 30, 1877).Entry for Francesca von Rimini by Goetz, Casaglia's almanac =Listing= *Operas ** Der Widerspenstigen Z√§hmung, opera, (1868‚Äì73) ** Francesca von Rimini, incomplete opera, (1875‚Äì77, overture and act 3 completed by Ernst Frank) * Vocal works ** Psalm 137 for soprano, choir and orchestra Op. 14 (1864) ** Nenie (a poem by Friedrich Schiller) for choir and orchestra Opus 10 (1874) ** Songs ** Choral anthems * Orchestral pieces ** Symphony in E minor (1866, only fragments survive) ** Symphony in F major Op. 9 (1873) ** Spring Overture Op. 15 (1864) ** Piano Concerto No. 1 in E-flat major (1861) ** Piano Concerto No. 2 in B-flat major Op. 18 (1867) ** Sketches of a third piano concerto in D major ** Violin Concerto in G major Op. 22 (1868) * Chamber music ** Piano trio in G minor Op. 1 (1863) ** Three Light Pieces for violin and piano (1863) ** String quartet in B major (1865‚Äì66) ** Piano quartet in E major Op. 6 (1867) ** Piano quintet in C minor Op.16 (1874) * Piano music ** 2 Sonatinos (F major, E flat major) Op. 8 (1871) ** Lose Bl√§tter (Loose Sheets) Op. 7 (1864‚Äì69) ** Genrebilder (Genre Paintings) Op. 13 (1870‚Äì76) ** Four handed sonata for piano in D major (from 1855) ** Four handed sonata for piano in G minor Op. 17 (1865) Discography * Hermann Goetz and Heinrich Schulz-Beuthen, Piano Music, Kirsten Johnson, piano, Guild GMCD 7282; includes Goetz' Lose Bl√§tter, op. 7, and Genrebilder, op. 13. * Hermann Goetz Orchestral Works and Concertos: Volker Banfield (piano), Gottfried Schneider (violin), Stephanie Stiller (soprano), NDR Chor, Radio-Philharmonie Hannover des NDR / Werner Andreas Albert (conductor) - cpo 999939-2 (3 CDs) Further reading * Eduard Kreuzhage, Hermann Goetz: Sein Leben und seine Werke, Leipzig 1916 (in German).

He debuted in Prime #1 under Malibu Comics' Ultraverse imprint, and was one of its flagship characters along with Mantra and Hardcase The Superhero Book: The Ultimate Encyclopedia of Comic-Book Icons and Hollywood Heroes, Gina Misiroglu (2012), p. 377.. The character design was credited to Bret Blevins. The character also appeared in the superhero group Ultraforce. Prime is really a thirteen-year-old boy named Kevin Green with the power to transform into a super-powered adult. In this sense, he is very similar to the Golden Age Captain Marvel. And much like the Modern Age version of Captain Marvel, Kevin retains the thoughts, memories and consciousness of his thirteen-year-old self as Prime. This is a chief source of conflict for the character as he is frequently placed in adult situations and circumstances he may not be mature enough to deal with. Publication history Prime made his first appearance in Prime #1, dated June 1993, written by Gerard Jones and Len Strazewski and illustrated by Norm Breyfogle. As part of the Ultraverse imprint, the comic was set within a shared universe of super-powered beings conceptualized by Mike Barr, Steve Englehart, Steve Gerber, James Hudnall, Gerard Jones, Larry Niven, James Robinson, and Len Strazewski. Image Comics, a line of creator-owned comics that had record-breaking sales figures, had a publishing deal with Malibu that had ended shortly before. Writers Jones and Strazewski used the book to explore a number of themes, such as the place of role models in establishing personal definitions of heroism, as well as touchy matters regarding sexuality and pedophilia. Artist Breyfogle set the definitive visual tone of Prime. His style was marked by the use of interconnected panels with spilled margins and broken borders, as well as frequent use of speed lines and other hyperkinetic emphasis effects. Breyfogle's depiction of Prime was also distinctive for stark lighting, over- rendered musculature, and a dark approach to gore. Breyfogle departed as regular artist after issue 12. Among the artists who made up for Breyfogle's departure were George P√©rez, Darick Robertson, and John Statema. Marvel Comics purchased Malibu in 1994. In 1995, Marvel characters began crossing over into the Ultraverse, beginning with the appearance of Thor and Loki in Godwheel ‚Äî a crossover that revealed many of the elements that Larry Niven had written into the Ultraverse creators' bible. As time passed, these incursions became more frequent, culminating in 1995, with the event known as \\"Black September.\\" This crossover effectively gave Marvel the license to rewrite many of the Ultraverse books' core concepts. Character history =Rise as Ultrahero= Prime began his heroic activities attacking a gym teacher that was molesting Kellly, one of his classmates and his crush. Next he attacked a drug dealer and terrorist from Somalia.Prime(1993) vol.1 # 1 A scientist name Dr. Gross began the search of Prime and captured him with help of his minion Duey.Prime(1993) vol.1 #2 . Dr. Gross reveals to Prime that he intervened in his creation, when he modified some babies years before as part of a government program. Prime become enraged by the revelation and fled.Prime(1993) vol.1 #3 Full of doubts, Prime tried to meet his idol Hardcase, and went to Hollywood to search for him. However he ended meeting Prototype, a ultra that acted as spokesperson for Ultratech. The two young heroes didn't get along and fought. Prime proved stronger but caused a fire and fled.Prime(1993) vol.1 #4 . Later, Prime fought a demon that took the form a cartoon character Prime(1993) vol.1 #5 , and was recruited by the U.S. government for a special mission in the Moon. He meet Colonel Samuels, that tried to use Prime as a weapon. He experimented in Prime's body, transforming it in a space resistant versionPrime(1993) vol.1 #6 . =Break Thru= Prime was ordered to travel to the moon and when he arrive he saw figures of his parents and his crush Kelly trying to control him. Prime finally was convince to protect the mysterious entity of the moonPrime(1993) vol.1 #7 . Various ultras (Hardcase,Choice, Mantra (comics),Prototype, The Strangers and The Solution arrived to the moon in the search of the entity. minions of the villain Rex Mundi arrived too and fought Prime. Prime almost lost conscience in middle of the battle, but was rescued by Mantra. All the Ultraheroes discovered the source of the \\"Jumpstart Effect\\" which has been granting people powers all across Earth. Alongside other ultraheroes, Prime protected the Entity, a crashed alien starship that was causing the Jumpstart Effect, from attack fom Mundi's minions. It is soon allowed to return home.Break-Thru#1-2 (1993) =Ultraforce= Later Prime formed part of Ultraforce and fought the subterrain warlord Attalon Ultraforce(1994) vol.1 #0-6 . When Hardcase was being defeated by N.M.E., Prime arrived to save the hero and destroyed the mechanic menace. Shortly after, Prime was attacked by the serial killer Rafferty. =Black September= In the crossover with the Avengers, Prime battled Thor (comics). He also meet the Hulk and Captain America. Kevin was lost in the Marvel Universe, and befriended Spiderman. He transformed brieftly in a spider-theme Prime called Spider-Prime. Powers and abilities Kevin transforms into Prime by projecting an organic 'liquid flesh' material from his torso. The liquid flesh then shapes itself into a tall man with exceptionally large and defined muscular development. Prime can revert to his teenage form by destabilizing the outer body into a mess of protein goo, either consciously or when his Prime-body's energy reserves run out. When this happens, Kevin must pull himself out of the body's remains or risk suffocating from lack of oxygen. As Prime, Kevin possesses tremendous strength with unknown limits and once lifted an entire outdoor gym with relative ease. His resistance to physical injury is also exceptionally high, having survived a close proximity explosion of several nuclear warheads. Prime can also fly at Mach-level of velocity. Although all of Prime's powers are modelled after traditional superhero powers, these limitations are defined mostly by Kevin's subconscious aspirations. In fact, it is frequently suggested that the appearance of the Prime-body is formed mostly by Kevin's subconscious. Many of the features of the Prime-body are taken from Kevin's role models such as action stars and comic book superheroes. Another Ultraverse character who shares a similar origin, Elven, is a fan of Elfquest comics and creates a body for herself that is a mishmash of various Tolkienesque fantasy elements. The face of Prime also bears a striking resemblance to Kevin's own father, Russell Green. In effect the Prime-body reflects Kevin's own attitudes towards heroism at any given moment. As such, Prime's physical appearance has changed numerous times. Common elements exist among the different Prime-bodies though, such as a stylized 'P' resting somewhere on his chest or cape and some metallic adornment such as chains or gauntlets. Some of his forms include: *First Prime - A Prime-body obviously inspired by comic book superheroes, as well as local bodybuilders from Kevin's home state. As the first Prime-body, it defines the visual template for the other Prime-bodies. The body possesses extremely developed muscles and prominent veins. The costume is made up of a large red cape, red pants, gold gauntlets, calfguards and chestplate and features the trademark stylized 'P' on both the cape and the chestplate. *Space Prime - A Prime-body meant to withstand to harsh conditions of outer space. This design was force fed into Kevin's subconscious by military scientists working for Colonel Samuels. The epidermal layer has been transformed into a hardened shell resembling some kind of metallic alloy, designed to prevent the body from expanding in the vacuum of space. A set of air-tanks exist in the subdermal layer. The gold gauntlets, calfguard and chestplate remain as well as the 'P' insignia on his chest, but the cape is absent (in the Ultraforce cartoon, it was Contrary who suggested to him changing form). *Rogue Prime - A Prime-body inspired by rugged individualistic heroes such as the gun-toting antihero Firearm. The body also sports a series of gold chains around the waist, and a set of spiked armbands and headgear. Tattoos and piercings are also notable, as well as a scar on the right eye. The color scheme is radically different, with the 'P' insignia being black on gold, and the vest being dark blue rather than gold and leather gloves replace the gauntlets. In the Ultraforce animated series, Rogue Prime is created when Kevin falls under mind control, as well as from his inner doubts. *Final Prime - A Prime-body that reconciles the values of Rogue Prime with the inspirations of the First Prime. The visual appearance is closer to that of the First Prime than the Rogue Prime --- cape, gauntlets and all --- but sections of the cape and pants mix blue and red. Hints of the Rogue Prime exist in the form of tattoos, albeit much fewer in number than in the Rogue Prime. There is a slight amount of arm-hair, also a residual element from the Rogue Prime. *Spider-Prime - A Prime-body inspired in part by Spider-Man. When Kevin was trapped in the Marvel Universe, he only had half of his power. When he tried to become \\"primed up,\\" he became a mass of slime and unable to control himself. When he tried to help Spider-Man fight the Lizard, he changed into Spider-Prime. This form was a smaller version of Prime with a face mask and gave him six arms. Kevin transformed twice more into a variant version of Spider-Prime, however this body he claimed was 'not Spider-Man's anymore', indicating that somehow the first Spider-Prime may have been a direct imprint on Spider-Man. The second Spider-Prime, like the first, had a red and blue color-scheme much like Spider-Man, along with a mask with red around the eyes, but it also included gauntlets and a massive golden spider on the chest, along with boots to match the gauntlets. The second Spider-Prime had no extra arms except for a singular use in battle with the primary Prime body, which was a one time thing. Both of the second Spider-Prime transformations enabled Kevin to use webbing. Supporting cast, allies and enemies *Kelly Cantrell - One of Kevin's classmates with a self-proclaimed irrational crush on Prime. She babysits Gus and Evie Blake who are the children of Mantra. Prime has frequently saved Kelly's life and once declared her as his girlfriend. The apparent age difference between Kelly and a hero who appears to be thirty years old makes this problematic. *Russell Green - Kevin's father. A former military officer who worked directly under Colonel Samuels. He resigned his commission to become an engineer. When he and his wife had trouble conceiving, he volunteered to become a part of Samuels' fertility research program. When he discovered Kevin's identity as Prime, he contacted Samuels, but later went on to pursue an undercover crusade against the military branch that Samuels worked for. *Colonel Samuels - an ambitious military officer, Colonel Samuels was directly responsible for many dirty secrets in the military. Chief among them was the fertility research program headed by Doc Gross that created Prime, as well as Elven. Samuels attempted to use a combination of blackmail and media manipulation to coerce Kevin/Prime into using his powers to further his own ends. When Prime attempted to blow the cover on his black ops, Samuels committed suicide. *Doc Gross - The head researcher of the fertility research program that created Prime. Due to unethical nature of his research, Gross had to destroy much of his files and research notes when a government crackdown was imminent. He attempted to capture Prime for further experimentation but this encounter nearly resulted in his death. A mysterious treatment 'vat' gave him a similar superbody but requires several treatments to remain stable. His current agenda is to breed new ultrahumans like Prime. *Primevil - A reanimated discarded Prime body, this nearly mindless creature encountered Prime once, attempting to absorb him and take his power. Possibility of revival In 2003, Steve Englehart was commissioned by Marvel to relaunch the Ultraverse with the most recognizable characters,including Prime, but the editorial decided finally not to resurrect the imprint.Cronin ,Brian. (April 15, 2017) [\\"https://www.cbr.com/ultraverse-marvel-relaunch-steve-englehart/\\"] CBR.com Englehart Steve . . In June 2005, when asked by Newsarama whether Marvel had any plans to revive the Ultraverse, Marvel editor-in-chief Joe Quesada replied that: :Let's just say that I wanted to bring these characters back in a very big way, but the way that the deal was initially structured, it's next to impossible to go back and publish these books. :There are rumors out there that it has to do with a certain percentage of sales that has to be doled out to the creative teams. While this is a logistical nightmare because of the way the initial deal was structured, it's not the reason why we have chosen not to go near these characters, there is a bigger one, but I really don't feel like it‚Äôs my place to make that dirty laundry public. Appearances in other media Prime was a recurring character in the short-lived Ultraforce cartoon show, where Hardcase acts as his mentor (as he is the only one in the team who knows that Prime is a teenager), and he constantly bickers with Prototype, usually insulting Prototype because his lack of super powers. Prime's team faces off with other Ultraverse villains such as Rune and Lord Pumpkin. Prime is voiced by Michael Donovan, and Prime's alter ego, Kevin Green, is voiced by Amos Crawley. Prime was one of the action figures produced for Galoob's Ultraforce line. Prime also starred in a Sega CD disc published by Sony Imagesoft bundled with Psygnosis' Microcosm video game. Though marketed as a video game, Ultraverse Prime is actually a multimedia CD which includes digital copies of 12 issues of the Prime comic book, video interviews with Prime's creators, some concept art, and a beat 'em up game. The disc received a negative review from GamePro. A pastiche of Prime was included among the army of Supermen in Final Crisis #7. On October 8, 2002, Marvel Studios announced movie deals for Sub-Mariner and Prime with Universal Studios while Universal had the Hulk movie in post-production with a then-expected June 6 release date.

Hopp√©, 1913 Joseph Charles Holbrooke (5 July 18785 August 1958) was an English composer, conductor, and pianist. Life =Early years= Joseph Holbrooke was born Joseph Charles Holbrook in Croydon, Surrey.The family name was Holbrook according to the censuses for Scotland (1881) and England (1891 and 1901) His father, also named Joseph, was a music hall musician and teacher, and his mother Helen was a Scottish singer. He had two older sisters (Helen and Mary) and two younger brothers (Robert and James), both of whom died in infancy.The family were living in Edinburgh at the time of the 1881 census The family travelled around the country, with both parents participating in musical entertainments.Lowe, George: Josef Holbrooke and his work (London: Kegan Paul, 1920, p.2) Holbrooke's mother died in 1880 from tuberculosis,Lowe, George: Josef Holbrooke and his work (London: Kegan Paul, 1920, p.2) leaving the family in the care of Joseph senior, who settled the family in London and took the position of pianist at Collins' Music Hall, Islington, and later at the Bedford Music Hall. Holbrooke was taught to play the piano and the violin by his father,Lowe, George: Josef Holbrooke and his work (London: Kegan Paul, 1920, p.2) who was not averse to the use of violence as a method of instruction,McNaught, W.G: Josef Holbrooke The Musical Times, 1 April 1913, reprinted in Josef Holbrooke - Various appreciations by many authors (London: Rudall Carte, 1937, p.46)Dagg, Norman: Josef Holbrooke and his music, reprinted in Josef Holbrooke - Various appreciations by many authors (London: Rudall Carte, 1937, p.112) and played in music halls himself Lowe, George: Josef Holbrooke and his work (London: Kegan Paul, 1920, p.2) before entering the Royal Academy of Music as a student in 1893, where he studied under Frederick Corder for composition and Frederick Westlake for piano. Whilst at the academy he composed several works, chiefly piano miniatures, songs and some chamber music, which were performed at student concerts:Lowe, George: Josef Holbrooke and his work (London: Kegan Paul, 1920, pp.4-6) at one recital, he substituted one of his own compositions in preference to Schumann's Toccata, incurring the wrath of the Principal, Sir Alexander Campbell Mackenzie.Lowe, George: Josef Holbrooke and his work (London: Kegan Paul, 1920, p.5) Whilst at the Royal Academy, Holbrooke won several prizes including the Potter Exhibition for pianoforte (1895),The Prize Board at the Royal Academy of Music gives the date 1895 and the composer's name as Joseph C. Holbrook the Sterndale Bennett Scholarship (awarded on 29 April 1896),The Musical Courier 14 May 1896, p.9 the Heathcote Long Prize for pianoforte (1896)The Prize Board at the Royal Academy of Music gives the date 1896 and the composer's name as Joseph Holbrook and, in his final year (with the Pantomime Suite for strings), the Charles Lucas Prize for composition (1897).The Prize Board at the Royal Academy of Music gives the date 1897 and the composer's name as Joseph C. HolbrookLowe, George: Josef Holbrooke and his work (London: Kegan Paul, 1920, p.7) After leaving the Royal Academy Holbrooke sought a variety of occupations. In 1898 he undertook a tour of Scotland accompanying the music hall singer Arthur Lloyd,Wyndham, Henry Saxe: Who's Who in music (Boston: Small, Maynard & Co., 1913, p.107)Dagg, Norman: Josef Holbrooke and his music, reprinted in Josef Holbrooke - Various appreciations by many authors (London: Rudall Carte, 1937, p.113) but the venture failed and he was forced to return to live with his father in London.Lowe, George: Josef Holbrooke and his work (London: Kegan Paul, 1920, p.8) He then moved out of the family home to Harringay where he began to teach music privately, but once again without financial success.Lowe, George: Josef Holbrooke and his work (London: Kegan Paul, 1920, p.8) Around this time he decided to change his name from Holbrook to Holbrooke,The programme for the first performance of his orchestral poem The Raven at the Crystal Palace, London, on 3 March 1900 gives the composer's name as Joseph C. HolbrookeEngland 1911 census probably in order to avoid confusion as his father was also still teaching privately. He subsequently adopted the variant Josef Holbrooke which he continued to use inconsistently throughout the remainder of his life. Responding to an advertisement in Musical News, Holbrooke travelled to Horncastle in Lincolnshire where he briefly lived with and served as musical companion to the Reverend Edward Stewart Bengough (1839-1920).Lowe, George: Josef Holbrooke and his work (London: Kegan Paul, 1920, pp.8-9)Dagg, Norman: Josef Holbrooke and his music, reprinted in Josef Holbrooke - Various appreciations by many authors (London: Rudall Carte, 1937, p.114) He was soon travelling again, conducting a touring pantomime (Aladdin and the Lamp) during the 1899-1900 Christmas season. Once more, however, the enterprise collapsed and Holbrooke was left stranded and virtually destitute, at which point Bengough sent him money to enable him to return to London.Lowe, George: Josef Holbrooke and his work (London: Kegan Paul, 1920, p.9)Dagg, Norman: Josef Holbrooke and his music, reprinted in Josef Holbrooke - Various appreciations by many authors (London: Rudall Carte, 1937, p.115) =Success= Whilst on tour, Holbrooke had sent the score of his orchestral poem The Raven to August Manns, conductor at the Crystal Palace. Manns accepted the work for performance and gave the premiere on 3 March 1900, whilst later that same year the orchestral variations on Three Blind Mice were also heard (Queen's Hall Promenade Concert, conducted by Henry Wood, 8 November 1900). In 1901 he won the Lesley Alexander Prize for chamber music with his Sextet in F minor and also received an invitation from Granville Bantock to become a member of the staff at the Birmingham and Midland Institute School of Music. He accepted the position, living with the Bantocks whilst teaching at the institution,Anderton, H. Orsmond: The Troll-Piper (Musical Opinion), reprinted in Josef Holbrooke - Various appreciations by many authors (London: Rudall Carte, 1937, p.62) but rapidly became dissatisfied with the routine and returned to London in 1902.Anderton, H. Orsmond: The Troll-Piper (Musical Opinion), reprinted in Josef Holbrooke - Various appreciations by many authors (London: Rudall Carte, 1937, p.64) There then followed a decade of prestigious commissions and performances, with notable works including the poem for chorus and orchestra Queen Mab (Leeds Festival, conducted by the composer, 6 October 1904), the orchestral poem Ulalume (Queen's Hall, conducted by the composer, 26 November 1904), the scena for baritone and orchestra Marino Faliero (Bristol Festival, conducted by the composer, 12 October 1905), the Bohemian Songs for baritone and orchestra (Norwich Festival, conducted by the composer, 25 October 1905), the poem for chorus and orchestra The Bells (Birmingham Festival, conducted by Hans Richter, 3 October 1906), the orchestral suite Les Hommages (Queen's Hall Promenade Concert, conducted by Henry Wood, 25 October 1906) and the choral symphony Homage to E.A. Poe (two movements first performed at the Bristol Festival, 16 October 1908). During this period Holbrooke also won a further prize, this time with his Fantasie Quartet, Op.17b entered for the 1905 chamber music competition initiated by Walter Willson Cobbett.Out of sixty- seven entrants, the first prize was awarded to William Hurlstone, the second to Frank Bridge and the third to Haydn Wood. Subsidiary prizes were awarded to Holbrooke, Harry Waldo Warner (1874-1945) and James Friskin (1886-1967) In 1907 Holbrooke was approached by the poet Herbert Trench who wished the composer to set his extended poem on immortality Apollo and the Seaman.Lowe, George: Josef Holbrooke and his work (London: Kegan Paul, 1920, p.20) This Holbrooke duly did, although only the final section of the poem (The Embarkation) is actually sung (by a male chorus), the rest of the score being a purely orchestral illustration of the verses. The completed work, styled \\"An Illuminated Symphony\\", was first performed at Queen's Hall on 20 January 1908, conducted by Thomas Beecham: on this occasion the orchestra and chorus were hidden from the audience behind an elaborate screen whilst the text of the poem was projected onto the screen using lantern slides at corresponding points in the music.Lowe, George: Josef Holbrooke and his work (London: Kegan Paul, 1920, p.21) The rehearsals for Apollo and the Seaman were attended by Thomas Scott-Ellis, 8th Baron Howard de Walden who shortly after the first performance approached Holbrooke with one of his own poems, entitled Dylan - Son of the Wave:Baughan, G: How Josef Holbrooke wrote \\"Dylan\\" (reproduced in Josef Holbrooke - Various appreciations by many authors (London: Rudall Carte, 1937, p.74) this resulted in the composition of the opera Dylan, first performed at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane, London, conducted by Artur Nikisch, on 4 July 1914. The staging included another technological wonder: :\\"in this work, in order to get convincing flights of wild fowl, films were made in the Outer Hebrides and projected on to the stage. This, of course, was in the days of the silent film, when there was no means of deadening the whirr or hum of the projector and the films themselves resolved into a series of flicks. The scoring, however, was vivid enough to cover the sounds, and this incipient film music was infinitely more successful than some of the over- vaunted high-level scores heard to-day. The theatre, however, was not ready for such an innovation, and the extra-musical effects were not taken seriously.\\"Demuth, Norman: Musical trends in the 20th century (London: Rockliff, 1952, pp.111-112) Collaboration on two further operas, The Children of Don (first performed at the London Opera House, conducted by Arthur Nikisch, on 15 June 1912 - postponed from 12 June) and Bronwen, brought about the completion of Holbrooke's most ambitious project, a trilogy under the collective title The Cauldron of Annwn setting Scott-Ellis' versions of tales from the Welsh Mabinogion. Until his death in 1946, Scott-Ellis effectively acted as patron to Holbrooke, subsidising performances and publication of many of his works.Swaffer, Hannen: Josef Holbrooke (The Graphic, 1922, reprinted in Josef Holbrooke - Various appreciations by many authors (London: Rudall Carte, 1937, pp.19-24) Throughout this period, Holbrooke also enjoyed a successful career as a virtuoso concert pianist. Besides his own compositions, his repertoire included the Toccata by Robert Schumann, Islamey by Mily Balakirev, Scriabin's Piano Sonata No.1, the fantasie Africa for piano and orchestra by Saint-Sa√´ns, Tchaikovsky's Piano Concerto No.1 and Rachmaninoff's Piano Concerto No.2.Holbrooke, Joseph: Josef Holbrooke as pianist (London: Modern Music Library, n.d. [c.1947])Lloyd, Stephen: Sir Dan Godfrey - champion of British composers (London: Thames Publishing, 1995, pp.58, 152) =Controversy= In 1902 Holbrooke had begun his own series of chamber music concerts to promote his music alongside new works by his British contemporaries. Audiences would regularly find admonishing notes printed in their programmes: :\\"Mr. JOSEF HOLBROOKE steps forward somewhat adventurously with his 12th year of endeavour for some Modern English Music to an apathetic public, and hopes to receive as few blows as possible (with the usual financial loss) in return.\\"Programme note for a Holbrooke concert given at the Aeolian Hall, London, 31 January 1913 :\\"While our good English musicians in power with fine orchestras and much money are pummelling to their utmost ability the down-trodden and unrecognised gifts (!) of Richard Strauss and his brethren abroad, we, in our small way, and where we can, try to leaven matters by writing out cheques and playing our own music to recalcitrant audiences! It is to be regretted that the Reger Pianoforte Quintet announced for this concert was found so long and turgid that we had to put it aside, in case it met with the sad fate of serious English music. We have found a place for more interesting native work and saved Mr. Reger's reputation, which, with Mr. Strauss, is sacred in this country.\\"Programme note for a Holbrooke concert given at the Aeolian Hall, London, 28 February 1913 When war broke out in 1914 he turned his attention to vigorously denouncing both the lack of support given to British music and the continued favour afforded to that of other countries, especially Germany. He published a series of five essays entitled British Music Versus German Music which appeared weekly in The New Age between 5 November and 3 December 1914: :\\"The British people have ever listened to the alien, as in the days of Handel, and the critic (although not a villain!) is always ready with his enthusiasm, in large type, for Tetrazzini, Caruso, Busoni, Strauss, Puccini, Nikisch, Campanini, Van Rooy, Stravinski, Chaliapine, Debussy, Pavlova, Karsavina, Nijinski, Mengelberg, Steinbach, Sch√∂nberg, Savonoff, Paderewski, Elman, and a few other aliens! These are the 'gods' I am mentioning, the gods of the British people.\\"Holbrooke, Joseph: British music versus German music, part 2 (The New Age, XVI(2), 12 November 1914, p.36) :\\"In a recent disclosing [...] I gave actual instances of the orchestras I had personally given concerts with in London, costing me many hundreds of pounds. My sole reward for this is to find them, the orchestras I engaged, united in ignoring, year after year, my works, until, I imagine, more money is forthcoming to spend on more performances!\\"Holbrooke, Joseph: British music versus German music, part 3 (The New Age, XVI(3), 19 November 1914, p.68) :\\"the despicable members of the music profession are encouraged to play German music by an absolutely indifferent audience. One wonders if any of such people have lost their sons or husbands at the front, or is it that the bulk of our music lovers 'do not fight.'\\"Holbrooke, Joseph: British music versus German music, part 4 (The New Age, XVI(4), 26 November 1914, p.102) The personal tone which informed much of the writing was too strong for some commentators who saw it as blatant self-promotion: :\\"I may be forgiven for reading between his lines. I am tempted to think that Mr. Holbrooke is only discussing his own grievances against the English public, and that the real heading of his articles should be 'Holbrooke's v. German or any other music.'\\"Clutsam, George: Letter to the editor (The New Age, XVI(4), 26 November 1914, p.110) :\\"It is a little depressing to watch Mr. Holbrooke endeavouring, week after week, to precipitate Music into the dismal cesspool of Chauvinism that is already full to overflowing. [...] Mr. Holbrooke's position is analogous to that of the street-minstrel. It is as though the penny-whistler on the kerbstone were suddenly to belabour with his instrument all the passers-by who did not instantly lose the purpose of their passing-by in a passion of wonder and ecstasy at the sound of his piping. [...] Not all British composers have yet sunk into the mire of sordid commercialism, wherein Mr. Holbrooke would have them fellow-wallowers with himself, nor are they all intoxicated with those quixotic notions of nationalism that have caused Mr. Holbrooke to waste so much breath in spluttering invective against a public that persists in believing that Art is one, and life too short for futile arguments about its nationality.\\"Heseltine, Philip: Letter to the editor (The New Age, XVI(5), 3 December 1914, p.134) The fact that Holbrooke had recently issued a number of worksThe ballets The Moth and the Flame, Op.62, and The Red Masque, Op.65, the Grand Prelude and Fugue for organ, Op.63, and the Four Futurist Dances for piano, Op.66, all published by Chester & Co. under a pseudonym was also seized upon and viewed with suspicion: :\\"I should like to ask Mr. Holbrooke to explain why, for all his patriotism, he has recently thought fit to publish several of his works under the name of Jean Hanze, and, in addition, to circulate a pamphlet puffing their soi-disant BELGIAN COMPOSER! - at this time, of all others, when the word 'Belgian' acts as a kind of magic formula for opening purses! One is reminded of the pavement artist who stuffed his legs through a hole in the wall, and posed as a hero who had given his legs for his country. He got several months.\\"Heseltine, Philip: Letter to the editor (The New Age, XVI(5), 3 December 1914, p.135) Undoubtedly, Holbrooke was a difficult and prickly person to deal with professionally. Shortly before a concert in Bournemouth on 22 February 1917, where the composer was to give a performance of his piano concerto Gwyn ap Nudd, the conductor Dan Godfrey was compelled to hastily insert apology slips into each of the programmes to the following effect: :\\"Mr Dan Godfrey begs to announce that Mr Joseph Holbrooke declines to play today, at this concert, because his name is not announced on the bills in large enough type, consequently the programme will be changed. The Piano Concerto and Dreamland Suite will be substituted by Violin Concerto, Paganini (H E Batten) Sc√®nes Pittoresques, Massenet.\\"Lloyd, Stephen: Sir Dan Godfrey - champion of British composers (London: Thames Publishing, 1995, p.152) In fact, what had annoyed Holbrooke was the greater prominence which the printed advertisements gave to Vladimir Pachmann who was due to play two days later: he felt that this was yet another instance where a foreigner was being given undue celebrity to the detriment of a native pianist.Godfrey, Dan: Memories and music - thirty-five years of conducting (London: Hutchinson, 1924, pp.246-247) Such outbursts of pique were characteristic and he gained the reputation of a troublesome and cantankerous eccentric: :\\"Holbrooke's personality has also been largely responsible for the amount of opposition that he has received. He is not a man of reticences, and what his heart feels, his tongue speaks without any arri√®re pens√©e. He is fond of talking, and nobody talks much who does not say unwise things at times. Being impulsive by nature and very open in character, he is apt to commit indiscretions which he afterwards regrets. He is his own worst enemy, and is well aware of the fact.\\"Lowe, George: Josef Holbrooke and his work (London: Kegan Paul, 1920, p.36) :\\"Josef Holbrooke, an excitable, deaf, talkative, combative musician, who lives in a solitary house in North London surrounded by ordinary Villadom, and writes there music which no one can play. It is music Wagner-like in form and Strauss-like in its intricate orchestration, almost unrecognised, except in foreign Culturedom. And Holbrooke, who composes it, is the enemy of the critics, the terror of publishers, and the intolerant hater of all that is commonplace in music. 'Holbrooke's Sauce,' they call him.\\"Swaffer, Hannen: Josef Holbrooke (The Graphic, 1922), reprinted in Josef Holbrooke - Various appreciations by many authors (London: Rudall Carte, 1937, pp.19-24) =Neglect= Following the First World War, with his own music increasingly side-lined,Banister, Hugh: Preface to Josef Holbrooke - Various appreciations by many authors (London: Rudall Carte, 1937) Holbrooke continued ever more vehemently to berate his critics.The futility of \\"criticism\\": a selection of strong 'opinions' is here given to the public on the works of Joseph Holbrooke (London: Goodwin & Tabb, n.d. [c.1922]) A particular target was Ernest Newman, initially an enthusiast for Holbrooke's music but who latterly became cool towards the composer: :\\"Men of note with verbal haemorrhage write on music mostly in our daily journals. [...] What their training is for their task is not known. In any case all this writing is entirely a trade issue, for what journalism has to do with the arts is best left to the reader's judgment and imagination. Mr Ernest Newman wrote an illuminating and heart-warming set of articles years ago on our composers in The Speaker, but he now publicly repudiates his early enthusiasm!\\"Holbrooke, Joseph: Contemporary British composers (London: Cecil Palmer, 1925, pp.7-8) However, at the same time, Holbrooke continued to vigorously and vociferously promote compositions by other contemporary British composers both through performance at his own chamber music concertsA list of some of the chamber music given by Joseph Holbrooke in London and the Provinces, from 1903-1931, with the artists he engaged (London: The Holbrooke Society, n.d. [c.1939]) and in print:Holbrooke, Joseph: Contemporary British composers (London: Cecil Palmer, 1925) :\\"At a time when little notice was taken of British composers, Holbrooke was cudgelling, even bludgeoning, in the English press and at his concerts (for he has always been fond - perhaps too fond - of prefaces oral and printed) at the apathy of the English public and the denseness of newspaper critics. He has suffered for his own sayings and vicariously for those of others; but whether we have liked his savage method of fighting or not, the battle has been won, and we must not forget those who were earliest in the field of modern British music.\\"Eaglefield Hull, Arthur: Miniature essays - Josef Holbrooke (London: J. & W. Chester, 1924, p.3) Perhaps Holbrooke found some satisfaction in seeing his war-time attitude towards greater British representation in concert-halls echoed retrospectively, albeit without the same controversy: :\\"Recognition for British music was won at the cost of thousands of lives and millions of money. [...] Truth to tell, we had become rather centred on the one thing and inclined to think that there was only one music, and that it came from Germany. This even continued at the beginning of the war. A protest on the part of a small section of the Press did much to draw people's attention to the fact that we were honouring an enemy nation. The counter cry was raised, of course, that \\"Music has no nationality\\" and all the rest of it; but there were a thinking few who realised the injustice. I doubt if the knowledge that at the beginning of the war the German papers reproduced London concert programmes, with their rich preponderance of German music, with the sneering remark that \\"we couldn't do without it\\" had much effect. It may have been that a few right-thinking people realised that we knew very little about anything save German music [and] the idea began to germinate that possibly somewhere, somehow, there might be something different. Gradually a little more British music was heard, gradually the public became accustomed to the strange sight of a British name on a concert programme, and gradually it dawned upon the people that there was something in it.\\"Godfrey, Dan: Memories and music - Thirty-five years of conducting (London: Hutchinson & Co., 1924, pp.137-138) Performances of his own music continued sporadically, but included several of great importance: The Children of Don (Die Kinder der Don) was given five times at the Vienna Volksoper under Felix Weingartner, and three times in Salzburg under Ludwig Kaiser (1876-1932), in 1923;Eaglefield Hull, Arthur: Miniature essays - Josef Holbrooke (London: J. & W. Chester, 1924, p.6) Bronwen was first performed in Huddersfield by The Carl Rosa Opera Company on 1 February 1929 and then taken on tour; and the ballet Aucassin and Nicolette was performed over two hundred times by the Markova-Dolin Ballet Company during the 1935-36 season. Holbrooke had spent extended periods of time at Harlech, Wales, since around 1915, Scott-Ellis having provided him with a number of residences, and in the early 1920s he moved with his family to a house which he appropriately named Dylan. In the early hours of 9 November 1928, whilst the rest of the family were in London, fire broke out and the house was completely gutted:Famous musician hurt in a fire - Josef Holbrooke's home destroyed (Daily Express, 9 November 1928) Holbrooke sustained serious head injuries and his music library was destroyed. This disaster precipitated a return to London where, having bought back many of the copyrights on his earlier works, Holbrooke set up his own publishing house \\"Modern Music Library\\", operating from his various London homes: through this outlet he ensured that his compositions remained available and also issued several printed catalogues of his works.Complete list of Holbrooke's published musical works (London: Modern Music Library, October 1941)Complete list of the musical works of Josef Holbrooke (London: Modern Music Library, 1952) From about the age of forty he began to suffer problems with his hearing,Swaffer, Hannen: Josef Holbrooke (The Graphic, 1922), reprinted in Josef Holbrooke - Various appreciations by many authors (London: Rudall Carte, 1937, pp.19-24) - Swaffer, writing in 1922, refers to Holbrooke as \\"an excitable, deaf, talkative, combative musician\\"Hurd, Michael: Rutland Boughton and the Glastonbury Festivals (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1993, p.191) - Boughton had asked Holbrooke to contribute financially towards a national opera scheme under the aegis of the British Music Society: Holbrooke replied, on 25 February 1931, \\"As for 'guineas' - I belong to no Society, and have no intention, now, of doing so. Regards from Holbrooke. I'm also too deaf to be interested.\\" eventually becoming profoundly deaf, an affliction which tended to increase his isolation and irascibility. The condition also served to curtail his career as a concert pianist: when Holbrooke revised his Piano Concerto The Song of Gwyn ap Nudd in 1923 it was for a performance given by Frederic Lamond. A \\"Holbrooke Music Society\\" was founded in 1931 to promote the composer's works, Scott-Ellis being the Patron and Granville Bantock acting as President. Until Bantock's death in 1946, Holbrooke maintained frequent correspondence with the older composer, railing against the BBC's apparent unwillingness to broadcast performances of his music.From correspondence with Granville Bantock held at the Cadbury Research Library, University of Birmingham, 1935-1939 (MS79/9), 1942-1943 (MS79/11) and 1944-45 (MS79/12) Despite his neglect by the musical establishment, Holbrooke continued to compose throughout the 1930s and 1940s, working on several large- scale projects including an opera-ballet Tamlane, two further choral symphonies, Blake and Milton,Complete list of Holbrooke's published musical works (London: Modern Music Library, October 1941) both of which were probably unfinished,Fitch, Donald: Blake set to music - a bibliography of musical settings of the poems and prose of William Blake (Berkeley, Los Angeles and Oxford: University of California Press, 1990, pp.104-105) and choral settings of Kipling's poetry, also unfinished.Brian, Havergal: Josef Holbrooke, English composer (Tomorrow, 4 November 1939, pp.31-32) reprinted in MacDonald, Malcolm: Havergal Brian on music volume 1 (London: Toccata Press, 1986, pp.280-285) He also devoted much of his time to revising and recasting his earlier works. Whilst resident in London, Holbrooke lived at various addresses including 22 Harringay Grove, Hornsey (c.1902-1910), Vale House, Tufnell Park (c.1910-c.1924), 60 Boundary Road, St John's Wood (c.1929-1937), 48 Boundary Road, St John's Wood (1937-1940), and 55 Alexandra Road, St John's Wood (1940-1958).From correspondence with Granville Bantock held at the Cadbury Research Library, University of Birmingham, 1900-1946 (MS79) Between September 1940 and March 1941, at the height of the Blitz, he moved out of London to live with friends in Taunton, Somerset, before returning to the capital permanently in the summer.From correspondence with Granville Bantock held at the Cadbury Research Library, University of Birmingham, 1940-1941 (MS79/10) He died at 55 Alexandra Road, St John's Wood, London, on 5 August 1958 at the age of eighty and was survived by his wife Dorothy ('Dot') Elizabeth Hadfield whom he had married in 1904. The couple had five children: Mildred (born 1905), Anton (1908), Barbara (1909), Gwydion (1912) and Diana (1915), the last of whom was married to the renowned clarinettist Reginald Kell. The youngest son changed his name to Gwydion Brooke and became a pre-eminent English bassoonist, also actively promoting the music of his father through a continuation of the \\"Modern Music Library\\", renamed \\"The Blenheim Press\\". Music Holbrooke was fascinated by the writings of Edgar Allan Poe which deal with the supernatural and the macabre, eventually producing over thirty compositions which he referred to as his \\"Poeana\\".List of Joseph Holbrooke's Poeana (London: Rudall Carte, 1937)Complete list of the musical works of Josef Holbrooke (London: Modern Music Library, 1952) These included orchestral works (The Raven, Ulalume, The Sleeper, Amontillado and The Pit and the Pendulum), a double concerto for clarinet and bassoon (Tamerlane), choral works (a choral symphony Homage to E.A. Poe and a poem for chorus and orchestra The Bells), a ballet (The Masque of the Red Death), a multitude of chamber works (such as the Clarinet Quintet Ligeia, the Trio Fairyland and the Nonet Irene) and several piano pieces. During the early 1920s he became interested in writing in the new jazz idiom: :\\"Quite recently Mr. Josef Holbrooke, one of our greatest living composers, announced his intention of writing jazz music. He complained in his usual forcible style of the lack of appreciation for his music and the music of his contemporaries, and he then proceeded to give us an idea of the \\"higher\\" jazz music which he intends to write.\\" Buckley, R.J: Mr Josef Holbrooke (Sunday Mercury, reprinted in Josef Holbrooke - Various appreciations by many authors (London: Rudall Carte, 1937, p.91) :\\"At the instigation of Mrs Holbrooke, who alleged he was getting old, he took up dancing a few months ago. He has now reached the stage where, on the slightest provocation he will demonstrate a step for anybody anywhere. 'I've got foxtrot on the brain', said Mr Holbrooke.\\" The Star, 27 November 1922 He produced several foxtrots and valses for dance orchestra Let's brighten Bognor, foxtrot; Let's brighten everything, valse; The Penguin's Walk, foxtrot; Toc H, valse; British Legion, valse; In Old Wales, foxtrot; Broken China, valse; Do It Now, foxtrot and, perhaps uniquely amongst prominent British composers, also composed and compiled suites of pieces for theatre orchestras to accompany silent films.Film Music Suite No.1, Op.84; Film Music Suite No.2, Op.91; Film Music Suite No.3, Op.93a He was also notably productive in writing original works for both brass band and military band.Symphony No.5, Wild Wales, for brass band and Symphony No.6, Old England, for military band Throughout his career he continually revised his compositions: titles were changed with an almost casual regularity (for instance, the opera Pierrot and Pierrette became The Stranger, the opera-ballet The Wizard became The Enchanter and the dramatic overture for brass band 1914 became Clive of India), many works were assigned several different opus numbers at different times, he borrowed music from one piece to another and recast works in different forms: for example, The Pit and the Pendulum draws its material from the opera-ballet The Enchanter, Symphony No.7 (Al Aaraaf) is a transcription for string orchestra of a String Sextet, The Masque of the Red Death which was originally another orchestral poem became a ballet, and what was illustrative of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's The Skeleton in Armour was seemingly also a close depiction of Byron's The Corsair, whilst several different versions of his orchestral variations on Auld Lang Syne exist with a number of the supposed 'musical portraits' apparently applicable simultaneously to different contemporaries.The full score, though published later, is dated 1906. Between the premieres of the orchestral version (8 May 1916) and the piano version (23 March 1918), variation 5 changed from W.W. (William Wallace) in the printed full score to V.W. (Vaughan Williams) in the piano score, variation 16 from C.S. (Cyril Scott) in the printed full score to C.D. (Claude Debussy) in the piano score and variation 19 from J.I. (John Ireland) in the printed full score to J.H.F. (John Herbert Foulds) in the piano score Larger scores, particularly the operas in the Cauldron of Annwn trilogy,Derivative works include: Dylan, fantasie, Op.53a; The Wild Fowl, fantasie, Op.56b; Hymn to Caridwen, Op.75b; Caradoc's Dream, Op.75c; The Birds of Rhiannon, Op.87; Don, fantasie for brass band, Op.127 were also quarried to produce a variety of subsidiary works. Trios became quartets, quintets became sextets, chamber works and piano suites were augmented with additional movements only to be subsequently contracted by the removal of others, pieces for clarinet and piano were arranged for brass band and works which figure prominently in early promotional catalogues subsequently vanish from later ones:Musical works by Josef Holbrooke 1895-1904 (Leipzig and London: Breitkopf & H√§rtel, 1904)Complete list of the musical works of Josef Holbrooke (London: Modern Music Library, 1952) :\\"I cannot steady myself in the case of Holbrooke by copying a list of compositions because the list now would run from page to page, dates and serial opus numbers clashing, chronology all askew.\\" Grew, Sydney: Our favourite musicians, from Stanford to Holbrooke (Edinburgh and London: Foulis, 1922) =Style= Holbrooke was a late-Romantic composer, writing in a predominantly tonal, though richly chromatic, idiom. His style was essentially eclectic: whilst the early chamber works echo the language and methods of Brahms and Dvo≈ô√°k, there is also an exuberance informed by his affection for the music of Tchaikovsky: :\\"Perhaps Tchaikovsky has swayed him more than any other writer, although Mr. Holbrooke's music has nothing of the languorous grace of the Russian master's; it is rougher and more ragged at the edges, but it has much of Tchaikovsky's fire. In fact Mr. Holbrooke may be called an angular Tchaikovsky.\\" Walthew, Richard: The Chamber music of Josef Holbrooke (The Sackbut) reprinted in Josef Holbrooke - Various appreciations by many authors (London: Rudall Carte, 1937, pp.124-125) The orchestral scores display a virtuosity of instrumentation which owes much to Elgar and Richard Strauss, reaching a peak in works such as Queen Mab, The Bells, Apollo and the Seaman and The Children of Don. From his early maturity onwards, Holbrooke evinced a sophisticated appreciation of orchestral tone-colour, using several unusual instruments in his scores including the concertina (The Bells), sarrusophone (Apollo and the Seaman), saxhorn and saxophone (Serenade for oboe d'amore, clarinet, basset horn, two saxhorns, viola, five saxophones and harp). His reputation for using outlandish instruments and inflated orchestral resources is, however, generally undeserved: most of his large-scale works are scored for the modern symphony orchestra as used in the early twentieth century. Hannen Swaffer, a writer for The Graphic, referred humorously to Holbrooke on several occasions as \\"The Cockney Wagner\\",Brown, Hubert: Stars of the record world (Gramophone), reprinted in Josef Holbrooke - Various appreciations by many authors (London: Rudall Carte, 1937, pp.83, 90) although the only real similarity between the two was a predeliction for mythological music drama: :\\"The texture of Holbrooke's music is un-Wagnerian, and if kinship with another composer must be found, it should be with Richard Strauss; but Holbrooke's score [Bronwen] is not voluptuous like Wagner's, nor full of nervous frenzy like Strauss'. In the overture there is a figure very similar to a motif in the Magic Fire Music, but if you take the trouble to play or sing them one after the other, you perceive a difference. While Wagner's clothing of the theme is sensuous, Holbooke's is sombre, stark and barbaric.\\" Bayliss, Stanley: Josef Holbrooke (Musical Mirror) reprinted in Josef Holbrooke - Various appreciations by many authors (London: Rudall Carte, 1937, p.106) Holbrooke generally utilised the freely-developing musical form as pioneered by Liszt, only loosely acknowledging more academic structures such as sonata form. This preference is shown in the frequent styling of his works as poems or fantasies, and the fact that virtually every single piece by him carries a descriptive or poetic title, often literary. Holbrooke's imagination was essentially illustrative: :\\"He has, indeed, a fine power of depicting strange scenes and situations to the mental vision by means of a masterly sense of tone colour. He paints with all that wealth of detail that distinguished the pre-Raphaelite school of painting, and endeavours to give every little nuance its place in the picture. His music is often full of luminous and magical suggestion, and his imaginative insight is very penetrating and sensitive.\\" Lowe, George: Josef Holbrooke and his work (London: Kegan Paul, 1920, p.34) Although Holbrooke's choral writing could occasionally be unadventurous and somewhat four-square, as in the poem for chorus and orchestra Byron,Holbrooke, Joseph: Byron, vocal score (London: Novello, 1904, pp.17-33)Lowe, George: Josef Holbrooke and his work (London: Kegan Paul, 1920, p.148) - \\"The effect is pleasing, though the writing for the voices lacks freedom and is rather stilted in character\\" there are effects of startling originality elsewhere, ranging from the vocal use of the acciaccatura in The Bells Holbrooke, Joseph: The Bells, vocal score (Leipzig and London: Breitkopf & H√§rtel, 1906, p.71) to the multi-layered chorus of shouted warcries in the final act of Bronwen.Holbrooke, Josef: Bronwen, vocal score (London: Goodwin & Tabb, 1922, pp..225-241) The solo vocal writing in the mature operas, whilst not strictly comparable with verismo, is generally declamatory and follows naturalistic speech-rhythms: in this sense at least, along with many of his contemporaries, Holbrooke was indebted to Wagner although his musical idiom is more dissonant. Indeed, from the 1920s onwards his music gained a noticeably increased harmonic astringency: :\\"Since Bronwen he has entered on a new style, more modern, more dynamic, one in which his love of 'rubbing-notes' is given free rein. This style was foreshadowed in parts of Bronwen, though it is more suited probably to such things as his latest opera, the Snob, on a virile sketch of Cockney life, written by Charles McEvoy.\\" Eaglefield Hull, Arthur: Miniature essays - Josef Holbrooke (London: J. & W. Chester, 1924, p.9)The BBC broadcast on 17 November 1995 of excerpts from Bronwen conducted by James Lockhart revealed, perhaps unexpectedly, a starkly dissonant musical language, especially in passages such as the Prelude to Act 3 However, his occasional forays into atonalism in piano works such as Four Futurist Dances and Bogey Beasts were uncharacteristic and intended as caricature: :\\"Some years ago, I too perpetrated some startling horrors in music, entitled Four Futurist Dances, and very hideous they were. They were caused by a pianoforte recital. I was irritated, and personally had to do it, to get the taste of Mr Ornstein (Leo Ornstein) out of my mouth. He is an American pianist of great entertainment, but a poor composer. Yet those idiotic pieces of mine have been taken seriously by many a Bolshevik in music!\\" Holbrooke, Joseph: Contemporary British composers (London: Cecil Palmer, 1925, p.181) Perhaps it was due to his early experience in the music hall that several of his melodies have a distinctly populist feel, for example the syncopated first subject in the final movement of the early Sextet in F minor.Holbrooke, Joseph: Third Sextet in F minor, score (London: Sidney Riorden, 1906, pp.33-34) =Reputation= The tendency towards the pictorial rather than the abstract in his music undoubtedly stemmed from Holbrooke's tuition at the Royal Academy: his reputation, along with that of other composers (including Granville Bantock and Arnold Bax) who studied under Frederick Corder, an ardent Wagnerian, has consequently suffered from what has been perceived as a lack of rigorous musical thought and an assumed want of self-criticism: :\\"his ardour often in its haste disregards the subtler and finer issues, and it is usually in front of his power of invention: many pages of the bulky operas The Children of Don and Dylan surge along in massive style without saying anything distinctive, and he is very liable - the scena Marino Faliero is a typical example - to drop into mere sharp-cornered turgidity. No English composer has worked with more consistent ideals: but his music is often apt to strive and cry aloud unnecessarily, and much of its appeal has been consequently, in the long run, weakened.\\" Walker, Ernest: A history of music in England, third edition revised and enlarged by J.A. Westrup (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1952, pp.349-350) :\\"Indeed his only originality seems to have been in sonority rather than thematic or harmonic invention. The overture to Bronwen and the symphonic poem The Viking when played by the B.B.C. under Granville Bantock in 1943, when Holbrooke's music was totally unfamiliar to anyone of a later generation, revealed this personal and distinctive sound- texture but otherwise seemed shapeless and repetitive.\\".Howes, Frank: The English Musical Renaissance (London: Secker & Warburg, 1966, p.227) :\\"Corder's methods were progressive but too easygoing, and all his pupils, even the devastatingly gifted Bax, suffered from it. Stanford was perhaps the better teacher, but he was also cruelly repressive, reactionary and insensitive - all his pupils have put on record some story of his crushing dismissal of their work. [...] He did give his pupils a disciplined approach that stood them in good stead; but he overdid it. Bantock, Holbrooke and Bax suffered from lack of self-discipline. [...] In his orchestral works Holbrooke bumps along with many jerky changes of harmony and rhythm, and a general sense of distracted restlessness.\\" Pirie, Peter J: Bantock and his generation (The Musical Times Vol.109, No.1506 (August 1968), pp.715-717) Other assessments of Holbrooke's music have been considerably more positive: :\\"It is a peculiarity of his music, with which I have often been struck, that no matter how extravagant and bizarre he may appear at times, never for one single moment do we feel that the effect is consciously laboured. It may not be precisely what we were expecting, but it invariably gives us the impression of being written forthright, of being the sincere record of something sincerely seen or unaffectedly felt. [...] I myself feel that Mr. Holbrooke's four symphonic poems [The Raven, The Skeleton in Armour, Ulalume and The Masque of the Red Death] will one day be recognised as something absolutely new in English or in any other music. They have an atmosphere, a psychology, that are his and his alone. They are not imitated; this atmosphere and this psychology are not in Wagner, or Tschaikowsky, or Richard Strauss. Morbidity - to employ a much abused word - has never been made so truly beautiful as here. [...] Mr. Holbrooke can do quite easily and unconsciously what Strauss has only done half a dozen times in his career - he can write a big, heartfelt melody that searches us to the very bone; and the musicians who have this gift as their birthright have a charmed life among a thousand shipwrecks.\\" Newman, Ernest: Holbrooke (The Speaker, 1902) reprinted in Josef Holbrooke - Various appreciations by many authors (London: Rudall Carte, 1937, pp.40-43) :\\"The popular impression of Holbrooke appears to be that he is a man of unregulated impulses, entirely self-centred, but by no means self-critical. This is quite an erroneous view of the man. Impulsive he undoubtedly is, and this characteristic often creeps into his work, but he rarely allows his musical ideas to appear in print until they have been approved by his calmer thought. [...] Most of his music passes through many crucibles of thought before it reaches its final form.\\" Lowe, George: Josef Holbrooke and his work (London: Kegan Paul, 1920, p.37) :\\"The Cauldron of Anwyn [sic] if written by a foreigner would command more than respect. As it is, it remains a curiosity and in its original state completely unproducible with any possibility of economic security. [...] His symphonies and chamber music have all come in for their share of abuse. Holbrooke is belligerent and his music tells us so; but it is often magnificent. Few composers have written such vital sea music as appears in Dylan.\\" Demuth, Norman: Musical trends in the 20th century (London: Rockliff, 1952, p.111) :\\"Holbrooke‚Äôs idiom is characterized by its accessibility and melodic appeal. A number of works employ Welsh folk melody or show the influence of music he heard while travelling abroad. His compositions exhibit full recourse to chromatic harmony and some imaginative delays of dissonance resolution. In the symphonic poems his gift for pictorial representation is most readily apparent; music follows text almost in the manner of a film score. Consequently, these works tend to be episodic and occasionally disjunct. While formulaic tendencies appear in his string writing, his brass writing can be masterful and vibrant. His chosen literary sources, often intense or even macabre, inspired music that is equally fraught, eloquently capturing the dramatic suspense.\\" Forbes, Anne‚ÄêMarie: Holbrooke, Joseph in The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, 2nd edition (London and New York: Macmillan, 2001, volume 11, pp.615‚Äê616) Recordings Only a small fraction of Holbrooke's large output has been recorded, although he was deeply interested in promoting his music through various reproductive formats. Scott-Ellis financed several gramophone recordings including excerpts from The Cauldron of Annwn, most notably from the final opera of the trilogy, Bronwen. Issued by Columbia, these were positively received: :\\"The Columbia Company have given one of our most neglected composers a hearing on the gramophone by their issue of some important fragments from Josef Holbrook'e music drama Bronwen. This country has had nothing so intensely individual and so closely dramatic in conception and treatment as the music of Bronwen. [...] Many unforgettable moments of grandeur and spiritual appeal will be wasted if music lovers omit to hear these records for themselves.\\" Riddle, George: Bronwen - a rare treasure (Gramophone, March 1931, p.41) Other recordings appeared intermittently throughout the 1930s, including a coupling of the Dylan Prelude and the finale of Holbrooke's third symphony (both abridged) on Decca: :\\"It has been objected that Holbrooke is mighty clever, and precious little else. That seems too harsh a judgment. I think one can hear a fair amount of his music with pleasure, on occasion but the profound and the natively touching qualities he does not seem surely to command. Yet I have heard lots of preludes inferior in spirit and general stir to this Dylan one, which I think most people would enjoy. It is worth trying, in this clear, judicious, aptly coloured recording.\\" Analytical notes and first reviews - Decca (Gramophone, January 1938, p.13) Another highlight was Paxton's 1949 recording of the piano concerto The Song of Gwyn ap Nudd played by Grace Lyndon with the London Promenade Orchestra conducted by Arthur Hammond (1904-1991).Review (Gramophone, September 1949, p.16) In 1993 several of these historical recordings were re-issued on compact disc by Symposium.Symposium CD 1130 Besides gramophone records, Holbrooke oversaw the production of a large number of pianola and organ rolls of his music including abridged arrangements of Apollo and the Seaman, the overture to Children of Don, the overture to Bronwen, Queen Mab, The Viking, The Raven, The Wilfowl, the variations on Three Blind Mice and Auld Lang Syne, and the second piano concerto L'Orient.Josef Holbrooke - Various appreciations by many authors (London: Rudall Carte, 1937, pp.183-184)Complete list of the works (mechanically produced) of Josef Holbrooke (London: Modern Music Library, n.d.

The English composer and bassist Gavin Bryars paid tribute to Holbrooke by giving the name Joseph Holbrooke to his collective free- improvising trio with Derek Bailey and Tony Oxley. Despite the name, the group never played Holbrooke's compositions. Holbrooke Court, Parkhurst Road, Islington built in 1974 is named after him.

The idea of the E&NA; as a single system was conceived at a railway conference in Portland, Maine in 1850 by railroad entrepreneur John A. Poor. The line was intended to link Portland (the eastern terminus of the US rail network) with an ice-free Atlantic port in Nova Scotia to connect with fast trans-Atlantic ships from Europe; the port at Halifax was discussed as a possible eastern terminus for the line, as was Canso. The concept was also discussed throughout the early 1850s in New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, and Maine as a means to connect the British colonies with the railway network of the United Province of Canada. Poor himself was also promoting a connection from Portland to Richmond and built the St. Lawrence and Atlantic Railroad (SL&A;), opening in 1853, the same year it was purchased by Grand Trunk. Poor stood to benefit from a dual flow of traffic from the Maritimes to New England and the Maritimes to the Canadas. E&NA; \\"Eastern Extension\\" (Saint John to Shediac) The railway most commonly referred to as the E&NA; in Canada was built between Saint John and Shediac, New Brunswick as a segment of Poor‚Äôs vision of a Portland-Nova Scotia line. The initial ownership of the line is unclear, however the European and North American Railway was incorporated in New Brunswick on March 15, 1851, following the Portland conference, with the intention being to start construction east toward Nova Scotia. Both Saint John, and St. Andrews, New Brunswick were vying for the E&NA; to begin in their respective communities; however Saint John managed to convince the company to begin on the east side of the Saint John River. Saint John also convinced the company to forego plans to build into Nova Scotia by concentrating on reaching the Northumberland Strait first. This would give the city a steamship connection through the Gulf of St. Lawrence to Canada East, as well as allowing coal and other goods to avoid the circuitous and hazardous transit around Nova Scotia. Construction started in 1853, heading northeast from Saint John up the Kennebecasis River valley. Unfortunately construction did not proceed very far and the company went bankrupt in 1856 with the colonial government of New Brunswick taking over the company‚Äôs line in 1857. The Rothesay railway station was originally known as Kennebecasis Station when completed on the E&NA; line at Rothesay in 1860. It is one of the oldest stations still in existence in Canada. That year (1857) saw construction proceed apace under a newly reincorporated government- owned European and North American Railway Co. Canada‚Äôs first civil engineering graduate, H.G.C. Ketchum, of the University of New Brunswick, was employed in the surveying and construction of the line. Ketchum surveyed a high-capacity railway with long tangent sections and minimal grades between Saint John and Moncton. The first section of the E&NA; opened between Shediac and Moncton on August 20, 1857, a distance of . Although the Shediac-Moncton section was the first part opened, the line was soon extended 2 miles east to the better wharf facilities at Point du Chene. The line had been surveyed to extend from Cape Brule 2 miles further east of Point du Chene, however the sheltered harbour at Point du Chene won out over the more exposed Cape Brule location. 1860 New Brunswick stamp showing an E&NA; engine, the first ever depicted in a postage stampMeanwhile, the line between Hampton, New Brunswick and Saint John opened in 1859 and the remaining section between Moncton and Hampton was opened in 1860. In 1860, the colony of New Brunswick issued a postage stamp which illustrated an E&NA; engine. The stamp was commissioned by the postmaster and one of the railway's directors, Charles Connell.J.J. MacDonald, Charles Connell and His Stamp - The Stamp's Survival, The Canadian Philatelist, September‚ÄìOctober 2000 Unfortunately, the E&NA; never progressed east from Moncton to its stated goal of Nova Scotia. By the late 1850s, the Nova Scotia Railway had already built a line from Halifax to Truro, Nova Scotia, with a stated ambition of building westward to link with the E&NA; in New Brunswick; thus the E&NA; stood with its Saint John-Shediac line for several years. The missing link between Truro and Moncton was finally built by the Intercolonial Railway, completed in 1872. The E&NA;‚Äôs \\"Eastern Extension\\" locomotive shops and headquarters were located in Shediac until it was taken over by the Intercolonial Railway, which then moved them to Moncton. E&NA; \\"Western Extension\\" (South Bay to St. Croix, New Brunswick) Less well-known was the railway most commonly referred to as the E&NA; Western Extension which was built between South Bay, New Brunswick (immediately west of Saint John) and St. Croix on the International Boundary with Maine. On April 13, 1864, the colonial government in New Brunswick incorporated a company called the European and North American Railway for extension from Saint John westward to build the \\"Western Extension\\" of the E&NA; system. The 90-mile railway was surveyed later that year and a contract for construction was awarded to E.R. Burpee. On November 9, 1865, the first sod was turned at South Bay by the mayor of Saint John. By August 14, 1869 the line was opened between South Bay and Hartts Mills (later renamed Fredericton Junction). On November 17, 1869 the line was completely opened from the Maine border at St. Croix east to Saint John. E&NA; \\"Maine\\" (Bangor to Vanceboro) The E&NA; incorporated in the State of Maine as the European and North American Railway on August 20, 1850. Subsequent delays over the next 15 years saw its charter revised to run from Bangor to Vanceboro, Maine on the International Boundary opposite St. Croix, New Brunswick. Construction finally began with the section from Bangor to Olamon, Maine, opening in 1868 and Olamon to Mattawamkeag, Maine, opening in 1869. The 114 mile line was finally completed to Vanceboro in October 1871, linking the E&NA; (Maine) to the E&NA; (Western Extension) at Vanceboro-St. Croix. A ceremony celebrating completion of the line was attended by U.S. President Ulysses S. Grant and Canadian Governor General Lord Lisgar at the boundary bridge crossing the St. Croix River. Consolidation On November 9, 1872, the Eastern Division was consolidated, along with the Nova Scotia Railway, into the Intercolonial Railway. On the other hand, the Maine and Western companies were merged on December 1, 1872 as the Consolidated European and North American Railway, which defaulted on its bonds in 1875. The Western Extension bondholders organized the St. John and Maine Railway on March 29, 1878, and acquired the property in New Brunswick on August 31. The New Brunswick Railway leased this line on July 1, 1883. The Maine property was similarly reorganized under its original name - European and North American Railway - in October 1880. The Maine Central Railroad leased this line on April 1, 1882. Synopsis of Portland-Halifax railway line Although the entire Portland to Halifax line that was envisioned at the Portland conference in 1850 was not built by the E&NA; per se, several portions of this system were completed by other companies as follows: * The Richmond (Halifax) to Truro section was built between 1854-1858 by the Nova Scotia Railway. * Moncton to Truro was built between 1868-1872 by the Intercolonial Railway. * Portland to Bangor was built between 1845-1850 by the Androscoggin and Kennebec Railroad and Penobscot and Kennebec Railroad, both of which merged to form the Maine Central Railroad in 1862. An express passenger train known as the Gull was jointly operated over this route by the various owners from 1930 to 1960.Lowe, J. Norman Canadian National in the East volume 3 (1985) Calgary Group of the British Railway Modellers of North America Subsequent disposition of Portland-Halifax railway line Although the Portland to Halifax railway line remains in operation, various sections of the line have undergone several corporate changes over the years: =Halifax-Saint John= The Intercolonial Railway (ICR) took over the Nova Scotia Railway and E&NA; \\"Eastern Extension\\" on November 9, 1872, following completion of its connection between Truro and Moncton. The E&NA; \\"Eastern Extension\\" was standard gauged on November 11, 1872. The Intercolonial Railway came under the control of the Canadian Government Railways (CGR) in 1915. CGR was merged into the Canadian National Railways (CNR) in 1918. CN continues to operate these lines, although the Shediac spur has been cut back to Scoudouc, New Brunswick. =Saint John-St. Croix= The E&NA; \\"Western Extension\\" was operated by the New Brunswick government separately from the E&NA; \\"Eastern Extension\\" and thus did not get included in the takeover by the Intercolonial Railway, which was focused exclusively on building and operating a railway from Halifax to Quebec. The E&NA; \\"Western Extension\\" was standard gauged by 1877. The E&NA; \\"Western Extension\\" became part of the New Brunswick Railway (NBR) in 1883. On July 1, 1890, the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) secured a lease for 999 years for the NBR. CPR applied to abandon the line effective January 1, 1995, however it was subsequently taken over by New Brunswick Southern Railway which continues to operate the line today. =Vanceboro-Bangor= The E&NA; \\"Maine\\" was operated separately from its completion in 1871 until it was leased to the Maine Central Railroad (MEC) in 1882. In 1889 the International Railway of Maine was built by Canadian Pacific Railway from Megantic, Quebec to the MEC at Mattawamkeag, Maine The MEC granted trackage rights to the CPR over the 56 mile section from Mattawamkeag to Vanceboro at that time. In November 1955, MEC purchased the entire 114 mile E&NA; \\"Maine\\" for US$125 per share or US$3,114,500 payable in cash or bonds. On December 17, 1974, the CPR purchased the 56 mile Mattawamkeag to Vanceboro section from MEC for US$5.4 million, although MEC maintained trackage rights. MEC maintained ownership of the 58 mile Bangor to Mattawamkeag section. In 1981, MEC was purchased by Guilford Rail System, which continues to operate the Bangor to Mattawamkeag section. CPR applied to abandon the Mattawamkeag-Vanceboro section effective January 1, 1995, however it was subsequently taken over by Eastern Maine Railway which continues to operate the line. =Portland-Bangor= The Maine Central was created in 1862 and was sold to Guilford Rail System (GRS) in 1981. GRS continues to operate the line as of 2005.

The story is about a black female vigilante played by Pam Grier who seeks violent revenge against a heroin dealer responsible for her sister's addiction.Gary A. Smith, The American International Pictures Video Guide, McFarland 2009 p 40 The film's tagline in advertising was \\"They call her 'Coffy' and she'll you!\\" Plot A nurse, last name \\"Coffin\\" but usually referred to as \\"Coffy\\", seeks revenge against the people responsible for her younger sister Lubelle's heroin addiction and the widespread violence that exists in her city. Under the guise of a prostitute willing to do anything for a drug fix, she lures a drug pusher and a mob boss to their residences, killing them. After the killings, Coffy returns to her job at a local hospital operating room. After her shift, Coffy‚Äôs police friend Carter offers to drive her home. Carter is a straight-shooting officer who is not willing to bend the law for the mob or the thugs who have been bribing officers at his precinct. Coffy doesn't believe his strong moral resolve until two hooded men break into Carter's house while she's visiting him and beat Carter severely, temporarily crippling him. This enrages Coffy, giving her further provocation to continue her work as a vigilante, killing those responsible for harming Carter and her sister. Coffy's boyfriend, Howard Brunswick, is a city councilman. Coffy admires Brunswick for his contributions to the community. Brunswick announces his plan to run for Congress, and his purchase of a night club. Coffy is pleased with these developments. Coffy's next targets are a pimp named King George, one of the largest suppliers of prostitutes and illegal drugs in the city, and Mafia boss Arturo Vitroni, a criminal associate of George's. Coffy questions a former patient of hers, who is a known drug user, to gain insight into the type of woman King George likes and where he keeps his stash of drugs. Coffy shows no sympathy for the drug-addled woman and is abusive to her as she looks for answers. Coffy is on a mission of revenge and no one will stand in her way. With the information she gets from the woman, Coffy tracks down George and poses as a Jamaican woman looking to trick for him. George is immediately interested in her exotic nature and hires her. One of the prostitutes becomes jealous when she sees King George taking an interest in Coffy. Later that day, Coffy and the other prostitutes get into a massive brawl. Coffy wins out, which attracts mob boss Vitroni who demands that he must have her that night. Coffy plans to murder Vitroni and just when she is about to shoot, she is overtaken by his men. She lies and tells Vitroni that King George ordered her to kill him, which makes Vitroni order George to be murdered. Vitroni's men kill George by lynching him by the neck from his car, which they drive through an open field. Coffy then discovers Brunswick, her clean-cut boyfriend, is corrupt when she's shown to him at a meeting of the mob and several police officials. He denies knowing her other than as a prostitute and Coffy is sent to her death. Coffy uses her sexuality to seduce her would-be killers. They try injecting her with drugs to sedate her, but she had replaced the illicit drugs with a sugar solution earlier. Faking a high, she kills her unsuspecting hitmen with a pointed metal wire she fashioned herself and hid in her hair. Running to avoid capture, Coffy carjacks a vehicle to escape. Coffy drives to Vitroni's house, murders him, and then goes to Brunswick's to do the same. He pleads for forgiveness and just as she is about to accept, a naked white woman comes out of his bedroom. Coffy shoots Brunswick in the groin. The film then closes with Coffy walking along the beach having avenged her sister. Production According to writer/director Hill, the project began when American International Pictures' head of production, Larry Gordon, lost the rights to the film Cleopatra Jones after making a handshake deal with the producers. Gordon subsequently approached Hill to quickly make a movie about an African-American woman's revenge and beat Cleopatra Jones to market. Hill wanted to work with Pam Grier, whom he had worked with on The Big Doll House (1971). The film ended up earning more money than Cleopatra Jones and established Grier as an icon of the genre. Coffy is notable in its depiction of a strong black female lead (a professional nurse), something rare in the genre at the time, and also in its then-unfashionable anti-drug message.

Writing of the chamber music of Friedrich Kiel, the scholar and critic Wilhelm Altmann notes that it was Kiel‚Äôs extreme modesty which kept him and his exceptional works from receiving the consideration they deserved. After mentioning Johannes Brahms and others, Altmann writes, ‚ÄúHe produced a number of chamber works, which . . . need fear no comparison.‚Äù Biography Friedrich Kiel Kiel was born in Bad Laasphe, Puderbach. He was taught the rudiments of music and received his first piano lessons from his father, but was in large part self-taught. Something of a prodigy, he played the piano almost without instruction at the age of six, and by his thirteenth year he had composed much music. Kiel eventually came to the attention of Prince Albrecht Sayn-Wittgenstein-Berleburg, a great music lover. Through the Prince's efforts, Kiel was allowed to study violin with the concertmaster of the Prince‚Äôs fine orchestra with which he later performed as a soloist. Kiel was also given theory lessons from the renowned flautist Kaspar Kummer. By 1840, the eighteen-year-old Kiel was court conductor and the music teacher to the prince‚Äôs children. Two years later, Louis Spohr heard him and arranged for a scholarship which allowed Kiel to study in Berlin with the renowned theorist and teacher Siegfried Dehn. In Berlin, Kiel eventually became sought after as an instructor. In 1866, he received a teaching position at the prestigious Stern conservatory, where he taught composition and was elevated to a professorship three years later. In 1870 he joined the faculty of the newly founded Hochschule f√ºr Musik which was shortly thereafter considered one of the finest music schools in Germany. For his many students Kiel's hobby was mountaineering and at age 60, he climbed Europe's second highest peak, the Monte Rosa, on the Swiss-Italian border. In September 1883 he was involved in a traffic accident with a coach. His injuries eventually forced him to retire shortly before his death in September 1885. Compositions Kiel's compositions number over seventy, including a piano concerto, motets, oratorios (including the Star of Bethlehem), as well as a Missa Solemnis and two Requiems. Chamber music comprises a considerable part of Kiel's output and must be regarded among his most important and best compositions. (See list below) Altmann noted that, \\"throughout my long life, I have found Kiel‚Äôs chamber music a never-failing source of delight.‚Äù He praised Kiel highly as a melodist and lamented that it was ‚Äúscandalously unjust‚Äù that Kiel‚Äôs two string quartets were as good as forgotten. Writing about Kiel's two Piano Quintets Opp. 75 & 76 in The Chamber Music Journal, R. H. R. Silvertrust remarks, \\"Both of these quintets are as fine as any in the entire literature.\\" Several of his chamber works, along with the piano concerto and some choral works, have been recorded.

The program starred Michael Gray as Billy Batson, a teenage boy who can transform into the superhero Captain Marvel, originally played by Jackson Bostwick and later by John Davey, by speaking the magic word \\"Shazam!\\" With his guardian \\"Mentor\\" (Les Tremayne), Billy travels the country in a 1973 Dodge Open Road motorhome, looking for injustices to resolve. The show ran from 1974 to 1976 on CBS' Saturday morning lineup. From 1975 to 1977 it was known as The Shazam!/Isis Hour and included The Secrets of Isis, about an Ancient Egyptian superheroine resurrected in the body of a schoolteacher, as the second half of the hour. Format The Mentor character, as played by Les Tremayne, was unique to the TV series and did not originate from the Shazam! comics. His background, and the origin of his relationship to Billy, were never explained. In later issues of the 1970s Shazam! comics meant to tie-in with the TV show, Billy's Uncle Dudley grows a moustache, drives Billy around the country in an RV, and tells Billy that the Wizard Shazam chose him to be Billy's \\"mentor\\", essentially turning Dudley into the comic book version of Mentor. The Mentor character has not been used since, although Uncle Dudley is shown driving a similar RV in the 2010s animated series Justice League Action. Neither Mary nor Freddy appeared in this series, although the three main members of the Marvel Family did appear together in new stories in the tie-in era comics. After Shazam! was paired with The Secrets of Isis in 1975, Joanna Cameron, the star of Isis, appeared as Isis and her alter-ego Andrea Thomas on three episodes of Shazam!, and John Davey likewise appeared as Captain Marvel in three episodes of Isis. Shazam! is one of the first Filmation productions to carry the trademark spinning executive producers' credit wheel (\\"Norm Prescott-Lou Scheimer\\") during the opening credits rather than the closing credits. Broadcast history After its original network run, Shazam! was brought back for reruns from January 5 through August 30, 1980. A handful of episodes appeared on Nickelodeon/Nick@Nite‚Äôs sister network, TV Land infrequently throughout the 2000s, originally appearing on the \\"Ultimate Fan Hour\\" in early 2004 as part of the \\"TV Land Kitschen\\" late weekend night programming block. Since early March 2019, the series has been available for streaming on the DC Universe streaming service.

Television Commemorative DVD Volume 8: Shazam, part of a DVD series designed to promote 50 years of Warner Bros. Television and to promote other TV shows that were not yet released on DVD. It was included with the release of the third season of Wonder Woman in 2005 in North America. Meanwhile, the rights to The Secrets of Isis remained with Filmation's successors Entertainment Rights, Classic Media, and DreamWorks Classics; that series was released on DVD in its entirety in 2007, including the three episodes featuring Captain Marvel.

She is widely regarded as a pioneer of women's liberation in South Asia. She advocated for men and women to be treated equally as rational beings, noting that the lack of education for women was responsible for their inferior economic position. Her major works include Matichur (A String of Sweet Pearls, 1904 and 1922), a collection of essays in two volumes expressing her feminist thoughts; Sultana's Dream (1908), a feminist science fiction novella set in Ladyland ruled by women; Padmarag (\\"Essence of the Lotus\\", 1924) depicting the difficulties faced by Bengali wives; and Abarodhbasini (The Confined Women, 1931), a spirited attack on the extreme forms of purdah that endangered women's lives and self-image. Rokeya held education to be the central precondition of women's liberation, establishing the first school aimed primarily at Muslim girls in Kolkata. She is said to have gone from house to house persuading the parents to send their girls to her school in Nisha. Until her death, she ran the school despite facing hostile criticism and social obstacles. In 1916, she founded the Muslim Women's Association, an organization that fought for women's education and employment. In 1926, Rokeya presided over the Bengal Women's Education Conference convened in Kolkata, the first significant attempt to bring women together in support of women's education rights. She was engaged in debates and conferences regarding the advancement of women until her death on 9 December 1932, shortly after presiding over a session during the Indian Women's Conference. Bangladesh observes Rokeya Day on 9 December every year to commemorate her works and legacy. On that day, Bangladesh government also confers Begum Rokeya Padak on individual women for their exceptional achievement. In 2004, Rokeya was ranked number 6 in BBC's poll of the Greatest Bengali of all time.  Background and family  Rangpur, pictured in 2012. Roquiah Khatun was born in 1880 in Pairaband village, Rangpur in the-then British India. Her ancestors served in the military and judiciary during the Mughal regime. Her father, Jahiruddin Muhammad Abu Ali Haidar Saber, was a zamindar and a multi-lingual intellectual. He married four times; his marriage to Rahatunnessa resulted in the birth of Rokeya, who had two sisters and three brothers, one of whom died in childhood. Rokeya's eldest brother Ibrahim Saber, and her immediate elder sister Karimunnesa Khanam Chaudhurani, both had a major influence on her life. Karimunnesa wanted to study Bengali, the language of the majority in Bengali people, against her family's wish who preferred to use Arabic and Persian as the media of education. Ibrahim taught English and Bengali to Rokeya and Karimunnesa. Karimunnesa married at the age of fourteen and later became a poet. Both of her sons, Abdul Karim Ghaznavi and Abdul Halim Ghaznavi, became politicians and occupied ministerial portfolios under British authorities. Marriage Rokeya with her husband, Sakhawat Hussain (1898) Rokeya married at the age of 18, in 1898 to 38-year-old Khan Bahadur Sakhawat Hussain. He was an Urdu-speaking deputy magistrate of Bhagalpur (a present-day district of Bihar state). He earned his bachelor of agriculture degree from England and was a member of Royal Agricultural Society of England. He married Rokeya after the death of his first wife. As a liberal, he encouraged Rokeya to continue learning Bengali and English. He also encouraged her to write, and on his advice, she adopted Bengali as the principal language for her literary works. Literary career Rokeya launched her literary career in 1902 with a Bengali essay entitled Pipasa (Thirst). She later published the books Matichur (1905) and Sultana's Dream (1908) before her husband died in 1909. In Sultana's Dream, Rokeya wrote reversing the roles of men and women in which women were the dominant sex and the men were subordinate. She also depicts an alternative, feminist vision of science, in which inventions such as solar ovens, flying cars, and cloud condensers are used to benefit the whole of society. It is regarded as a notable and influential satire. She wrote regularly for the Saogat, Mahammadi, Nabaprabha, Mahila, Bharatmahila, Al- Eslam, Nawroz, Mahe Nao, Bangiya Musalman Sahitya Patrika, The Mussalman, Indian Ladies Magazine and others. Five months after Rokeya's husband's death, she established a high school, naming it Sakhawat Memorial Girls' High School. It started in Bhagalpur, a traditionally Urdu-speaking area, with five students. A dispute with her husband's family over property forced her to move the school in 1911 to Calcutta, a Bengali-speaking area. She ran the school for 24 years. Rokeya founded the Anjuman-e-Khawateen-e-Islam (Islamic Women's Association), which was active in holding debates and conferences regarding the status of women and education. She advocated reform, particularly for women, and believed that parochialism and excessive conservatism were principally responsible for the relatively slow development of Muslims in British India. Anjuman-e-Khawateen-e-Islam organised events for social reforms based on the original teachings of Islam that, according to her, were lost. = Literary style = Rokeya wrote a number of genres, short stories, poems, essays, novels and satirical writings, developing a distinctive literary style, characterised by creativity, logic and a wry sense of humour. She started writing in the Nabanoor from about 1903, under the name of Mrs R S Hossain. However, there is an opinion that her first published writing Pipasa appeared in the Nabaprabha in 1902. Her writings called upon women to protest against injustices and break the social barriers that discriminated against them.  Works  * Pipasa (\\"Thirst\\", 1902). * Matichur (essays, 1st vol. 1904, 2nd vol. 1922).

He is also sometimes called in the Chinese tradition \\"Hufa Weituo Zuntian Pusa\\", meaning \\"Honored Dharma Protector Skanda Bodhisattva\\", because he is the leader of the twenty-four celestial guardian deities mentioned in the Golden Light Sutra. In Chinese temples, Skanda faces the statue of the Buddha in the main shrine. In others, he is on the far right of the main shrine, whereas on the left is his counterpart, Sangharama (personified as the historical general Guan Yu). In Chinese sutras, his image is found at the end of the sutra, a reminder of his vow to protect and preserve the teachings. According to legends, Skanda was the son of a virtuous king who had complete faith in Buddha's teachings. When the Buddha entered nirvana, the Buddha instructed Skanda to guard the Dharma. It was his duty to protect members of the sangha when they are disturbed by Mara, the tempter, and also to resolve conflicts amongst members of the sangha. A few days after the Buddha's passing and cremation, evil demons stole his relics. Skanda's vow of protecting the faith and Dharma was proven when he managed to defeat the evil demons and returned the relics. Origins Stories vary on how Skanda was accepted into the traditional Chinese Buddhist pantheon. Some have proposed that Skanda's features were adapted from a Chinese deity who appeared in the Chinese classical Ming novel Fengshen Yanyi. However, the existence of illustrated Skanda images predating the Ming Dynasty set his origins back to an earlier period in the development of Chinese Buddhism. Skanda is described as a young man fully clad in the armor and headgear of a Chinese general, and is usually leaning on a vajra staff. Some suggest that Skanda may have come from Tamil Religion as the war deity ‡ÆÆ‡ØÅ‡Æ∞‡ØÅ‡Æï‡Æ©‡Øç / Muruga /Guhan/ Kandha- ‡Æï‡Æ®‡Øç‡Æ§‡Ææ (Tamil), who bears the title Skanda. Others point out that Skanda might also be a manifestation of Vajrapani, a bodhisattva who bears some relations to Skanda because they both wield vajras as weapons, are portrayed with flaming halos, and are both heavenly protectors of Buddhism. Skanda may be connected through Vajrapani through a theory to his connection to Greco-Buddhism, as Wei Tuo's image is reminiscent of the Heracles depiction of Vajrapani. Although Skanda is only a deva, he is very often addressed as a bodhisattva. =As Miao Shan's lover= When the bodhisattva Avalokitesvara was reincarnated as the princess Miao Shan, Skanda (known as Wei Tuo in this story) was one of her cruel father's generals. He loved Miao Shan but realized he could not possibly be a proper partner to her, since she was a pure person. However, Wei Tuo was inspired by Miao Shan's kindness so he decided to stay faithful and devoted to Miao Shan, even if she wasn't his wife. The two escaped Miao Shan's father, and the general-suitor helped build Miao Shan a temple and a kingdom of her own. Soon however, the cruel king found them and killed them both. The general, because of his devotion to Guan Yin, transformed into a bodhisattva himself, who vowed to always serve and protect Guan Yin. His appearance as a Chinese general is the direct forebear to his connection with Miao Shan. =As a warrior= Another story says that Miao Shan was told to commit suicide by her grandmother. Her grandmother forced Miao Shan to leap into the sea because she was thought to have been an incarnation of a demon, when in fact she was not. The emperor told a loyal soldier named Luo Ping to pretend to throw Miao Shan into the ocean. He brought her with Yin Ma, the mother of Wei Tuo, to her village. Years passed, when an evil fish demon came. A disloyal soldier named Huo Yi was sent by the fish demon to kill Miao Shan. The fish demon wanted revenge on Miao Shan because she was the incarnation of Ci Hang Da Shi, a Buddhist deva that put the fish in a lotus pond. Huo Yi and his troops went to the village where Miao Shan and Wei Tuo lived and fought. Huo Yi's son killed Wei Tuo. After Miao Shan became the bodhisattva Avalokitesvara, she made Skanda a bodhisattva guardian. He became a bodhisattva because he took care of Miao Shan and loved her as a sister. According to the lunar calendar, his birthday is the 3rd day of the 6th lunar month.

The Commission The commission was an official National Commission of Inquiry appointed by the Israeli government to investigate the circumstances leading to the outbreak of the Yom Kippur War. The Committee was headed by Shimon Agranat, Chief Justice of Israel's Supreme Court. Its other members were Justice Moshe Landau, State Comptroller Yitzchak Nebenzahl, and former Chiefs of Staff Yigael Yadin and Chaim Laskov. The Committee sat for 140 sessions, during which they listened to the testimony of 58 witnesses.Frankel, William, Israel Observed: An Anatomy of the State. Thames and Hudson, 1980. Page 271. It was established on 21 November 1973 with a remit to investigate: # The intelligence information for the days preceding the Yom Kippur War on the enemy's moves and intentions to launch the war, the evaluation of this information, and the decisions taken by the responsible military and civil authorities in response thereto. # The general deployment of the IDF in case of war, its state of readiness during the days preceding the Yom Kippur War, and its operations up to the containment of the enemy.Dayan, Moshe, Story of My Life. . 1976. Page 592. It did not examine the later stages of the war when the IDF went on the offensive. On 31 December 1973, elections that had been delayed by the war took place. Likud, a new political party, won 39 seats in the Knesset. Newly elected Member of Knesset and one of the Likud founders, Reserve General Ariel Sharon gave a newspaper interview in which he was quoted as saying that he would disobey orders that he felt were against the interests of the State or his subordinates. This caused so much public concern that Sharon was asked to appear before the Commission,Peri, Yoram. Between Battle and Ballots: Israeli Military in politics. . 1983. Page 118. Interview in Maariv, 25 January 1974. \\"When I receive an order, I treat it according to three values: the first, and most important, is the good of the state. The state is the supreme thing. The second value is my obligation to my subordinates, and the third value is my obligation to my superiors.\\" which accepted his testimony that the quote was in the context of a specific event which occurred under very exceptional circumstances.Laquer, Rubin. Page 496. Findings The commission's report was published in three parts.For details about the Agranat Commission Report in general, and the imprint it has left on Israeli collective memory in particular, see Nadav G. Molchadsky, ‚ÄúThe Agranat Commission Report and the Making of the Israeli Memory of the Yom Kippur War,‚Äù in Nadav G. Molchadsky(2015), History in the Public Courtroom: Commissions of Inquiry and Struggles over the History and Memory of Israeli Traumas, (Ph.D. Dissertation, University of California, Los Angeles), pp. 119-164. The interim report, released 1 April 1974, called for the dismissal of a number of senior officers in the IDF and caused such controversy that Prime Minister Golda Meir was forced to resign. The second part was published 10 July 1974 and contained the reasons for the conclusions of the first report. The final part of the report was published on 30 January 1975.Laqueur, Walter and Rubin, Barry, The Israeli-Arab Reader: A Documentary History of the Middle East Conflict. 1984, . Page 487. One consequence of the Commission's investigation was the \\"Basic Law: The Army (1975)\\", clarifying the IDF's legal status. =The Interim Report= Published on 1 April 1974, the Interim Report caused a sensation. Its headline recommendation was the dismissal of four senior officers in military intelligence: The Chief of Military Intelligence Major General Eliyahu Zeira, his deputy Brigadier Aryeh Shalev, the head of the Egyptian Department Lt Colonel Yona Bendman, and the chief intelligence officer in the Southern Command Lt Colonel David Gedalia.Dayan, page 606. The report also was critical of what it called the \\"concept\\" in military intelligence thinking. The \\"concept\\" was based on the assumption that Egypt would only attack if it had the air-power to take on the Israeli Air Force. Military intelligence also thought that Syria would only attack if Egypt did. In the absence of any upgrading of Egypt's air force, the directorate concluded there was no threat of imminent war.Frankel, page 271. Shlaim, Avi The Iron Wall: Israel and the Arab World. 2000. . Page 319.Steven, Stewart, The Spymasters of Israel. 1980, ninth printing 1988. . Page 358:\\" [Zeira] was one of the architects of what was known as 'the concept.' Simply stated, the concept laid down first that the Arabs were not ready for an all-out war with Israel. Though they had the ability to launch a limited war, they knew perfectly well that Israel would not feel itself bound by the rules of that game, and a limited war would quickly escalate into a general one. Second, Zeira's concept laid down, if there was to be a war, it would be a short one. The third assumption was that in an overall war, the Arabs would be quickly defeated.\\" This assumption led to complacency and evidence being ignored. For example, on 1 October and again on 3 October 1973, Lieutenant Benjamin Siman Yov, order of battle intelligence officer for the Southern Command, gave his superior Lt Colonel Gadalia documents indicating Egypt's war preparations.Herzog, Chaim, The Arab-Israeli Wars: War and Peace in the Middle East. 1982, . page 236. In its examination of the senior echelons of the IDF, the commission also concluded that GOC Southern Command Shmuel Gonen should be dismissed. After his departure, Gonen argued that he had only been in the post for a few months and that the command had been neglected by his predecessor Ariel Sharon.Herzog, page 158. The Commission also found Chief of Staff David Elazar responsible, but it refused to give an opinion on the responsibility of the Minister of Defense Moshe Dayan, arguing that this was beyond its remit. This report caused public uproar and unhappiness in the army. In Abba Eban's words \\"The conclusions ... did not seem to accord with the narrative\\"Eban, Abba, An Autobiography. 1977, . page 568. Yitzhak Rabin walked out of the cabinet with Elazar.Rabin, Leah, Rabin: Our Life, His Legacy. 1997, . page 149. Thousands of demonstrators took to the streets.Shlaim, page 323. Nine days after the publication of the Interim Report, Golda Meir announced the resignation of her government. After his dismissal, Elazar maintained that had he been given more of the information, he would have mobilized the IDF sooner. This only confirmed the Commission's criticisms about the reliance on a single avenue for intelligence analysis.Herzog, 239.Stewart, page 359: \\"At the end of the war, Chief of Staff Elazar claimed that 'some two hundred cables' from Israeli agents around the world indicating that war was imminent never reached him.\\" Elazar died two years later aged 48.Herzog, page 62. =The Final Report= The final part of the report was published on 30 January 1975. The completed report was 1,500 pages long, with 746 pages devoted to the fighting in the south and 311 to the northern front. Forty two pages were made public, the remainder being classified.Frankel, page 271.Laquer, Pages 491‚Äì492. Besides the IDF's failures, it looked at the issues around civilian and political control of the army and found a \\"lack of clear definitions...\\". Surprisingly, they could not find a clear statement of civilian control over the military. They argued that the Basic Law: The Cabinet (1968) implied authority when it stated that the Cabinet has authority over all areas not covered by other legislation. Later critics argued that the Cabinet's authority stemmed from the IDF Order (1948), which authorised the Minister of Defence to set up the army. Further questions arose over hundreds of orders issued by Chiefs of Staff since 1948 without authorisation from the Minister of Defence. These discoveries led to the swift enactment of Basic Law: The Army (1975). Its main clause stated: * The Army is subject to the authority of the Cabinet. * The Minister responsible is the Minister of Defense. * The supreme commander of the Army is the Chief of Staff. * The Chief of Staff is subject to the authority of Cabinet and subordinate to the Minister of Defence. The new law still left some issues unresolved, such as who appoints a Chief of Staff and whether the Chief of Staff was the most senior officer in the army. In practice, the controversy about the report's absence of criticism of Moshe Dayan led to a strengthening of the Chief of Staff's position since he could argue that if the Chief of Staff had sole responsibility, it must be the Chief of Staff's decision. The Chief of Staff was now a regular attender of cabinet meetings.Peri, page 142. The Commission was critical of the standard of everyday discipline in the IDF: \\"Discipline is indivisible. For example, a soldier who becomes accustomed in time of peace not to observe the minor rules, such as in matters of personal appearance, without being alerted to this failure by his superior officer, will in the end be negligent in carrying out operational orders.\\"Laqueur, Page 494. As a response to the Commission's criticism of using military intelligence as the sole route for analysis of information, the Foreign Ministry established a Research and Planning Department.Eban, page 579. Despite this, five years later the 29th Comptrollers Report into the conduct of the IDF during Operation Litani, which left 21 IDF soldiers dead, concluded that conditions remained the same as in 1973. The Report's author was Yitzhak Nebenzahl, a member of the Agranat Commission.Frankel, page 117. Published May 1979. The full text of the report, except for 48 pages, was made public 1 January 1995.Agranat Commission lexicon entry Knesset website Critique of the report The findings of the Agranat Commission have been the focus of sharp debate among the Israeli public up until today. Particular criticism relates to its exoneration of the country's political leadership, especially Defense Minister Dayan. According to the Report: \\"As long as he accepts the opinions of his advisers, he does not bear any personal responsibility.\\" Further criticism responds to the Commission's recommendations, stemming from the failure of military intelligence to assess the Arab states' intent, that the IDF should not consider the intentions of hostile states, but rather their capacity for war. Thirty years later, Giora Eiland, head of the National Security Council, wrote: \\"Both the proscription against considering intent and the concentration on the prevention of threats‚Äîtwo central messages of the Agranat Commission [Report]‚Äîfrustrated and delayed the rebuilding and preparedness of the IDF for years.\\" References Further reading # The Yom Kippur War: The Epic Encounter That Transformed the Middle East by Abraham Rabinovich.

A classically trained pianist, Mazich became interested in playing the organ after hearing the classic Deep Purple album Machine Head; he also counts jazz organ pioneer Jimmy Smith as an influence. A veteran of several San Pedro, California cover bands, Mazich first met and worked with Watt in a project band Watt was involved with, The Madonnabes, which devoted itself to reinterpreting the songs of Madonna. From there, Watt asked Mazich and another Madonnabes member, drummer Jerry Trebotic, to help record a song for a 1998 compilation album benefiting Doctors Without Borders, under the group name Mike Watt & Masina. In 2002, Mazich was asked to join Watt as organist in a new band that would record and tour behind Watt's third solo album, The Secondman's Middle Stand. His initial tours with Watt in 2002 and 2003 would end several weeks early for him because of time constraints related to his day job at a pet food lab; by the fall of 2003 he was able to resign from the job and be able to work as a longshoreman in between Watt tours. For the first tour, Mazich used, almost unsuccessfully, a digital keyboard with a module that simulated an organ and rotating speaker. By the following tour, however, Mazich had self-customized for travel a Hammond B3 Organ which he used for subsequent touring and recording. Mazich joined Watt in recording The Secondman's Middle Stand in January and February 2004; the album was released in October of that year. Mazich proceeded to fulfill a lifelong dream of his when he became an endorsee of Hammond Organs during the tour. Mazich's work ethic and love for music led Mike Watt to point out almost frequently that Mazich was his \\"rock\\", adding that the name Peter happens to come from the Greek word for \\"rock\\", pietros. Mazich continues to play with Watt & The Secondmen's original lineup for special Los Angeles-area gigs. He is also leading his own band, Johnny Angry. The group had started under the name Pipe, only to discover that another band was using that name. They then went with AMF (Angry Mother Fuckers) but changed to their present collective moniker to avoid legal conflicts with the AMF known for its bowling equipment and centers. Johnny Angry released a self- titled EP in 2006. Johnny Angry later became The Angry upon release of their first self-titled Album in October 2009 on Shab Records. The band later disbanded it May 2010 after the death of bass player Scott Cieszki in February of that same year. Mazich has been married twice; he lives in San Pedro with his second wife, Ljiljana Nikolovska, a former pop star in her native Croatia and former Yugoslavia. He has two teenage daughters from his first marriage and a son in his present union.

It is owned and operated by MGM Resorts International. The Beau Rivage hotel is the tallest building in Mississippi. The term 'Beau Rivage' is French for 'beautiful shore'; the original, well-known hotels of that name are the Beau- Rivage Geneva and Beau-Rivage Palace, both in Francophone Switzerland. History The land entrance side of the Beau Rivage, as seen pre-Katrina in 2002 The name of Beau Rivage was originally meant for the Bellagio casino resort on the Las Vegas Strip, however, developer Steve Wynn of Mirage Resorts changed Beau Rivage into Bellagio, and reserved this name for his new waterfront casino in Biloxi. The Beau Rivage, with 1,740 rooms, opened in March 1999. At that time of its opening, it was the largest hotel/casino in the United States outside of Nevada. The casino was located on a series of floating barges as required by local law confining all casinos to mobile marine vessels at the time of the resort's construction. The hotel, restaurants, parking garage, and associated facilities were constructed on land. The height of the 29-floor hotel-casino is . Beau Rivage was seriously damaged by the storm surge caused by Hurricane Katrina on August 29, 2005, and was rebuilt by W.G. Yates & Sons Construction (the contractor that originally built it) and more than 50 subcontractors. Beau Rivage Resort & Casino re- opened its entire resort August 29, 2006 ‚Äî the one-year anniversary of Hurricane Katrina. Although the hotel tower survived relatively unscathed, the casino barge was significantly damaged. Beau Rivage was one of the few still recognizable buildings remaining on Biloxi's coast. In the weeks following Hurricane Katrina and in the wake of the catastrophic damage to the coast's casinos in the hurricane, the Mississippi state legislature changed its laws regarding the placement of casinos. Instead of having to be on barges on the water, casinos may now be built on land as long as they are within of the shore.Mississippi Gaming Regulations (2013) Part 2, Chapter 1, Rule 1.4‚ÄîGaming Site Approval Retrieved 2013-08-01 In November 2006, the resort opened a new Tom Fazio-designed championship golf course named Fallen Oak. In 2009 there were news reports that Beau Rivage's parent company MGM Mirage had hired investment firm Morgan Stanley to assist the company in finding possible buyers for the Biloxi property and its cousin the MGM Grand Detroit. The Beau Rivage and MGM Grand Detroit were considered to be MGM Mirage's top performing properties and if sold could fetch a total of $1‚Äì$2 billion which then would be used to lower MGM Mirage's debt load.MGM Mirage Said to Hire Morgan Stanley to Evaluate Casino Bids Archived copy (bloomberg.com)With Casino Stocks, Traders Know When to Fold 'Em (The Wall Street Journal) In the event, no sale happened.

Historically, it is known for repelling the Turkish attack in 1552 during the Siege of Eger.  History  The Eger Castle on Georg Hoefnagel's map The first castle was built on the high hill named V√°rhegy at Fels≈ët√°rk√°ny near Eger. During the Mongol invasion in 1241, this castle was ruined, and the bishop of Eger moved it to a rocky hill in the city of Eger. On the hill, a new castle was built, and it developed rapidly. In 1470 a Gothic palace was built. In 1552, a Turkish army of 35,000-40,000 soldiers attacked the castle which had 2,100-2,300 defenders. The siege failed as the Turks suffered heavy casualties. A total of 1,700 of the defenders survived. After that Turks besieged the castle again in 1596, resulting in a Turkish victory. In 1701, the Austrians exploded half of the castle (the K√ºls≈ë v√°r). Archaeological excavations only started in 1925 and the castle was used by the army as barracks until 1957.

Heritage centres typically differ from most traditional museums in featuring a high proportion of \\"hands-on\\" exhibits and live or lifelike specimens and practical artifacts. Some are open-air museums ‚Äì heritage parks ‚Äì devoted to depiction of daily life or occupational activity at a particular time and place, and may feature re-creations of typical buildings of an era. Such sites are often used for experimental archaeology, and as shooting locations for documentaries and historical-fiction films and television. A few are rebuilt archaeological sites, using the excavated foundations of original buildings, some restore historic structures that were not yet lost, while others are mock-ups built near actual sites of historic value (which may still be subject to ongoing excavation, study, and preservation). Many also have living museum features, such as costumed staff, demonstrations of and short courses in historical craft-working, dramatic presentations (live-action mock combat, etc.), and other living history activities. Others may be more narrowly focused on a particular occupation or industry, such as rail transport or the early factories or mines around which a community developed.

Morales suffered an ankle injury on May 29, 2010, during a celebration of his walk-off grand slam, which kept him out of Major League Baseball for nearly two years. In April 2012, Morales returned to the Angels' line-up for the season opener against the Kansas City Royals. Morales has also played first base and right field during his MLB career. Cuban career Morales played in Cuba's equivalent of the North American Triple-A level. With 16- to 17-year-olds in the category, he was the first starter of the pitching staff, and fourth in the batting order, and had the ability to hit home runs from both sides of the plate. Morales joined the Cuban national baseball team in 2002 and immediately became a star player‚Äîdespite being the first teenager to make the team in nearly 20 years. He was the cleanup hitter on the team during its dramatic 2003 World Cup championship. His grand slam in the final round against Taiwan secured a 6‚Äì3 Cuban victory, one game after hitting a home run that provided the winning runs against Brazil. In his first--of two and a half--full season with Havana's Industriales of the Cuban National Series, in 2002, Morales had a batting average of .324 with 21 home runs and 82 RBI, and pitched in a game during the regular season, setting seven rookie records in the process (including HR and RBI); and obviously becoming Rookie of the Year, being considered the best rookie in the history of Cuban baseball. In his second season, he suffered an injury and did not hit as many home runs as in his rookie season, but he finished with a .391 batting average. Morales' stardom in Cuba was short-lived, however. He was sent back to Cuba from Panama during the Olympic qualifying round in November 2003 for making contact with an agent. It was the last time he would suit up as a Cuban. Moving to the United States By early 2004, Cuba's national team and the Industriales banned Morales from their teams for disciplinary reasons due to their belief that he had met with people in an attempt to flee the nation. Morales denies this accusation, telling a reporter \\"That's not true. I never talked to any agent. But from that moment on, I just wanted to leave. I tried to do it several times without success, occasionally ending up in jail.\\" He escaped on a raft in June 2004 to the shores of southern Florida, his eighth attempt at escape. But, as is the usual practice of defectors, he chose to leave the country to establish foreign residency so as to avoid the MLB draft. He left once again, this time to the Dominican Republic, where he was privately scouted by several Major League teams. Preston G√≥mez, in his role as consultant to Angels general manager Bill Stoneman, ended up signing him to a six-year deal worth $3 million dollars up front in December 2004. Morales played winter ball for the Estrellas Orientales Dominican team to keep himself in game shape. Professional career =Minor league career= By the spring of 2005, the Angels hoped to have Morales practice in the Cactus League to get ready for a quick ascension through their farm system or possibly even make the team as the designated hitter. Because he was not yet a citizen, the Dominican government held up granting Morales the necessary passport to fly back to the U.S. for several months. He was not able to get all his paperwork in order until late May and he finally made his minor league debut on May 21 for the Single-A Rancho Cucamonga Quakes. After three weeks (his batting average was .344, with five home runs), he was moved up to Double-A Arkansas, where he was second on the team in home runs despite playing there for only half the season. When that season ended, he was chosen by the Angels to play for the Surprise Scorpions of the Arizona Fall League. =Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim= Morales had a strong spring training in 2006 for the Angels, but failed to make the 25-man roster. He ultimately made his Major League debut on May 23, 2006, playing first base and going 3-for-5, including a home run in his second at bat, versus the Texas Rangers. Thereafter he performed well enough to be the Angels' regular first baseman until his eventual demotion back to Triple-A on July 23, 2006. Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim in 2012 2009 season Morales enjoyed a breakout year in his first full season. He hit 34 home runs and slugged .569, ranking second in the AL, behind eventual AL MVP Joe Mauer. Morales was promoted to starting first baseman after Mark Teixeira (the Angels' first baseman for the 2008 season) left the Angels as a free agent in the winter of 2008. Morales said of the timing of his promotion, \\"The guys that played ahead of me were seasoned players, and I didn't deserve to play in the big leagues yet. The one thing I thought about -- not how long I had to wait -- was just to concentrate on playing well once that opportunity came.\\" He hit well in the first half, and hit extremely well in the second half of 2009, and was named AL Player of the Month in August when he drove in 33 runs in 28 games with 10 homers, batting .385 and slugging .734. His performance led to talk of him being a possible American League MVP, eventually placing 5th in MVP voting behind Mauer, Teixeira, Derek Jeter, and Miguel Cabrera. 2010 season Morales hit a walk-off grand slam off Brandon League to end a 10-inning 5-1 victory over the Seattle Mariners at Angel Stadium of Anaheim on May 29, 2010. Approaching his celebrating teammates, he jumped up with the intention of stomping on home plate instead of simply stepping on it. His awkward landing resulted in a fracture in his lower left leg, placing him immediately on the disabled list. The injury required surgery, and he missed the rest of the 2010 season. In 51 games in the 2010 season, Morales hit .290 with 11 home runs and 39 RBIs. 2011 season On May 11, 2011, it was announced that Morales, still sidelined by his injured ankle from 2010, would miss the whole 2011 season due to complications in his rehabilitation from surgery on the ankle. 2012 season On March 22, 2012, nearly two years after his ankle injury, Morales returned to the lineup in a spring training game against the Kansas City Royals. On April 16, he hit his first home run since his 2010 injury. On July 30, 2012, Morales hit two home runs in the same inning (once left handed and the other right handed). He became only the third player in MLB history to homer both left and right in the same inning. He finished the 2012 season with a .273 batting average, 22 home runs, and 73 RBI. =Seattle Mariners= Seattle Mariners in 2013 On December 19, 2012, the Angels traded Morales to the Seattle Mariners for pitcher Jason Vargas. On June 23, 2013, Morales hit a first-pitch three run home run in the 10th inning against the Oakland Athletics after subbing for Brendan Ryan, leading to a 6-3 Mariners win at Safeco Field. After rounding the bases, he gently stepped on home plate. On July 2, 2013, he hit two home runs and had 6 RBIs in a 9-2 win over the division-leading Texas Rangers. On August 26, 2013, Morales was claimed off waivers by an unknown team; however, he was not traded within 48 hours of the waiver claim, meaning the Mariners pulled him back from waivers. On September 4, Morales hit a walk-off two-run homer off the Kansas City Royals to win the game 6-4 in the ninth inning.

History In 1965, the Ford Foundation brought together a group of educators from around the United States. Prescott College was the result of this gathering. The college was originally built in 1966 on outside of Prescott, Arizona. In 1974 the college went bankrupt due to poor fiscal management and the loss of anticipated donor funds. A core of determined faculty and students refused to see the college fold, and after a series of emergency meetings, formed the Prescott Center for Alternative Education. This earned the school national publicity as \\"The College That Wouldn't Die.\\" During the spring semester of 1975, classes were held in the basement of the historic Hassayampa Hotel in downtown Prescott, Arizona, as well as in the homes of both faculty and students. Over the succeeding years, the college was able to regain the legal right to the name Prescott College and acquire property and buildings for its main campus. Prescott College has an agroecology program at Jenner Farm, an international center in Kino Bay, Mexico, programs in regenerative design in partnership with the Ecosa Institute, the Prescott College Art Gallery at Sam Hill Warehouse and the college also has a Tucson, Arizona location. Most of the Prescott location buildings are repurposed buildings, converted to classrooms from stores and offices. The Village residence hall has a townhouse style housing groups of 7‚Äì8 students with shared common areas. The Crossroads Center is built from reclaimed timber, Corten steel, compressed earth with solar panels and rooftop gardens. It houses the Crossroads Cafe, classrooms, meeting facilities, the Fanon Center, the college library as well as computer labs. Academics There are four general degree programs at Prescott College: the Resident Undergraduate Program (RU), Limited-Residency Undergraduate Program (LRU), the Resident Masters and Limited-Residency Masters Program (RM/LRM), and a Limited-Residency Ph.D. program (PhD) in Sustainability Education.http://www.prescott.edu/learn/phd-sustainability- education/index.html Within the resident undergraduate program, students can earn a Bachelor of Arts, a Bachelor of Science in Environmental Studies, or a Bachelor of Fine Arts in Creative Writing, Visual Arts or Interdisciplinary Arts & Letters. Resident students live in Prescott and attend classes at the main campus. Students enrolled in the Limited-Residency program work with community based mentors and Prescott College faculty. Prescott College was an early adopter of Prior Learning Assessment and in 2014 was certified as a Veteran Supportive Campus by the Arizona Department of Veterans Services. The college was the first private college in Arizona to receive such a designation. The college uses the system of narrative evaluation in addition to or as a substitute for the conventional grading system of A-F letter grades. =Resident undergraduate degree program= Resident undergraduate students begin with a three-week orientation in Arizona's wilderness, known as wilderness orientation. In their first week, students are introduced to the college and gather supplies before being sent out in groups of 7‚Äì14 people, depending on the size of the incoming class. The average distance covered varies from 50‚Äì100 miles. There are also options for a community-based orientation where students explore and are educated about their surrounding environment. =Limited residency degree programs = Students may also choose the limited residency program which allows one to attend a colloquium (or series of such) on campus once a year, work with a primary faculty adviser and a mentor(s) who is usually based in the student's home community. This allows for the student to study from home in a community based setting. Programs are offered for the bachelor's degree, the master's degree and even a Ph.D using this limited residency model. =Degree plan= Students design a degree plan by the beginning of their junior year. Prescott College students fulfill basic requirements (such as math and writing) and then design their Competence (like a major) and Breadth (like a minor). The degree plan is submitted to the student's Individual Graduation Committee (IGC) for review. The IGC consists of at least one faculty member, and another faculty member and a student if desired. The committee will then edit and suggest classes that are needed to enhance and complete the Competence and Breadth. A student's course of study will fall under one of the following: Adventure Education (AE), Arts and Humanities (AH), Education (EDU), Environmental Studies and Sustainability (ESS), Psychology and Counseling (PSC) or Cultural and Regional Studies (CRS). Some examples of student degree plans would be: \\"Environmental Studies with a competence in Ecology and a breadth in Chemistry\\" or \\"Global Studies with a competence in Latin American Cultures and a breadth in Psychology\\". =Resident undergraduate senior project= To graduate from the college, each student must design and complete a senior project. Some examples include: The creation of Butte Creek Restoration Council, HUB (helping understand bicycles), The Ripple Repeat Project (campus thrift store), The Latin American Studies Scholarship Endowment Fund, The Freedom of Education Fund, an internship relevant to a student's Competence, or a research paper. A student must rigorously justify the project as proof of competence in their field of study. Accreditation Prescott College is accredited by The Higher Learning Commission of the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools and the Association for Experiential Education. The college's Teacher Education Program is approved by the Arizona State Board of Education and the National Association of State Directors of Teacher Education and Certification (NASDTEC). Consortium relationships Prescott College has stand-alone student exchange relationships with Telemark University College in Norway, the Ecosa Institute in Prescott, the SOS Conservation Project, and Sail Caribbean, that permit students to study as visitors at other institutions while maintaining enrollment and paying tuition to Prescott. Prescott College is a member of the Eco League, a five-college consortium of colleges with environmental studies programs: Alaska Pacific University, Green Mountain College (now closed), Northland College, and College of the Atlantic and, since January 2014, Dickinson College in Carlisle, Pennsylvania. The consortium is unique in that each college is in a different geographic area. Prescott College is also a member of Center for International Environmental Law (CIEL), a public interest, not-for-profit environmental law firm founded in 1989 in the US to strengthen international and comparative environmental law and policy around the world. Student life  In fall 2012, the college completed a $7.4M on-campus sustainable housing project, the Village, to accommodate up to 104 first-year students. The Village is a LEED Platinum certified facility that consists of 13 new multi-story townhome style apartment units, for up to eight students in each three-level unit. Most other students reside in nearby apartments, condos, and houses. From 2013‚Äì2016 Prescott College rented out one of its Village buildings to Embry-Riddle University. In 2016 a student-led initiative resulted in the acquisition of the Frantz Fanon Community Strategy Center for use for student and community organizing and club meetings. Groups that currently meet in the Frantz Fanon Community Strategy Center include the Queer Student Union, The Advocates for Responsible Sexual Culture, the Black Student Union, Mi Familia (a Latino and indigenous group), Yavapai County Planned Parenthood, and others. These clubs have successfully organized many events and demonstrations at Prescott College, and in the community. The Frantz Fanon Community Strategy Center also includes a zine library, a food pantry, a kitchen, and multiple classroom spaces. Prescott College Activists were also able to successfully institute a $30 semester fee to support the Freedom Education Fund scholarship for undocumented immigrants seeking to attend university. Prescott College President John Flicker has said of this project ‚ÄúI am proud that our students take on the role of scholar activists‚Äù. The College also has a Student Activity Center (SAC) which is used by a variety of individual students and clubs to hold meetings and interact. The space is also utilized for the Student Union Board (SUB meetings and includes a lounge area, kitchen area and the Max and Bessie Bakal Memorial Lounge and Library. =Athletics= Prescott College has a mountain biking team registered with USA Cycling that offers scholarships. Most athletics are intramural in general, since the college curriculum is centered on field-based immersion courses.

It was released by the Sanctuary Records Group and Columbia Records on January 26, 2004 in the United States. Do You Know \\"straddles between contemporary gospel and inspirational R&B;\\" and is described as portraying \\"a more intimate side of Michelle\\". It contains a greater percentage of mid and up-tempo songs, along with a much heavier and grander use of live instrumentation. Williams contributed lyrically to the album as she did with her debut album, co-writing a total of six songs. However, Do You Know is much more diverse, lyrically, than its predecessor Heart to Yours, covering the themes of \\"spiritual\\" and \\"carnal\\" love and contains retrospective songs about Williams' career thus far, whilst still retaining the inspirational and encouraging lyrics that characterised Heart to Yours. In the US, Do You Know found fair success on Billboard's component charts; peaking at number two on the Gospel Albums chart, number three on the Christian Albums chart and number twenty-eight on the Top R&B;/Hip-Hop Albums chart. However, the album peaked at one-hundred-and-twenty on the Billboard 200, making it Williams' lowest-charting album. Though the album was well received by critics, it sold only 10,000 copies in its first week of release. Despite this, the album was later re-released, including two new tracks and has now sold over 78,000 copies in the US alone as of 2008. The album gained Williams a nomination for \\"Best Gospel Act\\" at the 2004 MOBO Awards. Background and composition Solange Knowles (pictured) co-wrote and co- produced \\"The Movement\\". After becoming the first member of Destiny's Child to release a solo album in 2002, Williams did not wait long to start work on its follow-up in 2003. Due to the success of Heart to Yours, which topped the US Top Gospel Albums and became the best-selling gospel album of 2002, anticipation was high for Williams' second album. Before taking over the lead role in the Broadway musical Aida on November 18, 2003, Williams began working on the album, involving an even greater variety of producers than she did for her debut album such as trio PAJAM, made up of Paul Allen, J. Moss and Walter Kearney, duo Dawkins & Dawkins, Tommy Sims, bandmate Beyonc√© Knowles, her sister Solange Knowles, and Williams' brother Erron Williams. As with her debut, Williams contributed greatly to the songwriting of the album, co- writing a total of six tracks on the album. Prior to Unexcpecteds release, Williams told MTV that she couldn't \\"wait for the world to hear [her] new solo album\\", describing it as \\"fresher\\", \\"more inspirational\\", and \\"more on the secular side\\". Furthermore, she stated \\"whether it's gospel or not, I wrote about it\\", therefore expecting \\"some of her gospel fans to be a little upset\\" but wanted to \\"keep it real\\". She also discussed one of the album's primary themes ‚Äì \\"what it's like to be in love\\" ‚Äì explaining \\"[I talk about] mistakes you make when you're in love and how they affect your life\\" after saying \\"I was able to experience some things this year and I wrote about them.\\" In describing the album during another interview, this time for GospelCity, Williams said \\"these songs are just about the real me\\" and that she \\"just wrote from [her] heart\\" before acknowledging that \\"it didn't turn out to be as 'gospel-ly' as some would have liked\\", but \\"the stuff\\" that's on the album \\"is stuff [she] went through\\". Williams then said \\"this whole album is about God's love and me\\". After being asked \\"Michelle, as people listen to the album, Do You Know, as they get acquainted with the songs, what are you hoping to bring to their lives?\\", Williams responded \\"That everybody live in peace and not settle for anything less than what the Lord wants to bring your way. I know what I went through, I know God is taking me to another level. I had people around me that were not going where I was going ‚Äì I had to release them from my life.\\" Critical reception Critical reviews of the album were generally favorable. Kwaku of Cross Rhythms wrote that \\"Michelle seems happy to produce music which straddles between contemporary gospel and inspirational R&B;\\" and thus \\"she certainly isn‚Äôt going to have problems facing the congregation when she attends church\\". Sony of Gospel City described the album as a \\"beautifully written [...] very wonderfully produced gospel album that in some places is a throwback to a Duke Ellington jazz minuet, in others it's a fast paced hip-hop laced gospel after-party, and in others it's a beautiful testimony of a woman at the well\\" He then went on to comment that \\"the true highlight of this album is Michelle's unique, yet beautiful, timbre and her magnificent song writing.\\" Caroline Sullivan of The Guardian however gave a more mixed review, commenting that Do You Know? \\"doesn't provide the running start\\" that Williams \\"needs\\". She then noted that \\"Williams's strength is a shimmery jazz lilt. Emily Sogn of PopMatters likened Williams' \\"pleasingly slow paced\\" singing style to pop contemporaries like Ashanti and Janet Jackson and described the album as \\"a decent, yet not spectacular sophomore effort\\", noting that \\"while it might not enough to ensure her a successful career outside of her contributions to Destiny's Child, it isn‚Äôt without its particular merits and shining moments\\". People magazine commented that \\"there is a contemporary R&B; sound\\" to the album \\"that wouldn't be out of place on secular radio\\" and noted that \\"The Movement\\" \\"has a hip-hop vibe, while glossy ballads like \\"The Way of Love\\" sound like they could be Destiny's Child slow jams\\". Entertainment Weekly editor Chris Willman rated the album B- and highlighted the artistic growth on the album. Comparing it to its predecessor he wrote \\"this second solo foray into contemporary spirituals vastly improves upon her godforsaken 2002 debut\\" and that \\"both the beats and girlish chops feel more seasoned, even if she'll always be more R&B; minimalist than the gospel powerhouse she aspires to be\\". AllMusic wrote that \\"working with a wide array of producers [...] Williams is subtly more up-tempo than on her debut.\\" The staff found that the songs \\"all point to an artist with a considerable amount of self-assurance. Not surprisingly, Williams is never far from the roots that extend back to her day job in Destiny's Child.\\" Release and performance First released on January 26, 2004, Do You Know preceded the release of Destiny's Child's fourth and final regular studio album Destiny Fulfilled, making Williams the only member of the group to release more than one solo album in the group's hiatus. Williams promoted the album during various TV appearances and live performances, some of the most notable include; live performances of \\"Do You Know\\" (the album's first single) and \\"Purpose In Your Storm\\" on various TBN programs and a live performance of a newly arranged version of \\"The Way of Love\\" on Regis & Kelly. Notably, Williams also performed \\"Do You Know\\" live on the 2004 Soul Train Music Awards and throughout the Destiny Fulfilled ... And Lovin' It world concert tour ‚Äì which visited 16 countries throughout Australia, Asia, Europe, and North America with 67 dates in total. A video and audio recording of one such performance of \\"Do You Know\\", recorded in Atlanta was included on the Destiny's Child: Live in Atlanta 2006 DVD release, which has since been re-issued on Blu-ray. \\"Do You Know\\" was also promoted with the filming and release of a music video for the song. Like its predecessor, Do You Know achieved its greatest commercial success on Billboard's component charts. Almost topping the Gospel Albums chart, the album peaked at number two, where it had its longest chart run, staying on the chart for 20 weeks, resulting in its placement at number twenty-five on Billboards Year-End Gospel Albums chart. Meanwhile, the album peaked at number three on Billboards Christian Albums chart, remaining on the chart for six weeks and peaked at number twenty-eight on the Top R&B;/Hip-Hop Albums chart, where it spent a total of five weeks. However, Do You Know only managed to hold one week on the main US albums chart ‚Äì the Billboard 200 ‚Äì where it peaked at number one- hundred-and-twenty. According to Billboard.com, as of 2008, the album has sold 78,000 copies.

France and Japan have enjoyed a very robust and progressive relationship spanning centuries through various contacts in each other's countries by senior representatives, strategic efforts, and cultural exchanges. After nearly two centuries of seclusion by \\"Sakoku\\" in Japan, the two countries became very important partners from the second half of the 19th century in the military, economic, legal and artistic fields. The Tokugawa shogunate (Bakufu) modernized its army through the assistance of French military missions (Jules Brunet), and Japan later relied on France for several aspects of its modernization, particularly the development of a shipbuilding industry during the early years of the Imperial Japanese Navy (L√©once Verny , √âmile Bertin), and the development of a Legal code. France derived part of its modern artistic inspiration from Japanese art, essentially through Japonism and its influence on Impressionism, and almost completely relied on Japan for its prosperous silk industry.

Marine Invertebrates of the Pacific Northwest. 2nd. Seattle: University of Washington Press, 1996. This cnidarian hosts endosymbiotic algae called zooxanthellae that contribute substantially to primary productivity in the intertidal zone.Fitt, W. K., R. L. Pardy, AND M. M. Luttker. 1982. Photosynthesis, respiration, and contribution to community productivity of the symbiotic sea anemone Anthopleura elegantissima. J. Exp. Mar. Biol. Ecol. 61: 213‚Äì232. The aggregating anemone has become a model organism for the study of temperate cnidarian-algal symbioses. Description Anthopleura elegantissima in the process of cloning itself The polyps of the aggregating anemone reach up to eight cm across the oral disk with approximately 100 tentacles in three or four rows around the margins of the oral disk. Most are olive to bright green (depending on the species of algal symbionts present) with tentacles tipped in pink. Individuals that live in microhabitats that are deficient in photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), such as under docks or in caves, lack symbionts and are pale yellow to white in color.Secord D, Muller-Parker G (2005) Symbiont distribution along a light gradient within an intertidal cave. Limnology and Oceanography 50: 272‚Äì278 Range Pacific coast of North America from Alaska, United States to Baja California, Mexico. Life history This species of anemone is capable of reproducing both sexually and asexually. As adults, aggregating anemones release gametes into the water that join to form genetically unique individuals that settle on intertidal rock. This genetically distinct individual can then proliferate through binary fission. Some argue that this is not true reproduction but actually a form of growth.Pearse, J.S., Pearse, V.B. & Newberry, A.T. 1989. Telling sex from growth: dissolving Maynard Smith's paradox. Bulletin of Marine Science. 45:433‚Äì436. Fission is often prompted in the autumn by a decrease in the abundance of food and follows sexual spawning in summer.Sebens, K.B. 1980. The regulation of asexual reproduction and indeterminate body size in the sea anemone Anthopleura elegantissima (Brandt). Biological Bulletin. 158:370‚Äì382Sebens, K.B. 1981b.

Journal of Experimental Marine Biology and Ecology. 54:225‚Äì250. Over time, a single individual can generate a large colony of genetically identical polyps. Because of its ability to grow in this manner, the genetic entity of a colony is potentially immortal on an ecological time scale. Natural history =Photosynthetic symbiosis= Aggregating anemones host endosymbiotic, photosynthetic algae in their tentacles, oral disk and column of the polyps. In addition to a chlorophyte, two species of dinoflagellate Symbiodinium, S. muscatinei and S. californium are known to inhabit the anemone.Muller-Parker G, Pierce-Cravens J, Bingham BL (2007) Broad thermal tolerance of the symbiotic dinoflagellate Symbiodinium muscatinei (Dinophyta) in the sea anemone Anthopleura elegantissima (Cnidaria) from northern latitudes. Journal of Phycology 43:25‚Äì31 These algae are generally referred to as zooxanthellae (dinoflagellates) and zoochlorellae (chlorophytes) and many polyps concurrently host more than one type of alga within their tissues. The rate of occurrence of each alga is determined by temperature and light regimes of anemone habitats.SAUNDERS, B., AND G. MULLER-PARKER. 1997. The effects of temperature and light on two algal populations in the temperate sea anemone Anthopleura elegantissima (Brandt, 1835). J. Exp. Mar. Biol. Ecol. 211: 213‚Äì224. Zoochlorellae are typically found at higher latitudes and in deeper intertidal habitats than zooxanthellae.Secord D, Augustine L (2000) Biogeography and microhabitat variation in temperate algal-invertebrate symbioses: zooxanthellae and zoochlorellae in two Pacific intertidal sea anemones, Anthopleura elegantissima and A. xanthogrammica. Invertebrate Biology 119:139‚Äì146 Of the two species of zooxanthellae that inhabit the anemone, S. californium is restricted to southern California due to its intolerance of cold temperatures whereas S. muscatinei is tolerant of a broad range of temperature and irradiance levels. Mycosporine-2-glycine, a mycosporine-like amino acid (MAA) The mutualistic relationship of these organisms requires adaptations of each partner. The algal symbionts convert inorganic carbon into carbohydrates for use by each partner and release oxygen to the animal host in the process. To accommodate the algae, the anemone must provide concentrated carbon dioxide to their intracellular photosynthetic guests as well as photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) to fuel the photosynthetic process. This restricts the symbiotic organism to euphotic habitats and requires consistent exposure to high levels of ultraviolet radiation (UVR). To protect from potentially damaging UVR, the algae provide mycosporine-like amino acids (MAAs) that act as sunscreen for themselves and the host.Shick, J. M., W. C. Dunlap, J. S. Pearse, and V. B. Pearse. 2002. Mycosporine-like amino acid content in four species of sea anemones in the genus Anthopleura reflects phylogenetic but not environmental or symbiotic relationships. Biol. Bull. 203: 315‚Äì330. The anemones, in turn, produce antioxidants called superoxide dismutases to protect against reactive oxygen that causes oxidative stress.Dykens, J. A. and J. M. Shick. 1982. Oxygen production by endosymbiotic algae controls superoxide dismutase activity in their animal host. Nature 297:579‚Äì580.Dykens, J. A., J. M. Shick, C. Benoit, G. R. Buettner, and G. W. Winston. 1992. Oxygen radical production in the sea anemone Anthopleura elegantissima and its endosymbiotic algae. J. Exp. Biol. 168:219‚Äì41. =Agonism between colonies= Territorial battle between anemones The aggregating anemone is agonistic toward other individuals with different genetic disposition. When one colony of genetically identical polyps encounters a different genetic colony, the two will wage territorial battles. Aggregating anemones have specialized tentacles called acrorhagi that are used solely to deter other colonies from encroaching on their space. When a polyp makes physical contact with a non-clonemate, it extends the acrorhagi to attack the competing anemone with stinging cells called nematocytes. Acrorhagi of the attacking anemone leave behind a 'peel' of the ectoderm and nematocysts that causes tissue necrosis in the receiving animals. A study of two colonies on a boulder removed from the shore and brought into a laboratory revealed that hostilities between neighboring colonies follow the tides. As water rushed into the tank, warrior polyps inflated their acrorhagi, tripled their body length and began reaching into an empty swath of rock between the colonies. Occasionally, a polyp from one of the colonies would move into the spatial zone between the two colonies, acting as a scout, and would be attacked by the warrior polyps of the other clone. If the scout polyp received enough stings, it would be attacked by its clonemates upon return to its own colony. The return of an attacked scout to the clone with acrorhagial peel may serve to communicate the presence and identity of neighboring clones to the interior of the colony.Ayre DJ, Grosberg RK (2005) Behind anemone lines: factors affecting division of labour in the social cnidarian Anthopleura elegantissima. Animal Behaviour 70:97‚Äì110 Predators The few known predators of the aggregating anemone include a species of nudibranch (Aeolidia papillosa), leather star, and mosshead sculpin.

Bjorlin was known for being one of the most active opera composers in the 20th century. Bj√∂rlin was born in Stockholm in 1933. He studied music with conductor Igor Markevitch in Salzburg, Austria at age 19 and later continued his studies at the Conservatoire de Paris, with teacher Nadia Boulanger. After completing his military service, he worked at the Royal Swedish Opera in Stockholm and at the Malm√∂ College of Music. From 1962, he was employed as musical producer at Sveriges Radio and wrote music for several movies and television productions, including the series of films and TV series about the children on the island Saltkr√•kan (Seacrow Island), based on Astrid Lindgren's scripts. He also worked as music director for many years under Ingmar Bergman at the Royal Dramatic Theatre in Stockholm. Bjorlin came to the United States in 1977. He served as guest conductor for the London Symphony and the Philadelphia Orchestra. He worked with Evert Taube, his neighbor from a very young age. Later, together with Sven-Bertil Taube, he also produced a number of recordings of songs by Carl Michael Bellman, Evert Taube and Ulf Peder Olrog. He conducted several recordings of orchestral music by fellow Swedes Johan Helmich Roman and Franz Berwald. During the last years before his death, he worked in Florida mostly, where he was conductor of the Greater Palm Beach Symphony (since 1987) and the Florida Philharmonic Orchestra. He had composed important work such as the \\"Musical Portrait of Raoul Wallenberg\\" in the years before his passing and several operas. He was known to be the most active opera composer in the world in the 20th century. In his days he recorded several albums for the EMI label. He died in Palm Beach, Florida at the age of 60. The cause was leukemia. Bj√∂rlin received among other prizes the Fritz Gustaf Grafstr√∂m Prize in 1961 and shared the Evert Taube Prize with Sven-Bertil Taube in 1975. He received the Swedish Music Achievement prize, In 1980, he received the 'Golden key' to the city of Newport, Rhode Island for his musical achievements and for bringing culture to their town.

It was designed by Roger Gohl, at the time a student at the Herron School of Art. The white star represents the Soldiers' and Sailors' Monument, and its centralization the fact that Indianapolis is the state capital of Indiana. The white circle and the red field within it depict Monument Circle. The color red also signifies \\"the driving energy and urge for progress that has made the City of Indianapolis race ahead.\\" The four white stripes represent North and South Meridian Streets vertically, and East and West Market Streets horizontally (the streets that radiate from Monument Circle), along with the city's unofficial motto, the Crossroads of America. The four quadrants of dark blue symbolize the residential areas of the city.Revised Code of the Consolidated City and County, Sec. 105-2 The colors of the flag are the same as the flag of the United States. The flag replaced the existing city flag that had been created in 1915. By 1962 city leaders thought that a more modern flag was needed, so the Indianapolis Chamber of Commerce sponsored a contest to create a new one, with a prize of $50 for the winning entry. The instructor in one of Gohl's classes at Herron required each member of the class to submit an entry. Gohl's winning entry had the circle and vertical stripe offset to the left rather than being centered; he was unaware of the change until he returned to visit the city in 1969. The city flag assumed a new role as the de facto, though not de jure, symbol of Marion County on January 1, 1970, when the City of Indianapolis and Marion County merged their respective governments. A 2004 survey of flag design quality by the North American Vexillological Association ranked Indianapolis's flag 8th best of 150 American city flags. It earned a score 8.35 out of 10.

It is sometimes called an \\"on the rise shot\\", or \\"short hop\\". Technique The player who is hitting the half volley should not take a full backswing, but should still follow through. The grip for this shot is a standard continental. Also, staying down when hitting the shot is very important, or else it will go long. This is the basic form for the volley, hence the name: half volley. The two parts of the tennis court where this shot is generally used are on the baseline and the service line. Strategy A half volley is a difficult shot to make. Often a player hits a half volley only when forced by the opponent or caught out of position. The half-volley came to prominence in the hands of George Caridia and Ernest Lewis in the early 1900s.The Times, Borora's Record, 23 Oct. 1935 Arguably the greatest half-volleyer in history is John McEnroe; other professionals such as Stefan Edberg, Pete Sampras and Roger Federer had excellent half volleys that were used as weapons. In his 1979 autobiography Jack Kramer devotes a page to the best tennis strokes he had ever seen. He writes: \\"HALF-VOLLEY‚ÄîGonzales and Rosewall. Kenny had to learn to hit a half- volley because his serve was so weak that he had to pick up shots at his feet as he came to the net.

Phyllitis scolopendrium) is an evergreen fern in the genus Asplenium, of the Northern Hemisphere. Description The plants are unusual in being ferns with simple, undivided fronds. The tongue-shaped leaves have given rise to the common name \\"Hart's tongue fern\\"; a hart being an adult male red deer. The sori pattern is reminiscent of a centipede's legs, and scolopendrium is Latin for \\"centipede\\". The leaves are 10‚Äì60 cm long and 3‚Äì6 cm broad, with sori arranged in rows perpendicular to the rachis. Taxonomy A. scolopendrium, with its close relative A. sagittatum, has also been placed in a segregate genus Phyllitis. A. scolopendrium forms hybrids with other Asplenium species, including those species sometimes classified in the separate genus Camptosorus, which is one reason that both Phyllitis and Camptosorus species are now generally included in Asplenium. On the other hand, a recent phylogenetic study of the family Aspleniaceae suggests that A. scolopendrium is only distantly related to other Asplenium species, and that the genus Phyllitis should again be recognized. Etymology The Latin specific epithet scolopendrium is derived from the Greek skolopendra, meaning a centipede or millipede. The underside of the fronds supposedly resembles those insects. Distribution and habitat Asplenium scolopendrium is a common diploid species in Europe. In North America it occurs in rare, widely scattered populations that have been given varietal status, A. scolopendrium var. americanum. Morphological differences are minor, but the North American populations are tetraploid. The plants grow on neutral and lime-rich substrates, including moist soil and damp crevices in old walls, most commonly in shaded situations but occasionally in full sun; plants in full sun are usually stunted and yellowish in colour, while those in full shade are dark green and luxuriant. The rare occurrences of the North American form in the southeastern US are found exclusively in sinkhole pits. These populations may be relics of cooler Pleistocene climates. In the United States, A. scolopendrium var. americanum was declared endangered in 1989. The reason that the European variety is relatively widespread, and the American variety a rarity, has apparently not been established. A third variety, A. scolopendrium var. lindenii, occurs in southern Mexico and Hispaniola. A. scolopendrium var. americanum grows in a small number of caves in the United States, two of them being in Alabama. One is Fern Cave, a public cave in Jackson County, Alabama, where it has declined heavily due to illegal plant collecting. The other is located at an undisclosed pit in Morgan County that is off limits due to the land around it being both protected by private landowners and the National Speleological Society. Uses =Cultivation= Asplenium scolopendrium is often grown as an ornamental plant, with several cultivars selected with varying frond form, including with frilled frond margins, forked fronds and cristate forms. The species has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit, as has the cultivar 'Angustatum'. The American variety is reputed to be difficult to cultivate, and even in North America most, if not all, cultivated plants are derived from the European forms. This book is a reprinting of =Herbal medicine= This fern was used in the 1800s as a medicinal plant in folk medicine as a spleen tonic and for other uses.

These edifices are associated with alternative worship and the emerging church movements, and seek to find new forms and approaches to existing as a church in the 21st century. These churches are often focused on relationship aspects of Christian fellowship and outreach to their local community, and use the modern gathering place of a caf√© in their ministry.  Cafe Church philosophy and planting churches  The cafe church can be viewed as an organically based philosophy for planting churches, centered around the idea of making the message of Christ's love relevant to the needs of the local community that the church seeks to serve. The Alma Mount Hope Coffeehouse Church, of Alma, MI, says: > \\"The ministry statement for AMH Coffeehouse Church is found in Acts 2:42: > 'And they continued steadfastly in the apostles' doctrine and fellowship, in > the breaking of bread, and in prayers.'\\" The goal of cafe church endeavors is to impact their local community with a message of God's love and the transforming power of Christ's love. Depending on the leadership, some cafe church leaders will provide a clear doctrinal perspective, while others may be more open-minded and comfortable with members and visitors asking questions of speakers. For example, One World Coffeehouse in Columbia, Maryland was founded by a church member who said, \\"I felt that our church needed an outreach effort ... and a way to express principles such as multiculturalism and acceptance of others different from yourself.\\" And the Glebe Caf√© Church, in New South Wales, Australia states that: > \\"Caf√© Church is a Glebe-based, non-traditional Christian faith community. We > aim to provide an inclusive, accepting and welcoming space for everybody, no > matter what their spiritual path. Caf√© Church revolves around open > discussion, creative expression and alternative approaches to worship. Our > core values include hospitality, creativity, discipleship and social and > environmental justice.\\"  Coffeehouse cafes vs. coffee as a Christian fellowship event  Churches using the cafe as a model for their organization can take different forms. Some cafe churches maintain a permanent cafe or restaurant, which offers the local community a high-quality array of coffee, sandwiches, and food, and provides a venue where the members of the church fellowship meet. Church members may also volunteer their time to support the enterprise. Other churches simply use the cafe model as a way to build community, facilitating variation within their normal service structure and within the confines of their building, by serving coffee after or during the service in a predesignated area, or holding a coffeehouse event.  Churches which operate coffeehouses and cafes  Ebenezer's Coffeehouse, in Washington, DC, operated by the National Community Church, is one example of a cafe church. Its website asks, \\"How much more comfortable can you get sipping a Chai in church?\\" This church is a multi-location church located at sites accessible by public transit, which links its indie music coffeehouse broadcasts to other locations via the Internet. Also located in Washington is the Potters House, an outreach ministry of the Church of the Savior. Its website states, \\"We, the members of that church, asked ourselves, 'Would Jesus want to hang out with folks at a traditional institutional church? or would he want to hang out over a beer in a bar or coffee in a restaurant?' The resounding answer was the latter. We chose coffee over beer because of our support for the budding AA movement in 1960.\\" The Abbey is a ministry of the Episcopal Diocese of Alabama which opened in Birmingham's Avondale neighborhood in 2015. After operating as both a coffeeshop and worshiping congregation for over four years, the coffeehouse was closed in summer 2019. The Abbey continues to operate a six-day-a-week ministry with pay-as-you-can breakfast on weekdays and Sunday worship services. An old congregation house of Oxford University, dating back to 1320, is home to The Vaults and Garden Cafe, operated by the University Church of St Mary the Virgin, which specializes in organically grown and locally sourced foods. The cafe serves the community by catering events, and donating funds. Another religious organization specializing in healthy food is the International Society for Krishna Consciousness, which runs a chain of vegetarian restaurants called Govinda's. The Loft coffeehouse, a project of Alamo Heights United Methodist Church, San Antonio, TX includes \\"a food bank, thrift store and a resource center for the needy.\\" Caf√© churches became more popular in the Christian community of South Korea around 2016, especially among younger Protestants, as an alternative to the traditional Korean megachurches' conservatism and perceived corruption.  History of church- sponsored coffeehouses and American folk music  Church-sponsored coffeehouses have a long history in the United States. For example, Nameless Coffeehouse has operated for over 50 years (since 1966) on the site of The First Parish Unitarian Universalist Church in Cambridge, MA. And fifty years ago, it was The Sacred Mushroom coffeehouse in Columbus, OH that hosted Phil Ochs; a local fan reminisced, \\"One of his first public performances as a solo artist was at the First Unitarian Universalist Church on Weisheimer Road, where he performed for a ladies luncheon,\\" she said with a laugh ... \\"God only knows the songs he performed there.\\" In fact, Unitarian Universalists are a denomination particularly known for sponsoring folk coffeehouses. > \\"The welcoming environment of Unitarian Universalist coffeehouses has > provided an artistic haven for a variety of performers and helped launch the > entertainment careers of folk musicians such as Pete Seeger and Arlo > Guthrie. Folk music is featured at The Old Ship Coffeehouse Off The Square, located in the parish house of Old Ship Church in Hingham, MA, (which is, incidentally, \\"the oldest English church in continuous use in America.\\"Old Ship Church, National Park Service .) The First Congregational Church in Branford, CT sponsors the Branford Folk Coffeehouse, a monthly folk music concert series held in its auditorium. Rowayton United Methodist Church, home to Good Folk Coffeehouse Mom & Pop's Coffeehouse, a folk concert series held in the sanctuary at United Christian Church in Levittown, PA, uses the altar as the stage, and has been held since 1994.

The forehand in tennis and other racket sports such as table tennis, squash and badminton is a shot made by swinging the racket across one's body with the hand moving palm-first. In tennis, except in the context of the phrase forehand volley, the term refers to a type of groundstroke--a stroke in which the ball has bounced before it is struck. It contrasts with the backhand, the other type of groundstroke. For a right-handed player, the forehand is a stroke that begins on the right side of the body, continues across the body as contact is made with the ball, and ends on the left side of the body. It is considered the easiest shot to master, perhaps because it is the most natural stroke. Beginners and advanced players often have better forehands than any other shots and use it as a weapon. Most forehands are hit with topspin because it helps keep the ball from landing outside the court. On some occasions, such as an approach shot, a player can opt to hit with backspin, which can also be called a 'slice'. Players with great forehands often build their main strategy around it. They set up a point until they have a good chance of striking a powerful forehand to win the point. A well-known tactic is to run around a ball on their backhand side in order to hit a forehand cross-court, called the inside-out forehand. Grips Moment after Rafael Nadal hitting a left-handed forehand at the 2010 US Open. There are four main grips for executing the forehand and their popularity has fluctuated over the years. They are the western, the semi-western, the eastern, and the continental. Some rarer grips include extreme-western or Hawaiian. =Western= The western was widely used in the first two decades of the 20th century. For a number of years the small, apparently frail 1920s player Bill Johnston was considered by many to have had the best forehand of all time, a stroke that he hit shoulder-high using a western grip. Few top players used the western grip after the 1920s, as many of them moved to the eastern and continental, but in the latter part of the 20th century, as shot- making techniques and equipment changed radically, the western forehand made a strong comeback and is now used by many modern players. Some consider it to be an extreme or radical grip, however. The maximum amount of topspin can be generated with this grip. Prominent exponents of the western grip include Kei Nishikori, Nadia Petrova, Lleyton Hewitt, Sania Mirza, Robin S√∂derling, Samantha Stosur, Jack Sock, and Andrea Petkovic. =Extreme-Western, \\"Hawaiian\\"= The extreme-western or Hawaiian grip is a very extreme tennis grip where the player places their knuckle past the 5th bevel on the tennis racket. It's considered by some to be too extreme for tennis, as the optimal strike zone for this grip is very high up and is suitable only for pure spin hitting. Indeed; flattening out a shot at that height is near impossible due to wrist constrictions, and so this grip is suited only for clay court specialists. However, some players are able to take advantage of this grip's massive spin generation due to their defensive play style or height, which allow them to hit the strike zone often. An example would be Florian Mayer. Other players that employ this extreme grip are Nick Kyrgios and Karen Khachanov. On the WTA tour, Anna-Lena Gr√∂nefeld and Am√©lie Mauresmo were well known for using the Hawaiian grip. The Extreme-Western is also known for causing arm and wrist problems if employed incorrectly. =Semi-Western= The semi-western grip is also widely used today, and falls in between the western and the eastern. It is popular with players who want to hit a fair amount of topspin, but still want to be able to flatten out the ball for finishing shots. It is currently the most popular forehand grip among ATP and WTA pros, with many top players employing this grip on their forehand. It can be further modified to be closer to a semi-eastern grip, or more extreme to a full- western grip depending on the player's profile and playing style. Many of the world's current players use this grip, such as Rafael Nadal, Novak Djokovic, Andy Murray, David Ferrer, Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, Venus and Serena Williams, Victoria Azarenka, Maria Sharapova, and countless other professional tennis players in today's modern game. =Eastern= The eastern grip widely replaced the western in the 1920s and thereafter was used by such World No. 1 players as Ellsworth Vines, Don Budge, and Jack Kramer, all of whom were considered to have very powerful forehands. Many beginners start with the eastern grip because of its comfortable feel. It is often described as shaking hands with the racquet. Forehands hit with the eastern can have either topspin or backspin, as the gripping hand is on the same plane as the racquet, and can thus be tilted up for topspin or down for backspin rather easily. Although rarer on the professional tour as it makes hitting topspin somewhat difficult, there are some notable players who use the eastern grip to great effect. Juan Mart√≠n del Potro is an excellent example of an eastern forehand user. Roger Federer is often noted as having an eastern grip, although his forehand lies somewhere in between semi-western and eastern.http://www.optimumtennis.net/roger-federer-forehand-grip.htm His power and versatility on the forehand side are commonly attributed to this twist on the forehand grip. WTA players who have utilised the eastern grip include Steffi Graf, Justine Henin, Petra Kvitov√°, Angelique Kerber, Ana Ivanovic, and Lindsay Davenport. =Continental= Serena Williams preparing to hit a forehand. The continental grip was popular with many Europeans of the 1920s and 1930s and with many Australians of the 1940s and 1950s. The continental has the advantage of being used for all strokes: serves, volleys, forehands, and backhands, without having to be shifted in the player's hand, as is the case with all the other grips. It is particularly well-suited for hitting low balls ‚Äî \\"taking the ball on the rise\\" ‚Äî but is generally considered inferior for most forehands. It is extremely rare for a modern professional player to utilize a \\"continental\\" grip, owing to the difficulty of topspin generation and poor ability to hit balls above the strike-zone, crucial in today's heavy topspin game. Richard Gasquet is an example of a player who uses the \\"continental\\" forehand, but he generally switches his grip over to a semi- western during his takeback process. Fred Perry, the great English player of the 1930s and 1940s was notable for his snap forehand using the continental grip and taking the ball on the rise. =Two-handed forehand= No matter which grip is used, most forehands are generally executed with one hand holding the racquet, but there have been fine players with two-handed forehands. In the 1940s and 50s the Ecuadorian/American player Pancho Segura used a two-handed forehand with devastating effect against larger, more powerful players. His frequent adversary and even greater player Jack Kramer has called it the single finest shot in the history of tennis. Ellsworth Vines, another great player, agreed. He wrote: \\"Two-handed forehand is most outstanding stroke in game's history; unbeatable unless opponent could avoid it.\\" Tennis: Myth and Method, by Ellsworth Vines and Gene Vier, Viking Press, New York, pages 65‚Äì66 Monica Seles also used a two-handed forehand very effectively, with 53 career titles that included 9 Grand Slam titles. Marion Bartoli won Wimbledon in 2013 with a two-handed forehand. Unusually, both players placed their dominant hand at the base of the racquet, resulting in a cross-handed stroke. Among current players Peng Shuai, Ayumi Morita, Yan Zi, and Aiko Nakamura employ two-handed forehands. Peng's forehand is also cross- handed. Some players will use a two-handed forehand when they need a sure-fire in. The constricted movement will generally generate less power, but more racket head control. Evolution The classical forehand where a player hit through the ball and finished their follow-through above the shoulder was the dominant forehand usage for most of tennis history. Players as recent as Pete Sampras and Andre Agassi used the classical forehand. With recent tennis racquet technology improvements, generating power has increasingly become easier and hence having more control has become an emphasis for current professional tennis players. This has resulted in the pro players now using a windshield wiper forehand where the follow-through ends up with the racquet ending across the body rather than over the shoulder. This enables more top spin to be imparted to the ball, thus controlling the extra power generated while still keeping the ball in court. Most pro players now use the windshield wiper forehand, with Rafael Nadal, Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic among other pro tennis players all employing the windshield wiper forehand. Notable forehands In his 1979 autobiography Jack Kramer, who had a great forehand himself, devotes a page to the best tennis strokes he had ever seen. He wrote: \\"FOREHAND‚ÄîSegura was best, then Perry, followed by Tilden and Vines (although I never saw Big Bill's till he was in his forties). Of the moderns, NƒÉstase's forehand is a superb one, especially on the run.\\". At a professional event in 1951, the forehand drives of a number of players were electronically measured. Pancho Gonzales hit the fastest, at 112.88 mph, followed by Casper Ruud at 109.98Djokovic-Ruud Rome 2020 semifinal, 1st set, 11th game, 177 Kmh, Jack Kramer at 107.8 and Welby Van Horn at 104.The History of Professional Tennis, Joe McCauley, page 57 In the 1980s, Ivan Lendl was famous for the smoothness of his forehand and his ability to strike the ball hard, no matter where he was standing on the court. Roger Federer has been noted to have the one of the greatest forehands in history, described as a \\"great liquid whip\\" by David Foster Wallace. The forehand has been used as a major weapon by many players for years. Amongst the male players, some of the notable players with great forehands are: * Bill Johnston * Bill Tilden * Ellsworth Vines * Fred Perry * Jack Kramer * Pancho Segura, the most noted of the 2-handed forehands * Ilie NƒÉstase * Ivan Lendl, whose forehand introduced a new type of power hitting tennis * Jim Courier * Pete Sampras, had a good running forehand * Andre Agassi * Sergi Bruguera, arguably the forehand with the most topspin before the evolution of the technology of the racquet. * Rafael Nadal, considered to have the modern forehand with the most topspin.

It is the administrative seat of the Rhein-Lahn rural district and is well known as a spa on the river Lahn. Bad Ems is the seat of the Verbandsgemeinde (administrative community) Bad Ems-Nassau. The town has around 9,000 inhabitants.  Geography  The town is located on both banks of the River Lahn, the natural border between the Taunus and the Westerwald, two parts of the Rhenish Slate Mountains. The town and its outer districts are situated within the Nassau Nature Reserve. History Plaque dedicated to Ems Ukaz in Bad Ems. In Roman times, a castrum was built at Bad Ems as part of the Upper Germanic Limes, but today not much of the structure remains. In the woods around the town, however, there are distinct traces of the former Roman border. The town was first mentioned in official documents in 880 and received its town charter in 1324. The Counts of Nassau and Katzenelnbogen rebuilt the bath and used it together with other noble visitors. In the 17th and 18th centuries Bad Ems was considered one of Germany's most famous bathing resorts. It reached its heyday in the 19th century when it welcomed visitors from all over the world and became the summer residence of various European monarchs and artists, including Kaiser Wilhelm I of Germany, Tsars Nicholas I and Alexander II of Russia, Richard Wagner, Fyodor Dostoevsky and Vasili Vasilyevich Vereshchagin, etc. In 1870, the town, then part of Prussian Hesse-Nassau, became known as the place where the Ems Dispatch originated, instigating the Franco-Prussian War. In 1876, in the Haus Vier T√ºrme (Four Tower House), the Ems Edict was signed by Alexander II of Russia, banning the use of the Ukrainian language. Today, a monument at the spot commemorates this historical event. =Mining= In the 19th and 20th centuries a lot of mining for metal ores took place in the town, concentrated on lead, silver, zinc and copper. The Romans had already dug for ores using open cast mining, which continued throughout the Middle Ages. The many indentations on Bl√∂skopf Hill bear witness to this period of history. As time went by, the method changed from open cast mining to underground mining with tunnels and shafts. Mining of this kind is first mentioned in a document dated 1158, and it continued on into the 18th century, although with long interruptions. The advent of the Industrial Revolution led to the expansion of the mine, which from 1871 operated under the name of Emser Blei- und Silberwerk AG (Bad Ems Lead and Silver Works, Inc.). In 1909 the company was taken over by what later became the Stolberger Zink AG (Stolberg Zinc Inc.) and mining continued until the end of the Second World War brought things to a halt in 1945. After the war, the mine no longer received any subsidies, but until 1959, stockpiled ore and ore from other mines were sorted at the central preparation plant in Silberau. Today, the mine is still known as \\"Mercur\\", the collective name for various individual pits. Since 1996, the mine has been set up as a museum.  Economy Industry in Bad Ems is mainly limited to companies related to its spa status, but nonetheless fairly varied, including medicine, electrical engineering and tourism. = Mineral springs = Natural Ems salt is produced from local mineral water. The spring's mineral water, noted for its very high mineral content, is also marketed separately for drinking and inhalation purposes; when inhaled using a vaporizer, the water has a beneficial effect on sore throats. Infrastructure =Transport= The town is linked to a view point at the Bismarckturm (Bismarck tower) by the Kurwaldbahn funicular railway. Bad Ems station lies on the Lahn Valley Railway. Governance =Mayor= The mayor of Bad Ems is Bernard Abt (SPD). =Town twinning= Bad Ems is twinned with: * Droitwich Spa (United Kingdom) * Lubin (Poland) * Cosne-Cours-sur-Loire (France) * Blankenfelde-Mahlow (Germany) Notable people =Sons and daughters of the town= Adolf Reichwein in 1944 (Volksgerichtshof) * 1888: Max Jacob, puppeteer and founder of the Hohnsteiner Puppenb√ºhne * 1898: Adolf Reichwein, German educator, economist and cultural politicians, resistance fighter during the Third Reich, died 1944 =Personalities who are associated with the city= Jaques Offenbach * 1811: Joseph Derenbourg, orientalist, died 1895 * 1819: Jacques Offenbach, composer, last stay in Bad Ems, many operettas listed here, died 1880 * 1841: John Naish, Lord Chancellor of Ireland, died in Bad Ems while taking a cure in 1890 and is buried there * 1944: Botho Strauss, writer and playwright, born in Naumburg, schooling through high school in Bad Ems * 1952: Thomas C.

The first festival was held in 1999, with a mixture of successful and unsuccessful events. In 2001, the festival re-focused by holding most events in Queen‚Äôs Park (previously, events were held in multiple venues throughout the city). Since the initial move to Queen‚Äôs Park, the festival has grown and moved back to multiple venues, including the streets. During the Easter weekend, most of Queen‚Äôs Park and some of Toowoomba's CBD was converted into an event precinct, with venue and residential tents, stages and other attractions. During the event setup and packdown, most of Queen's Park was inaccessible to the general public. In May 2015, it was announced that Easterfest would not be continuing in 2016.  Festival History  Guy Sebastian performs on Mainstage in 2004 before a crowd of 10,000 Tens of thousands of people attended the ticketed and free events during three-day festival in 2005, and over 20,000 tickets were allegedly sold in 2006. In 2009, about 40,000 people attended. In 2011, Easterfest announced late Saturday night that the program in the main venue, Queens Park, had been cancelled. The creek running right alongside the entrance to the Queen's Park venue, which had been the scene of major flooding earlier this year, became a raging river, making for a precarious exit. Organisers confirmed the tent had partially collapsed but there were no injuries and everyone had been accounted for. Police were closing off roads as the torrential rain turned roads into rapids. Numerous cars were abandoned after they stalled. Ricky Robinson, 18, of Petrie, who was camping at the site said it was like a small river going through the area. The water was up to patron‚Äôs knees in the moshpit as the US band Switchfoot played on, despite the deluge. The lead singer Jon Foreman was climbing up the support structures for the giant display screens. \\"He was crazy. He was drenched pretty much\\" Ricky said. Thousands of people were scrambling through rushing water as they exited Easterfest. Security staff and volunteers first advised people to head to the Big Top but that too was being flooded so many just headed across East Creek to the city and higher ground. Police and fire sirens only added to the drama. In 2012, 20,000 were drawn to the festival. \\"The noise created by crowds and thumping bass at Easterfest has become one of Toowoomba‚Äôs most debated issues. Kevin Farmer, a local resident stated, \\"The city is split down the middle between those who love the music festival and its inner-city location and those who want it moved\\". Co- ordinator Mr Schenk said: \\"We did have at least one breach and worked closely with council to get the noise within the prescribed limit. The biggest challenge came on Saturday night when we had three or four of our venues operating at the same time after 10pm, when the limits drop. Any one stage was okay, but cumulatively they were over the limit.\\" Residents have established their own messageboard to publish their grievances. In the wake of the growing popularity of the festival residents have begun to question the publicly stated financial standing of the festival. The festival collects publicly funded subsidies which local government councillors say the festival would not be possible without. Despite more than 20,000 visitors attending the event in 2012, Easterfest was not as financially successful as expected.

Their early sound was new wave-influenced, but is now more improvised and deconstructed, moving away from using the synthesizers that typify new wave. They are a collective with a revolving cast of musicians, including Steve Touchstone, Weasel Walter, and Vice Cooler. In 2002, Wesley Willis wrote a song dedicated to the band. For many years the collective resided in Oakland, California, where they finished working on their last full-length record, Wars, which was released in April 2007. In 2008 they were working on a record of improv based pieces titled \\"Sound\\" and splits with Mika Miko and Japanther. As of 2010, they have regrouped, and relocated to Los Angeles releasing new music and playing shows around California with their new line up. Early years On February 27, 1998, after attending a concert by Unwound and Deerhoof at Jaycee Hall in Biloxi, Mississippi, the band started as a trio, using a simple drum set, guitar and an inexpensive Radio Shack synthesizer. Their early sets consisted of very loose, improvised song structures. After a solid lineup they made their first public performance at a friend's birthday party in May 1998. In 1999, the band hit the road for the first time with a van that belonged to the drummer's mother. Eventually all of the members either graduated early or dropped out and went on tour more or less full time. 2000-2002 In summer of 2000, the band went into the studio to record some songs with producer Steve Albini. The sessions would turn into the band's first real full length, Gop Ist Minee which was released on Kill Rock Stars sister label 5RC. The album was released in January of the next year and was followed by tours with Unwound, Deerhoof, QandnotU, and the Sissies. In between shows, they recorded their Clear EP (with Ian Mackaye) and several singles, including the Quintron and Miss Pussycat collaboration single, \\"Mardi Gras\\", which was recorded by Tim Kerr, and the Vern Rumsey- produced \\"Hold Onto Your Skulls\\". In 2002, the band took a long break. 2003-2005 Weasel Walter had become a fan of XBXRX after seeing multiple Chicago performances between 1999 and 2001. He had kept in touch with the band, and in 2003, when Touchstone and Cooler moved the band from Alabama to California, they asked Walter to join the band as their new drummer and enlisted Paul Costuros (of Total Shutdown) to fill in on Bass duties. In April 2003, they did their first tour with the new lineup, opening for Holy Molar. They quickly started working in the studio and opened for Sonic Youth and Peaches. The end result was a contract with Polyvinyl Records which produced the band's follow up to Gop Ist Minee, Sixth in Sixes. 2006-2008 The band recorded their next two full-length albums Wars (Polyvinyl 2007) and Sounds (Important Records, 2007). While Wars focuses on their punk and new wave background, Sounds was dedicated to the opposite: studio experiments and improvised material which had only been reserved for their live shows. They toured with Melt Banana. 2009 Un Usper was released on June 3, 2009 as the band's latest album. It is mixed, produced, and released by the band as a download only, donation based record. 2010 \\"O\\" is a 10-song 7\\" which was released in September 2010 on Polyvinyl Records. \\"O\\" is a return to form for the band harkening back to their Sixth in Sixes era. The band line up now consists of Vice Cooler, and Steve Touchstone, in addition to new members Kyle H. Mabson and Josh Taylor (of Friends Forever, and Foot Village.)

The seal has gone through several revisions since the region was a part of the Northwest Territory. It is likely the original seal, which is similar to the current one, was created by William Henry Harrison during his administration of the Indiana Territory. The current design of the seal was standardized by the Indiana General Assembly in 1963. Usage The state seal is maintained by the Governor of Indiana. It is used to certify the authenticity of official state documents. The seal is placed on departmental reports, bills the Governor signs into law, and official communications from the Governor to other high-ranking office holders. The seal is also used on all commissions granted by the state as proof of the commission's authority.Indiana Constitution, Article 15, Section 5-6 History historical coat of arms (illustrated, 1876) The United States Congress passed legislation on May 8, 1792, that directed the U.S. Secretary of State to \\"provide proper seals for the several and respective public offices in the said Territories\\". Indiana was part of the Northwest Territory at that time and a seal was created by the United States Department of State to be used on official papers of the territory. The original seal was maintained by Governor Arthur St. Clair and the first recorded use was in a proclamation made on July 26, 1788. On May 10, 1800, the Indiana Territory was created by an act of Congress, but no provision for an official seal was included in the measure. The earliest recorded use of Indiana Territory's seal was on court documents that were signed by Governor William Henry Harrison in January 1801. The seal he used was an adaptation of the original seal created for the Northwest Territory. Although its origin is uncertain, it is likely that it was Harrison who made the alterations. The constitution of 1816 contained a clause that stated the governor should maintain a state seal and use it in official communication. The design of the seal was first proposed during the first session of the Indiana General Assembly in 1816. On November 22, 1816, representative Davis Floyd of Harrison County proposed the adoption of a seal with a design he referred to as \\"A forest and a woodman felling a tree, a buffalo leaving the forest and fleeing through the plain to a distant forest, and sun in the west with the word Indiana.\\" The bill was put through a joint conference of both houses of the General Assembly and funds where voted to purchase a printer to create the seal. In 1819, the state seal was part of a state crisis. Lieutenant Governor Christopher Harrison became acting-governor when Governor Jonathan Jennings was away conducting negotiations with northern Indiana's native tribes. When Jennings returned, Harrison refused to step down as governor, claiming that Jennings' actions had invalidated his governorship. Harrison seized the state seal and set up his own governor's office. After several weeks of debate in the state legislature, Harrison was forced to return the seal to Jennings and vacate the office of the governor. During 1895, Robert S. Hatcher, the reading clerk of the Indiana Senate, was directed to ascertain the legal status of the design of the state seal. After a thorough review, Hatcher found that the laws that authorized the seal did not explicitly state what its design should be. He recommended that a bill be passed to standardize the seal. Senator McCord submitted legislation for that purpose, but no action was taken on it. On January 28, 1905, an article ran in the Indianapolis News containing information on the origin of the seal, some of it dubious. The article received much attention and started an informal inquiry into the history of the seal, and namely to discover if the sun in the seal was rising or setting. Jacob Piatt Dunn, the preeminent Indiana historian of the time, consulted several history and arrived at the conclusion that the sun was rising. Dunn cited the fact the state was young, and the mountains were to the east of the state, not the west‚Äîclearly indicating the sun was rising. The current design of the seal was standardized by the Indiana General Assembly in 1963. During the meeting of the General Assembly, Representative Taylor I. Morris introduced legislation to standardize the design of the state seal. His bill described a seal that depicts a woodsman chopping a sycamore tree, while an American Bison runs in the foreground and the sun rises in the background. The leaves of the state tree, the tulip, were to be the border design. The bill passed the assembly that session and became law. In 2004, the 1963 statute came under criticism because it states the sun in the state seal is setting rather than rising. A thorough investigation by the Indiana Historical Bureau into the history of the seal led to the discovery that original seal was created with the intention that the sun should, in fact, be depicted as rising. In both 2004 and 2005 legislation was introduced to change the wording of the statute, but as of 2008 no action had been taken to correct the error. Current statute The law created to standardize the state seal has been in effect since 1963. The stature states: > Indiana State Code: IC 1-2-4-1 The official seal for the state of Indiana > shall be described as follows: A perfect circle, two and five eighths (2 > 5/8) inches in diameter, inclosed by a plain line. Another circle within the > first, two and three eighths (2 3/8) inches in diameter inclosed by a beaded > line, leaving a margin of one quarter (1/4) of an inch. In the top half of > this margin are the words \\"Seal of the State of Indiana\\". At the bottom > center, 1816, flanked on either side by a diamond, with two (2) dots and a > leaf of the tulip tree (liriodendron tulipifera), at both ends of the > diamond. The inner circle has two (2) trees in the left background, three > (3) hills in the center background with nearly a full sun setting behind and > between the first and second hill from the left. There are fourteen (14) > rays from the sun, starting with two (2) short ones on the left, the third > being longer and then alternating, short and long. There are two (2) > sycamore trees on the right, the larger one being nearer the center and > having a notch cut nearly half way through, from the left side, a short > distance above the ground. The woodsman is wearing a hat and holding his ax > nearly perpendicular on his right. The ax blade is turned away from him and > is even with his hat. The buffalo is in the foreground, facing to the left > of front. His tail is up, front feet on the ground with back feet in the > air, as he jumps over a log. The ground has shoots of blue grass, in the > area of the buffalo and woodsman. Iconography The sun rising in the picture represents that Indiana has a bright future ahead and is just beginning. The mountains it rises over are a representation of the Allegheny Mountains showing that Indiana is in the west. The woodman represents civilization subduing the wilderness that was Indiana. The buffalo represents the wilderness fleeing westward away from the advancing civilization.

As was customary for a laird (landed proprietor in Scotland), MacDonell was often called Glengarry after his principal estate. Glengarry's haughty and flamboyant personality, as expressed in his character and behaviour, gave Walter Scott the model for the wild Highland clan chieftain Fergus Mac-Ivor in the pioneering 1810 historical novel Waverley. Glengarry was the fifth Lord MacDonell in the Jacobite peerage.Marquis de Ruvigny et Raineval, The Jacobite peerage, baronetage, knightage, and grants of honour, extracted, by permission, from the Stuart papers now in possession of his Majesty the King at Windsor Castle, and supplemented by biographical and genealogical notes (2003 reprint), p. 88 Life He was born on 15 September 1773, the eldest of the nine children of Duncan Macdonell (c. 1744‚Äì1788), chief of Clan Macdonell of Glengarry, by his marriage to Marjory Grant (1744‚Äì1792), of Dalvey.Brian D. Osborne, The Last of the Chiefs (Argyll Publishing, 2001) In 1788, he became the 15th chief of Clan MacDonell of Glengarry, inheriting huge estates from Glengarry in the Great Glen to Knoydart on the Atlantic. In 1790. he entered University College, Oxford. In February 1793, after war with France had begun, Macdonell was commissioned as a Captain to recruit a company of the Strathspey Fencibles, raised by Sir James Grant, a kinsman. In August 1794, he was given a colonel's commission to raise the Glengarry Fencibles regiment of Glengarry Highlanders, recruits being drawn from the Glengarry estates, under threat of eviction if persuasion did not work. Glengarry commanded his regiment in Guernsey until August 1796, when he resigned. His hope of a career as a regular officer in the British Army had been undermined by his commander-in-chief, the Duke of York and Albany, perhaps due to concerns about his character. As part of his regiment's uniform, he invented (or adopted) the Glengarry, states that MacDonell invented the cap. However, states that the idea came from Balmoral bonnet wearers who bent and creased their bonnets, then was popularised by MacDonell when he raised the Glengarry Fencibles and made the Glengarry bonnet part of their uniform. a type of cap which he is wearing in his portrait. The boat-shaped cap without a peak is made of thick-milled woollen material with a toorie (or bobble) on the top and ribbons hanging down behind, capable of being folded flat. It has become part of the uniform of a number of Scottish regiments, with variations in the band around above the brim and in the colours. The Glengarry fencibles were disbanded in 1802, and Glengarry failed to honour a pledge to find land for the men. This resulted in a mass emigration to British North America led by Father Alexander Macdonell, the regimental chaplain. He bitterly feuded with Thomas Telford and the Commissioners of the Caledonian Canal as it was being constructed through his land, though he collected useful dues from them. Glengarry considered himself the last genuine specimen of a Highland chief, always wore the Highland dress (kilt or trews) and in the style of his ancestors seldom travelled without being followed by his \\"tail\\", armed servants in full Highland dress who had traditional duties such as carrying his sword and shield, standing sentinel, acting as bard and carrying him dry across streams. He was a member of the Highland Society and the Celtic Society of Edinburgh, and in June 1815 formed his own Society of True Highlanders, subsequently leaving the Celtic Society and complaining that \\"their general appearance is assumed and fictitious, and they have no right to burlesque the national character or dress of the Highlands\\". His mortification at the acceptance of Lowlanders became a bitter complaint about the prominent role the Celtic Society had in the visit of King George IV to Scotland, and he made several unauthorised and flamboyant appearances during the visit, to the annoyance of his friend Walter Scott and the other organisers, but causing no more than mild amusement to the King. In 1824 Glengarry unsuccessfully attempted to wrest the chiefship of Clan Donald from Ranald George Macdonald by bringing an action in the Court of Session.electricscotland.com Clearances Although Scott wrote of Glengarry in his misleading hagiography \\"He is a kind of Quixote in our age, having retained, in their full extent, the whole feelings of clanship and chieftainship, elsewhere so long abandoned\\", under his authority timber was felled for sale, the cleared land was leased to sheep farmers and many of his clansmen were forced from the land by increasing rents and evictions. He continued the evictions to make way for sheep farmers which his mother began when his father was chieftain, and most of the clan was forced to emigrate to British North America, as part of what was later known as the Highland Clearances. Robert Burns wrote a satirical poem about Glengarry in the Address of Beelzebub. His life was in stark contrast to his contemporary relative Bishop Alexander MacDonell who did missionary duty in Lochaber and tried to help his clansmen displaced by the substitution of sheep-farms for smallholdings to get employment in the Lowlands. In 1794 he organised the formation of the 1st Glengarry Fencible regiment, commanded by his kinsman Glengarry, with himself as chaplain. When the regiment was disbanded Father MacDonell arranged a tract of land in Canada in 1804 and went with them. Death On 17 January 1828, Glengarry perished at Corran on Loch Linnhe from an attack of brain fever which followed an accident during his escape from a steamer which had gone aground. According to the Inverness Courier, the funeral procession of five miles from Invergarry to Kilfinnan was followed by 1,500 men and 150 gentry, the coffin being carried breast-high by eighteen Highlanders. Glengarry's personal piper, Archie Munro, composed a lament, as did the blind household bard, Allan MacDougall. As Brian Osborne records, \\"In Edinburgh Sir Walter Scott was moved to compose Glengarry's Death Song, an undoubted expression of his genuine affection for the dead chief, if not perhaps a work of the greatest literary quality\\".The Last of the Chiefs, at page 226 Family On 20 January 1802, Glengarry married Rebecca, the second daughter of Sir William Forbes, 6th Baronet, of Pitsligo. Their children were a son, Aeneas Ranaldson, born on 29 July 1808, and seven daughters, Elizabeth, Marcelly, Jemima Rebecca, Louisa Christian, Caroline Hester, Gulielmina Forbes, and Euphemia Margaret.Sir Bernard Burke, A genealogical history of the dormant, abeyant, forfeited, and extinct peerages of the British empire (1866), p. 345 Glengarry's estate was much mortgaged and encumbered. In 1840, after his only son and heir, Aeneas Ranaldson MacDonell, had come of age he sold the Glengarry part of the estate to Lord Ward, later Earl of Dudley, for ¬£91,000. Some years later Aeneas sold the Knoydart estate to a Mr Baird. Aeneas died at Invergarry on 19 June 1852, leaving three sons, Alexander Ranaldson (1834-1862), Aeneas Robert (1835-1855) and Charles Ranaldson (1838-1868). Alexander emigrated to Australia and died unmarried in Dunedin, New Zealand, in 1862. Aeneas drowned at the age of twenty and Charles died at sea in 1868 on his way home from New Zealand.

Members of the enclave are known as the Saman√° Americans. The language is a relative of African Nova Scotian English and African-American Vernacular English, with variations unique to the enclave's history in the area. In the 1950 Dominican Republic census, 0.57% of the population (about 12,200 people) said that their mother tongue was English. Immigration Most speakers trace their lineage to immigrants who arrived at the peninsula in 1824 and 1825. All of Hispaniola was administered by Haiti, and its president was Jean-Pierre Boyer. The immigrants responded to an invitation for settlement that Jonathas Granville had delivered in person to Philadelphia, Baltimore, Boston, and New York City. Abolitionists like Richard Allen, Samuel Cornish, Benjamin Lundy, and Loring D. Dewey joined the campaign, which was coined the Haitian emigration. The response was unprecedented, as thousands of African Americans boarded ships in eastern cities and migrated to Haiti. Most of the immigrants arrived during the fall of 1824 and the spring of 1825. More continued moving back and forth in later years but at a slower rate. Between 1859 and 1863, another immigration campaign brought new settlers to the island but at a fraction of the number in 1824 and 1825. Those who originally settled in Saman√° were fewer than 600 but formed the only surviving immigration enclave. Survival While more than 6000 immigrants came in 1824 and 1835, by the end of the 19th century, only a handful of enclaves on the island spoke any variety of the antebellum Black Vernacular. They were communities in Puerto Plata, Saman√° and Santo Domingo. The largest was the one in Saman√° that maintained church schools, where it was preserved. During the Rafael Trujillo dictatorship (1930‚Äì1961), however, the government began a systematic policy of Hispanizing the entire Dominican population. The church schools in which English was taught were eliminated, and the language was discouraged. Enclaves across the island soon lost an important element of their identity, which led to their disintegration. Saman√° English withstood the assaults in part because the location of Saman√° was favorable to a more independent cultural life. However, government policies have still influenced the language's gradual decline, and it may well now be an endangered language. Nature The language is variously described as either a creole language or a dialect of English. It is similar to that of Caribbean English Creoles spoken by the English-speaking Caribbean, especially Turks and Caicos and Bahamian Creole. Ethnologue The 15th edition (2005) of Ethnologue dropped it from its list of languages, but linguists still consider it a separate language variety.

The M'Clure Strait (sometimes rendered McClure Strait) is a strait on the edge of the Canadian Northwest Territories. It forms the northwestern end of the Parry Channel which extends east all the way to Baffin Bay and is thus a possible route for the Northwest Passage. The strait was named for Robert McClure, an Irish Arctic explorer serving in the Royal Navy. He was the first man to traverse the North-West Passage (by boat and sledge). The strait connects the Beaufort Sea in the west with Viscount Melville Sound in the east. It is bounded by Prince Patrick Island, Eglinton Island and Melville Island on the north and Banks Island on the south. As the strait is chronically blocked with thick ice, it is usually impassable to ships; in 1969, the United States-registered tanker was freed from the ice by a Canadian icebreaker, and forced to travel through Canadian territorial waters to complete its westward passage. Ice prevented Manhattan from going through McClure Strait so the vessel sailed through the Prince of Wales Strait. There is a dispute between Canada and the United States over the waters of the Arctic Islands, other than those within of shore. The M'Clure Strait became fully open (ice-free) in early August 2007, and again in August 2008. The European Space Agency reported that the Arctic's Northwest Passage opened up fully sea ice free, clearing a lane through the northern section of the historically impassable route between Europe and Asia. At 15.33Z on 29 August 2012, the purpose built Polar Bound under the command of David Scott Cowper with Jane Maufe as crew, was the first private yacht to pass through the strait. Shortly thereafter, the Hallberg-Rassy sailboat Belzebub II, with three sailors aboard, became the first sailboat to travel the route. The M'Clure Strait lies within the M'Clure Rift which forms the western end of the Parry Submarine Rift Valley. It is considered an incipient rift zone because little extensional tectonism has taken place on it and no oceanic crust occurs in the middle of the strait.

The structure is also known as a hairpin or hairpin loop. It occurs when two regions of the same strand, usually complementary in nucleotide sequence when read in opposite directions, base-pair to form a double helix that ends in an unpaired loop. The resulting structure is a key building block of many RNA secondary structures. As an important secondary structure of RNA, it can direct RNA folding, protect structural stability for messenger RNA (mRNA), provide recognition sites for RNA binding proteins, and serve as a substrate for enzymatic reactions.Svoboda, P., & Cara, A. (2006). Hairpin RNA: A secondary structure of primary importance. Cellular and Molecular Life Sciences, 63(7), 901-908. Formation and stability The formation of a stem- loop structure is dependent on the stability of the resulting helix and loop regions. The first prerequisite is the presence of a sequence that can fold back on itself to form a paired double helix. The stability of this helix is determined by its length, the number of mismatches or bulges it contains (a small number are tolerable, especially in a long helix) and the base composition of the paired region. Pairings between guanine and cytosine have three hydrogen bonds and are more stable compared to adenine-uracil pairings, which have only two. In RNA, adenine-uracil pairings featuring two hydrogen bonds are equal to the adenine-thymine bond of the DNA. Base stacking interactions, which align the pi bonds of the bases' aromatic rings in a favorable orientation, also promote helix formation. The stability of the loop also influences the formation of the stem-loop structure. \\"Loops\\" that are less than three bases long are sterically impossible and do not form. Large loops with no secondary structure of their own (such as pseudoknot pairing) are also unstable. Optimal loop length tends to be about 4-8 bases long. One common loop with the sequence UUCG is known as the \\"tetraloop\\" and is particularly stable due to the base-stacking interactions of its component nucleotides. Structural contexts Stem-loops occur in pre-microRNA structures and most famously in transfer RNA, which contain three true stem- loops and one stem that meet in a cloverleaf pattern. The anticodon that recognizes a codon during the translation process is located on one of the unpaired loops in the tRNA. Two nested stem-loop structures occur in RNA pseudoknots, where the loop of one structure forms part of the second stem. Many ribozymes also feature stem-loop structures. The self-cleaving hammerhead ribozyme contains three stem-loops that meet in a central unpaired region where the cleavage site lies. The hammerhead ribozyme's basic secondary structure is required for self-cleavage activity. Hairpin loops are often elements found within the 5'UTR of prokaryotes. These structures are often bound by proteins or cause the attenuation of a transcript in order to regulate translation. The mRNA stem-loop structure forming at the ribosome binding site may control an initiation of translation. Stem-loop structures are also important in prokaryotic rho-independent transcription termination. The hairpin loop forms in an mRNA strand during transcription and causes the RNA polymerase to become dissociated from the DNA template strand. This process is known as rho-independent or intrinsic termination, and the sequences involved are called terminator sequences.

Except in the phrase backhand volley, the term refers to a groundstroke (that is, one in which the ball has bounced before it is struck). It contrasts with the other kind of groundstroke, the forehand. The term is also used in other racquet sports, and other areas where a similar motion is employed (for example while throwing a sport disc). The backhand is usually performed from the baseline or as an approach shot. For a right-handed player, a backhand begins with the racquet on the left side of the body, continues across the body as contact is made with the ball, and ends on the right side of the body, with the racquet over the right shoulder. The backhand can be a one-handed or two-handed stroke. Due to the fact that the player's dominant hand \\"pulls\\" into the shot, the backhand generally lacks the power and consistency of the forehand, and is usually considered more difficult to master. However, the two-handed backhand provides more stability and power for the shot, and is increasingly used in the modern game. Beginner and club-level players often have difficulty hitting a backhand, and junior players may have trouble making the shot if they are not strong enough to hit it. Many advanced players still have a significantly better forehand than backhand, and many strategies in tennis aim to exploit this weakness.  Grips  For most of the 20th century, the backhand was hit with one hand using either an eastern or continental grip. The first notable players to use a two-handed backhand were the 1930s Australians Vivian McGrath and John Bromwich. Beginning with Mike Belkin who was the first two-handed backhand player in the United States and Chris Evert in the 1960s, many players began to use a two-handed grip for the backhand. Pete Sampras and Stefan Edberg notably switched from the two-handed to the one-handed backhand late in their development.  Strengths and weaknesses  = Two-handed backhand = Players often choose their backhand type based on their hand dominance‚Äîif the player is somewhat ambidextrous, the two-handed backhand might be best. Starting from the 1970s, many of the greatest players used the two-handed backhand and it has become more popular on the pro tour. Two-handed backhands have some important advantages over one- handed backhands: * The backhands are generally more accurate because having two hands on the racquet makes the contact more stable, allowing for more control of the shot, especially on the return of serve and in defense, while one-handed backhands generally require finer motor skills and are less consistent in longer rallies. * Two-handed backhands can more easily hit higher balls. * Two-handed backhands have a chance to be consistently closer in power and/or accuracy to the forehand, possibly even surpassing it. People with a noticeably weaker one-handed backhand tend to get balls returned to them on that wing, giving them a disadvantage, especially with high kick serves and lefty slice serves. * Two-handed backhands can be hit with an open stance, whereas one-handers usually have to have a closed stance, which adds further steps (which is a problem at higher levels of play). * Two-handed backhands are generally more easy to develop and require less motor skills than a one-handed backhand to perform all the basic shots. Since the 70s, juniors have been taught two-handed backhands more often than the one-handed backhand. = One-handed backhand = One-handed backhands have some other important advantages over two-handed backhands: * Modern one-handed backhands typically have significantly more topspin and torque than two-handed backhands, which allows them to create more acute angles and pull the opponent off the court more easily, especially on the clay. * One-handed backhands can generate more power when properly set up, and can be very penetrating when hit correctly. They can also hit lower balls with more pace and penetration than two-handed backhands. * One-handed backhand players move to the net with greater ease than two-handed players because the shot permits greater forward momentum and has greater similarities in muscle memory to the preferred type of backhand volley (one-handed, for greater reach). This is why a majority of serve and volleyers employ a one-handed backhand. * One-handed backhands should be hit more in front of the body than the forehand, which allows them to be hit with a deeper hit spot. * One-handed backhands force players to hit high balls with slice, thus causing them to develop much better slice backhands than two-handed players. Generally, both backhands are efficient at what they do. Perhaps the biggest weakness cited by most coaches in regards to the one hander is the fact that it requires more time and steps to be set up properly‚Äîit requires an extra half step in order to execute a proper back- swing and have proper control over the point of contact‚Äîa traditional one handed backhand is hit from a closed stance with the dominant foot placed in front, whereas the two hander can be hit both from open and closed stance. This can hamper players who use a one handed backhand on fast surfaces as the high speed of most drive shots gives them very little time for preparation and setting up their shot. However, players with a modern one-handed backhand like Dominic Thiem, Stan Wawrinka or Stefanos Tsitsipas can hit it with an open stance and off the back foot, too. There are also plenty of players who can set up their shots properly even with little time for preparation and can hit effective backhands with one hand even on fast surfaces (the most notable example is Roger Federer who can hit drives with his backhand on all surfaces with the same consistency as two handers). Stan Wawrinka is another example of a player who hits consistent one hand backhand drives on all types of surface with the same margin of error. The type of backhand a player uses comes down to mostly personal preference and their game style. Since the 1970s however, the two-handed backhand has had a spike in popularity and is now more widely taught than the one-handed backhand. Many tennis greats use the one-handed backhand. Such players include Roger Federer, Stefan Edberg, Pete Sampras, Justine Henin, Steffi Graf, Gustavo Kuerten, Amelie Mauresmo, Martina Navratilova, Stan Wawrinka, Don Budge, Ken Rosewall and Rod Laver. Technique Despite there being many different variations and styles, in general there are three different techniques to hit the one-handed backhand. The first is the slice, the oldest version of the single-handed backhand, which was popularised by many classic players such as Ken Rosewall and was still used up until the 1980s even in the women's tour, with many great women champions such as Steffi Graf having one of the lowest, most effective slice backhands. The slice backhand is considered the most simple and is the easiest to learn technique-wise. However, it is much harder to master. Unlike the slice on its own, the slice backhand refers to a player continuously using slice on their backhand as an ordinary shot, instead of for variety. Most slice backhands are executed with a continental grip, identical to that of the backhand volley. The motion is also simple, and involves a cut at about 45 degrees to the bottom of the ball. The slice action closer to the bottom results in a higher and slower ball, typically used for lobs while a cut closer to the side of the ball results in a faster and lower ball. It is considered hard to be able to consistently pull off deep, low yet quick backhand slices and requires much practice and finesse. Such slice backhands often prevent opponents from getting under the ball easily and hitting easy winners. It also slows down the pace of the ball due to the back-spin on it, giving time for the player to anticipate and set up shots. For example, Steffi Graf often used her slice backhand to buy time for her to move around and hit inside-out forehands, her signature shot. It can also act as a good bluff to hit drop-shots or even fake drop-shots. From the 1940s to the 1960s, the flat single-handed backhand was popularised by many players, most famously Rod Laver and Don Budge. He was one of the first players to use a flat single- handed backhand with a hint of top-spin. Although flat or top-spin shots were not rare at the time, they were not common shots and were used mainly for variety only, especially on the backhand side. These shots were generally faster-paced, but were considered harder to learn and execute. Even today, there are still many players who use the flat single-handed backhand, such as Stan Wawrinka and Roger Federer, although they have added more top-spin to cope with top-spin from other players as well. However, by the 1980s, the flat single-handed backhand was the norm for most single-handed backhand players, with marquee players such as Stefan Edberg, John McEnroe and Pete Sampras using it to great effectiveness. The advantages of the flat single-handed backhand include its speed, the angles it can produce and its depth. It is usually executed with an Eastern or Semi-Western grip, and involves a \\"throw- back\\" in which the racket is pulled across the player's body, sometimes with the help of the left hand, and a release to hit the ball followed by a much larger follow-through and finish as compared to the slice backhand. While Bj√∂rn Borg was considered to have had a two-handed backhand, he released his racket with one-hand, and was arguably the catalyst for the evolution and popularity of the two-handed backhand as well as the top-spin single-handed backhand. In the 1980s, when more players were using top-spin, single-handed backhand players found it more difficult to hit flat backhands due to the difficulty of neutralising the spin. Therefore, many players incorporated much more top-spin in their single-handed backhands, which was uncommon at that time. Up til today, many players who are considered to have some of the best single-handed backhands ever, such as Richard Gasquet, use a top-spin backhand. Other current players who use it include Nicol√°s Almagro and Grigor Dimitrov (Although he is also capable of hitting it flat). This helped single- handed backhand players cope with high spinning balls. The advantages of the top-spin single-handed backhand include consistency, placement, the angles it can produce as well as its ability to cope with high balls. Single-backhand \\"flicks\\" also evolved due to the popularisation of the top-spin single-handed backhand. Unlike the flat single-handed backhand, top-spin single-handed backhands are almost always performed with the Semi-Western or even Western Grip. Richard Gasquet, who is considered to have one of the most elegant and efficient single-handed backhands, is known for his long, winding action on his backhand and his elegant follow-through. The top-spin single-handed backhand is probably the hardest to learn. It involves the player employing a Semi-Western or Western grip, and winding the racket around his body and, most importantly, bring it lower than the ball. Then, he has to hit the ball at the middle to bottom of the ball while winding his hand upwards and front of him, in a \\"window-wiper\\" action. A mistake that is often made in this execution is not bringing the racket low enough or not having a follow-through. Many great players employ a combination of two or even three different styles. For example, Stan Wawrinka, who is said to have one of the most powerful single- handed backhands ever, can hit extremely flat backhands, but can also apply top-spin to them. Stefan Edberg in the past, along with Roger Federer and Grigor Dimitrov are able to apply all three, using the slice, flat and top- spin backhands effectively. This variety makes it hard for the opponent to guess what kind of shot they are going to play. Great backhands Serena Williams preparing to hit a backhand. The player long considered to have had the best backhand of all time, amateur and professional champion Don Budge, had a very powerful one-handed stroke in the 1930s and '40s that imparted topspin onto the ball. He used an Eastern grip, and some pictures show his thumb extended along the side of the racquet for greater support. Ken Rosewall, another amateur and professional champion noted for his one-handed backhand, also used a continental grip to hit a deadly accurate slice backhand with underspin throughout the 1950s and '60s. Connoisseurs of the game also rate Swede Henrik Sundstr√∂m's one-handed backhand as technically magnificent and as powerful as many forehands, but Sundstr√∂m's career was cut short by injury. In his 1979 autobiography, Jack Kramer devotes a page to the best tennis strokes he had ever seen. He writes: \\"BACKHAND‚ÄîBudge was best, with Kovacs, Rosewall and Connors in the next rank (although, as I've said, Connors' 'backhand' is really a two-handed forehand). Just in passing, the strangest competitive stroke was the backhand that belonged to Budge Patty. It was a weak shot, a little chip. But suddenly on match point, Patty had a fine, firm backhand. He was a helluva match player.\\" On the men's pro tour, dramatic changes have occurred since then. In the 1980s, many great players such as Stefan Edberg, Ivan Lendl, Henrik Sundstr√∂m and John McEnroe were leading the charge with their one-handed versatile backhands. But a new wave of players, such as Jimmy Connors, Bj√∂rn Borg and Mats Wilander, started to show the world that two-handed backhands could also offer major advantages. Players could now increase the speed and control of their two-hander in key defensive shots, such as returns, passing shots and lobs. Since then, many players followed this trend. Among the main ones are Andre Agassi, Jim Courier, Sergi Bruguera, Marat Safin, Rafael Nadal, Novak Djokovic, Andy Murray, David Nalbandian (owning the fastest recorded backhand at 110 mph (171 km/h)), Nikolay Davydenko, Lleyton Hewitt, Daniil Medvedev, and Gilles Simon. However, the one-handed backhand is still used effectively by a few players like Roger Federer, Richard Gasquet, Stan Wawrinka, Dominic Thiem, Philipp Kohlschreiber, Stefanos Tsitsipas, Grigor Dimitrov, Denis Shapovalov, Pablo Cuevas, Dusan Lajovic, Dan Evans, Marco Cecchinato, Ivo Karlovic, Leonardo Mayer, Marius Copil, Tommy Robredo, Dudi Sela and Feliciano Lopez. On the women's tour, Justine Henin's backhand was considered on par with the men's, with John McEnroe saying \\"Justine Henin has the best single-handed backhand in both the men's and women's game. Henin's backhand is described as a deadly weapon which is spontaneous, accurate and powerful. She can hit drop shots with her deadly back hand.\\" Many different styles of backhand arose in the late 1980s, including Steffi Graf's exceptional one-handed sliced backhand, and Monica Seles' two-handed backhand, characterized by its rapidity of execution. WTA players who possessed one-handed backhands include Graf, Henin, Margaret Court, Martina Navratilova, Gabriela Sabatini, Conchita Mart√≠nez, Jana Novotn√°, Eleni Daniilidou, Am√©lie Mauresmo, Carla Su√°rez Navarro, Margarita Gasparyan, Roberta Vinci, Francesca Schiavone, Naomi Broady, and Diane Parry. The two-handed backhand began to gain popularity over the one-handed backhand in the 1990s (even though there had been great tennis champions whose backhand was two-handed, Chris Evert being an example). Some of the greatest two-handed backhands of the modern game include Serena Williams, Martina Hingis, Venus Williams, Maria Sharapova, Kim Clijsters, Lindsay Davenport, Jelena Jankoviƒá, Li Na, Caroline Wozniacki, Victoria Azarenka, Simona Halep and Jeƒºena Ostapenko. The Williams sisters and Sharapova possess double-handed backhands that are considered the best and most powerful on tour. They can damage their opponents from any corner of the court with their backhands, being able to create angles that are much more difficult to create with a one-handed backhand. Other female players are known for their use of the slice backhand. Female players known for their proficiency with this shot include Billie Jean King, Margaret Court, Virginia Wade, Martina Navratilova, Steffi Graf, Jana Novotn√°, Nathalie Tauziat, Justine Henin, Am√©lie Mauresmo, Svetlana Kuznetsova, Samantha Stosur, Francesca Schiavone, Sara Errani, Roberta Vinci, Carla Su√°rez Navarro, Agnieszka Radwa≈Ñska, Monica Niculescu, Caroline Garcia, Anastasija Sevastova, Ashleigh Barty and Bianca Andreescu. Some of the greatest rivalries in tennis history are symbolized by two different backhand styles. These include the Evert‚ÄìNavratilova rivalry of the 1980s with Martina Navratilova's smooth one-handed sliced backhand versus Chris Evert's perfectly controlled two-handed backhand, Borg-McEnroe rivalry of the same period featuring Bjorn Borg's two-handed backhand against John McEnroe's one-handed backhand, and the contemporary Federer-Nadal rivalry with Roger Federer's effortless one-handed backhand with a lot of topspin or backspin, versus Rafael Nadal's powerful, flatter two-handed backhand.

From Langmuir's adsorption isotherm, molecules cannot adsorb on surfaces when the adsorption sites are already occupied by other molecules, so the sticking probability can be expressed as follows: S=S_0(1-\\\\theta) where S_0 is the initial sticking probability and \\\\theta is the surface coverage fraction ranging from 0 to 1. Similarly, when molecules adsorb on surfaces dissociatively, the sticking probability is S=S_0(1-\\\\theta)^2 The square is owing to the fact that a disassociation of 1 molecule into 2 parts requires 2 adsorption sites. These equations are simple and can be easily understood but cannot explain experimental results. In 1958, P. Kisliuk presented an equation for the sticking probability that can explain experimental results. In his theory, molecules are trapped in precursor states of physisorption before chemisorption. Then the molecules meet adsorption sites that molecules can adsorb to chemically, so the molecules behave as follows. If these sites are not occupied, molecules do the following (with probability in parentheses): # adsorb on the surface chemically (P_a) # desorb from the surface (P_b) # move to the next precursor state (P_c) and if these sites are occupied, they # desorb from the surface (P_b') # move to the next precursor state (P_c') Note that an occupied site is defined as one where there is a chemically bonded adsorbate so by definition it would be P_a'=0. Then the sticking probability is, according to equation (6) of the reference, S=S_0\\\\left(1+\\\\frac{\\\\theta}{1-\\\\theta} K \\\\right)^{-1} = S_0 \\\\frac{1-\\\\theta}{1 + (K-1)\\\\theta} K = \\\\frac{P_b'}{P_a} + P_b When K=1, this equation is identical in result to Langmuir's adsorption isotherm.

Early life He was the eldest son of William Ker of Cessford (died 1605), and Janet (n√©e Douglas) Tweedie Ker. His mother was the widow of James Tweedie of Drumelzier, and the third daughter of Sir James Douglas of Drumlanrig. His paternal grandfather was Sir Walter Ker of Cessford (died ), who fought against Mary, Queen of Scots, both at Carberry Hill and at Langside. Career He was knighted on 17 May 1590 at the coronation of Anne of Denmark.Calendar State Papers Scotland: 1589‚Äì1593, vol. 10 (Edinburgh, 1936), p. 300. In December 1590 he was involved in the assassination of William Kerr of Ancram who was ambushed on the stairs at the entry to his lodging by two of Robert's followers who shot him with a pistol called a \\"dag\\".Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 10 (Edinburgh, 1936), p. 430. Ker had married Margaret Maitland, a niece of the Chancellor, John Maitland of Thirlestane. In 1592 Ker was able to help Maitland into the favour of Anne of Denmark.Thomas Thomson, Memoirs of his own Life (Edinburgh, 1827), p. 405. Ker was Deputy Keeper of Liddesdale and Warden of the Middle March in 1593. In August 1594 he performed in the tournament at the baptism of Prince Henry at Stirling Castle dressed as a Turkish knight.Michael Bath, Emblems in Scotland: Motifs and Meanings (Brill, Leiden, 2018), pp. 97‚Äì101. He helped James VI against Bothwell, was a member of the Privy Council of Scotland from 1599, and was created Lord Roxburghe in 1600. In April 1601 Roxburghe invited James VI and his consort Anne of Denmark to the celebration of the marriage of his sister Elizabeth to Sir John Bellenden of Broughton at Floors Castle, but the king refused, suspecting a plot involving the Master of Gray.Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 13 (Edinburgh, 1969), p. 810. In September 1602, he visited Elizabeth I of England. Sir Robert Cecil wrote that he was \\"of as wise and gallant fashion as I have seen out of Scotland a great while.\\"Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 13 (Edinburgh, 1969), p. 1045. He accompanied King James to London in 1603. Ker succeeded to his father's estates in 1606 and in 1607, he was a Gentleman of the Bedchamber. On 18 September 1616, he was created Lord Ker of Cessford and Caverton, and Earl of Roxburghe with remainder to his heirs male. He offended decorum at court in April 1625, when the body of King James was bought from Theobalds it was noticed that the Earls of Morton and Roxburghe were not in attendance, but went to be \\"merry\\" at More Park with Lucy Russell, Countess of Bedford.Henry Paton, HMC Mar & Kellie, vol. 2 (London, 1930), p. 227. He was appointed Keeper of the Privy Seal of Scotland in 1637. He subscribed to the King's Covenant at Holyrood in 1638, and joined the King's party in the civil war. When the King attempted to arrest five members of the House of Commons in 1642, Ker kept the door of the chamber open (see article on William Lenthall). He supported the \\"Engagement\\" for the King's rescue in 1648, and was consequently deprived of his office as Keeper of the Privy Seal in 1649. Personal life The Earl of Roxburghe married three times. His first marriage was on 27 October 1587 to Margaret Maitland (died by 1613), the only daughter of William Maitland of Lethington and Mary Fleming who was one of the \\"Four Maries\\", the devoted companions of the Queen of the Scots. They were the parents of: * William Ker, styled Lord Ker, Commendator of Kelso Abbey (d. 1643), who died before Lord Ker. * Jean Ker, who married John Drummond, 2nd Earl of Perth. * Isabel Ker, who married James Scrymgeour, 2nd Viscount of Dudhope. * Mary Ker, who married Sir James Haliburton of Pitcur (son of Sir James Halyburton). After his death, she married James Carnegie, 2nd Earl of Southesk (parents of Robert Carnegie, 3rd Earl of Southesk). On 3 February 1613/14, he married Jean Drummond (‚Äì1643), the sister of his son-in- law and the third daughter of Patrick Drummond, 3rd Lord Drummond and Lady Elizabeth Lindsay (daughter of David Lindsay, 9th Earl of Crawford). Their son was Harry Ker, styled Lord Ker (d. 1642/3), who married Lady Margaret Hay, only daughter of William Hay, 10th Earl of Erroll and Lady Anne Lyon (eldest daughter of Patrick Lyon, 1st Earl of Kinghorne). After his death, his widow married John Kennedy, 6th Earl of Cassilis. After his second wife's death in 1643, he married Lady Isobel Douglas, fifth daughter of William Douglas, 7th Earl of Morton, by his wife Lady Anne Keith (eldest daughter of George Keith, 5th Earl Marischal). He died at Floors, his residence near Kelso, on 18 January 1650. After his death, his widow married James Graham, 2nd Marquess of Montrose and became the mother of James Graham, 3rd Marquess of Montrose. His will mentions a chain of diamonds and rubies, with a \\"picture case\\" or locket containing the miniature portrait of Anne of Denmark, set with diamonds, the central larger stone was heart shaped. He owned a \\"valentine set with diamonds\\" with a crown and the picture of Charles I of England as Duke of York.Maria Hayward, Stuart Style (Yale, 2020), pp. 215-6. These jewels had probably been gifts to his wife from the queen. =Title and estate= As both of his sons predeceased him without male issue of their own, his titles and estates passed by special arrangement to his grandson, William Drummond (1622‚Äì1675), the youngest son of his eldest daughter Jean and her husband John Drummond, 2nd Earl of Perth. William took the name of Ker, became 2nd Earl of Roxburghe, and married his cousin, Lord Ker's daughter Jean.

Considerable information is available from commercial sources about this salt. Pyroelectric fusion According to an April 2005 Nature article, Brian Naranjo, Jim Gimzewski and Seth Putterman at UCLA applied a large temperature difference to a lithium tantalate crystal producing a large enough charge to generate and accelerate a beam of deuterium nuclei into a deuteriated target resulting in the production of a small flux of helium-3 and neutrons through nuclear fusion without extreme heat or pressure. Their results have been replicated. It is unlikely to be useful for electricity generation since the energy required to produce the fusion reactions exceeded the energy produced by them. It is thought that the technique might be useful for small neutron generators, especially if the deuterium beam is replaced by a tritium one. Comparing this with the electrostatic containment of ionic plasma to achieve fusion in a \\"fusor\\" or other IEC, this method focuses electrical acceleration to a much smaller non- ionized deuterium target without heat.

The project ran from 2001 to April 2003, when the grant from DARPA was prematurely terminated.  Overview  This was a security initiative directed by the University of Pennsylvania Distributed Systems Laboratory and paid for through the Composable High Assurance Trusted Systems programme. POSSE was a US$2,125,000 grant \\"to introduce advanced security features used in special-purpose government computers into standard office PCs.\\" The United States government hoped to benefit from the availability of better security features in affordable, standardized computers and software.

The term can be used in a mildly derogatory sense, but in common usage today is simply pre-arranged questions from a friendly audience member. Often, the question has been written by the Minister or their staff rather than by the questioner, and is used to give the Minister a chance to promote themselves or the work of the Government, or to criticise the opposition party's policies, to raise the profile of the backbench Member asking the question, or to consume the time available for questioning and thereby avoid tougher questions. It is a common and widely accepted tactic during Question Time in the House of Representatives and the Senate. While it is rare, it would be possible for a backbencher on the Government side of the house to ask a member of the Government a question without it being regarded as a Dorothy Dixer. Such a question would be one that the Minister had not planted and was not aware of in advance. It is common for \\"Dorothy Dixers\\" to end in the question: \\"Is the Minister aware of any alternative policies?\\" This enables the responding Minister to launch into extended criticism of the Opposition and its policy on the question's subject matter, while still remaining technically relevant to the question as asked, as Standing orders require.  History  The term references American advice columnist Dorothy Dix's reputed practice of making up her own questions to allow her to publish more interesting answers. \\"Dorothy Dixer\\" has been used in Australian politics since the 1950s, and has become increasingly common in everyday usage, although the term is now frequently shortened to \\"Dixer\\".

An optical microcavity or microresonator is a structure formed by reflecting faces on the two sides of a spacer layer or optical medium, or by wrapping a waveguide in a circular fashion to form a ring. The former type is a standing wave cavity, and the latter is a traveling wave cavity. The name microcavity stems from the fact that it is often only a few micrometers thick, the spacer layer sometimes even in the nanometer range. As with common lasers this forms an optical cavity or optical resonator, allowing a standing wave to form inside the spacer layer, or a traveling wave that goes around in the ring.  Applications and effects  The fundamental difference between a conventional optical cavity and microcavities is the effects that arise from the small dimensions of the system, but their operational principle can often be understood in the same way as for larger optical resonators. Quantum effects of the light's electromagnetic field can be observed. For example, the spontaneous emission rate and behaviour of atoms is altered by such a microcavity, a phenomenon that is referred to as inhibited spontaneous emission. One can imagine this as the situation that no photon is emitted, if the environment is a box that is too small to hold it. This leads to an altered emission spectrum, which is significantly narrowed. Moreover, nonlinear effects are enhanced by orders of magnitude due to the strong light confinement, leading to the generation of microresonator frequency combs, low- power parametric processes such as down-conversion, second-harmonic generation, four-wave mixing and optical parametric oscillation. Several of these nonlinear processes themselves lead to the generation of quantum states of light. Another field that harnesses the strong confinement of light is cavity optomechanics, where the back-and-forth interaction of the light beam with the mechanical motion of the resonator becomes strongly coupled. Even in this field, quantum effects can start playing a role. Microcavities have many applications, frequently at present in optoelectronics, where vertical cavity surface emitting lasers VCSEL are probably the best known. Recently, a single photon emitting device was demonstrated by placing a quantum dot in a microcavity. These light sources are interesting for quantum cryptography and quantum computers. An overview is given in the review article published in the journal Nature.  Types  = Standing-wave = For a microcavity supporting a single-mode or a few standing-wave modes, the thickness of the spacer layer determines the so-called \\"cavity-mode\\", which is the one wavelength that can be transmitted and will be formed as a standing wave inside the resonator. Depending on the type and quality of the mirrors, a so-called stop-band will form in the transmission spectrum of the microcavity, a long range of wavelengths, that is reflected and a single one being transmitted (usually in the centre). There are different means of fabricating standing-wave microcavities, either by evaporating alternating layers of dielectric media to form the mirrors (DBR) and the medium inside the spacer layer or by modification of semiconductor material or by metal mirrors. = Traveling-wave = Often just called \\"microresonators\\", traveling wave microcavities have a wave going around in a loop-like fashion in a preferred direction, depending on the input light direction. They can be in the form of whispering-gallery resonators, or as integrated ring resonators. Typical materials from which they are made could be semiconductors like Silicon, Silicon dioxide, silicon nitride, crystalline fluorides (CaF2, MgF2, SrF2) or lithium niobate. The material is chosen such that it is low-loss and transparent in the wavelength of application desired. Typically, such structures are fabricated by either diamond turning or micromachining a cylindrical rod of a material (especially for fluorides and lithium niobate), or by photolithography and electron-beam lithography to produce a patterned resonator on chip (for silicon-based materials). When an integer number of wavelengths in the material fits in the circumference of the resonator, a resonant wave is excited by constructive interference. At resonance, the light field can be enhanced by several hundred to several million times, quantified by the Finesse Coefficient of the resonator. This also leads to an ultrahigh quality factor, meaning that light travels around the circumference many million times before decaying into the surroundings.

Origins The spur to the Club's foundation was the sale of the enormous library of the Duke of Roxburghe (who had died in 1804), which took place over 46 days in May‚ÄìJuly 1812. The auction was eagerly followed by bibliophiles, the high point being the sale on 17 June 1812 of a first edition of Boccaccio's Decameron, printed by Christophorus Valdarfer of Venice in 1471, and sold to the Marquis of Blandford for ¬£2,260, the highest price ever given for a book at that time. (The Marquis already possessed a copy, but one that lacked 5 pages.) That evening, a group of eighteen collectors met at the St Albans Tavern, St Albans Street (later renamed Waterloo Place) for a dinner presided over by the 2nd Earl Spencer, and this is regarded as the origin of the Roxburghe Club. A toast drunk on that occasion has been repeated at every annual anniversary dinner since to the \\"immortal memory of John Duke of Roxburghe, of Christopher Valdarfer, printer of the Boccaccio of 1471, of Gutenberg, Fust and Schoeffer, the inventors of the art of printing, of William Caxton, Father of the British press [and others; and] the prosperity of the Roxburghe Club and the Cause of Bibliomania all over the world\\". It was decided to make the dinner an annual event: further members were admitted the following year. The club was formed by Thomas Frognall Dibdin, author of the book Bibliomania; or Book-Madness (1809), who served as its first secretary; and the club was formalised under Earl Spencer's presidency. Membership The Club has had a total of 350 members from its foundation to 2017. The circle has always been an exclusive one, with just one \\"black ball\\" (negative vote) being enough to exclude an applicant. Since 1839 the number of members at any one time has been limited to forty. A photograph exists of the membership in 1892, including the Prime Minister Arthur Balfour and anthropologist Andrew Lang, as well as American poet James Russell Lowell, Alfred Henry Huth, and Simon Watson Taylor. James Gascoyne-Cecil, Viscount Cranborne, was then President. The first female member was Mary, Viscountess Eccles, elected in 1985. In 2011, the Australian comedian Barry Humphries was elected a member. The President since 1998 has been Max Wyndham, 2nd Baron Egremont. Publications The Club rapidly became more than a merely social institution. Each member was (and remains) expected to sponsor the publication of a rare or curious volume. Other volumes are published by the Club collectively. Initially the volumes were editions of early blackletter printed texts (the first, in 1814, was the Earl of Surrey's translation of parts of Virgil's Aeneid, originally printed in 1557); but from as early as 1819 they began to include texts taken from manuscript originals. The standards of scholarship are high, and the quality of printing, facsimile reproduction, and binding is lavish. Copies of each volume (in a fine binding) are presented to all members, and a limited number of extra copies (generally in a less lavish binding) may be made available for sale to non-members.

Initially a bebopper, he became a pioneer of free-form jazz. Born in Kingston, Harriot moved to the United Kingdom as a working musician in 1951 and lived in the country for the rest of his life. Harriott was part of a wave of Caribbean jazz musicians who arrived in Britain during the 1950s, including Dizzy Reece, Harold McNair, Harry Beckett and Wilton Gaynair.  Early life and career  Born in Kingston, Jamaica, in 1928, Harriott was educated at Alpha Boys School, an orphanage in the city. At Alpha he learned to play the clarinet, the instrument that was assigned to him shortly before his tenth birthday. He took up the baritone and tenor saxophone while performing with local dance bands before settling on the alto saxophone. Harriott arrived in London in the summer of 1951, aged 23, as a member of Ossie Da Costa's band. British subjects did not require work-permits or immigration visas at that time. When the band had completed their tour Harriott decided to stay in London. He caught the attention of London's jazz scene while sitting in at the Feldman Club on Oxford Street on 26 August 1951. Like the majority of alto players of his generation, he was deeply influenced by Charlie Parker. Harriott developed a style that fused Parker with his own Jamaican musical sensibility - most notably the mento and calypso music he grew up with. Even in his later experiments, Harriott's roots were always audible. However, it was his mastery of bebop that gained him immediate kudos within the British jazz scene upon his arrival in London. During the 1950s, he had two long spells with drummer Tony Kinsey's band, punctuated by membership of Ronnie Scott's short-lived big band, occasional spells leading his own quartet and working in the quartets of drummers Phil Seamen and Allan Ganley. Harriott began recording under his own name in 1954, releasing a handful of E.P. (extended play) records for Columbia, Pye/Nixa and Melodisc throughout the 1950s. However, the majority of his 1950s recordings were as a sideman with the musicians previously mentioned, also backing a diverse array of performers, from mainstream vocalist Lita Roza to traditional trombonist George Chisholm to the West African sounds of Buddy Pipp's Highlifers. Harriott also appeared alongside visiting American musicians during this period, including a \\"guest artist\\" slot on the Modern Jazz Quartet's 1959 UK tour. He formed his own quintet in 1958, and their style of hard-swinging bebop was noticed in the United States, leading to the release of the Southern Horizons and Free Form albums on the American Jazzland label.  Free-form innovator  By now firmly established as a bebop soloist, in 1960 Harriott turned to what he termed \\"abstract\\" or \\"free-form\\" music. He had some loose free-form ideas by the mid-1950s, but finally settled upon his conception in 1959, after a protracted spell in hospital with tuberculosis. At first he struggled to recruit other like-minded musicians to his vision. Indeed, two of his core band members, Harry South and Hank Shaw, left when these ideas surfaced. He finally settled on a line-up of Shake Keane (trumpet, flugelhorn), Pat Smythe (piano), Coleridge Goode (bass) and Phil Seamen (drums). Les Condon temporarily replaced Keane on trumpet in 1961, while Seamen left permanently the same year, his place taken by the return of the quintet's previous drummer, Bobby Orr. Frank Holder toured with Harriott and contributed to recording projects during this period. Harriott's free-form music is often compared to Ornette Coleman's roughly contemporary breakthrough in the United States, but even cursory listening reveals deep divisions between their conceptions of \\"free jazz\\". Indeed, there were several distinctive models of early free jazz, from Cecil Taylor to Sun Ra. Harriott's was another of these. His method demanded more complete group improvisation than displayed in Coleman's music, and often featured no particular soloist. Instead of the steady pulse of Ornette's drummer and bass player, Harriott's model demanded constant dialogue between musicians, which created an ever- shifting soundscape. Tempo, key and meter always free to alter in this music, and often did so. The presence of Bill Evans-inspired pianist Pat Smythe also gave the band a completely different texture to Coleman's, which had dispensed with the need for a pianist early on. Harriott's own playing style underwent some changes during this period, dispensing with orthodox bebop lines in favour of more angular, cut up phrasing. What remained however, was his lyricism, searing tone and sense of attack. Harriott was always keen to communicate his ideas, be it on stage, in interviews or album liner notes. In 1962, he wrote in the liner notes for his Abstract album, \\"of the various components comprising jazz today - constant time signatures, a steady four- four tempo, themes and predictable harmonic variations, fixed division of the chorus by bar lines and so on, we aim to retain at least one in each piece. But we may well, if the mood seems to us to demand it, dispense with all the others\\". He recorded three albums in this vein: Free Form (Jazzland, 1960), Abstract (Columbia (UK), 1962) and Movement (Columbia (UK), 1963). Abstract received a five-star review from Harvey Pekar in DownBeat, the first such honour for a British Jazz record. Free Form and Abstract together formed a perfect pair of cohesive, trailblazing free jazz sessions. The next album, Movement, featured some of his most fiercely abstract compositions, but these were tempered by some other, more straight-ahead pieces.  Jazz fusions  Harriott's free-form compositions normally formed only a portion of live gigs. Indeed, the final album recorded by the quintet, 1964's High Spirits (Columbia), was a straight-ahead jazz interpretation of compositions from the musical of that name, which was based on the No√´l Coward play Blithe Spirit. However, the continuing hostility of the older British jazz establishment to free form, and the drying up of recording and performance opportunities, saw Harriott's quintet cease to be sustainable in the changing musical climate of mid-1960s Britain. The quintet effectively broke up when Shake Keane moved to Germany in 1965. From this point onwards, Harriott worked freelance on a number of projects. He made several albums and EPs with pianist/composer Michael Garrick in the mid-sixties, notably Promises, October Woman and Black Marigolds. The latter two were reissued by Dutton Vocalion on CD in 2005, and Garrick's Poetry and Jazz In Concert albums (which also featured Harriott) were released on CD by the same label in 2006. Another notable recording as a sideman was with the bluesman Sonny Boy Williamson II, on a 1964 session that also featured Jimmy Page. During the late 1960s he and violinist John Mayer developed Indo-Jazz Fusion - an early attempt at building on music from diverse traditions. This involved a \\"double quintet\\" of five Indian and five jazz musicians playing together on a number of compositions largely conceived by Mayer. Opinion is divided on the success of these experiments. At their best, they offered a new and unique fusion of styles, but at times one can also detect a restriction on the freedom of the jazzmen to improvise. Three albums resulted from the collaboration with Mayer: Indo-Jazz Suite (Atlantic 1966) Indo-Jazz Fusions Volumes 1 and 2 (Columbia (UK), 1967 and 1968). Two other Harriott albums appeared in 1967 and 1968. The first, Swings High (Melodisc), was a strangely retrospective-sounding, but outstanding bebop record featuring old cohorts Seamen, Goode and Smythe; 1968's Personal Portrait (Columbia) was a mixed bag of jazz with strings and some affecting work with old bandmate Smythe and Stan Tracey. In 1969, Harriott recorded the album Hum-Dono in collaboration with the Goan guitarist Amancio D'Silva. This was an unqualified success. Also featuring trumpeter Ian Carr and vocalist Norma Winstone, this album presented a more subtle and fluid mix of Harriott's signature alto sound with D'Silva's unique Indo-bebop guitar style. Also in 1969, Harriott made an appearance at Stan Tracey's Duke Ellington tribute concert, which was also released as the album We Love You Madly on Columbia. Harriott contributed a moving solo on \\"In a Sentimental Mood\\" that was captured for posterity by TV cameras, thus leaving the only existing footage of him in performance. He also made an important contribution to composer Laurie Johnson's 1970 LP, Synthesis (also Columbia).  Last years  Harriott's work in 1969 was to be the last substantial performances of his career. While he continued to play around Britain wherever he was welcome, no further recording opportunities arose. He was virtually destitute in his last years, and ravaged by illness. He died of cancer on 2 January 1973, and is buried in Bitterne churchyard, in Southampton. On his gravestone, his own oft- quoted words provide his epitaph: \\"Parker? There's them over here can play a few aces too.\\"  Legacy  Since his death, Harriott's often overlooked contribution to the birth of free jazz has gradually been recognised. While he influenced important European free jazz pioneers such as John Stevens, Evan Parker and Albert Mangelsdorff, in the States his profile and influence was much smaller, despite the admiration of such figures as Charles Mingus. He also suffered mightily from lazy journalistic comparisons with Ornette Coleman, but more recently his originality has been recognised across the globe. American saxophonist Ken Vandermark's CD of Harriott free-form compositions, entitled Straight Lines, has introduced his music to another generation of free jazz fans. British players such as Courtney Pine, Gary Crosby and more recently Soweto Kinch have also acknowledged his influence and played his music on stage. An important biography by Alan Robertson,Alan Robertson, Joe Harriott: Fire In His Soul, Northway Publications, 2003. 2nd edn, 2011.Dennis Harrison, review of Joe Harriott: Fire In His Soul, December 2003. as well as the publication of Coleridge Goode's poignant reminiscences of him,Coleridge Goode and Roger Cotterrell, Bass Lines: A Life in Jazz, Northway Publications, 2002. Reissued 2014.Review of Bass Lines A Life In Jazz, Jazz Script. have helped to make Harriott's story more widely known. Harriott's profile has also been helped by CD reissues of his most important albums, notably Abstract, Free Form and Movement. However, other key albums such as Hum-Dono have yet to be reissued. In recent years, other recordings of Harriott in his prime have surfaced. Michael Garrick has compiled and released a CD on his own Jazz Academy label, entitled Genius. This consists of some early 1960s live performances and home recordings made with a pianist friend, William Haig-Joyce. In 2006, a 1963 live recording made at a small club in Leicester was unearthed and issued on CD, entitled Live At Harry's. In early 2007, many of his hard-to-find mid-1950s sessions, both as leader and sideman, were made available on the double-CD compilation Killer Joe. A four-CD set entitled The Joe Harriott Story (Proper Box) was issued in 2011.Dave Gelly, \\"Joe Harriott: The Joe Harriott Story ‚Äì review\\", The Observer, 30 October 2011.

Suvorov Museum, Izmail Small Mosque in Izmail Port of Izmail Danube River Izmail (, translit. Izmayil; , translit. Izmail, formerly –¢—É—á–∫–æ–≤ (\\"Tuchkov\\"); or Smil; , ) is a historic city on the Danube river in Odessa Oblast in south-western Ukraine. Administratively, Izmail is incorporated as a city of oblast significance. It also serves as the administrative center of Izmail Raion, one of twenty-six districts of Odessa Oblast, though it is not a part of the district. In Russian historiography Izmail is associated with the 18th century sacking of Ottoman fortress of Izmail by Russian general Alexander Suvorov. It is the largest Ukrainian port in the Danube Delta, on its Chilia branch. As such, Izmail is a center of the food processing industry and a popular regional tourist destination. It is also a base of the Ukrainian Navy and the Ukrainian Sea Guard units operating on the river. The World Wildlife Fund's Isles of Izmail Regional Landscape Park is located nearby. Population:  History  The entrance to the territory of the Izmail Fortress The fortress of Izmail was built by Genoese merchants in the 12th century. It belonged for a short period of time to Wallachia (14th century) ‚Äì as the territory north of the Danube was one of the possessions of the Basarabs (later the land being named after them, Bessarabia). The town was first mentioned with the name Ismailiye, derived from the name of the Ottoman Grand Vizier Izmail. From the end of the 14th century, Izmail was under the rule of Moldavia. In 1484, the Ottoman state conquered the territory, which became from that moment an Ottoman protectorate (under direct rule from 1538). Since the early 16th century it was the main Ottoman fortress in the Budjak region. In 1569 Sultan Selim II settled Izmail with his Nogai subjects, originally from the North Caucasus. After Russian general Nicholas Repnin took the fortress of Izmail in 1770, it was heavily refortified by the Turks, so as never to be captured again. The Sultan boasted that the fortress was impregnable, but during the Russo-Turkish War of 1787‚Äì1792 the Russian Army commander Alexander Suvorov successfully stormed it on 22 December 1790. Ottoman forces inside the fortress had the orders to stand their ground to the end, haughtily declining the Russian ultimatum. The defeat was seen as a catastrophe in the Ottoman Empire, while in Russia it was glorified in the country's first national anthem, Let the thunder of victory sound!. Suvorov announced the capture of Ismail in 1791 to the Empress Catherine in a doggerel couplet, after the assault had been pressed from house to house, room to room, most of the garrison and support forces in the city had been killed in three days, a few hundred taken into captivity. For all his bluffness, Suvorov later told an English traveler that when all was over he went back to his tent and wept.J. Goodwin, Lords of the Horizons, p. 244, 1998, Henry Holt and Company, At the end of the war, Izmail was returned to the Ottoman Empire, but Russian forces took it for the third time on 14 September 1809. After it was ceded to Russia with the rest of Bessarabia by the 1812 Treaty of Bucharest, the town was rebuilt thoroughly. The Intercession Cathedral (1822‚Äì36), the churches of Nativity (1823), St. Nicholas (1833) and several others date back to that time. Izmail's oldest building is the small Turkish mosque, erected either in the 15th or 16th centuries, converted into a church in 1810 and currently housing a museum dedicated to the 1790 storm of Izmail. The 1790 siege of Izmail; by Aleksey Kivshenko. After Russia lost the Crimean War, the town returned to the Principality of Moldavia, which would soon become part of the Romanian Principalities. Russia gained control of Izmail again after the Russo-Turkish War of 1877‚Äì1878. With the breakup of the Russian Empire in 1917 and in the aftermath of World War I, the city was occupied by the Romanian Army on 22 January 1918, after a skirmish with troops of the Danube flotilla. Later that year, the Sfatul »öƒÉrii of Chi»ôinƒÉu, which claimed to be the representative of the whole of Bessarabia, voted to formally unite the region with Romania. This union was recognized by the United Kingdom, France and Italy in the Treaty of Paris, but not by the Soviet Union which had territorial claims over Bessarabia. In 1940, and again during World War II, it was occupied by the Soviet Red Army and included (August 1940) in the Ukrainian SSR; the region was occupied in 1941‚Äì1944 by the Romanian Army participating in Operation Barbarossa. During the Soviet period following World War II, many Russians and Ukrainians migrated to the town, gradually changing its ethnic composition. Izmail Oblast was formed in 1940 and the town remained its administrative center until the oblast was merged to Odessa Oblast in 1954. Since 24 August 1991, Izmail has been part of independent Ukraine.  Geography  = Climate = Under the K√∂ppen classification, Izmail has a humid continental climate (Dfa) with four distinct seasons and generous precipitation year-round, typical for the inland South. Summers are hot and humid, with temperatures somewhat moderated by the city's elevation. Winters are cool but variable, with an average of 48 freezing days per year.  Demographics  Before 1920, the population of Izmail was estimated at 37,000. During that time, approximately 11,000 of the population were Jewish, 8,000 Romanians and 6,000 Germans. Additional members of the population were Russians, Bulgarians, Turks and Cossacks. * 2008 ‚Äî 77,076 people; * 2011 ‚Äî 75,581 people.–ì–æ—Å—É–¥–∞—Ä—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω—ã–π –∫–æ–º–∏—Ç–µ—Ç —Å—Ç–∞—Ç–∏—Å—Ç–∏–∫–∏ –£–∫—Ä–∞–∏–Ω—ã. –°–±–æ—Ä–Ω–∏–∫: –ß–∏—Å–ª–µ–Ω–Ω–æ—Å—Ç—å –Ω–∞–ª–∏—á–Ω–æ–≥–æ –Ω–∞—Å–µ–ª–µ–Ω–∏—è –£–∫—Ä–∞–∏–Ω—ã –Ω–∞ 1 —è–Ω–≤–∞—Ä—è 2011. –ö–∏–µ–≤ 2011. –û—Ç–≤–µ—Ç—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω–∞—è –∑–∞ –≤—ã–ø—É—Å–∫ –¢–∏–º–æ—à–µ–Ω–∫–æ –ì. –í.

It was bought and marketed by the Apple Inc. subsidiary Claris. In addition to internet email, it supported sending and receiving email to online services such as AOL, Applelink, Compuserve. It was the only third-party e-mail client licensed to directly access AOL e-mail. Additionally, it was one of the first commercial applications to support the Internet Config preferences management system. It had advanced e-mailing features for its time, such as automatic e-mail address completion, an intuitive address book, support for multiple signatures, and a scriptable interface. Many AppleScripts have been written that enhance Emailer and are available online. It was released both in a full and a lite version, and the latter was included for free in Mac OS 8. It remained a Mac-only software title until it was eventually killed by Apple in the late 90s. The last version, 2.0v3, was released in 1998, and the software title is no longer supported by Apple. Emailer continues to work in the Classic Environment running under Mac OS X v10.4 Tiger. To date an Emailer-Talk mailing list is still active offering advice to keep the software functioning.

It is believed the application file contains the expiration date, which means when the demo expires, it can be reinstalled; copying the new application file to the old install folder and a user can continue for another demo period. (the expiration date may be in the Mail Database, preventing a user from doing this). No update patches could be applied to this version, so users are stuck at 2.0v1 with the Demo version. *2.0v2 ‚Äì Some new features and bug fixes added to 2.0.

This is the last US English version. It was quickly released after Apple pulled the plug on the Emailer project. (The project was cancelled along with all other non-FileMaker Claris products when Claris became FileMaker, Inc. It was certified the day before the company changed names.) The major functional difference in 2.0v3 is Y2K support was added. There is an updater to go to 2.0v3. The updater works on: 2.0v1 or 2.0v2. There is no need to install the v2 updater first, a user can jump right from 2.0v1 to 2.0v3. The updater will only work on US English versions of Emailer, but not on any International versions. International users are stuck at 2.0v2. A stand-alone installer of a full copy of 2.0v3 exists. Both versions were issued in multiple floppy disk form, as well as single-file installer. =Patches= Due to changes in ISP methods of authentication, three patched versions have been issued by members of the Emailer-Talk mailing list as follows: *2.0v3p1 ‚Äì Reverses the POP/SMTP order of Emailer's full check. Emailer normally tries to send mail, and then check mail, the patch makes Emailer check mail and then send mail. This lets Emailer auto POP authenticate itself a little easier (no need to do a check twice in a row). This patch is based on the 2.0v3 US English PPC-only version of Emailer, and as such will only install on that version. It does not work with a 68k version of Emailer, or a FAT version of Emailer (68k and PPC). Exists as a Rescompare Patcher, or as a pre-patched copy. *2.0v3p2 ‚Äì Adds multiple @ sign support to the Email Account field. This allows you to have an account username that is a full e-mail address (i.e.: myusername@mydomain.com@mail.mydomain.com). This patch is based on the 2.0v3 US English PPC-only version (same as above). It also includes the p1 patch. Patch and pre-patched versions exist. *2.0v3p3 ‚Äì Adds limited SMTP Authentication support. It uses the same username and password that are used by the POP settings. There is no option to set it to use any other username/password combo, so it will only work for people who are sending e-mail through the same system they are collecting from. Patch is based on the 2.0v3 US English PPC-only version (same as above). It also includes the p1 and p2 patches. Patch and pre-patched versions of the application only exist.

He is a six-time winner of the German Referee of the Year Award and the record holder in games refereed in the Bundesliga. In 2005, Merk was awarded the German Bundesverdienstkreuz (Federal Cross of Merit) in recognition of his service to football and his charity work in India. He ended his career by refereeing the match between Bayern Munich and Hertha BSC Berlin on the last day of the 2007‚Äì08 Bundesliga season on 17 May 2008. He was ranked the best referee by the International Federation of Football History & Statistics in 2004, 2005 and 2008. He is currently a pundit for Sky Deutschland and was the main referee commentator of the Turkish football channel Lig TV (which has the rights of the Turkish Super League) in 2010‚Äì2011 season. Bundesliga career In 1988, Merk was appointed the youngest Bundesliga referee ever, aged 25, representing his home club 1. FC Kaiserslautern. He became a FIFA referee four years later, and officiated at the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona. In the following years, Merk established himself as a headstrong, reliable referee. He was elected an unprecedented six times as German Referee of the Year. UEFA career Merk's refereeing of the final match of UEFA Euro 2004 was strongly opposed by Portugal. Portugal's opponent was Greece, whose team's coach, Otto Rehhagel, was a dental patient of Merk. Nevertheless, Merk received worldwide recognition for his excellent refereeing in this game. On 21 April 2004, during a Champions League semi-finals match against former team Porto, Jorge Andrade, Deportivo's defender, was sent off by Merk for a kick on Deco. The gesture was of a friendly nature, but the referee was eluded by it, and immediately gave the defender his marching orders. He was forced to serve a one-match ban. Eventually Jose Mourinho's team would qualify to the final. In the 2004‚Äì05 Champions League quarter-finals he whistled the second leg game between AC Milan and Inter Milan and controversially dissalowed the goal from Inter-player Esteban Cambiasso, which led to Inter-fans throwing bottles and flares onto the pitch and the game was eventually abandoned. Another controversial moment came in the 71st minute of a match between Artmedia and Porto on 6 December 2005, when Merk overlooked a handball by Pepe in the penalty area. If given and scored, the penalty would have sent Artmedia through to the round of 16. FIFA career Merk was referee in the 1992 Olympics (two call-ups), fourth official in the 1993 World Cup qualifier between the Netherlands and England (During this match Merk repeatedly restrained the furious England manager Graham Taylor, when a penalty and red card decision had gone against England. Taylor felt Ronald Koeman should have been sent off and England have a penalty for a professional foul on David Platt. Neither happened and Koeman went on to score against England. Taylor was furious at the referee, though years later, in an interview with the Observer, he expressed gratitude to Merk for not sending him to the stands when he could have), the UEFA Euro 2000 (3), the 2002 FIFA World Cup (2) and the UEFA Euro 2004 (3). In that tournament, he also whistled the final, becoming the first German referee since Rudi Gl√∂ckner of East Germany in 1970, to helm a World Cup or European Championship Finals. His assistants were Jan- Hendrik Salver and Christian Schr√§er. Merk also refereed the 1997 UEFA Cup Winners' Cup Final, and the 2003 UEFA Champions League Final. He was the referee in the semi final of the 2003 FIFA Confederations Cup between Cameroon and Colombia, a game remembered for the death of Marc-Vivien Fo√©. In the 2006 World Cup, he whistled three matches. The United States vs. Ghana game was the last game in the 2006 World Cup for Merk, as he was not chosen to referee any of the games in the knockout stages. Merk was highly critical of the whole FIFA refereeing process after that, stating in the German sports TV show das aktuelle Sportstudio, it \\"robbed me two weeks of my life\\" being forced to stay in the referee camp without a call-up, and adding a mere two was a bitterly meagre payoff regarding the fact he (among others) had to visit countless seminars and were sent on small junior tournaments all over the world to merely assist, comparing it to as if Ronaldinho would have to agree to sit on the bench for the Brazilian U 20 in order to qualify for the World Cup. Merk is also a long-time proponent of instant video replay to judge critical scenes. On 1 March 2008, Werder Bremen striker Markus Rosenberg scored a goal from clear offside position; Merk initially gave the goal, but immediately after that realised it was illegal, but it was too late to retract his error. He called it \\"the most bitter moment of my career\\" and called for introduction of instant replay.Nach Patzer: Merk will den Videobeweis Accolades * DFB German Referee of the Year: 1995, 1996, 2000, 2003, 2004, 2006 * Bundesverdienstkreuz (major order of merit of the Federal Republic of Germany) 2005 Charity The religious Merk is active helping slums in India, providing basic dental care for the poor since 1991. He helps the Indienhilfe Kaiserslautern, which erects schools and housing for the homeless, as well as offering basic medical care. Personal life Merk was born in Kaiserslautern. A dentist by trade, he lives in Otterbach with his wife and son. He was a professional dentist until 2005, when he stopped practising because of his opposition to the so-called Praxisgeb√ºhr, a measure introduced by the German government taxing patients visiting doctors. Today, he leads motivational seminars. During his youth and teens, Merk suffered ridicule because of his high-pitched, squeaky voice. After undergoing extensive speech therapy, he now talks in a normal baritone. (Reference: his book BeWEGEnd). Merk is also one of the fittest referees in the game. He regularly laps his colleagues in the annual fitness tests, and his personal best for a marathon is 2:42. He is also a dedicated triathlete.

The Free Dictionary. Farlex. Retrieved 11 June 2020. ) is a pidgin language lexically based on English, but influenced by a Chinese substratum. From the 17th to the 19th centuries, there was also Chinese Pidgin English spoken in Cantonese-speaking portions of China. Chinese Pidgin English is heavily influenced by a number of varieties of Chinese with variants arising among different provinces (for example in Shanghai and Ningbo). A separate Chinese Pidgin English has sprung up in more recent decades in places such as Nauru.  History  English first arrived in China in the 1630s, when English traders arrived in South China. Chinese Pidgin English was spoken first in the areas of Macao and Guangzhou (City of Canton), later spreading north to Shanghai by the 1830s.Yamuna Kachru and Cecil L. Nelson, World Englishes in Asian Contexts. Hong Kong University Press, 2006. \\"Yangjing Bang English\\" in Chinese (Ê¥ãÊ∂áÊµú, or Ê¥ãÊ≥æÊµú) derives from the name of a former creek in Shanghai near the Bund where local workers communicated with English-speaking foreigners in pidgin (broken English); (Yangjing Bang has since been filled in and is now the eastern part of Yan'an Road, the main east-west artery of central Shanghai). Historically, it was a modified form of English developed in the 17th century for use as a trade language or lingua franca between the English and the Chinese. Chinese Pidgin started in Guangzhou, China, after the English established their first trading port there in 1664. Pidgin English was developed by the English and adapted by the Chinese for business purposes. The term \\"pidgin\\" itself is believed by some etymologists to be a corruption of the pronunciation of the English word \\"business\\" by the Chinese (see ). Chinese Pidgin continued in use until about the end of the 19th century, when Pidgin came to be looked upon by the Chinese as humiliating (because English speakers considered it ridiculous) and so preferred to learn standard English instead. Chinese Pidgin English began to decline in the late 19th century as standard English began to be taught in the country's education system.McArthur, Tom. (2002). Oxford Guide to World English. Oxford: Oxford University Press. hardback, paperback. Chinese Pidgin English spread to regions beyond the Chinese Coast. Many attestations of the language being spoken come from writings of Western travelers in China. Among these are scattered reports of the pidgin being spoken farther inland, such as in Chungking (Chongqing) and Hankow (Hankou), and farther north, in Kyong Song and even Vladivostok.Baker, Philip, and Peter M√ºhlh√§usler. \\"From business to pidgin.\\" Journal of Asian Pacific Communication 1.1 (1990): 111 CPE was also taken beyond China: the large numbers of CPE speakers in Nauru influenced the shaping of Nauruan Pidgin EnglishKim, Ronald I. \\"California Chinese Pidgin English and its historical connections: Preliminary remarks.\\" Journal of Pidgin and Creole languages 23.2 (2008). and there is evidence that it was also taken to Australia, where it altered due to the influence of Australian English and other pidgins.Siegel, Jeff. \\"Chinese Pidgin English in Southeastern Australia: The notebook of Jong Ah Siug\\" Journal of Pidgin and Creole Languages, 24.2, (2009): It is also reported to have been spoken in Singapore and Java.Baker and M√ºhlh√§usler 1990: 111. Kim (2008) says that there is debate among linguists, including Baker, M√ºhlh√§usler, and himself, about whether or not CPE was taken to California by 19th century immigrants. Many features present in California Chinese Pidgin English overlap with features of CPE, but also overlap with many other pidgins. Furthermore, some diagnostic features of CPE are missing or different from California Chinese Pidgin English. On the other hand, because many migrants came from the Canton province in China, where CPE was relatively well-known, it is likely that many migrants to the United States from China had knowledge of the pidgin. At the very least, it is clear that California Chinese Pidgin English should be treated as a distinct variety from CPE as spoken in Coastal China, because it has morphological and syntactic features not found in CPE.Kim 2008: 329-339. Features =Phonology= Robert Hall (1944) gives the following phonemic inventory: *Vowels: [i, …™, e, …õ, √¶, a, …ô, …î, o,  ä, u] *Consonants: [p, t, k, b, d, g, m, n, ≈ã, f, v, Œ∏, √∞, s, z,  É,  í, t É, d í, l, r, h, j, w] Native speakers of English use this inventory. Because most lexical items in CPE are derived from English, native English speakers simply use the pronunciation familiar to them. For non-native English speakers, who were largely Cantonese speakers, [v, Œ∏, √∞, r,  É,  í] are not present, because these sounds are not present in Cantonese.Hall, Robert A. \\"Chinese Pidgin English grammar and texts.\\" Journal of the American Oriental Society (1944): 96 Hall also describes a few morphophonemic alterations. Many verbs ending in consonants may optionally add a vowel, as in [tek(i)] 'to take' and [slip(a)] 'to sleep'. Words ending in [r] and [l], and sometimes [d], optionally omit the final consonant, as in [lit…ô(l)] 'little' and [mo(r)] 'more'. Certain stems also frequently lose their final consonant when before certain suffixes, as in [hwat] 'what?' ([hwasajd] 'where?,' [hwatajm] 'when?,' [hwaf√¶ Éan] 'how?'), [√∞√¶t] 'that' (√∞√¶sajd 'there'), awt 'out' (awsajd 'outside').Hall 1944: 96 Baker and M√ºhlh√§usler point out that Hall's data was taken entirely from native speakers of English, several decades after CPE was widely used. For this reason, they are skeptical of the data presented.Baker and M√ºhlh√§usler 1990: 90 Nonetheless, their own presentation of phonology in CPE is largely the same as Hall's. They state that [s] and [ É] were not phonemically contrastive for Cantonese speakers. Words ending in [f] in English often had an added [o] as in thiefo. Aside from these additions, Baker and M√ºhlh√§usler have few revisions to make to the phonological claims Hall made.Baker and M√ºhlh√§usler 1990: 97-98 =Lexicon= The majority of the words used in CPE are derived from English, with influences from Portuguese, Cantonese, Malay, and Hindi. *catchee: fetch (English catch) *fankuei: westerner (Cantonese) *Joss: God (Portuguese deus) *pidgin: business (English) *sabbee: to know (Portuguese saber) *taipan: supercargo (Cantonese) *two muchee: extremely (English too much)Ansaldo et al. 2010: 80 =Morphology and syntax= Constructions in Chinese Pidgin English, both at the phrase level and sentence level, vary widely in taking English or Chinese structure. Generally speaking, pidgin languages have isolating morphology and so do not inflect nouns and verbs; CPE is no exception.Hall Jr, Robert A. \\"Pidgin English and linguistic change.\\" Lingua 3 (1952): 137-146. Some morphological and syntactic phenomena, which frequently appear in linguistic literature, are listed below. Pronouns Prior to 1800, pronouns conformed largely to British and American English paradigms. Over time, my came to be the only first person singular pronoun in CPE, replacing both I and me. He was used for subject and non-subject referents alike (Baker and M√ºhlh√§usler 1990: 104). Plural pronouns were expressed as in English by native English speakers;Hall 1944: 97 we have too little data from native Cantonese speakers to determine if they pluralized pronouns.Baker and M√ºhlh√§usler 1990: 104 Topic‚Äìcomment In CPE, once a noun has been explicitly stated, it does not need to be stated again in following sentences where that item would normally be found. This means that in a given sentence, the subject or object may be omitted. In the example below, \\"very poor people\\" is the subject for the following clauses, although they do not explicitly state it. *\\"this have very poor place and very poor people: no got cloaths, no got rice, no got hog, no got nothing; only yam, little fish, and cocoa-nut; no got nothing make trade, very little make eat\\"Keate, 1788; quoted in Baker and M√ºhlh√§usler 1990: 100 The omitted noun may also be loosely related to the predicate, rather than a subject or object. In the sentence below, meaning 'He won't sell at that price,' the omitted \\"that pricee\\" is neither a subject nor an object. *\\"(that pricee) he no sellum\\"Instructor IV.77; quoted in Ansaldo et al. 2010: 88 Copula A word derived from English have was the usual copula in CPE until 1930. It usually appears as hab or hap. Belong is also used.

The following is a list of English expressions which may have been influenced by Chinese. * long time no see is similar to the Chinese phrase :( (Mandarin traditional), (Cantonese), (Mandarin simplified), meaning \\"haven't seen [you] in a long time\\", further meaning \\"we have not seen each other in a long time\\"). The Oxford English Dictionary states that \\"long time no see\\" originated in the United States as \\"a jocular imitation of broken English.\\"Oxford English Dictionary, long time no see * look-see :( ) This phrase is attributed to Chinese pidgin English by the Oxford English dictionary.Oxford English Dictionary, look-see * No this no that :No ____, no ____ predates the origin of Chinese Pidgin English,Oxford English dictionary, no ___ no ____ and variants but is also a notable example of fabricated pidgin English: ( ) meaning \\"If you don't have a laundry receipt, I won't give you your shirts\\", said to be a fabricated pidgin English inaccurately attributed to the Chinese laundry proprietors. In 1886, a New York City bill cited this phrase in reference to Chinese-owned dry cleaning establishments. In 1921 a movie titled \\"No Tickee No Shirtee\\" further popularized the saying. Another famous use of this phrase is \\"No money, no talk\\" ( (Cantonese)), which simply means \\"If you don't have the money, don't try to bargain with me\\". * No go, from which is derived No-go area and later No fly zone, clearly follows the grammatical logic of Chinese Pidgin English, though not necessarily based on a specific Chinese expression.

In 1972, after being imprisoned and tortured almost to death by the Communist regime in Czechoslovakia, he was allowed to emigrate to West Germany. He lived the remainder of his life there, and resumed his chess career with considerable success, including playing in the Interzonal in 1976 and winning the West German Championship in 1978. Career Pachman's first chess championship came in 1940, when he became champion of the nearby village of Cista (population 900). The first break in his chess career came in 1943, when he was invited to an international tournament in Prague. World Champion Alekhine dominated the event, with Keres taking second place. Pachman finished ninth in the nineteen-player tournament. Alekhine paid him a compliment in an article in the Frankfurter Zeitung and from the fifth round on, invited him every evening to analyze games and opening variations. \\"I don't have to tell you how a beginner from a village chess club felt at that time\\", Pachman wrote. Pachman went on to become one of the world's leading players. He was awarded the International Master title in 1950 and the Grandmaster title in 1954. He won fifteen international tournaments, but considered sharing second place in Havana 1963, with Mikhail Tal and Efim Geller, behind Viktor Korchnoi, his best tournament result. Pachman won the Czechoslovak championship seven times between 1946 and 1966. He became the champion of West Germany in 1978. He played in six Interzonal tournaments between Saltsj√∂baden 1948 and Manila 1976. He represented Czechoslovakia in eight consecutive Chess Olympiads from 1952 through 1966, usually playing . Pachman before 1970 The most successful year of his career was 1959. After winning the Czechoslovakian championship he went on a South American tour, winning tournaments in Mar del Plata (tied with Miguel Najdorf); Santiago, Chile (tied with Borislav Ivkov); and Lima, Peru (again tied with Ivkov). On this tour he beat the 16-year-old Bobby Fischer twice. Pachman made an even lifetime score against Fischer, +2‚àí2=4. =Politics= Pachman was politically active throughout his life, first as a Communist and later as a staunch anti-Communist. In December 1968, he won a tournament in Athens. Upon his return to Prague, the authorities arrested, imprisoned, and tortured him for months. During this time he attempted suicide: On Christmas Eve 1969, doctors called his wife and told her that he probably would not survive the night. In 1972, Pachman was finally allowed to emigrate to West Germany. He soon became known as a strongly anti-Communist political activist, and his eloquence made him a regular guest on political talk shows. =Author= Pachman was also a prolific author, publishing eighty books in five languages. In the 1950s, he became the world's leading opening expert with the publication of his four-volume opus, Theory of Modern Chess. Pachman considered Modern Chess Strategy, published in 1959, to be his best book. His book Checkmate in Prague recounts his treatment at the hands of the Communist authorities. Notable games *Ludek Pachman vs. Oleg Neikirch, Portoroz 1958, Queen's Gambit Declined, Semi-Tarrasch (D41), . Pachman attacks his opponent's castled king, offering the sacrifice of both bishops. His opponent declines the second bishop, and could have continued the game with 25...Qh7, but it is not easy to find such moves in the limited time. Pachman was a good practical player and knew well where it pays to take a risk in the game. * See also this account of a swindle by Pachman, who deliberately wasted almost an hour on his clock in order to get into and thereby lull his opponent into being swindled.

History  = Self-titled album (2004) = Though the self-titled album was originally the only planned official release under the name I Can Make a Mess Like Nobody's Business, time would prove otherwise. The project spawned from Enders' desire to make music different from The Early November. Background noises, such as a television playing, are heard throughout the album until the eleventh track, \\"End of Background Noise\\" to symbolize the background noises in one's daily life. The main image in the album artwork is a yard rake, which symbolically counters the maple leaf that is associated with The Early November. The last track, \\"Salvy\\", is named after Enders' grandfather. The song \\"The Best Happiness Money Can Buy\\" appeared in a movie trailer for Must Love Dogs. = Revival of the band to present (2010‚Äì2014) = After the announced indefinite hiatus, Enders began recording music under the band name Ace Enders and A Million Different People. After a couple of albums, Ace decided to re-explore I Can Make a Mess Like Nobody's Business. Enders released his second album under the I Can Make a Mess Like Nobody's Business name on March 23, 2010, entitled The World We Know. A music video was made for the song \\"Old Man...........................\\". On September 16, Enders released the third Mess album Dust'n Off the Ol' Guitar. The album featured redone versions of many Early November songs, as well as a couple Ace Enders & A Million Different People songs. The album also featured a new song titled \\"Growing Pains\\". There's also three songs from the album that will be released once the sales reach 5,000. These songs include \\"Pretty Pretty\\", a remix of \\"1000 Times A Day\\", and a full length version of \\"Decoration\\". On December 15, Enders released a Christmas-oriented EP titled Happy Christmas. The EP contains one original song titled \\"Season's Greetings\\", as well as a cover of \\"Christmastime Is Here\\" from the film A Charlie Brown Christmas, and a cover of Charles Brown hit Please Come Home For Christmas. The EP was released Digitally. Enders self-released the fourth \\"I Can Make a Mess Like Nobody's Business\\" album, Gold Rush on May 5, 2011. This album was funded through fan donations through Kickstarter. With The Early November reuniting and touring again, Enders has continued to release to support this project. Along with The Early November, the band was signed to Rise Records. In 2013, the band name has been shortened to \\"I Can Make a Mess\\". This can be seen on both the latest albums Enola, released on June 11, 2013, and Growing In, released on October 9, 2014.

These agencies earn their income via commission, usually from the deal they make with the model and/or the head agency. The top agencies work with big-budget advertising agencies and fashion designers. They invest money into developing their talent so they can increase their status within the industry. These top agencies will help train models, get test shoots, layout portfolios, and put together comp cards (composition photo cards) and other printed materials models need. The agencies find work for models by presenting them to designers, photographers, and ad agencies. The agencies are also responsible for booking the jobs, billing for the jobs, and eventually paying the models for their time. By handling the details, an agency allows a model to focus on modeling and not on the business end. Because modeling is a very competitive, fast moving business that extends beyond the traditional 9 AM to 5 PM business hours, an agency generally conducts business 24 hours a day, to handle emergencies such as cancellations or rush jobs. Most agencies have a service or an operator to handle emergency issues after hours. Industry information =Booking agents versus managers/mother agents= A popular and conventional way for models to build their contacts and get booked for gigs is through model management companies or agencies. An agency specializes in finding gigs for models that are signed with them, while managers are there to guide their models and help them start, develop, and establish successful careers, present models to booking agents, and arrange placements for their models. Mother agents/model managers play a key role in the modeling industry. They provide the constant supply of new faces to booking markets from scouting markets. Most models are from countries like Russia, Hungary, the Netherlands, Poland, the Czech Republic, etc. while booking markets are New York, London, Paris, Milan, Tokyo, Shanghai, etc. =Contractual agreements= Most agencies sign their top talent to exclusive contracts in each market, which vary in length based on the model's industry status and experience. However, because a good agency finds their models work and negotiates top price for their talent, they earn a management commission (between 10% to 20%) from every job they book on a model's behalf. An agency usually bills a client an additional 20% service charge for booking the model, so a typical agency will make between 10-40% on each booking of which no more than 20% comes out of the model's pocket. This varies outside the US due to each country's law and taxes. Other contracts offered by modeling agencies are the mother agency contract and a non-exclusive contract. A mother agency tries to sign you with larger agencies in each international market, while non- exclusive agencies allow you to sign with other agencies (usually outside a certain city radius). Contracts typically last from a year to three years. A mother agency agreement can range from five to ten years.  Poaching  Poaching is the act of signing a model or agent from another agency while they are still under contract, an act that can be seen as financially detrimental to the agency. Typically, the agency sues the other agency for breach of contract. =Mandatory height requirements= High fashion modeling agencies contract with a diverse group of models. However, nearly without exception (unless a model is young enough to still be growing), agencies require women to be between 5'9 (minimum) and 6'0\\" and men to be between 5'11\\" and 6'3\\" and in fit or reasonable physical condition for all heights. =Auditions and open calls= Modelling agencies will require new faces on a regular basis. The number of models in an agency depends on the demand brought in by its agents and changes throughout the year. To this end, modeling agencies advertise in local phone directories in order to remain visible. Each new model-screening process is different from one agency to the next: * A casting call is where models show up by appointment to be considered for a specific job. * An open call is a time specified by an agency for any prospective models (or those interested in becoming models) to show up and be considered for future work. * A go-see is an appointment for a model to meet with a client for consideration for future work; like an open call, it is not for a specific job, but unlike an open call, the model is being specifically requested or sent. * A dry call is where models mail unsolicited comp cards to an agency. While this may work with smaller agencies, larger agencies host open calls where men and women can come into the agency and get seen by agents who may or may not be interested. =Fashion shows and fashion weeks= Agents and talent managers work together to prepare and develop models. One of the most important assignment for models is to work or attend fashion shows or fashion weeks. A fashion show is a runway event put on by fashion designer(s) to showcase their upcoming line of clothing. Each show requires anywhere between 15 and 60 models, depending on the size of the collection and the importance of the designer(s). Fashion models walk the runway (or catwalk) dressed in the clothing created by the designer(s). Participation in these events is essential for any model. A fashion week is a series of shows by different fashion designers. Each show books their own talent, though many models are able to land jobs with multiple designers. This is a model's chance to really get noticed, which can lead to big contracts and very lucrative jobs. Fashion weeks occur twice a year; one for spring collections and one for fall collections. The fashion weeks in major fashion capitals such as New York, Paris, and Milan can have over 100 designers showcasing their work. These weeks are also sponsored by big names, such as Mercedes Benz or Olympus. =Fashion campaigns= Models vie for the prestigious fashion campaigns, where they get to model for a particular designer. One of the most sought-after campaigns is the fragrance campaign, where a model can earn a substantial amount of money. Scams In this constantly changing industry where old agencies close or merge and new ones pop up in their place, scam artists have many opportunities to prey on new, unsuspecting models and aspiring models. A legitimate modeling agency should have knowledge of the marketplace and honestly evaluate models for their market. It will have contacts with photographers, graphic designers, and printers to prepare a model's marketing materials. Texas, Florida, and California have online resources listing licensed agencies. In the United States, the Better Business Bureau registers complaints against agencies that conduct dishonest business practices and scams. Scam artists and untrustworthy agencies generally demand long-term contracts up front and use high-pressure tactics to con models into committing to high-commission percentages or signing over unnecessary rights. An example of a modeling scam is when an agency claims to have work but really what they are doing is trying to sell photoshoots and modeling courses to aspiring models. A legitimate agency should only make profit from agency commissions. A scam was exposed in 2009, when a Louisville-based male modeling agency called \\"Models-Today, LLC\\", owned by a convicted felon named Russell Claxon WHAS 11 News, Louisville, Models- Today, LLC and CLaxon Exposed WHAS 11 News (Part 2) Models-Today and Claxon exposed : Articles of LLC Organization (Kentucky) for Models-Today, LLC was exposed as having never obtained any jobs for the models despite fees in the hundreds of dollars. Due to the unusually large number of consumer complaints filed against the business, including solicitation for gay male prostitution, this story was disseminated across the Better Business Bureau national networks and provides information on how to avoid such scams. Due to a lack of regulatory oversight in the United States, modelling agency scams can be easily carried out and sustained. Models-Today's owner began operating a similar company called Active Male Models, LLC in Kentucky.

In addition, an agent defends, supports and promotes the interest of their clients. Talent agencies specialize, either by creating departments within the agency or developing entire agencies that primarily or wholly represent one specialty. For example, there are modeling agencies, commercial talent agencies, literary agencies, voice-over agencies, broadcast journalist agencies, sports agencies, music agencies and many more. Having an agent is not required, but does help the artist in getting jobs (concerts, tours, movie scripts, appearances, signings, sport teams, etc.). In many cases, casting directors or other businesses go to talent agencies to find the artists for whom they are looking. The agent is paid a percentage of the star's earnings (typically 10%). Therefore, agents are sometimes referred to as \\"10 percenters\\". Various regulations govern different types of agents. The regulations are established by artist's unions and the legal jurisdiction in which the agent operates. There are also professional associations of talent agencies. Talent agents are considered gatekeepers to their client's careers. They have the ability to reshape and reconstruct their client's image. They are dealmakers and assist their client by orchestrating deals within the entertainment industry, more specifically in the Hollywood entertainment industry. In California, because talent agencies are working with lucrative contracts, the agencies must be licensed under special sections of the California Labor Code, which defines an agent as a \\"person or corporation who engages in the occupation of procuring, offering, promising, or attempting to procure employment for an artist or artists.\\"McDonald, Paul.(2008) \\"Hollywood Film Industry\\". Malden, MA: Blackwell Publishing Ltd. p.167-168 Major talent agencies include Endeavor, Creative Artists Agency, United Talent Agency, and ICM Partners. Types of talent agents and agencies =Sports agents= =Literary agent= =Broadcast journalist agencies= Some talent agencies specialize in the representation of television news broadcast journalists and television news magazine hosts. The journalists and hosts represented by these agents primarily work at television stations in local markets or at networks. There are many job titles for broadcast news journalists such as anchors, reporters, weathercasters, sportscasters, correspondents and hosts. =Commercial and theatrical agents= Actors may be interested in working theatrically (stage, film or television) as well as in commercials. Some agents will handle all types of acting work, while others may specialize in a particular area. Some agents work only in the field of television, or only in film and television. Typically, the larger the agency, the more specialized the agents within the agency. An agent has two sets of clients: the \\"talent\\" (actors, models, voice- over artists, etc.) and the \\"buyer\\". The buyer can be a casting director, advertising agency, production company, photographer, or direct client if the client has an \\"in-house\\" production staff. Agents promote talent to the buyers, submitting talent who have the appropriate age, race, sex, look, talent, etc. that the buyer is seeking for his/her project. Usually, an agent submits the actor's head shot or the model's composite card or portfolio to the buyer. After the buyer has made choices, the agent then arranges an audition (or for models, a \\"go-see\\" or open call). After the buyer has met the talent, the buyer will contact the agent if any of the talent will be hired. The agent will coordinate the details of wardrobe, directions, etc., as well as negotiate the contract or pay. Note that the agent's job is to get the talent auditions; the talent is the only person who can get the job. For their work, agents take a 10 to 20% commission of the gross, depending on whether the job is union (such as SAG-AFTRA) or not. Union jobs are paid per negotiated guidelines, but in non-union jobs the pay is sometimes delayed. A well established agent will have networks upon networks of contacts. Also, agents have access to professional casting services. Many of these casting resources are not available to the general public. Although most of the successful agents are private individuals unknown to the public, some are celebrities in their own right. Notable current and former talent agents includes David Begelman, Ari Emanuel, Freddie Fields, Johnny Hyde, Irving Paul Lazar, Sue Mengers, Quincy Sims, Lew Wasserman, Jadin Wong and The Handbook. =Modeling agencies= =Music agents= In the music world, booking agents are different from talent managers. Booking agents are the people who actually book shows for the artists they represent. These agents make all of the arrangements with the promoters of the shows. The booking agent presents the promoter or producer of the concert with a performance agreement, which stipulates the artist's requirements. Items may include lighting, sound, meals, hotel accommodations, and transportation. For concert buyers, they work to find the artist who will fit in the need and available budget. Many of the major booking agencies refuse to represent clients who are not already signed to a major record label and have national distribution of their music. Because of this, artists on independent record labels often seek representation with an independent booking agency. Bars and nightclubs that specialize in presenting live music on a regular basis often employ an individual to assemble the schedule of events. This individual is the venue's buyer, and should not be confused with the booking agent, who presents a roster of available acts to the buyer. Booking agents may also have contacts known as free-lance promoters. These are individuals who agree to produce a concert by locating a venue, providing a sound system and assembling a staff. Producing a show in this manner, at a location rented out for a single evening, is called ‚Äúfour-walling,‚Äù as the process entails renting a venue and receiving no additional services or technical equipment other than the space itself. This has often been the only available option for underground musicians lacking enough popular appeal to gain access to more conventional performance venues (see: Punk rock), but is also used among the genre of raves and various DJ- related events. The cost factor of having a booking agent must be weighed against what the agent can do for clients and buyers alike. Some agents represent several different types of artists, while others represent artists in one main area/genre. Some music agencies deal exclusively with cover bands, listing exclusive and non-exclusive artists on their rosters. In addition, some agencies will also work with a third party company to build specific bands using their own database of vetted musicians, whilst other cover band agencies work with session musicians, that provide a 'flexible' line up for each act. =Cruise ship industry= Booking agents are also used for the cruise ship industry where several different categories of entertainers are needed. These can include individual musicians to be part of the ship's orchestra, small bands and ensembles as well as variety entertainers such as singers, instrumentalists, magicians, comedians and acrobats. Artists looking to work on cruise ships will sign an employment contract with the cruise line and a separate commission contract with the booking agent. The agent will usually be based in the country of origin for the artist. =Music managers= A music manager (or band manager) handles many career issues for bands, singers, record producers, and DJs. A music manager is hired by a musician or band to help with determining decisions related to career moves, bookings, promotions, business deals, recording contracts, etc. The role of music managers is extensive and may include similar duties to that of a press agent, promoter, booking agent, business manager (who is sometimes a certified public accountant), tour managers, and sometimes even a personal assistant. Responsibilities of a business manager are often divided among many individuals who manage various aspects of a musical career. With an unsigned act, music managers must assume multiple roles: booking agent, graphic designer, publicist, promoter, and accountant.When Does My Band Need A Manager? Getsigned.com 16 July 2003 As an artist's career develops, responsibilities grow. A music manager becomes important to managing the many different pieces that make up a career in music. The manager can assist singers, songwriters, and instrumentalists in molding a career, finding music producers, and developing relationships with record companies, publishers, agents, and the music-loving public. The duties of an active music manager will focus on developing a reputation for the musician and building a fan base, which may include mastering and launching a demo CD, developing and releasing press kits, planning promotional activities, and booking shows. A music manager will gain access to a recording studio, photographers, and promotions. He or she will see that CD labels, posters, and promotional materials appropriately represent the band or artist, and that press kits are released in a timely manner to appropriate media. Launching a CD with complementary venues and dates is also a music manager's responsibility. =Online voice talent agents= With the advent of the internet, established and new talent can have a thriving career in the voice over industry through online casting websites. Whilst there are sites that allow any person to join, a new wave of 'professionals only' casting websites is emerging. In an industry where radio and television voice overs can be recorded in home studios because of technology becoming so affordable, high paying jobs are no longer sourced exclusively through traditional voice talent agents. History Since the decline in viewership in theaters, from the 1950s to 1960s, a monumental shift occurred in how studios produced films and reduced the cost of exclusive and expensive actors. After the shift, actors and actresses were working for the studios but were not owned by one major studio entity, and so were able to work with other studios. This shift has meant that agents were now seen as a necessity instead of an option. Agents became third parties who negotiated between studios and clients, making the need for the agents' services an imperative for each party. In the 1980s new agencies were established to compete with the \\"Big five.\\" In 1991 Bauer-Benedek merged with Leading Artists Agency to form what became United Talent Agency. These agencies were Traid Artists and InterTalent.

Various state laws and labor guild rules govern the roles reserved to agents, as well as specifying certain special rights, privileges, and prohibitions.Association of Talent Agents. \\"Talent Agency Licensing,\\" http://www.agentassociation.com/frontdoor/agency_licensing.cfm In the state of California, the labor code requires licensing of talent agencies and includes regulations such as criminal background checks, maintaining separate operating accounts and client trust accounts, and limits total commissions to twenty- five percent, among other regulations.\\"Laws Relating to Talent Agencies,\\" California Department of Industrial Relations, Division of Labor Standards Enforcement. http://www.dir.ca.gov/dlse/talent/talent_laws_relating_to_talent_agencies.pdf In contrast, management companies are described as \\"often unregulated.\\"\\"Agents and Managers,\\" SAG-AFTRA Website. http://www.sagaftra.org/content/agents-and- managers Agents also have certain privileged powers in situations of verbal agreement and can legally agree to a binding employment offer on behalf of their client. A prominent difference between agents and managers under California state law is that licensed talent agents and employment agents are the only entities legally allowed to seek work on behalf of their clients.Busch, Richard (March 25, 2013). \\"Walking on the California Talent Agency Act's Thin Ice: Personal Managers Beware,\\" Forbes. https://www.forbes.com/sites/richardbusch/2013/03/25/walking-on-the- california-talent-agency-acts-thin-ice-personal-managers-beware/ This legal distinction has enabled artists such as the Deftones, Pamela Anderson, Nia Vardalos, Freddie Prinze Jr., and others to break contracts with their managers and avoid commissions owed according to those contracts by proving \\"unlicensed procurement\\" in court.DLSE - Talent Agency Cases. http://www.dir.ca.gov/dlse/dlse-tacs.htm Because the enforcement against talent managers procuring work is largely carried out through civil litigation and not criminal penalties, managers directly seek out work in defiance of state laws, as clients out of self-interest will seldom object to them doing so and cases alleging illegal procurement are infrequent. The Writer's Guild, Screen Actor's Guild, and Director's Guild, among labor guilds, strike agency franchise agreements that specify certain regulations and privileges reserved solely for agents including setting maximum commissions at ten percent of a talent's gross earnings. Managers do not face the same restrictions. See also *Entertainment law *Literary agent (writer's agents) *Modeling agency *Music law *Sports law  References   Further reading  *Passman, Donald S.

Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians describes him as \\"the most celebrated British music critic in the first half of the 20th century.\\" His style of criticism, aiming at intellectual objectivity in contrast to the more subjective approach of other critics, such as Neville Cardus, was reflected in his books on Richard Wagner, Hugo Wolf, Richard Strauss and others. He was music critic of The Sunday Times from 1920 until his death nearly forty years later. Biography =Early years= Newman was born William Roberts in Everton, a district of Liverpool,Newman's widow, Vera, believed that Newman was born in Lancaster but the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians, The Oxford Dictionary of Music, and Newman's obituary in The Observer all give the Liverpool place of birth.

He was educated at St Saviour's School, Everton, Liverpool College and University College, Liverpool, graduating in 1886, where he studied English literature, philosophy and art. He had no formal musical education but taught himself to play the piano \\"after a fashion\\", could read music as easily as books, studied vocal music, composition, harmony and counterpoint, and introduced himself to a wide range of music through reading scores. The young Roberts was intended to pursue a career in the Indian Civil Service, but his health broke down, and he was medically advised not to contemplate residence in India.\\"Newman, Ernest\\", Who Was Who, A & C Black, 1920‚Äì2008; online edition, Oxford University Press, Dec 2007, accessed 10 June 2009\\"Newman, Ernest\\" , Gale Literary Databases: Contemporary Authors He became a clerk in the Bank of Liverpool from 1889 to 1903. In his spare time he acquired complete or partial competence in nine foreign languages, wrote for a number of journals on music, literature, religion and philosophical subjects, and published his first two books, Gluck and the Opera, in 1895 and A Study of Wagner, in 1899. Newman had been brought up as an Anglican, but as an adult he rejected the church. He joined the National Secular Society in 1894, through which he met J. M. Robertson, who became a lifelong friend, influencing his approach to criticism. In 1897, Newman wrote Pseudo-Philosophy at the End of the Nineteenth Century, a critique of imprecise and subjective writing. This displayed, in the words of the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, \\"the three most prominent characteristics of his critical thought: scepticism, dialectic skill, and passion for accuracy.\\" He published the book under the pen name Hugh Mortimer Cecil, but all his other works bore the name Ernest Newman, which he adopted to suggest the fresh approach he intended to take toward his subjects: \\"a new man in earnest\\". He subsequently used the name in his private life as well as his public life, although he never made the change legal. In 1894 Newman married Kate Eleanor Woollett. His early articles on music were written for the composer Granville Bantock's New Quarterly Musical Review. In 1903 as principal of the Birmingham and Midland Institute school of music Bantock invited Newman to join his staff to teach singing and musical theory. =Music critic= Newman moved from Birmingham in 1905 to become music critic of The Manchester Guardian, where he was a controversial reviewer, sometimes displeasing the local musical establishment. Newman condemned Hall√© Orchestra audiences for their complacency, calling them \\"ostriches\\" and \\"vandals\\"; castigated conductor Hans Richter for his old- fashioned and unadventurous programming; and criticised the orchestra's poor standard of performance.Hughes, Meirion, \\"'A thoroughgoing modern': Elgar Reception in the Manchester Guardian, 1896-1908\\". In Riley, Matthew. British Music and Modernism, 1895-1960, Farnham: Ashgate Publishing, Ltd, 2010. p. 44. His trenchancy cost him his job,Heyworth, Peter. \\"Ernest Newman\\", Obituary notice, The Observer, 12 July 1959, p. 10 and he left Manchester the following year, succeeded by Samuel Langford, and moved back to Birmingham as music critic of The Birmingham Post. The Guardian later said of this period in his career, \\"At Birmingham he was at his best, pungent every morning about the latest singer or fiddler, quick to value a new work, while every week he turned his Monday article into an exciting debating-ground.\\"The Guardian Obituary notice, 8 July 1959, p. 5 During his Birmingham years he wrote studies of Richard Strauss (1908), Edward Elgar (1906), Hugo Wolf (1907) and Richard Wagner (1914). His Hugo Wolf remained the only English study of the composer for more than forty years and achieved the distinction of being translated and published in Germany.The Times, Obituary notice, 8 July 1959, p. 8 The Times said of his 1914 Wagner book, \\"His enormous admiration for the artist and his contempt for the man were set out in Wagner as Man and Artist, a powerful book exasperating to the devout believers in the cult of Bayreuth.\\" His first wife died in 1918. In 1919 he married Vera Hands, a former music student at the Midland Institute, and in the same year, finding Birmingham \\"unmusical, and in a general way uncultured\\",Beeson W., \\"Ernest Newman's Departure from Birmingham\\" The Musical Times, 1 May 1919, p. 215 he moved to London as music critic of the Sunday newspaper The Observer. He had previously resisted any move to London, reluctant to undertake the daily schedule of routine concerts that was then expected of music critics on London daily papers, but The Observer offered him conditions that he found irresistibly congenial. =Sunday Times= Within a year Newman was induced to move to the rival Sunday Times. As the critic of a Sunday paper, Newman \\"could pick out the more interesting musical events of the week and discuss them in conjunction and with an air of comparative leisure. His weekly articles soon became a valued feature which all musically minded people had to read.\\" He remained at The Sunday Times from 1920 until his death nearly forty years later, except for a short break when he was guest critic of the New York Evening Post in 1923. He also wrote weekly articles for The Manchester Guardian (1919‚Äì24) and Glasgow Herald (1924‚Äì28) and contributed to The Musical Times between 1910 and 1955 on subjects as varied as Claude Debussy;The Musical Times, May 1910, pp. 293‚Äì96 Women and Music;The Musical Times, June 1910, pp. 359‚Äì61 Elgar;The Musical Times, October 1910, pp. 631‚Äì34 Johannes Brahms;The Musical Times, March 1911, pp. 157‚Äì59 Beethoven's \\"Unsterbliche Geliebte\\";The Musical Times, June 1911, pp. 370‚Äì73 Bayreuth;The Musical Times, September 1911, pp. 576‚Äì78 Franz Liszt;The Musical Times, October 1911, pp. 633‚Äì39 J.

Newman's largest work was The Life of Richard Wagner, in four volumes, published between 1933 and 1947. In 1959, The Times judged it \\"likely to remain the standard biography of Wagner in the English language,\\" and Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians commented in 2009, \\"it has still not been surpassed although research has uncovered much that is new.\\" While working on this study, he paused to write a book about Wagner's father-in-law, Franz Liszt (1934), but Newman was sharply critical of Liszt's character, and it has been maintained that the bias of the book \\"tarnished his critical integrity\\". Other books published by Newman during his Sunday Times years include the popular collections Opera Nights (1944, an unexpected wartime best-seller), Wagner Nights (1949) and More Opera Nights (1954), published in the US under the title Seventeen Famous Operas (1955). Troubled by deteriorating eyesight, Newman ceased to write his weekly Sunday Times article after the autumn of 1958. He died the following year at Tadworth, Surrey, age 90. He was survived by his second wife. Honours and reputation For most of his life, Newman strongly resisted all official honours, but in his old age he agreed to accept the Order of the White Rose of Finland in 1956 and Germany's Grosse Verdienstkreuz in 1958, as well as an honorary doctorate from the University of Exeter in 1959. In 1955 a tribute described as a Festschrift, Fanfare for Ernest Newman was published to mark his golden jubilee as a critic, with contributions from Neville Cardus, Philip Hope-Wallace, Gerald Abraham, Winton Dean, Christopher Hassall and Sir Jack Westrup, among others.The Times, 1 December 1955, p. 3 In 1963, Newman's widow published a memoir of him. Reviewing the book, Jack Westrup wrote, \\"Her narrative records quite simply her day-to-day life with her husband over a period of forty years.... Here is the picture of a relentless worker, frequently struggling with ill health, obstinate in his determination to make enough to live on, groaning under the self-imposed burden of his life of Wagner.... The only faintly disturbing note is the fact that he did not like children.\\"Westrup, J. A. Review of Ernest Newman: a Memoir, Music and Letters Volume 45, Number 1 pp. 75‚Äì76 Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians wrote of Newman: In an obituary tribute, The Observer said of Newman, \\"Unlike most scholars, Newman was unsurpassed as a musical journalist. The vigour of his prose and the sense of a large personality that it breathed, his wit and trenchancy as well as his learning made him beyond question the outstanding critic of his time.\\"\\"Ernest Newman\\", Grove music online, accessed 10 June 2009 Bibliography =Original works= *1895 Gluck and the Opera: A study in Musical History *1899 A Study of Wagner *1904 Wagner *1904 Richard Strauss With a Personal Note by A.

It was established by Robert Edmond Grant in 1828 as a teaching collection of zoological specimens and material for dissection. It is one of the oldest natural history collections in the UK, and is the last remaining university natural history museum in London. Notable specimens and objects held by the museum include a rare quagga skeleton, thylacine specimens, dodo bones and Blaschka glass models.  History  Robert Edmond Grant was the first Chair of Zoology in England, the founder of the Grant Museum collection and its first curator. He set the precedent that the Chair of Zoology at UCL (then the University of London) was also the curator of the comparative zoology collection. On his death Grant left his own collection to the museum, and was briefly succeeded by William Henry Allchin before care of the collection passed to invertebrate zoologist Edwin Ray Lankester in 1875. Lankester was curator until 1891 and added significantly to the museum collection. Later lecturer curators included evolutionary biologist W. F. R. Weldon, Edward Alfred Minchin, embryologist J. P. Hill and palaeontologist D. M. S. Watson. After 1948 the curatorship of the museum was no longer the responsibility of the Chair of Zoology and the museum was under the care of professional curators. The Grant Museum has been in continuous use by students at UCL since 1828, and first opened to the public in 1996. In 2011, the museum moved from its previous location in the Darwin Building on the UCL campus to the Thomas Lewis Room in the Rockefeller Building, formerly the UCL Medical School library.  Collections  The Grant Museum contains around 68,000 zoological specimens, many of which are very rare and several of which have been recently rediscovered. The collection contains specimens from a number of former university collections, including specimens from Imperial College London and Queen Mary University of London in addition to material from London Zoo and various London hospital comparative anatomy collections. The museum also contains specimens from the collections of Thomas Henry Huxley, Karl Pearson, Victor Negus and Doris Mackinnon, and material from the Discovery Expedition and Challenger Expedition.

He played five One Day Internationals (ODIs) for Scotland, all in the 1999 Cricket World Cup. His best ODI bowling figures were two for 24 against Bangladesh in a match where the Bangladeshis were limited to 183, but the Scots wilted in the low chase and Butt, coming in at ten, could only score one run. Life and career He played first-class cricket since October 1983, when he scored 40 not out and took one wicket in a drawn game against Sukkur in the 1983‚Äì84 Patron's Trophy. His career in Pakistan included mainly one-day games, and only yielded one five-wicket-haul ‚Äì in the 1984‚Äì85 Patron's Trophy against a Lahore Division side where he took five for 53 in the second innings. In 1998 he made his debut for Scotland, in a Benson & Hedges Cup game against Yorkshire, where he was named Man of the Match after taking three wickets for 42. However, Yorkshire still won the match by three wickets. His international debut came in the 1998 Triple Crown Tournament, where he ended with the bowling analysis of 10‚Äì3‚Äì14‚Äì1 against Ireland, although this was a minor match that did not have List A status. Butt also played for Scotland in the 2001 ICC Trophy, where he took five for 11 against Fiji, but only got one wicket in the remaining seven games. He did, however, top score in Scotland's five-wicket win over UAE. Butt missed Scotland's first season in English National League cricket in 2003, but came back in 2004 with three wickets against Yorkshire. In a season where Scotland only managed two victories, Butt took 11 wickets at an average of 31.72. He also played three first-class matches in the 2004 Intercontinental Cup, where he was more successful, as he was Scotland's top wicket-taker with 16, including his second career five-for in an eight-wicket win over Ireland ‚Äì in a match where his bowling yielded nine for 72 in total. Butt's contribution played a major part in Scotland's qualification for the semi-finals stage, and he also took the first four wickets of the second innings in the final against Canada, which Scotland won by an innings and 86 runs. Butt played three matches in the 2005 season for Scotland, taking three wickets but being expensive, before he tested positive for MDMA during a match with Somerset. He was subsequently banned from cricket for a year. Butt died in his sleep, aged 42, in Lahore on 30 November 2009.Former Scotland seam bowler Asim Butt dies aged 42, BBC Sport, 1 December 2009. Death controversy Butt's wife Pakistan born Tara now a UK national, claimed that she has strong suspicions that Butt has faked his own death. She believes that the reason for faking his death is the fact that despite of using all possible resources she is unable to get the death certificate yet. Due to Butt's alleged involvement with drugs and affairs, Tara thinks the motive behind faking death is either the drugs or another woman. However, Heriots Cricket Club's representative said they don't find any reason to believe that Butt faked his own death.

Saussure's value the internal, vertical relationship between signifier and signified is distinct from the horizontal relation of values between signs. Value is the sign as it is determined by the other signs in a semiotic system. For linguist Ferdinand de Saussure, for example, the content of a sign in linguistics is ultimately determined and delimited not by its internal content, but by what surrounds it: the synonyms redouter (\\"to dread\\"), craindre (\\"to fear\\"), and avoir peur (\\"to be afraid\\") have their particular values because they exist in opposition to one another. If two of the terms disappeared, then the remaining sign would take on their roles, become vaguer, less articulate, and lose its \\"extra something\\" because it would have nothing to distinguish itself from. For de Saussure, this suggests that thought is a chaotic nebula until linguistic structure dissects it and holds its divisions in equilibriums. This is akin to the philosophy of Sir William Hamilton, who indirectly influenced SaussureThe Poet who could Smell Vowels and believed that the mind could only grasp an idea through distinguishing it from something that it is not. He reasoned that the two objects would otherwise collapse together for the mind and become indistinguishable from one another. Value determines the sign as a whole, not just meaning. Sound is also an indeterminate nebulous. The arbitrary nature of the sign and the flexibility of sound means that an agreed upon contrast is required. For example, \\"zena\\" is useful because it stands in contrast to \\"zenb\\" within an agreed upon system. Without the distinction, \\"zena\\" could be used for absolutely anything, or indeed nothing, making communication an impossibility. It is only the sign as a whole that has value. Linguistic structure simultaneously unites sound with thought and decomposes \\"thought-sound\\" into linguistic units, or signs, consisting of a signifier and a signified (sound-pattern and concept, respectively). When analysed in isolation, the sound-pattern or concept are pure differences, emerging from series of sound-patterns or concepts that they themselves are dependent upon. But in isolation, they are mere abstractions, because neither can exist without the connection between the two. It is the sign as a whole, then, that is the concrete entity of structural linguistics, which is not a pure difference, a negative term, but a pure value, a positive term that is merely in opposition or resistance to all the other signs in the system.  Definitions  = Saussure = Drawing from the original definition proposed by Saussure (1857‚Äì1913), a sign has two parts: *as a signifier, i.e. it will have a form that a person can see, touch, smell, and/or hear, and *as the signified, i.e. it will represent an idea or mental construct of a thing rather than the thing itself. This emphasises that the sign is merely a symbol for the class of object referred to. Hence, the lexical word or noun \\"box\\" evokes a range of possibility from cheap card to gold-encrusted container. The reader or audience may not be able to see the particular box referred to but will be aware of its likely form from the other signs accompanying the use of the particular word. However, there is no necessary connection between the signifier and the signified. There is nothing inherently boxy about the component sounds or letters that comprise the noun \\"box\\"‚Äîthe scope of onomatopoeia is limited when forming a language. All that is necessary is that the relevant group of people should decide to use that word to denote the object. Evidence that this is the correct view comes from the fact that each language can encode signifiers with whichever signified they wish to communicate. Hence, for example, the letters comprising \\"air\\" signify what humans breathe in English, and what fish breathe in Malay, i.e. water. This makes a system of signs a very flexible mechanism for communicating meaning, but one which is conditioned by history and culture, i.e. once a sign acquires a commonly accepted meaning in each language, it cannot arbitrarily be changed by any one person, but it is able to change diachronically. Further, Roman Jakobson (1896‚Äì1982) proposes that when a group of signs is used, there is an emotive function that reflects the speaker's attitude to the topic of his or her discourse. Language and the other coding systems are the means whereby one self-aware individual communicates with another. By selecting particular signs and placing them in a context, the addresser is making a cognitive use of the sign system to refer to his or her own social, moral, ethical, political or other values. = Barthes = Because signs may have multiple meanings, a sign can only be interpreted in its context. Saussure believed that any one sign takes its value from its position and relations with other signs within the linguistic system. Modern semiotics draws its inspiration from the work of, inter alios, Roland Barthes (1915‚Äì1980), who argued that semiotics should expand its scope and concern: \\"...any system of signs, whatever their substance and limits; images, gestures, musical sounds, objects, and the complex associations of all of these, which form the content of ritual, convention or public entertainment: these constitute, if not languages, at least systems of signification\\" (1967, 9). In the system to be interrogated, the relations will be both weak and strong, positive and negative, qualitative and quantitative, etc. In this, a sign cannot be attributed a value outside its context (although what is signified may have connotative meaning(s) that resonate outside the context), and what is not present can be just as significant as what is present. In a slightly different context of critique through the archaeological and genealogical methods for the study of knowledge, Michel Foucault (1926‚Äì1984) used the idea of discontinuity as a means to revalorise elements of knowledge. In this, he considered the silences and lacunae within a text to be as significant as express statements. In both systems, the specific processes of analysis examine these gaps to reveal whose interests are served by the omissions. Such analysis is particularly useful to identify which questions are left unasked. Methods The commutation test can be used to identify which signifiers are significant. The test depends on substitution: a particular signifier is chosen, then the effect of substituting alternatives is considered to determine the extent to which the value of the sign is changed. This both illuminates the meaning of the original choice and identifies the paradigms and code to which the signifiers used belong. Paradigmatic analysis compiles a list of the signifiers present in the text. This set comprises the paradigm. The analyst then compares and contrasts the set with absent signifiers, i.e. with other signifiers that might have been chosen. This reveals the significance of the choices made which might have been required because of technical production constraints or the limitations of the individual's own technique, or because of the tropes, generic conventions, style and rhetorical purpose of the work. The analysis of paradigmatic relations helps to define the ‚Äòvalue‚Äô of specific items in a system. References *Barthes, Roland ([1964] 1967). Elements of Semiology.

The practical result is that inserting a Barlow lens magnifies the image. A real barlow lens is not a single glass element, because that would generate chromatic aberration, and spherical aberration if the lens is not aspheric. More common configurations use three or more elements for achromatic correction or apochromatic correction and higher image quality. Telescope use A Boeing 747-400 aircraft at 11,000 metres, photographed from the ground using a 1,200 mm telescope and a 2x Barlow lens. In its astronomical use, a Barlow lens may be placed immediately before an eyepiece to effectively decrease the eyepiece's focal length by the amount of the Barlow's divergence. Since the magnification provided by a telescope and eyepiece is equal to the telescope's focal length divided by the eyepiece's focal length, this has the effect of increasing the magnification of the image. Astronomical Barlow lenses are rated for the amount of magnification they induce. Most commonly, Barlow lenses are 2x or 3x, but adjustable Barlows are also available. The power of an adjustable Barlow lens is changed by adding an extension tube between the Barlow and the eyepiece to increase the magnification. The amount of magnification is one more than the distance between the Barlow lens and the eyepiece lens, when the distance is measured in units of the focal length of the Barlow lens. A standard Barlow lens is housed in a tube that is one Barlow focal-length long, so that a focusing lens inserted into the end of the tube will be separated from the Barlow lens at the other end by one Barlow focal-length, and hence produce a 2x magnification over and above what the eyepiece would have produced alone. If the length of a standard 2x Barlow lens' tube is doubled, then the lenses are separated by 2 Barlow focal lengths and it becomes a 3x Barlow. Similarly, if the tube length is tripled, then the lenses are separated by 3 Barlow focal lengths and it becomes a 4x Barlow, and so on. A common misconception is that higher magnification equates to a higher-quality image. However, in practice, the quality of the image generally depends on the quality of the optics (lenses) and viewing conditions, not on magnification.  Photography use  Teleconverters are variations on Barlow lenses that have been adapted for photographic use.Sidney F. Ray, Scientific photography and applied imaging, page 492 A teleconverter increases the effective focal length of the photographic lens it is attached to, making it a telephoto lens. A true telephoto lens uses a configuration similar to a Barlow lens to obtain a shorter tube length for a given focal length. Microscope use In microscopy the Barlow lens is used to increase working distance and decrease magnification. The lenses are \\"objective lenses\\" that are mounted in front of the microscope's last objective element. Barlow lenses for microscopes can be found with magnifications ranging from 0.3√ó to 2√ó. Some standard lenses are 2√ó, which decreases the working distance by half and doubles the magnification, 0.75√ó (3/4√ó), which increases the working distance by 4/3√ó (1.33√ó) and decreases the magnification by 0.75√ó, and a 0.5√ó Barlow doubles the working distance and halves the magnification.

They are home to Europe's largest electricity-generating water wheel. The falls The River Dulais rises on Mynydd y Drum in the western Brecon Beacons. It flows down the Dulais Valley, through the villages of Seven Sisters and Crynant, before reaching its confluence with the River Neath after about . Here it flows over a ridge of Pennant sandstone, entering a gorge that was carved by meltwater from a glacier 20,000 years ago. Originally the falls were nearer the sea, but the water has eroded the rock and cut its way back to its present location. The River Dulais is prone to flash floods when heavy rain falls in its catchment area. History The waterwheel at Aberdulais Power has been drawn from the waterfall since 1584, when it first provided energy used in the manufacture of copper, using ore imported from Cornwall. The copper-works ceased to operate early in the 17th century, and the site was later used for corn-milling and later as a tinplate works. The weir and waterwheel were added during the 19th century. The waterwheel used today is a modern steel structure. It is the largest waterwheel generating electricity in Europe, with a diameter of . It has 72 buckets to catch the falling water and rotates at a rate of five revolutions per minute.

At that time he was already wearing his trademark yellow hat that eventually led to his nickname \\"Yellow Hat\\".Interview of Gabriel Nassif, 27 October 2007 by the Secte des Magiciens Fous Only one week later Nassif made Top 4 at Pro Tour: New York 2001 with teammates Nicolas Olivieri and Amiel Tenenbaum, in what was only his second Pro Tour. He again lost in the finals to Kai Budde's team Phoenix Foundation. After a relatively quiet year and a half, Nassif returned to success with an impressive string of high finishes, including fifth place at Pro Tour: Venice 2003, second place at the 2003 Yokohama Masters, ninth place at the 2003 World Championships, second place at Pro Tour: New Orleans 2003, second place at Pro Tour: Kobe 2004, seventh place at the 2004 World Championships, and Pro Tour: Atlanta 2005 champion with teammates Gabriel Tsang and David Rood as Team Nova. With three Pro Tour Top Eights in the 2003‚Äì04 season including two runner-up finishes, Nassif earned the 2004 Player of the Year award. He has been dubbed by many as the best Constructed player in Magic. Indeed, he has often met success with home-made designs. Tooth and Nail, a deck directly derived from Nassif's TwelvePost deck he piloted to the finals at the 2004 Pro Tour Kobe, was one of the best performing deck in Standard until Mirrodin rotated out of the format in 2005.

Nassif lost in the semifinals to Makahito Mihara and his Dragonstorm combo deck. Ironically, Nassif made Top 8 of the 2007 World Championships with a mono-red Dragonstorm deck designed by him and American teammate Patrick Chapin, where he again made a semifinal exit while playing against Patrick Chapin in the mono-red Dragonstorm mirror. 2008 was a weaker season for Nassif. His only significant finish was a second place at Grand Prix Brussels. It was also the first season since 2000‚Äì01 that Nassif did not reach the Top 8 of a Pro Tour.

It features five red silicone pads that are designed to improve the strike zone, as well as TPU fins that are designed to enhance touch and control.Nike T90 Laser III Review Soccer Cleats 101  Soccer In September 2011, Nike revealed the latest incarnation of their signature power/accuracy boots; the Nike T90 Laser IV. This latest incarnation did away with the silicon pods and TPU rubber fins of the Laser III, and introduced 'strips' of hard rubber to the forefoot which shift and bend with the movements of the foot - with Nike coining the name 'Adaptive Shield' for this new technology. The Laser IV also features TPU swerve fins to generate friction and ball spin, and a Power Zone that improves strength and accuracy when striking the ball. With the launch of the Nike T90 Laser IV, Nike were also keen to re-invent the silo for the modern striker. As such, the boot's weight was decreased by 20% to around (in a US size 9 boot), and the Laser IV's silhouette and shape were slimmed down from the wide-fitting Laser III. Launched in two colourways, White/Black/Total Orange and Black/Silver/Yellow, the Nike T90 Laser IV hit the pitch early when Wesley Sneijder wore them in Inter Milan's clash with Palermo at the start of the 2011-12 Serie A season.

The rose as a symbol of secrecy has an ancient history.  History  Horus as a nude boy with his finger to his mouth, and a sidelock of hair, the symbols of childhood. Here he also has a uraeus above his forehead, symbolizing his entitlement to kingship. The rose has held a deeply symbolic significance in many times and cultures as a symbol of maternal creativity and of the yoni or feminine generative power. The literal rose and its essence or attar has also played a role in religious and spiritual rites which ofttimes would have been held in secret. The rose has sometimes been said to have been the emblem of the god Horus in ancient Egypt. However, the gods in Egypt were usually associated with the lotus. The idea of Horus being linked to the rose probably arises from Greek and Roman cultural cross-transmission of myths from Egypt. Firstly, the rose's connotation of secrecy dates back also to Greek mythology. Aphrodite gave a rose to her son Eros, the god of love; he, in turn, gave it to Harpocrates, the god of silence and a Greek name for a form of Horus, to ensure that his mother's indiscretions (or those of the gods in general, in other accounts) were not disclosed. Secondly, in Egypt, the rose was actually sacred to Isis but this appears to have been during the Roman period of Egyptian history‚Äî\\"Probably due to assimilation with the goddess Aphrodite (Venus), during the Roman period, the rose was used in her worship.\\" Later, the Greeks and Romans translated the god's Egyptian name Heru-pa-khered as Harpocrates and regarded him as the god of silence. The association of Harpocrates with silence and secrecy originates from a misunderstanding of Egyptian depictions of the god. Heru-pa-khered was represented as a naked youth with a finger-to-mouth gesture‚Äîin Egyptian artwork this gesture imitates the hieroglyph for child and is used to represent youth, but was misunderstood by Greeks and Romans as a gesture for silence. Paintings of roses on the ceilings of Roman banquet rooms were also a reminder that things said under the influence of wine (sub vino) should also remain sub rosa. In the Middle Ages a rose suspended from the ceiling of a council chamber similarly pledged all present (those under the rose) to secrecy. In Christian symbolism, the phrase \\"sub rosa\\" has a special place in confessions. Pictures of five- petalled roses were often carved on confessionals, indicating that the conversations would remain secret. The phrase has also been understood to refer to the mysterious virginal conception of Christ. The rose is also an esoteric symbol of Rosicrucianism which was often considered to be a secret society or brotherhood. The Tudor rose In the 16th century, the symbol of Henry VII of England was the stylised Tudor dynasty rose. A large image of the rose covered the ceiling of the private chamber where decisions of state were made in secret. In current times, the term is used by the Scottish Government for a specific series of \\"off the record\\" meetings.

She began her soap career in 1966 by creating the role of Lenore Moore on Another World, a role she played until 1971. In 1970, she made a cameo appearance as Lenore on the AW spin-off, Somerset. Lenore was in a popular romance with attorney Walter Curtin (Val Dufour) who defended Lenore for the murder of Wayne Addison (Robert Milli) but who secretly was guilty of killing Wayne himself. Her storyline had Lenore being a bitter enemy with Liz Matthews (then Nancy Wickwire) who was in love with Wayne but blamed Lenore for stealing his affections. After leaving Another World, she took over the role of Ann Tyler on All My Children. As the daughter of the wealthy Phoebe and Charles Tyler, she married handsome lawyer Paul Martin. After Ann gave birth to a baby who died suddenly, she underwent a mental breakdown, forcing Paul and Phoebe to commit her to a mental hospital. She played the role for six years, leaving All My Children in 1977. The following year, she appeared on The Edge of Night, playing Louise Cavanaugh (Miles and April's mother in dream sequences) for a few episodes. That same year, she stepped in for Marie Masters in the role of Dr. Susan Burke Stewart on As the World Turns while Masters was on emergency leave. It was at this time that Barcroft took a three-year hiatus from acting, returning to daytime in 1981 on Ryan's Hope in the role of Barbara Wilde, a soap actress desperate for publicity. Barbara briefly dated Dr. Seneca Beaulac but sued him for malpractice after blaming him for going forward with a medical procedure that threatened to destroy her career. In 1983, she returned to As the World Turns for a brief stint as D.A. Sara Comstock, which she repeated the following year. She then returned to The Edge of Night in a completely different role, playing Laurie Karr's psychiatrist, Dr. Eleanor Prentice, until the show was canceled in the winter of 1984. In 1987, the producers of One Life to Live asked her to temporarily fill in for Erika Slezak as Victoria Lord Buchanan. Her final appearance on soap operas was in 1988, playing a pharmacist for one day on Another World. Judith has been married to soap opera writer Wisner Washam since June 15, 1969. They have a son, Ian Washam, and a daughter, Amy Masterson. Her Broadway credits are: Mating Dance, Dinner At Eight, Plaza Suite, All God's Chillun Got Wings, Elephant Man, Betrayal, and Shimada.

The daughter of Philip II of Macedon and Olympias of Epirus, she was the only full sibling of Alexander the Great. Her other siblings include half sisters Thessalonike and Cynane, and half-brother Philip III of Macedon. Cleopatra grew up in the care of her mother in Pella. In 338 BC, Cleopatra stayed in Pella with her father while her mother Olympias fled to exile in Epirus with her Molossian brother Alexander I of Epirus (Cleopatra's uncle), and Cleopatra's brother Alexander fled to Illyria. Soon Philip felt he had to ally himself to Alexander I by offering his daughter's hand in marriage. A large wedding between Cleopatra and her uncle Alexander I of Epirus was held in 336 BC. It was at the celebration of her nuptials, which took place on a magnificent scale at Aegae in Macedon, that Philip II was murdered. Immediately after her father's murder, Cleopatra and Alexander went from Macedon back to Epirus. Soon after, the couple had two children, Neoptolemus II of Epirus and Cadmeia. It is believed that Alexander and Cleopatra kept in close contact while he was on his conquest to the east. In 332 BC Alexander had sent booty home for both his mother and sister, as well as his close friends. In 334 BC, Cleopatra's husband crossed the Adriatic Sea to the Italian peninsula to campaign against several Italic tribes, the Lucanians and Bruttii, on behalf of the Greek colony Taras, leaving her as regent of Epirus. She was involved as recipient and sender of official shipments of grain during a widespread shortage around 334 BC. According to an inscription from Cyrene, Libya, she was the recipient of 50,000 'medimni' of grain, and shipped the surplus to Corinth. Alexander I conquered Heraclea, took Sipontum, and captured both Consentia and Terin, but was eventually killed in battle in 331 BC, leaving the young heir, Neoptolemus too young for the throne. Cleopatra ruled Epirus in the meantime. It was an Epirote custom that the woman of a family became head of household when her husband died and their son(s) were too young, unlike the rest of Greece. It was only fitting for the powerful queen to assume control. When her husband was killed, an embassy from Athens was dispatched to deliver condolences. Cleopatra was seemingly acting as the religious head of state for the people of Molossia. Her name appears on a list of TheorodokoiCleopatras by J. E. G. Whitehorne (\\"welcomers of sacred ambassadors\\"), in the recently established Epirote alliance. Cleopatra was significantly the only female on the list. Her position as official welcomer would have allowed her to keep a finger on whatever was happening anywhere in Greece. After the death of her brother, Cleopatra was sought in marriage by several of his generals, who thought to strengthen their influence with the Macedonians by a connection with the sister of Alexander the Great. Leonnatus is first mentioned as putting forward a claim to her hand, and he represented to Eumenes that he received a lettered promise of marriage if he came to Pella. Cleopatra had extended her hand because she knew Leonnatus had the ambition and ability to overthrow the new mentally unfit king Philip III of Macedon if they married. Nonetheless before his arrival, Leonnatus in an attempt enhance his claim to the throne, lifted the siege from the rebellious Greeks in Lamia and rescued Antipater, however he was killed in action, so the marriage never occurred. Perdiccas next attempted to win her marriage. After his death, her hand was sought by Cassander, Lysimachus, and Antigonus. She refused, however, all these offers. She escaped to Sardis, where she was kept for years in a sort of honourable captivity by Antigonus. An interesting event took place in Sardis. A frustrated Antipater publicly accused Cleopatra of being involved with Perdiccas in her half sister Cynane's death. Cleopatra would not submit so easily, however, and fought back. Eventually, Cleopatra acceded to a proposal from Ptolemy, but before it occurred, she was captured. After being brought back to Sardis, Cleopatra was assassinated in 308 BC, reputedly by order of Antigonus.

Its primary military roles include maritime patrol, surveillance, and air transport. Its largest user is Turkey, which has 59 aircraft. Design and development The project was a joint venture between Construcciones Aeron√°uticas SA (CASA) and Indonesian Aerospace (PT. Dirgantara Indonesia), formerly known as IPTN, which formed Airtech International to manage the programme. The partnership applied only to the Series 10 and Series 100/110, with later versions being developed independently. Over 230 of all versions of CN-235 are in service and have accumulated more than 500,000 flight hours. Design began in January 1980 with the first flight on 11 November 1983. Spanish and Indonesian certification was on 20 June 1986; the first flight of the production aircraft was on 19 August 1986 and CASA's FAA type approval was granted on 3 December 1986. The aircraft entered service on 1 March 1988 In 1994 the Irish Air Corps took delivery of two CN-235 maritime surveillance aircraft having used one on loan from CASA from 1992 while their own aircraft were being built. In 1995, CASA launched development of a stretched CN-235 as the C-295. In December 2002, the Colombian Navy ordered two CN-235 for patrol and anti-drug trafficking missions. In April 2005, Venezuela ordered two CN-235 maritime surveillance aircraft plus 10 transport planes but the operation was halted because the United States government refused to allow the transfer of what they deemed to be US technology in the avionics. In January 2006, Thailand placed an order with Indonesian Aerospace for ten aircraft, six for the Ministry of Defence and four for the Ministry of Agriculture. In December 2007, Spain ordered two CN-235 maritime patrol aircraft for the Guardia Civil, for delivery 2008‚Äì2009. One CN-235 MPA aircraft was delivered by Indonesian Aerospace to the Indonesian defence ministry in June 2008. Royal Malaysian Air Force In August 2006, three CASA CN-235-10 aircraft remained in airline service, in Africa, with Safair (two) and Tiko Air (one).Flight International, 3‚Äì9 October 2006 Asian Spirit operated a lone CN-235-220 in the Philippines, correct as of June/July 2007. In early July 2008, the Mexican Navy announced that it would purchase six CASA CN-235s from Spain. In April 2010, Herv√© Morin, French Minister of Defence, announced the order of eight CN-235-300s from Spain. In 2011, Indonesian Aerospace was still working on 4 CN-235-110 MPAs for South Korea Coast Guard with amount of $96 million. The Senegalese Air Force acquired two CN-235s in 2010 and August 2012 under a $13 million contract. They plan to buy two more aircraft for VIP and cargo duties. The Air Force is also interested in the maritime patrol version of the aircraft. Senegal: MoD plans to acquire two additional CN235s, including MPA versions ‚Äì Dmilt.com, 30 August 2013 =Commercial airliner= Merpati Nusantara's CN-235 in Indonesia Although the CN-235 was initially designed as a military transport, it was also offered as a commercial airliner. However, it did not achieve much success in this role compared to competing 50-seat commuter aircraft such as the ATR 42 and De Havilland Canada DHC-8. Iberia LAE, Spain's flag carrier, bought four CN-235s from CASA for regional routes, and in 1992 Aerol√≠neas Argentinas (then also a subsidiary of Iberia) ordered two aircraft to be operated by its subsidiary, Austral. In 2015, Indonesian Aerospace announced that they are currently planning a new variant of CN-235 called N-245 that will be designed specially for civil operation and able to carry up to 60 passengers. Previously also known as CN-235NG, this variant planned to be fully launched after Indonesian Aerospace N-219 project is done and expected to be fully certified in 2019. Further planned development is N-270, a stretched version of N-245 that able to carry up to 70‚Äì90 passengers and planned to be developed between 2019‚Äì2024.

History Under the name Schwarzerz it was mentioned by Georgius Agricola in 1546, and it has been variously known as \\"black silver ore\\" (German Schwarzgultigerz), brittle silver-ore (Spr√∂dglanzerz), etc. The name stephanite was proposed by W Haidinger in 1845 in honour of the Archduke of Austria Stephan Franz Victor of Habsburg-Lorena (1817-1867). French authors use F. S. Beudant's name psaturose (from the Greek œàŒ±Œ∏œÖœÅœåœÇ, fragile). Properties It frequently occurs as well-formed crystals, which are orthorhombic and occasionally show indications of hemimorphism: they have the form of six-sided prisms or flat tables terminated by large basal planes and often modified at the edges by numerous pyramid-planes. Twinning on the prism- planes is of frequent occurrence, giving rise to pseudo-hexagonal groups like those of aragonite. The colour is iron-black, and the lustre metallic and brilliant; on exposure to light, however, the crystals soon become dull. Stephanite is an important ore of silver in some mining camps. Occurrence Stephanite occurs as a late-stage mineral with other ores of silver in hydrothermal veins. Associated minerals include proustite, acanthite, native silver, tetrahedrite, galena, sphalerite and pyrite. Localities which have yielded good crystallized specimens are Freiberg and Gersdorf near Rosswein in Saxony, Cha√±arcillo in Chile, and exceptionally Cornwall. In the Comstock lode in Nevada massive stephanite and argentite are important ores of silver.

SBUs typically have a discrete marketing plan, analysis of competition, and marketing campaign, even though they may be part of a larger business entity. An SBU may be a business unit within a larger corporation, or it may be a business into itself or a branch. Corporations may be composed of multiple SBUs, each of which is responsible for its own profitability. General Electric is an example of a company with this sort of business organization. SBUs are able to affect most factors which influence their performance. Managed as separate businesses, they are responsible to a parent corporation. General Electric has 49 SBUs. Companies today often use the word segmentation or division when referring to SBUs or an aggregation of SBUs that share such commonalities. Commonalities A SBU is generally defined by what it has in common, as well as the traditional aspects defined by McKinsey: separate competitors; and a profitability bottom line. Four commonalities include: *Revenue SBU *Like Marketing Cost SBU *Like Operations/HR Profit SBU *Like sales judged on net sales not gross Success factors There are three factors that are generally seen as determining the success of an SBU: #the degree of autonomy given to each SBU manager. #the degree to which an SBU shares functional programs and facilities with other SBUs. #the way in which the corporation handles new changes in the market. BCG matrix The BCG matrix (aka B.C.G. analysis, BCG-matrix, Boston Box, Boston Matrix, Boston Consulting Group analysis, portfolio diagram), a chart designed by Bruce Henderson for the Boston Consulting Group in 1968, may help corporations to analyze their business units or product lines. This helps the company allocate resources; brand marketing, product management, strategic management, and portfolio analysis can use it as an analytical tool. When using the Boston Consulting Group Matrix, SBUs can appear within any of the four quadrants (Star, Question Mark, Cash Cow, Dog) as a circle whose area represents their size. With different colors, competitors may also be shown. The precise location is determined by the two axes, market Growth as the Y axis, Market Share as the X axis. Alternatively, changes over or two years can be shown by shading or other differences in design.xx. For an example, see Robert Cushman, \\"Norton's Top Down, Bottom-Up Planning Process\\", Planning Review 7 (6), November 1979 Star products currently have high growth and high market-share. The Question Mark identifies products with low share but high growth. A Cash Cow has high share but low growth. Finally, Dog labels product which has low growth and low share.

In the following year the royal mineralogical cabinet was committed to his charge to be conveyed into England, and from that time his attention was directed principally towards geology and cognate sciences. In 1817 he published a paper on the phenomena of crystallization, treating especially of the variety of forms assumed by the same mineral substance. In 1818 he undertook, at the expense of the French government, a geological journey through Hungary, and the results of his researches, Voyage min√©ralogique et g√©ologique en Hongrie, 3 vols 4to, with atlas, published in 1822, established for him a European reputation. In 1820, he was appointed to the professorship of mineralogy in the Paris faculty of sciences, and afterwards became inspector-general of the university. He subsequently published treatises on physics and on mineralogy and geology. Perhaps his most notable publication is the second edition of Traite Elementaire de Mineralogie (Paris, 1830‚Äì1832), the second volume of which deals with descriptive mineralogy and in which Beudant coined the names of many minerals, such as anglesite, bismuthite and cerussite.

Each story is a self-contained adventure, but throughout the series, Earl Dumarest, the protagonist, searches for clues to the location of his home world, Earth. Production of a television version of the series is set to begin in 2018. The stories are set in a far future galactic culture that is fragmented and without any central government. Dumarest was born on Earth, but had stowed away on a spaceship when he was a young boy and was caught. Although a stowaway discovered on a spaceship was typically ejected to space, the captain took pity on the boy and allowed him to work and travel on the ship. When the story opens in The Winds of Gath, Dumarest has traveled so long and so far that he does not know how to return to his home planet and no-one has ever heard of it, other than as a myth or legend. It becomes clear that someone or something has deliberately concealed Earth's location. The Cyclan, an organization of humans surgically altered to be emotionless (known as Cybers), and on occasion able to link with the brains of previously living Cybers (the better to think logically), seem determined to stop him from finding Earth. Additionally, the Cyclan seeks a scientific discovery that Dumarest possesses, stolen from them and passed to him by a dying thief, which would vastly increase their already considerable power. Also appearing in many of the books is the humanitarian Church of Universal Brotherhood. Its monks are spread throughout many worlds as are the Cyclan, the two being arch- enemies - which does not make the Church Dumarest's ally, but in some instances they support each other. Characters Earl Dumarest, the protagonist of the series, is a galactic adventurer, sometime bodyguard, mercenary, gladiator, prospector, hunter, gambler and starship jack of all trades. Dumarest, as he is most often referred to in the books, is on a quest to return to the lost planet of his birth amongst the diverse and disparate worlds of the milky way galaxy. His home planet is Earth. In all of the books the notion of there being a planet called Earth is laughable to most of the people he meets, and for those who have heard the name, it is only as a myth from the deep past often referred to alongside gamblers' paradises such as Jackpot, Bonanza and the mythical El Dorado. Factions =Cyclan= The Cyclan are a widespread organization dedicated to bringing order to the galaxy by means of pure logic. Their primary agents, Cybers, are trained from childhood in countless mental disciplines involving mathematics and reasoning, and are modified at puberty to be unable to experience any emotion. Each Cyber also possesses a biotech implant called ‚ÄúHomochon Elements‚Äù. These implants enable each Cyber to enter a trance-like state which enables instantaneous communication with the Cyclan central intelligence, even over interstellar distances. This central intelligence is a gestalt organism consisting of the disembodied minds of former Cybers whose mental prowess has been demonstrated to be of value but whose bodies have grown too old to continue functioning. The ultimate reward to which all Cybers aspire is to be incorporated into the central intelligence. For these reasons, Cybers have an uncanny ability to extrapolate future events from existing data, and are highly prized (and highly paid) as advisors to rulers across the galaxy. The Cyclan publicly insist that they do not command or interfere, they merely advise, and this also increases their credibility among those who seek their service. However, the Cyclan pursue their own agenda, and while they provide valuable service to maintain their reputation, those whom they advise are manipulated even as they are aided. While incapable of malice, the Cyclan are thoroughly ruthless and willing to sacrifice individuals or worlds to their logically derived vision of the greater good. It is irrelevant to them whether or not the mass of humanity still handicapped by emotion shares this vision. It is implied throughout the series that the Cyclan has something to do with the knowledge of Earth having been lost or destroyed in the distant past, and that they strive to keep that knowledge secret. This hidden agenda puts them at odds with Dumarest from the outset of the series. =Hausia= The Hausia is a network of information brokers who operate on most worlds that engage in interstellar commerce. With a galactic reputation as fair but shrewd negotiators, and consistently driven by the profit motive, Hausi are neither noble nor malicious. Dumarest frequently deals with them because as long as a mutually beneficial business arrangement can be reached, their lack of a hidden agenda makes them predictable and generally trustworthy. =Church of Universal Brotherhood= The Church of Universal Brotherhood is a decentralized humanitarian organization whose ‚Äúmonks‚Äù roam the galaxy giving comfort and alleviating suffering wherever they can. While they do not believe suffering holds intrinsic merit - they refuse to enjoy luxury or privilege of station above what is available to the most lowly of those to whom they minister. Although this appearance is not intended to deceive, it occasionally blinds those who disparage or underestimate them to the fact that each monk is a highly educated, highly trained agent of the central Church. =Free Traders= The Free Traders are small, independently owned and operated merchant starships and their crews. Free traders often invest speculatively in their cargoes in the hope of finding a lucrative market, or carry commissioned cargo and paying passengers when available. =Terridae= The Terridae is a secretive and paranoid sect that shares Dumarest‚Äôs mission: to find Earth. They have been awaiting ‚ÄúThe Event‚Äù (the discovery of Earth) for thousands of years. As they age, they spend more and more of their lives in self-contained stasis chambers (caskets) - the oldest only awakening for short periods every few decades, to prolong their lifespan until The Event occurs. =Original People= The Original People is a mysterious and highly fragmented sect that believes all humanity originated on one world - Earth (also known as Terra). Each faction is highly secretive and does not proselytize, because membership is based on the belief that they are the descendants of the original wave of settlers that spread out into the galaxy from Earth. Books The series consists of: # The Winds of Gath (1967). Gath is a world with a unique tourist attraction: a mountain-sized white noise amplifier. With no indigenous economy other than the tourist slave labor trade, Dumarest struggles to break free from this dead-end world. Dumarest becomes attached to the retinue of the Matriarch of Kund and unwittingly finds himself embroiled in the vicious and complex political intrigues of the Matriarch's court. After some keen detective work from Dumarest and the ensuing deadly battle with the Cyclan, Dumarest prevails and escapes from the backwater planet. # Derai (1968) Dumarest is recruited to escort a waif of a woman lost on an unfamiliar world back to her home and family. Upon delivery he is recruited to assist the family further by participating in a trial to benefit their patriarch.

It is native to the western Mediterranean region. Common names include gum rockrose, labdanum, common gum cistus, and brown-eyed rockrose. Description It is a shrub growing tall and wide. The leaves are evergreen, lanceolate, 3‚Äì10 cm long and 1‚Äì2 cm broad, dark green above and paler underneath. The flowers are 5‚Äì8 cm diameter, with 5 papery white petals, usually with a red to maroon spot at the base, surrounding the yellow stamens and pistils. The whole plant is covered with the sticky exudate of fragrant resin, the source of labdanum, used in herbal medicine and perfumery. Ecology C. ladanifer is particularly well suited to the Continentalized Mediterranean climate, standing both long summer droughts and cold weather. It is an extremely aggressive plant which has taken over much of former farmland and grasslands in the mountain regions of central Spain and much of southern Portugal. In Spanish it is known as Jara pringosa meaning \\"sticky shrub\\". In Portuguese it is known as \\"esteva\\". It has been found to have mycorrhizal associations with Boletus edulis, Boletus rhodoxanthus, and Laccaria laccata. Systematics The wide distribution and morphological variation of C. ladanifer across northern Africa, the Iberian peninsula, and southern France has resulted in the recognition of three sub-species: subspp. ladanifer, sulcatus, and africanus. =Subspecies= *C. ladanifer subsp. ladanifer *C. ladanifer subsp. mauritianus Pau & Sennen *C. ladanifer subsp. sulcatus Demoly, syn.

These directions are designed to be strung together in combination naturally during combat. Difficult-to- perform combinations cause additional damage and faster strikes. The developer Funcom stated that their \\"Real Combat\\" system, a combat system designed to offer more real-time options than traditional Dungeons & Dragons-inspired \\"turn-based\\" combat systems that are more commonly used, will be a prime attraction of Age of Conan: Unchained. This \\"Real Combat\\" system is a first- person melee approach in which every enemy has three different areas that players can target. Combinations can be performed by stringing together consecutive attacks in particular directions. Feedback from players has pointed out that this system requires a certain degree of dexterity. Character statistics and item bonuses also play a role in this system, however item bonuses have less effect on a character's power than in comparable games, so that whilst equipment does play a certain role other factors also have an impact, such as the player's skill or their analysis of the scenario. The idea of \\"Real Combat\\" is to eliminate the dullness of typical MMO fighting, which often consists of an auto-attack feature.News ‚Äì 'Dissatisfied' With Age Of Conan, Funcom Co-Founder Quits.

In some situations however, players will choose to band together and unite their skills to face other bands of players or non-player armies. Players can then work together and build on each other's strengths, for example a character standing in line with a 'Conqueror' when he is running will have a greater resistance to knockback effects.Gaute's State of the Game ‚Äì February.

Adventurers can cooperate with one another to build cities with walls, towers and catapults that can protect player-owned taverns and merchant facilities. In July 2011, a Hardcore PvP server was launched for the EU and US servers. This hardcore PvP server removes the guards from the various cities and playfields and re-opened PvP on the instances around the city of Tortage. This hardcore server brings back the basics of MMO PvP combat in that players will have a chance at dropping loot from their inventory when they are killed in player vs player combat. Players are also only able to have one character on these servers. This was a fresh-start server which doesn't allow any character transfer to it, does not allow the use of offline levels, or free level 50 characters. =Characters= A screenshot of the character creation and extensive customization featured in Age of Conan. Characters in Age of Conan are registered to a unique user account on a specific online server, with characters created on one server unable to be played on another. Players are able to create characters which function as their virtual avatars in the online world of Hyboria. During character creation, the player may choose from four playable races. The character is one of four archetypes (in bold) and one of three class selections for each archetype. The Rise of the Godslayer expansion brought on a new race, the Khitan. Earlier only some classes were free to play but on December 13, 2012 all classes were made available in the free model. Setting An Aquilonian character in Age of Conan gazing at the snowy mountains of northern Cimmeria Age of Conan is set in a low fantasy pseudo-historical ancient world called the Hyborian Age, created by Robert E. Howard. The warlord Conan has seized the throne of Aquilonia, but ancient evils seek to overthrow him. The lead artist Terje Lundberg said that the look and feel of Hyboria was based on the interpretation of the stories written by Howard: :\\"When you read Howard's work you're immediately drawn into a gritty world of dark and ancient forces, and mighty and decadent civilizations. You feel the great weight of the ages and sense the very history in the crumbling mortar and the ruins. Therefore we've been mindful from the outset to create a world which is true to Howard's writing. There is majesty in Hyboria but it's of a monolithic, brutal and primitive kind ‚Äì it certainly isn't \\"high fairie\\" where everything appears as though it was built only yesterday and is devoid of context.\\" Lundberg said the game at launch will contain three countries, Cimmeria, a northern country with snow and highlands, Aquilonia, which contains \\"green hills, lush riverbeds, and the marvelous city of Tarantia\\", and Stygia, which consists mostly of deserts and \\"some beautiful cities\\" ‚Äî as well as the island of Tortage which \\"has a diverse geography ranging from jungle to harbors\\".

Six days later one million copies had been shipped in total. Since release, Funcom has made improvements to performance and changes and additions to the game which were not ready in time for launch, as well as in response to feedback from players. Additions have included new adventuring zones, and revamps of existing dungeons. On May 19, 2008, GameZone.com presented a series of original fictional stories by Michael Lafferty, stemming from the massively multiplayer online world of Age of Conan ‚Äì Hyborian Adventures. The stories were written with the permission and cooperation of Funcom. The tales explore the world, the characters and the lore involved in Hyboria. In September 2008, Gaute Godager, the producer and game director resigned from his role in Age of Conan and from Funcom, a company he had been involved in for over 16 years. In his press release, he revealed that he was not happy with elements in the game's development since release. He was succeeded by Craig Morrison, previously game director of Anarchy Online, and community manager for various Funcom community forums. On June 30, 2011, Funcom began marketing the game with the new title, Age of Conan: Unchained (as opposed to Age of Conan: Hyborian Adventures), and altered the subscription model to a hybrid one. A hybrid model incorporates free-to-play (no monthly fee is charged) and premium plans. Premium players may choose from 1-, 3-, 6-, and 12-month recurring payment, while free-to-play players have limited access to characters, features, and areas. Some of the limitations can be removed with the use of the new \\"Item Shop\\" (available only in the game), where items can be bought with the help of Funcom Points. Funcom Points can be earned either by subscribing or by buying them with real cash. On February 22, 2013, Age of Conan was released on Steam. In his monthly letter for August 2013, Joel Byos revealed a new major PvP event titled The Great Hyborian Race. A new server called the Blood and Glory ruleset server which will be started specifically for this event. The players will have to create a new character on this server in order to participate in this event. The objective is to reach level 80 in all classes by joining a guild or by going it alone. Those first to reach the level will be awarded special prizes. Those who reach a certain threshold of PvP experience within a given timeframe will be given bonus rewards. For the duration of the event, participants will be unable to use offline levels and restrictions will be placed on XP potions. Players have to earn experience through PvE and PvP fights. The developers are aiming to start the event after the server merge which was delayed due to office move by Funcom. = Expansions = Rise of the Godslayer The first expansion titled Age of Conan: Rise of the Godslayer was released on May 11, 2010 and can be bought for Funcom Points from the item shop by all players. It provides new areas for medium-level characters in the form of a home zone for the new playable race, the Khitans; and four additional regions for high-level characters. The new content also includes new companions that can be trained for use as combat pets, or as mounts. A faction system was introduced in order to add variety and re-playability to the new zones. Through new quests, group instances, and raids, players are able to gather tokens to buy new armour sets. An additional incentive is the Alternative Advancement system; a new tree of character feats or perks that are acquired by means of a dedicated point system. It also expanded the raiding in the game to add Tier 4. =Adventure Packs= On August 31, 2011, Funcom released \\"The Savage Coast of Turan\\" adventure pack, which can be bought for Funcom Points from the item shop by all players. The pack includes a new playfield known as \\"Coast of Ardashir\\", two new solo instances, a group instance, a new 24-man raid instance called \\"Temple of Erlik\\" and a new combat pet. The new content was aimed to launch along with the 2011 film Conan the Barbarian, so that players had the chance to see some of the characters, armor, and weapons from the film. On September 3, 2012 Funcom announced that it is planning a new adventure pack called \\"Secrets of Dragon's Spine\\" which will be released in a series of updates. The pack introduces a new zone called Dragon's Spine, a row of small peaks in the southern wastes of Stygia. It will feature new quests, dungeons, challenges, a new mount type, a new raid instance and a new PvP area. The first update was released on live servers on January 10, 2013. On August 13, 2013 a new dungeon which also contains a city of the Serpent Men was added in the Dragon's Spine. A Serpent Man boss called Oldblood along with a new area was added on 6 March 2014. =2011 Norway attacks= The perpetrator of the 2011 Norway attacks, Anders Behring Breivik, used music from the Age of Conan: Hyborian Adventures soundtrack in a video he uploaded to video sharing sites, including YouTube, at the same time that he published his manifesto. Breivik wrote that B√∏ksle's voice is the perfect sound to listen to when one commits acts of martyrdom. During his trial he also testified that he uses this music, particularly the song \\"Ere the World Crumbles\\" when he meditates, as he did in preparation for his terrorist acts on 22 July 2011. B√∏ksle said in a press release in the week following the attacks that she distanced herself from Breivik's use of the music. The music's composer, Knut Avenstroup Haugen, has done the same. Reception The game received \\"generally favorable reviews\\" according to Metacritic. Seth Schiesel, writing for The New York Times, opined that the development of the game would have benefited from a few extra months of production. Knut Avenstroup Haugen won the IFMCA award for Best Original Score for a Video Game or Interactive Media for his score.IFMCA announces its 2008 winners for scoring excellence. Filmmusiccritics.org.

It is widely cultivated as an easily grown bedding plant, with thousands of different cultivars in brilliant shades of yellow and orange. Some authorities regard Tagetes patula as a synonym of Tagetes erecta, the Mexican marigold. Name The Latin specific epithet patula means ‚Äúwith a spreading habit‚Äù. Physical characteristics The flower is an annual, occasionally reaching tall by wide. In some climates it flowers from July to October. In its native habitat of the highlands of central Mexico, blooms are produced from September to killing frost. Achenes ripen and are shed within two weeks of the start of bloom. The heads contain mostly hermaphrodite (having both male and female organs) florets and are pollinated primarily by beetles in the wild, as well as by tachinid flies and other insects. The leaves of all species of marigold include oil glands. The oils are pungent.Soule, J. A. 1993. \\"The Biosystematics of Tagetes\\" Ph.D. Dissertation, University of Texas It can grow in both sandy and clay soils provided they have good drainage. It requires growing in sunlight. Resists cold well to -1¬∞C ; from there it is sensitive to frost and does not develop in the shade. Cultivation This plant is valued for its velvet-textured, brightly coloured blooms in shades of yellow, orange and brown in summer. It is shorter, and has a more spreading habit, than its relative the African marigold (Tagetes erecta). It is therefore more suitable as an edging plant in the open border. The plant is used in companion planting for many vegetable crops. Its root secretions are believed to kill nematodes in the soil and it is said to repel harmful insects, such as white flies on tomatoes.Sustainable Gardening Australia, Companion Planting retrieved on 8 June 2009 =Cultivars= Hundreds of cultivars have been developed, of which the following have gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit:- *'Aurora Light Yellow' *Bonanza Series *'Dainty Marietta' *'Disco Orange' *'Disco Yellow' *'Hero Orange' *'Honeycomb' *'Queen Sophia' *'Safari Mixture' *'Safari Scarlet' *'Safari Tangerine' *'Strawberry Blonde' *'Tiger Eyes' *'Yellow Jacket' Other uses =Medicinal= Medicinally, many cultures use infusions from dried leaves or florets. Research also suggests that T. patula essential oil has the ability to be used as residual pesticide against bedbugs. The essential oil is being investigated for antifungal activity, including treatment of candidiasis and treating fungal infections in plants. =Culinary= The dried and ground flower petals constitute a popular spice in the Republic of Georgia in the Caucasus, where they are known as imeruli shaphrani (= 'Imeretian Saffron') from their pungency and golden colour and particular popularity in the Western province of Imereti. The spice imparts a unique, rather earthy flavour to Georgian cuisine, in which it is considered especially compatible with the flavours of cinnamon and cloves. It is also a well-nigh essential ingredient in the spice mixture khmeli suneli, which is to Georgian cookery what garam masala is to the cookery of North India - with which Georgia shares elements of the Mughlai cuisine.Goldstein D. 1993 \\"The Georgian Feast\\" HarperCollins =Colouring= Tagetes patula florets are grown and harvested annually to add to poultry feed to help give the yolks a golden color. The florets can also be used to color human foods. A golden yellow dye is used to color animal-based textiles (wool, silk) without a mordant, but a mordant is needed for cotton and synthetic textiles. =Fragrance= The whole plant is harvested when in flower and distilled for its essential oil. The oil is used in perfumery. It is blended with sandalwood oil to produce 'attar genda' perfume. About of oil can be extracted from of the plant yielding of flowers and of herbage.

It involves the combative use of a slender stick from long, wielded in both hands, and characterised by fluid motion in attacks and defences. History Though similar stick fighting techniques are present in the Iberian peninsula (e.g. Portuguese and Galician jogo do pau), the origins of juego del palo may be traced back to the Guanches, the indigenous people of the Canary Islands in pre-colonial times during the early 15th century. A Spanish engineer named Leonardo Torriani wrote a history of the Canary Islands in 1590 and included a record of early juego del palo, accompanied by an illustration of two Guanche warriors performing a type of ritual combat with short staves in a small arena. Torriani wrote; > \\"When two Canarians went to duel, they met at a special place established > for this purpose. It was a small enclosure with a level, raised stone > platform at each end. To begin, they each stood upon a platform, armed with > three of the smooth throwing stones they call tahuas, and also with the > stick called magodo or amodeghe. Then they dodged the stones as they were > thrown, skillfully twisting their bodies without moving their feet. Next, > they stepped down and fenced with the staves, each one trying to gain > advantage over the other, as is our custom also.\\" The art has been maintained through to the present day, undergoing a particular renaissance during the 1970s as part of a general effort to maintain native Canarian folk traditions. It bears resemblance to the Portuguese martial art jogo do pau and the Venezuelan form juego del garrote. Juego del palo is now a popular sports activity in the Canaries and has been the subject of considerable academic interest as well, with a number of professional conferences having been held at local universities to investigate the history, culture, and technique of the art. Description This may be described as a form of stick fencing between two players that is characterized by the spontaneous interplay of attacking techniques and defense techniques. No protective equipment is worn in traditional juego del palo; safety is maintained through the skilled control of attacks, which are restrained rather than being made with full force upon the opponent's body. Styles Juego del palo is divided into a number of specific styles or local traditions that have been developed on particular islands within the archipelago, and/or by particular families. The nine primary styles practiced in modern juego del palo include (mostly named after founders of the styles): Deniz, Morales, Verga, Acosta, Quintero, Vidal, Confiero, juego del garrote ('game of the club') and juego de la lata ('game of the tin') . Each style is distinguished from the others by specific fighting techniques and strategies, and also by the rules under which it is played as a competitive game.

Namiki is mostly famous for its handmade maki-e (a Japanese lacquerware craft with a wide range of fine and decorative arts)Maki-e Art Showcase on Japan Creative Centre, 2014 designs on urushi- based lacquers.Namiki pens on Nibs.com websiteNamiki - Mt Fuji and Wave by Glenn Marcus on Pens of Note website \\"Namiki\\" is the surname of Ryosuke Namiki, the founder of the Pilot Corporation, named \\"Namiki Manufacturing Company\\" until 1938 when it became \\"Pilot Pen Co., Ltd.\\". The brand name Namiki came to fame in the early 20th century when Dunhill retailed in the west the Maki-e pens produced by Pilot under the brand \\"Dunhill-Namiki\\". This partnership has continued to the present day (occasionally Namiki makes a Limited Edition for Dunhill) although Namiki has always been owned by Pilot.  History  Most of the fountain pens had been made of ebonite, a material that combines sulfur and rubber. However, ebonite changed color and lost its shine as the years went by. Being aware of this, the Namiki Co. Ltd. (current \\"Pilot Corporation\\") started to try different methods and materials to overcome the problem. After some attempts, they discovered that lacquer coating could tolerate deterioration and make pens more durable. They also tried painting designs on fountain bodies, using the maki-e technique, The process would be later patented by Pilot. In 1925 the Namiki brand was launched to market, with lacquer artists Shisui Rokkaku and Gonroku Matsuda invited to make fountain pens. Ryosuke Namiki and Masao Wada (founders of Pilot Co. in 1918)Namiki on Gala of Vanities, Tokyo, October 2016 traveled to promote their make-e pens in Western countries. In 1926, a Pilot Office was opened in London, England, and four years later a contract was signed with the Alfred Dunhill Ltd. to commercialize Namiki pens in the main European cities and the United States under the brand \\"Dunhill-Namiki Made in Japan\\". The brand would later expand to New York, Shanghai and Singapore.  Models  Namiki fountain pens and non-disposable Pilot fountain pens share the Pilot/Namiki proprietary ink refill cartridge, with inks available in several colors. Converters of both the piston type and squeeze type are also available to allow Namiki and Pilot fountain pens to be filled from ink bottles. The curve-sided Namiki ink bottle has an inner inkwell to keep the nib steady during filling and also to allow almost the last few drops of ink to be taken from the bottle into a pen. As of November 2019, collections commercialized by Namiki include the \\"Emperor\\", the most renowned collection of the Namiki brand.

Life Born in Salford, Lancashire, the eldest of eleven children of a bootmaker, he attended the day school of the Cross Street Unitarian Chapel before a year at the Manchester Grammar School prepared him for apprenticeship to his father at age twelve. He also assisted at the Sunday School at Cross Street where he met William Fairbairn and William Gaskell. In 1868, he married Ellen Ferguson at the chapel and they went on to have three children. By the 1870s, the Manchester Mechanics' Institute was in decline. Despite its original ambitious mission to bring technical expertise to working men, its core activities had shrunk to the provision of elementary education where it faced increasing competition from the state-funded schools established by the Elementary Education Act 1870. In 1879, Reynolds was appointed Secretary to the Institute and immediately set about its rejuvenation. An able and active administrator, and an enthusiastic and persuasive advocate, Reynolds grasped the city's appetite for more effective vocational education and planned and led the relaunch of the institution as the Manchester Technical School in 1882. Reynolds still did not rest. He reorganised the school using the schemes and examinations of the City and Guilds of London Institute and, following legislation in 1889 and 1890, negotiated the school's transfer to Manchester City Council as the Municipal Technical School. Reynolds took a role in the city authority as director of technical instruction and set out to survey the superior establishments in Germany and Switzerland and the thriving schools of the United States and Canada. A grant from the Whitworth Institute enabled him to realise his ambitions for a state-of-the-art institution with the construction of the existing buildings on Sackville Street, opened in 1902 by Arthur Balfour. The institution was renamed as the Municipal School of Technology and Reynolds became its principal and director for higher education of Manchester. In 1904, the newly-autonomous Victoria University of Manchester recognised the status of many of the courses that Reynolds had developed by establishing a faculty of technology at the Institute. Reynolds became dean of the faculty, enjoying an ex officio seat on the university's senate. The Institute's newly appointed professors were recognised by the university. However, consistent with Reynolds' radical sympathies, the bulk of the Institute's work was still devoted to vocational, rather than academic, education. Reynolds lived most of his later life in Cheadle Hulme. He died while on holiday with his family in Anglesey. Honours *Honorary M.Sc. Victoria University, (1902) Bibliography *Cardwell, D. S. L.

This followed the 'expulsions' of Mikhail Bakunin and James Guillaume from the First International at the Hague Congress (1872).Steklov, G.M., History of the First International, part 2, chapter 2. It attracted some affiliates of the First International, repudiated the Hague resolutions, and adopted a Bakuninist programme, and lasted until 1877.  History  The St. Imier International was created when the Swiss Jura Federation, the most important anarchist section of the old International, sent a proposal to the other sections, several of which then assembled at St. Imier to create a new anti-authoritarian organization. The organization was made up of various national federations of workers' societies, mainly the Italian, Spanish, Belgian, American, French and French-speaking Swiss federations, together with other individual organizations which all opposed Karl Marx's control of the General Council and favoured the autonomy of national sections from centralized control. At the St. Imier Congress, held on 15‚Äì16 September 1872, the delegates proclaimed \\"[t]hat the aspirations of the proletariat can have no other aim than the creation of an absolutely free economic organisation and federation based upon work and equality and wholly independent of any political government, and that such an organisation or federation can only come into being through the spontaneous action of the proletariat itself, through its trade societies, and through self-governing communes.\\" The St. Imier International lasted until 1877, while the First International dissolved in 1876. In July 1881, anarchists would initiate the International Working People's Association, or \\"Black International\\", which remained active until the late 1880s. A further attempt to create a lasting international organization was made in Amsterdam in 1907 by an International Anarchist Congress, though this would have an even briefer life than the Black International. Contemporary anarchist internationals include the anarcho- syndicalist International Workers' Association (established 1922), the International of Anarchist Federations (est. 1968), and Black Bridge International (est. 2001). The Anarkismo.net project (est. 2005) is not an international, but provides a means of increasing cooperation between organisations in the platformist and especifismo traditions. In August 2012, the International Anarchism Gathering took place in St. Imier, partly as a commemoration of the 1872 St. Imier congress.

Early life Born in The Burren, County Clare, Ireland (then Irish Free State), O'Donohue graduated as a civil engineer from University College, Galway in 1954. He moved to Toronto in 1956 to pursue his profession as a municipal engineer designing urban services such as roads, water supply, sewage treatment, storm water run-off and waste management. Inspired by Prime Minister Lester B. Pearson's initiative for a new flag for Canada, O'Donohue joined the Young Liberals in the early 1960s and made many trips to Ottawa with other Young Liberals to support the new flag proposal. As one of the party's first advocates for environmental causes, he encouraged the Young Liberals to become active in environmental issues. His Liberal Party national convention papers on water supply and sewage treatment received national attention. City Council He was elected as a Toronto City Council alderman in the 1966 municipal election. As an engineer, he focused on the need for a clearer understanding of the environment and, as a reformer, encouraged a new approach to local politics. He ran for Toronto mayor in 1972, losing to David Crombie, and again in 1978 to John Sewell. His 1978 defeat to the left-wing Sewell was seen as a result of vote splitting between O'Donohue and David Smith, a Liberal. O'Donohue and colleague Art Eggleton had agreed that only one of them should run against Sewell for mayor in 1980. They were to conduct a public opinion poll to determine which of them had the better chance of toppling the incumbent Mayor. However, according to O'Donohue's memoirs, Eggleton broke the pact and unilaterally declared himself a mayoralty candidate forcing O'Donohue to stay out of the race in order not to split the vote.Dube, Francine.

B01 According to the article, fundraiser Ralph Lean claims that former Metro chair Paul Godfrey and several powerful businessmen got together before the 1980 vote and decided to support Art Eggleton. O'Donohue was returned to City Council following a by-election after the death of City Councillor George Ben in 1980. He spent the next 14 years working to address the many energy and environmental problems facing urban areas. In April 1989, O'Donohue introduced a by-law at City Council to ban the manufacture, sale, distribution and use of ozone depleting substances. It was the first such legislation anywhere and became a model for other cities. As a result, he was invited to make a presentation on the Toronto by-law at the Beckman Institute of the National Academies of Science and Engineering, in Irvine, California. While there, he consulted world-renowned chemist and later Nobel laureate Frank Sherwood Rowland on how to help prevent the dumping of ozone depleting substances into the atmosphere. In 1992, he presented a motion to City Council to adopt a by- law prohibiting anyone from lying, sleeping or blocking city sidewalks.Alexandra Highcrest, In Search of Mario Silva. Eye Weekly. February 22, 1996, He argued that the city paid millions of dollars to make sufficient beds available for the homeless and there was no need for anyone to lie or sleep on the sidewalks. The motion lost and sleeping on the sidewalks has remained part of the landscape in downtown Toronto streets. In the 1994 municipal election, he was defeated in Ward 3 by 28-year-old Mario Silva. The result was very close and subject to several recounts before the Ontario Court of Appeal ruled that Silva had won by 15 votes.No Byline. Court ends seesaw council battle. Globe and Mail.

Their name is the Latin name for the common raven. The band was formed in 1989 by Castus Rabensang, Wim (Venustus) and Meister Selbfried (\\"Master Selfpeace\\") in East Germany. The band often uses bagpipes as the solo instrument; their live performances attract attention with the bizarre look of the musicians being reminiscent of ancient Greek myths: half-naked, dressed in unusual clothes, wearing primitive tribal decorations, often tattooed. Today the band consists of seven members: Castus Rabensang (\\"Castus Ravensong\\"), Xandru, Norri (formerly known as Harmann der Drescher), Hatz (\\"hunt\\"), Vit and Victorius. In May 2005 Meister Selbfried, one of the Corvus Corax founders and the researcher of medieval music, decided to cease his active musicianship and to dedicate himself mostly to managing Corvus Corax's own label Pica Records.Staupa Musica His place in the line-up was taken by Jordon Finus in 2006. The band releases its music through Pica Records in Europe and Noir Records in the USA. The Cantus Buranus projects have thus far been released in Europe by Roadrunner Europe.  Interpretation and theory  Because medieval music theory was dominated by ecclesiastics, it is often difficult to determine from the existing manuscripts just how the secular medieval music sounded. Corvus Corax draws on a number of sources to try to make their music as authentic as possible: they have used documents that \\"condemn profane music\\" as an indicator of what the music might have sounded like, and drawn on nineteenth century scholarly treatises for information. In many cases these treatises are unreliable, as they impart more nineteenth century interpretations of medieval music than factual information on what the music was like. But the profane music of the day was often accompanied by a droning bass tone similar to that generated by the bourdon stop on an organ, which is provided in Corvus Corax's case by the drones on their bagpipes. An inkling as to the harmonies used is found in a song by Walter von der Vogelweide, in which he calls for the song to be played \\"the old way\\", meaning harmonising with thirds. At the time, the third was considered an awkward, ugly interval by the sacred musician -- like the tritone, or diabolus in musica -- but it was a common interval in folk music. Matters are further complicated by the fact that each minstrel would add his personal interpretation to a piece, and that recorded (i.e. written) versions may differ depending on who did the transcribing, and where. It is on this that Corvus Corax's interpretation hinges: medieval popular music was played more from the heart than the brain, and despite making use of scholarship to give them a grounding, Corvus Corax attempts to maintain the spirited, free manner in which the minstrels themselves would have played the music.Meister Selbfried, \\"Background to the Band\\", 1998, obtained from Corvus Corax website.  Projects  In 1996 the band released the album Tanzwut which combined the elements of metal music with their brand sound of bagpipes. The CD turned out to be a commercially successful experiment and the band decided to continue the tradition of that album in a separate musical project called Tanzwut, which included Castus Rabensang (German Rabensang = ravensong), Wim, and Teufel (German Teufel = Devil) from Corvus Corax as well as three new members. Corvus Corax performing live at Wacken Open Air in 2010 In 2005 Corvus Corax started the ambitious project \\"Cantus Buranus\\": a full-length opera set to the original Carmina Burana manuscript lyrics. The music for the opera was fully composed by the band and had no connection with the famous work by Carl Orff. It was performed with symphonic orchestra, choir and medieval ensemble, combining traditional symphonism with medieval minstrel-like melodies. The project included a CD recording, a DVD, as well as live performances. A live CD and DVD recording of Cantus Buranus was released in March 2006. 2005 also marked the band's debut concerts in the USA. The band performed four sets on each of four different days in mid-October, not far from Philadelphia at the Pennsylvania Renaissance Faire. There was also a \\"secret show\\" held for employees of the Faire. Footage shot by the band members and crew was assembled into a featurette that was included as a bonus track on the US edition of the band's live DVD, \\"Gaudia Vite.\\" Out on August 1, 2008 via the band owned label Pica Music, Cantus Buranus II was released.,Corvus Corax to launch new album and DVD 'Cantus Buranus II' in early August It is a new orchestral recording of songs from the Medieval manuscript \\"Carmina Burana\\". The Berlin-based act created a composition for orchestra, choir and a Medieval ensemble and recorded the CD and DVD live in the Museum Island in front of 5000 people. Corvus Corax performed a live rendition of their song \\"Ballade De Mercy\\" in the pilot episode of the HBO TV series Game of Thrones, based on the fantasy series A Song of Ice and Fire by George R.R. Martin.http://www.westeros.org/GoT/News/Entry/3600/ The pilot episode was changed dramatically before it aired on TV, and the performance was not used.

The company specializes in repairing the property damage caused by conflicts between superheroes and supervillains. Four Damage Control limited series have been published to date. Damage Control has appeared in various media adaptations including the 2017 Marvel Cinematic Universe film Spider-Man: Homecoming. Publication history Dwayne McDuffie, who co-created the concept with artist Ernie Col√≥n and wrote Damage Control's initial stories, pitched Damage Control to Marvel as \\"a sitcom within the Marvel Universe\\". Damage Control employees first appear in a five-page story \\"The Sales Pitch\\" in 1988's Marvel Age Annual and again in 1989 in a serialized 7-page story published in the anthology comic Marvel Comics Presents #19. Subsequently, the employees of Damage Control have been the subject of three separate comic book limited series (each limited to four issues), published between 1989 and 1991, including Damage Control: The Movie (1991). Damage Control was featured in an entry in the Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe Update '89 #2. Among its later appearances were those in the 2006 storyline \\"Civil War; the series Irredeemable Ant-Man; and the first issue of World War Hulk Aftersmash: Damage Control, a three-issue limited series tying into the 2008 \\"World War Hulk\\" storyline. Fictional biography Damage Control was founded by Anne Marie Hoag and was originally owned by Tony Stark and Wilson Fisk, each owning half the stock of the company, though Stark felt uneasy cooperating with Fisk, a notorious criminal. The company was headquartered in New York's Flatiron Building. Damage Control employees have been in the middle of a breakout at the Vault, confronted Doctor Doom, have been threatened with death by the Punisher and have met vastly powerful cosmic entities such as the Silver Surfer and Galactus. They have \\"fought\\" side by side with the X-Men, socialized with the New Warriors and were even almost menaced by the Hulk. When Ms. Hoag was offered a job in government, she nominated Robin Chapel as her replacement. Stark and Fisk sold their stock in Damage Control: Stark because he did not want to be associated with Fisk and Fisk because he had no confidence in Robin's ability to lead the company. Another company, Carlton Co, took control of Damage Control and tried to make Damage Control more profitable, but in the process angered a lot of employees and nearly ruined Damage Control. Ms. Hoag convinced S.H.I.E.L.D. to invest in Damage Control and they loaned her the money to buy back the company. S.H.I.E.L.D. also found out that the sale of Damage Control had been a plot by Fisk to buy back the company for cheap. During the events of Acts of Vengeance (an event Fisk helped organize), massive damage was done to the city and Fisk made a large profit when Damage Control was hired to repair the damages. The confrontation with the Kingpin causes unexpected results. The Damage Control staff find that a movie has been put out, a fictionalized version of their confrontation with the Kingpin. At the wrap party for the premiere, the Damage Control staff is summoned by the Silver Surfer to help deal with Edifice Rex, a former employee. He had gained cosmic powers and this, combined with an anal-retentive personality, threatens the cosmos. Several of the employees meet and discuss the problem with other cosmic entities, such as Galactus and Lord Chaos. Robin Chapel eventually solves this problem by firing Rex.

This leads Wolverine to Anne-Marie Hoag, Damage Control's President (and a brief confrontation with Ann, long-time D.C. receptionist). Anne-Marie reveals that Declun and his investors took a controlling share of the stock after the company went public to obtain more funds. D.C. has also obtained the Stamford reconstruction contract and the contract to train and evaluate registered super-beings. Anne- Marie has suspected Declun of illegal activities but did not have strong enough evidence to counter his ties with Washington D.C. and the President.

The Nordic Stone Age begins at that time, with the Upper Paleolithic Ahrensburg culture, giving way to the Mesolithic hunter-gatherers by the 7th millennium BC (Maglemosian culture c. 7500‚Äì6000 BC, Kongemose culture c. 6000‚Äì5200 BC, Erteb√∏lle culture c. 5300‚Äì3950 BC). The Neolithic stage is marked by the Funnelbeaker culture (4000‚Äì2700 BC), followed by the Pitted Ware culture (3200‚Äì2300 BC). Around 2800 BC, metal was introduced in Scandinavia in the Corded Ware culture. In much of Scandinavia, a Battle Axe culture became prominent, known from some 3,000 graves. The period 2500‚Äì500 BC also left many visible remains to modern times, most notably the many thousands rock carvings (petroglyphs) in western Sweden at Tanumshede and in Norway at Alta. A more advanced culture came with the Nordic Bronze Age (c. 1800‚Äì500 BC). It was followed by the Iron Age in the 4th century BC. Ice age The density of archaeological sites in Sweden. The pre-history of Scandinavia begins at the end of the Pleistocene epoch, following the last glacial period's receding Fenno-Scandian ice sheet. Parts of Denmark, Scania and the Norwegian coast line were free from ice around 13,000 BC, and around 10,000 BC the rim of ice was around Dalsland, V√§sterg√∂tland and √ñsterg√∂tland. It wasn't until 7000 BC that all of Svealand and the modern coastal regions of northeastern Sweden were free of ice, although the huge weight of the ice sheet had caused isostatic depression of Fennoscandia, placing large parts of eastern Sweden and western Finland underwater. In Scandinavia, the time following the last ice age period begins at circa 9500 BC and is called at first the Yoldia Stage, after the Yoldia Sea, then the Ancylus Stage, after the Ancylus Lake in turn named after Ancylus fluviatilis, a small fresh-water gastropod from this time. At this time, Denmark and Sweden were joined and the \\"Baltic Sea\\" of the age was a fresh water lake called the Ancylus Lake. The Ancylus age is followed by formation of the Littorina Sea and the Litorina Stage (named after the Littorina littorea mollusc) at around 6200 BC. With the first human colonization of this new land (the territory of modern Sweden was partly under water though, and with radically different coastlines) during the Ancylus and Litorina ages begins the Nordic Stone Age. In recent years there have been archaeological finds in caves which strongly suggest human inhabitation of Scandinavia before the Weichsel glaciation, at least 50,000 years ago, presumably by Neanderthals. Stone age =Upper Paleolithic= As the ice receded reindeer grazed on the plains of Denmark and southernmost Sweden. This was the land of the Ahrensburg culture, whose members hunted over territories 100,000 km¬≤ vast and lived in teepees on the tundra. On this land there was little forest but arctic white birch and rowan, but the taiga slowly appeared. =Mesolithic= PrehistoricThe Scandinavian peninsula was the last part of Europe to be colonized after the Last Glacial Maximum. The migration routes, cultural networks, and the genetic makeup of the first Scandinavians remain elusive and several hypotheses exist based on archaeology, climate modeling, and genetics. Analysis of genomes of early Scandinavian Hunter-Gatherers (SHGs) from the cave Stora F√∂rvar on Stora Karls√∂, Stora Bjers on Gotland, Hummervikholmen in Norway showed that migrations followed two routes: one from the south and another from the northeast along the ice-free Norwegian Atlantic coast. These groups met and mixed in Scandinavia, creating a population more diverse than contemporaneous central and western European hunter-gatherers. In the 7th millennium BC, when the reindeer and their hunters had moved for northern Scandinavia, forests had been established in the land. A culture called the Maglemosian culture lived in Denmark and southern Sweden, and north of them, in Norway and most of southern Sweden, the Fosna-Hensbacka culture, who lived mostly along the shores of the thriving forests. Utilizing fire, boats and stone tools enabled these Stone Age inhabitants to survive life in northern Europe. The northern hunter/gatherers followed the herds and the salmon runs, moving south during the winters, and moving north again during the summers. These early peoples followed cultural traditions similar to those practiced throughout other regions in the far-north areas, including modern Finland, Russia, and across the Bering Strait into the northernmost strip of North America (containing portions of today's Alaska and Canada) Flake axe typical of the Erteb√∏lle culture. The Maglemosian people lived in forest and wetland environments using fishing and hunting tools made from wood, bone and flint microliths. A characteristic of the culture are the sharply edged microliths of flintstone which were used for spear heads and arrowheads. Microliths finds are more sparse from c. 6000 BC and the period is said to transit into the Kongemose culture (c. 6000‚Äì5200 BC). The finds from this period are characterised by long flintstone flakes which were used for making the characteristic rhombic arrowheads, scrapers, drills, awls and toothed blades. During the 6th millennium BC, southern Scandinavia was clad in lush forests of temperate broadleaf and mixed forests. In these forests roamed animals such as aurochs, wisent, moose and red deer. Now, the Kongemose culture lived off these animals. Like their predecessors, they also hunted seals and fished in the rich waters. North of the Kongemose people, lived other hunter-gatherers in most of southern Norway and Sweden, called the N√∏stvet and Lihult cultures, descendants of the Fosna and Hensbacka cultures. These cultures still hunted, in the end of the 6th millennium BC when the Kongemose culture was replaced by the Erteb√∏lle culture in the south. =Neolithic= During the 5th millennium BC, the Erteb√∏lle culture took up pottery from the Linear Pottery culture in the south, whose members had long cultivated the land and kept animals. About 4000 BC south Scandinavia up to River Dal√§lven in Sweden became part of the Funnelbeaker culture (4000‚Äì2700 BC), a culture that originated in southern parts of Europe and slowly advanced up through today's Uppland, Sweden. Tribes along the coasts of Svealand, G√∂taland, √Öland, northeastern Denmark and southern Norway learnt new technologies that became the Pitted Ware culture (3200‚Äì2300 BC). The Pitted Ware culture then developed along Sweden's east coast as a return to a hunting economy in the mid-4th millennium BC (see the Alvastra pile-dwelling). It is not known what language these early Scandinavians spoke. It might have been similar to Basque, due to the distribution of the monuments by early megalith builders. Towards the end of the 3rd millennium BC, they were overrun by new groups who many scholars think spoke Proto-Indo-European, the Battle-Axe culture. This new people advanced up to Uppland and the Oslofjord, and they probably provided the language that was the ancestor of the modern Scandinavian languages. This new culture had the battle axe as a status symbol, and were cattle herders. However, soon a new invention would arrive, that would usher in a time of cultural advance in Scandinavia, the Bronze Age. Bronze Age N√§mforsen, Gl√∂sa and G√§rdes√•n. During the Nordic Bronze Age from c. 1700‚Äì500 BC, an advanced civilization appears in Denmark, parts of Sweden and parts of Norway. They manufactured bronze tools and weapons as well as jewellery and artifacts of bronze and gold. All the bronze and gold was imported and it has been assumed that the civilization was founded in amber trade, through contacts with Central European and Mediterranean cultures. The period between 2300 and 500 BC was the most intensive petroglyph-carving period in Scandinavia, with carvings depicting agricultural activities, animals, nature, hunts, ships, ceremonies, warfare, etc.. Petroglyphs with themes of a sexual nature have also been found in Bohusl√§n, dating from 800 to 500 BC. Iron Age Petroglyphs from Scandinavia (H√§ljesta, V√§stmanland in Sweden). Composite image. :See also the separate articles on the Pre-Roman Iron Age, the Vendel Age, and the Roman Iron Age Tacitus (about 98 AD) described a nation called \\"Suiones\\" living on an island in the Ocean. These Suiones had ships that were peculiar because they had a prow in both ends (the shape we recognise as Viking ships). This word Suiones is the same name as in Anglo-Saxon Sweon whose country in Angle-Saxon was called Sweoland (Svealand). In Beowulf, this tribe is also called Sweo√∞eod, from which the name Sweden is derived, and the country has the name Sweorice, which is an old form, in Old English (Anglo-Saxon), of the present Swedish name for Sweden. In the 6th century the Ostrogoth Jordanes mentioned a tribe named Suehans which is the same name as Tacitus' Suiones. He also unwittingly described the same tribe by a different name, the Suetidi which is the same as an old name for Sweden, Sv√≠√æj√≥√∞ and the English Sweo√∞eod. Several sources, such as Beowulf, Ynglingatal, Ynglinga saga, Saxo Grammaticus and Historia Norwegiae, mention a number of Swedish kings who lived in the 6th century, such as Eadgils, Ohthere and Onela, as well as a number of Geatish kings. Some of these kings were in all likelihood historic kings, although the sources sometimes give contradictory information, such as the death of Ottar. See Mythological kings of Sweden and Semi-legendary kings of Sweden. In those days the kings were warlords rather than kings as we understand that title today, and what was to become Sweden, Norway and Denmark in a modern sense, were a number of petty kingdoms whose borders changed constantly as the kings killed each other, and had the local assemblies accept them as kings. The politics of these early kingdoms are retold in Beowulf (see e.g. the semi-legendary Swedish-Geatish wars) and the Norse sagas. One of the most powerful kings was the Swedish king who according to early sources only ruled what is today eastern Svealand. It is unknown when it happened and it probably happened several times, but when sources become more reliable the territories of the Swedish kings include V√§sterg√∂tland and other parts of G√∂taland. This stage is by some considered to be the beginning of Sweden, as we know it today.

He was considered to be a popular and engaging personality who commentated on many sports, particularly winter sports and football. It was not unusual for Norwegians to turn off the sound on the TV and listen to him on the radio instead.Aftenposten 22 June -85 In September 1981 he came to international prominence when he said ‚ÄúYour boys took a hell of a beating‚Äù in commentary following Norway's 2‚Äì1 victory against England in a World Cup qualifier. Career Lillelien went to Northwestern University to study journalism in 1948. After going back to Norway for his military service, he got a job in the newspaper Fremtiden, after which he joined the Norwegian broadcasting network. In 1963 he began a long-term working relationship with former Olympic champion skier H√•kon Brusveen at a cross country ski race at Holmenkollen.Aftenposten 16 March 1985 This collaboration would last for the rest of Lillelien's working days. Brusveen continued to work for NRK after Lillelien's death. Although privately Lillelien was quite reserved and reflective, he developed a gregarious on-air persona. He said \\"We shouldn't necessarily make a boring radio programme even if it is a boring football match. We should make a sports show that excites people\\". He continued to work in broadcasting until just before his death from cancer in 1987. \\"Your boys took a hell of a beating\\" Lillelien commentated on radio on Norway's 2‚Äì1 victory against England in a World Cup UEFA qualifier in Oslo on 9 September 1981. At the end of the match, alternating between the English and Norwegian language, he exultantly proclaimed amidst scenes of jubilant Norway supporters and players in the football stadium: \\"We are best in the world! We have beaten England! England, birthplace of giants\\", before taunting a roll call of English historical figures: :\\"Lord Nelson, Lord Beaverbrook, Sir Winston Churchill, Sir Anthony Eden, Clement Attlee, Henry Cooper, Lady Diana, vi har sl√•tt dem alle sammen, vi har sl√•tt dem alle sammen! (we have beaten them all, we have beaten them all!). Maggie Thatcher, can you hear me? Maggie Thatcher ... your boys took a hell of a beating! Your boys took a hell of a beating!\\" A significant portion of his excitement was due to how English football was held in very high regard in Norway at the time, as it was often easier to watch the Football League First Division on television in Norway than in England during the 1970s, with one match broadcast live each weekend, and with score updates from other simultaneous matches. Although the broadcast was initially meant solely for the Norwegian home audience its content soon made its way across the North Sea and became legendary in the history of sports commentary in England. In 2002 it topped a list of the ‚Äú10 greatest bits of commentary ever‚Äù in The Guardian newspaper. =Full Norwegian/English version= The full Norwegian/English version reads as follows: :\\"Vi er best i verden! Vi er best i verden! Vi har sl√•tt England 2-1 i fotball!! Det er aldeles utrolig! Vi har sl√•tt England! England, kjempers f√∏deland. Lord Nelson, Lord Beaverbrook, Sir Winston Churchill, Sir Anthony Eden, Clement Attlee, Henry Cooper, Lady Diana--vi har sl√•tt dem alle sammen. Vi har sl√•tt dem alle sammen. :\\"Maggie Thatcher can you hear me? Maggie Thatcher, jeg har et budskap til deg midt under valgkampen. Jeg har et budskap til deg: Vi har sl√•tt England ut av Verdensmesterskapet i fotball. Maggie Thatcher, som de sier p√• ditt sprog i boksebarene rundt Madison Square Garden i New York: Your boys took a hell of a beating! Your boys took a hell of a beating!\\" =Translated version= The full version, completely translated to English: :\\"We are the best in the world! We are the best in the world! We have beaten England 2-1 in football!! It is completely unbelievable! We have beaten England! England, birthplace of giants. Lord Nelson, Lord Beaverbrook, Sir Winston Churchill, Sir Anthony Eden, Clement Attlee, Henry Cooper, Lady Diana--we have beaten them all. We have beaten them all. :\\"Maggie Thatcher can you hear me? Maggie Thatcher, I have a message for you in the middle of the election campaign. I have a message for you: We have knocked England out of the football World Cup. Maggie Thatcher, as they say in your language in the boxing bars around Madison Square Garden in New York: Your boys took a hell of a beating! Your boys took a hell of a beating!\\" =Parodies and homages= In 2002 Lillelien's words were designated the greatest piece of sports commentary ever by The Observer's Sport Monthly magazine. Such is its place in British sporting culture that parodies of the commentary have been written to celebrate domestic sporting victories, such as the following when the England cricket team beat Australia to regain the Ashes in September 2005: :\\"Kylie Minogue! Steve Irwin! Holly Valance! Crocodile Dundee! Natalie Imbruglia! Ian Thorpe! Mrs. Mangel! Can you hear me? Your boys took one hell of a beating!\\" And again, when England's cricket team finally won a game against New Zealand in the 2006/7 one-day series, the BBC's web coverage came up with: :\\"Dame Kiri te Kanawa, Peter Jackson, Neil Finn, Sir Edmund Hillary, Jonah Lomu - we have beaten them all! Helen Clark, can you hear me? Your boys took one hell of a beating!\\" Following Scotland's 2‚Äì1 victory against Norway in Oslo in September 2005, the Daily Record parodied the quote, using known Norwegians: :\\"King Olaf, Roald Amundsen, Liv Ullmann, Edvard Munch, Vidkun Quisling, Thor Heyerdahl, Henrik Ibsen, Edvard Grieg, Monty Python's Norwegian Blue, Morten Harket, and Anni-Frid from ABBA. You boys took a helluva beating!\\" The Deputy Editor of the Daily Record at the time, Murray Foote, later issued an apology for the inclusion of Vidkun Quisling in the quotation: :\\"While I naturally assumed Quisling was not one of Norway's favourite sons, I was truly unaware of the deep loathing his name engenders amongst your countrymen. Had I been aware of this, I would not have used his name and I apologise unreservedly for the offence it caused.\\" In advance of the Scotland v Norway game at Hampden on 10 October 2008, a parody was created by Tennent Caledonian Breweries (sponsor of the Scottish National Team) for radio and subsequently animated and posted on YouTube. Following Manchester University winning University Challenge against the University of Cambridge Pembroke College in March 2012, a commentator for the Manchester student newspaper observed \\"We have beaten Pembroke College, Cambridge! Cambridge, birthplace of giants. Rab Butler, Clive James, Ted Hughes, William Pitt the Younger, Eric Idle, Peter Cook, Bill Oddie! Bill Oddie, can you hear me? Your boys took a hell of a beating!\\" The speech is also parodied in the 2001 British drama film Mean Machine, starring Vinnie Jones. In the film, at the conclusion of the match between the guards and the prisoners at the fictional Longmarsh prison, in a 3‚Äì2 win for the prisoners, the commentators, Bob Likely (Jason Flemyng) and Bob Carter (Jake Abraham) quoted \\"Guards of Pentonville, Guards of Wandsworth, Walton nick in Liverpool, Policemen of Britain, Traffic Wardens, Parole officers, Wheel clampers, your boys have taken a helluva beating today, a helluva beating!\\".

The bridge is named for Fred Schwengel, a former U.S. Representative from Davenport, Iowa and one of the driving forces behind the Interstate Highway Act. The structure was designed by the Iowa State Highway Commission, and was built by the Industrial Construction Company of Minneapolis (contractor), Gould Construction Company of Davenport, and Roy Ryan & Sons of Evanston, Indiana who was responsible for the substructure. The bridge opened on October 27, 1966, and is maintained by the Illinois Department of Transportation. It underwent a major rehabilitation project in 1996. History On October 5, 1964, a 40-foot steel and wood form was swinging from its roadstead on pier No. 13 after cement was being dumped on it. In 1965, structural steel was installed on the bridge. During that year, officials inspected the bridge. On June 29, 1966, the bridge's center span was installed. The bridge opened to traffic on October 27, 1966. In 1995, the bridge was renamed for former U.S. Representative Fred Schwengel. He was among the attendees of the October 27, 1966 bridge opening. Temporary closures In 2008, the bridge was closed for two months after inspectors found cracks in the steel under the bridge deck. On May 12, 2009, the eastbound lane of the bridge closed after a crack was found in the top flange of the beam. As a result, inspectors visited the bridge and determined on how to repair the beam. The bridge reopened in August 2009. On April 10, 2015, the westbound lanes of the bridge closed for repairs on the joints and reopened on April 14, 2015. Replacement Starting in 2020, the Illinois Department of Transportation will begin a study, which is expected to cost $20,000, to replace the span. The plan from 2020 to 2025 is to spend $304.5 million on the bridge. By 2025, Illinois is expected to spend $23 billion on concrete, as well as fixing and expanding of roadways and 9 million square feet (836,000 square meters) of bridge decks. The Illinois department will be the lead agency on the project with the state of Iowa sharing in the costs.

The championship was originally created in June 1966 but WCWA's predecessor NWA Big Time Wrestling (BTW), billed as the local version of the NWA United States Heavyweight Championship before being renamed the NWA American Heavyweight Championship in May 1968. In 1982 Big Time Wrestling rebranded themselves as \\"World Class Championship Wrestling\\" (WCCW) and the championship was renamed the WCCW American Heavyweight Championship. In 1986 WCCW withdrew from the National Wrestling Alliance, creating the World Class Wrestling Association, replacing the WCCW American Heavyweight Championship with the WCWA Heavyweight Championship, replacing the NWA Worlds Heavyweight Championship as the top title recognized by the promotion. In 1989, the WCWA championship was unified with the AWA World Heavyweight Championship to become the USWA Unified World Heavyweight Championship as WCWA merged with the Continental Wrestling Association (CWA) to become the United States Wrestling Association. In 1990 WCWA split from the USWA, but the promotion folded without determining a WCWA World Heavyweight Champion. As it is a professional wrestling championship, the WCWA World Heavyweight Chamionship was not won not by actual competition, but by a scripted ending to a match. The first recognized Texas based NWA United States Champion was Fritz Von Erich, introducing the championship to his Southwest Sports promotion as the top championship in his territory. Fritz Von Erich would go on to win the championship a record setting 20 times. At the time it was not unusual for the promoter, if he was also an active wrestler to hold the championship multiple times, being that he always be available to work shows and face off against various \\"outsiders\\". Fritz' last reign was on June 4, 1982 16 years after his first title victory. Rick Rude was the last WCCW American Heavyweight Champion and announced as the first WCWA World Heavyweight Champion on February 21, 1986. Jerry Lawler was the final champion, winning it on April 14, 1989, followed by the announcement that the championship had been unified with the AWA World Heavyweight Champion in September 1990. The longest confirmed reign, Fritz Von Erich's fifth reign over all, lasted from March 27, 1967 to April 5, 1968 for a total of 375 days. Von Erich's final reign was also the shortest in history, as he vacated moments after winning it in the main event of the Fritz Von Erich Retirement Show.

Carnmenyn monument in the foreground Summit of Carn Menyn Bluestones on Carn Menyn Carn Menyn is a grouping of craggy rock outcrops or tors in the Preseli Hills in the Welsh county of Pembrokeshire. Name and location The name means \\"Butter Rock\\". It is sometimes called Carn Meini (\\"Rock of Stones\\"), but this is a modern corruption of the original name.Charles, B. G., The Placenames of Pembrokeshire, National Library of Wales, Aberystwyth, 1992, , p 125 Carn Menyn sits on top of the Preseli ridge, close to the stone setting of Bedd Arthur. It consists of an outcrop of white spotted dolerite similar to that of other tors in the area, and several other prehistoric sites have been identified nearby. The mountain-top setting provides commanding views over the Gower Peninsula and across Cardigan Bay to the Ll≈∑n Peninsula. Bluestones Carn Menyn is believed by some to have been the main source for the bluestones used at Stonehenge. Sir Andrew Ramsey first suggested it as a contender in the mid-nineteenth century. In the early 1920s HH Thomas showed through petrographic analysis that many of the bluestones had come from the Preseli Hills, and in 2005 work led by Timothy Darvill and Geoff Wainwright supported the idea that Carn Menyn was the primary quarry. This is disputed by others, and Williams-Thorpe and others from the Open University have suggested that the Stonehenge bluestones came from at least twenty different places, with Carn Goedog about one mile to the west as the most likely source for the spotted dolerites. Survey work between 2002 and 2004 by the Strumble-Preseli Ancient Communities and Environment Study (SPACES) recorded an enclosure on the upper part of the outcrop consisting of a steep- sided promontory with a bank of stones across its neck. Although only around 3,500 square metres in area the enclosure contains several dolerite outcrops, each naturally fractured into shapes that could be formed into columns. Semi- worked megaliths lay scattered around apparently having been simply levered out from the larger outcrops. It is debatable whether these \\"semi-worked megaliths\\" are prehistoric or recent, since this area has been used by the farming community for at least 300 years for the collection of stone gateposts, lintels and building slabs. Geochemical analysis has shown that some of the bluestones from the inner horseshoe at Stonehenge probably came from Carn Menyn, Carn Goedog, Carn Breseb, Cerrig Marchogion and other sites in the Preseli Hills, while rhyolite fragments may have come from Carn Alw and further afield.Brian John, 2008 \\"The Bluestone Enigma: Stonehenge, Preseli and the Ice Age.\\" Greencroft Books. . Evidence for later exploitation of the stone at Carn Menyn has been found despite the site's remoteness. Two nearby chapels and many houses in the area were built from Carn Menyn stone. However, this stone was not used preferentially in megalithic or ritual structures‚Äîstone from all of the outcrops or tors on Mynydd Preseli has been used in buildings and field boundaries, so long as access by horse-drawn sleds and carts was possible. In April 2005 an excavation at the site clarified the extent of the enclosure but did not retrieve any cultural material. The same year, the then Archdruid of the Welsh Gorsedd of Bards, Robyn Lewis, wrote to the Daily Telegraph proposing that the Bluestones be returned from Stonehenge to the Preseli Hills.British Archaeology Issue 78 September 2004- ISSN 1357-4442 This was also the subject of a stage play called Bringing Back the Bluestones. Geological studies by Bevins, Ixer and Pearce in 2013 and 2014 have confirmed the suggestion of the OU team that the spotted dolerites at Stonehenge have come from Carn Goedog and not Carn Menyn.Bevins, RE, Ixer, RA and NJG Pearce. 2013.

It is the district capital and largest town in Hilir Perak district and third largest town in the state of Perak with an estimated population of around 120,000, about half of Hilir Perak district's total population (232,900). In the early days, the town was known as Teluk Mak Intan, after a female Mandailing trader. It was here that the Perak rulers held court from 1528 until Kuala Kangsar became the royal town in 1877.New Straits Times : Walking Through History During the British protectorate era, the named was changed to Teluk Anson (Anson Bay), in honour of a British officer and last lieutenant-governor of Penang, Major-General Sir Archibald Edward Harbord Anson, who drew the plan of the modern township in 1882. In 1982 during the centenary of the town's establishment, the name was changed again to Teluk Intan (Diamond Bay) by the Sultan of Perak. Leaning Tower of Teluk Intan is one of the town attractions. The town has a number of colonial buildings and Chinese shophouses together with modern buildings, few shopping complexes and a modern cinema. Geography The town was founded on the river bank of the Perak River. The river forms an oxbow meander as it flows through the town, and the town is built around the oxbow. During high-tides, some parts of the town will be flooded with water even though there are watergates and banks to protect the town. Various measures taken by the government to solve the problem have seen relatively few floods in Teluk Intan nowadays. There has been speculation that the river's flow will erode the narrow neck of land in between the loops of the meander effectively turning Teluk Intan into an island. The town is on Malaysia Federal Route 58 (Jalan Changkat Jong and Jalan Maharaja Lela), Perak State Route A151 (Jalan Sultan Abdullah) and Perak State Route A147 (Jalan Padang Tembak). History The area around Teluk Intan was originally populated by refugees from the Malacca Sultanate who were part of the entourage of the Raja Muzaffar Shah, the eldest son of the last Sultan of Melaka, Sultan Mahmud Shah. Upon fleeing the Portuguese conquest of Melaka in 1511, a new kingdom was established on the banks of the Perak River near what is now Teluk Intan, and the court remained there until its relocation to Kuala Kangsar in the northern part of the state later in the 19th century. This legacy can be seen in the choice of Teluk Intan as the location where the official residences of the Raja Muda (Crown Prince) and Raja di Hilir (4th in line of succession to the Perak throne) of Perak under the reign of Sultan Idris Shah. The town is one of four towns that play a role in Perak's complex ruler succession system. According to the system, a crown prince stayed at Teluk Intan Palace before entering the next stage of becoming Raja Bendahara (Prime Prince). Only after becoming Raja Bendahara will he proceed to be Raja Muda (Crown Prince) and then Sultan of Perak. This succession system was changed by the former Sultan, Almarhum Sultan Azlan Shah just before he was appointed the Yang Dipertuan Agong. His son was the then Raja Muda (now the Sultan of Perak) and did not live in Teluk Intan. The former palace is located just outside the town, and has fallen into disrepair. The town of Teluk Intan developed around a few small villages in the location, such as Durian Sebatang, Pasir Bedamar, and Batak Rabit. A plan to build a township linking the few villages was drawn up by Sir Archibald Anson during the late 19th century, and the township was named after him in 1882. Teluk Intan developed into a port, and many agricultural products and tin were exported from it. The fourth railway track in Malaya was built connecting Tapah and Teluk Intan, showing the port town's importance during the British protectorate age. Teluk Intan was also home to the meeting between Raja Abdullah, Dato' Maharajalela and other Malay chieftains who plotted to kill J. W. W. Birch, the first British Resident of Perak. The meeting was held in Durian Sebatang. Birch was later killed in Pasir Salak while bathing in the river. The last major engagement during the Malayan Emergency was fought in the marshes near Teluk Intan in 1958, and ended with the surrender of the local Malayan Races Liberation Army forces to government forces. By the early 1980s the town was the third largest town in Perak. Teluk Intan served as the major administrative and business settlement for smaller neighbouring towns such as Tapah, Bidor, Bagan Datoh and Hutan Melintang. Until the mid-1990s Sabak Bernam, a town in the neighbouring state of Selangor, also dependeded on Teluk Intan for most of their basic services. Even their telephone area code was registered using Perak's area code of +605 instead of +603 that is used in Selangor. Acute medical cases would be transferred to Teluk Intan Hospital as their hospital did not have the equipment or expertise. As the Perak River became shallower each year due to upstream erosion and silt deposition near Teluk Intan, the town lost its two most important roles in Perak's economy which was being an export harbour for tin and rubber and as a petroleum distribution centre for Shell Malaysia. This is because big oil tankers and cargo ships were no longer able to sail into the town's port. By the end of the 1980s, Shell Malaysia transferred their petroleum storing facilities to the coastal town of Lumut in Manjung, located 60 km from Teluk Intan. As the economic activity declined, it also lost its railway facilities which connected the town with Tapah and the national railway network. During the 1990s, economic activities in Teluk Intan continued to decline. This situation forced the younger generation to migrate to bigger cities such as Ipoh, Kuala Lumpur, Klang and Shah Alam in search of better jobs. Ironically this caused the town to suffer a shortage in labour supply especially in the agriculture sector, resulting in an increase of migrant workers from Indonesia and Bangladesh. With the development of a new town centre along with the completion of new coastal highway from Klang to Sabak Bernam in late 1999, Teluk Intan began to enjoy a resurgence in its economic activity. In April 2004, the town was made the fourth municipality (having upgraded to Municipal Council status, or Majlis Perbandaran) in Perak after Ipoh, Taiping and Manjung. Main economic activities The main economic activities in Teluk Intan are oil palm cultivation and palm oil production. Many plantations around Teluk Intan are owned by big corporations such as Sime Darby and United Plantations (UP).United Plantations There are some other industries in Teluk Intan including shipbuildingSumber Samudera Sdn Bhd and the textile industry. Shopping centres, modern cinema, shops, and educational institutions also bring many people to Teluk Intan weekly. Shopping As it is the major town in Hilir Perak, Teluk Intan's shopping centres attract shoppers from nearby smaller townships and the surrounding area. They include: *Kompleks Aik Aik, Jalan Mahkota *Kompleks Menara Condong, Jalan Ah Cheong *The Store, Jalan Ah Cheong *TF Value Mart, Jalan Maharajalela *TF Value Mart, Jalan Sungai Manik Healthcare The main healthcare centres in Teluk Intan town are: *Teluk Intan Hospital (providing secondary health care service) *Pusat Pakar Rajindar SinghPrivate hospitals by state; Pusat Pakar Rajindar Singh *Teluk Intan General Clinic *Anson Bay Medical CentreAnson Bay Medical Centre (ABMC) Places of interest =Leaning Tower of Teluk Intan= One of the town attractions is a Leaning Tower erected in 1885 by a Chinese builder, Mr. Leong Choon Cheong. It started to tilt four years after its construction finished due to an underground stream. The tower was originally used as a water tower supplying the area of the town. It had a clock at the top, which still rings every 15 minutes. The tower also served as a beacon to guide ships into Teluk Intan Port. The tower came close to being demolished when a decision by the then Lower Perak Sanitary Board passed a resolution to have it demolished in July 1941 due to the impending air raids. However, another board meeting in September of 1941 reversed that decision and the tower remains standing. Currently it is a local tourist attraction, and no longer stores water. The tower is also recognised as a National Heritage through joint efforts by the National Heritage Department, Ministry of Tourism and Culture, Perak State government and Teluk Intan Municipal Council.https://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2015/02/28/teluk-intan- national-heritage/ The area around the tower was paved with bricks and became a plaza. The main street at the centre of Teluk Intan, Jalan Ah Cheong, is named after Leong Choon Cheong to commemorate his contribution. GPS Coordinates: 4¬∞1.544‚Ä≤N, 101¬∞1.133‚Ä≤E Memorial Stone =Batu Tenggek (War Memorial)= Another attraction is the 'Batu Tenggek' (Sitting Boulder) which is situated at a junction in the town centre. There is a local legend that the rock was placed there by a British soldier, and was originally the size of a matchbox but grew bigger over the years however this is not the truth. The boulder was placed in the compound of the Lower Perak Club in an angle formed by Dew Road and Batak Rabit Road, and the giant granite boulder was placed on a dressed based made of solid stone. The memorial commemorating the fallen of World war I & II was officiated by Sir Theodore Fraser, General Commanding Officer of the Malaya Command of the British empire during his tenure between 1924 and 1927. Carved on the dressed stone is a line taken from Laurence Binyon's famous poem, \\"For the Fallen\\": :At the going down of the sun and in the morning :We will remember them :::1914‚Äì1918 =The Ruin of Raja Muda's Palace= This palace was once the official residence of The Raja Muda of Perak. After the demise of the Raja Muda, the palace was neglected, and drug addicts used and stripped the building. Some people believe the remains of the palace to be haunted. It is illegal to enter the grounds without permission, because it is the property of the Sultan of Perak. The ruin is located next to the mansion of Dato. Mah, near Jalan Sekolah. =Hock Soon Temple= There is also a famous temple complex in Teluk Intan, known as Hock Soon Keong (Hock Soon Temple) dedicated to Seng Gong. The origins of the temple are unknown, while the main temple building (not the original one) was constructed in 1883, as indicated by a legend painted on the building. Hock Soon Temple was the centrepoint of all Hokkien Chinese in Teluk Intan during the British colonial era. The local Hokkien people would congregate at the temple to solve all problems, from giving aid to the poor to solving fights between clans. The local Hokkien people used to select three local Hokkiens, usually businessmen and famous men to settle their problems. The temple was built with Southern Chinese architecture, the most notable feature being the elaborately decorated upturned eaves. There is also a century old mosque just opposite the temple, which is frequently mentioned as a typical depiction of religious harmony in Malaysia. =Sri Subramaniam Temple= The temple is popularly called 'Perak Thendayuthapani Temple', and also as Malaysia's Palani Andavar. Construction of the temple began in 1926. Financial support was provided by the Nattukottai Chettiars (also known as the Nagarathars), a prominent mercantile community with origins in Tamil Nadu, India. The most prominent festival held at this temple is the Chitra Pournami during the Tamil month of Chithrai (April‚ÄìMay). The Chitra Pournami festival lasts three days. On the third day of the festival (the day of Pournami, full moon), the Silver Chariot (Velli Ratham) is taken in procession. This velli ratham was brought to the temple in the year 1932. The procession's route usually covers the entire old town of Teluk Intan. The temple is managed by the Nagarathars of seven towns including Teluk Intan, Tapah, Kampar, Bidor, SitiawanPantai remis and Lumut. Now there is no representation from Bidor and Pantai remis. They make donations annually at festival time. The day-to-day management of the temple is entrusted to three Nagarathar families, who hold office in 57, 59 and 61, Jalan Bandar. This temple is one of eighteen constructed by the Nattukottai Chettiars in Malaysia. =Sungai Kerawai Halt & Train Derailment by Elephant Bull= Although Sungai Kerawai Halt was one of the stops before the town of Teluk Anson, it was also here at this stop that the first railway crash of Malaya happened. While the much documented train derailment happened in 1894 along the Tapah Teluk Anson Railway line. As a result of the derailment, the night mail train which came into contact with a Bull elephant was damaged, while the Bull which was thought to have stood its ground defending its herd lay dead. A memorial sign was erected by the then railway authority. Education There are two public university branch campuses located in Teluk Intan. The campuses are Universiti Teknologi Mara Teluk Intan Campus for Faculty of Medicine UiTM completed in October 2010 and Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia Teluk Intan Campus of Faculty of Medicine UKM. Both are located beside Teluk Intan Hospital. Other higher education is currently provided by the Teluk Intan Community College (established 2001) and the Teluk Intan Hospital is used as a teaching hospital by the Universiti Kuala Lumpur Royal College of Medicine Perak.UniKL RCMP: Hospitals and Health Centres Being one of the principal towns in the Hilir Perak, Teluk Intan has over 100 primary schoolsJabatan Pelajaran Negeri Perak: Senarai Sekolah Rendah Daerah Hilir Perak and more than 20 secondary schools.Pejabat Pendidikan Hilir Perak: Sekolah Menengah Schools in established prior to the Independence of Malaya in 1957 include: *Sekolah Menengah Kebangsaan Horley Methodist (1899) *Sekolah Menengah Kebangsaan Convent (1919) *Sekolah Menengah Jenis Kebangsaan San Min *Sekolah Menengah San Min (SUWA) *Sekolah Menengah Kebangsaan St. Anthony (1932) *Sekolah Menengah Kebangsaan Sultan Abdul Aziz (1952) *SMK Seri Perak (1957) *Bethany Home Epilepsy and autism centre (1966) *SMK Raja Muda Musa, Teluk Intan There is one boarding school in Teluk Intan that is Sekolah Menengah Sains Teluk Intan and one technical school, Sekolah Menengah Teknik Teluk Intan. Local delicacies Teluk Intan 'Chee Cheong Fun' (Áå™ËÇ†Á≤â) Many Malay delicacies can be found in Teluk Intan. These include 'mee rebus' Mastan Ghani, a boiled noodle dish served with a moderately spicy and sweet gravy; a more spicy noodle dish called Mee Jawa; nasi kandar, satay, and fruit rojak. Another attraction is a beverage made of rose syrup mixed with coconut milk or milk called 'Ais Bandung'. This beverage can be found near the wet market, located on the northern riverbank. The local Chinese community has a number of delicacies as well. One of them is 'Heong Peah' (Fragrant Biscuit). Heong Peah has a crispy pastry layer outside and a sticky filling inside (also known as beleko). It contains a mixture of flour, oil, maltose, sugar, sesame, and shallots. The 'Heong Peah' market in Teluk Intan is dominated by two family- run enterprises: Sin Guan Tin and Sin Joo Heong. Locals fondly refer to the latter as the 'Tiger' brand or mark or 'Tiger Biscuit'. The former's trademark is a butterfly. Another delicacy in Teluk Intan is the 'Chee Cheong Fun', a variation of Kueh Teow containing turnip, whereas the Hong Kong Chee Cheong Fun has prawns wrapped inside. Chinese curry mee and a variety of other food can be found at \\"Glutton Square\\" located at the corner of Jalan Sithabaram Pillai and Jalan Ah Cheong. There is also a food court (locals call it \\"Bumbung Biru\\") in front of Menara Jam Condong \\"The Leaning Tower\\". Another long-standing tourist sight for more than 25 years is Teluk Intan's laksa sold from a bicycle by \\"Uncle Laksa\\". This man rides around the town areas such as Jln Woo Saik Hong, Jln Pasir Bedamar, Jln Ah Cheong and Jln Pasar to sell his trademark laksa, cooked on his custom-made 3-wheeler bicycle. Other types of foods found in Teluk Intan include western-style fast food restaurants and Japanese sushi.

Flyposted posters in Manchester, England, 2007 A fake lost- person poster advertising the second annual Treefort Music Fest in Boise, Idaho, 2013 Flyposting (also known as wild posting or bill posting) is a guerrilla marketing tactic where advertising posters are put up. In the United States, these posters are also commonly referred to as wheatpaste posters because wheatpaste is often used to adhere the posters. Posters are adhered to construction site barricades, building fa√ßades and in alleyways. Advertisement posters The posters used are typically made of a lightweight paper and printed using flexography, digital printing and screen printing. Modern printing techniques enable the posters to feature full-colour designs, halftones, and photographs, making them popular for advertising concerts, political messages, commercial advertisements and special events. An increasing number of posters do not advertise anything at all and instead feature artwork, inspirational or positive messages, and religious messages. It is an advertising tactic mostly used by small businesses promoting concerts and political activist groups, but there have been occasions where international companies subcontracted local advertising agencies for flyposting jobs in order not to get caught in illegal behavior, as a form of guerrilla marketing. In 2004, Sony Music and BMG were threatened with anti- social behaviour orders by Camden Borough Council for illegal flyposting. Legislation In many countries, it is illegal to place such posters on private property without the consent of the property owner, or to post on public property without a sign permit from the local government. Some areas, however, have public bulletin boards where notices may be posted. In an effort to discourage illegal flyposting, surfaces at risk of it are sometimes permanently signed Post No Bills (USA), No Flyposting (UK), or in France D√©fense d'afficher - loi du 29 juillet 1881, referring to a law. While flyposting is commonplace, it is often viewed as a nuisance by landlords and they can take civil action to protect their property rights. A particularly noteworthy incident of this type occurred in Boston, Massachusetts. In the case of the 2007 Boston Mooninite Scare, advertisers had placed electronic signboards without notifying local authorities, prompting a costly reaction by the Boston Police Bomb Squad when the signs were mistaken for bombs. Web banner With the rise of the world wide web, much of advertising has been shifted online. Some advertising agencies have drawn similarities between flyposting and certain types of adware, which are more invasive to consumers.

It is the capital of Kinta District.Upgrade In 2021 Of Batu Gajah Municipal Council Etymology The name Batu Gajah ('batu' is stone and 'gajah' is elephant in the Malay language), is presumably derived from two large boulders that resembled elephants found along the Kinta River. Folklore claims that huge elephant figures were made of stones to scare away the elephants that destroyed the villagers' sugar cane crops. History Famous for its tin mining long before the Independence Day of Malaya, Batu Gajah District Office Batu Gajah had been an ideal place for Chinese immigrants to stay and work during those years. This contributes to a significant percentage of Chinese in the population of Batu Gajah today. The Indian Settlement village at Changkat has a large Indian population of Tamils and also Punjabis who built one of the oldest Sikh temples in Perak. Batu Gajah had an established pre-war British English school, which was renamed Sultan Yussuf School (SYS) after the war. The Sultan of Perak DYMM Sultan Azlan Muhibbuddin Shah Ibni Almarhum Sultan Yussuf Izzuddin Shah Ghafarullahu-lah is an alumnus of this school. Formerly known as the Government English School (GES), it was founded by Mr. Malai Perumal Pillay in 1907. The school was built from the rubble of an old jail. Over the years, it has produced many successful students. Clearwater Sanctuary Golf Resort Clubhouse Batu Gajah since lies on the bank of Sungai Kinta, a little downstream from the major confluence of Sungai Raya. It started out as one of the many villages of mukim Sungai Terap, developed under its titular chief, the Sri Amar DiRaja, the early 19th century.  Features  The attractions here include two golf courses, Kinta Golf Club and Clearwater Sanctuary Golf Course, and nearby pre-independence castle built by a Scottish rubber plantation owner, Sir William Kellie Smith: Kellie's Castle. There are many hawker stalls and restaurants serving food such as noodles, laksa, and Indian-Muslim mee goreng and mee rebus. Youths spend time at cybercaf√©s and around the local supermarket. In recent years, Western style food franchises such as 7-Eleven, KFC, Marry Brown, OldTown White Coffee and Pizza Hut opened branches in the town. A supermarket named TF has opened and is in business. Development In recent years, Batu Gajah has seen a lot of improvement. In September 2012, Zhuzhou Electric Locomotive Co. Ltd., one of the major electric locomotive manufacturers in China, agreed to build a rolling-stock factory in Batu Gajah. Transport Batu Gajah railway station In 2007, Batu Gajah received a new Batu Gajah railway station. Near Kampung Pisang at the southern end of town, it replaced the old station at Jalan Pusing which is being turned into a museum and then foodstalls. In addition, the Malaysian railroad operator, Keretapi Tanah Melayu, is constructing a new central workshop in the vicinity of Batu Gajah to replace its facility in Sentul. Located near the new railway station, the centre will house repair workshops, training facilities and staff quarters. The center was scheduled for completion in August 2009 at a projected cost of RM 430 million.Keretapi Tanah Melayu Infrastructure Development in Batu Gajah A new four-lane highway connects to the Ipoh-Lumut Highway at Seputeh and ties to the North‚ÄìSouth Expressway at Gopeng.

A collateral contract may be between one of the parties and a third party. It can also be epitomized as follows: a collateral contract is one that induces a person to enter into a separate \\"primary\\" contract. For example, if X agrees to buy goods from Y that will, accordingly, be manufactured by Z, and does so on the strength of Z's assurance as to the high quality of the goods, X and Z may be held to have made a collateral contract consisting of Z's promise of quality given in consideration of X's promise to enter into the main contract with Y.  Elements of a valid collateral contract  A party to an existing contract may attempt to show that a collateral contract exists if their claim for a breach of contract fails because the statement they relied upon was not held to be a term of the main contract. It has been held that for this to be successful, the statement must have been promissory in nature.J J Savage & Sons Pty Ltd v Blakney (1970) 119 CLR 435. Remedies may be awarded for breach of a collateral contract. = Promissory in nature = A collateral contract is one where the parties to one contract enter into or promise to enter into another contract. Thus, the two contracts are connected and it may be enforced even though it forms no constructive part of the original contract. In JJ Savage and Sons Pty Ltd v Blakney a mere expression of opinion was held insufficient to be satisfied as a promise. In Crown Melbourne Limited v Cosmopolitan Hotel (Vic) Pty Ltd a statement by a landlord made to intending tenants when negotiating a lease that they would be ‚Äúlooked after at renewal time‚Äù, would not bind the landlord to offer a further five year lease.Crown Melbourne Limited v Cosmopolitan Hotel (Vic) Pty Ltd [2016] HCA 26. = Intention to induce = The promisor must have expressly or impliedly requested about the main contract and his promissory statement must have intended to induce the entry of the other party into the main contract.JJ Savage & Sons Pty Ltd v Blakney (1970) 119 CLR 435. According to Lord Denning MR, a collateral contract is held binding \\"when a person gives a promise, or an assurance to another, intending that he should act on it by entering into a contract'.Evans & Sons Ltd v Andrea Merzario Ltd [1976] 1 WLR 1078. = Consistency = A collateral contract, if forged between the same parties as the main contract, must not contradict the main contract. That is, if the term was agreed upon prior to the completion of the formal contract (but was still included as a term, and could not be executed until completion of the second term), the first term will still be allowed.Hoyt's Pty Ltd v Spencer (1919) 27 CLR 133. Essentially the collateral contracts cannot contradict any element of the main contract nor the rights created by it.Hoyt's Pty Ltd v Spencer (1919) 27 CLR 133; see also Jacobs v Batavia & General Plantations Trust Ltd [1924] 1 Ch. 287.  Letter of credit  A theory sustains that is feasible to typify letter of credit as a collateral contract for a third-party beneficiary because letters of credit are prompted by the buyer‚Äôs necessity and in application of the theory of Jean Domat the cause of a letter of credit is that a bank issue a credit in favor of a seller to release the buyer of his obligation to pay directly to the seller with legal tender. There are in fact three different entities participating in the letter of credit transaction: the seller, the buyer, and the banker. Therefore, a letter of credit theoretically fits as a collateral contract accepted by conduct, or in other words, an implied-in-fact contract.Letter of Credit, its Relation with Stipulation for the Benefit of a Third Party it is shortly called as LOC  Exception to other legal rules  = Privity of contract = Collateral contracts are an exception to the privity of contract doctrine,Shanklin Pier Ltd v Detel Products Ltd (1951) 2 KB 854. which provides that a contract cannot impose obligations or confer rights on a non-contracting party. However, in circumstances where a collateral contract is established between a third party and one of the contracting parties, the Court may allow rights or impose obligations on the non-contracting party, as illustrated in the earlier tortious case of Donoghue v Stevenson.Donoghue v Stevenson [1932] AC 562. = Parol evidence rule = Common law recognises collateral contract as an exception to parol evidence rule, meaning that admissible evidence of a collateral contract can be used to exclude the operation of the parol evidence rule. Practically, it is rare to find collateral contract as an exception as it must be strictly proved; and the burden of proof is only eased if the subject matter with which the main contract deals is more unusual.Heilbut, Symons & Co v Buckleton [1912] UKHL 2.  Notable cases  In the English case of Barry v Davies, it was held that an auctioneer and a buyer had formed a collateral contract.Barry v Davies t/as Heathcote Ball & Co [2001] 1 All ER 944; [2000] 1 WLR 1962 It was held that even though the main contract does not involve the auctioneer, benefits given to the auctioneer for increasing the price of a bid constitutes a good consideration. In Hoyt's Pty Ltd v Spencer, a landlord has promised orally not to exercise the right to termination in the principal contract if tenant signed the contract; landlord ended up terminating the main contract, whereas tenant's appeal was dismissed by the Court.

It is a member of the General Assembly of Unitarian and Free Christian Churches, the umbrella organisation for British Unitarians. Its present minister is Cody Coyne. History Cross Street Chapel c.1835 The Act of Uniformity 1662 imposed state control on religion by regulating the style of worship in the Church of England. However, many clergy rejected the restrictions, and of the 2000 ministers who were ejected from the established church, Henry Newcome established his own congregation that same year. The \\"Dissenters' Meeting House\\" was opened in 1694 and holds a special place in the growth of nonconformism within the city. In 2012, the chapel became the first place of worship to be granted a civil partnership licence when the law changed in England. During the construction of Manchester Metrolink's second city crossing in the City Zone, 270 bodies from what used to be the chapel's graveyard had to be exhumed and reburied. The work took place from 2014‚Äì17. The Chapel The building was renamed the Cross Street Chapel and became a Unitarian meeting-house c.1761.Shercliff WH Manchester: A Short History of its Development, Municipal Information Bureau, Town Hall, Manchester (1960) It was wrecked by a Jacobite mob in 1715, rebuilt and destroyed during a World War II air raid in December 1940.

Polynomials with this property are called Hurwitz stable polynomials. The Routh-Hurwitz theorem is important in dynamical systems and control theory, because the characteristic polynomial of the differential equations of a stable linear system has roots limited to the left half plane. Thus the theorem provides a test for whether a linear dynamical system is stable. The Routh‚ÄìHurwitz theorem was proved in 1895, and it was named after Edward John Routh and Adolf Hurwitz. Notations Let f(z) be a polynomial (with complex coefficients) of degree n with no roots on the imaginary line (i.e. the line Z = ic where i is the imaginary unit and c is a real number). Let us define P_0(y) (a polynomial of degree n) and P_1(y) (a nonzero polynomial of degree strictly less than n) by f(iy)=P_0(y)+iP_1(y), respectively the real and imaginary parts of f on the imaginary line. Furthermore, let us denote by: * p the number of roots of f in the left half-plane (taking into account multiplicities); * q the number of roots of f in the right half-plane (taking into account multiplicities); * \\\\Delta\\\\arg f(iy) the variation of the argument of f(iy) when y runs from ‚àí‚àû to +‚àû; * w(x) is the number of variations of the generalized Sturm chain obtained from P_0(y) and P_1(y) by applying the Euclidean algorithm; * I_{-\\\\infty}^{+\\\\infty}r is the Cauchy index of the rational function r over the real line. Statement With the notations introduced above, the Routh‚ÄìHurwitz theorem states that: :p-q=\\\\frac{1}{\\\\pi}\\\\Delta\\\\arg f(iy)= \\\\left.\\\\begin{cases} +I_{-\\\\infty}^{+\\\\infty}\\\\frac{P_0(y)}{P_1(y)} & \\\\text{for odd degree} \\\\[10pt] -I_{-\\\\infty}^{+\\\\infty}\\\\frac{P_1(y)}{P_0(y)} & \\\\text{for even degree} \\\\end{cases}\\\\right\\\\\\\\} = w(+\\\\infty)-w(-\\\\infty). From the first equality we can for instance conclude that when the variation of the argument of f(iy) is positive, then f(z) will have more roots to the left of the imaginary axis than to its right. The equality p ‚àí q = w(+‚àû) ‚àí w(‚àí‚àû) can be viewed as the complex counterpart of Sturm's theorem. Note the differences: in Sturm's theorem, the left member is p + q and the w from the right member is the number of variations of a Sturm chain (while w refers to a generalized Sturm chain in the present theorem). Routh‚ÄìHurwitz stability criterion We can easily determine a stability criterion using this theorem as it is trivial that f(z) is Hurwitz-stable iff p ‚àí q = n. We thus obtain conditions on the coefficients of f(z) by imposing w(+‚àû) = n and w(‚àí‚àû) = 0.

Originally designed by Jack Kirby for the Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. serial in Strange Tales #135 (August 1965), the Helicarrier concept has survived multiple redesigns while rarely straying from its originally depicted role as a mobile headquarters of S.H.I.E.L.D. until recent years. Fictional history In the Marvel Universe context of the various Nick Fury/S.H.I.E.L.D. series, the original design is attributed to a co-operative effort by Tony Stark, the mutant inventor Forge, and Reed Richards. According to one account in Amazing Fantasy vol. 2, #10, the first Helicarrier was proposed by Stark Industries as a political compromise among the signatories of the treaty in response to fears that any nation hosting the Directorate's main headquarters would be subject to attack by organizations such as HYDRA, with domestic political fallout sure to follow immediately thereafter. Over twenty Helicarriers have been built over the decades, and at least two have been in simultaneous service in the last decade on several occasions. The following have been identified by name thus far in various Marvel Universe publications: * Luxor ‚Äì Not yet seen.

After Iron Man replaced Maria Hill as Director of S.H.I.E.L.D., he designed a new class of Helicarrier whose red and gold design resembles the Iron Man Armor. Hill called it Helicarrier Gold, but Stark considered it The Helicarrier. This helicarrier was severely damaged and crashed by the Red Hulk, and subsequently commandeered by the Intelligencia (the covert operation of evil super-geniuses that employed the Red Hulk), who renamed it the \\"Hellcarrier\\". The main S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier is subsequently disabled by a computer virus unleashed by a Skrull agent posing as Edwin Jarvis, as part of the Secret Invasion. It lands in the Bermuda Triangle. Most of the staff are revealed to be Skrulls. The craft is destroyed by Maria Hill.Secret Invasion #3 (August 2008) It is not yet known what criteria S.H.I.E.L.D. uses to name its Helicarriers. S.H.I.E.L.D.'s replacement agency, H.A.M.M.E.R., has decommissioned the surviving Helicarriers,Invincible Iron Man #17 (November 2009) with three of them ‚Äî including the Iliad and the Argonaut ‚Äî being stolen by Nick Fury.Secret Warriors #4-5 (July‚ÄìAugust 2009) H.A.M.M.E.R. subsequently commissioned at least one new carrier to Norman Osborn's specifications, which was destroyed over Broxton, Oklahoma, during the Siege of Asgard. According to intel gathered by Livewires, 5 Helicarriers are known to have been wrecked,Livewires #4 (July 2005) though this data is out of date as several more have been lost since.

Helicarrier Circe has employed some necromancers as part of its personnel as seen when they jam Nico Minoru's spells.Avengers Undercover #4 Other versions =Marvel NOW= In the epilogue of issue #25 of New Avengers, circa the year 1968, Howard Stark (father of Tony Stark, aka Iron Man), is seen giving Colonel Nick Fury of S.H.I.E.L.D. the hard sell of his newly designed Hellicarrier.New Avengers, Issue #25, Johnathan Hickman and Kev Walker =Ultimate Marvel= The Ultimate Universe deals with Helicarriers differently. Whereas on Marvel's Earth-616 is implied that S.H.I.E.L.D. (a United Nations Task Force) only has a handful of Helicarriers in operation, in the Ultimate Universe, S.H.I.E.L.D. is depicted as a United States-operated military organization and is shown to have dozens of carriers, some even replacing retired conventional aircraft carriers like the USS Constellation. The engines that keep the carrier aloft were designed by Tony Stark and were modular enough to be used in a space shuttle by the Ultimate Fantastic Four. These \\"Ultimate Universe\\" Helicarriers generally seem to be smaller than the Earth-616 versions, and have a more conventional aircraft carrier shape, but are far more plentiful. In Ultimate Avengers Vs New Ultimates #4, Nick Fury reveals that Hank Pym was the one who conceived and designed the Helicarriers.Ultimate Avengers Vs New Ultimates#4 In other media =Television= * The S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier appears in the Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends episode \\"Mission: Save the Guardstar\\". * The S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier also appears in Spider-Man: The Animated Series. Besides being the S.H.I.E.L.D. headquarters, it also served as a prison for high-risk individuals, such as the Chameleon. It was eventually destroyed by Electro. * Another version of the S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarrier appears in the final episode of X-Men Evolution. * A version of the Helicarrier appears in The Super Hero Squad Show, and serves as the base of operations for the Super Hero Squad. It is usually piloted by S.H.I.E.L.D. leader Ms. Marvel, who reluctantly allowed the Squad to move in. Since then, it has been nearly destroyed on two occasions. * The Helicarrier was featured in the Iron Man: Armored Adventures episode \\"Technovore\\", but instead of propellers keeping it aloft, it has jet engines (designed by Howard Stark). * S.H.I.E.L.D. Helicarriers appear in the animated series The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes. * The Helicarrier appears in Ultimate Spider-Man. In season 1, it served as the training area for Spider-Man's team.The Helicarrier also functioned as a headquarters and prison equipped with specially designed cells for supervillains. In the season finale, \\"Rise of the Goblin\\", the Helicarrier is destroyed by Green Goblin and crashes. It was also revealed that Power Man, Iron Fist, Nova, and White Tiger lived on the Helicarrier. In season 2 episode, \\"The Man-Wolf\\", the Helicarrier is rebuilt as the more versatile Tri-Carrier which can divide into three different ships: an Astro-Carrier (a space variant of the Helicarrier), an Aqua-Carrier (an underwater variant of the Helicarrier), and a Strato-Carrier (the central component). In the season finale, \\"Ultimate\\", Green Goblin salvages the Helicarrier as his \\"Hell-Carrier\\" as part of his plot to use Goblin Gas to turn everyone into Goblins. In the end, Green Goblin self- destructs the Hellcarrier in order to get it out of the Tricarrier's tractor beam. In the season 3 episode, \\"Agent Venom\\", S.H.I.E.L.D. has Agent Venom kept on the Tri-Carrier so that Nick Fury can have the latest young superheroes reside there, only to be moved to the Triskellion in \\"New Warriors\\" and \\"S.H.I.E.L.D. Academy\\". In the season 4 episode, \\"Hydra Attacks\\", Doctor Octopus uses one of his miniature Octo-Bots to hack into Swarm's nanites where it starts rebuilding the Tri-Carrier as HYDRA Island. The Tri-Carrier was eventually destroyed when Scarlet Spider sacrifices himself to stop Hydra Island. * The S.H.I.E.L.D. Tri-Carrier appears in the Avengers Assemble episode \\"Bring On the Bad Guys\\". The Avengers apprehend Red Skull and have him incarcerated on the Tri-Carrier. It is hijacked by the Cabal. After the Cabal gets away, it is revealed that they stole the special prison that is holding Hyperion. Nighthawk was also incarcerated there in season 2 until Hyperion busted him out. It made its final appearance after Ultron tries to ground the Helicarrier but ultimately was defeated by Iron Man. * The Helicarrier from Marvel's The Avengers (2012) makes a flashback appearance in the episode \\"Scars\\" on the second season of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.. After being alluded to throughout the season as \\"Theta Protocol\\", the episode reveals that Phil Coulson used his position and resources as Director of S.H.I.E.L.D. to secretly repair and maintain the Helicarrier for use in a grave world emergency as it later is in Sokovia during the events of Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015). Additionally, portions of the Helicarrier battle from Captain America: The Winter Soldier appeared in a newscast Coulson was watching in a season two episode. The Helicarrier makes a cameo appearance during the series finale, \\"What We're Fighting For\\". =Film= The Helicarrier as depicted in Marvel's The Avengers. * The first live-action incarnation of the Helicarrier appeared in the 1998 TV-movie Nick Fury: Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. * Several of S.H.I.E.L.D.'s Helicarriers appear in the animated film Ultimate Avengers. They are destroyed by a trio of Chitauri vessels. * The Helicarrier appears in films of the Marvel Cinematic Universe specifically based on the Ultimate Marvel version in terms of appearance. ** The Helicarrier shown in Marvel's The Avengers (2012) has two stacked carrier decks, has a hull number of 64, and has optical camouflage capabilities. The Helicarrier was designed by Nathan Schroeder , Nathan Schroeder's design gallery for The Avengers, modeled and animated by Industrial Light and Magic, but both ILM and Weta Digital collaborated on the Helicarrier attack sequence The hull number may be referencing the former USS Constellation. ** In Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014), Hydra, which had secretly embedded itself within S.H.I.E.L.D. from its founding, plans to initiate Project Insight, in which three next-generation Helicarriers linked to spy satellites will be poised to kill all people it deems to be threats. These Helicarriers feature several improvements from the one seen in Marvel's The Avengers, most notably the addition of battleship-sized guns and repulsor engines designed by Tony Stark. All three are destroyed when Captain America, Falcon, and Maria Hill reprogram their targeting systems to fire on each other, one of which slams into the Triskelion before exploding and sinking into the Potomac. **In Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015), the original Helicarrier is used by Nick Fury and the remnants of S.H.I.E.L.D. to help the Avengers evacuate citizens of Sokovia from an airborne chunk of a city lifted by Ultron. Fury states that he \\"pulled her out of mothballs\\", which is later elaborated on in the Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. television series where Phil Coulson and his new iteration of S.H.I.E.L.D. repaired the Helicarrier under the project name \\"Theta Protocol\\". *In Deadpool, produced by 20th Century Fox, a decommissioned Helicarrier, found in a scrapyard is used as a setting for the final battle. It is not identified onscreen by that name however due to rights issues with Disney/Marvel Studios which at the time hadn't bought out most of Fox's film and TV assets including the X-Men, Fantastic Four and Deadpool until 2019. =Video games= * The Helicarrier is one of the main locations in the game Marvel: Ultimate Alliance.

Novy Mir mainly published prose that approved of the general line of the Communist Party. In the early 1960s, Novy Mir changed its political stance, leaning to a dissident position. In November 1962 the magazine became famous for publishing Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn's groundbreaking One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich, a novella about a prisoner of the Gulag. In the same year its circulation was about 150,000 copies per a month. The magazine continued publishing controversial articles and stories about various aspects of Soviet and Russian history despite the fact that its editor-in-chief, Alexander Tvardovsky, facing significant political pressure, resigned in February 1970. With the appointment of Sergey Zalygin in 1986, at the beginning of perestroika, the magazine practised increasingly bold criticism of the Soviet Government, including figures such as Mikhail Gorbachev. It also published fiction and poetry by previously banned writers, such as George Orwell, Joseph Brodsky and Vladimir Nabokov.

Officially opened on 9 March 1984, it has a 17-floor office tower and a seven- storey shopping mall with a basement. Developed by Parkway Holdings, the company sold the building to Asia Pacific Investment Company in 2000. The mall is managed by Lendlease. History Parkway Parade Shopping Centre Parkway Parade was developed by Parkway Holdings and was completed in December 1983. At that time of completion, it was one of the first suburban shopping malls in Singapore. It featured many major tenants setting up their stores in the suburbs for the first time, such as Isetan, Marks and Spencer, Yaohan Best, children's department store Small World and MPH Bookstores. It also featured a wide array of food choices, including Chuck'E'Cheese, Hardees', and Petite Park. The mall also had an amusement centre occupying Levels 3 and 4 (Funland) and a playground at Level 7, which was the largest mall playground in Singapore at that time. In 2000, the property was sold to Asia Pacific Insurance Company, and subsequently Lendlease was appointed to manage the mall. The mall commenced its first makeover in March 2002 and was completed in two phases. The first phase included a new tenant mix, to reflect the positioning of the mall. This included anchor tenant, Giant, occupying nearly half of the third floor. The mall's second phase was completed in November 2003, with a brand-new and expanded food court at the Basement floor and an alfresco-dining area on the first floor. It also included the completion of the 'Waterfall' leisure and dining precinct with one of the country's tallest glass waterfall, a water play area, six food and beverage outdoor kiosks and a restaurant.

Every Thursday night, a fixed population want to go have fun at the El Farol Bar, unless it's too crowded. * If less than 60% of the population go to the bar, they'll all have more fun than if they stayed home. * If more than 60% of the population go to the bar, they'll all have less fun than if they stayed home. Everyone must decide at the same time whether to go or not, with no knowledge of others' choices. Paradoxically, if everyone uses a deterministic pure strategy which is symmetric (same strategy for all players), it is guaranteed to fail no matter what it is. If the strategy suggests it will not be crowded, everyone will go, and thus it will be crowded; but if the strategy suggests it will be crowded, nobody will go, and thus it will not be crowded, but again no one will have fun. Better success is possible with a probablistic mixed strategy. For the single-stage El Farol Bar problem, there exists a unique symmetric Nash equilibrium mixed strategy where all players choose to go to the bar with a certain probability, determined according to the number of players, the threshold for crowdedness, and the relative utility of going to a crowded or uncrowded bar compared to staying home. There are also multiple Nash equilibria in which one or more players use a pure strategy, but these equilibria are not symmetric. Several variants are considered in Game Theory Evolving by Herbert Gintis. In some variants of the problem, the players are allowed to communicate before deciding to go to the bar. However, they are not required to tell the truth. Based on a bar in Santa Fe, New Mexico, the problem was created in 1994 by W. Brian Arthur. However, under another name, the problem was formulated and solved dynamically six years earlier by B. A. Huberman and T. Hogg.\\"The Ecology of Computation\\", Studies in Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence, North Holland publisher, page 99. 1988. Minority game A variant is the Minority Game proposed by Yi-Cheng Zhang and Damien Challet from the University of Fribourg.D. Challet, M. Marsili, Y.-C. Zhang, Minority Games: Interacting Agents in Financial Markets, Oxford University Press, Oxford (2005) An odd number of players each must make a binary choice independently at each turn, and the winners are those players who end up on the minority side. As in the El Farol Bar problem, no single (symmetric) deterministic strategy can give an equilibrium, but for mixed strategies there is a unique symmetric Nash equilibrium (each player chooses with 50% probability), as well as multiple non-symmetric equilibria. A multi-stage, cooperative Minority Game was featured in the manga Liar Game, in which the majority was repeatedly eliminated until only one player was left. Kolkata Paise Restaurant Problem Another variant of the El Farol Bar problem is the Kolkata Paise Restaurant Problem, named for the many cheap restaurants where laborers can grab a quick lunch, but may have to return to work hungry if their chosen restaurant is too crowded. Formally, a large number N of players each choose one of a large number n of restaurants, typically N = n (while in the El Farol Bar Problem, n = 2, including the stay-home option). At each restaurant, one customer at random is served lunch (payoff = 1) while all others lose (payoff = 0). The players do not know each others' choices on a given day, but the game is repeated daily, and the history of all players' choices is available to everyone. Optimally, each player chooses a different restaurant, but this is practically impossible without coordination, resulting in both hungry customers and unattended restaurants wasting capacity. Strategies are evaluated based on their aggregate payoff and/or the proportion of attended restaurants (utilization ratio). A leading stochastic strategy, with utilization ~0.79, gives each customer a probability p of choosing the same restaurant as yesterday (p varying inversely with the number of players who chose that restaurant yesterday), while choosing among other restaurants with uniform probability. This is a better result than deterministic algorithms or simple random choice (noise trader), with utilization fraction 1 - 1/e ‚âà 0.63. In a similar problem, there are hospital beds in every locality, but patients are tempted to go to prestigious hospitals out of their district. However, if too many patients go to a prestige hospital, some get no hospital bed at all, while additionally wasting the unused beds at their local hospitals.

Although only commanding around 50 adherents in its early days, the Church was instrumental in forming the link in the popular imagination between Stonehenge and Druids - despite the efforts of archaeologists to discourage the connection. In 1924 the Office of Works permitted the Church to scatter the ashes of cremated former members at Stonehenge, something which drew significant protests from the Society of Antiquaries, the Wiltshire Archaeological Society, the Royal Archaeological Institute and famous archaeologists such as O. G. S. Crawford. The outcry persuaded the government to withdraw permission and in 1932 the Church officially moved its rites from the monument to Normanton Gorse nearby. After the Second World War, Reid's son Robert took over leadership of the Church and it was able to regain midsummer access to Stonehenge throughout the 1950s, 60s and 70s, to the dismay of many leading archaeologists. When the growing Stonehenge free festival caused the monument to be closed at midsummer in 1985, the Church faded into obscurity, but has maintained a presence at the re-opened solstice festivities since 2000.

Whether you have read the terms or not is irrelevant, and in a sense, using the ticket is analogous to signing the document. This issue is an important one due to the proliferation of exclusion clauses that accompany tickets in everyday transactions. The case of Parker v. The South Eastern Railway Co (1877) 2 CPD 416 illustrates restrictions on this concept: * Knowledge of writing and of terms: If the recipient of the ticket knew that there was writing on the ticket and also knew that the ticket contained terms, then the recipient is bound by the terms of the contract. * Reasonable person: If the recipient did not know of the existence of the terms, then the court will consider whether a reasonable person would have known that the ticket contained terms. If that is so, then the ticket-holder is bound by those terms; if not, then the court will return to the general test of whether reasonable notice of the terms was given. The test of whether a document fits within the description of a ticket is an objective test, that is, whether a reasonable person in the position of the ticket-holder would perceive it to be contractual in nature. For instance, if exclusion clauses accompany a docket, it may be held that it is not contractual in nature since it is just a receipt. Furthermore, Interfoto Picture Library Ltd v. Stiletto Visual Programmes Ltd [1989] 1 QB 433 held that if a party wishes to incorporate onerous terms into a document that is to be just accepted by the other party, reasonable notice must be given to make it a term of the contract.

The clerk is responsible for recording the discernment which a meeting for worship for church affairs has reached, in a minute, and is responsible for sending and receiving correspondence on behalf of the meeting. Within some branches of the Religious Society of Friends, the clerk may also create an agenda and may facilitate the meeting. Friends record minutes contemporaneously, with each minute written in the meeting for worship for church affairs. At the end of each item, the clerk will present a draft minute, ask the meeting if they accept the minute, and the final minute will only be recorded when all Friends present feel that the minute is an accurate record of what has happened. When members of the meeting accept the minute, they will nod their heads or say \\"approve\\", or \\"hope so\\" in Britain. In some Quaker groups, there may be more than one person performing clerking roles, for example the role of facilitating the meeting may be separate from recording minutes. In this case different names may be given to the different clerks - e.g. co-clerk, recording clerk, presiding clerk, assistant clerk, reading clerk, epistle clerk, correspondence clerk. Some Friends groups, particularly ones who do not have regular minuted meetings for worship for business may have some of the roles usually carried out by a clerk carried out by a correspondent (who is responsible for sending and receiving correspondence on behalf of the meeting) or a convenor (who is responsible for bringing people together for a meeting - this is a term often used for someone who co-ordinates a committee). In Quaker meetings, there are often committees and temporary working groups that perform duties and oversee activities of the meeting.

It is the northern section of State Route 2, which continues south as Kwinana Freeway and Forrest Highway. Along its length are interchanges with several major roads, including Graham Farmer Freeway and Reid Highway. The southern terminus of the Mitchell Freeway is at the Narrows Bridge, which crosses the Swan River, and the northern terminus is at Hester Avenue, Clarkson, a suburb within the City of Wanneroo. Planning for the route began in the 1950s, and the first segment in central Perth was constructed between 1967 and 1973. The Mitchell Freeway has been progressively extended north since then. In the 1970s, the first two extensions were completed, up to Hutton Street in Osborne Park. By the end of the 1980s, the freeway had reached Ocean Reef Road in Edgewater. The Joondalup railway line was constructed in the freeway median in the early 1990s. This necessitated the relocation of a section of the southbound carriageway, and the construction of three new bridges. In conjunction with these works, additional lanes were constructed in the realigned section. Since the 1990s, extensions to the Mitchell Freeway have taken it to Burns Beach Road at the northern edge of Joondalup. During 2013, two sections of the northbound carriageway were widened with an additional lane. In August 2017, an extension was completed to Hester Avenue, after construction starting in 2014. Further works are planned, which will take the freeway past Yanchep and Two Rocks to the boundary of the Perth Metropolitan Region. Route description Mitchell Freeway southbound through Perth to the Narrows Bridge (where it becomes Kwinana Freeway) The Mitchell Freeway is the northern section of State Route 2. It commences at the northern end of the Narrows Bridge, Perth, continuing from Kwinana Freeway, and terminates just north of the satellite city of Joondalup at Hester Avenue, Clarkson. All intersections with the freeway are via grade separated interchanges. The speed limit is except in central Perth, where the limit is reduced to as the freeway interchanges with Graham Farmer Freeway and Mounts Bay Road. South of Hepburn Avenue, the freeway has 3 to 5 lanes in each direction. From that point north, there are mostly two lanes in each direction, expanding to three lanes between Hodges Drive and Shenton Avenue. The median strip of the freeway also houses the Joondalup railway line, with all but two of the line's stations also built on the strip. Additionally, a shared pedestrian and bicycle path is built alongside most of the freeway. =Perth and West Perth= The section near the Perth city centre, within the City of Perth local government area (LGA), features many partial access interchanges. The Narrows Interchange is located just north of the Narrows Bridge, on the eastern edge of Kings Park. This is a hybrid interchange connecting the freeway with Mounts Bay Road and Riverside Drive, over a distance of . There is complete access to and from Mounts Bay Road via a standard northbound exit ramp and looped ramps for the other movements. There is a partial Y-Interchange incorporated for direct access to and from Riverside Drive via a southbound exit ramp and a northbound entrance ramp. All other traffic movements must be made via Mounts Bay Road. The Riverside Drive entrance ramp merges with the Mounts Bay Road northbound entrance ramp. The southbound exit ramp is similarly shared, before diverging for three destinations: Mounts Bay Road, Riverside Drive, and the Perth Convention and Exhibition Centre car park. The main northbound exit to Hay Street is via an access road, which begins on the Mounts Bay Road exit ramp. The access road rejoins the freeway as an outside lane on the shared Riverside Drive and Mounts Bay Road entrance ramp. The Hay Street exit ramp, a short distance later, can be accessed from the two outermost lanes. This allows the traffic entering the freeway from the ramp to continue north or exit at Hay Street without weaving. The freeway continues north-westerly for , splitting Mount Street in half, and passing under Malcolm Street. After this, it turns north-easterly for , and lines up with the city blocks between George and Elder streets, a pair of one way frontage roads. The freeway also marks the boundary between Perth and West Perth. Partial access is provided to or from all the roads that the freeway crosses over (or under in the case of Hay Street). North of Roe Street, the freeway turns north-west towards Glendalough over the course of . In this section the freeway marks the boundary between the City of Perth and City of Vincent LGAs. There is a full Y-Interchange here with Graham Farmer Freeway, which bypasses the Perth city centre via a tunnel, and provides access to Perth Airport. Combined with this interchange is a partial Y-Interchange with Charles Street. The southbound entrance ramp merges with, and northbound exit ramp diverges from, the Graham Farmer Freeway ramps. There is a traffic light controlled intersection with Newcastle Street at the northern end of these ramps. Charles Street is the start of State Route 60, an alternative route to Perth's northern suburbs and areas north of the Perth Metropolitan Region. Located in the vicinity of these interchanges are the Sutherland Street northbound entrance ramp, from West Perth, and a southbound exit ramp to both Roe Street, and Wellington Street, Perth. The Loftus Street overpass, near the northwestern end of the Graham Farmer Freeway ramps, is the edge of the City of Perth LGA; beyond this point the freeway is the boundary between West Leederville in the Town of Cambridge and Leederville in the City of Vincent. =Northern suburbs of Perth= View north of Karrinyup Road In the northern suburbs of Perth, most of the interchanges are standard diamond interchanges, and the rest are modified versions, which have ramps missing or replaced with loop ramps. The first interchange north-west of West Perth, is with Vincent Street and Lake Monger Drive. This interchange has a looped southbound entry ramp, so that Leederville Parade can join to the south side of intersection with Vincent Street and the southbound ramps. The northbound exit ramp terminates at Southport Street, south of Vincent Street and Lake Monger Drive. The freeway then proceeds northwest for alongside Lake Monger's eastern edge, after which there is a half diamond interchange with Powis Street, with only a northbound exit ramp and a southbound entrance ramp. The freeway continues north, now within the City of Stirling LGA, through Osborne Park, until it reaches Hutton Street after . There are several local roads in Osborne Park that have T-Junction intersections with the freeway ramps south of Hutton Street. These are McDonald Street West and Hector Street West, with the northbound exit ramp; and Cape Street, Hector Street, and McDonald Street with southbound entry ramps. The freeway has an S-curve after Hutton Street, moving to an alignment further west that does not bisect any suburbs. The interchanges with Cedric Street on the S-curve, and Karrinyup Road at the end of the S-curve, are diamond interchanges. There are slight modifications to the entrance and exit ramps between these roads, which merge for , requiring traffic to weave. The curved section is the boundary between Stirling to the east of the freeway, and Osborne Park and Innaloo to the west. The next interchange, after , is with Erindale Road. It is another half diamond interchange, with only northbound exit and southbound entrance ramps. Beyond Erindale Road, the suburb to the east of the freeway is Balcatta, and further north is Reid Highway, with the southbound entry ramp looped. Balcatta Road joins the intersection of the southbound ramps with Reid Highway. Reid Highway, together with Tonkin Highway, provides a limited-access route to Perth Airport. North of Reid Highway, Mitchell Freeway divides Carine to west from Hamersley to the east. There is no access to next major road, Beach Road. It forms the border between the City of Stirling and City of Joondalup LGAs; as well as between Carine and Duncraig west of the freeway, and Hamersley and Warwick to the east. However, Warwick Road's interchange is only north of Reid Highway. It is a standard diamond interchange, but weaving is required between Reid Highway and Warwick Road due to the short distance between the interchanges. Greenwood is located north of Warwick Road and east of the freeway. View south of Moore Drive The following two interchanges, after and respectively, are with Hepburn Avenue and Whitfords Avenue. The Hepburn Avenue interchange is located at the corners of Duncraig, Greenwood, Kingsley, Western Australia, and Padbury; while the Whitfords Avenue interchange is located at the corner of Kingsley, Padbury, Cragie, and Woodvale. Each interchange also provides access for the railway stations in the median (Greenwood and Whitfords respectively) via the southbound entry ramps, which are two-way north of the carparks' entrances. North of here, over a distance of , are standard diamond interchanges with Ocean Reef Road, Hodges Drive, and Shenton Avenue, which provide access to Joondalup city centre, and Joondalup Health Campus, east of the freeway. West of the freeway are the suburbs of Heathridge, Connolly and Currambine. The Edgewater railway station lies just to the north of the Ocean Reef Road interchange (road access via Joondalup Drive), with the railway deviating to the east from the median just south of Hodges Drive to stop at Joondalup railway station. After north of the Shenton Avenue interchange, the railway line re-enters the freeway median just prior to passing under Moore Drive. Both the freeway and railway line then pass over Burns Beach Road, further north with the Currambine railway station lying to the south. The diamond interchange with Burns Beach Road is the northernmost fully signalised interchange on the freeway and lies at the corner of Currambine, Joondalup, Kinross and Neerabup. The next interchange, after , is with Neerabup Road and is a hybrid interchange where the western side is a teardrop roundabout common to dogbone interchanges while the eastern side is a full roundabout similar to a dumbbell interchange. The latter is due to the southbound entry ramp being built with a second roundabout to the south. Although currently unused, it is likely to be used as access to any future parking at Clarkson railway station immediately to the north of the interchange (similar to the setups at the Hepburn and Whitfords Avenue interchanges). The current freeway terminus is reached north at Hester Avenue at a partial dogbone interchange. Until the freeway is extended, access to areas further north is provided by Marmion Avenue to the west of the terminus, or via Wanneroo Road to the east. History Narrows Interchange under construction, c. 1968 The Mitchell Freeway began as a highway proposed in the Metropolitan Region Scheme in the mid-1950s. The original plan took the route, then known as Yanchep Highway, inland from what is now known as Karrinyup Road to the intersection of Wanneroo Road and Balcatta Road. However, the first gazetted edition of the Metropolitan Region Scheme, from 1963, shows a controlled-access highway along the current freeway alignment. The later plan only detailed the route up until a point east of Sorrento, at a proposed east- west controlled-access highway on the modern day Hepburn Avenue alignment. Detailed design on the first stage of the freeway, from the Narrows Bridge to Sutherland Street at the northern edge of the city, began in 1960, and took several years to be completed. The design included a complex interchange at the Narrows Bridge that was to be built on reclaimed land that was mostly soft mud. Ground improvement works, which included the installations of 43,000 sand drains, began in 1964; demolition of buildings in the freeway's path commenced in 1965. The freeway was completed in three sections, under three separate contracts. Construction on the central section from Mount Street to Wellington Street started on 18 November 1966, following a groundbreaking ceremony conducted by Premier David Brand. It was opened to traffic two years later, connected to the Narrows Bridge via a temporary Bailey bridge over Mounts Bay Road. The new road carried up to 1400 vehicles per hour during peak hours. Work on the section north of Wellington Street, known as the Hamilton Interchange, began in October 1969. It was partially opened on 17 November 1971, but was not completed until 4 October 1972. The final part of the project to be completed was the Narrows Interchange. Construction began in 1970 with the installation of thirteen caissons, which would house foundation columns. Placement of the caissons was difficult; as well as sinking vertically as intended, they also tilted and slid horizontally. Corrections were made by selective excavation, blasting bedrock, and applying tension via guy-wires. Following the foundation works, construction proceeded swiftly; most of the work was completed by 1972. Premier John Tonkin opened the interchange on 30 November 1973. This initial section functioned only as a distributor for Narrows Bridge traffic accessing Perth's central business district or adjacent areas to the north-west. Whilst initially referred to as the \\"Western Switch Road\\", it was renamed after the former Western Australia State Premier and Governor Sir James Mitchell, on 5 June 1963. In 2008, Stage 1 was declared a National Engineering Landmark by Engineers Australia as part of its Engineering Heritage Recognition Program. Several stages were built through the late 1970s, 1980s and early 1990s. The first extension of the freeway was nearly a mile long (), taking the freeway to Vincent Street. This stage also included a long, curving bridge, eight-span bridge connecting northbound traffic to Charles Street. The construction of this stage, which began in February 1974, resulted in the suburb of Leederville being split in two. Residential and industrial buildings were demolished, and streets were cut off on both sides of the freeway's path. The extension opened to traffic on 8 March 1976, having cost $15.15 million. It was opened by the state Minister for Transport, Mr R J O‚ÄôConnor, MLA. A commemorative plaque was located under the bridge leading to Charles Street.Western Roads: official journal of the Main Roads Department, Western Australia, 1(2), p.2. Perth: Main Roads Department. The design of Stage 3 of the freeway, a section extending to Hutton Street, was completed in 1974. The existing soil was not suitable for construction, as the area generally consisted of soft peat and old landfills. In 1975, the ground was consolidated with of sand. Construction took place between 1976 and 1978, with the section opened by the Minister for Transport, David Wordsworth, on 2 June 1978. A commemorative plaque was unveiled at the Powis Street bridge.Mitchell Freeway ‚Äì stage III (August 1978). Western Roads: official journal of the Main Roads Department, Western Australia, 3(3), p.11. Perth: Main Roads Department. This stage cost $12.5 million, and received the Institution of Engineers Australia's Western Australian Division Engineering Excellence Award in 1978. After a four-year gap, construction of Stage 4 began, which would take the freeway to Erindale Road. The first half of the stage, up to Karrinyup Road, opened on 12 December 1983, while the project wasn't complete until 21 September 1984. It was opened by the state Minister for Transport Julian Grill, MLA. This section completed of freeway in Perth, from Bull Creek to Balcatta.Freeway project advances (April 1985). Western Roads: official journal of the Main Roads Department, Western Australia, 10(1), p.18. Perth: Main Roads Department. The next two stages were constructed together, extending the freeway to Hepburn Avenue. Stage 5 was from Erindale to Warwick Road, and involved excavating a large quantity of material, including of limestone. That stage cost $22.73 million, while Stage 6 only cost $8.06 million. Both stages were opened together, on 6 August 1986. The first stage of Reid Highway (then known as the North Perimeter HighwayMaps show \\"North Perimeter Highway\\" on the current Reid Highway alignment: * * ) was built at the same time, and opened on 16 May 1986. A further extension to Ocean Reef Road was opened on 2 July 1988 by the Federal Minister for Transport, Peter Morris,Tribute to freeway (October 1988). Western Roads: official journal of the Main Roads Department, Western Australia, 13(3), p.1. Perth: Main Roads Department. at a cost of $17.5 million. The state and federal governments provided most of the funds, $9.7 million and $5.2 million respectively. The City of Wanneroo contributed $1.3 million, Joondalup Development Corporation $1 million, and land developers $300,000, as they wanted the freeway built ahead of schedule to stimulate local development. The Joondalup railway line in the freeway median In 1991 and 1992, the median strip of the entire freeway was significantly widened to accommodate the Joondalup railway line, being built under the Northern Suburbs Transit System project. The line was to be located in the middle of the road reserve, between the freeway carriageways. At the time, the northbound and southbound carriageways, between Loftus Street and McDonald Street, were positioned next to each other, with space for future widening located on the eastern side of the road reserve. Accessed at J S Battye Library, Perth Initially, three new road bridges were constructed over Vincent Street, Powis Street, and Scarborough Beach Road. Once the road bridges had been completed and surfacing works completed, the southbound carriage was relocated, creating the required space for the railway line construction. Additional lanes were constructed in the realigned section, funded from regular road funding sources, whilst the bridges and some associated works were included as part of the costs for the Northern Suburbs Transit System project. Mitchell Freeway Extension: work in progress at Moore Drive, Joondalup (May 2007) After a 7-year-hiatus, a extension to Hodges Drive was opened by the Premier Richard Court in December 1999, two months ahead of schedule. The project also included widening the section between Karrinyup Road and Hepburn Avenue to three lanes in each direction. After another 7-year-hiatus, construction began on a 4-kilometre extension to Burns Beach Road, with a diamond interchange at Shenton Avenue and an overpass for Moore Drive. Local residents were opposed to aspects of the initial plans, such as the design of a section near a primary school and the clearing of native vegetation. The state government therefore established the Community Consultative Working Group and later the Construction Reference Group, composed of members of the local community. The input from these groups resulted in several changes to the design. The project was managed by Main Roads in conjunction with Macmahon Contractors. Construction of the extension was initially planned for May 2006, but began on 14 December 2006. By July 2008, 90% of the works had been completed and the new section was predicted to open in September 2008. However, the official opening was not until 2 November 2008, when the road was opened by Western Australia's Minister for Transport, Simon O'Brien, and the previous Minister for Planning and Infrastructure Alannah MacTiernan. The $160 million project was completed $10 million under budget.Main Roads, Western Australia, Annual Report 2009. Perth: Main Roads, Western Australia, 2009, p. 9 The opening was celebrated with a procession of vintage cars along the new freeway segment. In its 2011/12 budget, the State Government committed $30 million for the widening of Mitchell Freeway northbound between Hepburn Avenue and Hodges Drive from two to three lanes. Traffic volumes in the preceding years had increased rapidly, almost reaching the previously projected 2016 traffic volume of 40,000 vehicles per day. The resulting congestion in the afternoon traffic peak increases the chances of rear-end crashes as well as driver frustration. Construction of the third lane began in February 2013, the section from Hepburn Avenue to Ocean Reef Road opened in August 2013 with the remaining section to Hodges Drive completed in early 2014. As part of the project, the existing lanes were resurfaced during the summer months of 2013‚Äì14. The freeway was also expanded further during 2013 with an extra lane northbound between Perth and Hutton Street, in conjunction with works to increase the capacity of the Graham Farmer Freeway tunnel. Works progressed in two stages, with Vincent Street as the midpoint. As part of the project, the overpasses at Powis Street, Vincent Street and Scarborough Beach Road have been widened. An additional slip lane has been constructed, from Graham Farmer Freeway's Loftus Street exit ramp to Mitchell Freeway northbound, to access Vincent Street without changing lanes to the left lanes of Mitchell Freeway northbound. The project commenced in February 2013 and was completed in December 2013. In October 2012 the state government announced that the freeway's interchange with Reid Highway will be upgraded with the installation of extra turning lanes and traffic lights. The project is an interim solution to lower congestion and reduce the volume of traffic using local roads to avoid the interchange. The longer term plan is to upgrade Reid Highway to a dual carriageway near the freeway interchange, including a second overpass bridge, and a second free-flowing loop ramp between Reid Highway westbound to Mitchell Freeway northbound. The dual carriageway works commenced construction in May 2015 and were completed a year later. The latest extension was from Burns Beach Road to Hester Avenue. In December 2012, the State Government announced the freeway would be extended between 2014‚Äì15 and 2016‚Äì17, over a distance of . The extension included interchanges at Burns Beach Road and Neerabup Road. Work on the extension began with a ground-breaking ceremony on 20 May 2015. The projected cost was $261.4 million, with the federal government contributing $209.1 million and the state government funding the remaining $52.3 million. The project scope included a dual carriageway extension to Hester Avenue, Clarkson, with grade-separated interchanges at Burns Beach Road, Neerabup Road and Hester Avenue. Other roads in the area were upgraded, including widening Hester Avenue and Wanneroo Road, and extending Neerabup Road east to the intersection of Flynn Drive and Wanneroo Road. The project was completed on 3 August 2017, opened by Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, Premier Mark McGowan and Transport Minister Rita Safiioti. Future works =Widening= The southbound section of the freeway between Cedric and Vincent Streets is currently being widened to four lanes and is expected to be completed by the end of 2019. $40 million was assigned to the freeway widening itself, with a further $19 million allocated for the upgrade and completion of a Principal Shared Path (PSP) between Scarborough Beach Road and Hutton Street, including a separated pedestrian and cyclist overpass over the former. The bridge for the overpass was notoriously delivered during peak hour on 11 September 2019, causing a traffic jam for southbound commuters. The corresponding northbound section from Hutton to Cedric Street is also being widened to four lanes, with the northbound exit lane onto the latter also being widened to two lanes. of concrete barriers are also planned to be installed between Glendalough Station and Erindale Road. Work is expected to commence in October 2019 and finish by September 2020. There is a longer term plan to add a third lane to the southbound carriageway of the freeway from Hodges Drive to Hepburn Avenue. The Australian Federal Government has already committed $35 million to the project. =Extensions= The Mitchell Freeway is planned to continue north to the Metropolitan Region Scheme's boundary, beyond Yanchep and Two Rocks. The state government announced in March 2012 the formation of the Mitchell Freeway Extension Community Working Group. The group worked with Main Roads Western Australia to investigate options for relieving congestion, with a focus on the next freeway extension. Several options were considered, before the group released a strategic business case in November 2012. The report recommends a staged approach, starting with intersection improvements between 2013 and 2015. This was followed by a freeway extension to Hester Avenue in 2017. An expressway standard extension to Romeo Road, Alkimos is proposed to be completed by 2021. =Interchange upgrades= There is a plan to extend Stephenson Avenue northbound from its current terminus with Scarborough Beach Road to terminate at Cedric Street as part of the Stirling City Centre development project. An additional interchange will be built to the south of Cedric Street to accommodate the extension. Interchanges The entire freeway is in the Perth Metropolitan Region.

Perkins joined CBS affiliate WUSA in Washington, D.C. for six weeks, beginning October 21, 2019, for the station's morning show, Get Up DC!, which became a full-time assignment when he was named full-time anchor of the show in January 2020.  Early life and education  Perkins was born on August 25, 1959 in New York City to Constance Bellamy (1938-2018) and Tommy Perkins (d. 1992). His parents had met when his father was working at a shoe store in New York. Together, the family lived in the South Bronx until moving to Washington, D.C., when he was five years old. His parents divorced when he was 11, and his mother worked as a telephone operator and night clerk to raise the family. He attended elementary school in Washington, D.C., junior high in Maryland and Virginia, and graduated from Mount Vernon High School in Alexandria, Virginia in 1977. In high school, Perkins had a good academic record and was involved in many extracurricular activities, including becoming the first black editor-in-chief of his school's student newspaper. He received his Bachelor of Arts degree from American University's School of Communication in 1981. There, he worked with the campus radio station and the black student newspaper, and helped found the campus television station. Perkins comes from a line of family members involved in the radio business, including his father, who had worked at WOL and WOOK, and his uncle, who worked at WFIL as a radio engineer. Perkins has a younger brother, Scott, who worked as an art director for CNN.  Career  Before becoming a journalist, Perkins was a professional stand-up comedian from 1983 to 1993, appearing at clubs and colleges across the country, which helped him meet and come to work for Donnie Simpson as an off- air producer. He had also been working in radio for Cathy Hughes at WOL. Throughout his career, Perkins has continued to support his alma mater and is an active member of the American University School of Communication's Dean Council. = Television = Perkins began his broadcast career as a desk assistant for the ABC News Washington, D.C. bureau in the early 1980s. From 1986 to 1988, he hosted and produced DC20 Breakaway for WDCA. From 1993 to 1998, he served as a weather forecaster at Fox station WTTG in Washington, D.C. and co-anchored the station's Fox Morning News from 1998 to 1999. After six years at WTTG, Perkins joined ABC's Good Morning America on March 8, 1999 as the program's weekday morning weather forecaster and features reporter, where his catchphrase to turn it over to the local weather was \\"the weather in your neighborhood.\\" He succeeded Spencer Christian on Good Morning America, who had moved to San Francisco to become a weather anchor for KGO-TV in 1999. During Perkins's time together with Robin Roberts, Diane Sawyer, and Charles Gibson, they were able to help Good Morning America bounce back in its television ratings against its morning show competitors after it experienced a slump in the mid-to-late-1990s. Perkins also co-hosted \\"Stealing Scenes,\\" an entertainment-focused show for ABC News Now. In 2004, Perkins made a cameo on the ABC sitcom, Less than Perfect. That same year, he was also invited onto Jimmy Kimmel Live! as a guest. On December 2, 2005, Perkins left Good Morning America to return to WTTG and was succeeded by Mike Barz. During his second stint on WTTG, Perkins continued as morning weather anchor and gradually transitioned to become the main anchor for the weekday morning newscast alongside Allison Seymour in July 2012. He was later transferred to the evening 5:00PM newscast with Laura Evans and 10:00PM newscast with Shawn Yancy on October 28, 2013. On January 19, 2019, Perkins departed WTTG to spend more time on his radio commitments. On October 21, 2019, he joined CBS affiliate WUSA in Washington, D.C. for six weeks to be a part of the station's Get Up DC! morning show, together with Reese Waters and Annie Yu. On January 7, 2020, just under a year after he left WTTG, it was announced that Perkins was returning to WUSA to anchor Get Up DC! full-time. The assignment allows him to continue hosting his radio show on WMMJ in the afternoons.http://www.ftvlive.com/sqsp-test/2020/1/8/toldja = Radio = From 1985 to 1992, while working as a comic, Perkins also served as a writer, producer, and on-air contributor to The Donnie Simpson Show on WKYS-FM. He later co-hosted The Morning Crew on WKYS-FM from 1992 to 1993. Perkins was an occasional in-studio guest on the Don and Mike Show, and its successor, the Mike O'Meara Show. From 2014 to 2018, he also hosted his own weekly comedy and entertainment podcast with co-host Gary Stein, the Tony Perkins Show featuring Gary Stein. On December 18, 2017, Perkins announced that he would be returning to WMMJ-FM 102.3 Majic with Donnie Simpson as the afternoon drive host for a reboot of The Donnie Simpson Show on weekdays from 3:00PM to 7:00PM. To accommodate the schedule, he moved his anchoring schedule on WTTG from weeknight evenings to Friday and Saturday morning shows. = Awards and accomplishments = Perkins earned an Emmy Award in 1988 for his work on DC20 Breakaway. He has also earned an additional Emmy Award.  Personal life  Perkins is married to Rhonda Perkins, who worked as a social services administrator, and has a son named Connor.

In 2003, he led the Hanshin Tigers to their first Central League pennant in 18 years before retiring for health reasons. In 2007, he managed the Japanese national team for the 2008 Beijing Olympics. In October 2010 Hoshino was hired as manager of the Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles. He led the Eagles to a Pacific League pennant and Japan Series championship in 2013. Childhood Hoshino was born the third of three children in Kurashiki, Japan. His father died three months after he was born, and his mother raised him and his two sisters alone. He played baseball throughout his high school years, but was unable to advance to the Koshien baseball tournament. He entered Meiji University, and became a starter from his first year. He marked 23 total wins in the Tokyo Big6 Baseball League, including one no-hitter, but his team never won the league championship. Hoshino's reputation as a hot-headed leader began in his years at Meiji University, when he and other members of the baseball team banded together to break down a barricade set up around the school by a student protest group. Playing career Hoshino was drafted in the first round by the Chunichi Dragons in 1968, led by manager Shigeru Mizuhara. The Yomiuri Giants had promised Hoshino that he would be their first round draft pick, but the Giants broke their promise, drafting another player instead. This betrayal made Hoshino develop a profound hatred towards the Giants, and he has battled the Giants ever since, both as a pitcher and as a manager. Hoshino signed with the Dragons in 1969, and pitched both as a starter and reliever, quickly becoming the ace of the Dragons pitching staff. He led the league in saves in 1974, and won the Eiji Sawamura Award. More importantly, however, his team won the league championship, stopping the Yomiuri Giants record of consecutive league championships at 9. He was known as the \\"Kyojin Killer\\" (Giants Killer) because he seemed to pitch unusually well against the Giants. His team won another league championship in 1982, and Hoshino retired after that year. His career record was 146‚Äì121, with 34 saves. Hoshino was an extremely popular figure during his career, not because of his skill as a pitcher, but because of his persona. Baseball fans were sick of seeing the Yomiuri Giants win the championship year after year, and Hoshino's outspoken hatred of the Giants finally gave fans a player to root for beside Shigeo Nagashima and Sadaharu Oh. Hoshino stayed with the Dragons for his entire career, and was very well respected by his teammates. Managerial career Hoshino worked as a commentator for NHK after retiring, and his popularity with both fans and players called him back to the Chunichi Dragons as a manager in 1987. Hoshino made a number of big trades, and led the Dragons to a league championship in 1988. He stepped down in 1991, and returned to his job as a commentator and sports writer. The Dragons did poorly after Hoshino's departure, and he was once again called back to lead the team in 1996. Hoshino won his second league championship in 1999, but stepped down again after his team placed fifth in 2001. In 2002, Hoshino was called to take over as manager of the Hanshin Tigers, who had been in last place for the last four years under Katsuya Nomura. He raised the team to fourth place in his first year, and made huge cuts during the off-season while recruiting free agents like Tomoaki Kanemoto and Hideki Irabu. The Tigers won the Central League championship in 2003; Hoshino's third pennant as manager. However, he frequently fell ill during games in 2003, often leaving the head coach to manage the team while he sat quietly on the bench. He stepped down after the 2003 Japanese championship series due to health reasons, allegedly due to high blood pressure and heart arrhythmia, but was the assistant senior director of the Hanshin Tigers until 2010. In 2007, he became the manager of the Japan national baseball team, which won the Asian Baseball Championship (the qualifier for the Beijing Olympics) defeating the Philippines, Korea, and Taiwan. However, the \\"Hoshino Japan\\" finished with a 4‚Äì5 record in the 2008 Beijing Olympics with no medals. After the Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles decided to let Marty Brown go after the first year of a two-year contract, Hoshino was brought on to manage the team and signed to a one-year, ¬•150 million contract for the 2011 season. After a fifth-place PL finish and the positive development of the team's younger players, team owner Hiroshi Mikitani requested that Hoshino stay on as manager for the next few seasons. In the 2013 season, the Eagles' ninth, he went on to lead the team to its first PL pennant, first successful Climax Series run, and first Japan Series title. The following season, however, the Eagles finished in last place and Hoshino announced that he would step down as manager. His managerial tenure remains the team's longest. Death Hoshino died of pancreatic cancer in Tokyo on January 4, 2018 at the age of 70.

The value of 3[5]2 is about 7.626 √ó 1012; values for higher x are much too large to appear on the graph. In mathematics, pentation (or hyper-5) is the next hyperoperation after tetration and before hexation. It is defined as iterated (repeated) tetration, just as tetration is iterated exponentiation.. It is a binary operation defined with two numbers a and b, where a is tetrated to itself b times. For instance, using hyperoperation notation for pentation and tetration, 2[5]3 means tetrating 2 to itself 3 times, or 2[4](2[4]2). This can then be reduced to 2[4](2^2)=2[4]4=2^{2^{2^2}}=2^{2^4}=2^{16}=65536. Etymology The word \\"pentation\\" was coined by Reuben Goodstein in 1947 from the roots penta- (five) and iteration. It is part of his general naming scheme for hyperoperations.. Notation There is little consensus on the notation for pentation; as such, there are many different ways to write the operation. However, some are more used than others, and some have clear advantages or disadvantages compared to others. *Pentation can be written as a hyperoperation as a[5]b. In this format, a[3]b may be interpreted as the result of repeatedly applying the function x\\\\mapsto a[2]x, for b repetitions, starting from the number 1\\\\. Analogously, a[4]b, tetration, represents the value obtained by repeatedly applying the function x\\\\mapsto a[3]x, for b repetitions, starting from the number 1, and the pentation a[5]b represents the value obtained by repeatedly applying the function x\\\\mapsto a[4]x, for b repetitions, starting from the number 1... This will be the notation used in the rest of the article. *In Knuth's up-arrow notation, a[5]b is represented as a \\\\uparrow \\\\uparrow \\\\uparrow b or a \\\\uparrow^{3}b. In this notation, a\\\\uparrow b represents the exponentiation function a^b and a\\\\uparrow \\\\uparrow b represents tetration. The operation can be easily adapted for hexation by adding another arrow. *In Conway chained arrow notation, a[5]b = a\\\\rightarrow b\\\\rightarrow 3.. *Another proposed notation is {_{b}a}, though this is not extensible to higher hyperoperations.http://www.tetration.org/Tetration/index.html  Examples  The values of the pentation function may also be obtained from the values in the fourth row of the table of values of a variant of the Ackermann function: if A(n,m) is defined by the Ackermann recurrence A(m-1,A(m,n-1)) with the initial conditions A(1,n)=an and A(m,1)=a, then a[5]b=A(4,b).. As tetration, its base operation, has not been extended to non-integer heights, pentation a[5]b is currently only defined for integer values of a and b where a > 0 and b ‚â• ‚àí1, and a few other integer values which may be uniquely defined. As with all hyperoperations of order 3 (exponentiation) and higher, pentation has the following trivial cases (identities) which holds for all values of a and b within its domain: * 1[5]b = 1 * a[5]1 = a Additionally, we can also define: * a[5]0 = 1 * a[5](-1) = 0 Other than the trivial cases shown above, pentation generates extremely large numbers very quickly such that there are only a few non-trivial cases that produce numbers that can be written in conventional notation, as illustrated below: * 2[5]2 = 2[4]2 = 2^2 = 4 * 2[5]3 = 2[4](2[4]2) = 2[4]4 = 2^{2^{2^2}} = 2^{2^4} = 2^{16} = 65,536 * 2[5]4 = 2[4](2[4](2[4]2)) = 2[4](2[4]4) = 2[4]65536 = 2^{2^{2^{\\\\cdot^{\\\\cdot^{\\\\cdot^{2}}}}}} \\\\mbox{ (a power tower of height 65,536) } \\\\approx \\\\exp_{10}^{65,533}(4.29508) (shown here in iterated exponential notation as it is far too large to be written in conventional notation.

With a capacity of 8,256, it is near the city centre, just over a mile from York railway station. York City leased land at Bootham Crescent from York Cricket Club as a replacement for their ground at Fulfordgate on the outskirts of the city. The ground was constructed in four months, and opened on 31 August 1932. In the Second World War, the Popular Stand was converted into an air-raid shelter, and the ground suffered slight damage when a bomb landed on houses along the Shipton Street End. York purchased Bootham Crescent for ¬£4,075 in 1948. Floodlights were fitted at the ground in 1959, and replaced by ones twice as powerful in 1995. A number of improvements were made in the early 1980s, with a gymnasium, offices and a lounge for officials built. The David Longhurst Stand opened in 1991 after a roof was erected on the Shipton Street End, named after the former York player David Longhurst who died during a match at the ground in 1990. Bootham Crescent hosted Football League matches from 1932 to 2004 and from 2012 to 2016, both spells ending after York were relegated into non-League football. The ground was renamed KitKat Crescent from 2005 to 2010 as part of a sponsorship deal with Nestl√©. York are expected to move to a community stadium at Monks Cross in Huntington in mid 2019, and the Bootham Crescent site will be used for housing. Bootham Crescent comprises four stands: the Main Stand, the Popular Stand, the David Longhurst Stand and the Grosvenor Road End. The ground has held a league representative match, neutral club matches, and schoolboy and youth international matches. Other than football, it has hosted a concert, firework display, American football and rugby league matches and beer festivals. The record attendance of 28,123 was set in March 1938, for an FA Cup match against Huddersfield Town. The highest seasonal average attendance of 10,412 was achieved in 1948‚Äì49. History =Construction and early years= York City F.C. played at Fulfordgate in Fulford, on the southern outskirts of York, from 1922 to 1932. It was difficult for most supporters to reach, being a good distance from the railway station, and the tram service to Fulford only had a single track. Attendances declined in the club's second and third seasons in the Football League, which the directors blamed on Fulfordgate's location. One director, G. W. Halliday, became convinced that the only solution was to move to a new ground. York Cricket Club left Bootham Crescent, their home for around 50 years, for a new ground at Wigginton Road in January 1932. Preliminary discussions and visits to Bootham Crescent took place, and the directors believed that renting the ground would be cheaper than repaying the debts on Fulfordgate. Further, Bootham Crescent was situated near the centre of the city, and the population living within a mile of the site was, at 30,000, 10 times that within a similar radius of Fulfordgate. However, two former directors argued that attendances at many grounds had fallen during the Great Depression, and that the approaches and surrounds to Bootham Crescent were limited. 2015 Ordnance Survey map, showing the ground's irregular shape, and how it is hemmed in from four sides The directors were unanimous that a change should be made, and a special meeting of the shareholders was held on 26 April 1932. The move to Bootham Crescent on a 21-year lease was approved by 115 votes to 37. The site of York's new home was of an irregular shape and was hemmed in from four sides, with a narrow track to the south, barracks to the west, a school and almhouses to the north and terraced houses to the east. Nonetheless, the grounds of the city's football, cricket and rugby league teams were now within a few hundred yards of each other. The ground was renovated over the summer of 1932; the area was drained and then built to the design of local architects Ward & Leckenby. The Popular Stand was erected on the west side using sections of the terrace cover at Fulfordgate, with the Main Stand built opposite. Terraces were banked up in the wedge-shaped areas behind the goals. After four months of construction, Bootham Crescent was ready for the 1932‚Äì33 season, with an initial capacity of over 30,000. The ground was officially opened on 31 August 1932, when York played Stockport County in a Third Division North match. The club president, Sir John Hunt, marked the occasion by cutting a ribbon of the club's colours of chocolate and cream. In attendance were the Lord Mayor of York, the Sheriff of York, the vice-president of the Football League, the treasurer of the Football Association (FA) and the local Member of Parliament. York player Tom Mitchell scored the first goal at the ground in a 2‚Äì2 draw, played before 8,106 supporters. In the first four seasons at Bootham Crescent, attendances were not higher, and were sometimes lower than at Fulfordgate. There were problems with the ground in its early years; the quality of the pitch was questioned, and the Lincolnshire Echo remarked in April 1937 that the pitch was \\"almost a morass, with extensive pools of water in front of the goals\\". There was an incident in March 1934 where the referee and linesmen were found unconscious in their dressing room, due to fumes from a faulty heater. =Improvements and cup runs= The ground first hosted a match against First Division opposition on 12 January 1935 when York played Derby County in an FA Cup third-round match, which set a new club record attendance of 13,612. Attendance records were set at four successive stages of the 1937‚Äì38 FA Cup, culminating in the 28,123 attendance for the sixth-round match against Huddersfield Town on 5 March 1938. By now the ground's capacity was around 23,000, and seats were placed around the pitch to accommodate more fans. During the Second World War, the tunnel at the back of the Popular Stand was used as an air-raid shelter for pupils and staff of Shipton Street School. The ground was slightly damaged after the air-raid on York in April 1942, when houses along the Shipton Street End were bombed. Considerable improvements were made in the immediate post-war period. Deeper drainage and the concreting of the banking at the Grosvenor Road End were completed, and loudspeaking equipment was installed. Entrance to the ground (1992 picture), with the Main Stand visible to the left of the entrance sign It was announced at the shareholders' annual meeting in September 1948 that York had purchased Bootham Crescent for ¬£4,075, with the club's finances in a strong position at the time. Bigger crowds were recorded around the country in the post-war period, and York achieved five-figure average attendances in 1948‚Äì49 and 1955‚Äì56. Over the late 1940s and early 1950s, concreting was completed on the terracing in the Popular Stand, due to the efforts of the supporters' club, and the Shipton Street End. York reached the semi-final of the 1954‚Äì55 FA Cup, and two matches from this run were played at Bootham Crescent: the first-round match against Scarborough, which York won 3‚Äì2, and the fifth-round match against Tottenham Hotspur, which was won 3‚Äì1 before a crowd of 21,000. During the summer of 1955, the Main Stand was extended towards Shipton Street, funded by profits gained from the FA Cup run and a stand extension fund. A concrete wall was built at the Grosvenor Road End for over ¬£3,000 in 1956, as a safety precaution and as a support for additional banking and terracing. These improvements saw capacity extended to 23,600. Two FA Cup ties against First Division opposition were held at the ground in 1957‚Äì58: Birmingham City were beaten 3‚Äì0, followed by a 0‚Äì0 draw with Bolton Wanderers, which drew a capacity crowd of 23,600. Floodlights were installed at the ground in the summer of 1959, costing ¬£14,500, a substantial part of which was raised by a supporters' club. They were officially switched on for a friendly against Newcastle United on 28 October 1959, which Newcastle won 8‚Äì2 before a crowd of 9,414. =Further improvements and a new stand= York reached the quarter- final of the 1961‚Äì62 League Cup, and in the earlier rounds beat Bristol City, Leicester City, Watford and Bournemouth at Bootham Crescent. The half-time scoreboard at the Shipton Street End ceased to be used by 1965, but remained as advertising boarding. On 5 May 1969, referee Roy Harper collapsed and died on the pitch during a match against Halifax Town. Seats were installed in the Popular Stand for 1974‚Äì75, York's first season in the Second Division. This increased the ground's seating capacity to 2,762, but meant the overall capacity was reduced to 16,529. The floodlights were updated and improved for ¬£20,000, and were officially switched on by former Wolverhampton Wanderers player Derek Dougan for a friendly with Grimsby Town on 1 August 1980. A gymnasium was built at the Grosvenor Road End for ¬£50,000 early in 1981, and to help towards this York received ¬£15,000 from the Sports Council and ¬£20,000 from the Football League Improvement Trust. In the summer of 1983, new offices for the manager, secretary, matchday and lottery manager were built, along with a vice-presidents' lounge. The lounge was officially opened by Jack Dunnett, the chairman of the Football League, prior to a match against Wrexham in November 1983. By the early 1980s cracks had appeared in the wall built at the back of the Grosvenor Road End. The rear of the terracing was cordoned off, and the capacity of the ground reduced to under 13,500. The Grosvenor Road End was segregated and allocated to away supporters, and fencing was erected for the first time before the FA Cup match against Liverpool in February 1985. All the fencing had been dismantled by the early 2000s. During the 1983‚Äì84 and 1984‚Äì85 seasons, problems had arisen in handling big crowds, due to the ground having only two of four sides available for entry and exit, and the home supporters funnelling through the car park to the Shipton Street End. Extensive improvements were made in the summer of 1985 for approximately ¬£100,000, and eight new turnstiles were installed at the Shipton Street End. Further, the dressing rooms were refurbished to incorporate new baths and showers, and a new referees' changing room and physiotherapist's treatment room were readied. Hospitality boxes were built into the Main Stand during 1986‚Äì87, and video equipment was installed inside the ground. Crash barriers were strengthened, meaning ground safety requirements were met. These improvements meant that shortly before the Taylor Report was published, the ground's capacity was 14,109, including 3,059 seats. However, by September 1989, the capacity had been increased to 14,628. David Longhurst Stand (2007 picture) opened in 1990, after a stand was built on the Shipton Street End. The ground's major drawback was the lack of covered standing accommodation at the Shipton Street End, but the cost of erecting a stand had been prohibitive. The Shipton Street Roof Appeal was launched in the spring of 1988 to raise money for a stand, and fundraising schemes were put into place. On 8 September 1990, York player David Longhurst collapsed and died from heart failure during a match against Lincoln City at Bootham Crescent. With the approval of his family, the David Longhurst Memorial Fund was launched, and all donations were added to the monies already raised for the roof appeal. The Football Trust contributed half of the ¬£150,000 cost of the stand, and it was constructed in the summer of 1991. The David Longhurst Stand was officially opened on 14 October 1991 in a friendly match against Leeds United, which was watched by a crowd of 4,374. =1990s to present= The Family Stand was opened in the Main Stand in 1992, and manager John Ward ran the London Marathon to help raise funds for the project. Bootham Crescent first hosted a play-off match when York beat Bury 1‚Äì0 on 19 May 1993 in the Third Division play-off semi-final; the attendance of 9,206 was the ground's highest in seven years. During 1993‚Äì94 the Main Stand paddock was seated and covered, and the recent work to the stand cost ¬£220,000. The ground's capacity fell to 9,459, including seating for 3,645, after the renovations to the David Longhurst and Main Stands. In May 1995, a new drainage system was installed for ¬£11,000, to improve the quality of the pitch during winter. New floodlights were installed in June 1995 at a cost of ¬£122,000, and despite being shorter in height were twice as powerful as the original floodlights. A water tower was installed in the late 1990s, to further help the pitch quality. In July 1999, York's real property assets, including Bootham Crescent, were transferred to a holding company called Bootham Crescent Holdings (BCH) for ¬£165,000. Chairman Douglas Craig put the ground and the club up for sale for ¬£4.5 million in December 2001. It was announced that the ground would close by 30 June 2002, and talks were held over a move to Huntington Stadium. In March 2002, the club was bought by John Batchelor; he said York could continue at Bootham Crescent until a new stadium was built, when in fact the previous 25-year lease was replaced with one that would expire in June 2003. Batchelor spoke of building a new stadium at Clifton Moor, and Persimmon, who held 10% of the shares in BCH, submitted planning applications for 93 homes on the site of Bootham Crescent. In March 2003, York extended their lease of the ground to May 2004, and under the ownership of the Supporters' Trust proceeded with plans to move to Huntington Stadium. Planning problems arose with bringing the ground up to Football League standards, and the club preferred to stay at Bootham Crescent. York bought Bootham Crescent in February 2004, after a ¬£2 million loan from the Football Stadia Improvement Fund (FSIF) was secured. York were relegated to the Conference National for 2004‚Äì05, which brought an end to 72 years of Football League football at Bootham Crescent. In January 2005 the ground was renamed KitKat Crescent, as part of a sponsorship deal under which Nestl√© donated ¬£100,000 to the club. This money went towards covering the shortfall the club faced paying BCH directors, Persimmon and stamp duty when buying the ground. The ground was still commonly referred to as Bootham Crescent. The deal expired in January 2010, when Nestl√© ended all their sponsorship arrangements with the club. York returned to the Football League for 2012‚Äì13, and their first League Two match at Bootham Crescent was a 3‚Äì1 defeat to Wycombe Wanderers on 18 August 2012, before a 4,591 crowd. The club was relegated to the National League for 2016‚Äì17, ending a four-year spell back in the Football League. The ground has not been subject to any major investment since the 1990s, and has faced problems with holes in the Main Stand roof, crumbling in the Grosvenor Road End, drainage problems and toilet conditions. Future The terms of the FSIF loan required the club to identify a site for a new stadium by 2007, and have detailed planning permission by 2009, to avoid financial penalties. Once plans for a new stadium were in place, the loan would turn into a grant to assist in funding the relocation. As part of the loan agreement, Persimmon have first refusal on purchasing Bootham Crescent once York leave, for 10% lower than its market value. Persimmon still intend to build 93 homes on the site, and the proceeds of the sale would go towards building the new stadium. In March 2008, York's managing director Jason McGill cited \\"the annual cost of ¬£60,000 for the maintenance and upkeep of a 1932 stadium with few commercial and income-generating opportunities\\" as the reason for the continued need to move to a new stadium. Despite the club failing to formally identify a site by the end of 2007, financial penalties were not incurred, as the FSIF were satisfied with the progress made. However, McGill said plans with the preferred site had ground to a halt by March 2008. City of York Council announced its commitment to building a community stadium in May 2008, which would be used by York and the city's rugby league club, York City Knights. In July 2010, the council chose the option of building a 6,000-all- seater stadium at Monks Cross in Huntington, on the site of Huntington Stadium. In August 2014, Greenwich Leisure Ltd were named as the council's preferred bidder to deliver an 8,000-all-seater stadium, a leisure complex and a community hub. Construction started in December 2017, for completion in mid 2019. Structure and facilities Schematic plan view of Bootham Crescent's stands Main Stand in 2015 Popular Stand in 2007 David Longhurst Stand in 2008 Grosvenor Road End in 2015 The ground can accommodate 8,256 supporters, including seating for 3,409, and comprises four stands; the Main Stand, the Popular Stand, the David Longhurst Stand and the Grosvenor Road End. The Main Stand, which can seat 1,757 spectators, is an all-seated stand which runs around two-thirds of the pitch. It contains the dressing rooms, club offices, ticket offices and hospitality suites, and contains a number of supporting pillars. The stand has open corners to either side, one of which is where the supporters' club is located, and to the rear has windscreens to either side. At the front of it is the Family Stand, which offers adjusted rates for children and their carers. Opposite is the Popular Stand, a covered all-seated stand, which contains a number of supporting pillars and holds a television gantry on its roof. It can seat 1,652 spectators. The northernmost stand of the ground is the David Longhurst Stand, which is a covered terrace for home supporters and has a row of supporting pillars across its front. The stand was originally known as the Shipton Street End, but was renamed following the death of David Longhurst, and has a capacity of 3,062. Opposite is the Grosvenor Road End, an open terrace reserved for away supporters, which holds a capacity of 1,785. As well as this, away fans are permitted to use 332 seats of the Popular Stand, in the section closest to the Grosvenor Road End. The toilet facilities for away supporters consist of open air urinals and Portakabins. The grass pitch measures . Head groundsman Bryan Foster was presented with a gold watch from the directors in March 1988, in recognition of his long and outstanding service. His successor, Bryan Horner, was voted the Second Division groundsman of the year in 1999. A club shop is situated just inside the car park, which also houses the commercial manager's office. Adjoining this is the social club, known as the 1922 Bar since August 2015, and the players' bar. Transport The ground is located just over a mile from York railway station, which is approximately a 20-minute walk. The station lies on the East Coast Main Line between London King's Cross railway station and Edinburgh Waverley railway station, and has direct services from Birmingham, Liverpool, Manchester, Newcastle upon Tyne and the South West. Many of the roads near the ground are for residential permit holders only, meaning car parking at the ground is notoriously difficult. The author Simon Inglis pointed out the irony of the club leaving Fulfordgate because of its location, when \\"it is harder than ever for fans to drive in to Bootham Crescent\\". Parking on matchdays at nearby York Hospital is available. A park and ride facility operates in the city, and a number of lines drop off within walking distance of the ground. Other uses Bootham Crescent hosted a war- time representative match in which the Football League XI beat the Northern Command XI 9‚Äì2 on 17 October 1942, before a 5,500 crowd. It held a university representative match on 17 February 1976, when a FA XI drew 2‚Äì2 with the Universities Athletic Union; the FA XI included former England internationals and 1966 World Cup winners Bobby Charlton and Nobby Stiles. The ground hosted its first major neutral match on 7 February 1968, when Middlesbrough beat Hull City 1‚Äì0 in an FA Cup third-round second replay, in front of a crowd of 16,524. During 2012‚Äì13, Bootham Crescent held one fixture apiece for Harrogate Town and Gateshead, as the pitches at their grounds were unplayable. The ground hosted the 2013 FA Women's Premier League Cup Final on 5 May 2013, when Aston Villa beat Leeds United 5‚Äì4 on penalties after a 0‚Äì0 extra time draw. The ground first held international football on 10 May 1952, when England schools, captained by future York manager Wilf McGuinness, beat Ireland 5‚Äì0 before 16,000 spectators. It has hosted a number of youth international matches, most notably the England under-18's 4‚Äì0 win over Northern Ireland on 13 October 1996, in which 16-year-old Michael Owen scored a hat-trick for England. Bootham Crescent hosted three matches in the 2001 UEFA European Under-16 Championship, including France's 2‚Äì0 win over Russia in the quarter- final on 30 April 2001, watched by 557 spectators. The ground has also held non-football events. It hosted a music concert in September 1979 and a grand fireworks display in October 1982 to celebrate the centenary of the Yorkshire Evening Press. Sporting events to have taken place include an American football game in the summer of 1988, and a rugby league match between York and Leeds in the Challenge Cup before a crowd of 11,347 on 29 January 1989, which was won 28‚Äì9 by Leeds. York City Knights have played at Bootham Crescent since 2016, ahead of the move to the Community Stadium. The ground hosted baseball, an exhibition game in May 1934 and in 1937 the home fixtures of York City Maroons in the 8 team Yorkshire League. In August 2017, the ground was transformed into the 1936 Berlin Olympics stadium for filming a Bollywood film Gold (2018 film). Beer festivals, organised by the York Minstermen supporters' group, were held at the ground's social club from 2008 to 2012. Records York City's highest and average league attendances at Bootham Crescent from the 1932‚Äì33 season The highest attendance record at the ground was 28,123 for a match against Huddersfield Town in the FA Cup sixth round on 5 March 1938. The highest attendance in the Football League is 21,010 against Hull City in the Third Division North on 23 April 1949. The attendance of 1,167 against Northampton Town on 5 May 1981 is the lowest ever to see York in a Football League match. York were relegated to the Conference National in 2004, and their highest home attendance in this division was 6,660 for a match against Morecambe on 4 May 2007. The lowest was 1,567 for a match against Exeter City on 10 March 2008. The lowest attendance at the ground for any first-team fixture was 608 for a Conference League Cup third-round match against Mansfield Town on 4 November 2008. The highest seasonal average attendance for York at Bootham Crescent was 10,412 in 1948‚Äì49. York's lowest seasonal average was 2,139 in 1977‚Äì78, which came after two successive relegations from the Second Division. The most recent season in which the average attendance was more than 10,000 was in 1955‚Äì56. This season also saw York's highest total seasonal attendance at the ground, which was 236,685. Calculated by adding the home attendances figures. The lowest total seasonal attendance was 48,357 for 1977‚Äì78 in the Fourth Division. Calculated by adding the home attendances figures. York's biggest margin of victory at Bootham Crescent was by eight goals, achieved with a 9‚Äì1 win over Southport in the Third Division North on 2 February 1957. Their biggest margin of defeat at the ground was by seven goals, when they were beaten 7‚Äì0 by Rochdale in a Third Division North match on 14 January 1939.

She served as co-anchor of the NBC news program Weekend Today from 2003 to 2007, and hosted the series Campbell Brown on CNN from 2008 to 2010. Brown won an Emmy Award as part of the NBC team reporting on Hurricane Katrina. Since 2013 she has been an education reform and school choice activist. Early life and family Campbell Brown was born Alma Dale Campbell Brown in Ferriday, Louisiana, the daughter of the former Louisiana Democratic State Senator and Secretary of State James H. Brown Jr., and Brown's first wife, Dale Campbell. Alma Dale was her maternal grandmother's name. Brown was raised as a Roman Catholic,Interfaith Celebrities: \\"CNN's Intermarried Beauties and E!'s Interfaith Ingenue\\" By Nate Bloom September 6, 2007 though her father is a Presbyterian. She has two sisters. Brown grew up in Ferriday, Louisiana, and attended the Trinity Episcopal Day School. Her family was involved in hunting, politics, and cooking, \\"It was all about Cajun and tight- knit families and big parties,\\" according to Brown. She was expelled from the Madeira School for sneaking off campus to go to a party. Brown attended Louisiana State University for two years before graduating from Regis University. After graduation, she spent a year teaching English in Czechoslovakia. In her 2006 wedding announcement in The New York Times, she was described as having \\"spent her postcollege years as a Colorado ski bum.\\" Journalism career She began her career in local news reporting for KSNT- TV, the NBC affiliate in Topeka, Kansas, and then for WWBT-TV, the NBC affiliate in Richmond, Virginia, and also reported for WBAL-TV in Baltimore, Maryland, and WRC-TV in Washington, D.C. Brown joined NBC News in 1996. She was later assigned to The Pentagon and covered the war in Kosovo. Before Weekend Today, she was the White House correspondent for NBC News. =Presidential election coverage in 2000= During the 2000 U.S. presidential election, she covered George W. Bush, the Republican National Convention, and Republican party primary elections. She became the main substitute anchor for Brian Williams on the NBC Nightly News. In March 2006, Brown was named as one of five women who might replace Katie Couric when she left the Today Show. The position went to Meredith Vieira. =Move to CNN= Brown announced July 22, 2007, on Weekend Today, that she would be leaving NBC News after eleven years to devote time to her family and expected baby. CNN confirmed it had hired Brown, and that Brown would start work for CNN in February 2008 (originally November 2007), filling the spot previously held by Paula Zahn, who left the network. Brown began anchoring CNN Election Center, which ran from February through October 2008. The show was renamed Campbell Brown: No Bias, No Bull in October 2008, shortly before the election in order to ensure a smooth transition when the election was over. Roland Martin filled in as guest host in April and May 2009 while Brown took maternity leave; when she returned in June 2009, the show was renamed again to simply Campbell Brown. Departure In the face of low ratings, CNN released Brown from her contract. On May 18, 2010, Brown announced that she would be leaving CNN. She later told the Los Angeles Times that she had originally hoped that a straight news program like hers could compete successfully against the opinion-driven shows of her competitors, Bill O'Reilly and Keith Olbermann. Olbermann responded by naming Brown as a runner-up in his daily ‚ÄúWorst Person In The World‚Äù segment. Brown's last day at CNN was on July 21, 2010. Beginning on July 22, her 8:00 p.m. prime time slot was filled by a second hour of Rick Sanchez's Rick's List TV program. =Post-CNN journalism= After leaving CNN, Brown began writing opinion pieces for publications that included The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, The Daily Beast and Slate. Weekly Standard editor Bill Kristol proposed that Brown run for Charles Schumer's Senate seat. In January 2017, Facebook announced that Brown would be joining to lead the company's news partnerships team. Her title is head of global new partnerships. In 2018, The Australian newspaper reported that Brown, in a private meeting with Facebook publishing partners, told the partners that their business models would die in a hospice unless they worked with Facebook. Political activism Brown has become an outspoken advocate for school choice and \\"education reform\\". In June 2013, Brown founded the Parents Transparency Project, a nonprofit watchdog group on behalf of parents seeking information and accountability from the teachers‚Äô unions and New York Department of Education on actions impacting children in schools. The group, working with the New York Daily News, investigated and reported on school employees who were accused of sexual misconduct with children but still kept their jobs. In a January 2014 op-ed, Brown criticized teachers‚Äô unions for failing to support a bill before Congress that would require more stringent background checks for teachers. Noting that 97 tenured New York City teachers or school employees had been charged with sexual misconduct during the previous five years, she complained that while ordinary employers would exhibit zero tolerance toward such offenders, New York law required an elaborate, expensive process that involves the participation of the teachers‚Äô unions, which ‚Äúprefer suspensions and fines, and not dismissal, for teachers charged with inappropriate sexual conduct.‚Äù United Federation of Teachers vice president Leo Carey disputed Brown's account of this process and its outcome, but Mayor Michael Bloomberg agreed with Brown, saying that ‚Äúmaybe if you were a serial ax murderer, you might get a slap on the wrist.‚Äù In April 2014, Brown launched the website CommonSenseContract.com, to influence New York City's contract talks with the United Federation of Teachers. Brown stated, \\"We want the Department of Education and the United Federation of Teachers to consider the views of parents.\\" Brown has also focused on reforming teacher tenure policies through the judicial system. She wrote a number of op-eds voicing her support for the successful Vergara v. California case in 2014, which overturned California's teacher tenure, dismissal, and seniority policies. Brown called Vergara ‚Äúthe most important case you‚Äôve never heard of‚Äù, and praised the plaintiffs‚Äô efforts, saying they were ‚Äú[taking] aim at laws that go directly to the heart of a good education: the ability to have, keep, and respect good teachers and dismiss utterly failing ones.‚Äù She celebrated Vergara as ‚ÄúA historic victory for America‚Äôs kids‚Äù and previewed the national ramifications of the ruling, saying, ‚ÄúIt would be no surprise to see parents in New York and elsewhere take the cue of the Vergara plaintiffs and take matters into their own hands.‚Äù =Partnership for Educational Justice= In June 2014, Brown founded the non-profit organization Partnership for Educational Justice. In its first major endeavor, Brown's group helped nine New York families organize and file a lawsuit against New York state, challenging the state's teacher tenure, teacher dismissal, and ‚ÄúLast In, First Out‚Äù seniority statutes. In Wright v. New York, filed in New York City on July 28, 2014, the plaintiffs claim that these teacher tenure, dismissal, and seniority policies violated their children's state constitutional right to a ‚Äúsound basic education‚Äù. Brown said she hoped that taking the issue of teacher tenure reform to the courts would ‚Äúforce a new legislative process‚Äù around New York's tenure policies. In September 2014, the case was consolidated with another lawsuit challenging New York tenure laws, and now is in litigation as Davids v. New York. The case is ongoing. In May 2016, the Partnership for Educational Justice became involved in a lawsuit against Minnesota Education Commissioner Brenda Cassellius, Governor Mark Dayton, the Minnesota Department of Education and the state of Minnesota, stemming from a teacher tenure dispute in the Anoka-Hennepin School District which claims in part that Minnesota's Continuing Contract Law and Tenure Act, in particular its \\"last in, first out\\" layoff rules, is unconstitutional on the grounds that it denies students a \\"'uniform' and 'thorough' education\\". =The 74= In July 2015, Brown co-founded The 74, a non-profit, non-partisan news site covering education in America; it gets its name from the fact that there are roughly 74 million children under the age of 18 in the United States. =Facebook= In 2017 she was made the head of global news partnerships at Facebook. Other memberships Brown also serves on the boards of Success Academy Charter Schools, a New York City charter school network; Turnaround for Children, a nonprofit organization that addresses the emotional effects of poverty on children's learning environments; and the International Women's Media Foundation (IWMF).IWMF website Personal life On April 2, 2006, Brown married Daniel Samuel Senor, the former chief spokesperson for the Coalition Provisional Authority in Iraq. They had met in Iraq in March 2004, when Senor was spokesman for the Coalition Provisional Authority in Baghdad and Brown was one of the journalists covering his daily news conferences. After Senor returned to Washington in 2004, Brown called him. \\"I was wildly, wildly curious about his experience in Iraq,\\" she later said. According to the New York Times, \\"their first date was a group dinner, with Tom Brokaw and another journalist.\\" Senor and Brown married at the Beaver Creek Chapel in Beaver Creek, Colorado. Brown converted to Judaism, her husband's faith.New Jersey Jewish News: \\"Former CNN anchor recalls journey to Judaism ‚ÄòI was not supposed to go without shellfish,‚Äô jokes Campbell Brown\\" by Robert Wiener November 9, 2011 Brown had been married before, briefly, to a Washington, D.C., real estate broker. That marriage ended in divorce. On June 24, 2007, Brown announced on Weekend Today that she and her husband were expecting their first baby. On December 18, 2007, Brown gave birth to their son, Eli James Senor, named after his grandfather, James Senor. In an August 2008 article, Brown addressed charges that her marriage to Senor, who at the time was working as an advisor for the Mitt Romney presidential campaign, represented a conflict of interest for her as a journalist. Brown noted that such marriages were commonplace in Washington, with NBC reporters Chuck Todd and Andrea Mitchell married to a Democratic consultant and Alan Greenspan, respectively. On October 27, 2008, during a guest appearance on The Daily Show, Brown announced her second pregnancy. On April 6, 2009, Brown gave birth to her second son, Asher Liam Senor. In popular culture In 2012, Brown performed as a \\"broadcast journalist\\" in the play 8. Brown was portrayed by the actress and comedian Tracey Ullman in her Showtime comedy series Tracey Ullman's State of the Union, and by Kristen Wiig on Saturday Night Live.

He is most well known for his spells as a striker for Aston Villa and Norwich City, Deehan went on to manage both teams as well as a successful spell at Wigan Athletic where he won the Division Three title. Career =As a player= Born in Solihull, as a player Deehan was a striker who is best known for productive spells with Aston Villa and Norwich City. With Villa he was a member of the team that won the 1977 Football League Cup Final against Everton and was a member of the Norwich sides which won the 1985 Football League Cup Final and the Second Division championship in 1986. On 24 January 2012 he was appointed as Director of Football at League Two club Plymouth Argyle. Argyle stood at 22nd in League Two at the time of his appointment. He was a competent goalscorer from an early age, breaking the 10-goal barrier in the league for three successive seasons by the age of 22. He was initially less successful after leaving Villa Park in September 1979 to sign for Villa's local rivals West Bromwich Albion, managing just five goals from 47 league games over the next two years, but recaptured his form after joining Norwich City in December 1981 and helping them seal promotion to the First Division that season. He scored 20 league goals in his first full season at Carrow Road and managed 15 and 13 goals over the next two seasons, although he was unable to save the Canaries from relegation in 1984‚Äì85. He also helped them win the Football League Cup in 1985 and the Second Division title - and a return to the First Division as Second Division champions a year later. In 2002, Norwich fans voted Deehan into the Norwich City F.C. Hall of Fame in recognition of his contribution as a player. In the summer of 1986, he left Norwich to join Ipswich Town in a player exchange deal that saw Trevor Putney move to Carrow Road. His final season at Norwich had seen him collected a Second Division title medal, but his form was less impressive than in previous seasons with just four goals from 26 league games. From 1988 until 1990 he was player-coach at Manchester City, where he worked under the management of former Norwich assistant Mel Machin, before returning to Norwich City as Mike Walker's assistant in the summer of 1992. =Management and Coaching= He helped coach an unfancied Canaries side to a surprise third-place finish in the inaugural FA Premier League (season 1992-93), and was promoted to the manager's seat the following January when Walker moved to Everton. Norwich finished 12th in the Premiership in 1993-94 and started the following season reasonably well despite the (then) record English sale of Chris Sutton to Blackburn Rovers for ¬£5 million. Despite the loss of Sutton, and the sale of Efan Ekoku shortly afterwards, the Canaries were seventh in the Premiership by Christmas and were in contention for a UEFA Cup place. An injury to goalkeeper Bryan Gunn then sparked a dramatic loss of form, and by the time the Canaries lost 3‚Äì0 to Newcastle United on 8 April 1995, they were heading for the relegation zone. Deehan then stepped down as manager and handed the reins to his assistant Gary Megson, but Megson was unable to stave off relegation. Deehan's absence from football did not last long. He began the 1995‚Äì96 season as manager of Wigan Athletic in the Football League Third Division, and after two seasons at the helm he guided them to the Division Three title and promotion to Division Two. After safeguarding Wigan's survival in 1997‚Äì98, he accepted the assistant manager's job at Sheffield United and for one season worked under Steve Bruce. Deehan's time at Bramall Lane was unsuccessful and he resigned after the club failed to get near the Division One playoff places. After leaving Sheffield United, Deehan worked again with Steve Bruce at Huddersfield Town, in the 1999‚Äì2000 season. After leaving the Yorkshire club, he made a football comeback with Aston Villa when he was appointed assistant manager to John Gregory in July 2001. In January 2002, Deehan was named joint caretaker manager of Villa (with Stuart Gray) when Gregory resigned. He left the club when Graham Taylor was named Villa manager for the second time. In October 2003, Deehan became Director of Football at Northampton Town, with Colin Calderwood working under him as team manager. The duo were appointed to get the team promoted from the league's basement division, and achieved this aim in the 2005‚Äì06 season. Both Calderwood and Deehan left the club at the end of the 2005‚Äì06 season, with Deehan moving to Lincoln City as Director of Football. On 15 October 2007, it was confirmed that Deehan and Lincoln City manager John Schofield had left the club. In November 2007, Deehan was employed as a scout by Premier League side Bolton Wanderers who were looking for a number of former professionals to head their recruitment drive led by former Everton manager Colin Harvey. In September 2008, Deehan expressed interest in the vacant manager's post at League Two side Grimsby Town, saying: \\"I think Grimsby Town is a good club and a good opportunity for any manager. Whenever I've been to Blundell Park, I've been impressed with the set-up and the positive approach to football.\\" Despite his interest Deehan failed to land the Grimsby job, which was given to Mike Newell. On 21 January 2009, he was appointed as Chief Scout of Norwich City Football Club in part of the new management team alongside three of his former players ‚Äì Bryan Gunn as First Team Manager, Ian Crook as first team coach and Ian Butterworth as Assistant Manager. In December 2009, Deehan became Lee Harper's assistant at Kettering Town but was controversially sacked later that month immediately following a 5‚Äì1 defeat to Leeds United in an FA Cup second-round replay where his choice of substitutions during extra time were blamed for the defeat. On 17 March 2010, he was announced as Head of Recruitment (Director of Football) at Grimsby Town in order to work with manager Neil Woods and his assistant Chris Casper. It was touted that Deeham would be a possible replacement for Woods if the club are relegated from the Football League. However, after the conclusion of the 09/10 season, which eventually brought relegation Deehan's contract was not renewed and he left the club 20 May 2010. On 25 January 2012, Deehan was appointed Director of Football at Plymouth Argyle. At the end of the 2012‚Äì2013 season he left the club. He teamed up with Stuart Gray again early in 2014, joining the coaching staff at Sheffield Wednesday.

After his defeat, he stood again for Parliament unsuccessfully on several other occasions: in Westminster at the 1874 general election, in Western Essex at the 1880 general election and at the by-elections in Northern Norfolk in 1876 and 1879. He was appointed High Sheriff of Norfolk in 1876. When Buxton was appointed governor, the Premier of South Australia, Charles Kingston was angry that the South Australian government had not been involved in the decision about who should be the new governor, so made life as hard as possible for Buxton and his family. The governor's allowance was reduced and customs duty was charged on their household items (including his wife's invalid carriage). Buxton took up the job anyway, and later was described as the most genial, sociable and common-sense governor, due to his gentle and unassuming friendliness. He visited gaols and hospitals, and showed genuine interest in Aboriginal culture during his time as governor. He eventually returned to England due to the ill-health of his wife.

A Dictionary of Phonetics and Phonology. London: Routledge, p. 296. prosthesis (from Ancient Greek ' 'addition'), is the addition of a sound or syllable at the beginning of a word without changing the word's meaning or the rest of its structure. A vowel or consonant added by prothesis is called prothetic or prosthetic. Prothesis is different from the adding of a prefix, which changes the meaning of a word. Prothesis is a metaplasm, a change in spelling or pronunciation. The opposite process, the loss of a sound from the beginning of a word, is called apheresis or aphesis. Word formation Prothesis may occur during word formation from borrowing from foreign languages or the derivation from protolanguages. =Romance languages= A well-known example is that + stop clusters (known as '), in Latin, gained a preceding in early Romance languages (Old Spanish, Old French)., ' [Romance Linguistics], Vol. 1, Berlin, 1956, pp.64‚Äì65 Thus, Latin ' changed to Spanish and French , (in which the s was later lost) \\"state\\"/\\"been\\", and Latin ' changed to Spanish and Old French ' (Modern French ' and Italian speciale). =Turkic languages= Some Turkic languages avoid certain combinations of consonants at the beginning of a word. In Turkish, for instance, Smyrna is called ƒ∞zmir, and the word , borrowed from French, becomes Turkish . Similarly, in Bashkir, a prosthetic vowel is added to Russian loanwords if a consonant or a consonant cluster appears at the beginning: \\"rye\\" from Russian , \\"table\\" from Russian , \\"bench\\" from Russian , etc. However, Bashkir presents cases of novel prothesis in terms that are inherited from Old Turkic: \\"falcon\\" from Old Turkic laƒç√Øn, \\"dew\\" from Old Turkic ƒç√Øq. =Samoyedic languages= In Nenets, Enets and Nganasan, prothesis of a velar nasal before vowels has occurred historically: the Nenets words \\"road\\", \\"bow\\" are cognate with Hungarian √∫t, √≠j with the same meaning. In some varieties of Nenets, the rule remains productive: the initial syllable cannot start with a vowel, and vowel-initial loanwords are adapted with prothetic . =Hindi= Hindi words from English have an initial i before sp-, sk- or sm-: school ‚Üí iskuul, special ‚Üí ispesal. =Persian= In Persian, loanwords with an initial sp-, st-, sk- or sm- add a short vowel e at the beginning: spray ‚Üí esprey, stadium ‚Üí estadiun, Stalin ‚Üí Estalin, skate ‚Üí eskeyt, scan ‚Üí eskan etc. Persians learning Polish thus pronounce smacznego (bon app√©tit) as esmacznego. =Slavic languages= During the evolution from Proto-Slavic, words in various Slavic languages gained prosthetic consonants: Russian okno (\\"window\\") vs. Ukrainian vikno or Belarusian vakno. Also, Polish wƒÖtroba (\\"liver\\") and Russian utroba (\\"womb\\", \\"entrails\\") changed from Proto-Slavic «´troba.Paul V. Cubberley, \\"Russian: A Linguistic Introduction\\" (2002) , p.35, books.google.com =Semitic languages= Semitic languages regularly break up initial two-consonant clusters by adding a prothetic vowel. The vowel may be preceded by the glottal stop / î/ (see aleph) or, in Hebrew, /h/, which may be pronounced or simply written. Because of the triconsonantal root morphology of Semitic languages, the prosthetic vowel may appear regularly when the first two consonants of the root lack an intermediate vowel, such as in verb conjugation; Arabic  ºaktubu (I write) from the verb kataba (root ktb). In Hebrew in nouns of Greek origin, such as Aplaton (Plato), etztadion (\\"stadium\\"). Consonant mutation =Celtic languages= Welsh sometimes features h-prothesis only for vowel-initial words. It occurs in words after ' (her), ' (our) and ' (their): ' (age) ' (her age). It also occurs with ' (twenty) following ar (on) in the traditional counting system: ' \\"one on twenty\\" (twenty-one). =Swiss German= Swiss German features n-prothesis if a word ends with a vowel and the next word begins with a vowel. A dropped final n was originally retained then, but the process now occurs in contexts in which n never existed. A similar process called intrusive-r occurs in some varieties of English. Sandhi A prothetic vowel performs external sandhi in Italian: compare ' (\\"the school\\") vs. ' (\\"at school\\"). It is, therefore, conjectured both that the origins of the Romance prothesis are phonetical, rather than grammatical. Prothesis originally broke consonant clusters if the preceding word ended in a consonant. There was no prothesis in the Romance dialects that had lost their terminal consonants.Richard D. Janda & Brian D. Joseph, \\"Reconsidering the Canons of Sound-Change: Towards a ‚ÄúBig Bang‚Äù Theory\\", in \\"Historical Linguistics 2001.

(2003), pp. 205‚Äì219 Second language Phonetic rules of a native language may influence the pronunciation of a second language, including various metaplasms. For example, prothesis is reported for Crimean Tatars when they speak Russian.\\"Crimean Tatar-Russian as a Reflection of Crimean Tatar National Identity\\", iccrimea.org James L. Barker writes: \\"If an Arab, an East Indian, a Frenchman, Spaniard, or Italian is given the following sentence to read: I want to speak Spanish, he reads it in the following manner: I want to speak (i)/(e)Spanish.

Born to the Roman Catholic branch of the B√°thory family, he was closely related to four rulers of the Principality of Transylvania (a vassal state of the Ottoman Empire which had developed in the eastern territories of the medieval Kingdom of Hungary). His father, Stephen B√°thory, held estates in the principality, but never ruled it. Being a minor when his father died in 1601, Gabriel became the ward of the childless Stephen B√°thory, from the Protestant branch of the family, who converted him to Calvinism. After inheriting his guardian's most estates in 1605, Gabriel became one of the wealthiest landowners in Transylvania and Royal Hungary (a realm of the Habsburg Empire which included the northern and western parts of medieval Hungary). Gabriel made an alliance with the Hajd√∫sirregular troops stationing along the borders of Transylvania and Royal Hungaryand laid claim to Transylvania against the elderly prince, Sigismund R√°k√≥czi in February 1608. R√°k√≥czi abdicated and the Diet of Transylvania elected Gabriel prince without resistance. Both the Sublime Porte and the Habsburg ruler Matthias II acknowledged Gabriel's election. He ignored the privileges of the Transylvanian Saxons and captured their wealthiest town, Szeben (now Sibiu in Romania), provoking an uprising in 1610. His attempts to expand his authority over the Ottoman vassal Wallachia and his negotiations with Matthias II outraged the Ottoman Sultan Ahmed I. The Sultan decided to replace Gabriel with an exiled Transylvanian nobleman, Gabriel Bethlen, and sent troops to invade the principality in August 1613. Transylvania was unable to resist and the Diet dethroned Gabriel. He was murdered by Hajd√∫ assassins.  Early life  = Childhood = B√°thorys' castle at Szil√°gysomly√≥ (now »òimleu Silvaniei in Romania) B√°thory was born in V√°rad (now Oradea in Romania) before dawn on 15 August 1589. His father, Stephen B√°thory, was a cousin of Prince of Transylvania Sigismund B√°thory. Stephen was captain of V√°rad when Gabriel was born. Gabriel's mother was his father's first wife, Zsuzsanna Bebek. Although she had already given birth to four children, none survived infancy. Sigismund B√°thory dismissed Gabriel's father from V√°rad in the summer of 1592, and Gabriel's family then moved to the B√°thorys' ancient castle in Szil√°gysomly√≥ (now »òimleu Silvaniei in Romania). The Principality of Transylvania emerged after the disintegration of the medieval Kingdom of Hungary in the 1540s. The principality included the eastern and northeastern regions of the medieval kingdom and its princes paid a yearly tribute to the Ottoman sultans. The princes were elected by the Diet, but they were to seek the Ottoman sultans' confirmation to rule the principality. The Habsburg kings of Royal Hungary regarded the principality as a part of their realm and the first rulers of the principality acknowledged the Habsburgs' claim in secret treaties in the 1570s. The Diet of Transylvania consisted primarily of the representatives of the Three Nations (that is the Hungarian noblemen, the Saxon burghers and the Sz√©kelys). Sigismund B√°thory, who was a devout Catholic, wanted to join the Holy League of Pope Clement VIII against the Ottoman Empire, but most Transylvanian noblemen opposed his plan. Stephen B√°thory's brother, Balthasar, was an opposition leader. Balthasar was captured and murdered at Sigismund's order in late August 1594. Gabriel's father fled from Transylvania to Poland, leaving his family behind in Szil√°gysomly√≥; the five-year-old Gabriel was imprisoned with his mother and newborn sister, Anna. Stephen and Balthasar's brother, Cardinal Andrew B√°thory (who lived in Poland), persuaded Pope Clement VIII to intervene on their behalf. Gabriel, his mother and sister were freed at the pope's request and were allowed to join Stephen in Poland. His mother became seriously ill, and died near the end of 1595. The Ottomans routed the armies of the Holy League in a series of battles after 1595. Sigismund B√°thory abdicated in favor of Gabriel's uncle, Andrew, in early 1599 in the hope that Andrew could regain the Ottoman sultans' favor with Polish mediation. Gabriel's father accompanied Andrew back to Transylvania, and his family followed him. Michael the Brave, Prince of Wallachia, who had joined the Holy League, invaded Transylvania and defeated Andrew with the assistance of Sz√©kely troops. After Sz√©kely commoners murdered Andrew, Michael the Brave took possession of Transylvania. Gabriel's father fled to K≈ëv√°r (now Remetea Chioarului in Romania) and swore fealty to the Holy Roman Emperor, Rudolph (who was also king of Hungary), before his death on 21 February 1601. = In guardianship = The orphaned Gabriel and Anna were placed in the guardianship of their father's childless cousin, Stephen B√°thory, and lost most of their father's estates; Szil√°gysomly√≥ was seized by the royal treasury, and their scattered estates in Szatm√°r, Szabolcs and Kraszna Counties were seized by a distant cousin, Peter Szaniszl√≥fi. Scholar J√°nos Czegl√©di educated Gabriel in Nagyecsed, and the wealthy Stephen B√°thory converted Gabriel from Catholicism to Calvinism. Gabriel pledged that he would expel Catholics, Lutherans and Unitarians from his estates. The young Gabriel's strength was legendary, and he was said to break horseshoes with his bare hands. Rudolf's troops occupied Transylvania in 1603 and his officials started to confiscate the estates of noblemen through legal proceedings on false charges of treason. One of the wealthiest landowners, Stephen Bocskai, was accused of maintaining secret correspondence with Transylvanian exiles in 1604. To avoid imprisonment, he rose up in open rebellion with the backing of the Hajd√∫, irregular troops stationed along the borders of Transylvania and Royal Hungary. Although Stephen B√°thory did not openly support Bocskai, he sent Gabriel to Bocskai's court in Kassa. Sixteen-year-old Gabriel participated in a battle against the royal army near S√°rospatak in early February 1605; three years later, poet J√°nos Rimay accused him of fleeing the battlefield. Rimay also said that Gabriel spent his days mainly drinking wine and allegedly had an affair with his aunt, Kata Iffj√∫ (who was over thirty years old at the time). = Rise to power = Bocskai was elected prince of Transylvania on 21 February 1605 and prince of Hungary on 20 April of that year. His realm included most of Transylvania proper, Partium and Upper Hungary. Stephen B√°thory died on 25 July 1605. He had willed most of his estates to Gabriel, who became one of the wealthiest noblemen in Bocskai's realm. Bocskai hinted that he regarded Gabriel as his successor, ordering B√°lint Drugeth (commander-in-chief of his army in Upper Hungary) to \\"hold Gabriel B√°thory in the highest esteem among the Hungarian lords\\" if he did not return from his meeting with Ottoman Grand Vizier Lala Mehmed Pasha in November 1605. Young noblemen (including Gabriel's future enemy, Gabriel Bethlen) and military officials also supported Gabriel. Years later, G√°sp√°r Bojti Veres wrote that Gabriel hosted feasts to win popularity with Bocskai's courtiers and commanders. Gabriel's relatives, Mih√°ly K√°thay (Bocskai's chancellor) and J√°nos Imreffy (Kata Iffj√∫'s husband), were his principal supporters. His position weakened after Bocskai who was taken ill suddenly had K√°thay imprisoned for treason in early September 1606. K√°thay's opponents, Simon P√©chi and J√°nos Rimay, persuaded the dying (and often unconscious) Bocskai to name B√°lint Drugeth his successor in his last will. The B√°thorys' fortress at Nagyecsed in 1688 Bocskai died in Kassa on 29 December 1606. A mob accused K√°thay of poisoning Bocskai, and lynched him on 12 January 1607. Gabriel had demanded the Principality of Transylvania in a 2 January 1607 letter to the grand vizier, Kuyucu Murad Pasha. Bocskai's deputy, the elderly Sigismund R√°k√≥czi, continued to administer the principality with the consent of the Diet of Transylvania. Gabriel sent Bethlen to Sz√©kely captain J√°nos Petki to secure his support, but Bethlen was imprisoned at R√°k√≥czi's order on 26 January. R√°k√≥czi also dismissed V√°rad captain D√©nes B√°nffy, the fianc√© of Gabriel's sister Anna. The delegates of the Three Nations of Transylvania wanted to demonstrate their right to freely elect the prince. The Diet first passed a decree prohibiting a minor from being elected prince, preventing Gabriel's election. It ignored Bocskai's last will, electing R√°k√≥czi prince on 12 February. Gabriel mustered troops, saying that he only wanted to protect Transylvania. He demanded the cancellation of the Transylvanian decrees ordering the confiscation of his father and uncles' estates in 1595. Gabriel approached Rudolph I's councillors after the Diet expelled the Jesuits from Transylvania, offering to defend the Catholic Church in the principality if he ascended the throne and saying that he was ready to reconvert to Catholicism. Rudolph made him governor of Transylvania in June, but the appointment had no real effect on Gabriel's position. Gabriel married Bocskai's kinswoman, Anna Horv√°th Palocsai, about two months later. After being unpaid for months, the Hajd√∫s rose up in the autumn of 1607. They offered their support to Drugeth, who refused to lead them. Gabriel also treated them with disdain and promised to protect Transylvania against them at the end of October. He soon mustered his troops and marched to Upper Hungary. He again approached the royal court, asking Rudolph to make him voivode of Transylvania. After the representatives of the Hajd√∫s and the noblemen of Upper Hungary made a fifty-day truce in In√°ncs at the end of the year, Gabriel began negotiations with the Hajd√∫s. They concluded a treaty on 8 February 1608. Gabriel pledged to grant villages to the Hajd√∫s in Partium, and they promised to support him in seizing Transylvania. He also promised to expel \\"heretics and idolaters\\" (Unitarians and Catholics) from the royal council. According to the contemporary Ferenc Nagy Szab√≥'s memoirs, the Ottoman grand vizier soon decided to support Gabriel. Gabriel sent Imreffy to R√°k√≥czi, offering to help R√°k√≥czi seize two important domains in Upper Hungary if R√°k√≥czi abdicated. He informed Rudolph's commissioner, Zsigmond Forg√°ch, on 13 February 1608 that R√°k√≥czi had already agreed to leave Transylvania. Although the Hajd√∫s took control of the northwestern region of Partium, Gabriel forbade them to invade Transylvania proper. J√°nos Petki announced R√°k√≥czi's abdication at the Diet in Kolozsv√°r (now Cluj-Napoca in Romania) on 5 March of that year.  Reign  = Consolidation = Michael Weiss, mayor of Brass√≥ (now Bra»ôov in Romania) The Diet elected Gabriel prince on 7 March 1608, and sent delegates to him in Nagyecsed. Although his election was technically free, he controlled the strongest army in the principality (making resistance impossible). He pledged to respect the laws of the principality, especially the privileges of the Three Nations, before accepting his election on 14 March. Gabriel was ceremoniously installed in Kolozsv√°r on 31 March, and the Diet granted him the domains of Fogaras (now FƒÉgƒÉra»ô in Romania) and K≈ëv√°r as hereditary estates. He began settling the Hajd√∫s in Partium, and granted B√∂sz√∂rm√©ny to those forced to leave Nagyk√°ll√≥; others received parcels in Bihar County. About 30,000 Hajd√∫ soldiers received parcels of land from Gabriel during his reign. To assert his suzerainty over Wallachia and Moldavia, he decided to dethrone Prince Radu »òerban of Wallachia; however, the royal council and Michael Weiss (mayor of the important Transylvanian Saxon town of Brass√≥, now Bra»ôov in Romania) dissuaded him. Radu »òerban voluntarily swore fealty to Gabriel in the presence of his envoys on 31 May. On 18 July, thirteen-year-old Prince of Moldavia Constantin I MovilƒÉ also acknowledged Gabriel's suzerainty and promised to pay a yearly tribute of 8,000 florins. That month, Gabriel visited Brass√≥. His feasts infuriated the burghers, who called him a drunkard or a greedy new Sardanapalus in defamatory poems. Gabriel's promiscuity was notorious; he reportedly seduced young women and promoted noblemen who were willing to offer him their wives. He sent Bethlen to Istanbul and Imreffy to Kassa to secure his recognition by the Sublime Porte and the royal court. After a brief negotiation, Imreffy and representatives of Rudolph's brother Matthias (who had persuaded Rudolph to abdicate in his favor) signed two treaties on 20 August. The first treaty summarized the privileges of the Hajd√∫s in Royal Hungary and the Principality of Transylvania. The second recognized Gabriel as lawful ruler of Transylvania, but forbade him to secede from the Holy Crown of Hungary. Bethlen returned from Istanbul in late November with the sultan's delegates, who brought the ahidn√¢me confirming Gabriel's election. The sultan exempted Transylvania from paying the customary tribute for three years. Romanian Orthodox priests approached Gabriel for support against noblemen who treated them like serfs. At their request, he freed them from taxation and service demands by the landowners in June 1609. Gabriel also granted them the right to freely move about the principality. At his initiative, in October the Diet abolished all grants which had exempted some noble estates from taxation. = Assassination attempt = While Gabriel was sleeping at Istv√°n Kendi's home in Sz√©k (now Sic in Romania) during the night of 10‚Äì11 March 1610, a man entered his bedroom. Although the intruder had wanted to stab Gabriel, he changed his mind and confessed that Kendi and other (mostly-Catholic) noblemen had hired him. Kendi soon fled to Royal Hungary, but his accomplices were captured. The Diet sentenced the conspirators to death on 24 March, and their estates were confiscated. Gabriel made Imreffy chancellor and Bethlen captain of the Sz√©kelys. The motivation for the conspiracy is unclear. According to the contemporary Tam√°s Borsos, the conspirators wanted to murder Gabriel because his undisciplined Hajd√∫ troops had destroyed many villages. Calvinist pastor M√°t√© Szepsi Laczk√≥ said that the Catholic noblemen wanted to get rid of the Protestant prince. Others claimed that Boldizs√°r Kornis (captain of the Sz√©kelys) joined the plot because Gabriel had tried to seduce his young wife. Gabriel met Palatine of Hungary Gy√∂rgy Thurz√≥ in Kir√°lydar√≥c (now Craidorol»õ in Romania) in June, but they could not reach an agreement. He said during the negotiations that he was a sovereign, but the palatine was merely a \\"lord's serf\\". After returning to Transylvania, Gabriel planned to reunite Royal Hungary and Transylvania under his rule with Ottoman support. Although he ordered the princes of Moldavia and Wallachia to send reinforcements and the Saxons to pay a tax of 100,000 florins, the prince of Moldavia did not send troops and the Saxons paid only 10,000 florins. Imreffy again went to Royal Hungary to negotiate with Thurz√≥ in Kassa. By 15 August, they reached a compromise which resolved most of the contentious issues. However, Matthias II did not ratify the agreement because it stated that Transylvania was not required to provide military assistance to Royal Hungary against the Ottomans. = Conflicts = Szeben during the 17th century Gabriel went to Szeben (now Sibiu in Romania), the wealthiest Saxon town, on 10 December. Although only 50 soldiers accompanied him into the town, his army was stationed on the outskirts. Gabriel stopped at the gate of the town the following day, pretending that he only wanted to study it; while the gate was open, his army unexpectedly marched in and captured the town without resistance. He said that he wanted to secure his entry into Szeben because the Saxons could refuse monarchs entry into their towns. According to the contemporaneous Diego de Estrada, Gabriel wanted to transfer his capital to Szeben from Gyulafeh√©rv√°r (now Alba Iulia in Romania), which had been destroyed during the Long Turkish War. The Diet declared Szeben capital of the principality on 17 December, limiting its privileges, authorizing noblemen to acquire real estate and Calvinist priests to preach in the town's Lutheran churches. Gabriel launched a military campaign against Wallachia on 26 December. Radu ≈ûerban fled the country, enabling Gabriel to take possession of T√¢rgovi»ôte without resistance. Gabriel styled himself prince of Wallachia in a 26 January 1611 charter. According to Radu Popescu's chronicle, his troops brought pillage, destruction and death to the countryside. Gabriel sent his envoys to Istanbul, asking Ottoman Sultan Ahmed I to confirm his rule in Wallachia. He outlined a plan for the conquest of Poland. He also demanded compensation for the salaries of his Hajd√∫s from the Ottomans, who began to call him \\"Deli Kiral\\" (Mad King) because of his actions. The Ottoman governors of Buda and Temesv√°r (now Timi»ôoara in Romania) invaded the Hajd√∫ villages in Partium, forcing them to hurry back and defend their homes. Ahmed I granted Wallachia to Radu Mihnea and ordered Gabriel to return to Transylvania in March. Although the sultan's decision outraged Gabriel, he had no choice but to accept it. Radu ≈ûerban ousted Radu Mihnea from Wallachia at the head of an army of Cossack and Moldavian mercenaries. The Diet ordered the mobilization of the Transylvanian army, authorizing Gabriel to collect an extraordinary tax in April. However, Michael Weiss (who had regarded Gabriel as a new Nero) incited the burghers of Brass√≥ to rise up against the monarch. Gabriel dispatched Hajd√∫ captain Andr√°s Nagy to lay siege to Brass√≥, but Weiss bribed Nagy to lift the siege. Radu ≈ûerban invaded Burzenland (now »öara B√¢rsei in Romania) unexpectedly, and routed Gabriel's army near Brass√≥ on 8 July 1611. Gabriel barely escaped from the battlefield to Szeben. Matthias II considered Gabriel's attack against Wallachia as treachery, because he regarded Transylvania and the two Romanian principalities as realms of the Hungarian Crown. Zsigmond Forg√°ch, commander- in-chief of Upper Hungary, invaded Transylvania in late June. Although Nagy and the Hajd√∫s under his command supported Forg√°ch, most Protestant noblemen refused to join the invasion. Most Transylvanians regarded the invasion as an unlawful action, and only the Saxons were willing to support Forg√°ch. He and Radu ≈ûerban besieged Szeben, but could not capture it. Gabriel sent envoys to Istanbul, seeking assistance from the Sublime Porte. Nagy and his Hajd√∫ troops deserted Forg√°ch and routed the reinforcements sent to him from Upper Hungary in mid-September. After learning of the arrival of Ottoman troops to support Gabriel, Radu ≈ûerban withdrew from Szeben; this forced Forg√°ch to lift the siege. The Transylvanian army routed the retreating royal troops, capturing hundreds of soldiers. Gabriel led his army from Szeben to V√°rad, but the Ottoman troops did not accompany him. Delegates of the counties and towns of Upper Hungary persuaded Thurz√≥ to begin negotiations with Gabriel, and their envoys signed an agreement in Tokaj in December. Gabriel pledged to send delegates to the Diet of Hungary and not allow serfs to join the Hajd√∫s. However, the princes of the Holy Roman Empire persuaded Matthias II not to ratify the treaty until Gabriel reached an agreement with the Saxons. Meanwhile, Gabriel sent Hajd√∫ captain Andr√°s G√©czi to Istanbul to express his gratitude for Ottoman support. G√©czi made an agreement with Michael Weiss in Brass√≥, however, and asked for Gabriel's removal on behalf of the Three Nations of Transylvania in Istanbul in November. The Imperial Council of the Ottoman Empire accepted the proposal, and decided to replace Gabriel with G√©czi. After the burghers of Brass√≥ refused to surrender, Gabriel invaded Burzenland and captured seven Saxon fortresses in late March and early April 1612. The Diet of Transylvania urged the Saxons of Brass√≥ to surrender in May, but the Three Nations delegates did not punish the noblemen who had fled to the town. Gabriel proposed a month later at the Diet that the principality should renounce the sultan's suzerainty, but his proposal was refused. G√©czi sent letters to Andr√°s Nagy (who promised to murder Gabriel), but Nagy's letter was captured. Gabriel killed Nagy or had him executed in August, according to various sources. Gabriel Bethlen (the leading figure of the pro- Ottoman policy) fled to Ottoman territory on 12 September, and visited the Ottoman governors of Temesv√°r, Buda and Kanizsa. With their help, he contacted the grand vizier Nasuh Pasha. Weiss, who wanted to install G√©czi as prince in Gyulafeh√©rv√°r, left Brass√≥ at the head of an undisciplined army on 8 October 1612. Gabriel attacked Weiss and his troops, annihilating them six days later. Weiss was beheaded on the battlefield, and G√©czi withdrew to Brass√≥. The Diet sentenced the absent G√©czi and Bethlen to death, granting amnesty to those who had surrendered. = Fall = V√°rad (now Oradea in Romania) in 1617 The Diet authorized Gabriel to begin negotiations with Matthias II, and their envoys signed an alliance in Pressburg (now Bratislava in Slovakia) on 24 December 1612. Matthias sent his delegates to Transylvania to urge the Saxons to surrender to Gabriel. The treaty outraged Ahmed I, who decided to replace Gabriel with Bethlen in March. Matthias and Gabriel's envoys concluded a new treaty on 12 April, and Matthias acknowledged Gabriel's hereditary right to rule Transylvania. In a secret agreement, Gabriel promised to support Matthias even against the Ottomans. He granted a royal pardon to the Saxons and their allies, including G√©czi (who was made commander of Gabriel's guard). Gabriel Bethlen left Istanbul in August, accompanied by Skender, the Pasha of Kanizsa. Radu Mihnea invaded Transylvania from Wallachia in early September. Canibek Giray, Khan of the Crimean Tatars, invaded the principality three weeks later. By early October, Ottoman troops arrived to support Bethlen. Gabriel fled from Transylvania proper and withdrew to V√°rad to seek assistance from Royal Hungary against Bethlen and his allies. Zsigmond Forg√°ch sent an army of 2,000 troops, commanded by Mikl√≥s Abafy, to V√°rad. Skender Pasha convoked the delegates of the Three Nations to a Diet at Gyulafeh√©rv√°r. The Diet dethroned Gabriel on 21 October, urging him in a letter of farewell to accept the decision, and elected Bethlen prince two days later. According to the contemporaneous historian M√°t√© Szepsi Lack√≥, Andr√°s G√©czi and Mikl√≥s Abaffy soon hatched a plot to murder Gabriel in V√°rad. They entered his room on 26 October 1613 and persuaded him to give them his sword, but did not attack the strong prince because he still had a dagger. The following day, Abaffy told Gabriel that the troops from Royal Hungary wanted to see him. After visiting Abaffy's army, Gabriel returned to V√°rad in a carriage. Horsemen suddenly attacked the carriage, forcing it to turn into a narrow street. Gabriel jumped out of the carriage, but was soon shot. He tried to resist at a willow tree near the Pece Stream, but dozens of Hajd√∫s attacked and killed him. Hajd√∫ infantry captain Bal√°zs Nagy brought Gabriel's body first to Nagyecsed, and then to Ny√≠rb√°tor. His body lay unburied in the crypt of the church in Ny√≠rb√°tor, and he was ceremoniously buried at Bethlen's order only in 1628. Transylvania went through a chaotic period during Gabriel's rule. Historian Katalin P√©ter states that Gabriel \\"was not the man to tolerate inaction for long\\" and \\"ruled with extravagance and capricious irresponsibility\\". Gabriel, according to P√©ter, was unable to keep a balance among the different groups of the Transylvanian nobility, which gave rise to new tensions between Calvinists and Catholics, natives and newcomers, pro-Habsburg and pro-Ottoman politicians. Neither could he realize that the Ottoman Empire had recovered after the Long Turkish War by the time he ascended the throne and his expansionist ambitions were not tolerated by the Sultan. Historian L√°szl√≥ Nagy's evaluation of B√°thory's rule is different. He says that B√°thory's bad fame can be traced back to the works of historians who worked in the court of Gabriel Bethlen who made conscious efforts to denigrate his predecessor. Nagy also emphasizes that 17th-century popular literary works show that many commoners was mourning B√°thory's death. The 20th-century Hungarian novelist Zsigmond M√≥ricz characterizes Gabriel B√°thory as a \\"true fairy prince\\", adding that \\"fairies are unfit for this world\\".  Family  Gabriel's wife, Anna, was the daughter of Gy√∂rgy Horv√°th Palocsai and Krisztina Sulyok. According to Nagy Szab√≥, she was \\"a big fat woman\\" and Gabriel \\"did possibly not love her too much\\". Michael Weiss said that Gabriel's separation from his wife was a reason for the Saxons' rebellion because it contradicted divine law. Bethlen accused Gabriel of an incestuous affair with his sister, Anna, first mentioning the rumour in Istanbul in 1613 in an attempt to depose him. The accusation was repeated during a secret lawsuit against Anna, whom Bethlen accused of witchcraft in 1614.

Life As an apprentice with Messrs Hengstler, a German manufacturer of electromechanical counters, Haller became aware that the fixed concepts in organizations could not live up to the needs of the developments in the working world. In 1964, he went with his family to New York where, together with Paul Buser, he founded the Hengstler subsidiary Hecon Corporation and, amongst other things, invented the key counter, which gained a US patent in 1966.http://www.freepatentsonline.com/3441719.htmlhttps://books.google.com/patents/about?id=AKMtAAAAEBAJ At the end of the 1960s, he returned to Germany and began to get involved with making working hours flexible and developed concepts for flexible working hours, variable working hours, and annual working hours. Based on industrial counters, Haller developed the first time-recording equipment without which, realization of flexible working hours would not have been possible. This equipment made it possible, for the first time, to record the actual time that an employee worked and not just the beginning and end times of the working day. This was revolutionary in the 1960s. To reach a wide public with his flexible working hours concepts and to make them popular, Haller created the Swabian / English slogan 'I laik Gleitzeit' (I like Flexitime),Produkte which became the subject of discussion for many and was seen as bumper stickers on many cars. His ideas and concepts caused him to be known as the \\"father of Flexitime\\" and led to the discussion on making working hours flexible be discussed across the then West Germany, and with time to find more and more implementation. Haller advocated \\"three for two\\" job sharing to combat unemployment in the late 1970s. His advice was in demand as a Flexitime expert, not only in Germany but also worldwide. In the course of this development, Haller started to design the first computer system worldwide from which a little later the first PC-based time recording equipment for SME's (small to medium-sized businesses) were developed. In their basic mode of operation, these systems met the standards of all time recording systems today. Many other products and patents can be attributed to Haller's inventions. In order to achieve his goals faster and better and to give the employees a share in the success, Haller founded the company Interflex Datensysteme with three others of like mind which continually developed to become European market leader (it was later taken over by Ingersoll Rand). Haller built his organization on the basis of progressive management concepts. Employee motivation played a central role in this. The idea was that one third of profits should be shared each by investors, employees and charitable projects. A novelty for that time was the active involvement of employees in decision making processes. Haller never saw himself as the boss but rather as part of a team, yet he was nevertheless a recognized and competent CEO. He was able to make his ideas understood and related them to others, inspiring and exciting his employees, winning them for a shared vision, and thus using their knowledge potential for the organization. It was extremely important for Haller for work to be fun. Willi Haller left his company in the 1980s and worked as a consultant and coach in companies, trade unions, institutions and social organizations. He founded a number of social projects, including the \\"Lebens House‚ÄúWith his visions he created new projects and was able to enthuse others such as the  Lebenshaus Schw√§bische Alb and the \\"Nudel House‚Äú.Spaghetti von Hand  L√§nderspiegel  ZEIT ONLINENudelhaus Trossingen - italienische Feinkostenwaren - Wir √ºber uns He was guest speaker at universities and management seminarshttps://web.archive.org/web/20070217051525/http://www.biberach.de/fileadmin/user_upload/Aktuelles/Files/Broschuere.pdf and appeared in television shows.http://www.tvprogramme.net/view_tag.php?tag=1985-02-06 Although Haller was a radical thinker, he also had an influence on leading managers because he was not only charismatic but also pragmatic and logical in his argumentation. He is the author of a number of books and many articles about management, economy and theological themes. He saw himself as the student of the philosopher Martin Buber, whose influence is apparent in Haller's book Das Dunkle Feuer demonstrated in this translation of an extract: Haller's ideas continue to be a source of influence even after his death, including in the work of the International Leadership and Business Society, which has set as its aim the humanising of work.

Football tops ice hockey in the number of registered players (115,000 vs. 60,000) and as a popular hobby (160,000 vs. 90,000 in adults and 230,000 vs. 105, 000 in youth). It is the most popular hobby among 3-18 year olds, whereas ice hockey is 9th. Football's standing is constantly increasing, especially among girls and women, where the yearly growth rate has lately been over 10 percent. In season 2006‚Äì07 19.9 percent of registered players were female. The Football Association of Finland () has approximately one thousand member clubs. According to a Gallup poll, nearly 400,000 people include football in their hobbies.  History  Football was first brought to Finland in the 1890s by English sailors, and it was first played in Turku. The first national competition in the sport was set up in 1906, and won by a school team from Turku. The Football Association of Finland was founded in 1907 and it joined FIFA the following year. Due to the sport's historically low status in Finland, the country has never really excelled in football. Only since the 1980s, due to the revival of Finnish football, has the country produced such international stars as Jari Litmanen, Antti Niemi, Sami Hyypi√§, Mikael Forssell, Mixu Paatelainen, Teemu Tainio and Jussi J√§√§skel√§inen.  Domestic club competitions  The highest division in Finnish men's football is the Veikkausliiga, comprising 12 professional football teams. Below that is a league system maintained by the Finnish Football Association, with Ykk√∂nen, or First Division, as the second highest division, with 10 teams. Beneath Ykk√∂nen, each division is divided into 'groups' based on the location of the clubs. For instance, the Second Division, or Kakkonen, has 40 teams divided into four regional groups, each of 10 teams. The Finnish Cup is Finland's national cup competition, open to all member clubs of the Finnish Football Association. In the 2009 season, 356 clubs signed up to take part in the competition. All Finnish domestic football competitions take place in the spring, summer and autumn, due to weather conditions. Similar systems are used in the other Nordic countries as well, except for Denmark which had that system in the past.  National team  The Finland national team played its first international match in 1911 against Sweden. Finland was still then a Grand Duchy part of the Russian Empire, and became independent in 1917. Finland have played in a few Olympic Games, finishing fourth in 1912, but have so far never qualified for the FIFA World Cup. Finland qualified to UEFA European Championship for the first time in 2020. The Football Association of Finland also organizes national under-19 and under-21 teams. The Finland women's national football team made their competitive debut in the 1984 European Competition for Women's Football qualification.http://www.uefa.com/teamsandplayers/teams/teama/team=500042/profile/history/index.html To date, their most successful competition has been UEFA Women's Euro 2005, where they reached the semi-finals stage.  √Öland Islands  Since 1943 the √Öland Football Association (√ÖFA) has organized football in the √Öland Islands. The √ÖFA is a district association of the Football Association of Finland. However, the √Öland Islands fields independent men's and women's national teams, principally competing in the Island Games.

A supporter of King Charles I, he held offices including Lord President of the Court of Session and was a Privy Counsellor. Although he fell from favour, he continued to support the Royal cause during the Wars of the Three Kingdoms, when his estates were damaged by the troops of Oliver Cromwell. He married Agnes, daughter of Patrick, Lord Gray, and had a son John Graham, Lord of Kinpont, who had a son William Graham, 8th Earl of Menteith who prior to his death was styled William Graham, Lord of Kinpont. Biography =Early life= Born in 1591 or 1592, William Graham was still in his minority in the early part of 1610 when a royal dispensation was granted, and on 7 August that year, he reached the age of majority and was served heir to his father in the earldom of Menteith, the lands of Kilbride, and others. He devoted much of his early life to consolidating and adding to his estates. =Offices held= In 1621, Graham had a Commission of Justiciary over the criminal activity in his lands, and in that same year he first sat in Parliament. Appointed a member of the Privy Council of Scotland in 1626, he was Lord President of the Court of Session from 1628, an office he held in conjunction with that of Lord Justice General. He was held in great favour by Charles I, who appointed him a member of the English Privy Council. Extension of authority Having attained a position of influence, William Graham initiated a suit to try and reclaim the earldom of Strathearn, comprising the lands of Strathearn which encompassed all of Menteith and other areas. This earldom had been lost by his ancestor Malise Graham, 1st Earl of Menteith, in 1427. He proceeded on the idea that the earldom of Strathearn only followed along male lines of descent, and therefore reverted to him, and he was not hindered in his efforts. He was created Earl of Strathearn in 1631, and took action to secure his authority over all of Strathearn. =Opposition= Graham met with some opposition which dealt with his claims to the Earldom of Menteith and his bloodline. William Graham's opponents, who possessed some of the lands of Strathearn, showed great alarm at the fact that William Graham was to be the earl of their lands, and took it upon themselves to tell of William Graham's boasting of a bloodline more royal than the King, Charles I. It is said that in front of witnesses he boasted that he had the reddest blood in Scotland and that the King was obliged to him for his crown, a charge which Earl William denied. The argument involving the royal bloodline involves an inheritance or relation to David Stewart, Earl of Strathearn, the son of King Robert II of Scotland, which was necessary to his legal claim for the Earldom of Strathearn. =Consequences= Because the lineage of Robert II was of then a matter of some controversy, the patent was withdrawn in 1633 and he was created Earl of Airth instead. He subsequently lost the favor of Charles I. Airth is a small location which is well south-west of Aberfoyle, and therefore it was a title of some negativity. He was ordered to confine himself to Airth for four years, until he was restored to favour in 1637 and served against the Covenanters. In 1639, 1644, and 1645, and remaining staunch to the royal cause not withstanding the penalty imposed on him by Charles I, he served in the Parliaments, and in 1639 he was reappointed as a Privy Councillor, likely because of his refusal to take the covenants. Loss of position During this time, Airth Castle was made a garrison by Cromwell's invading troops, and the Earl was ordered to cut down the woods in Aberfoyle parish. The crops were wasted and burned by the Cromwell's general, George Monck. The losses sustained by the Earl of Airth were never recouped, and overwhelmed, he was forced to part with nearly all of his lands to gain enough money to recover his estate. Death and heritage The Earl of Airth died, likely after the month of April, in 1661. He had seven sons (John, James, Andrew, Robert, Patrick, Charles, Archibald) and four daughters (Mary, Margaret, Anne, and Jean). His son John Graham married Lady Mary Keith, and died leaving a son, William Graham, who succeeded to his grandfather's titles.

Several critics have acclaimed \\"Visions of Johanna\\" as one of Dylan's highest achievements in writing, praising the allusiveness and subtlety of the language. Rolling Stone included \\"Visions of Johanna\\" on their list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time. In 1999, Sir Andrew Motion, Poet Laureate of the United Kingdom, listed it as the greatest song lyric ever written. Dylan first recorded the song in New York City in November 1965, under the working title of \\"Freeze Out\\", but was dissatisfied with the results. When the Blonde on Blonde recording sessions moved to Nashville in February 1966, Dylan attempted the composition again with different musicians, and decided to release this performance. All of the alternate versions of the song have been officially released, but some only on a limited edition collectors set: many of them are November 1965 or later 1966 studio outtakes, and two others are live performances from his 1966 world tour. Numerous artists have recorded cover versions of the song, including the Grateful Dead, Marianne Faithfull and Robyn Hitchcock. Recording Clinton Heylin places the writing of \\"Visions of Johanna\\" in the fall of 1965, when Dylan was living in the Chelsea Hotel with his pregnant wife Sara. Heylin notes that \\"in this d√©class√© hotel‚Ä¶the heat pipes still cough\\", referring to a line from the song. Greil Marcus reports that when the song was first released, \\"the story was that the song had been written during the great east coast blackout of November 9, 1965.\\" Dylan performs with The Band on their 1974 tour. Dylan's first attempt to record \\"Visions of Johanna\\" in 1965 was backed by members of this group, known in their earlier incarnation as The Hawks. Dylan first recorded this song, backed by The Hawks, in the CBS New York recording studio, on November 30, 1965, announcing his new composition with the words: \\"This is called 'Freeze Out'.\\" Andy Gill notes that this working title captures the \\"air of nocturnal suspension in which the verse tableaux are sketched...full of whispering and muttering.\\" According to Marcus, Dylan introduced the song in live performances in 1966 with the words, \\"Seems like a freeze-out.\\" Some of the New York recordings were uptempo and contain in the fifth verse the additional line \\"He examines the nightingale's code\\". Historian Sean Wilentz, for his book Dylan In America, listened closely to full studio tapes of the Blonde on Blonde sessions, and describes how Dylan guided the New York backing musicians through fourteen takes, trying to explain how he wanted \\"Visions of Johanna\\" played. At one point, Dylan says: \\"It's not hard rock, The only thing in it that's hard is Robbie.\\" Analyzing the evolution of the song in the New York recording session, Wilentz writes that Dylan \\"quiets things down, inching closer to what will eventually appear on Blonde on Blonde‚Äîand it is still not right.\\" Several complete takes of the song were recorded on November 30, including one with an uptempo rock beat, containing harpsichord accompaniment, and another with a march-like tempo, which was released on The Bootleg Series Vol. 7: No Direction Home: The Soundtrack in 2005. \\"Visions of Johanna\\" fell into place when Dylan was persuaded by his producer, Bob Johnston, to move the recording sessions to Nashville, Tennessee. During his first day in the CBS Nashville studio, on February 14, 1966, the Blonde on Blonde version of the song was recorded. In an interview with Andy Gill, Al Kooper has said that he and guitarist Robbie Robertson became sensitive to the nuances of Dylan's vocal. Kooper added that \\"it's very important what Joe South's bass is doing in that\\"; Kooper described it as \\"this throbbing...rhythmically amazing bass part\\". Other backing musicians were Charlie McCoy, guitar, Wayne Moss, guitar, and Kenneth Buttrey on drums. Live performances and studio outtakes Dylan plays a song to Allen Ginsberg during the Rolling Thunder Revue of 1975. Ginsberg's poetic technique has been cited as an influence on Dylan at the time he wrote \\"Visions of Johanna\\". Dylan first performed \\"Visions of Johanna\\" in public on December 4, 1965, at the Berkeley Community Theatre. Present at this concert was Joan Baez, who believed the lyrics referred to her. She said, \\"He'd just written 'Visions of Johanna', which sounded very suspicious to me...he'd never performed it before and Neuwirth told him I was there that night and he performed it.\\" Heylin suggests that if Dylan performed it for anyone that night it was Allen Ginsberg, who was also present. Heylin argues Dylan considered Ginsberg to be an important influence on his songwriting at this juncture, and was keen to showcase the song for the Beat poet. All live versions of the song recorded during Dylan's 1966 tour of England have been released. Dylan's performance of the song at London's Royal Albert Hall on May 26, 1966, appeared on Biograph, released in 1985. Asked by Cameron Crowe, for the liner notes for Biograph, how he could remember the words of such a complex song in live performance, Dylan responded, \\"I could remember a song without writing it down because it was so visual.\\" A performance of the song recorded at the Manchester Free Trade Hall on May 17, 1966, was released on The Bootleg Series Vol. 4: Bob Dylan Live 1966 in 1998. In addition, a May 6, 1966, performance of the song, recorded in Belfast, was included on Live 1962-1966: Rare Performances From The Copyright Collections, released in 2018. On November 11, 2016, Legacy Recordings released a 36-CD boxed set, The 1966 Live Recordings, which comprises every known recording of Bob Dylan‚Äôs 1966 concert tour. The recordings commence with the concert in White Plains, New York on February 5, 1966, and end with the Royal Albert Hall concert in London on May 27. The set contains 18 live performances of \\"Visions of Johanna\\", all featuring Dylan solo on acoustic guitar. (The May 26, 1966, performance was included on the separately released album The Real Royal Albert Hall 1966 Concert.) The \\"Visions of Johanna\\" studio recording sessions were released in their entirety on the 18-disc Collector's Edition of The Bootleg Series Vol. 12: The Cutting Edge 1965‚Äì1966 on November 6, 2015, with highlights from the November 30, 1965, outtakes appearing on the 6-disc and 2-disc versions of that album. The 18-disc version contains 14 takes of \\"Visions of Johanna\\" recorded in New York on November 30, 1965, and 4 takes of the song recorded in Nashville on February 14, 1966, the last being the Blonde on Blonde version of the song. Interpretation Noting how popular \\"Visions of Johanna\\" remains among \\"hardcore Dylanophiles,\\" Andy Gill suggests it is the enigmatic quality of the song that is responsible for its popularity--\\"forever teetering on the brink of lucidity, yet remaining impervious to strict decipherment\\". Gill writes that the song begins by contrasting two lovers, the carnal Louise, and \\"the more spiritual but unattainable\\" Johanna. Ultimately, for Gill, the song seeks to convey how the artist is compelled to keep striving to pursue some elusive vision of perfection. Clinton Heylin has described what he construes as the strange circumstances surrounding the song. Written around the time of Dylan's marriage to Sara Lownds, Heylin describes it as \\"one of the oddest songs ever written by a man who has just tied the knot and is enjoying a brief honeymoon in the city\\". Noting that the song is an elegy for a past lover, Heylin speculates that \\"it is awfully tempting to see Johanna as his muse,\\" who, in the song, is \\"not here\\". For Heylin, the triumph of the song lies in \\"the way Dylan manages to write about the most inchoate feelings in such a vivid, immediate way\\". Dylan critic Michael Gray also praises the subtlety of the song. Gray acknowledges that it is difficult to say what this song is \\"about\\", since it is at once indefinable and precise. For Gray, its principal achievement lies in the way it confuses categories, using language to be simultaneously serious and flippant, delicate and coarse, and mixing up \\"abstract neo-philosophy and figurative phraseology\\". Robert Shelton called \\"Visions of Johanna\\" one of Dylan's major works. He writes that Dylan's technique of throwing out \\"skittering images\\" evokes \\"a mind floating downstream\\"; these \\"non-sequential visions\\" are the record of a fractured consciousness. Shelton argues that the song explores a hopeless quest to reach an ideal, the visions of Johanna, and yet without this quest life becomes meaningless. He suggests that the same paradox is explored by Keats in his \\"Ode on a Grecian Urn\\". Mike Marqusee situates the song in New York City, \\"a flickering, electric, ghostly, cityscape\\". Dylan describes himself stranded in a fog of detachment which provides a haven, and at the same time is pained by a piercing clarity: an unmediated response that is \\"too concise and too clear\\". For Marqusee, Dylan describes his predicament, suspended between freedom and slavery, yet hungry for an authentic experience. Johanna and Louise are objects of desire and yearning. \\"It is their elusiveness and unreality that's the point.\\" Guitarist and critic Bill Janovitz also emphasizes the urban, unreal quality of \\"Visions of Johanna\\", calling it a \\"sprawling epic\\". \\"The journey takes Dylan through lofts, the D train, a museum, empty lots, and through snippets of overheard conversation, as well as a discussion with some 'little boy lost', who 'takes himself so seriously', and who is 'so useless and all/muttering small talk at the wall'.\\" For Janovitz, this could \\"possibly be a swipe at a critic\\". Literary critic Christopher Ricks, in his study of Dylan's work, pinpoints the emotional effect of these same lines: ::::He‚Äôs sure got a lotta gall to be so useless and all ::::Muttering small talk at the wall while I‚Äôm in the hall Ricks writes that the phrase \\"and all\\" turns a mood of helplessness into a sense of \\"aggression and baffled anger\\". Trying to unravel the mystery of the song, Greil Marcus writes that the song is concerned with internal questions, rather than external ones: \\"Line by line, 'Blowin' in the Wind' is pious, or falsely innocent‚Äîisn't it obvious that whoever wrote \\"Yes, 'n' how many seas must a white dove sail / Before she sleeps in the sand?\\" already knows the answer, assuming he, or anyone, can actually bring themselves to care about such a precious question? But 'Visions of Johanna' is asking different sorts of questions. Such as: Where are you? Who are you? What are you doing here?\\" Evoking the drugged, urban milieu of the song, Marcus writes of \\"People wandering from one corner of a loft to another, doped, drunk, half-awake, fast asleep, no point to the next breath, let alone the next step.\\" For Marcus, \\"'Visions of Johanna' makes a narrative solely out of atmosphere.\\" Legacy The song has been described by several critics as a masterpiece. In 2004, Rolling Stone magazine placed the song at No. 404 on their list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time, commenting that Dylan \\"never sounded lonelier than in this seven-minute ballad, cut in a single take on Valentine's Day 1966.\\" (When Rolling Stone updated their list in 2010, the song dropped to No. 413.) In 1999, Britain's Poet Laureate, Andrew Motion, chose it as his candidate for the best song lyric ever written. Motion praised \\"the concentration and surprise\\" of Dylan's lyrics, and said that, although he distanced himself from some of the singer's views about women, the \\"rasp of his anger\\" was a part of his greatness. In 2017, the International Observer named the song the second best ever recorded, stating, \\"The 24 year old Dylan was beginning to realize that no matter how many perfect songs he wrote he could not achieve immortality through his art as he perhaps once believed, because even if people were still listening to the music in 500 years, he would still be dead.\\" In an interview with The Independent in 1992, cult British musician Robyn Hitchcock described the song by saying \\"it's pretty much the reason I'm a singer\\". Commenting on the song in a 1985 interview, Dylan said, \\"I still sing that song every once in a while. It still stands up now as it did then, maybe even more in some kind of weird way.\\" Cover versions Jerry Garcia recorded \\"Visions of Johanna\\" both as a solo artist and as a member of the Grateful Dead. The Grateful Dead played \\"Visions of Johanna\\" in concert a number of times between 1986 and 1995, and both they and Jerry Garcia solo each released a live version on record. There is also a 16-minute studio version of the song on Jerry Garcia's All Good Things Redux, a bonus CD provided with the All Good Things box set of Garcia's studio recordings. Other artists who have covered the song include Marianne Faithfull, Robyn Hitchcock, Lee Ranaldo, Chris Smither, former Flamin' Groovies guitarist Chris Wilson, Julie Felix, Maggie Holland, and Old Crow Medicine Show. The jazz trio Jewels and Binoculars, who named themselves after a phrase from \\"Visions of Johanna\\", recorded an instrumental treatment of the song on their album The Music of Bob Dylan. Foreign language versions of the song include a recording by Jan Erik Vold, K√•re Virud and Telemark Blueslag in Norwegian, Gerard Quintana's and Jordi Batiste's version in Catalan, Steffen Brandt's in Danish, and Ernst Jansz's in Dutch.

All DREs follow the same 12 step procedure called a Drug Influence Evaluation (DIE), to determine which category of drugs is causing the driver to be impaired. If a DRE determines that a driver was too impaired to operate a vehicle in a safe manner, they will look for indications of the drug(s) suspected, by the common perceivable effects the drugs have on the human body. There are seven categories of classifications a DRE is looking for, including; central nervous system depressants (benzodiazepines), CNS stimulants (methamphetamine), dissociative anesthetics (PCP), cannabis, hallucinogens (mushrooms), inhalants (glue), and narcotic analgesics (opiates). DREs often testify in court, where the term \\"expert\\" has important legal implications. The Traffic Resource for Judges http://home.trafficresourcecenter.org/Impaired-Driving/DRE-Testimony.aspx describes different approaches taken by state courts in how DRE evidence is admitted. \\"Different jurisdictions take a variety of approaches to DRE testimony. Some jurisdictions hold DRE protocol and evidence to be scientific evidence; some do not. Some jurisdictions permit DRE testimony to be introduced as expert testimony (usually under Rule of Evidence 702 or the equivalent in that state), while some jurisdiction require DRE testimony to be introduced as non-expert opinion testimony. Some jurisdictions analyze DRE testimony through the lens of Daubert, while other jurisdictions use the Frye analysis.\\" The acronym 'DRE' has been used to refer not just to the DRE officers, but also to the examination they perform, the \\"Drug Recognition Examination\\", or \\"Drug Recognition Evaluation.\\" The confluence of acronyms leads to confusion, and the IACP now calls the evaluation done by DRE officers the \\"Drug Influence Evaluation\\", DIE. DIEs were developed by police officers from the Los Angeles Police Department in the early 1970s. The officers' drug recognition methods were officially recognized by the LAPD management in 1979, and adopted by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration in the early 1980s. As of 2005, approximately 6,000 police officers are certified as Drug Recognition Experts. Certification is issued by the International Association of Chiefs of Police (IACP). To remain certified and in good standing, DREs must track their evaluations and enter the results into an online database.

DOT HS172A R01/10. is widely cited in court as defining standards for the performance of a Drug Influence Evaluation.  12-Step DRE process A DIE involves the following 12 steps (a detailed description for each step is given at the DECP.org) # Breath Alcohol Test: The arresting officer reviews the subject's breath alcohol concentration (BrAC) test results and determines if the subject's apparent impairment is consistent with the subject's BrAC. If so, the officer will not normally call a DRE. If the impairment is not explained by the BrAC, the officer requests a DRE evaluation. # Interview of the arresting officer # Preliminary examination and first pulse # Eye examinations # Divided Attention Psychophysical Tests # Vital signs and second pulse # Dark room examinations # Examination for muscle tone # Check for injection sites and third pulse # Subject's Statements and Other Observations # Analysis and Opinions of the Evaluator # Toxicological examination : After completing the evaluation, the DRE normally requests a urine, blood and/or saliva sample from the subject for a toxicology lab analysis.  Scientific validation The DIE testing done by DRE officers is said to be scientific. This claim is critical to the admission of DRE expert testimony in criminal trials. The DRE Student Manual identifies three scientific studies as being those that validate DRE testing.NHTSA: Drug Evaluation and Classification Training: the Drug Recognition Expert School. Washington, D.C.: NHTSA 2010. DOT HS172A R01/10, Session III, page 4ff These studies are: Bigelow 1985 (aka the Johns Hopkins study);Bigelow GE, et al.

Admissibility  In 2017, the Supreme Court of Canada held that \\"a DRE is a ‚Äúdrug recognition expert‚Äù, certified as such for the purposes of the 12 step evaluation. By reason of his training and experience, a DRE undoubtedly possesses expertise on determining drug impairment that is outside the experience and knowledge of the trier of fact. He is thus an expert for the purpose of applying the 12 step evaluation and determining whether that evaluation indicates drug impairment. His expertise has been conclusively and irrebuttably established by Parliament. Knowledge of the underlying science is not a precondition to the admissibility of a DRE‚Äôs opinion.\\" R. v.

Between these two cities, the highway serves the southern shoreline of Georgian Bay, passing through Stayner, Collingwood and Meaford and by the Blue Mountain Resort. In addition, the highway serves as the main route to Wasaga Beach, a popular recreational destination during the summer months.  Route description  Highway 26 facing west towards Owen Sound; the highway dives through several large valleys between here and Meaford. Highway 26 between Owen Sound and Meaford in the west is not as highly travelled as the tourist areas to the east. It is also not a very straight route, as the highway makes four right-hand turns at signalled intersections, including the junction with Simcoe Road 27 (formerly Highway 27) north of Barrie (which is not signalled), the intersection with Simcoe Roads 91 and 42 in Stayner, Hume Street in eastern Collingwood, and High Street in western Collingwood. From Meaford eastwards, the highway runs along the Georgian Bay shoreline, and in The Blue Mountains (extending from Thornbury eastwards through to the west limits of Collingwood), passes through a nearly continuous corridor of low-density resort-style residential developments, mostly concentrated in the Blue Mountain Resort area. Between Collingwood and Wasaga Beach, the highway is a four-lane divided roadway with roundabouts transitioning to the undivided sections at both ends: one at Mosely Street in Wasaga Beach, and the other at Poplar Sideroad in Collingwood. The routing of the highway takes it from the junction with Highway 6, Highway 10 and Highway 21 in Owen Sound to its terminus at Highway 400 in Barrie at the Bayfield street interchange. For a time, the highway continued southward to Dunlop street, formerly Highway 11, in Barrie, cosigned with Highway 27. The southern portion of Bayfield street was downloaded to the City of Barrie along with Dunlop street in 1997, when these sections of Highway 27 and 11 were eliminated. This shortened the highway's length by 1.3 kilometres and removed the 7.2 kilometre concurrency with Highway 27. The highway's current length is 115.7 km. The highway serves as a major link between Barrie and the Greater Toronto Area (via Highway 400) and the popular tourist region on the southern shore of Georgian Bay. Over the past several years the popularity of this region has increased, and traffic levels have increased accordingly. Major reconstruction work was undertaken to repair the very old bridge over the Nottawasaga River in Edenvale (between Barrie and Stayner).  History  Highway 26 was first assumed by the Department of Highways on July 2, 1927 along an existing trunk route between Barrie and Owen Sound. At its western terminus, the route ended at Highway 6; the eastern terminus was at Highway 11\\\\. Since then, the route has remained almost unchanged, except in the Collingwood and Barrie areas. Prior to the completion of the Pretty River Parkway in Collingwood in the 1970s, Highway 26 was routed through Collingwood along Hume Street, before making a 90 degree right turn (north) at the intersection with Highway 24 (Now Simcoe Road 124, Hurontario Street) with which it was concurrent until Highway 24's terminus at First Street, where Highway 26 makes a 90 degree left turn (west) onto First Street, continuing on the present route. The Pretty River Parkway was a bypass of this highly congested downtown route, branching off to the north from Hume Street and swinging gradually westward along the shoreline until becoming Huron Street, which is the eastward extension of First Street beyond Hurontario. In 2003, Pretty River Parkway was widened to four lanes to match the existing sections of Huron and First Streets. In 2012, a bypass east of Collingwoood was constructed and it opened on November 15 of that year. It was constructed due to the old route being a dangerous section of road with numerous intersecting side streets and private residences with direct highway entrances, along with very high traffic volumes. The new alignment has the highway veer west in the west end of Wasaga Beach, and parallel the current highway until a point near the eastern town limits of Collingwood. The former route now named as Beachwood Road from Collingwood to Mosely Street in Wasaga Beach. The remaining section of the former alignment south of Mosely Street has been renamed Lyons Court. Within Barrie, a portion of Highway 26 was transferred to the city in 1998, truncating it at Highway 400\\\\. This former portion is now known simply as Bayfield Street.  Future  It is believed that the bypass is the first part in realigning the existing highway within the Collingwood area that would potentially see the bypass extended around the town, but no other projects or studies are underway that would expand this highway beyond its current length.

For years it was led by Amath Dansokho. History PIT emerged from the Senegalese branch of the African Independence Party (PAI). At the time of the 1960 local elections, PAI was accused by the government of fomenting unrest following a series of incidents in Saint-Louis. PAI was banned and went underground. The general secretary, Majhmoud Diop, and Tidiane Ba√Ødy Ly went into exile in Guinea. In 1963 at the 23rd plenary session of the Central Committee of PAI a group of party cadres, including Babacar Niang and Tidiane Ba√Ødy Ly, were expelled from the party, accused of \\"anti-party fractional activity, right-wing opportunist tendencies\\" (Momsarew, April 1964). In the December 1, 1963 elections PAI joined the Senegalese Democracy and Unity bloc. Whereas many young cadres of the clandestine PAI went to study at the Patrice Lumumba University in Moscow, one section were sent to Cuba to receive training in guerrilla warfare. A group of 25 PAI guerillas entered eastern Senegal in 1965 trying to launch armed struggle against the government. The guerillas were, however, soon overrun captured and imprisoned. In 1965 PAI split, when Landing Savan√© left to form the pro- Chinese Senegalese Communist Party. This split led to the dismantling of the Dakar cell of PAI. In 1966 Seydou Cissokho took over as general secretary. In 1967 a rectification campaign was initiated, strengthening the position of Cissokho. During the period 1965-1968 PAI had a low profile. It worked in the Syndicat des Enseignants du S√©n√©gal and the Association of Senegalese Workers in France (ATSF). At the 1972 congress Majhmoud Diop, the former general secretary, was expelled. The party was now completely in the hands of Cissokho. 1972-1975 was in many ways a period of reconstruction of PAI. Its main publication, Momsarev, started appearing somewhat regularly. PAI went on to organize a students' movement, Students Movement of the African Independence Party (MEPAI). This would later evolve into the General Union of Senegalese Students, Pupils and Probationary Teachers in Europe in 1975. This student movement would however rapidly split away from the party, and form the more radical Democratic League. In 1976 Majhmoud Diop and his followers regrouped. Effectively two separate parties worked with the name PAI, PAI- S√©n√©gal (led by Cissokho, technically the original PAI) and PAI-R√©novation (led by Diop). Soon PAI-R√©novation was accorded recognition by the state to the name PAI. In 1977 PAI-S√©n√©gal appealed to the president to substitute PAI- R√©novation for itself as the legal left. PAI-S√©n√©gal called for a boycott of the 1978 elections. In 1979 PIT formed a new youth wing, Democratic Youth Union Alboury Ndiaye (Union de la Jeunesse D√©mocratique Alboury Ndiaye). PAI- S√©n√©gal later registered itself with the authorities as PIT on July 9, 1981. In March 1999, the PIT and two other left-wing parties, And-J√´f/African Party for Democracy and Socialism (AJ/PADS) and the Democratic League/Movement for the Labour Party (LD/MPT), agreed to support the candidacy of opposition leader Abdoulaye Wade of the Senegalese Democratic Party (PDS) in the 2000 presidential election.\\"Senegal: Left opposition parties rally behind single presidential candidate\\", Africa No 1 radio, March 23, 1999. After Wade's victory, the PIT joined the new government. Differences between Wade and PIT soon surged, and eight months after the installment of the new government the PIT was expelled. PIT joined the opposition ranks and formed part of the CDC opposition coalition. In the parliamentary election held on 29 April 2001, the party won 0.6% of the popular vote and 1 out of 120 seats. For the 2007 presidential and parliamentary elections, PIT joined the Coalition Alternative 2007. The coalition backed Moustapha Niasse in the February 2007 presidential election, and Dansokho was chosen to head the coalition's list in the 2007 parliamentary election.\\"Senegalese opposition leader heads new coalition\\", African Press Agency, December 22, 2006. Subsequently, however, most of the opposition, including the PIT, decided to boycott the parliamentary election. PIT publishes Daan Doole (The Worker) and Gestu.

A co-founder of the Celtic League in 1961, he was its first general secretary until 1984. A native Breton speaker, he trained as a primary school teacher but in his early twenties joined the separatist Bezen Perrot militia (1943‚Äì44), for which he was sentenced to death in absentia at a court martial by the post-World War II French government, but eventually amnestied in 1967. After studying mathematics and physics at the University of Marburg, Germany, he arrived in Ireland in 1950. He continued his studies at University College, Galway, and, on graduation, joined the Irish Meteorological Service, becoming a naturalised Irish citizen in 1955. An aviation meteorologist, he devoted his spare time and retirement to peaceful activism, promoting the languages, culture and autonomy of the Celtic countries. Among the honours he received for his work was the 1986 Gradam an Phiarsaigh (annual Pearse award) presented by the President of Ireland, Patrick Hillery. In the same year, at the Welsh Eisteddfod, he was elected as a Bard of the Welsh Gorsedd. He was fluent in all the six modern Celtic languages as well as English, French and German. Death Heusaff died on 3 November 1999, at his home near An Spid√©al in Connemara, Galway. He married Br√≠d N√≠ Dhochartaigh in 1953 (died 2 February 2008); the couple had six children, four girls and two boys. Youth in Brittany Heusaff was born in 1921 in Sant Ivi, near Rosporden, now in Kernev (Cornouaille, Department of Finist√®re). His family originated in nearby Toulgoat and his parents, S√©bastien and Mari Heusaff, were native Breton speakers. Heusaff spoke only Breton at the time he was sent to school.(1) When Heusaff was growing up it was estimated there were well over a million native speakers of this Celtic language. In 1925 the French Minister of Education, Anatole de Monzie, made clear the Government policy: \\"For the linguistic unity of France, Breton must be exterminated\\". Now banned by law was the teaching of language, literature, history, folklore and anything interpreted as \\"nationalist\\". (2) Arriving in a French-speaking school in these circumstances profoundly affected the boy. His community's language was openly vilified and children were punished if caught speaking it. Nevertheless, Heusaff had a good ear for languages and eventually joined the √âcole Normale in Kemper (Quimper, Finist√®re) where he trained as a primary-school teacher. He continued to be acutely aware of the state's policy on Breton. Most native speakers, under these conditions, were made illiterate in their own language by the state. Yet Breton was an old literary language with the first manuscripts in it surviving from a century earlier than such manuscripts in French.(3) To teach himself literacy in Breton, Heusaff sent for a correspondence course from Skol-Ober founded in 1932 by Marc'harid Gourlaouen (1902‚Äì1987). As it was not politic to do so openly, he found help from a native speaker who offered the use of his address as a post-restante to receive the lessons. In an interview in 2005 with the historian Daniel Leach, his widow, Br√≠d Heusaff commented on the effect of his school experience on his life: \\"I'm fairly certain that if Breton had been taught at school when Alan went there‚Ä¶ and if there had been some respect for it, that he would never have become involved in the Breton movement at all. Because his main interest, really, was the language\\". (4) In 1938, as a teenager, Heusaff joined the Parti National Breton (PNB) which sought to re-assert Breton independence. The crowns of Brittany and France had become unified by the marriage of Anne of Brittany to Charles VIII of France, as a condition following the defeat of the Breton armies at the Battle of Saint-Aubin-du- Cormier in 1488. Following the death of Charles VIII in 1498, Anne was forced to marry his cousin, Louis XII of France, to ensure the French crown's continued control of Brittany. Under the Trait√© d'Union de la Bretagne √† la France, 18 September 1532, the Breton Parliament remained in being until the French National Assembly, following the French Revolution, arbitrarily abolished it in 1790. This caused a complicated situation in Brittany as many Bretons had spearheaded the Revolution as a means of overthrowing the centralist politics of the French monarchy.(5) Heusaff stated in 1970: \\"From 1938 onwards I shared the conviction that Brittany could never regain her freedom \\"by consent\\"; the French state would use all its strength to prevent that ever happening. I agreed that we should seek external support, wherever it came from, because we were too weak to attain our aims alone. Why should we not do what all free countries do when their freedom is threatened; seek alliances? By doing so we were affirming that we were already free\\".(6) Heusaff joined the PNB's uniformed but unarmed Bagado√π Stourm and then gravitated to the Kadervenn group of PNB, which believed in direct action. He became convinced that only separation from France would save both the language and the cultural identity, which he believed was dependent on its survival. Like many other Breton nationalists, he was greatly influenced by the Irish example of the 1916 Easter Rising. From the experience of their fellow Celts of Ireland during World War I, many young Bretons came to believe that if war were to break out again, then France's difficulty would be Brittany's opportunity. German occupation In 1940, German forces overwhelmed France and Marshal of France Philippe P√©tain signed an Armistice. The establishment in July of Marshal P√©tain's French collaborationist government in Vichy, however, still gave it legal authority not only in the \\"unoccupied south\\" but also in northern and western France occupied by the German Wehrmacht. Many Breton militants soon realised that Germany was of little support. Rather than help the Bretons achieve their freedom, the German Occupation allowed the French collaborationist government of Vichy to remove a large section of Brittany, the department of Loire-Atlantique, in 1941. This area included Naoned (Nantes) the capital and seat of the Dukes of Brittany. The transformation of ancient Breton borders was something post-war governments were happy to inherit. With German approval, Vichy suppressed the Breton National Committee (Comit√© national Breton, CNB, which had been declared by nationalists in 1940) and its journal L'Heure Bretonne. From 1941, as resistance to the occupiers grew, Breton nationalism became more divided. Moderates adopted a neutralist position, imitating that of neutral Ireland. But others, including militant activist C√©lestin Lain√© (later known as Neven Henaff), continued to make overtures to the Nazis, hoping for their support for an independent Brittany with ties to Germany. The more supportive nationalists were of Germany, they reasoned, the more likely Berlin would be to abandon Vichy and create a Breton state.(7) The war divide within Brittany as a whole deepened at the same time and members of the Maquis, the French Resistance, began to view all Breton nationalists as potential collaborators. They allegedly began a policy of assassination of leading Bretons in September 1943. Yann Bricler, a PNB official in Kemper and manager of the PNB magazine Stur, was shot dead in his office. Another nationalist, Yves Kerhoas, was also assassinated. On 12 December 1943, Abb√© Yann Vari Perrot, the 66-year-old parish priest of Scrignac, was shot dead on the steps of his church. Perrot had been decorated for his services in World War I, but was a native speaker and leading cultural Breton nationalist, playwright and writer, involved in devising a standard orthography for the language. C√©lestin Lain√© had led an underground physical force movement, Gwenn-ha-Du (white and black, named after the Breton national flag) from 1930, had organised militant groups such as Lu Brezon, renamed Bezen Kadoudal, and now saw the opportunity to organise an open, uniformed and armed group ‚Äì Bezen Perrot. The conditions of this unit was that it would not fight outside the borders of Brittany but remain as \\"a protective militia\\" against the French Maquis's attempts to eliminate Breton activists. But as the conflict on the ground intensified and German reprisals became more ferocious, the authorities took the Bezen Perrot and other groups in hand. By 1944, they had provided the unit with uniforms and weapons, and listed them as a unit of the SD, Sicherheitsdienst. Lain√© made clear that Bezen Perrot's war was against France and was on behalf of Brittany not Germany. But although he was reported as concerned that the unit should not operate on behalf of the SD it was used by them and mounted guard on the SD interrogation centre in Rennes. In the months before and after the D-Day landings in June 1944, atrocities were reported on all sides of the conflict in Brittany. Heusaff had been working as a primary school teach at Kerien (Querrien) and between 1941 and 1942 he began to write articles about the problems of Brittany under the pseudonym \\"Mab Ivi\\" (Son of Ivi, his home village). Others articles appeared in L'Heure Bretonne\\" and \\"Arvor. In 1942, he resigned his teaching post. Heusaff had become a kerrenour (lieutenant) in Bezen Kadoudal, which, in December 1943, became Bezen Perrot and which Heusaff saw as the nucleus of a Breton independence army.(8) > \\"We were prepared to co-operate with the devil himself, if that would get > rid of the French. The French were the greatest enemies of the Breton > people\\".(9) A fuller account of the Bezen Perrot, including Heusaff's role, is given in Daniel Leach's Fugitive Ireland (Four Courts Press, 2009). Among controversies, Leach deals with some later accusations depicting Heusaff as a member of the LVF, showing them to be unfounded. The main focus of the book is an analysis of why Ireland gave asylum after the war to some Bretons and other foreign militants who had collaborated with Axis forces. Controversies on these issues are also elucidated in Leach's article \\"Irish Post-War Asylum: Nazi sympathy, Pan Celticism or raisons d'etat?\\" (History Ireland, May/June 2007). (10) In June 1944, shortly after D-Day, Heusaff was at Plo√´rdut, Morbihan, with members of the Bezen Perrot, when they became involved in a firefight with members of a Free French commando unit. He was seriously wounded in the shoulder and lung. Two others members of his unit were killed. Locals took Heusaff to hospital where he remained for a few weeks before evacuated to a German hospital in Montabaur, Alsace-Lorraine, where he remained until September 1944. While in hospital, he was visited by Friedrich Hielscher, the poet, philosopher and journalist. He had connections with the Deutsche Gesellschaft f√ºr keltische studien (German Society for Celtic Studies) in Berlin and had been on a research trip to Brittany in 1943. It is suspected that he took this trip on behalf of the Abwehr, or the Ahnenerbe, which came under the SS. According to some reports, Hielscher had been involved in a resistance circle to the Nazis since the 1930s, helping Jews and others in danger from the regime. Indeed, Hielsher had contacts with members of oppressed \\"peuples de culture\\" since 1927 and some members of his group were arrested as early as 1933. (11) On leaving hospital in late 1944, Heusaff found Breton contacts in Strasbourg and spent time there. Other Bezen Perrot members were living there under assumed identities. Heusaff joined them and adopted the name Bernhard Heubacher, receiving papers with Hielscher's help. Until 1947, he worked in forestry, It was a frugal existence, sometimes he was forced to live on nettle soup. With Hielscher's help, he entered the university to study Physics and Maths. He remained there until 1950. Then he decided to follow other Breton militants who had sought asylum in Ireland. The Allies had swept through Brittany in August 1944, and as the Germans retreated, many of the Bezen Perrot had fled to Germany as well. On 19 September 1944, the Germans on the Crozon Peninsula had surrendered but pockets in L'Orient and in Saint-Nazaire did not surrender until May 1945. The former Mayor of Brest, Dr Le Gorgeu, an opponent of Breton nationalism, had taken over civil administration and started a round-up of Breton nationalists. By November 1944, 2,000 Bretons were arrested including priests, women, children and even Bretons who had fought in the Resistance. Some had purportedly done little more than attend a Breton language class; others died of ill treatment in prison. Prisoners from the Rennes Central Gaol reportedly often appeared before the examining magistrate with broken limbs and bruises. By the end of 1946, 3,000 Bretons had been put in special camps; 300 of them had been sentenced to penal servitude for varying terms and 60 sentenced to death. Others had been sentenced to terms of \\"civil degradation\\", a loss of all civil rights as citizens and removal of qualifications. Of those involved in the Breton movement, 38 had been killed and 9 executed by firing squad, according to contemporary sources such as the Welsh newspaper Baner Ac Amserau Cymru. Heusaff could not return to Brittany. Like others who went to Ireland for asylum, he was sentenced to death in absentia, not for war crimes, but for the crime of \\"attacks upon the integrity of the French State\\".(14) He was to receive an amnesty in 1967, along with other Breton militants. Heusaff took his wife to Brittany for the first time in 1967 but were forbidden to visit Finist√®re, his home department. This restriction was lifted in the early 1970s. From then on until his death, Heusaff returned to Brittany on many occasions. His family had in no way supported his wartime activities and, indeed, his brother had served in the French Army and become a prisoner of war.(15) Meteorology On 20 May 1950, Heusaff left Marburg under the alias \\"Bernard Heubacher\\", and travelled through Belgium to England and Wales, and then to Ireland, where he enrolled in University College, Galway, to finish his degree. To finance himself, he taught German classes. One of his students was Br√≠d N√≠ Dhochartaigh from the Fanaid Gaeltacht in County Donegal. In 1953, the couple married and had six children. He had learned to speak Irish fluently. The couple's two sons and four daughters were raised as an Irish speaking family.(16) Heusaff joined the Irish Meteorological Service in 1952, still as Bernard Heubacher, and worked at Dublin Airport for eighteen months before being transferred to Shannon Airport. He became a naturalised citizen under his own name in 1955. In 1958, the Heusaff family moved back to Dublin. He worked at Dublin Airport for the rest of his career. Interested in ecological matters, he also spent time researching the history of weather patterns as recorded in Irish annals and documents from earliest times. After his death, Brendan McWilliams, director of the service, and a well-known Irish Times columnist, wrote: > Alan spent his entire working life in aviation meteorology... In addition to > his operational duties, he made brave efforts over a period of 15 years to > bring the ancient climate of our island into focus, delving into historical > documents to identify and record whatever mention might be made of the > weather. He found many such references, and unearthed nearly 1,000 useful > records extending over 1,400 years from AD 490 to 1829 which, collectively, > have added significantly to knowledge of the Irish climate in the centuries > gone by. McWilliams adds: \\"He was a meticulous and conscientious meteorologist, and I personally remember him as always cheerful, courteous and eager to help to solve whatever operational problems might arise.\\" (17) The Celtic League The formation of The Celtic league is regarded as Heusaff's major achievement. The modern philosophy of Pan-Celticism, of co-operation between the six modern Celtic nations (the Irish, Manx, Scots, Welsh, Cornish and Bretons) had first been given published form by Charles de Gaulle (1837‚Äì1880), a Breton language poet. The League was born in a meeting at the Eisteddfod at Rhos, near Llangollen, in North Wales in 1961.(18) The principal aims were then: (1) to foster co-operation between the national movements in the Celtic countries, particularly in efforts to obtain international recognition and to share the experiences of their struggles and exchange constructive ideas. (2) Heusaff was elected general secretary, a position he held until 1984‚Äì85. An existing magazine Celtic Voice was offered as a means of propagating the League. By the second annual meeting on 30 September 1962, the League had branches in all six Celtic countries, as well as in London. The League then launched its own quarterly journal Celtic News, initially edited by Welsh historian Dr. Ceinwen Thomas of University College, Cardiff. From 1963 until 1971, an annual volume was also published constituting up to 180 pages. Celtic News continued under various editors until a more professionally produced journal, Carn, was launched in the Spring of 1973, with Frank Thomson, a Scottish writer and journalist, as its first editor. Still published quarterly, Carn carries articles in all six Celtic languages, as well as in English and French. Gwynfor Evans MP continued as President until 1972, while Vice-Presidents consisted of leaders of the main political national parties, such as Dr Yann Fou√©r√© of the Mouvement Pour l'Organisation de la Bretagne; Dr Robert McIntyre of the Scottish National Party (and its first Member of Parliament) and Robert Dunstone, the president of the Cornish movement, Mebyon Kernow. However, by 1972, it was decided that conflicts of interest were arising and that the League should elect its own independent president and officials. Such a conflict had arisen in 1969 at the League's annual meeting it Dublin when Gwynfor Evans used his League office to speak of Plaid Cymru policies which conflicted with attitudes in other Celtic countries. P√°draig √ì Conch√∫ir became the first \\"chairman\\" replacing Gwynfor Evans. Later the officer of \\"chairman\\" was replaced by \\"convenor\\". Under Heusaff, the League gave evidence to the European Commission of Human Rights in 1963 concerning the persecution of the Breton language. This aroused media attention. The League sent an official delegation to the 14th Congress of the Federal Union of European Nationalities (representing ethnic minorities), and in November 1965, the League delivered a 62-page memorandum, arguing the case for self-government for the Celtic countries to the United Nations Organization and distributed it in 1966 to members of the Council of Europe. The League also took a leading part in other campaigns, for example, monitoring submarine activity in the Irish Sea where they refused to surface, snaring fishing nets and causing the loss of boats and lives. Ensuing publicity over the years to these incidents brought the League into the mainstream. Another success was the League's spearheading of a campaign to transfer the ownership of the bird island sanctuary, the Calf of Man, from the English National Trust to the Manx National Trust. The League soon made the idea of Pan-Celticism a public issue and forced the academic Celtic Congress into actions such as adopting a \\"Charter of Cultural Rights\\". In 1979, a Celtic Film and Television Festival was inaugurated and in 1981 UNESCO launched their permanent \\"Project for the Study and Promotion of Celtic Cultures\\". Conferences, book fairs, television programmes, and an International Federation of Celtic Wrestling was formed. The burgeoning of the Celtic idea came from Heusaff's original vision. Although he resigned office around 1985, he continued to work for the League. As a tribute to his work, The Celtic League published that year a festschrift in his honour For A Celtic Future, of essays by many leading Celticists, and edited by Cathal √ì Luain, who had become convenor of the League. Upon his retirement from the Meteorological Service in 1986, Alan and Br√≠d moved to Seanadh Gharr√°in, near Spid√©al, County Galway, where he concentrated on his lexicographical work, kept up a voluminous correspondence with his Celtic contacts, and remained involved in the League. In July 1990, Heusaff wrote of the future of the League: > The Celtic League has a role to play in stimulating Inter Celtic contacts, > Inter Celtic solidarity, which could express itself in contributing to > pressure on politicians and international/European institutions to steer > developments in Europe towards full recognition of the rights of our nations > including languages. Other Inter Celtic organizations exist (i.e. Celtic > Congress), also Inter Celtic events (Film and Television Festival. Celtic > Congress of Writers etc.) ‚Äì but we are the only association so far working > on a continuous or permanent basis. We need to think about what contribution > the Celtic peoples and their cultures can make to the development of > European unity, to formulate proposals and suggestions, disseminating them, > instead of adopting an aloof sort of attitude. We lack people to do this > work. Many European peoples have something like an attachment to Celtic > matters. I believe we should appeal to them to help to get recognition and > the freedom we need to realize our national aims. Our problem is to bring > young people to join in the work. The cosmopolitanization of culture, which > now rules supreme, the control of the media by the agents of uniformity, are > great obstacles to our progress. (19) Before he died, it was arranged that all Heusaff's papers connected with the Celtic League should be deposited in the National Library of Wales at Aberystwyth, and are classified as 681, Celtic League Archive. Irish language activist Heusaff and his wife were members of Conradh na Gaeilge and involved in Na Teaghlaigh Ghaelacha, an organisation for Irish speaking families. Br√≠d became a member of the Executive of Conradh na Gaeilge and was very active in Irish language activities. Heusaff took part in Irish language campaigns such as Cearta Sibhialta na Gaeltachta and was the first person to refuse, on principle, to pay a television licence because of Raidi√≥ Teilif√≠s √âireann's (RT√â) neglect of Irish language programmes. This campaign ultimately resulted in the establishment of Teilif√≠s na Gaeilge (later TG4) in 1996. In 1986 Irish President, Patrick Hillery, presented him with the Gradam an Phiarsaigh annual award for promoting the ideals of Patrick Pearse. Later that year, he was elected as a Bard of the Welsh Gorsedd, as \\"Gwenerzh\\" (Muse) as having made a distinguished contribution to the Welsh nation, language and culture.(20) Breton language scholar While working for the language and culture of his adopted country, Heusaff never ceased to promote the Breton language and the struggle of his native country for independence. He taught Breton language classes in his spare time in Dublin and became a prolific journalist in Breton, editing Argoad, a Breton language news bulletin, with an English edition Breton News, which he founded in 1959. He also contributed to Breton language magazines in Brittany such as Hor Yezh, Galva, Breman, Gwalarn, Arvor, Ar Bed Keltiek, An Amzer and Al Liamm. The first all-Breton dictionary, Geriadur Brezhoneg, published by An Here in 1995, cited Heusaff as a major contributor. This provoked some protest given renewed controversies in Brittany over his and others' wartime background. Heusaff also published a dictionary of his own dialect of Sant Ivi as Geriaoueg Sant Ivi, initially in the magazine Hor Yezh between 1962‚Äì73. A revised version of the work was issued in book form in 1996.(21) References *(1) Irish Times, 13 November 1999; Carn #108), Winter, 1999-200; Irish Democrat, December/January 1999 ‚Äì 2000. *(2) Breton Separatism, M.J.C.

Their sound has been described as \\"slow, melancholy, country-tinged ballads, wrapped in a soft blanket of acoustic guitars and minor chords\\". History The band was formed in 1993 in Oxford, England, and named after Hal Hartley's film, The Unbelievable Truth. A crisis of confidence led to a split in 1995, during which time Yorke took to exile in Russia. Upon his return in 1996, the band released their first single, \\"Building\\" in February 1997 on Shifty Disco, a record label based in Oxford. They released their first album, Almost Here, in 1998 on Virgin, and although being subsequently dropped by Virgin, the album had some success. In 2000, the band released their next album Sorrythankyou on Shifty Disco, the first from that label to be pressed in vinyl. The group parted ways in 2000, due to Yorke's decision to leave the band. In 2001, Unbelievable Truth released a double album, self-published, called Misc. Music. Disc 1 contained b-sides and unreleased tracks, while disc 2 was the live recording of their farewell show held at the Zodiac in Oxford on 16 September 2000. Since then, all of the members have gone on to other musical projects. Drummer Nigel Powell formed a new band, The Sad Song Co., and has been playing with another Oxford band Dive Dive (formerly Dustball). They have released three singles and one album, and are currently at work on their second LP. Powell has been working and touring with folk singer/songwriter Frank Turner since his solo career began, performing on all of his records to date with fellow Dive Dive members Ben Lloyd and Tarrant Anderson. Jim Crosskey and Jason Moulster became part of the group Nine Stone Cowboy, along with members of other defunct Oxford bands The Candyskins and Ride. The band reunited for a one-off concert in Oxford to support tsunami victims on 19 February 2005. In May 2007, Unbelievable Truth, as a three piece ensemble, played an acoustic set at the closing night of the Oxford venue, The Zodiac, before a summer refit. In 2007, former frontman Yorke completed his first solo effort with the help of ex- bandmates Powell and Moulster. The album Simple was released on 14 July 2008.

They are just west of the more prominent Jemez Mountains near the town of Cuba, and are separated from them by the R√≠o Guadalupe and the R√≠o de Las Vacas. This article will consider them as a unit together with the San Pedro Mountains, which are a smaller range contiguous with the Sierra Nacimiento on the north, and which are also part of the Nacimiento UpliftConfusingly, Nacimiento Peak is more properly part of the San Pedro Mountains. See Nacimiento Peak on TopoQuest. and lie at the edge of the greater San Juan Basin, which sits atop the Colorado Plateau.Fagan 2005, p. 46. The combined range runs almost due north-south with a length of about 40 mi (65 km). The highest point in the combined range is the high point of the San Pedro Peaks, known unofficially as San Pedro Peak, 10,605 ft (3,232 m).The San Pedro Peaks are a small group of rounded peaks in the heart of the San Pedro Mountains; their high point has no official name. For the name and elevation given here, see: Butterfield, Mike, and Greene, Peter, Mike Butterfield's Guide to the Mountains of New Mexico, New Mexico Magazine Press, 2006, . The Nacimientos are of some geological interest despite their modest elevation, as they form the western boundary of the Rio Grande Rift, a major rift valley containing the Rio Grande. The corresponding range on the east side of the rift, the Sangre de Cristo Mountains, is significantly higher and more rugged than the Nacimientos, which consist of long, gentle ridges never reaching above tree line. The Jemez Mountains lie between the Nacimientos and the Sangre de Cristos and are sometimes mistakenly thought to be part of the structure of the rift, but in fact are of volcanic origin rather than part of the graben of which the Nacimientos and Sangre de Cristos are the obvious manifestations. The San Pedro Mountains are a high plateau that geologists interpret as an old erosional surface. This is overlain by remnants of the Pedernal Chert and Ritito Conglomerate, which are relatively young geological formations. These reveal the geologic history of this part of the Nacimiento Uplift, showing that it was uplifted during the Laramide orogeny (mountain-building episode), then eroded nearly flat and partially buried under younger sediments, then uplifted again as part of the western margin of the Rio Grande Rift. Much of the range is within the San Pedro Parks Wilderness area and is protected against development. Hiking trails crisscross the wilderness area, making it a popular destination for backpackers. The range receives more orographic precipitation than many other New Mexico mountains, as there are no higher ranges upwind for a considerable distance. Accordingly, the trails in the wilderness area are frequently soft and soggy for much of the year. San Gregorio Lake, an artificial lake at the south end of the wilderness, is a popular location for fishing. The name \\"Nacimiento\\" means literally \\"birth\\" or \\"the Nativity\\" but also \\"source of a river.\\" The latter meaning applies here since the Rio Puerco has its source on the west side of the mountains.Robert Julyan, Place Names of New Mexico, Revised edition, University of New Mexico Press, Albuquerque, 1998, .

History The congress of the General Union of Senegalese Students Probationary Teachers in Europe held in April 1975 provoked a split on behalf of the students of PAI. The students, who went on to form LD, wanted a more radical Marxist-Leninist party. Beginning in 1978 one tendency led by Moussa Kane made contact with the PAI of Majhmout Diop. On March 29 Kane and his followers joined the legal PAI. LD founded the monthly magazine V√©rit√©. LD was recognized as a legal political party on July 9, 1981. After legalization it started publishing Fagaru. In the late 1970s, LD started advocating the unification of the Marxist left in Senegal into a single party (they proposed the name Parti S√©n√©galais du Travail). Thus it later changed its name to LD/MPT. The LD/MDT won three seats in the 1993 parliamentary election and joined the Socialist Party-led government in June 1993, during the presidency of Abdou Diouf. The party held two positions in the government.History page at LD/MPT website . It left the government following the May 1998 parliamentary election, in which it again won three seats.\\"Senegal: Leader of Democratic League gives reasons for quitting coalition\\", Radio France Internationale, June 23, 1998. In March 1999, the LD/MPT and two other left-wing parties, And- J√´f/African Party for Democracy and Socialism (AJ/PADS) and the Party of Independence and Labour (PIT), agreed to support the candidacy of opposition leader Abdoulaye Wade of the Senegalese Democratic Party (PDS) in the 2000 presidential election.\\"Senegal: Left opposition parties rally behind single presidential candidate\\", Africa No 1 radio, March 23, 1999. Wade was victorious in the second round of the 2000 election, and the LD/MPT then joined the first government under Wade, holding two ministries: LD/MPT Secretary-General Abdoulaye Bathily became Minister of Energy and Hydraulics and Y√©ro D√© became Minister of the Civil Service, Employment and Labor. In the 2001 parliamentary election, the LD/MPT was part of the ruling Sopi Coalition (also including the PDS). The LD/MPT won seven seats in the National Assembly.

The party had become highly critical of Wade and the government, and it was accused of violating \\"governmental solidarity by constant, unjust and unfounded attacks against the president, his government and his party\\". An important factor in this was the opposition of the LD/MPT to an amnesty regarding the 1993 assassination of Constitutional Council vice-president Babacar S√®ye. Prior to the dismissal of its ministers, the LD/MPT had already intended to leave the government on April 24. The party no longer identifies itself as a communist party. The youth wing of LD/MPT is known as Democratic Youth Movement (MDJ).

It was built in 1840 by the Stephensons for the North Midland Railway. At long, Milford Tunnel was the second-longest tunnel on the North Midland Railway when it was built.Jacobs, G., (Ed) (2005 2Rev) Midlands and North West: Bk.4 (Railway Track Diagrams) Bradford on Avon:TRACKmaps. The west side of the Derwent valley has a number of gritstone outcrops, one being Burley Hill to the south of Duffield, another being Castle Hill in Duffield itself. The valley here however was too narrow, and already occupied by the village of Milford from which the tunnel gets its name, and one of Jedediah Strutt's cotton mills. The name Chevin has Celtic origins, but the hill is often called Firestone Hill, for the spot on which the beacon fires were lighted to rouse the country when peril of invasion or other dangers were imminent. Description The North Midland built more ornate portals at the northern ends of its tunnels, while the southern ends were relatively plain. In this case the northern portal is a Saxon-inspired arch, surrounded by seven huge concentric semi-circular rings of stone. The portal is set into a wall of rubble masonry, which has become so overgrown as to be no longer visible.Alan Baxter and Associates in World Heritage News, Issue 14, 2014, Derwent Valley Mills Partnership The southern portal is to the standard North Midland design. Both portals are grade II listed, being part of the Derwent Valley Mills World Heritage site. History The Milford Contract for building the tunnel was let by the North Midland Railway in about October 1837 and completed by June 1840, in time for the opening of the line. The engineers for the route were George and Robert Stephenson, assisted by Frederick Swanwick. The winning contractor was David McIntosh who tendered ¬£93,122 () Historic England has suggested that the architect Francis Thompson may have been involved with the design of the tunnel portal, which received more special aesthetic treatment because it faced land owned by the Strutt family, who were in negotiations by the railway, and it could be readily appreciated by standing on an adjacent road bridge. No contract drawings of Milford Tunnel North Portal have been found. Milford Tunnel is included in the drawings for the Milford contract, but this doesn‚Äôt show the North Portal as executed. Instead it shows the standard North Midland Railway design for tunnel portals, without specifying the north or south portal. This design was executed at the tunnel's south portal, suggesting that at the time the contract was let, both portals weere intended to be the same, and that the northern structure's design as built was a late addition to the contract. When the Midland Railway upgraded the line to four tracks south of the tunnel, a signal box was installed to control the junction of the goods and passenger lines, also providing warning distant signals at the north entrance. Tower At the summit of the hill there was built a substantial tower, which still exists, the purpose of which has been a matter for speculation. It has generally been thought that it was to check the alignment of the tunnel construction, and was equipped with a rotating telescope.

She is the co-anchor of 20/20 and the breaking news anchor/fill-in anchor for Good Morning America. She was a national correspondent for NBC News, co-host of the Saturday edition of NBC's Today, and anchor on MSNBC. Since May 2018, she has been the co-anchor of 20/20 alongside David Muir. Early life Born in St. Joseph, Michigan, Robach grew up in East Lansing, Michigan before moving to St. Louis, Missouri. Her family moved again to Georgia where she attended high school and college. She graduated from Brookwood High School in Snellville, Georgia, and from the University of Georgia with high honors in broadcast journalism. She was 4th runner-up in the 1995 Miss Georgia pageant.  Career  Robach worked at WTTG in Washington, D.C., then came to MSNBC in 2003 where she spent four years, including a stint anchoring two hours in the morning, and filling in on Countdown with Keith Olbermann and Morning Joe. She was named co-anchor of Weekend Today in July 2007. Her last day on Weekend Today was May 19, 2012, when she announced she would be moving to ABC News. Robach initially appeared on ABC's Good Morning America as a correspondent. She became the show's news anchor on March 31, 2014. In 2018, Robach became the new co-anchor of 20/20 . In March 2020, Robach began hosting Pandemic: What You Need To Know on ABC, a daytime program initially focused on the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States, and airing in place of Strahan, Sara & Keke. The program later replaced Strahan, Sara & Keke indefinitely as GMA3: What You Need To Know, with Robach continuing as host. =Jeffrey Epstein story= On November 2, 2019, Project Veritas released a late August 2019 \\"hot mic\\" incident in which Robach discusses ABC shutting down her story on billionaire convicted sex offender and accused sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein in 2015. Robach's comments came just two days after an NPR story disclosed the existence of an on-camera interview with Virginia Roberts Giuffre and ABC's failure to broadcast it. Giuffre says she was sexually trafficked by Epstein to powerful men including Prince Andrew ‚Äî a claim the Duke of York has strenuously denied. In a \\"hot mic\\" video, Robach was recorded on set for ABC's Good Morning America voicing the following statements: \\"I've had the story for three years,\\" Robach says in the video. \\"We would not put it on the air. Um, first of all, I was told, 'Who was Jeffrey Epstein? No one knows who that is. This is a stupid story.' Then the palace found out that we had her whole allegations about Prince Andrew and threatened us a million different ways.\\" Robach goes on to say that Giuffre alluded to others in the interview, including former President Bill Clinton, Harvard University law professor emeritus Alan Dershowitz and Epstein's former girlfriend, Ghislaine Maxwell. Giuffre has made similar accusations against all of them also in court documents. (All deny any wrongdoing or involvement in Epstein's sex trafficking.) Giuffre has said in court papers that she saw Clinton in Epstein's presence but did not witness Clinton participate in any sexual activity. \\"I tried for three years to get it out to no avail, and now these new revelations and ‚Äî I freaking had all of it,\\" Robach says on the tape. \\"I'm so pissed right now. Like, every day I get more and more pissed, 'cause I'm just like, 'Oh my God! It was ‚Äî what we had, was unreal.' \\" Robach further stated: ‚ÄúOne of the reasons an interview with Roberts was not broadcast was because, we were so afraid we wouldn‚Äôt be able to interview Kate and Will, so I think that had also quashed the story.‚Äù Robach responded to the leaked video with this statement: \\"As a journalist, as the Epstein story continued to unfold last summer, I was caught in a private moment of frustration. I was upset that an important interview I had conducted with Virginia Roberts didn‚Äôt air because we could not obtain sufficient corroborating evidence to meet ABC‚Äôs editorial standards about her allegations. My comments about Prince Andrew and her allegation that she had seen Bill Clinton on Epstein's private island were in reference to what Virginia Roberts said in that interview in 2015. I was referencing her allegations‚Äînot what ABC News had verified through our reporting. The interview itself, while I was disappointed it didn't air, didn't meet our standards. In the years since no one ever told me or the team to stop reporting on Jeffrey Epstein, and we have continued to aggressively pursue this important story.\\" ABC News issued a statement, asserting: \\"At the time, not all of our reporting met our standards to air, but we have never stopped investigating the story. Ever since, we‚Äôve had a team on this investigation and substantial resources dedicated to it. That work has led to a two-hour documentary and 6-part podcast that will air in the new year.\\" Personal life =Family= Robach is a cousin of former Nashville Star contestant Matt Lindahl. Her aunt and uncle were performing-arts teachers at her high school. Robach was married to Tim McIntosh from 1996 until filing for an uncontested divorce in 2008. They have two daughters, Ava (2002) and Analise (2006). Robach became engaged to former Melrose Place star Andrew Shue in September 2009, after meeting him at a book party the previous April. They were married on Robach's 37th birthday, February 6, 2010, at The Lighthouse at Chelsea Piers, adjacent to the Hudson River. Robach has three stepsons from her marriage to Andrew Shue, Nate (1997) Aidan (1999) and Wyatt (2004). =Health= On November 11, 2013, Robach revealed on Good Morning America that she had been diagnosed with breast cancer after receiving a mammogram on live television on October 1, 2013, and after undergoing follow-up tests. She took time off from broadcasting to undergo a bilateral mastectomy. On November 22, 2013, Robach revealed that during the surgery, doctors found a second malignant tumor in her other breast and that the cancer had spread to her lymph nodes (classified as Stage IIB). She then underwent eight rounds of chemotherapy, radiation and reconstructive surgery.

Gazipa≈üa is a quiet rural district famous for its bananas, oranges and international airport of Gazipa≈üa Airport (IATA shortkey GZP). Gazipa≈üa district is adjacent to Alanya to the west, Sarƒ±veliler to the north and Anamur to the east. Geography The district of Gazipa≈üa stands on a narrow strip of coast between the Mediterranean Sea and the high Taurus Mountains rising steeply behind (highest point the 2253m \\"Delikta≈ü\\". Prehistoric animal remains (shelled sea animals) can be found at many locations in the mountains. Before these were the Taurus Mountains (Paleozoic Age) these peaks were below the sea. The coast road is winding Alanya, but good with four lanes in places making Gazipa≈üa easy to access from Antalya and Alanya. From Gazipa≈üa east the road is two lanes but in the process of being improved to four. It is 80 km to the next town Anamur which takes two hours to drive). The remote rocky hillsides are home to snakes, scorpions and other wildlife such as deer, rabbits, wild boar, wild sheep and badgers. There is 50 km of coastline, half of which is sandy beach and rocky stretches with small coves that can be used for swimming. The beaches of Gazipa≈üa are used as nesting grounds by loggerhead sea turtles. Construction is forbidden in these sea turtle areas. The local economy depends on agriculture and the land of the coastal strip is used for growing fruits and vegetables, especially citrus fruits and bananas. The mountainous areas have many fruit orchards and in recent years a large number of glasshouses have been built to produce crops such as cucumbers, strawberries and artichokes all year round in both locations. Some grain is grown and there is also much animal husbandry animals in the summer these animals are grazed higher in the mountains. Gazipasa has a dam (G√∂k√ßeler Barajƒ±). There is also some forestry and fishing but only small industry. The local council is controlled by the centre-right AKP. Its current mayor is Adil √áelik. Gazipa≈üa has not experienced the tourist boom of neighbouring Alanya but there are now efforts being made to attract tourists to the district by building a yacht marina and an international airport. Tourist attractions include some sites from antiquity, caves, beaches, the opportunity to appreciate the marvellous Taurus Mountain scenery with mountain walking or motor touring. The new Gazipa≈üa Airport will serve the tourist economies of Alanya, Anamur and Ye≈üil√∂z. History This is a part of the world with a long history, and there is evidence of Hittite settlement going back to 2000 BC, and it is assumed that this coast was settled long before that. The Ancient Greek city of Selinus was established here on the River Kestros (today called Hacƒ±musa) by 628 BC, as part of the kingdom of Cilicia. In 197 BC the area passed into the hands of the Ancient Romans, and in the 2nd century AD the Emperor Trajan died here after falling ill while journeying along the Mediterranean coast. His body was taken by his successor Hadrian for burial in Rome and for a period the town was named Traianapolis. The later Roman Empire (Byzantine Empire) continued to rule the area until it was taken by the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia who lost the area to the Seljuk Turks of \`Ala' ad- Din Kay-Qubad in 1225. Selinus was retaken briefly by Armenians before the conquest of Karamanids in the end of the 13th century. During the area of the Anatolian beyliks the coast including Selinti was controlled by the Karamanid clan of Konya and was brought into the Ottoman Empire in 1472 by Gedik Ahmet Pasha, naval commander of Sultan Mehmet II. The 17th century traveller Evliya √áelebi records Selinti as a group of 26 villages, with a well-kept mosque on the seafront along with a jetty for boats to Cyprus, and green mountains behind. Archaeological research continues and in 2004 a team from Florida State University found a small bronze statue of Pegasus dating back to 300 BC in the waters off Gazipa≈üa; it is now in the Museum of Alanya. We can list the castles in Gazipasa as Selinus, Iotape, Lamos (Adanda), Nephelis and Antiochia ad Cragum. =Twin towns ‚Äì sister cities= Gazipa≈üa is twinned with: * Br√∏nn√∏ysund, Norway * Virovitica, Croatia Gallery of various scenes File:Ruins_-_panoramio_(38).jpgAncient ruins File:–†—É–∏–Ω—ã_- _panoramio_(66).jpgMore ruins File:–ê–ù–¢–ò–û–•–ò–Ø_–ê–î_–ö–†–ê–ì–£–ú_-_panoramio.jpgMore ruins File:Kilikien_-_Antiocheia_ad_Cragum2_-_panoramio.jpgRuins File:Aqueduct_-_panoramio_(3).jpgRoman aqueduct ruin File:Cemetery_romania_- _panoramio.jpgRoman graves File:Emerald_lagoon_-_panoramio.jpgEmerald Lagoon File:Gazipasa-Alanya_coast_01-3.jpg File:Fener_Fish_Resturant_- _panoramio.jpgA coastal restaurant File:MHPGazipasa.JPGNationalist Movement Party office References External links * Panorama image * Gazipasa municipality's official website * Investigation of the construction history of the supposed cenotaph of Emperor Trajan (Deutsches Arch√§ologisches Institut) * Antiochia ad Cragum (University of Nebraska) * Renting Villas In Alanya * Booking Flights to Gazipasa Airport * Booking Flights to Alanya-Antalya Airport * * Selinos coins Category:Districts of Antalya Province Category:Populated places in Antalya Province Category:Populated coastal places in Turkey Category:Towns in Turkey Category:Gazipa≈üa District ","title":"Gazipa≈üa"},{"id":"2067973","text":"The Cowra breakout occurred on 5 August 1944, when 1,104 Japanese prisoners of war attempted to escape from a prisoner of war camp near Cowra, in New South Wales, Australia. It was the largest prison escape of World War II, as well as one of the bloodiest. During the escape and ensuing manhunt, 4 Australian soldiers and 231 Japanese soldiers were killed. The remaining escapees were re-captured and imprisoned. Location and background Situated some due west of Sydney, Cowra was the town nearest to No. 12 Prisoner of War Compound, a major POW camp where 4,000 Axis military personnel and civilians were detained throughout World War II. The prisoners at Cowra also included 2,000 Italians, Koreans (who had served in the Japanese military), and Indonesian civilians, detained at the request of the Dutch East Indies government. By August 1944, there were 2,223 Japanese POWs in Australia, including 544 merchant seamen. There were also 14,720 Italian prisoners, the majority of whom had been captured in the North African Campaign, as well as 1,585 Germans, most of whom were captured naval or merchant seamen. Although the POWs were treated in accordance with the 1929 Geneva Convention, relations between the Japanese POWs and the guards were poor, due largely to significant cultural differences. A riot by Japanese POWs at Featherston prisoner of war camp in New Zealand, in February 1943, led to security being tightened at Cowra. Eventually the camp authorities installed several Vickers and Lewis machine guns to augment the rifles carried by the members of the Australian Militia's 22nd Garrison Battalion, which was composed mostly of old or disabled veterans or young men considered physically unfit for frontline service. Breakout Japanese POW cap, which was originally maroon, is the only known clothing relic from the Cowra POW camp The Japanese Garden in 2004 In the first week of August 1944, a tip-off from an informer at Cowra led authorities to plan a move of all Japanese POWs at Cowra, except officers and NCOs, to another camp at Hay, New South Wales, some to the west. The Japanese were notified of the move on 4 August. In the words of historian Gavin Long, the following night: The bugler, Hajime Toyoshima, had been Australia's first Japanese prisoner of the war.S Thompson. Exhibit - Objects through Time: COWRA bugle, c1930s , Migration Heritage Centre, New South Wales, 2006 Soon afterwards, prisoners set most of the buildings in the Japanese compound on fire. Within minutes of the start of the breakout attempt, Privates Ben Hardy and Ralph Jones manned the No. 2 Vickers machine-gun and began firing into the first wave of escapees. They were soon overwhelmed by a wave of Japanese prisoners who had breached the lines of barbed wire fences. Before dying, Private Hardy managed to remove and throw away the gun's bolt, rendering the gun useless. This prevented the prisoners from turning the machine gun against the guards. Some 359 POWs escaped, while some others attempted or committed suicide, or were killed by their countrymen. Some of those who did escape also committed suicide to avoid recapture. All the survivors were recaptured within 10 days of their breakout. Aftermath During the escape and subsequent round-up of POWs, four Australian soldiers and 231 Japanese soldiers were killed and 108 prisoners were wounded. The leaders of the breakout ordered the escapees not to attack Australian civilians, and none were killed or injured. The government conducted an official inquiry into the events. Its conclusions were read to the Australian House of Representatives by Prime Minister John Curtin on 8 September 1944. Among the findings were: * Conditions at the camp were in accordance with the Geneva Conventions; * No complaints regarding treatment had been made by or on behalf of the Japanese before the incident, which appeared to have been the result of a premeditated and concerted plan; * The actions of the Australian garrison in resisting the attack averted a greater loss of life, and firing ceased as soon as they regained control; * Many of the dead had committed suicide or been killed by other prisoners, and many of the Japanese wounded had suffered self-inflicted wounds. Privates Hardy and Jones were posthumously awarded the George Cross as a result of their actions. Graves at the Japanese War Cemetery in Cowra; many of those on the side nearest the camera are for people killed in the breakout A fifth Australian, Thomas Roy Hancock of C Company 26 Battalion V.D.C. was accidentally shot by another volunteer while dismounting from a vehicle, in the process of deploying to protect railways and bridges from the escapees. Hancock later died of sepsis. Australia continued to operate No. 12 Camp until the last Japanese and Italian prisoners were repatriated in 1947. Cowra maintains a significant Japanese war cemetery, the only such cemetery in Australia. In addition, the Cowra Japanese Garden and Cultural Centre, a commemorative Japanese garden, was later built on Bellevue Hill to memorialize these events. The garden was designed by Ken Nakajima in the style of the Edo period.Tam, Tracy, \\"Australian town commemorates 1944 POW camp breakout\\", The Japan Times, (Kyodo News), 19 August 2014 Depictions in film and literature * The Night of a Thousand Suicides, (1970), Angus & Robertson, by Teruhiko Asada, translated by Ray Cowan. * Dead Men Rising, (1975), Angus & Robertson, ): a novel by Seaforth Mackenzie, who was stationed at Cowra during the breakout. * Die like the Carp: The Story of the Greatest Prison Escape Ever, (1978), Corgi Books, ) by Harry Gordon. * The Cowra Breakout (1984): a critically acclaimed 4¬Ω-hour television miniseries, written by Margaret Kelly and Chris Noonan, and directed by Noonan and Phillip Noyce. * On That Day, Our Lives Were Lighter Than Toilet Paper: The Great Cowra Breakout (English translation) „ÅÇ„ÅÆÊó•„ÄÅÂÉï„Çâ„ÅÆÂëΩ„ÅØ„Éà„Ç§„É¨„ÉÉ„Éà„Éö„Éº„Éë„Éº„Çà„Çä„ÇÇËªΩ„Åã„Å£„Åü -„Ç´„Ç¶„É©ÊçïËôúÂèéÂÆπÊâÄ„Åã„Çâ„ÅÆÂ§ßËÑ±Ëµ∞ (2008): a 2-hour TV-movie produced by Nippon Television as a 55th-anniversary special. * Shame and the Captives (2013), (Sceptre, ): a fictionalised account of the Cowra breakout by Thomas Keneally. * Barbed Wire and Cherry Blossoms (2016), Simon & Schuster Australia, ): an historical fiction by Dr Anita Heiss based on an escapee who hid in the nearby Aboriginal mission until the end of the war. * Broken Sun (2008), directed by Brad Haynes.

The village is famous for its cacao plantations, Diablos danzantes and San Juaneras. The village is surrounded by mountains and dense rainforests to the south and the Caribbean Sea to the north. The nearby Henri Pittier National Park is the oldest national park in Venezuela, created in 1937. The village is only accessible by travelling via boat from nearby Choron√≠, and is approximately 4 kilometers inland.  Etymology  Chuao's name derives from an indigenous word from a local language which is related to the term water.  History  While cocoa production in the site of Chuao can be traced back to 1591, the town itself was founded in 1660. From 1591 onwards, the area was home to a number of haciendas which grew cocoa. During colonial times, a number of slaves were imported to the village from Africa to increase cocoa production on said haciendas. = Operation Gideon = On May 3 and May 4 of 2020, Chuao was one of the sites of Operation Gideon, where a small group contracted by an American mercenary company Silvercorp USA headed by Jordan Goudreau allegedly attempted to invade Venezuela via sea to capture Nicol√°s Maduro and remove him from power. Upon landing in Chuao, the attackers, which included two Americans, were detained.  Economy  The village of Chuao subsists largely on fishing and cocoa production. = Cocoa Production = Chuao is home to a number of cocoa plantations, dating back to 1591, which grow Criollo and hybrid varieties of cacao. Chuao beans are regarded as being high in quality and, as a result, very expensive, fetching between 9 and 13 US Dollars per kilogram. Beans from Chuao are considered some of Venezuela's finest, along with Porcelana Blanca beans from Lake Maracaibo. The Chuao region is hemmed in by mountains which reduces contact with people and insects from other areas. Some experts attribute the high quality of the cacao beans of Chuao due to the intense work of the village's laborers during the pre harvest, harvest and post harvest.Annual, Chuao's cocoa production hovers around 20 tons, but has varied from approximately 17 to 25 tons in recent years. In November 2000, the Chuao cacao beans were awarded an appellation of origin under the title Cacao de Chuao, allowing producers to negotiate higher prices and attract investment.  Empresa Campesina de Chuao  The Farmer's Company of Chuao () is the worker's cooperative which operates the cocoa plantations of Chuao. The cooperative has 127 members, most of whom are female. The cooperative has sold their beans to a number of foreign firms, such as Valrhona and Amedei, before forming an exclusive partnership with Tisano, a Venezuelan partner, in 2014. The partnership sels 99% of its cocoa to foreign buyers. Through this partnership, the cooperative, alongside other chocolate makers, have implemented a Traceability Certificate to ensure that only the Chuao beans that were harvested in the Chuao village make it into chocolate bars that are marketed as Chuao origin. This traceability certificate assigns 1.020 kg per harvest and a unique serial number to each chocolate maker. The cooperative has benefitted largely from an increased global appetite for high-quality chocolate in recent years, which has helped its members earn a high standard of living. The worker's cooperative has been touted by the Venezuelan government as an \\"example of socialism\\". The cooperative has invested heavily in the villlage, building schools and medical infrastructure. However, The Guardian reported that those in Chuao who are not members of the cooperative are discontent with power it has over village life.  Culture  Central Venezuela is home to a unique tradition regarding the Corpus Christi celebration, in which young men and children partake in Los Diablos Danzantes, which depicts masked devils surrendering to a church official. The dancers who partake in this festival become members of a lifelong pact, known as the promise-keepers, to transmit their history and traditions to others. In 2012, this tradition was added to the UNESCO Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity. The other column of the Chuao village are Las San Juaneras this is the group of ladies that take care of the beautiful church in the town square, lead most religious celebration specially the party of San Juan which is celebrated every year to thank San Juan for a good cacao harvest. / Gallery File:Chuao 2012 001.jpgChuao Bay Image:cacao.jpgCacao beans Image:Chuao_cacao01.JPGChuao cocoa beans under the sun Image:Chuao_002.JPGPlaza de Secado.

Roosevelt's first \\"Brain Trust\\", a group of Columbia University academics who helped develop policy recommendations leading up to Roosevelt's New Deal. Tugwell served in FDR's administration until he was forced out in 1936. He was a specialist on planning and believed the government should have large-scale plans to move the economy out of the Great Depression because private businesses were too frozen in place to do the job. He helped design the New Deal farm program and the Resettlement Administration that moved subsistence farmers into small rented farms under close supervision. His ideas on suburban planning resulted in the construction of Greenbelt, Maryland, with low-cost rents for relief families. He was denounced by conservatives for advocating state-directed economic planning to overcome the Great Depression. Roosevelt appointed Tugwell as Governor of Puerto Rico during World War II (1941‚Äì1946). He became a professor at various universities, with lengthy service at the University of Chicago and the University of California at Santa Barbara. He wrote twenty books, covering the politics of the New Deal, biographies of major politicians, issues in planning, and memoirs of his experiences. Early life and education Rexford Tugwell was born in 1891 in Sinclairville, New York. In his youth, he gained an appreciation for workers‚Äô rights and liberal politics from the works of Upton Sinclair, James Bryce, Edward Bellamy,Namorato, Michael. Rexford G.

Schlesinger, p. 210 and Charles Richard van Hise.A Commonwealth of Hope: The New Deal Response to CrisisThe American People in the Great Depression: Freedom from Fear, Part One Tugwell began studying economics in graduate work at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, and completed his doctorate at Columbia University. At university, he was influenced by the teaching of Scott Nearing and Simon Patten, as well as the writings of John Dewey in philosophy.Namorato, Rexford G. Tugwell: A Biography, pp 21‚Äì54. Career =Academic economist= After graduation, Tugwell served as junior faculty at the University of Washington, American University in Paris, and Columbia University. At Columbia University he taught economics from 1920 to 1932. Tugwell's approach to economics was experimentalist, and he viewed the industrial planning of World War I as a successful experiment. He advocated agricultural planning (led by industry) to stop the rural poverty that had become prevalent due to a crop surplus after the First World War. This method of controlling production, prices, and costs was especially relevant as the Great Depression began.Namorato, Michael. Rexford G. Tugwell: A Biography. 1988. 35‚Äì54. =Roosevelt administration= In 1932 Tugwell was invited to join President Franklin Roosevelt's team of advisers known as the Brain Trust. After Roosevelt's inauguration in 1933, Tugwell was appointed first as Assistant Secretary and then in 1934 as Undersecretary of the United States Department of Agriculture. He helped create the Agricultural Adjustment Administration (AAA) and served as its director. The AAA included a domestic allotment program, which paid farmers to voluntarily reduce their production by roughly 30% so that reduced supply would increase the price they received. It was funded with a tax on processing companies that used farm commodities. Tugwell's department managed the production of key crops by adjusting the subsidies for non-production.Sternsher, Bernard. Rexford Tugwell and the New Deal. Rutgers University Press, 1964. 183‚Äì193. The act was ruled unconstitutional by the Supreme Court in 1936 in United States v. Butler, and had to be replaced in 1938. Tugwell was also instrumental in creating the Soil Conservation Service in 1933, to restrict cultivation, restore poor-quality land, and introduce better agricultural practices to farmers to conserve the soil.Namorato, Rexford G. Tugwell: A Biography. pp. 81‚Äì82. This was especially necessary given the widespread damage of the 1930s' Dust Bowls. He additionally played a key role in crafting the 1938 Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. In April 1935 Tugwell and Roosevelt created the Resettlement Administration (RA), a unit of the Federal Emergency Relief Administration. Directed by Tugwell, the RA sought to create healthy communities for the rural unemployed by relocating them to new communities for access to urban opportunities. Some of the RA's activities dealt with land conservation and rural aid, but the construction of new suburban satellite cities was the most prominent. In her book, The Death and Life of Great American Cities, the author Jane Jacobs critically quotes Tugwell on the program: \\"My idea is to go just outside centers of population, pick up cheap land, build a whole community and entice people into it. Then go back into the cities and tear down whole slums and make parks of them.\\"Chapter 16, \\"Gradual Money and Cataclysmic Money,\\" p. 310 She believed that he underestimated the strengths of complex urban communities and caused too much social displacement in \\"tearing down\\" neighborhoods that might have been renovated. This resulted in greater damage to inner city neighborhoods.Chapter 16, \\"Gradual Money and Cataclysmic Money,\\" p. 310 The RA completed three \\"Greenbelt\\" towns before the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit found the program unconstitutional in Franklin Township v. Tugwell. It ruled that housing construction was a state power, and the RA was an illegal delegation of the Federal Emergency Relief Administration's power.Myhra, David. \\"Rexford Guy Tugwell: Initiator of America‚Äôs Greenbelt New Towns, 1935 to 1936,\\" Journal of the American Planning Association, Vol. 40, no. 3 (1974).Arnold, Joseph.

The RA's suburban resettlement program earned him condemnation as Communist and un-American because of its social planning aspects. Historians agree he was at all times a loyal American and was never affiliated in any way with the Communist Party.Namorato, Rexford G. Tugwell: A Biography. 1988. 114‚Äì115. Greenbelt, Maryland town site, in February 1937. =American Molasses Co.= Given the opposition to his policies, Tugwell resigned from the Roosevelt administration at the end of 1936. He was appointed as a vice president at the American Molasses Co. At this time, he divorced his first wife and married Grace Falke, his former assistant.Milestones, Dec. 5, 1938 \\"Rexford Tugwell, Time, 1938 =Director of New York City Planning Commission= In 1938 Tugwell was appointed as the first director of the New York City Planning Commission. New York's reformist mayor, Fiorello LaGuardia, created the commission as part of a city charter reform aimed at reducing corruption and inefficiency. The Planning Commission had relatively limited powers: all actions needed approval from the legislative Board of Estimate. Tugwell tried to assert the commission's power. He tried to retroactively enforce nonconforming land uses, despite a lack of public or legal support. His commission sought to establish public housing at moderate densities, yet repeatedly approved FHA requests for greater density. Robert Moses killed Tugwell's proposed fifty-year master plan with a fiery public denouncement of its open-space protections.Gelfand, Mark. \\"Rexford G. Tugwell and the Frustration of Planning in New York City,\\" Journal of the American Planning Association 51, no. 2 (1985): 151‚Äì159. =Governor of Puerto Rico= Tugwell served as the last appointed American Governor of Puerto Rico, from 1941 to 1946. He worked with the legislature to create the Puerto Rico Planning, Urbanization, and Zoning Board in 1942. Tugwell supported Puerto Rican self-government through amendment to the Organic Act in 1948 but fiercely opposed decentralizing government agencies and services away from the city of San Juan \\"despite most Puerto Ricans in need of such services not residing in the capital.\\" In one case, he vetoed a bill approved by both chambers of the Puerto Rico Legislature, and supported by 59 of 77 municipalities, establishing a state medical school in the city of Ponce, calling it \\"regionalism.\\"Carmelo Rosario Nadal.

He publicly supported Luis Mu√±oz Mar√≠n's Popular Democratic Party, which wanted a Commonwealth status.Namorato, Michael. Rexford G. Tugwell: A Biography. 1988. 138‚Äì143. As he prepared to retire from the Governorship, Tugwell was instrumental in getting the first Puerto Rican appointed to the job, Jes√∫s T. Pi√±ero, then serving as Resident Commissioner in Washington, D.C. Tugwell also served as Chancellor of the University of Puerto Rico. =Return to academia= After his stint as governor, Tugwell returned to teaching at a variety of institutions. He had years of service at the University of Chicago, where he helped develop their planning program. He moved to Greenbelt, Maryland, one of the new suburbs designed and built by the Resettlement Administration under his direction. After the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Tugwell believed that global planning was the only sure way to prevent a nuclear apocalypse. He participated in the Committee to Frame a World Constitution from 1945 to 1948. He also thought the national constitution needed to be amended to enable economic planning. =Progressive Party (1948)= In 1948, Tugwell served as chair of the platform committee for the Progressive Party. During its convention (July 23‚Äì25, 1948), he recounted a conversation with presidential candidate Franklin Roosevelt in 1942 during which FDR warned him of internal clashes that might destroy the Democratic Party but might also create a \\"Progressive Party,\\" adding in his own words that Roosevelt \\"would have led a movement like that which we now join.\\" Tugwell pled for party unity under a platform that the New York Times summed up as \\"endorsing Red foreign policy.\\" =Late life= Late in life, he drafted a constitution for the Newstates of America. In it, Planning would become a new branch of federal government, alongside the Regulatory and Electoral branches.Namorato, Michael. Rexford G. Tugwell: A Biography. 1988. 149‚Äì162. During this time, Tugwell wrote several books, including a biography of Grover Cleveland, subtitled: A Biography of the President Whose Uncompromising Honesty and Integrity Failed America in a Time of Crisis (1968). His biography of Franklin D. Roosevelt was entitled FDR: An Architect of an Era. A Stricken Land was his memoir about his years in Puerto Rico. This book was reprinted in 2007 by the Mu√±oz Mar√≠n Foundation. Representation in other media *Tugwell is mentioned in the Ernie Pyle book, Home Country. *Philip K. Dick's novel, The Man in the High Castle (1962), set in an alternate world where the United States was conquered by Germany and Japan, features a novel within a novel, The Grasshopper Lies Heavy. In it, Tugwell was elected President of the United States in 1940, succeeding Franklin Roosevelt, and received much of the credit for the Allied victory in World War II, after which the US enters a Cold War with an intact, expansionist British Empire rather than the Soviet Union.

He is best known for his Warhammer Fantasy and Warhammer 40,000 novels, and his previous role as games designer for Games Workshop. He is currently working as a Senior Writer at Riot Games. Career McNeill was born in Glasgow, Scotland and studied architecture and building surveying at Glasgow Caledonian University from 1989‚Äì1996. In 1996 he started work in an architects‚Äô office designing new flats and commercial properties, until he saw an advertisement for a writer in the December 1999 copy of White Dwarf. In February 2000, McNeill started work for Games Workshop as a staff writer for games development, writing articles for White Dwarf and army-specific books. In May 2000 he started writing for the Warhammer 40,000 team, but continued to write articles for White Dwarf. McNeill has been heavily involved working on codexes, especially Warhammer 40,000 Codex: Tau between late 2000 and June 2001. Other codexes he has been involved with are Warhammer 40,000 Codex: Necrons, Warhammer 40,000 Codex: Chaos Space Marines, Warhammer 40,000 Codex: Imperial Guard, and Warhammer 40,000 Codex: Daemonhunters. McNeill continued to write codexes after moving into games development. McNeill has written extensively for The Black Library. His most recent works ‚Äî False Gods (2006), Fulgrim (2007) and Mechanicum (2008), are part of The Black Library's Horus Heresy novel series. Another part to McNeill's story about the Ultramarines, The Killing Ground, was released in May 2008. Early 2009 saw the release of his first novel outside of the Black Library, I, Mengsk (McNeill, 2009), set in Blizzard Entertainment's StarCraft universe. The novel tells the tale of three generations of the Mengsk family - Angus and his revolutionary activities, his son Arcturus and his rise to power (leading up to the events of the first game), and Arcturus' son Valerian as he struggles to embrace his family's legacy (leading up to the events of the second game). In April 2009, McNeill contributed to the anthology book Tales of Heresy with a story entitled The Last Church, one of the first stories in the Black Library imprint in which the Emperor spoke directly and at length, rather than described from afar as had so far been the case in the Horus Heresy series. McNeill's A Thousand Sons, a Horus Heresy novel focusing on the Thousand Sons legion and their fall from the graces of the Emperor by the hand of the Space Wolves, was released in 2011, and entered at number 22 on The New York Times Best Seller List. This novel was written in sync with Dan Abnett's Prospero Burns (2011) which recounts the same narrative from an opposing perspective. Graham worked closely with Abnett on the two novels, ensuring they met at certain points and would not contradict one another. McNeill plays both Warhammer 40,000, in which he plays with both Tau and Necron armies, he started with The Ultramarines, and Warhammer, in which he plays an Empire army. In 2011, McNeill wrote his first novel for Fantasy Flight Games (known for a wide range of roleplaying games, card games, and board games), Ghouls of the Miskatonic, the first story of the Dark Waters Trilogy, based on FFG's Arkham Horror board game and linked with H.P. Lovecraft's Cthulhu Mythos. In June 2015 McNeill began working at Riot Games, the developing studio of the multiplayer online battle arena game League of Legends, after visiting their main office in West Los Angeles in December 2014. As a senior narrative writer, McNeill develops backstories and lore for individual characters of the game and the in-game world. He is well known for focusing on the lore of Demacia, a fictional region which lies in the League of Legends universe.

Family He was the eldest son and heir of Cuthbert Cunningham, 3rd Earl of Glencairn by his spouse Lady Marjory, eldest daughter of Archibald Douglas, 5th Earl of Angus. Genealogy of the Roberdeau Family : Including a Biography of General Daniel Roberdeau, of the Revolution....; page 14; via ancestry.com paid subscription site, accessed September 2018. Cuthbert was the son of Robert Cunyngham / Cunningham , 2nd Earl of Glencairn, 3rd Lord of Kilmaurs by his wife Elizabeth Lindsay, daughter of Lord Lindsay of Byers. Divided loyalties While still Lord Kilmaurs, this nobleman was one of the principal adherents of the English Court in Scotland, and accepted a pension from King Henry VIII. He was one of the party which joined the force of the Earls of Arran and Lennox on 23 November 1524, when they took possession of Edinburgh, and endeavoured to withdraw the young king James V from the Queen Mother. He was appointed Lord High Treasurer of Scotland on 26 June 1526 but held the office only until 29 October the same year. In 1538 he accompanied David Bethune, Bishop of Mirepoix, afterwards a celebrated cardinal, to France to conclude a treaty for James V's marriage with Mary of Guise. Intrigues Lord Kilmaurs succeeded as 4th Earl of Glencairn upon the death of his father just before 1542, and he and his eldest son, Alexander, now Lord Kilmaurs, were engaged in all the intrigues of the Anglo-Scottish Party at this period of history, and supported the religious Reformers. In 1542 the earl was taken prisoner by the English at the Battle of Solway Moss and committed to the custody of the Duke of Norfolk, but was released on payment of a ransom of a thousand pounds and subscribing by his own hand to support Henry VIII's project of a marriage between the young Prince Edward and the Scottish Queen. In March 1543 he met with the English ambassador Ralph Sadler and the Earl of Angus at the Blackfriar's Monastery in Edinburgh. Sadler interrogated the Scottish earls on the progress they had made on Henry VIII's projects. Glencairn said he had little silver, but would willingly fight France with 5000 men for Henry. Later on the same day, Glencairn offered to put his promises in writing, and at night he brought them to Sadler. Glencairn added that if he was appointed a keeper of Mary, Queen of Scots, Henry would be sure to have her in his hands one way or another.Clifford, Arthur, ed., Sadler State Papers, vol. 1 Edinburgh (1809) pp.73-82, Sadler to Henry VIII, 20 March 1543. Allied with the Earl of Lennox in 1544 he was, with his 500 vassals as spearmen, attacked on Glasgow Muir by Regent Arran and defeated \\"with great slaughter\\", his second son amongst the slain. Glencairn managed to flee to Dumbarton, almost alone, and in September he and his son Lord Kilmaurs abandoned the cause of Henry. In November Glencairn, now pardoned by the Regent, was with the latter's army that laid siege to Coldingham, then held by the English, but which was dispersed by an English force from Berwick. In March 1544 Glencairn and his son renewed their communications with the English government in support of the English Party in Scotland, and is said to have been party to the assassination of Cardinal Bethune. Glencairn died in March 1548, and was then receiving a French pension for loyalty to the Auld Alliance.Cameron, Annie I., ed., The Scottish Correspondence of Mary of Lorraine, STS (1927), xxv note. Marriage William Cunningham was twice married, firstly to Catherine Borthwick, second daughter of William Borthwick, 3rd Lord Borthwick, and had issue with her: * Alexander Cunningham, 5th Earl of Glencairn, the zealous Protestant reformer. * Hon.

He has done important work studying the protein complexes which enable chromosome replication when living cells divide. He is known as an original author of the \\"canonical, influential, and best-selling scientific textbook\\" Molecular Biology of the Cell, and as Editor-in-Chief of Science magazine. Alberts was the president of the National Academy of Sciences from 1993 to 2005. He is known for his work in forming science public policy, and has served as United States Science Envoy to Pakistan and Indonesia. He has stated that \\"Science education should be about learning to think and solve problems like a scientist‚Äîinsisting, for all citizens, that statements be evaluated using evidence and logic the way scientists evaluate statements.\\" He is an Honorary Fellow of St Edmund's College, Cambridge. Education After graduating from New Trier High School in Winnetka, Illinois, Alberts attended Harvard College, as a pre-medicine major. Bored by assigned laboratory \\"cooking classes\\", he petitioned to skip the physical chemistry laboratory requirement and instead was allowed to work with his tutor Jacques Fresco, in Paul M. Doty's laboratory. The summer's research led to the publication of two successful papers on mismatch errors in the helical structures of DNA and RNA, and Alberts decided to continue on in biophysics. He graduated with his A.B. in biochemical sciences, summa cum laude, in 1960. Alberts then worked with Paul M. Doty on an \\"enormously ambitious\\" thesis on DNA replication, attempting to solve the genetic code using nearest neighbor analysis of DNA polymerase. After failing his first oral examination in spring 1965, he completed his Ph.D. research in fall 1965. His doctorate in biophysics was published by Harvard University in 1966. Alberts credits his initial failure with teaching him much more than his successes. \\"That was a very important learning experience for me. I had decided that experimental strategy was everything in science, and nobody had ever told me anything about this.\\" Career After graduating, Alberts went to the Institut de Biologie Mol√©culaire at the University of Geneva as a postdoctoral fellow, and worked with Richard H. Epstein on genes involved in DNA replication of phage T4. Epstein and his students had shown that there were at least seven different proteins needed for replication of T4 DNA. Alberts decided to do something that no one else was doing, and developed a DNA column for the purification of proteins that bound to DNA. This enabled him to purify T4 Bacteriophage Gene 32. In 1966, Alberts joined the Department of Biochemical Sciences at Princeton University as an Assistant Professor. In 1971, he became an Associate Professor and in 1973 a full Professor, holding the Damon Pfeiffer Professorship in life sciences from 1975-1976. Register of the Bruce M. Alberts Papers, 1960-94, n.d., UC San Francisco Special Collections At Princeton, he continued to work in the area of protein biochemistry, reconstituting systems. In 1976, Alberts accepted a position as professor and vice-chair of the Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics at the University of California, San Francisco. Also in 1976, he and his students were able to add all seven proteins to double-stranded DNA in an appropriate magnesium concentration to make DNA. More years of research were spent understanding the reactions involved. Another important step in understanding DNA synthesis was realizing that leading strand DNA polymerase and lagging strand DNA polymerase were coupled. Alberts was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1978. From 1981 to 1985 Alberts held the American Cancer Society Research Professorship, a title granted for life as of 1980. From 1985 to 1990, he was Chair of the Department of Biochemistry and Biophysics at the University of California, San Francisco. From 1990-1993 he again held the American Cancer Society Research Professorship. =Science and education= Alberts served as the President of the National Academy of Sciences for two terms from 1993 until 2005. Alberts has long been committed to the improvement of science education, dedicating much of his time to educational projects such as City Science, a program seeking to improve science teaching in San Francisco elementary schools. He has served on the advisory board of the National Science Resources Center, a joint project of the National Academy of Sciences and the Smithsonian Institution working with teachers, scientists, and school systems to improve teaching of science as well as on the National Academy of Sciences' National Committee on Science Education Standards and Assessment. He has published important National Academies reports: the National Science Education Standards (NSES; NRC, 1996), intended to change the way that science is taught K-12, and Inquiry and the National Science Education Standards (NRC, 2000) The Bruce Alberts Award for Excellence in Science Education is given in his name to those who have made outstanding contributions in science education. He has served in different capacities on a number of advisory and editorial boards, including as chair of the Commission on Life Sciences, National Research Council. Prior to his election as President of the National Academy of Sciences in 1995 he was president-elect of the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. From 2007-2008 he served as president of the American Society for Cell Biology. He served as a trustee of the Carnegie Corporation of New York from 2000 to 2009. He and others have critiqued the biomedical research system, pointing out what they consider \\"systemic flaws\\" and have created the Rescuing Biomedical Research organization, to \\"collect and organize input for solutions\\" to the problems identified by themselves and others. Alberts was Editor-in-Chief of the American Association for the Advancement of Science's flagship publication, Science for five years from 2008-2013. He is one of the founding editors of the journal Cell Biology Education. Since 2013, Alberts has been listed on the Advisory Council of the National Center for Science Education. =International work= From 2000-2009, Alberts was the Co-chair of the InterAcademy Council, an advisory institution in Amsterdam governed by the presidents of fifteen science academies from around the world, and a member of the Science Initiative Group board. In his June 4, 2009 speech at Cairo University, US President Barack Obama announced a new Science Envoy program as part of a \\"new beginning between the United States and Muslims around the world.\\" In January 2010, Bruce Alberts, Ahmed Zewail, and Elias Zerhouni became the first US science envoys to Islam, visiting Muslim-majority countries from North Africa to Southeast Asia.

Abrams' second book, Lincoln‚Äôs Last Trial: The Murder Case That Propelled Him to the Presidency, tells the true story of Abraham Lincoln's last murder trial. The book was released in June 2018, and spent five weeks in the top ten New York Times Bestseller list, hardcover non-fiction. Mental Floss rated the book #1 on their list \\"56 Best Books of 2018.\\" His book Theodore Roosevelt for the Defense: The Courtroom Battle to Save His Legacy, released on May 21, 2019, is a New York Times bestseller. Theodore Roosevelt accused his former friend and ally, now turned rival, Republican Party leader William Barnes Jr. of political corruption. Barnes responded by suing Roosevelt for an enormous sum that could have financially devastated him. Abrams' latest book John Adams Under Fire: The Founding Father's Fight for Justice in the Boston Massacre Murder Trial, published on March 3, 2020, was a New York Times top ten bestseller. In 1770, British soldiers shot and killed five civilians. As John Adams would later remember, \\"On that night the formation of American independence was born\\". Yet when the British soldiers faced trial, the young lawyer Adams was determined that they receive a fair one. He volunteered to represent them, keeping the peace in a powder keg of a colony, and in the process created some of the foundations of what would become United States law. Abrams has made other on-air appearances covering law, politics, and to promote his books, including on all three late night talk shows. He has appeared on Jimmy Kimmel Live, The Late Show with Stephen Colbert on CBS and the Tonight Show on NBC. Personal life In June 2012, Abrams had his first child with then-girlfriend Florinka Pesenti, who was part of the winning team on The Amazing Race 3. Abrams was a co-owner (with David Zinczenko) of the restaurant The Lion in Manhattan's Greenwich Village neighborhood. The Lion closed in 2015. Abrams's sister, Ronnie Abrams, was nominated for a federal judgeship by Barack Obama in 2011. She received her commission on March 23, 2012.

History Gaul on the eve of the Gallic Wars (58 BC) Principal ancient Roman roads Major cities of Roman Gaul Invasions of the Roman Empire The Roman Republic's influence began in southern Gaul. By the mid-2nd century BC, Rome was trading heavily with the Greek colony of Massilia (modern Marseille) and entered into an alliance with them, by which it agreed to protect the town from local Gauls, including the nearby Aquitani and from sea-borne Carthaginians and other rivals, in exchange for land that it wanted in order to build a road to Hispania, to assist in troop movements to its provinces there. The Mediterranean settlements on the coast continued to be threatened by the powerful Gallic tribes to the north and in 122 BC the Roman general Gnaeus Domitius Ahenobarbus campaigned in the area and defeated the Allobroges followed by Quintus Fabius Maximus against the Arverni under King Bituitus in 121 BC.Drinkwater, John (2014). Roman Gaul (Routledge Revivals): The Three Provinces, 58 BC-AD 260. Routledge. p.6 The area became a Roman province in 121 BCMaddison, Angus (2007), Contours of the World Economy 1‚Äì2030 AD: Essays in Macro-Economic History, Oxford: Oxford University Press, p. 41, originally under the name Gallia Transalpina (Transalpine Gaul). The name distinguished it from Cisalpine Gaul on the near side of the Alps to Rome. In this new province the Romans founded the town of Narbonne in 118 BC. At the same time they built the Via Domitia, the first Roman road in Gaul, connecting Italy to Hispania. They also built the Via Aquitania, which led toward the Atlantic through Tolosa (Toulouse) and Burdigala (Bordeaux). Thus the Romans built a crossroads that made Narbonne an optimal trading centre, and a major trading competitor to Massilia. It was from Narbonne that Julius Caesar significantly advanced the task by defeating the Celtic tribes in the Gallic Wars of 58-51 BC.Julius Caesar: Commentarii de Bello Gallico Massilia fell in the Siege of Massilia. Massilia was allied to Pompey in Caesar's civil war which led to its eventual defeat at the Siege of Massilia in 49 BC after which it lost its territories but was allowed to keep nominal autonomy, due to ancient ties of friendship and support of Rome. In 40 BC, during the Second Triumvirate, Lepidus was given responsibility for Gallia Narbonensis (along with Hispania and Africa), while Mark Antony was given the balance of Gaul.Boatwright et al., The Romans, From Village to Empire, p.272 In 22 BC, imperial administration of Gaul was reorganised establishing the provinces of Gallia Aquitania, Gallia Belgica and Gallia Lugdunensis. Parts of eastern Gaul were incorporated into the provinces Raetia (15 BC) and Germania Superior (AD 83). Citizenship was granted to all in 212 by the Constitutio Antoniniana. Generals Marcus Antonius Primus and Gnaeus Julius Agricola were both born in Gaul, as were emperors Claudius and Caracalla. Emperor Antoninus Pius also came from a Gaulish family. In the Crisis of the Third Century around 260, Postumus established a short-lived Gallic Empire, which included the Iberian Peninsula and Britannia, in addition to Gaul itself. Germanic tribes, the Franks and the Alamanni, invaded Gaul at this time. The Gallic Empire ended with Emperor Aurelian's victory at Ch√¢lons in 274. In 286/7 Carausius commander of the Classis Britannica, the fleet of the English Channel, declared himself Emperor of Britain and northern Gaul.Panegyrici Latini, 8:6; Aurelius Victor, Book of Caesars 39:20-21; Eutropius, Abridgement of Roman History 21; Orosius, Seven Books of History Against the Pagans 7:25.2-4 His forces comprised his fleet, the three legions stationed in Britain and also a legion he had seized in Gaul, a number of foreign auxiliary units, a levy of Gaulish merchant ships, and barbarian mercenaries attracted by the prospect of booty.Panegyrici Latini 8:12 In 293 emperor Constantius Chlorus isolated Carausius by besieging the port of Gesoriacum (Boulogne-sur- Mer) and invaded Batavia in the Rhine delta, held by his Frankish allies, and reclaimed Gaul. A migration of Celts from Britain appeared in the 4th century in Armorica led by the legendary king Conan Meriadoc. They spoke the now extinct British language, which evolved into the Breton, Cornish, and Welsh languages. The Goths who had sacked Rome in 410 established a capital in Toulouse and in 418 succeeded in being accepted by Honorius as foederati and rulers of the Aquitanian province in exchange for their support against the Vandals.O'Callaghan, Joseph. \\"Spain: The Visigothic Kingdom\\". Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Online. Retrieved 17 September 2019. The Roman Empire had difficulty responding to all the barbarian raids, and Flavius A√´tius had to use these tribes against each other in order to maintain some Roman control. He first used the Huns against the Burgundians, and these mercenaries destroyed Worms, killed king Gunther, and pushed the Burgundians westward. The Burgundians were resettled by A√´tius near Lugdunum in 443. The Huns, united by Attila, became a greater threat, and A√´tius used the Visigoths against the Huns. The conflict climaxed in 451 at the Battle of Ch√¢lons, in which the Romans and Goths defeated Attila. After the fall of Rome The Roman administration finally collapsed as remaining Roman troops withdrew southeast to protect Italy. Between 455 and 476 the Visigoths, the Burgundians, and the Franks assumed control in Gaul. However, certain aspects of the ancient Celtic culture continued after the fall of Roman administration and the Domain of Soissons, a remnant of the Empire, survived from 457 to 486. In 486 the Franks defeated the last Roman authority in Gaul at the Battle of Soissons. Almost immediately afterwards, most of Gaul came under the rule of the Merovingians, the first kings of a proto-France. In 507, the Visigoths were pushed out of most of Gaul by the Frankish king Clovis I at the Battle of Vouill√©.Bennett, Matthew (2004). \\"Goths\\". In Holmes, Richard; Singleton, Charles; Jones, Spencer (eds.). The Oxford Companion to Military History. Oxford University Press. p. 367. They were able to retain Narbonensis and Provence after the timely arrival of an Ostrogoth detachment sent by Theodoric the Great. Certain Gallo-Roman aristocratic families continued to exert power in episcopal cities (such as the Mauronitus family in Marseilles and Bishop Gregory of Tours). The appearance of Germanic given and family names becomes noticeable in Gallia/Francia from the middle of the 7th century on, most notably in powerful families, indicating that the centre of gravity had definitely shifted. The Gallo-Roman (or Vulgar Latin) dialect of the late Roman period evolved into the dialects of the O√Øl languages and Old French in the north, and into Occitan in the south. The name Gallia and its equivalents continued in use, at least in writing, until the end of the Merovingian period in the 750s. Slowly, during the ensuing Carolingian period (751-987), the expression Francia, then Francia occidentalis spread to describe the political reality of the kingdom of the Franks (regnum francorum). Geographical divisions Roman Gaul after Diocletian's reorganisation (1886) Before 22 BC Gaul had three geographical divisions, one of which was divided into multiple Roman provinces: #Gallia Cisalpina or \\"Gaul this side of the Alps\\", covered most of present-day northern Italy. It was conquered by the Romans around 121 BC, but was not made a formal province until 81 BC. By the end of the republic, it was annexed into Italy itself. #Gallia Transalpina, or \\"Gaul across the Alps\\", was originally conquered and annexed in 121 BC in an attempt to solidify communications between Rome and the Iberian peninsula. It comprised most of what is now southern France, along the Mediterranean coast from the Pyrenees to the Alps. It was later renamed Gallia Narbonensis, after its capital city, Narbo. #Gallia Comata, \\"free Gaul\\" or \\"long haired Gaul\\", encompassed the remainder of present-day France, Belgium, and westernmost Germany, including Aquitania, Gallia Celtica and Belgica. It had tributary status throughout the second and first centuries BC, but was still formally independent of Rome. It was annexed into the Empire as a result of Julius Caesar's victory in the Gallic Wars in 50 BC. After 22 BC the Romans divided Gallia Comata into three provinces, the Tres Galliae (the 3 Gauls): :::Gallia Aquitania, corresponding to central and western France; :::Gallia Belgica, corresponding to northeastern France, Belgium, Luxembourg, and western Germany; capital at Reims, later Trier :::Gallia Lugdunensis, corresponding to eastern and northern France; capital at Lugdunum (Lyon) The Romans divided these huge provinces into civitates corresponding more or less with the pre-Conquest communities or polities sometimes described misleadingly as \\"tribes,\\" such as the Aedui, Allobroges, Bellovaci, and Sequani (see List of Celtic tribes) but the civitates were too large and in turn were divided into smaller units, pagi, a term that eventually became the modern French word \\"pays\\".Patrick Galliou and Michael Jones, The Bretons, 1991, p. 79. These administrative groupings would be taken over by the Romans in their system of local control, and these civitates would also be the basis of France's eventual division into ecclesiastical bishoprics and dioceses, which would remain in place‚Äîwith slight changes‚Äîuntil the French revolution. Language and culture Roman Bronze Statuette of a Captive Gaul, 2nd Century AD sou\\", 440-450, 4240 mg. In the five centuries between Caesar's conquest and the collapse of the Western Roman Empire, the Gaulish language and cultural identity underwent a syncretism with the Roman culture of the new governing class, and evolved into a hybrid Gallo-Roman culture that eventually permeated all levels of society. Gauls continued writing some inscriptions in the Gaulish language, but switched from the Greek alphabet to the Latin alphabet during the Roman period. Current historical research suggests that Roman Gaul was \\"Roman\\" only in certain (albeit major) social contexts, the prominence of which in material culture has hindered a better historical understanding of the permanence of many Celtic elements. The Roman influence was most apparent in the areas of civic religion and administration. The Druidic religion was suppressed by Emperor Claudius I, and in later centuries Christianity was introduced. The prohibition of Druids and the syncretic nature of the Roman religion led to disappearance of the Celtic religion. It remains to this day poorly understood: current knowledge of the Celtic religion is based on archeology and via literary sources from several isolated areas such as Ireland and Wales. The Romans easily imposed their administrative, economic, artistic (especially in terms of monumental art and architecture) and literary culture. They wore the Roman tunic instead of their traditional clothing. The Vach√®res warrior, 1st century BC, a statue depicting a Romanized Gaulish warrior wearing chainmail and a Celtic torc around his neck, wielding a Celtic-style shield.Ashton, Kasey. \\"The Celts Themselves.\\" University of North Carolina. Accessed 5 November 2017. Surviving Celtic influences also infiltrated back into the Roman Imperial culture in the 3rd century. For example, the Gaulish tunic--which gave Emperor Caracalla his surname--had not been replaced by Roman fashion. Similarly, certain Gaulish artisan techniques, such as the barrel (more durable than the Roman amphora) and chain mail were adopted by the Romans. The Celtic heritage also continued in the spoken language (see History of French). Gaulish spelling and pronunciation of Latin are apparent in several 5th century poets and transcribers of popular farces.Histoire de France, ed. Les Belles lettres, Paris. The last pockets of Gaulish speakers appear to have lingered until the 6th or 7th century. Gaulish was held to be attested by a quote from Gregory of Tours written in the second half of the 6th century, which describes how a shrine \\"called 'Vasso Galatae' in the Gallic tongue\\" was destroyed and burnt to the ground.Hist. Franc., book I, 32 Veniens vero Arvernos, delubrum illud, quod Gallica lingua Vasso Galat√¶ vocant, incendit, diruit, atque subvertit. And coming to Clermont [to the Arverni] he set on fire, overthrew and destroyed that shrine which they call Vasso Galat√¶ in the Gallic tongue. Throughout the Roman rule over Gaul, although considerable Romanization in terms of material culture occurred, the Gaulish language is held to have survived and continued to be spoken, coexisting with Latin. Germanic placenames were first attested in border areas settled by Germanic colonizers (with Roman approval). In the 4th and 5th centuries, the Franks settled in northern France and Belgium, the Alemanni in Alsace and Switzerland, and the Burgundians in Savoie.

History  The town was first known as Nagparitan, the early inhabitants were called Mumburi and known as a wild and fierce people who prevented the Christianized natives from settling in the vicinity. When the Spaniards came to the area, the people staged a revolt, captured the priest and mutilated his body. Because of this incident, the Spaniards change the name of Nagparitan, meaning prohibit, to Nagpartian which means the place of slaughter. In 1903, Nagpartian was then fused with the Municipality of Bangui because of the unstable condition due to low collection of government taxes. On February 28, 1914, by virtue of a legislative act, Nagpartian was renamed Burgos in honor of one of the three martyred priest, Fr, Jose Burgos.

The legend, as handed down from generation to generation, was classically romantic, a gallant heir - warrior fighting for a lady's love. In the early times, there were two prosperous barangays in the present site of the town each one ruled by a powerful chief or datu. They were bitter and mortal enemies. Naslag was the powerful chief of the barangay north of the river while Allawigan was the chief of the south of the river. One day, Allawigan and his warriors went to hunt. Rass, his son, was the bravest among them. During the hunt, Ras followed the deer, which went north across the river. While he was watching the fleeing deer, he saw a beautiful damsel gathering wild flowers on the opposite side of the riverbank. She was Ding, the daughter of Naslag. To help the lady, Ras gathered the most beautiful flowers near him; put them at the head of his arrow and shoot near the lady's feet. Ding looked at the other side of the river and waved her hands. Ras went home happily. Ras begged his father for permission to win Ding for his wife. But because the fathers of Ding and Ras were bitter enemies, the only way he could win her was in the open battle fiercely fought between the two tribes. Ras led his father's warriors. They fought valiant and came out victorious in the end. Ras asked for Ding as a prize but Naslag refused. This angered him and hurled a challenge to the bravest warrior of Naslag in single combat with Ding as prize. The challenge was accepted. The combat was fought and again, Ras was victorious. He brought Ding triumphantly to Allawigan, his father. Thereafter, the people named the two barangays Dingras, after Ras, their valiant warrior ruler, and Ding, his beautiful wife.

Moore began his professional practice in 1965 and is best known for expanding the purview of the country‚Äôs nascent Preservation Movement, from the restoration of historic manor houses to re-purposing urban industrial structures. His first project‚Äì‚ÄìCanal Square, in Washington D.C.‚Äôs Georgetown neighborhood‚Äì‚Äìwas the earliest recognized manifestation of combining an old mercantile building with major new construction. Moore is also known for the Washington Harbour development on the Potomac River in Georgetown, Washington, D.C., the Goh Annex of the Phillips Collection also in Washington, D.C., and the renovation and modernization of the Thomas Jefferson and John Adams buildings of the Library of Congress, the Old Post Office building on Pennsylvania Avenue, and the renovation of Washington D.C.'s tallest residential building, the Cairo Hotel.  Early life  \\"Tanglebank,\\" Arthur Cotton Moore's childhood home. Arthur Cotton Moore spent his early years at ‚ÄúTanglebank,‚Äù his grandparents‚Äô Victorian house off Connecticut Avenue in the Kalorama neighborhood of NW Washington, D.C., now the site of a new People's Republic of China building providing housing for its embassy personnel. Moore‚Äôs maternal grandfather was Admiral Ridley McLean. His father, Captain Charles Godwin Moore, Jr., served during both World Wars. His mother was the granddaughter of Thomas Monroe Gale, whose house in the Kalorama neighborhood is now the Myanmar Embassy. Moore is a relative by marriage of Senator James McMillan of Michigan, Chairman of the 1900 McMillan Commission, which authored the second Master Plan of the National Mall (McMillan Plan). = Education = * 1954 St. Albans School, Washington, D.C. * 1958 Princeton University, A.B. cum laude * 1960 Princeton University School of Architecture, M.F.A.

(1965 to present)  Architecture  = Style = Moore has described his architectural style in his non-preservation work as Modernism with Baroque sensibilities. Some have referred to this style as ‚Äúpost-postmodernism.‚Äù It is a lighter, even an entertaining modern interpretation of the exuberant style that flourished in Europe from the middle of the 17th century to the early 18th century. People are tired of endless grid-crunching, Moore said. Baroque deals with modern design's fear and loathing of the curve - just what I think is missing in modern design. = Notable Projects = * Canal Square in Georgetown, is a landmarked 19th- century warehouse and the former home of the Tabulating Machine Company, a direct precursor of IBM. It was re-adapted with new construction in 1970 at a cost of US$2.5 million. Located alongside the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal in the then-neglected industrial waterfront area, the project repurposed the warehouse by joining it with a sympathetic modern addition, bringing new life to the area. This led to similar programs across the country in a practice that became known as ‚Äúadaptive reuse,‚Äù using existing building equity in a strategic way as an alternative to the devastation brought about by urban renewal and other economic development programs.

A topper in comic strip parlance is a small secondary strip seen along with a larger Sunday strip. In the 1920s and 1930s, leading cartoonists were given full pages in the Sunday comics sections, allowing them to add smaller strips and single-panel cartoons to their page. Toppers usually were drawn by the same artist as the larger strip. These strips usually were positioned at the top of the page (hence their name), but they sometimes ran beneath the main strip. Toppers were introduced by King Features Syndicate during the 1920s, enabling newspaper editors to claim more comic strips without adding more pages. The practice allowed newspapers to drop the topper and place an additional strip or an additional advertisement into the Sunday comics section. They also made it possible to reformat a strip from full-page size to tabloid size.Markstein, Don. Toonopedia In 1904, Frederick Opper drew his And Her Name Was Maud, about the kicking mule Maud, into comic strips, books and animation, but on May 23, 1926, Opper positioned And Her Name Was Maud as the topper to his Happy Hooligan, and it ran along with Happy Hooligan until both strips came to a conclusion on October 14, 1932. On May 16, 1926, Harold Knerr began ', a topper to The Katzenjammer Kids, which ran until two years after his death. By 1936, to avoid any association with Hitler, the dog's name was changed from Adolph to Schnappsy (a.k.a. Schnapps). Knerr's strip was reformatted for reprints in Magic Comics in the early 1940s. Billy DeBeck's topper for Barney Google was Parlor Bedroom and Sink, which evolved into Parlor Bedroom and Sink Starring Bunky and eventually was titled simply Bunky. In the mid-1930s, DeBeck added alongside Bunky a single-panel topper, Knee-Hi-Knoodles, depictions of kids' funny remarks (contributed by readers). Bunky spawned the catchphrase, \\"Youse is a viper, Fagin.\\" A big fan of Bunky was pulp author Robert E. Howard, who liked to quote from the strip, as noted by his friend Tevis Clyde Smith: Spinoffs Characters in toppers sometimes turned up in the main strip, such as Herby appearing in Smitty, and Kitty Higgins joining the cast of Moon Mullins. In a few cases, the topper introduced characters later developed into a successful Sunday page, as happened when Krazy Kat became a spin-off from The Family Upstairs and Roy Crane's Wash Tubbs appeared over J. R. Williams' Out Our Way with the Willets Sunday strip. The Wash Tubbs Sunday strip ran in that format from 1927 until 1933, when Crane launched Captain Easy as a Sunday page (featuring Wash Tubbs as a secondary character). Gene Ahern's topper The Squirrel Cage, which ran above his Room and Board, is notable because of the repetitive use of the nonsensical question, '\\"Nov shmoz ka pop?\\", which was never translated yet became a national catchphrase. As a consequence, The Squirrel Cage is today better remembered than Room and Board, despite its 17-year run. On at least one occasion, a character exited the topper and dropped down into the main strip. This happened on April 17, 1938, when an absent-minded character in the Rosie's Beau topper realized he was in the wrong place and climbed down into the first panel of Bringing Up Father, arriving in the living room of Maggie and Jiggs.Inge, M. Thomas. Anything Can Happen in a Comic Strip: Centennial Reflections on an American Art Form. University of Mississippi Press, 1995. During the 1940s, Snookums ran as the topper above Bringing Up Father. In the final episode of HBO's The Pacific (2010), Robert Leckie (James Badge Dale) is seen reading Snookums. During its long run, Pete the Tramp had several topper strips, as detailed by comic strip historian Allan Holtz: Toppers bottom out In half-page format comics, toppers at times appeared at the bottom; if removed, the remaining comic fit in a third page. Some toppers consisted of only a single panel, an example being those that accompanied Joe Palooka in the mid-1940s. Holtz notes: And further: Some strips continued to supply toppers into the 1960s, and in a few cases even the 1970s.Holtz, Allan. \\"The Stripper's Guide Dictionary Part 1: Sunday Strips\\" August 14, 2007. Maw Green in Little Orphan Annie was the last Sunday strip topper, except for the brief use of the topper parodies Sawdust and The Invisible Tribe in Dick Tracy. Many newspapers in the late 1980s ran Jim Davis' U.S. Acres alongside Davis' own Garfield (also the most popular comic at the time). However, both were stand-alone strips and sold separately (also, unlike most toppers, U.S. Acres also had a daily strip until very late in its run). Some underground and alternative comic artists have used toppers in their work, though not in the context of a Sunday strip. The strip Fat Freddy's Cat appeared as a topper in the underground comic book The Fabulous Furry Freak Brothers. Tony Millionaire's weekly comic strip Maakies is perhaps the only contemporary syndicated strip to run a topper (which appears at the bottom of the main strip and lacks a consistent title). Toppers have also been used in some comics by Chris Ware and Daniel Clowes to mimic the format of a Sunday comics page. A variant of the topper, \\"throwaway\\" panels containing a \\"throwaway gag\\" (inessential to the thrust of the strip) remain common , and allow different formats depending on available space.

Life Boccapecci was made a Cardinal Deacon by Paschal II. At the consistory of 1122, Callixtus named him Cardinal Priest of S. Anastasia.Miranda, Salvador. \\"Boccapecora, Teobaldo\\", Cardinals of the Holy Roman Church, Florida International University \\"The history of the papacy in the early Middle Ages was marked by constantly contested papal elections wherein the various claimants were often proxies for struggles between factions of the nobility\\"Pham, John-Peter. Heirs of the Fisherman: Behind the Scenes of Papal Death and Succession, Oxford University Press, 2004 At the time of the death of Callixtus on 13 December 1124, the city of Rome was divided between the Frangipani, who supported the German Holy Roman Emperor, and the Pierleoni, who led the Roman nobility. Each faction promoted their own candidate for pope. The conclave was held three days later on 16 December. The Cardinals assembled, under the protection of the Pierleoni, in the chapel of the monastery of S. Pancrazio al Laterano attached to the south of the Lateran basilica.Mann, Horace K. (1925) The Lives of the Popes in the Middle Ages, Vol 8, p. 232 Initially, most of the cardinals held for Cardinal Saxo de Anagni (Sasso), Cardinal-Priest of San Stefano in Celiomonte, who was backed by the Pierleoni family. However, support shifted to Cardinal Boccapecci at the suggestion of Jonathas, the Cardinal-Deacon of Santi Cosma e Damiano, a Pierleoni partisan. Boccapecci was then elected, and chose the name Celestine II. Boccapecci had only just been proclaimed pope, the investment ceremony started and the singing of the Te Deum begun when, Roberto Frangipani and a body of armed men broke into the church. Leo Frangipani and the papal chancellor Cardinal Aymeric de Bourgogne proclaimed Lamberto Cardinal Scannabecchi (a man of considerable learning) pope. During the ensuing melee, Cardinal Boccapecci was wounded. Since he had not yet been formally consecrated pope, Boccapecci declared himself willing to resign, which he formally did the next day in order to avoid a schism. The Pierleoni were paid a substantial bribe to concede. Cardinal Scannabecchi was unwilling to accept the throne in such a manner, and he too resigned his position before all of the assembled Cardinals, but was immediately and unanimously re-elected and consecrated on 21 December 1124 under the name Honorius II. It is not clear why someone else assumed Boccapecci's titular seat in 1126. According to historian Salvador Miranda, as Boccapecci was duly elected, he should not be considered an antipope; but as he resigned before being consecrated and enthroned, neither is he listed among the popes.

It was founded by Jose Gabriel Garcia and Emiliano Tejera in 1866 as the Professional Institute, replacing the former Universidad Santo Tom√°s de Aquino, one of the first universities of the Western Hemisphere (Americas), which was founded unofficially by a Papal bull in 1538, officially by royal decree in 1558, and closed in 1822. It was later renamed University of Santo Domingo in 1914. In structure, the school followed the model of the University of Alcal√° de Henares. The university organized its offerings into four schools: Medicine, Law, Theology, and the Arts. Today, the University has expanded to eight schools: Humanities, the Arts, Law and Political Science, Health Sciences, Economics and Social Sciences, Science, Engineering and Architecture, and Agricultural Sciences. History The University traces its foundations to a Dominican seminary established in 1538. This was raised to the status of a university by the Papal Bull In Apostolatus Culmine, issued by Pope Paul III on 28 October 1538, and granted the same rights and powers as the Spanish University of Alcal√° de Henares. It was initially organised in four faculties, following the pattern of medieval European universities: Theology, Law, Medicine and Arts. In 1801, the university was suspended due to the Haitian occupation; it reopened in 1815 after Spanish colonial rule was restored under the rectorship of Dr Jos√© N√∫√±ez de C√°ceres. However, it was forced to close again in 1822 due to the conscription of its students. After the Dominican Republic was established in 1844, an attempt to reopen the university was made by President Pedro Santana in 1859, but this was unsuccessful. In 1866 the Instituto Profesional (Professional Institute) was created by Jose Gabriel Garcia and Emiliano Tejera in Santo Domingo, providing higher education in the city. This was closed in 1891 but reopened in 1895. On 16 November 1914, President Ram√≥n B√°ez (who was also rector of the Institute) raised it to university status under the name \\"University of Santo Domingo\\". This new university was forced to close by the US occupation from 1916 to 1924. After the start of the dictatorship of Rafael Leonidas Trujillo in 1930, the university was unable to operate independently; it was only on 31 December 1961, after Trujillo's death, that a law was passed restoring its autonomy.

The channel operated out of offices in Dallas, Texas, located on Young Street in the city's downtown district. Background The 24-hour channel launched on January 1, 1999, and was founded by its original owner, the Belo Corporation. TXCN combined the news staffs of four television stations in Texas owned by Belo at the time ‚Äì ABC affiliates WFAA in Dallas and KVUE in Austin (acquired from Gannett shortly after this channel's launch), and CBS affiliates KHOU in Houston and KENS in San Antonio ‚Äì in addition to The Dallas Morning News (which was co-owned with TXCN and the four television stations under common ownership until 2008) and the company's Washington, D.C. news bureau. During the first few years on the air, most of the cable operators have aired TXCN on channel 38 as advertised by the channel itself. In addition to rolling news, weather, and sports coverage, TXCN had public affairs, sports-talk, and entertainment news programming. In its early years, the Fort Worth Star-Telegram has called TXCN \\"CNN Headline News with a Texas flavor.\\" When necessary, TXCN would also cover breaking news events outside of Texas, especially during the September 11, 2001 attacks. On December 4, 2004, Belo announced the layoffs of 45 of the channel's 75 staffers. This resulted in the programming on Texas Cable News being scaled down on January 1, 2005. Belo attributed the failure of Texas Cable News to a lack of distribution on cable providers in Texas' largest television markets. From that time until closure, TXCN aired repackaged content from the aforementioned stations in Dallas, Houston, San Antonio and Austin. All original programming, with the exception of weather segments and occasional original programming, was dropped along with on-air talent, except for weather department staff. By April 2009, Belo had further consolidated and downsized operations of TXCN, and the channel's dedicated production and technical facilities, until then located in a building behind the Dallas Morning News building, were vacated. In 2008, Belo decided to split its broadcasting and newspaper interests into separate companies. TXCN remained with the broadcasting side, which retained the Belo Corporation name, while the newspapers (including The Dallas Morning News) were spun off to the similarly named A.H. Belo Corporation. However, the former corporate cousins maintained a news partnership. On June 13, 2013, the Gannett Company announced that it would acquire Belo for $2.2 billion, including TXCN and its sister stations. The deal was granted FCC approval on December 20, and was finalized on December 23.Gannett Completes Its Acquisition of Belo, TVNewsCheck, Retrieved December 23, 2013 On March 3, 2015, WFAA's website announced that TXCN was shutting down after 16 years. A meeting between the owner, Gannett Company, and various cable outlets have agreed to shut down the statewide news channel. After the shutdown, only Time Warner Cable News (renamed Spectrum News as of September 20, 2016) in Austin, Waco and San Antonio are the only 24-hour local or regional news channels left in the state of Texas. It was slated to go off the air on April 1, 2015,TXCN to sign off on April 1 WFAA.com, March 3, 2015. Archived from the original on April 2, 2015. Retrieved August 8, 2020. but the cut-off time was extended to May 1, 2015 at 12:01 a.m. in the Central Time Zone, in which the channel quietly ceased operations after the 11:00 p.m. cycle of the repackaged newscasts. Roger Barry, the last remaining TXCN on-air personality, announced that he was retiring earlier that day. This came at a time when the channel's viewership had decreased in the face of increased news consumption on digital and other non-television platforms, along with the nationwide streaming availability of the newscasts live or delayed of the stations contributing content for the network via their websites, effectively making the entire operation superfluous and duplicative. In addition, the network did not broadcast in HD, which was nearly general for television news in the United States by the time of the shut-down announcement. Website In addition to the network itself, TXCN has maintained a website, which listed headlines and weather reports across the state, sports scores, Texas Lottery results, daily Texas History, programming guide for TXCN's original shows, anchor biographies, and a channel finder. Until April 30, 2015, the webpage remained somewhat active, but many features have gradually shut down since the 2004 staffing cuts, leaving only the news headlines and weather updates from the four aforementioned stations via their websites' RSS feeds, and an outdated channel guide (still listed that DFW was being served by Comcast and Houston being served by Time Warner Cable even though the two clusters switched providers in August 2006). On April 30, 2015, the website was changed to a message explaining that TXCN would be discontinued on May 1, 2015 at 12:01 a.m. in the Central Time Zone. The message also provided a list of all Texas-area Gannett stations‚Äîincluding the recently acquired London Broadcasting assets (now spun off to TEGNA Media as of June 29, 2015) and their corresponding websites.

It was followed by Lagoon Engine Einsatz. The main protagonists are Yen and Jin Ragun. The name \\"Lagoon Engine\\" is derived from the phonetic pronunciation of the main characters' names (Ragun Yen Jin). Volume 6 was released on December 1, 2009. Volume 7 was released in September 2010 in the US.  Plot  Lagoon Engine revolves around two characters: 12-year-old Yen, and 11-year-old Jin. While Yen's intelligent, calm, and thinks tactically, Jin's hotheaded and rushes into battle. The Ragun family is dedicated to defeating ghosts, evil spirits, etc. - known as 'Maga' Yen and Jin just happen to the successors of the family, and they have to fight Maga too. In short: Yen and Jin are Gakushi. Both Yen and Jin have Maga - though not evil maga. Yen's Maga is called Koga, while Jin's maga is named Sora. Koga is good with gathering information, analyzing and remembering things, though he's extremely bad at attacking. Sora has no intellectual power whatsoever, but his attack power is very high.  Characters  ; :Intelligent, and good with making inferences, as is Koga. A good gakushi and often teams up with Jin while fighting maga. As a perception type, he can understand Maga. As shown in the second book, he hates slimy things, so he hates natto (fermented soybeans). He enjoys swimming and he is in the 6th grade, the last grade of elementary. ; :Yen's younger brother. Almost the complete opposite. Hotheaded and rash - seemingly not very bright either. However, he's still loyal to his brother, and loves him very much. He's never quiet and hates peppers. He is just one grade behind Yen as well as age. He calls his brother \\"Yen-nii\\". ; :Ayato is related to Yen and Jin. Apparently, he's their cousin. He knows of Yen and Jin being Gakushi, and isn't bothered by it at all. He's quiet and polite. His nickname is \\"Aya\\". Yen almost thought he was a girl after forgetting what happened when he first encountered him in his house. ;Miki Kirishima :Miki is a girl in Yen's class who has not attended school for two years because of a deadly disease that confines her to a hospital. Her dead dog, Tom, was led back to her by Yen and Jin, and is slowly becoming a maga. Yen thinks she'll become a Gakushi. ;Erei Moribayashi :A friend of the Raguns. Loud, and rather hotheaded. She doesn't seem to know of the Raguns being Gakushi. She's taken a liking to Ayato. ;Shintaro Nagasaku :28, single, and works as an editor for Yen and Jin's mother. He seems to live at the household, and is rather strange. In fact, he likes to wear skirts. But he is very superior when someone is in need of help. ;Akane Ragun (Mari) :Akane is a very popular author. Her works never meet the deadline, but the books still end up being ridiculously popular. Although her true name is 'Akane Ragun', her penname is 'Akane Mari'. She's the mother of Yen and Jin. ;Hideaki Ragun :Hideaki is the husband of Akane Mari and the father of the Raguns. He's a very experienced Gakushi, and extremely powerful. ;Suguru Mikami :Suguru is a gakushi of the Mikami. The Mikami is a 'branch' of the Ragun. He appears to be the silent type at first - strong, cool and collective - but that's not all that there is to him. He hates being called \\"Branch Family\\" and Jin for calling him that. Besides that, it's very possible for Suguru to be nerve- wracked. ;Koga (Maga) :Yen's maga companion. Koga cares for Yen very much, and reflects on Yen: Koga is intelligent, and makes a good team with Sora - Jin's maga. However, Koga lacks in attacking. ;Sora (Maga) :Jin's maga, and also seems to have as much energy as Jin. Sora has no intellectual power whatsoever, but his attack power is very high. ;Shinno Zai :Shinno is assumed to be a Kamen Kugutsushi, which is the enemy of the Gakushi. He attends the same school as Ayato, but Ayato has no idea that Shinno's Yen and Jin's enemy. Not much is known about Shinno. ;Hodou :Hodou is Shinno's servant. He calls him master and does his bidding. He attends the same school as Ayato as well. Not much is known about Hodou, either.  Volume list  Lagoon Engine Einsatz is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Yukiru Sugisaki that has appeared in Newtype USA since October 2004. In July 2005 an announcement was made that ADV Manga would be distributing the series as graphic novels starting November that year; Anime News Network one volume was released. It has been suggested that this series is related in some way to the manga series Lagoon Engine by the same author, but no official statement has been made by the author or publishers to support this idea. =Plot= Scan from Newtype USA Daisuke Kataoka writes of the series, = Characters = *Sakis Snow Herzgil Lagoonaria - Sakis is a 13-year-old girl, a Scion, and Conductor of the Sky Knights.

Hebrew Bible (Torah)  =Book of Numbers= The red heifer ritual is described in the Book of Numbers. The children of Israel were commanded to obtain \\"a red heifer without spot, wherein is no blemish, and upon which never came yoke\\". The heifer is then ritually slaughtered and burned outside of the camp. Cedar wood, hyssop, and wool or yarn dyed scarlet are added to the fire, and the remaining ashes are placed in a vessel containing pure water. In order to purify a person who has become ritually contaminated by contact with a corpse, water from the vessel is sprinkled on him, using a bunch of hyssop, on the third and seventh day of the purification process. The priest who performs the ritual then becomes ritually unclean, and must then wash himself and his clothes in running waters. He is deemed impure until evening.  Mishnah  The Mishnah, the central compilation of Rabbinic Oral Law, the oral component of the written Torah, contains a tractate on the red heifer, Tractate Parah (\\"cow\\") in Seder Tohorot, which explains the procedures involved. The tractate has no existing Gemara, although commentary on the procedure appears in the Gemarah for other tractates of the Talmud. = Details of the commandment = According to Mishnah Parah, the presence of two black hairs invalidates a red heifer, in addition to the usual requirements of an unblemished animal for sacrifice. There are various other requirements, such as natural birth (Caesarian section renders a Heifer candidate invalid).Mishneh Torah, Hilchot Para Adumah 1:7 The water must be \\"living\\" (i.e., spring water). This is a stronger requirement than for a ritual bath. Rainwater accumulated in a cistern is permitted for a mikveh but cannot be used in the red heifer ceremony. The Mishnah reports that in the days of the Temple in Jerusalem, water for the ritual came from the Pool of Siloam. The ceremony involved was complex and detailed. To ensure complete ritual purity of those involved, care was taken to ensure that no one involved in the red heifer ceremony could have had any contact with the dead or any form of tumah, and implements were made of materials such as stone, which in Jewish law do not act as carriers for ritual impurities. The Mishnah recounts that children were used to draw and carry the water for the ceremony, children born and reared in isolation for the specific purpose of ensuring that they never came into contact with a corpse: Various other devices were used, including a causeway from the Temple Mount to the Mount of Olives so that the heifer and accompanying priests would not come into contact with a grave.Mishnayoth Seder Taharoth, translated and annotated by Phillip Blackman, Judaica Press, 2000. According to the Mishnah, the ceremony of the burning of the red heifer took place on the Mount of Olives. A ritually pure kohen slaughtered the heifer and sprinkled its blood in the direction of the Temple seven times. The red heifer was then burned on a pyre, together with crimson dyed wool, hyssop, and cedar wood. In recent years, the site of the burning of the red heifer on the Mount of Olives has been tentatively located by archaeologist Yonatan Adler.Y. Adler, \\"The Site of the Burning of the Red Heifer on the Mount of Olives\\", Techumin, 22 (2002), pp. 537‚Äì542. (Hebrew) =The color= The heifer's color is described in the Torah as adumah (), normally translated as \\"red\\". However, Saadiah Gaon translates this word to Judeo-Arabic as (safra), a word translated to English as \\"yellow\\". In addition, the Quran describes Moses being commanded about a \\"yellow\\" cow (Surat al-Baqara 9.69). To explain this discrepancy, Yosef Qafih (in his Hebrew translation and commentary on Saadiah's work) argues that the Bible requires the cow to have a ruddy light-brown color, which he says is the normal color of a cow. He says this color is in general described as in Hebrew and \\"yellow\\" in Arabic, resolving the discrepancy in the color words. He explains the Biblical requirement to mean that the cow be entirely of this color, and not have blotches or blemishes of a different color.Yosef Qafih, Perushei Rabbeinu Saadiah Gaon al haTorah, footnote to Numbers 19:2 = Jewish tradition = The existence of a red heifer that conforms with all of the rigid requirements imposed by halakha is a biological anomaly. The animal must be entirely of one color, and there is a series of tests listed by the rabbis to ensure this; for instance, the hair of the cow must be absolutely straight (to ensure that the cow had not previously been yoked, as this is a disqualifier). According to Jewish tradition, only nine red heifers were actually slaughtered in the period extending from Moses to the destruction of the Second Temple. Mishnah Parah recounts them, stating that Moses prepared the first, Ezra the second, Simon the Just and Yochanan the High Priest prepared two each, and Elioenai ben HaQayaph, Hanameel the Egyptian, and Yishmael ben Pi'avi prepared one each.Mishna Parah 3:5 The extreme rarity of the animal, combined with the detailed ritual in which it is used, have given the red heifer special status in Jewish tradition. It is cited as the prime example of a ·∏•ok, or biblical law for which there is no apparent logic. Because the state of ritual purity obtained through the ashes of a red heifer is a necessary prerequisite for participating in Temple service, efforts have been made in modern times by Jews wishing for biblical ritual purity (see tumah and taharah) and in anticipation of the building of the Third Temple to locate a red heifer and recreate the ritual. However, multiple candidates have been disqualified. The Temple Institute states, \\"Some opinions maintain that the newer ashes were always mixed together with a combination of the previous ashes. One way of understanding this, is to the view this mixture of old and new ashes as being yet another precautionary measure... Additionally, mixing in the newer ashes we have produced now with those from olden times is a way of connecting through time with the original heifer that was slaughtered and prepared by Moses. As such, in a sense, it is a way of connecting with the level of Moses himself.\\"The Red Heifer, The Original Ashes, The Temple Institute Since the last succession of ashesPharisees and the Sadducees: Rethinking Their Respective Outlooks on Jewish Law, GR Knight - BYU L.

The Biblical archaeologist, 1996 ‚Äì cat.inist.fr =Temple Institute= The Temple Institute, an organization dedicated to preparing the reconstruction of a Third Temple in Jerusalem, has been attempting to identify red heifer candidates consistent with the requirements of Numbers 19:1‚Äì22 and Mishnah Tractate Parah. In recent years, the institute thought to have identified two candidates, one in 1997 and another in 2002. The Temple Institute had initially declared both kosher but later found each to be unsuitable. The Institute has been raising funds in order to use modern technology to produce a red heifer that is genetically based on the Red Angus.http://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/The-quest-for-the-red-heifer-An- ancient-commandment-meets-modern-technology-412065 accessdate= August 15, 2015 In September 2018, the institute announced a red heifer candidate was born saying \\"the heifer is currently a viable candidate and will be examined [to see] whether it possess[es] the necessary qualifications for the red heifer.\\"Prophecy fulfilled after red cow is born at Temple of Israel, NY Post, 9 September 2018Apocalyptic cow: Does the first ref heifer born in Israel portend bad news for us all? (Hebrew), Walla!, 15 September 2018 Quran The second and the longest sura (chapter) in the Quran is named \\"al-Baqara\\" ( \\"the cow\\" or \\"the heifer\\") after the heifer as the commandment is related in the sura. Ibn Kathir explains that according to Ibn Abbas and Ubaydah, it displayed the stubbornness of the Children of Israel, who asked unnecessary questions to the prophets without readily following any commandment from God; had they slaughtered a cow, any cow, it would have been sufficient for them but instead as they made the matter more difficult, God made it even more difficult for them.  Christian tradition  The non-canonical Epistle of Barnabas (8:1) explicitly equates the red heifer with Jesus. In the New Testament, the phrases \\"without the gate\\" () and \\"without the camp\\" (, ) have been taken to be not only an identification of Jesus with the red heifer, but an indication as to the location of the crucifixion. Some believe that the Second Coming of Jesus Christ cannot occur until the Third Temple is constructed in Jerusalem, which requires the appearance of a red heifer born in Israel. Clyde Lott, a cattle breeder, is attempting to systematically breed red heifers and export them to Israel to establish a breeding line of red heifers in Israel in the hope that this will bring about the construction of the Third Temple and ultimately the Second Coming of Jesus.  Ancient Greek mythology  The red heifer was also considered sacred to the Greek god Apollo. They are featured in many myths, including that of the creation of the lyre. In it Hermes steals Apollo's red heifers and then hides them. To escape Apollo's rage, Hermes creates the lyre. Geryon, the mythical three-bodied creature slain by Heracles, had red cattle, according to Pseudo-Apollodorus, which Heracles stole as his tenth labor. Modern-day usage The red heifer is the official mascot of Gann Academy, a Jewish high school located in Waltham, Massachusetts.

Just after dark on the evening of April 4, 2017, Vice Mayor Jessie Ermitanio survived an ambush and shootout while driving on an unpopulated section of road between the Padsan River and the Daquioag Elementary school. The vice mayor's driver Lucky Jesrel Rumbaoa died from the gunshots and his security escort Ricky Florendo and Municipal Council staffer Edralin Arellano were injured. Mayor Agustin had been receiving death threats prior to the shooting and the vice mayor had requested a police escort after he believed he was being stalked when serving as acting mayor in October 2016. On February 4, 2013, the former mayor Salvador Pillos survived an attack by motorcycle-riding gunmen, who shot him while he was inspecting a project. On the afternoon of February 23, 2013, the Barangay Fortuna chairman Alfredo Arce was gunned down by a gunman riding tandem on the back of a motorcycle. Arce was shot in the chest and died on the spot. Demographics In the , the population of Marcos, Ilocos Norte, was people, with a density of .

Innocent III was born in Sezze in the Papal States and died in La Cava, Apulia. He was the last of four antipopes during the pontificate of Alexander III. Biography A member of a family of German origin, he was a cardinal when elected on 29 September 1179, by a faction opposing Alexander, who, in January 1180, relegated Innocent to the southern Italian abbey of SS. Trinit√† in La Cava, where he died. Election In 1179, the enemies of Pope Alexander III (1159‚Äì1181) had successfully forced him to flee Rome, never to return. In his place, the Roman barons set up Cardinal Lando of Sezza as Pope Innocent III on 29 September 1179. They had the support of Holy Roman Emperor Frederick I Barbarossa. Most other European countries supported Alexander III however. Papal claim defeated The main support in Rome for Innocent III was from the powerful Roman Tusculum families, who had set up the two previous antipopes ‚Äì Victor IV (1159‚Äì1164) and his successor, Paschal III (1164‚Äì1168). The brother of the late Victor IV, out of hatred for Alexander III, gave Lando a well-fortified castle at Palombara to defend against Alexander's supporters. A few months later however, Cardinal Hugo successfully bribed the guards to gain the castle. Innocent III and his supporters were then locked up for life in the monastery of La Cava in January 1180.

The Renfrewshire lieutenancy was formed in 1794 when permanent lieutenancies were appointed by Royal Warrant to all the counties of Scotland. The Lord- Lieutenants (Scotland) Order 1996 defined the area of the Renfrewshire lieutenancy as covering the local government districts of Renfrew, Eastwood and Inverclyde - covering the area of the county of Renfrewshire. Later that year, these districts were altered into unitary council areas named Renfrewshire, Inverclyde and East Renfrewshire.

The original Swiss Confederation, from its foundation in 1291 up to 1798, gained only a few French-speaking districts in what is now the Canton of Fribourg, and so the German language dominated. During that period the Swiss vernacular literature was in German, although in the 18th century, French became fashionable in Bern and elsewhere. At that time, Geneva and Lausanne were not yet Swiss: Geneva was an ally and Vaud a subject land. The French branch does not really begin to qualify as Swiss writing until after 1815, when the French-speaking regions gained full status as Swiss cantons. The Italian and Romansch-Ladin branches are less prominent. Like the earlier charters of liberties, the original League of 1291 was drawn up in Latin. Later alliances among the cantons, as well as documents concerning the whole Confederation‚Äîthe Parsons Ordinance of 1370, the Sempach Ordinance of 1393, the Compact of Stans (1481) and all the Recesses of the Diets‚Äîwere compiled in German. Political documents are not necessarily literature, but these pre- Reformation alliances rested on popular consent, and were expressed in vernacular German rather than in clerkly Latin. German branch =Emergence of vernacular literature= First in order of date are the Minnesingers, the number of whom in the districts that ultimately formed part of the medieval Swiss Confederation are said to have exceeded thirty. Z√ºrich then (as now) was the chief literary centre of the Confederation. The two Manesses (father and son) collected many of their songs in a manuscript that has happily come down to us and is preserved in Paris. The most prominent was Master John Hadlaub, who flourished in the second half of the 13th and the first quarter of the 14th centuries. Next we have a long series of war songs, celebrating the victories of the Swiss. One of the earliest and most famous of these was composed by Hans Halbsuter of Lucerne to commemorate the battle of Sempach (1386), not far from his native town. There are other similar songs for the victory of N√§fels (1388) and those of the battle of Grandson and battle of Morat (both 1476) in the Burgundian War. In the 14th century the Dominican friar Ulrich Boner of Bern versified many old fables. More important are the historical chronicles. In the 14th century we have Christian Kuchlmaster's continuation of the annals of the famous monastery of St Gall, in the early 15th century the rhymed chronicle of the war between the Appenzellers and the abbot of St Gall, and rather later in the same century the chronicles of Conrad Justinger of Bern and Hans Fr√ºnd (died 1469) of Lucerne, besides the fantastical chronicle of Strattligen and a scarcely less fanciful poem on the supposed Scandinavian descent of the men of Schwyz and of Ober Hasle, both by Elogius Kiburger (died 1506) of Berne. In the 15th century, too, we have the White Book of Sarnen and the first William Tell song, which gave rise to the well-known legend, as well as the rather later play named the Urnerspiel dealing with the same subject. The Burgundian War witnessed a great outburst of historical ardour in the shape of chronicles written by Diebold Schilling (died 1486) of Bern, by Melchior Russ (died 1499), Diebold Schilling the Younger (d. between 1516 and 1523) and Petermann Etterlin (died 1509), all three of Lucerne as well as by Gerold Edlibach (died 1530) of Z√ºrich, and by Johnanes Lenz (died 1541) of Brugg. In the vernacular, too, are the earliest descriptions of the Confederation, those by Albert von Bonstetten of Einsiedeln (1479) and by Conrad Turst of Z√ºrich (1496), to whom also we owe the first map of the country (1495‚Äì1497). Conrad Gessner. The Swiss humanists wrote in Latin, as did also the Swiss Reformers, at any rate for the most part, though the Z√ºrich Bible of 1531 is an exception. Nicholas Manuel (1484‚Äì1530), a many-sided Bernese, composed satirical poems in German against the pope, while Valerius Anshelm (died 1540), also of Bern, wrote one of the best Swiss chronicles. Aegidius Tschudi of Glarus, despite great literary activity, published but a single German work in his lifetime, the Uralt warhafflig Alpisch Rhaetia sam pt dem Tract der anderen Alpgebirgen (1538) besides his map of Switzerland (same date). Sebastian Munster, who was a Swiss by adoption, published (1544) his Cosmographia in German, the work being translated into Latin in 1550. But the many-sided Conrad Gesner, a born Swiss, wrote all his works in Latin, German translations appearing only at a later date. The first important original product in German was the remarkable and elaborate history and description of Switzerland, issued in 1548 at Z√ºrich by Johannes Stumpf of that town. But Josias Simler, who was in a way his continuator, wrote all his works, theological and geographical, in Latin. Matthew Merian engraved many plates, which were issued in a series of volumes (1642‚Äì1688) under the general title of Topographia, the earliest volume describing Switzerland, while all had a text in German by an Austrian, Martin Zeiller. Very characteristic of the age are the autobiography of the Valais scholar Thomas Platter (1499‚Äì1582) and the diary of his still more distinguished son Felix (1536‚Äì1614), both written in German, though not published till long after. Gradually Swiss historical writers gave up the use of Latin for their native tongue, so Michael Stettler (1580‚Äì1642) of Bern, Franz Haffner (1609‚Äì1671) of Soleure, and quite a number of Grisons authors (though the earliest in date, Ulrich Campell of S√ºs, c. 1509‚Äìc. 1582, still clung to Latin), such as Bartholom√§us Anhorn (1566‚Äì1640) and his son of the same name (1616‚Äì1670) and Johannes Guler von Wyneck (1562‚Äì1637). Fortunat Sprecher (1585‚Äì1647) preferred to write his Pallas raetica in Latin, as did Fortunat von Juvalta (1567‚Äì1654?) in the case of his autobiography. The autobiography of Hans Ardser of Davos (1557-post 1614) and the amusing dialogue between the Niesen and the Stockhorn by Hans Rudolf Rebmann (1566‚Äì1605) are both in German. Jean-Baptiste Plantin (1625‚Äì1697) wrote his description of Switzerland in Latin, Helvetia nova et antiqua (1656), but Johann Jacob Wagner's (1641‚Äì1695) guide to Switzerland is in German, despite its titles Inder memorabilium Helvetiae (1684) and Mercurius Helveticus (1688), though he issued his scientific description of his native land in Latin, Historia naturalis Helvetiae curiosa (1680). =Eighteenth century= Albrecht von Haller In the 18th century the intellectual movement in Switzerland greatly developed, though it was naturally strongly influenced by local characteristics. Basel, Bern and especially Z√ºrich were the chief literary centres. Basel was particularly distinguished for its mathematicians, such as Leonhard Euler (1707‚Äì1783), and three members of the Bernoulli family refugees from Antwerp, the brothers Jakob (1654‚Äì1705) and Johann (1667‚Äì1748), and the latter's son Daniel (1700‚Äì1782). But its chief literary glory was Isaac Iselin (1728‚Äì1783), one of the founders of the Helvetic Society (1760) and of the Economical Society (1777), and author of a treatise on the philosophy of history entitled Geschichte dee Menschheit (1764), and of another on ideal politics, Philosophische und patriotische Trume eines Menschenfreundes (1755), while many of his economical tracts appeared (1776‚Äì1782) under the general title of Ephemeriden der Menschheit. At Bern Albrecht von Haller, though especially distinguished as a scientific writer, yet by his poem Die Alpen (1732) and his travels in his native country did much to excite and stimulate the love of mountain scenery. Another Bernese, Charles Victor de Bonstetten, is a type of the gallicized Liberal Bernese patrician, while Beat Ludwig von Muralt (1665‚Äì1749) analysed the racial characteristics of other nations for the instruction of his fellow-countrymen, his Lettres sur les anglais et les francais (1725) being his principal work. Samuel Wyttenbach (1748‚Äì1830) devoted himself to making known the beauties of his country to its natives, travelling much and writing much about his travels. Gottlieb Sigmund Gruner wrote the Eisgebirge des Schweizerlandes (1760), a work describing the ice-clad mountains of Switzerland, though it is rather a useftil compilation than an original contribution to knowledge, but a decided advance on his fellow Bernese, Johann Georg Altmanns (1697‚Äì1758) Versuch einer historischen und physischen Beschreibung dee helvetischen Eisgebirge (1751). In another department of knowledge a son of Albrecht von Haller, Gottlieb Emmantiel von Haller (1735‚Äì1786), compiled a most useful bibliography of writings relating to Swiss history, the Bibliothek dee Schweizergeschichte (6 vols, 1784‚Äì1787), that is still indispensable to the historical student. Johann Jakob Scheuchzer But in the 18th century Z√ºrich was undoubtedly the intellectual and literary capital of German-speaking Switzerland, and gained the title of Athens on the Limmat. One of its earliest and most famous celebrities was JJ Scheuchzer, who travelled much in Switzerland, and wrote much (his travels are described in Latin) as to its natural curiosities, being himself an FRS, and closely associated with Newton and the other English scientific men of the day. But in the purely literary domain the names of JJ Bodmer and of his friend Johann Jakob Breitinger (1701‚Äì1776), are the most prominent. By their united exertions the antiquated traditions of German literature were broken down to a large extent, while great praise was bestowed on English poets, Shakespeare, Milton and others. Their views were violently opposed by Gottsched, the leader of the Saxon school, and the controversy that arose forms part of the history of German literature. In 1721‚Äì1723 they published jointly the Discourse der Mater, a periodical which spread their views, while more elaborate and systematic expositions of their critical doctrine as to poetry are Bodmer's Kritische Abhandlung von dem Wunderbaren in der Poesie (1740), and Breitinger's Critische Dichtkunst (also in 1740). Their untiring efforts helped to prepare the way for the later outburst of German literature begun by Klopstock, Wieland and Lessing. Another famous Z√ºrich writer was Solomon Gesner, the pastoral poet, and yet another was JK Lavater, now best remembered as a supporter of the view that the face presents a perfect indication of character and that physiognomy may therefore he treated as a science. Other well-known Z√ºrich names are those of JH Pestalozzi (1746‚Äì1827), the educationalist, of Johann Caspar Hirzel (1725‚Äì1803), another of the founders of the Helvetic Society, and author of Die Wirthschaft eines philosophischen Bauers (1761), and of Johann Georg Sulzer (1720‚Äì1779), whose chief work is one on the laws of art or aesthetics, entitled Allgemeine Theorie der sch√∂nen Kunste (1771‚Äì1774). Outside the three towns named above there were several writers of German- speaking Switzerland who must be mentioned. One of the best known even now is Johann Georg Zimmermann (1728‚Äì1795), whose Betrachtungen fiber die Einsamkeit (1756-1784/1785) profoundly impressed his contemporaries. He, like the fabulist AE Erhlich, was born at Brugg. Johannes von M√ºller of Schaffhausen, was the first who attempted to write (1780) a detailed history of Switzerland, which, though inspired rather by his love of freedom than by any deep research, was very characteristic of his times. JG Ebel was a Swiss by adoption only, but deserves mention as the author of the first detailed guidebook to the country (1793), which held its ground till the days of Murray and Baedeker. A later writer, Heinrich Zschokke (1771‚Äì1848), also a Swiss by adoption only, produced (1822) a history of Switzerland written for the people, which had a great vogue. =Nineteenth century= Gottfried Keller In the later literary history of German-speaking Switzerland three names stand out above all others: Albert Bitzius, known as Jeremias Gotthelf from the first of his numerous tales of peasant life in the Emmenthal, Gottfried Keller, perhaps the most genuinely Swiss poet and novelist of the century, and Conrad Ferdinand Meyer, also a poet and novelist, but of more cosmopolitan leanings and tastes. Jakob Burckhardt was a famous writer on Italian art, while Jakob Frey (1824‚Äì1875) continued the work of Bitzius by his tales of Swiss peasant life. Ulrich Hegner (1759‚Äì1840) of Winterthur wrote novels full of local colour, as is also the case with David Hess (painter) (1770‚Äì1843) in his description of a cure at Baden in Aargau and various tales. Johann Martin Usteri (1763‚Äì1827) of Z√ºrich was one of the earliest to write poems in his native dialect. Later we have a number of Z√ºrich poets or versifiers, some of whose writings have become very well known. Such were Heinrich Leuthold (1827‚Äì1879), August Corrodi (1826‚Äì1885) and Leonhard Widmer (1808‚Äì1868), the author of Trittst im Morgenrot daher (1842) (which, set to music by the Cistercian monk Alberic Zwyssig (1808‚Äì1854), is now known as the Swiss Psalm), of Es lebt in jeder Schweizerbrust (1842), and Wo Berge sich erheben (1844). To the Bernese poet, Johann Rudolf Wyss (1782‚Äì1830), whose father, Johann David Wyss (1743‚Äì1818), was the author of the Swiss Family Robinson, we owe the Swiss national anthem, Rufst du mein Vaterland? and the song, Herz, mys Herz, warum so trurig?‚Äîwhile Johann Georg Krauer (1792‚Äì1845), of Lucerne, wrote the R√ºtlilied, Von ferne sei herzlich gegr√º√üet, and Gottfried Keller himself was responsible for O mein Heimatland. Gottlieb Jakob Kuhn (1775‚Äì1845) wrote many poems in the Bernese dialect about the Alps and their inhabitants. Less national in sentiment and more metaphysical are the lyrics of Dranmor, the pen-name of the Bernese Ferdinand Schmid (1823‚Äì1888). Among the chief Swiss writers in the department of belles-lettres, novelists, poets, etc., may be mentioned Ernst Zahn, Meinrad Lienert, Arnold Ott, Carl Spitteler, Fritz Marti, Walther Siegfried, Adolf Frey, Hermann Hesse, Jakob Christoph Heer, Joseph Victor Widmann, and Gottfried Strasser. Isabella Kaiser wrote poems and stories. Johanna Spyri is famous for her children's stories including Heidi, a fictional character living in the Swiss Alps. =Twentieth century= Hermann Hesse The Nobel Prize for Literature was awarded to Carl Spitteler (1919) and Hermann Hesse (1946). Robert Walser was only decades after his death in 1956 recognized as one of the great modern Swiss novelists at the beginning of the twentieth century. Likewise, the revival of the works of travel writer and novelist Annemarie Schwarzenbach had to wait almost 50 years after her premature death in 1942. Friedrich D√ºrrenmatt was a playwright, author of philosophical crime novels and novellas. Max Frisch was also a playwright, but was famous for being considered the greatest Swiss novelist since Walser. Adolf Muschg is an important essayist, Peter Bichsel and Urs Widmer write stories. Other important Swiss writers are Otto F. Walter and his sister Silja Walter. Others worth mentioning are Melinda Nadj Abonji, Sibylle Berg, Erika Burkart, J√ºrg Federspiel, Lukas Hartmann, Thomas H√ºrlimann, Franz Hohler, Zo√´ Jenny, J√ºrg Laederach, Hugo Loetscher, Kurt Marti, Niklaus Meienberg, Gerhard Meier, Milena Moser, Adolf Muschg, Paul Nizon, Erica Pedretti, Martin Suter, Peter Weber, and Markus Werner. Writers after 1990 are Peter Stamm, Lukas B√§rfuss, Christian Kracht and Alex Capus. =Historians= Important Swiss historians include: *Ildefons von Arx (1755‚Äì1833), the historian of St Gall, of which he had been a monk, *J. C.

He was killed in a judicial duel in 1397, the last scion of his ancient house, and left some amatory poems behind him, while one is extant only in a translation by Chaucer, who makes flattering mention of him. In the 15th and 16th centuries many miracle plays in the local Romance dialect were known. The Chronique des chanoines de Neuch√¢tel was formerly supposed to date from the 15th century, but is now considered by many to be a forgery. More individual and characteristic are the romance about Charlemagne, entitled Fierabras le Giant (1478), by Jean Bagnyon, and the poem named Cong√© pris du si√®cle siculier (1480), by Jacques de Bugnin. But the first really prominent personage in this department of literature is Fran√ßois Bonivard (died 1570) who wrote the Chroniques de Geuve that extend down to 1530 and were continued to 1562 by Michel Roset (died 1613). The first Protestant French translation of the Bible was issued at Neuch√¢tel in 1535, its principal authors being Pierre Robert Oliv√©tan and Pierre de Vingle. As a sort of pendant to the Protestant Bonivard, we have the nun Jeanne de Jussie who in her Levain du Calvinisme (c. 1545) recounts the establishment of Calvinism at Geneva, while the noble Pierre de Pierrefleur in his M√©moires does the same in a lighter and less lachrymose style for Orbe, his native district. Naturally the Reformers of the Suisse Romande used French much in their theological and polemical works. Of more general interest are the writings of two Frenchmen who were driven by religious persecutions to end their lives at Geneva‚Äîthe memoirs and poems of Theodore Agrippa d'Aubign√© (1552‚Äì1630), and the historical writings and poems of Simon Goulart (1543‚Äì1628). The great deliverance of Geneva from the duke of Savoy, known as the Escalade (1602), was described in prose by David Piaget (1580‚Äì1644) in his Histoire de l'escalade and celebrated in verse by Samuel Chappuzeau (1625‚Äì1701)--in his Gen√®ve d√©livr√©e, though the narratives of Goulart and that (published officially by the government) attributed to Jean Sarasin (1574‚Äì1632), the author of the Citadin de Gen√®ve (1606), are more laconic and more striking. JB Plantin (1625‚Äì1697), of Vaud, wrote his topography of Switzerland, Helvetia antiqua et nova (1656), in Latin, but his Abr√©g√© de l'histoire g√©n√©rale de la Suisse (1666) in French, while Georges de Montmollin (1628‚Äì1703) of Neuch√¢tel wrote, besides various works as to local history, M√©moires of his times which have a certain historical value. Jean-Jacques Burlamaqui But the 17th century in the Suisse Romande pales before the glories of the 18th century, which forms its golden age, and was, in a large degree due to the influence of French refugees who, with their families, flocked thither after the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes (1685) and settled down there for the rest of their lives. Such was Louis Bourguet (1678‚Äì1743), who, besides his geological works, founded two periodicals which in different ways did much to stimulate the intellectual life of the Suisse Romande; these were the Biblioth√®que italique (1729‚Äì1734), which aimed at making more widely known the results of Italian research, and the Mercure suisse which, first issued in 1732, lasted till 1784, under different names (rom 1738 onwards the literary section bore the name of Journ√©e helvetique), and secured contributions from most of the leading writers of the Suisse Romande of the day, such as Firmin Abauzit (1679‚Äì1767), Abraham Ruchat (1678‚Äì1750), and others. Ruchat is now best remembered as the author (under the pen-name of Gottlieb Kypseler) of an excellent guide-book to Switzerland, the Deuces de la Suisse, which first appeared in 1714 and passed through many editions, the latest being issued in 1778; but his Histoire de la Reformation de la Suisse (1727‚Äì1728) was much esteemed in his day. Another Vaudois historian and antiquary was Charles Guillaume Loys de Bochat (1695‚Äì1754) whose M√©moires critiques sur divers points de l'ancienne histoire de la Suisse (1747‚Äì1749) still form a treasure-house for archaeologists. Yet a third Lausanne man was JP de Crousaz (1663‚Äì1750), who introduced there the philosophy of Descartes, and was, by his books, the master of Gibbon in logic. A French refugee at Lausanne, Jean Barbeyrac (1674‚Äì1744), published in 1712 the Droit de la nature et des gens, a translation of Puffendorf's treatise, with a striking preface of his own. A precursor of Montesquieu and of Rousseau was Jean-Jacques Burlamaqui (1694‚Äì1750) in his Principes du droit naturel et politique (1747 and 1751, issued together in 1763), while the celebrated international lawyer, Emeric de Vattel (1714‚Äì1767), was a native of Neuch√¢tel by birth and descent, and, though he spent most of his life at foreign courts, died at Neuch√¢tel, not so very long after the publication of his famous Droit des gens (1758). Jean-Jacques Rousseau The year 1754 is a great date in the literary history of the Suisse Romande, for in that year Rousseau came back for good to Geneva, and Voltaire established himself at Ferney, while in 1753 Gibbon had begun his first residence (which lasted till 1758) in Lausanne. The earlier writers mentioned above had then nearly all disappeared, and a more brilliant set took their place. But Rousseau, though a Genevese, belongs rather to European than to Swiss literature, as do later Jacques Necker and his daughter, Madame de Sta√´l, Benjamin Constant and Sismondi. Madame de Charri√®re (1740‚Äì1805) was Dutch by birth, but married to a native of Neuch√¢tel. Among her earlier works were two novels, Le mari sentimental (1783), and the Lettres de Mistriss Henley publi√©es par son ami (1784), both of which had a great vogue in their day and paint, from her own experience, the sad results of an unsuitable marriage. More celebrated by reason of the liveliness and acuteness with which the manners of a little provincial town are described are her Lettres de Lausanne (1871), and her Lettres neuch√¢teloises (1784), particularly the second part of a story of the former, entitled Caliste, and published in 1788, for, according to Sainte-Beuve, it was a sort of foreshadowing of the more famous Coninne (1807) of Madame de Sta√´l. Horace-B√©n√©dict de Saussure PH Mallet, a Genevese, who held a chair at Copenhagen, devoted himself to making known to the educated world the history and antiquities of Scandinavia. But more characteristic of Geneva were the efforts of a group of men to spread the cause of natural science by personal investigations in the higher Alps, then but little known. Possibly their interest in such matters had been stimulated by the scientific and psychological speculations of Charles Bonnet. The chief of this school was HB de Saussure one of the founders of geology and meteorology, while his Alpine ascents (undertaken in the cause of science) opened a new world even to non- scientific travellers. The brothers De Luc devoted themselves mainly to questions of physics in the Alps, while S√©nebier, the biographer of Saussure, was more known as a physiologist than as a physicist, though he wrote on many branches of natural science, which in those days was not yet highly specialized. On the other hand, Marc Th√©odore Bourrit, the contemporary of these three men, was rather a curious and inquisitive traveller than a scientific investigator, and charms us even now by his genial simplicity as contrasted with the austerity and gravity of the three writers we have mentioned. Philippe Cyriaque Bridel (1757‚Äì1845), best known as the doyen Bridel, was the earliest of the Vaudois poets by virtue of his Po√®sies helv√®tiennes (1782). But he is better known as the painter of the scenery and people among whom he worked as pastor at Basel, at Ch√¢teau d'Oex, and at Montreux successively. His Course de B√¢le √† Bienne par les vall√©es du Jura appeared in 1802, while descriptions of his travels, as well as of the manners of the natives, local history, and in short everything that could stimulate national sentiment, were issued in a series of periodicals from 1783 to 1831 under the successive titles of Etrennes helv√©tiennes and of Conservateur suisse. His patriotic aim met with great success, while his impressions of his mountain wanderings are fresh and unspoilt by any straining after effect. He was the first writer of the Suisse Romande to undertake such wanderings, so that, with obvious differences, he may be regarded not merely as the forerunner, but as the inspirer and model of later Vaudois travellers and climbers in the Alps, such as Rodolphe T√∂pffer, of Eug√®ne Rambert, and of the last-named's most brilliant pupil, √âmile Javelle (1844‚Äì1883), whose articles were collected in 1886 by the pious care of his friends under the title of Souvenirs d'un alpiniste. Henri-Fr√©d√©ric Amiel As a poet Juste Olivier surpassed Bridel. Nor can we wonder that with the advance of knowledge Bridel's history is found to be more picturesque than scientific. Two Vaudois, Charles Monnard (1790‚Äì1865) and Louis Vulliemin (1797‚Äì1879) carried out their great scheme of translating (1837‚Äì1840) J. von M√ºller's Swiss history with its continuation by Hottinger, and then completed it (1841‚Äì1851) down to 1815. This gigantic task did not, however, hinder the two friends from making many solid contributions to Swiss historical learning. Later in date were Alexandre Daguet (1816‚Äì1894) who wrote an excellent history of Switzerland, while Jean Joseph Hisely (1800‚Äì1866), Albert Rilliet (1809‚Äì1883), and Pierre Vaucher (1833‚Äì1898), all devoted much labour to studying the many problems offered by the early authentic history (from 1291 onwards) of the Swiss Confederation. A different type of history is the work of an honest but partisan writer, the Genevese Jules Henri Merle d'Aubign (1794‚Äì1872), entitled Histoire de la reformation au temps de Calvin (1835‚Äì1878). The Vaudois noble Fr√©d√©ric Gingins-la-Sarra (1790‚Äì1863) represents yet another type of historian, devoting himself mainly to the medieval history of Vaud, but occasionally going beyond the numberless authentic documents brought to light by him, and trying to make them prove more than they can fairly be expected to tell us. Jean Antoine Petit-Senn (1792‚Äì1870) was a thorough Genevese and a biting satirist, a pensive poet, the Genevese La Bruy√®re, as he liked to be called, yet was not fully appreciated until after his death, when his widely scattered writings were brought together. Alexandre Vinet, the theologian, and HF Amiel, the philosopher, in a fashion balance each other, and need only be mentioned here. Jean Jacques Porchat (1800‚Äì1864) was one of the most prominent among the minor poets of the region, very French owing to his long residence in Paris, and best remembered probably by his fables, first published in 1837 under the title of Glanures d'Esope (reissued in 1854 as Fables et paraboles), though in his day his stories for the young were much appreciated. Urbain Olivier (1810‚Äì1888), a younger brother of the poet, wrote many tales of rural life in Vaud, while the Genevese novelist Victor Cherbuliez (1829‚Äì1899) was perhaps the most brilliant of a brilliant family. Fribourg has produced the local novelist Pierre Sciobret (1833‚Äì1876) and the Bohemian poet Etienne Eggis (1830‚Äì1867), and Neuch√¢tel Auguste Bachelin (1830‚Äì1890) whose best novel was Jean Louis, a tale of which the scene is laid in the old-fashioned little village of St Blaise. Another Neuch√¢tel writer, Alice de Chambrier, the poet, died young, as did the Genevese poet Louis Duchosal, both showing in their short lives more promise than performance. Madame de Gasparins (1813‚Äì1894) best tale is Horizons prochains (1857), a very vivid story of rural life in the Vaudois Jura, remarkable for the virile imagination of its descriptions. Edouard Rod the novelist, and Marc Monnier, critic, poet, dramatist and novelist, are the most prominent figures in the recent literature of the Suisse Romande. Amongst lesser stars we may mention in the department of belles-lettres (novelists, poets or critics) Charles Du Bois-Melly, T. Combe (the pen name of Mlle Adele Huguenin), Samuel Cornut, Louis Favre, Philippe Godet, Oscar Huguenin, Philippe Monnier, Nolle Roger, Virgile Rossel, Paul Seippel and Gaspard Vallette. The chief literary organ of the Suisse Romande is the Biblioth√®que universelle, which in 1816 took that title in lieu of Biblioth√®que Britannique (founded in 1796), and in 1861 added that of Revue suisse, which it then absorbed. Amongst historians the first place is due to one of the most learned men whom Switzerland has ever produced, and whose services to the history of the Valais were very great, and abb√© Jean Gremaud (1823‚Äì1897) of Fribourg. The principal contemporary historians are Victor van Berchem, Francis de Crue, Camille Favre, Henri Fazy, B. de Mandrot, Berthold van Muyden and Edouard Rott. More recent authors include Charles Ferdinand Ramuz (1878‚Äì1947), whose novels describe the lives of peasants and mountain dwellers, set in a harsh environment, the poets Blaise Cendrars (born Fr√©d√©ric Sauser, 1887‚Äì1961), L√©on Savary (1895‚Äì1968), Gustave Roud (1897‚Äì1976), Jean- Georges Lossier (1911‚Äì2004), Pericle Patocchi (1911‚Äì1968), Maurice Chappaz (1916‚Äì2009) and Philippe Jaccottet (born 1925), Armel Guerne (1911‚Äì1980) and the novelists Catherine Colomb (1892‚Äì1965), Monique Saint-H√©lier (1895‚Äì1955), Alice Rivaz (1901‚Äì1998), Prix Renaudot winner Georges Borgeaud (1914‚Äì1998), Yvette Z'Graggen (1920‚Äì2012) and Prix Goncourt winner Jacques Chessex (1934‚Äì2009). Gris√©lidis R√©al (1929‚Äì2005) is in a category of her own. Italian branch Stefano Franscini Italian Switzerland is best known by its artists, while its literature is naturally subject to strong Italian influences, and not to any of a strictly Swiss nature. Stefano Franscini (1796‚Äì1857) did much for his native land, especially in educational matters, while his chief published work (1835) was one that gave a general account of the canton. But this is not so thorough and good as a later book by Luigi Lavizzari (1814‚Äì1875), entitled Escursioni net cantone Ticino (1861), which is very complete from all points of view. Angelo Barotho (died 1893) and Emilio Motta represent the historical sciences, the latter contributing much to the Bollettino della Svizzera Italiana (from 1879 onwards), which, though mainly historical, devotes much space to literary and historical matters relating to the canton. The art of novel writing does not flourish in Ticino. But it has produced a great number of poets such as Pietro Pen (1794‚Äì1869), who translated the Swiss national anthem into Italian, JB Buzzi (1825‚Äì1898), Giovanni Airoldi (died before 1900) and Carlo Cioccari (1829‚Äì1891), the two former were lyric poets, and the third a dramatist. Two \\"younger\\" singers are Francesco Chiesa (1871‚Äì1973) and M. A. Nessi. Contemporary poets are Giorgio Orelli (1921-2013) and his cousin Giovanni Orelli (1928-2016), Alberto Nessi (born 1940) and Fabio Pusterla (born 1957). Romansh branch Romansh is spoken by some 1% of Switzerland's 7.4 million inhabitants. It is the smallest of Switzerland's national languages in terms of number of speakers, and has not much to show in the way of literary activity. Fears of the language perishing altogether have spurred certain energetic groups to promote and foster a language revival. The five largest languages in the Romansh family are Sursilvan, Sutsilvan, Surmiran, Puter and Vallader. Puter and Vallader are sometimes grouped together as one language: Ladin. Romansh was standardized in 1982. The unified language, called Rumantsch Grischun, is used by the federal government and the canton of Graub√ºnden, where is it an official language, for administrative purposes. Romansh had a rich oral tradition before the appearance of Romansh writing, but apart from songs such as the Canzun da Sontga Margriata, virtually none of it survives. Prior to the 16th century, Romansh writings are only known from a few fragments. The oldest known written records identified as Romansh before 1500 are: * the W√ºrzburg manuscript (10th century) probably written in the Abbey of Saint Gall, :consists of only the sentence: Diderros ne habe diege muscha, considered as an early form of Romansh, two translations proposed are either: \\"Diderros does not even have ten flies\\" or \\"Diderros has ten flies from this\\", probably meaning that the scribe named Diderros was poorly paid for his work; * the Einsiedeln Homily dates from the early 12th century, a longer piece of writing discovered in 1907, and consists of a fourteen lines, in an early form of the Romonsch dialect, of incomplete interlinear translation (with the original Latin text) of a sermon attributed to St.Augustine; * the M√ºstair linguistic monument dated 1389 and consisting of a fragment of a document about grazing rights on common land in the Val M√ºstair, it is a court testimony in Romansh attested in an otherwise Latin document: Rumantsch Grischun). The emergence of Romansh as a literary language is generally dated to the mid-16th century. The first substantial surviving work in Romansh is a poem in Ladin, the Chianzun dalla guerra dagl Chiaste da M√ºs written in the Put√®r dialect in 1527 by Gian Travers (Johann von Travers, 1483‚Äì1563), though it was not published till 1865. It is an epic poem describing the First Musso war which Travers himself had taken part in. Subsequent works usually have religious themes, including Bible translations, manuals for religious instructions, and biblical plays. The first book printed in it (at Poschiavo in 1552) was the translation of a German catechism, and the next a translation of the New Testament: L'g Nuof Sainc Testamaint da nos Signer Jesu Christ, also at Poschiavo, but in 1560, both works by Jachiam Bifrun/Giachem Bifrun. Most of the works in the Ladin dialects are translations of books of a religious or educational nature. Two years later, in 1562, another writer from the Engadine, Durich Chiampel, published the Cudesch da Psalms, a collection of Romansh church songs in the Vallader dialect. In the Sursilvan dialect, the first surviving works are also religious works such as catechism by Daniel Bonifaci and in 1611, Ilg V√™r Sulaz da pievel giuvan (\\"The true joys of young people\\"), a series of religious instructions for Protestant youths was published by Steffan Gabriel. Four years later in 1615, a catholic catechism Curt Mussament was published in response, written by Gion Antoni Calvenzano. The first translation of the new testament into Sursilvan was published in 1648 by the son of Steffan Gabriel, Luci Gabriel. The first complete translation of the Bible, the Bibla da Cuera was published between 1717 and 1719. The principal writers in the Romonsch dialects, generally the less literary of the two, in the 19th century are Theodor von Castelberg (1748‚Äì1830), a poet and translator of poetry, and P. A. de Latour (about 1811) also a poet, while the best of all poets in this dialect was Anton Huonder, whose lyrics are considered remarkable. Alexander Balletta (1842‚Äì1887) wrote prose romances and sketches, while J. C. Muoth (Giacun Hasper Muoth, 1844‚Äì1906), himself a most typical and characteristic figure, wrote much in prose and verse as regards his native region. In Ladin one of the chief figures was the poet Conradin von Flugi (1787‚Äì1874), who published volumes of poems in 1845 and 1861, but the poems, novels and translations of Gian Fadri Caderas (1830‚Äì1891) are placed above them. Other Ladin poets are Florin Valentin, O. P. Juvalta and S. Caratsch (died 1892), while Peider Lansel (1863‚Äì1943) represents a younger generation. Zaccaria Pallioppi (1820‚Äì1873) also wrote poems, but the excellent Ladin dictionary that he compiled was not published till 1895 by the care of his son. Non- religious writings in Romansh began appearing in the second half of the 19th century in substantial numbers. The literary output of this period often deals with the language itself and is seen as part of the Romansh revival known as the \\"Romansh Renaissance\\". Most literature of the period consists of poetry and short stories praising the Romansh language and usually dealing with topics related to the rural background of the Romansh valleys. Another common theme is the emigration of the so-called \\"Randulins\\", who would spend much of their lives working abroad. In addition, many works were translated into Romansh, generally German writers that were popular at the time. Well-known Sursilvan poets of the time include Th√©odore de Castelberg (1748‚Äì1818), Placidus a Spescha (1752‚Äì1833) or Gion Antoni Huonder (1824‚Äì1867). The best- known Sursilvan poet is Giachen Caspar Muoth (1844‚Äì1906) however, who is often considered the most well-versed Romansh poet of all. His poets and ballads often deal with Romansh itself, such as his most famous work Al pievel romontsch (\\"To the Romansh people\\"):Manuscript of Al pievel romontsch Other Sursilvan writers of the Romansh Renaissance include Caspar Decurtins (1855‚Äì1916), who collected among other things popular legends, ballads, and songs, as well as Giachen Michel Nay (1860‚Äì1920), who described rural life in several novels, Alfons Tuor (1871‚Äì1904), and Gian Fontana (1897‚Äì1935), who are also known for their novels. In addition, the priest Maurus Carnot (1865‚Äì1935) who had grown up in Samnaun but did not speak the Romansh dialect of his hometown, learned Sursilvan in Disentis and later wrote plays, lyric, and short stories dealing with rural life. Finally, Flurin Camathias is the author of several Sursilvan plays, poems, and epics, in addition to having translated numerous works into Romansh. Literary works in Surmiran are comparatively rare, with Alexander Lozza from Murmarera being the most notable one. In the Engadine, the first modern poets include Gian Battista Tschander and Conradin de Flug (1787‚Äì1874). Writers of the Romanticism era include Sim√©on Caratsch (1826‚Äì1891) and Gian Fadri Caderas (1830‚Äì1891), who co-authored some works such as the comedy Ils duos poets. Other well-known poets and songwriters of the period include Andrea Bezzola (1840‚Äì1897), author of the song Ma bella Val, mi' Engiadina, or Gudench Barblan (1860‚Äì1916), author of the song A la lingua materna Another important Engadine figure of the period is Zaccaria Pallioppi (1820‚Äì1873). While he also wrote poems of his own, his main work is the first Ladin dictionary, published by his son in 1895. One of the first female writers is Clementina Gilli (1858‚Äì1942), who translated several major works of European literature and published a few original works as well, using the pseudonym Clio. Other Engadine writers of the Romansh-Renaissance include Schimun Vonmoos (1868‚Äì1940), who wrote poets and short tales in addition to translating, Gian Gianett Cloetta (1874‚Äì1965) or Eduard Bezzola (1875‚Äì1948), who wrote dramas, comedies, and songs or translated them. The best-known Engadine poet is Peider Lansel (1863‚Äì1943) however, who retired at an early age in 1906 and dedicated himself to poetry, becoming one of the first Romansh writers to gain fame outside of his region. His work includes over 200 poems, which were published in several collections in 1907 (Primulas), 1912 (La cullana d'ambras) and 1929 in his principal work Il vegl chalam√™r. In addition, his work includes several anthologies of Romansh poets, such as La musa ladina (1910) and La musa rumantscha (posthumous 1950). Shortly before his death, he became the first Romansh writer to receive the Grosser Schillerpreis. From the 1940s onwards, Romansh writers began to reflect on the widespread economical and social changes of traditional Romansh society and the word of modernity. Andri Peer (1921‚Äì1985) from the Lower Engadine is considered one of the first modern Romansh writers, whose works introduced modern literary trends into Romansh. His modern writing style was initially met with opposition, and he was not fully recognized and appreciated until much later. Another Engadine writer of this literary movement is Cla Biert (1920‚Äì1981), who became known for his humorous short stories. Notably Sursilvan writers include Flurin Darms (born 1918) for his lyrics, and Gion Battesta Sialm (1897‚Äì1977) and Guglielm Gadola (1902‚Äì1961) for their short stories. One of the more famous contemporary novelists is Toni Halter (1914‚Äì1986), who treated historic or rural themes in his works. Also known for his novels and short stories is the Sursilvan writer Gion Deplazes (born 1918). The Engadine writer Jon Semadeni (1910‚Äì1981) is the author of several theater plays and sketches, in addition to writing some prose as well. Also known for their plays are Men Gaudenz and Tista Murk (1915‚Äì1992) from the Val M√ºstair and Carli Fry (1897‚Äì1956) from Surselva. More recently, the Sursilvan writer Arno Camenisch (born 1978) gained attention outside the Romansh community for his novels and short stories, including the bilingual Romansh- German book Sez Ner. Concerning children and young-adult books, some original works have been written in Romansh alongside a large number of translations. The most famous of these are the books of Selina Ch√∂nz, whose book Uorsin has become famous well outside of Switzerland in its German version Schellenursli. Other authors include Clo Duri Bezzola (Kindels dal malom), G√∂ri Klainguti (Linard Lum), Linard Bardill (Il guaffen gelg), G. Netzer (Martin steiler, Annina, La princessa loscha), Theo Candinas (La fuigia dil Stoffel) or Claudia Cadruvi (Capuns ed il stgazi dals Franzos). Drama was represented by biblical plays, most notably the Passiuns sursilvanas (developed in 17th‚Äì18th century). From the 18th century, courtroom dramas based on criminal cases were added to the village repertoire. In the early 20th century, many villages would stage an annual vernacular comedy. Jon Semadeni established the La Culissa theatrical touring company in 1944. His drama Il p√∂vel cumada, which was first staged in 1946, is considered a landmark in Romansh drama. The company ceased touring in 1977. From the 1940s onwards, Romansh writers consciously attempted to assimilate influences from international literary movements, as well as reflecting the situation of traditional Romansh culture as a disappearing way of life in a world of modernity and change. In 1946, a Romansh writers‚Äô union was established by Artur Caflisch and Jon Guidon, known since 2004 as ULR (Union for Romansh Literature). The Romansh writers are organized in the writer's union Uniun per la Litteratura Rumantscha established in 1946, which organizes since 1990 the yearly event Dis da Litteratura an annual Romansh literary festival has been held. Most writers today write in their regional dialect, while the pan-regional variety Rumantsch Grischun is seeing increased use in works done by the Lia Rumantscha such as translations of children's books. Other writers include: Maurus Carnot (1846‚Äì1935), Giachen Michel Hay (1860‚Äì1920), Gian Fontana (1897‚Äì1935), Leza Uffer (1912‚Äì1982), Armon Planta (1917‚Äì1986), Gion Luregn Derungs, Gion Deplazes (born 1918), Cla Biert (1920‚Äì1981), Andri Peer (1921‚Äì1985), Martin Suter, Tim Krohn. Statistics In the 2000s, Swiss production of books fluctuated between 10,000 and 12,000 titles per annum. In 2007, the Swiss National Library recorded a total of 11,410 new titles produced by Swiss publishers. Of those, 6,631 were in German, 2,509 in French, 361 in Italian and 21 in Romansh; the rest being multilingual or in other languages. Taking all the languages combined, 1,983 new titles were in the field of literature proper. Other principal fields were musical publications (1,076 titles), the arts (1'019 titles), law (949 titles), religion (948 titles), languages (467 titles), technology (446 titles), geography (412 titles) and history (409 titles). 410 titles were translated from English, 200 from German and 157 from French. Books originating in 31 languages were translated into one or another of the national languages by Swiss publishers.

It is the burial place of the Ancient Egyptian royal family of Amarna, which reigned during the 18th Dynasty. The cemetery is a local parallel to the Valley of the Kings. There has been a great deal of work to ease access to the Royal Tomb of Akhenaten, and to protect the tombs from damage by flash flooding. The wadi can now be journeyed along on a metalled road, and the tomb is protected by a covering and channels to divert water away from its entrance. The angle of the entrance and descent allows sunlight (Aten) to reach all the way down to the burial chamber, however the tomb is unfinished and had it been finished at the time, sunlight would not have been able to reach the chamber. In the wadi itself, there are five tombs, the Royal Tomb of Akhenaten, three unfinished tombs in a side wadi, and what seems to be a cache, near to the Royal Tomb. Royal Tomb The Royal Tomb (Tomb 26) is the only decorated tomb, and contained the burial of the 18th Dynasty Pharaoh Akhenaten. It includes a suite of chambers for his daughters, his mother and probably Nefertiti, although she was never buried there. Tomb 27 The next of the tombs, Tomb 27, seems to have been intended for a Royal Burial, as the doorway and entrance are of a similar size to that of the Royal Tomb. However, it was never finished and no burial material has ever been found. It may have been intended for the burial of Akhenaten's successor. Tomb 28 This is the only finished tomb in the Wadi. It may have been used by a lesser wife of Akhenaten, perhaps Kiya and their child Baketaten (if she was their child and not a sister of Akhenaten). Tomb 29 This tomb was plastered, but never decorated. It consists of four corridors, and in plan is similar to the suite of rooms in the Royal Tomb of Akhenaten, and may have been intended for a lesser Royal Wife. A docket found in this tomb refers to a Year 1, so the tomb must have been open in the time of Akhenaten's successors.

It means salt making, customarily done during summer and became the leading industry among the coastal folks in the municipality.

Davila is a coastal barangay of Pasuquin, and their main harvest is dumadara (a certain fish). They associated the festival to the Blessed Virgin Mary, whom the Month of May is dedicated, as a thanksgiving for a bountiful fishing. Fisherfolks from Davila are made to decorate their bangkas (boats) for the fluvial parade. There are many activities hold also during the festival like boat race, and eating delectable grilled fish (Dumadara)with the guests. =Holy Week Celebration= The coastal town of Pasuquin celebrates its Holy Week with much religiosity and solemnity. The celebration starts on Palm Sunday (Domingo de Ramos) and ends on Easter Sunday (Domingo de Pascua). Each year, townspeople from all walks of life come together to celebrate the Most Holy Passion and Death of our Lord.

It matched the East division champion St. Louis Cardinals (95‚Äì67) against the West division champion San Francisco Giants (90‚Äì72), with the Cardinals winning in seven games. The Cardinals would go on to lose the 1987 World Series to the Minnesota Twins, also in seven games. San Francisco's Jeffrey Leonard was named the Series MVP despite the fact that his Giants lost the series. Oddly enough, this was the second consecutive year that the NLCS MVP came from the losing team, as Mike Scott had won the award with the Houston Astros the previous year. However, to date, Leonard is the last MVP of any postseason series (League Championship Series or World Series) to have played for the losing team. There is no MVP awarded for the wildcard round or division series.  Summary  = St. Louis Cardinals vs. San Francisco Giants =  Game summaries  = Game 1 = Tuesday, October 6, 1987, at Busch Stadium (II) in St. Louis, Missouri The Giants struck first on an RBI groundout by Candy Maldonado, but the Cardinals tied it in the third on Vince Coleman's RBI single. Jeffrey Leonard gave the Giants a short-lived lead in the fourth on a homer, as the Cards quickly re-tied it when Ozzie Smith tripled and Willie McGee drove him home with a single. The Cardinals took control of the game in the sixth by plating three runs off Giants starter Rick Reuschel. Terry Pendleton, Curt Ford, and pitcher Greg Mathews all had RBI singles in the rally. Ken Dayley pitched the ninth and got the save. = Game 2 = Wednesday, October 7, 1987, at Busch Stadium (II) in St. Louis, Missouri The Giants pulled even in the series on the strength of a complete-game shutout by Dave Dravecky. Dravecky got all the runs he needed in the second on a Will Clark two-run homer. Jeffrey Leonard added a homer in the fourth, his second in two NLCS games. Two more runs came across in the eighth for the Giants on a rare Ozzie Smith throwing error. It was in this game that Leonard aroused the ire of the Cardinal fans by going into his \\"Cadillac home run trot\\" around the bases. Leonard spread out his arms, airplane-style, but kept his left arm pinned to his side (\\"flap-down\\"). To further irritate the fans, Leonard slowed to a walk between third and home. = Game 3 = Friday, October 9, 1987, at Candlestick Park in San Francisco In Game 3, Joe Magrane (STL) and Atlee Hammaker (SF) were set to face off. The matchup was not expected to be quite as low scoring as the series had been to date. The predictions were correct, as San Francisco broke first with four runs in the first three innings, looking to take the series lead. In the second inning, consecutive hits from Chili Davis, Will Clark and Bob Brenly put the Giants on the board. Yet another home run from Leonard tacked on a fourth run in the third. On Leonard's next at-bat, however, Bob Forsch, who had relieved starter Magrane, plunked Leonard in the left shoulder with his first pitch, presumably in retaliation for his home-run trot antics. The Giants would load the bases in the inning with one out, but Forsch pitched out of it. The Cardinals heated things up in the sixth with a two-run home run from Jim Lindeman, who replaced the injured Jack Clark, and then a triple by Willie McGee. But, in the seventh is when they really made their attack, not only tying the game, but scoring four to take the lead, 6‚Äì4. The four runs came on a large rally, highlighted by a two-run single by left fielder Vince Coleman. With right-handed Todd Worrell pitching for the Cards, manager Roger Craig pinch hit left-handed batter Harry Spilman for Robby Thompson. Spilman homered to right field, putting new life back in the Giants, even with two down. However, third baseman Kevin Mitchell flew out to center field, and the Cards had completed a stunning comeback. Cardinals slugger Jack Clark made his only appearance in the Series in Game 3. Nursing a sprained ankle, he came up as a pinch-hitter and struck out looking. His injury caused him to be left off the roster for the World Series, so the Cardinals could add another pitcher. = Game 4 = Saturday, October 10, 1987, at Candlestick Park in San Francisco The Giants knotted the series at 2‚Äì2 by the longball and another complete-game pitching performance, this time by Mike Krukow. Krukow was touched for two runs in the second on RBI singles by opposing pitcher Danny Cox and Vince Coleman, but then pitched shutout ball the rest of the way. Robby Thompson hit a homer in the fourth, Jeffrey Leonard put the Giants ahead 3‚Äì2 in the fifth with his fourth homer in the NLCS, and Bob Brenly closed out the scoring with a shot in the eighth. = Game 5 = Sunday, October 11, 1987, at Candlestick Park in San Francisco Tom Herr put the Cardinals up 1‚Äì0 in the first off Rick Reuschel with a sacrifice fly, then the Giants tied it in their half of the first on a Kevin Mitchell RBI single. The Cardinals looked on the verge of breaking it open against Reuschel in the third. Tony Pe√±a and pitcher Bob Forsch led off the inning with consecutive singles, and then Vince Coleman beat out a bunt, loading the bases with none out. Ozzie Smith could only produce a sacrifice fly, however, and Herr bounced into a double play to end the threat. Mitchell tied it at 2‚Äì2 for the Giants in the third on a homer. Terry Pendleton then gave the Cards back the lead in the fourth in this nip-and-tuck game by smashing a two-out triple and scoring when Reuschel mishandled a throw by Will Clark on a ground ball hit by John Morris. The Giants answered back in the bottom of the fourth when Jose Uribe drove in two runs with a bases-loaded single for a 4‚Äì3 Giants lead. Mike Aldrete then pinch-hit for Reuschel and hit a sacrifice fly and Robby Thompson drove in the last run with a triple. Joe Price then relieved Reuschel and pitched five innings of one-hit, shutout relief. Thompson's RBI would be the last Giants run of the series. = Game 6 = Tuesday, October 13, 1987, at Busch Stadium (II) in St. Louis, Missouri Facing elimination, the Cardinals rolled out their ace, John Tudor, to face Dave Dravecky once again. Tudor was injured for most of the first half of 1987, but rebounded to go 10‚Äì2 in the second half of the season. And, like his great 1985 season, Tudor was golden in the postseason. He scattered six hits in seven innings and struck out six before giving way to Todd Worrell. Tudor got the only run he needed in the second inning when Tony Pe√±a hit what appeared to be a routine fly ball to right, but Candy Maldonado misplayed it and it fell for a triple. Jos√© Oquendo then drove Pena home with a sacrifice fly. Ken Dayley pitched the ninth for his second save of the series. = Game 7 = Wednesday, October 14, 1987, at Busch Stadium (II) in St. Louis, Missouri The Cardinals gave starter Danny Cox a quick 4‚Äì0 lead by jumping on Giants starter Atlee Hammaker in the second. Singles by Terry Pendleton, Tony Pe√±a and Willie McGee produced the first run and Jos√© Oquendo, who had hit only one home run during the regular season, drilled a three-run shot to left. St. Louis added two more runs in the sixth on a two-run single by Tommy Herr. Cox went the distance, scattering eight hits and striking out five. The victory gave the Cardinals their third pennant in six years and 15th overall. The only downside in the victory was Pendleton suffering a strained ribcage while running the bases, which limited his availability in the World Series.

History Vintar derived its name from the Ilocano word, \\"intar\\", which used to describe the formation or order taken by the subject from their ruler whenever the chief called them to attention. It is said that a visiting Spanish missionary heard the word and added the letter V, referring to the ‚ÄúV‚Äù formation that the missionary saw. The town's earliest settlers are believed to be of Malay in origin. They first settled on a hill overlooking the Bislak. The town was founded by the Spanish missionaries who got lost in the woods while hunting between Sarrat and Piddig. Vintar became a visita of Bacarra but it was later established as a Parish of San Nicolas de Tolentino. Earlier in 1763, Vintar was reverted to a visita until it became independent in 1774. In 1903, Vintar was annexed as a barrio of Bacarra. It gained its separation and independence in 1909. The town is also home to one of the biggest convents in the Province of Ilocos Norte. In 1931, an earthquake partially destroyed its church and convent. Five years later, it was restored. The convent which houses the Saint Nicolas Academy was restored in 1982. Vintar celebrates the feast of St. Nicholas every 10 September- a religious tradition inherited from the Augustinians lives that still practice the distribution of ‚Äútinapay ni San Nicolas‚Äù (unleavened bread).

History Logo After noticing the success of Palace on Wheels, the Maharashtra state decided to have such a train, in order to develop the tourism industry in the state and surrounding regions. This resulted in Maharashtra Tourism Development Corporation (MTDC) along with Indian Railway started the project. On 17 January 2004, then Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee flagged off the train with remote control from the Raj Bhavan in Mumbai at 5.30 pm. The ceremonial inaugural run took from Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus (CST) railway station to Thane and back. The train kicked off its maiden commercial journey on 4 February 2004. At that time MTDC has appointed the Taj group of Hotels to manage the food and beverage and housekeeping on the luxury train. The train had 36 Taj staffers on board. The Deccan Odyssey planned to operate for 35 weeks each year. It starts from Mumbai CST every Wednesday evening and returns the following Wednesday morning. From Mumbai, it will take off to Ratnagiri, Sindudurg, Goa, Pune, Aurangabad, Nashik. In 2004, the Maharashtra government stopped its run of the Deccan Odyssey, citing poor response, but restarted it after the monsoon season. Later MTDC started giving the train on lease to tour operators like Luxury Train, Thomson Cook (India), which changed the name of the train to Indian Maharaja and resulted in a petition filed by Harshad Gawade, a local tour operator from Sindhudurg in the Bombay high court. From December 2010, The Deccan Odyssey train, taken on charter from Government of Maharashtra started with an aim to have a journey across four Sikh takhts, with a flight by devout and sightseers to the fifth Takht (Takht Sri Patna Sahib).
