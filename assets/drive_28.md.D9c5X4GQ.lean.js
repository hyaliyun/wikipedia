An effective frigate captain he made a number of small captures, but did not see action in any major fleet clashes, until he was present at the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805. He played an important role in relaying signals before the battle, and in towing dismasted British ships to safety afterwards. He had a largely uneventful career thereafter, rising through the ranks and eventually dying a vice-admiral. Early life Little is known about Dundas's early life, but he appears to have been born in or around 1765, and to have joined the navy in 1778, during the American War of Independence. He was promoted to lieutenant on 15 July 1793, shortly after the outbreak of the French Revolutionary War, with one of his earliest commands being the sloop . His next promotion was to commander on 2 September 1795, and he was then raised to post-captain on 9 July 1798. Dundas received command of the 20-gun sixth rate shortly afterwards and in 1799 he captured a valuable Spanish whaling ship. In March 1799 he captured a Spanish warship, the Urca Cargadora, pierced for 26 guns, but only mounting 12. He was then moved to , and escorted a convoy of merchantmen to the Mediterranean, returning to Britain on 2 July 1802. Frigate captain With the end of the Peace of Amiens in 1803 Dundas returned to sea in 1804 in command of the 36-gun fifth rate . He was initially assigned to patrol off the west coast of Spain and in the English Channel, where he captured several prizes. In late 1804 he captured a Spanish ship worth over 200,000 dollars, and also helped in the capture of the privateers Fanny and Superb. The Naiad was also involved in an engagement in the Bay of Gibraltar with a flotilla of Spanish gunboats. In mid-August 1805 Dundas had a narrow escape when he came across a large fleet off northern Spain, which challenged the Naiad using British codes. This was in fact the combined fleet under Pierre-Charles Villeneuve, heading for Ferrol. Naiad managed to escape, evading fire from the lead French frigates, and on 20 August Dundas fell in with Vice-Admiral Sir Robert Calder's squadron, on its way to blockade Ferrol. Calder's force was then sent on to join the ships blockading the combined fleet in Cadiz under Vice-Admiral Cuthbert Collingwood, and Dundas used his time here to harass enemy supply ships. With the arrival on 28 September of Vice-Admiral Horatio Nelson to take command of the fleet, the main British force withdrew over the horizon. Nelson deployed his frigates, including Dundas's Naiad, and several ships of the line to provide a line by which the enemy fleet could be observed and signals transmitted back to him. When the combined fleet put to sea on 19 October Naiad was third in the line, between the frigate and the 74-gun third rate . As the combined fleet approached the British over the next couple of days, Naiad and the other frigates shadowed it, reporting on its movements. Nelson and Trafalgar As the two fleets came within sight on the morning of 21 October, Nelson summoned the four frigate captains, Dundas of the Naiad, Prowse of the , Blackwood of the and Capel of the , to come aboard his flagship . There they received their orders for the battle, which were to take station windward of the Victory and so repeat his signals to the rest of the fleet. They were also to observe the progress of the battle, report on escaping ships, take over surrendered enemy ships that had not been taken and take in tow dismasted British ships or their prizes. They then all went below and witnessed Nelson's will. The Naiad duly remained out of the general melee, did not open fire, and sustained no casualties. After the battle she took William Hargood's damaged and dismasted in tow. =Towing the Belleisle= Naiad tows the Belleisle towards Gibraltar, 23 October 1805. A jury rig is visible on the battered Belleisle, while Naiad carries a full spread of canvas. Dundas's most significant challenge of the battle was navigating both the Naiad and the crippled Belleisle through the rising storm to the safety of Gibraltar. By 22 October they had lost contact with most of the rest of the fleet, but Dundas persevered, several times having to haul the ships off the coast as strong winds threatened to drive them onshore. Better weather on the morning of 23 October allowed Dundas to make more sail, but the return of the gale in the afternoon placed both ships in difficulties. During the afternoon the crews had a fright when a ship-of-the-line was spotted speeding up from the south. At first it seemed that it could be one of the squadron that had escaped from Trafalgar under Pierre Dumanoir le Pelley, but after an exchange of signals the mystery ship was revealed to be , rushing northwards to join the fleet. Naiad and Belleisle battled the weather for the rest of the day; several times the tow rope snapped, but it was reattached by the Naiad sailing close enough to the unmanageable hulk of the Belleisle for a rope to be thrown across, as the sea was too rough to risk launching boats. At 1940 that evening the two ships collided, damaging Naiads jolly boat and smashing away most of the starboard quarter gallery. Dundas was eventually forced to haul away from the Belleisle as night fell, and try to save his own ship. During the night the Naiads larboard topsail sheet blew away, and the reefed topsail sheet was split. The crew were forced to cut away the other sheet to save the yard, but the sheet blew away in the gale. Shortly afterwards the fore topmast staysail was blown to bits. Belleisle was also in a desperate situation, blown almost onto the breakers of the Spanish coast before her crew managed to wear her around. With difficulty she survived the night, and was found when the light came the next morning by Dundas, who had a line reattached. He steered straight for Gibraltar, and came within sight of the rock by midday, despite having been fired on by the Spanish battery at Tarifa. Dundas took Naiad in and anchored at 1330 that afternoon, while the Belleisle was warped into the mole. Dundas subsequently was awarded a sword from the Lloyd's Patriotic Fund for his services at Trafalgar. Later years Dundas remained in command of Naiad until 1808, serving in the blockade of Rochefort. Dundas went on to command the 64-gun , another Trafalgar veteran, and the 74-gun . He commissioned on 28 March 1822, and was stationed at Plymouth. During his career Dundas is said to have invented a type of inflammable ball, > ... applicable for besieging a town, and peculiar for its small weight, by > which means may be thrown to a great distance; and it takes fire on a very > curious plan: it spreads a flame on three distinct openings, which is so > strong, that the fire extends a full yard in length from the ball itself, > and is so powerful, that anything under, over, or near, cannot escape its > effects. Dundas was advanced to rear-admiral on 27 May 1825, vice-admiral on 10 January 1837 and appointed and invested as a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath on 13 September 1831. He died in Reading, Berkshire on 29 March 1841. The sword he received for Trafalgar is currently held in the collections of the National Maritime Museum.

It stars Kevin Costner, Ivana Baquero and Samantha Mathis. Based on the short story of the same name by John Connolly, it tells the story of a novelist and his two children who encounter a malevolent presence when they move to a house in the country adjacent to a burial mound. Plot John James (Kevin Costner), a recently divorced novelist, moves into an old house in rural South Carolina with his teenage daughter, Louisa (Ivana Baquero), and young son, Sam (Gattlin Griffith). John and Louisa's relationship is strained; she accuses him of having never loved her mother and ruining everything. On the family's first night in the house, Louisa hears strange noises outside her bedroom window. Unseen by her is a humanoid creature lurking outside on the roof. The following day, while exploring the surrounding fields and forest, the children come across a large mound. Louisa is instantly attracted to it, but Sam is reluctant to go near it. In town, John learns that his house is locally infamous for the disappearance of a woman who lived there. Upon returning home, he finds Louisa's pet cat mutilated near the house. Louisa returns to the mound after school and, while relaxing in the sunshine, hears strange noises. As Louisa hears what sounds like approaching animal growls, the film jump-cuts to John cutting his hand while washing dishes. That night John finds a trail of muddy footprints leading from the open front door to the bathroom. Louisa is inside with the door locked, sitting in the tub as the shower washes her extremely muddied body. The muddy water is shown turning red with blood as it reaches the drain. Later that night, John finds Louisa sleepwalking. When he takes her back to bed, he finds a strange doll made from straw, inside which is a dark ball containing a live spider. The next morning Louisa comes down for breakfast wearing a short black dress and make-up. When John asks her about the doll, she claims not to have seen it. Louisa is bullied by a preppy girl in the staircase of their school. Meanwhile, at home, John comes across a pile of muddy clothes in her bedroom. While investigating outside the house, he finds the head of Louisa's doll at the mound, and the bloody remains of a blackbird. John is called to come to pick up Louisa, who says she does not feel well. In the infirmary he passes the preppy girl, who had apparently \\"fallen\\" down the stairs and injured her arm. Sam's teacher, Cassandra (Samantha Mathis), gives John her phone number, offering her friendship. He is later startled to find a nest of spiders in the kitchen drawer where he'd placed the straw doll. That night John sees Louisa emerging from the woods, even though he had previously ordered her to be home by dark. He calls attention to scarring visible on the skin around her neck, but Louisa storms off without explanation. At dinner she eats in an animal-like manner, as if starved. John contacts Cassandra one night, and they meet socially. While John is away, Louisa hears noises outside the house and exits. As John is returning home in his car, he sees a shadowy figure, which vaguely looks like Louisa, running through the woods in front of the house. He exits his car and follows sounds of animal growls, but growing fearful, he rushes back to his car. A stone hits his window and he speeds back to the house. Asking Louisa if she'd been outside, she says no. He orders her not to go near the mound any more. The next day, John's agent drives up to the house and they talk about the house. Inside, Sam is directed by Louisa to climb the ladder to the attic. Sam falls when frightened by animal noises there. He requires stitches, and John berates Louisa for not caring for her younger brother. That night, John searches the internet, finding an article about burial mounds. He telephones an expert on the subject, Professor White (Noah Taylor), but is ignored. He then researches the previous owner of the house, Sarah Wayne; she disappeared one day without a trace, after having locked her teenage daughter Emily in her bedroom from the outside. Emily was eventually found alive and went to live with her grandfather, Roger Wayne (James Gammon). John leaves the children with a babysitter, Mrs. Amworth and goes to find Roger Wayne. As Louisa watches him drive away from her window, scarring can be seen on the nape of her neck. She then returns to the mound. John arrives at Roger Wayne's empty house, but lets himself in and looks around. In the girl's room he finds a strange nest made from twigs and straw, and a depiction of the burial mound drawn onto a wall with the word \\"home\\" below it. Roger arrives and confronts John with explanations of what had occurred with Emily, that he burned down his house with her inside, insisting that it wasn't his granddaughter anymore. While John is away, Mrs. Amworth is locked out of the house, and animal growls are heard approaching. Sam hides in his room as he hears the babysitter's cries for help. John arrives home, comforts a frightened Sam, and rushes to Louisa to ask what happened to the babysitter. She says she does not know. After reporting the babysitter's disappearance to police, John takes an ill Louisa to bed. She tearfully asks if he's going to leave her as her mother did. He tells her he never will. That night, John dreams of a doorway on top of the burial mound and Louisa transforming into a creature who announces \\"I'm your new daughter\\". The next day he finds a nest in Louisa's closet similar to the one at Roger's house. John calls a contractor to destroy the mound that day. Professor White, having called back to ask about the mound, suddenly arrives and pleads with John to wait. He tells John of an ancient civilization who worshiped the burial mounds, believing them to be the homes of ancient Gods, or \\"mound-walkers\\". He mentions a ritual exchange of gifts ‚Äî including small straw dolls, as John had found ‚Äî and the mound-walkers' search for a young girl with whom to mate and give birth to a new generation of deities to reclaim the earth. Horrified by this, John instructs the bulldozer to start. When it digs into the mound, the body of Mrs. Amworth is uncovered. Louisa, meanwhile, in the schoolyard, is scraping the ground with her fingers. John is taken to the police station for questioning while Cassandra looks after the kids. That night, as officer Ed Lowry (Erik Palladino) drives John home, they are attacked and Lowry is dragged from the patrol car by a creature. John continues home, discovering it in disarray and finding Cassandra with her throat slit. She dies while motioning toward Louisa standing in the doorway. John gathers the children to leave, but Louisa refuses. Mound-walkers begin attacking the house, and John kills three. After the attack, Louisa is missing. Her screams can be heard coming from the mound. John leaves Sam in his room, tells him to wait for the police, and tells him \\"be a big boy\\". John goes to the mound to rescue Louisa and finds a tunnel leading into it. He pierces a can of gasoline, sets explosives left from the postponed demolition by the tunnel entrance, sparks a flare for light and crawls inside. Louisa is found unconscious and covered in mud. As he carries her out, angered creatures howl and give chase. Meanwhile, Sam has exited the house, clutching a framed family portrait and looking into the dark toward sounds coming from the mound. John escapes the mound with Louisa and blocks the tunnel with the leaking fuel canister, but another mound-walker is already there outside. Louisa collapses and begs her father not to leave her. John looks down at her and sees her beginning to transform into one of the creatures. He drops a flare into the leaking diesel fuel and the mound goes up in a huge explosion. As Sam watches, the flames are reflected on the glass of the frame. A figure is seen emerging, although its identity is unclear. Sam asks, \\"Daddy?\\", as shadows can also be seen moving in the trees and house behind him. A growling creature emerges directly behind him as the screen goes black. CastProduction The film is based partially on the short story of same name by Irish author John Connolly.New York Times =Filming= Filming took place primarily at the Wedge Plantation along the Santee River just north of McClellanville, South Carolina. Secondary filming was done in McClellanville and on the College of Charleston campus.The New Daughter Movie Filming in McClellanville The exterior of the house in which John James finds Roger Wayne was shot at 67 Moultrie St., Charleston, South Carolina. The school used in filming is West Ashley Middle School, about 3 miles from the original 1670 Charleston Town settlement (The school was formerly Middleton High School, the alma mater of Darius Rucker, and before that it was St. Andrews Jr. High School). School remained in session during filming, with teachers peeking out the windows at Kevin Costner, and film crews and vehicles crowded in between cars in the teachers' parking lot. The side entrance of the building was used as the \\"front\\" of the school in the movie. Air conditioning units were hidden by temporary evergreen trees which were removed after filming.

The town transformed from an obscure group of 18th century Lanarkshire hamlets strung out on the road between Glasgow and Airdrie to a world leading centre of iron production in the 19th century. Development took off at an incredible rate in the 19th century and led to massive changes to the landscape and an explosion in the population.  Early history  The earliest evidence of human habitation in the Coatbridge area can be traced back a crannog in Drumpellier Loch (as it is known locally but persistently referred to as Lochend Loch on every map known), part of Drumpellier Country Park. A crannog was an Iron Age dwelling house built on an artificial island. People continued to live in Crannogs up until about AD 1450. A Bronze Age cemetery has been found on the stretch of land between Drumpellier and Bargeddie. There are thought to be the remains of a Roman road on the fringes of the town at the site of the modern day M8 motorway. Roman coins have been unearthed in Coatbridge. The main Celtic tribes in the Lanarkshire environs during Roman times were named the Damnonii and Selgovae by the Romans.The Raddler‚Äù the Journal of Monklands Historical Society. Vol. 4 September 1999. p.26  Middle Ages  Gillpatrice Mackerran owned the area of Coatbridge prior to the Newbattle abbey Monklands being granted the land.Coatbridge (Images of Scotland) By Helen Moir . The History Press (2001). In 1160, parts of the Caledonian Forest still remained in the area.The Monkland Tradition Miller, Thomas Roland. Thomas Nelson and Sons. 1958. p.16 The ‚ÄúMonklands‚Äù area was so called because it was granted to the monks of Newbattle Abbey in 1162. The monks were the first to mine coal in the area. In the 15th century, a visiting dignitary witnessed \\"black stones\\" being distributed to the poor as alms. In the 16th century these stones had become known as \\"black gold\\". The monks cleared part of the forest which covered the area at the time. They cultivated the land extensively and by the 16th century had leased most of the lands to farmers. Many of the local place names are descended from those used by the monks, such as Whifflet (from 'wheat flats') and Ryefield. The local tracks established by the monks were used as part of the main road between Edinburgh and Glasgow until the early 19th century The town was on the stage coach route between the two cities The Monkland Tradition Miller, Thomas Roland. Thomas Nelson and Sons. 1958. p.35 In 1602, Sir Thomas Hamilton of Binning took possession. The Clellands of Monklands subsequently took possession in 1633. A few years later, in 1639, James, Marquis of Hamilton, was the owner. Monklands subsequently passed into the hands of the College of Glasgow after being bought from Anne, Duchess of Hamilton in the reign of.Charles IIHistorical, Biographical and Literary Sketches of Glasgow and Lanarkshire, Part 1&2\\\\. Hamilton Herald Printing and Publishing. 1904. p26 In 1641, the parish of Monklands was divided between New Monkland (present day Airdrie) and Old Monkland (present day Coatbridge).Collins Encyclopaedia of Scotland (1994) Eds. J & J Keay, HarperCollinsPublishers, p.175 Drumpellier was called the 'Grange' in a charter of Alexander II in 1240. In 1745, Bonnie Prince Charlie‚Äôs Jacobite army supposedly seized Coatbridge on their march to Edinburgh, in an action described as the 'Canter of Coatbridge'. This has been proved to be an error: the true story is 'The Canter of Coltsbridge' (a suburb in the West of Edinburgh).  Industrial Coatbridge  By the time of the late 18th century Coatbridge was only a collection of hamlets between Glasgow and Airdrie. However, the construction of the Monkland Canal to transport coal from deposits in Coatbridge to Glasgow proved to be the spark which set fire to the town's population explosion. The invention of the hot blast furnace in 1828 by James Beaumont Neilson meant that Coatbridge's rich ironstone deposits could be fully exploited by the canal link.Coatbridge: Three Centuries of Change ‚Äì Peter Drummond and James Smith, Monkland Library Services, 1982. P.15 By the mid-19th century there were numerous hot blast furnaces in operation in Coatbridge. In this period fortunes could be quickly made ‚Äúwith a rapidity only equalled by the princely gains of some of the adventurers who accompanied Pizarro to Peru‚Äù, noted one observer.Collins Encyclopaedia of Scotland (1994) Eds. J & J Keay, HarperCollinsPublishers, p.175 Amongst the most notable success stories at this time were the six sons of Coatbridge farmer Alexander Baird. The Bairds were a local farming family in the late 18th century. They became buccaneering capitalists when they leased a coalfield near Coatdyke. They then moved into iron production in late 1820s. Ruthlessly exploiting James Beaumont Neilson's invention of the hot blast furnace process to produce iron they were forced to pay substantial damages in a court action. It was reported that upon losing the court action they were able to simply write a cheque. They had used the patent without paying any royalties. After a nine- day trial they were forced to pay out around ten thousand pounds. It was estimated though they had however realised a profit of ¬£250,000 by exploitation of the patent.The Monkland Tradition Miller, Thomas Roland. Thomas Nelson and Sons. 1958. p.22 The Baird family owned a number of the foundries that sprung up and gave the town its then nickname of 'the Iron Burgh'.Coatbridge: Three Centuries of Change ‚Äì Peter Drummond and James Smith, Monkland Library Services, 1982 Each of the sons was reputed to have become a millionaire. James Baird was responsible for erecting sixteen blast-furnaces in Coatbridge between 1830 and 1842. George \\"Squire Abingdon\\" Baird was a direct descendant of the Baird's. The Baird family exerted a strong influence over Coatbridge in the 19th century. The Bairds were responsible for the lay out of present-day central Coatbridge town centre and gave the town land for the town hall and the land which later came to form Dunbeth Park. Gartsherrie church was built by the Baird family for them and their employees. At one stage the population of Coatbridge grew by 600%. Cheap unskilled labour was in large demand and Coatbridge became a popular destination for vast numbers of largely unskilled Irish workers arriving in Scotland. There have been centuries of coal workings across the area. In 1791, there was disaster at Coats Pit when the canal burst and six miners were drowned. A large part of modern-day Coatbridge has been undermined by underground coal workings. The modern day car parks skirting both sides of the South Circular Road are so undermined that no sizable buildings can be built. Dick's Pond in Carnbroe (labelled Orchard Farm Pool by Google Maps but never called that locally) consists of the hollow left by an ironstone working.Coatbridge: Three Centuries of Change ‚Äì Peter Drummond and James Smith (Monkland Library Services, 1982) P.25 The Clyde Valley plan of 1949 described Coatbridge as \\"situated over a flooded coalfield\\" Coatbridge: Three Centuries of Change ‚Äì Peter Drummond and James Smith (Monkland Library Services, 1982) p.25 Tenements in Coatbridge were not built to same height as Glasgow tenements, due to danger of subsidence Coatbridge: Three Centuries of Change ‚Äì Peter Drummond and James Smith (Monkland Library Services, 1982) p.40 There were serious cholera outbreaks in the town in 1832 and 1848. Population growth strained every natural resource in the town and the canal's stagnant waters were a breeding ground for disease. Andrew Miller noted that locals used the canal water for drinking and in times of dry weather even used the muddy dregs found at the bottom of the Monkland Canal.The Rise of Coatbridge and the Surrounding Neighbourhood (Glas. 1864) by Andrew Miller (In later years, during the 20th century, it was noted that the residents of Gartcosh did not suffer such problems, but that was attributed to the largely English immigrant population who preferred to drink beer rather than water!) In 1885, Coatbridge was granted burgh status. Local industrialists had put off burgh status to avoid falling foul of air pollution legislation. Special provisions were made in the burgh bill to allow the blast furnaces to continue polluting undisturbed.Coatbridge: Three Centuries of Change ‚Äì Peter Drummond and James Smith (Monkland Library Services, 1982) p.31 Irish people began to come to arrive Coatbridge in the mid-19th century, many of them because of The Great Hunger in the mid-19th century. The 1851 census recorded that Irish people born in Coatbridge constituted 35.8% of the population. Although while a significant proportion of these emigrants were Protestant the majority were Catholic. Serious sectarian strife arose in Coatbridge throughout the 19th century. The New York Times reported on serious \\"riots\\" between local Catholics and Orangemen during 1883. Orangeism in Coatbridge (then 60% Catholic) was said to have inflated the local Conservative and Unionist vote and representation on the council.Social Class in Scotland: past and Present. Ed. Allan MacLean. Morrison and Gibb. P.146  20th & 21st century  By 1901, the percentage of Irish born people in Coatbridge had fallen to around 15%, but remained the highest of all the major towns in Scotland.The Irish in Scotland - James Handley, 1962 By end of World War I only five ironworks were left in Coatbridge ‚Äì Langloan, Calder, Carnbroe, Summerlee and Gartsherrie. Four of the ironworks were closed by the time of 1929. In 1934 there was a mass exodus to Corby, England when the Union Plant relocated. This had the effect of a hammer blow impact on the town's iron industry and ushered in the end of serious iron production. The decline of Clydeside shipbuilding in the 1950s meant the demand for iron finally collapsed. In the 1920s-1930s Coatbridge Town Council constructed new housing estates at Cliftonville, Cliftonhall, Rosehall, Barrowfield and Espieside. As late as 1936 however Coatbridge was the most overcrowded place in Scotland.Coatbridge: Three Centuries of Change ‚Äì Peter Drummond and James Smith, Monkland Library Services, 1982. P.42 After World War II Townhead, Kirkwood, Kirkshaws, Shawhead, Summerlee and Sikeside followed. The high rises which can seen on the present day Coatbridge skyline were constructed in this same period. As recently as 1961 the birth rate in Coatbridge was a third higher than the Scottish average.The population of Monklands by Peter Drummond. Monkland District Library Services. 1985. p.11 Since the 1970s there have been various initiatives to attempt to regenerate Coatbridge.

It was presented to the Royal Society in 1766 after being restored by Thomas Heath. It is described as the better of the instruments Newton built.An account of the Royal Society's Newton Telescope, A. Rupert Hall and A.D.C. Simpson Notes Rec. R. Soc. Lond. 1996 50 1‚Äì11 The first reflecting telescope built by Sir Isaac Newton in 1668 is a landmark in the history of telescopes, being the first known successful reflecting telescope.http://amazing- space.stsci.edu/resources/explorations/groundup/lesson/scopes/newton/index.phpEncyclopedia of Astronomy and Physics, Telescopes in History, Peter Bond It was the prototype for a design that later came to be called the Newtonian telescope. There were some early prototypes and also modern replicas of this design. Description 19th century drawing of Newton's reflector Isaac Newton built his reflecting telescope as a proof for his theory that white light is composed of a spectrum of colours. He had concluded that the lens of any refracting telescope would suffer from the dispersion of light into colours (chromatic aberration). The telescope he constructed used mirrors as the objective which bypass that problem. To create the primary mirror Newton used a custom composition of metal consisting of six parts copper to two parts tin, an early composition of speculum metal. He devised means for shaping and grinding the mirror and may have been the first to use a pitch lap to polish the optical surface. He chose a spherical shape for his mirror instead of a parabola to simplify construction: he had satisfied himself that the chromatic, and not the spherical aberration, formed the chief faults of refracting telescopes. He added to his reflector what is the hallmark of the design of a \\"Newtonian telescope\\", a secondary \\"diagonal\\" mirror near the primary mirror's focus to reflect the image at 90¬∞ angle to an eyepiece mounted on the side of the telescope. This unique addition allowed the image to be viewed with minimal obstruction of the objective mirror. He also made all the tube, mount, and fittings. Newton described his invention as: > \\"The diameter of the sphere to which the Metal was ground concave was about > 25 English Inches, and by consequence the length of the Instrument about six > Inches and a quarter. The Eye-glass was Plano-convex, and the diameter of > the Sphere to which the convex side was ground was about 1/5 of an Inch, or > a little less, and by consequence it magnified between 30 and 40 times. By > another way of measuring I found it magnified 35 times. The concave Metal > bore an Aperture of an Inch and a third part, but the Aperture was limited > not by an Opake Circle, covering the limb of the Metal round about, but be > an opake Circle, placed between the Eyeglass and the Eye, and perforated in > the middle with a little round hole for the Rays to pass through to the Eye. > For this Circle being placed here, stopp'd much of the erroneous Light, > which other wise would have disturbed the Vision. By comparing it with a > pretty good Perspective of four Feet in length, made with a concave Eye- > glass, I could read at a greater distance with my own Instrument than with > the Glass. Yet Objects appeared much darker in it than in the Glass, and > that partly because more Light was lost by Reflexion in the Metal, than by > Refraction in the Glass, and partly because my Instrument was overcharged. > Had it magnified but 30 or 25 times, it would have made the Object appear > more brisk and pleasant\\" ... \\"The object-metal was two inches broad, and > about one-third part of an inch thick, to keep it from bending. I had two of > these metals, and when I had polished them both I tried which was best; and > ground the other again, to see if I could make it better, than that which I > kept.\\" Newton describes a telescope with an objective concave primary mirror diameter of 2 inches (50 mm) 0.3 of an inch thick, ground to fit a sphere that was 25 inches in diameter giving it a radius of 12.5 inches and a focal length of 6.25 inches (158 mm). The mirror was aperture reduced to an effective aperture of 1.3 inches by placing a disk with a hole in it between the observer's eye and the eyepiece. The telescope had a flat diagonal secondary mirror bouncing the light at a 90¬∞ angle to a Plano-convex eyepiece with a probable focal length of 4.5mm yielding his observed 35 times magnification. Newton said the telescope was 6.25 inches long; this matches the length of the instrument pictured in his monograph \\"Opticks\\". It appears that the second telescope, which was presented to the Royal Society has a longer focal length as it is significantly longer than the first one shown in his illustration and described in \\"Opticks\\". Newton completed his first reflecting telescope in late 1668 and first wrote about it in a February 23, 1669 letter to Henry Oldenburg (Secretary of the Royal Society).\\". NEWTON TIMELINE - A Chronology of Isaac Newton's Life - Work - Publication, Dr Robert A. Hatch - University of Florida Newton found that he could see the four Galilean moons of Jupiter and the crescent phase of the planet Venus with his new little telescope. Newton's friend Isaac Barrow showed the telescope to small group from the Royal Society of London at the end of 1671. They were so impressed with it they demonstrated it for Charles II in January 1672. This telescope remained in the repository of the Royal Society until it disintegrated and then disappeared from their records. The last reference to it was in 1731 saying that only two mirrors remained of it. The practical potential of Newton's first telescope was made more clear by the end of the 18th century, when the largest reflector had grown to nearly 50 inches aperture (126 cm) while the largest achromatic lens objective was not more than about 5 inches (13 cm).http://www.craig-telescope.co.uk/lens.html There has been some lack of clarity over the early telescopes that Newton built, but it is now clear that his first telescope was a prototype that he constructed in 1668. This was seen only by a few friends at Cambridge and very little is known of it. This prototype had a mirror a little over an inch in diameter, probably 1.3 inches, and around 6 inches in length.An account of the Royal Society's Newton Telescope, A. Rupert Hall and A.D.C. Simpson Notes Rec. R. Soc. Lond. 1996 50 Page 3 Newton seldom referred to this prototype in later years and so his second scope is often called his first. Newton's reflecting telescope Newton's second telescope was made in 1671; it had a mirror of 2 inches diameter and a focal length of between 6.25\\" and 6.3\\". He made two mirrors and chose the best one for the telescope. He did not keep this telescope long, but presented it to the Royal Society for examination. An account of this telescope just after its presentation in December 1671 described it as being about 7 inches long and about 2.25 inches in diameter. The image was viewed through a hole in the side of the tube \\"about the size of a great pins head\\". The tube was one piece and the mirror was moved up from the bottom in order to focus it. It was mounted on a ball and socket mount.An account of the Royal Society's Newton Telescope, A. Rupert Hall and A.D.C. Simpson Notes Rec. R. Soc. Lond. 1996 50 Page 4 This second telescope stayed with the society and by 1731 it had disintegrated to the point of only the two metal mirrors remaining. It then subsequently disappeared. It is certain that this is not the telescope that the Royal Society now hold in their possession as this mirror contained silver and the third telescope mirror contains no silver but has the addition of arsenic. This was something which Newton proposed as an improvement on his second telescope mirror as he found that the metal was too soft due to the silver. Newton's third telescope was built in 1671‚Äì1672 by Newton and his \\"chamber fellow\\" at Trinity College John Wickins. He reported that Wickins did a better job of figuring the mirror than he had done on his second telescope. This is the telescope that he had by him when he was writing Opticks. The telescope appeared some time later in the shop of Heath and Wing instrument makers along with an instrument of Newtons belonging to Edmond Halley. It is most likely that the telescope had passed to Halley and then to Heath and Wing. This third telescope had the mirror damaged in 1694 by Newton while trying to clean it. It is thought that the mirror was later refigured by restorers accounting for its plugged eyepiece hole at an appropriate distance for a 6.25 inch focal length mirror and the new eyepiece position for the current mirror focal length of 8.5 inches. The current brass eyepiece is not original and was added later. This telescope was restored by Heath and Wing and presented to the Royal Society in 1766 as the telescope that Newton had made. At a later date a plaque was added to this telescope with the incorrect inscription claiming that it was his first telescope and made in 1671. This telescope probably includes the original mirrors, reground, part of the original base, the original support bar and possibly the original tube or parts of it.

Only three were built. Development In May 1924 Glosters received an Air Ministry contract for three experimental biplane single-seat fighters. They were intended to develop metal-framed aircraft, with the first two to have steel fuselages and wooden wings (all fabric covered) and the third to have an all-steel airframe. They were to be powered by a Napier Lion engine which had been used in the racing Gloster III and was a water-cooled motor with three banks of four cylinders in an upright broad arrow arrangement. Another intention was to compare aircraft performance with direct-drive and down- geared propellers. The Gorcock was a single-bay biplane with strong stagger and unequal span wings, having a strong resemblance to the Gamecock. The inline engine allowed a smoother, longer and more pointed nose and increased the length by about 6 ft 5 in (1.95 m); the span was slightly less than the Gamecock's. The first Gorcock had a Lion IV engine, geared and producing 450 hp (335 kW) and the second an ungeared Lion VIII of 525 hp (390 kW). The radiator was mounted on the fuselage underside, between the undercarriage legs. Both engines drove fixed-pitch wooden two-blade, 9 ft (2.74 m) diameter propellers. Initially both these machines had Grebe style rudders, squared off with no balance; these were later replaced with Gamecock rudders, vertically extended to include a horn balance.Flight 24 November 1927 The final, all- metal Gorcock had the geared Lion IV; this was Gloster's first all-metal aircraft. It had a top speed of 174 mph (280 km/h) at 5,000 ft (1,525 m), some 30 mph (48 km/h) faster than contemporary fighters. All three aircraft were delivered by June 1927. Both Glosters and RAE Farnborough used the Gorcocks for research for several years. The second machine, for example was used for airscrew experiments, flying in 1929 with a variety of duralumin propellers. The Gorcocks were also fitted with a variety of ventral radiators of different cross-sections and intake configurations. Despite their research role, the Gorcocks flew armed with two Vickers machine guns in the nose. The name According to the Oxford English Dictionary, gorcock is a Scottish and Northern English name for the male of the Red Grouse.

He was a well known surveyor of the early British hill stations in South India and a famous sportsman, shikari, big-game hunter and trophy collector. He was an acute observer of nature and a gentleman. He legitimately shot more game in the Nilgiri Hills than any other sportsman.Hamilton, p. xxxviii Family Hamilton was born on 8 April 1818, and educated at Harrow School. He was the youngest of eight sons of Charles Hamilton esq. of Sudbury Grove, Middlesex, and of Kensworth House, Hertfordshire. His father was employed at the War Office and died on 28 June 1834 aged 56. Records of Sport, Preface Hamilton's brother Edward was the editor of his 1892 autobiography, \\"Records of sport in southern India chiefly on the Annamullay, Nielgherry and Pulney mountains, also including notes on Singapore, Java and Labuan,...\\" This is about \\"years long gone by when the muzzle loader, with all its drawbacks, was the chief weapon in use.\\" His brother Richard, a Captain in the 1st Regiment M.N.I., was well known to all Southern Indian sportsmen as the author of Game under the soubriquet of \\" Hawkeye.\\" His uncle was Captain George Peevor of His Majesty's Royal Leicestershire Regiment, who served in the Nepal Campaign of 1815-16 and in the Mahratta and Pindari wars, 1817‚Äì18, including the capture of Jubbulpore in 1839-40.Hamilton, p. ix Military career In 1834 Douglas Hamilton went to the East India Company's Addiscombe Military Seminary, and received his commission in the East India Company's Army in 1837, being gazetted to the 21st Regiment of the Madras Native Infantry. He embarked at Portsmouth in the \\"Duke of Argyle\\" on 1 September of the same year, arriving in the Madras Roads on 14 December. His regiment was sent to Kulladghee in the Bombay Presidency to replace one which had gone to the front in the first Afghan Campaign. In 1846, he went with his regiment to Singapore, and was fortunate to obtain three months' leave in 1848 to visit the Island of Java for hunting. In 1849, he visited England on furlough and returned to India in 1852. Douglas was very interested in forest conservation in South India, and often visited his old friend General James Michael who was organizing an experimental forest conservancy in the Annaimalai Hills. He was appointed to temporarily manage the conservancy when Michael returned to England on sick leave in 1854. He showed great aptitude for these new forestry duties. In 1857 Michael was again ill and had to relinquish the work altogether. Douglas succeeded permanently to the appointment and for the three years was in charge of the Annaimalai forests, supplying teak lumber for shipbuilding at the Bombay Dockyard. During this period he also became Assistant Conservator of Forests under Dr. Hugh Francis Cleghorn who established the Madras Forest Department and whose work led to the establishment of the Forest Department of India. In 1860 he went with his regiment to Hong Kong and returned to Madras in February, 1861.Hamilton, pp. xii, xiii Hills surveys Pillar Rocks In 1862 he was relieved of routine regimental duties and given a roving commission by Sir Charles Trevelyan, the Finance Minister of India and former Governor of Madras Presidency, to conduct surveys and make drawings for the Government of all the hill plateaus in Southern India which were likely to suit as Sanitaria, or quarters for European troops. Thereafter, Douglas Hamilton was on \\"special duty\\" with the 44th Regiment, Madras Native Infantry. Upper falls near Muddikull, Bababooden hills A series of careful drawings by Douglas Hamilton of the Annaimalai Hills, Palani Hills and Shevaroy Hills was the result. While at work on this commission he had great opportunities to follow his favorite pursuit, and also to observe the habits of the various animals inhabiting the different districts. These well-known drawings showed him as an accurate observer and a careful draughtsman. Each series of drawings was accompanied by a Survey article describing all aspects of the district.Hamilton, p.xiii Some of his publications about these surveys include: Berijam Swamp p. 155 was first described in 1864 by Hamilton. In 1864, Hamilton submitted a report that stated that the Berijam Lake area was the best site in the Palani Hills for a military cantonment or Sanatorium. Hamilton described the place as being located near a lake. As the report progressed, however, it became clear that what Hamilton initially had termed a lake was no such thing: it was a valley where he thought he detected evidence of an ancient lake bed. The distinction seemed scarcely worthy of note to Hamilton, so persuaded was he that this location offered the most picturesque environment for a settlement. \\"Let but the lake be reconstructed and a road made to it, and this magnificent sheet of water ... will of itself attract residents to its vicinity. \\"The Fort Hamilton military outpost, later built there, was named for him. In March 1866 he went to the Budan Hills for the purpose of making drawings and a report. In August, 1870, he obtained three months' leave due to poor health and went to Australia. He visited King George Sound, Melbourne, Sydney, and Adelaide, and returned to Madras in November much better health. ;Commissions The dates of Gen.

In those days Blackbuck antelopes were very numerous, but very wild and difficult to approach.Hamilton, p. 1 5 Tigers seen In 1854, Hamilton bought Mallock's Bungalow at Pykara for 200 rupees. This is the well known hut, where for many years he entertained and showed sport to many of his friends, amongst whom were Prince Frederick of Schleswig Holstein, Sir Victor Brooke, Bob Jago father of the Ootacamund Hunt, and the oldest and most intimate of all, General James Michael. The hut was still in his possession when he died 38 years later.Hamilton, p. 122 Death of the Great Tusker He closely observed over 50 wild tigers during his career and In 1854 he killed his first tiger at the Avalanche in the Nilgiri Hills. One tiger he killed in 1857 was long and tall at the shoulder. A friend of Hamilton, Colonel Nightingale, once killed eight tigers in six days, including a man eater that attacked him and the trained elephant he was riding. That tiger was tall at the shoulder and long with length of skin, .Hamilton, p. 218 Sambar bucks and does In 1855 in the Annaimalai Hills, he killed his first elephant, a large tusker which measured nine feet two inches at the shoulder, with tusks in diameter and and long, respectively.Hamilton, p. 147 In 1863, at Hassanoor together with Sir Victor Brooke, Hamilton shot the largest elephant ever killed in Southern India. This trophy had one perfect tusk long and a broken tusk measuring long. It was tall at the shoulder.Hamilton, p. 158 Between 1855 and 1869, Hamilton shot and killed two hundred and ninety-five sambar. The largest ever killed in the Nilgiri Hills, Shot by Hamilton, stood fourteen hands () high at the shoulder and antlers measuring and , respectively.Hamilton, pp. 257, 258 Attacked by Bison, 30 Aug. 1856 In 1856 he was attacked and run over by a large injured bison bull he shot in the Annaimalai Hills, but suffered only minor injuries. The larger horn was long and in diameter at the base. He killed his last bison at Permund in 1866.Hamilton, p. 238 He did not kill many leopards, but did kill one fine specimen of a black Leopard near his hut in 1857. He shot his last leopard in 1870, an old male long with a beautiful skin.Hamilton, p. 235 In 1861, Hamilton recorded 114 species of birds near Kodaikanal. Return to England On 20 June 1871 he finally left India after thirty-five years' service, and arrived at Southampton on 19 July. The \\"Oriental Sporting Magazine,\\" in noticing his departure, has the following passage: :\\"The great Sportsman and Shikarie who has recently left these hills for England on account of failing health, is Colonel Douglas Hamilton, than whom [sic] a truer friend, a more kindly gentleman, a keener observer of nature, and a more enthusiastic sportsman it has never been our good fortune to know. The regret at his departure is universal. We may truly state that he has legitimately shot more game on these hills than any other sportsman, and a sight of the trophies that adorn the walls of his house, of the sketches and incidents of the chase, and the relation thereof was a rich treat, and one never again to be experienced.\\" From 1872 to 1887 he annually rented a moor and deer forest in Scotland, for the purpose of following his favorite pursuit of deer stalking, and many a grand stag fell to his rifle. The invigorating air of the Highlands restored his health and strength. His last leopard, 8 Feb. 1870 He never appeared to suffer from severe exertion and fatigue till the autumn of 1887, when, from constant exposure in bad weather he got a violent chill, and from that date, although at times appearing to get fairly well he never recovered his health. After a sharp attack of influenza, he suddenly died on the night of the 20 January 1892.

ICTV 11th report Like arbovirus (arthropod borne) and tibovirus (tick borne) the name refers to its method of transmission, known as its vector. This is distinguished from a clade, which groups around a common ancestor. Some scientists now refer to arbovirus and robovirus together with the term ArboRobo-virus.  Methods of transmission  Rodent borne disease can be transmitted through different forms of contact such as rodent bites, scratches, urine, saliva, etc.\\"Rodents\\", U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases, and Division of High- Consequence Pathogens and Pathology. Potential sites of contact with rodents include habitats such as barns, outbuildings, sheds, and dense urban areas. Transmission of disease through rodents can be spread to humans through direct handling and contact, or indirectly through rodents carrying the disease spread to ticks, mites, fleas (arboborne). = Viral diseases transmitted by rodents = One example of a robovirus is hantavirus, which causes hantavirus pulmonary syndrome. Humans can be infected with Hantavirus Pulmonary Syndrome through direct contact with rodent droppings, saliva, or urine infected with strains of the virus. These components mix into the air and get transmitted when inhaled through airborne transmission. Lassa virus from the Arenaviridae family causes Lassa hemorrhagic fever and is also a robovirus transmitted by the rodent genus Mastomys natalensis. The multimammate rat is able to excrete the virus in its urine and droppings. These rat are often found in the savannas and forests of Africa. When these rats scavenge and enter households this provides an outlet for direct contact transmission with humans. It has also been found that airborne transmission can occur by engaging in cleaning activities such as sweeping. In some areas of Africa, the Mastomys rodent is caught and used as a source of food. This process can also lead to transmission and infection. = Viral diseases indirectly transmitted by rats = Colorado tick fever virus causes high fevers, chills, headache, fatigue and sometimes vomiting, skin rash, and abdominal pain. The virus is caused by a Rocky Mountain wood tick (Dermacentor andersoni). It is an arbovirus, but rodents serve as the reservoir. The tick is carried by five species of rodents: the least chipmunk (Eutamias minimus), Richardson's ground squirrel (Urocitellus richardsonii), deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus), the golden-mantled ground squirrel (Callospermophilus lateraliss), and the Uinta chipmunk (Neotamias umbrinus). The infected tick will be carried by its rodent host and infect another host (animal or human) as it feeds.Colorado Tick fever - \\"Transmission\\", U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. = Factors affecting roboviruses = Rodent populations are affected by a number of diverse factors, including climatic conditions. Warmer winters and increased rainfall will make it more likely for rodent populations to survive, therefore increasing the number of rodent reservoirs for disease. Increased rainfall accompanied by flooding can also increase human to rodent contactCharron, Dominique F., Fleury, Manon, Lindsay, Leslie Robbin, Ogden, Nicholas and Schuster-Wallace, Corinne J.

The unit was reorganized, expanded and redesignated on 15 December 1941 as the 31st Engineer Combat Battalion. On 29 April 1942 the unit was reorganized and redesignated as the 1st Battalion, 31st Engineers (Combat), and then again on 1 August 1942 as the 31st Engineer Combat Regiment. After being re-designated as the 31st Engineer Combat Regiment, the regiment was broken up on 22 March 1943 and its elements were then reorganized and redesignated as follows: 1st Battalion as the 31st Engineer Combat Battalion, Headquarters and Headquarters and Service Company as Headquarters and Headquarters Company, 1114th Engineer Combat Group, 2nd Battalion as the 241st Engineer Combat Battalion. =European Theater in WWII= The 31st Engineer Combat Battalion remained at Fort Belvoir until 10 June 1944 and then served for four months at Camp Butner, North Carolina. The 31st Engineer Combat Battalion departed New York Port of Embarkation on 22 October 1944 aboard the General William Black for overseas service. They arrived in England on 2 November 1944 and landed in France on 31 December 1944 and were assigned to Seventh Army. It then moved to Bouxwiller in the French Alsace and installed defense against a possible renewed German attack in the region. The battalion entered Germany in late March 1945 and crossed the Rhine near Mannheim on the last day of that month. It encountered its toughest fighting of the war on 4‚Äì8 April as it sought to bridge the Neckar River near Heilbronn. The battalion then swung south, crossing the Danube at Ulm and entering Austria on 9 May. After serving for a time on occupation duty in Vienna, the 31st Sailed back from Le Havre, France, on 26 February 1946 and arrived in New York Port of Embarkation on 7 March 1946. Two days later, the 31st Engineer Combat Battalion inactivated at Camp Kilmer, New Jersey. =Korean War= On 10 March 1951, the battalion activated at Camp McCoy, Wisconsin, during the Korean War. It served there for two years before it was redesignated on 8 June 1953 as the 31st Engineer Battalion (Combat) and moved to Fort Carson, Colorado. On 15 December 1956, the battalion inactivated. =Vietnam= The unit was again activated on 17 June 1963 at Fort Chaffee, Arkansas. The battalion departed Fort Bliss, Texas for overseas service and arrived at Vung Tau, Vietnam on 5 May 1968, and was directed to Xuan Loc to back up and construct the Black Horse Base Camp for the 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment. The battalion was responsible for III CTZ airmobile equipment support and construction support under the 159th and 79th Engineer Groups just north of Saigon. The unit moved to Ph∆∞·ªõc Vƒ©nh on 20 October 1968 and to Long Binh in mid-1971 where it remained until it departed Vietnam for return to the United States. After nearly four years of service in Vietnam, the battalion returned to Fort Lewis, Washington, and was inactivated there on 12 March 1972. =1986 to present= On 30 September 1986, the \\"Second to None\\" 31st Engineer Battalion transferred to the United States Army and Doctrine Command; concurrently, Headquarters organized at Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri and redesignated the \\"We Demonstrate\\" 31st Engineer Battalion. On 20 August 1990, the 132nd Engineer Brigade inactivated. The 31st Engineer Battalion then became part of the 1st Engineer Brigade. From January to March 1991, the battalion began preparing Soldiers for Operation Desert Storm, and supported the mobilization of the 1st Battalion, 392nd Regiment, 98th Division (Training) based in New York State. The battalion was reassigned from the 1st Engineer Brigade to the 3rd Training Brigade on 6 May 1991. Along with the 35th and 589th Engineer Battalion, the 31st joined the five battalions of the 10th Infantry Regiment. In January 1992, Delta Company was inactivated, and Echo Company was redesignated as Delta Company.

The firm was founded in 1874. In 1995, the company was purchased by Selmer, and has since become a division of Conn- Selmer, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Steinway Musical Instruments.  Firm history  Established in 1874, the firm endured for over 80 years, and among other things, amassed an important collection of fine orchestral string instruments from the violin family, which included those of Antonio Stradivarius, Giuseppe Guarneri, Domenico Montagnana, Sanctus Serafin, Lorenzo Storioni, Rugeri, Joannes Baptista Guadagnini, Nicolas Lupot, J. B. Vuillume. The bows collected included those of Fran√ßois Tourte, Dominique Peccatte, Nicolaus Kittel, Jean Pierre Marie Persois. The firm gained coast-to-coast clientele and built credibility with notable musicians ‚Äî professional and amateur. With comprehensive services for string players, the firm came to be known as the \\"Violinist's Headquarters.\\" Several notable makers and restorers worked for the firm, including Carl G. Becker (1887‚Äì1975) and Frank Kovanda. Lewis & Son produced influential publications, including How Many Strads by Ernest Nicholas Doring (1877‚Äì1955), (who worked for the firm), Violins & Violinists a magazine for which Doring was editor, and Bows for Musical Instruments of the Violin Family, by Joseph Roda (1894‚Äì1963). In 1862, after the outbreak of the American Civil War, Lewis moved to Chicago where he joined Root & Cady, a music publisher founded in 1858. The Great Chicago Fire of 1871 destroyed Root & Cady ‚Äî its place of business, then located at the Crosby Opera House, and all its assets. Unable to recover, Root & Cady folded under duress of bankruptcy in February 1875. In 1874, Ebenezer Towner Root (1822‚Äì1896) partnered with Lewis to form the house of Root & Lewis. Ebenezer Root, brother of George Frederick Root (1820‚Äì1895), had been a senior partner at Root & Cady when it folded. The Cady part of the name belonged to Chauncey M. Cady (1824‚Äì1859).

The buildings of Washington range from simple log cabins to late Georgian and early Federal styles constructed of home burned brick laid in Flemish Bond. Many houses have double doors at the entrance and a reeded roll length wise under a four light transom. Architecture Log cabin built from \\"flat boat\\" lumber The significant architecture of Washington covers the period 1765-1850. Taking into account the time lag between architectural styles fashionable on the Atlantic seaboard and in the frontier, the lack of refined, period examples within the town that can be found elsewhere in the state becomes understandable. Eighteen buildings were earmarked within the boundaries of the original historic district (approved January 21, 1970). They included the most important buildings historically and architecturally, for example: *The Paxton Inn (c. 1810), a brick three-story Federal style example of an early Kentucky public inn *Albert Sidney Johnston House, representative of simple early frame domestic buildings in Kentucky, is reputed to be the birthplace and childhood home of Confederate States of America Army General, Albert Sidney Johnston *Federal Hill (1800), is a two-story brick house with transitional details of Georgian and Federal styles built by Colonel Thomas Marshall and completed by his son. Another son, John Marshall, became the Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court (1801-1835). *Marshall Key House (1807), a two-story brick house, has a Federal style main body with a Georgian style doorway. The builder was Colonel Marshall Key, who moved to Kentucky in 1795. *Arthur Fox House (also Fox-Bickley House, c. 1785), a two- story frame and nogging clapboarded structure, was built by one of the original trustees of Washington. *The rich variety of buildings include a \\"flat-boat house\\", the only surviving example of this unique kind of structure, a bank, an inn, row buildings, churches, a school building, a group of log, frame, brick, and stone homes along with several types of outbuildings. Early history The founding of Washington dates back to May 1775, when a group of ten men arrived from farther east in Virginia to survey and improve lands. One of the men, Jonathan Higgs, built a cabin near the present east end of York Street in Washington. The most influential of the group was Simon Kenton, who cleared about an acre of land at a site about 1.5 miles from Washington. In 1785, Simon Kenton sold 700 acres to two Virginians, Arthur Fox and William Wood, who decided to lay out a one-mile square grid- iron site, sell lots, and turn a profit. The town was named \\"Washington\\" with the intention that it might become the national capital and was the first town in America to be so named. Washington's early commercial success stemmed from its location. Those settlers who landed at Limestone and who wished to travel to the Kentucky interior had to negotiate a steep hill to the plateau three and one-half miles away where Washington stands. This required a full day to drive a heavily loaded wagon the short distance and therefore most elected to stop overnight at the town before continuing the inland journey. High period Washington was once the second largest town in Kentucky as reported by the first federal census of 1790 which lists four hundred sixty-two residents living in one hundred nineteen houses. It became the county seat in 1788 when Mason County was formed By 1794, when the Mason County Courthouse was built, the town had already become one of the most dominant in the state. The resulting influx of lawyers and others concerned with court activities led to the establishment of a number of taverns and inns. The Washington post office was designated as the mail distribution center for the entire Northwest Territory including the present states of Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan and Wisconsin. Decline After the start of the 19th century, Washington experienced a slow decline. One traveler passing through on November 25, 1818, described the town as being \\"laid out on a large plan but not thriving\\". Disaster struck in April 1825, when a fire destroyed thirteen buildings including two taverns. A second misfortune occurred in 1820 when the Lexington and Ohio Railroad was laid out from Lexington to the Ohio River bypassing Washington, a serious blow to the future economy of the town. Outbreaks of cholera in 1832 and 1833 and significantly reduced the population. The nearby town of Maysville, however, experienced rapid development between 1830 and 1850, surpassing the growth of Washington. The inevitable happened in 1847 with the decision to transfer the county seat from Washington to Maysville. Archaeological report An archaeological survey was completed during the summer of 1975. The physical survey and historical research of others led to the discovery of additional historic sites and artifacts both inside and outside of the original historic district boundary. The surface collection of artifacts within the township provided a good chronological overview of the areas cultural remains and their development. A total of 1,858 artifacts were recovered from the surface, and represent occupational periods from c. 1785 through more recent times. Pearlware, ironstone, and various heavy stoneware - including American blue on grey - were collected throughout the township. Recovered glass artifacts included basal fragments of bottles bearing pre-1860 pontil scars, dark olive or \\"black\\" glass, canning jar fragments, and a considerable amount of the sun-colored amethyst glass characteristic of the period 1880-1914. Metallic artifacts include hand-wrought pieces, small iron chains, a boot scraper, and 19th century building hardware.

Larger bubbles indicate higher percentage of state residents at or below the poverty level. Trend suggests higher crime rates in states with higher percentages of people living below the poverty level. A bubble chart is a type of chart that displays three dimensions of data. Each entity with its triplet (v1, v2, v3) of associated data is plotted as a disk that expresses two of the vi values through the disk's xy location and the third through its size. Bubble charts can facilitate the understanding of social, economical, medical, and other scientific relationships. Bubble charts can be considered a variation of the scatter plot, in which the data points are replaced with bubbles. As the documentation for Microsoft Office explains, \\"You can use a bubble chart instead of a scatter chart if your data has three data series that each contain a set of values. The sizes of the bubbles are determined by the values in the third data series.\\".Present your data in a bubble chart Microsoft Office Online. Accessed 16 August 2015.  Choosing bubble sizes correctly Using bubbles to represent scalar (one- dimensional) values can be misleading. The human visual system naturally experiences a disk's size in terms of its area. However, charting software may request the radius or diameter of the bubble as the third data value (after horizontal and vertical axis data). If so, the apparent size differences among the disks will be non-linear (quadratic) and misleading. To get a properly weighted scale, one must scale each disk's radius to the square root of the corresponding data value v3. In other words, if the charting software accepts the radius of the bubble as a parameter rather than the area of the bubble, transform the scalar value by taking its square root before passing it to the charting software. This scaling issue can lead to extreme misinterpretations, especially where the range of the data has a large spread. And because many people are unfamiliar with‚Äîor do not stop to consider‚Äîthe issue and its impact on perception, those who are aware of it often have to hesitate in interpreting a bubble chart because they cannot assume that the scaling correction was indeed made. It is therefore important that bubble charts not only be scaled correctly, but also be clearly labeled to document that it is area, rather than radius or diameter, that conveys the data.Edward Tufte, The Visual Display of Quantitative Information. Cheshire, CT: Graphics Press. (2001, 2nd edition, ) Displaying zero or negative data values in bubble charts The metaphoric representation of data values as disk areas cannot be extended for displaying values that are negative or zero. As a fallback, some users of bubble charts resort to graphic symbology to express nonpositive data values. As an example, a negative value v < 0 can be represented by a disk of area v in which is centered some chosen symbol like \\"√ó\\" to indicate that the size of the bubble represents the absolute value of a negative data value. And this approach can be reasonably effective in situations where data values' magnitudes (absolute values) are themselves somewhat important‚Äîin other words, where values of v and -v are similar in some context-specific way‚Äîso that their being represented by congruent disks makes sense. To represent zero- valued data, some users dispense with disks altogether, using, say, a square centered at the appropriate location. Others use full circles for positive, and empty circles for negative values.  Incorporating further dimensions of data  A series of bubbles on a map is called a proportional symbol map or sometimes \\"bubble map\\" Additional information about the entities beyond their three primary values can often be incorporated by rendering their disks in colors and patterns that are chosen in a systematic way. And, of course, supplemental information can be added by annotating disks with textual information, sometimes as simple as unique identifying labels for cross- referencing to explanatory keys and the like. Other uses Circular Packing chart, sometimes called a \\"bubble chart,\\" showing the proportions of professions of people who create programming languages * In architecture, the term \\"bubble chart\\" is also applied to a first architectural sketch of the layout constructed with bubbles.Bryan Lawson (2004). What Designers Know. Elsevier, 2004. . p.44. * In software engineering, \\"bubble chart\\" can refer to a data flow, a data structure or other diagram in which entities are depicted with circles or bubbles and relationships are represented by links drawn between the circles. * In Information visualization, a \\"bubble chart\\" may refer to a technique in which a set of numeric quantities is represented by closely packed circles whose areas are proportional to the quantities. Unlike a traditional bubble chart, such displays don't assign meaning to x- or y-axis positions, but seek to pack circles as tightly as possible to make efficient use of space. These bubble charts were introduced by Fernanda Viegas and Martin Wattenberg2007: Many Eyes: A Site for Visualization at Internet Scale. Fernanda B. Vi√©gas, Martin Wattenberg, Frank van Ham, Jesse Kriss, Matt McKeon. IEEE Symposium on Information Visualization. and have since become a popular method of displaying data.

The 1979 miniseries showed the family moving from Virginia to Wyoming. When the TV series commenced in 1980, the pioneers were shown en route along the California Trail from Wyoming to Sacramento, California.Alex McNeil, Total Television, New York: Penguin Books, 1996, 4th ed., p. 163 Plot According to the story line, created by David Dortort of Bonanza and developed by Evan Hunter from his own novels, the Chisholms were defrauded of their Virginia land and headed west to seek a new life. Robert Preston appeared as family patriarch Hadley Chisholm but the character died midway through the 1980 TV series. Rosemary Harris portrays his wife, Minerva. The Chisholms encounter difficult travel, hostile Indians, and family struggles. Cast Ben Murphy appeared as oldest son, Will Chisholm. Brian Kerwin portrayed son Gideon in the miniseries, but was replaced by Brett Cullen in the 1980 TV series. James Van Patten, appeared as Bo; Glynnis O'Connor, Elizabeth; Stacy Nelkin, Bonnie Sue in the 1979 segments, replaced by Delta Burke; and Susan Swift, Annabel, youngest of the Chisholms, killed by Indians in the 1979 miniseries. However, Swift, at fifteen, returned to the program in the 1980 series as Mercy Hopwell, a passenger on the wagon train. Charles Frank portrayed Lester Hackett the miniseries but was replaced by Reid Smith in the 1980 series. In 1980, Mitchell Ryan played wagonmaster Cooper Hawkins, who becomes the de facto head of the Chisholms after Hadley's death (in the episode \\"Death in the Sierras\\"). In the miniseries, Sandra Griego played Kewedinok, an Indian woman who marries Will. Victoria Racimo replaced her in the 1980 series. Others cast in the miniseries included Anthony Zerbe as Jimmy Jackson, Billy Drago as Teetontah/Teetonkah and Brian Keith as Andrew Blake. Illinois native Tom Adams was the actor cast as Clay Cummins in the 1980 series, along with Donald Moffat played Enos; Leslie Nielsen, Sinclair; and Ben Piazza, the historic figure John A. Sutter (on whose land along the American River gold was found in 1848 and made known in 1849). Shortly before his death, Chief Eugene Standingbear, an Oklahoma native, appeared as a medicine man in the episode \\"Siege\\". In the series finale, \\"The Siren Song\\", Minerva, a Baptist, wonders why Bo is spending so much time with a Franciscan priest, played by Donnelly Rhodes. Production The first episodes were filmed at Bent's Old Fort National Historic Site near La Junta on the Arkansas River in southeastern Colorado. The Chisholms is akin to the unsuccessful 1977 NBC venture, The Oregon Trail.

Some initials contain architectural elements of the Dalmatian city of Split.

It is a small Arts and Crafts-style stone building constructed in the 1920s with a donation from Charles E. Rushmore, a local resident for whom Mount Rushmore is also named. It served as the Town of Woodbury public library until the mid-1980s, when a larger modern library was built. Today it is the headquarters of the town historical society. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2008, after two previous efforts in the 1980s failed. Building The library is a one-story three-by- three-bay structure faced in locally quarried uncoursed puddingstone and topped with a Mission-style ceramic-tiled hipped roof that overhangs the building on all sides and covers the front steps as well. A stone chimney, similar to the wall, rises from the west side. A wheelchair ramp leads into a rear entrance; a short set of stairs to the front. Inside, there is one single room with a large stone chimney breast and fireplace and mahogany bookshelves. Other original wooden trim and furnishing remains. There is a bronze memorial plaque with a poem by Jane Rushmore Patterson, Rushmore's daughter. The basement is fully excavated. History Woodbury's public library began in the years following World War I as a small collection of books kept first on a shelf at the local drugstore and later moved to a grocery store and the telephone company office as it got larger. Jane Patterson encouraged her parents to help build a permanent home for the library, and they bought the land and put up the money to build it. The deed stipulated that the building and property remain in use as a library or some related function, or it would revert to the Rushmore family. Howard Gregory, a young local war veteran and architect whose father's firm had built the Rushmore home in 1906, designed the library and oversaw its construction throughout 1924. One of his early renderings is displayed in the building today. His use of uncut stone was in keeping with both the principles of the American Arts and Crafts movement and other nearby rustic stone architecture, such as the gatehouse at the F.F. Proctor estate a few miles away and the structures built for Harriman and Bear Mountain state parks and the new gated community of Tuxedo Park. Charles Rushmore died in 1931, and eight years later the library would be formally renamed in his memory. At the same time it was deeded to what was then the Highland Mills Common School District. In 1951, that district was one of several merged into the new Monroe-Woodbury Central School District. The library remained under the new district's control for five years, until in 1956 the school district transferred it back to the town. It became Rushmore Memorial Public Library, the Highland Mills branch of the town library, in 1958. It was a charter member of the regional Ramapo-Catskill Library System when that was established the next year. In 1966, all volunteer services at the library were ended. The wheelchair ramp was added in 1970, with a window converted to a door in the process. Fifteen years later, in 1985, the town built a newer, larger library facility, and it briefly considered whether to keep the original building or not. It was decided that the historical society would keep collections related to local history there. At that time, the historical society had tried twice to get the library listed on the National Register, but both applications failed. In 2008, with help from New York's Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation, they were successful.

He was placed in charge of what became known as the Philippine Insurgent Records. That is, the collection of documents seized from Philippine revolutionaries during the Philippine‚ÄìAmerican War. Taylor was a West Point graduate of 1889 and served in the Boxer Rebellion in China in 1899. Subsequently, he was transferred to the Philippines in the same year. General Elwell Stephen Otis, Military Governor of the Philippines, instructed him to collate original documents captured from \\"insurgents' and to translate them for the United States Department of War and the United States Senate. Philippine Insurgent Records In 1901 he returned to the US and was detailed to the Bureau of Insular Affairs where he supervised the filing, selection and translation of a representation of some of the 200,000 documents. For five years Taylor supervised the transcription and translation (from Spanish or Tagalog) of these pre-selected documents in order to present what he claimed would be a \\"truthful version\\" of the Philippine revolution and the subsequent war between the Philippine revolutionaries and the American colonialists. In his letter of transmittal for the compilation, Taylor wrote of the documents in the compilation: Taylor ordered the Government Printing Office to typeset galley proofs, with two volumes dedicated to his analytical history of US-Philippine relations and three other volumes containing 1,340 supporting papers of original documents. Then Secretary of War William Howard Taft decided to defer its publication for fear of antagonizing both Americans and Filipinos. In 1909 a second attempt was made to publish the volumes when President Taft's former secretary James A. LeRoy wrote a scathing critique objecting to its publication. The Bureau of Insular Affairs then abandoned the project. It was subsequently published in the Philippines in 1968 by the Eugenio Lopez Foundation. John R. M. Taylor was not shy in stating his opinions. \\"The mass of the people of the Philippines--the men who work and have no desire to live from contributions levied upon their neighbors-- welcomed the crushing of the Katipunan.\\" Also more damaging: \\"The government which Aguinaldo established did not represent the aspirations of the men who were best entitled to be consulted. He played upon his people as an instrument... he deceived the Spaniards, the Americans, and the Filipinos in Hong Kong alive; fraud and murder were the instruments upon which he relied to cut out the path for his ambition.\\" In the 1968 foreword to the publication of John Taylor's magnum opus, historian Renato Constantino wrote that notwithstanding the openly anti-Filipino bias, the collection of original documents itself would \\"make available to Philippine scholars a part of the voluminous file of original documents of the Philippine Revolution.\\" Re- evaluation In 2002 American historian John M. Gates (College of Wooster, Ohio) wrote: \\"Capt. Taylor paid a severe penalty for his attempt to write the history of a highly controversial event.

The Lower Campus, located near downtown Ojai, enrolls day and resident students in grades pre-kindergarten to eight. The facilities include a performing arts center, cottage-style classrooms, dormitories, library, art studio, woodshop, technology center, athletic fields, a swimming pool, and stables for the equestrian program. The Upper Campus, located seven miles (11 km) from downtown Ojai, is nestled amid orange groves and rolling hills in the east of the valley in Upper Ojai. The campus enrolls day and resident students in grades nine to twelve. The campus is situated on a former cattle ranch and features dormitories, classrooms, athletic fields, climbing wall and ropes course, a swimming pool, as well as art and ceramics studios. The academic program on both campuses is challenging and well-rounded, encouraging students to explore their interests, know themselves, and develop a respect for others. Students participate in outdoor education, equestrian, fine and performing arts programs, as well as athletics and community service.  History  In the early part of the 20th century, an Eastern couple settled in the Ojai Valley and opened a small private school. Edward Yeomans, a Chicagoan educated at Phillips Academy and Princeton University, had written a series of articles in the Atlantic Monthly on the need for educational reform. The articles caught the eye of a wealthy businessman, Frank Frost, who persuaded Yeomans to move to Ojai and create a school that would embody his modern ideas. At the core of Yeomans‚Äô beliefs was the concept that children learn best through experience. Yeomans considered his own education to have been dull and stifling, and wanted to establish a school that would emphasize experiential learning and a love for the outdoors. He envisioned a place where music, art, and woodshop would be taught alongside math, history, and languages. Yeomans declared that ‚ÄúInteger Vitae‚Äù ‚Äì meaning the wholeness of life, symmetry of life, and soundness of life would become the school‚Äôs motto and philosophy. The school has grown from a one-room classroom serving 12 pupils to a two-campus boarding and day school for more than 300 students in pre-kindergarten to 12th grades. The school was heavily damaged by the Thomas Fire in December 2017. The fire destroyed two buildings on Upper Ojai campus, a dormitory and a science and technology building.

Plot A family of demons from Hell called the Hellmans are sent by Satan to Texas on a mission to destroy a drill that can dig to the Earth's core where Satan fears that the humans will invade Hell if the drill reaches it. The Hellmans face a culture shock trying to fit in with humans. They also realize that the humans can be as bad as the demons, and that Earth is almost no different from hell. CharactersMain= * Balthazor Hellman (voiced by Will Sasso) ‚Äì The family's patriarch. He is a bit naive but is a very kind- hearted demon. He has a vast knowledge of human behavior from watching much human television in Hell. He almost faced punishment from Satan because of that. He is constantly trying to either get promoted or demoted at work in order to get closer to the drill, the target of which he was sent to destroy. Balthazor is shown to have an evil side too, as he almost drowned Tina's father Zebulon when he insulted his father and tried to get him fired. He appears self-conscious about being overweight as he gets offended when others make fun of it. Despite being a demon, he is overall a nice guy where he cares for his friends, such as when he covered for his friend Chevdet after getting him drunk despite it preventing him from destroying the drill, and deeply loves his family, usually ending each episode having a group hug with his family as well as state \\"I love you all\\". He has the power to breathe fire out of all his cavities such as his mouth, nostrils and once farted fire. * Tina Hellman (voiced by Molly Shannon) ‚Äì Balthazor's physically attractive and strong-willed wife and mother of Josh and Mandy. She has a short temper, is a bad driver, stubborn streak and is very protective over her family. She is an alcoholic and has an obsession with gossip as she is constantly seen with an alcoholic beverage in one hand and a gossip magazine in the other. Tina is bitter about her abrupt transition from a hardworking employee to an average housewife. She and Balthazor have a passionate and sexually charged marriage. * Pazuzu (voiced by Patton Oswalt) ‚Äì The family's helpful goblin dog that pretends to be a regular dog while on Earth. He is shown to have the ability to freeze and unfreeze time in specific situations. He is deeply fond of many pop-culture sensations which explains his love for pop stars like Lady Gaga and the Jonas Brothers. Pazuzu and Vlaartark are often found together, generally up to some sort of mischief. * Vlaartark Mimlark (voiced by Kyle McCulloch) ‚Äì The eccentric, possibly schizophrenic, uncle of Josh and Mandy. He enjoys eating cats. He also considers himself of a higher standard, judging by his voice and general knowledge. It's never stated if he's Balthazor or Tina's brother, though they both called him \\"uncle\\" as well. He also has gerontophilia. * Mandy Hellman (voiced by Tracey Fairaway) ‚Äì Balthazor and Tina's attractive yet materialistic teenage daughter who speaks with a Valley girl accent. She appears as vain, shallow and obsessed with her cell phone usually texting. She can erase people's memories from their minds. Despite shallow tendencies, she broke up with Killbride's son Wayne when he showed cruelty to disabled or unpopular kids. She is 15 years old and shown to be ambidextrous. * Josh Hellman (voiced by David Soren) ‚Äì Balthazor and Tina's preteen son. A chubby, immature and mischievous young demon boy. He has the ability to emit lasers from his eyes, can talk with animals, and has re- animation powers (only on animals thus far). He is shown to enjoy playing video games. He also likes annoying and fighting with his sister. He also had a crush on a neighborhood girl named Bethany. He is 12 years old. =Secondary= * Don Killbride (voiced by Kurtwood Smith) ‚Äì Balthazor's boss and head of Petromundo. He is very ruthless, corrupt, cynical and somewhat of a sadist. He takes a liking towards Balthazar and treats him with the littlest of respect. He is often seen with an oversize golf club. His several vices include bribery, inflicting physical harm, \\"dog golf\\", exploiting cheap labor and beating and cheating on his wives. Balthazor sees Killbride as more evil than Satan. He also has a physical attraction to Tina. Overall he is a businessman, and promotes Balthazor when he does his job well. He is a polygamist as he said he has six wives, and only two were shown. * Marjoe Saint Sparks (voiced by Dina Waters) ‚Äì The crazy, talkative, annoying and stereotypical Southern Belle next-door neighbor. She engages in bestiality with her dog Champers and annoys Tina to no end. She has a tendency to pop out at random times. Champers often tries to kill himself. She loves to chat about her sex life and family. In the first episode, she is oblivious that Tina is deliberately trying to strangle her to death. * Chevdet Tevetoglu (voiced by Kyle McCulloch) ‚Äì Chevdet is Balthazor's best friend and the chief engineer behind the drill project at Petromundo. As a recent immigrant, Chevdet works hard to make a better life for his large Turkish family. When he is not working on the drill or enduring Killbride's constant ethnic slurs, he is often hanging out with Balthazor. *Satan (voiced by Steve Coogan) ‚Äì He is the one who sent the Hellmans to Earth to destroy the drill that would enable the humans to invade Hell. He seems to be fond of Tina's looks, but does not take care to Balthazor. He seems to always have a little monkey-like demon assistant on his shoulder, which is implied to be his sexual lover. Satan once called the servant \\"a nasty little bitch\\" then claiming he loves him that way. He is often sarcastic and witty, appearing at the end of each episode to inquire about the Hellman's progress toward destroying the drill. In the season finale, he finally sees Killbride, and says \\"Woah, that was Killbride? He is scary. Not a nice person.\\", hinting some fear of him. Before disappearing in a puff of smoke he usually leaves the room with the comment, \\"Satan, out!\\". He is also lactose intolerant. =Recurring= * Champers ‚Äì Marjoe's pet poodle. He is suicidal as he is forced into sexual relations with his owner. Throughout the series, he tries to kill himself in different ways, but ends up in failure due to random things (usually caused by the main characters). * Lorelai Killbride (voiced by Mimi Rogers) ‚Äì The supposed sixth wife of Don Killbride. A typical snobby trophy wife. She is shown to be as cynical and evil as Tina, with the exception of being a racist. The two become friends rather quickly, but when Lorelai sees Josh, she derides him, to Tina's disliking. She gets drunk often, and was the target of demon possession after willingly abiding by Tina's supposed want for a sexual encounter. She also once did a donkey show. * Wayne Killbride (voiced by Eric Christian Olsen) ‚Äì The 21-year-old son of Don Killbride. It is unknown whether he is also Lorelai's son or from a previous marriage. He is attractive but very immature, obnoxious and somewhat intellectually challenged as he is still in the 10th grade.

He was a member of the U.S. House of Representatives for one term, representing parts of South Florida from 2011 to 2013. Early life, education, and early career Rivera was born in New York City on September 16, 1965 and moved to Florida in 1974. Both his father, a cab driver, and his mother Daisy, a driving instructor, had fled Cuba after the political rise of Fidel Castro. He graduated from Miami Christian High School. He earned his Bachelor of Arts degree with honors in Political Science from Florida International University in 1986 and his MPA in 1994. After college, Rivera worked as Public Affairs Director for the Washington D.C.-based Valladares Foundation, an international human rights NGO. The organization was founded by U.S. Ambassador Armando Valladares, the former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Human Rights Commission. Then, he worked for the Office of Cuba Broadcasting managed by auspices of the U.S. State Department. He has also been an adjunct professor in the FIU School of Policy and Management. His articles on U.S.-Cuba relations have been published in The Miami Herald and El Nuevo Herald. Florida House of Representatives In 2002, he ran for Florida's 112th state house district. He defeated Ray Gonzalez in the Republican primary, 52‚Äì48%. He won the general election unopposed. He won re- election unopposed in 2004, 2006, and 2008. In the Florida House, Rivera chaired the rules committee before serving as chairman of the appropriations committee from 2009 to 2010, where he pushed to create new professional schools at FIU and helped the Miami-Dade delegation work within a tight state budget. ‚ÄúWe are all geared toward finding cost savings,‚Äù he explained to the Herald. Alongside his support for tax-free back-to-school shopping holidays, Rivera sponsored a measure forbidding places of higher education in Florida from sponsoring and paying for research trips to Cuba. And it was Cuba, perhaps more than any other issue that emerged as Rivera‚Äôs main issue concern in Tallahassee: ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs the most important issue to me,‚Äù he said in the winter of 2004. ‚ÄúI think every Cuban American from whatever walk of life has a moral obligation to continue the cause of a free and Democratic Cuba. In addition to his legislative office, he has served the Republican Party as State Committeeman for the Republican Party of Florida and as the Executive Director for the Republican Party of Miami-Dade County. U.S. House of RepresentativesElections= ;2010 In January 2009, Rivera filed to run for the state senate seat being vacated by J. Alex Villalobos. However, when neighboring U.S. Congressman Lincoln D√≠az-Balart decided not to run for another term in 2010, his brother, U.S. Congressman Mario D√≠az-Balart, opted to run for a new term in Lincoln's district rather than his current one. This created an opening in the seat and prompted Rivera to announce he would run for Florida's 25th congressional district on February 25, 2010. On August 24, he won the Republican primary with 63% of the vote. On November 2, Rivera defeated Democratic nominee Joe Garcia 52%‚Äì43%. ;2012 Redistricting resulted in Rivera's district being renumbered as the 26th district. It lost its share of Collier County and picked up the Florida Keys, as well as portions of Miami-Dade County. While the old 25th leaned Republican, the new 26th is more of a swing district and is equally split between Democrats and Republicans. In a rematch from 2010, Garcia defeated Rivera 54%‚Äì43%. =Tenure= In 2012, Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington labeled Rivera \\"one of the most corrupt members of Congress.\\" =Committee assignments= * Committee on Foreign Affairs ** Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations ** Subcommittee on the Western Hemisphere * Committee on Natural Resources ** Subcommittee on Energy and Mineral Resources ** Subcommittee on National Parks, Forests and Public Lands  Later career  In May 2014, Rivera announced he would run for Congress again. He was defeated in the Republican primary, coming in fourth place with 7.5% of the vote. In March 2016, David Rivera announced he would run for the open state house district 118, but lost to Democrat Robert Asencio by 53 votes. In March 2017, Rivera announced he would run for the state house again in 2018, this time in neighboring district 105.

Creativity has been classified as a neo-Nazi hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center and Anti- Defamation League. It was founded in Lighthouse Point, Florida by Ben Klassen as the Church of the Creator in 1973. The worldview of Creativity is purported to be naturalistic and racialist based on the \\"survival, expansion and advancement of the White race\\", according to the \\"eternal laws of nature, the experience of history, on logic and common sense\\"Race Over Grace: The Racialist Religion of the Christian Identity Movement and members of the movement believe in a \\"racial holy war\\" between the \\"white and non-White races\\" (including Jews, black people and non-white people of \\"mixed race\\").Hate Crimes: Causes, Controls, and Controversies, page 147DOMESTIC TERRORISM AND INCIDENT MANAGEMENT: Issues and Tactics, page 121The Encyclopedia of Cults, Sects, and New Religions, page 218The New White Nationalism in America: Its Challenge to Integration, page 41 Creativity is promoted by two organizations: the Creativity Alliance (CA ‚Äì also known as the Church of Creativity) and the Creativity Movement (TCM). The groups have common origins. Name Adherents of Creativity refer to themselves as Creators, a term derived from Adolf Hitler's Mein Kampf in his classification of \\"races\\" into three categories, with the \\"White race\\" the Master race: the \\"creators\\". The organization was originally founded as the Church of the Creator by Ben Klassen in 1973. In 1996 Matthew F. Hale along with other ministers of the original Church of the Creator formed a successor group known as the World Church of the Creator. The World Church of the Creator was renamed The Creativity Movement in 2003. Hale's right to use the name \\"Church of the Creator\\" in the United States was lost to the Church of the Creator, an unaffiliated religious organization based in Ashland, Oregon, in a trademark infringement case. Membership in the Creativity movement is restricted to persons whose genetic heritage is \\"wholly or predominantly\\" from Europe or members of the white race, regardless of where they reside. The term \\"Creator\\" does not refer to a supernatural being, but to adherents of Creativity and the White Race (which is credited with the creation of \\"all worthwhile culture and civilization\\"). Following the demise of the World Church of the Creator after Hale's arrest in 2003, there formed two distinct groups known as The Creativity Movement and the Creativity Alliance/Church of Creativity. The two groups are not known to interact with one another. Beliefs White Separatism is fundamental to Creativity, and as such, Creators are taught to hate and avoid interacting with non-whites socially. Creators are also expected to refute homosexuality, miscegenation, whining or complaining, and superstition. Creativity has \\"Sixteen Commandments\\" and \\"Five Fundamental Beliefs\\" which adherents are supposed to recite five times daily, including the belief that \\"their race is their religion\\", that the White race is \\"nature's finest creation\\", that racial loyalty is the \\"greatest honor\\" and racial treason is the \\"worst crime\\", that anything beneficial for White people is good and anything detrimental for White people is bad, and that Creativity is the \\"one and only, true and revolutionary White racial religion\\", refuting other similar racist religions such as Christian Identity or Wotanism. They believe that American culture is becoming \\"more decadent,\\" as evidenced by \\"black crimes, the growing acceptance of homosexuality, interracial marriage, increasing drug use, and the lack of racial identity among white people\\". According to the Anti-Defamation League, members believe that Jewish people are working towards the enslavement of all races, and in particular the \\"mongrelization of the white race\\". Klassen encouraged the term \\"nigger\\" in referring to Black people and openly opposed white supremacists who used more polite terms. During the early 2000s, they were encouraged to move to Central Illinois in order to establish a Creativity bastion. Creativity promotes a religious health code called Salubrious Living which includes dietary Fruitarianism which isn't regarded as an absolute requirement for membership. =Afterlife and the supernatural= Creativity fundamentally rejects supernaturalism while affirming a naturalistic pantheistAmerica's Secret Jihad: The Hidden History of Religious Terrorism in the United States view of nature, asserting that \\"everything is in nature\\" and defining it as \\"the whole cosmos, the total universe, including its millions of natural laws through space and time.\\" According to Klassen, \\"A Creator is not superstitious and disdains belief in the supernatural. He will waste no time giving credence to, or playing silly games with imaginary spooks, spirits, gods and demons.\\" They do not believe Nature to be a conscious entity but do believe that the laws of Nature are \\"eternal\\" and a fundamental law of Nature regarding lifeforms is the \\"inner-segregation of the species\\". Creators do not believe in a supernatural afterlife, believing \\"immortality\\" to be genetic and memorial, with a cessation of consciousness at death. They believe that they should view life and death on Earth in a \\"rational, fearless manner,\\" concentrating on life's positive aspects. Whereas Ben Klassen was classified by some as an atheistGod & Apple Pie: Religious Myths and Visions of America By Christopher Buck, Page 190Religious Bodies in the U.S.: A DictionaryHome-grown Hate: Gender and Organized Racism WCOTC Background, Page 93 and Creativity has been labelled atheistic in the press,https://missoulian.com/uncategorized/town- comes-together-before-world-church- meeting/article_3297e0a4-b2df-5de4-8eb5-22416779b359.html Town comes together before World Church meeting Klassen rejected the term, viewing atheism as a negative approach to a positive evil, claiming atheism lacks a \\"positive creed and program\\" to replace the Abrahamic religions and isn't inherently racist.The New White Nationalism in America: Its Challenge to Integration page 390 Atheism and Creativity both reject supernatural beliefs, such as those in gods, devils, spooks, spirits, heaven or hell. Others have used the term non- theistic in lieu of the term \\"atheistic\\" in classification of Creativity. =Racial socialism= The Southern Poverty Law Center classifies Creativity's ideology as neo-Nazi. According to Klassen, Creativity is not a rehash of Nazism and he listed eight differences between his political ideology and that of the Nazis. He adopted the phrase \\"racial socialism\\" to describe his political ideology. Klassen was critical of democracy and advocated meritocracy, believing that effective leaders should rule. Under racial socialism, \\"whites would work together toward common goals but without the massive economic planning in the style of the Soviet Gosplan.\\" He supported a limited market economy, believing that social and economic activities should be in the best interests of white people. Klassen criticized \\"leftist proclivities\\" to recruit from the white working class: \\"All [white] members of the national or racial community ... had an important role to play.\\" Klassen urged Creators to \\"work feverishly and aggressively to organize politically, to distribute literature on behalf of the White Race, to promote and foster White solidarity, and to get control of the government and the political machinery of the state by legal means if possible. If this is not possible by legal means, then we must resort to the same means as our forefathers used two hundred years ago to defend their liberty, their property, their homes and their families.\\" =Activism= Creativity engages in proselytism. Its goal is to place 10 million copies of two books, Nature's Eternal Religion and The White Man's Bible, into the hands of white people as part of its belief in \\"gird[ing] up for total war\\". It teaches the white genocide conspiracy theory in support of its perception that shifting population demographics is leading to miscegenation. According to the Ontario Consultants on Religious Tolerance, the Creativity Movement opposes illegal activity and violence, believing it to be counterproductive. The church's member handbook threatens expulsion from the church for members who commit crimes or encourage others to do so. Despite this, the church has been connected to multiple religiously and racially inspired violent crimes. Creators view \\"racial holy war\\" (Rahowa) as a religious war of racial self-defense. The White Man's Bible says the Zionist Occupational Government will prevent Creativity from being promoted legally, and tells its readers that \\"when that stage arrives (and we can well expect that our Jewish tyrants will push us to the limit), then we must again plan our actions accordingly‚Äîand deliberately, carefully and ruthlessly\\" calling for readers to, \\"use any means, legal or otherwise, available to us for our own survival,\\" leading to the hunting down and eliminating of \\"tormentors\\". PracticesHolidays= The religion has several holidays. Creators are encouraged to observe them, spending time with their families and friends of the religion: * South Victory Day (January 26): Commemorates the initial British landings on the Australian continent in 1788. In Australia, the same event is celebrated as Australia Day and is a national holiday. * Klassen Day (February 20): Anniversary of its founder's birth in 1918. * Founding Day (February 21): Anniversary of the publication of Nature‚Äôs Eternal Religion in 1973. * Foundation Day, Rahowa Day (March 20): Anniversary of the foundation of the World Center in 1982 and a reminder of racial war. * Kozel Day, Martyr's Day (September 15): Commemorates Brian Kozel, who died on this date in 1992. * Festum Album (December 26 ‚Äì January 1): Week-long celebration of white racial pride, commemorating the Wounded Knee Massacre. December 29, the anniversary of the massacre is also marked as \\"West Victory Day\\". =Ceremonies= Creativity has four sacraments: marriage, pledging for children, confirmation, and eulogizing the dead. All ceremonies are performed by church ministers. At a wedding, the bride and groom exchange vows before Nature. The pledging ceremony is ideally conducted a week after a child's birth, with both parents pledging to raise their child as a \\"loyal member of the White Race and faithful to the church.\\" The confirmation ceremony may be performed on or after a child's 13th birthday. =Ministers= On a now- defunct website, Klassen stated that anyone could be an ordained minister in his church, provided they were \\"a legitimate White Man or Woman over the age of 16.\\" Prospective ministers must demonstrate worthiness and pass written and oral examinations. The written exams consist of 150 questions (requiring a one-paragraph response to each) and an essay. Applicants are encouraged to request recommendations from three established ministers, and the final requirement is the signing of an oath. Books Creativity's founding text is Nature's Eternal Religion, which was written by Klassen in 1973. The book proposes that white people are the \\"supreme act of creation\\", and only white people are capable of divine creativity. The first book critiques Christianity, including the Christian Bible. Many biblical stories, including those of Adam and Eve, Jonah and the whale and the resurrection of Jesus, are considered historically unlikely. The historicity of Jesus is also questioned, with Klassen adhering to the Christ myth theory saying that he can find no independent evidence of his existence. According to Creativity, Christianity is a violent religion which has killed 1,000 fellow Christians for every Christian killed by the Romans. Adherents do not believe in the existence of Jesus, rejecting Christian teachings as a \\"suicidal poison\\" that was created by Jews and foisted on the white race. They reject the exhortation to love one's enemies, believing that enemies should be hated. Creators also reject the Golden Rule, saying that it does not make \\"good sense\\" and at a \\"closer look\\" it is a \\"completely unworkable principle.\\" Klassen published other books on his white supremacist philosophy, including The White Man's Bible, which called for violence against any perceived threats to white people. History Creativity was formed in 1973, when Klassen self-published Nature's Eternal Religion. He attempted to recruit neo-Nazis into the church because, apart from disagreements over religion, there was no fundamental conflict between church doctrine and National Socialism. Klassen developed a rapport with National Alliance leader William Luther Pierce; he met Pierce twice in 1975, and they maintained an \\"on and off\\" relationship for the next 18 years. According to Klassen, he \\"never did understand the logic of what [Pierce] called his Cosmotheism religion ... it has not been of any significance as far as our common goal of promoting White racial solidarity was concerned.\\" In Trials, Tribulations, and Triumphs, Klassen called Pierce \\"a great man and an outstanding intellectual thinker, and ... one of us.\\" In 1982, Klassen established a Creativity headquarters in Otto, North Carolina. Although his family expected resistance from local residents, Klassen wrote: \\"We were not quite prepared for the viciousness of the onslaught by the local paper.\\" Opposition grew, and a May 13, 1982 Franklin Press headline read: \\"Pro-Hitler, anti-Christ Leader Headquarters Here\\".Trials, Tribulations, and Triumphs FiguresGaede family= April Harrington (Gaede), mother of Lynx and Lamb Lingelser (Gaede) of the band Prussian Blue, was a longtime supporter of Creativity and a member of the World Church of the Creator, naming her third daughter Dresden Hale after its leader Matthew F. Hale before joining the National Alliance and then the splinter National Vanguard. Prussian Blue's song \\"Stand Up,\\" written for David Lane (author of the Fourteen Words), was part of the unreleased Free Matt Hale CD intended to support the incarcerated Hale. Lamb and Lynx Gaede have denounced the movement, saying that they never chose it and were controlled by their mother. =Craig Cobb= Cobb, who operated the video-sharing website Podblanc, has attempted to take over small towns in the Midwestern United States. He tried to establish an enclave in North Dakota and rename it \\"Trump Creativity\\" or \\"Creativity Trump\\" for Donald Trump. A church building purchased by Cobb to establish an enclave was \\"burned to the ground\\" in Nome, North Dakota. =George Burdi= Also known as George Eric Hawthorne, Burdi was lead singer of the Canadian metal band Rahowa, leader of the Toronto branch of the Church of the Creator, and founder of Resistance Records.The Toronto Star, August 14, 1993 He was convicted of assault, and renounced racism after serving time in prison.Intelligence Report, Fall 2001, Issue Number: 103 Burdi has been credited with a role in Creativity's survival after the death of Ben Klassen. =Matthew F. Hale= Several years after Klassen's 1993 death, white supremacist Matthew Hale founded the New Church of the Creator (later the World Church of the Creator). Hale made national news when he was denied admission to the Illinois State Bar on three occasions due to his racist beliefs.Evan Osnos and James Janega. \\"ACLU Sides With Supremacist on Right to Obtain Law License.\\" Chicago Tribune 12 Aug. 1999: 4. Print. On November 12, 1999 the Illinois Supreme Court refused to further consider the denial of Hale's law license, continuing \\"a decision by its Committee on Character and Fitness that said Hale lacked the moral character to practice law.\\"\\"Review of Law License Denial.\\" Washington Post 13 Nov. 1999: A5. Print. According to Hale, the committee's denial of his law license may have provoked Benjamin Nathaniel Smith's drive-by shootings. On January 9, 2003, Hale was arrested and charged with attempting to direct security chief Anthony Evola to murder judge Joan Lefkow. Hale was found guilty of four of five counts (one count of solicitation of murder and three counts of obstruction of justice) on April 26, 2004; in April 2005, he was sentenced to 40 years in a Federal penitentiary. =Johannes Grobbelaar and Jurgen White= Johannes Grobbelaar and Jurgen White, Afrikaner Creators and members of the National Socialist Partisans (the paramilitary branch of the Blanke Bevrydingsbeweging), were killed in a November 1991 gun battle with South African police near Upington while attempting to smuggle weapons and explosives into a survivalist compound in Namibia. They were stopped by police, who were suspicious that their vehicle had been stolen. According to the report, while being escorted to a nearby police station they detonated a smoke bomb and attempted to escape. Police discovered their abandoned vehicle five miles away; Grobbelaar and White ambushed them. Two officers were shot, one fatally. =Ron McVan= Ron McVan, co-founder of the Wotansvolk racialist pagan group, was once affiliated with the Church of the Creator for two years as its second-in-command; McVan contributed articles and artwork to its periodical, Racial Loyalty, and was a martial-arts instructor for the church. Although Klassen and McVan shared anti-Christian beliefs, McVan sought a more spiritual approach and felt that Creativity needed spirituality. He moved to the Pacific Northwest and founded Wotan's Kindred in Portland, Oregon in 1992, saying that the group was rooted in the \\"genetic character and collective identity\\" of the white race. David Lane, McVan's associate and co-founder of Wotansvolk, drew inspiration from Creativity, particularly ideas of a \\"racial religion\\", but didn't agree with Creativity's \\"atheistic\\" stance and considered himself deist. =William Christopher Gibbs= William Christopher Gibbs, a Church of Creativity adherent in Georgia and a member of the Creativity Alliance, was arrested for possession of the biological toxin ricin. Gibbs went to a hospital after he accidentally got the ricin on his hands while experimenting with it. On September 21, 2018, a Federal judge ordered Gibbss' release from Federal custody because of a technicality: ricin had been inexplicably dropped from the list of illegal biological toxins which are known as \\"select agents\\" due to changes in the 2004 law and edits to regulations in 2005. The judge did not rule out the possibility that Gibbs could be potentially convicted under another Federal law. Gibbs continued to be incarcerated in the Fannin County, Georgia jail under a misdemeanor charge of reckless conduct which stemmed from his 2017 arrest and a probation violation connected to a 2010 conviction for burglary.Joyner, Chris (October 2, 2018) \\"Ricin charges dropped against Georgia white supremacist\\" Atlanta Journal-Constitution Legal problems and reorganization In 1992, faced with financial and legal problems (including a civil lawsuit filed by the Southern Poverty Law Center) and the death of his wife, the aging Klassen looked for a successor. Although Rudolph G. (\\"Butch\\") Stanko was favored for the position, he was imprisoned at the time. Shortly before and during McCarty's leadership, Creativity was plagued with legal problems; members were arrested for conspiracy, unlawful firearms possession and their association with the July 1993 firebombing of an NAACP building in Tacoma, Washington. McCarty struggled to keep the group unified. The lawsuit filed by the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC), seeking damages related to the May 1991 murder of Harold Mansfield, Jr. by Creator George Loeb, finally led to a March 1994 court ruling which fined the Church of the Creator $1,000,000. The court also ruled that Klassen's property sale to Pierce shortly before his suicide was collusion to deny payment to Mansfield's family, ordering Pierce to return his $85,000 profit from the resale of the property. With the church unable to pay the outstanding balance, the SPLC sued for its dissolution to settle the remaining damages and McCarty readily agreed.Florida Department of State, Document # 237320644 =Creativity Movement= Creativity Movement logo Matthew F. Hale founded the New Church of the Creator in 1996, later renamed the World Church of the Creator. Hale's World Church of the Creator was a new and separate group rather than a direct successor to Ben Klassen's Church of the Creator. Until his arrest in 2003, Hale was the only Pontifex Maximus of the now-defunct World Church of the Creator. The current group known as The Creativity Movement is a white power skinhead-oriented direct successor to Hale's World Church of the Creator. Headquartered in Zion, Illinois, with a heavy concentration of Creators in Montana, and 24 regional branches, it also claims to have local branches and members \\"all over the world.\\" In 2000 the Oregon-based TE-TA-MA Truth Foundation filed a lawsuit against the World Church of the Creator for using the name \\"Church of the Creator\\", since the Oregon group had trademarked and registered the name in 1982. U.S. District Court Judge Joan Lefkow ruled for the World Church of the Creator. In December 2002, the World Church of the Creator was fined $1,000 for each day it continued using the old name. Further appeals were denied by the U.S. Supreme Court in 2003.A Supreme Court of the United States denial of further review (certiorari) was issued in January 2003. Hale was charged with contempt of court and soliciting the murder of judge Joan Lefkow, and sentenced to 40 years' imprisonment on April 6, 2005.Natasha Korecki and Frank Main, \\"Hale gets max: 40 years in prison,\\" Chicago Sun Times, 7 April 2005, Bill White was convicted of threatening a juror in the Matthew Hale case and sentenced to 42 months in prison. In early 2017, a group referring to itself as the \\"Guardians of the Faith Committee\\" of the Creativity Movement elected James Costello of England as its \\"Pontifex Maximus\\". =Creativity Alliance= According to a Southern Poverty Law Center report, in 2015 the Creativity Alliance had groups in Georgia, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Utah and Vermont. Cambeul's title is Church Administrator and refers to his chapter of the group as the Church of Creativity South Australia. The current Pontifex Maximus of Creativity Alliance is Joseph Esposito (Church of Creativity Oregon). The Creativity Alliance was for a short period known as the White Crusaders of the Rahowa (WCOTR), which was founded by former World Church of the Creator Members after Hale's arrest in 2003. Creativity Alliance members include former Klassen supporters George Loeb and Joseph Esposito, each serving extended prison sentences in Florida. The Alliance has distanced itself from Hale, and no longer actively supports him. Randolph Dilloway, former Hasta Primus (Secretary or 2nd in Command) of the Creativity Alliance and founder of the defunct Smoky Mountains Church of Creativity, was an accountant for the revived National Alliance (an unaffiliated neo-Nazi group formerly led by William Luther Pierce author of the Turner Diaries) and assessed financial damage under past leadership. Claiming to fear for his life after discovering (and discussing) the errors, Dilloway contacted police and the SPLC and furnished documents alleging fraud and embezzlement by organization members. Creativity Alliance members are known to regularly distribute flyers; particularly in Australia and New Zealand, and in 2015 it distributed flyers in Inverbervie (Scotland) and Liverpool. A reverend speaking on behalf of the Church of Creativity Britain said in a letter to the editor that the leaflets were legal and called for racial separation, not supremacy. The South Australian Attorney-General and the Minister for Multicultural Affairs have made a number of attempts to close the website of the South Australian representative and Pontifex Maximus of the Creativity Alliance and outlaw the organization. Cailen Cambeul filed a complaint with the Australian Press Council that describing the Creativity Alliance as a white-supremacist organization (rather than a religion) and characterizing its members as \\"a few loners looking for something to do with all their hate\\" was unfair. His complaint was dismissed on the basis that the journalist's assessment was not a news article but an opinion piece. Creativity Alliance web pages and published books stress that they make no attempt to assume or supersede the registered trademark \\"Church of the Creator\\", owned by the TE-TA-MA Truth Foundation. In 2017 they were found to be responsible for the distribution of flyers throughout Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Members who have been arrested include a man from the Church of Creativity Georgia who was arrested for attempting to make ricin poisonhttp://www.fox5atlanta.com/news/234422246-story (the charge was later dropped),https://thebrunswicknews.com/judge-rules- georgia-man-s-ricin-possession-didn-t- break/article_1e6eea5d-d71e-58a2-9caf-a17f1423d269.html and Hardy Lloyd, a member from Pennsylvania, was arrested for violating his probation by distributing racist flyers, hoarding weapons, and participating in white supremacist web forums. Other legal cases Creativity was recognized as a religion by the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin in Peterson v. Wilmur Communications (205 F.Supp.2d 1014) (2002).Decision and Order: Peterson v. Wilmur Communications. 205 F.Supp.2d 1014 (2002). United States District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin. The American Civil Liberties Union intervened on behalf of the World Church of the Creator. California federal judge Maxine M. Chesney ruled against an imprisoned Creator who brought a suit against Pelican Bay State Prison based on an alleged violation of the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act in Conner v. Tilton, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 111892 (ND CA, Dec. 2, 2009), in which Creativity and several other organizations and belief systems (including MOVE, veganism and the Church of Marijuana) were declared to not constitute \\"religions\\" but moral or secular philosophies under the definition of religion based on addressing of \\"fundamental and ultimate questions having to do with deep and imponderable matters\\" as part of a three-point test for determining religion developed by the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. The court concluded that the plaintiff had failed to raise a genuine issue about whether Creativity is a religion; it found that to the extent Creativity deals with a \\"fundamental concern\\", the concern is with secular matters and not with what the court considered to be religious principles. Creativity is not \\"comprehensive\\" in nature because it was presented as confined to one question (or moral teaching), and that the structural characteristics of Creativity \\"do not serve to transform what are otherwise secular teachings and ideals into a religious ideology.\\" In Hale v. Federal Bureau of Prisons (2015), the court found that Creativity may qualify as a religion under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution (with potential tax exemption by the IRS) and may be practiced in prison. Furthermore, on March 12, 1989, U.S. federal judge Fern M. Smith of the United States District Court for the Northern District of California ordered San Quentin prison authorities to return \\"The White Man's Bible\\" to an inmate after it was confiscated and the state failed to prove that the book presented an imminent danger. Leafletting campaigns In March 2015, leaflets were posted on doors in southern Liverpool in the United Kingdom saying: \\"The white race is nature‚Äôs finest\\". Cailen Cambeul, Creativity minister and then Pontifex Maximus for the Creativity Alliance, said that he was responsible for their distribution. Complaints were made to the police by local councilors. Sarah Jennings of the local Green Party denounced Creativity as a \\"fringe group of blatant racists\\". According to Cambeul, \\"Any politician claiming disgust at our flyers and seeking to make political gains via our 100-percent-legal message is partaking in an opportunistic abuse of power at the expense of innocent people exercising their rights to speak out against the injustices of a politically correct world.\\" In the United States, northwest Montana and in particular the Flathead Valley has seen a \\"flurry of racist fliers\\" promoting the Creativity movement. The Southern Poverty Law Center listed Creativity Alliance presence in the state in 2015.

Cox and Brent Dalrymple. This work was a major step in the development of plate tectonics. Doell shared the Vetlesen Prize with Cox and Dalrymple. Life and career Doell was born in Oakland, California in 1923 and grew up in Carpinteria, California. After serving for 2 years as a combat infantryman during World War II, he resumed his studies at UC Berkeley, where he earned his doctorate in geophysics in 1955. Following graduation, Richard held teaching positions at the University of Toronto and MIT. Richard joined the U.S. Geological Survey Geophysics Branch in Menlo Park, California, in 1959 where he specialized in research on the Earth‚Äôs magnetic field and remanent magnetization in rocks. He was an integral member of a team that presented convincing evidence of periodic polarity reversals of earth‚Äôs main magnetic field by analyzing magnetization of rock samples collected from widely separated, geologically young, volcanic sequences. Furthermore, isotopic dating of the rock samples provided the first time scale of polarity epochs for the last 3.2 million years.\\"Geomagnetic polarity epochs; Sierra Nevada II\\" Allan V. Cox, Richard Doell and G. Brent Dalrymple, Science, vol.142, no.3590, pp.382-385, 1963 The timed sequence of reversals, with subsequent refinements by this USGS team and others, proved to be a major component of the plate tectonics revolution in the mid-to late 1960s. It not only provided the basis for confirming the hypothesis of sea floor spreading, but it also was a technique for quantifying rates and amounts of crustal plate movements on a global scale.http://www.usgs.gov/125/articles/plate_tectonics.html For his numerous unique pioneering scientific contributions and leadership, Richard Doell was elected to the United States National Academy of Sciences in 1969 and he shared the prestigious Vetlesen Prize with Allan V.

It was first described by zoologists Bruce D. Patterson and Albuja V. Luis in 1996. It is the largest caenolestid. The IUCN classifies it as vulnerable. As of 2015, the population is estimated at less than 1,000.  Taxonomy and etymology  The Andean caenolestid is one of the five members of Caenolestes, and is placed in the family Caenolestidae (shrew opossums). It was first described by zoologists Bruce D. Patterson (of the Field Museum of Natural History) and Albuja V. Luis (of the National Polytechnic School) in 1996 from an adult male specimen captured from Cordillera del C√≥ndor (Ecuador). They procured a total of three specimens. In the latter part of 20th century, scientists believed that Caenolestes is closely related to Lestoros (the Incan caenolestid). Over the years, it became clear that Lestoros is morphologically different from Caenolestes. A 2013 morphological and mitochondrial DNA-based phylogenetic study showed that the Incan caenolestid and the long-nosed caenolestid (Rhyncholestes raphanurus) form a clade sister to Caenolestes. The cladogram below is based on this study. Caenolestid fossils date to as early as the early Eocene (nearly 55 mya). The generic name Caenolestes derives from the Greek words kainos (\\"new\\") and lestes (\\"robber\\", \\"pirate\\"). The specific epithet condorensis is based on the name of the type locality, Cordillera del C√≥ndor. It is also known by the name 'Condor caenolestid'.  Description  Patterson and Luis identified the Andean caenolestid as the largest in its family. It is characterized by large, heavy canines, long rostrum (nearly long), massive skull (nearly long), whitish whiskers, dark brown coat, and a dark spot on the chest. The mean external measurements recorded from the three specimens were as follows: the total length was , the weight was , the tail was long, the hindfeet measured and the ears . Sexual dimorphism is prominent, with males larger than females.  Distribution and status  The Andean caenolestid is known only from Cordillera del C√≥ndor, which is located in the eastern Andes. The locality is characterized by ash deposits dating to the Cretaceous, vegetation less than in height and bromeliads (locally known as \\"achupallas\\"). The specimens were captured on the ecotone (interface) between the short grassy vegetation of the plateau and the higher, wooded slopes. The IUCN classifies it as vulnerable. As of 2015, the population is estimated at less than 1,000.

Plot summary \\"Minus One\\" is set in Green Hill Asylum, whose motto is \\"There is a Green Hill Far, Far Away\\". It provides a private prison where the rich can incarcerate \\"miscreant or unfortunate relatives whose presence would otherwise be a burden or embarrassment\\". Security rather than treatment comes first and the asylum boasted that no-one had ever escaped, that is until the disappearance of a patient called Hinton. Thorough searches are conducted and staff questioned but no trace of him can be found. Dr. Mellinger, the director of the asylum leads the investigation and it transpires that nobody can remember much about him at all. Dr Mellinger realises that the patients are not being treated as individuals and decides that from then on the regime of Green Hill will change to take more interest in the individual. Still the disappearance of Hinton remains unexplained; Dr. Mellinger looks at Hinton's file and realises that it is the only evidence of him ever having existed. Fortuitously the file is then \\"lost\\" and the director announces that the disappearance was an administrative error and that Hinton had never really existed. All are happy until a visitor arrives at the hospital to see her husband. It is Mrs Hinton. As she is obviously suffering from delusions in need of treatment she is forcibly admitted.

It implements the media gateway control protocol architecture for controlling media gateways connected to the public switched telephone network (PSTN).RFC 2805, Media Gateway Control Protocol Architecture and Requirements, N. Greene, M. Ramalho, B. Rosen, IETF, April 2000 The media gateways provide conversion of traditional electronic media to the Internet Protocol (IP) network. The protocol is a successor to the Simple Gateway Control Protocol (SGCP), which was developed by Bellcore and Cisco, and the Internet Protocol Device Control (IPDC). The methodology of MGCP reflects the structure of the PSTN with the power of the network residing in a call control center softswitch which is analogous to the central office in the telephone network. The endpoints are low-intelligence devices, mostly executing control commands from a call agent or media gateway controller in the softswitch and providing result indications in response. The protocol represents a decomposition of other VoIP models, such as H.323 and the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP), in which the endpoint devices of a call have higher levels of signaling intelligence. MGCP is a text-based protocol consisting of commands and responses. It uses the Session Description Protocol (SDP) for specifying and negotiating the media streams to be transmitted in a call session and the Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP) for framing the media streams. Architecture Gateway Control Protocol Relationship The media gateway control protocol architecture and its methodologies and programming interfaces are described in RFC 2805. MGCP is a master-slave protocol in which media gateways (MGs) are controlled by a call control agent or softswitch. This controller is called a media gateway controller (MGC) or call agent (CA). With the network protocol it can control each specific port on a media gateway. This facilitates centralized gateway administration and provides scalable IP telephony solutions. The distributed system is composed of at least one call agent and one or usually, multiple media gateways, which performs the conversion of media signals between circuit-switched and packet-switched networks, and at least one signaling gateway (SG) when connected to the PSTN. MGCP presents a call control architecture with limited intelligence at the edge (endpoints, media gateways) and intelligence at the core controllers. The MGCP model assumes that call agents synchronize with each other to send coherent commands and responses to the gateways under their control. The call agent uses MGCP to request event notifications, reports, status, and configuration data from the media gateway, as well as to specify connection parameters and activation of signals toward the PSTN telephony interface. A softswitch is typically used in conjunction with signaling gateways, for access to Signalling System No. 7 (SS7) functionality, for example. The call agent does not use MGCP to control a signaling gateway; rather, SIGTRAN protocols are used to backhaul signaling between a signaling gateway and the call agents. =Multiple call agents= Typically, a media gateway may be configured with a list of call agents from which it may accept control commands. In principle, event notifications may be sent to different call agents for each endpoint on the gateway, according to the instructions received from the call agents by setting the NotifiedEntity parameter. In practice, however, it is usually desirable that all endpoints of a gateway are controlled by the same call agent; other call agents are available to provide redundancy in the event that the primary call agent fails, or loses contact with the media gateway. In the event of such a failure it is the backup call agent's responsibility to reconfigure the media gateway so that it reports to the backup call agent. The gateway may be audited to determine the controlling call agent, a query that may be used to resolve any conflicts. In case of multiple call agents, MGCP assumes that they maintain knowledge of device state among themselves. Such failover features take into account both planned and unplanned outages. Protocol overview MGCP recognizes three essential elements of communication, the media gateway controller (call agent), the media gateway endpoint, and connections between these entities. A media gateway may host multiple endpoints and each endpoint should be able to engage in multiple connections. Multiple connections on the endpoints support calling features such as call waiting and three-way calling. MGCP is a text-based protocol using a command and response model. Commands and responses are encoded in messages that are structured and formatted with the whitespace characters space, horizontal tab, carriage return, linefeed, colon, and full stop. Messages are transmitted using the User Datagram Protocol (UDP). Media gateways use the port number 2427, and call agents use 2727 by default. The message sequence of command (or request) and its response is known as a transaction, which is identified by the numerical Transaction Identifier exchanged in each transaction. The protocol specification defines nine standard commands that are distinguished by a four-letter command verb: AUEP, AUCX, CRCX, DLCX, EPCF, MDCX, NTFY, RQNT, and RSIP. Responses begin with a three-digit numerical response code that identifies the outcome or result of the transaction. Two verbs are used by a call agent to query the state of an endpoint and its associated connections. *AUEP: Audit Endpoint *AUCX: Audit Connection Three verbs are used by a call agent to manage the connection to a media gateway endpoint. *CRCX: Create Connection *DLCX: Delete Connection. This command may also be issued by an endpoint to terminate a connection. *MDCX: Modify Connection. This command is used to alter operating characteristics of the connection, e.g. speech encoders, muting, half- duplex/full-duplex state and others. One verb is used by a call agent to request notification of events occurring at the endpoint, and to apply signals to the connected PSTN network link, or to a connected telephony endpoint, e.g., a telephone. *RQNT: Request for Notification One verb is used by an endpoint to indicate to the call agent that it has detected an event for which the call agent had previously requested notification with the RQNT command: *NTFY: Notify One verb is used by a call agent to modify coding characteristics expected by the line side of the endpoint: *EPCF: Endpoint Configuration One verb is used by an endpoint to indicate to the call agent that it is in the process of restarting: *RSIP: Restart In Progress Standards documents * RFC 3435 - Media Gateway Control Protocol (MGCP) Version 1.0 (this supersedes RFC 2705) * RFC 3660 - Basic Media Gateway Control Protocol (MGCP) Packages (informational) * RFC 3661 - Media Gateway Control Protocol (MGCP) Return Code Usage * RFC 3064 - MGCP CAS Packages * RFC 3149 - MGCP Business Phone Packages * RFC 3991 - Media Gateway Control Protocol (MGCP) Redirect and Reset Package * RFC 3992 - Media Gateway Control Protocol (MGCP) Lockstep State Reporting Mechanism (informational) * RFC 2805 - Media Gateway Control Protocol Architecture and Requirements * RFC 2897 - Proposal for an MGCP Advanced Audio Package Megaco Another implementation of the media gateway control protocol architecture is the H.248/Megaco protocol, a collaboration of the Internet Engineering Task Force (RFC 3525) and the International Telecommunication Union (Recommendation H.248.1). Both protocols follow the guidelines of the overlying media gateway control protocol architecture, as described in RFC 2805. However, the protocols are incompatible due to differences in protocol syntax and underlying connection model.

The symmetrical composition depicts Homer being crowned by a winged figure personifying Victory or the Universe. Forty-four additional figures pay homage to the poet in a kind of classical confession of faith. History A state commission to decorate a ceiling of the mus√©e Charles X at the Louvre (now the ancient Egyptian galleries), it formed part of a renovation project commissioned by Charles X to have himself remembered in the grand tradition of Bourbon building works at the Louvre. A condition of the commission was that it was to be completed within a year's time.Condon et al. 1983, p. 110. Upon receiving the commission, Ingres conceived the idea for his painting quickly‚Äîit was a source of pride to him that he had required only an hour to establish the broad outlines of his composition in a sketch. The subsequent care he took in developing his idea is evident in more than 100 drawings and numerous painted sketches for it that survive, in which he fixed the details more and more precisely. Ingres's level of research can be seen in the painting's portrait of Nicolas Poussin, which is directly copied from Poussin's 1650 self-portrait now in the Louvre. The composition is a symmetrical grouping centred in a classical way in front of an ancient Greek temple. The painting's catalogue entry at the time of its first exhibition described it as \\"Homer receiving homage from all the great men of Greece, Rome and modern times. The Universe crowns him, Herodotus burns incense.Behind Homer, to the left, with his head covered to make a sacrifice, as was customary in classical religious practice, as with the Via Labicana Augustus. The Iliad and Odyssey sit at his feet.\\" Study for Phidias in The Apotheosis of Homer, oil on canvas, 1827, San Diego Museum of Art The final painting's colours are very fresh and clear, giving the impression of fresco. Ingres wished to compete with Raphael through this painting (it is strongly inspired by the Italian artist's Parnassus) and Raphael is to be seen top left (in black and white Renaissance dress), being led by Apelles (in a blue cloak). Other figures shown include Dante who is shown being led by Virgil as in the former's Divine Comedy (extreme left, behind Poussin) and Moli√®re (right, by the feet of the personification of the Odyssey). The art historian Robert Rosenblum said The Apotheosis of Homer represents \\"Ingres' most doctrinaire statement of his belief in a hierarchy of timeless values that are based on classical precedent.\\"Rosenblum 1990, p. 100. It is highly successful in its genre, though leaves an impression of coldness, an impression which was reinforced at the time of its production by the exhibition of Delacroix's The Death of Sardanapalus at the same year's Paris Salon. Ingres had been considered revolutionary early in his career, but this contrast now faced off a Romantic renewal under Delacroix against the purest classical tradition as shown by Ingres. The Apotheosis of Homer was taken down from its initial site in 1855 and replaced later that year with a copy by Paul and Raymond Balze (in collaboration with Michel Dumas).The Balzes' copy Figures shown Surrounding Homer are poets, artists, and philosophers both ancient and modern‚Äîthe modern personages are mostly confined to the lower register of the composition, although Ingres deemed Raphael and Michelangelo worthy of elevation to stand alongside the ancients. The figures are:Radius 1968, p. 103. {align=center 570px  #Horace #Peisistratos #Lycurgus #Virgil #Raphael #Sappho #Alcibiades #Apelles #Euripides #Menander #Demosthenes #Sophocles #Aeschylus #Herodotus #Orpheus #Linus #Homer #Musaeus of Athens #Victory or the Universe #Pindar #Hesiod #Plato #Socrates #Pericles #Phidias #Michelangelo #Aristotle #Aristarchus of Samothrace #Alexander the Great #Dante #Iliad personification #Odyssey personification #Aesop #William Shakespeare #Jean de la Fontaine #Torquato Tasso #Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart #Nicolas Poussin #Pierre Corneille #Jean Racine #Moli√®re #Nicolas Boileau #Longinus #Fran√ßois F√©nelon #Christoph Willibald Gluck #Lu√≠s Vaz de Cam√µes } Later repetitions Ingres revisited the subject in several later works, including an undated watercolour (Lille, Mus√©e des Beaux-Arts) and paintings such as Homer and His Guide (1861; Brussels, Royal Collection) and The Odyssey (Lyon, Mus√©e des Beaux-Arts). In 1854 be began work on a drawing of the composition to be used as a model for the engraver Calamatta.Condon et al. 1983, p. 112. This drawing, in which Ingres announced his intention to \\"amplify and complete\\" his conception, was not completed until 1865, as the artist deliberated at length in choosing the appropriate historical personages to be included. He ultimately added dozens of new figures, including Ictinus, Giulio Romano, John Flaxman, Jacques-Louis David, Pliny the Elder, Plutarch, Cosimo de Medici, Louis XIV, and Pope Leo X. Ingres also refined his selection by excluding Shakespeare, Tasso, and Cam√µes from the 1865 drawing, as he had come to believe that they were too closely related to the Romantic tendency epitomized by his rival Delacroix.

McCarthy (January 25, 1944 ‚Äì December 11, 2019) was a Professor of Biological Oceanography at Harvard and was President of the American Association for the Advancement of Science from February 2008 to February 2009. McCarthy was the Alexander Agassiz Professor of Biological Oceanography in the Department of Organismic and Evolutionary Biology and former Master of Pforzheimer House. He was also Acting Curator of the Malacology Department in the Museum of Comparative Zoology. His studies addressed factors that regulate the processes of primary production and nutrient supply in upper ocean, approached using controlled laboratory studies and field investigations. Study sites ranged from near shore to the open ocean. Later field research sites included the North Atlantic, equatorial Pacific, and Arabian Sea. He was on the faculty of the Harvard Medical School Center for Health and the Global Environment. Biography McCarthy grew up in Sweet Home, Oregon and graduated from Sweet Home High School in 1962. McCarthy received his undergraduate degree in biology from Gonzaga University, and his Ph.D. from Scripps Institution of Oceanography in 1971. His research interests related to the regulation of plankton productivity in the sea, and in later years focused on regions that are strongly affected by seasonal and inter-annual variation in climate. From 1979 until 2002 McCarthy was the Director of Harvard University's Museum of Comparative Zoology.

Specializing in comfort and family footwear, Takken's Shoes is also one of the largest UGG Australia retailers in the world. The corporate headquarters are located in San Luis Obispo, CA where the first Takken's Shoes was opened in 1937 by Harry Takken as a shoe repair business. History Takken's shoes opened in 1937 as a shoe repair shop in San Luis Obispo, California. The business was successful as such (largely attributed to Harry's customer service and charisma\\"Family Affair\\" Footwear Plus Magazine, August 2008; Pg. 43-44,86.), and was purchased by Harry's son Robert in 1971. In 1975 Robert expanded the business to include a retail component, adding western and work boots.Robert Takken, Verbal Interview; February 2009 In the mid 1980s Robert jumped on the new 'Comfort Shoe' trend, and again expanded the business adding several popular comfort brands of the time. At one time, Takken's Shoes of San Luis Obispo was the largest independent Rockport dealer on the west coast. The retail offering expanded again in the 80's with the addition of UGG Australia and other sheepskin footwear. In 1987 a second store was opened in Paso Robles, CA. The Paso Robles store is the oldest free-standing location currently in the corporation and one of two still offering shoe repair services (the San Luis Obispo Takken's Location is the other). Both the San Luis Obispo and Paso Robles stores are still widely remembered for their western boot selection that began the retail side of the company. The Thousand Oaks location opened in 1989, marking a number of changes for Takken's Shoes. As well as being the first Takken's Shoes to open outside of San Luis Obispo County and the first mall location, the Thousand Oaks store was opened under the name \\"The Comfort Zone\\" marking what would eventually be a permanent shift towards comfort footwear. The 1990s saw continued growth with the addition of 9 new comfort oriented stores. Beginning with the Santa Maria location, expansion continued into malls in Newark, Hayward, Tracy, Beverly Hills, Richmond, Salinas, Citrus Heights, and Fairfield (in order of opening). Since the beginning of the 2000s, 17 new mall locations have opened in Ventura, Lakewood, Concord, Bakersfield, Roseville, Downey, Stockton, Fresno, San Jose, Visalia, San Bruno, Merced, Palmdale, Escondido, Pleasanton, and Valencia, and 1 new freestanding location in Roseville. The company has closed the Beverly Hills, Downey, Tracy, and Richmond locations, and remodeled 7 of its oldest locations in the recent years. The company intends to continue expansion, with plans for an additional free standing location in Santa Maria as well as an undisclosed number of new California mall locations before the decade is out. The expansion of the 1990s was accelerated by Robert's sons Cris and Marc Takken joining the company full-time. Cris Takken, now the Vice President of Operations, began in the shoe business at 13 years of age polishing shoes and working part-time in the original San Luis Obispo location. Cris went on to manage the company's Newark location, and later became the General Manager of Takken's Shoes.Cris Takken, Phone Interview; February 2009 As the Vice President of Operations, Cris has implemented a series of employee guide lines and training programs to insure the customer service legacy of the company's founder. He has spearheaded the expansion and remodel projects, and maintained steady sales increases (undisclosed) since taking on the position.

The waste heat from the cylinder and internal combustion exhaust was directed to the steam boiler, resulting in claimed fuel savings of up to 10%. History William StillThe inventor, William Joseph Still, patented his device in 1917 and on 26 May 1919 in London he and his collaborator Captain Francis Acland (1857‚Äì1943, a consulting engineer formerly of the Royal Artillery) announced it at a meeting, chaired by steam turbine inventor Charles Algernon Parsons, at the Royal Society of Arts. Acland described a continuous process by which a double-acting cylinder is powered on one side by internal combustion and on the other by steam from a boiler heated principally by the waste heat from the water jacket and exhaust gases. He explained how the reserve of energy represented by the steam pressure in the boiler provided for any occasional overload which would defeat a standard internal combustion engine of the same power. Independent heating of the boiler was occasionally used, to provide extra power for exceptional conditions, and in the first stage of operation to allow the engine to start itself from steam power alone, even against a load. Still was not the first in this field; a similar system, whereby compressed air (instead of gearing) was to transfer the power from an internal combustion engine and steam recovered from its cooling system was to augment the compressed air, had been patented in 1903 by Captain Paul Lucas-Girardville (a French military aviator) and Louis M√©karski. DevelopmentMarine= Still engine installation: \\"The explosion of the charge drives the piston down. Steam pressure on the other side then drives the piston up\\". In 1924 Scotts Shipbuilding and Engineering Company of Greenock, Scotland, put a diesel-fuelled marine version, the Scott- Still regenerative engine, into production, with the first pair of engines installed in the twin-screw M. V. Dolius, of the Blue Funnel Line. The trial was successful and in 1928 Blue Funnel commissioned a larger and faster ship, the Eurybates, with this propulsion system. However the requirement to carry marine engineering officers certified with both steam and motor qualifications, meaning extra crew members and wages, and the extra complexity with consequent higher maintenance costs, offset the fuel savings and conventional diesel engines were later installed in their place. =Railway= In 1926 Kitson and Company, locomotive builders of Leeds, England, produced a steam‚Äìdiesel hybrid locomotive, the Kitson Still locomotive. This was loaned for trials to the London and North Eastern Railway and used successfully to haul heavy coal trains, but the difference in the cost of coal used by a conventional locomotive, against the fuel oil used by the hybrid, was not great. When Kitson's failed in 1934, a failure to which the development costs of the hybrid locomotive had contributed, the receivers sold the machine for scrap. =Decline= Developments of larger diesel engines in the 1930s, with improved methods of power transmission, meant that the principal advantages of the Still engine ‚Äì the ability to provide for direct-drive starts from rest and additional power at times of temporary high load ‚Äì was lost, and further development ended.

With the rest of the money they remodel the house and buy good dresses. The gifts and letter are delivered by the relative who had sent her to work. It seemed like life was good when one day people of the village spot a story about a girl arrested in a mobile prostitution ring in Nargecoil. The girl has a resemblance to Karunya.

Homer was the subject of a number of formal hero cults in classical antiquity. The earliest notable portrayal of the scene is a 3rd-century BC marble relief by Archelaus of Priene, now in the British Museum. It was found in Italy, probably in 1658, but is thought to have been sculpted in Egypt. It shows Ptolemy IV and his wife and sister Arsinoe III standing beside a seated poet, flanked by figures from the Odyssey and Iliad, with the nine Muses standing above them and a procession of worshippers approaching an altar, believed to represent the Alexandrine Homereion. Apollo, the god of music and poetry, also appears, along with a female figure tentatively identified as Mnemosyne, the mother of the Muses. Zeus, the king of the gods, presides over the proceedings.

The trials have been condemned as unfair mass trials without timely access to lawyers and \\"seem designed to satisfy a desire for cruel revenge\\", as charged by Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International and the United Nations High Commission for Human Rights First day ZPU-4 of Bangladesh Army positioned over Satmasjid Road, near Dhanmondi 8A road, pointing towards Pilkhana on 25 February 2009 An array of tanks waiting beside Abahani ground on 26 February 2009 Barricade over the Satmasjid Road near State University on 25 February 2009, as seen from the western end of Dhanmondi Road 27 The mutiny started on the second day of the annual \\"BDR Week\\", which was earlier inaugurated by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. As the session began at the \\"Darbar Hall\\" auditorium, a number of jawans (privates) spoke against the higher-ranked army officials, while BDR Director General Maj. Gen. Shakil Ahmed was making a speech. They demanded the removal of army officials from the BDR command and equal rights for BDR soldiers. Soon they took the Director General and other senior officials as hostages inside the auditorium and later fired on them. They also prepared heavy weaponry at the main entrance gates of the headquarters. The Bangladesh Army moved in and took up strong positions surrounding BDR headquarters. The Director General of the BDR, Shakil Ahmed, was killed early during the first day of the revolt, along with dozens of other BDR senior commanders of the BDR, when rebels attacked the residences of the officers and killed Ahmed. They also raided Ahmed's house and looted valuables. Additionally, at least six civilians, including a boy, were killed in the crossfire. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina on 25 February offered a general amnesty for the rebels except for those involved in the murdering of army officers, looting and other crimes against the state. The mutineers had produced a 22-point demand, including the withdrawal of seconded regular army officers from the BDR. Instead, they wanted original BDR members to be promoted from the ranks. They demanded that their officials be selected on the basis of the Bangladesh Civil Service examination. While speaking to private television networks, BDR jawans alleged that senior officials of BDR were involved in a conspiracy, accusing the army officers of embezzling soldiers' wage bonuses from the Operation Dal-Bhaat Program and from extra duties in the general elections held on 29 December 2008. Operation Dal-Bhaat was a welfare program run by the BDR to provide rice and other daily essentials to the poor. Other demands included 100% rationing, introduction of BDR soldiers in peacekeeping missions and the overall welfare of BDR members. Second day Home Minister Sahara Khatun convinced some mutineers to give up their arms by assuring them that the army would not go into the BDR headquarters. As a result, the rebels began to surrender their arms and release the hostages. However, as this was happening in Dhaka, revolts by other members of the BDR started in at least 12 other towns and cities. Fighting and takeovers by the BDR was reported in Chittagong, at Feni, on the eastern border with India, in Rajshahi in the northwest and Sylhet in the north. Army convoy gathering behind the tanks near Abahani ground on 26 February 2009 By 26 February, BDR outposts at more than 46 locations were reported to have shown signs of great agitation. BDR jawans had claimed to have taken command of Jessor BDR garrison as well as major BDR establishments in Satkhira, Dinajpur, Naogaon and Netrokona. Army tanks and APCs were brought outside as the army took position, but they could not move as officers were kept as hostages. BDR headquarters had heavy weapons inside that were controlled by the rebels. The army was preparing for a final assault as tanks were rolling down the streets of Dhaka. Paratroops and commandos were ready, but the PM tried to solve the case without any casualties. As per media tickers, BDR members again started surrendering their arms after the PM addressed the nation and reassured BDR personnel that no action would be taken against them. However, she also warned the mutineers of \\"harsh actions\\" if they did not immediately lay down their arms and cease all hostilities. Following the speech of Sheikh Hasina, the army deployed tanks in front of BDR headquarters. After that, the mutineers surrendered their arms as described by the media spokesman of the Prime Minister. Following the surrender, Armed Police Battalion took over BDR headquarters. Third day Media workers, armed forces and members of the public waiting by the 4th Bangladesh Rifles main entrance gate on the afternoon of 27 February 2009. On 27 February about 200 mutineers were arrested while trying to escape from their headquarters at Pilkhana in civilian outfits. Army tanks and troops entered the headquarters of the BDR. Home minister Sahara Khatun had assured that the army had entered under the supervision of the Home Ministry. She also said that BDR personnel were kept at a safer place inside the headquarters and the army had entered to help with the rescue and search operations. Bangladesh army tanks rolled throughout Dhaka in a show of force, which persuaded the remaining mutineers to lay down their arms and surrender. It was still unclear whether the mutiny had been aborted in at least 12 BDR bases outside of Dhaka. As searches for missing personnel continued inside the headquarters, 42 more bodies were found and it was wrongly thought that more than 130 regular army officers had been killed by the rebels. As of 27 February, the official death toll had risen to 54. The body of BDR chief Maj. Gen. Shakil Ahmed was found among those of 41 other army officials. A mass grave was found inside, near the BDR hospital. A total of 42 officers were found buried inside a seven-foot-deep hole. Some bodies had been thrown into drain tunnels. Out of 58 bodies that were found, 52 were army officials. Beginning on 27 February, the government declared a three-day period of national mourning. Fourth day The body of the BDR chief's wife was recovered as three more mass graves were found. Many of the bodies had badly decomposed and were difficult to identify. Military Intelligence (MI) announced that the body count in the mutiny at BDR headquarters stood at 63, while 72 army officers still remained missing. Of the 63 bodies, 47 were identified. The army postponed the funerals of those who died until all the bodies were found. Thirty-one officers deputised to the paramilitary force survived the revolt. Newly appointed BDR Director Brig. Gen. Moinul Hossain said their immediate task would be to \\"regain the command structure\\" of the paramilitary force. Lt. Gen. M.A. Mubin, the army's second-in-command, said the killers would be punished. \\"The BDR troops who took part in these barbaric and grisly acts cannot be pardoned and will not be pardoned\\", he said in a televised address, AFP reported. Bangladesh Rifles (BDR) members who were absent from their workplaces without any leave or permission following the mutiny were asked to report to BDR headquarters or the nearest sector headquarters or battalion headquarters or police stations within 24 hours, but only about 100 responded. Casualties A total of seventy-four people were killed. Among them were 57 army officers seconded to the BDR. The Chief of the BDR, the Deputy Chief and all 16 Sector Commanders died during the revolt. Aftermath On 2 March 2009 a state funeral was held for 49 army officers, who were buried with full military honours; the wife of the Director General, who was also killed, was buried on the same day. The government established an investigative committee to determine the causes behind the rebellion, with Home Minister Sahara Khatun as the chair. The committee was later reformed and reinforced after opposition and pressure groups speculated that it might not function impartially, as the Home Minister herself is investigating an incident of her own ministry. The Bangladesh Army also formed an investigation committee that began proceedings on 3 March. The Army, with the help of RAB and police, has started the \\"Operation Rebel Hunt\\" to capture the BDR rebels. The government has also undertaken a decision to change the name and framework of Bangladesh Rifles and deployed the army across the country for an indeterminate period. The government asked for FBI and Scotland Yard to assist the investigation. =Prime Minister address to Army= On 1 March 2009, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina went to Senakunja army community centre to brief all army members about the situation. =Trials and sentencing= Trials began soon after the first arrests. Members of the 37th Rifles Battalion were tried on 13 November 2010. They were charged with looting firearms and ammunition from the armoury and firing their weapons, creating panic in the city, desecrating the portrait of BDR DG Maj. Gen. Shakil Ahmed and giving provocative statements before the media. BDR personnel of the 39th Rifles Battalion were accused of looting firearms, firing shots and siding with the Dhaka mutineers, who killed the top ranks of the force in February. As of January 2011, thousands were tried in Bangladesh for the mutiny. The mutineers were subjected to widespread abuse in custody, including torture, daily beatings, electrocution that resulted in about 50 custodial deaths and many more cases of permanent paralysis. Torture is routinely used by security forces in Bangladesh, even though it is a party to the United Nations Convention Against Torture. Human Rights Watch and others have long documented the systematic use of torture in Bangladesh by its security forces, including the army, the RAB and the Directorate General of Forces Intelligence, the country's main intelligence agency. Around 6000 soldiers were convicted by courts in mass trials and sentenced to terms of imprisonment ranging from four months to seven years including fines for participation in the mutiny.\\"46 BDR jawans of 29 Rifles Battalion jailed \\" unbconnect.com 823 soldiers who allegedly killed their senior officers were charged and tried in a civilian court for murder, torture, conspiracy and other offences. On 5 November 2013, Dhaka Metropolitan Sessions Court sentenced 152 people to death and 161 to life imprisonment; 256 received sentences of between three and ten years, while 277 were acquitted. Lawyers for the convicted have said that they would appeal the judgement. Bangladesh Nationalist Party member of Parliament Nasiruddin Ahmed Pintu was among those sentenced to life in Prison. A Human Rights Watch spokesperson described the mass trial as \\"an affront to international legal standards\\". UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay has drawn attention to flaws in the trial, calling it \\"rife with procedural irregularities, including the lack of adequate and timely access to lawyers\\". A spokesperson for Amnesty International condemned the sentences, stating that they \\"seem designed to satisfy a desire for cruel revenge\\". Some of those accused, more than 50 according to one estimate, are reported to have died while in custody. With the mutineers being given unfair mass trials that did nothing to determine guilt and being handed out mass death sentences, Human Rights Watch said in a report that \\"the mass trials of nearly 6,000 suspects raise serious fair trial concerns\\". \\"Those responsible for the horrific violence that left 74 dead should be brought to justice, but not with torture and unfair trials\\", said Brad Adams, Asia director at Human Rights Watch. \\"The government's initial response to the mutiny was proportionate and saved lives by refusing army demands to use overwhelming force in a heavily populated area. But since then it has essentially given a green light to the security forces to exact revenge through physical abuse and mass trials.\\" See also * List of revolutions and rebellions * Bangladesh Army * Bangladesh Rifles * Human Rights in Bangladesh ReferencesExternal links * Bangladesh's first line of defence BBC News * Mutiny, bloodshed at BDR HQ The Daily Star * BDR deserters given 24 hours to rejoin The Daily Star Category:Torture in Bangladesh Category:2009 crimes in Bangladesh Category:Conflicts in 2009 2009 Category:Mass murder in 2009 Category:Murder in Bangladesh Category:Mutinies Category:Hostage taking in Bangladesh Category:Military history of Bangladesh Category:History of Bangladesh (1971‚Äìpresent) Category:21st century in Dhaka Category:2009 in military history Category:Military coups in Bangladesh Category:2000s coups d'√©tat and coup attempts ","title":"Bangladesh Rifles revolt"},{"id":"21709287","text":"Mia L. Jones (born April 26, 1968) was a Democratic member of the Florida House of Representatives, representing the 14th District, which includes parts of downtown Jacksonville in northern Duval County, from 2008 to 2016. History Jones was born in Jacksonville, and attended Florida A&M; University, where she graduated with a degree in accounting in 1991 and then a Master of Business Administration in 1992. After graduation, she worked under Ed Austin, the Mayor of Jacksonville, in the Office of Equal Employment from 1992 to 1995. Jones also worked for Duval County Public Schools as the Supervisor of Affirmative Action and the Director of Minority Business Affairs. She served on the Jacksonville City Council from 2003 to 2008 where she served on the Public Health & Safety Committee, Land Use & Zoning Committee, Recreation & Community Development Committee, Personnel Committee, City Council's Task Force on Affordable & Low Income Housing, Zoning Code Rewrite Special Committee and Liaison to the Water & Sewer Expansion Authority. Florida House of Representatives In 2008, following the inability of State Representative Terry L. Fields to seek re-election due to term limits, Jones ran to succeed him in the Democratic primary in the 14th District, which included northern Duval County. She ran against fellow City Councilwoman Pat Lockett-Felder, whom she defeated with 54% of the vote. In the general election, Jones defeated the Republican nominee, Sarah Lovett, with 74% of the vote. She was re-elected without opposition in 2010. Following the reconfiguration of Florida House districts in 2012, Jones ran for re- election in the 14th District, which included most of the territory that she had previously represented. She won the nomination of her party uncontested, and in the general election, defeated Libertarian candidate Jonathan Loesche in a landslide, winning 79% of the vote. In 2014, Jones was re-elected without opposition to her fourth and final term in the House. While serving in the legislature, Jones ran against State Representative Darryl Rouson of St. Petersburg for the position of Democratic floor leader for the 2014-2016 term. In a closely contested vote, she narrowly lost to Rouson, receiving the votes of 21 of her colleagues to Rouson's 23. Just months later, Rouson was ousted as floor leader by a majority vote of the Democratic caucus. Jones was mentioned as a potential candidate to succeed him, but she ultimately declined to run. During the debate over expanding Medicaid as provided for under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, Jones proposed a plan that \\"would have implemented Medicaid expansion as offered under the Affordable Care Act,\\" which \\"gave Democrats a public stage to extol the virtues of Medicaid expansion, which would bring $51 billion in federal money over the next decade and cost the state $3.5 billion over that time,\\" though the plan ultimately failed. When the legislature passed legislation that aimed to speed up executions of prisoners on death row, Jones strongly opposed the legislation because many death row inmates have been exonerated, noting, \\"The one thing that you cannot take back is if you put a person to death, you can't bring them back to life. If you put a person to death and that person is innocent, that's one innocent life too many.\\" Additionally, when the House was debating legislation that would \\"require a doctor to sign an affidavit that a woman is not seeking an abortion based on sex or gender,\\" Jones declared that it was a \\"bald-faced lie\\" that the bill's advocates was supporting the legislation to oppose discrimination against minorities and women.

He is a prolific author of books on a variety of related topics, specializing in the American Civil War, the history of the Southwestern United States, and Texas history.Books by Jerry Thompson listed in WorldCat According to WorldCat, two of his books are available from more than six hundred major libraries worldwide --Confederate General of the West: Henry Hopkins Sibley, and Civil War in the Southwest: Recollections of the Sibley Brigade. Background Thompson was born to Jerry W. Thompson, Jr. (1920‚Äì2010), and Jo Thompson (1917‚Äì1982) in Springerville in Apache County in eastern Arizona, but he was reared in the unincorporated community of Quemado in Catron County in western New Mexico. He holds a Doctor of Arts degree in history from Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, a Master of Arts in history from the University of New Mexico at Albuquerque, and a Bachelor of Arts in History from Western New Mexico University in Silver City. Thompson has served in the past as Dean of the College of Arts and Humanities at Texas A&M; International and Chairperson of the Division of Behavioral and Social Sciences at the Laredo Community College, when that institution was still named Laredo Junior College. Career In 2001, Thompson was named Regents Professor of History by the Texas A&M; University System Board of Regents. He has received numerous awards in recognition of his scholarship, including the Minnie Stevens Piper Fellowship; T.R. Fehrenback Award, by the Texas Historical Commission; Kate Broocks Bates Award, by the Texas State Historical Association; Gaspar Perez de Villagra Award, by the Historical Society of New Mexico; and Barry Goldwater Award, by the Arizona Historical Society. In 2008, his book Cortina: Defending the Mexican Name in Texas won the Texas Institute of Letters award for \\"Best Scholarly Book.\\" Thompson won over sixteen other nominees. The book is a biography of controversial Mexican revolutionary, bandit, and folk hero Juan Cortina (1824‚Äì1894). Thompson told the Laredo Morning Times that he did not seek to portray Cortina as an heroic figure because \\"he was a very flawed individual, but I tried to be objective and tell the truth.\\" With records on Cortina scattered from Laredo to Mexico City to Yale University, Thompson spent twenty years on the project.Tricia Cortez, \\"20 years of toil earns award\\", Laredo Morning Times, May 4, 2008, pp. 1, 13A In 1861, Cortina, nominally loyal to the Union, confronted Confederate States of America Colonel Santos Benavides in a battle in Zapata. Because Cortina lacked the resources to fight, Benavides decisively defeated him. As Thompson studied both men, he concluded that Cortina \\"completely overshadowed Benavides\\", for whom a Laredo elementary school is named. In November 2008, Thompson elaborated further on his book before a group of United South High School students in Laredo: \\"Cortina defended people who were unable to defend themselves. There is so little written about him, but he is the only person in history to have a war named after him.\\"Taryn White, \\"Cortina, Unsung Hero\\", Laredo Morning Times, November 21, 2008, pp. 1, 15A While Cortina defeated the Texas Rangers, the U.S. Army thereafter subdued him.

He later served in the British Army during World War II, both as a paratrooper and as a war artist. He was the youngest of the three British official war artists killed during the conflict. Early life A Searchlight Battery. (Art. IWM ARTLD 3284) The Drop. (Art. IWM ARTLD 3924) France- the Beach Head, 1944; the road between St Aubin and Benouville,.. Richards was born in Liverpool, the son of Hannah Beatty and George Richards, a World War I veteran and wood machinist. After attending the Wallasey School of Art and Crafts, Albert Richards studied at the Royal College of Art for three months before being conscripted into the Army in 1940. He enlisted as a sapper in 286 Field Company, Royal Engineers and was promoted to the rank of Lance Corporal. He served as a sapper from April 1940 until the middle of 1943. During that period he was assigned to duties such as building barrack huts and defence works throughout England and he frequently painted scenes showing these tasks. He submitted several of these paintings to the War Artists' Advisory Committee, which, impressed with their freshness and quality, began in May 1941, to purchase his artwork. 1943‚Äì45 In 1943, Richards volunteered for parachute duties and he underwent training at the No.1 Parachute Training School at RAF Ringway, near Manchester, He depicted this training in several paintings such as Kilkenny's Circus and Parachute Training over Tatton Park. In September 1943 Richards was offered a three-month contract by WAAC but declined to accept due to his other commitments; in December 1943 he accepted his first six-month WAAC commission. In March 1944, he was granted an honorary commission with the rank of Captain. Later in the month Richards took part in a large scale parachute drop over Brize Norton in Oxfordshire, an event he recalled in the painting The Drop. This was in fact a practice exercise for D-Day. Richards took part in a second such event, Operation Mush, over five days in April across Gloucestershire. On D-Day, Richards landed in France by parachute with the 6th Airborne Division and took part in the attack on the Merville Battery and the capture of Le Plein village. Richards depicted the attack on the gun battery in several paintings composed within a few weeks of D-Day. After Le Plein had been secured, Richards continued with the advancing Allied forces through France and, after a brief period of leave in England, on into the Low Countries. In France he painted scenes such as the remains of the gliders used in the attack on Pegasus Bridge at Ranville, destroyed bridges and roadside camouflage screens. In January 1945, he recorded the funerals held for the victims of the massacre at Bande in Belgium. One of Richards last pictures, painted in February 1945, shows the bridge at Gennep built by Allied sappers across the flooded River Maas. It was in this area that Richards was killed on 5March 1945 when his jeep drove over a landmine. He is buried at Milsbeek War Cemetery, near Gennep. Legacy As well as the Tate and the Imperial War Museum, Richards' pictures are represented in the collections of the Walker Art Gallery, the National Maritime Museum, and the Williamson Art Gallery.

Simpson & Son, a major manufacturing business. History Alfred Simpson was born on 29 August 1805 at 139 Leadenhall Street, London, a son of John Simpson and his wife Anne, n√©e Salter, daughter of a Boston sea-captain. The second youngest of their twelve children, he was at 15 apprenticed to Amos Burkitt as a tinplate worker, and in his spare time learned all he could of science and engineering. At the end of his indentures he was admitted to the Worshipful Company of Tinplate Workers and in May 1829 became a Freeman of the City of London.Today Not Tomorrow: A Century of Progress pub. A. Simpson & Son Ltd. Adelaide 1954 There being little work for an ironworker at the time, he joined his brother Tom in the tailoring firm of Paine & Simpson as a traveller. Silk hats had just become fashionable, and Alfred was sent to Paris to learn as much as he could about their fabrication. He made some improvements, took out a patent, and soon their company was one of the six largest hat makers in London, employing some 200 men. The prosperity of Simpson's business was checked by a fire (the factory at Southwark was not insured) and it took seven years of hard work before he was sufficiently affluent to marry. This was the period of the great railway boom, and in the depression following its collapse the demand for silk hats evaporated. Alfred suffered rheumatism, which was exacerbated by England's cold winters, and he decided to emigrate to South Australia where, it was said, the sun always shone and an bright energetic man could make a fortune. Another attraction may have been South Australia's reputation for religious tolerance (Alfred was a Unitarian). He paid off all his creditors and left for Adelaide with his family aboard the John Woodhall, arriving in January 1849. Alfred had several unsuccessful business ventures and twice visited the goldfields while Sarah gave piano lessons. He must have been moderately successful, as he sent Sarah 20 oz of gold in March 1852. In 1853 he turned to tinsmithing, making pots and pans and supplying cans for the Glen Ewin jam factory. In 1862 he leased premises in on the south-west corner of Pirie Street and Gawler Place, Adelaide, which were later rebuilt. Simpson was an innovator and introduced labour-saving machinery and new products such as fire-proof safes, bedsteads, japanned ware, colonial ovens and gas stoves. He was one of the first members of the South Australian Chamber of Manufactures. Of a retiring disposition, he was esteemed for his commercial ability and consideration to employees. He died on 23 September 1891 and was buried in the West Terrace Cemetery.

In 1995 he became guest advisor to the Zapatista Army of National Liberation (EZLN) during the peace talks between the EZLN and the Mexican Government. Career Jan de Vos was born in Antwerp, Belgium, in 1936. He grew up bilingual in Dutch and French. He achieved his PhD in the humanities at the University of Leuven, Belgium. In 1973 he came to Chiapas, Mexico, as a missionary priest. Over time, and in relationships with the indigenous Maya of the Lacandon region, he adopted an outlook influenced by liberation theology. > \\"I came to Chiapas to bring the Mayan people the Word of God, but they > converted me instead\\" During his life in Chiapas he did research and wrote many books on the history of the Lacandon region and processes that led to the Chiapas conflict. In 1986, he received an academic prize (the Premio Chiapas) and in 1992 he received the national Juchim√°n de Plata prize. Having made a reputation by writing on the Lacandon Jungle, he was invited as a permanent guest advisor by the EZLN during the negotiations between the government and the EZLN in San Andr√©s Larr√°inzar in 1995. (see also the San Andr√©s Accords) As a distinguished person in the region he entered the Consejo Consultivo (Consultative Council) of the EU/Chiapas development project Prodesis around 2004. In her answer to a question in the European Parliament, Commissioner Ferrero-Waldner referred to Jan de Vos to underline the transparent and democratic character of the project: > \\"From an institutional point of view, major emphasis has been put on > inclusive participation and control by civil society within PRODESIS' > Consultative Council, whose \\"civil society college\\" currently includes 30 > members of regional and national civil society organisations. The renowned > Chiapas expert and EZLN‚Äôs external consultant during the negotiation of the > San Andres Agreement, Professor Jan de Vos, is also a member of that > Consultative Council.\\" During an interview in 2007, however, de Vos was very critical of Prodesis's way of operating, and sceptical about the possible results. In his opinion, the people in the Lacandon region have been betrayed too often (which is a strong sentiment in the region) and Prodesis is making the same mistakes as predecessor-projects like PIDDS and the Ca√±adas programme. In the last years of his life, de Vos worked at CIESAS (Centro de Investigaciones y Estudios Superiores en Antropolog√≠a Social) and resided mainly in Mexico City, but he often returned to San Cristobal de las Casas. Selected works Among several indispensable works on the history of Chiapas, he wrote Fray Pedro Lorenzo de la Nada and The Battle of The Sumidero. He became most known however for his trilogy on the Lacandon Jungle: * La Paz de Dios y del Rey: la Conquista de la Selva Lacandona, 1525‚Äì1821 (The Peace of God and the King: the Conquest of the Lacandon Jungle) * Oro verde: la Conquista de la Selva Lacandona por los Madereros Tabasque√±os, 1822‚Äì1949 (Green Gold: the Conquest of the Lacandon Jungle by the Tabasco's Timber Dealers) * Una Tierra Para Sembrar Sue√±os: Historia Reciente de la Selva Lacandona, 1950‚Äì2000 (A Land for Sowing Dreams: Recent History of the Lacandon Jungle) An excerpt from the introduction to The Peace of God and the King; The Conquest of the Lacandon Jungle, 1525‚Äì1821: > \\"For Western Civilization, violent and oppressive by nature, the Indigenous > cultures continue to be a nuisance which has to be eliminated.

Prior to the Act, the common law deemed that there were two categories of misrepresentation: fraudulent and innocent. The effect of the act is primarily to create a new category by dividing innocent misrepresentation into two separate categories: negligent and \\"wholly\\" innocent; and it goes on to state the remedies in respect of each of the three categories. The Misrepresentation ActSection 1= > Removal of certain bars to rescission for innocent misrepresentation.

Summary At common law, a misrepresentation is an untrue (or misleading)R v Kylsant statement of fact made by one party to another that induces the other to contract with him. The law of misrepresentation is a sui generis amalgam of the laws of contract, tort and unjust enrichment. Although short and apparently succinct, the 1967 Act is widely regarded as being confusing and poorly drafted. Royscot Trust Ltd v Rogerson [1991] 2 QB 297 It was mildly amended by the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977 and in 2012, but it escaped the attention of the consolidating Consumer Rights Act 2015.

He is the elder son and heir of Sir Thomas Bertram, a baronet and wealthy landowner in Northamptonshire, who also owns an estate in Antigua. Character As a seventeen year-old, Tom Bertram is not particularly kind to his cousin Fanny Price, the poor ward of his parents who has come to live with his family. Once grown up, he is depicted as a person who is only interested in amusing himself and is careless and extravagant with money. =Prodigal son= Austen's writing is influenced by many sources. Tom's character has much in common with the biblical Prodigal, though he is the elder rather than younger son, and the portion of inheritance he wastes is not his own but his brother's.Luke 15:11‚Äì32 Barbara Hayley says that Tom's vices spring from being the elder brother and heir, and 'that without effort or worth on his part, the family's house, estate and money are destined for him'. Sir Thomas has to sell the living of the local parish to pay off Tom's debts. This harms the prospects of his younger brother Edmund, who intends to become a clergyman and would be expecting an income from the tithes of the parish. Edmund never expresses any resentment. Tom expresses 'repentance' on two occasions. Sir Thomas rightly suspects the first repentance to be superficial and removes Tom from the influence of his friends by taking him on a business trip to Antigua for a year. Tom's removal is also beneficial to the estate since the more reliable Edmund attends to its management. The second repentance comes near the end of the novel when Tom has a 'fall', both literal and spiritual, at the Newmarket Easter races and, being close to death, sends word to bring him home. Edmund is the one to bring him back. On both occasions of repentance, Sir Thomas is a welcoming father, an attitude not extended to the adulterous Maria, though Maria never wants to return home. =Social skills= Tom is good at entertaining, but only after his second repentance does he begin to develop a sense of responsibility. Paula Byrne describes Tom as one of the most intriguing characters in Austen‚Äôs fictional world. He loves theatre and dressing up and is very close to the dandyish Yates. He is not very good at understanding women and the social customs of courtship, and there is no indication that he ever marries. She suggests that If there is a homosexual character in any of Austen‚Äôs novels, then it is Tom Bertram.Byrne, Paula (2013)The Real Jane Austen: A Life in Small Things ch. 8, HarperCollins, Kindle Ed. loc. 2503 - 2794 Travel and return Tom and his father go to Antigua to deal with problems on his estate. After a year, Tom is sent back home and returns to his former friends and his travels around the country. Two wealthy young people, Henry and Mary Crawford move into the area and are living in the parsonage with their half sister, Mrs Grant wife of the new clergyman. Mary is tentatively romantically interested in Tom but he does not respond to her; she shifts her attentions to his younger brother, Edmund. Tom leaves home again to spend time with his friends at Weymouth. Weymouth had become one of the first modern tourist destinations and had been made popular by the royal family and their hangers-on. It had a reputation as a raffish seaside resort and is the offstage backdrop for Tom Bertram‚Äôs disastrous meeting with John Yates, who later elopes with Tom‚Äôs sister, Julia.Byrne (2013) ch. 18 Kindle loc. 5900 = Theatre = When Tom returns to Mansfield Park, he is soon joined by Mr Yates. They want to put on an amateur production of a play that is somewhat risque. Edmund and Fanny are opposed but the rest of the group are excited. Tom arranges for a theatre to be built in the billiard room. Austen carefully distinguishes between the fashionable elite theatricals of the aristocracy, which were mercilessly lampooned by the press, and the more modest efforts of the gentry. Georgian debates about whether amateur acting was a virtuous activity or its opposite were lively, and Austen uses this to create the drama. An enthusiastic theatre-goer, she displays accurate knowledge of how acting companies really worked. Tom Bertram is both actor and company manager, as was the case on the professional stage.Worsley, Lucy Jane Austen at Home: A Biography . ch. 27 Hodder & Stoughton. Kindle Ed. loc. 5551 The play is almost ready for production when Sir Thomas returns unexpectedly early and puts a stop to the proceedings. Barbara Hayley points out that while Tom shows considerable force of character in instigating and carrying through his plans and overcoming Edmund's objections, he never shows any sign of helping his father with either estate or business. Josephine Ross says that Austen's experience of hearing her brothers declaim poetry must be reflected in Tom Bertram‚Äôs reminiscence, ‚ÄòI am sure my name was Norval, every evening of my life, through one Christmas holidays‚Äô, a reference to his childhood recitations from the popular eighteenth-century play Douglas, by John Home.Ross, Josephine.

Kindle loc. 1803. = Easter 'fall' = Later in the novel, Tom leaves again to take part in a horse racing meet at Newmarket but has a fall and is injured which, combined with his drinking, causes him to become very ill. His friends abandon him and Edmund has to fetch him home to be nursed back to health. His illness causes his family to fear for his life. This is observed with interest by Mary Crawford, who wants to marry Edmund. If Tom should die, that would leave Edmund as the heir to the Bertram estates and title. During his illness,Tom learns to suffer and to think and develops into a more prudent man. Barbara Hayley points out that we never see this improvement at first hand and 'it is not at all like the Tom we know'.

A group of French Christian pilgrims in 1483 recorded that there was a great well at an-Nekhel which was called the \\"Well of the Sultan\\" because during the pilgrimage season the Sultan employed a man with two camels to draw water all day for the pilgrims.

Mohammed Ali era Johann Ludwig Burckhardt, who visited the site in the first decade of the 19th century, reported a large building with stone walls and no habitations around it.

In the nineteenth century, when the route was still used by pilgrims, the road was infested with hyenas, dabba, which fed on the dead camels which had fallen by the wayside.

All food was transported from Gaza or Suez though the villagers cultivating small patches of ground with corn and maize when Wadi el-Arish flooded. This did not occur every year and the Wadi dried up very quickly. Some of the villagers also kept camels.

World War I Around 1900 the pilgrimage switched its route to one along the shores of the Gulf of Suez and an-Nekhel went into decline. In 1915 the Lebanese Druze leader Shakib Arslan arrived at the fortress with 120 Druze volunteers hoping to join the Turkish offensive against the Suez Canal. With the total failure of the attack the Druze force returned to their homes.Cleveland, William L. (1985) Islam against the West: Shakib Arslan and the campaign for Islamic nationalism. Al Saqi.

Viking Press. . p.16 Two British cavalry columns with three aeroplanes, commanded by Colonel William Grant, approached an-Nekhel on 17 February 1917 to find that it had been abandoned. This was the last British action in their Sinai campaign against the Turks. T.E. Lawrence writes, in chapter 59 (Seven Pillars of Wisdom), of passing nearby the fort ruins on his way from the capture of Aqaba in July 1917 to report to the Egyptian British command. A visitor, around 1930, found three policemen, a corporal and one villager, and recommended the big reservoir as worth a visit. Travelling by car the road to an-Nekhel was slow due to water gullies, several inches deep, every two or three hundred yards, reducing the vehicle's speed to 25 miles per hour.Jarvis, Major C.S.

Colonel Ariel Sharon, commanding the 202 Paratroop Brigade, had orders to break through to the troops holding positions at the Mitla Pass. Starting from Nitzana the only seriously defensive position the Brigade faced was at Thamad which was garrisoned by a company of Sudanese members of the Egyptian Frontier Force. Here the Israelis suffered their first casualties, 4 killed and six wounded, while the Egyptians lost fifty killed. The Frontier Force company retreated to an-Nekhel, which had another Frontier Force company but no defensive positions or large guns. The attackers had at least two infantry companies, two troops of artillery and two tanks. The fortress fell following air-strikes and an artillery bombardment. The Egyptians retreated towards Suez and Al-Arish leaving 56 dead.Herzog, Chaim (1982) The Arab- Israeli Wars. . p.119Dayan, Major-General Moshe (1966) Diary of the Sinai Campaign 1956.

Following General Robert E. Lee's failure to defeat the Union Army at the Battle of Gettysburg (July 1-3, 1863), he ordered a retreat through Maryland and over the Potomac River to relative safety in Virginia. The Union Army of the Potomac, commanded by Maj. Gen. George G. Meade, was unable to maneuver quickly enough to launch a significant attack on the Confederates, who crossed the river on the night of July 13-14\\\\. Confederate supplies and thousands of wounded men proceeded over South Mountain through Cashtown in a wagon train that extended for 15-20 miles, enduring harsh weather, treacherous roads, and enemy cavalry raids. The bulk of Lee's infantry departed through Fairfield and through the Monterey Pass toward Hagerstown, Maryland. Reaching the Potomac, they found that rising waters and destroyed pontoon bridges prevented their immediate crossing. Erecting substantial defensive works, they awaited the arrival of the Union army, which had been pursuing over longer roads more to the south of Lee's route. Before Meade could perform adequate reconnaissance and attack the Confederate fortifications, Lee's army escaped across fords and a hastily rebuilt bridge. Combat operations, primarily cavalry battles, raids, and skirmishes, occurred during the retreat at Fairfield (July 3), Monterey Pass (July 4-5), Smithsburg (July 5), Hagerstown (July 6 and 12), Boonsboro (July 8), Funkstown (July 7 and 10), and around Williamsport and Falling Waters (July 6-14). Additional clashes after the armies crossed the Potomac occurred at Shepherdstown (July 16) and Manassas Gap (July 23) in Virginia, ending the Gettysburg Campaign of June and July 1863. BackgroundMilitary situation= The culmination of the three-day Battle of Gettysburg was the massive infantry assault known as Pickett's Charge, in which the Confederate attack against the center of the Union line on Cemetery Ridge was repulsed with significant losses. The Confederates returned to their positions on Seminary Ridge and prepared to receive a counterattack. When the Union attack had not occurred by the evening of July 4, Lee realized that he could accomplish nothing more in his Gettysburg Campaign and that he had to return his battered army to Virginia. His ability to supply his army by living off the Pennsylvania countryside was now significantly reduced and the Union could easily bring up additional reinforcements as time passed, whereas he could not. Brig. Gen. William N. Pendleton, Lee's artillery chief, reported to him that all of his long-range artillery ammunition had been expended and there were no early prospects for resupply. However, despite casualties of over 20,000 officers and men, including a number of senior officers, the morale of Lee's army remained high and their respect for the commanding general was not diminished by their reverses.Coddington, pp. 535-36; Wittenberg et al., p. 39; Brown, pp. 9-11. Lee began his preparations for retreat on the night of July 3, following a council of war with some of his subordinate commanders. He consolidated his lines by pulling Lt. Gen. Richard S. Ewell's Second Corps from the Culp's Hill area back through the town of Gettysburg and onto Oak Ridge and Seminary Ridge. His men constructed breastworks and rifle pits that extended 2.5 miles from the Mummasburg Road to the Emmitsburg Road. He decided to send his long train of wagons carrying equipment and supplies, which had been captured in great quantities throughout the campaign, to the rear as quickly as possible, in advance of the infantry. The wagon train included ambulances with his 8,000 wounded menSears, p. 471; Gottfried, p. 278: Imboden claimed that there were 12,000 wounded men in his wagon train. who were fit to travel, as well as some of the key general officers who were severely wounded, but too important to be abandoned. The great bulk of the Confederate wounded-- over 6,800 men--remained behind to be treated in Union field hospitals and by a few of Lee's surgeons selected to stay with them.Wittenberg et al., pp. 28, 29, 36; Coddington, pp. 536-37. There were two routes the army could take over South Mountain to the Cumberland Valley (the name given to the Shenandoah Valley in Maryland and Pennsylvania), from where it would march south to cross the Potomac at Williamsport, Maryland: the Chambersburg Pike, which passed through Cashtown in the direction of Chambersburg, and; the shorter route through Fairfield and over Monterey Pass to Hagerstown. Fortunately for the Confederate army, it now had its full complement of cavalry available for reconnaissance and screening activities, a capability it lacked earlier in the campaign while its commander, Maj. Gen. J.E.B. Stuart, was separated from the army with his three best cavalry brigades on \\"Stuart's ride\\".Coddington, pp. 537-38; Gottfried, p. 278; Wittenberg et al., p. 5. Unfortunately for the Confederate Army, however, once they reached the Potomac they would find it difficult to cross. Torrential rains that started on July 4 flooded the river at Williamsport, making fording impossible. Four miles downstream at Falling Waters, Union cavalry dispatched from Harpers Ferry by Maj. Gen. William H. French destroyed Lee's lightly guarded pontoon bridge on July 4. The only way to cross the river was a small ferry at Williamsport. The Confederates could potentially be trapped, forced to defend themselves against Meade with their backs to the river.Wittenberg et al., pp. 160-61; Sears, p. 481. Opposing forces The Union Army of the Potomac and the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia retained their general organizations with which they fought at the Battle of Gettysburg. By July 10, some of the Union battle losses had been replaced and Meade's Army stood at about 80,000 men. The Confederates received no reinforcements during the campaign and had only about 50,000 men available.Coddington, p. 569. =Union= The Army of the Potomac had significant changes in general officer assignments because of its battle losses. Meade's chief of staff, Maj. Gen. Daniel Butterfield, was wounded on July 3 and was replaced on July 8 by Maj. Gen. Andrew A. Humphreys; Brig. Gen. Henry Price replaced Humphreys in command of his old division of the III Corps. Maj. Gen. John F. Reynolds, killed on July 1, was replaced by Maj. Gen. John Newton of the VI Corps. Maj. Gen. Winfield Scott Hancock of the II Corps, wounded on July 3, was replaced by Brig. Gen. William Hays. Maj. Gen. William H. French, who had temporarily commanded the garrison at Harpers Ferry for most of the campaign, replaced the wounded Daniel Sickles in command of the III Corps on July 7. In addition to the battle losses, Meade's army was plagued by a condition that persisted during the war, the departure of men and regiments whose enlistments had expired, which took effect even in the midst of an active campaign. On the plus side, however, Meade had available temporary, although inexperienced, reinforcements of about 10,000 men who had been with General French at Maryland Heights, which were incorporated into the I Corps and III Corps. The net effect of expiring enlistments and reinforcements added about 6,000 men to the Army of the Potomac. Including the forces around Harpers Ferry, Maryland Heights, and the South Mountain passes, by July 14 between 11,000 and 12,000 men had been added the army, although Meade had extreme doubts about the combat effectiveness of these troops. In addition to the Army of the Potomac, Maj. Gen. Darius N. Couch of the Department of the Susquehanna had 7,600 men at Waynesboro, 11,000 at Chambersburg, and 6,700 at Mercersburg. These were \\"emergency troops\\" that were hastily raised during Lee's march into Pennsylvania and were subject to Meade's orders.Coddington, 557-63. In addition, a force of about 6,000 from the newly created Department of West Virginia under Brig. Gen. Benjamin Franklin Kelley sat astride the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad at Grafton, and New Creek, to prevent Confederate forces from retreating west, as well as later assisting in the pursuit of Lee toward Virginia.Brown, pp. 21, 299. =Confederate= Lee's Army of Northern Virginia retained its corps organization and commanders, although a number of key subordinate generals were killed or mortally wounded (Lewis Armistead, Richard B. Garnett, Isaac E. Avery, and William Barksdale), captured (James L. Kemper and James J. Archer), or severely wounded (John Bell Hood, Wade Hampton, George T. Anderson, Dorsey Pender, and Alfred M. Scales).Sears, pp. 532-43. Imboden's wagon train thumb400pxGettysburg Campaign (July 5-14) At 1 a.m. on July 4, Lee summoned to his headquarters Brig. Gen. John D. Imboden, one of Stuart's cavalry brigade commanders, to manage the passage of the majority of the trains to the rear. Imboden's command of 2,100 cavalrymen had not played much of a role in the campaign up until this time, and had not been selected by Stuart for his ride around the Union Army. Lee and Stuart had a poor opinion of Imboden's brigade, considering it \\"indifferently disciplined and inefficiently directed,\\" but it was effective for assignments such as guard duty or fighting militia. Lee reinforced Imboden's single artillery battery with five additional batteries borrowed from his infantry corps and directed Stuart to assign the brigades of Brig. Gen. Fitzhugh Lee and Wade Hampton (now commanded by Col. Laurence S. Baker) to protect the flanks and rear of Imboden's column. Imboden's orders were to depart Cashtown on the evening of July 4, turn south at Greenwood, avoiding Chambersburg, take the direct road to Williamsport to ford across the Potomac, and escort the train as far as Martinsburg. Then, Imboden's command would return to Hagerstown to guard the retreat route for the remainder of the army.Longacre, pp. 245-46; Wittenberg et al., pp. 2, 5; Coddington, p. 538; Gottfried, p. 279. Imboden's train consisted of hundreds of Conestoga-style wagons, which extended 15‚Äì20 miles along the narrow roads. Assembling these wagons into a marching column, arranging their escorts, loading supplies, and accounting for the wounded took until late afternoon on July 5. Imboden himself left Cashtown around 8 p.m. to join the head of his column. The journey was one of extreme misery, conducted during the torrential rains that began on July 4, in which the wounded men were forced to endure the weather and the rough roads in wagons without suspensions. Imboden's orders required that he not stop until he reached his destination, which meant that wagons breaking down were left behind. Some critically wounded men were left behind on the roadsides as well, hoping that local civilians would find and take care of them. The train was harassed throughout its march. At dawn on July 5, civilians in Greencastle ambushed the train with axes, attacking the wheels of the wagons, until they were driven off. That afternoon at Cunningham's Cross Roads (current day Cearfoss, Maryland), Capt. Abram Jones led 200 troopers of the 1st New York Cavalry and 12th Pennsylvania Cavalry in attacking the column, capturing 134 wagons, 600 horses and mules, and 645 prisoners, about half of whom were wounded. These losses so angered Stuart that he demanded a court of inquiry to investigate.Wittenberg et al., pp. 5-26; Sears, p. 481. Fairfield and Monterey Pass Fight at Monterey Pass After dark on July 4, Hill's Third Corps headed out onto the Fairfield Road, followed by Lt. Gen. James Longstreet's First Corps and Richard S. Ewell's Second Corps. Lee accompanied Hill at the head of the column. He ordered Stuart to post Col. John R. Chambliss's and Brig. Gen. Albert G. Jenkins's brigades (the latter commanded by Col. Milton Ferguson) to cover his left rear from Emmitsburg. Departing in the dark, Lee had the advantage of getting several hours head start and the route from the west side of the battlefield to Williamsport was about half as long as the ones available to the Army of the Potomac.Coddington, p. 539; Gottfried, p. 280; Wittenberg et al., p. 39. Meade was reluctant to begin an immediate pursuit because he was unsure whether Lee intended to attack again and his orders continued that he was required to protect the cities of Baltimore and Washington, D.C. Since Meade believed that the Confederates had well fortified the South Mountain passes, he decided he would pursue Lee on the east side of the mountains, conduct forced marches to quickly seize the passes west of Frederick, Maryland, and threaten Lee's left flank as he retreated up the Cumberland Valley. However, Meade's assumption was wrong--Fairfield was lightly held by only two small cavalry brigades and the passes over South Mountain were not fortified. If Meade had secured Fairfield, Lee's army would have been forced to either fight its way through Fairfield while its rear was exposed to the Army of the Potomac at Gettysburg or to take his entire army through the Cashtown Pass, a much more difficult route to Hagerstown.Coddington, pp. 539-40. On July 3, while Pickett's Charge was underway, the Union cavalry had had a unique opportunity to impede Lee's eventual retreat. Brig. Gen. Wesley Merritt's brigade departed from Emmitsburg with orders from cavalry commander Maj. Gen. Alfred Pleasonton to strike the Confederate right and rear along Seminary Ridge. Reacting to a report from a local civilian that there was a Confederate forage train near Fairfield, Merritt dispatched about 400 men in four squadrons from the 6th U.S. Cavalry under Major Samuel H. Starr to seize the wagons. Before they were able to reach the wagons, the 7th Virginia Cavalry, leading a column under Confederate Brig. Gen. William E. \\"Grumble\\" Jones, intercepted the regulars, starting the minor Battle of Fairfield. Taking cover behind a post-and rail fence, the U.S. cavalrymen opened fire and caused the Virginians to retreat. Jones sent in the 6th Virginia Cavalry, which successfully charged and swarmed over the Union troopers, wounding and capturing Starr. There were 242 Union casualties, primarily prisoners, and 44 casualties among the Confederates. Despite the relatively small scale of this action, its result was that the strategically important Fairfield Road to the South Mountain passes remained open.Longacre, pp. 235-37. Early on July 4 Meade sent his cavalry to strike the enemy's rear and lines of communication so as to \\"harass and annoy him as much as possible in his retreat.\\" Eight of nine cavalry brigades (except Col. John B. McIntosh's of Brig. Gen. David McM. Gregg's division) took to the field. Col. J. Irvin Gregg's brigade (of his cousin David Gregg's division) moved toward Cashtown via Hunterstown and the Mummasburg Road, but all of the others moved south of Gettysburg. Brig. Gen. John Buford's division went directly from Westminster to Frederick, where they were joined by Merritt's division on the night of July 5.Wittenberg et al., pp. 152-55; Gottfried, p. 278; Coddington, p. 543. Late on July 4, Meade held a council of war in which his corps commanders agreed that the army should remain at Gettysburg until Lee acted, and that the cavalry should pursue Lee in any retreat. Meade decided to have Brig. Gen. Gouverneur K. Warren take a division from Maj. Gen. John Sedgwick's VI Corps--the most lightly engaged of all the Union corps at Gettysburg--to probe the Confederate line and determine Lee's intentions. Meade ordered Butterfield to prepare for a general movement of the army, which he organized into three wings, commanded by Sedgwick (I, III, and VI Corps), Maj. Gen. Henry W. Slocum (II and XII), and Maj. Gen. Oliver O. Howard (V and XI). By the morning of July 5, Meade learned of Lee's departure, but he hesitated to order a general pursuit until he had received the results of Warren's reconnaissance.Coddington, pp. 544-48; Wittenberg et al., pp. 46-47, 79-80; Gottfried, p. 280. The Battle of Monterey Pass began as Brig. Gen. Judson Kilpatrick's cavalry division arrived near Fairfield on July 4 just before dark. They easily brushed aside Brig. Gen. Beverly Robertson's pickets and encountered a detachment of 20 men from the Confederate 1st Maryland Cavalry Battalion, under Capt. G. M. Emack, that was guarding the road to Monterey Pass. Aided by a detachment of the 4th North Carolina Cavalry and a single cannon, the Marylanders delayed the advance of 4,500 Union cavalrymen until well after midnight. Kilpatrick was not able to see anything in the dark and considered his command to be in \\"a perilous situation.\\" He ordered Brig. Gen. George A. Custer to charge the Confederates with the 6th Michigan Cavalry, which broke the deadlock and allowed Kilpatrick's men to reach and attack the wagon train. They captured or destroyed numerous wagons and captured 1,360 prisoners--primarily wounded men in ambulances--and a large number of horses and mules.Huntington, pp. 131-33; Wittenberg et al., 49-74; Sears, pp. 480-81; Brown, pp. 128-36, 184; Coddington, p. 548; Gottfried, pp. 278-81; Longacre, pp. 249-50\\\\. A historical marker on East Cemetery Hill at Gettysburg Battlefield uses the term \\"Fight\\" for the \\"Monterey Gap\\" action, Longacre uses \\"skirmish\\". All of the other references use the name \\"Monterey Pass\\". The number of wagons captured is disputed. Brown reports that local residents cited \\"400 or 500\\". Longacre cites sources for 40 (Stuart) and 150 (Union Col. Pennock Huey). Huntington cites 300. Following the fight at Monterey, Kilpatrick's division reached Smithsburg around 2 p.m. on July 5. Stuart arrived from over South Mountain with the brigades of Chambliss and Ferguson. A horse artillery duel ensued, causing some damage to the small town. Kilpatrick withdrew at dark \\"to save my prisoners, animals, and wagons\\" and arrived at Boonsboro (spelled Boonsborough at that time) before midnight.Wittenberg et al., pp. 81-86. Sedgwick's reconnaissance The reconnaissance from Sedgwick's corps began before dawn on the morning of July 5, but instead of a division they took the entire corps. It struck the rear guard of Ewell's corps late in the afternoon at Granite Hill near Fairfield, but the result was little more than a skirmish, and the Confederates camped a mile and a half west of Fairfield, holding their position with only their picket line. Warren informed Meade that he and Sedgwick believed Lee was concentrating the main body of his army around Fairfield and preparing for battle. Meade immediately halted his army and early on the morning of July 6, he ordered Sedgwick to resume his reconnaissance to determine Lee's intentions and the status of the mountain passes. Sedgwick argued with him about the risky nature of sending his entire corps into the rugged country and dense fog ahead of him and by noon Meade abandoned his plan, resuming his original intention of advancing east of the mountains to Middletown, Maryland. The delays leaving Gettysburg and the conflicting orders to Sedgwick about whether to conduct merely a reconnaissance or a vigorous advance to engage Lee's army in combat would later cause Meade political difficulties as his opponents charged him with indecision and timidity.Wittenberg et al., pp. 81-86; Gottfried, p. 280; Coddington, pp. 549-51. Given the conflicting signals from Meade, Sedgwick and Warren followed the more conservative course. They waited to start until Ewell's Corps had cleared out of Fairfield and remained at a safe distance behind it as it moved west. Lee assumed that Sedgwick would attack his rear and was ready for it. He told Ewell, \\"If these people keep coming on, turn back and thresh them.\\" Ewell replied, \\"By the blessing of Providence I will do it\\" and ordered Maj. Gen. Robert E. Rodes's division to form a battle line. The VI Corps followed Lee only to the top of Monterey Pass, however, and did not pursue down the other side.Wittenberg et al., pp. 86-89; Coddington, pp. 551-52. Pursuit to Williamsport Before Meade's infantry began to march in earnest in pursuit of Lee, Buford's cavalry division departed from Frederick to destroy Imboden's train before it could cross the Potomac. Hagerstown was a key point on the Confederate retreat route, and seizing it might block or delay their access to the fords across the river. On July 6, Kilpatrick's division, after its success raiding at Monterey Pass, moved toward Hagerstown and pushed out the two small brigades of Chambliss and Robertson. However, infantry commanded by Brig. Gen. Alfred Iverson drove Kilpatrick's men back through the streets of town. Stuart's remaining brigades came up and were reinforced by two brigades of Hood's Division and Hagerstown was recaptured by the Confederates.Wittenberg et al., pp. 107-22; Coddington, pp. 552-53; Sears, pp. 482-83; Gottfried, pp. 282-85. Buford heard Kilpatrick's artillery in the vicinity and requested support on his right. Kilpatrick chose to respond to Buford's request for assistance and join the attack on Imboden at Williamsport. Stuart's men pressured Kilpatrick's rear and right flank from their position at Hagerstown and Kilpatrick's men gave way and exposed Buford's rear to the attack. Buford gave up his effort when darkness fell. At 5 p.m. on July 7 Buford's men reached within a half-mile of the parked trains, but Imboden's command repulsed their advance.Coddington, pp. 552-53; Sears, pp. 482-83; Gottfried, pp. 282-85. Invasion of Maryland - General Meade's army crossing the Antietam in pursuit of Lee, July 12, engraving for Frank Leslie's illustrated newspaper by Edwin Forbes The Battle of Boonsboro occurred along the National Road on July 8. Stuart advanced from the direction of Funkstown and Williamsport with five brigades. He first encountered Union resistance at Beaver Creek Bridge, 4.5 miles north of Boonsboro. By 11 a.m., the Confederate cavalry had pushed forward to several mud-soaked fields, where fighting on horseback was nearly impossible, forcing Stuart's troopers and Kilpatrick's and Buford's divisions to fight dismounted. By mid-afternoon, the Union left under Kilpatrick crumbled as the Federals ran low on ammunition under increasing Confederate pressure. Stuart's advance ended about 7 p.m., however, when Union infantry arrived, and Stuart withdrew north to Funkstown.Wittenberg et al., pp. 173-97; Brown, pp. 290-93. Stuart's strong presence at Funkstown threatened any Union advance toward Williamsport, posing a serious risk to the Federal right and rear if the Union army moved west from Boonsboro. As Buford's division cautiously approached Funkstown via the National Road on July 10, it encountered Stuart's crescent-shaped, three-mile-long battle line, initiating the [Second] Battle of Funkstown (the first being a minor skirmish on July 7 between Buford's 6th U.S. Cavalry and the 7th Virginia Cavalry of Grumble Jones's brigade). Col. Thomas C. Devin's dismounted Union cavalry brigade attacked about 8 a.m. By mid-afternoon, with Buford's cavalrymen running low on ammunition and gaining little ground, Col. Lewis A. Grant's First Vermont Brigade of infantry arrived and clashed with Brig. Gen. George T. Anderson's Confederate brigade (commanded after Anderson's wounding at Gettysburg by Col. William W. White), the first time opposing infantry had fought since the Battle of Gettysburg. By early evening, Buford's command began withdrawing south towards Beaver Creek, where the Union I, VI, and XI Corps had concentrated.Wittenberg et al., pp. 167-68, 207-34; Brown, pp. 302-307. Buford and Kilpatrick continued to hold their advance position around Boonsboro, awaiting the arrival of the Army of the Potomac. French's command sent troops to destroy the railroad bridge at Harpers Ferry and a brigade to occupied Maryland Heights, which prevented the Confederates from outflanking the lower end of South Mountain and threatening Frederick from the southwest.Coddington, p. 554. Face-off at the Potomac Earthworks in Lee's Potomac line (Last stand of the Army of Virginia, commanded by General Lee), painting by Edwin Forbes Meade's infantry had been marching hard since the morning of July 7. Slocum's wing marched 29 miles on the first day from Littlestown, Pennsylvania, to Walkersville, Maryland. Parts of the XI Corps covered distances estimated between 30 and 34 miles from Emmitsburg to Middletown. By July 9 most of the Army of the Potomac was concentrated in a 5-mile line from Rohrersville to Boonsboro. Other Union forces were in position to protect the outer flanks at Maryland Heights and at Waynesboro. Reaching these positions was difficult because of the torrential rains on July 7 that turned the roads to quagmires of mud. Long detours were required for the III and V Corps, although the disadvantage of the additional distance was offset by the roads' proximity to Frederick, which was connected by the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad to Union supply centers, and by the superior condition of those roads, including the macadamized National Road.Coddington, pp. 555, 556, 564; Wittenberg et al., p. 335. The Confederate Army's rear guard arrived in Hagerstown on the morning of July 7, screened skillfully by their cavalry, and began to establish defensive positions. By July 11 they occupied a 6-mile line on high ground with their right resting on the Potomac River near Downsville and the left about 1.5 miles southwest of Hagerstown, covering the only road from there to Williamsport. The Conococheague Creek protected the position from any attack that might be launched from the west. They erected impressive earthworks with a parapet on top and frequent gun emplacements, creating comprehensive crossfire zones. Longstreet's Corps occupied the right end of the line, Hill's the center, and Ewell's the left. These works were completed on the morning of July 12, just as the Union army arrived to confront them.Coddington, pp. 565-66; Gottfried, p. 286. Meade telegraphed to general- in-chief Henry W. Halleck on July 12 that he intended to attack the next day, \\"unless something intervenes to prevent it.\\" He once again called a council of war with his subordinates on the night of July 12. Of the seven senior officers, only Brig. Gen. James S. Wadsworth and Maj. Gen. Oliver O. Howard were in favor of attacking the Confederate fortifications. Objections centered on the lack of reconnaissance that had been performed. On July 13, Meade and Humphreys scouted the positions personally and issued orders to the corps commanders for a reconnaissance in force on the morning of July 14. This one- day postponement was another instance of delay for which Meade's political enemies castigated him after the campaign. Halleck told Meade that it was \\"proverbial that councils of war never fight.\\"Coddington, p. 567; Sears, pp. 488-89; Gottfried, p. 288; Wittenberg et al., pp. 249, 258-62. Across the Potomac Escape of the Army of Virginia, commanded by General Lee, over the Potomac River near Williamsport, painting by Edwin Forbes On the morning of July 13, Lee became frustrated waiting for Meade to attack him and was dismayed to see that the Federal troops were digging entrenchments of their own in front of his works. He said impatiently, \\"That is too long for me; I can not wait for that. ... They have but little courage!\\" By this time Confederate engineers had completed a new pontoon bridge over the Potomac, which had also subsided enough to be forded. Lee ordered a retreat to start after dark, with Longstreet's and Hill's corps and the artillery to use the pontoon bridge at Falling Waters and Ewell's corps to ford the river at Williamsport.Coddington, pp. 569-70; Wittenberg et al., pp. 263-64, 271-74; Gottfried, p. 288. Meade's orders had stated that the reconnaissance in force by four of his corps would be started by 7 a.m. on July 14, but by this time signs were clear that the enemy had withdrawn. Advancing skirmishers found that the entrenchments were empty. Meade ordered a general pursuit of the Confederates at 8:30 a.m., but very little contact could be made at this late hour. Cavalry under Buford and Kilpatrick attacked the rearguard of Lee's army, Maj. Gen. Henry Heth's division, which was still on a ridge about a mile and a half from Falling Waters. The initial attack caught the Confederates by surprise after a long night with little sleep, and hand-to-hand fighting ensued. Kilpatrick attacked again and Buford struck them in their right and rear. Heth's and Pender's divisions lost as many as 2,000 men as prisoners. Brig. Gen. J. Johnston Pettigrew, who had survived Pickett's Charge with a minor hand wound, was mortally wounded at Falling Waters.Sears, pp. 489-92; Gottfried, p. 288; Coddington, pp. 570-71: Lee disputed this large number of prisoners, claiming that he lost only a small number of stragglers. The minor success against Heth did not make up for the extreme frustration in the Lincoln administration about allowing Lee to escape. The president was quoted by John Hay as saying, \\"We had them within our grasp. We had only to stretch forth our hands and they were ours. And nothing I could say or do could make the Army move.\\"Sears, p. 493; Woodworth, p. 217. Shepherdstown and Manassas Gap Although many descriptions of the Gettysburg Campaign end with Lee's crossing of the Potomac on July 13-14,Wittenberg et al., p. xix. the two armies did not take up positions across from each other on the Rappahannock River for almost two weeks and the official reports of the armies include the maneuvering and minor clashes along the way. On July 16 the cavalry brigades of Fitzhugh Lee and Chambliss held the fords on the Potomac at Shepherdstown to prevent crossing by the Federal infantry. The cavalry division under David Gregg approached the fords and the Confederates attacked them, but the Union cavalrymen held their position until dark before withdrawing. Meade called this a \\"spirited contest.\\"Kennedy, p. 213; Wittenberg et al., p. 345. The Army of the Potomac crossed the Potomac River at Harpers Ferry and Berlin (now named Brunswick) on July 17-18\\\\. They advanced along the east side of the Blue Ridge Mountains, trying to interpose themselves between Lee's army and Richmond. On July 23, Meade ordered French's III Corps to cut off the retreating Confederate columns at Front Royal, by forcing passage through Manassas Gap. At dawn, French began his attack with the New York Excelsior Brigade, led by Brig. Gen. Francis B. Spinola, against Brig. Gen. Ambrose R. Wright's brigade of Georgians, under the command of Col. Edward J. Walker of the 3rd Georgia Regiment, defending the pass. The fight was slow at first, with the superior Union force using its numbers to push Walker from his defensive position back through the gap. About 4:30 p.m., a strong Union attack drove Walker's men until they were reinforced by Maj. Gen. Robert E. Rodes's division and artillery. By dusk, the poorly coordinated Union attacks were abandoned. During the night, Confederate forces withdrew into the Luray Valley. On July 24, the Union army occupied Front Royal, but Lee's army was safely beyond pursuit.Salmon, pp. 215-16; Kennedy, pp. 213-14; Eicher, p. 596; Wittenberg et al., pp. 345-46. Aftermath The retreat from Gettysburg ended the Gettysburg Campaign, Robert E. Lee's final strategic offensive in the Civil War. Afterwards, all combat operations of the Army of Northern Virginia were in reaction to Union initiatives. The Confederates suffered over 5,000 casualties during the retreat, including more than 1,000 captured at Monterey Pass, 1,000 stragglers captured from the wagon train by Gregg's division, 500 at Cunningham's Crossroads, 1,000 captured at Falling Waters, and 460 cavalrymen and 300 infantry and artillery killed, wounded, and missing during the ten days of skirmishes and battles.Wittenberg et al., pp. 343-44. There were over 1,000 Union casualties--primarily cavalrymen--including losses of 263 from Kilpatrick's division at Hagerstown and 120 from Buford's division at Williamsport.Wittenberg et al., p. 343. For the entire campaign, Confederate casualties were approximately 27,000, Union 30,100.Sears, pp. 496, 498. Meade was hampered during the retreat and pursuit not only by his alleged timidity and his willingness to defer to the cautious judgment of his subordinate commanders, but because his army was exhausted. The advance to Gettysburg was swift and tiring, followed by the largest battle of the war. The pursuit of Lee was physically demanding, through inclement weather and over difficult roads much longer than his opponent's. Enlistments expired, causing depletion of his ranks, as did the New York Draft Riots, which occupied thousands of men that could have reinforced the Army of the Potomac.Wittenberg et al., p. 347. Meade was severely criticized for allowing Lee to escape, just as Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan had done after the Battle of Antietam. Under pressure from Lincoln, he launched two campaigns in the fall of 1863--Bristoe and Mine Run-- that attempted to defeat Lee. Both were failures. He also suffered humiliation at the hands of his political enemies in front of the Joint Congressional Committee on the Conduct of the War, questioning his actions at Gettysburg and his failure to defeat Lee during the retreat to the Potomac.Eicher, pp. 597-98, 618-19; Wittenberg et al., pp. 342-43.

Villa Enterprises opened a test kitchen at its Morristown corporate headquarters for menu research and development.  History  Villa Enterprises began in 1964 when Michele Scotto opened his first Villa Pizza shop next to the original Ed Sullivan Theater on Broadway in New York City. Its success led to expansion to over 300 locations. The company is currently run by Scotto's sons; Anthony Scotto serves as CEO, and Biagio Scotto is President. Villa's menus support the culinary philosophy of its founder Michele Scotto, who emigrated to the United States from Naples, Italy. He believed that food should always be prepared by hand on the premises ‚Äì not frozen or pre-processed ‚Äì and feature only fresh produce, sauces and meats. In 2004, Villa Enterprises opened a flagship Villa Caf√© location at Times Square in New York City, and in 2006 a new international headquarters in Morristown, New Jersey.

It was first published in Isaac Asimov's Science Fiction Magazine and has been included in the second edition of the collection Lord Darcy. The Lord Darcy stories are set in an alternate world whose history supposedly diverged from our own during the reign of King Richard the Lionheart, in which King John never reigned. Most of Western Europe and the Americas are united in an Angevin Empire whose continental possessions were never lost by that king. In this world, a magic-based technology has developed in place of the science of our own world. Plot summary Master Sean O'Lochlainn, the Irish forensic sorcerer, visits Paris - in this history, a sleepy provincial city which ceased to be a capital many centuries ago - on a mission to collect evidence for an impending court case. While he takes a break in a hotel bar, a man in a booth is found to have mysteriously died. The police soon arrive, in the shape of bumbling but tenacious Sergeant Cougair Chasseur, for whom Sean casts a preservation spell over the deceased's body until a post mortem can be conducted. But Sean is flabbergasted to be named as a possible murder suspect by Chasseur, who distrusts magic and follows the theory of 'least likely suspect'. Sean is eventually exonerated and able to investigate the circumstances of the death of the man, identified as a retired officer of the Imperial Legion, formerly stationed in Mechicoe (Mexico). He discovers that the deceased has been poisoned whilst drinking Popacotapetl, a very sweet liqueur made in Mechicoe, which has been laced with a bitter poison made from coyotl weed. However, he had been treated with a spell by a Healer, after which all drugs ‚Äì including the one he is taking for malaria ‚Äì taste sweet to him. Eventually, the victim's wife, a much younger woman of Mechicain descent and who is conducting an illicit affair with a liqueur merchant, is unmasked.

Accessed 25 February 2009. Biography Von Milde Von Milde was born in Petronell, near Vienna, the son of an administrator for Prince Guszt√°v Batthy√°ny. He initially planned to study law in Vienna but ultimately ended up studying singing under Franz Hauser and later under the younger Manuel Garc√≠a in Paris. In 1845 he began his opera career at the Staatskapelle Weimar where he remained as a member of the company for his entire career under a lifetime contract. He developed a friendship, both professionally and personally, with Franz Liszt who led the opera performances there from 1848-1858. He notably sang Telramund in the world premiere of Richard Wagner's Lohengrin in 1850 under Liszt's baton. He sang several other Wagner roles with Liszt, including the title role in The Flying Dutchman, Hans Sachs in Die Meistersinger von N√ºrnberg, and Kurwenal in Tristan und Isolde. In 1851 von Milde married the soprano Rosa Agthe, with whom he had shared the stage many times. They had two sons (1855‚Äì1929) and (1859‚Äì1927), both of whom became successful opera singers. In 1852 von Milde portrayed Fieramosca in the premiere of Liszt's revised version of Hector Berlioz‚Äôs Benvenuto Cellini and his wife sang the role of Teresa. The couple also notably sang in the world premieres of Heinrich Dorn's Die Nibelungen on 22 January 1854, Franz Schubert's Alfonso und Estrella on 24 June 1854, Peter Cornelius's Der Barbier von Bagdad on 15 December 1858 and Cornelius's Der Cid in 1865. Hans also sang the High Priest in the first stage performance of Samson et Dalila, at Weimar (1877). Both Hans and his wife retired from the opera stage in Weimar in 1884 and they both began working as singing teachers. Their son Franz published a biography about his parents (Ein ideales K√ºnstlerehepaar, Rosa und Feodor von Milde. Ihre Kunst und ihre Zei) in 1918. Music historian Carlo Droste also wrote a book on the von Milde family (Die Familie von Milde) which was published in 1907.

Predominately influenced by the Federation free style, it is considered a stunning example of Federation colonial architecture at its best. It is also known as Roma Court House and Roma Police Buildings. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 7 August 1998.  History  The Roma Courthouse is a rendered masonry building located on a triangular block facing McDowall Street. It was constructed between 1900 and 1901 and was designed by architect John Smith Murdoch, the Second Assistant Architect of the Queensland Works Department. The Police Buildings were completed in 1919 as the Roma police station, barracks, offices and cell block, servicing the Roma district. The Roma Police Buildings are simple single-storeyed timber buildings adjacent to the Roma Courthouse, also facing McDowall street. Roma was the principal town of the Mount Abundance district, which was established as a pastoral and agricultural region after exploration by Thomas Mitchell, New South Wales Surveyor General in 1846. It was originally settled by squatters, who established it as primarily a sheep grazing area. The township of Roma was proclaimed in September 1862, the first town formed in Queensland after separation in 1859. Roma was named after Lady Bowen, wife of the first Governor of Queensland, Sir George Ferguson Bowen. She was the daughter of a Governor of the Ionian Islands and her maiden name was Countess Diamantina Georgina di Roma. Surveyor McDowall laid out the town reserving a section for public buildings bounded by Bungil, Charles, McDowall and Gregory streets. The first land sales were held in September 1863. The town of Roma was declared a municipality, the Borough of Roma, in 1867. The growth in Roma's economy and population was matched by similar development in the administration of law and order in the town. Over 145 courthouses were constructed in Queensland between separation in 1859 and 1900. There was considerable variation in the types and size of structures, ranging from the slab construction in Cunnamulla in 1869 to the masonry of the Supreme Court in Rockhampton in 1887. In the first course of construction, between 1860 and 1874, the government established 40 courthouses in the initial establishment phase of townships. Between 1875 and 1890 the growth in Queensland's economy and population continued and the corresponding construction of courthouses proceeded in newly formed townships. The marked difference in this second phase in development was the significant improvement in the quality of the built form. This period also saw the replacement of the temporary constructions of the earlier period. The 1890s saw a decrease in the building of courthouses; an average of two buildings per year were completed in the ten years to federation. Roma Courthouse is one of only ten surviving masonry courthouses built in Queensland in the 19th century. = Roma Courthouse = In 1865, a reserve for court and police purposes was selected in Roma, on the hill west of the town centre. This reserve was bounded by McDowall, May (now Soutter), Queen and Albert Streets. The latter street once connected Albert and Spencer Streets. It was on this site that the first Roma courthouse was completed in 1866. From 1863 local magistrates had conducted court hearings in rented premises. The first courthouse faced Albert Street, and was a small timber building, extended in 1884 to accommodate sittings of the Supreme Court in circuit. The location of the courthouse influenced the town's continued development, resulting in the area becoming known as the West End. This first courthouse was the site of the first meeting of the Roma Town Council on 10 August 1867. A simple concrete monument mounted with a granite tablet and plaque, commemorating this event, is located at the front of the Police Station in McDowall Street. It was erected during centenary celebrations in 1967 and was unveiled by Gwydir Laycock, former chairman of the Bungil Shire Council. Roma flourished with the advent of the railway in the 1880s, ensuring the efficient transportation of stock and produce to the coastal ports. The Great Artesian Basin was tapped in Queensland in the late 1880s and early 1890s, securing an alternate water supply for cattle and sheep. Consistent with the growth of the Maronoa district was the increasing demand for justice administration. During this period cases heard in the various courts held at Roma increased from approximately 210 in 1892 to 280 in 1898. The trial in 1872 of Harry Redford (also known as Captain Starlight) was held in the Roma Courthouse. Redford was accused of stealing 1,000 head of cattle from Bowen Downs Station near Longreach in Queensland and driving them to South Australia. Explorers Burke and Wills had died attempting to cross the same terrain nine years earlier. He was tried and acquitted in February 1873. Roma's 1866 courthouse was replaced in 1901 with a new building erected a little to the east, on a new reserve for court purposes gazetted in 1900. The courthouse reserve was created by combining a market reserve, at the corner of McDowall and Queen Streets, with part of the Albert Street road reserve which had been incorporated with the police reserve in 1883. The Roma Courthouse was designed by John Smith Murdoch who at the time was the Second Assistant Architect, responsible for the designing and drafting staff, of the Queensland Department of Public Works. Murdoch arrived in Australia from Scotland, originally working in Melbourne. He began working for the Queensland Department of Public Works in the mid 1880s, leaving temporarily to practice privately with John Hall and Sons, before returning in the mid 1890s. Murdoch later went on to become the first Australian Government Architect in 1919. The original 1899 design for the new courthouse was to be of timber, based on a H-shaped design. However, the township of Roma demanded a courthouse that reflected the Western Districts' growth in population, economic importance and political power. The community thought a grand architectural gesture more appropriate than the planned building. The plans were altered to accommodate brick, thought to be more substantial and lasting. The laying of the foundation stone was performed in a ceremony by the Mayor of Roma, Alderman John McEwan Hunter on 4 September 1900. The building was completed in December 1901 for a cost of ¬£5964. The new courthouse was built alongside the old, allowing the legal and police activities to continue during construction. After the 1866 building was vacated by the court in 1902, it was converted to constables quarters and was finally removed from the site in 1931. The major consideration in the design and planning of the 1900-1901 courthouse was the allowance for the correct movement of people in the building and the separation of the different groups involved in the judicial process. The verandahs and arcades allowed for specific delineated entrances to the buildings. Jurors and barristers entered the courthouse by an alternative route to the public on their way to the public spaces. Judges and the Attorney-General had a private entrance and lobby via the rear verandah. The Police Magistrate and barristers could also access their rooms from this verandah. The prisoners would be brought directly from the police cells to the court room through the side arcade door. The separate female and male witness rooms, were located at the front of the courthouse to avoid hearing previous evidence before making their testimony. With consideration for the harsh western climate a detailed and technical ventilation system was constructed in the Roma Courthouse. Conventional cast iron wall ventilators were combined with Tobin's Tubes to carry cool air from beneath the building into the court room. Boyles roof ventilation using an air pump ventilator, connected by an iron shaft to a bell mouth over a ceiling ventilator, extracted the hot air from the building. Fireplaces were incorporated to provide heating in the winter. In May 1931 trees were planted to beautify the Roma Courthouse grounds as part of the Unemployment Relief Scheme. In January 1934 five bottle trees, Kurrajong and other indigenous trees were added to the grounds. The bottle trees at the front of the building replaced the original picket fence and match the trees planted as part of Heroes Avenue to serve as a memorial to the Roma residents who enlisted in the First World War. It is not clear whether these trees were planted to serve a commemorative function. The interior of the court room was extensively altered in the 1960s with the addition of a false ceiling and updating of the fixtures and the furniture. The new ceiling effectively blocked the clerestory windows and covered the domed roof, altering the patterns of light and ventilation. It is probable that the original masonry parapets on the rear of the buildings were removed during the recladding of the roof during these alterations. In 1973, alterations to the main court room to accommodate the clerk of court in the front section of the building, including the former witness rooms, was carried out. Air conditioning was added in 1978. = Roma Police Buildings = The Police Buildings, which are single-storeyed timber structures, were erected in 1919. They comprise offices and barracks, addressing McDowall Street, and a cell block at the rear of the Police Reserve. A lock up was the first purpose built police building in Roma, completed during the construction of the first courthouse in 1866. In 1868, a gaol servicing the wider region, was located on a separate reserve at the corner of Souter and McDowall Streets, adjacent to the courthouse and lock up. The gaol was closed in 1923 and the site is now occupied by three police residences. The first Roma police station was built in 1885 and was located to the north of the 1866 courthouse, facing Albert Street. The building provided both accommodation for police and office space for official duties. Prior to the completion of the station, police were accommodated in timber huts, private lodgings or a choice of Roma's many public establishments. The 1885 police station was replaced in 1919 with a new police station and barracks facing McDowall street, on the site of the 1866 courthouse. At this time, the first police station was converted to Senior Sergeants quarters and removed or demolished in 1957. The 1919 Police Station was designed by the office of the Queensland Government Architect. It was a modified E-shape, that incorporated climatic design considerations and classical architecture features. A single-storeyed structure, the design separates the official police duties from the residential accommodation. A covered way and garden acts to both link and separate the two buildings and their relative functions. The police barracks are housed in the western building with the offices of the senior sergeant and the sub inspector housed in the eastern building. The design of the barracks indicates the improvement of living conditions for members of the force in comparison with the rudimentary conditions of the late 19th century and early 20th century. It incorporates dormitory, a billiard room, kitchen and cook's room and a generous dining area on the rear verandah. The use of latticework on the rear verandah ventilated the dining space. The preference for single men as constables is indicated by the dormitory style quarters. During 1962 there were major additions, alterations and spatial reconfiguration of the Police Buildings. New concrete stumps and weatherboards were installed and a new store was added to the western back corner of the McDowall Street building. The conversion of the police barracks to act only as a police station occurred at this time, the new arrangement of the spaces in the building was associated with this change. New toilets were installed in 1970; a covered work bay was added in 1978; and a tea room in 1979. A cell block consisting of four cells, each facing a verandah, was constructed at the same time as the 1919 police station. This building was used for remand of prisoners before trial or awaiting transfer to larger correctional facilities. In 1962, two new cells were added to the building, providing an extra female cell and a female toilet. In the western section of the building, two cells were converted to a charge room and records room; and a male toilet. In 1998 this building was repositioned on the police reserve to accommodate the construction of a new watch house.  Description  Roma Courthouse = Roma Courthouse is located on a triangular block bounded by McDowall and Queen Streets and the Police Reserve. The building faces south toward McDowall Street and is aligned to this street. It is a single- storeyed rendered masonry building designed in a style that is influenced by Federation Free Style. Together with the adjoining police buildings, it forms a precinct of justice administration. The H-shaped plan incorporates the entrance facade, the court room which dominates the form of the building and rear wings. The symmetrical form of the entrance facade incorporates a prominent central curved vestibule, with four approach steps. The vestibule has four columns, two pilasters and entablature of the Ionic order. The main entrance is double doors with 4 panels and is crowned by a Queensland coat of arms. Ornate notice boards are located either side of the door. The vestibule is flanked on the east and west sides by rooms featuring double hung windows, with semi-circular fanlights, facing McDowall street. The entablature is continued around the front facade of the building. The entablature, string courses and window heads are cement rendered with a ruled render surface continued throughout externally. Three clerestory windows are situated above the arcades either side of the building. Each window has five panes and a timber louvred panel. Three air conditioning units are located on the western arcade roof. Paired narrow double-hung windows face south from the wings. The rear verandah is partially enclosed with fibro cladding and louvred and aluminium frame windows. The verandah provides access to the office spaces. Arcades provide additional entrance points to the court room, the front rooms and the symmetrical east and west wings. The east side wing comprises a lobby area, jury room and crown solicitors office. The west side wing comprises a lobby area, and the offices of the court of petty sessions and the police magistrate. Behind the court room, the Judges chamber and the office of the Attorney General are located. No room is larger than the central courtroom. The 1973 remodelling of the court room space created a clerk of the court public office that occupies the front section of the building. The main court room has a suspened ceiling and all original furniture has been replaced. The interior retains original decorative architraves, and other original details such as joinery and fireplaces are evident in some areas. The rolled galvanised iron roof has five tall chimneys and seven roof ventilators of varied size. The court room roof is raised above both the roof of the rear and front sections. The separate flat arcade roofing at the half elevation maintains access for light and ventilation through the clerestory windows. The roof is a gable hipped, with ventilator louvres in the gablets and corresponding smaller gablets cap the east and west wings. A small forward projecting gablet proclaims the arched entrance to the rear verandah. A masonry toilet block is located at the rear of the building. Five bottle trees (Brachychiton rupestris), Kurrajong (Brachychiton populensis) and other indigenous trees are located in the courthouse grounds. A simple flagpole is centrally located in front of the main entrance to the building. = Police Buildings = The Police Buildings are located in the Police Reserve on McDowall street adjacent to the west of the Roma Courthouse. The Police Buildings comprise a timber police station and a timber cell block/lock up. The police station is a combination of two separate single-storeyed timber buildings with corrugated iron roofing, connected by a covered way. The Police Station faces south and is aligned to McDowall Street. The cell block is located at the rear of the Police Station and the 1998 watch house. A modified E-shape plan incorporates two buildings connected by a covered way. The western building is weatherboard clad with a hipped corrugated iron roof. A verandah runs the breadth of the building and has been enclosed at each end creating two rooms which are entered from the verandah. The verandah has paired verandah posts and timber rail balustrade. Four timber approach steps are off centre and directly access the main entrance door to the police station. A faceted bay window protrudes onto the verandah space. An eyelid dormer window with four small fixed casements is located above the bay window. A decorative fleche is centred on the roof ridge, aligned with the dormer and bay windows. The eastern, smaller building, is asymmetrical. Seven timber approach steps, with a simple iron balustrade led to a forward projecting gabled porch. Paired aluminium doors provide entrance to the screened verandah. The front verandah has paired verandah posts rising from weatherboard piers. The main pyramidal roof is extended over the verandah. A decorative fleche matching the western building is centrally located on the roof. Casement windows with simple timber supported hoods are located on the western and eastern faces of both buildings. The covered way has five timber approach steps, entered via the garden area between the two buildings. This entrance provides access to the rear of both buildings. The cell block/lock up is a simple weatherboard clad building with corrugated iron roof. A verandah is located along the south eastern face of the building with paired verandah posts that match those of the police station. The building is raised on timber stumps and is entered via four timber steps located at the south western end of the building. Three sets of louvres are located in the front verandah enclosure. Four south-western and 6 north-western facing hopper windows indicate the internal office space at the south western end of the building. Six small high set windows, with iron bars, are located on the eastern face of the building indicating the former cells. Located at the former gate entrance of the Police buildings, is a simple concrete monument mounted with a granite tablet and plaque. It reads \\"This plaque commemorates the first meeting of the Roma Town Council, 10 August 1867, Thomas McEwan, Mayor\\".  Heritage listing  Roma Courthouse and Police Buildings was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 7 August 1998 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The Roma Courthouse was constructed in 1900-1901 and the Police Buildings in 1919. The Roma Courthouse and Police Buildings reflect the development of Roma, a pastoral service town, and the establishment of government administration for the prosperous surrounding district, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The large masonry form of the Roma Courthuse is indicative of the relevant importance of Roma in relation to other towns in western Queensland. The Police Buildings reflect the multi-functional use of the police reserve to accommodate residences, official duties and remand facilities. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The Roma Courthouse and Police Buildings are good examples of Queensland Public Works courthouse and police buildings design in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. The Roma Courthouse and Police Buildings are of considerable aesthetic significance due to their landmark qualities and for their high degree of design and workmanship. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The site of Roma Courthouse and Police Buildings is significant for a long association with law and order and the dispensing of justice in Roma since 1866. The Roma Courthouse and Police Buildings are an important community focus in the township of Roma, connecting the local and district community to governance in the Maronoa District of south western Queensland. The monument commemorating the first town council is evidence of the importance of this site to the community. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. Roma Courthouse has a strong association with important architect John Smith Murdoch, as an example of the development of his work.

His collection was described by Th√©ophile Gautier as \\"the first ever to be formed by a child of Islam\\". He was furthermore involved in diplomatic affairs following the aftermath of the Crimean War. He also served as the Ottoman Minister of Foreign Affairs. Name For most of his life, Halil was known by the name Halil Bey or Khalil Bey. \\"Bey\\" was not a surname but rather a courtesy title recognized and sanctioned by the Ottoman government to designate a man as being the son of a Pasha. Halil used the title \\"Bey\\" as part of his name because his father Muhammad ≈ûerif had attained the rank of Pasha. On 10 August 1871, Halil Bey was raised to the rank of Mushir (Field Marshal) by Sultan Abdulaziz (reigned 1861‚Äì1876). The rank of \\"Mushir\\" entitled Halil to use his father's name \\"≈ûerif\\", as well as the honorific title \\"Pasha\\", as parts of his name. Life Of Turkish-Albanian origin, Halil was born in Cairo, Egypt in the mansion of Muhammad Ali of Egypt. Halil's father, Muhammad ≈ûerif Pasha, of Albanian origin, (died 13 February 1865) had emigrated to Egypt from Kavala (in what is now northern Greece) to serve as a captain in Muhammad Ali's army, making a huge fortune in the process. Muhammad ≈ûerif Pasha sent Halil, along with his brothers Ali Pasha Sherif (1834‚Äì1897) and Osman, to be educated at the √âcole Militaire √âgyptienne (Egyptian Military School), which Muhammad Ali Pasha had set up in Paris in 1844. Halil took up his first official post in 1855 as Commissioner to the International Exhibition in Paris that year. He entered the Ottoman diplomatic service in 1856, serving as one of the plenipotentiaries negotiating the end to the Crimean War, and then as ambassador to Athens and Saint Petersburg, on which posts he began collecting art. He grew to dislike the cold of Saint Petersburg and so retired in a private capacity to Paris in the mid-1860s, renting expensive rooms from the English collector Lord Hertford on Rue Taitbout and becoming a noted gambler, art collector and patron. He was introduced to Gustave Courbet by Sainte-Beuve, and commissioned Le Sommeil (The Sleepers) and L'Origine du monde from him. The latter painting is likely to be of his then lover, Constance Qu√©niaux. He also acquired Le Bain turc (The Turkish Bath) from Ingres and other works by Delacroix, Troyon, Daubigny, Meissonier, Corot, Rousseau and Gerome. Works known to have been owned by Halil ≈ûerif Pasha include: * Eug√®ne Delacroix, The Murder of the Bishop of Li√®ge (now in the Louvre, Paris) * Eug√®ne Delacroix, The Women of Algiers (one version is in the Louvre, Paris, but it is unclear if this is the one owned by Halil) * Eug√®ne Delacroix, Tasso in the Hospital of St Anna at Ferrara (Buhrle private collection, Zurich) * Eug√®ne Delacroix, Tam o' Shanter (after the poem by Robert Burns) (Castle Museum, Nottingham) * Eug√®ne Delacroix, Arab Cavalry Practising a Cavalry Charge (Fabre Museum, Montpellier) In January 1868 he sold off his art collection just before leaving to become Ottoman ambassador to Vienna, thus getting out of Paris only two years before the Franco-Prussian War. After the Vienna posting, he moved to Istanbul and married Princess Nazli Fazl, the daughter of a prominent reformer of the time, Mustafa Fazl Pasha. In 1877, he returned to Paris as Ottoman ambassador for a few months, but was dismissed from his post in September of that year. Halil ≈ûerif Pasha died in Istanbul on 12 January 1879. Some sources record his death as being due to heatstroke while seated on a horse during Abdul Hamid II's accession parade. However, the accession parade was in August 1876.

As a member of the Primrose League, Doran was lead speaker in support of the British Empire in a debate on \\"Communism v Imperialism\\" held at Speakers' Corner on 7 March 1926, arguing that the Empire had been built up on the spirit of liberty and gave British people more freedom than any other nation.\\"Communism or the Empire?\\", The Manchester Guardian, 8 March 1926, p. 15. Entry to Parliament At the 1931 general election, Doran fought as a Conservative in Tottenham North, which had a Labour majority of 9,653 at the previous election. After a 'gallant challenge',\\"North and East London\\", The Times, 27 October 1931, p. 6. Doran won the seat by a majority of 4,521. Early in his Parliamentary career he pressed for relaxations in the licensing laws in order to help British holiday resorts, and as a followup pressed for more licensed victuallers to be appointed as licensing magistrates.\\"Parliament\\", The Times, 24 March 1932, p. 7. He also advocated that the Sunday Observance Acts should be abolished,\\"Parliament\\", The Times, 28 May 1932, p. 7. and supported the rejection of a Bill which would have given local authorities the power to prohibit dog racing.\\"Parliament\\", The Times, 3 December 1932, p. 6. Jewish refugees Doran became known for raising issues relating to Jews. On 9 March 1933, he asked the Home Secretary to prevent \\"any alien Jews entering this country from Germany\\". Having received a discouraging answer, he pressed again to stop \\"hundreds of thousands of Jews .. scurrying .. to this country\\", eventually adding that a British version of Hitler would arise if action was not taken.Richard Griffiths, \\"Fellow Travellers of the Right\\", Constable, 1980, p. 81-2. On 26 April, Doran hosted a meeting at the House of Commons in the name of 'The Liberator Group' at which Adolf Hitler's representative in London spoke on \\"the true meaning of Germany's attitude towards the Jews\\".\\"The Liberator Group\\", The Times, 27 April 1933, p. 8. On 25 May he put down a written question asking for the number of registered moneylenders and their nationality; and in December 1933 he was to be found demanding action against 3,000 \\"fraudulent bankrupts, who are mainly alien Jews\\". The historian Richard Griffiths summed up his attitude as being obsessed by questions relating to Jews which affected the working class. Broadcasting policy Another subject which interested Doran was broadcasting. He formed a committee to inquire into the BBC,\\"Sir T. Beecham and the B.B.C.\\", The Times, 10 February 1933, p. 10. On 14 March he pressed in Parliament for a reduction in the grant to the BBC.\\"Parliament\\", The Times, 15 March 1933, p. 7. In March 1935 he made a speech which drew much laughter, claiming that George Lansbury had smuggled some of the Russian Crown Jewels to Britain in an attempt to raise funds for the Labour Party.\\"Parliament\\", The Times, 5 March 1935, p. 7. On 11 April 1935, Doran (apparently working in concert with Major the hon. J.J. Stourton) returned to the subject of Jewish refugees and asked for restrictions to stop people at ports supplying refugees with money so that they satisfied the requirements of the Aliens Act.Richard Griffiths, \\"Patriotism Perverted\\", Constable, 1998, p. 20. Constituency difficulties Doran's performance in Parliament and alleged neglect of his constituency caused concern among his constituency association and in August 1933 the association called a special meeting at which it was speculated they might have decided to adopt another candidate.\\"North Tottenham Conservatives\\", The Times, 21 August 1933, p. 12. The association gave Doran its backing, the Chairman telling the local paper that \\"any man who sided with the Jew persecution .. was a cad\\".Richard Griffiths, \\"Fellow Travellers of the Right\\", Constable, 1980, p. 82-3, citing Tottenham and Edmonton Weekly Herald, 25 August 1933. The dispute re-emerged in the summer of 1935. A meeting on 22 July rejected a motion of no confidence in Doran by 123 votes to 57, but in August the officers and executive committee of the association all resigned. Doran defended his conduct and decided to call a new meeting to appoint new officers.\\"M.P. and his Party Executive\\", The Times, 10 August 1935, p. 10. Defeat At the 1935 general election, Doran was duly endorsed by the Conservatives to defend his seat. He argued in support of the protective tariffs imposed by the National Government, claiming that the factories built in Tottenham since the tariffs had practically cured the unemployment problem in the borough.\\"Effects of National Government\\", The Times, 9 November 1935, p. 18. However Doran lost the seat by over 8,000 votes.\\"The Times House of Commons 1935\\", p. 80. An antisemitic journal called \\"The Patriot\\" founded by the Duke of Northumberland later ascribed Doran's loss of his seat to attacks made on him by Conservative Central Office.Richard Griffiths, \\"Fellow Travellers of the Right\\", Constable, 1980, p. 82, citing The Patriot, 25 August 1938.

Unable to locate him, they set off back for Wexford that night, only to pass his van on a lonely Wexford road. Both men were familiar with Rogers and Lyttleton left his gun in the police car. But, whilst searching the van, Rogers pulled his gun on the pair. Lyttleton managed to escape, whereas Rogers was injured and made his way to a neighbour's house, the Kellys'.

The house had been booby trapped with explosives, and 24-year-old Garda Michael Clerkin, from Monaghan and only four years in the force, was killed. Detective Tom Peters was also seriously injured and left both deaf and blind, whilst colleagues Jim Cannon, Ben Thornton and Gerry Bohan survived the attack unscathed. It occurred just after President Cearbhall √ì D√°laigh signed the Emergency Powers Bill into law, which during turbulent times aimed to increase the period of detention without charge from two to seven days. Garda√≠ in Portlaoise received an anonymous phone call stating that subversive activity was ongoing at a disused house at Garryhinch, with a plot to kill local Fine Gael TD Oliver J. Flanagan. Portlaoise phoned the local Portarlington Station, just three miles from Garryhinch and Sergeant Jim Cannon was advised to go to the disused house. Cannon brought two uniformed Garda√≠ with him, Gerry Bohan and Michael Clerkin, and the two joined forces with Detectives Tom Peters and Ben Thornton on the way. Clerkin used an open rear window to enter the house, opening the front door from the inside to let the others in, triggering the booby trap and killing himself instantaneously.

However, the bogus garda√≠ produced guns and kidnapped the Quinnsworth supermarket executive, holding him for three weeks. A manhunt ensued and Don Tidey became a household name. Intelligence led to the search returning to North Leitrim and, weeks before Christmas, a co- ordinated search code-named Operation Santa Claus was mounted in Ballinamore. The operation was treated so highly that the army as well as hundreds of Garda√≠ and even Garda Recruits, still in training, became involved. On 16 December, Inspector S√©amus O'Hanlon's group recommenced their search following lunch in Drumcromin wood, near Derrada a few miles north of Ballinamore. They stumbled upon the kidnappers' hideout in a thicket with low visibility - what followed was a confusing and chaotic.

JSTOR is a complex of fifth century buildings located in the mountains of Isauria in southern Asia Minor (Mersin province in modern day Turkey). Located at an altitude of 4,000 ft, it stands 3,000 ft over the Calycadnus valley and is a one-hour walking distance from the village of Ge√ßimli. Although termed a monastery in many sources, this attribution is contested and more recent scholarship consider it to be a pilgrimage shrine. The complex played a significant role in the development of early Byzantine architecture, and practically everything known about it can be attributed to the excavations of Michael Gough. History Construction took place during two periods. The first occurred in the mid-fifth century under Emperor Leo I, while the second occurred in the last quarter of the fifth century under Emperor Zeno.Gough, Michael. \\"The Emperor Zeno and Some Cilician Churches.\\" Anatolian Studies 22 (1972): 199-212. JSTOR [JSTOR]. Web The complex contains two churches, rock-cut chambers, a baptistery, living quarters, and many other spaces, like a forecourt, necropolis, bathhouse, and lower terrace. There is debate about the monastery‚Äôs original purpose, but it nonetheless became a communal living space for monks and those seeking pilgrimage until the seventh century CE, at which point it became abandoned. Upon assuming power, Emperor Zeno, an Isaurian, took over construction and likely funded the project. He often returned to his homeland as a means of retreat, which could suggest his interest in completing the project. The complex is an example of expert Isaurian stonemasonry. Alahan is a key site in the history of early Byzantine architecture, half a century before the great achievements of Anicia Juliana and Justinian in Constantinople.Alahan- An Early Christian Monastery in Southern Turkey Pictures:  Buildings  Cave Church = Cave Complex At the western end of the site there is a large naturally formed cave about 10 m (32.8 ft) high. It used to contain many large rooms arranged on three floors, each just over 2 m high, though now it is almost completely empty. Inside the cave complex there is a church, which is about 7.5 by 7.7 m (24.5 by 25 ft) in size. The cave church is believed to be the first of the monastery‚Äôs churches to be built.Bakker, Gerard, and Mary Gough. Alahan: An Early Christian Monastery in Southern Turkey. Toronto: Pontificial Institute of Medieval Stuies, 1985. 75-147. Print. = West Church = Doorway of the West Church The West Church, referred to by Gough as the ‚ÄúChurch of the Evangelists,‚Äù is the largest of all the churches in the monastery, with an overall measurement of 36 by 16 m (118 by 52.5 ft). The church has a basilica form with three rows - a central nave and two side aisles. It was built after the cave church, but before the East Church. It is the least preserved of all three churches and early visitors to the site did not identify it as a church, but as a gateway to the site. According to Gough, the provision of two pastophories proves that it was a church, and decorations found on its adorned gateway make reference to Evangelism, supporting Gough‚Äôs given name for the building. Gough‚Äôs excavation discovered decorations of sculpted masonry and rich mosaics, which suggests that the church had wealthy patronage during its time. The rugged terrain of the mountains meant that much of the cliff side had to be cut back during building. Even then, the plan of the church was adapted to fit the lay of the land. As a result, it doesn‚Äôt resemble the perfect east/west orientation that was typical of churches at the time. = East Church = West fa√ßade of the East Church The East Church, located on the far eastern side of the monastery, is the best preserved of all the churches. It is considerably smaller than the West Church, measuring 23 by 15 m (75.5 by 49 ft) in size. It has a basilica design with a tower superimposed over the east section of the nave. Gough believes that the roof was likely not made of stone, as practically none were found among the rubble of his excavation. Rather, he suggests that it was likely made of a light timber tiles. Inside the East Church This church is less decorated than the other two because it was only approached from within the monastery complex. It contains only slight adornments on the entrance. = Colonnaded Walkway = Colonnaded Walkway A colonnaded walkway, originally covered, connects the West and the East Churches. The walkway also provided access to other buildings in the complex, like the baptistery and living quarters. It also restricted access to the site from the hillside below, thanks to a high retaining wall on its south side. No evidence exists to suggest the type of roof that covered the walkway. = Baptistery = Baptistery and its baptismal pool A twin-apsed baptistery with two aisles, oriented east-west, with an entrance to the south through the north wall of the colonnaded walkway. The discovery of a cruciform-shaped baptismal pool confirms that the building was used as a baptistery. It is believed that it was built as the community at Alahan expanded, as a font located in the cave church likely served as the original baptistery. There is painting present inside the baptistery that is not in the east church, perhaps because the painters were no longer present when the east church was finished. This suggests that there was a considerable lapse in time between the construction of each building. There is not enough evidence to suggest conclusively what type of roof covered the building. = Living Quarters = As the community grew, the living quarters in the cave complex were no longer sufficiently sized. Additional living quarters were built between the west church and the baptistery with four separate groups of rooms. These quarters could be entered through the cave complex and the colonnaded walkway. = Other spaces = The complex has many other spaces. These include a forecourt, located outside the east church and north of the colonnaded walkway; a necropolis just west of the forecourt; tombs of Tarasis the Elder and Younger, carved into the cliff side next to the necropolis; a spring complex that directed water around and under buildings, both to keep them dry and to provide a reliable water source to the community; a bath house, located far east, past the east church; and a lower terrace in the valley that was used for agriculture. Visitors The Ottoman traveler, Evliya √áelebi, visited the monastery in 1671-72 and his account recorded his amazement along with his recommendation that, \\"This is something that deserves a visit.\\"Alahan Monastery and its Setting in the Isaurian country Side, Michael Gough, Alahan: An Early Christian Monastery in Southern Turkey, ed. Mary Gough, (Pontifical Institute of Medieval Studies, 1985), 4. The first European visitor Count Leon de Laborde who arrived in 1826 was enthusiastic but inaccurate in his written accounts of the monastery. This was followed by the English cleric, A.C. Headlam, who wrote an exhaustive article which gives meticulous detail to the monastic complex as well as the church located at the east end. Headlam postulated that Alahan may be a known as the Byzantine monastery Apadna, which was restored during Justinians reign, however, Michael Gough states Alahan shows no signs of restoration to support this premise.Some Recent Finds at Alahan (Koja Kalessi), Michael Gough, Anatolian Studies, 119.

Between 1920 and 1921, the league's best teams were absorbed into the National Football League, though none survive in that league today. It was one of the biggest challengers to the Ohio League in professional football in the 1910s. Its formation was highly informal. The teams were largely clustered around the two cities of Rochester, New York and Buffalo, New York, with rural teams to fill the differences. Rochester had built its reputation around a strong \\"sandlot football\\" circuit, for instance, and was most popular when it consisted mostly of local teams. Rochester's best team, the Jeffersons, was instrumental in bringing the NYPFL and the Ohio League together to form the NFL. The circuit continued to exist even after the birth of the NFL (with the NYPFL teams continuing to play in both circuits), with the league finally dwindling away in the late 1920s and early 1930s. One NYPFL team, the Watertown Red & Black, still survives.

The Jeffersons continued operating, including a game against the Detroit Heralds and one game against a local squad, but never challenged Buffalo to a title match. *1919: See below 1919 playoffs The NYPFL is believed to have been the first professional football league to use a playoff format (as opposed to a single-game championship) in 1919. The Buffalo Semi-Pro, Rochester, and Central New York divisions were known to have championships. In the Buffalo division, the Buffalo Prospects defeated the Tonawanda Lumberjacks by a score of 12-7. In Central New York, All-Syracuse defeated the Watertown Red & Black and advanced to face Buffalo the next week. Buffalo defeated Syracuse 23-0. The Rochester Jeffersons won the Rochester circuit title. This led to the two-game \\"New York Pro Championship\\" between the Buffalo and Rochester divisions over Thanksgiving weekend in 1919, with the Buffalo Prospects defeating the Rochester Jeffersons by a score of 20-0 in the second of two games (the first, held on Thanksgiving Day, was a scoreless tie, necessitating a rematch). Playoffs and championships were abandoned after the 1919 season once the NFL formed. Role in the NFL's founding Both Buffalo and Rochester had significant ties to the teams in the Ohio League, stemming back to 1917, when both teams went barnstorming in Ohio. The Jeffersons were able to land a game against the top team in the nation, the Canton Bulldogs, where Jeffersons owner Leo Lyons suggested to Bulldogs coach Jim Thorpe and owner Ralph Hay that a league format could eventually become as popular as Major League Baseball.THE TOWN THAT HATED PRO FOOTBALL . Pro Football Researchers Association. 1981. Buffalo, too, had connections to the Ohio League. In addition to a team of \\"Buffalo All-Stars\\" barnstorming in 1917 against the Detroit Heralds and Massillon Tigers, Buffalo quarterback Tommy Hughitt had moonlighted as a member of the Ohio League's Youngstown Patricians.

History It was named after the first Earl of Cork and once formed part of the ancient highway \\"An Slighe D√°la\\" connecting Dublin with the west of Ireland. On old maps it was described as \\"The Highway to Dolfynesberne\\" (i.e., Dolphin's Barn). The street was once a centre of fine wool and silk hand-loom weaving. The woolen industry was killed off around 1700 by the English government, who wanted to keep the wool monopoly in England, although a minor revival was started around 1775.Lecky, History of England in the Eighteenth Century, Chapter VII Despite problems, silk spinning and the manufacture of poplin, supported by the Royal Dublin Society, continued into the 19th century.M'Gregor, A New Picture of Dublin, 1821 The Tenter House was erected in 1815 in this street, financed by Thomas Pleasants. Before this the poor weavers of the Liberties had either to suspend work in rainy weather or use the alehouse fire and thus were (as Wright expresses it) \\"exposed to great distress, and not unfrequently reduced either to the hospital or the gaol.\\" The Tenter House was a brick building 275 feet long, 3 stories high, and with a central cupola. It had a form of central heating powered by four furnaces, and provided a place for weavers to stretch their material in bad weather. In 1861 a Carmelite priest bought the Tenter House and opened it as a refuge for the homeless. He ran the hostel for ten years until 1871 when the Sisters of Mercy came to Cork Street. In 1873 they built a convent and in 1874 a primary school, which closed down in 1989. Cork Street Fever Hospital The Cork Street Fever Hospital (also known as the House of Recovery) was a hospital that opened in Cork Street on 14 May 1804. The hospital was extended in 1817-1819 to help cope with a national typhus epidemic. In 1953 the Cherry Orchard Hospital in Ballyfermot replaced the old Cork Street hospital, which was renamed Br√∫ Chaoimh√≠n and became a nursing home.Douglas Bennett, Encyclopedia of Dublin, 1992, p. 74 Across the road from the hospital is the James Weir Home for nurses, built in 1903. The site had once been a Quaker burial ground. In 1932 the Maryland housing development off Cork Street was constructed by Dublin Corporation. 1932 was a Marian year, hence the name Maryland. The street was totally reconstructed towards the end of the 20th century. It is now a mostly residential area.

NATO's intervention began as largely political and symbolic, but gradually expanded to include large-scale air operations and the deployment of approximately 60,000 soldiers under Operation Joint Endeavor. Early involvement and monitoring NATO involvement in the Bosnian War and the Yugoslav Wars in general began in February 1992, when the alliance issued a statement urging all the belligerents in the conflict to allow the deployment of United Nations peacekeepers. While primarily symbolic, this statement paved the way for later NATO actions. On July 10, 1992, at a meeting in Helsinki, NATO foreign ministers agreed to assist the United Nations in monitoring compliance with sanctions established under United Nations Security Council resolutions 713 (1991) and 757 (1992). This led to the commencement of Operation Maritime Monitor off the coast of Montenegro, which was coordinated with the Western European Union Operation Sharp Guard in the Strait of Otranto on July 16. On October 9, 1992, the Security Council passed Resolution 781, establishing a no-fly zone over Bosnia-Herzegovina. In response, on October 16, NATO expanded its mission in the area to include Operation Sky Monitor, which monitored Bosnian airspace for flights from the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. Enforcing compliance 1992‚Äì1993 On November 16, 1992, the Security Council issued Resolution 787, which called upon member states to \\"halt all inward and outbound maritime shipping in order to inspect and verify their cargos\\" to ensure compliance with sanctions. In response to this resolution, NATO deactivated Maritime Monitor on November 22, and replaced it with Operation Maritime Guard, under which NATO forces were authorized to stop ships and inspect their cargos. Unlike Sky Monitor and Maritime Monitor, this was a true enforcement mission, not just a monitoring one. NATO's air mission also switched from monitoring to enforcement. The Security Council issued Resolution 816, which authorized states to use measures \\"to ensure compliance\\" with the no-fly zone over Bosnia. In response, on April 12, 1993, NATO initiated Operation Deny Flight which was tasked with enforcing the no-fly zone, using fighter aircraft based in the region.Beale, Michael. Bombs over Bosnia: The Role of Airpower in Bosnia-Herzegovina. Air University Press, 1997. p. 19 Throughout 1993, the role of NATO forces in Bosnia gradually grew. On June 10, 1993, NATO and the UN agreed that aircraft acting under Deny Flight would provide close air support to UNPROFOR at the request of the UN. On June 15, NATO integrated Operation Maritime Guard and Western European Union naval activities in the region into Operation Sharp Guard, and expanded its role to include greater enforcement powers. Growing role of air power 1994 On February 28, 1994, the scope of NATO involvement in Bosnia increased dramatically. In an incident near Banja Luka, NATO fighters operating under Deny Flight shot down four Serb jets. This was the first combat operation in the history of NATO and opened the door for a steadily growing NATO presence in Bosnia.Beale, Michael. Bombs over Bosnia: The Role of Airpower in Bosnia- Herzegovina. Air University Press, 1997. p. 2-3 In April, the presence of NATO airpower continued to grow during a Serb attack on Gora≈æde. In response, NATO launched its first close air support mission on April 10, 1994, bombing several Serb targets at the request of UN commanders. NATO launched several other limited air strikes throughout the year, not acting in coordination with the United Nations. Operations in 1995 and Operation Deliberate Force NATO continued its air operations over Bosnia in the first half of 1995. During this period, American pilot Scott O'Grady was shot down over Bosnia by a surface-to-air missile fired by Bosnian Serb soldiers. He was eventually rescued safely, but his downing caused concern in the United States and other NATO countries about NATO air superiority in Bosnia and prompted some calls for more aggressive NATO action to eliminate Serb anti-air capabilities. =Srebrenica and the London Conference= In July 1995, the Bosnian Serbs launched an attack on the Bosnian town of Srebrenica, ending with the deaths of approximately 8,000 civilians in the Srebrenica massacre. After the horrifying events at Srebrenica, 16 nations met at the London Conference, beginning on July 21, 1995, to consider new options for Bosnia. As a result of the conference, UN Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali gave General Bernard Janvier, the UN military commander, the authority to request NATO airstrikes without consulting civilian UN officials, as a way to streamline the process.Beale, Michael. Bombs over Bosnia: The Role of Airpower in Bosnia- Herzegovina. Air University Press, 1997. p. 34 As a result of the conference, the North Atlantic Council and the UN also agreed to use NATO air strikes in response to attacks on any of the other safe areas in Bosnia. The participants at the conference also agreed in principle to the use of large-scale NATO air strikes in response to future acts of aggression by Serbs.Bucknam, Mark. Responsibility of Command. Air University Press, 2003. p. 253 =Operation Deliberate Force= After the London Conference, NATO planned an aggressive new air campaign against the Bosnian Serbs. On August 28, 1995, Serb forces launched a mortar shell at the Sarajevo marketplace killing 37 people. Admiral Leighton Smith, the NATO commander recommended that NATO launch retaliatory air strikes under Operation Deliberate Force.Davis, Bradley. \\"The Planning Background\\". Deliberate Force. Air University Press, 2000. On August 30, 1995, NATO officially launched Operation Deliberate Force with large-scale bombing of Serb targets. The bombing lasted until September 20, 1995 and involved attacks on 338 individual targets. The Dayton Accords and IFOR Largely as a result of the bombing under Operation Deliberate Force and changes in the battlefield situation, the belligerents in the Bosnian War met in Dayton, Ohio in November 1995, and signed the Dayton Accords, a peace treaty. As part of the accords, NATO agreed to provide 60,000 peacekeepers for the region, as part of the Implementation Force (IFOR). In December 1995, under Operation Joint Endeavor, NATO deployed these forces. These forces remained deployed until December 1996, when those remaining in the region were transferred to the Stabilization Force (SFOR). SFOR peacekeepers remained in Bosnia until 2004.

After first serving in the Seven Years' War, he was the commander of the J√§ger corps of the Hessian Leib Infantry Regiment attached to British forces in the American Revolutionary War. He arrived with his troops, first serving in the Battle of White Plains in October 1776. He saw regular action until his capture at Yorktown in 1781. In 1788, he joined the Danish Army, where he rose to the rank of lieutenant general; he also served as governor general of Holstein during the Napoleonic Wars. Following his American war experiences, he wrote an Essay on Partisan Warfare (), a widely read treatise on guerrilla warfare. He also kept a journal during most of his time in North America that has since become a valuable resource for historians of the war. Seven Years' War Johann Ewald was born in Kassel, the capital city of the Landgraviate of Hesse-Kassel, on 30 March 1744. His father Georg Heinrich Ewald was a bookkeeper, and his mother, Katharina Elisabeth, was the daughter of a Kassel merchant.Ewald & Tustin, p. xxiv Both parents died while he was relatively young, and he was raised after their deaths by his grandmother. In an effort to dissuade the 14-year-old Ewald from a military career, he was taken to see the battlefield after the 23 July 1758 Battle of Sandershausen. Ewald's response to the scene was \\"Oh, how happy are they who died for their country in such a way!\\"Ewald & Tustin, p. xxv In 1760 Ewald enlisted in the Regiment Gilsa, and was immediately involved in combat. Serving first in the army of Duke Ferdinand of Brunswick, the regiment saw action at Corbach and Warburg before besieging Kassel in 1761, then held by the French. Ewald was wounded during this siege in March 1761, and was promoted to ensign for his bravery. Returning to action in June, his regiment saw further action in 1761 and 1762, notably at Wilhelmstal and the second Siege of Cassel in 1762. Peace After the Seven Years' War ended, Ewald remained with the regiment, now reduced. He was transferred to the guards, where he was promoted to second lieutenant in 1766. In 1769 he was transferred to the Leib Regiment after the Landgrave, Frederick II, decreed that only nobles could serve in the guards. On 20 February 1770, after an evening of drinking, Ewald got into an argument with a friend. In the ensuing duel, Ewald was struck in the left eye, and very nearly died. According to Ewald, the landgrave refused to punish him for this (even though it took more than a year to recover from the injury), saying \\"When a horse has run out of the stable, one closes the door\\".Ewald & Tustin, p. xxvi Ewald from then on wore a glass eye that caused him some discomfort. Ewald enrolled in the Collegium Carolinum, where he studied military theory and economics. As a result of these studies, Ewald published his first treatise in 1774, dedicated to Frederick II: Gedanken eines hessischen Officiers √ºber das, was man bey F√ºhrung eines Detaschements im Felde zu thun hat (Thoughts of a Hessian officer about what he has to do when leading a detachment in the field). Ewald was also promoted to captain in 1774, the last promotion he would receive in the Kassel service.Ewald & Tustin, p. xxvii War in America1776-1778: New York, New Jersey, and Philadelphia= Ewald's map depicting the Battle of Bound Brook In late 1775 Frederick II signed an agreement with King George III of Great Britain to supply him with troops for use in North America in suppressing the rebellion that had broken out in the Thirteen Colonies. The troops supplied by Frederick included the Leib Regiment, and Ewald arrived in New York City in October 1776. Sent forward to New Rochelle, his j√§ger company was given a lead position in the army of General William Howe, and was first engaged in the 28 October Battle of White Plains. His position in the advance became quite normal for his company, which was consequently often engaged in skirmishes and the leading edges of battles. Ewald served with some distinction in the New Jersey and Philadelphia campaigns, where he was involved in (among others) battles at Mount Holly,Ewald & Tustin, p. 39 Brandywine, and Germantown. On the direction of General Charles Cornwallis, Ewald developed a plan of attack against a Continental Army position at Bound Brook, New Jersey in March 1777. In the April battle, the Continentals were surprised, and their commander, Benjamin Lincoln, narrowly avoided capture.Ewald & Tustin, pp. 55-56 During the Philadelphia campaign, Ewald's j√§gers were also involved in the Battle of Red Bank. They covered the retreat after the Hessian Brigadier General Carl von Donop's disastrous attempt to take the fort by assault was repulsed, killing Donop and a number of his officers, including some that Ewald considered friends. Ewald analyzed the debacle in his journal, pointing out that the garrison should not have been summoned to surrender (removing the element of surprise), and that the main thrust of the attack was misplaced.Ewald & Tustin, p. 102 Ewald's unit was involved in many of the minor engagements during the occupation of Philadelphia, and was almost constantly engaging the Americans during the British march across New Jersey. Ewald noted of that march, \\"One can truly state that this march cost two thousand men.\\"Ewald & Tustin, pp. 139 =1779-1781: New York, Charleston, and Virginia= In 1779 Ewald's company was involved in British operations to capture key American defenses at Stony Point, New York. It was not involved in the American response, a raid by Brigadier General Anthony Wayne that captured more than half the British garrison. Most of 1779 was spent on guard duty, until December, when his unit, specifically requested by Generals Clinton and Cornwallis, was selected for the expedition to take Charleston, South Carolina. His company was again in the vanguard on the march from the landing place to the city. At one point he used a ruse to reconnoiter an enemy position on the Stono River. After waving his handkerchief, he approached an enemy outpost, and inquired whether the unit, which he ascertained to be Pulaski's Legion, had a supposed acquaintance of his serving in it. During the conversation he carefully noted the surrounding features, before returning to his unit. This action drew praise from General Clinton.Ewald & Tustin, p. 199 After the successful siege, Ewald's company returned to New York with General Clinton, leaving Cornwallis the task of taking control of South Carolina. He spent the remainder of 1780 on guard duty around New York, until he learned in December that his company had been chosen to be part of Benedict Arnold's expedition to Virginia. Landing in Virginia on 31 December 1780, the expedition moved up the James River, Ewald's company and the Queen's Rangers of John Graves Simcoe in the lead, and raided Richmond on 5 January 1781. The force then made its way to Portsmouth, destroying military and economic targets along the way. Ewald's company reached Portsmouth on 19 January, and began the task of fortifying the town. The arrival of a small French fleet in the area was accompanied by a flurry of defensive activity, but the French left without taking any action. Rumors of French and American forces (both land and naval) to attack the position led Arnold to order additional work to fortify the Portsmouth area against possible attacks. When French ships were again sighted (probably consequent to the 16 March Battle of Cape Henry), tensions rose again in the town, and Ewald was wounded in the knee during a patrol on 19 March.Ewald & Tustin, p. 290 At the time, a small detachment of Ewald's j√§gers was apparently the only force providing defense against a large detachment of American militia on the far side of a creek. Arnold's failure to mention the j√§gers' valor in holding off this force rankled Ewald, and he complained of it to the commander. Arnold ensured that recognition of their work was given that evening.Ewald & Tustin, p. 291 The French flag sighted turned out to have been a false flag; the ships had in fact been British, and were followed on 31 March by the arrival of more than 2,000 men under the command of William Phillips. While Ewald recuperated from his injury at Norfolk, Phillips led the combined forces on further raids into Virginia. His forces were eventually taken over by General Cornwallis, who joined his southern army with then at Petersburg in May. On 29 May, General Alexander Leslie arrived in Portsmouth to take command of the establishment. Feeling recovered from his injury, Ewald requested and received permission to rejoin his unit with Cornwallis's army. He was with that force through its movements in Virginia. During the later stages of these movements, Ewald's unit was often detached along with Simcoe's on foraging and raiding expeditions. On the morning of 26 June, Simcoe's force was resting before rejoining Cornwallis in Williamsburg, when it was surprised by an advance company of Americans. These were from a larger detachment of the Marquis de Lafayette's army led by General Wayne that was chasing after Simcoe, hoping to bring him to an engagement. The resulting battle was somewhat confused, and both sides broke off the battle, fearing the supporting force of the other was near. Ewald, as soon as the alarm was raised, coolly organized his j√§gers in a position to attack the American flank. The British eventually withdrew, only to meet Cornwallis and his advance units a few miles down the road.Ewald & Tustin, pp. 308-312 Although Ewald was not involved in the Battle of Green Spring that attended the British army's crossing of the James River on 6 July, he was with the army when it arrived at Yorktown. As the American and French forces began to concentrate around them, Ewald and his j√§gers continued to be on the edges, making forage raids and skirmishing with the enemy; however, sickness took its toll on his unit. He reported on 18 September that his unit had shrunk to 29 men, half of whom were sick.Ewald & Tustin, p. 328 As the siege neared its end, Cornwallis released all of the former slaves that had accompanied his army, intending to force them to become a burden on the Americans. However, Ewald recounts making a patrol into the no mans land between the two forces, and having to force groups of those unfortunates to move further toward the American lines.Ewald & Tustin, p. 336 Following the British surrender, Ewald returned to New York on parole. His depression over the circumstances was lifted by a letter from Frederick II, specifically citing Ewald for \\"fine conduct\\" and rewarded him with \\"my extraordinary satisfaction and the assurance of my entirely special favore and grace.\\"Ewald & Tustin, p. 345 Ewald spent 1782 and 1783 with the rest of the j√§ger corps on Long Island. Sickness acquired in the south recurred, and he was eventually released from his parole as part of a prisoner exchange. However, the war was effectively at an end, with peace concluded in September 1783. In October of that year, Ewald left New York with a friend to visit West Point, due to its reputation as the most important American stronghold of the war.Ewald & Tustin, p. 351 General Henry Knox graciously allowed them access, and had his adjutant show them around. On 21 November, the j√§ger corps was among the last units to leave New York. On 22 April 1784, Ewald returned to Kassel.Ewald & Tustin, p. 361 Service with Denmark On his return, Ewald was reassigned to the Regiment von Dittfurth. Over the next year, he worked on another military treatise, Abhandlung √ºber den kleinen Krieg (Essay on partisan warfare), that was published in 1785. Upon the death of Frederick II, William IX ordered Ewald to reform the Hesse-Hanau j√§ger force. In 1787 Ewald, still a captain, was passed over for promotion. The officers promoted ahead of him were nobles, and the indignity led him to request a release from service so that he might pursue opportunities for advancement elsewhere. William's brother Charles recommended Ewald for service in Denmark, where he had been raised. In August 1788, Ewald departed for Denmark with his new bride, Susanne. Ewald was hopeful for action, as there were rumors that Denmark would be drawn into the war just begun between Russia and Sweden.Ewald & Tustin, p. xxvii Ewald was commissioned a lieutenant colonel in the Danish army, and authorized to raise a corps of j√§gers in the Duchy of Schleswig, then a Danish territory. He was given command of a light infantry battalion in 1790, and also raised to the Danish nobility. In 1795 he was promoted to colonel, with a promotion to major general following in 1802. In 1801 he commanded the Danish occupying forces in Hamburg and L√ºbeck, where he was so well liked by the citizenry that they invited him to become their civil governor; he declined.Ewald & Tustin, p. xxviii By 1803, the Napoleonic Wars began to threaten Denmark, which had remained neutral. Ewald was again in the vanguard of the military forces, responsible for the defense of the Duchy of Holstein, which represented Denmark's southern frontier. In 1806, after the Prussian loss to French forces in the Battle of L√ºbeck, Prussian forces attempted to cross the border to escape the French. The French, believing they had done so, demanded the right to cross the border in pursuit. Ewald, in a bold bid to speak directly with the French commander, Joachim Murat, jumped a horse over a ditch and convinced a French officer to bring him to Murat. Murat refused to believe Ewald's assertion that Prussians had not crossed the border, and threatened to kill him. Murat also refused to give Ewald an escort back to his own lines; Ewald had some difficult returning due to the unsettled conditions in the area. The incident resulted in the removal of French forces from Danish territory. Napoleon also insured that Danish neutrality was respected.Ewald & Tustin, p. xxix Danish neutrality did not last much longer. In 1807 the British launched a preemptive strike against Copenhagen, driving Crown Prince Frederick into alliance with the French. Danish plans to attack Sweden during the winter of 1808-1809 were not realized due to bad weather; Ewald was to have been in the vanguard. Frederick, who ascended to the throne in 1809, awarded Ewald with the Grand Cross of the Order of Dannebrog. In May 1809 Ewald and a Danish corps were sent to assist in putting down a revolt in Swedish Pomerania. Combined with Dutch forces, the revolt was put down in the decisive Battle of Stralsund; the rebel leader, Ferdinand von Schill, was killed by a Danish soldier. Ewald's performance in the battle was lauded: Frederick promoted him to lieutenant general, and he was awarded the Dutch Order of the Union and the French Legion of Honor.Ewald & Tustin, p. xxx Ewald continued to serve in command of Danish forces stationed in Schleswig- Holstein, but saw no further action. In 1812 King Frederick awarded him the Order of Dannebrog. Ewald retired in May 1813, suffering from dropsy. He died in Kiel on 25 June, surrounded by his wife, son, and five daughters. He was buried four days later. The cemetery in Kiel where he was interred was destroyed by Allied bombing during World War II. Legacy Ewald's son Carl also served in the Danish military, rising to the rank of major general. In addition to numerous treatises on military tactics, Ewald kept a journal during his service in North America. The diary was a four volume bound edition prepared by Ewald for his heirs in 1798. Joseph Tustin acquired three of the four volumes in the aftermath of World War II, and spent many years searching for the missing third volume. Although he believes it to have been destroyed, he did acquire a copy of the third volume's text, made from a copy of the original in the possession of the heirs of the Schleswig-Holstein nobility.Ewald & Tustin, p. xiv Tustin describes the diary as \\"the most important and comprehensive diary kept by a Hessian mercenary.\\"Ewald & Tustin, p. xiii Notes References  * *German biography of Ewald Category:1744 births Category:1813 deaths Category:Hessian military personnel of the American Revolutionary War Category:Danish military commanders of the Napoleonic Wars Category:Danish generals Category:Recipients of the Legion of Honour Category:People from the Landgraviate of Hesse-Kassel Category:Grand Crosses of the Order of the Dannebrog ","title":"Johann Ewald"},{"id":"21711097","text":"Lynn or Lynne is a predominantly feminine given name in English-speaking countries.

He was the son of Giuseppe Ceruti and grandson to Giovanni Battista Ceruti. He was also an active dealer of fine old instruments dealing with Luigi Tarisio and Jean- Baptiste Vuillaume among others. Being 3rd generation violin maker, he learned his trade from his father Giuseppe, and was a double bass player as well, like his father. Left the family home in 1826, and records show that by 1830 was registered as a violin maker, although few instruments from before 1840 survive. Experts speculate that it is conceivable that Enrico was working with his father during the period of 1840s-1850s and it would explain the extreme rarity of instruments made by Giuseppe dating from that period. At a time when best European makers were imitating Stradivari and Guarneri del Gesu, Enrico followed a different path. Enrico's work shows that he drew much of his inspiration from the Bergonzis. Enrico exhibited his instruments in various European cities, but his work does not seem to have been greatly appreciated outside Italy. As a result, he had not attained any great wealth. His students include Gaetano Antoniazzi. Quotes \\"Ceruti Dynasty carried on the tradition from the times of Storioni and Bergonzi's - and became the direct link to the 20th century makers.

The film's sets were designed by the art director Scott MacGregor. Plot The film starts just after the Battle of El Alamein somewhere in North Africa. British troops train in enemy plane and ship recognition. They train to operate an inflatable dinghy and are then taken by submarine to an Adriatic island. After setting up camp they discover that the island is the base for a small unit of Germans when one of the British soldiers bumps into a German soldier while both are bathing nude in the sea. The British soldiers hunt for the Germans and find a former monastery where they are surprised by a German officer. He explains that his group were guarding stores for re-supplying German submarines but have been forgotten by their superiors and offers to share his supplies and accommodation if the British will agree to a truce. The British soldiers return to their camp to consider the offer and eventually agree to accept when they realise that their food and water are about to run out. They join the Germans at the monastery but both the British NCO Bolter and the German NCO Meister disagree. The two sides live harmoniously and even find mutual interests, with Finch befriending a German archaeologist and helping on an archaeological dig. One day, while sunbathing, the British officer Brown sees a woman, Elsa, in the sea clinging to some wreckage. He is unable to swim and calls to his men to help him but they ignore his calls. Eventually he jumps in the sea but has to be rescued by the woman. The soldiers talk to her and discover that she is Serbian and doesn't understand English, French or German. Finally Finch tries Italian and is able to communicate with her. Much hilarity ensues as the soldiers vie for her attention. The two NCOs are still suspicious and eventually leave the monastery for a fist fight. When they are too exhausted to continue they realise that they both agree that their duty as a soldier is to return to their own army so that they can continue fighting. They agree to take the inflatable dinghy and return to the war. However they are unable to overcome the current and are forced to return to the island. When the British are eventually rescued by submarine they ask to take Elsa with them and she gladly joins Finch. The Germans are rescued by submarine shortly afterwards and resign themselves to being transferred to the Eastern Front.

A local road () in Ireland is a public road not classified as a national primary road, national secondary road, or regional road but nevertheless forming a link in the national network of roads. Local roads are numbered with four- or five-digit route numbers, prefixed by \\"L\\" (for example, L3005 or L97476). History Until 1977, roads in Ireland were designated with one of two prefixes: \\"T\\" for trunk roads and \\"L\\" for link roads. Older signs showing the former trunk and link road designations may still be seen in some locations. The L- prefix for \\"link road\\" on these signs does not stand for \\"local road\\". The Local Government (Roads and Motorways) Act, 1974 Local Government (Roads and Motorways) Act, 1974 authorised the designation of roads as national roads: in 1977, 25 national primary roads (N1‚ÄìN25) and 33 national secondary roads (N51‚ÄìN83) were initially designated under Statutory Instrument S.I. No. 164/1977.Statutory Instrument S.I. No. 164/1977 Many of the remaining classified roads became regional roads (formally authorised under the Roads Act 1993, Roads Act 1993 route numbers having been present on road signs on a non-statutory basis for some years previously) and their routes were designated under a Statutory Instrument in 1994. All other public roads, except motorways, became local roads under the 1993 Act which states that \\"a public road, other than a national road or a regional road, shall be a local road\\". Local roads vary greatly in quality, from wide urban streets to very narrow, rural lanes, known as boreens in Ireland. There are three types of local road: local primary (local roads wider than four metres), local secondary (local roads narrower than four metres) and local tertiary (cul-de-sacs and other minor roads). Local roads are subject to a general speed limit of 80 kilometres per hour (km/h) or 50 km/h in built-up areas. These roads, with sharp turns and low visibility, barely wide enough for two cars to pass each other, have the same speed limit as many sections of dual carriageways, with physical segregation of and multiple lanes for each direction, only very light turns and excellent visibility. Local road numbering R747 regional road at Lackareagh, County Wicklow. The Roads Act 1993 gives local authorities the duty to \\"assign a number or other identifying mark to each local road in respect of which it has responsibility\\". Local road numbers have been used for administrative purposes since the Act came into effect, but local road numbers did not generally appear on directional signposts until the late 2000s. Most road-maps do not show local road numbers, although some are marked on OpenStreetMap. Local roads are classified by the road authority for the area as local primary, local secondary or local tertiary roads. The local primary roads are numbered from L1000 - L4999. Local secondary roads are numbered from L5000 - L8999. Local tertiary roads are numbered from L10001 - L89999, with the first four digits representing the local primary or secondary road to which it is connected. Local tertiary roads which are unrelated to a local primary or secondary road are numbered from L90000 upwards. Local roads are divided into segments of two to three kilometres maximum. For this reason they serve a limited function as the applicable L road number generally ends at junctions with other local roads. The numbering systems are not widely known to the public, however, they must be made available to the public on request in accordance with section 10 of the Roads Act 1993. Unlike national and regional roads in Ireland, local road numbers are unique within each administrative county, but are not unique nationwide. For example, there is an L1001 in Kilcroney, Bray, another in Inch, County Wexford, another L1001 in County Limerick and a fourth in County Longford. There are various unrelated roads numbered L1002 across County Kildare, County Meath, and County Wexford.OpenStreetMap See also *Roads in Ireland *Roads in Northern Ireland *Motorways in the Republic of Ireland *History of Roads in Ireland *Trunk Roads in Ireland *Transport in Ireland ReferencesCitationsSources= * ","title":"Local roads in Ireland"},{"id":"21711319","text":"is the twelfth main game of the Touhou Project scrolling shooter series. Made by the d≈çjin game maker Team Shanghai Alice, the full version of the game was released in the 76th Comiket on August 15, 2009, followed by the retail release on September 11, 2009. Gameplay Undefined Fantastic Object features three playable characters (Reimu, Marisa and Sanae), each with two weapon types. However, unlike Mountain of Faith and Subterranean Animism, the spell card (bombing) system from the older games (such as Perfect Cherry Blossom and Imperishable Night) has been reintroduced. Point value penalties for dying have also been removed. There are 4 levels of difficulty: Easy, Normal, Hard, and Lunatic. Each difficulty level features differences in the number of bullets fired by each enemy, rate of fire, variations in the bullets' pattern of movement, and the number and type of enemy Spell Cards used. A character's \\"shot\\" is the player's primary method of attacking enemies. The shot's attack area and behavior vary depending on the character and attack type the player has chosen. Like previous Touhou games, there is a line most of the way up the screen called the point of collection. If a character is moved on or above this line, all items on the screen will be drawn to that character. Unlike previous games, it is not necessary to have full power or focus to use the POC because it is always available. Grazing is the act of positioning the character's hitbox close to the bullets without getting hit. Similar to its older games, grazing is one of the most effective ways to rake in high scores‚Äîif done accurately and effectively. For every 10 bullets grazed, the point item value increases by 10 points. Grazing also works during invincibility periods, such as resurrection or bombing, unless the bullets have been destroyed. While grazing in the short term is minimal, it can boost point item totals by a large scale. Being able to calculate remaining point items in the entire game ahead of time is a rare mathematical feat, but it helps to determine whether or not grazing is worth it in certain situations. Undefined Fantastic Object re-introduces bombs with distinctive visual styles that differ between characters, and even between shot types for the same character. A character's \\"bomb\\" is the player's limited-use method of getting out of difficult situations. A bomb's attack area, duration, and power vary depending on the character type and attack type the player has chosen. It typically deals heavy damage to every enemy it touches, in addition to canceling out any bullets in the bomb's way. The player's character becomes invincible during the bomb's use and for a short time after the bomb's effect wears off. At the beginning of the game (and any time the character revives), the player starts off with 2 bombs. The player can increase their bomb Stock by collecting bomb pieces (3 are needed for a bomb) or bomb items. Green UFOs drop a bomb piece when defeated, and a full bomb when their score multiplier is full. The player can carry up to a maximum of 8 bombs at a time. If the player receives a bomb when they already have the maximum, that bomb will be lost. Unlike previous games, if the player loses a life, the bomb counter only resets to default value of 2 if the player has less than 2 bombs‚Äîwhich means the player can always utilize all of their accumulated bombs. Also, unlike every Windows game up to Subterranean Animism, bombing does not auto-collect every item on screen. Some enemies will have small green UFOs circling above them. They drop a small UFO after being destroyed, and some stage mid-bosses will drop 2 small UFOs after their final attack is defeated. The small UFO will fly around the screen. They come in red, blue and green colours. There are two types, blinking and non-blinking. The blinking UFO will change colours every few seconds. However, keeping the character's sprite in close proximity to the UFO will prevent it from changing colors. The other type of UFO will stay a single colour. These non-blinking UFOs are not random, so their positions in the levels can be memorized to further advantages. Collecting three UFO items causes a large UFO enemy to appear on the screen. Three of a specific colour of UFO will summon a big UFO of that colour, while collecting one of each will summon a flashing big UFO. If the player has picked up two UFO items of the same colour and then picks up an item of a different colour, the first item in line will be replaced by the colour of the item picked up last. If the player has two UFOs, a UFO of the color that will result in summoning a large UFO will be surrounded by a flashing pentagon so the player knows what type to collect without having to look at the bottom-left corner. Each summoned UFO has a life bar and timer for how long the player has to defeat it. At about two seconds left on the timer, the UFO will start ascending to leave the screen; it is important to defeat it before it leaves. Otherwise, all the items it has sucked in will be lost. If the UFO is on the screen at same time with a boss, it will fly away even if there is time left; however, in the case of mid-bosses, the UFO will stop flying away if the boss is defeated in time. In-game dialog will make summoned UFOs explode. Plot Throughout Gensokyo, rumors have been spreading since early spring about a strange, flying, treasure ship. With the help of Sanae Kochiya, the girls take off to Gensokyo to find the ship and plunder its treasures. During the high- speed chase of the \\"UFO\\", the player confronts Nazrin, who has come from the flying object looking for something in particular. She insists the ship does not exist. The player then encounters Kogasa Tatara, whose only purpose is to frighten the girls away. As the player catches up with the ship, Ichirin Kumoi and her familiar Unzan appear, complaining about fairies and humans who have been pestering them. She says the \\"ship\\" is actually a remodeled building that has given the power to fly. Ichirin Kumoi also says she is trying to revive someone. The fragments‚Äîthe UFOs that the player has been collecting‚Äîare necessary for this purpose, but rather than handing them over, the player defeats the pair and enters the ship. Inside, the player finds a strange, flying object that promptly attacks and leaves items. Ignoring this, the player finds Captain Murasa, the youkai ghost captain of the ship. She tells the player the ship is heading for Hokkai, a world connected to Gensokyo that is located on the outer edges of Makai. Because the player entered the ship with enough fragments in their possession, it has already begun to enter Hokkai. Before long, just outside Hokkai, the player again encounters Nazrin, who has found what she was looking for‚Äîthe Vaisravana pagoda. After defeating her a second time, Shou Toramaru appears. Now the pagoda and the fragments are together, the revival can begin. Shou tells the player they are trying to revive a \\"saint\\" who has been sealed for many years‚Äîa person who was punished for helping humans and youkai. After defeating Shou, the player chooses to help revive this person. The final confrontation happens deep inside Hokkai, where Byakuren Hijiri has been unsealed. The player must exterminate youkai (or, in Marisa's case, to prioritize protecting humans). Byakuren disagrees‚Äîshe is an ally to both and treats both equally. The player defeats Byakuren in a long battle, and the story ends on peaceful terms as she and Murasa cruise around Gensokyo in the ship before settling down and rebuilding Byakuren's original temple. However, the mystery of the UFOs is still solved. Upon opening one of them, Marisa discovers a snake and the UFO turns into a piece of wood. The girls take off once again into the night sky to investigate. Kogasa reappears, trying to surprise the player. The strange flying object appears again and transforms into a youkai named Nue Houjuu, who disguised the fragments. Only the player saw the UFOs as UFOs‚Äîthe enemies the player fought against knew they were actually pieces of the ship. After defeating Nue Houjuu, she says she was originally trying to obfuscate Murasa's efforts to revive Byakuren, but the player caught her interest so she helped the player too. Characters Playable characters: *Reimu Hakurei - The miko of the Hakurei Shrine. She sets out to investigate the treasure ship thinking it is yet again the work of y≈çkai. *Marisa Kirisame - A magician who lives in the Forest of Magic. She seeks the treasure ship simply because it piqued her curiosity. *Sanae Kotiya - The wind priestess of Moriya Shrine who is playable for the first time in Touhou. She is still adjusting to life in Gensokyo, and tries to prove herself by setting out to find the treasure ship under the orders of the goddesses she serves. Bosses; *Nazrin („Éä„Ç∫„Éº„É™„É≥): Stage 1 boss and stage 5 mid-boss. Being a leader of mice and a natural dowser, Nazrin was commanded by Ichirin to search for the shards that fell from the sky, but her dowsing rods brought her to the humans instead. *Kogasa Tatara (Â§ö„ÄÖËâØ Â∞èÂÇò): Stage 2 boss and extra stage mid-boss. Kogasa was once an umbrella who was forgotten for a long time and thus became a kasa-obake. Being bored and lonely, she tries to perfect the art of scaring humans. *Ichirin Kumoi (Èõ≤Â±Ö ‰∏ÄËº™): Ichirin is the stage 3 boss who is accompanied by Unzan, who also participates in battle. Ichirin, by her own accord, is the guard of the large ship in the sky. She seems to be collecting UFO-shaped shards to revive Byakuren Hiziri, her master, whom she refers to as \\"sister.\\" *Unzan (Èõ≤Â±±): Ichirin's companion in stage 3. Unzan is a ny≈´d≈ç made out of clouds. He is a stubborn, quiet old man who is gentle at heart. *Minamitsu Murasa (ÊùëÁ¥ó Ê∞¥Ëúú): Murasa is the stage 4 boss, who is a funay≈´rei - a spirit of a human who fell off a ship and drowned in the past. As the humans feared her, their fears turned her into a y≈çkai. She pledged herself to saving Byakuren, riding the ship she created. *Shou Toramaru (ÂØÖ‰∏∏ Êòü): Shou is the stage 5 boss, representing good fortune as an avatar of Bishamonten. She was chosen by Byakuren to have the mountain y≈çkai gather faith in exchange. When Byakuren disappeared after a few hundred years, the temple was in great disarray, and all of her friends who were sealed into the Earth returned. Shou, not wanting to run away or have any regrets, told Murasa and the others how to lift the seal. *Byakuren Hiziri (ËÅñ ÁôΩËìÆ): Byakuren is the stage 6 boss. She had a younger brother, Myouren Hiziri, who taught her Buddhist magic, but died earlier than her. This made Byakuren fear death greatly, and obtained the power to regain her youth. However, it was considered black magic rather than an art of Buddhism. Ichirin was her servant, while Murasa pledged herself to saving Byakuren. *Nue Houjuu (Â∞ÅÁç£ „Å¨„Åà): Nue is the extra stage boss, also appearing as a sphere of light in stages 4 and 6. She is a nue- a very mysterious y≈çkai who flies through the night sky. Despite being non-human, she was defeated by humans many times in the past, but the accounts of her appearance vary. However, those were all made up, because her form is never seen to anybody but herself. She merely enjoys frightening humans and their imagining of strange things from afar.

It was designed by George St Paul Connolly of the Colonial Architect's Office and built in 1880 by Southall & Tracey. It is also known as Bowen Court House. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992. The courthouse was completed in 1881 in the Classical Revival style. It is a two- storey building and was constructed in rendered brick with a corrugated iron roof. It is still in use today and contains most of the original furniture and features.  History  The Bowen Court House is a substantial masonry building in Classical Revival style, prominently located on the corner of Herbert and Williams Streets, Bowen. It was built in 1880 to house the Northern Supreme Court, the Bowen Post Office and Government Offices. Since 1899 it has functioned as a District and Magistrates court. In 1859 prior to the separation of Queensland, the Government of New South Wales commissioned Captain H.D. Sinclair to find a suitable site for a port to support the pastoral development of the Kennedy district. He selected a place on Port Denison, an inlet of the Coral Sea, although Queensland became a separate colony before settlement took place there. The new township, designated a Port of Entry, was formally established on 12 April 1861 and named after Sir George Ferguson Bowen, first Governor of Queensland. The first pastoral run in the area, Strathmore, was taken up in the same year by the Cunningham family who were quickly followed by other graziers eager to establish grazing properties. A Police Magistrate was appointed to serve Bowen in late 1860 and a temporary courthouse was constructed. Bowen soon became a major administrative and commercial centre and was declared a municipality (the Borough of Bowen) on 17 March 1863 in the courthouse. This was merely a small slab hut without a verandah and which was not weather proof. After local agitation, tenders for a Court House were called in October 1864, though a building was not constructed. Two other northern ports were established in 1864, at Cardwell and Townsville. In Nov 1865, Bowen became a District Court area. Judge Joseph Innes, later to become Attorney General and Judge of the Supreme Court of New South Wales, was appointed as Bowen's first District Court Judge. He arrived in early 1866 and held court in the Municipal Chambers. Because of the financial crisis taking place in Queensland in 1866, the planned courthouse did not go forward and in early 1867, the judge made unauthorised changes to the court house to improve conditions. In 1874, recognising the rapid development of North Queensland, due largely to the discovery of gold, the Supreme Court Act increased the number of judges in Queensland to 4, of which 1 was to reside in Bowen as \\"the Northern Judge\\". The Bowen Supreme Court formally opened before His Honour Mr Justice Edmund Sheppard on 21 Oct 1874. The Supreme Court first sat in Townsville on 12 Feb 1875, Bowen 26 Feb 1875, and Cooktown 29 May 1876. Queensland developed as a series of ports linked to inland resources. Bowen was disadvantaged, despite its excellent harbour, because it was located on a flood plain and the Burdekin River flooded regularly, cutting off the port from the hinterland for extended periods. Bowen's importance decreased in the 1870s following the success of Townsville, which had better access routes to pastoral mining and centres, particularly the major goldfields at Charters Towers and the Palmer River. By May 1877, all the government buildings in Bowen had become dilapidated and it was recommended that it would be more economic in the long term, allowing for the tropical climate, to construct new buildings in masonry. The site selected for the new court was considered the best in town and plans were completed by July 1879. Presumably for reasons of economy, the new building was to house several different functions in different parts of the building. A large court room occupied the centre of the building, rising to its full height The south wing was occupied by the Post Master, the ground floor containing the office, kitchen and servant's room, and the upper floor sitting and bedrooms. The lower floor of the north wing was designed to house officials of the Supreme Court, and the upper floor was shared by the Survey and Roads offices, with bedrooms for Court Officials. Bowen Courthouse, 1894 The building was designed in the Colonial Architect's office during the time when FDG Stanley was the Colonial Architect. Within the office, the design of the building is attributed to GS Connolly, who later became Colonial Architect himself. Both architects excelled in the classical revival style chosen, which was thought well suited to public buildings intended to convey a sense of stability and dignity, particularly a court which represented the power of the law. The building is on a corner site and designed so that the major street elevations each represented a separate function housed within the building; that to Herbert Street representing the Court and that to Williams Street the Post Office. The two elevations are linked stylistically by the use of arcades. The tender of builders Southall and Tracey for was accepted and work was completed by July 1881. The old court buildings were sold in 1884. Soon after this, however, the pre-eminence of Townsville as the major town in North Queensland was recognised in the 1889 the Supreme Court Bill which provided for the appointment of a second northern judge and the relocation of the Northern Supreme Court to Townsville. This occurred on 1 December 1899, although Townsville did not have a purpose-designed court house. Since this time the Bowen Court House has functioned as a District and Magistrate's Court. The building remained substantially unchanged for many years, apart from some minor additions and alterations. A verandah was added to the north-west elevation in 1913, and the balustrades and posts have been altered. It underwent a $4 million refurbishment in November 2004. The work included the installation of an additional courtroom, closed-circuit television, a lift and videoconferencing technology. The refurbishments were completed in late 2006.  Description  The Bowen Court House is a two-storey classical revival building constructed of rendered brick, with a corrugated galvanised iron roof. It is located on the corner of Williams and Herbert Street, the main street of Bowen, and addresses both streets with major facades. The building is \\"H\\" shaped in plan, with a small single story projection to the east corner which was originally a kitchen and bedroom. The wings are now occupied by offices and the court room is in the centre section, rising through both stories with a mezzanine level public gallery at the south east end. The walls of the court room are rendered and scored up to a moulded plaster dado, and have painted brickwork above. The ceiling is lined with beaded tongue and groove boards divided by exposed stop-chamfered beams, with turned knobs at the intersections. The space has 4 pane, horizontally pivoting windows to the upper section and large double hung windows with arched heads in the lower section. Centred on each long side of the court are pairs of four-panel entry doors. The furniture of the court room includes the bench, jury benches, press box and dock all constructed from beaded tongue and groove boarding, and a silky oak witness stand. The upper level offices have ripple iron ceilings, moulded timber architraves and chimney pieces. The internal doors are four- panelled with toplights and glazed french doors with toplights open onto the verandahs. There is a timber staircase with turned balusters in the north-west block, and a similar new stair in the south-east block. Ceilings in the lower level are fibrous plaster or masonite with cover strips. The south-east verandah has masonry arches, infilled with cast iron panels, and a timber floor. The north-west verandah is timber, with a timber balustrade and lattice, and weatherboard toilet rooms at the northern corner.  Heritage listing  Bowen Court House has been listed by the National Trust of Queensland and the Australian Heritage Commission. Bowen Court House was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 21 October 1992 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. The Bowen Court House is important in demonstrating the early prominence of Bowen, being considerably more grand than other early courts at Townsville and Charters Towers; both of which towns were to eclipse Bowen. As the first Supreme Court outside Brisbane, it also illustrates the way in which a legal system was established and government services provided in the developing north of the colony. The inclusion of a second function as a Post Office indicates both the need for economy and the importance given to the role of communications services. The place demonstrates rare, uncommon or endangered aspects of Queensland's cultural heritage. The court house remains substantially unchanged since completion and retains the major components of its original furniture, which is now rare. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a particular class of cultural places. The building is a good example of a government building of its era with offices and accommodation provided for judges and court officers and for other government officials. The place is important because of its aesthetic significance. Bowen Court House is an important component of the streetscape of Bowen. It is a well designed and prominent public building and an excellent example of the high quality work produced by the Colonial Architects office. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. It is associated with the life and work of GS Connolly (1847-1901) and FDG Stanley (1839-1897) of the Colonial Architects office who made a great contribution to the building of Queensland.

He did not miss a single bout in his 22-year professional career, and holds the record for the most consecutive matches fought, at 1630. After his retirement from active competition he was an elder of the Japan Sumo Association and a coach. Career He made his debut in March 1964, joining Nishonoseki stable. He reached the top makuuchi division for the first time in January 1975. In only his fourth top division tournament he was a tournament runner-up, won a sansh≈ç (for Fighting Spirit) and earned a kinboshi for defeating a yokozuna. He was never to achieve any of those things again, but he fought in the top division for 62 tournaments in total. He made his san'yaku debut in September 1975 at komusubi and in October of that year he followed the former ≈çzeki Daikirin to the newly established Oshiogawa stable. He dropped into the j≈´ry≈ç division in 1981, but fought his way back, and an 8-7 score at maegashira 1 in May 1983 took him to his highest rank of sekiwake, which he held for just one tournament. This was his second and final appearance in the san'yaku ranks, 47 tournaments after his first - the longest such gap since the six tournaments per year schedule began in 1958. It had also taken him 116 tournaments from his professional debut to reach sekiwake, which is the slowest ever. In 1985 he surpassed Fujizakura's record of 1543 consecutive career appearances, and when he retired in July 1986, having not missed any matches since his debut, he had set a new record of 1630 consecutive bouts. He was nearly 38 years old, having been an active wrestler for over 22 years. Retirement from sumo After retirement from active competition he became an elder in the Japan Sumo Association (at Deputy Director level) under the name Shiranui Oyakata. He coached at the Oshiogawa and Oguruma stables and reached the Sumo Association's mandatory retirement age of 65 in November 2013.

La Follette, Jr., the sons of the famous Wisconsin Governor and Senator Robert M. La Follette, Sr.. The party was established in 1934 as an alliance between the longstanding \\"Progressive\\" faction of the Republican Party of Wisconsin, led by the La Follette family and their political allies, and certain radical farm and labor groups active in Wisconsin at the time.Wisconsin Progressive Party The Historical Marker Database The party served as a vehicle for Philip to run for re-election as Governor of Wisconsin and for Robert to run for re-election to the United States Senate. Both men were successful in their bids, and the party saw a number of other victories as well in the 1934 and 1936 election, notably winning several U.S. House seats and a majority of the Wisconsin State Senate and Wisconsin State Assembly in 1936. Their grip on power was short-lived, however, and they succumbed to a united Democratic and Republican front in 1938 which swept most of them out of office, including Philip. They were further crippled that year by attempting to expand the party to the national level. Orland Steen Loomis was the last Progressive to be elected Governor of Wisconsin, in the 1942 election. He died, however, before his inauguration as governor. Robert La Follette Jr. held on to his Senate seat until 1946, when the La Follettes decided to disband the party. Robert ran for re-election that year as a Republican rather than a Progressive, but was defeated in the Republican primary by Joe McCarthy. During its heyday the Progressive Party usually did not run candidates in Milwaukee as there was a tacit agreement with the city's Socialists that progressive third parties should not fight each other, despite strong ideological differences between the two movements (Socialist State Representative George L. Tews during a 1932 debate on unemployment compensation and how to fund it argued for the Socialist bill and against the Progressive substitute, stating that a Progressive was \\"a Socialist with the brains knocked out\\"Kaveny, Edward T. \\"$10,000,000 Tax: Assembly Passes Compromise Bill by 73 to 15 Vote\\" Milwaukee Sentinel January 6, 1932; p. 1, cols. 7-8), when both faced opposition from the conservative major parties. During the period from 1939 on, the Progressives and the Socialists of Milwaukee sometimes made common cause in a Farmer-Labor- Progressive Federation, with Socialist legislators caucusing with the minority Progressives. In 1942, Socialist Frank P. Zeidler, later to be elected Mayor of Milwaukee, was the nominee on the Progressive party line for State Treasurer of Wisconsin. The last politician to hold office from the Wisconsin Progressive Party nationally was Merlin Hull, a U.S. Representative from Wisconsin, elected as a Progressive in 1944.

The next morning, Dublin finds Parker and asks her to hire him as promoter. She refuses him at first, but after she ends up in prison for attending an illegal boxing event and Dublin manages to get her out, he persuades her to go on a tour with him.

Ertegun was the co-founder and president of Atlantic Records. He discovered and championed many leading rhythm and blues and rock musicians. Ertegun also wrote classic Blues and pop songs. He served as the chairman of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and museum, located in Cleveland, Ohio. Ertegun has been described as \\"one of the most significant figures in the modern recording industry.\\" In 2017 he was inducted into Rhythm & Blues Hall of Fame in recognition of his work in the music business. Ertegun helped foster ties between the U.S. and Turkey, his birthplace. He served as the chairman of the American Turkish Society for over 20 years until his death. He also co-founded the New York Cosmos soccer team of the original North American Soccer League. Background The Ertegun family in 1942. Ahmet was born in 1923 in Istanbul, Turkey. His mother, Hayr√ºnnisa, was an accomplished musician who played keyboard and stringed instruments. She bought the popular records of the day, to which Ahmet and his brother, Nesuhi listened. His older brother Nesuhi introduced him to jazz music, taking him at the age of nine to see the Duke Ellington and Cab Calloway orchestras in London. In 1935, Ahmet and his family moved to Washington, D.C. with his father, Munir Ertegun, who was appointed as the Ambassador of the Republic of Turkey to the United States. When Ahmet was 14, his mother bought him a record-cutting machine, which he used to compose and add lyrics to instrumental records. Ertegun's love for music pulled him into the heart of Washington, DC's black district where he would routinely see such top acts as Duke Ellington, Cab Calloway, Billie Holiday and Louis Armstrong. Although he attended Landon School, an affluent all-male private school in Bethesda, Maryland, Ahmet would joke \\"I got my real education at Howard\\"‚ÄîHoward University being a historically black college. Despite his affluent upbringing, Ertegun began to see a different world from his affluent peers. Ertegun would later say: \\"I began to discover a little bit about the situation of black people in America and experienced immediate empathy with the victims of such senseless discrimination, because, although Turks were never slaves, they were regarded as enemies within Europe because of their Muslim beliefs.\\" Ertegun and his brother frequented Milt Gabler's Commodore Music Shop, assembled a collection of over 15,000 jazz and blues 78s, and became acquainted with musicians such as Ellington, Lena Horne and Jelly Roll Morton. Ahmet and Nesuhi staged concerts by Lester Young, Sidney Bechet and other jazz giants. They also traveled to New Orleans and to Harlem to listen to music and develop a keen awareness of developing musical tastes. Ertegun graduated from St. John's College in Annapolis in 1944. In November of the same year, Munir Ertegun died. In 1946 President Harry Truman ordered the battleship USS Missouri to return his body to Turkey as a demonstration of friendship between the US and Turkey. This show of support was meant to counter the Soviet Union's potential political demands on Turkey. At the time of his father's death, Ahmet was taking graduate courses in Medieval philosophy at Georgetown University. Soon afterward, when the rest of the family returned permanently to Turkey. Ahmet and Nesuhi stayed in the United States. While Nesuhi moved to Los Angeles, Ahmet stayed in Washington and decided to get into the record business as a temporary measure to help him through college. Early career Ahmet (left) with his brother Nesuhi, around 1960 In 1946, Ertegun became friends with Herb Abramson, a dental student and A&R; man for National Records, and they decided to start a new independent record label for gospel, jazz, and R&B; music. Financed by family dentist Dr. Vahdi Sabit, they formed Atlantic Records in September 1947 in New York City. The first recording sessions took place that November. In 1949, after 22 unsuccessful record releases, including the first recordings by Professor Longhair, Atlantic had its first major hit with Stick McGhee's \\"Drinkin' Wine Spo-Dee-O-Dee\\". The company expanded through the 1950s, with Jerry Wexler and, later, Ertegun's brother Nesuhi on board as partners. Hit artists that recorded on Atlantic included Ruth Brown, Big Joe Turner, The Clovers, The Drifters, The Coasters and Ray Charles. Like the Erteguns, many independent record executives were from immigrant backgrounds, including the Bihari and the Chess brothers. The Ertegun brothers brought a jazz sensibility (and many jazz artists) into R&B;, successfully combining blues and jazz styles from around the country. Atlantic helped challenge the primacy of the major labels of the time by discovering, developing, and nurturing new talent. It became the premier rhythm and blues label in a few years and, with the help of innovative engineer/producer Tom Dowd, set new standards in producing high- quality recordings. Atlantic was among the first labels to record in stereo, and in 1957 was the first record company to utilize an 8-track tape machine. Ertegun himself wrote a number of classic blues songs, including \\"Chains of Love\\" and \\"Sweet Sixteen\\", under the pseudonym \\"A. Nugetre\\" (\\"Ertegun\\" backwards). The songs were given expression first by Big Joe Turner and continued in B.B. King's repertoire. \\"Chains of Love\\" was a popular hit for Pat Boone. He also wrote the Ray Charles hit \\"Mess Around\\", with lyrics that drew heavily on \\"Pinetop's Boogie Woogie\\". He was briefly listed as \\"Nuggy\\" in the credits before changing to \\"A. Nugetre\\". Ertegun was part of the shouting choral group on Turner's \\"Shake, Rattle and Roll\\", along with Wexler and songwriter Jesse Stone. He also wrote \\"Ting A Ling\\", a 1956 hit for The Clovers that was covered by Buddy Holly. \\"Fool, Fool, Fool\\", another Clovers song was a hit for Kay Starr. His \\"Don't Play That Song (You Lied)\\" was recorded by Aretha Franklin, Ben E. King, and in an international version by Adriano Celentano. The lyrics of \\"Lovey Dovey\\" by the Clovers were used to a different tune by Steve Miller in his hit \\"The Joker\\". Other Nugetre rhythm and blues hits include \\"Whatcha Gonna Do\\" by The Drifters, \\"Wild, Wild Young Men\\" by Ruth Brown, Ray Charles's \\"Heartbreaker\\", \\"Middle of the Night\\" by The Clovers, \\"Ti-Ri-Lee\\" by Big Joe Turner, and \\"Story of My Love\\" by LaVern Baker. All of these were originally recorded for Atlantic Records. He also wrote \\"Miss√§ Olit Silloin (Dawn in Ankara)\\" for Finnish singer Irina Milan as Ahmet Ertegun. Marriages On 6 January 1953 Ertegun married Jan Holm (n√©e Enstam), a Swedish-American actress, fashion model, and set designer, who was the daughter of Carl Enstam and the former wife of Walter Rathbun. She and Ertegun had no children and divorced in about 1956. In 1961 he married Ioana Maria \\"Mica\\" Grecianu, the former wife of Stefan Grecianu and a daughter of Gheorghe Banu, a Romanian doctor and statesman. Mica later became a well-known interior designer, a co-founder of the decorating firm MAC II. The couple had no children. Later career In the 1960s, Atlantic, often in partnerships with local labels like Stax Records in Memphis, helped to develop the growth of soul music, with artists such as Ben E. King, Solomon Burke, Otis Redding, Sam and Dave, Percy Sledge, Aretha Franklin and Wilson Pickett. Ertegun helped introduce America to The Rascals when he discovered the group at a Westhampton nightclub in 1965 and signed them to Atlantic. They went on to chart 13 Top 40 singles in four years and were elected to the Rock-n-Roll Hall of Fame in 1997. Ertegun heard Led Zeppelin's demo and knew they would be a smash hit after hearing the first few songs, and quickly signed them. In the late 1970s, during the disco era, Ertegun contracted producer Silvio Tancredi (Wonderband, Lourett Russell Grant, Herbie Mann) to Atlantic Records. Atlantic Records also held the rights to recordings by Stephen Stills. After negotiating with David Geffen, who in turn was negotiating with Clive Davis at Columbia Records to transfer the rights to David Crosby and Graham Nash to Atlantic Records, he signed Crosby, Stills and Nash and convinced the trio to allow Neil Young to join them on one of their tours, thereby founding Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young. Ertegun initially had no desire to sell Atlantic, but his partner Jerry Wexler was nervous about the label's future and after convincing Ertegun's brother Nesuhi of his position, Ertegun eventually conceded and they sold Atlantic to Warner Bros.-Seven Arts in 1967 for $17 million in stock, although Wexler later admitted that, because of assets like the rights to the hit movie Woodstock and the accompanying record, the deal paid them less than half of what the label was actually worth. Wexler had seen the other 1950s independent record labels disappear with the waning popularity of rhythm and blues, and said only Ertegun's foresightful adaptation of signing white rock musicians turned out to be the basis of Atlantic's continued success.\\"Atlantic Records; The House That Ahmet Built\\" Rhino DVD, 2007. Four years later, the Ertegun brothers took some of the money and co-founded the New York Cosmos Association football (soccer) team of the North American Soccer League. They were instrumental in bringing soccer legends like Pel√©, Carlos Alberto and Franz Beckenbauer to the club. They transformed the Cosmos into a \\"dream team\\". When Atlantic became part of the Kinney conglomerate in 1969, and later part of Time Warner, Atlantic Records continued with Ertegun at the helm, and although he was less directly involved as a producer, he wielded considerable influence in the new conglomerate. He continued to produce some rock acts, such as Dr. John and The Honeydrippers. He also used his considerable personal skills in negotiations with major stars, such as when The Rolling Stones were shopping for a record company to distribute their independent Rolling Stones Records label. Ertegun personally conducted the negotiations with Mick Jagger, successfully completing the deal between the Stones and Atlantic, when other labels had actually offered the band more money. He took a personal interest in the progressive rock band Yes, and took a strong stand with bassist Chris Squire on the direction of the 90125 album. He encouraged Squire and the group to make sure the album produced a hit single, which it did with \\"Owner of a Lonely Heart\\". In 1987 Ertegun was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, of which he himself was a founder. In the late 1980s, with the support of Bonnie Raitt and others, he provided $1.5 million to help establish the Rhythm and Blues Foundation to award money to underpaid blues artists. The Foundation's establishment arose from a lengthy battle by Ruth Brown and other Atlantic artists to obtain unpaid past royalties from the company; other record companies later also contributed. Among early recipients of payments were John Lee Hooker, Bo Diddley, Johnny \\"Guitar\\" Watson, Ruth Brown and the Staple Singers. Ertegun received an honorary doctorate in music from the Berklee College of Music in Boston in 1991, and was awarded the Grammy Trustees Award for his lifetime achievements in 1993. At the tenth annual Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Induction Dinner in 1995, it was announced that the museum's main exhibition hall would be named after him. The United States Library of Congress honored Ertegun as a Living Legend in 2000. With brother Nesuhi, he was inducted into the National Soccer Hall of Fame in 2003. In 2005, the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences presented Ertegun with the first \\"President's Merit Award Salute To Industry Icons\\". He was also a recipient of The International Center in New York's Award of Excellence. Ertegun approved the recording and release of Music of the Whirling Dervishes, featuring ayin singer K√¢ni Karaca and ney player Akag√ºnd√ºz Kutbay on the Atlantic label. Philanthropy In addition to being a seminal figure in the history of popular music, Ertegun was also a prominent philanthropist dedicated to enhancing relations and cultural understanding between the United States and his native country, Turkey. As the chairman of The American Turkish Society, he introduced numerous American dignitaries, business leaders, investors, and artists to Turkey and garnered U.S. support for Turkey. Following the devastating earthquake near Istanbul in 1999, Ertegun was instrumental in the success of the Society's Earthquake Relief Fund, which raised over $4 million for Turkey's rebuilding efforts, particularly in education. In addition to his endeavors at The American Turkish Society, Ertegun funded the Turkish studies departments at Princeton and Georgetown universities. In 2008, the Ahmet Ertegun Memorial Scholarship, established by the American Turkish Society, was officially announced and is designated for music students of Turkish descent to study at the Juilliard School. 2006 injury and death On October 29, 2006, Ertegun tripped, striking his head on a concrete floor, at a Rolling Stones concert at the Beacon Theatre. He was immediately taken to hospital. Ertegun fell into a coma and died on December 14, 2006, at NewYork‚ÄìPresbyterian Hospital-Weill Cornell Medical Center. Ertegun was buried December 18 in the Garden of Sufi Tekke, √ñzbekler Tekkesi in Sultantepe, √úsk√ºdar, ƒ∞stanbul, next to his brother, his father, and his sheikh great-grandfather ≈ûeyh ƒ∞brahim Edhem Efendi, who was once the head of the tekke in his native Turkey. Memorial events A memorial service for Ertegun was held in New York on April 17, 2007. A large part of the evening was given over to musical performances. Wynton Marsalis opened the tribute with the jazz standard \\"Didn't He Ramble\\", Eric Clapton and Dr. John performed \\"Drinkin' Wine Spo-Dee-O-Dee\\", and other performers included Solomon Burke, Ben E. King, Sam Moore, Stevie Nicks, Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young, and Phil Collins. Another informal salute to him took place in Los Angeles on July 31, 2007, the anniversary of his birth. The tribute took place at Grauman's Egyptian Theatre in Hollywood. Several of his friends shared anecdotes about their experiences with him and the assembled gathering then saw a special screening of the American Masters documentary Atlantic Records: The House That Ahmet Built. Among those who paid tribute to Ertegun in person were: Solomon Burke, Jerry Leiber & Mike Stoller, Keith Emerson, Peter Asher, Spencer Davis, the film's producer (and longtime friend) Phil Carson, Taylor Hackford and event producer Martin Lewis. The Martin Scorsese film Shine a Light about The Rolling Stones concert held at the Beacon Theatre in New York contains a dedication to Ertegun and Andrea Corr's solo album Ten Feet High is dedicated \\"To the memory of Ahmet Ertegun\\". In honor of the barriers the Ertegun brothers broke during their time in segregated Washington, the current Turkish Ambassador to the U.S., Namik Tan, hosts a series of jazz concerts at the historical residence on Sheridan Circle in Washington, D.C. The \\"Ertegun Jazz Series,\\" in collaboration with Jazz at Lincoln Center, revives the brothers' legacy of bridging cultures and bringing people together with one common objective: celebrating music. In that same spirit, Ambassador Tan is opening the doors of his home to residents of D.C. from various backgrounds ‚Äì Members of Congress, Administration officials, academia, the media, business leaders, and others. =Tribute concert= Led Zeppelin reunited for a one-off show in a tribute to Ertegun at The O2 Arena in London on December 10, 2007. It remains one of only four times the band's surviving members have reunited since drummer John Bonham's death in 1980 (the other three being the 1985 Live Aid concert, the 1988 Atlantic Records 40th anniversary concert‚Äîwhich Ertegun attended‚Äîand their 1995 induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame). It remains their only full concert since their official break-up in 1980. The band headlined a bill that also included Paolo Nutini, Mick Jones of Foreigner and Bill Wyman's Rhythm Kings who supported their acts, and additionally shared the stage with them. The show was held to raise money for the Ahmet Ertegun Education Fund, which pays for university scholarships in the UK, US and Turkey. The show had been scheduled for late November but had been postponed by two weeks because of Jimmy Page fracturing a finger. =Art collection= Ertegun's collection of modernist works is now housed at The Baker Museum in Naples, Florida. The collection includes works by Oscar Bluemner, Thomas Hart Benton, Stuart Davis, Werner Drewes, John Ferren, Ilya Bolotowsky, and Albert Swinden; Ertegun's alma mater, St. John's College, presented an exhibition of works from this collection in 2015.Notice from St. John's College about exhibit, March 11-April 19, 2015. In popular culture Ertegun has been represented several times in popular culture. In Ray, the biopic of Ray Charles, he is portrayed by Curtis Armstrong. In Beyond the Sea, the biopic about Bobby Darin, he is played by Tayfun Bademsoy. Musician Frank Zappa named his son Ahmet after Ertegun, who played an important role in Zappa's early career. 2017 sexual harassment/assault allegation In 2017, Dorothy Carvello alleged that Ertegun tried to remove her underwear and groped her under her shirt at a public event in 1987. Her book Anything for a Hit tells of her experiences.

Early life Born in Constantinople in the Ottoman Empire, Nesuhi and his family, including his younger brother Ahmet, moved to Washington, D.C., in 1935 with their father Munir Ertegun, who was appointed the Turkish Ambassador to the United States that year. From an early age, Nesuhi's primary musical interest was jazz. He had attended concerts in Europe before his family moved to the United States. Career While living at the Turkish Embassy in Washington, D.C., he promoted jazz concerts during 1941-1944. When his father died in 1944, and the rest of his family returned to Turkey, Nesuhi moved to California, where he married Jazz Man Record Shop owner Marili Morden and helped run the shop as well as establishing the Crescent Records label. After purchasing Jazz Man Records, he discontinued Crescent and issued traditional jazz recordings on Jazz Man until 1952. At Jazz Man, Nesuhi produced classic Kid Ory revival recordings in 1944 and 1945, plus other recordings by Pete Daily and Turk Murphy. Although his main interest was initially New Orleans jazz, which he also wrote about while serving as the editor of Record Changer magazine, Ertegun was open to more modern styles. He sold the Jazz Man label in 1952 to Lester Koenig and then went to work for Koenig at Good Time Jazz Records. While there, on Koenig's recommendation, he was engaged to teach the first history of jazz course for academic credit at a major US university at UCLA. In 1955, he was preparing to work for Imperial Records to develop their jazz record line and develop a catalog of LPs. However, Ahmet Ertegun and Jerry Wexler persuaded him instead to join their company, Atlantic Records, where he was made a partner.David Edwards and Mike Callahan - The Atlantic Records Story He became vice- president in charge of the jazz and LP department at Atlantic, building up the label's extensive catalog of jazz LPs. He was responsible for investing in the album market, improving the quality of recordings and sleeve formats. As a producer at Atlantic he worked with John Coltrane, Charles Mingus, Ornette Coleman, whom Lester Koenig had previously recorded at Contemporary, the Modern Jazz Quartet and many others. Nesuhi also became involved with the label's rhythm & blues and rock-and-roll roster, first recruiting songwriters and producers Leiber and Stoller, with whom he had worked in California, and producing several hit records for Ray Charles, Chris Connor, the Drifters, Bobby Darin and Roberta Flack. In 1971, Nesuhi founded WEA International, now Warner Music Group. While at WEA International, Nesuhi demonstrated tremendous independence and character, often going against the wishes of his US counterparts. In the 1980s, Nesuhi released the single \\"Girls, Girls, Girls\\" by then unknown Latin-American rockers Renegade, demanding a domestic release of their debut album Rock N' Roll Crazy!. The domestic label had demanded the band members change their names to \\"less ethnic\\" sounding names. Nesuhi was incensed by the demand, and set out to introduce the record and the act internationally with the band's given names. He remained head of the Warner Records International Division until he retired in 1987. Death and legacy With Ahmet, he also co-founded the New York Cosmos soccer team of the North American Soccer League. They were instrumental in bringing in soccer legends like Giorgio Chinaglia, Pel√©, Carlos Alberto and Franz Beckenbauer to the club. Ertegun died on July 15, 1989, at the age of 71, from complications of cancer surgery at Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York City. Nesuhi Ertegun was inducted posthumously into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 1991. He was posthumously awarded the Grammy Trustees Award for lifetime achievements in 1995. For his contributions to the sport of soccer, he and Ahmet were inducted into the National Soccer Hall of Fame in 2003. The Nesuhi Ertegun Jazz Hall of Fame (now the Ertegun Hall of Fame)Ertegun Hall of Fame at Jazz at Lincoln Center was dedicated to him in 2004. Nesuhi was an avid collector of Surrealist art. His collection (along with that of his friend Daniel Filipacchi) was exhibited at the Guggenheim in New York in 1999 in \\"Surrealism: Two Private Eyes, the Nesuhi Ertegun and Daniel Filipacchi Collections\\"‚Äîan event described by The New York Times as \\"a gourmet banquet\\", large enough to \\"pack the Solomon R.

Similar to bisulfite sequencing and pyrosequencing, this method quantifies methylation levels at various loci within the genome. This assay is used for methylation probes on the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation27 BeadChip (henceforth, 27k [methylation] array). Probes on the 27k array target regions of the human genome to measure methylation levels at 27,578 CpG dinucleotides in 14,495 genes.Weisenberger, DJ. et al. (2008) Comprehensive DNA Methylation Analysis on the Illumina Infinium Assay Platform. The Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip array targets >450,000 methylation sites.https://support.illumina.com/content/dam/illumina- marketing/documents/products/product_information_sheets/product_info_hm450.pdf Background DNA methylation plays a significant role in the epigenetic regulation of chromatin structure, which in the last decade has been recognized to be important in the regulation of gene expression, development and genetic imprinting in vertebrates. Changes in the methylation pattern and level have been shown to contribute to cancer and various developmental diseases.DNA methylation in development and human disease. Gopalakrishnan S, Van Emburgh BO, Robertson KD. Mutation Research. 2008 Dec 1;647(1-2):30-8. Epub 2008 Aug 20. Review. For example, hypermethylation at the promoter CpG islands of a tumour suppressor gene, which in turn leads to its silencing, is frequently associated with tumourgenesis. A large scale measurement of DNA methylation patterns from a wide selection of genes may enable us to understand better the relationships between epigenetic changes and the genesis of different diseases and a better understanding of the role that epigenetics plays in tissue specific differentiation. Table 1. Methylation Statistics Material The Illumina 27k methylation chip contains 27,578 individual CpG sites, spread across 14,495 genes. These genes include RefSeq genes from the NCBI CCDS Database, cancer genes that show differential methylation patterns during their course of progression and microRNA promoters.Illumina: DNA Methylation Analysis: http://www.illumina.com/downloads/DNAMethylationAnalysis_DataSheet.pdf The markers included in the chip are summarized in Table 1. Method Figure 1. Workflow of the Infinium I assay. A single BeadChip accommodates 12 samples. Only one strand at the (same) locus (corresponding to e.g. the same strand, maternal and paternal copies in a diploid individual that is heterozygous for methylation at this particular locus) is depicted here. In this example, single-base extension was successful for the two dideoxynucleotides containing adenine, corresponding to one methylated and one unmethylated allele in the original (i.e., before bisulphite conversion) genome. For the Infinium I assay chemistry technology, the process is outlined in Figure 1. Bisulfite treatment Approximately 1 Œºg of genomic DNA is used in bisulfite conversion to convert the unmethylated cytosine into uracil. The product contains unconverted cytosine where they were previously methylated, but cytosine converted to uracil if they were previously unmethylated. Whole-genomic DNA amplification The bisulfite treated DNA is subjected to whole-genome amplification (WGA) via random hexamer priming and Phi29 DNA polymerase, which has a proofreading activity resulting in error rates 100 times lower than the Taq polymerase. The products are then enzymatically fragmented, purified from dNTPs, primers and enzymes, and applied to the chip.Gunderson, KL. et al. A genome-wide scalable SNP genotyping assay using microarray technology. Nature Genetics 37, 549 - 554 (2005). Hybridization and Single-base extension On the chip, there are two bead types for each CpG (or \\"CG\\", as per Figure 1) site per locus. Each locus tested is differentiated by different bead types. Both bead types are attached to single-stranded 50-mer DNA oligonucleotides that differ in sequence only at the free end; this type of probe is known as an allele-specific oligonucleotide. One of the bead types will correspond to the methylated cytosine locus and the other will correspond to the unmethylated cytosine locus, which has been converted into uracil during bisulfite treatment and later amplified as thymine during whole-genome amplification. The bisulfite-converted amplified DNA products are denatured into single strands and hybridized to the chip via allele-specific annealing to either the methylation-specific probe or the non-methylation probe. Hybridization is followed by single-base extension with hapten-labeled dideoxynucleotides. The ddCTP and ddGTP are labeled with biotin while ddATP and ddUTP are labeled with 2,4-dinitrophenol (DNP).Steemers, FJ. et al. Whole- genome genotyping with the single-base extension assay. Nature methods, Vol. 3, No. 1, Jan, 31 ‚Äì 33 (2006). Fluorescence staining and scanning of chip After incorporation of these hapten-labeled ddNTPs, multi-layered immunohistochemical assays are performed by repeated rounds of staining with a combination of antibodies to differentiate the two types. After staining, the chip is scanned to show the intensities of the unmethylated and methylated bead types. (Figure 2). The raw data are analyzed by the proprietary software, and the fluorescence intensity ratios between the two bead types are calculated. For a given individual at a given locus, a ratio value of 0 equals to non-methylation of the locus (i.e., homozygous unmethylated); a ratio of 1 equals to total methylation (i.e., homozygous methylated); and a value of 0.5 means that one copy is methylated and the other is not (i.e., heterozygosity), in the diploid human genome. Figure 2. Types of data analysis. Analysis of methylation data The scanned microarray images of methylation data are further analyzed by the system, which normalizes the raw data to reduce the effects of experimental variation, background and average normalization, and performs standard statistical tests on the results.BeadStudio Methylation Module User Guide. Version 3. Illumina Systems & Software. 2006 The data can then be compiled into several types of figures for visualization and analysis. Scatter plots are used to correlate the methylation data; bar plots to visualize relative levels of methylation at each site tested; heat maps to cluster the data to compare the methylation profile at the sites tested. Figure 2 shows the different types of results generated.  Advantages and disadvantages  Advantages * No PCR is required, which means that there will be no selective bias towards shorter fragments. * Ability to survey up to 12 samples per chip allows for high throughput processing. * Allows integration of data between other platforms such as gene expression and microRNA profiling. * The method looks at ~2 CpG sites per CpG island, providing genome-wide coverage of methylation patterns Disadvantages * Not every gene annotated in the NCBI database was included in the design of this assay, which covers 14,495 genes out of the 17,052 GeneIDs present to date (Human build 36.3).NCBI, Consensus CDS (CCDS) project * According to Staaf et al. (2008), ‚Äúthe Infinium II assay seemed to have dye intensity biases between the two channels used in fluorescence detection. Furthermore, this bias was not eliminated even after the data had gone through normalization algorithms used in the BeadStudio software.‚Äù This concern, while valid for the GoldenGate methylation assay, is not relevant to the HumanMethylation27k chips, where both probes in a pair extend and fluoresce within the same channel.Staaf, J. et al.

His work, often distinguished by its emotional resonance and offbeat humor, has been compared by critics to a variety of authors, most notably J.D. Salinger, Charles Dickens, T.C. Boyle, and John Irving. Sherman Alexie has called Evison \\"the most honest white man alive.\\" Career Evison's debut novel, All About Lulu, published in 2008 by Soft Skull Press, won critical acclaim, including the Washington State Book Award, and landed on many year-end \\"Best of\\" lists, including Hudson Booksellers, where it enjoyed the added distinction of being the only independent title selected in 2008. The L Magazine included All About Lulu in its Best Books of the Decade. Evison's second novel, the New York Times Bestselling West of Here, was released in 2011 by Algonquin Books. West of Here won the 2012 Pacific Northwest Booksellers Association Award and the Booklist Editor's Choice Award, and was named Book of the Year by Hudson Booksellers. Editor Chuck Adams has called West of Here the best novel he's worked on in over four decades of publishing. His third novel, The Revised Fundamentals of Caregiving, released in 2012, was also widely acclaimed, earning him his second Pacific Northwest Booksellers Award in as many years. In the New York Times, Janet Maslin called the novel \\"Evison's most stealthily powerful\\" [work]. The novel was turned into the 2016 film The Fundamentals of Caring by director Rob Burnett of Worldwide Pants, starring Paul Rudd, Selena Gomez, and Craig Roberts. The film was released as a Netflix original. Evison's fourth novel, This Is Your Life, Harriet Chance! was published in fall of 2015, and soon after optioned by Focus Features, where it is currently in development. His fifth novel, Lawn Boy was published in the spring of 2018, receiving starred reviews from Publishers Weekly, Booklist, and Library Journal.

In 1976, his mother relocated the family to Bainbridge Island, Washington, when he was eight years old. He credits his third-grade teacher for making a writer out of him: \\"A lot of stuff, including my sister‚Äôs death, and my parents‚Äô crumbling marriage, made for a rough patch around then. Also, my mania was practically off the charts. I ran my teachers ragged. My third- grade teacher, Mrs. Hanford, god love her, recognized that I liked to write, so she finally started sitting me in a corner and just letting me write, and in doing so, accomplished two things: She negated a huge distraction for the rest of the class, and she made a writer out of me.\\" In his teens, Evison was the founding member and frontman of the Seattle punk band March of Crimes, which included future members of Pearl Jam and Soundgarden. He graduated from Bainbridge High School in 1986, before moving back to California to care for his agoraphobic grandmother. He attended community college at College of San Mateo off and on for three years, never receiving a degree. Evison allegedly wrote six unpublished novels before the publication of All About Lulu, physically burying three of them, and purportedly burning all of his rejection letters., Evison is renowned for his extensive and colorful book touring, and his love of beer.http://www.readinginla.com/?p=128 In 2009 and 2011 he was nominated by the American Book Association as Most Engaging Author.

He was a professor at the University of Bonn and travelled extensively throughout Europe and the Near East in order to locate manuscripts of the New Testament. Life Scholz attended secondary school at the Catholic gymnasium in Breslau and then studied at the University of Breslau. In 1817 he was granted the degree of Doctor of Theology by the University of Freiburg, where he had studied under Johann Leonhard Hug (1765-1846). Scholz then went to Paris, where he studied Persian and Arabic under Silvestre de Sacy, and collated numerous codices (Greek, Latin, Arabic and Syriac) of the New Testament. From Paris he went to London, then travelled through France and Switzerland en route to Italy, the principal libraries of which he visited in order to conduct biblical research. In the autumn of 1821, upon his return from a journey through Egypt, Palestine and Syria, and having been ordained at Breslau (in October 1821), Scholz became professor of exegesis at the University of Bonn, a chair to which he had been called in 1820, and which he filled until his death, despite the fact that he was not an interesting lecturer. In 1837, Scholz was appointed canon of the Cologne Cathedral. Work In addition to his major work, his Novum Testamentum Graece (a text edition of the Greek New Testament), Scholz was also known for his efforts in Bible translation, in which he continued the work begun by Dominikus von Brentano and Anton Dereser. Scholz's work in textual criticism was particularly appreciated by the British. He was able to add to the list of Greek manuscripts of the New Testament 616 new minuscule manuscripts. His additions to the list of uncials comprise only Codex Sangallensis (Œî) and three fragments of the Gospels 0115 (formerly Wa), 054 (his Y), and the Vatican portion of N022 (his Œì). These manuscripts were partially examined and collated by him.S. P. Tregelles, The Printed Text of the Greek New Testament, London 1854, p. 92. Results of his work were published between 1830 and 1836. Scholz's accession of new witnesses to the lists of New Testament manuscripts was extensive. He was responsible for adding codices 260-469 of the Gospels, 110-192 of the Acts, 125-246 of the Pauline epistles, 51-89 of the Apocalypse, 51-181 of the Evangelistaria, and 21-48 of the Apostoloi. Scholz collated the entire text of five manuscripts: 262, 299, 300, 301 and 346. Other manuscripts he collated in large part: (260, 270, 271, 277, 284, 285, 298, 324, 353, 382 and 428). Scholz divided all New Testament manuscripts into five families: two African (Alexandrian and Western), one Asiatic, one Byzantine and one Cyprian. He was the first to emphasize the importance of ascertaining the geographical provenance of a witness. That point was elaborated by B. H. Streeter in 1924 (\\"theory of local texts\\"). Scholz, after some tentative attempts at classifying manuscripts, rejected this theory and adopted Johann Albrecht Bengel's division into two families, which he called the Alexandrian and the Constantinopolitan. He initially favoured the Constantinopolitan (Byzantine) family of manuscripts, but in 1845 he retracted this preference for the Constantinopolitan .Bruce M. Metzger, Bart D.

Nickel metal hydride battery technology was considered important to the development of battery electric vehicles (BEVs or EVs), plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) and hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) before the technology for lithium-ion battery packs became a viable replacement. Background The modern nickel-metal hydride (NiMH) electric vehicle battery was invented by Dr. Masahiko Oshitani, of the GS Yuasa Corporation, and Stanford Ovshinsky, the founder of the Ovonics Battery Company, and granted a patent. The current trend in the industry is towards the development of lithium-ion (Li-Ion) technology to replace NiMH in electric vehicles. In 2009, Toyota tested lithium batteries as a potential replacement for the nickel metal hydride batteries used in its Prius model gasoline- electric hybrid. The company said that it would continue to use NiMH batteries in the Prius, but would introduce an all-electric vehicle based on lithium technology. Li-Ion technology, while functionally superior due to its higher specific energy and specific power, is more expensive and, as of 2009, relatively untested with regards to its long-term reliability. In 2007, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory said that Li-Ion batteries may be subject to dangerous overheating and fire if cells are controlled incorrectly or damaged. In 2011, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration investigated the safety of lithium battery powered vehicles and concluded that they pose no more risk of fire than other vehicles. According to the United States Department of Energy the primary advantages of lithium batteries include their high power-to-weight ratio, high energy efficiency, good high temperature performance, and low tendency to spontaneously discharge when left unused for extended periods of time. Nickel metal hydride batteries have higher self-discharge, tend to generate heat at high temperatures, and have problems with hydrogen loss. However, none of these problems prevented the use of nickel metal hydride batteries in the Toyota Prius, which has an excellent reliability rating. Market feasibility in the 1990s The 2011 Nissan Leaf had lower range and smaller battery capacity than the 1999 GM EV1. Nevertheless, it was a hit. The 1999 GM EV1 production vehicle, powered by nickel metal hydride batteries, had a 26.4 kWh battery and an EPA range of 105 miles.This is the value recalculated by EPA according to later, stricter norms; the original 1999 rating was closer to 150 miles. The 2011 Nissan Leaf production vehicle had a 24 kWh battery and an EPA range of 84 miles. Despite having not only a shorter range, but also a battery of smaller capacity than the 1999 GM EV1, the Leaf found 200,000 buyers worldwide before battery capacity was first increased in 2016. Based on this, the claim that the NiMH technology was not sufficiently advanced in the 1990s seems false (at least with regard to two-seater cars that could more easily accommodate a battery of relatively large dimensions and weight). General Motors and the US Auto Battery Consortium The Ovonics technology was acquired by General Motors for use in its EV1 electric car, but production was ended shortly after the NiMH batteries began to replace the lead-acid batteries of earlier models In an interview in the 2006 documentary Who Killed the Electric Car?, Ovshinsky stated that in the early 1990s, the auto industry created the US Auto Battery Consortium (USABC) to stifle the development of electric vehicle technology by preventing the dissemination of knowledge about Ovshinky's battery-related patents to the public through the California Air Resources Board (CARB). According to Ovshinsky, the auto industry falsely suggested that NiMH technology was not yet ready for widespread use in road cars. Members of the USABC, including General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler, threatened to take legal action against Ovshinsky if he continued to promote NiMH's potential for use in BEVs, and if he continued to lend test batteries to Solectria, a start-up electric vehicle maker that was not part of the USABC. The Big Three car companies argued that his behavior violated their exclusive rights to the battery technology, because they had matched a federal government grant given to Ovonics to develop NiMH technology. Critics argue that the Big Three were more interested in convincing CARB members that electric vehicles were not technologically and commercially viable. In 1994, General Motors acquired a controlling interest in Ovonics's battery development and manufacture, including patents controlling the manufacture of large NiMH batteries. The original intent of the equity alliance was to develop NiMH batteries for GM's EV1 BEV. Sales of GM-Ovonics batteries were later taken over by GM manager and critic of CARB John Williams, leading Ovshinsky to wonder whether his decision to sell to GM had been naive. The EV1 program was shut down by GM before the new NiMH battery could be widely commercialized, despite field tests that indicated the Ovonics battery extended the EV1's range to over 150 miles. Here, \\"field tests\\" mean actual use by customers, as these NiMH powered cars were in the hands of customers from 1999 until 2003, when GM took the cars from lessees (over their protests) and crushed them. Chevron and Cobasys By 2001, the Ovonics technology was owned by the oil company Chevron. In October 2000, oil company Texaco announced the purchase of General Motors' share in GM Ovonics. Texaco was itself acquired by rival Chevron, which was announced a few days later (and completed a year later). At that time, Toyota was using NiMH batteries in the electric RAV4 SUV available in California. In March 2001, Chevron-controlled Ovonics filed a patent infringement suit against Toyota's battery supplier, Panasonic, as well as against Toyota itself, that led to a negotiated settlement in 2004. The agreement included extensive cross-licensing of each company's patents; a joint research venture to improve nickel hydride battery technology; and a ban on Panasonic's and Toyota's use of large format NiMH batteries for certain transportation uses until 2010. Information about what exactly were these particular transportation uses of NiMH batteries - that ChevronTexaco has forbidden - was suppressed due to a gag order placed on Toyota. This way, ChevronTexaco forced Toyota to end production of the first generation Toyota RAV4 EV. However, the existing RAV4 EVs were not crushed. After the court granted a motion to stay proceedings (January 2002) and the ICC also agreed to hold its proceedings, Toyota allowed customers to buy their RAV4 EVs (March 2002 onwards), previously only available on a lease, even though it was not required by the California law to do so - and Toyota's obligations under the MOA with the California Air Resources Board's ZEV mandate were already fulfilled. Moreover, production and sales continued during the time the proceedings were halted, and sales ended only shortly (November 2002) before the parties entered into an arbitration agreement (December 2002), even though the last delivered vehicles had to be built with non-standard manufacturing techniques such as assembling a vehicle from spare parts (deliveries continued until September 2003). This shows obvious interest of at least some people in Toyota to keep the electric RAV4 alive. RAV4 EV, and also prohibited sales of \\"commercial quantitites\\" of certain large automotive NiMH batteries until June 30, 2010. After the forced discontinuation of the first-gen RAV4 EV and until Chevron- held patents expired, no new NiMH electric car was offered for sale or lease in the United States. Forced by Chevron to abandon plug-in vehicles, Toyota continued to use NiMH batteries in the non-plug-in Prius hybrid. In 2003, Texaco Ovonics Battery Systems was restructured into Cobasys, a 50/50 joint venture between ChevronTexaco and Ovonics, now known as Energy Conversion Devices (ECD) Ovonics. Energy Conversion Devices announced that they had exercised an option to purchase back 4,376,633 shares of stock from a Chevron subsidiary, and would cancel and return them to authorized-unissued status. This is the exact number of shares that was listed as owned by ChevronTexaco in the January 15, 2003 filing. ChevronTexaco also maintained veto power over any sale or licensing of NiMH technology. In addition, ChevronTexaco maintained the right to seize all of Cobasys' intellectual property rights in the event that ECD Ovonics did not fulfill its contractual obligations. On September 10, 2007, ChevronTexaco (now known as simply \\"Chevron\\") filed suit claiming that ECD Ovonics had not fulfilled its obligations. ECD Ovonics disputed this claim. The arbitration hearing has been repeatedly suspended while the parties negotiated with General Motors over the sale of Cobasys back to GM. As of March 2008, no agreement had been reached with GM. In her 2007 book Plug-in Hybrids: The Cars that Will Recharge America, Sherry Boschert argues that large-format NiMH batteries (i.e., 25 amp-hours or more) are commercially viable but that Cobasys would only accept very large orders (more than 10,000) for these batteries. The effect is that this policy precludes small companies and individuals from buying them. It also precludes larger auto manufacturers from developing test fleets of new PHEV and EV designs. Toyota employees complained about the difficulty in getting smaller orders of large format NiMH batteries to service the existing 825 RAV4 EVs. Since no other companies were willing to make large orders, Cobasys was not manufacturing nor licensing any large format NiMH battery technology for automotive purposes. Boschert quotes Dave Goldstein, president of the Electric Vehicle Association of Washington D.C., as saying this policy is necessary because the cost of setting up a multimillion-dollar battery assembly line could not be justified without guaranteed orders of 100,000 batteries (~12,000 EVs) per year for 3 years. Boschert concludes that, \\"it's possible that Cobasys (Chevron) is squelching all access to large NiMH batteries through its control of patent licenses in order to remove a competitor to gasoline. Or it's possible that Cobasys simply wants the market for itself and is waiting for a major automaker to start producing plug-in hybrids or electric vehicles.\\" In an interview with The Economist, Ovshinsky subscribed to the former view. \\"I think we at ECD made a mistake of having a joint venture with an oil company, frankly speaking. And I think it's not a good idea to go into business with somebody whose strategies would put you out of business, rather than building the business.\\" In the same interview, however, when asked, \\"So it‚Äôs your opinion that Cobasys is preventing other people from making it for that reason?\\", he responded, \\"Cobasys is not preventing anybody. Cobasys just needs an infusion of cash.\\" In October 2007, International Acquisitions Services, Inc. and Innovative Transportation Systems AG filed suit against Cobasys and its parents for refusing to fill a large, previously agreed-upon, order for large-format NiMH batteries to be used in the Innovan electric vehicle. In August 2008, Mercedes-Benz sued Cobasys for again refusing to fill a large, previously agreed-upon order for NiMH batteries. Timeline of legal status of the Ovonics battery technology Multiple companies have tried to develop NiMH battery technology without making use of Ovonics' patents. Electro Energy Inc., working with CalCars, converted a Toyota Prius from a hybrid electric vehicle to a PHEV using its own bipolar NiMH batteries. Plug- In Conversions uses Nilar NiMH batteries and the EAA-PHEV open source control system in its Prius PHEV conversions. These organizations maintain that these developments are allowable because their NiMH battery technologies are not covered by Cobasys' patents. These batteries became commercially available in late 2007. On July 28, 2009, Automotive News reported that Cobasys would be bought from Chevron and Energy Conversion Devices by battery maker SB LiMotive, a joint venture of Bosch and Samsung. At the time of the 2009 Cobasys sale, control of NiMH battery technology transferred back to ECD Ovonics. In October 2009, ECD Ovonics announced that their next-generation NiMH batteries will provide specific energy and power that are comparable to those of lithium-ion batteries at a cost that is significantly lower than the cost of lithium-ion batteries. On February 3, 2010, patent JP2003504507 was refused, hence removing any patent encumbrance in Japan. On July 2, 2010, patent US6413670, expired due to lack of fee payments for the 8th year from filing the patent, hence removing any patent encumbrance in the USA. On February 14, 2012, BASF announced that it had acquired Ovonic Battery Company from Energy Conversion Devices Inc. But Chevron Corp. held the patent US6969567 for the NiMH multi-cell battery pack for cars until its expiration on August 23, 2018. This particular patent's maintenance fees for the 4th (2008) and 8th (2012) years were paid.. As of December 2019 the status was \\"2019-12-04 Application status is Expired - Fee Related\\".

She is the younger sister of model Frankie Rayder. Her career is highlighted by appearances on several leading high fashion magazines such as Vogue Italia, Vogue Espa√±a, and Elle France. She is linked to her sister through various print ad campaigns and joint cover girl work. Background Born in River Falls, Wisconsin, Rayder has done runway show modeling of ready to wear apparel since 1997. She has also appeared in print ads for companies including Ann Taylor, Balenciaga, Barneys New York, Bulgari fragrance, Burberry, David Yurman, Escada, GAP, Jean Paul Gaultier, Kenneth Cole, Missoni, Moschino, Nordstrom, Prada, Louis Vuitton, Vera Wang, and most recently Agent Provocateur. In 1997, Missy debuted in Paris and Milan runway shows for Chlo√©, Costume National, Trussardi and others. In the fall of 2000, The New York Times referred to Missy and Frankie Rayder collectively as the famous Rayder Sisters. They had been featured together on the May 2000 cover of Harper's Bazaar. Rayder was considered to be one of the top models at Elite Model Management in New York City at the beginning of 2002. Elite opened up a new division to cater to her and its other top models: Erin O'Connor, Maggie Rizer, Karen Elson, Oluchi Onweagba, and Sophie Dahl. In April 2002, she had income tax issues that nearly prevented from reentering the United States due to money earned overseas during Mercedes Australian Fashion Week. That September, Steven Meisel asked her to shave her hair and eyebrows for a New York Marc Jacobs show. In the following months she was on the cover of German Vogue (October) and Vogue Italia (November) with the latter being Meisel's work. Rayder was one of the featured models (along with her sister and Linda Evangelista, Twiggy, Patti Hansen with daughters Alexandra and Theodora Richards, and Beverly Johnson) in the 50-model Ann Taylor 50th Anniversary ad campaign that was photographed by Annie Leibovitz in 2004. In 2006, she appeared on the Harper‚Äôs Bazaar‚Äôs best-dressed list. Rayder is among the people often spotted as a celebrity at New York Knicks games at Madison Square Garden. Between 2002 and 2007, Rayder appeared on the cover of Vogue Italia six times (November 2002, November 2003, January 2004, July 2004, January 2005, and January 2007) and she also has appeared on the cover of Vogue Espa√±a (September 2006, April 2008, March 2009) and German Vogue (July 2005). Other cover highlights include Elle France (July 2000 and September 2008) and Elle Italy (February 2001). In January 2008, she left, DNA, Viva, and Why Not to sign with IMG worldwide. As of February 2009, Rayder was represented by IMG in both New York and Paris, Why Not Model Management in Milan and 2pm Model Management Copenhagen. Personal Rayder went to visit her sister Frankie in New York City in 1995 and moved to Tribeca. Frankie and Missy formerly lived across the street from each other in New York. During the September 11 attacks, Missy still lived in Tribeca. The Rayder sisters (along with a third sister named Molly) appeared in holiday ads for Gap as siblings in 2003 to the tune of \\"Put a Little Love in Your Heart\\". In later years, Rayder and Frankie appeared in Gap holiday ads as a pair. There are a total of four Rayder sisters. They have one brother and their father continued to live in River Falls in 2004. Along with Maggie Rizer, Karen Elson, and Oluchi Onweagba, Rayder was part of a team of Elite models who cut their billing rate by as much as 75% to appear at a benefit for the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia in 2001. In 2006, Rayder was the subject of photographic work that served as the basis for sketches and a pastel drawings that appeared at a benefit for the Whitney Museum of American Art before being placed at the Calvin Klein flagship store on Madison Avenue. The theme of the works were Art from fashion.

Education and career The New York City-born AfrickU.S. Public Records Index, Volume 1 (Provo, UT: Ancestry.com Operations, Inc.), 2010. received a Bachelor of Arts from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 1973, and two years later a Juris Doctor from the University of North Carolina School of Law. From 1975 to 1976, he was a law clerk to James Gulotta, a judge of the Louisiana 4th Circuit Court of Appeals. He entered the private practice of law in Louisiana from 1976 to 1977, and was thereafter Director of the Career Criminal Bureau for the Orleans Parish District Attorney's Office from 1977 to 1980. He returned to private practice until 1982, and then became an Assistant United States Attorney for the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana until 1990. In 1986, he began teaching as an instructor at the University of New Orleans. District court service Africk became a United States Magistrate Judge for the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana in 1990. After the election of Bill Clinton in 1992, Africk changed his party affiliation from Republican to Democrat. He did not obtain nomination for a judgeship under Clinton. On January 23, 2002, by which time he had returned to Republican registration, Africk was nominated by President George W. Bush to a seat on the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana vacated by Edith Brown Clement. He was confirmed by the United States Senate on April 17, 2002, and received his commission of office the same day. More conservative Republicans opposed Bush's selection of Africk, whose past Democratic affiliation caused them discomfiture; the publication Gambit Weekly reported that shipbuilder Donald Thomas \\"Boysie\\" Bollinger of Lockport in Lafourche Parish, a major GOP donor and the son of former party chairman Donald G. Bollinger, was the driving force behind the Africk nomination. Notable case On March 31, 2011, Judge Africk sentenced former New Orleans police officer David Warren to twenty-five years and nine months in federal prison on a federal civil rights violation of committing manslaughter with a firearm in the case of the death of Henry Glover. Africk sentenced another former officer, Greg MacRae, to seventeen years and three months in prison and three years of supervised release on obstruction of justice and another civil rights charge. \\"Henry Glover was not at the strip mall to commit suicide. He was there to retrieve some baby clothing. You killed a man. Despite your tendentious arguments to the contrary, it was no mistake,\\" Africk told Warren. Other interests Judge Africk served as the 54th president of the Sugar Bowl Committee in 2011-2012, and oversaw the game in which the University of Michigan Wolverines defeated Virginia Tech in an overtime win. Thereafter he helped in the presentation of the Sugar Bowl Trophy to Brady Hoke and the Wolverines team.

Valdesoto occupies a wide plateau or valley surrounded by mountains, with masses of trees, and is crossed by several creeks and streams, including one that crosses the parish from north to south, with the same name as Valdesoto. The main routes are the AS-1, called Minera Autov√≠a between Gij√≥n and Mieres, the AS-246, called the Carretera Carbonera between Gij√≥n and Langreo, provincial roads and SI-8 SI-11 SI-16 .

Game playObject= The object of the game is to evolve a character from prehistory through modern times by gaining skills, intelligence, stamina and knowledge applicable to the age. To accomplish these goals, a player takes on various trades and engages in quests. =Ages= The game is divided into ten ages: * Age 1: Prehistory * Age 2: The Celts * Age 3: The Egyptians * Age 4: The Greeks * Age 5: The Kingdom Age * Age 6: The Cowboy * Age 7: Prohibition * Age 8: The Hippies * Age 9: The Twenty-first century * Age 10: The Unknown To date the game is released up to age 6 with age 7 currently under development, the release date is yet to be known. Age One focuses on the prehistoric era of the human evolutionary cycle, where the player essentially learns how to function as a cave man or woman. The game has more of a single player focus with the function to private message other players. the aim is to gain strength, stamina and skill points as well as complete the designated quests. After completing a specific set of goals the player can progress to Age 2. Age Two is a bit more in depth compared to age one; the concept of government and hierarchy is introduced. As well as completing quests and developing your character, the player can immerse themselves into the game on a deeper level. Players can now marry, gain reputation ranks and operate as healers, elect chiefs of the different tribes, engage in politics, peace and warfare. There are a variety of guilds to gain access to but players will either have to earn a place or be appointed. Guilds such as the robbers or Mercenaries guild will have to be earned through gaining higher ranks on player statistics boards. However, places in guilds such as the spies guild can be obtained if approved by the current clan chief. Age Three essentially combines the same system as age 2. However, marriage, childbirth and raising children within marriage is introduced, as well as a more intricate system to the government. Officials and generals can be appointed within the game to involve more people than just the chief. This progression of facilities within the ages should reflect the development of the human during their evolution through time. Age Four differs from the early ages in that it encourages players to log in several times per day. The character's energy recovers hour by hour, and they must build up experience points (XP) to progress to higher levels and gain access to new features of the game. Players can travel between the various Greek islands, trade resources between clans, and improve their dwellings. Age Five is the Kingdom Age set during the medieval ages. Game play is very similar to the Greek Age with a few added quests and ways to get experience. Age Six was released on August 1, 2011. Due to behind the scenes conflicts maintenance ceased around 2013 (chat ceased working much earlier); bugs multiplied, many tasks could not be completed, so evolution became impossible. No one has heard from the remaining developer since April 2014, when he posted to the French forum that he was back at work on the game and all would be repaired. Shortly afterwards Age 4 (Greek Age) disappeared and the domain name expired. In October 2014 the game clock stopped for ages 1, 2, and 3 (they are on one server; the other ages have individual servers). In early December 2018, the site was infected with malware via an iframe exploit. This is the status of the game as of December 2018.

Education and career Adams was born in Orrville, Ohio, and received a Bachelor of Science degree from Bowling Green State University in 1978, followed by a Juris Doctor from University of Akron School of Law in 1983. He was a law clerk to W. F. Spicer of the Ohio Court of Common Pleas from 1983 to 1984. He then entered the private practice of law in Ohio until 1999, also working as an Assistant prosecutor in the Summit County Prosecutor's Office, from 1986 to 1989. He was a judge to the Summit County Court of Common Pleas, Ohio from 1999 to 2003. District court service On January 7, 2003, Adams was nominated by President George W. Bush to a seat on the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio vacated by George Washington White. Adams was confirmed by the United States Senate on February 10, 2003, and received his commission on February 12, 2003. Dispute with Mayor Don Plusquellic On February 3, 2015, Akron Mayor Don Plusquellic wrote a letter to Judge Adams, asking Judge Adams to recuse himself from any cases involving the city of Akron. In the letter, Plusquellic argues that Judge Adams displays a \\"personal negative bias towards me, and more significantly the City of Akron.\\" He points to two cases in front of Judge Adams, one involving promotions within the city's fire department, and another case against the EPA dealing with sewer runoff problems. Mayor Plusquellic accuses Judge Adams of judicial impropriety when Adams was a state court judge, saying \\"Your bias towards me personally was evident on occasions when you were trying to please the Summit County chair of the Republican Party. During a meeting in your office, while you were Common Pleas Judge, you tried to persuade a top law enforcement official to go after me and my wife because you thought I influenced someone to give my wife a job at the Oriana House.\\" Mayor Plusquellic ends the letter by saying \\"You have created an atmosphere where nobody believes that you are ruling on these cases based on the law, but rather, on your obvious bias towards me and the City.\\" In a follow-up article from the editorial board of the Akron Beacon Journal, the board noted that Judge Adams is unable to respond to the allegations because of judicial ethics. The Akron Bar Association argued the Mayor should have filed a formal motion with the court, rather than \\"delivering blows from the op-ed page of the newspaper.\\" The editorial board goes on to argue that \\"On too many occasions, Judge Adams has failed to measure up. Many who practice and work in the federal court long have been dismayed. They have seen and discussed the displays of poor temper, the careless treatment, the absence of reason, the mean spirit. This behavior has become a problem for the Akron community.\\" The editorial board cites two cases where Judge Adams was overturned by the 6th Circuit Court of Appeals. Per the editorial board: \\"Recall that in November 2013, the federal appeals court in Cincinnati reversed, vacated and dismissed the public sanctions Judge Adams imposed on a public defender. A three-judge panel unanimously found no basis for what the judge did, or any hint of the bad faith the judge claimed that he saw. His actions were reckless.\\" The editorial board goes on by saying: \\"A year ago, the same appeals court took the rare step of removing a federal disabilities act case from Judge Adams. A three-judge panel, again unanimously, acknowledged that 'reassignment is an extraordinary power,' yet it had little choice, the judge revealing 'such a high degree of favoritism or antagonism as to make fair judgment impossible.' These are not isolated episodes. They help in setting the backdrop for Mayor Plusquellic taking his extraordinary step.\\" Controversies In 2013, the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals admonished Adams for publicly reprimanding federal public defender Debra Migdal for issuing subpoenas in a criminal case, writing that the judge abused his discretion and that he \\"relied on clearly erroneous factual findings.\\" Two judicial conduct panels have found Adams committed misconduct when he issued an order in 2013 to a magistrate judge who missed a deadline to submit a report and recommendation in a Social Security case. Both reports also referenced other examples of problematic behavior, from being unwilling to engage with his colleagues on the bench, being hostile toward magistrate judges or, in one instance, blocking in an intern's car when the intern accidentally parked in Adams' space. In 2016, the panels ordered Adams to undergo a mental-health examination, and the judge sued in federal court in Washington, D.C. to fight the order. In 2015, the 6th Circuit Court of Appeals removed Adams from hearing a lawsuit filed by a group of firefighters against the city of Akron alleging discrimination in the city's promotion process. The court ruled that Adams \\"contributed greatly\\" to delays in what ended up being litigation that stretched out over a decade. The Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals in 2016 forced Adams to recuse himself from a criminal case involving a man charged with creating and passing counterfeit money. Adams had refused to step aside even after the defendant claimed he frequently used heroin with the judge's brother and nephew. In 2018, a federal appeals court removed Adams from hearing the case of two men arrested with more than 200 pounds of cocaine to Cleveland, saying that Adams appeared ready to give harsh sentences before he had all the necessary information. The panel ruled the case must be reassigned \\"to maintain the integrity of our judicial system and to ensure that these cases are heard by a judge whose impartiality cannot reasonably be questioned.\\" ReferencesSources * Category:1955 births Category:Living people Category:Ohio state court judges Category:Judges of the United States District Court for the Northern District of Ohio Category:United States district court judges appointed by George W.

Early years Robert Anderson was born in Anguilla, Mississippi, and moved to Chicago with his family as a child. During his childhood, Anderson learned piano by ear and assisted Roberta Martin with coaching the Sunday school choir at the Metropolitan Community Church. In 1933, Anderson became one of the original Roberta Martin Singers. Because he didn't like their busy travel schedule, Anderson initially left the group in 1939. Musical career Robert Anderson began his solo career in 1939 with R. L. Knowles. They formed the Knowles and Anderson Singers and traveled together until 1941, when Anderson rejoined the Roberta Martin Singers and stayed with them until 1943. Anderson possessed a baritone voice coupled with a style often compared to that of Bing Crosby or Billy Eckstine. Unlike many of his Chicago gospel contemporaries, Anderson was not known for stage antics, shouting, or other movements while singing. Anderson's style contained very little physical movement, with much attention paid to phrasing, tone, and dynamic style. In 1942, he formed Good Shepherd Music House, which he based in Gary, Indiana. Good Shepherd Music House published his compositions, such as \\"Prayer Changes Things\\", \\"Why Should I Worry\\", and \\"Oh Lord, Is It I?\\" In 1943, he performed \\"Something Within\\" at the National Baptist Convention. After that performance, his career began to take off. In 1947, Anderson formed a group that would back him and share lead vocals. This group was known as his Gospel Caravan, which would later be renamed The Caravans in 1951. Anderson and The Caravans' first recordings were made in August 1949 and released in September 1949 on the Miracle Records label. In 1951, Anderson and The Caravans joined the United Records label. During an April 18, 1952 recording session, Anderson and The Caravans split ways. After the breakup, Anderson continued to record with a new group of singers called The Robert Anderson Singers. In 1954, Anderson and the Anderson singers joined Apollo Records. In 1955, Anderson began recording as a solo artist, recording and performing sporadically through the mid-1990s for labels such as Vee Jay Records and Savoy Records. Anderson served as choir director at the Hertzell United Methodist Church until his death in 1995. Death Robert Anderson died in Hazel Crest, Illinois on June 15, 1995. Anderson was 76 years old.

E. delfsi is the only known species within the genus.  Discovery and history  The holotype, Eutretauranosuchus delfsi, was discovered by Dr. Edwin Delfs in 1957 among remains recovered from the Morrison Formation in Canon City, Colorado. It was first described in detail by Charles Mook in 1967. The fossil remains consisted of an almost-complete skull as well as some limb bones. The name Eutretauranosuchus was given by Delfs upon its discovery in reference to its \\"doubly pierced palate\\". The holotype specimen was named E. delfsi by Mook in tribute to Delfs. Mook found E. delfsi differs significantly from previously described Mesosuchian crocodiles. This specimen was deemed part of a new species because of its extremely elongated internal narial aperture, which was notably longer than those of previously described specimens of similar size. Mook also described an additional, smaller opening located anterior to the internal nares, divided by the palatine processes, which was hypothesized to have entered the narial passage. According to Mook, these features were an indication of a wide-ranged specialization among Goniopholididae and indicated the described specimen is a holotype for a new genus. Recent findings suggest that Mook's original description of an additional nasal opening was incorrect and that this opening was part of an elongated choana that is extremely constricted medially by the expansion of the palatines, giving the illusion of a separate anteriorly located opening due to its hourglass-shape‚Äîas is commonly described in other E. delfsi, Amphicotylus lucasii and A. gilmorei specimens.  Description and osteology  Jawbone of closely related Goniopholis sp. from the Morrison Formation, Upper Jurassic, Dinosaur National Monument, Utah = Skull = Characteristics of E. Delfi skulls include an elongated and platyrostral skull, posterolateral depressions on the alveolar maxillary process, minimal lateral undulation of the tooth row (maxillary), broadened nasals located anteriorly to the prefrontals, a lack of contact between the nasals and external nares, a flattened and broad innerfenestral bar with rims that are raised along the supratemporal fenestra, and a nasopharyngeal septum formed by the anterior divergence of the vomeral processes. The lacrimal bone is rectangular and in dorsal view has an anteroposterior length that is two times its width. The lacrimal is contacted by the prefrontal laterally along its length, which separates the prefrontal from the nasal. A large postorbital bar with a triangular cross-section creates a separation between the orbit and the infratemporal fenestra. The quadratojugal has two regions: a smaller dorsal part that lacks dermal pitting, and a larger ventral region that is pitted and forms the bottom half of the infratemporal process, creating a significant indentation that is considered characteristic of this genus. = Palate = While the majority of Goniopholididae have historically been categorized by flattened snouts and posterolaterally located maxillary depressions, there remains great variation within their palatal anatomy. Most Morrison Formation goniopholidids display an ‚Äòincomplete‚Äô secondary palate, in which there is no ventral floor in the nasopharyngeal passage. Differences among palatal anatomy have been observed between Goniopholididae taxa found from the Cretaceous in Europe and species found in North America. European specimens such as G. simus and G.siplingi have a secondary bony palate formed from the palatines and maxillary processes. North American goniopholidids have maxillae and palatines that do not contact, resulting in a more open palate and a ventrally exposed bony nasopharyngeal passage. = Post-cranial skeleton = The postcranial skeleton of Goniopholididae is characterized by amphicoelous vertebrae, two rows of paravertebral osteoderms with \\"peg and groove\\" articulation and polygonal ventrally located osteoderms. Goniopholididae commonly have a closed paravertebral armor bracing system. The anteroposteriorly located crest on the ventral surfaces of Goniopholididae dorsal osteoderms has been hypothesized to be evidence that the epaxial musculature attached medially to a single paravertebral osteoderm, which is different from the three groups of epaxial musculature that attach to separate osteoderms in extant crocodylians.  Geological and paleoenvironmental information  Morrison Formation, Colorado Eutretauranosuchus is currently known from specimens found in the Upper Jurassic Dry Mesa Dinosaur Quarry in Canon City, Colorado; the Brushy Basin Member in Western Colorado; and the Bone Cabin Quarry site in Wyoming‚Äîall of which are parts of the Morrison Formation. Other Gonopholididae appear in strata from the Early Jurassic to Late Cretaceous. The family is classed as a Laurasian group, with specimens located in North America, Europe, and South- East Asia. Specimens from this group are often found in estuarine and freshwater deposits.  Locomotion, paleoenvironment and feeding  Goniopholidid crocodilians, including Eutretauranosuchus, are widely categorized as semi-aquatic forms.Foster, J.R. Paleoecological Analysis of the Vertebrate Fauna of the Morrison Formation (Upper Jurassic), Rocky Mountain Region, U.S.A.: Bulletin 23. United States, New Mexico Museum of Natural History & Science, 2003. pp 28-37. Preserved specimens indicate Eutretauranosuchus are moderately sized with an average estimated weight of 50‚Äì60 kg. The size and length of Goniopholididae specimens found in the Morrison Formation, as well as striated teeth, support the hypothesis that Eutretauranosuchus were carnivorous, feeding on prey such as insects, fish, small reptiles, mammals and dinosaurs.  Phylogenetic analysis  E. delfsi is the only recognized species of Eutretauranosuchus. Other genera of Goniopholididae include Amphicotylus, Goniopholis, Sunosuchus, and Calsoyasuchus. The exact phylogenetic placement of Eutretauranosuchus remains ambiguous. Phylogenetic analysis by Smith et al. in 2010 provides evidence that Eutretauranosuchus, Calsoyasuchus and Sunosuchus are closely related, and these findings are widely supported. However, while many publications support the phylogenetic placement of Eutretauranosuchus within the family of Goniopholididae, there is debate over whether it is more closely related to Goniopholis or Sunosuchus. Alternatively, phylogenetic assessment by J.R. Foster in 2006 considers Eutretauranosuchus to be most closely related to Pholidosaurus and dyrosauridae, and belonging to a larger clade that includes Bernissartia, Eusuchians and Goniopholis.Foster, J.R. 2006. The mandible of a Juvenile Goniopholidid (Crocodylefomes) From The Morrison Formation (upper Jurassic) of Wyoming. Paleontology and Geology of the Upper Jurassic Morrison Formation. New Mexico Museum of Natural History and Science Bulletin 36. Pp 101-105 Further research is needed to clarify these disputes. Phylogenetic analysis by (Allen, 2012) claims that North American goniopholidid forms are monophyletic, excluding all other goniopholidids. It is proposed that this North America specific clade can be defined by channel-like, extremely elongated choanae that completely separate the palatines and that within this clade exists a further distinguished clade of the forms found in the Morrison Formation, which are defined by triangular prefrontals that rostrally extend past the lacrimals, preventing lacrimal contact with the nasals. A recent study re-evaluated evolutionary history in relation to the Triassic-Jurassic mass extinction event. It concluded that the basal phylogenetic positioning of the goniopholidid crocodylomorph Calsoyasuchus valliceps suggests a substantial number of ghost lineages that should exist at the base of the crocodylomorphs. Furthermore, they reported an increase in crocodylomorph disparity across the Triassic-Jurassic boundary, which suggests there was rapid radiation of adaptation among crocodylomorphs. They hypothesize this was a result of the extinction's \\"decimation\\" of pseudosuchian and tetrapod lineages. The study concludes that the extinction was important for the evolutionary success of Goniopholididae.

Forced to leave the South, a family falls apart amid the harsh realities of Northern inner city life in this 1902 examination of the forces that extinguish the dreams of African Americans. Plot Berry Hamilton, an emancipated black man, works as a butler for a wealthy white man Maurice Oakley. Berry lives in a small cottage a short distance away from the Oakley's place of residence. Berry lives with his wife, Fannie, and two children, Joe and Kitty. During a farewell dinner for Maurice's younger brother, Francis Oakley, it becomes known that a large sum of money has disappeared from Oakley residence due to Francis apparently being careless and leaving the key in the safe. Maurice soon convinces himself that Berry must have stolen the money. A court finds Berry guilty of the theft and sentences him to ten years of hard labor. Maurice and his wife expel Fannie, Joe, and Kitty from the cottage. Unable to find work, Fannie and her children decide to move to New York. Once in New York, Joe begins work and starts regularly visiting the Banner Club. He begins dating an entertainer from the club named Hattie Sterling. To Fannie's disapproval, Hattie helps Kitty to find employment as a singer and actress. Joe's situation quickly declines and he becomes an alcoholic. Hattie breaks the relationship. Completely degraded, Joe strangles Hattie. Later, he confesses to the murder and finds himself in prison. With her husband and son in prison, Fannie is distraught. Kitty convinces Fannie to marry a man named Mr. Gibson. Francis Oakley, who left for Paris to become an artist, sends a message to Maurice Oakley. When Maurice receives the letter, he postulates that it could be a message informing him of the artistic successes of Francis. To his dismay, it describes how Francis stole the money and he wishes for Berry Hamilton to be released from prison. Maurice decides that he will not announce Berry's innocence in hopes of preserving the honor of his brother and himself. Mr. Skaggs, an acquaintance of Joe at the Banner Club, overhears the story of Berry Hamilton's conviction for theft. As a writer for New York's Universe, Mr. Skaggs postulates that if he can prove Berry's innocence, he will have a popular article for the publisher. He travels to the hometown of the Hamilton's to converse with Maurice Oakley. He first meets with a man named Colonel Saunders who tells him that he believes Berry is innocent, the money was simply lost, and to protect the secret, Maurice Oakley carries the money in his \\"secret\\" pocket at all times. To gain entry into the Oakley residence, Skaggs lies about having a letter from Francis. Mr. Skaggs forcibly removes Francis's letter from Maurice's secret pocket. With Francis's letter, Mr. Skaggs is able to have Berry pardoned after five years in prison. Mr. Skaggs brings Berry to New York. Soon, Berry finds out about his son, daughter, and wife's new husband. Hopeless, Berry plans to murder his wife's suitor. To Berry's fortune, he finds that Mr. Gibson has been killed in a fight at a racetrack. Broken down by the hardships of the city, Fannie and Berry decide to move back to the cottage near the Oakley residence when the apologetic Mrs. Oakley begs them to return. Influence Newspaper ad for film Robert Levy, a prolific producer of race films in the 1920s, earned the rights to adapt The Sport of the Gods; his film version of the novel debuted in Chicago in 1921. While the most prominent roles went to black actors, Levy also selected whites for small parts, marking a breakthrough in desegregation in the entertainment industry. Billboard magazine carried a notice for the opening on its main motion picture page, making it the first time this level of recognition had ever been paid to a race film.

Life Boys was born at Deal on 7 Sept. 1735. He was of an old Kent family (Hasted, History of Kent, iii. 109), being the eldest son of Commodore William Boys, R.N., lieutenant-governor of Greenwich Hospital (c.1700‚Äì1774), by his wife, Elizabeth Pearson of Deal (Gent. Mag. lxxiii. pt. i. 421-3). About 1755 he was a surgeon at Sandwich, Kent, where he was noted for his untiring explorations of Richborough Castle, for skill in deciphering ancient manuscripts and inscriptions, for his zeal in collecting antiquities connected with Sandwich, and for his studies in astronomy, natural history, and mathematics. In 1759 he married Elizabeth Wise, a daughter of Henry Wise, one of the Sandwich jurats (ibid.), and by her he had two children. In 1761 he was elected jurat, acting with his wife's father. In the same year, 1761, she died, and in the next year, 1762, he married Jane Fuller, coheiress of her uncle, one John Paramor of Statenborough (ibid.) In 1767 Boys was mayor of Sandwich. In 1774 his father died at Greenwich (Nichols, Lit. Anecd. ix. 24 n.) In 1782 he again served as mayor. In 1783 his second wife died, having borne him eight or nine children (ib., and Hasted, Hist. of Kent, iv. 222 n.) In 1796 he gave up his Sandwich practice and went to reside at Walmer, but returned to Sandwich at the end of three years, in 1799. His health had now declined. He had apoplectic attacks in 1799, and died of apoplexy on 15 March 1803, aged 68. Boys was buried in St. Clement's Church, Sandwich, where there is a Latin epitaph to his memory, a suggestion for a monument with some doggerel verses, from a correspondent to the Gentleman's Magazine (lxxiii. pt. ii. 612), having fallen through. He was a member of the Linnean Society, and a contributor to the Gentleman's Magazine (Index, vol. iii. preface, p. lxxiv). A tern found by him at Sandwich was named Sterna boysii, after him, by John Latham in his Index Ornithologicus. Works His first publication in 1775 protested against a scheme for draining a large tract of the neighbouring land, which it was thought would destroy Sandwich harbour. Boys drew it up as one of the commissioners of sewers, on behalf of the corporation, and it was published at Canterbury in 1775 anonymously (Gent. Mag. lxxiii. pt. i. 421-3). In 1776 Boys was elected a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries (F.S.A., London). In 1783 Boys furnished the Rev. John Duncombe with much matter relating to Reculver, printed in Duncombe's Antiquities of Reculver. In 1784 was published Testacea Minuta Rariora, 4to, being plates and description of the tiny shells found on the seashore near Sandwich, by Boys, \\"that inquisitive naturalist\\" (Introd. p. i). The book was put together by George Walker, Boys himself being too much occupied by his profession. In 1786 Boys issued proposals for publishing his Collections for a History of Sandwich at a price which should only cover its expenses, and placed his materials in the hands of the printers (Nichols, Lit. Ill. vi. 613). In 1787 Boys published an account of the survivors of the Luxborough Galley, a case of cannibalism, in which his father (Commodore Boys) had been one of the men compelled to resort to this horrible means of preserving life. Boys had a series of pictures hung up in his parlour portraying the whole of the terrible circumstances (Pennant, in his Journey from London to the Isle of Wight). Of this Account, as a separate publication, there is now no trace; but it appears in full in a history of Greenwich Hospital;History of Greenwich Hospital, by John Cooke and John Maule, 1789, pp. 110 et seq. six small paintings that were in the council room of the hospital (presumably replicas of those seen by Pennant in the possession of William Boys) represent this passage, they are now held in the hospital's collection at the National Maritime Museum, In 1788 appeared the first part of Sandwich, and in 1789 Boys was appointed surgeon to the sick and wounded seamen at Deal. Over the second part of Sandwich there was considerable delay and anxiety (Letter from Denne, Nichols's Lit. Ill. vi. 613); but in 1792 the volume was issued at much pecuniary loss to Boys. In 1792 Boys also sent Dr. Simmons some Observations on Kit's Coity House, which were read at the Society of Antiquaries, and appeared in vol. xi. of Arch√¶ologia.

The Austro-Hungarians engaged in a significant offensive over the Drina river at the western Serbian border, resulting in numerous skirmishes (the Battle of Maƒçkov Kamen and the Battle of Guƒçevo being the heaviest ones). In early October, the Serbian Army was forced to retreat, and later regrouped to fight in the subsequent Battle of Kolubara. Prelude Serbian soldiers during the battle After being defeated in the Battle of Cer in August 1914, the Austro-Hungarian army retreated over the Drina river back into Bosnia and Syrmia. Under pressure from its allies, Serbia conducted a limited offensive across the Sava river into the Austro-Hungarian region of Syrmia. Meanwhile, the Timok First Division of the Serbian Second Army suffered a heavy defeat in a diversionary crossing, suffering around 6,000 casualties while inflicting only 2,000. With most of his forces in Bosnia, general Oskar Potiorek decided that the best way to stop the Serbian offensive was to launch another invasion into Serbia to force the Serbs to recall their troops to defend their much smaller homeland. The offensive September 7 brought a renewed Austro-Hungarian attack from the west, across the river Drina, this time with both the Fifth Army in Maƒçva and the Sixth Army further south. The initial attack by the Fifth Army was repelled by the Serbian Second Army, with 4,000 Austro-Hungarian casualties, but the stronger Sixth Army managed to surprise the Serbian Third Army and gained a foothold into Serbian territory. After some units from the Serbian Second Army were sent to bolster the Third, the Austro-Hungarian Fifth Army also managed to establish a bridgehead with a renewed attack. At that time, Field Marshal Radomir Putnik withdrew the First Army from Syrmia (against much popular opposition) and used it to deliver a fierce counterattack against the Sixth Army that initially went well, but finally bogged down in a bloody four- day fight for a peak of the Jagodnja mountain called Maƒçkov Kamen, in which both sides suffered horrendous losses in successive frontal attacks and counterattacks. The two Serbian divisions lost around 11,000 men, while Austro-Hungarian losses were probably comparable. Field Marshal Putnik ordered a retreat into the surrounding hills and the front settled in a month and a half of trench warfare, which was highly unfavourable to the Serbs, who possessed heavy artillery that was largely obsolete, had short ammunition stocks, limited shell production (having only a single factory producing around 100 shells a day) and also a lack of proper footwear, since the vast majority of infantry wore the traditional (though state-issued) opanaks, while the Austro-Hungarians had soak-proof leather boots. Most of the war material was supplied by the Allies, who were short themselves. In such a situation, Serbian artillery quickly became almost silent, while the Austro-Hungarians steadily increased their fire. Serbian daily casualties reached 100 soldiers from all causes in some divisions. During the first weeks of trench warfare, the Serbian U≈æice Army (one strengthened division) and the Montenegrin Sanjak Army (roughly a division) conducted an abortive offensive into Bosnia. In addition, both sides conducted a few local attacks, most of which were soundly defeated.

The law regulates the nationality and citizenship status of all people who live in Bangladesh as well as all people who are of Bangladeshi descent. It allows the children of expatriates, foreigners as well as residents in Bangladesh to examine their citizenship status and if necessary, apply for and obtain citizenship of Bangladesh. The primary law relating to Bangladesh citizenship is The Citizenship Act, 1951 originally the Pakistan Citizenship Act 1951, later amended by a number of legislative orders introduced by the Government of Bangladesh.  Citizenship Upon the founding of the state= The territory that is modern day Bangladesh was a part of Pakistan called East Pakistan before 1972. Previously Pakistan, East Pakistan (modern day Bangladesh), and India had been part of British India until independence from Britain and the partition of India and Pakistan into two separate countries in 1947. Before the advent of Bangladeshi nationality law, Pakistani nationality law and British nationality law would have applied. Upon the founding of the state, Bangladesh law granted citizenship to persons who were permanent residents of the territories that became Bangladesh on 25 March 1971. The wording of the order makes separate mention of those whose father or grandfather were born in the territory and others, but it is unclear that there is any distinction in law between those groups. The law also describes Bengalis who were in West Pakistan during the 1971 war and facing obstacles over returning as permanent residents eligible for Bangladeshi citizenship. = Jus sanguinis = According to the Citizenship Act 1951, one method of acquiring Bangladeshi nationality is via jus sanguinis (Citizenship by right of blood). This means one may acquire citizenship regardless of whether they were born on Bangladeshi sovereign territory or not. Bangladeshi citizenship is provided primarily jus sanguinis, or through bloodline, irrespective of the place or the legitimacy of the birth. Therefore, any child born to a Bangladeshi woman illegitimately outside Bangladeshi soil would still be a Bangladeshi citizen, whereas a child born to two non-nationals in Bangladesh would not. This method is restricted if the child's parents also acquired their nationality through naturalisation or by descent. Note, however that the Act states that for this to be the case, if the parent from whom the citizenship is to be inherited obtained their Bangladeshi citizenship by descent (rather than birth, for example) then the birth must be registered at the nearest Bangladeshi Embassy or Mission.https://www.refworld.org/cgi- bin/texis/vtx/rwmain/opendocpdf.pdf?reldoc=y&docid;=543d0d724 = Jus soli = Citizenship is acquired jus soli (Citizenship by right of birth within the territory), or at birth, when the identity or nationality of the parents is unknown. In this regard, the child is assumed to be born to Bangladeshi nationals, and hence, given citizenship upon birth. However, this does not apply to the children of enemy aliens born in Bangladesh and it also does not apply to people residing illegally in Bangladesh or refugees in Bangladesh. Enemy aliens are people who do not recognize or refuse to recognize the sovereignty, territorial integrity and independence of the People's Republic of Bangladesh. Enemy aliens are also people whose country of citizenship is, or was, at war with Bangladesh since the declaration of independence in March 1971 by the father of the nation Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. Jus soli citizenship is conferred upon some Urdu-speaking people of Bangladesh since May 2008 by a High Court verdict (see below). = Naturalization = Naturalization is permitted by the Citizenship Law of Bangladesh. Any adult of good character who is married to a Bangladeshi and residing legally in Bangladesh for a period of five years; competent in Bengali language; and intending to reside in Bangladesh can apply for naturalisation. Naturalization may be conferred categorically or without certain rights or privileges, such as the right to stand in parliamentary elections as a candidate. It is also conferred at the discretion of the Government of Bangladesh. Any person who is a citizen of a nation where Bangladeshis are not allowed to naturalise (for instance, Saudi Arabia) is not eligible for naturalisation. Naturalization of a foreigner does not automatically extend to their foreign children. However, they may apply as soon as the naturalised person has taken the citizenship oath of allegiance. If denied, a person can appeal against the decision within thirty days, where they will be heard. They cannot appeal if citizenship is conferred without certain rights or privileges. If accepted, a naturalised citizen must take an oath of allegiance within thirty days of the grant. A person is considered naturalised only after the oath. = Dual citizenship = Dual citizenship is permitted under certain circumstances where the person is not a citizen of a SAARC country. Such dual citizens of Bangladesh can apply for a Dual Nationality Certificate which makes it legal to use a foreign passport however, people are not prosecuted for not applying for such certificate. It is also possible to enter Bangladesh as a person of Bangladeshi origin, or a spouse or child of a person of Bangladeshi origin via a No Visa Required (NVR) seal, stamp or sticker on their foreign passports. An eligible person can apply for the NVR stamp/sticker at any Bangladeshi mission overseas. NVR exceptions include citizens of SAARC countries. = Citizenship by investment = People who invest in Bangladesh can acquire permanent residency status by investing a minimum of US$75,000 in non-repatriable funds. In addition to many other benefits, permanent residency allows a person to stay in Bangladesh for as long as they want, as well as enter and exit Bangladesh unlimited times without requiring a visa. Citizenship is available by investing a minimum of US$500,000 or by transferring US$1,000,000 in non-repatriable funds to any recognised financial institution in Bangladesh. Although the initial investment to obtain permanent residency or citizenship is non-repatriable, profits, dividends and salaries are repatriable overseas. Under its export oriented, private sector led growth strategy and liberal Industrial Policy, Bangladesh offers potential investors and entrepreneurs generous opportunities, tax exemptions and many other incentives for investment. = Honorary citizenship = The government of Bangladesh reserves the right to grant honorary citizenship to foreign nationals who make exemplary contributions to society in Bangladesh or obtain outstanding achievements for Bangladesh, such as the honour conferred to Father Marino Rigon or Gordon Greenidge. Gordon Greenidge was appointed the head coach of the Bangladesh national cricket team in 1997. His guidance helped the Bangladesh men's cricket team win the 1997 ICC Trophy beating 22 other nations, which also ensured qualification to the 1999 ICC Cricket World Cup. Participation in their first ever cricket world cup changed Bangladesh cricket forever and lead to Test cricket status for the Bangladesh national cricket team in 2000. Gordon Greenidge was conferred honorary citizenship of Bangladesh by the Prime Minister, Sheikh Hasina, for these outstanding achievements of winning the 1997 ICC Trophy and simultaneously qualifying for the cricket world cup. Travel freedom Visa requirements for Bangladeshi citizens As of 22 May 2018, Bangladeshi citizens had visa-free or visa on arrival access to 41 countries and territories, ranking the Bangladeshi passport 94th in the world according to the Visa Restrictions Index.  Relinquishing nationality  Nationality can be revoked only if it was conferred upon a person by naturalisation, unless the person wilfully surrenders citizenship. It can be revoked if the naturalised alien provided false information in his/her application. It can also be revoked if the person is sentenced to prison for at least a year or fined at least BDT 1,000 (about US$14) within five years of the naturalisation, or if the person loses contact with Bangladesh for at least seven years. Defection by trade and communication with an enemy at war or remaining a citizen of an enemy state at war will also result in denaturalisation. Controversial issues Ghulam Azam = Ghulam Azam was a leader of Jamaat-e-Islami during the Liberation War of Bangladesh. He moved to Lahore, Pakistan, during the war, held a Pakistani passport, applying repeatedly for a Bangladeshi nationality until 1978, when he returned to Bangladesh on a tourist visa. He stayed in the same visa for 16 years until 1994. He then obtained Bangladeshi citizenship and a Bangladeshi passport during Khaleda Zia's tenure. In a controversial verdict, the High Court, and later, the Supreme Court held that Ghulam Azam was a citizen by descent and domicile since the commencement of the Bangladesh Citizenship Order. = Stranded Pakistanis = The independence of Bangladesh from Pakistan in 1971 led to the abandonment in the Bengali-majority state of around half a million \\"stranded Pakistanis\\", colloquially called Biharis, who traced their ethno- linguistic heritage mostly to the Bihar region. Biharis who maintained that they were Bangladeshis were granted citizenship by the Bangladesh Citizenship Order 1972. Those who maintained that they were Pakistanis, however, were considered non-nationals, as well as those who found their names at the Red Cross list of refugees. Despite official promises, neither Pakistan nor Bangladesh recognised them as citizens until May 2008, when the High Court conferred jus soli citizenship to all Urdu-speaking people born and residing in Bangladeshi territory after 1971. =Rohingya people= Several hundred thousand Rohingya people fled Myanmar for Bangladesh including 250,000 in 1978 as a result of the King Dragon operation in Arakan. In an attempt to counter the Burmese claims that the Rohingyas are Bangladeshis, the Bangladesh Government amended the Citizenship Order in 1982 to officially declare all the Rohingya refugees non-nationals. The Rohingya refugees are unable to return to Myanmar in fear of the military junta.

On a lake, pond, or other stationary body of water, ice forms undisturbed and generally does not move as long as the entire surface of the body of water is frozen. When a river freezes, water flow typically continues beneath the ice, exerting pressure on it. If the ice fractures, pieces of ice torn free by the river's current will collide with stationary or slower-moving pieces. After becoming stuck in place, the loosened pieces of ice refreeze irregularly, causing a rough, or jumbled, surface. In general, the faster a body of water flows beneath ice, the more likely it is to develop jumble ice. Temperatures near the freezing point also tend to cause jumble ice, as the higher temperatures weaken the ice structure, allowing for more pieces to be torn free before refreezing. The Yukon River in Alaska often exhibits jumble ice during the winter. Jumble ice is a hazard for winter travelers, as the broken \\"ground\\" formed by the jumble ice can cause snowmachine accidents or injuries to sled dogs.

Early years  Irina Belotelkin, n√©e Roudakoff, was born in Elisavetgrad, Ukraine (alternatively: Yelisavetgrad, now Kropyvnytskyi) to the Russian noblesse ancienne as recorded in the imperial registers of Tver. A morganatic descendant of Catherine the Great, she was a student at the Mariinsky Noble Ladies' Institute,Today, the Mariinsky Noble Ladies' Institute building is the main building of Melioration Engineering Academy Novocherkassk, Russia (former capital of the Don Cossacks). She was orphaned at the time of the Russian Civil War after her father, General Paul Roudakoff, was fatally wounded in battle; 5 days later her mother died of typhus. Her surviving brother, Paul Roudakoff, was at school in the elite Corps des Pages, and was evacuated to the banks of the Nile in Egypt with the entire Corps by their patron, King George V of England who took responsibility for the school after the assassination of his cousins. (King George V was a first cousin to both Czar Nicholas II, and his Empress, Czarina Alexandra.) Still unaware of her parents' death, and after witnessing her two sisters' deaths from starvation, the young Irina, then 8 years old, made her way over 1,000 kilometers, alone and through many privations (which forever shaped her core character), to Moscow and the Estonian embassy there, with whom her Estonian uncle Volodya Blonsky had made arrangements. After a year in Moscow, and appeals to the Estonian consul, Irina was aided in a dramatic escape from the Soviet Union, to her aunt Anna Blonsky Lassburg (1882‚Äì1940) and her husband Doctor Genrick Lassburg in Tallinn, Estonia. Eventually, after in 1929, traveling through Ellis Island and admitted as a student, of voice studies, she joined her brother who‚Äîhaving been located in Egypt by the efforts of the International Red Cross‚Äîhad settled, in 1923, in the United States. She was reunited with her Aunt Lucy (Olga) and Grandmother Natalia Blonsky (who had arrived earlier, in 1923, to New York from Constantinople (now Istanbul)).  Young lady  Irina (her early transcription was Irene) lived with her brother in Hartford, Connecticut, attending post-graduate programs at Hartford Public High School in 1931. R.J. Luke Williams, Archivist, Hartford Public High School History Project , Hartford CT Her status as a visiting student was threatened when a spurned suitor reported her for working as an artist. She was returned to Ellis Island. Through the intercession of, and personal interview with, Fannie Perkins (then New York State's industrial commissioner and soon to become the first woman to serve as Secretary of Labor) Irina won a reprieve. Later, in a ceremony conducted by Chief Justice Hughes, she became a naturalized citizen. She studied voice, drama and opera. She finished fashion design school in New York City. She was an avid, and ultimately champion, fencer. In one match, January 7, 1934, reported in the New York Times in which her brother, Paul Roudakoff, also competed, the New York Times reports: The Hartford Fencers Club women's team upset New York University's intercollegiate championship women's fencing unit, 10 to 6. Miss Irene (sic) Roudakoff, Hartford, in foils, defeated Miss Seiden, 5-4, Miss Suskin, 5-4, and Miss Mildred Atlas (substitute for Miss Hurwitz), 5-2. She lost to NYU's Miss Harriett Graver, 5-4. Later she was awarded first prize, in foils, at the 1937 N.E. Women's Championship. Irina was a masterful hostess, a discipline developed through years of dedicated practice. Here is an early example (May 5, 1943, New York Times) of what became her typical pattern of combining high-entertainment and worthy causes:  San Francisco  Irina and Kostya came to San Francisco during the Second World War, where Kostya, an engineer, was involved in the building of Liberty ships. Later, Kostya's engineering firm executed several high-profile projects. Irina's fashion design and art careers also flourished. Among Irina's devotions were ballet and opera. She often entertained friends Rudolf Nureyev, Mikhail Baryshnikov, and Sergei Leiferkus when they were in town. Natalia Makarova and Yuri Possokhov were often guests at Irina's Russian Christmas and Easter parties. She was a major contributor to the San Francisco Opera, maintaining a box during the season for many years. In later years her Easter party preparations and recipes were featured in several magazines. The March 1978 issue of Sphere ran a multi-page article entitled A Russian Feast. Irina is pictured, with the caption: She was greatly cultured, well-read, and a doyenne of the old school, and more than anything, was a wonderful conversationalist with amazing stories and historical vignettes to share. She lived with her husband in San Francisco, California. They were devoted to their dogs, Samoyeds, Dushenka and Dushenka Deux. She died at home on January 21, 2009, at the age of 96.  Fashion design  Irina excelled in several design fields. Following fashion design school in New York City, and her move to San Francisco Irina opened, in 1945, her first studio-salon, as a millinery designer: EraBelle Hat Shop. For her shop's logo she used her fencing mask and a pair of foils. Designer's Roublon shop logo She created 118 headdresses for the Headdress Ball at the San Francisco Museum of Art. Her hats were recognized in San Francisco (where they were frequently remarked by Herb Caen) and beyond. She also created a special collection of miniature hats. She later shifted to American haute couture. She became San Francisco's most notable couturier, designing gowns, outfits, and coats under the label Irina Roublon, with her own maison at San Francisco's Union Square. Among other accomplishments, in 1953 she was invited to Milan, and designed the costumes for the La Scala production of Puccini's opera La Fanciulla del West. Her 1955 Holiday Collection show at her Stockton studio featured 43 selections, one executed by Gellenghi, Florence, Italy. She later moved the atelier to 260 Sutter St. She dressed many of the city's grande dames, including Ann Getty Light, Katherine Trefethen, Barbara Morgan Eisele, Kathryn Crosby, Maud Hill Schroll, Princess Natasha Romanoff, etc. Herb Caen often referred to her as Chanel of the West Coast. The August 20, 1961, Saturday Evening Post describes her decade-long effort, as part of the San Francisco chapter The Fashion Group International, San Francisco of Fashion Group International (FGI), with Jane Winthrop, in the San Francisco Mental Health Fashion Therapy Program which aimed to give fashion therapy to the mentally ill. These activities involved the patients in both staging and presenting fashion, and in showing them how to dress fashionably. The doctors commented on the improvement of their patients. Irina introduced, in 1961, the blue print of Fashion Therapy to the Paris Fashion Group. The Fashion Group International, Paris In 1963 Irina was the Advisor for Fashion Lift, a tour of US Fashion Industry of European Couturiers.

Artist  From the early 1960s through the late 1980s, Irina studied and prolifically created still life and portrait paintings in oil and water color, excelling in flower compositions. She held studio and feature exhibitions; she competed and won prizes. Her work is in holdings throughout the SFBay area. In 1965 she undertook private study with two prominent Russian painters, including Serge Ivanoff; she executed a portrait of her two masters. She cherished her portrait as executed by Serge Ivanoff. Among her most accomplished pieces are those of iris and the large white Matilija poppy, which she grew and attended in her own garden. One rare instance of foregoing her famed Easter parties was 1988 when she was preparing for her April 30, 1988, show at Mae Woo's William Gallery in St. Helena.In the crowd sipping tea were ... and a favorite artist, Irina Roublon Belotelkin who will open a show tomorrow at Mae's [Woo] William Gallery in St. Helena.

She presented it to Gordon at his 2005 birthday celebration. ... most assumed, correctly, this was a \\"no gift\\" party. ... But Gordon was clearly delighted when Irena (sic) Belotelkin ... a longtime friend of Getty's late mother, presented Gordon with a charcoal portrait she'd drawn of him 30 years ago. \\"My dear girl,\\" he purred.

Construction and early career, 1913-1918 Buena Ventura was built as a commercial cargo ship in 1913 at Howdon-on-Tyne, England, by Northumberland Shipbuilding Company. The United States Steel Products Company of New York City owned her when the United States Shipping Board requisitioned her for World War I service in 1917. The Shipping Board assigned her to the United States Army, for which she began operations in 1917 with a United States Navy Naval Armed Guard detachment aboard to man her guns. United States Navy service, 1918 Buena Ventura was transferred to the U.S. Navy on 25 July 1918. Assigned the naval registry Identification Number (Id. No.) 1335, she was commissioned as USS Buena Ventura (or USS Buenaventura) at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on 26 July 1918 with Lieutenant Commander Howard Fitzsimons, USNRF, in command. Buena Ventura was assigned to the Naval Overseas Transportation Service on a U.S. Army account. After loading cargo at Philadelphia, she departed for New York City on 9 August 1918, then left New York in a convoy on 13 August 1918 bound for France. Steaming first to La Pallice and from there to Royan and Bordeaux, she proceeded to Le Verdon-sur- Mer to take on fuel for the return voyage to Philadelphia. Buena Ventura cleared Le Verdon-Sur-mer in ballast on 14 September 1918 as part of a 25-ship convoy bound for the United States. Seven escorts protected the convoy until that evening, after which the convoy continued across the Atlantic Ocean unescorted. Loss At about 20:45 on 16 September 1918, the German submarine U-46 came across the unescorted convoy and fired two torpedoes into Buena Ventura. The first struck amidships, directly beneath the flying bridge about below the waterline and tore a hole that measured long by wide. The blast from the explosion coursed upward, splintering the lifeboat suspended in its davits just above and knocking the wireless out of commission. The second torpedo hit in the after end of the empty hold number four. Buena Ventura, mortally stricken, soon slowed in the rising swells, listing to port. Her siren blasted out the submarine warning signal while her after gun fired one shot. After throwing the confidential publications and codes overboard in weighted bags, the crew abandoned their rapidly sinking ship in the four undamaged lifeboats. Her commanding officer ‚Äî Lt. Cdr. Fitzsimons ‚Äî remained on board to be sure that everyone who could abandon ship had done so and, when thus assured, stepped into the last boat and ordered it lowered away. That boat, damaged in bumping against the side of the ship due to the Buena Venturas port list, required unceasing efforts to bale out the water that had gained entry through several leaks. Fitzsimons, his executive officer, and the 27 enlisted men in the boat, separated from the other three boats in the darkness and rising seas, steered in the direction of the Spanish coast. On 18 September, the French destroyer rescued 45 of Buena Venturas crew, while on the morning of 20 September, the Spanish coaster Lola took Fitzsimons and his remaining sailors on board and landed them at Corunna, Spain on 22 September.

That year, Alite pleaded guilty to racketeering charges, including two murders and a variety of other crimes, and in 2011, was sentenced to a total of 10 years in prison. Due to his cooperation with prosecutors, he was released on a five year supervised release in 2012. Alite has estimated that he had shot between 30 to 40 people, beat about 100 people with a baseball bat, and murdered six people. Later in life, Alite has publicly denounced the life of organized crime and became a motivational speaker and a writer. Early life Alite was born on September 30, 1962 in Queens, New York City; his grandparents were Albanian immigrants from Gjirokast√´r, \\"John Alite, shqiptari me origjin√´ nga Gjirokastra, i lindur dhe i rritur n√´ Queens t√´ NYC, nga i biri i nj√´ taksisti\\" and grew up in Woodhaven, Queens. He received a baseball scholarship to the University of Tampa, but dropped out after three years. He grew up in the same neighborhood as John Gotti's son, John A. Gotti, and were boyhood friends. He was Gotti's best man at his wedding in 1990. Alite's first wife was Carol, and his second wife was Claudia DiPippa; he has four children. Criminal life Alite was associated with the Gambino family, and led a crew in Tampa, Florida that extorted rival valet businesses, and reported to Gambino capo Ronald Trucchio. He also arranged for the purchase of Mirage, a Tampa nightclub. In 1995, Charles Carneglia and Alite were involved in a major conspiracy to murder John A. Gotti. Later that year, Alite was arrested for illegal possession of a firearm in violation of a parole agreement and spent three years in prison. After his release, Alite earned an additional three months back in prison for acting as a go-between for corrupt prison guard Troy Kemmerer who was smuggling sperm donation kits in and out of Allenwood Federal Prison for inmate Antonino Parlavecchio, who was trying to impregnate his wife Maria. As federal racketeering indictments were handed down for his group's activities in the Tampa area, Alite fled to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil in January 2004, and lived and worked in the Copacabana neighborhood, according to the Brazilian Federal Police. He lived there for 10 months before authorities arrested him. He served two years in prison in Brazil and was eventually extradited to federal authorities in Tampa, for trial in 2006. Government witness and racketeering convictions In January 2008, Alite pleaded guilty to racketeering charges that included two murders, four murder conspiracies, at least eight shootings, and two attempted shootings as well as armed home invasions and armed robberies in New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Florida, stemming from his alleged involvement in a Gambino crew in Tampa, Florida. Alite agreed to testify in the trial of Gambino family enforcer Charles Carneglia, who was found guilty of four murders and is now serving a life sentence. Alite was also a government witness in the unsuccessful racketeering trial against Gotti. Prosecutors indicted Gotti for racketeering and murder conspiracy charges, stemming from an alleged drug trafficking ring in Florida, and the murders of George Grosso in 1988, Louis DiBono in 1990 and Bruce John Gotterup in 1991. Alite testified that Gotti was responsible for at least eight murders, among other crimes. Alite's testimony was largely undermined during cross examination. On December 1, 2009, the 12 jurors announced that they had failed to reach a unanimous verdict on all the charges against Gotti and the judge declared a mistrial and released Gotti. Interviewed after the trial, the jurors said that they did not find Alite to be credible. Federal prosecutors from Brooklyn and Tampa described Alite's cooperation as \\"extraordinary\\" and \\"substantial\\" when submitting statements to the judge responsible for sentencing Alite for two murders and other crimes. On April 26, 2011, Alite was sentenced to a total of 10 years in prison. In January 2012, he was released on a five year supervised release, and in October 2015, Gotti wrote a letter to the U.S. Probation Office claiming that Alite broke the terms of his supervised release in a New Jersey gun case which prompted an investigation that sent Alite back to prison for three months. Later life Alite later became a youth motivational speaker on avoiding crime. He has three books that he co-wrote, Gotti's Rules: The Story of John Alite, Junior Gotti, and the Demise of the American Mafia (with George Anastasia, 2015), Darkest Hour: John Alite: Former Mafia Enforcer for John Gotti & The Gambino Crime Family (2018), and Prison Rules (2019). In July 2020, he appeared in the Fear City: New York vs The Mafia Netflix docuseries.

From left to right: packing container, W45 warhead, code-decoder unit, firing unit. Atomic demolition munitions (ADMs), colloquially known as nuclear land mines, are small nuclear explosive devices. ADMs were developed for both military and civilian purposes. As weapons, they were designed to be exploded in the forward battle area, in order to block or channel enemy forces. Non-militarily, they were designed for demolition, mining or earthmoving. However, apart from testing, they have never been used for either purpose. Military uses Shot Uncle of Operation Buster-Jangle, had a yield of 1.2 kilotons,Some sources refer to the test as Jangle Uncle (e.g., Adushkin, 2001) or Project Windstorm (e.g., DOE/NV-526, 1998). Operation Buster and Operation Jangle were initially conceived as separate operations, and Jangle was at first known as Windstorm, but the AEC merged the plans into a single operation on 19 June 1951. See Gladeck, 1986. and was detonated 5.2 m (17 ft) beneath ground level. The yield is approximately the same as the maximum yield of the W54 equipped SADM. The explosion resulted in a cloud that rose to 11,500 ft, and deposited fallout to the north and north-northeast. The resulting crater was 260 feet wide and 53 feet deep. Instead of being delivered to the target by missiles, rockets, or artillery shells, ADMs were intended to be emplaced by soldiers. Due to their relatively small size and light weight, ADMs could be emplaced by military engineers or special forces teams, then detonated on command or by timer to create massive obstructions. By destroying key terrain features or choke points such as bridges, dams, mountain passes and tunnels, ADMs could serve to create physical as well as radiological obstacles to the movement of enemy forces and thus channel them into prepared killing zones. (unclassified). According to official accounts, the United States deployed ADMs overseas in Italy and West Germany (Fulda Gap) during the Cold War... The most modern types (SADM and MADM) were deployed in South Korea.... Seymour Hersh referred to the deployment of ADMs along the Golan Heights by Israel in the early 1980s.. Civilian uses ADMs have never been used commercially although similar small devices, often modified to cut down on fission yield and maximize fusion, have been deeply buried to put out gas well fires as part of the Soviet test program. The Soviet Union tested the use of nuclear devices for mining and natural gas extraction (stimulating gas flow in a similar manner to fracking) on several occasions starting in the mid-1960s, as part of the Nuclear Explosions for the National Economy program. Tests for similar purposes were carried out in the United States under Operation Plowshare, but due to radioactive contamination caused by the tests, no direct commercial use was made of the technology although they were successful at nucleosynthesis and probing the composition of the Earth's deep crust by Vibroseis which has helped mining company prospecting.http://symposia.obs.carnegiescience.edu/series/symposium4/ms/becker.ps.gz United States ADMs H-912 transport container for Mk-54 SADM In the 1950s and 1960s, the United States developed several different types of lightweight nuclear devices. The main one was the W54, a cylinder 40 by 60 cm (about 16 by 24 inches) that weighed 23 kg (50 lb). It was fired by a mechanical timer and had a variable yield equivalent to between 10 tons and 1 kt of TNT. A Field non-variable yield version of the W54 nuclear device (called the \\"Mk-54 Davy Crockett\\" warhead for the M-388 Crockett round) was used in the Davy Crockett Weapon System. * W7/ADM-B (c. 1954‚Äì67) * T4 ADM (1957‚Äì63) gun type * W30/Tactical Atomic Demolition Munition (1961‚Äì66) * W31/ADM (1960‚Äì65) * W45/Medium Atomic Demolition Munition (1964‚Äì84) * W54/Special Atomic Demolition Munition (1965‚Äì89) =TADM= The Mk 30 Mod 1 Tactical Atomic Demolition Munition (TADM) was a portable atomic bomb, consisting of a Mk 30 warhead installed in a X-113 case. The X-113 was 26 inches (66 cm) in diameter and 70 in (178 cm) long, and looked like corrugated culvert pipe. The whole system weighed 840 pounds (381 kg). Production of the TADM started in 1961 and all were removed from stockpile by 1966. A weapons effect test of the TADM was made in the 1962 Johnny Boy (\\"Johnnie Boy\\") shot of the Dominic II series (which is more accurately referred to as Operation Sunbeam), the yield of Johnny Boy/Johnnie Boy was about .5 kt.Hansen, Chuck, \\"Swords of Armageddon\\" (CD-ROM & download available). PDF. 2,600 pages, Sunnyvale, California, Chucklea Publications, 1995, 2007. (2nd Ed.) A preceding ADM test which resulted in a comparable yield, was test shot \\"Danny Boy\\" of Operation Nougat, also producing a yield of about 0.5 kiloton. =SADM= Scientists look at a MADM nuclear land mine. Cutaway casing with warhead inside, code-decoder / firing unit is at left. The Special Atomic Demolition Munition (SADM) was a family of man-portable nuclear weapons fielded by the US military in the 1960s, but never used in actual combat. The US Army planned to use the weapons in Europe in the event of a Soviet invasion. US Army Engineers would use the weapon to irradiate, destroy, and deny key routes of communication through limited terrain such as the Fulda Gap. Troops were trained to parachute into Soviet occupied western Europe with the SADM and destroy power plants, bridges, and dams. The weapon was designed to allow one person to parachute from any type of aircraft carrying the weapon package and place it in a harbor or other strategic location that could be accessed from the sea. Another parachutist without a weapon package would follow the first to provide support as needed. The two-person team would place the weapon package in the target location, set the timer, and swim out into the ocean where they would be retrieved by a submarine or a high-speed surface water craft. =MADM= The Medium Atomic Demolition Munition (MADM) was a tactical nuclear weapon developed by the United States during the Cold War. They were designed to be used as nuclear land mines and for other tactical purposes, with a relatively low explosive yield from a W45 warhead, between 1 and 15 kilotons. Each MADM weighted around 400 lb (181 kg) total. They were produced between 1965 and 1986. =Russian controversy with ADMs= In the aftermath of the collapse of the Soviet Union, the United States and Russia developed a deep cooperation designed to assure the security of Russia‚Äôs nuclear arsenal. While a number of steps were taken to consolidate and improve the security of Russia‚Äôs strategic nuclear arms, particularly under the Cooperative Threat Reduction program, concern remained over the security of the Russian tactical nuclear weapons arsenal. In particular, a serious debate arose over the status of what are known as ‚Äúsuitcase nuclear weapons,‚Äù very small Soviet-era nuclear devices. The term suitcase nuke is generally used to describe any type of small, man- portable nuclear device although there is serious debate as to the validity of the term itself. In a worst case analysis, a suitcase nuke would be small enough to be hand-carried into a major population or leadership center (downtown Manhattan or Capitol Hill, for example) undetected and then detonated. Although, by most accounts, the yield of such a device is likely far less than ten kilotons, its combined effects may have the potential to kill tens of thousands, if not more. There is a great deal of confusion over just how many of these suitcase devices exist or if they even exist at all. By some accounts, the Soviet Union built hundreds of these devices, of which several dozen were missing. Based on other reports, suitcase nukes were never built in large numbers or were never deployed. There is no definitive open source information on the number, location, security, or status of these suitcase nuclear bombs. No Soviet suitcase bomb or any of its presumed components has ever been found, much less used, in the three decades after the collapse of the USSR. , it is likely they would not work or would fizzle at worst by lack of the required specialized maintenance common to all nuclear weapons, if they ever existed. =Frontline broadcast about suitcase nukes= On February 23, 1999, the PBS investigative program Frontline aired a special on Russian nuclear security which included a series of interviews with several of the individuals who spoke publicly during the 1997 debate on suitcase nukes. Alexei Yablokov appeared and reasserted his position that some number of small atomic charges had been built, even going so far as to speak of their weight (‚Äúthirty kilos, forty kilos‚Äù). Yablokov accused the Russian government of misleading the public on the situation, pointing to the inconsistencies in denials by the FSB, MINATOM, and the information that was publicly available on the Internet (‚Äú‚Ä¶if I‚Äôm looking at a [picture] of an American weapon, I must be sure that we have an analogy‚Ä¶‚Ä≥). On the same program, Congressman Curt Weldon recounted a meeting he held in December 1997 with Defense Minister Igor Sergeyev. During this meeting, Weldon asked Sergeyev specifically about the small ADM devices. According to Weldon, Sergeyev‚Äôs response was: ‚ÄúYes, we did build them, we are in the process of destroying them, and by the year 2000 we will have destroyed all of our small atomic demolition devices.‚Äù Weldon went on to express confidence in Sergeyev‚Äôs statement but also raised concern as to whether or not the Russian government had accounted for all of its nuclear devices. Frontline also featured several American and Russian experts and officials who presented differing views on the subject. General Vladimir Dvorkin, a former officer in the Strategic Rocket Forces and subsequently Director of the Fourth Central Research Institute in Moscow, admitted that ‚Äúsome small devices existed in the United States and Russia‚Äù but that something that small would have a very limited shelf life and would have little deterrent value. Dvorkin discounted the validity of statements, saying ‚Äú‚Ä¶Lebed is probably the least informed person as far as this topic is concerned‚Ä¶an expert in military folklore.‚Äù The former commander of U.S. nuclear forces, retired General Eugene Habiger, also appeared on Frontline and expressed doubt about the size of such devices, calling the term suitcase ‚Äúa little optimistic.‚Äù Additionally, Habiger spoke of the systems set up by the Russians to track their nuclear weapons, saying ‚ÄúIf the Russians were as deadly serious about the accountability of the nuclear weapons that I saw and have been involved with, I can only surmise that they have the same concerns with the smaller weapons.‚Äù =Suitcase nukes and bin Laden= By late 1999, the concern had expanded from nuclear armed Chechen rebels to include concerns about Osama bin Laden‚Äôs al-Qaeda network. Although unsubstantiated, some reports suggested that bin Laden had already managed to acquire weapons from the Russian nuclear arsenal. In August 1999, Voice of America broadcast a story about the threat posed by bin Laden. In it, Yossef Bodansky, an American terrorism analyst, author, and head of the Congressional Task Force on Terrorism and Non-Conventional Warfare claimed that he had learned, through sources in Russia and the Middle East, that bin Laden had ‚Äúa few of the ex- Soviet ‚Äòsuitcase‚Äô bombs acquired through the Chechens.‚Ä≥Nick Simeone, ‚ÄúBin Laden Bombing Anniversary,‚Äù Voice of America, August 6, 1999. Two months later, on October 5, the Moscow daily Komsomolskaya Pravda published an interview in which Bodansky, citing ‚Äúvarious intelligence sources,‚Äù claimed that bin Laden had acquired, through Kazakhstan, ‚Äúfrom several to twenty tactical nuclear warheads.‚Äù Bodansky also claimed that bin Laden had attempted to buy ‚Äúnuclear suitcases‚Äù in Kazakhstan. In the same article, the director of the Atomic Energy Agency of the Republic of Kazakhstan declared that all nuclear weapons had been removed ‚Äúlong ago‚Äù from Kazakhstan and that suitcase nuclear devices were never built in Kazakh territory. The head of counterintelligence for the Kazakhstani Committee on National Security told Komsomolskaya Pravda that all nuclear weapons were removed from Kazakhstan in 1995 in accordance with the START I treaty and denied reports that bin Laden had attempted to purchase nuclear weapons there.‚ÄúYoussef Bodansky: Terrorist No. 1 Has an Atomic Bomb,‚Äù Komsomolskaya Pravda, October 5, 1999. Bodansky‚Äôs claims surfaced again on October 25, 1999 when The Jerusalem Report published an article on bin Laden and suitcase nuclear devices. In this report, Bodansky‚Äôs claim of ‚Äúa few to twenty‚Äù weapons was repeated. In addition, Bodansky claimed that bin Laden had purchased the weapons using ‚Äú$30 million in cash and two tons of Afghan heroin.‚Äù‚ÄúBin Laden Has Several Nuclear Suitcases,‚Äù The Jerusalem Report, October 25, 1999. Very little information is available to back Bodansky‚Äôs claims and they remain in doubt. =Suitcase nukes concerns post-9/11= Following the September 11 terrorist attacks on the United States, fresh attention was focused on al-Qaeda‚Äôs desire for weapons of mass destruction but with more urgency than in the past. A serious concern was that al-Qaeda terrorists might attempt to obtain Russian warheads or weapon-usable nuclear materials. Former GRU Colonel Stanislav Lunev‚Äôs 1998 statements were resurrected following the attacks. During an appearance on CBS, Lunev reasserted his claim that suitcase bombs existed, even going so far as to claim that bin Laden had obtained several of the devices from the former Soviet Union. In the same segment, Michael O‚ÄôHanlon of the Brookings Institution discounted Lunev‚Äôs claims: ‚ÄúOur view is that this is not a major worry. If those devices ever existed, they were under the control of the Soviet state, and not available to terrorists.‚Äù‚ÄúNuclear Terror?‚Äù CBSNews.com, November 5, 2001. On December 20, 2001 UPI reported that the FBI had stepped up its investigation into terrorist access to Russian nuclear stockpiles. Representative Weldon, once again at the forefront of the debate, stated ‚ÄúDo I think he [bin Laden] has a small atomic demolition munitions, which were built by the Soviets in the Cold War? Probably doubtful.‚Äù On January 17, 2002, Russia‚Äôs Atomic Energy Minister, Aleksandr Rumyantsev, told Interfax it would be impossible for terrorists to construct a portable nuclear weapon, citing a lack of ‚Äúnecessary potential and materials.‚Äù The Interfax report went on to state ‚Äúmajor nuclear powers have an effective system of control over miniature nuclear charges, which weigh a total of several dozen kilograms.‚Äù According to Rumyantsev ‚Äúall of these [miniature nuclear devices] are registered‚Ä¶ it is technically impossible for such charges to find their way into the hands of terrorists.‚Äù‚ÄúRussian Minister Says Miniature Nuclear Charges Out Of Reach Of Terrorists,‚Äù Agentstvo Voyennykh Novostey, January 17, 2002. =Suitcase nukes controversy timeline= * April 1995 Russian media reports claim Chechen rebels have ‚Äúa number‚Äù of small nuclear devices (Atomic Demolition Munitions or ADMs) * January 1996 Monterey Institute of International Studies reports that the KGB had a number of small nuclear devices in the 1970s and 1980s. * Sept. 1996 Lebed forms commission to review security of Russia‚Äôs nuclear arsenal. * Oct. 17, 1996 Yeltsin fires Lebed.

History  On February 1, 1947, an application for KIRX was filed with the Federal Communications Commission by North Missouri Broadcasting Company, a group consisting of U.S. Congressman Samuel W. Arnold, Sam A. Burk, and Congressman Arnold's son, local businessman Sam M. Arnold. Approval from the FCC was granted on May 1, 1947 to operate KIRX on 1450kc at 250 watts power from a tower height of 150 feet. Office, studio, and tower construction had already begun in anticipation of the authorization, so KIRX was ready to begin broadcasting at noon on October 17, 1947. Until this time the Kirksville area, and indeed much of northeast Missouri, had to rely on radio stations from distant cities such as Des Moines, Iowa, Kansas City, Missouri, and Quincy, Illinois for their broadcast news and entertainment. Most programming was local in origin for the first few years, with the exception of St. Louis Cardinal baseball, which began in 1948. In 1960 KIRX was granted FCC permission to increase its daytime operating power to 1,000 watts, and beginning in 1967 this was broadcast from a new 400-foot tower, increasing the broadcast coverage area. In 1984 KIRX received FCC authorization to operate at full power, 1,000 watts, 24 hours per day. Prior to then, the station was required to power down to 250 watts from sundown to sunrise daily. Also in 1960, the Arnold family divested themselves from North Missouri Broadcast Company, leaving Sam Burk and wife Vera the principal owners, with the new ownership name of Community Broadcasters, Incorporated. Following Sam Burk's death in 1982, his wife Vera continued on as station owner and general manager until 1985 when KIRX and sister station KRXL FM (established in 1967), were sold to an investment group headed by Alvina Britz and David Nelson, dba KIRX Incorporated. On December 1, 2014, KIRX was granted an FCC license to broadcast from an FM frequency of 99.7 MHz from transmitter K259BF. The transmitter, located outside of the Kirksville, MO city limits, has an Effective Radiated Power of 250 watts, allowing the FM signal to only reach as far south as Macon County, MO, and as far north as Schuyler County, MO, about 5 miles south of the Missouri-Iowa Border. KIRX first day of broadcasting celebration, 10-17-1947.  Format  The early days of KIRX featured many music and interview programs broadcast live from the studios, along with local high school and college sports by remote. One early program that survives to this day is 'Party Line', a 6-day per week call-in show where community members can buy, sell, or trade items. The 'KIRX Barn Dance', broadcast live from Reiger Armory in Kirksville on Saturday nights, was also a popular show. During the 1950s and 1960s most local music programming gave way to the 'stacks of wax', 45's and LP's featuring a wide variety of singers and bands, often left to the discretion of the DJ. The decision was made in 1983 to feature an all-country music format with the slogan \\"Music Country KIRX\\". This continued until the late 1990s when the current format of News/Talk with '50s and '60s oldies was initiated. However, as it has since the beginning, local news, high school sports, and St. Louis Cardinal baseball games remain the primary focus.

Built in 1922, it is an example of traditional, indigenous architecture and is known as the largest stone ambalama in the Kandy region.  Architecture  The Appallagoda Ambalama has a floor area of approximately and measures from floor to pinnacle. On the inside, around the ambalama, are stone seats. Caste differences dictated the different levels in the seating area. The roof is supported by two sets of stone columns, twelve externally and four internally. The ambalama has two broken stone columns on the northeastern side. The local villagers claim that the columns were constructed this way deliberately when the ambalama was built to ward off inauspicious omens. The roof has a brass pinnacle that is indicative of the architectural pattern of that period. A prominent feature at the front of this ambalama is the stone \\"pinth√§liya\\", a traditional container for drinking water.  History  There is no written documentation about the Appallagoda Ambalama and its history. One theory to explain this absence is that this building is a recent addition to the list of ambalamas in Sri Lanka. According to Local villagers, the Appallagoda Ambalama was built in 1922 to house trade parties. It was built under the orders of the local\\"arachchi\\" (head of the village) at that time. A folktale explains the four names engraved in the four internal stone columns in the ambalam.

Websites indicate Honduras but no apparent published reports. In at least one case, this species is responsible for an emergency room visit in the United States (see below), but it is not indicated if the scorpion in question was a member of an introduced population or came from an isolated release (e.g. a lone individual introduced accidentally or a pet kept in captivity).Envenomation by the scorpion (Centruroides limbatus) outside its natural range and recognition of medically important scorpions, Wilderness Environ Med. 1999; 10(3):161-4 () Habitat Within its range, C. limbatus is a common predator in the vegetation of the forest understory, where it can be found among the vegetation. It is also known to frequent houses and other building where shelter and food are abundant. C. limbatus is a diurnal species that spends night hiding in cracks and crevices. It has been recorded from sea level to 1400 meters. Description C. limbatus is a relatively large scorpion and grows up to 110 mm in length. It is a polymorphic species that comes in a wide range of colors. Typically they have yellowish bodies with a contrasting blackish color on chelicera, the fingers of the pedipalps, the fifth segment of the tail, and the cephalothorax. Some individuals are paler over all, and some other individual are darker overall and display a bluish- black color. Numerous chromatic variations can be found between these two extremes. Venom A researcher associated with the Smithsonian Institution assures that \\"this species is not considered dangerous to humans\\" but warns that nonetheless that they \\"are venomous and being stung by one is no picnic.\\" According to another researcher's firsthand account of being stung while trying to capture a subadult specimen near Tortuguero, Costa Rica: > There was immediate pain, as if being penetrated by a thorn much larger than > the actual sting. The site of the sting felt tight and as if it was burning, > although there was little visible inflimation.

Her reaction seems more serious than that implied in the above assessments and may be due to anaphylactic shock. According to a report: > She developed local pain and systemic symptoms, including parasthesias, > flushing, hypertension, and wheezing...Severe systemic signs of envenomation > by Centruroides sp. may include respiratory difficulty, somatic > neuromuscular dysfunction, and cranial nerve dysfunction. Patients stung by > dangerous scorpions may require airway support, extended observation, > antivenin, and avoidance of respiratory depressive medications. The report also notes \\"Scorpions have been reported to be accidentally transported to areas where they are not indigenous, and patients may present anywhere with envenomation by dangerous scorpion species.\\" A case of scorpion sting to the palm of the hand of a scuba diver occurred while trying on a wetsuit on the Osa Peninsula. Symptoms reported include localized pain for several hours with severity decreasing after the first hour. Localized tingling sensation was reported as well. Treatment several hours after envenomation with Therapik, a toxin-denaturing device utilizing heat, resulted in complete resolution of symptoms. (Feb 19,2016) Similar species C. limbatus belongs to the gracilis species group. All of the species in this group are characterised by their long, narrow pedipalps and overall relatively large size. C. bicolor closely resembles C. limbatus but these two species can be discerned from each other by the color of the pincers as well as more subtle characteristics. Captivity Although a source at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology guesses that \\"this species is probably not kept in captivity by hobbyists\\" this species is indeed bred in captivity.

Often used to collect anesthesia, it can also be used to collect any type of gas or aerosolized medicine that is intended only for the patient and should not be breathed in by any other medical personnel. In the Operating Room the Anaesthetic Gas Scavenging System collects and removes waste gases from the patient breathing circuit and the patient ventilation circuit. In most jurisdictions, there is a legal requirement to scavenge waste gases to maintain the level of waste gases in the Operating Room below the legally acceptable limit. For example, in the UK the limits are typically 100ppm for nitrous oxide and 50ppm for halogenated volatile anaesthetic agents (except halothane which is 10ppm).

In addition to the legal requirement there is an Occupational Health requirement to maintain a safe workplace and limit exposure to potentially harmful gases.

The formerly independent village was incorporated into Limburg in 1971. The town is dominated by the basilica St. Lubentius, which was the most important early- medieval church building in the region.  Geography  Dietkirchen is situated directly on the west (left) bank of the Lahn River. Its prominent feature is the towering limestone bluff on which St. Lubentius is built. The central town of Limburg is located in a widening of the Lahn valley. Dietkirchen is situated at the eastern end of this widening, with the valley becoming narrow again near Runkel. Vineyards above the village as viewed from St. Lubentius The old village is characterized by a large height differential, with housing plots situated on terraces formed by numerous retaining walls. The village itself is situated at an elevation of 120 to 170 meters. In the northern part of the borough, the landscape rises up to 180 meters, while in the southern part, on the banks of the Lahn below the church‚Äôs bluff, it drops to 115 meters. With a surface area of , Dietkirchen is the smallest borough of Limburg. Its surroundings consist almost exclusively of agricultural land, with the exception of the vegetation on the banks of the Lahn. The borough is bordered to the north by the Runkel borough of Dehrn, in the east and south by Eschhofen, in the west by the central city of Limburg, and in the northwest by Offheim. HistoryEarly history= In the area of the church St. Lubentius, archaeologists have discovered traces of a cult site from the Copper Age (2000 to 4000 BC), as well as the remains of a settlement assigned to the Urnfield culture (1300 to 800 BC). Excavations in the Basilica suggest that before the Church was constructed the site on the limestone bluff had been a pagan cult and gathering place. The Reckenforst, a judicial meeting place which exercised high jurisdiction over the wider environs in at least in the Early Middle Ages, was nearby. It was mentioned as early as 1217. Dietkirchen is first mentioned in documents in 841 as \\"in ecclesia dietkircha\\". The village, however, is older. A low noble family, \\"the Dietkirchener Lords,\\" resided there. The meaning of the toponym is unclear. The second part, \\"kirchen\\" (German for church), refers, according to the unanimous opinion, to the St. Lubentius church. The problem is in the interpretation of the syllable \\"diet.\\" Some historians speculate that it comes from Old High German, and means \\"the people.\\" The village‚Äôs name then meant \\"people's church\\" and refers to the prominent position of the Archdeaconate as a central church. Others advocate a pre-Germanic meaning of \\"diet\\" referring to the important ford on the Lahn below the church. In the history of the village, the Christianization of the Lahn region and the St. Lubentius basilica play a special role. The legend that Lubentius himself ministered there is demonstrably wrong. The beginnings of Christianity in the Lahn region date approximately to between the 6th and the end of the 7th centuries. In this period was probably also the founding of the village. =St. Lubentius= Chancel of St. Lubentius Basilica The Romanesque basilica of St. Lubentius is situated in the midst of a park-like cemetery. Its architecture is typical of the time, characterized by heavy members and generally cubic bulkiness, from which only the interior manages in places to break away. The aspirations of the architecture and the quality of the interior decoration remind one today of the important role St. Lubentius played in church politics. The first mention of the collegiate church of St. Lubentius dates to 841. It was built between 830 and 838. The parish counted around 425 souls at the time. According to archaeological finds, it replaced an earlier stone parish church built in about 720, which itself had replaced a wooden predecessor probably built as early as 580. It became an archdeaconate of the Archdiocese of Trier, possibly as early as 900 and definitely by 1021. The entire part of the Diocese of Trier on right bank of the Rhine was managed from Dietkirchen. Six deaneries were subordinate to it. Construction of the basilica may have already begun by 1021. The present structure was consecrated on August 5, 1225. Supposedly, the construction lasted only about ten years. In addition to St. Lubentius, St. Juliana was also selected as a patron of the church. In the Romanesque church lie the remains of St. Lubentius, around which many legends have formed. Probably his remains were transported from Kobern on the Mosel River to Dietkirchen before 841. By no later than 1326, the deanery of Dietkirchen also possessed a separate land chapter (German Landkapitel), a spiritual community analogous to a collegiate chapter. Its memorial book recorded its last entry in 1709, after the rest of the land chapters in the Archdeaconate had been dissolved in the Protestant Reformation. Several members of the Frei family of Dehrn, a regionally important house of lower nobility, were buried at the church. =Lahn crossings= Pedestrian bridge over the Lahn at DietkirchenThe Lahn Ferry at Dietkirchen was mentioned already between 1048 and 1098. The operation of this ferry was given as a feudal right. The ferry service ended in 1959. As a replacement, a 145 meter long and 3.30 meter wide wooden bicycle and pedestrian bridge was built beneath the rock in 1989. Regional bike paths R7 and R8 cross the Lahn via this bridge. Near the mouth of the Emsbach, a small stream that enters the Lahn between Dietkirchen and Eschhofen, there is a ford across the Lahn that was used intensively in the late Frankish period. The imperial postal service later used this crossing on its Frankfurt-Cologne route. The area is still known as the Postmauer (post wall) today. = Dietkirchen Market = When the Dietkirchen Market began is not known, but it probably dates to the High Middle Ages. Evidence of a fair (German Jahrmarkt) on the Feast of St. Lubentius dates to the late 13th century, but it is clearly mentioned only in 1538. The market was an attraction for visitors from the surrounding area. The historical market was renewed in 1991 at the initiative of then-mayor Kurt van der Burg and with the co-operation of all the clubs in the town. It now takes place every three years. = Prisoner of war camp and military cemetery = Memorial to Irish World War I dead buried at Dietkirchen military cemeteryAt the end of 1914, during World War I, a prisoner of war camp was established on both sides of the road from Limburg to Dietkirchen. Barracks were built to hold up to 12,000 inmates. First, these were mainly English, Irish, and French soldiers, while toward the end of the war there were especially Russians and Poles. Italians were also imprisoned there. The camp reached its occupancy limit in May 1915. During the day, the prisoners worked in local businesses and surrounding farms. Memorial to Russian and Soviet soldiers of both world wars buried at Dietkirchen military cemeteryOn December 23, 1914, the first prisoner to die in the camp, Irishman Frederick Reilly (born August 24, 1864, died December 20, 1914), was buried in the nearby graveyard with full military honors. In August 1916, the graveyard, which, together with the medical aid station, was located south of the road between Limburg and Dietkirchen, was expanded into a military cemetery. On the feast of Pentecost, May 25, 1917, a three-meter-high Celtic cross was erected to commemorate the Irish who had died in the camp. On August 3, a sculpture by French sculptor Eduard Colomo, himself a prisoner in Dietkirchen, was completed. Until 1920, the camp served as a transit station for former German soldiers who had been released from Allied captivity. In 1923, all of the Russian dead and a Frenchman were exhumed and reinterred either in their homeland or at larger, central burial sites. From the First World War, a total of about 330 Russians, 130 French, 60 Italians, 47 British, 45 Irish, seven Serbs, two Belgians and a Romanian are still buried at the cemetery. The camp cemetery was reused during World War II for Soviet prisoners of war who had died in the camp ‚ÄúStammlager XII\\" in Diez. By the end of World War II, the number of Russian and Soviet soldiers buried there increased to an estimated 945. For that reason, the cemetery is locally known as the \\"Russian cemetery.\\" In 1954, the remains of three Russian prisoners of war, who were shot by men of the SS in the last days of the war in Oberweyer and had been buried there under the direction of the local mayor, were reburied in Dietkirchen. In 1959, at the site of the no-longer-maintained French monument, the city of Limburg erected a memorial stone for the Russian dead. Between 1998 and 2005, the entire cemetery was fundamentally renovated. = Incorporation into Limburg = In 1971, within the framework of territorial reform in Hesse, Dietkirchen lost its independence and became the first of the surrounding villages to be incorporated into the City of Limburg. Since 2001, Dietkirchen has been part of the Hessian village renewal program. Supported by funding from this program, several old agriculture buildings, particularly on Brunnenstra√üe and Limburgerstra√üe, were renovated and converted into homes.  City partnership  The twinning of Limburg with Oudenburg, Belgium had its origin in an initiative of the municipality of Dietkirchen shortly before its incorporation into Limburg.

For over 150 years APH has created unique products and services to support all aspects of daily life without sight.  History  The first United States schools for blind children opened in the 1830s. There were very few books and educational materials for the students. Teachers made their own tactile teaching aids and acquired embossed books from Europe. The American Printing House for the Blind (APH) was established in 1858 in response to the growing need for books and educational aids for blind students. Dempsey Sherrod, a blind man from Mississippi, promoted the idea of a central printing house for books for blind people. He raised funds for the enterprise, which he named the American Printing House for the Blind. In 1857, Sherrod obtained a charter in Mississippi to establish a publishing house to print books in raised letters, and because of its central location, named Louisville as the proposed location. In 1858, the General Assembly of Kentucky passed An Act To Establish The American Printing House For The Blind. Two years later, in 1860, APH received its first operating funds from private citizens in Mississippi and Kentucky. A press was purchased and APH was set up in the basement of the Kentucky School for the Blind. Legislatures in Mississippi, Louisiana, and Tennessee had appropriated funds for APH, and private donations had been collected in these states, but before the institution could begin its work of embossing books, the Civil War broke out. This wiped out any possibility of the southern states making good on their promises of funding. It was not until 1865 that a state allocation from Kentucky, along with donations from individuals in Ohio, Indiana, Kentucky, and Illinois, allowed APH to begin the work for which it was founded. The first book produced by APH was Fables and Tales for Children. It was embossed in 1866 in a raised Roman letter type called Boston line letter. It would be many years before Braille was the standard reading system for blind people.  Federal funding  Because printing books in raised letters could never be commercially successful, federal support was sought to assure a permanent printing fund. A bill was drawn up and presented to the 45th Congress. An Act to Promote the Education of the Blind became a law on March 3, 1879. The American Printing House for the Blind was designated as the official source of educational texts and aids for legally blind students throughout the country‚Äîa mandate that continues to the present. Federal funding created new demands for embossed books and the Printing House soon outgrew its rooms at the Kentucky School for the Blind. APH Trustees purchased land adjacent to the school where, in 1883, a building was erected to house the growing operations of APH. The current APH facility is still located on the same site and occupies nearly a city block. APH employs over 300 people. In the remaining years of the 19th century, the APH production of embossed books increased dramatically, growing from a 15-page publications catalog in 1894 to a 100-page listing ten years later. The first books had been produced in several different kinds of embossed codes and alphabets. Gradually, these systems were phased out in favor of Braille. APH printed its first Braille books ‚Äî several readers and children's books ‚Äî in 1893. Improvements were continually sought for a better stereograph, a faster press ‚Äî anything that would lower the cost of embossed book production. Catalog offerings were basic Braille slates, writing guides, maps, spelling frames, etc. In the twentieth century APH continued its efforts to provide accessible materials to help blind people become independent. Publication of the Braille edition of Reader's Digest in 1928 provided blind readers with the first popular magazine available in Braille. The magazine is currently sent to over 1,200 blind readers nationwide.  Talking Books  In 1936, the APH recording studio and record production department were established and production of Talking Books began. The first recorded weekly magazine, the Talking Book edition of Newsweek, was introduced in 1959 and the first recorded encyclopedia, the Talking World Book, in 1981. Flexible records were first produced in 1970 and cassette tapes in 1973. Today, APH produces over two million cassette tapes annually. In addition to Braille, large type (1948), and recorded books, APH produced educational aids. To facilitate development of these products, an educational research department was established in 1953. Notable products were the New Hall Braille Writer (1940), the Lavender Braille Writer (1962) and the Cranmer Abacus (1963). In 1960, APH completed the largest Braille project ever undertaken, the 145-volume Braille edition of the World Book Encyclopedia.  Campus  To house the growing production, the building was expanded many times. A new administration building, built in front of the 1883 fa√ßade, opened in 1955. In 1980, an addition to the manufacturing area brought the building to its present size (282,000 sq. ft.). Efforts to improve Braille production resulted in the first computerized Braille translation in 1964. IBM, the company that led in developing the program, donated a $2 million 709 computer. By 1987, all but a fraction of Braille production was completely computerized. A computerized database for accessible textbooks was introduced in 1988 and was expanded to include materials in all accessible media. In 1997, the database was named Louis and made available on the Internet.

Eventually, after a series of contractions, the male produces an off-white spermatophore, which contains sperm and hardens on contact with air. After this packet of sperm is introduced to the female's genital opening she becomes aggressive towards her mate and sometimes devours him in an episode of sexual cannibalism.Species of Costa Rica (in Spanish) Gestation for this species takes 60 ‚Äì 90 days. After being born, immature individuals instinctively climb up to the back of the mother and stay there until their first molt. Females have been observed carrying over fifty of their young in this manner. Similar species C. bicolor belongs to the Gracilis species group. All of the species in this group are characterized by their long, narrow pedipalps and overall relatively large size.Walter Reed Biosystematics Unit \\"Scorpion of the Day\\":Centruroides limbatus C. limbatus closely resembles C. bicolor but these two species can be discerned from each other by the color of the pincers as well as more subtle characteristics.

AFL career Campbell was recruited to the Melbourne Football Club from Camberwell Grammar School. Early in his career, the solidly built player was tried on the full-forward line wearing the number 40 and later 4 guernseys for Melbourne. Despite kicking some long goals, his questionable accuracy led to him being used instead at fullback where he settled in his career, becoming an uncompromising long and direct kicking defender. During a time of little success he requested a pre- draft trade at the end of 1991 that would find him at Footscray. Campbell became a cult hero for many Bulldogs fans, known for wearing a long sleeved jumper and gloves. He created some controversy when he created a business selling sporting gloves and tried to promote them as a fashion in the AFL. Campbell was one of the few players of his era (along with Alastair Lynch) who matched up well with Tony Lockett. Lockett would rarely beat Campbell in a man on man contest to the death. In 1994, with the intention of gaining membership in the Fremantle Dockers‚Äô squad for 1995, Campbell moved to play for Perth, but played only one match before an Achilles tendon injury required season- ending surgery.Lague, Steve; \\"Campbell Out for Year\\"; The West Australian, 9 May 1994, p. 73 American Football Campbell surprised many when he quit Australian football to move to the United States and follow Darren Bennett in the pursuit of big money as an American Football punter. However after trialling for a season he was not offered a contract. Return to the AFL Having gone missing for two seasons he eventually returned to Australia and announced his intention to once again play Australian rules football. The Bulldogs traded Luke Beveridge to get pick #54 in the 1995 AFL Draft which they used to re-draft Campbell. He played one final season in the league before retiring at the end of 1996.

It supports all major news formats (RSS/RDF and Atom), as well as importing from and exporting to OPML. The news content is downloadable and as such Canto also has limited podcasting support. Canto intends to be extremely flexible and extensible, allowing the full use of the Python programming language in its configuration. History Canto is a Python rewrite of NRSS (a C-based news reader that has since been deprecated), starting in early 2008. The project was started to address many of the shortcomings of NRSS, particularly multiple line item titles, more formats supported, and general fragility. A lot of code was eliminated by using Mark Pilgrim's feedparser and chardet libraries. The name canto was chosen to describe the divisions apparent in the default interface, like the divisions of a long poem. Distinguishing features Canto's main appeal is that all of the content is displayed in a single list that is fully visible by default. Feeds can be hidden and items can be dynamically filtered out so that at any given time the most relevant information is visible. The summary of an item is accurately depicted in HTML rendered to text, including image links and enclosure (podcast) content (both of which can be downloaded with external handlers). Configuration is done using Python, allowing users to alter Canto with custom classes and functions. Sorting and filtering is done in the same manner as typical Python lists, and new themes and styles can just override part of the default renderer class. Extra functionality has been added using extra libraries. Canto fully supports using Unicode/UTF-8 in feed items, and for user input. Lastly, Canto's information is updated by a separate process, canto-fetch, which can either run as a daemon or as a cron- job.

Mr. Padmabhooshan Mohan Dharia, Ex - Central Cabinet Minister & Ex - Chairman, 8th Planning commission of India Government, the Chairman of the 8th planning commission too, was in favor of the private open university concept and he specifically mentioned to this effect in his report. An excerpt of the same is presented below. With measures to curb commercialization, AICTE should also encourage innovative institutional initiatives such as the Dnyaneshwar Vidyapeeth, in Pune. Established in 1980 as an Open University for Technical Education, it has not been recognized by University system or AICTE so far but the contents of its courses, their flexibility, openness to modern developments, the favorable response from industry, the system of final year work experience, very low costs, its use of existing buildings and faculty, its system of selection of students, its rapport with parents are features which elicit admiration and suggest the study of this experiment that deserves to be examined for expanding them on a larger scale in our effort to improve Technical Education system. AICTE norms should be suitably flexible to accommodate such innovative and cost effective experiments and initiatives. ‚ÄîMr. Padmabhooshan Mohan Dharia, Ex - Central Cabinet Minister & Ex - Chairman, 8th Planning commission of India Government California University FCE describes itself as issuing equivalency degree awards. In 2010 an article in The Chronicle of Higher Education stated that it had been removed from a directory run by the U.S. Department of Educations, and that it \\"charges $100 for a service called \\"diploma equivalency.\\" The certificates it issues look very much like real college diplomas.\\" Approval from AICTE and UGC is still pending.http://www.aicte- india.org/downloads/newpgdm.pdf Currently the University Shutdown till further notice.

It encompasses and is situated at an altitude of above sea level. The population, as of 2006, was 1,542. The postal code is 33580. Its territory includes the Nora River, a tributary of the River Fal-Miravete. Located along the National Highway N-634, Lieres is from the capital of Siero, Pola de Siero, and from the town of Nava, Asturias. The villages within the Lieres parish are split by the N-634 highway. Les Faces, La Pedrera, Solvay, La Fresneda, El Cuitu, El Rebollar, La Cruz, El Acebal (L'Acebal, Espinera), La Cig√ºeta, El Monte, Los Barracks, The Slash, Campiello (Campiellu, Cotaya), El Pino, La Caba√±a, and Faya are on one side, while Quintanal d'Arriba, Quintanal d'Abaxu, The Court, The Ventuca The Moldano, Sacadiella, Sorrob√≠n, La Cuesta, El Recuncu, Pi√±uli, and Curuxeu the Cubiella are on the other. The Lieres to Noval√≠n rail line was formally opened November 13, 1891. With the later closure of mines, Lieres' small line rail, linking its mine with Reano, fell into disuse. The railroad was renovated in more recent years. Origin and history Lieres was first documented in history in 1385 in the Book Becerro of the Cathedral of San Salvador in Oviedo. The bishop ordered a census of all properties, jurisdiction of mitra, church constitutions, etc. as well as a state in which they appear. Diocesano inventoried all the churches in their area. The church of Santa Maria de El Moldano in Lieres was included. In 1771, it was changed to St. Maria Lieres. Lieres re-emerged in the 16th century in the book of healing at Oviedo's Cathedral. By the 19th century, Spain, including Lieres and Asturias suffered through two wars. This included the loss of Spanish colonies in the Americas, and the Spanish War of Independence, the war that led to the French invasion in May 1808. Early on, the residents of Siero participated in the conflict brought on by the Spanish War of Independence. In December 1808, the Siero Regiment was established, including 27 officers and 585 soldiers. In the days beginning on March 19, 1809, Marshal Michel Ney and his army seized La Pola. The French army plundered the area, causing serious damage, several deaths, and desolation among the people. In 1810, there was a new invasion of the principality, its mission to seize the capital. It lasted one year and included a battle at the bridge Colloto. There were many acts of vandalism by the French army troops. This instigated guerrilla resistance groups, the most notable being \\"The Nietu\\" of La Pola, the \\"Fombellida\\" in Valdesoto, and the \\"Jerome\\" (or \\"The Xastre\\"). In May 1812, during the Battle of Salamanca, General Bonet, deputy commander under Marshal Auguste de Marmont, suffered significant casualties with the systematic aggression of the guerrillas of Asturias, which lead Bonet to abandon the region and continue the fight on other fronts. Municipal documents created in 1813 did not record any casualties in Lieres as, if casualties had been documented, the widows would have to have been compensated with lifelong pensions. Industry During the 18th century, coal mining transformed Lieres. The British \\"Society of St. Louis\\" moved to Lieres after its economic collapse in the Carbay√≠n parish. Lieres had the best mines of Asturias and the best prices. Though Lieres' main industry for most of the 20th century was mining, the alcohol industry continued as well. As a result of the Cuban War of Independence, Spain needed other sources of sugar. On July 12, 1898, the \\"Sugar Lieres\\" company began operations to produce sugar, manufacturing it from beets, and then distilling alcohol. Culture The monument Palacio de Cavanilles Centi is located in the parish. Notable festivals include: Our Lady of Health (first Sunday in August), Cristo del Agua (first Sunday in September), and San Antonio.

Junon was on a mission to carry trade goods from the √éles des Saintes near Guadeloupe back to France and was part of a succession of French warships sent during 1808 and the early months of 1809 in an effort to break the British blockade of the French Caribbean, which was destroying the economies and morale of the islands. Having landed supplies, Junon's return cargo was intended to improve the economic situation on Guadeloupe with much needed oceanic trade. The patrolling British warships first sighted Junon in the Virgin Islands on 8 February. They then chased her north into the Atlantic Ocean for two days until the frigates HMS Horatio and HMS Latona were able to bring her to action. In a bitterly contested running engagement, Junon was badly damaged and suffered heavy casualties before surrendering to the numerically superior British force. She was later commissioned into the Royal Navy under the same name and remained in the Caribbean. Less than a year after her capture, a French convoy to Guadeloupe recaptured and destroyed Junon; the British subsequently intercepted and defeated the convoy in turn. Background By 1809, the Napoleonic Wars were six years old and the British Royal Navy was dominant at sea. Blockaded in their home ports by British squadrons, French warships, merchant ships and transports were unable to sail and, as a result, the French colonies in the West Indies were largely cut off from France.Gardiner, p. 17 These colonies were also closely blockaded themselves and, as a result, their ability to trade independently was severely curtailed, resulting in economic collapse, severe food shortages and social unrest.James, p. 206 Messages warning of the deteriorating situation in the colonies had been sent during the summer of 1808, particularly from the islands of Martinique and Guadeloupe. In response supplies had been sent from France in small convoys and individual frigates in the autumn. The British blockading ships had also intercepted the communications from the island, and relayed the information to the Admiralty in London, who had ordered Vice-Admiral Sir Alexander Cochrane to assemble a force and invade the French colonies before reinforcements and supplies could reach them.Clowes, p. 283 The majority of the French attempts to reach the Caribbean ended in failure. Several ships were intercepted in the Bay of Biscay, while others reached the Caribbean, only to be defeated by ships from Cochrane's squadron, which was focused on preparations for the invasion of Martinique, planned for February.Gardiner, p. 78 Only two ships reached the islands safely, the 40‚Äìgun frigates Junon at Guadeloupe and Amphitrite at Martinique. By February 1809, Martinique was under attack, distracting most of the available British ships from the blockade of Guadeloupe. Taking advantage of the temporary absence of enemy shipping, Junon slipped out of the √éles des Saintes to the south of Guadeloupe on 4 February and sailed north. The French captain, Jean-Baptiste-Augustin Rousseau, had dropped off his military and food supplies and taken on board large quantities of trade goods for sale in France in an effort to revive the Guadeloupe economy.Brenton, p. 374 Battle At 14:00 on 8 February, four days after leaving the √éles des Saintes, Junon was spotted passing close to the Virgin Islands by the small British brigs HMS Superieure and , who signalled the approaching ship to halt and prepare for boarding.James, p. 149 Ignoring the orders from the smaller ships, Rousseau continued northwards, passing through the Virgin Islands closely followed by Superieure, although Asp was unable to keep up and fell far behind during the night. At 08:00 on the morning of 9 February, with Virgin Gorda northwest, Superieure was close enough to open fire, a few long range shots failing to damage the large frigate, which responded with an ineffective broadside. The gunfire attracted other ships, and during the afternoon Superieure was joined by the British frigate HMS Latona, under Captain Hugh Pigot.Clowes, p. 431 The chase continued through a second night, the French frigate making significant gains over her pursuers but still unable to escape them completely. At 10:30 on 10 February, two sails appeared in the southeast, set on a course that would cut in front of the French frigate. These were the British frigate HMS Horatio under Captain George Scott and the brig HMS Driver.James, p. 150 With enemies on all sides, Rousseau recognised that his only hope of escape lay in defeating Horatio: a swift victory would enable him to outrun pursuit from the east, travelling westwards into the Atlantic. Rapidly closing with the new arrivals, Junon opened fire at 12:36. Horatio immediately responded and then circled the slower French vessel and raked her before Rousseau could respond. Drawing close, the frigates exchanged broadsides at point blank range for 40 minutes. The heavier weight of the French ship soon told, with Scott and his first lieutenant severely wounded and their masts badly damaged. Unable to keep up with the French frigate, whose hull was badly holed but whose masts were only lightly damaged, Horatio fell back.James, p. 151 Rousseau had also been badly wounded in the exchange, and command of Junon passed to Lieutenant Jean-L√©on Emeric, who attempted to pull away from his battered adversary. As he did so the small brig Driver was well placed to intervene, but her captain, Charles Claridge, failed to engage the larger frigate, even though Latona was now rapidly approaching from the west and together they could have outnumbered and outmanoeuvred Junon. Superieure was also close by, and her captain, William Ferrie, did approach the larger French ship, his fire causing enough damage to Junon's sails to prevent her escape.Brenton, p. 375 Taking Horatio in tow at 14:24, the brig kept Scott's frigate in the chase until sufficient repairs were complete. By 14:40 Horatio was again sailing independently and Driver finally came close enough to open fire, although at extreme range: Claridge refused to sail any closer to Junon, despite urgent signals from Horatio and Superieure. At 15:04, Superieure was again close enough to the French ship to open fire and at 15:25 Latona arrived, her presence finally convincing Claridge to enter the action. Surrounded by enemy ships and his sails in tatters, Emeric made one last effort to escape to the north, the strain of this manoeuvre causing his main and mizen masts to collapse. With both flight and resistance impossible, Junon surrendered at 15:40.Clowes, p. 432 Aftermath Officers from Latona were first to board the French frigate but Emeric refused to tender his formal surrender except to an officer of Horatio because he insisted that Horatio had caused the entirety of Junons damage. British historians have debated this opinion: William James agreed with this assessment, but also opined that if Horatio had been alone it would have been Scott surrendering rather than the French officers, such was the damage his ship had suffered in the battle.James, p. 153 Edward Pelham Brenton, who was a serving officer in the Caribbean at the time, gives most of the credit for the victory to Latona,Brenton, p. 376 in a detailed account that James later criticised for its inaccuracies. The battered Junon was taken in tow to Halifax, Nova Scotia, where she was repaired and later commissioned into the Royal Navy under the same name. The prisoners were also landed in Nova Scotia, including Rousseau, who died from his wounds soon afterwards. The French lost approximately 130 casualties; British losses were seven killed and 26 wounded on Horatio, six wounded on Latona and one man wounded on Driver. The British commanders and crews were praised for their actions in the battle, with the exception of Claridge in Driver. Both James and Brenton in their later histories heavily criticised his noted reluctance to engage the enemy. By contrast William Ferrie, commander of Superieure was commended for maintaining combat with the much larger frigate whenever possible.James, p. 152 Four decades later, in 1847, the Admiralty recognized the battle with the clasps \\"Horatio 10 Feby. 1809\\" and \\"Superieure 10 Feby. 1809\\" to the Naval General Service Medal, which it awarded upon application to all British participants then still living. In the month following the capture of Junon, Guadeloupe was the only French colony in the Caribbean not under attack; Martinique fell to the British on 24 February and Spanish forces continued their Siege of Santo Domingo.Gardiner, p. 79 The French did make further attempts to resupply the islands; a major expedition was defeated off Guadeloupe in April, and elements of this force that reached the island were defeated and captured during June and July. With British forces distracted by the ongoing Reconquista in Santo Domingo, the focus of the campaign moved north, and it was not until a second major expedition arrived in December that significant British forces returned to the Leeward Islands for the final invasion of Guadeloupe. The influx of British reinforcements was too late for HMS Junon; on 13 December she had been cruising alone to the east of Antigua and been surprised by Fran√ßois Roquebert's squadron of four French frigates. Outnumbered and surrounded, Junon fought hard but was eventually forced to surrender after Captain John Shortland was mortally wounded.Woodman, p. 243 Reduced to a sinking condition in the engagement, Junon was set on fire and abandoned by Roquebert, whose ships were intercepted five days later off Guadeloupe and defeated: two were destroyed and two others returned to France without landing their supplies.Clowes, p. 447  References  ;Citations ;Bibliography  * * Category:Naval battles of the Napoleonic Wars Category:Conflicts in 1809 Category:Naval battles involving France Category:Naval battles involving the United Kingdom Category:February 1809 events Category:Maritime incidents in 1809 ","title":"Action of 10 February 1809"},{"id":"21715175","text":"William Crawford (1784 ‚Äì February 28, 1849) was a United States District Judge of the United States District Court for the Middle District of Alabama, the United States District Court for the Northern District of Alabama and the United States District Court for the Southern District of Alabama.

History  The four locomotives were delivered to the LDE in 1838 by Edward Bury and Company of Liverpool, England. They were given the names EDWARD BURY, DRACHE, ADLER and PFEIL. The locomotives were retired between 1847 and 1854.  Technical features  The boiler was rivetted from several sections. The outer firebox was furnished with a dome that projected a long way forward over the boiler barrel and acted as the steam collection space. The two spring balance safety valves were located on the outer firebox. Two piston pumps provided boiler feedwater; they were driven via an eccentric cam from one of the axles. The steam cylinder was based on English construction principles and located inside under the level of the axles which meant it required an expensive and heavy cranked axle. The engine drove the second coupled axle. The steam engine was probably fitted with a simple Stephenson valve gear without a steam expansion stage, which would not have permitted any control of steam admission. The locomotives did not have their own braking equipment. Braking could only be achieved using a hand-operated screw brake on the tender.

Photographed in Via delle Casine. A high water mark is a point that represents the maximum rise of a body of water over land. Such a mark is often the result of a flood, but high water marks may reflect an all-time high, an annual high (highest level to which water rose that year) or the high point for some other division of time. Knowledge of the high water mark for an area is useful in managing the development of that area, particularly in making preparations for flood surges.J. Curtis Weaver and Thomas J. Zembrzuski, Jr., \\"August 31, 1993, Storm Surge and Flood of Hurricane Emily on Hatteras Island, North Carolina\\", in Charles A. Perry, L. J. Combs, Summary of floods in the United States, January 1992 through September 1993 (1995), U.S. Geological Survey Water-Supply Paper 2499, p. 260, stating: Documentation of notable coastal floods provides scientists and flood-plain managers with useful data and technical information for an improved understanding of the hazard and for improved management of flood-prone areas. Of particular importance is documentation of the duration of flooding (and rates of rise and recession of floodwaters), maximum flood elevations and depths, and delineation of the extent of storm-surge flooding. High water marks from floods have been measured for planning purposes since at least as far back as the civilizations of ancient Egypt.Daniel Kahneman, Thinking, Fast and Slow (2011), p. 137. It is a common practice to create a physical marker indicating one or more of the highest water marks for an area, usually with a line at the level to which the water rose, and a notation of the date on which this high water mark was set. This may be a free-standing flood level sign or other marker, or it may be affixed to a building or other structure that was standing at the time of the flood that set the mark.Nancy McTigue, James M. Symons, The Water Dictionary: A Comprehensive Reference of Water Terminology (2011), p. 284. A high water mark is not necessarily an actual physical mark,Bruce S. Flushman, Water Boundaries: Demystifying Land Boundaries Adjacent to Tidal Or Navigable Waters (2001), p. 73. but it is possible for water rising to a high point to leave a lasting physical impression such as floodwater staining. A landscape marking left by the high water mark of ordinary tidal action may be called a strandline and is typically composed of debris left by high tide. The area at the top of a beach where debris is deposited is an example of this phenomenon. Where there are tides, this line is formed by the highest position of the tide, and moves up and down the beach on a fortnightly cycle. The debris is chiefly composed of rotting seaweed, but can also include a large amount of litter, either from ships at sea or from sewage outflows. Ecological significance The strandline is an important habitat for a variety of animals. In parts of the United Kingdom, sandhoppers such as Talitrus saltator and the seaweed fly Coelopa frigida are abundant in the rotting seaweed, and these invertebrates provide food for shore birds such as the rock pipit, turnstone and pied wagtail, and mammals such as brown hares, foxes, voles and mice. Legal significance One kind of high water mark is the ordinary high water mark or average high water mark, the high water mark that can be expected to be produced by a body of water in non-flood conditions. The ordinary high water mark may have legal significance and is often being used to demarcate property boundaries.Bruce S. Flushman, Water Boundaries: Demystifying Land Boundaries Adjacent to Tidal Or Navigable Waters (2001), p. 72. The ordinary high water mark has also been used for other legal demarcations. For example, a 1651 analysis of laws passed by the English Parliament notes that for persons granted the title Admiral of the English Seas, \\"the Admirals power extended even to the high water mark, and into the main streams\\".Nathaniel Bacon, The Continuation of an Historicall Discourse, of the Government of England until the end of the Reign of Queen Elizabeth (1651), p. 44. In the United States, the high water mark is also significant because the United States Constitution gives Congress the authority to legislate for waterways, and the high water mark is used to determine the geographic extent of that authority. Federal regulations (33 CFR 328.3(e)) define the \\"ordinary high water mark\\" (OHWM) as \\"that line on the shore established by the fluctuations of water and indicated by physical characteristics such as a clear, natural line impressed on the bank, shelving, changes in the character of soil, destruction of terrestrial vegetation, the presence of litter and debris, or other appropriate means that consider the characteristics of the surrounding areas. For the purposes of Section 404 of the Clean Water Act, the OHWM defines the lateral limits of federal jurisdiction over non-tidal water bodies in the absence of adjacent wetlands. For the purposes of Sections 9 and 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899, the OHWM defines the lateral limits of federal jurisdiction over traditional navigable waters of the US. The OHWM is used by the United States Army Corps of Engineers, the United States Environmental Protection Agency, and other federal agencies to determine the geographical extent of their regulatory programs. Likewise, many states use similar definitions of the OHWM for the purposes of their own regulatory programs. In 2016, the Court of Appeals of Indiana ruled that land below the OHWM (as defined by common law) along Lake Michigan is held by the state in trust for public use. . In Australia, the definition of the Mean High Water Mark is '...the line of the medium high tide between the highest tide of each lunar month (the springs) and the lowest each lunar month (the Neaps) averaged over the year.'

This method can rapidly amplify minute amounts of DNA samples to a reasonable quantity for genomic analysis. The reaction starts by annealing random hexamer primers to the template: DNA synthesis is carried out by a high fidelity enzyme, preferentially Œ¶29 DNA polymerase. Compared with conventional PCR amplification techniques, MDA does not employ sequence-specific primers but amplifies all DNA, generates larger sized products with a lower error frequency, and works at a constant temperature. MDA has been actively used in whole genome amplification (WGA) and is a promising method for application to single cell genome sequencing and sequencing-based genetic studies.  Background  Many biological and forensic cases involving genetic analysis require sequencing of DNA from minute amounts of sample, such as DNA from uncultured single cells or trace amounts of tissue collected from crime scenes. Conventional Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR)-based DNA amplification methods require sequence-specific oligonucleotide primers and heat-stable (usually Taq) polymerase, and can be used to generate significant amounts of DNA from minute amounts of DNA. However, this is not sufficient for modern techniques which use sequencing-based DNA analysis. Therefore, a more efficient non-sequence-specific method to amplify minute amounts of DNA is necessary, especially in single cell genomic studies.  Materials  MDA reaction steps = Phi 29 DNA polymerase = Bacteriophage Œ¶29 DNA polymerase is a high-processivity enzyme that can produce DNA amplicons greater than 70 kilobase pairs. Its high fidelity and 3‚Äô-5' proofreading activity reduces the amplification error rate to 1 in 106‚àí107 bases compared to conventional Taq polymerase with a reported error rate of 1 in 9,000. The reaction can be carried out at a moderate isothermal condition of 30 ¬∞C and therefore does not require a thermocycler. It has been actively used in cell-free cloning, which is the enzymatic method of amplifying DNA in vitro without cell culturing and DNA extraction. The large fragment of Bst DNA polymerase is also used in MDA, but –§29 is generally preferred due to its sufficient product yield and proofreading activity. = Hexamer primers = Hexamer primers are sequences composed of six random nucleotides. For MDA applications, these primers are usually thiophosphate-modified at their 3‚Äô end to convey resistance to the 3‚Äô-5‚Äô exonuclease activity of –§29 DNA polymerase. MDA reactions start with the annealing of such primers to the DNA template followed by polymerase-mediated chain elongation. Increasing numbers of primer annealing events happen along the amplification reaction. = Reaction = The amplification reaction initiates when multiple primer hexamers anneal to the template. When DNA synthesis proceeds to the next starting site, the polymerase displaces the newly produced DNA strand and continues its strand elongation. The strand displacement generates newly synthesized single stranded DNA template for more primers to anneal. Further primer annealing and strand displacement on the newly synthesized template results in a hyper-branched DNA network. The sequence debranching during amplification results in high yield of the products. To separate the DNA branching network, S1 nucleases are used to cleave the fragments at displacement sites. The nicks on the resulting DNA fragments are repaired by DNA polymerase I. none = Product quality = MDA can generate 1-2 ¬µg of DNA from single cell with genome coverage of up to 99%. Products also have lower error rate and larger sizes compared to PCR based Taq amplification. General work flow of MDA: # Sample preparation: Samples are collected and diluted in the appropriate reaction buffer (Ca2+ and Mg2+ free). Cells are lysed with alkaline buffer. # Condition: The MDA reaction with –§29 polymerase is carried out at 30 ¬∞C. The reaction usually takes about 2.5-3 hours. # End of reaction: Inactivate enzymes at 65 ¬∞C before collection of the amplified DNA products # DNA products can be purified with commercial purification kit.  Advantages  MDA generates sufficient yield of DNA products. It is a powerful tool of amplifying DNA molecules from samples, such as uncultured microorganism or single cells to the amount that would be sufficient for sequencing studies. The large size of MDA-amplified DNA products also provides desirable sample quality for identifying the size of polymorphic repeat alleles. Its high fidelity also makes it reliable to be used in the single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) allele detection. Due to its strand displacement during amplification, the amplified DNA has sufficient coverage of the source DNA molecules, which provides high quality product for genomic analysis. The products of displaced strands can be subsequently cloned into vectors to construct library for subsequent sequencing reactions.  Limitations  Allelic dropout (ADO) = ADO is defined as the random non- amplification of one of the alleles present in a heterozygous sample. Some studies have reported the ADO rate of the MDA products to be 0-60%. This drawback decreases the accuracy of genotyping of single sample and misdiagnosis in other MDA involved applications. ADO appears to be independent of the fragment sizes and has been reported to have similar rate in other single-cell techniques. Possible solutions are the use of different lysis conditions or to carry out multiple rounds of amplifications from the diluted MDA products since PCR mediated amplification from cultured cells has been reported to give lower ADO rates. = Preferential amplification = 'Preferential amplification' is over-amplification of one of the alleles in comparison to the other. Most studies on MDA have reported this issue. The amplification bias is currently observed to be random. It might affect the analysis of small stretches of genomic DNA in identifying Short Tandem Repeats (STR) alleles. = Primer-primer interactions = Endogenous template- independent primer-primer interaction is due to the random design of hexamer primers. One possible solution is to design constrained-randomized hexanucleotide primers that do not cross-hybridize.  Applications  Single cell genome sequencing = Single cells of uncultured bacteria, archaea and protists, as well as individual viral particles and single fungal spores have been sequenced with the help of MDA. The ability to sequence individual cells is also useful in combating human disease. Genomes from single human embryonic cells have been successfully amplified for sequencing using MDA, allowing preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD): screening for genetic health issues in an early-stage embryo before implantation. Diseases with heterogeneous properties, such as cancer, also benefit from MDA-based genome sequencing's ability to study mutations in individual cells. The MDA products from a single cell have also been successfully used in array-comparative genomic hybridization experiments, which usually require a relatively large amount of amplified DNA. = Chromatin immunoprecipitation = Chromatin Immunoprecipitation results in production of complex mixtures of relatively short DNA fragments, which is challenging to amplify with MDA without causing a bias in the fragment representation. A method to circumvent this problem was proposed, which is based on conversion of these mixtures to circular concatemers using ligation, followed by Œ¶29 DNA polymerase-mediated MDA. = Forensic analysis = Trace amount of samples collected from crime scenes can be amplified by MDA to the quantity that is enough for forensic DNA analysis, which is commonly used in identifying victims and suspects.

Vetigastropoda is a major taxonomic group of sea snails, marine gastropod mollusks that form a very ancient lineage. Taxonomically the Vetigastropoda are sometimes treated as an order, although they are treated as an unranked clade in Bouchet and Rocroi, 2005. Vetigastropods are considered to be among the most primitive living gastropods, and are widely distributed in all oceans of the world. Their habitats range from the deep sea to intertidal zones. Many have shells with slits or other secondary openings. One of their main characteristics is the presence of intersected crossed platy shell structure. Most vetigastropods have some bilateral asymmetry of their organ systems. Description Vetigastropods range in size from approximately 0.08 in (2 mm) long in the case of Scissurelloidea or Skeneoidea, to more than 11.8 in (300 mm) in length, as with the Haliotoidea. External colours and patterns are typically drab, but such groups as the Tricolioidea and some Trochoidea and Pleurotomarioidea have bright colours and glossy shells. The clade is characterized by having an intersected crossed platy shell structure. Shells range from elongate turret-shaped structures, to near-spherical. Shell sculpture varies greatly from simple concentric growth lines, which may or may not be barely visible on the shell surface, to heavy radial and axial ribbing. The shell aperture is normally oval, and often tangential to the coiling axis. Most species have an operculum (a small lid-like organ). Within the shell, Vetigastropods have a single pair of cephalic tentacles, and a distinct snout containing the mouth. The lateral sides of the body typically have sensory epipodial tentacles. Distribution Vetigastropods are found throughout all oceans of the world, including tropical areas, temperate regions, and under polar ice. Habitat Vetigastropods are present in most marine environments from intertidal zones to the deep sea. They exist on rocky substrates, in soft sediments, and some have been found at deep-sea hydrothermal vents and cold seeps. Behaviour Most vetigastropods are dioecious, although some deep-sea varieties are hermaphrodites. Vetigastropods usually eject their gametes directly into the sea for fertilization, thus there is no courtship or mating between individuals for most species. Diet Vetigastropods typically feed on such organisms as bryozoans, tunicates, and sponges. Several species such as Haliotoidea and Trochoidea have evolved to feed directly on such plant material as algae and marine angiosperms. Deep-sea vetigastropods typically consume sediment. Reproduction Vetigastropods normally have very small eggs that produce lecithotrophic (yolk feeding) or non-feeding larvae. Many vetigastropods secrete egg envelopes and have glandular pallial structures that produce masses of jelly-coated eggs. Larger species typically have yearly cycles of spawning, and produce millions of eggs per reproductive season. Smaller species produce fewer eggs, but can spawn year round. Taxonomy The Vetigastropoda have been referred to as a superorder as recently as at least 2007, by M. Harzhauser and in 2005 by D. Heidelberger and L. Koch following Ponder & Lindberg, 1997, although Bouchet & Rocroi, 2005 refer to this group simply as a clade, leaving taxonomic determination as a future option. The World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS) follows Bouchet & Rocroi regarding the taxonomic content of the Gastropoda but gives ranks to the higher taxa and defines Vetigastropoda as a subclass. Gofas, S. (2010). Gastropoda. World Register of Marine Species Bouchet & Rocroi, 2005 treats the Vetigastropoda as a major clade and as a sister clade to the Caenogastropoda but includes the Vetigastropoda in what are referred to as Basal taxa that are certainly Gastropoda. Ponder & Lindberg, 1997 previously assigned the Vetigastropoda, as a superorder, to the Subclass Orthogastropoda. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that this taxon is one of the four natural groups within the Gastropoda: Vetigastropoda, Caenogastropoda, Patellogastropoda, and Heterobranchia. Research on the mitochondrial genome arrangement has shown that the Vetigastropoda (and Caenogastropoda) mostly retain the ancestral gene arrangement. =Superfamilies= Superfamilies within the Vetigastropoda include: * Not assigned to a superfamily within Vetigastropoda are: ** the families: Ataphridae Cossmann, 1915, Pendromidae War√©n, 1991 (synonym: Trachysmatidae Thiele, 1925), ‚Ä† Schizogoniidae ** the genera: Sahlingia War√©n & Bouchet, 2001 *Superfamily ‚Ä†Amberleyoidea *Superfamily Angarioidea (created as a new superfamily by Williams et al.

The Toronto Maple Leafs earned 71 points during the regular season to finish sixteenth overall in the league. This was the second playoff meeting between these two teams, with the only previous meeting being the 1978 Quarter-finals, where Toronto defeated the Islanders in seven games. The Islanders won three of the four games in this season's regular season series. Toronto was swept in the opening round of the playoffs for the second consecutive year. New York's series-clinching win in game three was the first (and to date only) time that the Islanders have won a playoff game in Toronto, and this was also only the second (and to date, last) victory that a road team has ever earned in the three series between these two franchises. As of 2019, this series marks the only time that the Islanders have defeated Toronto in the Stanley Cup playoffs. In game one, the Islanders scored three times on the power play, and Bryan Trottier scored twice and added three assists in a decisive 9-2 victory. The Islanders dominance of the Maple Leafs continued in game two, as Trottier recorded a hat trick in a 5-1 Islanders win. The Islanders jumped all over the Maple Leafs quickly in game three, by jumping out to a 5-0 lead after the first period. The Maple Leafs and Islanders traded goals in the second period 19 seconds apart. Game three ended in a series-clinching 6-1 Islanders victory. = (2) St. Louis Blues vs. (15) Pittsburgh Penguins = The St. Louis Blues entered the playoffs as the Smythe Division champions, earning 107 points. The Pittsburgh Penguins earned 73 points during the regular season to finish fifteenth overall in the league. This was the third and most recent series between these two teams; the teams split the previous two series. Their most recent meeting was in the 1975 Preliminary round, where Pittsburgh defeated St. Louis in two games. The teams split this season's four game series. In game one of the series, Pittsburgh struck quickly thanks to a Greg Malone goal at 0:15 of the first period. However, the Blues recovered by the end of the second period and took a 3-2 lead into the final period, which they held on to, winning the game 4-2. Game two proved to be a different story, as the Penguins exploded offensively and scored four times in the second period to erase a 1-0 first period deficit. The Blues and Penguins traded goals in the third period, giving Pittsburgh a 6-4 victory that tied the series at a game apiece. Game three went back and forth, with both teams trading goals all game long until Bernie Federko scored his second goal of the game with 4:06 left to play in the third period. The Blues won the game 5-4 and retook home ice advantage in the best-of-five series. The Penguins avoided elimination in game four, as Randy Carlyle and Mike Bullard each scored three points in the game, helping the Penguins to a 6-3 win. Game five was another tight contest and for the first time in the series overtime was required, with the score tied at 3 after regulation time. The game and series ended on Mike Crombeen's second goal of the series, scored at 5:16 of the second overtime period, giving St. Louis a 4-3 win and a 3-2 series victory. = (3) Montreal Canadiens vs. (14) Edmonton Oilers = The Montreal Canadiens entered the playoffs as the Wales Conference and Norris Division champions, earning 103 points. The Edmonton Oilers earned 74 points during the regular season and finished fourteenth overall, losing the tiebreaker with the New York Rangers in wins (30 to 29). This was the first and to date only playoff meeting between these two teams. The teams split this season's four game series. The Oilers recorded the first series sweep in franchise history and their first playoff series victory since joining the NHL in 1979. The Oilers gained a 6-3 victory in game one, in large part due to Wayne Gretzky's five-assist night. At the time this was a new playoff record for assists by a single player in one game. Edmonton went on to win game two, with Risto Siltanen's power play goal at 4:43 of the second period giving the Oilers a 2-1 lead, Edmonton eventually winning the game by a score of 3-1. Edmonton completed the sweep of the heavily-favoured Canadiens in game three, defeating Montreal 6-2. Gretzky led all scorers in the three game series, finishing with 11 points (3G, 8A). = (4) Los Angeles Kings vs. (13) New York Rangers = The Los Angeles Kings entered the playoffs as the fourth overall seed in the league with 99 points, winning the tiebreaker with the Buffalo Sabres in wins (43 to 39). The New York Rangers earned 74 points during the regular season and finished thirteenth overall, winning the tiebreaker with the Edmonton Oilers in wins (30 to 29). This was the second playoff meeting between these two teams, with the only previous meeting being the 1979 Preliminary round, where New York defeated Los Angeles in two games. The Kings won three of the four games in this season's series. The Rangers won game one in large part due to the impressive goaltending performance of Steve Baker, as he turned away 31 of the Kings' 32 shots. Game two was marked by a brawl at the end of the first period; six players were ejected from the game as result of this. The Kings won game two 5-4 on the strength of a Dean Hopkins goal at 17:16 of the third period. Game three was dominated by the Rangers, as eight different players would score in the game for New York, and the Rangers won 10-3 on home ice. Game four was tied 3-3 in the third period, until Tom Laidlaw's goal at 6:44 gave the Rangers a 4-3 lead. The Rangers added two more goals in the third, earning a series-clinching 6-3 victory. Ranger forwards Ron Duguay and Ulf Nilsson each scored a goal in every game of this series. = (5) Buffalo Sabres vs. (12) Vancouver Canucks = The Buffalo Sabres entered the playoffs as the Adams Division champions, earning 99 points, losing the tiebreaker with the Los Angeles Kings in wins (43 to 39). The Vancouver Canucks earned 76 points during the regular season and finished twelfth overall in the league. This was the second and most recent playoff meeting between these two teams, with the only previous meeting being the 1980 Preliminary round, where Buffalo defeated Vancouver in four games. The teams split this season's four game series. The Sabres swept Vancouver in three games, eliminating the Canucks in the preliminary round for the second consecutive season. Buffalo forced game one to overtime as Andre Savard scored the tying goal with just 8 seconds left in the third period. Rookie centre Alan Haworth scored the game-winning goal for Buffalo five minutes into overtime. The Sabres scored three times on the power play in game two, winning the game 5-2. Vancouver attempted to mount a comeback from a 4-1 deficit in the third period of game three before Buffalo's Tony McKegney scored his second goal of the game, giving the Sabres a 5-3 lead. Buffalo hung on to their 5-3 lead and clinched the series with a game three victory. = (6) Philadelphia Flyers vs. (11) Quebec Nordiques = The Philadelphia Flyers entered the playoffs as the sixth seed in the league with 97 points. The Quebec Nordiques earned 78 points during the regular season and finished eleventh overall, losing the tiebreaker with the Chicago Black Hawks in wins (31 to 30). This was the first playoff meeting between these two teams. Quebec won the season series earning five of eight points in this year's four game season series. This series also marked the first appearance of a team representing Quebec City in the Stanley Cup playoffs in 68 years. The most recent team to represent Quebec City prior to this was the Quebec Bulldogs who won the Stanley Cup in 1913, in the Bulldogs' final playoff appearance. The home team won all games of this series. Bill Barber and Ken Linseman scored five points each in the first two games of the series. The Flyers won both games in Philadelphia, taking a 2-0 series lead. Game three was a battle of goaltenders, as the game remained scoreless until 9:48 of the third period, when Michel Goulet scored the eventual game-winning goal; Quebec won game three 2-0. Philadelphia took a 3-1 lead into the third period in game four, however the Nordiques made a comeback, tying the game in the third period. Quebec completed the comeback 37 seconds into overtime as Dale Hunter scored the game-winning goal. Ken Linseman's three points in the third period of Game five helped ensure a Philadelphia series-clinching win, 5-2. = (7) Calgary Flames vs. (10) Chicago Black Hawks = The Calgary Flames entered the playoffs as the seventh seed in the league with 92 points. The Chicago Black Hawks earned 78 points during the regular season and finished tenth overall, winning the tiebreaker with the Quebec Nordiques in wins (31 to 30). This was the first playoff meeting between these two teams. Chicago won the season series, earning five of eight points in the year's four game season series. This series also marked the first appearance of a team representing Calgary in the Stanley Cup playoffs in 56 years. The most recent team to represent Calgary prior to this was the Calgary Tigers who lost the WCHL Final in 1925. The Flames recorded their first sweep and first playoff series victory in franchise history. In game one, Calgary's Kent Nilsson recorded a point on every Calgary goal, helping the Flames to a 4-3 win. Calgary scored three times in the third period of game two and won the game decisively by a score of 6-2. The Black Hawks heavily out-shot the Flames in game three; Rejean Lemelin made 61 saves for the Flames. Chicago tied the game on a Darryl Sutter goal with 43 seconds left in the third period. However the Black Hawks came up short in double overtime as Willi Plett scored the series-clinching goal for the Flames at 15:17. = (8) Boston Bruins vs. (9) Minnesota North Stars = The Boston Bruins entered the playoffs as the eighth seed in the league with 87 points, winning the tiebreaker with the Minnesota North Stars in wins (37 to 35). The North Stars earned 87 points during the regular season and finished ninth overall, losing the tiebreaker with the Bruins in wins (37 to 35). This was the first and to date only series between these two teams. Boston won the season series, earning five of eight points in the year's four game season series. The North Stars swept the Bruins in three games. Minnesota won game one in overtime due to Steve Payne's hat trick goal at 3:34. The North Stars' win in game one was the first-ever victory for the franchise in the Boston Garden (they went winless in their first 35 games in Boston over fourteen seasons). In game two, Boston's Brad Park and Minnesota's Dino Ciccarelli both scored four points in a high-scoring 9-6 Minnesota victory. The North Stars scored four times in the first period of game three and they did not relinquish the lead, eliminating the Bruins with a 6-3 win. Quarterfinals(1) New York Islanders vs. (8) Edmonton Oilers= This was the first playoff meeting between these two teams. The Islanders won the season series earning six of eight points in the year's four-game regular season series. The Islanders eliminated the Oilers in six games; the Islanders also scored a power play goal in every game of this series. The Islanders' special teams dominated game one, as New York scored three times on the power play and added a shorthanded goal in an 8-2 Islanders win. Denis Potvin's hat trick and five point night in game two led the Islanders to a 6-3 victory. Wayne Gretzky scored his second hat trick of the playoffs in game three as the Oilers won the game by a score of 5-2. The Islanders won game four in overtime as Ken Morrow scored at 5:41 to give New York a 5-4 win. When Edmonton won game five 4-3, the Oilers' victory marked the only time in the 1981 Stanley Cup playoffs that the Islanders lost a game on home ice. Bob Nystrom's third goal of the playoffs in Game six became the eventual series-clinching goal for the Islanders as New York won the game 5-2. = (2) St. Louis Blues vs. (7) New York Rangers = This was the first and to date only series between these two teams. St. Louis won the season series winning all four games of this year's regular season series. The Rangers eliminated the Blues in six games. Bernie Federko's three point night in Game one led St. Louis to a 6‚Äì3 victory. The Rangers overcame a one-goal deficit in the third period of Game two by scoring three goals in a span of 2:46, winning the game by a score of 6‚Äì4 and evening the series at one game each. Anders Hedberg's go ahead goal in third period of Game two was just the second successful penalty shot in Stanley Cup playoff history. The Rangers dominated the second period of Game three scoring four goals on fifteen shots taking a three-goal lead into the third period. New York hung on to win the game 6‚Äì3. Steve Baker allowed just one goal on 34 shots in Game four leading the Rangers to a 4‚Äì1 victory and a commanding 3‚Äì1 series lead. With the Blues trailing 3‚Äì2 in the second period of Game five Jorgen Pettersson scored his third goal of the playoffs tying the game at 3, he scored a power play goal in the third period giving the Blues a 4‚Äì3 victory. The Blues trailed in Game six 4‚Äì0 before scoring three goals in 1:50, however they were never able to get on equal terms losing the game 7‚Äì4 and series 4‚Äì2. =(3) Buffalo Sabres vs. (6) Minnesota North Stars= This was the second playoff meeting between these two teams, with Buffalo sweeping the only previous meeting in two games in the 1977 Stanley Cup Preliminary Round.

Spring had come early that year, followed by an abnormally hot dry spell that lasted into the summer. This created ideal conditions for the ensuing disaster, in which a number of smaller fires converged. Porcupine, a community on the north side of Porcupine Lake, in the city of Timmins, Ontario, Canada, was the site of a huge gold discovery in 1907. On July 11, 1911, when the Porcupine Gold Rush was at its height, a gale from the southwest whipped some small bush fires into flames. As the fire gained strength, it engulfed the tinder-dry forest, razing everything in its path. Casualties and destruction The blaze formed a horseshoe-shaped front over wide with flames shooting into the air. It laid waste to about 200,000 hectares (over 494,000 acres) of forest and killed at least 70 people, though early reports indicated thousands. Many people were drowned as they fled into Porcupine Lake to escape the flames, while others suffocated to death under the mines. At one point, a car of dynamite stored at the railway station exploded, lashing the lake into waves 3 metres (nine feet) high. The exact number of dead is not known as the vast forest in the region contained an unknown number of prospectors at the time of the fire. Official counts list 73 dead, though it is estimated the actual toll could have been as high as 200. Mining camps and the boomtowns of South Porcupine and Pottsville were destroyed; Golden City (now called Porcupine) and Porquis Junction were partially destroyed. The next day, the fire swept through the nearby town of Cochrane. Aftermath Communities throughout Ontario responded generously with aid. Because of the importance of the gold discoveries, very few people abandoned the mining camps and, remarkably, the area was rebuilt in a short period of time. One unexpected result of the fire was the creation of a fresh water spring where explosives had blown up. The aftermath of the disaster brought a renewed sense of purpose to the devastated communities. A monument erected at the Whitney Cemetery by the Toronto Board of Trade, commemorates the event and the victims.

It is the only school in Western Mindanao that offers courses in marine studies and fisheries. It is located at the heart of Zamboanga City, alongside Fort Pilar Shrine. History The college was established in 1956 as the Southern Mindanao branch of the Philippine Institute of Fisheries Technology (PIFT), the predecessor of the U.P. in the Visayas - College of Fisheries. In 1965, the SMSF became the first fishery school under the Department of Education to attain college status by virtue of R.A. No. 3434 and was renamed Mindanao Regional School of Fisheries (MRSF). In 1980, the MRSF was included as one of the eight project institutes of the Sixth Education Project of the Philippine government that were developed into Regional Institutes of Fisheries Technology (RIFTs) through a US$38 million loan package from the World Bank. In 1986, the college was granted its charter and the mandate to develop and implement courses in fisheries, maritime technology, marine sciences, development management, food technology and computer science with the issuance of P.D. No. 2020 converting the then MRSF-RIFT into the Zamboanga State College of Marine Sciences and Technology (ZSCMST). =Recent years= From 1995 to 2003 the ZSCMST served as the center/lead agency of the Southern Mindanao Aquatic Resources Research and Development Zonal Network.

As of 2015, there are about 8 million overseas Indonesians globally.  History  Since ancient times, people from various ethnic groups of Indonesia (then known as the Malay archipelago or \\"Nusantara\\") have been leaving their hometowns to other parts of the world for purposes of trade, education, labor, or travel. During the colonial era, many Indonesians were sent for enslavement by the Dutch East Indies to their other colonies such as Suriname and New Caledonia, while political dissidents against Dutch colonization were sent to South Africa from Indonesia during the 18th century, forming a group known as Cape Malays. Some ethnic groups outside of Indonesia also have Indonesian ancestry; for example, the Malagasy people are descended from Borneo seafarers who traveled to Madagascar from the Malay Archipelago in the 7th and 8th centuries during the peak of the maritime Srivijaya empire. = Merantau = The practice of going abroad has been motivated by the Merantau culture of the Indonesian people since ancient times. Merantau has been associated deeply with the Minangkabau people as a cultural way of life. A Minangkabau man at the time of young adulthood (20‚Äì30 years old) is often encouraged to go abroad as part of the Minangkabau culture; this serves as a sign of manhood to accrue wealth, knowledge, and life experience. This practice can be traced to the 7th century, when Minangkabau merchants played a major role in establishing of the Malay kingdom in Jambi, which was a strategic position for trade via the Silk Road. Other Indonesian ethnic groups such as the Bugis, Banjar, Madura, Aceh, Batak, and Javanese have also been traveling overseas to gain opportunities, experience, knowledge, and versatility.  Indonesians Worldwide  Australia = Before Dutch and British sailors arrived in Australia, Indonesians from Southern Sulawesi have explored the Australia northern coast. Each year, the Bugis sailors would sail down on the northwestern monsoon in their wooden pinisi. They would stay in Australia for several months to trade and take tripang (or dried sea cucumber) before returning to Makassar on the dry season off shore winds. These trading voyages continued until 1907. Nowadays, many Indonesian residents of Australia are either foreign students or workers, with a large number being of Chinese Indonesian heritage. Furthermore, the Cocos Malays are descendants of native Indonesians were brought by the Clunies-Ross family to work in the copra industry in the 19th century. = Hong Kong = Indonesians are the second largest foreigner group after Filipinos, mainly working as female domestic helpers from Java Island. There are also several Chinese Indonesian families and students that reside in Hong Kong. Central and Wan Chai are the main districts that most Indonesians live in. = Japan = In 2013, approximately 20,000 Indonesians lived in Japan, including about 3,000 illegal Indonesians. These numbers dropped from the previous years for various reasons, including the high cost of living in Japan and the difficulty of finding jobs in Japan. Most of them are in Japan for a short term and deportation remains high for Indonesian residents. = Malaysia = Malaysia shares a land border with Indonesia and both countries share many aspects of their culture, including mutually intelligible national languages. Populations have long moved between the areas which make up the modern-day states. Since the distinction between the two regions emerged in the early 19th century, many people from Java, Kalimantan, Sumatra, and Sulawesi, which are located in modern-day Indonesia, migrated and settled in the Malay Peninsula and in Malaysian Borneo. These earlier populations have mostly effectively or partially assimilated with the larger Malaysian-Malay community due to religious, social and cultural similarities. Currently, it is also estimated that there are around 2 million Indonesian citizens in Malaysia at any given time, ranging from all types of backgrounds including a significant majority of labour migrants alongside a considerable number of professionals and students. = Netherlands = Indonesia was a colony of the Netherlands from 1605 until 1945. In the early 20th century, many Indonesian students studied in the Netherlands. Most of them lived in Leiden and were active in the Perhimpoenan Indonesia (Indonesian Association). During and after the Indonesian National Revolution, many Moluccans and Indo people, people of mixed Dutch and Indonesian ancestry migrated to the Netherlands. Most of them were former members of the KNIL army. In this way, around 360,000 Indo people and Totoks (white people) and 12,500 persons from Maluke ancestry were settled in the Netherlands. Giovanni van Bronckhorst, Denny Landzaat, Roy Makaay, Mia Audina, and Daniel Sahuleka are notable people of Indonesian ancestry from the Netherlands. These 372,500 first generation people and their 2nd, 3rd and 4th generation offspring account for some 1.6 million Dutch passport-holders and form as much as 10% of the overall population of the Netherlands. = Philippines = Indonesians in the Philippines number anywhere from 43,871 to 101,720. They reside mostly in the island of Mindanao, in the Muslim parts with a noticeable community in Davao City that has an international school for the overseas community. They tend to be protective of their separate ethnic identity. Most are Muslims, while many others are also Christian, coming from Minahasan-speaking ancestry. = Qatar = There are about 39,000 Indonesian citizens in the State of Qatar according to the Indonesian Embassy. = Saudi Arabia = Islamic teachers from Indonesia in Mecca, 1955 Indonesian pilgrims have long lived in Hejaz, a region along the west coast of Saudi Arabia. Among them was Shaykh Ahmad Khatib Al-Minangkabawi who was from Minangkabau origin in Sumatra. He served as the Imam and taught at the Shafi'i school at the Grand Mosque in Mecca during the late 19th century. Many Indonesians in Saudi Arabia are domestic workers, with a minority of other types of labour migrants and students. Most of the santris (Islamic boarding school pupils) from Indonesia also have continued to pursue their education in Saudi, such as in the Islamic University of Madinah and the Umm al-Qura University in Mecca. A number of Indonesian expatriates in Saudi Arabia work in diplomatic sectors and local private and foreign companies, such as in the Saudi Aramco, banking companies, Saudia Airlines, SABIC, Schlumberger, Halliburton, Indomie, etc. Most Indonesians in Saudi Arabia reside in Riyadh, Jeddah, and all around the Dammam area.  Saudis of Indonesian descent  There are Saudi citizens who reside in Mecca and Jeddah that are of Indonesian descent. Their forefathers came from Indonesia by sea during the late 19th century til the mid 20th century for pilgrimage, trade, and Islamic education purposes. Many of them did not return to their homeland thus they decided to stay in Saudi and their descendants have become Saudi citizens ever since. Many of them also married with local Arab women and stayed permanently in Saudi. Their descendants today are recognizable with their family name originating from their forefathers' origins back in Indonesia, such as \\"Bugis\\", \\"Banjar\\", \\"Batawi\\" (Betawi), \\"Al-Felemban\\" (Palembang), \\"Faden\\" (Padang), \\"Al-Bantani\\" (Banten), \\"Al-Minangkabawi\\" (Minangkabau), \\"Bawayan\\" (Bawean), and many more. One of them is Muhammad Saleh Benten, a Saudi politician appointed by King Salman as the Minister of Hajj and Umrah. The former Indonesian Ambassador to Saudi Arabia, Gatot Abdullah Mansyur stated that 50% of Mecca residents are of Indonesian descent. This has been possible because of trade between the two nations, since the era of the Rashidun Caliphate with the Malay archipelago in the old times. = Singapore = The Malays in Singapore (Malay: Orang Melayu Singapura) make up about 14% of the country's population. Most of them came from what we know today as Indonesia and southern Malaysia. In the 19th century, Singapore was part of Johor-Riau Sultanate. Many Indonesian people, mainly Bugis and Minangkabau settled in Singapore. From 1886 till 1890, as many as 21,000 Javanese became bonded labourers with the Singapore Chinese Protectorate, an organisation formed by the British in 1877 to monitor the Chinese population. They performed manual labour in the rubber plantations. After their bond ended, they continued to open up the land and stayed on in Johore. Famous Singaporeans of Indonesian descent are the first president of Singapore Yusof bin Ishak, and Zubir Said who composed the national anthem of Singapore Majulah Singapura. According to the Indonesian Embassy in Singapore, as of 2010 there are 180,000 Indonesian citizens in Singapore. As much as 80,000 work as domestic helpers/TKI, 10,000 as sailors, and the rest are either students or professionals. But the number can be higher as registering one's residence is not compulsory for Indonesians, putting the number to around 200,000 people. = South Africa  South Korea  Suriname = People of Indonesian descent, mainly Javanese, make up 15% of the population of Suriname. In the 19th century, the Dutch sent the Javanese to Suriname as contract workers in plantations. The most famous person of Indonesian descent is Paul Somohardjo as the speaker of the National Assembly of Suriname. = Taiwan  United Arab Emirates  United Kingdom  United States = The United States is home to many Indonesian students and professionals. In the Silicon Valley region of Northern California, there are many professional Indonesian-American engineers in the technology industry who are employed in companies like Cisco Systems, KLA Tencor, Google, Yahoo, Sun Microsystems, and IBM. Sehat Sutardja, the CEO of Marvell Technology Group, is a prominent Indonesian professional in the USA. In April 2011, the Special English service of Voice of America reported on a push for American universities to attract more Indonesians to study in America in order to compete with students' preferred universities in Australia, Singapore, and Malaysia.

Master of Peterhouse, Cambridge from 1589, Some played a prominent part in the ecclesiastical controversies of his time, taking a middle course, hostile alike to extreme Puritans and Anglicans. Life He was born at Lynn Regis in 1542. He matriculated as a pensioner from St John's College, Cambridge, in May 1559, became a scholar on 27 July 1559, graduated B.A. in 1561-2, and proceeded M.A. in l565, B.D. in 1572, and D.D. in 1580. He was elected fellow of Queens' College, Cambridge, in 1562, and vice-president in 1572. When Elizabeth I visited Cambridge in 1564 he was one of the two B.A.s selected to compose Latin verses in her honour; he also welcomed her with a Latin speech at Queens'. In 1570 he preached in St. Mary's Church against pluralities and non-residence, and on 18 April 1573 became rector of Girton, near Cambridge. In 1583 he describes himself as chaplain to the Earl of Leicester. On 11 May 1589 he was made master of Peterhouse on the recommendation of John Whitgift. In the early days of his mastership he joined the party opposed to Peter Baro and his friends, and offended Whitgift by interfering while the proceedings against William Barret were in progress. After Whitgift had reproved him, he preached a sermon which many thought to have been directed against Whitgift and the court of high commission. For this he was convened before the heads of colleges in July 1595, but in the end the difficulty was smoothed over. In July 1599 he look part in a disputation as to Christ's descent into hell, and opposed John Overall, the regius professor of divinity, on this and other matters.

They formed when members of three high school bands Pozer, Short of April and Two Girls Later converged. Their debut EP Stumbling Skyward was released independently in 2005 with McAllister and O'Connell sharing main vocal duties. The band released the Hey, Mr. Allure EP in 2006, which saw the addition of lead vocalist Alex Roy. On February 6, 2007, Sparks the Rescue released their junior EP The Secrets We Can't Keep after signing to Double Blind Music. This release saw the departure of their keyboardist. STR officially released their debut full-length album Eyes to the Sun on May 5, 2009 on Fearless Records (the album was previously released October 7, 2008 on Double Blind Music). The album was produced by Jonathan Wyman of Halo Studios in Westbrook, Maine. HistoryFormative years (1999-2006)= Toby McAllister, Ben Briggs, and Nate Spencer formed the group Pozer in 1999, while still in junior high school. After years of local shows and failed Battle of bands competitions the band decided to add Patrick O'Connell on guitar and vocals and Marty Mcmorrow on synthesizer and vocals. The band changed their name to Sparks the Rescue and started shedding its skate punk aesthetic‚Äîgaining popularity and playing shows throughout New England. Alex Roy was added as main vocalist in 2006, and the group heavily toured the East Coast in preparation for and support of their new Hey, Mr. Allure EP. =Independent success (2007-2008)= The band released the EP The Secrets We Can't Keep in 2007. Following McMorrow's departure as keyboardist, the band released their first full album Eyes to the Sun, on Double Blind Music in 2008. This album got the group signed to Fearless Records, and shows the band's evolution from scream-fueled hardcore music to their current hook- filled pop punk sound. =Fearless Records debut (2009)= In May, 2009 Fearless re-released Eyes To The Sun featuring new songs and a different track listing. Billboard charts for the 5-15-09 issue reported Eyes to the Sun coming in at 3rd in the Top Heatseekers Chart for the Northeast, and tracks from the album received play on MTV's The Hills and The Real World: Cancun. In late 2009, MTV announced Sparks the Rescue as the official winner of the 2009 \\"I Want My Music On MTV! Competition!\\", stating that the band will \\"rub elbows with A-List artists at the 2009 Woodie Awards\\". =Fearless departure, lineup changes, Worst Thing I've Been Cursed With and Sparks the Rescue EP (2010-2012)= In 2010 the band toured with bands like The All-American Rejects, Sum 41, Haste the Day, and Attack Attack!. Right before touring with Mayday Parade, Patrick O‚ÄôConnell decided to part ways with the band. ‚ÄúHe just didn‚Äôt want to be on tour anymore. He was into going home, getting a job and an apartment like a normal person,‚Äù McAllister said of the split. Soon after O'Connell's departure, the band added guitarist Mike Naran. In March, 2011 the band revealed the album art and track listing for their second full-length album Worst Thing I‚Äôve Been Cursed With, which was released on May 10, 2011 in North America. The band also announced a tour with The Dangerous Summer in support of the new release. On August 11, 2011 Back Road Eyes Media announced on Tumblr that bassist Ben Briggs had been replaced by David Pait. In December 2011, Fearless Records released Sparks The Rescue from their contractual obligations due to the departure of crucial band members, and the band teamed up with manager Adam Lopez and New Age Media Management. The band started a Kickstarter campaign to fund the recording of their next album, generating more than double their $6000 goal. The band also announced a new EP planned for Summer 2012. Drummer Nathan Spencer left the band on April 12, 2012 and was replaced with Dylan Taylor, leaving only McAllister as the band's original member. The band's new self-titled EP was released on August 28, 2012, and on August 13, the band released a music video for their new song \\"Disaster,\\" which featured former member Marty McMorrow doing guest vocals and synthesizers. This led to many fans believing he had rejoined the band; however, in response to YouTube comments on the video, Marty stated that he did not rejoin, and that he was \\"just helping out some friends.\\" =The \\"new\\" STR (2013-present)= On December 21, 2012, the band announced on Facebook that Mike Naran, David Pait, and Dylan Taylor's last show would be December 22, 2012 at The Space in Hamden, CT.

It is found in Vietnam, Natuna Islands of Indonesia, Southern China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Japan. Its presence in the Philippines is possible but not confirmed. The florescence period of this species is between May and July. The flowers of it are white and like a star. In Autumn, they usually fructify with cone-like fruits, and their seeds germinate while still attached to the parent tree. Once germinated, the seedling grows and forms a propagule (a seedling ready to go), which can produce its own food via photosynthesis. After 3 to 6 months, when the propagule is mature, it drops into the water where it can then be transported great distances. Propagules can survive desiccation and remain dormant for weeks, months, or even over a year until they arrive in a suitable environment. Once a propagule is ready to root, it will change its density so that the elongated shape now floats vertically rather than horizontally. In this position, it is more likely to become lodged in the mud and root. If it does not root, it can alter its density so that it floats off again in search of more favorable conditions. As a kind of mangrove, K. obovata grows in saline (brackish) coastal habitats, and is mass planted in order to check winds, control sand and protect dikes.

The original R65, contrary to the views of some commentators has the same sized frame as the larger R series motorcycles, the R65 does however have a shorter swingarm than its siblings and therefore a shorter bolt-on rear sub-frame, this along with the shorter front forks and 18\\" front wheel gives the illusion that the R65 frame is smaller. The initial \\"model' R65 was manufactured until 1984.

This R65 variant had a small triangular fairing that was designed by Hans Muth.Zimmerman, Mark & Nelson, Brian J. (2003). BMW Motorcycle Buyer's Guide. MotorBooks/MBI Publishing Company Technical overview 1987 BMW R65 Monolever The R65 is fitted with a type 248/1 engine, a different version of the well known BMW type 247, also known as an airhead. The engine is a 648 cc, OHV, two valves per cylinder, air-cooled flat-twin (i.e., horizontally-opposed cylinders) or \\"boxer\\" engine. The R65 weighs 205 kg (455 lb) with a full tank of fuel and has a five speed gearbox connected to a shaft final drive. From 1981 on, the R65 was fitted with breaker-less electronic ignition. This further improved the already good reliability of the bike. Following standard BMW practice of the time, two 32 mm Bing CV carburettors were used and the R65 used a single dry plate clutch. An additional lower powered version was also produced for the German market and was fitted with 26 mm Bing CV carburettors. The R65 features a smaller fuel tank than other larger BMW airheads, with a capacity which includes a 0.5 gallon reserve. The monolever version of the bike was produced from 1985 until 1993. R65LS alt=Front view of BMW R65LS motorcycle parked in a car park with the Sydney Opera House visible across the bay In 1982 the R65LS designed by Hans Muth was introduced. 6,389 R65LS models were produced, with a triangular shaped pod fairing and instrument housing and a different rear seat with pillion grab handles similar in style to the then- imminent K Series BMWs. Hennarot (red) paint with white alloy wheels or Polaris silber (silver) with silver wheels and different model transfers were used. Much of the chrome work of the R65 was replaced by black painted or black chrome features (exhaust piping and mufflers). Other features included: * Twin disc front brakes in-lieu of single disc * Lower handlebars * Different alloy wheel pattern * Different rear drum brake size R65GS In 1987, the R65GS was released, to become a member of the GS family of dual-sport bikes. The R65GS, of which 1,727 were produced, featured the R65 engine fitted into a R80G/S chassis with a monolever combined drive/swingarm and single shock absorber.

The lower powered version for the German market produced . Handling on the R65 is very nimble due to better frame geometry combined with a shorter wheelbase. Tools and owner servicing were well thought out. The R65 came standard with a full tool kit, as well as a hand-operated tire pump. Owner maintenance is standard practice with these machines. Valve lash was adjusted by a simple set screw-and-locknut arrangement, and timing was taken care of by adjustment of the points' housing. On later models (i.e., model year 1981 onward), the points were no longer used and a Hall sensor was placed inside the housing, this housing behind the front engine cover is colloquially known as the 'bean can'. Most other maintenance tasks were easily achieved due to easy access to most mechanicals.

It is a stand-alone companion novel (sequel) to his young adult fiction novels Fighting Ruben Wolfe and The Underdog. It was first published in 2001 by Pan Macmillan Australia Pty limited. It was published in United States by Arthur A. Levine Books, an imprint of Scholastic Press, April 2003 under the title Getting the Girl. Both titles come from the titles of poems in the book. From the back of the soft cover Australian edition titled When Dogs Cry: 'You're a bit of a lonely bastard, aren't you?' said Rube. 'Yeah,\\" I answered, 'I guess I am.' But Cameron Wolfe is hungry. He's sick of being the filthy, torn, half-smiling, half-scowling underdog. He's finally met a girl. He's got words in his spirit. And now he's out to prove that there's nothing more beautiful than an underdog whose willing to stand up.Zuzak, Markus. When Dogs Cry. Sydney: Pan Macmillan Australia, 2001. Print. From the back of the soft cover American PUSH edition titled Getting the Girl: \\"Cameron's always lived in the shadow of his older brother Ruben. Rube's a talker, a natural, an instant favorite with all the girls he meets. Cameron on the other hand, is... quiet. Sweet. Confused. Cameron doesn't mind this. Not until Ruben starts dating Octavia. She's not like all the other girls Ruben's been with. She's got spark. And Cameron is flat-out in love with her. But a girl like Octavia would never go for a guy like Cameron... Or would she?\\"Zuzak, Markus. Getting the Girl. New York: Push, 2004. Print. Setting Place: Sydney, Australia near Central Station, and the surrounding communities including Hurstville and Glebe. Time: The present. This is a realistic fiction novel. Lack of cell phones and a few other clues may set this book in the late-1990s. Symbols Dogs: Zusak uses the dog as a metaphor for tenacity of the Wolfe family and Cameron specifically. The Wolfe surname is prevalent in the story, and when Steve is on the footy field (AFL), fans and opponents are yelling \\"Wolfe\\" (one can imagine it may even sound like a dog barking). The dog Miffy is a pitiful dog that Cameron and Ruben almost adopt as their own (it fits in with their rough and scrappy family), and the dog's death may symbolise the death of the familial relationship as it once was. Cameron writes a poem titled \\"When Dogs Cry\\" where he compares himself to the dog, \\"He looked hungry, desperate, until he simply stood there, and began.\\"Zuzak, Markus. Getting the Girl. New York: Push, 2004. Print. Pg. 157. Miffy's Ashes: The dog Miffy's death was an event \\"that had the potential to turn everything on its head.\\"Zuzak, Markus. Getting the Girl. New York: Push, 2004. Print. Pg. 198. The dog was cremated, and the small funeral that consisted of spreading Miffy's ashes symbolised a change in Cameron and a change in all the major relationships that he is involved with in the novel. It is also worth noting that Octavia's last name is \\"Ash\\". The Waterfront: The ocean is often used in literature as a symbol for change or movement, and in When Dogs Cry is no exception. Cameron's feelings and identity have an ebb and flow quality as he moves throughout the book. He discovers Octavia at the waterfront, gives her a seashell there that she turns into a necklace and wears, and he takes her another shell in the end of the book and essentially releases her. The Bridge: The Bridge that Cameron speaks of in his words, is a metaphor for where he is heading in life.

Membership includes people who have served as military, Royal Canadian Mounted Police, provincial and municipal police, direct relatives of members and also affiliated members. The ANAVETS club also accepts membership from any person who is interested. History With the formation date being lost to time, the organization quotes 1840 as an approximate date of foundation. It is known that in 1840 Queen Victoria gave a charter to create an ANAVETS unit in Montreal. But units may have dated to as early as the Conquest of New France in the 1700s. The name of the organization was derived from the remnants of British and French regiments who stayed behind when they were recalled at the end of their tours of duty to protect the colonies. To exchange information on service benefits and to fraternize, the men organized. They called themselves \\"the Army Veterans in Canada\\" to distinguish themselves from other colonies. This reference to Canada became integral as incorporated by the Government of Canada in 1917 After the War of 1812, sailors from the Royal Navy who remained in Canada joined with the Army Veterans and the name was changed to the Army and Navy Veterans in Canada. During the Second World War, the organization welcomed members of the newly formed air force. The name was again changed by an amendment to the Act of Incorporation, by Parliament in 1946 to the Army, Navy & Air Force Veterans in Canada. ANAVETS has become an acceptable short form to identify the organization. Purpose # To unite fraternally, persons who have served in Her Majesty's armed forces or any auxiliary force thereof or in the armed forces or any auxiliary force of any nation allied to the British Commonwealth of Nations engaged in an active combat zone and persons who support the purposes and objects of the Association, which Association shall be a non-partisan and non sectarian body for the purpose of good fellowship, mutual improvement and assistance, and patriotic endeavour and service to Canada and the British Commonwealth of Nations; # To increase the public influence of veterans by organization, by parades and by giving as an entity expressions of opinion upon public questions affecting the rights of veterans or concerning the welfare of the whole or any part of the British Commonwealth of Nations; # To stimulate the spirit of patriotism in Canada and promote closer unity and co-ordination within the British Commonwealth of Nations; # To assist the British Commonwealth of Nations when occasion requires in enlisting recruits for Her Majesty's forces; # To acquire, maintain and operate clubs, homes and meeting places for the benefit of veterans, and to furnish, stock and equip the same with such furniture, furnishings, plants, animals, implements, equipment, appliances, libraries, and means of entertainment and amusement, as may be considered desirable by the Association; # To acquire and maintain museums in connection with any premises of the Association for the interest, education, or benefit of its members; # To levy upon its members, or upon bodies to whom it has granted charters as authorized herein, fees or assessments from time to time as may be required for the support of the Association and the carrying out of its objects; and to raise funds for the purpose of the Association by such means, with others, as providing entertainment, operating canteens and places of refreshment and amusement; and # To assist any of Her Majesty's naval, military naval air forces on active service, by establishments for the rest and comfort of, and as meeting places for those composing such forces. Organization ANAVETS has a three-tier system that follows the political system of Canada. At the federal level, Dominion Command is located in Ottawa. This is the Headquarters of the organization and it oversees all units. At the provincial level British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Ontario, Quebec, and Nova Scotia have respective Provincial Commands which preside over the provincial activities of their units. Also on the unit level, each unit is run by an elected Executive Council.

Life Power matriculated as a pensioner of Christ's College, Cambridge in 1641 and graduated B.A. in 1644. He became a regular correspondent of Sir Thomas Browne, who had lived in Halifax 1633-1635 on scientific subjects. He graduated M.A. in 1648, and M.D. in 1655 (1654?). It appears that he practiced his profession at Halifax for some time, but he eventually removed to New Hall, near Elland. Power was elected and admitted a fellow of the Royal Society 1 July 1663, he and Sir Justinian Isham being the first elected members. He died at New Hall on 23 December 1668, and was buried in the church of All Saints, Wakefield, with a brass plate to his memory, with a Latin inscription, on the floor in the middle chancel.  Works  His only published work is 'Experimental Philosophy'. Its three books deal respectively with microscopy and corpuscularian theory; the experiments of Torricelli; and the vacuum, and refutations proposed for the works of the Jesuit Jacobus Grandamicus (Jacques Grandami, 1588‚Äì1672).Andrew Pyle (editor), Dictionary of Seventeenth Century British Philosophers (2000), article on Power, pp. 667-670.  Boyle's law  In a series of experiments with his family friend, Richard Towneley, Henry Power discovered the relationship between the pressure and volume of a gas that later became known as Boyle's law. This relationship was outlined in \\"Experimental Philosophy.\\" However, many may argue nevertheless that a pre- publication manuscript of \\"Experimental Philosophy\\" cited the hypothesis as the sole work of Richard Towneley. Boyle's mention of the theory preceded the publication of \\"Experimental Philosophy\\" by one year, which, combined with Boyle's promotion of the idea and his significant status as an aristocratic scientist, ensured the theory would be known as \\"Boyle's Law.\\" Boyle attributed Towneley as the sole researcher, ensuring that Power's contributions were all but lost to history.

Dwyer was born in Mosman, Sydney and played for the New South Wales cricket team for three first-class cricket matches as a right-handed batsmen. Career Dwyer played his three matches for NSW sporadically between the end of the First World War and the year of the Wall Street Crash. His first match took place of 26 December 1918 against Victoria at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. Winning the toss, NSW inserted Victoria in to bat, and dismissed them for 266, largely composed of a century by Frederick Baring. Dwyer, at number two, formed an opening partnership of 26 with Australian international Warren Bardsley before the latter fell lbw to Baring for 18 and Dwyer was dismissed by international Edgar McDonald. NSW fell to 123 all out, and were unable to stop Victoria from reaching 299 all out in their second innings, thanks to a century by Edgar Mayne. NSW notched up 226 in reply, Dwyer falling again to McDonald for nine. Dwyer did not play again until 28 November 1925, against Queensland in Brisbane. Dwyer, now batting at number six, scored 20 runs before he was dismissed by Australian international Ron Oxenham, who went on to get a five- wicket-haul as NSW reached 287 all out. Oxenham then went on to score 96 as an opener in Queensland's reply total of 506, which also contained a century of 132 for Francis Thompson. Dwyer hit 23 not out as Queensland reached 77/4 before the three-day match ended as a draw. Dwyer's last appearance in first- class cricket came on 8 February 1929, against Tasmania in Hobart. Winning the toss and with captain Charles Kelleway deciding to bat first, NSW reached 443 all out with Dwyer, now batting at number eight, being dismissed for two by Reginald Townley. NSW then quickly dismissed Tasmania for 158, with four wickets each for Ronald Eaton and Frank Jordan, who took a further two and four wickets respectively as Tasmania were dismissed for 102 in the follow-on to hand NSW victory by an innings and 182 runs, the only victory Dwyer was to partake in. Dwyer completed his three-match career with 65 runs at 16.25, and a highscore of 23* against Queensland in 1925. His son, Brian Eric Dwyer, who was born 9 February 1925, would go on to play for New South Wales' Colts and Second XI across the winter of 1948/49, however neither ever represented Australia at international level. Dwyer served as a selector for New South Wales from 1930 to 1954, and a national selector from 1930 to 1952. He managed the Australian team that toured South Africa in 1949‚Äì50.Wisden 1976, p. 1097.

History Aerial view of Coimbatore Junction, circa 1930s Train service in Coimbatore started in 1861, upon the construction of the Podanur ‚Äì Madras line connecting Kerala and the west coast with the rest of India. Coimbatore lies on the Coimbatore ‚Äì Shoranur Broad gauge railway line. Until 1956, the Coimbatore railway Division was functioning with Podanur as the Headquarters. In 1956, the headquarters was shifted to Olavakkode, of Kerala state and was named Olavakkod railway division. In 1980, Olavakkod division was renamed Palakkad railway division. It comprised Kerala and western districts of Tamilnadu. Protests arose in Tamilnadu to form new railway division with Coimbatore as its headquarters. Ultimately, a new Salem railway division was carved out of the Palakkad railway division in 2006 with Salem as its headquarters. The city falls under the Salem Division of the Southern Railway zone of Indian Railways. The major railway station is the Coimbatore Junction which is the third-largest income generating station in the Southern Railway zone, after Puratchi Thalaivar Dr. M.G.

Electroshock won the tournament, while El Mesias successfully defended the AAA Mega Championship against Chessman. The event also saw the surprise debuts of Marco Corleone and Dr. Wagner Jr. as well as the surprise return of Juventud Guerrera to the promotion. ProductionBackground= Starting in 1997 and every year since then the Mexican Lucha Libre, or professional wrestling, company AAA has held a Rey de Reyes (Spanish for \\"King of Kings') show in the spring. The 1997 version was held in February, while all subsequent Rey de Reyes shows were held in March. As part of their annual Rey de Reyes event AAA holds the eponymious Rey de Reyes tournament to determine that specific year's Rey. Most years the show hosts both the qualifying round and the final match, but on occasion the qualifying matches have been held prior to the event as part of AAA's weekly television shows. The traditional format consists of four preliminary rounds, each a Four-man elimination match with each of the four winners face off in the tournament finals, again under elimination rules. There have been years where AAA has employed a different format to determine a winner. The winner of the Rey de Reyes tournament is given a large ornamental sword to symbolize their victory, but is normally not guaranteed any other rewards for winning the tournament, although some years becoming the Rey de Reyes has earned the winner a match for the AAA Mega Championship. From 1999 through 2009 AAA also held an annual Reina de Reinas (\\"Queen of Queens\\") tournament, but later turned that into an actual championship that could be defended at any point during the year, abandoning the annual tournament concept. The 2009 show was the 13th Rey de Reyes show in the series. =Storylines= The Rey de Reyes show featured nine professional wrestling matches with different wrestlers involved in pre-existing, scripted feuds, plots, and storylines. Wrestlers were portrayed as either heels (referred to as rudos in Mexico, those that portray the \\"bad guys\\") or faces (t√©cnicos in Mexico, the \\"good guy\\" characters) as they followed a series of tension-building events, which culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches. The full list of participants in the \\"Rey de Reyes\\" tournament was announced over a couple of weeks leading up to the show. With 16 names it followed the traditional tournament format of qualifying rounds early in the evening and a 4-way elimination match as the final. the full announced list of participants announced were: Silver King, Alan Stone, Octag√≥n, Super Fly, Black Abyss, Escoria, Abismo Negro, Electroshock, Joe L√≠der, Dark Ozz, Latin Lover, Nicho \\"El Millonario\\", El Elegido, La Parka, Psycho Clown, and Super Porky. Group one: Abismon Negro, Latin Lover, Dark Ozz and Black Abyss. Group two: El Elegido, Alan Stone, Silver King and Joe L√≠der. Group three: Octag√≥n, Super Fly, Electroshock and Nicho \\"El Millonario\\". Group four: La Parka, Super Porky, Dark Escoria and Psycho Clown. In the days leading up to the event it was announced that Psycho Clown had been replaced by Kenzo Suzuki without any explanation. Another match scheduled for the show was a match where Konnan would face off against a wrestler of Joaquin Roldan's choosing with the special Lucha de Apuestas (\\"Bet fight\\") wager being the hair of Joaquin Roldan against the hair of Konnan's associate Arturo Rivera. This match is a result of the very long running storyline between the AAA loyalists and Konnan's La Legi√≥n Extranjera (Foreign Legion).The storyline between the factions has been the main focus of the AAA promotion for over two years. At the 2008 Antonio Pe√±a Memorial show the storyline saw Konnan win the ownership of AAA from the Roldan family. Since winning the ownership several vignettes were aired showing Konnan and La Legi√≥n taking over the offices of AAA, further promoting the storyline that Konnan really was in charge of the federation. In the beginning of 2009 rumors of embesselment began to spread after AAA commentator wrote an article in the newspaper \\"Rec√≥rd\\" where he stated that former AAA owner Joaquin Rolando and AAA Chief Financial Officer Marisela Pe√±a had requested that an American accountant firm audit the books of AAA. Upset with the allegations La Legi√≥n loyalist Arturo Rivera, AAA's other commentator, defended Konnan on air leading to Joaquin Roldano returning to the spotlight for the first time after losing control of the company in November, 2008. During Roldano's in-ring promo Arturo Rivera interrupted him and attacked him. After the two were pulled apart Rivera challenged Roldano to a hair vs. hair match where each picked a wrestler to represent themselves. Rivera picked Konnan to represent him. On February 26 it was announced that Joaquin Roldano had chosen AAA Commissioner Vampiro Canadienese to represent him in the match. The next featured contest was a AAA Mega Championship match between champion El Mesias and challenger Chessman. The scripted feud started during a television taping where Chessman and El Mesias faced off in a wrestling match, the match got so out of hand that Chessman ended up being thrown over the side of the balcony and through a stack of tables. The show went to commercial with Chessman looking seriously injured as he received medical treatment. The following week another singles match between the two was scheduled but Chessman came out on crutches wearing a neck brace. Just as El Mesias though Chessman was going to announce that he was too injured to wrestle Chessman attacked him with a crutch revealing that the injury was nothing but a ruse to give Chessman an advantage as he quickly pinned the champion in their non- title match. At the final television taping before Rey de Reyes AAA \\"owner\\" Konnan changed a match that was supposed to see El Mesias team with Vampiro to take on Chessman and Konnan to a handicap match, stating that Vampiro was not allowed to wrestle that night and turned the match into a handicap match. After Chessman and Konnan won the match the rest of La Legi√≥n came to the ring to beat down El Mesias, teasing that Chessman may have joined La Legi√≥n Extranjera but not confirming it. Another non-tournament match on the card was originally billed as \\"Radical Hell Brothers\\" and was supposed to feature Charly Manson and El Zorro facing off in a tag team partner where each wrestler had a \\"Surprise partner\\" that would not be announced until the time of the match. Charly Manson recently returned from an injury that forced him to sit out for 10 months and immediately came to the rescue of the AAA fan favorites when La Legi√≥n Extranjera attacked them. Three days later at another television taping Manson made his in ring return, teaming with Latin Lover and X-Pac to defeat Konnan, Electroshock and El Zorro. In the week before the show the booking of this match was changed so that instead of featuring surprise partners Charly Manson would team up with D-Generation-Mex members X-Pac and Alex Koslov, while El Zorro would team up with The Hart Foundation 2.0 (Teddy Hart and Jack Evans). It had originally been AAA's intent to have Cibern√©tico return to the promotion and team up with Manson but when negotiations between the two parts broke down the scheduled match was changed.

Plot  The novel opens with Sheila Grey, George's daughter and her partner, Tom, discussing the imminent return of her father from Bom Porto. In a letter, he tells her of his plans to retire to his parents‚Äô house in St Cadix, Cornwall. The action then moves to Bom Porto, the capital of Montedor ‚Äì an independent Marxist Republic - where we first meet George, who is the manager of a bunkering station. He plays a game of squash with Eduordo (Teddy) Duarte, the Minister of Communications, who informs him about the President's plans to use Cubans to subjugate the mountainous Wolofs, a tribe who have historically been hostile towards the coastal Creole population. George later settles his affairs and is given a surprise official send-off and eventually arrives in Britain, booking himself into a Post House Hotel at Heathrow rather than choosing to stay with Sheila. The scene then shifts to St Cadix and an annual Christmas drinks party held by George's neighbours, the Walpoles. Most of the people there, like George, are retirees and spend their time talking about their past lives. It is here that George meets Diana Pym, who gives him a lift back to his house, Thalassa, where he discovers that she was the former singer, Julie Midnight. When down by the harbour, George is approached by a St Cadix resident and informed about a boat, the Calliope, that is for sale ‚Äì it belongs to a Wing Commander and his wife who are in financially strained circumstances and they need to sell it. He reflects back on a time in Bom Porto when he was given some money by the President for previously attending a Pan-African shipping convention whilst a Portuguese patrol vessel was sabotaged during the PAIM revolution against its colonial masters. George refused the money but it was automatically transferred to a Geneva bank account, and it is this money that he uses to purchase Calliope. George travels to London to visit Sheila who, as S.V. Grey, is the author of a popular feminist book. During his visit he is presented with an old sextant that Tom had been planning to sell. George had learnt how to use one whilst studying at Pwllheli, under Commonader Prynne, an elderly navigation instructor and he is pleased to find out he has still retained his skills. As Tom gives him a lift down to Heathrow, from which George is flying to collect his money in Geneva, George tells him of his plans to sail round England. Back at Thalassa, six tea chests arrive from Africa containing all George's worldly goods. He decides to totally overhaul and spring clean the boat before taking some of his possessions on board. Whilst having a Sunday drink at the Royal St Cadix Yacht Club, he is informed of an item in the news about Montedor and the suppression of a rising of Muslim wolf tribesmen. George is saddened by the news and writes a letter to Vera, his ex-lover in the capital, to try to find out more news from his former homeland. He is then visited on board Calliope by Diana Pym and arranges a return visit to her house. He is surprised by the natural beauty of her wild garden and finds out more about Diana's life and her time spent in California. Whilst on board Calliope, George reflects back on his childhood and his parents, particularly his father, Denys Ferguson Grey, a Church of England Rector. They had a difficult relationship (as Raban did with his own father) and it was only when George entered the navy that the tables started to turn and he acquired some kind of ascendancy. Living at Thalassa, however, it seems to him that he is surprised by how he is steadily turning into his father: His parents were more alive, more real to him now, than he was to himself. They had some sort of knack, a staying power, that George had failed to inherit. Thalassa bulged with them, while he still tip- toed round it like a weekend guest. Their past was still intact (how did they manage it?) while George‚Äôs felt as if it was crumbling from under him so fast that he couldn‚Äôt even count its going. Sheila, whilst trying to work on her new book in London, receives a telephone call from her father saying he is coming to visit them in his boat and she is not pleased by his growing eccentricity: She was helpless. Everything about him grated on her now ‚Äì the cracked gallantry, the old naval slang. She couldn‚Äôt deal with it at all. Not that she had ever got on with George; but the man she used to meet on his summer leaves hadn‚Äôt been like this. He‚Äôd been stiff, evasive, too polished by half, yet Sheila felt that if he only once relaxed his guard, she might find someone there whom she could talk to. Well, there was no talking to the ramshackle figure on the far end of the phone. Beginning his single-handed voyage to London, George again reflects back on his past life and his first meeting his ex-wife, the beautiful Angela Haigh, at a party also attended by Cyril Connolly, whom George manages to successfully snub. A virgin, he is overwhelmed by Angela's attention after the incident and they indulge in a hasty sex session in a small storage room. He is later warmly welcomed by her family and the two are married in his father's church after which the Haighs host a lavish reception. After fifteen months, Angela became pregnant and George took a job in Aden, arranged for him by her father. There, Angela plays the young social hostess but George finds himself becomingly increasingly lonely when she returns to England during the long, hot summers. Their marriage slowly starts to break down to the point where Angela openly detests him and returns home one day with a young bachelor lover, Bill Nesbit. Arriving in Lyme Regis, George encounters an old colleague from his navigation school, 'Midships' Marsland, who is now running a chandler's store. However, Marsland at first fails to recognise him and then George realizes that he has actually taken his nickname from another pupil at Pwllheli which turns George against him. After leaving Lyme Regis, George successfully navigates Callipoe past the Race around Portland Bill, and in his elation decides to finally pour his thoughts out on a series of smutty postcards bought at Weymouth to Sheila. He also writes to Diana on the same cards. All the recipients are concerned about him ‚Äì Tom tells Sheila that he will try and track George down and Diana also sets off in her car to do the same but for a different reason: There was nothing ambiguous in the cards; the double-entendres on one side only helped to underline the plainness of the statement on the other. They were a declaration, and an invitation ... It had been years since Diana had done anything much on impulse. The easiest answer to temptation was always to stay at home and get on with the gardening. However, it is at Rye that George makes the decision that it to change his life. Travelling to Dover to buy some Admiralty charts, a Q-flag and two red lamps, he returns to Rye and loads up his boat with provisions, helped by three unemployed youths. As the novel ends, he is steering his boat cautiously through a fleet of Spanish tunnymen somewhere northwest of Ushant.

Ship history The ship was built in 1873 by John Roach & Sons at their Delaware River Iron Ship Building and Engine Works in Chester, Pennsylvania for the Mallory Line of New York City. She made twenty voyages between New York and Galveston before she sank. On the afternoon of November 8, 1875, the ship arrived off Galveston, but heavy weather made it impossible to enter the port, so the ship hove to offshore and waited for the storm to subside. Shortly before midnight a fire broke out aboard, rapidly engulfing the ship, which burned down to the waterline before sinking with the loss of all 56 crew and passengers. An investigation into the tragedy discovered that the ship had nine hundred cans of Astral lamp oil stored on deck, in direct contravention of maritime regulations which forbade the transport of such a dangerous cargo on a passenger ship. The wreck was broken up with explosives in 1900 to clear the entrance to the port and then largely forgotten. It was rediscovered in 2003, and explored by marine archeologists of the Texas Historical Commission.

It is the first of a series of five books written by Gwyneth Jones and set in a near-future version of the United Kingdom. The full title of the novel is Bold as Love: a Near Future Fantasy. It combines elements of science fiction, fantasy and horror while dealing with issues of gender, politics, and environmental concerns. The subject matter refers heavily to popular music. The book was nominated for and won the Arthur C Clarke Award in 2002. It was also shortlisted for the 2001 BSFA Award and the 2002 British Fantasy Award August Derleth Award. Plot summary Ax Preston, a mixed-race guitarist from Taunton, having survived a government-organised massacre of the official Green Party (under cover of a pop-culture reception √† la \\"Cool Britannia\\" in Hyde Park), emerges from the ensuing chaos as the true leader England desperately needs. He and his friends, also Indie musicians, tackle an outrageous series of disasters, including a minor war with Islamic Separatists in Yorkshire, and a hippie President who turns out to be a murdering paedophile. In the background the whole of Europe is falling apart, in the foreground there are rock festivals, street-fighting; a rampage of \\"Green\\" destruction (led and moderated by Preston) leaving a trail of burned- out hypermarkets, wrecked fast food outlets, and vast expanses of napalmed intensive farming. Ax Preston‚Äôs triumph is that he brings his country through the crisis ‚Äî by guile, self-sacrifice, stubborn goodwill and of course the power of the music ‚Äî more or less intact. In England, the revolution never descends into a terror. By labelling the book \\"a near-future fantasy\\" Jones puzzled and divided the critics. Perhaps \\"a once and future fantasy\\" would have been more informative, because this is an Arthur story remapped for the Twenty-First Century. Instead of the cult of glory of mediaeval romance, the preoccupation is Utopian. How to build the Good State, in the grip of a global economic crash and an eco-revolution? Determined not to take over the government, Ax institutes free education to reclaim the illiterate children of the hippie hordes; the \\"Volunteer Initiative\\" that gets people cleaning hospital floors alongside the celebrities; and an ingenious system of \\"trading in surpluses\\", to feed the newly destitute. Ax is aware that what he‚Äôs attempting would be impossible, were it not for the spectre of bloody anarchy on one hand, and on the other the glamour and the orgiastic release of the great Crisis Management concerts. But \\"people will do any thing, no limit, if it‚Äôs seen to be normal, and the role-models say it's okay...\\". If he can keep his Utopian programme going, somehow, just for a few years, something will survive. Aside from the breakneck pace and a playful, audacious style, the novel's strength (as many critics have observed) is the characterisation of the principals: Ax Preston, Sage Pender, and especially Fiorinda (real name, Frances), the teenage \\"rock and roll princess\\" with a hideous past. These three, a triad straight from genre fantasy, are marvellously brought to life, illuminating a rather formal, fiercely intelligent novel with joyous power.

He was soloist at many of the Philharmonic Society Concerts from 1816-1836, and first flautist with the principal theater orchestras. He toured extensively in Britain, but never on the Continent. Besides giving classes to many students, he wrote tutors for flute-playing which were published throughout the 19th century. Nicholson used a flute made by George Astor & Co., a London-based firm operating from c1778 to c1831. His father, also a celebrated flautist, modified the instrument, lining the headpiece with metal, enlarging the embouchure and toneholes with a view to making the flute's tone more powerful, yet still delicate, permitting the usual fingerings in the third octave, facilitating glidesa glide ‚Äî a portamento done by more-or-less slowly sliding one or more fingers off their holes and vibratos. Once his bravura style on the modified flute had become accepted in London, he licensed several London flute makers such as Clementi & Co., Astor, Rudall and Rose, and Potter to produce the 'Nicholson's Improved'. The structure of his new flute favoured flat keys such as E flat, A flat, and F and C minor. Nicholson's variations on Roslin Castle,Charles Nicholson's arrangement of Roslin Castle in F minor which he wrote in 1836, are typical of the 'National Melodies' in the adagio style in which he excelled. These remained important features of English flute-playing until after 1890. Even though Ardal Powell regards Nicholson as \\"the first native professional instrumentalist to achieve star status in Britain\\",Performing English Taste Charles Nicholson‚Äôs 'Gothick' Style Nicholson's present renown owes less to his personal style of playing than to Theobald Boehm's being greatly impressed by the flute's powerful tone on a visit in 1831. Writing to Mr. Broadwood in August 1871, Boehm notes: \\"I did as well as any continental flutist could have done, in London, in 1831, but I could not match Nicholson in power of tone, wherefore I set to work to remodel my flute. Had I not heard him, probably the Boehm flute would never have been made.\\" He also says \\"I was struck with the volume of the tone of Nicholson, who was then in the full vigour of his talent. This power was the result of the extraordinary size of the holes of his flute, but it required his marvellous skill and his excellent embouchure to mask the want of accuracy of intonation and equality of tone resulting from the position of the holes, which was incorrect and repugnant to the elementary principles of acoustics\\". From all accounts Nicholson had uncommonly large hands, and had even larger holes on his personal flute than those on the flutes bearing his name. Boehm promptly designed and marketed a new flute, embodying the earliest recognizable features of the modern flute.Flute HistoryBoehm, Nicholson and the English flute style ReferencesExternal links * External links *The Flute Book - Nancy Toff Category:1795 births Category:1837 deaths Category:British flautists ","title":"Charles Nicholson (flautist)"},{"id":"21716455","text":"Elmer Robert Burkart (February 1, 1917 ‚Äì February 6, 1995) was a Major League Baseball (MLB) pitcher.

He is an accomplished soloist, having played with some of Europe's leading orchestras, and has premiered several prominent trumpet concertos. Touvron has given over 3,000 concerts, features on over 70 recordings, and has won several prizes, including three international Grands Prix. Touvron also teaches trumpet and regularly conducts master classes around the world. He has been called \\"one of the leading pedagogues of trumpet technique and interpretation France has ever produced.\\" He wrote a biography on his mentor Maurice Andr√©, which was published in 2003.  Biography  Guy Touvron was born on 15 February 1950 in Vichy, France. While his parents were not musicians, his grandfather played the cornet. At the age of ten Touvron started playing the cornet, and after a few years he became proficient on both the cornet and trumpet. In 1967 Touvron enrolled at the Paris Conservatory of Music and studied under classical virtuoso trumpeter Maurice Andr√©. A year later the Conservatory awarded Touvron first prize for cornet, and a year after that, first prize for trumpet. Touvron held the position of principal trumpet for the Orchestre National de Lyon between 1969 and 1971, and for the French Radio Philharmonic Orchestra between 1971 and 1974. In 1973 he formed his own group, the Guy Touvron Brass Ensemble, and became a faculty member of the Lyons Conservatory in 1974. In 1990 Touvron began teaching at the Conservatoire National de R√©gion in Paris. He regularly conducts master classes around the world, including at the Juilliard School in New York City, and at the Royal Northern College of Music in Manchester. Many of Touvron's performances are of works by baroque composers like Bach, Albinoni and Torelli, but he also performs contemporary classical music and has premiered several prominent trumpet concertos by Ivan Jevtiƒá, Jacques Loussier, Fran√ßois Rauber and others. Over 20 compositions have been written for him. Touvron has performed with orchestras such as I Solisti Veneti, the English Chamber Orchestra, La Scala di Milano, The Luzern Festival Strings, the Prague Chamber Orchestra, as well as French Orchestras of Lyon, Toulouse, Pays de Loire, Pays de Savoie and Auvergne. He regularly appears in festivals at Lille, Prades, Lanaudi√®re (Canada), Bachwoche Ansbach, Pollenca (Spain), Stresa (Italy), Salzburg (Austria) and Montreux (Switzerland). Touvron features on over 70 recordings, has given over 3,000 concerts, and has won several prizes, including three international Grands Prix in Munich, Geneva and Prague. In the early 2000s, Touvron wrote a biography on his mentor Maurice Andr√© entitled Maurice Andr√©: Une trompette pour la renomm√©e (Maurice Andr√©: A Trumpet for Fame), which was published in 2003.

Shortly after, Reyes was spiritually adopted by a childless Theosophist couple from Ojai, California, who financed his higher education studies in philosophy and psychology. Continuing on what he learned from his mother, Benito dedicated his career to the understanding of cross-cultural studies of spiritual beliefs and practices related to conscious dying.

Construction on the park began in 1997.Suan Santiphap, Public Park Office, Department of Environment (in Thai). Retrieved on February 26, 2009. Santiphap Park was opened to the public on August 18, 1998. The name Santiphap, meaning \\"peace\\", as well as the date of the park's opening, commemorate the end of World War II, which took place 53 years earlier. The dove is the symbol of Santiphap Park. A blackened bronze sculpture situated in the park's central pond depicts a dove carrying in its beak an olive branch with five blossoms, representing the spread of peace throughout the world. The sculpture is based on a drawing by Pablo Picasso. The entrance signs to Santiphap Park are a facsimile of the handwriting of Buddhadasa Bhikkhu, a renowned Buddhist monk, philosopher and pacifist. Striated Heron at Santiphap Park Feral Pigeons at Santiphap Park Over 30 species of birds have been recorded in the park since its creation.

It is located in Corso Inghilterra. History The station was built in 1868 during the expansion of the city towards the west. Trains between Torino Porta Nuova and Milan stop at the station, including TGV services between Paris and Milan and other services using the Turin‚ÄìMilan high-speed line. Reconstruction In April 2006, reconstruction of the station began in conjunction with the Turin Passante regional railway. This involved quadrupling of the number of tracks that run through central Turin. At Porta Susa station, the line was widened to six tracks with new platforms being built beneath the thoroughfare Corso Inghilterra. A 300-metre long, 19-metre high glass and steel structure has been built above the tracks to create a new station, which is intended to become Turin's main hub of urban, regional and international rail traffic. The project was developed by the Paris-based studio, Silvio d'Ascia Architecture, in collaboration with AREP and Agostino Magnaghi, after the team had won an international competition. The station was inaugurated on 14 January 2013 by Prime Minister Mario Monti. The total cost ‚Äî estimated at ‚Ç¨65 million ‚Äî was borne entirely by the rail network operator, Rete Ferroviaria Italiana (RFI). Plans for the reconstruction project also included a 100-metre high office tower for the Italian State Railways, Ferrovie dello Stato. The Turin Metro opened a metro station at Porta Susa, which provides additional connections with Porta Nuova and Lingotto.
