Meander and Conspire Wines Aiken founded her own wine brand in 2000, called Meander Wines. The wine is named after her sons, Mitchell and Andrew. Her wines are made from Napa Valley fruit, with a focus on Cabernet Sauvignon. When she started Meander, she had to wait three years before she was able to acquire fruit. She received a phone call from vintner Gary Morisoli in 2003. She paid $8,200 for a ton of Cabernet Sauvignon grapes from Morisoli. The grapes came from the Rutherford AVA. Those grapes were blended with additional Cabernet Sauvignon fruit from a St. Helena based vineyard called Lewelling. She makes her wine at various locations in the Napa Valley. The wine is aged for 18 months in 100 percent French Oak barrels that are made of 65 percent new wood. The first vintage was the 2003 Meander Cabernet Sauvignon.

The new marina replaced the Oak Bay Boat House built in 1893. The Oak Bay Marina was home to the Pacific Undersea Gardens opened in 1964 and later relocated to Victoria's inner harbour in 1969, where it operated until its closure on October 17, 2013. The Oak Bay Marina was also home to Sealand of the Pacific which opened in 1969. The aquarium was populated by several Orcas that were hunted down and captured locally. Conditions for both whales and staff at the marina were widely criticized, and there were repeated calls to have the aquarium closed. The protests culminated in 1991, when one of the captured whales drowned a 20 year old trainer, Keltie Byrne, who had fallen into the pool. Renewed public pressure eventually forced the closure of Sealand of the Pacific in November 1992. The large whale sculpture at the front of the Oak Bay Marina is dedicated to Dr. Clifford Carl, Director of the British Columbia Provincial Museum. The Oak Bay Marina was visited in 1986 by then-US Vice President George H. W. Bush for a fishing trip off Oak Bay. During October 1996, a large storm occurred. During this storm, a large portion of the Oak Bay Marina became detached, and blew through the bay towards Glenlyon - Norfolk School. A large number of boats were damaged, and there was still one man on the docks at the time. When quoted, he said \\"I looked around and people were waving at me from the docks, and they were getting farther and farther away\\". He was later rescued by the Coast Guard and brought ashore.

It was released on January 29, 2013 through Island Records as the follow-up to his second remix album Never Say Never: The Remixes (2011). The release also marks Bieber's second acoustic album, following My Worlds Acoustic (2010). The album features acoustic and live versions of songs from his third studio album Believe (2012), as well as three new recordings. The album went to number one on the US Billboard 200 albums chart, making this Bieber's fifth number-one album and seventh consecutive top 10 album in the United States. Background Bieber confirmed the project on December 8, 2012, by tweeting \\"Been writing a lot...new stuff...and yeah. the acoustic album, new arrangements, is happening\\". The track listing for the (then) EP was revealed on December 22, 2012, featuring 8 tracks. On January 6, 2013 it was announced that 11 tracks would be featured on the album instead, including new songs \\"Nothing Like Us\\" \\"Yellow Raincoat\\" and \\"I Would\\". Critical reception Believe Acoustic received generally mixed reviews from music critics. Robert Copsey of Digital Spy wrote that the removal of the multi- layered production and \\"studio trickery\\" on Believe reveals a \\"smoother and less [...] babyish vocal than most will be familiar with\\". He noted that \\"embarrassingly weak lyrics\\" is a recurring issue throughout the album, though it's \\"largely saved\\" by Kanter, who \\"ensures the melodic hooks remain largely intact\\". He noted that it's \\"less of an issue\\" on the album's three new songs. He concluded that: \\"we'd prefer the polished, shinier and glossier Justin Bieber any day\\". Andrew Leahy of The Washington Times cited Believe Acoustic to be a way of \\"squeezing extra cash out of material that already has been released\\". He wrote that only a few of the new arrangements \\"shine any new light\\" on the original versions. Andy Kellman of Allmusic wrote that like My Worlds Acoustic (2010), Believe Acoustic \\"maintains the flow of Bieber product following a proper studio album\\". He noted that the \\"playful side\\" of Believe is not \\"well-suited for earnest, stripped-down renderings\\": \\"Party anthems like 'Beauty and a Beat' and lines like 'Chillin' by the fire while we eatin' fondue,' from 'Boyfriend,' seem silly when performed with the singer in serious artist mode.\\" Jody Rosen of Rolling Stone wrote that as \\"cash-grab\\" remix albums go, Believe Acoustic offers a \\"little added value, for hardcore fans, at least.\\" According to Rosen, the acoustic versions of \\"blustery\\" dance-pop songs like \\"All Around the World\\" and \\"Beauty and a Beat\\" sound \\"a tad wan\\", with \\"a six-string standing in for the synths and bludgeoning rhythms\\". She, however, stated that Bieber \\"gives the songs his best, and his raspy, soulful vocal tone stands out nicely against the stark musical backdrop\\". Rosen cited the best songs on the album to be the three new studio tracks. On February 9, 2013, Bieber gave a debut performance of \\"Nothing Like Us\\", a bonus track on Believe Acoustic on Saturday Night Live. He served as both the host and musical guest and also performed an acoustic set of \\"As Long as You Love Me\\".

Retrieved April 6th, 2019. In his research, Manning has been a frequent collaborator of Stephen Machin, another British labour economist.  Research on wages, wage bargaining and unemployment  Manning's first area of research has been wage bargaining. This research included the integration of trade union models in a sequential bargaining framework,Manning, A. (1987). An integration of trade union models in a sequential bargaining framework. Economic Journal, 97(385), pp. 121‚Äì139. the relationship between the tax system and wage bargaining in the UK (with Ben Lockwood),Lockwood, B., Manning, A. (1993). Wage setting and the tax system theory and evidence for the United Kingdom. Journal of Public Economics, 52(1), pp. 1‚Äì29. and the impact of wage bargaining on the link between unemployment and inflation (the Phillips curve).Manning, A. (1993). Wage bargaining and the Phillips curve: the identification and specification of aggregate wage equations. Economic Journal, 103(416), pp. 98‚Äì118. In the late 1980s, in work with George Alogoskoufis, Manning argued that workers' reluctance to reduce their wage expectations, along with firms' slow adjustment of employment, was among the main reasons for persistently high European unemployment.Alogoskoufis, G.S., Manning, A. (1988). On the persistence of unemployment. Economic Policy, 3(7), pp. 427‚Äì469. In the late 1990s, Manning and Machin also investigated the topic of long-term unemployment.Machin, S., Manning, A. (1999). The causes and consequences of longterm unemployment in Europe. In: Ashenfelter, O., Card, D. (eds.). Handbook of Labor Economics, vol. 3. Amsterdam: Elsevier, pp. 3085‚Äì3139.  Research on minimum wages From the mid-1990s on, Manning turned his attention to the study of minimum wages, especially in the UK. Together with Stephen Machin, he found that decreases in the ratio of minimum wages to average wages in the UK in the 1980s had contributed to the growing wage dispersion without raising employment.,Machin, S., Manning, A. (1994). The effects of minimum wages on wage dispersion and employment: Evidence from the UK Wages Councils. ILR Review, 47(2), pp. 319‚Äì329. a finding maintained in further work with Machin and Richard Dickens on the UK.Dickens, R., Machin, S., Manning, A. (1999). The effects of minimum wages on employment: Theory and evidence from Britain. Journal of Labor Economics, 17(1), pp. 1‚Äì22. Motivated by his research in the UK and further research by Card, Krueger and Katz in the US, Manning showed how, contrary to conventional wisdom, the theoretical effects of minimum wages on employment are ambiguous, with e.g. a binding minimum wage potentially raising employment even in the presence of involuntary unemployment.Manning, A. (1995). How do we know that real wages are too high? Quarterly Journal of Economics, 110(4), pp. 1111‚Äì1125. At the European level, in joint work several co-authors, Manning found that minimum wages in Europe between the mid-1960s and mid-1990s only caused higher unemployment if they kept the wages of low-wage jobs from decreasing, were relatively small for young people relative to average earnings when compared to the U.S., and didn't appear to have reduced employment, except possibly for young workers.Dolado, J. et al. (1996). The economic impact of minimum wages in Europe. Economic Policy, 11(23), pp. 317‚Äì372. In the early 2000s, Manning studied the impact of the UK National Minimum Wage (NMW) Act of 1998, finding e.g. in a study with Machin and Lupin Rahman that the NMW reduced wage inequality in the heavily industries such as the residential care homes industry by compressing the bottom of the wage distribution, while also reducing employment and hours worked, Machin, S., Manning, A., Rahman, L. (2003). Where the minimum wage bites hard: Introduction of minimum wages to a low wage sector. Journal of the European Economic Association, 1(1), pp. 154‚Äì180. though further research with Dickens suggested that the NMW's impact on wage inequality was overall limited due to only affecting 6‚Äì7% of UK workers directly.Dickens, R., Manning, A. (2004). Has the national minimum wage reduced UK wage inequality? Journal of the Royal Statistical Society: Series A, 167(4), pp. 613‚Äì626. More recently, together with Ghazala Asmat and John van Reenen, Manning has studied the impact of the deregulation of product and labour markets in the OECD on the wage share, finding that, on average, privatization accounts for a firth of the decrease in labour's share between 1980 and 2000, but for nearly half in Britain and France.Azmat, G., Manning, A., Reenen, J.v. (2012). Privatization and the decline of labour's share: International evidence from network industries. Economica, 79(315), pp. 470‚Äì492.  Research on imperfect competition in labour markets Since the 1990s, Manning has researched the impact of employers' market power in labour markets and its impact on especially wages, e.g. in the UK.Dickens, R., Machin, S., Manning, A. (1999). The effects of minimum wages on employment: Theory and evidence from Britain. Journal of Labor Economics, 17(1), pp. 1‚Äì22. This research agenda was popularized in a JEP article by Manning, Bhaskar and To,Bhaskar, V., Manning, A., To, T. (2002). Oligopsony and monopolistic competition in labor markets.

(2004). Is monopsony the right way to model labor markets? A review of Alan Manning's 'Monopsony in Motion'. International Journal of the Economics of Business, 11(3), pp. 369‚Äì378.Rizzo, M. (2004). Review of 'Monopsony in Motion: Imperfect Competition in Labor Markets'. ILR Review, 57(2), pp. 309‚Äì311. A comprehensive survey of imperfect competition in the labour market by Manning was published in the Handbook of Labor Economics.Manning, A. (2011). Imperfect competition in the labor market. In: Ashenfelter, O., Card, D. (eds.). Handbook of Labor Economics, vol. 4. Amsterdam: Elsevier, pp. 973‚Äì1041.  Research on gender in labour markets Another important field in Manning's research are gender-specific issues in labour market outcomes. Together with Azmat and Maia Guell, Manning shows that, in countries with large gender gaps in unemployment rates, there also are large gender gaps in flows between employment and unemployment, possibly due to the combination of gender differences in human capital and its interaction with labour market institutions.Azmat, G., Guell, M., Manning, A. (2006). Gender gaps in unemployment rates in OECD countries. Journal of Labor Economics, 24(1), pp. 1‚Äì37. In a study with Barbara Petrongolo on the part- time pay penalty for women in the UK, Manning attributes half of the penalty to differences in the characteristics of female full-time and part-time workers, especially occupational segregation, which also explains most of its growth in the 1980s and 1990s.Manning, A., Petrongolo, B. (2008). The part- time pay penalty for women in Britain. Economic Journal, 118(526), pp. F28-F51. Finally, in work with Joanna Swaffield, Manning has also studied the gender gap in early-career wage growth in the UK.Manning, A., Swaffield, J. (2008). The gender gap in early-career wage growth. Economic Journal, 118(530), pp. 983‚Äì1024.  Research on job polarization A more recent field of Manning's research is the study of technological change and job polarization. In the mid-2000s, in the wake of research by Autor, Levy and Murnane, Manning argued that the demand for the least-skilled jobs may be growing, albeit dependent on the physical proximity to the more- skilled.Manning, A. (2004). We can work it out: the impact of technological change on the demand for low-skill workers. Scottish Journal of Political Economy, 51(5), pp. 581‚Äì608. In his most highly cited publication, together with Maarten Goos, Manning showed that the UK had experienced since 1975 a pattern of polarization with rises in employment shares in the highest- and lowest-wage occupations and a \\"hollowing out\\" of medium-wage occupations, a pattern consistent with Autor et al.'s \\"routinization\\" hypothesis; for the 1970s to the 1990s, this polarization accounts for, respectively, half and one third of the growth in wage inequality in the upper and lower parst of the UK wage distribution.Goos, M., Manning, A. (2007). Lousy and lovely jobs: The rising polarization of work in Britain. Review of Economics and Statistics, 89(1), pp. 118‚Äì133. This finding ‚Äì the concentration of employment in low- and high-paid jobs with high non-routine task contents ‚Äì was maintained in further research by Manning and Goos with Anna Salomons on overall Europe, Goos, M., Manning, A., Salomons, A. (2009). Job polarization in Europe. American Economic Association: Papers and Proceedings, 99(2), pp. 58‚Äì63. wherein routine-biased technological change and offshoring play key roles.Goos, M., Manning, A., Salomons, A. (2014). Explaining job polarization: Routine-biased technological change and offshoring. American Economic Review, 104(9), pp. 2509‚Äì26.  Research on immigration and identity One of Manning's most recent research endeavours concerns the analysis of immigration and identity. For instance, together with Dustmann, Glitz and Algan, he found that in the UK, France and partly also in Germany, the gap between natives and immigrants in terms of educational achievement decreases over generations, though overall in all three countries the labour market performance of most immigrant groups as well as their descendants is still generally worse than that of natives, even if differences in education, regional allocation and experience are taken into account.Algan, Y. et al. (2010). The economic situation of first and second-generation immigrants in France, Germany and the United Kingdom. Economic Journal, 120(542), pp. F4-F30. In research with Sanchari Roy on the extent and determinants of British identity, he found that \\"the vast majority of those born in Britain, of whatever ethnicity or religion, think of themselves as British\\", while \\"newly arrived immigrants almost never think of themselves as British but the longer they remain in the UK, the more likely it is that they do\\".Manning, A., Roy, S. (2010). Culture clash or culture club? National identity in Britain. Economic Journal, 120(542), pp. F72-F100. Finally, in a study with Marco Manacorda and Jonathan Wadsworth on the impact of immigration to the UK on the structure of wages, Manning found that immigration primarily reduced the wages of immigrants ‚Äì and in particular university-educated immigrants ‚Äì with little effect on the wages of the native-born, suggesting that UK natives and foreign born workers are imperfect substitutes.Manacorda, M., Manning, A., Wadsworth, J. (2012). The impact of immigration on the structure of wages: theory and evidence from Britain. Journal of the European Economic Association, 10(1), pp. 120‚Äì151.

During his years of living in the house, Reid greatly modified the house, and as a result it has been deemed a fine example of changing tastes in architectural styles. In 1973, the Reid House was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. While it qualified for the Register simply because of its architecture, its importance was largely derived from its close association with Whitelaw Reid.

Early life She was born Joan Elizabeth Eyres Monsell in Dumbleton, Worcestershire, the second of three daughters of Bolton Eyres Monsell and his wife Sybil (n√©e Eyres). Her father was Conservative Member of Parliament for Evesham from 1910 to 1935. He served as Conservative Chief Whip from 1923 to 1929, and First Lord of the Admiralty from 1931 to 1936. He became Viscount Monsell in 1935. Her brother Graham inherited the viscountcy on her father's death in 1969. Her family home was Dumbleton Hall in Worcestershire, inherited by her mother. She was educated at St James's School in Malvern and before travelling in Europe, attended finishing schools in Paris and Florence She dabbled with several possible careers. She was a talented photographer of landscapes and architecture, with pictures published in Architectural Review and Horizon. She married John Rayner, features editor of the Daily Express, in 1939. Second World War During the Second World War, she was commissioned to photograph buildings that were likely to be bombed. She also worked as a nurse at the start of the war, but then trained in encryption, and worked in the British embassies in Madrid and Algiers before being posted to Cairo, where she first met her future husband Patrick Leigh Fermor in 1944. He was then an SOE officer famed for his part in the kidnapping of General Kreipe from Crete. Joan and he quickly fell in love, although she was still married to Rayner. Her marriage to Rayner was dissolved in 1947. She and Leigh Fermor remained close companions (although not exclusively) and were married in 1968, by which time he had published several books. Her private income allowed him to concentrate on his writing. With Patrick in Greece Joan had joined Leigh Fermor in Athens in 1946, where he was deputy director of the British Council's Institute, and joined him on a lecture tour of Greece. She was also secretary to the cartoonist Osbert Lancaster. She travelled in France with Cyril Connolly in 1948, taking photographs to accompany a guidebook that was never finished; Connolly later said that he was distracted by her beauty. Connolly described her in 1949 as \\"very beautiful: tall, fair, slanting eyes, yellow skin\\". She accompanied Patrick to the Caribbean after he was invited to write text for a travel book to accompany images by a Greek artist named Costas, published as The Traveller's Tree in 1950. She also accompanied Patrick on visits to remote parts of Greece that were published in his book in Mani (1958) about southern Greece and Roumeli (1966) about northern Greece, accompanied in the original editions by her photographs. Joan and Patrick lived together in a house designed and built by Patrick in an olive grove on a cliff top at Kardamyli, on the Mani Peninsula, the central peninsula of the three which extend southwards from the Peloponnese. Their circle of friends included Alberto Giacometti, Francis Bacon, Lawrence Durrell, Stephen Spender, Giorgos Seferis, Nikos Hadjikyriakos-Ghikas and many others. She loved cats and enjoyed playing chess. After suffering a fall, she died in Mani, and was buried in Dumbleton, where Patrick joined her after his death in 2011. They had no children.

By mid-2012, the Commission had drafted the ASEAN Human Rights Declaration. The Declaration was adopted unanimously by ASEAN members at its 18 November 2012 meeting in Phnom Penh, Cambodia. The Declaration details ASEAN nations' commitment to human rights for its 600 million people. The Declaration includes 40 paragraphs under 6 headings. Multiple Asian declarations have been made prior to the ASEAN declaration in 2012. The first declaration in Asia to involve multiple nations throughout the region was a Southeast Asian declaration called the Declaration of the Basic Duties of ASEAN Peoples and Governments in 1983, which was first drafted by the father of human rights in the Philippines, Sen. Jose W. Diokno. Eventually the evolution of these documents lead to the current one adopted by ASEAN beginning 2012. The first five Articles of the ASEAN Human Rights declaration affirm that human rights belong to \\"Every person,\\" specifically emphasizing that they belong to \\"women, children, the elderly, persons with disabilities, migrant workers, and vulnerable and marginalised groups (Art 5). Article 10 directly affirms \\"all the civil and political rights in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights,\\" and these are detailed in Articles 11- 25. Article 26 next affirms \\"all the economic, social and cultural rights in the Universal Declaration...,\\" with these described in Articles 27 to 34. The ASEAN Human Rights Declaration goes beyond the Universal Declaration by making explicit \\"the right to safe drinking water and sanitation\\" (Art. 28. e.), \\"the right to a safe, clean and sustainable environment\\" (Art 28.f.), protection from discrimination in treatment for \\"people suffering from communicable diseases, including HIV/AIDS\\" (Art. 29), the \\"right to development ... aimed at poverty alleviation, the creation of conditions including the protection and sustainability of the environment...(Art. 36), and the right to peace (Art. 30). However, the Commission has been widely criticized for the lack of transparency and failure to consult with ASEAN civil society during drafting process. The Declaration itself has been criticized by ASEAN civil society, international human rights organizations such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, the U.S. Department of State, and the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights. Human Rights Watch described it as a \\"declaration of government powers disguised as a declaration of human rights\\". ASEAN civil societies have noted that \\"The Declaration fails to include several key basic rights and fundamental freedoms, including the right to freedom of association and the right to be free from enforced disappearance.\\" Further, the Declaration contains clauses that many fear could be used to undermine human rights, such as ‚Äúthe realization of human rights must be considered in the regional and national context‚Äù (Art. 7), or that human rights might be limited to preserve \\"national security\\" or a narrowly defined ‚Äúpublic morality‚Äù (Art. 8). The U.S. Department of State and the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights welcomed the Declaration, but with substantive reservations. The U.S. State Department issued a statement of support, \\"in principle,\\" for \\"ASEAN's efforts to develop a regional human rights declaration,\\" but expressing concern for \\"the use of the concept of 'cultural relativism' ..., stipulating that domestic laws can trump universal human rights, incomplete descriptions that are mentioned elsewhere, introducing novel limits to rights, and language that could be read to suggest that individual rights are subject to group veto.\\" The U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights \\"welcomed the renewed commitment by leaders of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations to universal human rights norms\\" noting that \\"Other regions have shown how regional human rights systems can evolve and improve over time\\" and that \\"it is essential that ASEAN ensures that any language inconsistent with international human rights standards does not become a part of any binding regional human rights convention.‚Äù  See also  # ASEAN Intergovernmental Commission on Human Rights # Universal Declaration of Human Rights References  External links  # http://aichr.org/?doing_wp_cron=1516204835.9638769626617431640625 # http://www.asean.org/storage/images/ASEAN_RTK_2014/6_AHRD_Booklet.pdf Category:ASEAN Category:Human rights instruments ","title":"ASEAN Human Rights Declaration"},{"id":"37994890","text":"First United Methodist Church is a historic Methodist church at 101 N. 2nd Street in West Monroe, Louisiana.

Capitulum mitella is the only species in the genus. It is commonly known as the Japanese goose barnacle or kamenote and is found on rocky shores in the Indo-Pacific region. Description Capitulum mitella has a short leathery stalk or peduncle supporting an upper region or capitulum, the whole being up to long. The peduncle is muscular and contractile and its surface is covered with fine scales. The capitulum is protected by eight large, sheathing scales and a ring of about twenty tiny scales surround the joint of capitulum and peduncle. Inside these scales is a cavity containing the head and thorax of the animal and its appendages. Distribution and habitat Capitulum mitella occurs in the South China Sea and the East China Sea. It is found attached to rocks in the lower part of the intertidal zone in areas with strong currents. It typically occurs crowded with others in cracks and grooves on otherwise smooth rocky surfaces. The barnacle Tetraclita squamosa often occurs in the same locations and grows alongside it, and the primitive barnacle Ibla cumingi may grow in between or on the larger capitulum plates. Biology When under water, Capitulum mitella extends its five hind pairs of thoracic legs and spreads them out in the current like a net. It uses the front pair of legs to manipulate the objects it catches and move them into its mouth. Its diet mainly consists of zooplankton. Capitulum mitella is a simultaneous hermaphrodite. Each barnacle is capable of fertilising other nearby individuals by transmitting sperm through a long, fine tube and also of brooding its own eggs in its mantle cavity. When the eggs hatch, the larvae are released into the sea. They have six naupliar stages during which food reserves are built up and one non-feeding cyprid stage which seeks out a suitable hard surface on which to settle. It then fix itself in place, undergoes metamorphosis and becomes a sessile juvenile. In Hong Kong harbour, where this barnacle can be found growing on pilings, it often has a nemertean worm (Nemertopsis quadripunctatus) living inside its mantle cavity and feeding on the eggs being brooded there. The worm can be long but only in diameter. Uses Capitulum mitella is one of about a dozen species of goose barnacle that are gathered commercially and eaten by humans. These barnacles are a luxury food item in Japan, Taiwan, Korea and China.

The company was formed in 1939 in Bloomfield, Connecticut, Retrieved on December 8, 2012. by Jennie R. Zachs, a schoolteacher, who saw the need for transparent measuring tools such as rulers, triangles, curves and protractors. During the 1990s, the company expanded into the paper crafting and scrapbooking fields under the Little Yellow Bicycle and D√©j√† Views brands. In June 2012, Acme United Corporation bought the ruler, lettering and drafting portions of C-Thru Ruler. The scrap booking part of the business, continues to be managed by the Zachs family under the Little Yellow Bicycle Inc. name. History Jennie Zachs Jennie R. Zachs, born in 1898, was the daughter of Benjamin and Julia Zachs who emigrated from Russia to the United States in the early 1900s. Retrieved on December 9, 2012. She graduated from high school in Hartford, CT. A few years later, she graduated from college and became a schoolteacher. While teaching, she developed the idea that when students would be able to see through their rulers, it would make the tool much more useful in the classroom. As a result, Ms. Zachs started the development of two transparent rulers made out of plastic. In 1939, she founded C-Thru Ruler Company in Bloomfield, Connecticut Retrieved on December 9, 2012. and designed a whole family of transparent measuring tools like rulers, triangles, curves and protractors. Shortly after, she engaged a supplier to mill the tools out of plastic sheet and began to attend different trade shows and conventions for blue printers and art materials dealers to sell the products. She noticed that the transparent measuring tools could effectively replace wood and metal measuring devices for many applications in drafting, designing and drawing. 1940‚Äì1969 Only one year after founding the company, Jennie Zachs took in two partners to handle the expansion of C-Thru. Edward Zachs, her brother, joined C-Thru and Anna Zachs, her sister, became an investor. On October 14, 1946, C-Thru Ruler Company was formally incorporated in Connecticut. In 1957, Edward‚Äôs son, Ted also started working at the Company. The following years, sales representatives were hired and the products line was significantly expanded through a distribution arrangement with Letraset, a manufacturer of dry transfer, rub on lettering and lettering tapes. 1970‚Äì1989 In 1970, Letraset decided to start selling its own line of transparent tools. In response thereto, C-Thru acquired a small manufacturer of dry transfer lettering products and started offering its own line of vinyl lettering. One year later, Ted Zachs bought out the other family members and became the sole shareholder of C-Thru. In 1983, Jed Zachs, the son of Ted, joined the business and in 1985 another small acquisition was completed, which expanded the line of adhesive backed vinyl letters and stencils for signage purposes. 1990‚Äì2012 In 1993, Ross Zachs, Ted Zachs‚Äô younger son also became part of the company. Jed oversaw manufacturing and related operations, while Ross played a key role in the creative and marketing sides of the business. The following year, C-Thru‚Äôs owners saw that scrapbooking was growing rapidly and decided to enter that market with a line of stencils, templates and rulers. In the same year, it also created the Deja Views brand and began to sell to hobby and craft dealers, primarily small independent stores and a few chains, including Michaels, which only had a handful of stores at that time. To expand the design and paper crafting business, a new brand called Little Yellow Bicycle was launched in 2008 with a differentiated line for independent retailers. In June 2012, the non-scrapbooking part of the business was sold to Acme United Corporation. Acme United purchased the inventory, tooling, brands, and other intellectual property for approximately $1.47 million. In 2011, revenues for the C-Thru Ruler part of the business reached about $2.7 million. Retrieved on December 8, 2012.

Originally a farmhouse based in an agricultural area in the parish of Patcham, north of Brighton, it was bought and extensively remodelled in 1790 for a long-established local family. It was their seat for over 100 years, but the Neoclassical-style mansion and its grounds were bought by the local council in the interwar period when Moulsecoomb was transformed into a major council estate. Subsequent uses have varied, and Moulsecoomb Place later became part of the University of Brighton's range of buildings. Student housing has been built to the rear; but much of the grounds, the house itself and a much older cottage and barn attached to the rear have been preserved. The house is a Grade II Listed building. History At the time of the Domesday survey in 1086, Moulsecoomb was an outlying part of the large parish of Patcham, which was centred on Patcham village north of Brighton. Spelt Mulescumba at that time, the name varied considerably over the centuries and was not standardised to its current spelling until the 1960s. The manor and estate of Moulsecoomb later belonged to Lewes Priory, and Mouscombe Farm was first named in the early 17th century when it was owned by Sir Edward Culpepper. On his death in 1730, it was left to Sir William Culpeper, 1st Baronet of Preston Hall, the first of the Culpeper baronets. By this time, nothing more than a farming hamlet had developed in the steep-sided valley: it had no church of its own, and was dependent on Patcham. In the early 16th century, a timber-framed hall house was built on the estate near the farm (although some sources claim a late-14th-century date). A wooden tithe barn was erected next to it later in the 16th century, and was subsequently extended in flint. The hall house is the oldest secular building in Brighton, and is presumed to be a remnant of a larger medieval manor house‚Äîperhaps the forerunner of the present Moulsecoomb Place, which has its origins in the early 18th century. At that time, when the farm was still in agricultural use, a farmhouse was built adjoining the hall house. In 1790, Benjamin Tillstone bought the farm and converted it into a rural retreat with the farmhouse as its centrepiece. He commissioned a major overhaul of Moulsecoomb Place, extending the fa√ßade and refacing it in yellow brick. Moulsecoomb Place underwent maintenance in 2010. The early 20th-century extension is hidden behind the tree to the left. The building was thereafter the seat of the locally important Tillstone family for more than a century, and was the centrepiece of an estate extending to . A wide verandah was added to the house at ground-floor level by 1810, and the hall house was converted into stables. A regular visitor around this time was the Prince Regent (later King George IV), a friend of the family. He had his own bedroom above the drawing room, and a dovecote near the house was adapted into a summer house, in which the prince would sit and practise playing a silver flute he had received from Tillstone. The dovecote was accordingly known as Prince's Tower, but was vandalised beyond repair in 1942. Three \\"huge mahogany doors\\" in the house were given by the prince in return; they may have come from the demolished Grove House at Old Steine, where the prince stayed when he first visited Brighton in 1783. More work was carried out on the building in 1906 or 1913, when a further two bays were added to the south side of the seven-bay fa√ßade. The final Tillstone family owner, Mr. B.T. Rogers-Tillstone, sold Moulsecoomb Place and the family's estate to Brighton Corporation (predecessor of the present city council) in February 1925. Much of the land, which had been transferred from the parish of Patcham into the borough of Brighton in October 1923, was used to develop the Moulsecoomb housing estates (South, East and North Moulsecoomb), collectively the largest area of council housing in Brighton. Hundreds of \\"homes fit for heroes\\" were built to replace unsuitable inner-city slums. Moulsecoomb Place and its grounds were retained, and the building was used by the Corporation to house its Parks and Recreation Department. Later it housed Moulsecoomb's first library and was used to provide extra capacity for a local school. By 1971 most of the interior was used for offices, and a social club and bar occupied the hall house. The building is next to the main (Moulsecoomb) campus of the University of Brighton. In 1993, the university submitted a plan to buy Moulsecoomb Place and its grounds, build accommodation for 163 students on the former plant nursery to the rear, and convert the building itself and the old tithe barn into the headquarters of its Student Services division and a children's nursery. Permission for this was granted in the same year. The student residences consist of flats accommodating six to eight people, each with their own bedroom but with shared bathroom and laundry facilities. Breakfast and evening meals are provided on site. As of 2012, rent was ¬£142 per week or ¬£5,538 for a 39-week academic year tenancy. Moulsecoomb Place was designated a Grade II Listed building on 20 August 1971. The timber-framed hall house to the rear had been listed on its own on 13 October 1952; in 1971 the listing was expanded to cover the whole building. Architecture The southern extension has a bow-fronted section. Moulsecoomb Place is the only building in the Moulsecoomb area mentioned by Ian Nairn and Nikolaus Pevsner in the Sussex edition of their Buildings of England architectural guides. They describe it as \\"an early 19th-century seven-bay house of yellow brick\\", and note that the hall house attached to the rear is \\"the only worthwhile timber-framed cottage in Brighton\\". The seven-bay fa√ßade, which faces east, is the original part dating from 1790; another two-window range was added on the south side in the early 20th century, making the composition asymmetrical. The original section has yellow brickwork in a Flemish bond pattern to the main elevation and brown and yellow gauged brickwork on the north (side) wall. Yellow bricks are also used on the south extension, but in a stretcher bond layout. The 1790 section has a 2‚Äì3‚Äì2 bay pattern whose central three-bay section projects slightly and is set beneath a pediment. Its tympanum has a pattern of raised brickwork. Behind the pediment is a parapet and a cornice with mutules below. Some of the ground-floor windows have elements of the Palladian and Neoclassical Adam styles; those at first-floor level are straight-headed. The hipped roof has several chimney-stacks. The early 20th-century extension is in complementary style. On the east elevation, a single-storey two-window section projects forward and is topped with a parapet and cornice. This continues round to the south elevation, which has a full-height bow front with a three-window range. A modern conservatory has been added to one side. The timber-framed hall house, whose interior had been significantly altered by the time it was in use as a bar and social club, is believed to be the surviving section of a larger building dating from the medieval era. It has two storeys, the upper of which is jettied. The areas between the closely studded timber frame are filled in with a mixture of plaster, flint and brickwork, and tiles cover the hipped roof. There are some small sash windows. The tithe barn, which was extended in the 19th century, is linked to the hall house by a bridge-like section of the same date. At the time of the listing by English Heritage, when the building was in use as offices, the interior had elaborate fittings. The main staircase is in a hall with a vaulted ceiling, in which mahogany doors with Greek Revival-style panelling lead to various rooms. Some have original fireplaces in styles including Neoclassical and Jacobean. The staircase itself has mahogany rails and Gothic Revival-style balusters of cast iron. There is some stained glass bearing the date 1913.

Bayou Black Drive in Gibson, Louisiana. It was built in 1849 and added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1986. History On May 17, 1849 land was donated in Tigerville, Louisiana (now formally known as Gibson) by Cornelius C. Wallis and John Wallis. They donated this land to the Methodists for the construction of a cemetery and a Church. The church took approximately six months to build and was completely built by the end of the year. This church turned out to be the simplest and smallest church of the surrounding areas of Tigerville, Thibodaux, and Houma. At the time, it was known as the Sycamore Church because of the sycamore trees that grew in the yard. The common style during this time and the style of this church is a variation of the Greek Revival Style. Tobias Gibson, William Thompson, and John McIntyre were a few of the original members of the church. Tobias Gibson and his wife moved from Kentucky to Louisiana in the 1850s. Tobias owned Plantations named Holly Wood, Live Oak, and Oak Forest near Tigerville, Louisiana. They had eight children, but one child in particular was more eminent. His name is Randall Lee Gibson and he served in the United States Senate and the United States House of Representatives. Randall conducted all his business in French including owning a Plantation in Lafourche Parish and practicing law in Thibodaux, Louisiana. Also, it was he who requested Tigerville, Louisiana be changed to Gibson, Louisiana in 1859. Greek revival architecture The South was successful in adapting existing styles rather than developing their own distinctive style. During the colonial times, it was the Georgian style that really took hold until the Greek Revival Style came into favor in the 1830s. Yet, often there are houses who show traces of the Georgian influences. However, the earliest example of Greek Revival Styling was built in Philadelphia in 1798 which was the Latrobe's Bank of Pennsylvania. The Greek Styling did not reach the Deep South till the very last. However, once it reached the United States, fine stone was no longer used. Instead deTocqueville's materials, ‚Äúpainted wood‚Äù and ‚Äúwhite washed bricks‚Äù were used. Greek Revival Architecture was associated with the ‚Äúwhite columned look‚Äù in Greece, but that did was not common in Louisiana. In certain southern states, including Louisiana, the Greek Revival looked different from popular Greek temples found elsewhere in the United States. However, the most common are buildings in ‚Äúthe peripteral mode,‚Äù the galleried cottage and the double gallery house. thumb  References  Category:Methodist churches in Louisiana Category:Churches on the National Register of Historic Places in Louisiana Category:Greek Revival church buildings in Louisiana Category:Churches completed in 1849 Category:Churches in Terrebonne Parish, Louisiana Category:1849 establishments in Louisiana Category:National Register of Historic Places in Terrebonne Parish, Louisiana ","title":"Gibson Methodist Episcopal Church"},{"id":"37995102","text":"St. Matthew's Episcopal Church is a parish of the Episcopal Church in Houma, Louisiana, in the Episcopal Diocese of Louisiana.

The church is a red brick Gothic-style cruciform basilica with buff-colored brick accents. It has Romanesque Revival details. It has somewhat projecting buttresses reinforcing its outer walls. with three photos and two maps History St. Mary Magdalen Parish was established in 1842 by Pere Antoine Desire Megret. The first church, the remodeled home of Joseph LeBlanc, was built and dedicated in the spring of 1844. From the beginning it was placed under the invocation of Saint Mary Magdalen, a favorite saint among the descendants of the Acadian exiles all through South Louisiana. The name was always retained, except for a short time during Father Laforest's administration, when after the 1907 fire, the church was temporarily called Saint Ann's, at least in the reports. In September 1847, Reverend Nicholas Francais was given charge of Saint Mary Magdalen Church, but Pere Megret continued to look after the Catholics of Abbeville and vicinity. Father Francais served there until after September 1850. In 1851, Archbishop Blanc made Vermilion Parish an independent parochial jurisdiction, with Saint Mary Magdalen's Church as the parish church, and Reverend Hubert Thirion, a young French priest, the first resident pastor. He was joined by Reverend Francis Mittlebronn, a newly ordained priest, who became the first parish assistant. Father Thirion and Father Mittlebronn remained until sometime after October 12, 1852. The church was without a pastor for a time, then in February 1853, Reverend J. Regale was sent to take charge of the parish. Father Regale left Abbeville sometime in 1853, and in either November or December that year Abbeville was given its new pastor, Reverend Stephen (Etienne) Joseph Foltier, a French priest. In February 1854, a fire at the rectory destroyed the church records. The current parish records begin on February 20, 1854. There was an attempt to reconstruct the baptism records by having the parishioners come in to report the baptism of their children. The marriage records were completely lost. Father Foltier left in September 1856 and Reverend Jean Arthur Poyet was his successor. Father Poyet was an energetic priest, and he visited every corner of the parish from Delcambre out to Gueydan and Cossinade, and down to the swamps on the Gulf shore. With genuine regret, the parishioners of Saint Mary Magdalen bade farewell to Father Poyet in January 1866. The new pastor was Reverend Theodore Lamy, another energetic French priest, a man of great spiritual stature. In December 1868, Father Lamy welcomed a young French priest named Alexandre Mehault, who came to serve as assistant, and eventually became one of the outstanding pastors of Saint Mary Magdalen Church. Father Mehault became pastor in May 1870. During his pastorate, a new rectory was built, a new bell was put in the church, and many improvements were made to the church. He made periodic visits to his home in France and, while there, obtained vestments, ornaments, sacred vessels, statues and other religious ornaments for Saint Mary Magdalen's church. The parish church became a place of beauty, and ceremonies of the church were conducted with brilliance and solemnity in accord with their high purpose of glorifying Almighty God. New stained-glass windows and a beautiful set of hand-painted Stations of the Cross on canvas were obtained. Many of these articles were donated by people of Vermilion Parish. Father Mehault also brought Catholic education to the parish, persuading the Sisters of Mount Carmel at New Orleans to staff a school in Abbeville. It soon became apparent that the frame structure on the site of Joseph LeBlanc's home was far too small. Everyone agreed that a new and larger church was needed. On May 28, 1884, the new Saint Mary Magdalen Church was solemnly blessed. In May 1896, St. Mary Magdalen's Parish was legally incorporated as \\"The Congregation of St. Mary Magdalen Roman Catholic Church\\" and all of the parochial property was formally transferred by the archdiocese to the new parish corporation. Father Mehault left Abbeville in July 1899. He was succeeded by Reverend Fabian Laforest, a native of Canada. Father Laforest was a priest of many attainments, artistic, deeply pious, scholarly and a capable administrator. In 1904, Father Laforest installed a new organ in the church and enlarged the rectory. In 1905 he arranged for a new cemetery, and installed new pews in the church. On March 22, 1907, at 7 p.m. the church of Saint Mary Magdalen, Abbeville, was completely destroyed by fire, as was the presbytery attached to the church. The fire destroyed the baptism register covering 1901‚Äì1904. During that period, there were 1541 baptisms. Parishioners were asked to come to the church to record the baptisms that occurred during that time. Of the 1541 baptism records lost, 274 were recovered. Father Laforest erected a temporary frame church, which was blessed under the invocation of St. Ann's. The new Saint Mary Magdalen Church was completed and put into use in 1911. Father Laforest died on August 26, 1915, and was buried in the new cemetery he had developed. Reverend Julien Ravier Bollard was named the new pastor on July 1, 1915. Father Bollard was a man of great piety, self-sacrifice, zeal, charity and whole-hearted devotion to the flock entrusted to his care. Father Bollard served in Abbeville for 15 years. It was during this time that the Diocese of Lafayette was formed, and Saint Mary Magdalen Parish was part of the new diocese. On June 20, 1930, His Excellency, Bishop Jeanmard appointed Reverend Edmund Daull, a native of Strasbourg, France, as pastor. Father Daull made many improvements to the church. During Father Daull's pastorate, youth work began in earnest due mainly to the zeal and energy of a young assistant who came in 1938 ‚Äî Reverend Joseph Verbis Lafleur. Father Lafleur lost his life while a prisoner during World War II. He lost his life while aboard a sinking prisoner of war ship. He was last seen persuading men to leave the hold of the ship, blessing them and helping them up the ladder to possible safety. Father Daull died suddenly on December 5, 1949, and was buried at the foot of the cross in the old cemetery. Right Reverend Monsignor Paul Fusilier became the new pastor on January 16, 1950. During his pastorate, Monsignor Fusilier was instrumental in building the new Catholic school building for Mount Carmel in 1953. He made many necessary repairs and improvements to the parish church and rectory, including installing the new cross atop the spire himself. In 1951, he erected the new Chapel of Saint Therese of Lisieux on the east side of town, and established a convent for the French Dominican Sisters. Monsignor Fusilier left Abbeville in 1959. Most Reverend Bishop Robert E. Tracy became the new pastor of Saint Mary Magdalen Parish. Bishop Tracy remained in Abbeville only six months, but accomplished many notable things. Among them: restoring the existing rectory, construction of a six-room catechetical center, tuck pointing and water proofing the exterior of the church, installation of an air conditioning unit at the convent of the Sisters of Mount Carmel, and the development of a successful adult religious education program. In January 1960, Monsignor Ignatius A. Martin assumed the pastorate and served in Abbeville until October 1973. Monsignor Martin introduced the Legion of Mary, the Charismatic Renewal and the Cursillo to the parish. He was also instrumental in the construction of a music room and an additional classroom at Mount Carmel. Other improvements included the construction of a mausoleum, garden crypt, and Saint Paul Cemetery, a new high school (Vermilion Catholic High), a football stadium, expanded office facilities at the rectory, two parish community retreats, more renovation work on the church which included enlargement of the sacristy. During his pastorate, both extraordinary ministers of the Word and extraordinary ministers of Holy Communion were appointed to serve the Parish community. Monsignor Richard von Phul Mouton, a native of Lafayette, was welcomed as pastor in November 1973. Monsignor Mouton also made enhancements to the beauty of the church. He sought to expand and improve the ministry to the elderly and homebound, being responsible for the appointment of some seventeen extraordinary ministers of Holy Communion. One of his major accomplishments was a significant reduction of the parish debt. In December 1975, the cellar of the church sacristy was renovated and turned into a weekday Mass chapel. The chapel was named Holy Parents Chapel. Monsignor Mouton served on the Abbeville Bicentennial Committee, which was instrumental in erecting the stature of Pere Antoine Desire Megret in Magdalen Square. Monsignor also commissioned the painting of a mural in the east vestibule of the Holy Parents Chapel to commemorate Saint Mary Magdalen's anniversary. On August 25, 1981, the sacristy and chapel were badly damaged by fire. Repairs and renovations took place in 1981‚Äì82. In January 1984, the community center was donated to Mt. Carmel to be used as classrooms and to make room for the new ministries building. The ministries building, which houses the parish offices, a large meeting room, two smaller meeting rooms and a bookstore, was completed in 1985.

Ancient times Encyclopedias have existed for around 2,000 years, although even older glossaries such as the Babylonian Urra=hubullu and the ancient Chinese Erya are also sometimes described as \\"encyclopedias\\". Marcus Terentius Varro Marcus Terentius Varro (; 116 BC ‚Äì 27 BC) was an ancient Roman scholar and writer. His Nine Books of Disciplines became a model for later encyclopedists, especially Pliny the Elder. The most noteworthy portion of the Nine Books of Disciplines is its use of the liberal arts as organizing principles. Varro decided to focus on identifying nine of these arts: grammar, rhetoric, logic, arithmetic, geometry, astronomy, musical theory, medicine, and architecture. Using Varro's list, subsequent writers defined the seven classical \\"liberal arts of the medieval schools\\". Pliny the Elder Naturalis Histori√¶, 1669 edition, title page The earliest encyclopedic work to have survived to modern times is the Naturalis Historia of Pliny the Elder, a Roman statesman living in the 1st century AD. He compiled a work of 37 chapters covering natural history, architecture, medicine, geography, geology, and all aspects of the world around him. He stated in the preface that he had compiled 20,000 facts from 2000 works by over 200 authors, and added many others from his own experience. The work was published around AD 77‚Äì79, although he probably never finished proofing the work before his death in the eruption of Vesuvius in AD 79.Naturalis Historia > My subject is a barren one ‚Äì the world of nature, or in other words life; > and that subject in its least elevated department, and employing either > rustic terms or foreign, many barbarian words that actually have to be > introduced with an apology. Moreover, the path is not a beaten highway of > authorship, nor one in which the mind is eager to range: there is not one of > us who has made the same venture, nor yet one Greek who has tackled single- > handed all departments of the subject. He also elaborates on the difficulties of writing such a work: > It is a difficult task to give novelty to what is old, authority to what is > new, brilliance to the common-place, light to the obscure, attraction to the > stale, credibility to the doubtful, but nature to all things and all her > properties to nature. This work became very popular in Antiquity, and survived, with many copies being made and distributed in the western world. It was one of the first classical manuscripts to be printed in 1470, and has remained popular ever since as a source of information on the Roman world, and especially Roman art, Roman technology and Roman engineering. It is also a recognised source for medicine, art, mineralogy, zoology, botany, geology and many other topics not discussed by other classical authors. Among many interesting entries are those for the elephant and the murex snail, the much sought-after source of Tyrian purple dye. Although his work has been criticized for the lack of candor in checking the \\"facts\\", some of his text has been confirmed by recent research, like the spectacular remains of Roman gold mines in Spain, especially at Las M√©dulas, which Pliny probably saw in operation while a Procurator there a few years before he compiled the encyclopedia. Although many of the mining methods are now redundant, such as hushing and fire-setting, it is Pliny who recorded them for posterity, thereby helping us understand their importance in a modern context. Pliny makes clear the fact in the preface to his work that he had checked his facts by reading and comparing the works of others, as well as referring to them by name. Many such books are now lost works and remembered only by his references, much like the lost sources mentioned in the work of Vitruvius a century earlier. Middle Ages First printed edition of 1472 (by Guntherus Zainer, Augsburg), title page of book 14 (de terra et partibus), illustrated with a T and O map. The work De nuptiis Mercurii et Philologiae (\\"About the wedding of Mercury and Philologia\\") written by Martianus Capella (4th-5th century) was very influential on the successive medieval encyclopedias. It consists in a complete encyclopedia of classical erudition. It firstly introduced the division and classification of the seven liberal arts (trivium and quadrivium), followed by many successive works along the Middle Ages. The first Christian encyclopedia were the Institutiones divinarum et saecularium litterarum of Cassiodorus (543-560), which were divided in two parts: the first one dealt with Christian Divinity; the second one described the seven liberal arts. Saint Isidore of Seville, one of the greatest scholars of the early Middle Ages, is widely recognized as being the author of the first known encyclopedia of the Middle Ages, the Etymologiae or Origines (around 630), in which he compiled a sizable portion of the learning available at his time, both ancient and modern. The encyclopedia has 448 chapters in 20 volumes, and is valuable because of the quotes and fragments of texts by other authors that would have been lost had they not been collected by Saint Isidore. The most popular encyclopedia of the Carolingian Age was the De universo or De rerum naturis by Rabanus Maurus, written about 830, which was based on Etymologiae. Many encyclopedic works were written during the 12th and 13th centuries. Among them, Hortus deliciarum (1167‚Äì1185) by Herrad of Landsberg which is thought to be the first encyclopedia written by a woman. De proprietatibus rerum by Bartholomeus Anglicus (1240) is often described as the most widely read and quoted encyclopedia in the High Middle AgesSee \\"Encyclopedia\\" in Dictionary of the Middle Ages. while Vincent of Beauvais's Speculum Majus (1260) was the most ambitious encyclopedia in the late-medieval period at over 3 million words. The first encyclopedias in vernacular languages were translations or abridgements of works in Latin. Among them, the most famous is Li livre dou Tr√©sor, written in French by the Florentine Brunetto Latini. It is mainly based on the Speculum Majus. The works by the Flemish Jacob van Maerlant, as a whole, are regarded as an encyclopedia. These works, too, are based on former Latin texts. Renaissance Anatomy in Margarita Philosophica, 1565 These works were all hand copied and thus rarely available, beyond wealthy patrons or monastic men of learning: they were expensive, and usually written for those extending knowledge rather than those using it. During the Renaissance, the creation of printing allowed a wider diffusion of encyclopedias and every scholar could have his or her own copy. The De expetendis et fugiendis rebus by Giorgio Valla was posthumously printed in 1501 by Aldo Manuzio in Venice. This work followed the traditional scheme of liberal arts. However, Valla added the translation of ancient Greek works on mathematics (firstly by Archimedes), newly discovered and translated. The Margarita Philosophica by Gregor Reisch, printed in 1503, was a complete encyclopedia explaining the seven liberal arts. Much encyclopaedism of the French Renaissance was based upon the notion of not including every fact known to humans, but only that knowledge that was necessary, where necessity was judged by a wide variety of criteria, leading to works of greatly varying sizes. B√©roalde de Verville laid the foundation for his encyclopaedic works in a hexameral poem entitled Les cognoissances n√©cessaires for example. Often, the criteria had moral bases, such as in the case of Pierre de La Primaudaye's L'Acad√©mie fran√ßaise and Guillaume Telin's Bref sommaire des sept vertus &c..; Encyclopaedists encountered several problems with this approach, including how to decide what to omit as unnecessary, how to structure knowledge that resisted structure (often simply as a consequence of the sheer amount of material that deserved inclusion), and how to cope with the influx of newly discovered knowledge and the effects that it had on prior structures. The term encyclopaedia was coined by 15th century humanists who misread copies of their texts of Pliny and Quintilian, and combined the two Greek words \\"enkyklios paideia\\" into one word. The phrase enkyklios paideia (·ºêŒ≥Œ∫œçŒ∫ŒªŒπŒøœÇ œÄŒ±ŒπŒ¥ŒµŒØŒ±) was used by Plutarch and the Latin word Enciclopedia came from him. The first work titled in this way was the Encyclopedia orbisque doctrinarum, hoc est omnium artium, scientiarum, ipsius philosophiae index ac divisio written by Johannes Aventinus in 1517. The English physician and philosopher, Sir Thomas Browne, specifically employed the word encyclopaedia for the first time in English as early as 1646 in the preface to the reader to describe his Pseudodoxia Epidemica or Vulgar Errors, a series of refutations of common errors of his age: \\"And therefore in this Encyclop√¶die and round of Knowledge, like the great and exemplary Wheels of Heaven, we must observe two Circles <...>\\" Browne structured his encyclopedia upon the time-honoured schemata of the Renaissance, the so-called 'scale of creation' which ascends a hierarchical ladder via the mineral, vegetable, animal, human, planetary and cosmological worlds. Browne's compendium went through no less than five editions, each revised and augmented, the last edition appearing in 1672. Pseudodoxia Epidemica found itself upon the bookshelves of many educated European readers, for throughout the late 17th century and early 18th century it was translated. For many years it was thought incompatible with the French and Dutcheze, into the French, Dutch and German languages as well as Latin.  Traditional encyclopedias   Rise of printed encyclopedias  Encyclop√©die, 1773 The beginnings of the modern idea of the general-purpose, widely distributed printed encyclopedia precede the 18th century encyclopedists. However, Chambers' Cyclop√¶dia, or an Universal Dictionary of Arts and Sciences (1728), and the Encyclop√©die of Diderot and D'Alembert (1751 onwards), as well as Encyclop√¶dia Britannica and the Conversations-Lexikon, were the first to realize the form we would recognize today, with a comprehensive scope of topics, discussed in depth and organized in an accessible, systematic method. Chambers, in 1728, followed the earlier lead of John Harris's Lexicon Technicum of 1704 and later editions (see also below); this work was by its title and content \\"A Universal English Dictionary of Arts and Sciences: Explaining not only the Terms of Art, but the Arts Themselves\\". Harris' Lexicon Technicum, title page of 2nd edition, 1708 John Harris is often credited with introducing the now-familiar alphabetic format in 1704 with his English Lexicon Technicum: Or, A Universal English Dictionary of Arts and Sciences: Explaining not only the Terms of Art, but the Arts Themselves ‚Äì to give its full title. Organized alphabetically, its content does indeed contain explanation not merely of the terms used in the arts and sciences, but of the arts and sciences themselves. Sir Isaac Newton contributed his only published work on chemistry to the second volume of 1710. Its emphasis was on science‚Äîand conformably to the broad 18th-century understanding of the term 'science', its content extends beyond what would be called science or technology today, and includes topics from the humanities and fine arts, e.g. a substantial number from law, commerce, music, and heraldry. At about 1,200 pages, its scope can be considered as more that of an encyclopedic dictionary than a true encyclopedia. Harris himself considered it a dictionary; the work is one of the first technical dictionaries in any language. Ephraim Chambers published his Cyclop√¶dia in 1728. It included a broad scope of subjects, used an alphabetic arrangement, relied on many different contributors and included the innovation of cross-referencing other sections within articles. Chambers has been referred to as the father of the modern encyclopedia for this two- volume work. A French translation of Chambers' work inspired the Encyclop√©die, perhaps the most famous early encyclopedia, notable for its scope, the quality of some contributions, and its political and cultural impact in the years leading up to the French Revolution. The Encyclop√©die was edited by Jean le Rond d'Alembert and Denis Diderot and published in 17 volumes of articles, issued from 1751 to 1765, and 11 volumes of illustrations, issued from 1762 to 1772. Five volumes of supplementary material and a two volume index, supervised by other editors, were issued from 1776 to 1780 by Charles-Joseph Panckoucke. The Encyclop√©die represented the essence of the French Enlightenment. The prospectus stated an ambitious goal: the Encyclop√©die was to be a systematic analysis of the \\"order and interrelations of human knowledge.\\"Jean le Rond d'Alembert, \\"Preliminary Discourse\\", in Denis Diderot's The Encyclop√©die: Selections, ed. and trans. Stephen J. Gendzier (1967), cited in Hillmelfarb 2004 Diderot, in his Encyclop√©die article of the same name, went further: \\"to collect all the knowledge that now lies scattered over the face of the earth, to make known its general structure to the men among we live, and to transmit it to those who will come after us\\", to make men not only wiser but also \\"more virtuous and more happy.\\"Denis Diderot, Rameau's Nephew and Other Works, trans. and ed. Jacques Barzun and Ralph H. Bowen (1956), cited in Himmelfarb 2004 Realizing the inherent problems with the model of knowledge he had created, Diderot's view of his own success in writing the Encyclop√©die were far from ecstatic. Diderot envisioned the perfect encyclopedia as more than the sum of its parts. In his own article on the encyclopedia, Diderot also wrote, \\"Were an analytical dictionary of the sciences and arts nothing more than a methodical combination of their elements, I would still ask whom it behooves to fabricate good elements.\\" Diderot viewed the ideal encyclopedia as an index of connections. He realized that all knowledge could never be amassed in just one large work, but he hoped the relations among the subjects could be. The Encyclop√©die in turn inspired the venerable Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, which had a modest beginning in Scotland: the first edition, issued between 1768 and 1771, had just three hastily completed volumes ‚Äì A‚ÄìB, C‚ÄìL, and M‚ÄìZ ‚Äì with a total of 2,391 pages. By 1797, when the third edition was completed, it had been expanded to 18 volumes addressing a full range of topics, with articles contributed by a range of authorities on their subjects. The German-language Conversations- Lexikon was published at Leipzig from 1796 to 1808, in 6 volumes. Paralleling other 18th century encyclopedias, its scope was expanded beyond that of earlier publications, in an effort at comprehensiveness. It was, however, intended not for scholarly use but to provide results of research and discovery in a simple and popular form without extensive detail. This format, a contrast to the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, was widely imitated by later 19th century encyclopedias in Britain, the United States, France, Spain, Italy and other countries. Of the influential late-18th century and early-19th century encyclopedias, the Conversations-Lexikon is perhaps most similar in form to today's encyclopedias. A typical custom-made encyclopedia engraving by Maurice Dessertenne for the Nouveau Larousse illustr√© (France, 1898‚Äì1907) The early years of the 19th century saw a flowering of encyclopedia publishing in the United Kingdom, Europe and America. In England Rees's Cyclop√¶dia (1802‚Äì19) contains an enormous amount in information about the industrial and scientific revolutions of the time. A feature of these publications is the high-quality illustrations made by engravers like Wilson Lowry of art work supplied by specialist draftsmen like John Farey, Jr. Encyclopedias were published in Scotland, as a result of the Scottish Enlightenment, for education there was of a higher standard than in the rest of the United Kingdom. The National Revival of Bulgaria, influenced by the Enlightenment, resulted in Petar Beron's Primer with Various Instructions (also known as the Fish Primer) in 1824. It was a small encyclopedia for children, containing fables, proverbs, ancient history, basic arithmetics, zoology and linguistics. Beron later published a 7-volume work in natural sciences known as Panepisteme in 1867. The 17-volume Grand dictionnaire universel du XIXe si√®cle and its supplements were published in France by Pierre Larousse from 1866 to 1890. Encyclop√¶dia Britannica appeared in various editions throughout the century, and the growth of popular education and the Mechanics' Institutes, spearheaded by the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge led to the production of the Penny Cyclopaedia, as its title suggests issued in weekly numbers at a penny each like a newspaper. A more commercially successful encyclopaedia then Penny Cyclopaedia aimed at the same audiences was Chambers's Encyclopaedia A Dictionary of Universal Knowledge for the People, edited by Andrew Findlanter. It was partly based on a translation into English of the 10th edition of the German-language Konversations-Lexikon, which would become the Brockhaus Enzyklop√§die. The publishers found it necessary, however, to supplement the core text with a significant amount of additional material, including more than 4000 illustrations not present in Brockhaus. Andrew Findlater was the acting editor and spent ten years on the project.1 Chambers's Encyclopaedia first appeared between 1859 and 1868 in 520 weekly parts at three-halfpence each[14] and totalled ten octavo volumes, with 8,320 pages, and over 27,000 articles from over 100 authors. It was also published as bound volumes between 1860 and 1868. 1913 advertisement for Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, the oldest and one of the largest contemporary English encyclopedias. In the early 20th century, the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica reached its eleventh edition, and inexpensive encyclopedias such as Harmsworth's Universal Encyclopaedia and Everyman's Encyclopaedia were common. Popular and affordable encyclopedias such as Harmsworth's Universal Encyclopaedia and The Children's Encyclop√¶dia appeared in the early 1920s. In the United States, the 1950s and 1960s saw the introduction of several large popular encyclopedias, often sold on installment plans. The best known of these were World Book Encyclopedia and Funk & Wagnalls Standard Encyclopedia. The second half of the 20th century also saw the publication of several encyclopedias that were notable for synthesizing important topics in specific fields, often by means of new works authored by significant researchers. Such encyclopedias included The Encyclopedia of Philosophy (first published in 1967 and now in its second edition), and Elsevier's Handbooks In Economics series. Encyclopedias of at least one volume in size exist for most if not all academic disciplines, including, typically, such narrow topics such as bioethics and African-American history. International development During the 19th and early 20th century, many smaller or less developed languages saw their first encyclopedias, using French, German, and English role models. While encyclopedias in larger languages, having large markets that could support a large editorial staff, churned out new 20-volume works in a few years and new editions with brief intervals, such publication plans often spanned a decade or more in smaller languages. The first large encyclopedia in Russian, Brockhaus and Efron Encyclopedic Dictionary (86 volumes, 1890‚Äì1906), was a direct cooperation with the German Brockhaus. Without such a formal cooperation, the Swedish Conversations-lexicon (4 volumes, 1821‚Äì1826) was a translation of Brockhaus 2nd edition. The first encyclopedia written originally in Swedish was Svenskt konversationslexikon (4 volumes, 1845‚Äì1851) by Per Gustaf Berg. A more ambitious project was Nordisk familjebok, established in 1875 and intended to comprise 6 volumes. But in 1885, when it had published 8 volumes and gotten only halfways (A‚ÄìK), the publisher turned to the government for extra funding; encyclopedias had become national monuments. It was finished in 1894 with 18 volumes,Slutord, postscriptum to the 1st edition, 1894. with two supplement volumes (1896‚Äì1899). Encyclopedia Americana at G√∂ttingen State and University Library. The first major Danish encyclopedia was Salmonsens Konversationsleksikon (19 volumes, 1893‚Äì1911). In Norway, encyclopedias follow the unique history of the Norwegian language, the Bokm√•l variant having branched off from Danish during the 19th century. After the national independence in 1905, publisher Aschehoug (owned by William Martin Nygaard) hired librarian Haakon Nyhuus to edit Illustreret norsk konversationsleksikon (6 volumes, 1907‚Äì1913), in later editions known as Aschehougs konversasjonsleksikon. In the Nynorsk variant of the language, Norsk Allkunnebok (10 volumes, 1948‚Äì1966) was the only encyclopedia until the arrival of wikipedia. The first major Finnish encyclopedia was Tietosanakirja (11 volumes, 1909‚Äì1922). Inspired by the minority language example of Norsk Allkunnebok, a Swedish-language encyclopedia of Finland was initiated in 1969 and eventually published as Uppslagsverket Finland (3 volumes, 1982‚Äì1985; 2nd edition in 5 volumes, 2003‚Äì2007). With such a small market, the sales revenue only covered the printing cost, while editors were paid by endowments. In 2009 the entire contents was made available online, free of charge. Already during czarist Russian rule, two editions appeared of the Latvian KonversƒÅcijas vƒÅrdnƒ´ca (2 volumes, 1891‚Äì1893; 4 volumes, 1906‚Äì1921). The larger Latvie≈°u konversƒÅcijas vƒÅrdnƒ´ca (21 volumes, A‚ÄìTjepolo, 1927‚Äì1940) was interrupted by World War II and never completed. After the war, Latvian emigrants in Sweden published Latvju enciklopƒìdija (3 volumes, 1950‚Äì1956, with a supplement volume in 1962). Soviet authories published Latvijas PSR mazƒÅs enciklopƒìdijas (3 volumes, 1967‚Äì1970) and Latvijas padomju enciklopƒìdija (10 volumes, 1981‚Äì1988).List of Latvian encyclopedias from the website Historia.lv. Similarly, in the history of Lithuanian encyclopedias, the Lietuvi≈°koji enciklopedija (9 volumes A‚ÄìJ, 1933‚Äì1941) was interrupted by World War II and never completed. Lithuanian emigrants in the United States published Lietuvi≈≥ enciklopedija (35 volumes, 1953‚Äì1966).

Emergence of digital and online encyclopedia   Digital encyclopedias  By the late 20th century, encyclopedias were being published on CD-ROMs for use with personal computers. Microsoft's Encarta, launched in 1993, was a landmark example as it had no printed equivalent. Articles were supplemented with video and audio files as well as numerous high-quality images. After sixteen years, Microsoft discontinued the Encarta line of products in 2009. Traditional encyclopedias are written by a number of employed text writers, usually people with an academic degree, and distributed as proprietary content. Encyclopedias are essentially derivative from what has gone before, and particularly in the 19th century, copyright infringement was common among encyclopedia editors. However, modern encyclopedias are not merely larger compendia, including all that came before them. To make space for modern topics, valuable material of historic use regularly had to be discarded, at least before the advent of digital encyclopedias. Moreover, the opinions and world views of a particular generation can be observed in the encyclopedic writing of the time. For these reasons, old encyclopedias are a useful source of historical information, especially for a record of changes in science and technology.Kobasa, Paul A. \\"Encyclopedia.\\" World Book Online Reference Center. 2008. [Place of access.] 13 Jan. 2008 As of 2007, old encyclopedias whose copyright has expired, such as the 1911 edition of Britannica, are also the only free content English encyclopedias released in print form. However, works such as the Great Soviet Encyclopedia, which were created in the public domain, exist as free content encyclopedias in other languages.  Rise of online, free, crowd-sourced encyclopedias  The concept of a new free encyclopedia began with the Interpedia proposal on Usenet in 1993, which outlined an Internet-based online encyclopedia to which anyone could submit content and that would be freely accessible. Early projects in this vein included Everything2 and Open Site. In 1999, Richard Stallman proposed the GNUPedia, an online encyclopedia which, similar to the GNU operating system, would be a \\"generic\\" resource. The concept was very similar to Interpedia, but more in line with Stallman's GNU philosophy. It was not until Nupedia and later wikipedia that a stable free encyclopedia project was able to be established on the Internet. wikipedia is one of the first \\"user generated content\\" encyclopedias The English wikipedia, which was started in 2001, became the world's largest encyclopedia in 2004 at the 300,000 article stage.\\"wikipedia Passes 300,000 Articles making it the worlds largest encyclopedia\\", Linux Reviews, 2004 Julich y 7. By late 2005, wikipedia had produced over two million articles in more than 80 languages with content licensed under the copyleft GNU Free Documentation License. As of August 2009, wikipedia had over 3 million articles in English and well over 10 million combined in over 250 languages. wikipedia currently has articles in English. Since 2003, other free encyclopedias like the Chinese-language Baidu Baike and Hudong, as well as English language encyclopedias like Citizendium and Knol have appeared. Knol has been discontinued. An encyclopedia's hierarchical structure and evolving nature is particularly adaptable to a digital format, and all major printed general encyclopedias had moved to this method of delivery by the end of the 20th century. Disk-based, typically DVD- ROM or CD-ROM format, publications have the advantage of being cheaply produced and easily portable. Additionally, they can include media which are impossible to store in the printed format, such as animations, audio and video. Hyperlinking between conceptually related items is also a significant benefit, although even Diderot's encyclopedia had cross-referencing. On-line encyclopedias offer the additional advantage of being dynamic: new information can be presented almost immediately, rather than waiting for the next release of a static format, as with a disk- or paper-based publication. Many printed encyclopedias traditionally published annual supplemental volumes (\\"yearbooks\\") to update events between editions, as a partial solution to the problem of staying up-to-date, but this of course required the reader to check both the main volumes and the supplemental volumes. Some disk-based encyclopedias offer subscription-based access to online updates, which are then integrated with the content already on the user's hard disk in a manner not possible with a printed encyclopedia. Information in a printed encyclopedia necessarily needs some form of hierarchical structure. Traditionally, the method employed is to present the information ordered alphabetically by the article title. However, with the advent of dynamic electronic formats the need to impose a pre-determined structure is less necessary. Nonetheless, most electronic encyclopedias still offer a range of organizational strategies for the articles, such as by subject, area, or alphabetically. Digital encyclopedias also offer greater search abilities than printed versions. While the printed versions rely on indexes to assist in searching for topics, computer accessible versions allow searching through article text for keywords or phrases. Specialized encyclopedias may offer a more comprehensive content. For example, Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, ADAM Medical Encyclopedia (which includes over 4,000 articles about diseases, tests, symptoms, injuries, and surgeries), the Wiki Encyclopedia of Law and the Encyclopedia of Earth all provide a more focused list of topics.  Non- Western encyclopedias   Byzantine encyclopedias  Byzantine encyclopedias were compendia of information about both Ancient and Byzantine Greece. The first of them was the Bibliotheca written by the patriarch Photius (9th century). The Suda or Souda (Greek: Œ£Œø·ø¶Œ¥Œ±) is a massive 10th century Byzantine encyclopedia of the ancient Mediterranean world, formerly attributed to an author called Suidas. It is an encyclopedic lexicon, written in Greek, with 30,000 entries, many drawing from ancient sources that have since been lost, and often derived from medieval Christian compilers. Arabic and Persian The early Muslim compilations of knowledge in the Middle Ages included many comprehensive works. Around year 960, the Brethren of Purity of BasraP.D. Wightman (1953), The Growth of Scientific Ideas were engaged in their Encyclopedia of the Brethren of Purity. Notable works include Abu Bakr al-Razi's encyclopedia of science, the Mutazilite Al-Kindi's prolific output of 270 books, and Ibn Sina's medical encyclopedia, which was a standard reference work for centuries. Also notable are works of universal history (or sociology) from Asharites, al-Tabri, al-Masudi, Tabari's History of the Prophets and Kings, Ibn Rustah, al-Athir, and Ibn Khaldun, whose Muqaddimah contains cautions regarding trust in written records that remain wholly applicable today. These scholars have influenced methods of research and editing, due in part to the Islamic practice of isnad which emphasized fidelity to written record, checking sources, and skeptical inquiry. An acquisition of knowledge it was believed not only enlightened the mind but also led to a greater appreciation of God. To be remarkable during these times was to keep pace with the ‚Äòmarch of intellect‚Äô and the printing press became a necessity for the widespread dissemination of this commodity called knowledge. As a means of cultural production, the printing press was the very embodiment of the ideal of ‚ÄòEnlightenment‚Äô.Nair, Savithri Preetha. \\"'...Of real use to the people': The Tanjore printing press and the spread of useful knowledge.\\" Sage Publications. In the Islamic Republic of Iran, recent works include the Encyclopaedia of the World of Islam prepared in 10 volumes by The Encyclopaedia Islamica Foundation, the Encyclopaedia of Contemporary Islam published as a four-volume English encyclopedia including around 1200 entries. Other such works are: the Encyclopedia of Imam Ali, the Encyclopedia of Qur'anology, and the Encyclopedia of Lady FƒÅtima, all published by the Islamic Research Institute for Culture and Thought (IICT). India VarƒÅhamihira's (505‚Äì587 CE) Brihat Samhita (\\"large compilation\\") is an encyclopedic work, not only dealing with astrology but also rainfall, clouds, water-divination, intentions and characteristics of animals, perfumes, erotic recipes, pimples, temples, architecture and other topics. China The enormous encyclopedic work in China of the Four Great Books of Song, compiled by the 11th century during the early Song dynasty (960‚Äì1279), was a massive literary undertaking for the time. The last encyclopedia of the four, the Prime Tortoise of the Record Bureau, amounted to 9.4 million Chinese characters in 1,000 written volumes. There were many great encyclopedists throughout Chinese history, including the scientist and statesman Shen Kuo (1031‚Äì1095) with his Dream Pool Essays of 1088, the statesman, inventor, and agronomist Wang Zhen (active 1290‚Äì1333) with his Nong Shu of 1313, and the written Tiangong Kaiwu of Song Yingxing (1587‚Äì1666), the latter of whom was termed the \\"Diderot of China\\" by British historian Joseph Needham.Needham, Volume 5, Part 7, 102. The Yongle Emperor of the Ming dynasty oversaw the compilation of the Yongle Encyclopedia, one of the largest encyclopedias in history, which was completed in 1408 and comprised over 370 million Chinese characters in 11,000 handwritten volumes, of which only about 400 remain today. In the succeeding Qing dynasty, the Qianlong Emperor personally composed 40,000 poems as part of a 4.7 million page library in 4 divisions, including thousands of essays, called the Siku Quanshu which is probably the largest collection of books in the world. It is instructive to compare his title for this knowledge, Watching the waves in a Sacred Sea to a Western-style title for all knowledge. Encyclopedic works, both in imitation of Chinese encyclopedias and as independent works of their own origin, have been known to exist in Japan since the 9th century.

St. Mary's Episcopal Church was built in 1857 to serve approximately 20 plantation families in the remote Tunica area north of St. Francisville, Louisiana. The design is attributed to New York architect Frank Wills, a prominent 19th century proponent of the Gothic Revival. Wills' belief in the English Country church as the ideal model for American Episcopal congregations can be clearly seen in the design of St. Mary's. Two other churches by Wills are known in the region, Christ Church in Napoleonville, Louisiana and the Chapel of the Cross near Madison, Mississippi. In 1858 the church was consecrated by Bishop (later Confederate General) Leonidas Polk, the \\"Fighting Bishop\\" of Civil War fame. The church was built on the Old East Tunica Road on 5 acres donated by Sarah Mulford, The title description is written \\"per aversionem\\" so that the boundaries cannot be identified exactly. In 1928 State Highway 66 was built about 1/2 mile west of the church and the old road was abandoned, leaving the church with no vehicular access, except by private farm roads. The church was deconsecrated in 1947, and today stands empty, gradually being overtaken by the surrounding forest, which has completely overgrown the graveyard north of the church and the old roadway. St. Mary's Church was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980.

In 1984, the computer was featured in the educational television series NDR-Klein-Computer for NDR-Schulfernsehen (NDR School Television). It was also broadcast on the computer television show ' on the Bavarian TV network Bayerisches Fernsehen (BFS). History The NDR Klein Computer was created by Rolf-Dieter Klein, a computer enthusiast who regularly contributed articles to the German computer magazine mc. His plan was not only to give a basic introduction to the way a computer operates, but also to introduce a modular system through which laymen could learn to complete basic programming exercises, as well as acquire the skills to operate a high-end home computer. Under the direction of Joachim Arendt, they developed a television series that was picked up by Norddeutscher Rundfunk (NDR) for its NDR-Schulfernsehen (NDR School Television) channel. The series, titled NDR-Klein-Computer, consisted of twenty-six episodes of fifteen minutes each. Klein hosted the show and wrote articles in mc to supplement the series. He published a book on the same subject, titled: Microcomputer Selbstgebaut und Programmiert (DIY Microcomputer Building and Programming), through Franzis Verlag, which also released the TV series on VHS. The computer's hardware was provided by Graf Elektronik System in Kempten, and sold at an electronics store in Detmold. The company Fischertechnik also produced a robot kit, which was one of the most comprehensive 32-bit programming language applications at the time. Features The NKC was built with several different hardware configurations, from a simple 8-bit single- board computer based on a Zilog Z80A processor to a 32-bit system equipped with a Motorola 68020 CPU. The software could be loaded with EPROMs or involve an operating system such as CP/M which could handle executable programs in various programming languages. A helper card with an Intel 8088 processor allowed the NKC to run MS-DOS. Systems could be customized to handle many different peripherals including PS/2 keyboard, 3¬Ω-inch floppy disks, IDE-hard drives and modern storage. Users have developed new cards which replaced the former specialized components. For instance, a system could contain a new graphics card (with VGA connector), one serial port, a sound card, and a mouse connector. Another system configuration that supports booting via the IDE- interface has been developed for the 68xxx family.

In the 1930s it was demolished and was replaced with the Taksim Gezi Park, Divan Hotel, Hilton Hotel, Hyatt Regency Hotel, and the TRT Radio Buildings. It is considered to have been the largest non-Muslim cemetery in Istanbul's history. History Armenian tombstones of the cemetery discovered in 2013 during excavations at Gezi Park The Pangaltƒ± cemetery was founded in 1560 after an epidemic caused the Armenian community of Constantinople to petition Sultan Suleyman. It was enlarged in 1780 and enclosed by a wall in 1853. The Pera district was very close to the cemetery, so an outbreak of cholera in 1865 led the government to ban burials and allocate them to the ≈ûi≈üli Armenian Cemetery instead. The Pangaltƒ± cemetery was demolished in the 1930s and in 1939 its marble tombstones were sold and used to build the Gezi Park's fountains and stairs. Other parts of the cemetery were used to construct Emin√∂n√º square which was, along with Gezi Park, designed by city planner Henri Prost. In 2013, during excavation work for the reconstruction of Taksim square, 16 tombstones from the Armenian cemetery were discovered. Legal Case In 1932 Mesrob Naroyan, the Armenian Patriarchate of Constantinople, filed a lawsuit for the return of the property, but the Istanbul Municipality argued that he had been a legal non-entity in Turkey since 1916 (the position of Armenian Patriarchate had been officially suspended in 1916 as part of the Armenian Genocide) and therefore had no title to the land, even though he still functioned at the Armenian Patriarchate of Constantinople in Kumkapƒ±, Istanbul. The Patriarchate acknowledged the lack of title, but argued legitimacy to represent the cemetery on behalf of both the Armenian Catholic Community and the Surp Agop Armenian Hospital. The commission to investigate land ownership found the Patriarch's claims groundless, so title remained with the Istanbul municipality and the third party owners.

Early life He was the fourth son of Kiliaen van Rensselaer (1586‚Äì1643) and his second wife, Anna van Wely (1601‚Äì1670). His father was a Dutch diamond and pearl merchant from Amsterdam who was one of the founders and directors of the Dutch West India Company and was instrumental in the establishment of New Netherland and in 1630, became the first patroon of Rensselaerswyck. His eldest sibling, and the only child to live to adulthood from his father's first marriage to Hillegonda van Bijler, was Johan van Rensselaer (1625‚Äì1663), his half-brother. Together, his parents had eight children, including Jan Baptist van Rensselaer (1629‚Äì1678), and Jeremias van Rensselaer (1632‚Äì1674). Nicholas was liberally educated in Holland, and studied theology there until his studies were temporarily interrupted when the family sent him to apprentice with a spice merchant. In December 1657, he was with a cloth dealer, but returned to his studies six months later.van der Waal, Ernestine G.E., \\"Prophecy and profit: Nicolaes van Rensselaer, Charles II and the conversion of the Jews\\", University of Leiden Career In Brussels, he met Charles II of England, who was then in exile. Claiming to have had a premonition, Van Rensselaer predicted that Charles would be restored to the throne. Van Rensselaer's family thought him half mad. He subsequently went to England as chaplain to the Dutch embassy, and the king, recognizing him and recollecting his prediction, gave him a gold snuff box with his likeness in the lid. Van Rensselaer was appointed chaplain to the Dutch ambassador.Bielinski, Stefan. \\"Nicholas Van Rensselaer\\", New York State Museum After the Dutch ambassador left Great Britain, Van Rensselaer was licensed by Charles to preach to the Dutch congregation at Westminster, was ordained a deacon in the English church, and appointed lecturer at St Margaret Lothbury. New Netherland In 1674, after the end of the Third Anglo-Dutch War when Edmund Andros was commissioned governor of New Netherland, Van Rensselaer accompanied him to North America, bearing a letter of recommendation from the Duke of York, son of Charles II who later became James II of England, in which he requested that Van Rensselaer be placed in charge of one of the Dutch churches in New York or Albany when there should be a vacancy. He became colleague pastor of the church in Albany shortly after his arrival, and in September 1675, was invited by the governor to preach in the Dutch church in New York. However, the pastor, William Van Nieuwenhuysen, absented himself from the service, and forbade Van Rensselaer's baptizing any children that might be presented for that ordinance. Van Nieuwenhuysen rejected Van Rensselaer's ordination as not being in conformity with the order of the Dutch churches, nor with the terms of the treaty. In October 1675, the matter was resolved when Van Rensselaer promised to conform as a minister of the Dutch Reformed Church of Albany and Rensselaerwyck to the liturgy and discipline of the Reformed church of Holland. Dispute with Leisler On Sunday, August 13, 1676, Nicholas van Rensselaer preached a sermon in the meeting house of the Dutch Reformed Church in Albany. Jacob Leisler and Jacob Milborne took issue with the Dominie's (a pastor in the Dutch Reformed Church in the United States) remarks concerning original sin, and proceeded to criticize him for not being orthodox. Van Rensselaer complained to the Albany Court that in misrepresenting his sermons, Leisler had alienated the congregation and that the preaching and talents of the Dominie had been brought into contempt.Schnurman, Claudia. \\"Merchants, Ministers and the Van Rensslaer - Leisler Controversy of 1676 as a Dress Rehearsal for 1689\\", in Jacob Leisler's Atlantic World in the Later Seventeenth Century, Hermann Wellenreuther, ed., LIT Verlag M√ºnster, 2009 The Dominie was ordered to post a bond, and when he refused was order confined to his house. He then sent Stephanus Van Cortlandt, (the brother-in-law of his then deceased brother, Jeremias) to represent him before Governor Andros in New York. The Governor's Council ordered both sides to post bond. Leisler failed to furnish the bond that was required of him, a warrant was issued for his arrest, and the churches and people were thrown into a ferment. At last, a court was held at Albany before which Van Rensselaer and Nieuwenhuysen appeared with papers and witnesses. After a review of the whole case, they were told by order of the governor \\"to be reconciled according to Christian love and duty.\\" The court ordered the parties to \\"forgive and forget,\\" and that Leisler and Milborne pay the whole costs, since they gave occasion for the differences. Van Rensselaer again resumed his charge, but a year later he was refused a seat among the elders. It was resolved that he have a suitable one behind the magistrates. In 1677, Nicholas van Rensselaer was removed from the ministry by Governor Andros. Manor of Rensselaerwyck In October 1674, when his brother Jeremias died, the new patroon, Kiliaen, the son of his eldest brother Johan, became the 4th patroon of Rensselaerwyck. As Kiliaen was a minor and was residing in Holland, Nicholas was made director of Rensselaerwyck.Hauck- Whealton, Joshua. \\"Nicholas the Prophet\\", Clermont State Historic Site, October 6, 2009 The Rensselaer's in Holland hoped that their brother's connection with the British Royal Family would help secure the patent for the Rensselaerwyck holdings. Nonetheless, this appointment caused some consternation among their American counterparts and the widow of Jeremias, Maria van Cortlandt van Rensselaer, became treasurer, and her brother, Stephanus Van Cortlandt, became bookkeeper. Personal life In 1675, at age thirty-nine, he married nineteen-year-old Alida Schuyler (b. 1656), daughter of Philip Pieterse Schuyler. They had no children.

It was developed in some haste under the manufacturer's Technical Director, Ferdinand Porsche in parallel with the smaller Mercedes-Benz W 01 (which never progressed beyond the prototype stage) and the two-litre-engined Mercedes-Benz W02 following the creation of Daimler-Benz, formally in July 1926, from the fusion of the Daimler and Benz & Cie auto-businesses.Oswald, p. 221  Naming conventions  The manufacturer applied the widely followed German naming conventions of the time. On the Mercedes-Benz 12/55 PS the ‚Äú12‚Äù defined the car's tax horsepower, used by the authorities to determine the level of annual car tax to be imposed on car owners. The ‚Äú55‚Äù defined the manufacturer's claims regarding car's actual power output as defined in Horsepower#Metric horsepower (PS, cv, hk, pk, ks, ch). In Germany tax horsepower, which had been defined by statute since 1906, was based on the dimensions of the cylinders in the engine. Unlike the systems used elsewhere in Europe, the German tax horsepower calculation took account both of the cylinder bore and of the cylinder stroke, and there was therefore a direct linear relationship between engine size and tax horsepower. The model was upgraded in 1927 and effectively relaunched in 1929, benefiting from the attentions of Hans Nibel who from January 1929, newly appointed as Technical Director, held sole responsibility for model development.Oswald, p. 221 The 1927 upgrade saw the car receiving a new works number, the Mercedes-Benz 12/55 PS / Typ 300 (W03) being replaced by the Mercedes-Benz 12/55 PS / Typ 300 (W04). The 1929 relaunch was accompanied by further new works number and a modified name, reflecting the increased horsepower and greater cubic capacity of the enlarged engine introduced that year, now being named the Mercedes-Benz 14/60 PS / Typ 350 (W05). In retrospect the cars are frequently referred to by company works numbers, as the Mercedes-Benz W03, Mercedes-Benz W04 and Mercedes-Benz W05: this minimises the risk of confusion with other Mercedes-Benz models with names similar to ‚ÄúMercedes-Benz Typ 300‚Äù.  Mercedes-Benz Typ 300 (W 03, 1926‚Äì1927)  The car was offered in bare chassis form for customers wishing to purchase a car body from an independent coach builder. Standard bodies from the manufacturer started with a Torpedo bodied ‚ÄúTourenwagen‚Äù and included 4-door ‚ÄùPullman- Limousine‚Äù (sedan/saloon) bodies. Bodies provided by specialist coachbuilders also included cabriolets and landaulets.Oswald, p. 223 The side-valve six- cylinder 2,968 cc engine delivered a maximum output of at 3,500 rpm which translated into a top speed of 100 km/h (62 mph). Power was transmitted via a four-speed manual transmission to the rear wheels which were fixed to a rigid axle suspended from semi-elliptic leaf springs. The braking applied to all four wheels, mechanically controlled using rod linkages.Oswald, p. 223 Like its two-litre contemporary, the Mercedes-Benz W02, the W03 failed to find as many customers as the manufacturer had hoped for, with just 205 cars sold in 1926 (which was admittedly a particularly poor year for passenger car sales in Germany).Oswald, pp. 206 & 530 The W03 was very comfortable, but it was seen as too large and heavy. Just a few months after deliveries began an upgraded model appeared in January 1927.  Mercedes-Benz Typ 300 (W 04, 1927‚Äì1928)  The upgrade in early 1927 involved a new model number, W04, although the wheelbase and gear ratios in the transmission were unchanged. The cylinder dimensions were slightly changed, giving rise to a small increase in total engine capacity to 2,994 cc. Claimed maximum output was unchanged at , but now at the lower engine speed of at 3,200 rpm. At the back, however, the final drive ratio was changed from 5.4 :1 to 4.8 : 1, and the listed top speed went up from 108 km/h (67 mph) Although sales levels improved, the volumes continued to undershoot the manufacturer's expectations, and for 1928 the W04 received a further makeover.  Mercedes-Benz Typ 320 (W 04, 1928)  Having raised the final drive and the top speed for 1927, the manufacturer now moved to offer a choice of ratios, either reducing it back to 5.4 :1 or raising it further to 5.8 :1. The former ratio was described as the ‚ÄúFlachland‚Äù (flat lands) version while the latter as the ‚ÄúBerg‚Äù (mountain) version. At the same time a small increase in the cylinder stroke accounted for an increase in overall engine capacity to 3,131 cc. Claimed maximum output was unchanged at , still at 3,200, although there was a measurable increase in torque. Claimed top speed came back down to 100 km/h (62 mph) with the ‚Äúflat-lands‚Äù final- drive ratio and 95 km/h (59 mph) with the back axle configured for mountainous areas.Oswald, p. 223 Sales volumes continued to disappoint. The manufacturer addressed the matter with a further upgrade.  Mercedes-Benz Typ 350 (W 05, 1929‚Äì1930)  The engine was enlarged further, this time to 3,444 cc, and the car received a new works number, becoming the Mercedes-Benz W05, as well as a new name in the market place, now being sold as the ‚ÄúMercedes-Benz 14/60 PS‚Äù or as the ‚ÄúMercedes-Benz Typ 350‚Äù. For the first time with this model, there was also an increase in listed maximum power, now quoted as at , still at 3,200. Gear box ratios again remained unchanged, but the rear axle ratio was now reduced to 5.0 : 1 (flat lands) version or 5.4 : 1 (mountain). This gave rise to top speeds respectively of 103 km/h (64 mph) and 100 km/h (62 mph).Oswald, p. 223 No one had really expected the latest upgrade to lead to a dramatic improvement in sales. 1929 was the last full year for the W05 car which was replaced by the W10 ‚ÄúTyp Mannheim‚Äù model, which would be built on a slightly shorter wheelbase.Oswald, pp. 221, 223 & 225 Commercial The six- cylinder sedan/saloon sector in which the Mercedes Benz W03/W04/W05 competed was crowded at a time when the number of customers who were willing and able to spend around 10,000 Marks on a car was limited. The car competed for customers with similarly sized, often significantly less expensive, models from established manufacturers, including Adler, Wanderer and Horch along with several smaller and more completely forgotten German automakers. German Market growth in the late 1920s was increasingly focused on smaller cars, and Mercedes-Benz were far from alone in being disappointed with the volumes achieved in the six-cylinder class. :Production volumes:Oswald, pp. 206‚Äì207 :1926‚Äì27: Typ 300 (W 03): 1,018 cars :1927‚Äì29: Typ 300 (W 04): 2,485 cars :1928‚Äì29: Typ 320 (W 04): 202 cars :1929‚Äì30: Typ 350 (W 05): 727 cars Sources and further reading * Werner Oswald: Mercedes-Benz Personenwagen 1886‚Äì1986. 4.

His father was a clerk in the Court of Chancery (Ireland), but this position may have been a sinecure since the Boate family were substantial landowners in Tipperary. These lands had been granted to Katherine, widow of Gerard Boate (1604-1650), author of The Natural History of Ireland; Gerard and Katherine were Godfrey's grandparents. The Boate family, originally called de Boot, came to Ireland from Gorinchem in the Netherlands in the 1640s.Gilbert, John Thomas \\"Gerard Boate\\" Dictionary of National Biography 1885-1900 Vol.5 p.284 Godfrey went to school in Dublin and attended the University of Dublin where he matriculated in 1692.Ball, F.

After a brief period as Master in Chancery he became Prime Serjeant in 1716. The following year he became third justice of the Court of King's Bench (Ireland);Ball p.194 Francis Elrington Ball, in his definitive study of the Irish judiciary before 1921, thought that Boate was unqualified to be a judge, an opinion with which Jonathan Swift, who knew and loathed Boate, would most certainly have agreed. Boate died of dropsy in the summer of 1722, apparently while visiting his wife's relatives in England.Ball p.194 He was buried in All Saints' Church, Hillesden, Buckinghamshire,Foster, Rev. A. J. Wanderings in Buckinghamshire p.23 where his memorial still exists.Hillesden manor belonged to his wife's family, the Dentons. By his wife, Cary Denton of Hillesden, Buckinghamshire, he had at least two daughters: *Lucy, who married the Rev. William Hemsworth, vicar of Birr- their descendants inherited the Boate estates in Tipperary; *Mary, who married Godfrey Clayton (who died in 1745); she died in 1772 and is buried beside her father in All Saints' Church, Hillesden.Foster p.23 Waters' case In 1720 the Crown moved against Edward Waters, the printer of Swift's Proposal for the Universal Use of Irish Manufacture. He was tried for seditious libel before a Court presided over by Boate and William Whitshed, the Lord Chief Justice of Ireland. Boate appears to have played a very minor role at the trial, as Whitshed, the senior judge, dominated the proceedings.Ball pp.96-7 Whitsed's conduct of the trial was much criticised: on no less than nine occasions he refused to accept a verdict of not guilty, claiming that Walters and Swift were part of a Jacobite conspiracy. After eleven hours the jury finally brought in a guilty verdict.Ball p.97 Swift's Elegy Swift developed a deep hatred of Chief Justice Whitshed, with whom he clashed again over the Drapier Letters, and he did not forget or forgive Boate either. Shortly after Boate's death he wrote a mocking satire, consisting largely of puns on the judge's name:Scott p.282 \\"To mournful ditties Clio, change thy note Since cruel fate hath sunk our Justice Boat...

The Palitana State was a princely state, founded in 1194. It was one of the major states in Saurashtra, covering 777 km¬≤. In 1921 it had 58,000 inhabitants in 91 villages, generating a 744,416 Rs revenue. In 1656, Shah Jahan's son Murad Baksh (the then Governor of Gujarat) granted the village of Palitana to the prominent Jain merchant Shantidas Jhaveri. The management of the temples was assigned to the Anandji Kalyanji Trust in 1730. During the British Raj, Palitana was a princely state in the Kathiawar Agency of the Bombay presidency. Gross revenue, ¬£42,000; tribute jointly to the Gaekwar of Baroda and the Nawab of Junagadh, ¬£700. The capital of the state was the Palitana town (population 12,800). It was ruled by a Gohil Rajput, with the title of Thakore sahib (also spelled Thakor Saheb or Thakur Sahib), enjoying a 9-guns salute, of the Hindu Gohel dynasty, which received a privy purse of 180,000 rupees at the state's accession to independent India on 15 February 1948. The last Thakore Sahib of Palitana was Shri Shivendrasinhji Bahadursinhji Gohel the 27th Thakore Sahib of Palitana, who got the title of His Highness after his father HH Thakore Sahib Shri Sir Bahadursinhji Mansinhji Gohel of Palitana died on 18 July 1964.

There are more than 3000 temples located on the Shatrunjaya hills, exquisitely carved in marble. The main temple on top of the hill, is dedicated to the first Tirthankara Rishabhanatha (Rishabhadeva). The temples were built by generations of Jains over a period of 900 years, from the 11th century onwards. The temples are managed by the Anandji Kalyanji Trust associated with the Kasturbhai Lalbhai group. From the foot of the hill to the top there are about 3,800 stone steps to facilitate climbing. The temples are exquisitely carved in marble, veritable prayers in stone. To an observer, these appear to be ivory miniatures when seen from a distance. Created by master craftsmen, the most important temple is that of the first teerthankara, Shri Adishwar. It has ornate architectural motifs, though in its overall plan it is simpler than the Choumukh. Other notable temples are those of Kumarpal, Vimalshah and Sampriti Raja. Kumarpal Solanki, a great Jain patron, probably built the earliest temple. The temple has a fabulous collection of jewels, and these can be seen with special permission. The temples date from 11th to the 20th century. From 1865 to 1910 it was ruled by King Dhanpat. Belief Every devout Jain aspires to climb to the top of the mountain at least once in his lifetime, because of its sanctity. Not just the temples on the Hill are sacred, but as per Jain Scriptures entire Hill is sacred right from top to bottom. The journey is arduous. The walk up the stone stairway hewn into the mountain face takes about an hour and a half. For those unable or unaccustomed to the strain, sling-chairs are available at a bargain. The code for the climbers is stringent, in keeping with the rigours of the Jain faith. Food must neither be eaten nor carried on the way. The descent must begin before it is evening, for no soul can remain atop the sacred mountain during the night.

They opened Schools of Our Lady throughout Europe. Offshoots of this order brought its mission and spirit around the globe. Let Clerc was beatified by the Catholic Church in 1947. Life Early life Alix (the local form of Alice) Le Clerc was born into a wealthy family in Remiremont in the independent Duchy of Lorraine,\\"History\\", Notre Dame Sisters part of the Holy Roman Empire. She was a vivacious girl who loved music and dancing. She would spend her evenings partying with her young friends. When she was about 18, her family moved to Mattaincourt, a manufacturing center. Conversion Three years later, a sudden illness confined her to her bed. While there, her only reading material was a devotional book. From the reading and reflection she was able to do while recuperating from her illness, Le Clerc began to feel the need for a change in her life. She approached the pastor of the town, Dom Peter Fourier, with whom she shared this growing conviction about the need for a new direction in her life, but that none of the religious orders appealed to her. A purported vision of Our Lady answered her questioning and gave her the direction she sought, as she felt called to care for the daughters of the poor of the region, who had little or no access to education. Supported in this by Fourier, who himself had seen the desperate need for this among the rural populace of his parish, Le Clerc resolved to commit her life to this goal. She was joined in this enterprise by four of her friends, with whom she established a community where they could follow lives of simplicity, prayer, and respecting the presence of God in each girl whom they would receive for instruction. Foundress On Christmas Day 1597, Le Clerc and her companions made private vows in the parish church to Fourier. The small community opened their first school the following July in Poussay, where they offered free education to the girls of the duchy. Expansion of their work developed quickly, with communities being opened in Mattaincourt (1599), Saint-Mihiel (1602), Nancy (1603), Pont-√†-Mousson (1604), Verdun, and Saint-Nicolas-de-Port (1605). All the schools took the name of Notre-Dame. Le Clerc established herself in Nancy, capital of the duchy, and devoted herself to the care of the girls who came to the schools of the new congregation. At the same time, working through major obstacles, she and Fourier developed constitutions for the new congregation through which the communities could be legally recognized by the Church and the State. The vision Le Clerc and Fourier had was one in which schools would give a free education to all, poor and rich, and all girls would be welcome, regardless of whether they were Catholic or Protestant. Additionally, the other needs of their locales would be answered, with visits to the sick and poor. They encountered resistance to this open form of life from the hierarchy, who did not look favorably on their teaching outside a cloister. In consultation with the first Sisters, especially Le Clerc, the final form of the constitutions which Fourier wrote took an innovative answer to this by allowing two ways of life to those women who wished to follow the goals of the congregation. In keeping with ancient practice, each community would be autonomous, subject to the local bishop, and would each have to seek this formal recognition on its own from the local religious authorities. The houses were to be of two forms, all following the Rule of St. Augustine, as well as the constitutions: *Those monasteries whose members who would take public vows (canonesses) and would observe full monastic enclosure, wearing the habit of the congregation. *Those monasteries whose members would take private vows (Daughters/Sisters () of the congregation) and would be free to leave the monastery with the approval of the Superiors of the house for any legitimate purpose, such as going to Confession, participating in Mass when unable to do so in the monastery, or participating in works of charity. They would not wear the religious habit of the Congregation, but instead one developed for that community. The first approval for the Constitutions came on 6 March 1617 from the Bishop of Toul, in whose territory Nancy then lay, as a result of which that became the first monastery of the congregation. Le Clerc and the members of that community professed public vows on 2 December 1618, at which time she took the religious name of Teresa of Jesus, after the great Carmelite foundress. Immediately following the ceremony, Fourier met with the assembled Superiors of the various houses and distributed copies of the approved constitutions for their study and observance. Shortly after that, the canonesses of Nancy held their first formal elections and Le Clerc was elected the prioress of the community. Le Clerc oversaw the development of the congregation as the various houses, each in their own turn, became formally recognized. For the rest of her life, she led the development of the spiritual and practical aspects of the lives of the canonesses in the various monasteries. She would visit each new community, to instill in them the spirit of their founding, saying to them, Que Dieu soit votre amour entier! (May God be your only love!), reflecting the deep spiritual life she maintained in the midst of her responsibilities in the congregation. Death and veneration Le Clerc died on 9 January 1622 at the monastery in Nancy. She was buried in the cemetery of the monastery in a lead coffin. The cause for her canonization was begun in the latter part of the century, but proceeded slowly. The monastery in Nancy was destroyed during the upheavals of the French Revolution, and the traces of the grave were lost. With the re-establishment of Catholic institutions in France in the early 19th-century, the cause was taken up again, but faced the difficulty of there being no remains, normally required during the process. Various efforts were made by a number of priests to find Le Clerc's remains in the precincts of the former cloister of the monastery over the next century, without success. Despite this obstacle, the Holy See decided to proceed with the beatification of Mother Teresa of Jesus. This was done by Pope Pius XII on 4 May 1947. =Discovery of remains= Not long after this declaration of her holiness by the Catholic Church, in 1950 a group of young students in Nancy was exploring the basement of a building in the city and found a lead coffin buried nearly 5 feet (1.5 meters) below the ground. By 1960, the remains were conclusively identified as those of Le Clerc, and were placed for veneration in the chapel of the Notre Dame School of the city. A special chapel was eventually built for the remains in the cathedral and they were transferred there on 14 October 2007, where they are available for veneration by the public. Legacy The congregation spread throughout France, into which the duchy was forcibly absorbed in the 1630s. Within thirty years of Le Clerc's death, the monastery which had been established in Troyes was instrumental in the extension of her vision to the New World. Through a connection with the governor of Fort Ville-Marie in the colony of New France, the canonesses had offered to go there to educate its children, but the governor felt that the colony was unable to support a cloistered community of teachers at that stage of its development. Instead, they recruited Marguerite Bourgeoys, the president of a sodality attached to the community, to bring this service to the colony. She went there in 1653, and within five years her work there led to the founding of the Congregation of Notre Dame of Montreal, an unenclosed institute of religious sisters with the same goal of free education for the poor. Today, they have 1,150 Sisters serving worldwide. The congregation had also spread to other regions of Europe by the time it faced a century of upheaval, starting with the French Revolution, which closed many of their houses. In central Europe, communities were scattered, moving back and forth between Germany (founded in 1640) and Bohemia. Out of this chaos, Theresa Gerhardinger, a former student of the suppressed monastery in Stadtamhof, came to found the School Sisters of Notre Dame in the Kingdom of Bavaria in 1833. It currently has 3,500 members working in over 30 countries around the world. At the time of Fourier's canonization in 1897, thirty monasteries of the congregation still functioned in Europe. Over the next decades, the congregation expanded to South America, Africa, and Asia, and they now serve in 43 nations. Their mission has expanded to include work for human rights, such as the protection of the rights of migrants and the promotion of justice for developing nations. The General Chapter of 2008 formally recognized the many groups of alumni and associates of the congregation which had sprung up around the world as full partners in the heritage of Fourier and Le Clerc.

She joined the Union of Artists of Ukraine in 1965.Poshivaylo, (1999), p. 15 Early life Halyna Zubchenko was born in Kyiv in 1929 into a family of scholars. Her father, Alexander Avksentevich Zubchenko, studied agricultural sciences and her mother, Hanna Skrypchynska, was a researcher at the Academy of Sciences of Ukraine.Poshivaylo (1999), p. 1 Career beginnings Zubchenko's first art teacher was Okhrim Kravchenko, a painter of the Boychukist school. She continued her studies at the Palace of Children's Creativity under Elizabeth Piskorska, a student of Fedir Krichevsky and Mykhailo Boychuk.Poshivaylo (1999), p. 3 From 1944 to 1949, Zubchenko attended the Republican Art School, where she took painting and drawing lessons from Vladimir Bondarenko, another disciple of Fedir Krichevsky. After secondary school, she studied at the Kyiv State Art Institute under Oleksii Shovkunenko. She graduated in 1959. In the summer of 1956, Zubchenko went to Lemkivshchyna, a region in the lowest part of the Carpathian Mountains, to practise en plein air painting.Poshivaylo (1999), p. 16 She became keenly interested in the customs of the local Hutsul community; drawing inspiration from their everyday life, she set to make studies and sketches that would become the base for her painting Arkan,The arkan is a Hutsul folk dance. completed later that year. Many years later, the painter said, \\"The Carpathians are my inner world, my dream that has come true. Since my childhood I've been living as in two different epochs: in the ancient times of Kievan Rus and in the present. I've been always so much attracted to the ancient past but I could not find what I was looking for in Kyiv. But there, in the mountains, I've discovered the spirit of ancient times ... of ancient Kyiv ... I've seen it in the way people live, in the clothes they wear, in their customs, in the way they speak.\\" Carpathian Evening In 1957, Zubchenko returned to the Carpathians, this time to Richka, a village near the River Kosovo, where she lived with a Hutsul family. There she painted various portraits and landscapes, including A Girl from the Village of Richka, Willows, Without a Musician There Would Not Be a Fest and Where the Mountain Bears Live. The following summer, she went to the village of Brustory to continue with her series of portraits. She painted Girls from the Village of Brustory (now part of a private collection in Philadelphia, United States), A Girl among Flowers, Semen Paliy, A Churchwarden, A Little Princess (now part of a private collection in Australia), Silver Evening, A Neighbour's House and many landscapes.Poshivaylo (1999), p. 17 Graduation Zubchenko decided to paint a traditional Hutsul wedding for her degree. Hutsul Wedding, a large oil on canvas, depicts a wedding procession coming down a hill; it is one of her central works, in which she reflected the experience of travelling around the Carpathians for three years.Poshivaylo, (1999), p. 18 The Kyiv State Art Institute staff found the painting overly nationalistic and compelled Zubchenko to modify it. Even though Oleksii Shovkunenko, the supervisor of her project, strove to avoid this, she had to change the background and the appearance of the main figures. Carpathian paintings Between 1959 and 1964, Zubchenko made several visits to the Carpathian Mountains and produced another series of paintings of the Ukrainian countryside and Hutsul people. Some of the works from this period are Moysyuchka, Princess Paraska, An Old Fortune Teller, Mistress of the Mountains, various portraits of men (Owner, Hutsul Nicholas, Legin) and children (Vasyuta, Vasyuta and his brother, Chichko) and the landscapes Above the Cheremosh, Clouds Walk above Verkhovyna and Dreamy Evening.Poshivaylo, (1999), pp. 21‚Äì22 Monumental art Movement, (1969).

They produced the large-scale mosaics Blooming Ukraine (1967, Zhdanov), Movement (1969, Science Sports Palace in Svyatoshino, Kyiv), Victory (1971, Institute of Oncology, Kyiv), Blacksmiths of Modernity (1974, Institute for Nuclear Research, Kyiv), Masters of Time (1975, Institute of Cybernetics, Kyiv) and The Triumph of Cybernetics (1977, Institute of Cybernetics, Kyiv). After Pryshedko's death in 1978, she continued working on monumental art designs. 1980s ‚Äì 1990s In 1981, Zubchenko made the stained glass window Spring, Summer, Autumn for the Institute of Urology in Kyiv and various mosaics for the Dubrava Health Resort in Zheleznovodsk, such as Legend of the Narty, Tales and Legends of the North Caucasus and Merry Sun. The remaining sketches and cartoons for these mosaics were transferred to the Museum of the Sixties, Kyiv, in 2010. In 1985, Zubchenko returned to the Carpathian mountains after a long time. She painted The Last Ray of Sun, Rogatynyukiv's Farm, Princess Yaroslava and Carrying Pears and Plums. Throughout the 1990s Zubchenko worked on a series of more than 100 watercolours depicting Crimean natural sceneries, some of which are in the Simferopol Art Museum and the Sevastopol Art Museum in Crimea. She also painted views of the Kyiv Monastery of the Caves and landscapes of Central Ukraine, such as Morning above the Ros. Other works from this period, including The Power of the Spirit and Our Lady of Pochayiv, are based on Christian themes. Exhibitions Zubchenko took part in several international, national and municipal expositions and organised five personal exhibitions. In 1999, the Embassy of Croatia in Ukraine invited her to stage an exhibition of her works in Zagreb. Her paintings are in the Museum of Hutsul Folk Art in Kolomyia, the Mariupol Art Gallery, the Kirovohrad Art Museum, the Ivan Honchar Museum in Kyiv, the Sevastopol Art Gallery and the Simferopol Art Museum, as well as in art galleries and private collections in the United States, Canada, Argentina, Japan, Australia, Taiwan, Germany and Croatia.

She was the Governor of Andhra Pradesh from 26 November 1985 to 7 February 1990. She was the second female Governor of the state after Sharda Mukherjee. She also became Deputy Minister of Information and Broadcasting (October 1980 - January 1982) and Deputy Minister of Health and Family Welfare (January 1982 - December 1984). Joshi was a member of the Rajya Sabha thrice, from 15 October 1973 to 2 April 1976, 3 April 1976 to 2 April 1982 and from 3 April 1982 to 25 November 1985. She was also the General Secretary, Gujarat P.C.C. Soon after taking charge, she travelled to all the state's 23 districts and often outside, to create a record of sorts - that of being more active than her 13 predecessors in Hyderabad's Raj Bhavan. Between 26 November 1985 and 30 September 1987 she travelled to the districts on 108 occasions, and outside the state 22 times. Rama Rao, the then Chief Minister and his partymen saw this as an attempt by Joshi to build a stronger base for the Congress.  Controversies  Kumudben Manishanker Joshi was under the threats from the ruling Telugu Desam Party (TDP) during her tenure in the Raj Bhawan. The campaign against her hotted up after the state Cabinet adopted a resolution criticising the \\"tenor and content\\" of her Republic Day parade speech \\"belittling the remarkable progress made by the state\\". It also asked Chief Minister N.T. Rama Rao to write to President R. Venkataraman in this regard. TDP ministers accused her of behaving like a Congress(I) agent. In her 20-minute extempore speech in Hindi, Joshi had said: \\"No state will be able to progress without the support of the Government of India in implementing development programmes.\\" She pointed out that the Central Government spent Rs 4 crore daily at the Vishakhapatnam steel project and provided a subsidy ranging from 75 paise to Re 1 for the distribution of foodgrains. Evidently, the top's charge of discrimination towards non-Congress(I) states was at the back of her mind. Forest Minister G. Muddukrishnama Naidu soon accused her of projecting only centrally-sponsored schemes and glossing over the welfare measures implemented by the state Government. According to Cooperation Minister N. Yethiraja Rao: \\"She has downgraded the office of the governor to that of a Congress(I) public relations officer.\\" Joshi reacted by granting a number of interviews to local newspapers in Hyderabad. She dismissed the charges as \\"rubbish\\" and said, \\"it is below my dignity to reply to such criticism.\\"  References  Category:Governors of Andhra Pradesh Category:1934 births Category:Indian National Congress politicians from Gujarat Category:Women state governors of India Category:Rajya Sabha members from Gujarat Category:Living people Category:Women in Gujarat politics Category:Union deputy ministers of India Category:Women in Andhra Pradesh politics Category:20th-century Indian women politicians Category:20th-century Indian politicians Category:Women union ministers of state of India ","title":"Kumudben Joshi"},{"id":"37995922","text":"Forbidden Territory is a 1934 British thriller film directed by Phil Rosen and starring Gregory Ratoff, Ronald Squire and Binnie Barnes.

Other metals were mined and worked starting in the colonial period. The working of gold and silver, especially for jewelry, initially declined after the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire. However, during the colonial period, the working of metals rose again and took on much of the character traditional goods still have. Today, important metal products include those from silver, gold, copper, iron, tin and more made into jewelry, household objects, furniture, pots, decorative objects, toys and more. Important metal working centers include Taxco for silver, Santa Clara del Cobre for copper, Celaya for tin and Zacatecas for wrought iron. History Prehispanic period Aztec gold ornament from the 16th century at the Palace of Cort√©s, Cuernavaca, Mexico Metal working in Mesoamerica, especially of silver, gold and copper was advanced by the time the Spanish arrived, mostly concentrated in the modern states of Michoac√°n, Oaxaca and Guerrero.Aprahamian, p 58 The mining and working of metals probably came to Mesoamerican cultures from the south. Metal working was principally in gold, silver, tin and lead, with some copper work known in what is now Michoac√°n.Ruiz, p.10-11Ruiz, p.106 Gold was generally obtained in powder or pellet form in rivers and streams from various sites in Guerrero, Oaxaca, Michoac√°n, the Central Highlands and the Mayan region.Ruiz, p.114Ruiz, p.12 As silver rarely appeared on the surface it was almost exclusively mined. In the pre Hispanic period, metals were used to create needles, punches, tweezers, weapons and musical instrument but its most important uses, especially gold and silver, was as jewelry for the social elite and as offerings to the gods.Ruiz, p.15 Gold and silver were worked by hammering, plating and molds the blending of these and some casting was known.Arte del Pueblo, p. 377 One pre Hispanic technique was to hammer metal flat, punch out a design and then layer this design over wood or leather, often used on shields. Silver was less used in the pre Hispanic period as it was less valued as tribute. It did not have the same divine symbolic value that gold did. The use of copper was almost exclusive to the Pur√©pecha Empire in what is now Michoac√°n when the Spanish arrived. Copper instruments included axes, hoes, scythes, punches, chisels, needles, pins, arrowheads, brooches, canes, handles, helmets, shields and small bells. Colonial period Colonial period gold/Silver book holder at the Franz Mayer Museum in Mexico City Copper cooking pot on display at the kitchen area of the old monastery of Zinacantepec, State of Mexico According to tradition, one of the first gifts that Hern√°n Cort√©s received from Moctezuma II was a pair of discs, one in gold and one in silver, which represented the sun and moon respectively. The existence of gold and silver in Mexico was one of the main attractions for the Spanish in the New World, with the conquest of the Aztec Empire and subsequent exploration with the aim of finding more of these precious metals. Mining and metal working became a main aspect of the economy of colonial Mexico.Ruiz, p.15, 22 Most of the emphasis was on the mining of gold, silver, copper, iron, lead, platinum and tin with much of the metal, especially gold, shipped to Spain.Ruiz, p.21, 54 Initially, the working of metals in the new colony was heavily restricted or outright banned for several reasons, including protection of Spanish metal guilds, the fact that the work did not contribute to royal taxes and the fear that the indigenous would make weapons.Arte del Pueblo, p. 409Aprahamian, p. 60 However, these soon became impractical to enforce with the restrictions then only to the making of objects related to indigenous religion.Ruiz, p.21, 105 The Spanish introduced new metalworking techniques, especially the promoting of copper work by Vasco de Quiroga in Michoacan and various metals by Pedro de Gante in Mexico City . and eventually indigenous craftsmen competed with European ones. Most of Mexican colonial metal work copied that in Spain, which was Gothic in style and later Renaissance. These styles eventually defined the handcraft work of areas such as Oaxaca, Zacatecas, Durango, San Luis Potos√≠ and Guanajuato .Arte del Pueblo, p. 410 However, after the Conquest, the making of jewelry in Mexico nearly disappeared, with precious metals shipped to Spain. Only after 1551, with the establishment of a Mexican upper class, did this return slowly. At first Spanish craftsmen arrived to work European methods including filigree, repouss√© and chasing, engraving and the incrustation of precious stones. But during the colonial period, these craftsmen never reached the level of their contemporaries in Europe. Indigenous craftsmen were relegated in this area to producing cheaper jewelry with lesser metals.Ruiz, p.114-118 One exception to the relative lack of precious metal work was that in silver, which became more important over the colonial period after the start of trade with Asia in the 17th century. Mexico‚Äôs abundance made silver an important form of currency and silver working guilds gained prestige and power, mostly in the creation of coins, silverware, religious medallions, crosses and liturgical items.Ruiz, p.120 Indigenous silver jewelry often became marked by the use of silver coins as decoration. Trade with the Orient introduced elements to silver pieces such as pearls (later augmented by those found in the Gulf of California), turtle shell and colored glass from Europe. The last was particularly popular with indigenous communities. One item that was important in the 18th century were cigarette and snuff cases made of both silver and gold, as the habit of using tobacco became very fashionable among the upper classes. The creation of the cases waned in the 19th as lower classes began to use tobacco as well.Ruiz, p.122 Independence to the present 19th century silver comb on display at the Allende House Museum in San Miguel Allende, Guanajuato After the Mexican War of Independence, much of Mexico metalworking continued to follow European trends, with elements added such as Mexican national symbols. Silverwork became less Baroque in nature and more secularized during the 19th century as political antagonism towards the Church grew and became more focused on items such as buttons, cane handles, pocket watches and hair decorations, incrustations as well as jewelry. The indigenous tended to keep more of the colonial era designs especially necklaces with dangling coins, glass and silver figurines, filigree.Ruiz, p.125 As mines gave out in the 19th and 20th centuries, precious metalworking declined. Traditional utilitarian iron and copper working declined due to industrialization. In the mid 20th century, a revival began in silver working in the town of Taxco, even though the area‚Äôs mines had given out. It began with the work of American artisan William Spratling, who took traditional Mexican indigenous and colonial designs and gave them new adaptations, then teaching other artisans in the area. Today, Taxco‚Äôs silverwork is one of Mexico‚Äôs important exports of finished products. Copper working, mostly for utilitarian items and home d√©cor continues in Santa Clara del Cobre, a tradition that has remained since the early colonial period. These items include bowls, plates, pitchers, vases and their quality has won awards in both Mexico and abroad. Jewelry making Artisan assembling silver necklace in Oaxaca Silver necklace with ruby, emerald and Mexican opal with two jaguars in confrontation from Guadalajara on display at the Museum of Arte Popular in Mexico City Jewelry making began well before the arrival of the Spanish, with mines providing supplies of metals and stones. The designs of modern Mexican handcrafted jewelry is a mixture of both Spanish and indigenous traditions. Indigenous designs are based on those seen in Mesoamerican codices and artifacts from archeological sites. Most of Mexico‚Äôs fine jewelry is made in silver, with the most important center being Taxco, Guerrero. A lesser known center is San Felipe del Progreso in the State of Mexico. Here traditional Mazahua jewelry has seen a revival, especially the production of earrings used for Mazahua weddings, but also bracelets and necklaces. In Guanajuato, jewelry making focuses on cast silver in colonial style often decorated with images of birds along with glass beads and pearls.Arte del Pueblo, p. 379 In P√°tzcuaro, artisans made necklaces and earrings of smooth or scratched silver, often with small dangling fish, combined with red and black porcelain beads. In Yalalag, Oaxaca they make silver necklaces with colonial era style crosses. In Huetamo and Zit√°cuaro, they made dangling earrings called arracadas of silver with images of leaves, flowers and birds. In Huazolotitl√°n, Oaxaca, they make beaded necklaces with crosses and small animals made of silver.Arte del Pueblo, p. 383 While gold jewelry making faded during the colonial period in Mexico, it is still done in a number of places such as Iguala and Taxco in Guerrero. In Ometepec, large and small crosses are made with various metals along with gold necklaces of various colors. Gold filigree is an important trade in Chiapas, often made with local amber . Fine gold and silver wire is used by craftsmen in Oaxaca, Yucat√°n, Guerrero and Chiapas to create earrings, necklaces and bracelets with intricate designs. In the Tierra Caliente region of Michoac√°n, they make a type of dangling gold earring with the name of ‚Äúsiete lunas‚Äù or seven moons. In Yucat√°n rosaries made with gold or gold plated filigree are popular often made with red and pink coral. Turtle shell jewelry is incrusted with gold and silver. Soplillos are necklaces de cuentas de oro ochavadas in Yucat√°n.Arte del Pueblo, p. 387 Fine jewelry making in Campeche tends to focus on the creation of earrings and rings with incrustations of gold and silver. Mayan influence can be seen in the large gold chains. In Quintana Roo, a type of dangling earring called an arracadas in gold are popular since the 20th century, which includes men of high social status in Mayan communities. The creation of gold and silver jewelry is very varied in Oaxaca mixed with various other materials including coral, coins, colored glass and various stones. Silver Display of silver dishes at the Franz Mayer Museum Despite down from its peak in the colonial era, Mexico is still the number one producer of silver in the world.Arte del Pueblo, p. 391 Silver pieces made in Mexico include candelabras, jars, platters, necklaces and buttons for charro outfits.Arte del Pueblo, p. 394 Traditional silver work in Mexico has its origins in the colonial period, as the metal was not particularly prized in the Mesoamerican era. Mexican silver from the colonial era to the present can be found in many museum collections around the world.Arte del Pueblo, p. 396 There are still artisans which still make silver pieces in the style of the 17th and 18th centuries. However, these kind of work tends to bring more fame than money. Globalization has affected the design of silver pieces in Mexico as much of it is exported.Arte del Pueblo, p. 396 Most Mexican silver work today is updated designs, a trend that dates from the work of William Spratling in Taxco, making Mexico again a center of export for finished pieces. The tradition continues here, with some schools that teach the trade but most smiths learn through a term of apprenticeship, often as a part of the family business.Arte del Pueblo, p. 397 Taxco has been designated a Pueblo M√°gico in part because of its silver work, and it is home to the William Spratling Museum, which has a collection of this silver work. The number of artisans who can do traditional Mexican silver work is dwindling. To help preserve the tradition, every two years the Hugo Salinas Price National Silver Prize is awarded to Mexican silversmiths in various categories. It is sponsored by the Fomento Cultural Grupo Salinas, the Secretar√≠a de Desarrollo Social (SEDESOL), the Fondo Nacional para el Fomento de las Artesan√≠as (FONART) and the Museo de Arte Popular. The purpose is to promote the craft in the country both in Mexico and abroad. Copper Copper products for sale in Santa Clara del Cobre, Michoac√°n While copper was worked in some parts of Mesoamerica, modern Mexican tradition is Spanish in origin.Arte del Pueblo, p. 416 Copper working was initially ignored by the Spanish conquistadors as they were looking for gold and silver. It was not shipped to Spain as much as the other two. Instead, it eventually became important for the creation of utilitarian items, especially domestic items such as pots and pans. Today, the center of traditional copper work in Mexico is the state of Michoac√°n, especially the municipality of Santa Clara del Cobre. One traditional hammered copper object is a large vessel in which pork fat is rendered or sugar caramelized for making candies. Every year during the month of August Santa Clara del Cobre holds a copper festival. Iron Antique iron tools and other items at the La Lagunilla Market, Mexico City Iron was not worked in the Mesoamerican period, with its mining and working introduced by the Spanish.Arte del Pueblo, p. 401 Exploration of the metal was initially banned to protect the industry in Spain, but as tools made from the metal were essential for exploration and conquest, the prohibition was soon ignored.Arte del Pueblo, p. 402 Initially the items were purely utilitarian such as tools, locks, horseshoes and tools.Arte del Pueblo, p. 414 Later in the colonial period, iron began to be used in other ways, including decorative elements in churches and mansions such as railings and balconies. The height of traditional Mexican ironworking was in the 17 and 18th centuries. Initially the main iron working centers were Puebla and Oaxaca. Oaxacan iron was exceptionally malleable and light allowing for intricate designs and tools not possible with other types of iron. Most Oaxacan iron objects date from the 17th and 18th centuries and include locks, furniture and scissors, often with intricate designs etched on them.Arte del Pueblo, p. 401-402 Iron cross on the Templo de Caridad in San Cristobal de las Casas By the end of the 18th century, there were important iron working centers in Oaxaca, Puebla, Mexico City, Guanajuato and Quer√©taro, as well as western Mexico such as Guadalajara, Zacatecas and Aguascalientes, which eventually developed its own style. Western Mexican ironwork is distinguished by oriental influence due to trade with Manila as well as the use of iron for decorative purposes on wooden objects.Arte del Pueblo, p. 406 Handcrafted wrought iron is still important in San Miguel de Allende, Leon, city of Guanajuato, Guadalajara, Teocaltiche, Jalisco, Morelia, San Felipe de los Herreros, Michoac√°n, Mexico City, Puebla and Amozoc de Mota. It is used to make garden and home furniture, lamps, chimneys and chimney tools. San Cristobal de las Casas is known for the creation of intricate crosses made of wrought iron, popular as symbols of divine protection. Tin Traditional votive painting on tin from 1911 In the colonial period, tin was worked for its functional rather than aesthetic value. It was created and sold in standard sheets, which were then cut, folded and joined to make various objects. These sheets also became a traditional base for folk ex votos. Today, tin and other sheet metals, often from industrial waste, is still used to create decorative and functional objects such as castles, churches, masks, airplane models, saints, nativity scenes, contains, mirror frames, chandeliers, lamps, trays and plates. Another important line is toys, which are painted in bright enamels, especially in Celaya and San Miguel de Allende. Other important centers include Oaxaca, Irapuato, Mexico City, Puebla, Tlaxcala and Tlaquepaque . Other metals Necklace with brass insect decoration at the Museo de Arte Popular Brass, tin and iron are used to create old fashioned lamps, decorative items for the home as well as furniture and sculptures. The creation of brass and bronze objects was introduced by the Spanish. Bronze was mostly used for the casting of church bells, some tools and decorative elements on iron railings. The indigenous adapted it to the use of small bells used in ceremonial dances. Brass was used for many different types of implements, mostly for domestic use.Arte del Pueblo, p. 410 Lead miniature figures are made for collectors although originally they are created as toys for children. They typically include soldiers, furniture, boats, machines and more in Romantic styles from the 19th century and before. Celaya makes a wide variety of miniature for doll houses including figures, furniture, and decorations. Another popular line is toy soldiers. Most pieces are made with molds, some of which date from the 19th century, then painted.Arte del Pueblo, p. 417 The main producer of handcrafted metal eating utensils is the city of Oaxaca, with fine silverware produced in Taxco. Other areas that make this are in Cualac, Ciudad Altamirano, Ayutla, and Tecpan de Galeana in Guerrero, especially blades such as utility knives and machetes.

Most of her films were romantic dramas. When asked about her writing process, she remarked to the Los Angeles Times in 1926: \\"You must think with your heart and feel with your head. When I write my scenes I try hard to progress not from one thought to another, but from one feeling to another. For the majority of people want to have their hearts excited and their minds let alone when they come into the world of low lights and soft music of a motion-picture theater.\\"Dorothy Farnum.

Background  Stephen received his undergraduate education at the San Diego State University in 1989 with a Bachelor of Science in Criminal Justice. He received his Juris Doctor 3 years later in 1992 at the California Western School of Law and was admitted to the California State Bar that same year. In 1994 he founded San Diego personal injury law firm Estey & Bomberger, LLP. with friend and longtime schoolmate Mike Bomberger.http://www.ebtrialattorneys.com/attorney/mike-bomberger/ The firm specializes in representing plaintiff's cases involving product liability, wrongful death, car accidents, premises liability and other serious injuries. Estey's practice has seen him successfully litigate against many large corporations and civil districts including the Corona-Norco Unified School District, Los Angeles County, Orange County, Kaiser Permanente, UPS, Medtronic, City of San Diego, State of California, Regents of the University of California, Ford Motor Company and McDonald's. He is most notable for his 2010 verdict where he secured a $30,000,000 verdict in the case of John Doe vs. Giarretto, the largest sexual abuse verdict ever awarded in California to a single recipient.  John Doe v. Giaretto  On August 10, 2010 a Santa Clara County jury awarded $30,000,000 dollars to a 25-year-old victim of sexual abuse in John Doe v. Giaretto. The jury decided on the verdict in a day after a two-and-a-half-week trial. The case is one of the largest sexual abuse verdicts in the entire United States and the largest verdicts ever awarded for sexual abuse to a single recipient in California. The victim, referred to as John Doe for privacy, was 11 when he was sexually abused over 600 times between December 1995 and March 1999 in the home of Mountain Valley foster parent John Hardy Jackson. Estey sued San Jose company Giarerretto Institute for failing to perform a preliminary background check on Jackson and ignoring the allegations of sexual abuse. The children were forced to engage in sexual acts amongst each other while Jackson filmed and watched, were forced to have sexual intercourse with Jackson and were forced to make cocktails and were occasionally beaten, according to the children. Preliminary checks on the Mountain View resident revealed a troubling history of sexual acts with minors, drug and alcohol abuse, physical abuse towards his pregnant wife and a history of mental illness. Jackson was divorced by his first wife when she found him fondling their then 1-year-old son. The jury found the Giarerretto Institute 75% responsible for the damages for failing to monitor the safety of the Mountain View home. Jackson was found guilty and was indicted with a 220-year prison sentence. EMQ Children & Family Services acquired Giarretto in March 1999 and released a public statement announcing they were, \\"unaware of any claims against Giarretto at the time of acquisition\\". Following the lawsuit, Santa Clara County reclaimed control over the foster care system and no longer outsourced foster care to private companies. \\"This case was not only about Mr. Doe but about the safety of all the children in the foster care system in Santa Clara\\", Estey explained.

The role was played by Patricia Roe from July 1968 until March 1972, and by Alice Hirson from March 1972 until the character's last appearance in May 1976. Background and storyline Introduced as a supporting character to older sister to protagonist Joe Riley (Lee Patterson), Eileen Riley Siegel (Roe) is an Irish Catholic married to Jewish lawyer Dave Siegel (Allen Miller) featured in one of the first interfaith marriages on American soap operas. When Joe initially marries media heiress and lead protagonist Victoria Lord (Gillian Spencer, Erika Slezak after 1971) in June 1969, the Siegels' twin children, Julie Siegel (Lee Warwick) and Tim Siegel (Bill Fowler, William Cox), premiere on the series. David serves as the primary legal counsel for dynamic characters on the series, and Eileen as the familial confidante of Joe. While on a reporting assignment in California for The Banner in September 1970, journalist Joe is presumed dead after his car drives over a cliff and his body goes missing. Joe's widow Victoria Lord Riley (Slezak) declares him legally dead and begins dating Steve Burke (Bernard Grant) in 1971, to Eileen's grief as she held out hope her brother survived the crash. Victoria marries Steve in 1972, and Joe reappears in Llanview soon thereafter. The reappearance of Joe delights his sister (Hirson), but leaves Victoria dismayed at her possible bigamy. Victoria and Joe's marriage is dissolved at his legal 1970 death date. Joe and Victoria eventually remarry in September 1974. Dave dies of a heart attack in December 1972, and Eileen copes by abusing painkillers in 1973. Eventually she seeks treatment from Dr. Dorian Cramer (Nancy Pinkerton). Julie's husband Dr. Mark Toland (Tom Lee Jones) carries on an extramarital affair with Dorian, unbeknownst to Julie (Leonie Norton after 1974). Eileen briefly romances Ben Farmer (Rod Browning), whose wife Rachel Wilson Farmer (Nancy Barrett) dies because of a hospital mishap involving Dorian and Mark. Julie strongly objects to Eileen dating anyone, and demands she remain utterly devoted to the memory of David. Julie goes so far as trying to seduce Ben in order to break up her mother's relationship with him. Eileen's son Tim (Tom Berenger) returns to Llanview a law school dropout in 1975, leaving Eileen shocked. He becomes a construction worker and betroths Jenny Wolek (Katherine Glass). Eileen disapproves of the speed of the engagement and persuades him to postpone rushed nuptials. Tim suffers an accident in a fight with Vince Wolek (Jordan Charney) in 1976 that leaves him gravely injured, and he marries Jenny shortly before dying that April. Mourning Tim, the mother and daughter widows Eileen and Julie leave Llanview for Florida in May 1976.

They feature stainless steel ported barrels and aluminum or titanium alloy frames. They also hold two extra rounds in the grip. The name comes from the double tap shooting technique in which two rounds are quickly fired before engaging the next target. Heizer Defense, the original manufacturer, has stated that they drew inspiration from the FP-45 Liberator pistol which was designed for use in France by the resistance against the Germans during World War II. Design The DoubleTap is unique in that it carries two chambered rounds, one in each barrel. It also carries two additional rounds (on 2 round Bianchi Speed Strips) in the grip which allow for reloading. The ambidextrous thumb latch releases the action but does not have ejectors, the spent rounds have to be manually removed if they do not fall free so that the two backup rounds can be loaded. The weapon features a patent pending double-action ball bearing trigger system. Additional features include a lightweight frame made of either titanium or aluminum and a hammer- less, no-snag design that make the DoubleTap easy carry and draw from a pant pocket, and also allows it to be fired through a coat or jacket pocket.  Production  The DoubleTap was originally marketed under the name Heizer DoubleTap but in October 2012 DoubleTap Defense announced that they were looking for a new partner to manufacture the pistol. In a statement released on November 7, Heizer Defense stated that the business relationship with the creators of the DoubleTap had never materialized as the economics proposed \\"did not forecast a successful business relationship.\\" A month later, it was announced that Azimuth Technology in Naples, Florida had been selected to manufacture the pistol.

It was their first release with session drummer Mario Fabre, who replaced long-standing member Charles Gavin in 2010. The album was released on CD, DVD and Blu-ray formats, and fans could acquire signed copies at a sign session promoted by the band at Livraria Cultura, in S√£o Paulo. The DVD images are all in black & white, with some of the footage taken among the crowd, and with little technical apparel. The DVD and CD together sold 25,000 copies, as of March 2013. In 2013, with this album, Tit√£s was nominated for a Pr√™mio da M√∫sica Brasileira Award, in the category Best Pop/Rock/Reggae/Hip hop/Funk Group. The band started to perform the album live after an invitation from cultural center Sesc Belemzinho, in S√£o Paulo, for them to take part in the Projeto √Ålbum (Project Album), which aims to revisit albums considered to be anthological. They initially had no intention of revisiting the album - something they considered to be \\"a gringo fashion\\" - but since the seven shows they did sold out real quick, they saw a potential in recording it.

Thomas announced his intention to release the magazine, stating that he had begun to plan for the magazine upon hearing of Nintendo Power's cancellation. The magazine includes staff members from Destructoid, GoNintendo, IGN, Nintendojo, 1UP.com, and the writer and founder of the online comic Brawl in the Family, and Nintendo World Report, among others. Its first issue was released January 11, 2013, hosted under HP's MagCloud service with a price of $17.99 for one print/digital issue and $4.99 for just a digital copy. The debut issue had 80 pages, including a review of Fire Emblem: Awakening and a preview of Luigi's Mansion: Dark Moon as its main overview.  Overview and design  NF Magazine was created with the intention of \\"continuing the legacy\\" of Nintendo's official Nintendo Power magazine after its cancellation in 2012 after 24 years. It focuses primarily on news, reviews, and previews of the latest Nintendo games, as well as interviews with people in the gaming industry. NF Magazine's design is similar to Nintendo Power, including some of the same sections that were a staple in Nintendo Power. The two magazines have many differences, however, both aesthetically and content-wise. Force has a larger section on retro games, and also includes many full-color comics, a feature Nintendo Power used less often in its later issues.  Main sections  = Features =  Inbox  The Inbox section is where fan art and letters sent to the editors are featured. There are also polls and reader response letters, very similar to Nintendo Power's Pulse section. A column on the second page entitled Don't Anger the Ox serves as a throwback to Power's \\"Don't Hassle the Hoff\\", which spotlights editor David Oxford's response to a single letter. The new section with the Ox is much tamer than the original Hoff section in Nintendo Power.  News  The News section provides information on recently announced Nintendo-related games and products, as well as some of the editors' reactions to the news in the form of their Mii characters' speech bubbles. It contains the same \\"Collector's Corner\\" as was featured in Nintendo Power's \\"Power Up\\" section, spotlighting video game- related merchandise. It also includes a throwback to Nintendo Power's \\"A Winner Is.../Dodongo Dislikes...\\" column in the form of \\"Yeah!/Unyeah...\\" (a nod to Nintendo's Miiverse), which highlights brief highs and lows in the gaming industry.  Download  The Download section provides information on recently released and upcoming digital releases for games and apps on the Nintendo eShop. In the first issue, there was an interview with Jools Watsham of Renegade Kid. It also contains short reviews of digital games with a recommendation grade. Around their third issue, NF Magazine changed the Recommended/Not Recommend rating system to the score increments used in the Review Section. The highest rated games so far are Earthbound, Super Mario Brothers 2, and The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past, each scored a perfect 10.  Comic Break  Throughout the magazine, there are two or three comics per issue related to Nintendo games, including one by webcomic Brawl in the Family's artist Matthew Taranto.  Previews  The Previews section has information on upcoming games spread throughout pages accompanied by numerous screenshots and artwork.  Retro  The Retro section takes a look at older video games in the industry, such as those for the Nintendo Entertainment System and the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. It also features the same \\"Star Power\\" column as was featured in Nintendo Power's \\"Power Up\\" section, spotlighting a video game character.  Reviews  A section where staff writers review the latest games. The games are rated on a scale of 1‚Äì10 with increments of .5. The highest rated games so far using this system are The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, and Super Smash Bros. for Wii U, each with a perfect 10. Currently the only Games with a 9.5 are Luigi's Mansion: Dark Moon, Mario & Luigi: Dream Team, and Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze. The games with a 9.0 are Fire Emblem Awakening, Etrian Odyssey IV: Legends of the Titan and Animal Crossing: New Leaf. Among the worst games are Sonic & All-Stars Racing Transformed for Nintendo 3DS, which got a 4.5, and Wreck-It Ralph for Wii, which got a 3.0.  Community  The Community section is dedicated to Nintendo culture, covering Nintendo-related art, cosplay, and websites from fans.

As a result, his work includes traditional graffiti, digital media, and conceptual artwork. Works AI portraiture Exhibited as part of a 2017 solo show titled AI Criminals, KATSU's portraiture series consists of a generative adversarial network built using Google's TensorFlow machine learning library and trained using vintage black and white mug shots scraped from the web, to output unique portraits. The pieces explore themes of inherent bias in algorithms, Wired Magazine notes that \\"there's more to AI portraits in KATSU's view, than just a comment on the growing power of technology‚Äîit's a warning about humanity's lack of control over what these tools can build\\". Drone painting Graffiti Drone created by KATSU After experimentation with quadcopter drones and in collaboration with FAT Lab member, Becky Stern, KATSU developed a prototype mountable remote sprayer- the resultant device was dubbed the Graffiti Drone. A press release from The Hole Gallery the described the process of its refinement as testing with \\"weight of the paint, the straw for the sprayer, the sensor for the can activation, the flight of the drone and different paint and surfaces\\". Commenting on the significance of the work the artist explains that \\"drones are becoming this extension of human beings in the same way that we're growing so close to our smartphones and devices...It's really exciting to see and understand and think about what it means that many of the aesthetic decisions in these paintings are not my decisions. They're these collaborative decisions with this technology\\". On April 30, 2015 it was reported that KATSU had used his Graffiti Drone to vandalize a Soho billboard approximately six stories tall. A video of the Calvin Klein advertisement featuring model Kendall Jenner being defaced went viral on YouTube. Citing the quadcopter as \\"Graffiti Drone 1.0\\" the act was described as proof of concept demonstrating the potential that drones have to transform graffiti. Dronescapes Dronescapes are a series of abstract paintings created using the graffiti drone described as \\"robot- controlled versions of Impressionist paintings\\". Android selfies Android Selfies are a triptych of monochrome oil paintings of a Series 800 Terminator Android taking selfies at Mount Rushmore, the Pyramids of Giza and the Moon. Icarus One Wired Magazine reported KATSU's plans to make the design for his graffiti drone Open Source, \\"so other artists can experiment with its possibilities\\". The plans for the Graffiti Drone, subsequently named ICARUS ONE were released on an independent website licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution. Shitheads Shitheads is triptych of portraits of Mark Zuckerberg, Eric Schmidt, and a Springer Spaniel dog created using the artist's feces as pigment. Vice magazine placed the piece in a lineage of artists using human waste in their work, calling Shitheads \\"the Digital Era's Piss Christ\\". Digital graffiti Through his digital projects \\"KATSU easily dupes audiences while questioning the nuances that separate reality and fiction‚Äîhe also looks at the notion that graffiti doesn't have to be a physical product, instead it can exist purely digitally\\". In 2010 two doctored videos of the artist surfaced on YouTube- the first showing KATSU tagging in front of the White House and the second, of him tagging Picasso's \\"Girl Before a Mirror\\" at the MoMA. Both brought widespread speculation about their authenticity and validity. In a later interview KATSU spoke of the videos saying the digital pieces \\"themselves are tags just in the form of video, and found on the internet\\" and were intended to \\"get graffiti writers to rethink the method[s] one could use in getting notoriety\\". Blending graffiti and digital technology, his film The Powers of KATSU, the title referencing Charles and Ray Eames classic film Powers of Ten, in which he reproduces his skull tag from the scale of 1/20 of an inch, a grain of rice, to 120 feet, a New York rooftop ‚Äì and an image visible from Google Earth. The video was later shortlisted for the Guggenheim Museum's YouTube Play Show Fat Tag iPhone application KATSU has previously collaborated with Graffiti Research Lab, a collective of technologists, artists and hackers. He is currently a research fellow at the Free Art and Technology Lab where, along with artist and programmer Theo Watson, he developed the iPhone app Fat Tag Graffiti Deluxe- KATSU Edition. Phone Booth and Wild Posting campaigns KATSU Phonebooth TakeoverIn April 2011 KATSU took over approximately 100 phone booths around New York City, replacing the advertisements with his own posters featuring celebrities and the logos of prominent corporations and institutions such as the MoMA and Apple. As part of a Free Art and Technology Lab exhibition at Eyebeam, in 2013 the artist executed a wild posting campaign in New York City featuring an image of Mark Zuckerberg, photoshopped with a black eye, around New York City. Later commenting on it, KATSU responded \\"We're at the fork in the road with the web. It is being understood as a fundamental part of our evolution as a species. There are some that are fighting to protect privacy, anonymity and freedom and those who are trying to control, monitor and make profits. I want to let people know my beliefs.\\" MOCA Tag controversy and fire extinguisher graffiti Mixed Media Installation, KATSU x Ari Marcopoulos In April 2011, days before the opening of the show \\"Art in the Street\\" curated by Jeffrey Deitch, KATSU executed an extinguisher tag on the facade of The Geffen Contemporary at MOCA. The show was already under media scrutiny for being a \\"thoroughly sanitized history of graffiti and street art\\" as a result the event received wide media attention with the original YouTube video of the piece going viral. KATSU has since said that the tag was an \\"attempt to test Jeffrey Deitch's motives\\". The piece was placed on a wall initially intended for Os G√™meos but was later painted over, despite reported efforts by artists Neckface, Barry McGee and Shepard Fairey to leave it be for the duration of the event, to make room for a tribute to graffiti artist Blade. Katsu continued to experiment with the medium and in January 2013 several buildings around Detroit, MI were reported to have been vandalized with large scribbles that appeared to be made with paint and enamel filled fire extinguishers. These were attributed to him after three large \\"KATSU\\" tags carried out with similar customized fire extinguishers appeared in the area shortly after. Graffiti Artist KATSU with photographer Ari Marcopoulos KATSU also executed a fire extinguisher piece on the facade of Eyebeam Art and Technology Center as part of the F.A.T. GOLD retrospective. Working in collaboration with photographer Ari Marcopoulos KATSU took over a vacant lot in Williamsburg, Brooklyn creating a mixed media extinguisher piece. Produced by Art publisher Dashwood, Marcopoulos and KATSU released a book documenting the piece, 6‚Äì23 '13 ‚Äì N6 Street ‚Äì Brooklyn, in 2014. Participatory art KATSU encourages the public to become participants and not just observers, by using his works as canvas for their own graffiti efforts.

The vehicle suffered major damage while the aircraft had damage to a tire. Three investigations were launched into the incident. The cause was found to be errors by Air Traffic Control. Aircraft The aircraft involved was a Boeing 747-4R7F (SCD) LX-OCV, c/n 29731, line number 1222. The aircraft first flew on 25 June 1999 and was delivered to Cargolux on 13 July 1999. History Flight 7933 departed Hong Kong International Airport on 20 January 2010 bound for Luxembourg Findel Airport via Heydar Aliyev International Airport, Baku, Azerbaijan and Barcelona‚ÄìEl Prat Airport, Barcelona, Spain. On the final leg, there were two crew and one passenger on board. On arrival at Luxembourg the aircraft was cleared to land on Findel Airport's runway 24. The weather at the time was foggy, with visibility reduced to and a runway visual range of . At 12:53 local time (11:53 UTC), one of the aircraft's tires came into contact with the roof of a van which was on the runway while maintenance of the runway lighting was performed. The driver of the van was shocked as a result of the collision. The van was severely damaged, with the roof pushed in and a lighting bar destroyed. A tyre on the aircraft was also damaged. On 9 February 2010, disciplinary action was started against the controllers on duty at the time the incident occurred. The need for the van to be on the runway at a time of low visibility is also being investigated. Investigation Luxembourg's Ministry of transport stated that three investigations into the incident had been launched. It did not state whether the van had permission to be on the active runway or not. The investigations are being carried out by Luxembourg's Administration Des Enqu√™tes Techniques, Directorate of Civil Aviation and Administration of Air Navigation (AET). A preliminary report revealed that the van had been given permission to be on the active runway. The clearance had been issued before Flight 7933 started its approach. Flight 7933 also had permission to land on the runway that the van was on. Representatives from the NTSB and the Association Luxembourgeoise des Pilotes de Ligne assisted the AET in their investigation. The event was initially classed by the AET as an accident but was downgraded to a serious incident as the damage to the aircraft involved was not structural. The AETs final report into the incident was released on 10 December 2012. The report revealed that the cause of the incident was errors by Air Traffic Control (ATC). The van had been instructed to vacate the runway but ATC had failed to confirm that the instruction had been received and executed before giving the aircraft permission to land. The van and aircraft were using different radio frequencies and therefore each was unaware of the other. A failure to use standard radio phraseology was found to have been a contributory factor in the incident. The van had been seen by the crew just before they landed but it was assessed that a collision would still have occurred had a go-around been initiated. Twelve recommendations were made in the AETs final report. These included the installation of equipment that was capable of recording ATC communications with at least the previous 24 hours recordings being retained.

Located along the Green River in Butler County, this shell midden has been declared a historic site because of its archaeological value. Geography The Carlson Annis Shell Mound sits on the eastern side of the Green River, somewhat more than east of the shoreline. Because it lies in the river's floodplain, the mound is the highest point in the area; its top is typically dry even though the surrounding terrain be flooded. It occupies a dark loamy soil, although the edges of the mound are covered by a substantially lighter loam with mixtures of sand and clay.Webb, William S. \\"The Carlson Annis Mound: Site 5 Butler County Kentucky\\". University of Kentucky Reports in Anthropology 7.4 (1950): 265-354. Since the mound was formed, the river has changed its course; it appears to have flowed directly by the base of the mound as it was being created. When the area was first settled in the early nineteenth century, the floodplain was recognized as valuable farmland, and because the mound is an island during floods, settlers saw it as a place of refuge; for most of the time since whites arrived, farmsteads have occupied its summit. Measuring approximately from north to south and east to west, the mound rises approximately above the surrounding terrain. The shells extend down from the surface by from the center; the difference between the heights is the result of floods since the midden was created, which have deposited multiple layers of earth around the base. Excavation In 1939, archaeologists from the University of Kentucky began to excavate the Annis Mound under the leadership of W.D. Funkhouser and W.S. Webb. Initial surveys found minimal damage to the site: a well had been dug into the center, and the surface was slightly affected by the foundations of buildings on the top, and neighbors from miles around were frequently digging from the edge to procure shells for use as chicken feed. Excavations began with the digging of a trench through the southern portion of the mound, after which the mound was divided into blocks of so that the locations of artifacts could more accurately be plotted on diagrams. The initial excavation produced evidence of 129 different features: *Hearths ‚Äî 71 *Fire basins ‚Äî 21 *Burned clay patches ‚Äî 4 *Pits ‚Äî 12 *Caches of stone tools ‚Äî 10 *Caches of lithic flakes ‚Äî 8 *Caches of other objects ‚Äî 3 This concentration of features was comparable to what had previously been found at other Archaic period shell middens in the region, demonstrating the similarity of the builders to other regional peoples: they lived in the vicinity, ate substantial numbers of shellfish, used the site as a trash heap for the shells, and buried their dead in the midden. Beside 390 human bodies, the site produced the skeletons of 28 dogs that showed evidence of having been buried. Many of the bones at the site were substantially decomposed, so the painstaking osteological research undertaken at the comparable Indian Knoll site (15 OH 2) could not be repeated at Carlson Annis. Nevertheless, some information could be determined from certain bodies: ages ranged from infancy well into adulthood, more than half of the bodies (215) were accompanied by artifacts ‚Äî of which 73% were matters of personal clothing, such as shell gorgets, beads, or hairpains ‚Äî and some of the bodies were clearly those of victims of violence, such as a group of four that were buried together with projectile points embedded in some of the bones. While earlier publications' analyses were based largely on the presence of these embedded projectile points, more recent scholars have found evidence that bodies were injured in other fashions, such as by clubbing, and injuries that produce no effect upon the skeleton may also have been responsible for some of the deaths. Studies of other sites in the region suggest that some resources were plentiful enough to permit populations to double approximately every thirty years; this likely would have produced competition for other resources, leading to warfare.Prufer, Olaf H., et al. Archaic Transitions in Ohio & Kentucky Prehistory. Kent: Kent State UP, 2001. Overall life expectancy at birth was somewhat more than twenty years; 29.7% of the skeletons were of children under five years of age, of which nearly three-quarters were infants, although examination of these skeletons produced no evidence of violence. Beside bodies and objects associated with them, the excavation found a total of 19,733 artifacts, which were made from the following materials: *Flint ‚Äî 4,228 *Ground stone ‚Äî 977 *Copper ‚Äî 2 *Bone ‚Äî 3,523 *Antler ‚Äî 1,324 *Shell ‚Äî 9,679 Additionally, the top of the mound produced 65 sherds of prehistoric pottery. As the Archaic peoples who inhabited the site have shown no evidence of producing their own pottery, these sherds are believed to have been the work of later peoples. Strengthening this proposal was the presence of Euro- American pottery in addition to the 65 sherds ‚Äî Euro-Americans are known to have used the site because of its high location above floodwaters, and it is believed that later prehistoric peoples likewise camped at the site and would have left behind occasional broken pieces of pottery. Of the 4,000+ flint pieces found at the site, nearly half (1,997) were projectile points of various sorts, with corner-notched and long-shallow-notched shapes being the most common. Other types of flint stone tools included approximately 500 knives, 23 lithic cores, more than 500 drills, and approximately 1,000 scrapers. Artifacts of ground stone included almost fifty axes, seventy atlatl weights, more than one hundred mauls, more than one hundred sandstone discs, more than two hundred hammerstones, and nearly three hundred pestles. The two copper pieces were one bead and one awl, while the bone artifacts comprised over 1,000 awls, 900 fishhooks, occasional projectile points and flakers, and even occasional human bones that had been converted into tools. Most of the antler pieces were projectile points or pieces of unknown purpose, while nearly all of the shells were discs that were being used as beads. Aside from the numerous bits of pottery produced by whites, most of the potsherds found at Annis were grit- or shell-tempered pieces. Although Carlston Annis and many other Green River shell middens were test excavated in the 1920s, much more extensive work was performed in the 1930s. Between 1937 and 1941, extensive information was revealed by excavations conducted by Works Progress Administration workers between 1937 and 1941.Hockensmith, Charles D., et al. '. National Park Service, 1985-08-23. Conclusions Radiocarbon dating has suggested that some artifacts at Carlston Annis date back to 5424 BC, although most artifacts dated between 3200 and 1400 BC. Most of its projectile points clearly dated from the Archaic period, although one Adena and occasional Mississippian points were found; they seemingly were left by later peoples, just like the pottery pieces. Two projectile points that were found underneath the mound were fluted points from the Paleoindian period; they are believed to have been sitting on the riverside before the shell mound was started. Like several other shell mound sites in Kentucky, Carlston Annis produced pieces of three stone pipes and of a single stone cup; these objects may have been religious artifacts used by shamans in attempts to heal diseases. Kentucky's larger riverine Archaic sites vary widely in the amount of shell refuse that they have yielded; the much larger amount of shell refuse at sites such as Carlston-Annis and Indian Knoll is seemingly due to the presence of nearby bivalve beds. The numbers and types of non-human bones at the mound were typical of Archaic shell middens in the region, as was the number of antler pieces, although tools made of human bone were unusually numerous. At least three different processes were used to produce fishhooks from bones: some had been made from deer toes; some from bird bones of all sizes, a technique common at Kentucky shell middens; and a few by drilling large bones. Carlston Annis was the first Kentucky shell midden at which fishhooks made by this technique were found, although evidence of this technique is plentiful at the later Fort Ancient-period Madisonville Site near Cincinnati. Numerous animal bones appear to have been used as ceremonial \\"medicine bags,\\" which in later centuries were often made by skinning an animal without removing some of the bones. The diets of Archaic peoples at many Green River sites has been determined largely from incomplete excavation data at better-known sites, such as Carlston Annis. It appears that the inhabitants' floral diets rested almost completely on nuts, with hickory nuts dominating; both Carlston-Annis and the Bowles Site in Ohio County produced evidence suggesting that 80% of identifiable floral remains were hickory nuts, and 85% of the remnant was acorns. Some evidence exists at these sites for plants such as squash, little barley, and wild rice. Analysis of the burials at Carlston-Annis and other Green River sites demonstrates that the inhabitants' demographics were similar to those of comparable sites elsewhere and to those of modern hunter-gatherer societies. Besides methods of producing fishhooks, Archaic technology can be seen from Carlston Annis in the atlatl components. No direct evidence of specific techniques was apparent from this excavation, but substantial circumstantial evidence was present. Because very few burials were accompanied by stone atlatls, it is believed that many individuals were also buried with wooden atlatls (comparable to modern Eskimo technology) that have not survived to the present. Comparison with Indian Knoll suggests that early inhabitants at Annis used all-wooden atlatls more commonly than the Indian Knoll people. Preservation In April 1986, the Carlston Annis Shell Mound was listed on the National Register of Historic Places because of its archaeological importance. It was one of twenty-four shell middens along the Green River known together as the \\"Green River Shell Middens of Kentucky\\" that were listed on the National Register together. Eight years later, some of the Green River middens were named a historic district, the Green River Shell Middens Archeological District, and designated a National Historic Landmark.Green River Shell Middens Archeological District , National Park Service, 2006.

The foremost example of an akrafena is the Mponponson (meaning \\"responsibility\\"), which belonged to Opoku Ware II. It has survived to the present day because it is still occasionally used in ceremonies, such as the Odwira festival. The expert use of akrafena is also a martial art, utilising the blade in conjunction with knives, improvised weapons, street-fighting, hand-to-hand combat, joint locks, grappling and weapon disarming techniques. The akrafena martial art is the national sport of the Ashanti City-State. Design The sword has three parts: a blade, usually made of some metal such as iron; a hilt of carved wood or metal; and the sheath, usually made of animal hide. The blade in ritual swords may not have a sharp cutting edge. It often has incised lines or Ashanti symbolic designs on it, which evoke specific messages. Some swords have double (afenata) or triple (mfenasa) blades. The hilt may be wrapped with gold leaf with various Ashanti symbols worked onto it. The hilt itself may be carved to encode an Ashanti symbol. The sheath may carry an embossment (abosodee) that comprises Ashanti symbols meant to evoke certain expressive messages. The mpomponsuo (responsibility) sword of the Asantehene, for example, has an embossment of a coiled snake with a bird in its mouth. This conveys the Ashanti message: the puff adder that cannot fly has caught the hornbill that flies. This is used to symbolize patience, prudence, and circumspection.  Types  The Ashanti Akrafena Traditionally there are about five types of Ashanti swords with some better known than others. There are two main types of swords in the regalia of the Ashanti-Akan chief: Afenatene (Long sword) and the Short sword. The Afenatene usually does not have a sheath. It is, however, topped by an Ashanti Adinkra symbol. The short sword may be used as Akrafena or Nsuaefena (also known as Akrafena).Collins and Burns (2007), p. 140. Akrafena: The Akrafena is used in wars, and in conjunction with an Ashanti stool blackening ceremony; The Akrafena may be carried by the king's emissaries on Ashanti City-State diplomatic missions. In such situations, the meaning associated with the Ashanti Adinkra symbol embossed on the sheath conveys the message of the mission. Nsuaefena: The Nsuaefena is used in the Ashanti City-State political ceremony of taking the oath of office by the king and in swearing oath of allegiance by the subjects to the Ashanti emperor-king Asantehene. Afenatene: is used by Ashantis to penetrate the Ashanti war opponents hearts. The Blade of an Afenatene sword shows the akoma (heart), denkyem (crocodile), akuma (axe) and the sankofa. Afenanta: The Afenanta is a \\"Double Blade Sword\\" used by the Ashantis for cutting human ligaments during an Ashanti war. The Afenanta has the Ashanti denkyem and sankofa symbols embroidered onto the blades. Mpomponsuo: The Mpomponsuo sword symbolizes; Responsibility, Power, Loyalty, Bravery, and Authority. The Mpomponsuo sword is used by the Asantehene in taking the oath of office. The other Ashanti amanhene use the Mpomponsuo sword to swear the oath of allegiance to the Asantehene. The Mpomponsuo sword is one of the four principal state swords of Ashanti City- State. The Asantehene sword was created by Asantehene Nana Opoku Ware I (r. 1731 ‚Äì 1742), and is the foremost example of Akrafena.  Akrafena as weapons  History = Bonoman Kingdom (10th century AD) and the Ashanti Empire States (13th century AD to 21st century) = Ashanti self-defense Afenatene during Ashanti wars. Part of Ashanti weaponry used during ancient Ashanti wars Bonoman long swords were used primarily by Ashanti cavalry and commanders, not infantry during the 10th to 15th centuries. In the 16th century and at the time of Denkyira, Akyem and Akwamu land warfare consisted mostly of spearmen and bowmen on foot, mounted archers using two-handed bows, and mounted swordsmen with two-handed swords (twin blades). Ashanti Swords were not a primary weapon for all Ashanti combat but were mostly for Ashanti shock attacks, defensive strokes and close combat. Blades were heavy as they were made of bronze and later iron, and pommels were often knobbed and used as balances. Short swords may have been used in follow-up attacks, as short sword carriers were armoured completely and accompanied with a shield. Ashanti Akrafena Swords with wooden or metal pommels decorated with beaten gold have featured in Ashanti court regalia since the 17th century AD. Ashanti Swords were used during Ashanti wars since the 17th century. The Ashantis were engaged in a series of military conflicts from the 18th century AD, between Ashanti City-State military forces and African states and European states up until the 20th century. In the 21st century, the Ashanti Swords are primarily by Ashantis for self-defense, and the Ashanti Akrafena (Ashanti Sword of war) is primarily used for Ashanti warfare and land warfare. During the Empire of Ashanti period, Ashanti swords also had ranks (hierarchy) depending on who wielded them and what their purpose was. The highest ranking of these swords was known as the Mpomponsuo, literally meaning \\"responsibility sword.\\" Only two such swords existed and were wielded by the King's two bodyguards, who always stood on either side of him and held the nobility title of Ankobia. =Ashanti swords and shields of war (twenty-first century): changing needs and tactics= The Ashanti Akrafena (Sword of my Soul) was generally held in the hand by Ashanti Asafos. There was no real reason to hold it on their sides. However, they did strap it to their back at times when they were traveling through the rain-forest regions of Ashanti City-State or using other weapons such as spears and bows. The Ashanti sword was first and foremost one- handed, though for more powerful strikes, two hands were used. The Ashanti techniques were generally hand and a half. Akrafena as an Ashanti national symbol Ashanti Akrafena (Sword) century The Akrafena also an Ashanti national symbol, adopted by Ashanti City- State's emperor-king Asantehene Opoku Ware I in 1723. In this context it is known as Akofena.Symbols of Ashanti: AkofenaAshanti Community, Society, History and Culture Heraldic description Ashanti Akrafena (Sword) ‚Äì 20th century The Blazon: The akrafena is used in conjunction with the stool blackening ceremony. Nsuaefena is used in the political ceremony of taking the oath of office by the king and in the swearing oaths of allegiance by subjects of Ashanti City-State.

The Ashanti national symbol Akrafena description: * The Akrafena is a prominent symbol of the Ashantis in the 18th, 19th and 20th centuries into the 21st century; The Akrafena as an Ashanti national symbol has the escutcheon meaning; Akrafena (\\"Symbol of courage, valor, and heroism\\"). History The Ashanti Akrafena sword as an Ashanti City-State national symbol was used by the Asantehene in taking the oath of office as ruler of Ashanti City-State. The Omanhene used the Ashanti Akrafena sword to swear the oath of allegiance to the Asantehene and Ashanti City-State. The Ashanti Akrafena sword is one of the four principal state swords of the Ashanti City-State. The first Ashanti Akfrafena sword was created by Asantehene Nana Opoku Ware I (r. 1731 ‚Äì 1742), and is the foremost example of Akrafena. The mpomponsuo sword symbolizes Responsibility, Power, Loyalty, Bravery, and Authority.  Akrafena as martial art  There are Ashanti City-State schools that hold the techniques of these swords practitioners in the past. The schools hold the genuine Ashanti Swords techniques.Davidson (1991), p. 242. It is said that there were 20 fighting postures in training; The Ashanti people practitioners of the past generally used low kicking techniques to distract, dismantle and disable the opponent when holding the sword in one hand and sheath in the other. The sword-based fighting techniques is similar in part to that of Eskrima and the combat hand- techniques and kicking techniques is similar in part to that of Wing Chun.  Akrafokonmu (Ashanti Shield of war)  thumbleft220pxAshanti Akrafokonmu \\\\---- The Ashantis Shield historically used during Ashanti wars Early European visitors to the Ashanti city-state described dazzling displays of court regalia at the court of the Asantehene in Kumasi.Collins and Burns (2007), pp. 140-141. The region's natural gold resources had made the Ashanti people wealthy and court regalia, which included textiles (kente), ivory and gold, reflected high levels of skill. The Akrafokonmu (Ashanti Shield) is made out of iron and cast in gold. The Akrafokonmu was threaded onto a stick to which white pineapple fibre cord was tied to the ends so that it could be worn around the neck by those responsible for the ritual purification of the Asantehene's soul. The Ashantis call the shields \\"Akrafokonmu\\", usually translated as \\"soul discs\\" or \\"soul washers' badges\\". This shield's design of a quartered circle has been identified as 'nkwantaanan' ('nkwan' 'paths' or 'roads', 'anan' 'four'). Crossroads were considered to be places of spiritual and cultural significance.  Gallery  File:Brooklyn Museum 74.218.24 Sword Gold Weight.jpgAshanti 18th to 19th centuries Gold Akrafena.

In 1643, Blasius worked on Reberbanen in Copenhagen, built a bridge in Altona and rebuilt a church in Gl√ºckstadt.

There are many festivals each year attended by millions of people. A large number of traditional festivals are observed by the devotees of Jagannath. Out of those numerous festivals, twelve are important. #Snana Yatra #Ratha Yatra or Sri Gundicha Yatra # Sri Hari Sayan # Utthapan Yatra # Parswa Paribartan # Dakhinayan Yatra # Prarbana Yatra # Pusyavishek #Uttarayan #Dola Yatra # Damanak Chaturdasi # Akshaya Tritiya Snana Yatra On the Purnima of the month of Jyestha the Gods are ceremonially bathed and decorated every year on the occasion of Snana Yatra. Ratha Yatra Suna Vesha or Golden Attire of Lord Jagannath Ratha Yatra is most significant of all festivals of Jagannath. The Jagannath triad are usually worshiped in the sanctum of the temple, but once during the month of Asadha (Rainy Season of Odisha, usually falling in month of June or July), they are brought out onto the Bada Danda (The main high street of Puri) and travel (3 km) to the Shri Gundicha Temple, in huge chariots (Rath), allowing the public to have Darshan (Holy view). This festival is known as Ratha Yatra, meaning the festival (Yatra) of the chariots (Ratha). Ratha-Yatra is also termed as the Shri Gundicha yatra. This spectacular festival includes a procession of three huge chariots bearing the idols of Jagannath, Balabhadra and Subhadra through the Bada Danda meaning the Grand Avenue of Puri till their final destination the Gundicha Temple.  Hera Panchami  Hera Panchami is known as a ritual of Maa Mahalaxmi. Celebrated on the fifth day from Rath Yatra i.e. fifth day in bright fortnight of Ashadha. Hari Sayan This is the sayana utsav (sleeping ceremony) of the Lord. Sri Hari Sayan festival of Lord Jagannath is observed on the Asadha sukla edadashi (June‚ÄìJuly). Chandan Yatra In Akshaya Tritiya every year the Chandan Yatra festival marks the commencement of the construction of the Chariots of the Ratha Yatra. Panchaka During panchaka many people wait for different Beshas of deities. Different vesha like Dalakia vesha, Adakia vesha, Laksmi Nrusingha Vesha, Trivikrama vesha and finally on the day of Kartik Purnima lord is decorated in Rajarajeswara vesha. Nabakalebara One of the most grandiloquent events associated with the Lord Jagannath, Naba Kalabera takes place when one lunar month of Ashadha is followed by another lunar month of Aashadha. This can take place in 8, 12 or even 18 years. Literally meaning the ‚ÄúNew Body‚Äù (Nava = New, Kalevar = Body). The event involves installation of new images in the temple and burial of the old ones in the temple premises at Koili Vaikuntha. The idols that are currently being worshipped in the temple premises were installed in the year 1996. Presently in the year of 2015 Nabakalebara was held after 19 years. Anavasara or Anasara Literally means vacation. Every year, the main idols of Jagannath, Balabhadra, Subhadra & Sudarshan after the holy Snana Yatra on the Jyestha purnima, go to a secret altar named Anavasara Ghar where they remain for the next dark fortnight (krishna paksha). Hence devotees are not allowed to view them. Instead of this devotees go to nearby place Brahmagiri to see their beloved lord in the form of four handed form Alvarnath a form of Vishnu. Then people get the first glimpse of lord on the day before Rath Yatra, which is called 'Nabayaubana. It is said that the gods fall in fever after taking a huge bath and they are treated by the special servants named, Daitapatis for 15 days. During this period cooked food is not offered to the deities. Niladri Bije Celebrated on Asadha Trayodashi. Niladri Bije is the concluding day of Ratha yatra. On this day deities return to the ratna bedi. Lord Jagannath offers Rasgulla to goddess Laxmi to enter into the temple. Gupta Gundicha The annual shodasha dinatmaka or 16 day puja beginning 8 days prior to Mahalaya of Ashwin month for goddess Vimala and ending on Vijayadashami, is of great importance, in which both the utsava murty of lord Madanmohan and Vimala take part. Celebrated for 16 days from Ashwina Krushna dwitiya to Vijayadashami. As per tradition, the idol of Madhaba, along with the idol of Goddess Durga (known as Durgamadhaba), is taken on a tour of the temple premises. The tour within the temple is observed for the first eight days. For the next eight days, the idols are taken outside the temple on a palanquin to the nearby Narayani temple situated in the Dolamandapa lane. After their worship, they are brought back to the temple. Many festivals like Dol Yatra in spring and Jhulan Yatra in monsoon are celebrated by temple every year.Pavitrotsava and Damanaka utsava are celebrated as per panchanga or panjika. There are special ceremonies in the month of Kartika and Pausha. * Pana Sankranti: Also known or Vishuva Sankranti and Mesha Sankranti: Special rituals are performed at the temple. * Chitalagi Amabasya: Also known as Chitau Amabasya celebrated on Srabana Amavasya (July‚ÄìAugust), the gold and precious stone set Chitas those are removed from the deities on the Snana Purnima (Snana Yatra) night are again adorned on them. * Deba dipabali: Celebrated for three days from Margasira krushna chaturdashi to shukla pratipada, Jagannath as incarnation of Sri Ram offeres pinda to king Dasarath. On the second day as Krishna he offers Pinda to his original parents Basudev and Devaki and on the third day he offered Pinda to his foster parents Nanda and Jashoda References External links Category:Jagannath Category:Festivals in Jagannath Category:Lists of religious festivals Category:Lists of festivals in India Category:Hindu festivals festivals observed at Jagannatha Temple, Puri Category:Lists of tourist attractions in Odisha ","title":"List of festivals observed at Jagannatha Temple, Puri"},{"id":"37996991","text":"Apicalia echinasteri is a species of sea snail, a marine gastropod mollusk in the family Eulimidae.War√©n, 1980.

It is powered by a Caterpillar C175-20 V20 diesel engine rated at . The locomotive is capable of traveling at a maximum in-service speed of pulling consists of up to 10 cars. It was EMD's first new passenger locomotive for the North American market in 15 years, with the previous passenger locomotive being the EMD DE30AC and DM30AC built for the Long Island Rail Road. Features of the F125 include EPA Tier 4 emissions compliance (with exhaust after-treatment), AC traction systems, extended-range blend and dynamic brakes with HEP regeneration capabilities, advanced crash energy management (CEM) technology, and a streamlined body design, designed by Vossloh AG of Spain. History The Los Angeles commuter rail agency Metrolink is the launch customer for the EMD F125, with an order of 40 total. The cost of the base order of 10 units with an option of additional 10 was estimated at $150 million, with delivery commencing in 2016. The base order was signed on May 31, 2013 for 10 locomotives with an option for additional 10, which has since been exercised. Additional orders were exercised as funding became available. They will replace the EMD F59PH and EMD F59PHI. The first locomotive began testing in the first quarter of 2016 and was shown to the public on July 18, 2016 at Los Angeles Union Station during a special event, and had its first mainline run on June 10, 2017. The bulk of the order was expected to be delivered by April 2017 but major problems with the locomotives had prevented their full acceptance by Metrolink. In November 2018, Metrolink announced that only five locomotives had been accepted, and the project was two years behind schedule. Besides Metrolink, no other railroads ordered the F125. By contrast, the \\"Siemens Charger\\", a competing Tier 4 passenger locomotive, has sold more than 200 units including large orders from Amtrak and Via Rail. almost all F125 locomotives have been delivered, with two awaiting delivery to Metrolink.

Abrazo Garifuna in New York continues to be held annually as of 2014. Garifuna transnational activism in New York City Cultural Anthropologist of the African diaspora, Sarah England, has written one of the first ethnographies in a monograph length on the transnational migration of Garifuna Central Americans to New York City, \\"Afro Central Americans in New York City: Garifuna Tales of Transnational Movements in Racialized Space\\" (Gainesville: University Press of Florida, 2006 ). England examines the ways in which the experiences of transnational migration affect the social movements of the Garifuna in both Central America and New York City. She centers her analysis on family relations, community dynamics, economic practices, history, and grassroots organizing of one particular Garifuna transnational community with members traveling between and living in Lim√≥n, Honduras and New York City. Her narrative takes place in the 1990s on how Lim√≥n became the center of Garifuna organizing when members of that community challenged the practices of a Honduran large landowner and the National Agrarian Institute through the formation of an agricultural cooperative and ethnic social movement called El Movimiento Negro Iseri Lidawamari (Black Movement New Dawn). England's ethnography highlights the complexities of diasporic identities are defined both against and through notions of territoriality, nation, and indigeneity; such identities are defined against territoriality in the sense that they privilege the solidarity and identity of the geographically dispersed diaspora over the territorial nationalism of the countries of residence of its members. For Gar√≠funa, the politics of diaspora are complex because they have several different homelands and different relationships to them: from the mainly symbolic relationship to Africa and St. Vincent to the more immediate relationship to Central America.England, Sarah. \\"Transnational Movements, Racialized Space\\", Afro Central Americans in New York City: Garifuna Tales of Transnational Movements in Racialized Space.

The region, known as Transjordan, was controlled by numerous powers throughout history. During the early modern period, the region of Transjordan was included under the jurisdiction of Ottoman Syrian provinces. After the Great Arab Revolt against Ottoman rule during the 1910s, the Emirate of Transjordan was established in 1921 by Hashemite Emir Abdullah, and the Emirate became a British protectorate. In 1946, the Emirate achieved independence from the British and in 1952 the country changed its name to the \\"Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan\\". Name The prefix trans- is Latin and means \\"across\\" or beyond, and so \\"Transjordan\\" refers to the land on the other side of the Jordan River. The equivalent term for the west side is the Cisjordan ‚Äì literally, \\"on this side of the [River] Jordan\\". The Tanakh's , is translated in the Septuagint to , which was then translated to in the Vulgate Bible. However some authors give the , as the basis for Transjordan, which is also the modern Hebrew usage. Whereas the term \\"East\\" as in \\"towards the sunrise\\" is used in . History Egyptian period Egyptian provinces of the Retjenu, Amurru, and Apu regions 1300 BCE Semitic region, defined by the pre- Islamic distribution of Semitic languages (very roughly coinciding; culturally, politically, and historically). The Shasu were Semitic-speaking cattle nomads in the Levant from the late Bronze Age to the Early Iron Age. In a 15th-century BCE list of enemies inscribed on column bases at the temple of Soleb built by Amenhotep III, six groups of Shasu are noted; the Shasu of S'rr, the Shasu of Rbn, the Shasu of Sm't, the Shasu of Wrbr, the Shasu of Yhw, and the Shasu of Pysps. Some scholars link the Israelites and the worship of a deity named Yahweh with the Shasu. The Egyptian geographical term \\"Retjenu\\", is traditionally identified as an area covering Sinai and Canaan south of Lebanon, with the regions of Amurru and Apu to the north. And as such, parts of Canaan and southwestern Syria became tributary to the Egyptian Pharaohs in the early Late Bronze Age. When Canaanite confederacies centered on Megiddo and Kadesh, came under the control of the Egyptian Empire. However, the empire's control was sporadic, and not strong enough to prevent frequent local rebellions and inter-city conflict. Bronze Age collapse During the Late Bronze Age collapse the Amorites of Syria disappeared after being displaced or absorbed by a new wave of semi-nomadic West Semitic-speaking peoples known collectively as the Ahlamu. Over time, the Arameans emerged as the dominant tribe amongst the Ahlamu; with the destruction of the Hittites and the decline of Assyria in the late 11th century BCE, they gained control over much of Syria and Transjordan. The regions they inhabited became known as Aram (Aramea) and Eber-Nari. The Transjordanian Hebrew tribes Book of Joshua \\"Reuben and Gad Ask for Land\\", engraving by Arthur Boyd Houghton based on Numbers 32. The Book of Numbers (chapter ) tells how the tribes of Reuben and Gad came to Moses to ask if they could settle in the Transjordan. Moses is dubious, but the two tribes promise to join in the conquest of the land, and so Moses grants them this region to live in. The half tribe of Manasseh are not mentioned until verse 33. David Jobling suggests that this is because Manasseh settled in land which previously belonged to Og, north of the Jabbok, while Reuben and Gad settled Sihon's land, which lay south of the Jabbok. Since Og's territory was not on the route to Canaan, it was \\"more naturally part of the Promised Land\\", and so the Manassites' status is less problematic than that of the Reubenites or Gadites.David Jobling, The Sense of Biblical Narrative II: Structural Analyses in the Hebrew Bible (JSOTSup. 39; Sheffield: Sheffield Academic Press, 1986) 116. In the Book of Joshua (), Joshua affirms Moses' decision, and urges the men of the two and a half tribes to help in the conquest, which they are willing to do. In Joshua 22, the Transjordanian tribes return, and build a massive altar by the Jordan. This causes the \\"whole congregation of the Israelites\\" to prepare for war, but they first send a delegation to the Transjordanian tribes, accusing them of making God angry and suggesting that their land may be unclean. In response to this, the Transjordanian tribes say that the altar is not for offerings, but is only a \\"witness\\". The western tribes are satisfied, and return home. Assis argues that the unusual dimensions of the altar suggest that it \\"was not meant for sacrificial use\\", but was, in fact, \\"meant to attract the attention of the other tribes\\" and provoke a reaction.Elie Assis, \\"For it shall be a witness between us: a literary reading of Josh 22,\\" Scandinavian Journal of the Old Testament 18 (2004) 216. Per the settlement of the Israelite tribes east of the Jordan, Burton MacDonald notes; > There are various traditions behind the Books of Numbers, Deuteronomy, > Joshua, Judges, and 1 Chronicles‚Äô assignment of tribal territories and towns > to Reuben, Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh. Some of these traditions > provide only an idealized picture of Israelite possessions east of the > Jordan; others are no more than vague generalizations. Num 21.21‚Äì35, for > example, says only that the land the people occupied extended from Wadi > Arnon to Wadi Jabbok, the boundary of the Amorites. =Status= \\"The Children of Israel Crossing the Jordan\\", engraving by Gustave Dor√©. Moshe Weinfeld argues that in the Book of Joshua, the Jordan is portrayed as \\"a barrier to the promised land.\\" There is some ambiguity about the status of the Transjordan in the mind of the biblical writers. Horst Seebass argues that in Numbers \\"one finds awareness of Transjordan as being holy to YHWH.\\"Horst Seebass, \\"Holy Land in the Old Testament: Numbers and Joshua,\\" Vetus Testamentum 56 (2006) 104. He argues for this on the basis of the presence of the cities of refuge there, and because land taken in a holy war is always holy. Richard Hess, on the other hand, asserts that \\"the Transjordanian tribes were not in the land of promise.\\"Richard S. Hess, \\"Tribes of Israel and Land Allotments/Borders,\\" in Bill T. Arnold and H. G. M. Williamson (eds.), Dictionary of the Old Testament Historical Books (Downers Grove: IVP, 2005), 970. Moshe Weinfeld argues that in the Book of Joshua, the Jordan is portrayed as \\"a barrier to the promised land\\",Moshe Weinfeld, The Promise of the Land: The Inheritance of the Land of Canaan by the Israelites (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1993), 54. but in Deuteronomy and , the Transjordan is an \\"integral part of the promised land.\\"Moshe Weinfeld, \\"The Extent of the Promised Land ‚Äì the Status of Transjordan,\\" in Das Land Israel in biblischer Zeit (ed. G. Strecker; G√∂ttingen: Vandenhoeck & Ruprecht, 1983) 66-68. Unlike the other tribal allotments, the Transjordanian territory was not divided by lot. Jacob Milgrom suggests that it is assigned by Moses rather than by God.Jacob Milgrom, Numbers (JPS Torah Commentary; Philadelphia: JPS, 1990), 74. Lori Rowlett argues that in the Book of Joshua, the Transjordanian tribes function as the inverse of the Gibeonites (mentioned in ). Whereas the former have the right ethnicity, but wrong geographical location, the latter have the wrong ethnicity, but are \\"within the boundary of the 'pure' geographical location.\\"Lori Rowlett, \\"Inclusion, Exclusion and Marginality in the Book of Joshua,\\" JSOT 55 (1992) 17. Other Transjordanian nations According to Genesis, (), Ammon and Moab were born to Lot and Lot's younger and elder daughters, respectively, in the aftermath of the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah. The Bible refers to both the Ammonites and Moabites as the \\"children of Lot\\". Throughout the Bible, the Ammonites and Israelites are portrayed as mutual antagonists. During the Exodus, the Israelites were prohibited by the Ammonites from passing through their lands (). In the Book of Judges, the Ammonites work with Eglon, king of the Moabites against Israel. Attacks by the Ammonites on Israelite communities east of the Jordan were the impetus behind the unification of the tribes under Saul (). According to both Books of Kings () and Books of Chronicles (), Naamah was an Ammonite. She was the only wife of King Solomon to be mentioned by name in the Tanakh as having borne a child. She was the mother of Solomon's successor, Rehoboam. The Ammonites presented a serious problem to the Pharisees because many marriages with Ammonite (and Moabite) wives had taken place in the days of Nehemiah (). The men had married women of the various nations without conversion, which made the children not Jewish.The identity of those particular tribes had been lost during the mixing of the nations caused by the conquests of Assyria. As a result, people from those nations were treated as complete gentiles and could convert without restriction. The legitimacy of David's claim to royalty was disputed on account of his descent from Ruth, the Moabite.The Babylonian Talmud points out that Doeg the Edomite was the source of this dispute. He claimed that since David was descended from someone who was not allowed to marry into the community, his male ancestors were no longer part of the tribe of Judah (which was the tribe the King had to belong to). As a result, he could neither be the king, nor could he marry any Jewish woman (since he descended from a Moabite convert). The Prophet Samuel wrote the Book of Ruth in order to remind the people of the original law that women from Moab and Ammon were allowed to convert and marry into the Jewish people immediately. King David spent time in the Transjordan after he had fled from the rebellion of his son Absalom (). Classical period Palestine & Coele-Syria according to Ptolemy (map by Claude Reignier Conder of the Palestine Exploration Fund) Iturea, Gaulanitis (Golan), Trachonitis (Lajat), Auranitis (Hauran), and Batanaea in the first century CE. Cities of the Decapolis The Decapolis is named from its ten cities enumerated by Pliny the Elder (23‚Äì79). What Pliny calls Decapolis, Ptolemy (c. 100‚Äìc. 170) calls C≈ìle-Syria. Ptolemy does not use the term \\"Transjordan\\", but rather the periphrasis \\"across the Jordan\\". And he enumerates the cities; Cosmas, Libias, Callirhoe, Gazorus, Epicaeros‚Äîas being in this district‚Äîeast of the Jordan, that Josephus et al. called Perea.Ptolemy, Geographica, Book 5, Ch.15:6 Jerash was a prominent central community for the surrounding region during the Neolithic period and was also inhabited during the Bronze Age. Ancient Greek inscriptions from the city, and the literary works of Iamblichus and the Etymologicum Magnum indicate that the city was founded as \\"Gerasa\\" by Alexander the Great or his general Perdiccas, for the purpose of settling retired Macedonian soldiers (Œ≥·øÜœÅŒ±œÇ‚Äîgƒìras‚Äîmeans \\"old age\\" in Ancient Greek). It was a city of the Decapolis, and is one of the most important and best preserved Ancient Roman cities in the Near East. The Nabataeans' trading network was centered on strings of oases that they controlled. The Nabataean kingdom reached its territorial zenith during the reign of Aretas III (87-62 BCE), when it encompassed parts of the territory of modern Jordan, Syria, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and Israel. Bosra is located in a geographical area called the Hauran plateau. The soil of this volcanic plateau made it a fertile region for the cultivation of domesticated cereals during the Neolithic Agricultural Revolution. The city was noted in Egyptian documents of the 14th century BCE, and was situated on the trade routes where caravans brought spices from India and the Far East across the eastern desert while other caravans brought myrrh and frankincense from the south. The region of Hauran then called \\"Auranitis\\" came under the control of the Nabataean kingdom. And the city of Bosra then called \\"Bostra\\" became the northern capital of the kingdom while its southern capital was Petra. After Pompey's military conquest of Syria, Judaea, and Transjordan. Control of the city was later transferred to Herod the Great and his heirs until 106 CE, when Bosra was incorporated into the new Roman province of Arabia Petraea. The Herodian kingdom of Judaea was a client state of the Roman Republic from 37 BCE, and included Samaria and Perea. And when Herod died in 4 BCE, the kingdom was divided among his sons into the Herodian Tetrarchy. Provincia Arabia Petraea or simply Arabia, was a frontier province of the Roman Empire beginning in the 2nd century. It consisted of the former Nabataean kingdom in the southern Levant, Sinai Peninsula, and northwestern Arabian peninsula. Crusader period: Oultrejordain The Lordship of Oultrejordain (Old French for \\"beyond the Jordan\\"), also called the Lordship of Montreal, otherwise Transjordan, was part of the Crusader Kingdom of Jerusalem. Trade routes Roman roads * Via Maris * Via Traiana Nova * Petra Roman Road The King‚Äôs Highway was a trade route of vital importance to the ancient Near East. It began in Egypt and stretched across the Sinai Peninsula to Aqaba. From there it turned northward across Transjordan, leading to Damascus and the Euphrates River. During the Roman period the road was called Via Regia (Orient). Emperor Trajan rebuilt and renamed it Via Traiana Nova (viz. Via Traiana Roma), under which name it served as a military and trade road along the fortified Limes Arabicus. The Incense Route comprised a network of major ancient land and sea trading routes linking the Mediterranean world with Eastern and Southern sources of incense, spices and other luxury goods, stretching from Mediterranean ports across the Levant and Egypt through Northeastern Africa and Arabia to India and beyond. The incense land trade from South Arabia to the Mediterranean flourished between roughly the 7th century BCE to the 2nd century CE.

Red - choline and phosphate group; Black - glycerol; Green - unsaturated fatty acid; Blue - saturated fatty acid Egg lecithin is a type of lecithin, a group of compounds primarily containing phospholipids, that is derived from eggs. Discovery Egg lecithin was first isolated in 1846 by the French chemist and pharmacist Theodore Gobley.Gobley (1846) \\"Recherches chimiques sur le jaune d'≈ìuf\\" (Chemical researches on egg yolk), Journal de Pharmacie et de Chemie, series 3, vol. 9, pages 81-91; on page 84) Gobley originally isolated lecithin from egg yolk--ŒªŒ≠Œ∫ŒπŒ∏ŒøœÇ (lekithos) is 'egg yolk' in ancient Greek--and established the complete chemical formula of phosphatidylcholine in 1874. Biology Phosphatidylcholine a major component of egg lecithin, occurs in all cellular organisms, being one of the important components of the phospholipid portion of the cell membrane. Other components include phosphatidylethanolamine and sphingomyelin. Production Egg lecithin is usually extracted chemically using ethanol, acetone, petroleum ether but not benzene or hexane due to restrictions on residual solvents by the pharmaceutical regulations.ICH Topic Q3C (R4) Impurities: Guideline for Residual Solvents It is an emulsifier, especially for parenteral use since it does not need to be metabolized. In aqueous solution, its phospholipids can form either liposomes, bilayer sheets, micelles, or lamellar structures, depending on hydration and temperature. This results in a type of surfactant that is usually classified as amphipathic. Commercial egg lecithin, specified in the United States National Formulatory (USP/NF) as used by pharmaceutical companies, is a highly purified mixture of phospholipids, devoid of triglycerides, cholesterol, or proteins. Properties and applications Egg lecithin has emulsification and lubricant properties, and is a surfactant. It can be totally integrated into the cell membrane in humans, so does not need to be metabolized and is well tolerated by humans and nontoxic when ingested; some synthetic emulsifiers can only be excreted via the kidneys. Applications include: * In the pharmaceutical industry, it acts as a wetting, stabilizing agent and a choline enrichment carrier, helps in emulsifications and encapsulation, and is a good dispersing agent. It can be used in manufacture of intravenous fat infusions and for therapeutic use. Examples of intravenous applications are propofol for anesthesia, NSAID drugs, etc. * In the cosmetics industry, it is used to produce stable O/W emulsions for cosmetic compositions or pharmaceutical excipientsUnited States Patent No. 4481185, Grollier, et.al. Egg lecithin is approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration with the status \\"generally recognized as safe\\"Egg-derived phospholipids as an ingredient in term and preterm infant formula, Food and Drug Administration, USA and listed in the compendium.  Compatibility with special diets  Egg-derived lecithin is not usually a concern for those allergic to eggs since commercially available food grade egg lecithin is devoid of allergy causing egg proteins. Egg lecithin is not a concern for those on low-cholesterol diets, because the lecithin found in eggs markedly inhibits the absorption of the cholesterol contained in eggs.Unisci.com, Why Eggs Don't Contribute Much Cholesterol To Diet.

It was directed by Charles Nichols. Plot The Spirit of Spring in the form of a faun dances through the countryside playing his panflute and melting the snow, heralding the end of winter and the beginning of spring. When his revitalizing influence reaches Pluto's doghouse, it causes mushrooms to magically sprout up under Pluto's chin, waking him from his winter slumber. The Spirit of Spring coaxes Pluto out of his doghouse; Pluto shakes off his blanket, takes a deep breath of fresh spring air and skips into the forest. He enjoys the scent of trees before stumbling into a bush, where he hears birdsong, drawing his attention to a couple of bluebirds courting. When the bluebirds kiss, two bird chicks jump up from the nest singing. A couple of playful lambs hop by, spurring Pluto to mimic them by hopping as well. His hopping causes him to hit his head on a low-hanging branch and fall yet again into another bush, scaring out rabbits and quails. As one train of quails flees from him, one quail chick lags behind and Pluto decides to run after it, mimicking its way of running. Pluto and the quail stops abruptly as they both hear a deep, bass voice singing about springtime. The voice is echoing out of a tiny burrow in the ground, to which the quail chick puts its ears to better listen to the singing. Suddenly, a fuzzy green caterpillar pops out of the burrow and continues to sing, though now in a high falsetto. The quail is delighted to see food present itself so easily and opens its mouth in anticipation. The caterpillar, halfway through singing does a double-take as he finally notices the quail eyeing him hungrily. The caterpillar reaches out with two of his hands and daintily closes the quail's beak, smiling at it shyly. Bewildered at having its mouth closed, the quail gives the caterpillar enough time to launch itself out of the burrow only to dive headfirst back inside. Not willing to let its prey escape so easily, the quail thrusts it head into the burrow after the caterpillar, manages to bite onto the caterpillar's tail and starts to slowly pull the caterpillar back out. To continue his mimicry, Pluto clamps his teeth on the quail's tail feathers and also starts pulling, lifting the quail into the air, and stretching the caterpillar to more than three times its original length. The caterpillar continues to keep his head inside the burrow while flailing his legs in desperation even though the sound of stretching can be heard. Finally, the quail's tail feathers give out, causing the tug of war to end with Pluto's head whipping back, red feathers floating everywhere. When Pluto investigates, he can see that the force of the caterpillar snapping back to his original length had pulled the quail halfway into the burrow with its head facing out. Underground, the caterpillar sees the quail's rear plugging up his hole, so in vengeance, he uses his many legs to repeatedly kick the quail's rear until the quail is forced out of the burrow like popping champagne cork. Above ground, Pluto hears a strange thumping, while behind him, the caterpillar pops out of a new burrow he had just dug. Upon seeing Pluto's long, slender, black tail, the caterpillar who was rather grumpy from having almost been eaten immediately brightens up and starts climbing the tail. Pluto is startled that something was climbing his tail, but when he sees the caterpillar, he is curious what the caterpillar is trying to do. At this point, the caterpillar starts singing in a deep voice again about the urgent transformation that he must undergo. When he reaches the top of Pluto's tail, which is curved horizontally, he reaches behind himself and pulls out a lasso of silk from his own tail. The caterpillar raises the lasso over his head, swings it around, and loops it across the end of Pluto's tail. The caterpillar takes a bungee leap from the tail and dangles upside-down from the silk thread tied to Pluto's tail, while Pluto becomes more confused and apprehensive at what the caterpillar was up to, but lets him continue anyway. Still singing, the caterpillar curves his body in preparation, building momentum, before suddenly twisting and gyrating his tail, creating a spinning blur that travels down towards his head, leaving a silk covering in its wake. Soon the spinning blur covers the caterpillars head, leaving him completely covered in a gray, spiraling spindle-shaped cocoon that swings slightly before hanging still. Unsure what had just happened, Pluto shakes the end of his tail, swinging the cocoon madly about, causing it to shake and rattle like a maraca. Despite all this, the caterpillar manages to finish his song just as Pluto stops shaking it and stares at the cocoon curiously. The midsection of the cocoon then starts to swing left and right as a bouncy rhumba beat starts playing. After swinging for a bit, the cocoon scrunches up and in a jumping motion, the creature that was uncomfortably trapped inside reveals itself to have the face of a beautiful, sultry Hispanic woman with light brown skin, big hazel eyes, full red lips, long raven black hair, and two long slender antenna poking out of her head. Her appearance comes to Pluto as an immensely pleasant surprise as she, now with her bare arms and big pink and purple butterfly wings exposed, starts to swing her arms around and bounce her hips, which are still trapped within the cocoon, back and forth in a dancing motion. She plays at being coy by giving Pluto a pouty, startled, almost accusatory look, to which he responds in embarrassment, but she immediately drops all pretense and proceeds to pull herself out of her restricting cocoon, showing that she's wearing a short magenta dress with black fuzzy lining and an open back. She flies from the cocoon and flutters wildly about Pluto's face, disorienting him before landing on the tip of his nose. She continues to entertain Pluto by slowly dancing closer and closer to his face, swinging her hips back and forth and waving her hands palm-forward in front of her chest, smiling at him. Pluto tries to shake her off, but she stays on, alternately covering his eyes with her wings playfully. She then uses the eye-spots on her wings to 'wink' at him before flying from his nose and landing on top of a sunflower. There she continues to dance and picks up a hanging dewdrop and uses it as a ball. Pluto shakes his head back and forth to the beat, completely enthralled by her performance. The butterfly flies up with the dewdrop above her head, swings her hips some more, then descends back onto the flower. Pluto tries to mimic her movement by flapping his ears and making his eyes pop left and right. The butterfly then goes into a high speed ballerina spin before stopping abruptly by sticking out her leg and striking a pose. At this, Pluto decides to try his hand at doing a similar dance so he spins like a tornado until he finds a beehive hanging from a nearby branch. He knocks it down and starts dancing with, balancing it between his feet and bouncing it on his nose. This shakes the bees out who quickly form a black cloud and retaliate, taking on various shapes like a bomber plane or a rocket, firing bees as bullets at Pluto. They continue to chase him until he jumps into a bush. The bees flee, causing Pluto to snicker at his good fortune before he realizes he landed in a bush of poison ivy. While he is scratching himself from the itching, he lands into some goldenrods, which release their pollen, inducing a sneezing fit as his allergies get triggered. Then the sky gets dark as a strong April shower starts coming down with thunder followed by hail, chasing Pluto back to his doghouse. When the storm passes, the Spirit of Spring comes back, frolicking. A bruised and battered Pluto comes out of his doghouse and blames all his misfortune on the unsuspecting fawn and chases him down trying to take revenge. The short ends with Pluto chasing the Spirit into the distance.

It was recorded in Los Angeles, produced by Van Dyke Parks and features several American session musicians such as Lowell George and Bill Payne of the band Little Feat. Background and recording The album was recorded at Sunset Sound Studios in Los Angeles in late 1972. Van Dyke Parks, known for his collaborations with Brian Wilson and The Beach Boys, produced the album. In 2013, Parks stated that the band walked in unannounced while he and Lowell George were working on \\"Sailin' Shoes\\" and asked him to give them the \\"California Sound\\". He initially refused saying he was busy with sessions for his own album Discover America, but accepted when George noticed a suitcase full of new one hundred-dollar bills with Happy End's manager. Although Haruomi Hosono later described the work with Parks as \\"productive,\\" the album sessions were tenuous, and the members of Happy End were disenchanted with their vision of America they had anticipated. A language barrier along with opposition between the Los Angeles studio personnel and the band was also apparent, which further frustrated the group. He and Eiichi Ohtaki both recalled that Parks was drunk during production and tried to lecture them about Pearl Harbor and World War II. These feelings were conveyed in the closing track , which received some contributions from Parks and George. As Takashi Matsumoto explained: \\"We had already given up on Japan, and with [that song], we were saying bye-bye to America too‚Äîwe weren't going to belong to any place.\\" Happy End officially disbanded on December 31, 1972, two months before the album was released on February 25, 1973.

She served on the River Plate, North Sea, and North American Stations, where she captured numerous privateers and merchant vessels. The Navy sold her in 1816. Capture The time of her capture, the British described Paz as being \\"pierced for 10 Guns, about 3 Years old, Sails on Shore, is coppered, and pretty well found.\\" In June Paz was on the River Plate in the squadron under Admiral George Murray supporting General John Whitelocke's soldiers in the operations to capture Buenos Aires. Service HMS Paz was registered on 4 June 1808. However, she was already commissioned in February 1807 under Lieutenant George Mitchenor. In April, Lieutenant John Pierie replaced Mitchenor, still on the River plate station. Pierie had been a pressed man, an unusual background for an officer. He quarreled with his sailing master and froze him out of the running of the vessel.Army Quarterly (1994), Vol. 124, p.443. During Pierie's command, 14 of his 31 crewmen deserted. This may not have been entirely due to Pierie. When captains of four other vessels on the station were asked to provide crew to man Paz, they naturally sent over \\"the clumsy, the stupid, the violent, and the disobedient\\", and these men represented over half of her crew.Army Quarterly (1994), Vol. 124, p.478. Paz sailed to the Cape of Good Hope. There Lieutenant Daniel Pring took command and sailed her to England.Tucker et al., (2012), p.592. There she was refitted at Portsmouth between 24 April 1808 and 6 June 1808. In 1809 in the North Sea. Still under Pring's command, on 23 May 1809, Paz was in company when the gun-brig when they destroyed two Danish privateers, one was the Elsigneur and the other Sylt. Exertion, Paz, and then captured the French privateer Fortune on 16 June. Paz destroyed the privateer Betsey on 20 July. Some three weeks later, on 10 August, Paz was in company with the gun-vessel (and ex-Dutch schuyt) at Hocksyl. There they captured the Danish privateer Blankanaise, a sloop laden with linen, a lugger in ballast, and sundry goods. Two weeks later, Patriot, Paz, and the gun-vessels Censor and captured property at Harlinger Zyl, together with a Danish privateer and a mutt in ballast. The next month, on 11 September, , Patriot, Paz, and Jahde shared in the capture of vessels referred to in the prize-money announcement as Young Pincher, Young Paz, and Young Patriot. Then on 3 November Paz and detained Twee Gebroders and Jonge Jeltzie. On 26 December 1809, Blazer and Paz were serving independently blockading the river Ems when Blazer captured an American vessel that was attempting to breach the blockade. Paz sued to share in the proceeds on two grounds: first, that the two British vessels were engaged in a joint enterprise, and second, that Paz had been in sight at the time of the capture. The court ruled that Lord George Stuart, who commanded the station at Heligoland, had sent the two British vessels out with parallel, but not joint orders. It further ruled that there was no independent evidence that Paz had been in sight. The court therefore denied the claim. The case was nevertheless important in that it helped define the meaning of blockade.Howard et al., (1853), pp.424-8. Paz sailed for North America on 22 April 1811. Paz recaptured the schooner Martha, J. Darley, master, on 18 July. In September 1812 Paz arrived at Halifax with a convoy and Pring transferred to the flagship of Admiral Herbert Sawyer. Paz then came under the command of Lieutenant Perry Dumaresque. On 4 December Paz captured the privateer schooner Revenge, of 69 tons and 27 men, under the command of John Sinclair, Jnr., master. Revenge was out of Salem and was carrying guns, ammunition and provisions for a cruise.Essex Institute (1911) Paz had captured Revenge, the former John and George (of three guns and 38 men, out of Salem), off the Jeddore Ledges. An American account reported that a sloop of six guns had set out from Nova Scotia with 100 volunteers on board to attempt to capture Revenge. A running fight of four hours ensued before the sloop gave up. Casualties on Revenge were one man killed and three wounded. The newspaper claimed that 40 to 50 men aboard the Nova Scotian vessel had been killed or wounded. The account reported that a three-masted schooner or lugger, of 17 guns, then came out and that it was that vessel that captured Revenge.Niles Weekly Register, Vol. 5, p. 202. - accessed 23 December 2012. In Halifax, two successful privateers, Thomas Freeman and Snow Parker, bought Revenge at Halifax for ¬£530 and renamed her Retaliation. She was armed with two 4-pounder guns and a long 12-pounder gun on a pivot; to these her new owners added two 12-pounder carronades. Retaliation went on to have a successful career preying on American shipping. In March 1813, Paz was part of a squadron under the command of Admiral Sir John Poo Beresford in , which was blockading the Delaware River. The squadron also included and two sloops. On 16 March, Beresford sent a demand to Lewistown, for the Americans to provide his vessels with twenty live bullocks, in return for payment, or face bombardment. The governor of Delaware played for time as he moved in troops to resist a landing. On 17 March Paz captured the 10-gun schooner Pennsylvania, out of Cape May, New Jersey. The Royal Navy kept Pennsylvania for use as a tender. On 11 April, Pennsylvania captured Pilgrim, which was sailing to Boston. The British took out her cargo and proceeded to use Pilgrim too as a tender. Paz was part of a squadron of 12 ships that shared in the capture on 13 and 14 March of Christina and Massatoit. Dumaresque and Paz also captured Montesquieu, which occurred on 27 March 1813. She belonged to the Philadelphia banker Stephen Girard and was bringing a valuable cargo of tea, nankeen, silk, copper, and cassia (Chinese cinnamon - Cinnamomum cassia), from Canton. Dumaresque put the entire crew of Montesquieu and their baggage into the ship's pinnace, except for the ship's supercargo, Arthur Grelaud, and the ship's steward. The captain and crew arrived safely in Lewis Town that same day and the captain immediately sent a letter to Girard. Beresford arrived on the scene in Poictiers. Beresford took Montesquieu into the Delaware River and immediately entered into negotiations with Girard's agents instead of sending the vessel to be condemned at the Vice admiralty court in Halifax. Girard, with the authorization of the American authorities, paid 180,000 Spanish milled dollars ransom for his vessel, an amount that Grelaud had negotiated. Girard applied to the US authorities for permission to pay the ransom, which he received. (Girard's Bank was a principal source of government credit during the War of 1812.) Dumaresque, and his descendants, blamed Beresford for having deprived them of the prize.Dictionary of Canadian Biography Online - Perry Dumaresque. (Accessed 21 December 2012). Paz shared the ransom with Belvidera and Poictiers. This business having been completed around the end of March, on 6 and 7 April, the British squadron, including Paz, bombarded Lewes (Lewistown), the Americans having declined to deliver the bullocks that Beresford had requested. The British fired some 400 shot, but with little or no effect and no infliction of any casualties, and then withdrew. Then on 10 May Paz captured the sloop Juliet, of 92 tons, which was sailing from Cuba to Newport, Rhode Island. Under her master, C. Southworth, Juliet was carrying 113 hogsheads and 19 tierces of molasses. Pazs war on commerce continued with the capture on 13 September of the schooner Richard D. Stanley, of 115 tons, sailing to Boston with a cargo of 506 barrels of tar, 170 of pitch, 69 of turpentine and 100 of flour. In October, Paz captured three vessels. The first, on 4 October, was the 95-ton sloop Charles, of Ocracocke, J. Cook, master, which was carrying 679 barrels of flour to St. Johns, New Brunswick. The second, on 14 October, was the schooner Randolph, W. Clarke, master. The third, on 27 October, was the schooner William, S. Nevis, master, which was carrying provisions from New York to Charlestown. Fate Paz was paid off in October 1814. She was sold in 1816, but her name was not deleted from the Navy List until 7 February 1817.

It is located in the village of Storslett. It is the church for the Nordreisa parish which is part of the Nord-Troms prosti (deanery) in the Diocese of Nord-H√•logaland. The white, wooden church was built in a long church style in 1856 by the architect Christian Heinrich Grosch. The church seats about 350 people. The building was consecrated on 8 October 1856 by the Bishop Knud Gislesen. During the last winter of World War II (1944‚Äì1945), the church was used as a residence for German soldiers, and the service building nearby was used as a horse stable. The church was spared during the burning of Finnmark and Northern Troms by the retreating German Army in 1945. Much of the church inventory disappeared during this period, but a few years after the war a baptismal bowl from 1856 was found in a pile of horse manure.

The project was first proposed in the 1980s, but never moved out of the development and planning stages. Early attempts 1981-1998 The first incarnation of the Tongue River Railroad began in 1981, when three companies, DS Cartage Corporation, Otter Creek Transportation Company, and Transportation Properties Inc., a Washington Energy Company subsidiary, formed a consortium to build a roughly railroad from Miles City, Montana, where it would connect with the Burlington Northern Railroad, to Ashland, where Billings, Montana- based coal company Montco planned to build a large surface coal mine. The plan was approved in 1986 by the Interstate Commerce Commission, but never built. As a result of lower coal prices in the late 1980s, plans for the railroad were tabled. However, as the implementation of the Clean Air Act required coal burning power plants to use low-sulfur coal of the kind in southern Montana, a revived proposal for a route, estimated to cost about $117 million, emerged in the early 1990s, led by developer Mike Gustafson. The Surface Transportation Board (STB) approved that route, from Miles City to Birney, Montana, in 1996. 2007 to present The railroad was still not built, however, and by 2007 a third route had emerged, which would terminate the line at Decker, Montana, where an existing BNSF line moved trains south onto a circuitous routing to Miles City. This alignment allowed the Tongue River line to serve both existing coal traffic as well as new mines along the route. In October 2007, the STB approved the routing and granted approval to begin construction on an initial section of track on the southern end of the route. The planned construction was halted two years later, however, when in July 2009 the Montana Department of Fish and Wildlife rejected Tongue River's request for an easement to build through a fish hatchery. In March 2010, the state of Montana agreed to lease the Otter Creek coal tracts to Arch Coal, allowing the project, now on a routing, to again move forward. In July 2011, plans again changed when rights to the project were purchased from developer Gustofson by Arch Coal, BNSF, and Forrest Mars, ex-CEO of Mars, Inc. With the ownership change, the route was once again cut back to Ashland, to avoid going through Mars' personal ranch near Birney. In late December 2011, the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ordered the STB to conduct a new environmental impact statement for the Tongue River line, as well as review construction permits for two parts of the route. The ruling came after a coalition made up of the Northern Plains Resource Council, the city of Forsyth, Montana, the United Transportation Union, and private individual Mark Fix challenged the STB's earlier approval of the route. As part of the STB's review, the board in June 2012 required the Tongue River Railroad to file a new application, in light of changing plans and routes since the 2007 approval. In December 2012, Tongue River Railroad issued a new application for a shorter line between Ashland and the BNSF line at Colstrip, Montana, instead of Miles City. According to the railroad, the route had been considered in the past, but rejected due to steep grades; however, advances in distributed power on trains had made it feasible. The new alignment was estimated to cost $416 million, as opposed to $490 million for the Miles City route. The STB's latest environmental impact study was originally expected to be completed in 2013, but was delayed until April 2015, when the board released the draft EIS for public comment before it issues a final decision. The board studied both the proposed route, as well as five alternatives, which would transport an estimated 20 million tons of coal annually on 26 trains each way per week. In November 2015, Tongue River Railroad \\"submitted a request [to the STB] to suspend the permitting process,\\" according to a BNSF spokesperson, who cited delays in state approval of constructing a coal mine in the Otter Creek tracts. Originally expected to begin production in 2017, the Otter Creek mine was denied a permit in March 2015 by the Montana Department of Environmental Quality, which said that Arch Coal's application at the time contained hundreds of flaws. The STB finally rejected the request in April 2016, citing the bankruptcy of Arch Coal.

The episode was written by David Fury and directed by Jeffrey Hunt. Plot After finding that the Observer child Michael lacks any implant that the other Observers have, the Fringe team try to communicate with him to learn any more about September's plan or the identity of the person they know as \\"Donald\\", but find it difficult to make any connection. Olivia contacts Nina Sharp discreetly, asking for her help; she promises to meet them away from the Ministry of Science. There, Nina takes them to a \\"black lab\\" left over from Massive Dynamic, where they were studying Observers. Nina attempts to use a mind-computer interface device to read Michael's thoughts but the software cannot cope with Michael's mind. However, she suggests using a second interface to allow Michael to read their thoughts and then reply, but this would require another of the interface devices, held at a storage facility at the Ministry of Science. Olivia, Peter, and Walter leave Michael with Nina at the lab while they go to recover the device. Meanwhile, Captain Windmark of the Observers is alerted to Nina's absence, and uses Observer technology to read the sound waves from Olivia's call to overhear the words \\"child Observer\\". When Nina does not return, they turn to the storage facility where the sublimation device, previously used by Fringe to access an old laboratory (\\"Five-Twenty-Ten\\"), had been taken from, and start probing all the workers there, including Dr. Hastings (Gabe Khouth), who had helped the Fringe team earlier. The Fringe team arrives and recovers the devices just as Dr. Hastings is being probed, and along with a trace on Nina's phone, the Fringe team realize that Nina and the black lab have been compromised, and warn her as they race back. Nina talks to Michael about hiding him, and he touches her momentarily before letting her lead him to safety. When Windmark and the Observers arrive, they find Nina waiting for them. Windmark starts to probe her, and explains that the child is really just an anomaly, XB-6783746, from the Observer's time in the future that was to be destroyed before he was taken. Windmark considers the humans to be animals to have experimented on the Observer bodies in the lab. Nina retorts that though the Observers may treat humans as animals, that the Observers have developed involuntary habits that humans have since evolved past. Windmark orders the Loyalist agents to restrain her for him to run a deeper probe, but she grabs one of their guns and kills herself. By the time Olivia, Peter, and Walter have returned, the lab has been ransacked, and Nina's body remains. Olivia and Walter mourn their loss while Peter notes from security footage that she killed herself to prevent her mind being read. They realize that Windmark left without the child, and they find Michael hiding in a secret compartment. Michael sees Nina's body and lets out a tear. Back at the Harvard lab, Walter attempts to connect with Michael with the devices. After an initial success, Michael takes off his device, walks to Walter, and puts his hand on Walter's face, as he had previously done to Nina. Walter experiences a sudden surge of memories, including those from the previous timeline, culminating in an image of a middle-aged man, and a re-iteration of September's warning to Walter, \\"The boy must live\\" (\\"Peter\\"). When Walter recovers, he reveals what Michael has shown him: that the \\"Donald\\" they have been looking for is really September, the Observer. Production \\"Anomaly XB-6783746\\" was written by co-executive producer David Fury, marking his third writing of the season. Fury wrote a total of seven episodes while on the writing staff for the final two seasons. It was directed by Jeffrey Hunt, who directed four episodes for the series, including season four's \\"The End of All Things\\", which Fury also wrote. Reception Ratings \\"Anomaly XB-6783746\\" first aired in the United States on December 21, 2012 on Fox. An estimated 3.02 million viewers watched the episode, and earned a ratings share of 1.0 among adults aged 18 to 49, slightly down in viewership from the previous episode. Reviews IGN's Ramsey Isler rated the episode 8.3 out of 10, saying the inclusion of Nina Sharp was the strongest part of the episode, noting she \\"steals the show\\". Isler highly enjoyed her final scene, saying it was \\"truly the best part of the episode\\". He also said he liked that the mysteries are finally starting to get answers, but felt the early parts of the episode were dragged out. Noel Murray of The A.V. Club felt the episode followed the pattern of much of the episodes this season, with a slow beginning, but a strong ending. He noted the final act was \\"full of action, revelations, stylistic filigree, and rich emotion.\\" He ultimately gave the episode a \\"B+\\" grade.

D. Richter and starring Peter Berg, Brian Wimmer and Marcia Gay Harden. The supporting cast features Peter Gallagher and Richard Steinmetz, along with Janeane Garofalo's first film appearance, briefly playing a cashier during a comical sequence in a burger joint. Plot In 1962, best friends and brothers-in-law Willie Husband (Brian Wimmer) and simple-minded Frank Lovegren (Peter Berg) are running from the police because Willie shot and killed a man. It was self-defense, but a witness intends to frame them both for kidnapping and murder. Frank explains what happened: Willie; his wife, Joy (Marcia Gay Harden); and little daughter, Jess (Cassy Friel); live a happy life in Santa Fe, New Mexico, where Joy's brother, Frank, lives with them. Willie lost his job at the milk company, and they have fallen behind in house payments. They learn the bank intends to foreclose, so Willie pays a visit to the banker, Bob Freeman (Peter Gallagher), to show that he made up the back payments with funds borrowed from relatives. Freeman takes Willie's receipt and burns it, then offers to buy his house for less than it's worth. He is building a huge, new home development in the area, and he needs all the land in Willie's neighborhood to do it. Willie refuses to undersell or to bow to pressure, and destroys an expensive chair and rug before storming out of the office. That's the last straw for Freeman, and he vows revenge. On the drive home, Willie discovers Frank \\"borrowed\\" Freeman's little boy, Donald (Ross Malinger), because Frank realized the boy was being emotionally abused by his father. He pleads to Willie to let him keep Donald, as he is small and won't eat much. When they get home, Joy convinces Willie they have to accept the lowball offer and just get out while they can. Willie calls Freeman to tell him that he will accept his offer after all, and that, by the way, his son had somehow \\"wedged himself into the back seat\\" of his car. Realizing this is his chance to get what he wants, Freeman accuses Willie of kidnapping. They agree to meet in the desert just outside town, Willie believing it is only to return the boy and to get the $9,000 Freeman offered for his house. Once they are face to face, Freeman produces an envelope filled with $15,000, intending to make this look like a ransom exchange. Freeman and his henchman then both pull guns, right in front of little Donald, as Freeman admits he was the one who got Willie fired from his job so he would be unable to pay his mortgage, making it possible for him to buy the house for a low price. He is confident Donald will tell the police whatever he says to tell them, and as he aims his gun, Willie jumps Freeman, and the henchman shoots Willie in the shoulder. Freeman reaches for the gun, but Frank tackles him and knocks him out. The henchman aims his gun at Frank, but Willie manages to shoot the man in the chest. It was self- defense, but they know Freeman will claim otherwise. They have to leave Donald there and take off before the police arrive, whom Freeman called before he got there. They try to stop at home first, but they can see police cars are already there. Willie's little daughter sees them coming, and silently shakes her head to tell them not to stop, so, sadly, they drive away. They don't realize this is the last time they may ever see Joy and Jess. After escaping for hours through the desert, they come across Dr. Dan Chilblains (Bo Brundin) in Pomona, California. Willie has passed out, but the doctor fixes up his wound, and discovers that Frank has glomerulonephritis, which will eventually kill him. Chilblains has invented a procedure that can freeze a human being without killing him, and convinces Frank to let him freeze them both until Frank can be treated for kidney disease ‚Äì maybe even get a new kidney (a procedure that is not widely known in 1962) ‚Äì and to hide them from the police. Excited by the prospect of being cured, Frank agrees, and assumes the unconscious Willie will be okay with it. The doctor allows Frank to think it's just like sleeping, and it will only be for a little while. He sedates them, then Chilblains' colleagues show up, and reluctantly help him prepare the men for the cryogenic process. Twenty-nine years later, in 1991, a truck crashes, destroying and flooding the cryogenic storage facility, and causing the tanks storing the two men to burst open. Willie and Frank, in body bags, are revived by floating in electrified water. Suddenly regaining consciousness, they escape from the bags, freezing, wet, and feeling confused. Once they get their wits about them, they decide they need to get back to Santa Fe, assuming Joy and Jess will be there waiting. Dr. Chilblains left them clothing, $100, and a note that doesn't really explain much. They are starving and go to buy food. The culture shock, high prices, and modern technology are amazing and overwhelming to them. Frank realizes he needs his medication, so they visit a hospital, which is where they finally learn the date and what actually happened to them. They manage to get back to Santa Fe and track down Willie's daughter, Jess (Colleen Flynn), who is now grown up with \\"her own telephone number‚Ä¶ her own house.\\" Seeing Jess all grown up, only now does Frank accept that so much time has passed. Once she calms down, she explains to Willie that Joy had to move on; she married someone else, but is now divorced, because her second husband just didn't measure up to the standard set by her first husband. She also told him that Joy stood up to Freeman; she managed to keep their home, and she exposed Freeman's scam. Freeman then went away and built half of Phoenix, and eventually someone murdered him. Willie and Jess leave Frank at her house, and go to Joy's house to meet her. While they're gone, Frank meets Jess' husband, who turns out to be Donald Freeman (Richard Steinmetz). At Joy's house, Jess makes her sit down and listen to Willie explain, but to keep her back turned and not look at him. When she finally does look, she has trouble accepting the fact that he hasn't aged, and says they can never be together again because too much has changed and she is too old. Willie manages to woo her back by reminding her why he loved her, that he still loves her, and he knows she hasn't changed. Finally, through a series of \\"home movies\\" and photographs, their renewed lives together are revealed, including the fact that Joy donated a kidney to save Frank's life.

It is a biodegradable replacement for water softeners and related applications. In nature, PASA has been found in as fragments of larger proteins with length up to 50 amino acids, but as of 2004 had not been isolated as a pure homo polymeric material from any natural source. The first isolation of synthetic oligomeric sodium polyaspartate, obtained by thermal polycondensation of aspartic acid, was reported by Hugo Schiff in late 19th century. Later it was proposed that thermal polymerization process leads through polysuccinimide intermediate. Polyaspartic acid is produced industrially in both the acid form and as the sodium polyaspartate salt. Properties and structure  Due to presence of carboxylic groups it is polyelectrolyte with anionic character. Naturally occurring PASA fragments consists of Œ±,-linked L-aspartatic acid. In contrast, the repeating unit of synthetic polyaspartic acid may exist in four isomeric forms, depending on the stereochemistry of starting material (D\\\\- and L-aspartic acid) and synthetic procedure leading to Œ± and Œ≤ links. Synthesis Some synthetic strategies leading to polyaspartic acid Isomers of PASA repeating unit Many different routes lead to PASA. In the simplest and the oldest approach aspartic acid is heated to induce dehydration. In a subsequent step the resulting polysuccinimide is treated with aqueous sodium hydroxide, which yields partial opening of the succinimide rings. In this process sodium- DL-(Œ±,Œ≤)-poly(aspartate) with 30% Œ±-linkages and 70% Œ≤-linkages randomly distributed along the polymer chain, and racemized chiral center of aspartic acid is produced. There were many catalysts reported for improving thermal polymerization method. Main benefits from their application is increasing of the conversion rate and higher molecular weight of the product. Polyaspartic acid can also be synthesized by polymerization of maleic anhydride in presence of ammonium hydroxide. High control over repeating unit isomers can be achieved by polymerization of N-carboxyanhydride (NCA) derivatives, by polymerization of aspartic acid esters or by application of enzyme catalyzed reaction. Pure homopolymers, D\\\\- or L-PASA with Œ±- or Œ≤-links only, can be synthesized using those methods. Applications Polyaspartic acid and its derivatives are biodegradable alternatives to traditional polyanionic materials, in particular polyacrylic acid. PASA has ability to inhibit deposition of calcium carbonate, calcium sulfate, barium sulfate, and calcium phosphate and can be used as an antiscalining agent in cooling water systems, water desalination processes, and waste water treatment operations. In addition and due to its ability to chelate metal ions, it provides corrosion inhibition. It can act as a super-swelling material in diapers, feminine hygiene products, and food packaging. It can also be used as biodegradable detergent and dispersant for various applications.

This eye toxicity limits long-term use of the drugs. Presentation The risk of toxicity is low for individuals without complicating conditions during the first 5 years of treatment using less than 6.5 mg/kg/day of hydroxychloroquine or 3 mg/kg/day of chloroquine, and/or cumulative doses of less than 1000 gram and 460 gram (total dose), respectively. Some physicians suggest that lean body weight is more accurate when calculating daily dosage. Most patients are routinely given 400 mg of hydroxychloroquine daily (or 250 mg chloroquine). This dose is considered acceptable. Early stage The earliest signs of toxicity include bilateral paracentral visual field changes (best detected with a red test object) and a subtle granular depigmentation of the paracentral RPE. Advanced stage With continued drug exposure, there is progressive development of a bilateral atrophic bull's-eye maculopathy and paracentral scotomata, which may in severe cases ultimately spread over the entire fundus, causing widespread retinal atrophy and visual loss. Pathophysiology Both agents bind to melanin pigment in the RPE, and this may serve to concentrate the drugs or to prolong their adverse effects. Diagnosis Patients and their primary care physicians must be made fully aware of the ophthalmic risks and the need for regular screening examinations to detect retinal toxicity at an early stage. Baseline evaluation for patients beginning treatment with a chloroquine derivative should include a complete eye examination by an eye care professional, retinal photography for follow-up comparisons, and Visual field testing with a white pattern. Central visual field assessment should test the central 10¬∞ of vision with a white test target (such as Humphrey 10-2 program). In patients at risk or those with unclear presentation, optical coherence tomography (loss of IS/OS junctions), fundus autofluorescence (focal hyper or hypoautofluorescence), and multifocal electroretinography (paracentral depressions) may be obtained. Profound abnormalities detected with visual field and multifocal electroretinography testing can be observed in the presence of a normal retinal appearance. Retinal examinations are advised for documentation, but visible bull's-eye maculopathy is a late change, and the goal of screening is to recognize toxicity at an earlier stage. Annual screening should begin after 5 years (or sooner if there are unusual risk factors). Treatment Cessation of the drug at the first sign of toxicity is recommended. No treatment exists as yet for this disorder, so it is imperative that patients and their ophthalmologists be aware of the best practices for minimizing toxic damage. Prognosis Associated visual loss rarely recovers and may even progress after the drug is discontinued.

Built of unseasoned oak, Sinop saw little service before she was stricken from the Navy List in 1874. Description Sinop was long between perpendiculars, with a beam of and a maximum draft of . The ship displaced and measured 3,813 tons bm. She was equipped with an imported British Maudslay, Sons and Field steam engine of 800 nominal horsepower that drove a single propeller shaft. This gave her a maximum speed of . Sinop was rated as a 135-gun ship of the line and she was equipped with a variety of smoothbore guns. On the forecastle and quarterdeck, the ship was fitted with one 60-pounder gun on a pivot mount, four short 36-pounder guns and eighteen 36-pounder howitzers. On her upper deck, she carried four long 36-pounder guns and thirty-two 36-pounder gunnades while the armament of her middle deck was similar except that short 36-pounder guns were used instead of the gunnades.

Construction and career Originally named Bosfor, the ship was laid down on 29 October 1852 at the Nikolaev Admiralty shipyard in Nikolaev using unseasoned oak. She received her final name, commemorating the Russian victory at the Battle of Sinop, on 30 March 1856. The start of the Crimean War in 1854 prevented the delivery of her British- built engine so Sinop was launched on 12 October 1858 without her engine or guns.Shirokorad, p. 63 This was done to allow the ship to transfer to the Baltic Fleet since the Treaty of Paris demilitarized the Black Sea. En route to Kronstadt in 1858‚Äì59, her repairs to stop leaks were completed at Toulon on 9 March 1859. Sinop received her machinery the following year and her further activities were very sparse, consisting solely of a practice cruise in 1861 from Kronstadt to the island of Gogland.

Background  Whitton was born August 4, 1836 in Dundee, Scotland, and emigrated to the United States in 1842 with his father (a stonecutter and mason), mother and brother Charles. The family moved to Wisconsin in 1846 and settled in Ashippun, where he received a common school education. In 1856 they moved to Waupun, where David apprenticed as a carpenter and joiner, but found the trade did not suit him, and in 1860 became a produce dealer.

In 2012 she received the International Women of Courage Award.  Life and career  Maryam Durani is the daughter of Haji Mohammad Eisa Durani, and she is a member of the Durrani tribe. She graduated from the Payam Noor and American University of Afghanistan. She has a degree in Law and Political Science and business. Despite the area's extremely conservative view toward women, Durani serves as a leader, role model, and advocate for women in Kandahar. First elected as a Kandahar Provincial Council Member in 2005 at the age of 21 and for a second term in 2009, Durani served as one of only four women on the Council and has brought women's concerns and a woman's perspective to the activities and discussions of the Council. As a young, emerging leader in southern Afghanistan, Durani's courage and dedication to the women of Afghanistan are embedded in the fabric of her daily life. Durani founded and serves as the director of an association focused on empowerment of women, and she manages Merman Radio, a radio station in Kandahar City focused on women's issues. She is an outspoken advocate for the peace and rights of women and girls in Afghan society, as well as for basic civil rights for all Afghan citizens, and she is determined to change the culture and perception of women's roles in Afghanistan. Durani understands and accepts the risks of being a visible woman in such powerful and meaningful roles, and receives strong support from her immediate and extended family who also face these dangers. Four years ago she was injured in an attempted assassination with a bomb that nearly took her life. The position she holds in the Kandahar Provincial Government is for a woman, extremely unusual, given the conservative values in southern Afghanistan, which continue to be influenced by Taliban views. Durani defies stereotypes and cultural norms and has become a strong role model for women who want to change their circumstances, both for themselves and for their families. She uses her position to foster justice, peace, human rights, and overall basic freedoms for Kandahari women. In Afghanistan, Durani has dedicated her life to educating those on the fringes of society and to pursuing equality for women and universal human rights. She believes that the greatest investment that can be made in Afghanistan's future is in its teachers, and that investing in their professional development will ensure that they have access to knowledge and information that will stimulate their own learning. This, in turn, will contribute to the critical task of providing a high-quality education to the youth of Afghanistan. Durani believes that to promote peace in Afghanistan, there must be expanded equal access to quality community-based education, as well as support programs that increase girls' and boys' attendance at school.

Human capital contracts for global health mechanism is that an investor, such as a donor nation, charitable foundation, or global health initiative, will cover the entire cost of a student's medical training. In exchange, the student will work for the first 10 years of their medical career in a government or NGO sponsored health clinic in their respective country of medical education. Their medical license will be contingent on this obligatory national service.

Freed from British interference, Soult planned to invade northern Portugal. From Ourense in Spain, the French marched south to seize Chaves, Portugal before moving west toward Braga. A short distance east of Braga the French came upon the Portuguese army, but Soult waited a few days for all his troops to arrive. During this time the mutinous Portuguese murdered their commander Bernardim Freire de Andrade, leaving Eben in charge. Once he was ready, Soult crushed his adversaries without much trouble.

Biography  After graduating with a law degree, he joined the Nazi Party in 1931 and the SS in 1940.Hett, Benjamin Carter (2014). Burning the Reichstag, p. 250. In 1942, he was promoted to the rank of SS-Hauptsturmf√ºhrer (captain). Wehner worked under Arthur Nebe, chief of the Kripo, which after 27 September 1939 was Department V of the RSHA. Department V was also known as the Reichskriminalpolizeiamt (Reich Criminal Police Department or RKPA).Gellately, Robert (2001). Backing Hitler: Consent and Coercion in Nazi Germany, p. 75. In 1942, Wehner led sub-department BI a2 within RSHA Department V (RKPA), to combat capital crimes. That same year, he published a book as to the alleged \\"criminal investigation results\\" of thousands of \\"Polish atrocities\\" against \\"ethnic Germans\\"; stating that Poland was responsible for the September 1939 German invasion and occupation of the country. He also took part in the investigation of the death of Reinhard Heydrich in 1942.H√∂hne, Heinz (2000) [1969]. The Order of the Death's Head: The Story of Hitler's SS, p. 495. After the assassination attempt against Adolf Hitler on 20 July 1944, Wehner was flown with three other Berlin criminologists to the Wolf's Lair. Together with Albert Widmann and Horst Kopkow, he reconstructed the events. He reported the conclusions of the investigation to Hitler. Wehner later organized the search for Arthur Nebe, who was wanted as a co-conspirator. After the war ended in 1945, Wehner was interned. After he was released in early April 1946, he worked for a time as a driver at the British military authorities in Bad Harzburg. Wehner went on to work as a criminologist and writer for Der Spiegel news magazine. He tried to diminish the crimes of the criminal police and its relationship with the Sicherheitsdienst (SD) and Gestapo during the Nazi era. According to author Benjamin Carter Hett, Wehner and Walter Zirpins were the \\"two most important post-war promoters of a sanitized version of the history of the German criminal police\\" in the 1950s. In 1954, Wehner became head of the criminal police department in D√ºsseldorf and remained there until 1970.

This is accomplished through individual and group educational and social programs, educational and cultural exchanges, and community projects.\\" \\"About Shansi,\\" (official website) Founded in January 1908, the original purpose was to memorialize the members of the Oberlin Band who were killed in Shansi province, China, during the Boxer Uprising in 1900. Beginning in 1918, the Oberlin student body elected graduating students as Representatives (now Fellows) to teach English and support extracurricular activities at the Ming Hsien School in Taigu, Shansi. This tradition was interrupted at the time of the Korean War in 1951 but resumed in 1980. Today the Association, in association with Oberlin College maintains partner sites in Japan, Indonesia, India, and China, as well as hosting scholars and artists from the partner countries to the Oberlin College campus. History In 1881 students at the Oberlin Graduate School of Theology decided to form into a group, ‚ÄúThe Oberlin Band,‚Äù to do mission work in China's then remote Shansi Province (now romanized as ‚ÄúShanxi‚Äù) under the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions (ABCFM). In 1900 thirteen of them and many Chinese Christians were killed in the Taiyuan Massacre during the Boxer Uprising. In the aftermath, a well connected young Christian, H.H. Kung helped administer the Boxer Indemnity funds and secured a piece of land for the use of the mission. In Oberlin, the ABCFM erected a Memorial Arch with the inscription, ‚ÄúThe Blood of the Martyrs is the Seed of the Church.‚Äù ‚ÄúA Brief History of Oberlin Shansi,‚Äù After Kung earned degrees at Oberlin College and Yale University, he returned to his native Taigu in 1909 and established a set of schools, the Ming Hsien (for boys) and Beilu (for girls), which constituted ‚ÄúOberlin-in-China.‚Äù In 1920s Ming Hsien became co-educational, the first school in Shanxi to do so. A village reconstruction center devoted to literacy education, public health and agricultural improvement, was established nearby. In 1937, Ming Hsien, to avoid the Japanese invasion, moved to a site just outside Chengdu in Sichuan, returning to Taigu in 1949. After the outbreak of the Korean War in 1951, the school was closed and the building made the basis of the Shanxi Agricultural University. Formal relations with Oberlin were not renewed until 1980.Ellsworth C. Carlson, Oberlin in Asia: The First Hundred Years, 1882-1982 (Oberlin, Ohio: Oberlin Shansi Memorial Association, 1982), pp. 19-33. In the following years, Oberlin Shansi created new exchange relationships with Tunghai University in Taiwan, a relation which lasted until 1978; with The American college in Madurai, Lady Doak College in Madurai, south India; and other institutions in Indonesia and Korea; and Obirin University in Tokyo.‚ÄúA Brief History of Oberlin Shansi,‚Äù Although in the early period the tone was distinctly Christian and the goal was Christian service, the Association focused on educational and cultural work, and was never a religious mission. As the prospect of returning to China emerged in the 1970s, mention of Christianity was removed from the Regulations. The early work was financially supported from gifts and student fees, but much of the endowment was given by the estate of Charles Martin Hall, an Oberlin graduate and founder of Alcoa.Carlson, Oberlin in Asia, p. 51. Observers have noted the ‚ÄúOberlin spirit‚Äù ‚Äì ideals of academic excellence, service, and international peace and friendship ‚Äì which gave the enterprise a missionary tone and sometimes ethnocentrism (particularly in the Association's early years).Jonathan Benda, \\"\\" Other Moments\\"/Moments with Others: Acts of Cultural Translation by an Oberlin Rep in Taiwan, 1958-1959\\" (Fo Guang University, Taiwan, 2008).

Reception  Bob Dylan  Reviewing Joel Gilbert's 2004 film Bob Dylan World Tours 1964‚Äì1974, Glide Magazine noted that Dylan's career during those 9 years was \\"significant for any Bob Dylan fan.\\" The magazine said Gilbert focused on Dylan through the work of Barry Feinstein, Dylan's chief photographer during the film's time-frame. It criticized the film for low production values and boring interviews, saying that the amount of information within the film \\"might overwhelm\\". It noted the director's love for music history: \\"His passion for music in general is displayed in every scene.\\" In a review of Gilbert's Bob Dylan ‚Äì 1975‚Äì1981 Rolling Thunder and The Gospel Years (2006), DVD Talk noted the film was \\"clocking in at a staggering four hours\\" and intended \\"for, and only for, the diehard Bob Dylan aficionado.\\" They said the film was \\"exhaustive and exhausting,\\" \\"an unexceptional, sometimes amateurish, video production.\\" Of Gilbert's 2008 documentary Inside Bob Dylan's Jesus Years: Busy Being Born Again, DVD Talk noted that the film was an \\"examination of the period from 1978 to 1981 where Dylan shook off his Jewish heritage and became a born-again, Evangelical Christian.\\" The reviewer said the film was amateurish and that viewers would \\"be hard-pressed to find a more irritatingly edited project.\\" Glide Magazine commented that Gilbert's film Bob Dylan Revealed (2011) \\"features an abundance of anecdotes certain to satisfy some of the most hard-core Dylan fans\\", but concluded that the film was marred by \\"questionable choices in the editing and production\\", creating \\"something you'll want to watch, but probably not watch again.\\"  Paul McCartney Really Is Dead: The Last Testament of George Harrison  DVD Talk severely criticized Gilbert's 2010 work Paul McCartney Really Is Dead: The Last Testament of George Harrison. Paul Mavis wrote, \\"Jesus, I hate documentaries like this one. I mean ... they really hit me where I live. Of course it's all utterly mad. Anyone can see it's been faked. The scenario doesn't even make any sense. ... Nothing here is believable.\\" Mavis said that the alleged conspiracy \\"hold[s] zero weight\\", and \\"not one element of the conspiracy theory holds up to factual scrutiny, and quite clearly and most obvious of all, McCartney is still around as living proof of the absurdity of the hoax.\\" Film Threat noted that an \\"audience's ability to suspend practical thought and accept the most outlandish concepts imaginable\\" was \\"stretched far beyond the fraying point\\" by Gilbert's film. They said the film had holes in logic and consistency large enough to drive the Magical Mystery Tour bus through. The film was originally marketed and distributed as a documentary.  Elvis Found Alive  Gilbert's next film, Elvis Found Alive (2012) was similarly marketed as a documentary. In 2012, Gilbert reclassified both this film and the Paul McCartney one as \\"mockumentaries,\\" and edited their Web sites to that effect, shortly before he released his conspiracy theory film that year alleging to have found new information about President Barack Obama's father.  Dreams from My Real Father  Gilbert's Dreams from My Real Father (2012), alleged that United States President Barack Obama's \\"real\\" father was an American communist. It was strongly criticized for its many unsubstantiated allegations about President Obama's birth and background. Slate said that the film \\"peddles a conspiracy theory so convoluted that more traditional birthers must be envious of its creativity\\". Both Jerome Corsi and The Hollywood Reporter stated that the film makes unsubstantiated allegations that President Barack Obama lied about being the son of Barack Obama Sr.. The film claims that Obama's real father was Frank Marshall Davis, a communist from Chicago, and that Obama's mother posed for nude photography. The Hollywood Reporter wrote, \\"It's about the lowest thing you can do to accuse, with no evidence, the opposition candidate's mother of being a porn star\\".  The Trayvon Hoax  Gilbert's film The Trayvon Hoax is about the killing of Trayvon Martin. It is based on a book of the same name by Gilbert, which had argued there was witness fraud during George Zimmerman‚Äôs trial. Glenn Loury and John McWhorter found the film persuasive, despite their misgivings about the filmmaker.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_t- wtTEp7G0&t;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWJvI1dPMAU In 2019, Zimmerman, represented by Larry Klayman, filed a lawsuit based on the allegations made in Gilbert's book.https://www.orlandoweekly.com/Blogs/archives/2019/12/04/trayvon-martins- killer-george-zimmerman-is-suing-nearly-everyone-involved-in-his-murder- trialhttps://www.chicagotribune.com/columns/eric-zorn/ct-column-trayvon- zimmerman-anniversary-lawsuits-documentaries- zorn-20200222-kef4togy6va3blp23l37qu2knu- story.htmlhttps://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/george-zimmerman- trayvon-martin-family- lawsuit-922255/https://www.washingtonpost.com/nation/2019/12/04/george- zimmerman-sues-trayvon-martins-family-prosecutors-million/ In 2020, Gilbert's production company, also represented by Klayman, filed a lawsuit that alleged breach of contract after a movie theater canceled Gilbert's private screening of his film.

In the composer's catalogue of works, it bears the number 1/10. History When the 21-year-old Stockhausen wrote the Drei Lieder in two weeks during the summer of 1950, he had no ambition to become a composer. On the contrary, he was approaching the end of his studies in music education at the Cologne Conservatory and, after numerous classroom exercises, wanted merely to try his hand at composing something of substantial proportions. The work was originally titled Lieder der Abtr√ºnnung (Songs of a Renegade), and set three poems written by the composer himself: \\"Mitten im Leben\\" (Midway through Life), \\"Frei\\", and \\"Der Saitenmann\\". (It is possible that there were originally five songs, but two were later destroyed.) The score is dedicated to Doris Andreae, who later became the composer's wife . Stockhausen submitted the score to the jury for the Darmst√§dter Ferienkurse, but they rejected it, judging it as \\"too old-fashioned\\" and the texts as \\"too gruesome\\". In reaction, Stockhausen decided to replace the text of the first song with a German translation of a poem by Charles Baudelaire. When he successfully auditioned for admission to Frank Martin's composition class at the conservatory, it was the Drei Lieder that he presented, and he also submitted the score as one of two examination papers in his optional subject, composition (the other was the Sonatine for violin and piano). The score remained unperformed for twenty years, until Maurice Fleuret asked him for something to premiere at the SMIP concerts in Paris. Curious to hear what this work of juvenilia sounded like, Stockhausen offered the Drei Lieder, which were performed for the first time, sung by Brigitte Fassbaender, on 21 October 1971 under the composer's baton. Stockhausen conducted further performances in Rome in 1973 and with the Berlin Philharmonic in 1975, and made a recording for the SWR in the same year with Sylvia Anderson, mezzo-soprano, and the SWR Symphony Orchestra (; ). Instrumentation The chamber orchestra accompanying the alto voice consists of: *Flute (doubling piccolo) *E clarinet *A clarinet *bassoon *C trumpet (doubling D trumpet) *percussion (two players) *piano *harpsichord (electrically amplified) *trombone *violins *violas *cellos *contrabasses Analysis The three songs are: *Der Rebell (The Rebel) *Frei (Free) *Der Saitenmann (The Fiddler) The musical language of the songs is eclectic, synthesizing elements of twelve-tone technique and neotonality with traits of the frantic German jazz of the 1930s . The influence of Berg and Schoenberg can be heard in the writing for the voice and the strings, while Stravinsky is often suggested by the bassoon lines and brass chords. The toy-soldier trumpet-and-side-drum flourishes that open each of the three songs, establishing their ironic character, recall Hindemith and Weill, and the frequent xylophone solos echo Bart√≥k's Sonata for Two Pianos and Percussion, which became the subject of Stockhausen's graduation thesis in 1951. The third song seems to be under the spell of Olivier Messiaen (with whom Stockhausen would study in 1952), even including what appears to be a brief quotation from the French composer's Trois petites liturgies de la Pr√©sence Divine. However, it appears that Stockhausen only first became acquainted with Messiaen's music the month after completing the Drei Lieder . The first song is a dialogue between the alto voice and the trumpet, setting a text by Baudelaire about refusing to submit to authority. The music of \\"Frei\\" is light and mercurial, in contrast to the grim humour of the text, in which Harlequin receives a knotted rope from the king. In a gesture reminiscent of the Alexandrian Solution, the jester defiantly cuts the knots with an axe . Discography *Karlheinz Stockhausen.

Secondary burial is a frequent feature of megalithic tombs and tumuli. Secondary burials were also a mortuary custom among many Native American cultures, and peoples of the Philippines  Overview  From an archaeological and ethnographic perspective, the burials of the dead are divided into two categories: primary burials and secondary burials. Primary burials refer to the initial burial, with temporary or final severance of all physical contact of family and community members with the deceased. Secondary burial may occur after a primary funeral ceremony, during which there is additional manipulation of the human remains. This may include a second funeral ceremony, sometimes considered to alter the spiritual condition of the deceased.  Description  Secondary burial is evident in the archaeological record and has been documented ethnographically. There are many different treatments, processes, and identifiers of secondary burial, and how it differs from primary burial . They can be similar in some ways. There are also many different reasons why individuals will perform the secondary burial. Some processes require the body to be prepared in a specific way before final or first inhumation. Others occur later. For examples, in the mortuary practices of the Neolithic Anatolian site of √áatalh√∂y√ºk, secondary reburial of the skull of one individual with another occurred.. This culture, like that of the earlier Pre-Pottery Neolithic B culture of the Levant, also practiced the making of plastered human skulls.. In this case, the body received primary burial while the skull subsequently received secondary burial. Identification Archaeologists define a grave containing a primary burial as a positive process, adding up certain characteristics in to identify a primary burial.. Archaeologists identify a secondary burial works as a negative process, characterized by the absence of certain elements.. If there is a full skeleton that is complete and with elements in correct anatomical positions, it is probably a primary burialGowland, Rebecca, and Christopher Knusel. The social archaeology of funerary remains. Vol. 1. Oxbow Books, 2009.. Some cultures deflesh an individual after death, a process known as excarnation, which can take the place of a primary burial. They then collect all of the cleaned bones and bury them in a grave or tomb as a ‚Äúcomplete‚Äù and ‚Äúanatomical‚Äù skeleton (even if some bones are missing). Due to lack of preservation, some small bones, such as the phalanges, vertebrae, or ribs. Therefore, the absence of small bones may not indicate secondary burial. Issues of site taphonomy or circumstances of death may contribute to incomplete skeletons. This damage may either be caused by natural processes (earthquake, flood, weathering, and erosion), animals (usually rodents but also snakes) may have burrowed and destroyed, or stolen and moved bones, or through human actions unrelated to the burial or funerary tradition (construction, grave robbing, farming). When there is a fully articulated skeleton, an archaeologist can look at the surrounding soil, under and around the remains, otherwise called the matrix, in order to identify the presence of organic material in the soil signifying the in situ decomposition of the flesh.. Depending on burial conditions and time, there may be some joint tissue that can be evidence of primary burial. Identification can be a challenge because, even if something is missing or does not look correct, it is not always evidence for or against either primary or secondary burial. Processes There are many processes and traditions by which a culture may perform a secondary burial. They may cremate the individual and even perform secondary cremation. They may bury the individual first, and then later exhume a specific portion, like the secondary skull burial at √áatalh√∂y√ºk, or the deliberate disturbance of graves at the Zvejnieki burial ground. Nilsson Stutz, L, Larsson, L. and Zagorska, I., 2013. The persistent presence of the dead: recent excavations at the hunter-gatherer cemetery at Zvejnieki (Latvia). Antiquity, 87(338), pp.1016-1029.. If cleaning the skeleton the members of the family, corporate body, or community may take the body to a location outside and leave the body to have it decompose and be cleaned by bacteria, insects, and scavenging animals, the latter of which may leave tooth and claw marks.. It is important to identify marks that happened after death yet before burial. The body may also be cleaned by other humans with blades. that leave cut marks on the bones. Instances of defleshing with blades have been interpreted as signs of cannibals when bones were cut or cleaned in a deliberate manner.. Secondary Burial Architecture and Structures/Features Artificial mounds and other, clearly visible, above- ground structures have been re-used since the New Stone Age (and even in later times, often by much later cultures) for burials of bodies, bones or cremated remains (in urns). These more recent burials, of whatever form, are referred to by archaeologists as secondary burials. They are found in grave mounds, usually in those areas of the site that could at the same time be extended. In larger dolmens, passage graves, stone cists, etc. the re-use of the interior space available was usually closer in time to the original burial (e.g. by the Globular Amphora culture), if necessary also accompanied by the removal or addition of secondary chambers (as in the Megalithic tombs of Hagestad). The mounds of the megalithic tombs, which were usually covered with earth, were re-used following a similar shape as the original grave mound. Secondary burial in the Holy Land involved an initial interment in a tomb, for example, prone on a bench, until the body decayed. Subsequently, the decayed remains would be relegated to a nearby receptacle within the same tomb. Later, another person, typically a later member of the same family, would be placed on the same bench, and the process would continue. This practice is described in the article on Ketef Hinnom. This practice of secondary burial should be distinguished from the continual use of natural caves, even when this falls during the same historical period, because they did not involve artificially constructed monuments.  Insights and Analysis Much of the recordings of burial ceremonies were from the observations of explorers, missionaries, and administrative personnel who lived amongst native peoples.M√§rta Str√∂mberg: Die Megalithgr√§ber von Hagestad. Zur Problematik von Grabbauten und Grabriten. Acta Archaeologica Lundensia, Vol. 8. Bonn and Lund, 1971. In the late 19th and early 20th century. Three important figures in analyzing these accounts were Hertz, Sch√§rer, and St√∂her. These scholars characterized the secondary burials of the Ngadju-Daya communities. These communities were part of the Dayak culture in Indonesia, and had a very structured approach to secondary burial ceremonies. These highly structured ceremonies helped the community feel as though they had some semblance of control over death.Miles Douglass: Socio-Economic Aspects of Secondary Burial. Oceania, Vol. 35. 1965. The translation and interpretation of Hertz‚Äô thesis was seminal in the field, and is still used as a basis for understanding and interpreting current cultural practices of secondary burial. The overarching theme for Hertz was that in the Ngadju-Daya communities there was a moral obligation from both the family and community to benefit the deceased in the afterlife. In addition to providing for the deceased, this ceremony emphasized the greater good of the community over individualism. However, it is important to note that neither Hertz, Sch√§rer, or St√∂her lived amongst these native people, leaving room for misinterpretation and bias. Secondary burials are also seen in many cultures over the centuries outside of the Ngadja-Daya. The unique characteristics and frequency of secondary burials are often used to help identify and characterize past settlements. These traditions have left a strong impression on people‚Äôs minds today, and hence have affected how we view past cultures in general. Some more well-known examples include the megaliths from the late Funnel Beaker culture, the stringent procedures in the single burial graves of the Battle Axe culture, and the uniqueness of the Pitted Ware Culture. Some cultures even contain the remains of multiple individuals being subjected to fire, but defleshing as well.

Key demographics vary by outlet, time of day, and programming type, but they are generally composed of individuals who are younger and more affluent than the general public: \\"Young adult viewers have been TV's target demographic for decades, because they're thought to have less brand loyalty and more disposable income.\\" In the case of television, most key demographic groups consist of adults who are somewhere in age between 18 and 54.

Description American soldiers in South Vietnam sometimes called the dwellings of Vietnamese civilians \\"hooches\\" (possibly a borrowing from Japanese ÂÆ∂ uchi, \\"dwelling\\"). Thus, the Vietnamese civilian women who maintained the dwellings were called \\"hooch maids\\". These women typically worked six days a week, cleaning and maintaining the rooms and belongings of the soldiers. If their work quality was deemed to be sufficient, they could be given goods from the base exchange, which could be turned into extra income on the black market. The military generally allowed most officers and non-commissioned men to have hooch maids, whenever these men wanted and requested their services. In Da Nang, military trucks picked up the maids at designated stops in the city every morning, and returned them in the evening. Issues often arose between the soldiers and the maids, due to cultural differences, including how to clean clothes properly, and how much soap to use when washing the clothes. Maids also cooked for the men when appropriate. The maids could earn as much as a captain in the South Vietnamese Army, although it was often less. One soldier described the maids as being \\"...good Catholics who might flirt with you but would never date an American soldier.\\" Nonetheless, some maids reportedly had sex with soldiers to earn extra income.

The show was renewed for the final season on December 21, 2012, after cast member Jason Segel changed his decision to leave the show after Season 8. Cristin Milioti, who was revealed as \\"The Mother\\" in the Season 8 finale, was promoted to a series regular, the only time How I Met Your Mother added a new regular cast member. Season 9 consists of 24 episodes, each running approximately 22 minutes in length. Taking place immediately after where the previous season left off, Season 9 covers the events of a single weekend that leads up to Barney (Neil Patrick Harris) and Robin's (Cobie Smulders) wedding. During the course of the weekend, \\"The Mother\\" (Milioti) is separately introduced to Robin, Barney, Lily (Alyson Hannigan), and Marshall (Jason Segel), before finally meeting Ted (Josh Radnor). The season also features frequent flashbacks and flashforwards in order to fully integrate The Mother's character with the rest of the cast. Thomas said in an interview that Season 9 is like \\"the Wild West ‚Äì anything can happen\\". In February 2013, Bays and Thomas teased that Season 9 is \\"going to be a new way to tell the story\\". The initial reaction to the new storytelling structure of Season 9 was mixed. Ethan Anderton from Screen Rant was concerned about how \\"24 episodes of television are going to be crafted from just three days of time\\", and Alan Sepinwall of HitFix was exasperated that after eight seasons, \\"They are really going to stretch Robin and Barney's wedding weekend out over the entire final season\\", though he expressed more optimism after the San Diego Comic-Con panel for the final season. Casting The ninth season features a cast of six actors who receive star billing. Josh Radnor, Jason Segel, Cobie Smulders, Neil Patrick Harris, and Alyson Hannigan all reprise their roles in this season. Cristin Milioti, who was revealed as The Mother in the Season 8 finale, has been promoted to series regular, a first for the series. How I Met Your Mother was initially scheduled to run for eight seasons after CBS ordered a seventh and eighth season in 2011. The show gained a resurgence in ratings during season seven, and CBS began discussing the possibility of ordering a ninth season. By 2012, Deadline Hollywood reported that CBS, 20th Century Fox, and all regular cast members except Segel wanted to continue with a ninth season. Segel had initially wanted to focus on his film career, leaving the fate of a ninth season uncertain. Co-creator Carter Bays observed that the negotiations were stressful, with a lot of \\"white-knuckled, nail-biting going on\\", but claimed that he was \\"confident that everything would work out\\". Craig Thomas noted the flexibility of the show's filming schedule, saying: \\"We've always done everything humanly possible to allow [the actors] to do other things.\\" Segel ultimately decided to sign on for the final season, and Season 9 was announced on December 21, 2012. Thomas and Bays were relieved that a deal had been reached for another season, fearing that having to wrap up the show in Season 8 would have \\"felt rushed\\" and been \\"disappointing\\". Bays and Thomas were first introduced to Milioti as a possibility for playing The Mother through casting director Marisa Ross. Narrowing down the candidates to three actresses early on allowed the casting department to avoid a publicized casting call for The Mother. Milioti was flown into Los Angeles to do an on-camera \\"chemistry test\\" with Radnor as part of her audition. Harris, who is a Broadway fan and had recognized her in the makeup trailer, gave Milioti a hug and exclaimed \\"You're The Mother!\\" before she was actually cast. Milioti was chosen partly because her musical history and time on Broadway, including her performance in Once, would have allowed her to play the role of The Mother, a musician, more convincingly. Bays and Thomas wanted to avoid casting someone who was well- known, fearing that the audiences' preconceptions of a famous actress might spill into her performance in the role. Milioti's casting was well received by critics, many of whom lauded the show for resisting the urge to cast a familiar face and instead opting for a relative unknown. Bill Kuchman from TV.com observed that, because \\"Milioti is a blank canvas to many of us\\", she has the \\"freedom to create a How I Met Your Mother character that's free of the burden of being compared to her past work\\". When asked at Comic-Con about guest stars, Bays revealed that, \\"If there's someone we loved over the course of the series, there's a good chance they're coming back [for the final season].\\" Returning guest stars include Wayne Brady and John Lithgow as Barney's brother and father, respectively, and Ellen D. Williams as Robin's co-worker Patrice. Also reprising their roles as Ted's teenage daughter and son in \\"The Year 2030\\" are Lyndsy Fonseca and David Henrie. For the bulk of the series' run, stock footage of a younger Fonseca and Henrie from the series' first season have been used, the better to reflect the kids not aging while hearing their father tell his story. The kids' scenes included one key moment filmed before production on Season 2 began; that scene, according to Bays and Thomas, served as the climax to Ted's story of how he and the kids' mother met. The climax was filmed on a set closed to everyone except Bays, Thomas, a camera operator, and Fonseca and Henrie, who signed non-disclosure agreements. Fonseca states she had forgotten the details of the scene in the years since its filming, while Henrie states, \\"I do remember. I think I remember.

Angry at having spent years listening, they insist Ted finish his story so they can leave. The panel answered questions from fans as well as releasing select plot spoilers planned for the season. Bays was enthusiastic about the trajectory of the season, saying that \\"we've never been in a place where it's July and we've plotted out the entire season, but we have this year because there's so much exciting stuff\\". Distribution Season 9 premiered on CBS on September 23, 2013, with two 22-minute episodes, and contained 24 episodes. Reception The ninth season of How I Met Your Mother received mostly positive reviews from critics, gaining a better reception than the previous season. The review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes gave an 80% approval rating for the season with an average rating of 7.3/10, based on 10 reviews. At the end of the season, Max Nicholson of IGN gave the season a negative review, writing: \\"Many How I Met Your Mother fans felt betrayed after watching the series finale ‚Äì and understandably so after Season 9 spent 22 of its 24 episodes building towards a wedding that was basically meaningless. In retrospect, almost any other arc would have made a better foundation for Season 9, including the series finale. In the end, unbalanced storytelling, lack of focus and unfunny detours led to the show's eventual downfall.\\" Adam Vitcavage of Paste Magazine gave the season a lukewarm review, saying that \\"Nothing was over-the-top funny, but it was a perfect combination of laughter and sweet moments that really do make up for all of the lackluster episodes in the past few seasons.\\" Episodes References External links * 9 Category:2013 American television seasons Category:2014 American television seasons ","title":"How I Met Your Mother (season 9)"},{"id":"37998432","text":"William Beauclerk may refer to: * Lord William Beauclerk (1698‚Äì1733), MP for Chichester * William Beauclerk, 8th Duke of St Albans (1766‚Äì1825), British peer * William Beauclerk, 9th Duke of St Albans (1801‚Äì1849), British peer * William Beauclerk, 10th Duke of St Albans (1840‚Äì1898), British peer ","title":"William Beauclerk"},{"id":"37998449","text":"Imre Poniklo (born 16 October 1974) is a musician, best known as the lead singer, songwriter, lyricist and guitarist of Amber Smith.

The target chosen for the attack was a memorial dedicated to the victims of the Armenian Genocide on the rue √âtienne Dolet which was inaugurated on 24 April 1984, the 69th anniversary of the Armenian Genocide. The Turkish press denounced the monument as a \\"monument of hate\\". About a week after the inauguration, three bombs were reported to have exploded on 3 May 1984, resulting in thirteen injuries, two of them serious. The monument, made of Khachkar stone, was severely damaged in the blasts. The mayor of Alfortville at the time, Joseph Franceschi, who was also the Secretary of State for Public Security, condemned the attack. Jean Poperen, who was the National Secretary for the Socialist Party of France, also condemned the attack and expressed his solidarity with the Armenians of France. An investigation was begun immediately after the attack. It was later reported by one newspaper that the attack was operated by the Turkish National Intelligence Organization or Mƒ∞T. The memorial bombing came after several bombings that occurred against Armenian institutions and monuments throughout France, such as the bombing of the Armenian Cultural Center in Alfortville in 1983.

Biography Blatnik was born in Ljubljana in 1963. He received a master's in American literature at the University of Ljubljana's Faculty of Arts, and a PhD (on the influence of popular culture on American postmodernist novels) at the University of Ljubljana's Faculty of Social Sciences in communication studies in 2004. He worked as a freelance writer before becoming the fiction editor for the Slovenian publisher Cankarjeva zalo≈æba. He has been an associate professor at the University of Ljubljana's Faculty of Arts since 2009, and was the president of the jury for the Vilenica Central European Literary Prize between 2007 and 2015. Blatnik travels a lot, especially in India and Southeast Asia, which occasionally reflects in his writing. Awards In 1984 he won the Zlata Ptica award for his first book of short stories, ≈†opki za Adama venijo, in 1991 the ≈Ωupanƒçiƒç Award of the City of Ljubljana for his book of short stories Menjave ko≈æ, and in 2002 the highest Slovene cultural award, the Pre≈°eren Foundation Award, for his book of short stories Zakon ≈æelje. His novel Spremeni me was shortlisted for best novel of the year (the Kresnik Award) in 2009, and his book of essays and literary studies Neonski peƒçati for the best book of essays (the Ro≈æanc Award) in 2006. Publications Blatnik's first book, ≈†opki za Adama venijo, is regarded in Slovenia as the first independent book of the generation of the 1980s. His popular topic is \\"the relations between the sexes, which he treats with sophistication, good humour, and irony. Chance encounters, fleeting relationships, resigned farewells, misunderstandings, and reconciliations are the stuff of many of his short stories. In view of his travels, especially in the United States, the human landscape is frequently cosmopolitan. His style is direct and laconic, in both prose narration and dialogue.\\" His short stories have been translated into about 30 languages and he has published over 25 books in other countries, including four in English‚ÄîSkinswaps (Northwestern University Press, 1988), You Do Understand (Dalkey Archive Press, 2010), Law of Desire (Dalkey Archive Press, 2014) and Change Me (Dalkey Archive Press, 2019)‚Äîseven in Croatian, four in Macedonian, three in German and Turkish, two in Spanish, Italian, Serbian and Czech, and also books in Russian, French, Slovak, Odia and Hungarian. Reviews Skinswaps received favorable reviews in Publishers Weekly (\\"The recognizably Central European characters mix philosophy, eroticism and everyday grit, returning repeatedly to themes of music, death, betrayal and the fragility of the individual's hold on reality. Blatnik's craftsmanship and modern flair direct our attention repeatedly to what is small, strange and essential in the world around us.\\"), The New York Times (\\"This debut collection ... shows that after the opening of the former Eastern bloc, modern alienation travels faster than social and political change.\\"), Kirkus Review (\\"Superlative short fiction from an exciting new writer.\\"), and elsewhere. You Do Understand received an equally positive response in Publishers Weekly (\\"Each of these short bursts (most are barely a page long) bubbles with a droll, dry humor handily captured by Soban's dead- on, deadpan translation.\\"), Kirkus Review (\\"Blatnik has a knack for wringing insight and meaning out of such concision, and he occasionally places stories with similar themes next to each other to exploit their resonances.\\"), and Library Journal (\\"Readers who actively participate in Blatnik's imaginative process will be richly rewarded.\\"). Publishers Weekly noted that in Law of Desire \\"some stories delve into darkly profound territory, like 'A Thin Red Line,' in which a former terrorist chooses a humanitarian suicide, sacrificing himself for a tribe's rain ritual\\" and \\"some pieces are wonderfully humorous.\\" Kirkus gave Change me a starred review: \\"With some echoes of Kafka and Vonnegut, this novel looks for the soul of the 21st century and finds an abyss.\\"  Books  * ≈†opki za Adama venijo (Bouquets for Adam Fade), short stories, (1983) * Plamenice in solze (Torches and Tears), novel, (1987) * Biografije brezimenih (Biographies of the Nameless), short stories, (1989) * Menjave ko≈æ (Skinswaps) short stories, (1990) * Labirinti iz papirja (Paper Labyrinths), essays, (1994) * Gledanje ƒçez ramo (Looking over the Shoulder), essays, (1996) * Tao ljubezni (Tao of Love), novel, (1996) * Zakon ≈æelje (Law of Desire), short stories, (2000) * Neonski peƒçati (Neon Seals), essays & literary studies, (2005) * Spremeni me (Change Me), novel, (2008) * Saj razume≈°?

He scored the club's first goal in the FA Cup in October 1891. Football career Nicholls was born in Southampton and joined the Southampton St. Mary's in 1888, aged 16. At first, his appearances were restricted to friendly matches and he was not selected for the club's successes in the Hampshire Junior Cup. From the autumn of 1890 onwards, he became a regular member of the team, scoring hat- tricks in friendlies against Winchester City and the Royal Engineers. On 24 January 1891, he played at outside-left in the second round of the Hampshire Senior Cup, scoring in a 5‚Äì0 victory over Geneva Cross, a team based at the Royal Victoria Hospital, Netley. Nicholls followed this up with a goal in the semi-final (against Banister Court School) setting up the final against the holders, a team from the Royal Engineers from Aldershot. Nicholls opened the scoring in the 20th minute with \\"a stinging shot no goalkeeper could have saved\\" before the engineers equalised. Two second-half goals, from Frank Bromley and Bob Kiddle, saw St. Mary's claim the senior cup for the first time. The success in local cup competitions prompted the club committee to enter a national tournament for the first time ‚Äì in the First Qualifying Round of the FA Cup on 3 October 1891, they played at Warmley near Bristol, winning comfortably 4‚Äì1 with Nicholls, who was playing at centre-forward, scoring the opening goal after 15 minutes, followed by a second late on in the match. In the next round, St. Mary's defeated Reading 7‚Äì0, with Nicholls scoring one of the goals, but the match was awarded to Reading following an FA enquiry into the eligibility of two St. Mary's players, Jock Fleming and Alexander McMillan. In March 1892, St. Mary's retained the Hampshire Senior Cup, with an easy 5‚Äì0 victory over a Medical Staff team, with Nicholls scoring twice. In 1892‚Äì93, Nicholls played the second qualifying round of the FA Cup, with the Saints going out 4‚Äì0 to Maidenhead and in all three Hampshire Senior Cup matches, losing 1‚Äì2 to Freemantle in the final. In the following year, he played in both FA Cup matches, with St. Mary's going out to Reading in the second qualifying round. In the Hampshire Senior Cup, he missed the semi-final against Freemantle but did play in the final which was lost 1‚Äì0 to the Royal Engineers. In 1894, St. Mary's were founder members of the Southern League. Not wanting to commit to regular league football, Nicholls decided to retire from the club, having scored over 40 goals in all fixtures for the club, with four goals from his five F.A. Cup appearances. Later life Nicholls was also a fine all-round cricketer who played for the Deanery club from 1901 to 1922, and became their captain in 1902. He continued to live in Southampton and was a season-ticket holder at The Dell. He died in February 1971, nine months short of his hundredth birthday.

This is thematically related to the subadditivity property of real-valued functions.  Definition  Let \\\\Omega be a set and f \\\\colon 2^{\\\\Omega} \\\\rightarrow \\\\mathbb{R} be a set function, where 2^\\\\Omega denotes the power set of \\\\Omega. The function f is subadditive if for each subset S and T of \\\\Omega, we have f(S) + f(T) \\\\geq f(S \\\\cup T).  Examples of subadditive functions  Every non-negative submodular set function is subadditive (the family of non- negative submodular functions is strictly contained in the family of subadditive functions). The function that counts the number of sets required to cover a given set is subadditive. Let T_1, \\\\dotsc, T_m \\\\subseteq \\\\Omega such that \\\\cup_{i=1}^m T_i=\\\\Omega. Define f as the minimum number of subsets required to cover a given set. Formally, f(S) is the minimum number t such that there are sets T_{i_1}, \\\\dotsc, T_{i_t} satisfying S\\\\subseteq \\\\cup_{j=1}^t T_{i_j}. Then f is subadditive. The maximum of additive set functions is subadditive (dually, the minimum of additive functions is superadditive). Formally, for each i \\\\in \\\\\\\\{1, \\\\dotsc, m\\\\\\\\}, let a_i \\\\colon \\\\Omega \\\\to \\\\mathbb{R}_+ be additive set functions. Then f(S)=\\\\max_{i}\\\\left(\\\\sum_{x\\\\in S}a_i(x)\\\\right) is a subadditive set function. Fractionally subadditive set functions are a generalization of submodular functions and a special case of subadditive functions. A subadditive function f is furthermore fractionally subadditive if it satisfies the following definition. For every S \\\\subseteq \\\\Omega, every X_1, \\\\dotsc, X_n \\\\subseteq \\\\Omega, and every \\\\alpha_1, \\\\dotsc, \\\\alpha_n \\\\in [0, 1], if 1_S \\\\leq \\\\sum_{i=1}^n \\\\alpha_i 1_{X_i}, then f(S) \\\\leq \\\\sum_{i=1}^n \\\\alpha_i f(X_i). The set of fractionally subadditive functions equals the set of functions that can be expressed as the maximum of additive functions, as in the example in the previous paragraph.

Brave co-director, Warren Apps, responded to the news on the ACT Grandstand radio program on 666 ABC Canberra by further expressing the need for new investment due to the demand on the current facility now exceeding its capacity. With the CBR Brave struggling to secure enough training time on the ice at Phillip due to all the other sporting and recreational commitments on the facility. 17 January 2016, the ACT Government released a detailed report into ACT Indoor Sports facilities that again raised the issue of ice sports and the Phillip Ice Skating Centre. The report highlighted the issues of having an old private facility at the end of its lifespan servicing a growing ice sports community and national sports franchise in the national capital. The report suggested a full business case and plan be drawn up at exploring alternative options for building a new multi-purpose facility in the fastest growing areas of Canberra, the Molonglo Valley and Gungahlin, where the lower land values can boost a feasibility case for construction compared to re- building in Phillip. Shane Rattenbury responded to the release of the report by saying a new ice sports facility with duel rinks for competition and practice was in the Government's longer-term plans but stressed the need for community engagement and private sector support. CBR Brave part-owner, Peter Chamberlain, concurred with the recommendations of the report in relation to ice sports. 26 August 2016, ACT Labor made the announcement as part of their 2016 election campaign that they would pledge to build a new ice sports centre in the south of Canberra as part of a $23.3m four-year plan to upgrade sporting facilities territory wide if re-elected. This policy announcement was made in response to the ACT Indoor Sports Facilities Report commissioned by the government earlier in the year. Initially $75,000 would be spent in conjunction with the Ice Sports Federation on a community consultation program to determine what the community feels is needed and where exactly the facility should be located. Ice Hockey ACT (IHACT) welcomed the commitment announcement by the ACT Government to building a new ice sports facility with IHACT's president, Allan McLean, commenting \\"We are very excited at the thought of playing ice hockey in a new, larger facility with the potential to grow our sport,\\". 19 February 2019, the ACT Government commissioned options paper for a new ice facility for Canberra was released by Lockbridge on behalf of the ACT Ice Sports Federation. The paper outlined three options for a new facility in Canberra. The three options looked at in the report included a twin sheet facility planned over two levels, a twin sheet facility planned over one level and a single rink facility planned over two levels. The projected price range between the three options spanned between $22.6 million to $35.4 million. All three options did not meet IHACT seating capacity requirements of 2000 seating and 500 standing as outlined in the IHACT function brief. The two story options provided 1200 seating and 400 standing capacity with the single story option providing a 600 seating and 200 standing capacity. All three options included space for the establishment of the Australian Ice Sports Hall of Fame. In response to the release of the options paper, the ACT Government announced it would establish a tender process, in the first quarter of 2019, to seek a private partner for the project. The ACT Sports Minister spokesman reiterated the Chief Minister‚Äôs promise to start construction by 2020 and advised the ACT Government had put money aside in the budget for the project.  Facilities  All facilities are located on a single level, barring a small mezzanine level with some seating and the bar serving alcoholic beverages, usually open during Canberra Brave home games only. Until June 2018, the rink was renowned nationally for its lack of hand dryers in the bathrooms. As of 22 June 2018, news broke rapidly of a fresh install of working hand dryers, breaking the long drought. A full list of facilities is as follows: Game-day experience at the Brave Cave, opening night of the 2015 AIHL season CBR Brave vs Sydney Bears, CBR Brave winning, 4‚Äì2 * 55m √ó 25m ice rink (nets are used around the rink to stop ice pucks with no plexi-glass) * Seating and standing room for spectators (approx 1,000 people) * Skate hire * Kiosk with hot and cold food and drink * Bar (located on the mezzanine level) * Public toilets * Disabled toilets * Outdoor parking, including disabled parking * Kerb set down and pick-up area with ramp * First aid equipment on site  Events  Phillip Ice Skating Centre is the home of the CBR Brave since an agreement was struck between the AIHL club and the centre's manager John Raut on the 1 March 2014.

Written by Charles Underwood and first released on record by Warren Smith in 1956, the song did not chart, but went on to become a rockabilly standard, covered by many artists. \\"Ubangi Stomp\\" ‚Äì usually Smith's recording ‚Äì appears on many compilation albums, including The Sun Records Collection and The Best of Bob Dylan's Theme Time Radio Hour. \\"Ubangi Stomp\\" is a straightforward uptempo rock and roll song; the lyrics, of no great literary depth (\\"Ubangi stomp ubangi style / When the beat just drives a cool cat wild\\"), tell in first person the story of a sailor who goes to Africa (\\"I rocked through Africa and... Seen them cats doin' the Ubangi stomp\\") and, enamored of the local music and dance, jumps ship to go native (\\"Then the captain said son, we gotta go / I said that's alright, you go right ahead / I'm gonna Ubangi-stomp 'till I roll over dead\\"). Some mixing of cultural stereotypes is seen when supposed Native American terms (\\"heap big\\", tom-tom) are mixed into the ostensibly African setting. The Ubangi Stomp Festival, an annual international exposition of America roots and rockabilly music, takes its name from the song, as does the Ubangi Stomp Club, a Dublin organization that organizes and promotes roots concerts and gigs. Saxophonist Earl Bostic released an instrumental piece titled \\"Ubangi Stomp\\" in 1954, but this has no relation to Underwood's song beyond the title.

Refugees arriving in West Berlin were sent to the reception centre located in the Marienfelde district, where they received medical treatment, food, identification papers, and housing until they could be permanently re-settled in the West. History From 1948, a rising number of residents of the Soviet occupation zone fled to the Western occupation zones (Trizone) and West Berlin in particular, to settle down and become citizens there. In 1949, 129,245 people emigrated, and the number increased every year. After the establishment of the two German states, the West German Federal Emergency Law (Bundesnotaufnahmegesetz) was promulgated on 22 August 1950. A small refugee camp was established in the Charlottenburg district of West Berlin, to help those who immigrated, but a new, larger camp became necessary due to the increasing numbers of immigrants - about 200,000 in 1950, approximately 165,000 in 1951, and 182,000 in 1952. After the closure of the Inner German border by decision of the East German government on 26 May 1952, tens of thousands of refugees used the remaining possibility to cross over the border from East Berlin into West Berlin. The Federal Emergency Law was officially adopted by the West Berlin authorities on 4 February 1952. On July 30, a cornerstone for the new refugee camp was laid in Marienfelde, in the American occupation sector. Considerations that guided the Federal Emergency department (Notaufnahmelagers des Bundes), responsible for implementing the law, for the location of the camp were its proximity to Tempelhof Airport and to the railway lines of the Berlin S-Bahn. The camp operations started on August 1953, with ten housing blocks and a capacity of about 2,000 people, but it soon became over-crowded with waves of immigration after the East German Uprising on June 17. The camp was expanded later on, but was always densely populated until 1961. Immediately prior to the construction of the Berlin Wall, the numbers of immigrants entering the camp rose sharply: from 19,198 in June 1961, to 30,444 in July (about 1,000 a day), and then more than 1,200 a day in the first days of August. On August 12 it reached 2,400. On 13 August 1961, East German authorities closed the buffer zone between the two parts of Berlin and started building the Berlin Wall. Overnight, the number of refugees in the camp decreased sharply and later on the camp almost emptied.source: F.Taylor, The Berlin Wall: 13 August 1961 - 9 November 1989, CH. 8 The number of immigrants again rose during the Revolutions of 1989. The centre continued processing East German refugees even after the fall of the Berlin Wall on 9 November 1989 and until the German reunification a year later. Up to today, it remains in use, processing ethnic Germans who are immigrating to Germany from the former Soviet Union as well as asylum applicants. A memorial was inaugurated at the site in 1993; it is currently operated by the Berlin Wall Memorial foundation.

It was the first smoothbore weapon designed for tanks and heralded the change in main armament from rifled cannons. History As the T-54/55 series began to replace the T-34 tanks in the Soviet Army in the 1950s it was recognised that the standard NATO tanks of the time‚Äîthe Centurion and M48 Patton‚Äîhad armour that was too heavy to be easily defeated by the existing ammunition for the 100 mm D10 gun that the new tanks carried. The Soviets set about designing a new \\"heavy\\" vehicle which was required to complement the tanks in an overwatch capacity and to provide greater anti-armour capability. T-62 Tank with U-5TS Gun at the US NTC The new vehicle, the T-62, was to be equipped with a new smoothbore design‚Äîwhich allows higher velocity and greater armour penetration with kinetic rounds‚Äîbased on an enlargement of the 100 mm 2A19 anti-tank gun that had entered production in 1955. The new weapon, designated as U-5T, could penetrate 300mm of vertical RHA at a 1,000 metres and re-established a comfortable penetration capacity against Western armor. Though the T-62 would have variable success in the conflicts it was involved in the U-5TS would remain a formidable weapon that proved capable of penetrating the armour of any comparable NATO tank until the deployment of third generation MBTs in the late 1970s and early 80s. This was proven by examination of Iranian Chieftain and M60s knocked out by Iraqi T-62s during the Iran‚ÄìIraq War. These examinations led to the development of add-on armour packages such as Stillbrew to try to counter the U-5TS. Ammunition Another first with this gun was the use of armour-piercing fin-stabilized discarding-sabot ammunition, with the initial 3VBM-1 rounds featuring steel penetrators. The subsequent development of this type of ammunition for this gun led to an array of penetrator designs and different materials with the final model, the 3UBM-13, using depleted uranium. In accordance with later Soviet and current Russian practice an anti-tank guided missile, the 9K118 Sheksna, has been developed for use with the T-62 and U-5TS. There is also HE-FRAG and HEAT ammunition available for this weapon. Due to the comparatively low height of the T-62 design - in line with Soviet tank design philosophies of the time \\\\- the U-5TS is limited to a rate-of-fire of 6-10 shots per minute due to little room for the loader to perform his activity. Experienced loaders were capable of reloading the gun in 6 seconds.

He was owned by the 1st Earl of Portmore until purchased by Mr. Cotton and then Thomas Panton. Background Crab was a grey colt bred by Charles Pelham and was foaled in 1722. He was a son of Alcock's Arabian out of a daughter of Basto. He was sold to David Colyear, 1st Earl of Portmore when he was young. Although grey was a fairly common color in the foundation stock of the Thoroughbred, it became increasingly rare over time. All modern grey Thoroughbred's descend from Crab through his great-great-granddaughter Bab (foaled 1787) and her great-great-grandson Drone (1823). Racing career Crab first race came in 1727, when he finished fourth in a 20 guineas sweepstakes at Newmarket. He was then sold to Mr. Cotton. His first intended race for Mr. Cotton was at Newmarket in April 1728 against Weaver, but Weaver's owner, Lord Milsintown, paid a forfeit and the race never took place. In the following October he beat the Duke of Bolton's Cleopatra in a 500 guineas race over four miles. In April 1729 he won the King's Plate at Newmarket, beating the Duke of Hamilton's Victorious and Mr. Williams's Spot. The following May he became lame when running in an 80 guineas plate at Stamford and never raced again. Stud career As a stallion he stood for Thomas Panton at Newmarket.

Life  Memorial for Willi S√§nger in the Zentralfriedhof Friedrichsfelde in Berlin, GermanyWilli S√§nger, was the son of a carpenter. After school, he completed a commercial apprenticeship. His occupation was a clerk and before World War I he joined the labor movement. During the war he served as a soldier in the German Army. He became a member of the Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands (SPD) in 1912 at the age of 18. Because of his moderate stance on the war, he changed party membership in 1917 first to the Unabh√§ngige Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands (USPD), and eventually joined the German Communist Party in 1919. He was an avid athlete and participated as a high jumper taking part in international competitions. He founded the Division of Workers Sports Athletics Association \\"Fichte‚Äú (Spruce). Later he took over the presidency of the Fichte-sports community in Berlin-Southeast and in 1928, led the Kampfgemeinschaft f√ºr Rote Sporteinheit \\"struggle unit for red sports unity\\". As leader of the red sports association he was responsible for the forerunner of the later Society for Sports and Technology / Gesellschaft f√ºr Sport und Technik (GST) in East Germany. In 1933, Willi S√§nger worked as an accountant at the Soviet travel agency \\"Intourist\\" and oversaw a working library. Memorial plaque, Willi S√§nger, Oppelner Stra√üe 45, Berlin-Kreuzberg, GermanyDuring World War II, Willi S√§nger worked extensively as an illegal labor functionary of the Communist Party. On behalf of the Communist Party leadership he put together reports indicating the political mood of the population. From about 1938, Willi S√§nger was a member of Robert Uhrig's resistance group. After their defeat in 1942, he joined the largest opposition group in the German Communist Party with Anton Saefkow, Franz Jacob and Bernhard B√§stlein. There he worked mainly as liaison to the Leipzig Schumann-Engert-Kresse Group of Georg Schumann. From the government printing office he purchased the Gestapo‚Äôs \\"German wanted list\\". This allowed some anti-Nazis to be notified and saved from arrest and death. The Saefkow Jacob B√§stlein organization was betrayed by an informer in early July 1944, and Willi S√§nger was arrested on 6 July 1944. On 21 October 1944, he was sentenced to death by beheading by the People's Court. His execution was carried out on 27 November 1944 at the Brandenburg-G√∂rden Prison. He is buried in the central cemetery / Zentralfriedhof Friedrichsfelde in Berlin.  Honors  Ellen Kiessling, winner of the 33rd Willi S√§nger commemorative run in 1988 Willi S√§nger resistance to National Socialism is memorialized in the Socialist Central Cemetery Friedrichsfelde in Berlin's Lichtenberg district. At his former home in the Opole Stra√üe 45 in Berlin there is sidewalk plaque commemorating him. The East Germany National People's Army gave their 40th Airborne Battalion the honor name of \\"Willi S√§nger\\" on 23 September 1969. S√§nger was a Socialist hero in East Germany and several streets, schools, sports teams, etc. were named in his honor.  References  Luise Kraushaar et al. Deutsche Widerstandsk√§mpfer 1933 bis 1945.

One faction, the Salahiyya or mamluks of Saladin, wanted Saladin's brother al-Adil to take on this role, as he was viewed as able and experienced. The other faction, the Asadiyya mamluks of Saladin's uncle Asad ad-Din Shirkuh favored Saladin's eldest son, al-Afdal.Humphreys, R. S., From Saladin to the Mongols, The Ayyubids of Damascus 1183-1260, SUNY Press 1977 p.110 In the struggle which followed al-Afdal had the initial advantage of being based in Egypt, while al-Adil was in Syria. Al-Afdal was duly proclaimed atabeg. War broke out between them and al-Afdal attacked Damascus, but he soon lost the advantage and in February 1200 (Rabi' II 596), al-Adil entered Cairo. Within days he had removed the name of al-Mansur in the Friday prayer khutbah and replaced it with his own, thereby deposing al-Mansur.Humphreys, R. S., From Saladin to the Mongols, The Ayyubids of Damascus 1183-1260, SUNY Press 1977 p.116 After his deposition al-Mansur was exiled to Aleppo in Syria. There, he lived in the court of his uncle, Emir az-Zahir Ghazi, who, in 1216, placed him in the line of succession for the emirate should his own sons predecease him.

In 2005 the building became Albannach (from the Gaelic for \\"Scot\\" or \\"Scottish\\"), a restaurant which specialised in Scottish food and whisky.

The opening was performed by Admiral Lord West of Spithead, who had been First Sea Lord from 2002 to 2006, and by the brewery's chief executive Simon Emeny.

It operated for thirty-one years, from 1974 until 2005. The name of the organization evokes the political task that feminists must \\"move the mountains\\" of institutional sexism and homophobia. The alternative spelling of \\"womyn\\" represented an expression of female independence and a repudiation of traditions that define women by reference to a male norm.Neeru Tandon (2008). Feminism: A Paradigm Shift The \\"coffeehouse\\" was a once-a-week Saturday night gathering, held at a rented space in churches, in various north side Chicago neighborhoods, that presented woman-identified music and entertainment by and for lesbians and feminists. Drug and alcohol-free, the space was intended as an alternative to the lesbian bar scene. The organization was founded by lesbian-feminist activists as a safe-space for women and their young children. Male children over the age of two and transgender women were not allowed to attend. The womyn-born womyn policy generated some controversy during the 1980s when pressure was put on the coffeehouse to allow admittance to men, as well as in the 1990s when the policy was contested by transgender women. It was claimed that the policy was discriminatory and created \\"mental difficulties\\" for transgender women. The policy was also challenged in the 1990s by a local gay male journalist. However, the organization defended its policy and never allowed admittance to men or to transgender women. In 1993, the coffeehouse was inducted into the Chicago Gay and Lesbian Hall of Fame. Upon the closure of the coffeehouse on December 10, 2005, it was the oldest continuously operating womyn-born womyn and girl-only concert venue in the United States. A successor organization was created called the Kindred Hearts' Coffeehouse, which serves as a monthly event offering women's music.

The efforts of George Odger, Francis William Soutter and Will Staffford to gain labour representation in Parliament was one of the first significant steps that would lead to the eventual formation of the UK Labour Party in 1900. Early life Will Stafford was born in 1837 in Melton Mowbray, Leicestershire. His father, John Stafford, was a pork butcher. His mother's name was Ellen Goodacre. In his early 20s he and his brother, John Edward Stafford, walked to London. His brother would continue on to Brighton in search of work but Will Stafford stopped in Southwark.  Personal life  He would meet and marry Annie Harris who had been born in the Newington Workhouse. Together they started a business selling bundles of firewood. They also started a family and by 1875 had 6 children: Ellen b.1862 John Goodacre b.1863; William b.1865; Annie b.1869; Harry b.1870; Violet b.1875. By the 1860s Will Stafford had moved his family to a house in Southwark Bridge Road, Southwark London.  Manufacturing career  Will Stafford built up a business manufacturing packing cases. By the 1870s his business would employ 40 other people.  Political life  Stafford's interest in politics begun early in his life when he took an active part in the community being both a member of the St.Saviour's Guardians and the St.Saviour's Board of Works. He would become a good friend and supporter of George Odger, who played a prominent part in the early Trade Union movement. After the 1867 Reform Act the number of eligible voters doubled from 1 million to 2 million men. The new electorate were mainly working men and they would soon demand representation of their interests in Parliament. Will Stafford would be one of the newly enfranchised working men that would encourage George Odger to be the first candidate to stand for the working man. The Southwark by-election In 1869 Francis William Soutter was an employee and lodger of Will Stafford's. On October 24, 1869, he read in the newspaper that \\"The Right Hon. Austen Henry Layard, one of the members for the Metropolitan Borough of Southwark, has been appointed by Her Majesty the Queen to the post of Ambassador to the Court of Spain. The vacancy thus created in the representation of that Borough cannot be filled until Parliament meets February.\\" Soutter was enthused and organised a meeting in a room at The Rising Sun public house near Blackfriars Bridge. To this meeting he invited Will Stafford, William Allan (the General Secretary of the Amalgamated Society of Engineers), and the South London Branch of the National Sunday League. At this meeting it was agreed that a Labour candidate be nominated for the vacant seat and that George Odger, who had earlier put his name forward as a test candidate for Stafford and then Chelsea, would be asked to accept the nomination.\\"Recollections of Labour Pioneer\\" by F.W.Soutter. T.Fisher Unwin Ltd, 1923, p.28. George Odger accepted the nomination. The George Odger Election Committee was formed. William Allan was appointed the committee's chairman and treasurer, Will Stafford was appointed the committee's Hon. Secretary. The result of the election was Colonel Beresford (Tory) 4,686 votes; George Odger (Labour) 4,382 votes; Sir Sydney Waterlow (Liberal) 2,867 votes. The historic 1870 by-election in Southwark was the first attempt to gain Labour representation in Parliament.\\"Fights for Freedom\\" by F.W.Soutter. T.Fisher Unwin Ltd, 1925. The Bristol by-election The near success and the enthusiasm generated by the Southwark by-election of 1870 encouraged George Odger to stand in the Bristol by-election later in the year. Will Stafford was part of the Southwark deputation that supported him at the Bristol by-election of 1870.TUC History Online George Odger's friends from the Southwark campaign would be asked to give up a whole week of work and pay their own rail and hotel expenses. Will Stafford was the first to volunteer and he was joined by Andrews, a butcher and Chenery, a coal seller. This was a significant by-election as it was the first time a candidate would represent Liberal-Labour. The Liberal-Labour candidates were sponsored by Trade Unions but supported by the Liberal Party. George Odger would lose the 1870 Bristol by-election. George Odger would stand 5 times for Parliament. His support was commendable but ultimately unsuccessful.The Collected Works of John Stuart Mill, Volume XVII  Helen Taylor  Stafford would become a fervent supporter and companion to Helen Taylor. He would meet Helen Taylor through her involvement with the London School Board. Together they would campaign for the rights of the working man, the rights and welfare of the poor and the rights of women. His obituary South London Times, September 1884 made special note of this association. \\"An ardent Radical, he was always to the fore in any contest in which there was hard work to be done. Along with Mr Fielding, he persistently agitated against the now defunct St.Saviour's Church Rate, and by repeatedly allowing his goods to be seized and sold, at length called public attention to its iniquity. He was always a generous supporter of the Southwark Radical Club he was also Miss Helen Taylor's right hand man in election times, and there is no doubt that it was due to his zealous efforts that Miss Taylor was so often at the top of the poll.\\" Will Stafford was one of Helen Taylor's most trusted advisors. Her opponents, within the Liberal Party, satirically described Will Stafford and Francis William Soutter as \\"Helen's Babies\\".

Born in Padang, West Sumatra, he was educated in Islamic schools until 1937, after which he became a teacher. Dabbling in writing short stories during the Japanese occupation of Indonesia and the ensuing revolution, for the rest of his life Usman focused on teaching and writing about literature. Biography Usman was born in Padang, West Sumatra, on 12 December 1916. He received his childhood education at a series of Islamic-oriented schools, beginning with a Thawalib School in Padang Panjang. In 1937 he graduated from the Islamic College in Padang, moving to Batavia (now Jakarta) the following year to become a Malay-language teacher at a Muhammadiyah-run school. During his lifetime Usman taught at a number of schools. During the Japanese occupation of Indonesia (1942‚Äì1945) and ensuing revolution Usman wrote a number of short stories dealing with themes ranging from travel to true love and diligence; these were published in various local magazines. Eleven of these were later compiled in the anthology Sepanjang Jalan (dan beberapa cerita lain) (Along the Road [and other stories]), which was published in 1953 by Balai Pustaka, Indonesia's state publisher. By 2005 the book had seen three printings. After the publication of Sepanjang Jalan Usman wrote two histories of Indonesian literature, Kesusastraan Lama Indonesia (Old Indonesian Literature; 1954) and Kesusastraan Baru Indonesia (New Indonesian Literature; 1957). These two histories were written in brief and arranged chronologically. Between his two histories Usman published a hikayat, or traditional Malay prose, entitled Hikayat Iskandar Zulkarnain (Hikayat of Iskandar Zulkarnain; 1956). Working with HB Jassin, Usman translated some of Poerbatjaraka's works of Javanese literature as Tjerita Pandji (Stories of the Banners) in 1958. In 1960 he published an academic work regarding the Indonesian language and literature, entitled Kedudukan Bahasa dan Sastra Indonesia (The Position of the Indonesian Language and Literature). Usman graduated from the University of Indonesia in 1961 with a degree in literature before formally earning his teacher's diploma the following year. During the next fifteen years, until his death in Jakarta on 25 July 1976, Usman wrote extensively. This included 20 new retellings of Indonesian fairy tales (1971) and Putri Bunga Karang (1973). Views Usman defined old Malay literature as those written before Abdullah bin Abdulkadir Munsyi came to prominence. He cited the latter author's focus on the everyday experiences of the average person, a divergence from the traditional stories of \\"gods, giants, or fabulous fairy tales with beautiful princesses and magnificent castles\\". This can be differentiated with the more nationalist periodisation, such as that of A. Teeuw, which emphasise an \\"Indonesian\\" awareness. Regarding Balai Pustaka's language policies during the colonial period, Usman wrote that although the publisher's prescribed Malay was not as organic or free to develop as those in outside publications, it was much less restrictive than traditional written forms. Legacy Usman has been cited by Australian professor of Indonesian literature Keith Foulcher as an early pioneer of Indonesian literary criticism. The inspiration for the faculty of literature at Andalas University in Padang is credited to a speech, entitled \\"Pembangunan Daerah Sumatera Barat\\" (\\"Development of West Sumatra\\"), which Usman delivered at a seminar in 1964. The speech called for the area's educational facilities to be further developed to reunite West Sumatra with the rest of Indonesia after it had been alienated for housing the Revolutionary Government of the Republic of Indonesia some five years earlier. However, Usman was not involved in the administrative efforts behind the faculty's establishment, which took until 1982.

Iranian dance, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gCw-iUEUWYg  Plot  The story begins with Khan Jhahangir coming back to the palace from the battle. One of many wives of the khan was pregnant before he left, and the khan was expecting a male heir. But the child was a girl, so the khan ordered the execution of the baby. Princess Gulyanag is raised as an unwanted child, away from the eyes of the khan until she reaches maturity. By then, she has a lover named Polad. But the khan sees the now 17 years old Gulyanag, and not realizing that she is his daughter, falls in love with her. Starting from here, the two versions of the play start to diverge, before connecting at the end.Azerbaijan International (7.4) Winter 1999, pages 54-55 In the first version, upon learning of her loves, the khan separates Gulyanag from Polad by locking her in a tower. Polad find the tower eventually, but the khan is also there to marry Gulyanag. Polad and Khan Jhahangir battle and Polad wins. Polad climbs the stairs of the tower and Gulyanag hears the steps. She thinks that it is the Khan coming to get her instead of Polad and throws herself off the window of the tower to the sea, falling to her death. In the revised version, the Khan forces Gulyanag to marry him. But the princess refuses, and tells the khan she won't marry him until he builds her a tower, to gain time. This shows the smart leading female character, not shown in the previous Soviet version. When the tower is finished, the Khan locks her in the tower and starts preparations for the wedding. But Polad finds him in the palace and kills the khan before making his way to the tower. Gulyanag, knowing the Khan was preparing for the wedding, upon hearing the rushed footsteps, assumes the person is the Khan instead of her lover, coming to reunite with her. She, again, jumps off the window of the tower and to her death. Polad reaches the top of the tower with no trace of Gulyanag. Realizing his lover died, he mourns her.

He won several medals in show jumping events, including gold for the national equestrian team, at the 2011 Pan Arab Games in Doha, Qatar. He also earned a silver medal in team jumping at the 2014 Asian Games in Incheon, South Korea. Equestrian career Coming from the Saudi Royal Family, Al Shalan grew up around horses in his birthplace Riyadh, but derived a slight enjoyment with riding. At the age of seven, he won his first competition on his little white pony from England called Snowdrop, until he was bitten by a riding bug. While at elementary school, Al Shalan met Khaled Al Eid and Ramzy Al Duhami, who later served as his trainer for his career, in a summer clinic. Having tasted success, he progressed from ponies to horses, and claimed his first career title for the under-14 category at the Abu Dhabi World Championships. In 2004, Al Shalan made his official debut in the international scene, when he reached the final of the King Abdulaziz Cup and Saudi Arabian Equestrian Championships. He achieved early successes by winning individual gold medals at the 2005 Islamic Games, and finishing second at the 2006 World Cup Arab League. Al Shalan also became the youngest ever competitor at the 2006 FEI World Equestrian Games in Aachen, Germany, riding on the Uthago in the individual and team events. Al Shalan eventually competed on his another horse Wido, as a member of the Saudi Arabian equestrian team, at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. He was eliminated at the second stage of qualifying rounds for the individual event, after knocking down eight fences and incurring three time penalties, which placed him in the bottom twenty places of a seventy-five strong field. Few hours later, Al Shalan helped his teammates Al Duhami, Kamal Bahamdan, and His Royal Highness Prince Abdullah Al Saud to an eleventh-place finish in the team event. At the 2011 Pan Arab Games in Doha, Qatar, Al Shalan was awarded a gold medal after a spectacular performance in the team event, along with his fellow riders Bahamdan, Al Eid, and Al Saud. He continued to capture a bronze medal in the individual show jumping event, with his 11-year-old mare Aphrodite van het Rexelhof. Personal life and education In May 2011, he graduated from the University of Miami in the United States of America, with a Bachelor of Science in Business Administration (BSBA), majoring in Mathematical economics.

In a racing career which lasted from February 2003 until December 2005, he ran twenty times, winning seven races and being placed on ten further occasions. As a three-year-old in 2003, he won two Group races and finished second in the Tokyo Yushun (Japanese Derby). His greatest success came as a four-year-old in the following year when he was named Japanese Horse of the Year after winning the three all-aged Group One races which comprise Japan's Autumn Triple Crown: the Autumn Tenno Sho, the Japan Cup and the Arima Kinen. In 2005, he failed to win but was placed in the International Stakes in Britain as well as in the Tenno Sho and Japan Cup. He was then retired to stud where he has had some success as a sire of winners. Background Zenno Rob Roy is a bay horse with one white foot, standing just under 16.2 hands high. He was bred in Japan by the Shiraoi Farm, from parents both of whom had been imported from the United States. He was sired by Sunday Silence, who won the 1989 Kentucky Derby, before retiring to stud in Japan where he was champion sire on thirteen consecutive occasions. His dam Roamin' Rachel was a successful racemare who excelled over sprint distances, winning the Grade I Ballerina Handicap in 1994 before being sold for $750,000 and exported to Japan in 1998. Racing career 2003: three-year-old season Zenno Rob Roy made his first appearance in a one-mile maiden race at Nakayama Racecourse in February, and won by two and a half lengths. He then finished third to Lincoln at Hanshin Racecourse before winning again at Nakayama in April. On 3 May at Tokyo Racecourse, Zenno Rob Roy recorded his first important victory when he won the one and a half mile Aoba Sho, an important trial race for the Tokyo Yushun. Over the same course and distance a month later, the colt finished second in the Tokyo Yushun, half a length behind the winner Neo Universe. Zenno Rob Roy returned in September to win the Kobe Shimbun Hai, a trial race for the Kikuka Sho (Japanese St Leger). In the Kikuka Sho a month later he finished fourth of the eighteen runners behind That's The Plenty, Lincoln and Neo Universe after being boxed in and struggling to obtain a clear run on the turn into the straight. On his final appearance of the season, the colt was one of the twelve horses invited to contest the Arima Kinen at Nakayama on 28 December and finished third behind Symboli Kris S and Lincoln. 2004: four-year-old season In early 2004, Zenno Rob Roy ran to Win Generale in the Group Two Nikkei Sho and then finished second to Ingrandire in the spring running of the Tenno Sho over two miles. On 27 June he finished fourth of the fifteen runners in the Takarazuka Kinen, three likes behind the winner Tap Dance City. Zenno Rob Roy began his autumn campaign in the Group Two Kyoto Daishoten on 10 October, when he started the 2/5 favourite but was beaten by Narita Century. Despite his defeat the colt started favourite for the autumn running of the Tenno Sho three weeks later. Ridden for the first time by Olivier Peslier he was held up in the early stages and turned into the straight in ninth place. He made steady progress in the last quarter mile to take the lead close to the finish and won by one and a quarter lengths from the three-year-old filly Dance in the Mood. Four weeks later, Zenno Rob Roy started the 1.7/1 favourite for the Japan Cup, then the world's most valuable turf race, at Tokyo racecourse, in front of a crowd of 119,362. Peslier moved the colt up to challenge for the lead in the straight and he drew clear in the closing stages to win by three lengths from Cosmo Bulk and Delta Blues. On 26 December Zenno Rob Roy attempted to complete Japan's Autumn Triple Crown when he was one of fifteen horses invited to contest the Arima Kinen. Under a strong ride from Peslier, he overtook the front-running Tap Dance City inside the final furlong and won by half a length. The winning time of 2:29.5 was a record for the 2,500 metre race and the four-year-old's victory was enthusiastically received by the 125,000 crowd. His performances saw him voted Champion Older Horse and Japanese Horse of the Year in January 2005. 2005: five-year-old season Zenno Rob Roy did not begin his five-year-old season until 26 June, when he finished third behind Sweep Tosho and Heart's Cry in the Takarazuka Kinen. He was then sent to Europe where he was lodged at the stables of Geoff Wragg at Newmarket and in August he contested the International Stakes at York Racecourse. He stayed on well in the closing stages to finish second of the seven runners, a neck behind the winner Electrocutionist in a \\"blanket finish\\". The colt returned to Japan where he ran in all three legs of the Autumn Triple Crown. He was beaten a head by Heavenly Romance in the Tenno Sho and then ran third behind Alkaased and Heart's Cry in the Japan Cup. On his final appearance he finished unplaced behind Heart's Cry in the Arima Kinen. Stud record Zenno Rob Roy was retired from racing to stand as a stallion at the Shadai Stallion Station in Hokkaido and has also been shuttled to stand in New Zealand during the southern hemisphere breeding season. In 2007 he also covered mares in Australia after being stranded there by travel restrictions following an outbreak of horse flu. His most successful runner to date has been the Yushun Himba (Japanese Oaks) winner Saint Emilion. He has also sired the Group race winners Pelusa, Animate Bio, Lelouch, Trailblazer, Cosmo Nemo Shin and Zennista.

On March 1, Paula reached peak intensity with winds of , sustained for ten minutes. However, the cyclone began to accelerate further to the southeast into more unfavorable conditions. As a result, Paula quickly weakened, and thus degenerated into an extratropical cyclone on March 4. Meteorological history The low pressure area that would eventually develop into Cyclone Paula was first identified at 1800 UTC on February 25, embedded within a monsoon trough south of Espiritu Santo, Vanuatu. At the time, the system was positioned under an upper-level outflow center and located in an area of warm sea surface temperatures (SSTs) of about 30 ¬∞C (86 ¬∞F). Early the next day, a sharp increase in oceanic heat content triggered a rapid burst of convection in the northern and eastern quadrants of the system. Associated rainbands also began to increasingly curve toward the circulation center of the low pressure area. An expanding circulation center and persistently deep convection allowed barometric pressures within the system to steadily fall. QuikSCAT and SSM/I data indicated that winds of gale force were persisting in northeastern areas of the system. As a result, the storm system was upgraded to cyclone status and was given the name Paula at 1200 UTC on February 26 by the Regional Specialized Meteorological Center in Nadi, Fiji (RSMC Nadi). The Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) also began to track the system, issuing its first cyclone warning on the same day at 1500 UTC, noting at the cyclone's persistent deep convection. At the time of its naming, Cyclone Paula was moving towards the southeast at . In an area of weak steering currents, Paula began to move in a small, clockwise loop. Quickly intensifying under favorable conditions and an environment of low wind shear, the cyclone reached Category 2 status on the Australian cyclone scale at 0000 UTC on February 27, with winds of , sustained for ten minutes. After completing its small cyclonic loop, the cyclone developed a small central dense overcast (CDO), containing a ragged eye. Throughout the day the eye became increasingly better defined as the cyclone accelerated towards the southeast. Still strengthening, Cyclone Paula moved across the Vanuatu island chain, making landfall just north of Port Vila, Vanuatu at 1200 UTC on February 28 with winds of , sustained for ten minutes. After passing Vanuatu, Paula moved towards Fiji, quickly passing the island to the south. The cyclone made its closest pass to Fiji at 1800 UTC on March 1, south-southwest of Kadavu Island. Operationally, it was believed that Paula peaked at intensity at this time according to RSMC Nadi with ten- minute sustained winds of , but this was revised to and a minimum barometric pressure of in post-season analysis. After passing to the south of Fiji, Cyclone Paula quickly accelerated into an area of strong vertical wind shear, due to a strong northwesterly wind current. As a result, the cyclone promptly began to quickly weaken, with maximum ten-minute sustained winds dropping by in 30 hours. After passing south of Tonga, Cyclone Paula moved into the Tropical Cyclone Warning Center in Wellington, New Zealand's (TCWC Wellington) area of responsibility. Still weakening, Paula transitioned into an extratropical cyclone at 0600 UTC on March 4, east-northeast of the northern tip of New Zealand. The JTWC subsequently issued their final warning on the system at 1200 UTC, later that day. Preparations and impact Vanuatu As Cyclone Paula threatened Vanuatu, RSMC Nadi issued a total of 14 special advisories for the island chain at six‚Äìhour intervals, beginning at 2344 UTC on February 25, and ending at 0230 UTC on March 1. In the Port Vila area, an estimated 100 families were evacuated from potentially flood-prone areas. The cyclone caused heavy rainfall and flooding across Vanuatu. Areas in the western parts of Espiritu Santo experienced damage due to strong winds and flooding in low-lying areas due to Cyclone Paula, forcing the evacuation of communities to higher ground. Trees were also uprooted, causing damage to communication lines and resulting in power outages. An estimated 45‚Äì50% of all houses and gardens in Vanuatu were reported to have been damaged by the cyclone, as well as 25% of other infrastructure. A 19-year-old boy drowned in floodwaters caused by Paula after trying to get his canoe to safety. Fiji In Fiji's Western Division, strong storm surge destroyed homes in nine villages across the coastline. Root crops, fruit trees, and sugar cane fields were damaged due to Paula. Strong rains also resulted in minor landslides and road closures. One fatality resulted from Cyclone Paula in Fiji.

Alaria is a genus of small parasitic worm about 2‚Äì6 mm long and approximately 2 mm wide. It is usually found in the small intestine of dogs, cats, or wild carnivores. It is most commonly found in Europe, Asia, and the Americas. The body consists of two shaped parts: the anterior, which is flat, and the posterior, which is conical to cylindrical. Species of Alaria have two suckers, the oral and the ventral. They have only one opening, the mouth. They are hermaphroditic. Life Cycle Species of Alaria have complex indirect life cycles. There are two intermediate hosts involved, but there can also be paretic hosts, such as snakes, mice, birds, and humans. The eggs, which are oval, operculated, and light brown, are released from adult Alaria and excreted from the final host's faeces and hatched into miracidium that infect the snail host, in which the eggs then give rise to the asexual stage known as sporocysts. The sporocysts then produce cercariae. The cercariae then leave the snail and infect the tadpole via penetration where a non-reproductive form is developed, which is known as mesocercariae. It usually takes about two weeks to develop. The mesocercariae transfer to their tissues and remain at this life-cycle stage. Finally, the parasite reaches its final host once ingested, usually a canid. Other hosts include cats, foxes, and minks. It has been reported that in the United States, raccoons were also found to act as an intermediate host.  Infection and pathogenesis After the immature Alaria parasite is ingested it makes its way to the lungs and further develops into adults in the small intestine. Usually, they are not associated with intestinal illness. If the infection levels are high, then it may cause pulmonary damage along with haemorrhage which can lead to clinical disease. Paratenic hosts also become infected when eating the contaminated intermediate host, either tadpoles or frogs. The mesocercariae remain in organs such as the muscles, connective tissue or lungs, and eyes. They are mostly harmless in dogs as well as the paratenic hosts. However, prevalence of Alaria in dogs in the United States and foxes in Germany are up to 30%. Unfortunately for humans, it can be quite harmful and even cause death. Humans can be infected by ingesting Alaria larvae, which can be from eating undercooked frog legs or contaminated boar or pig meat. Diagnosis and treatment Infections of Alaria can be diagnosed through faecal examination or thoracic radiographs of dogs and cats. There are no forms of diagnosis in humans. This infection can be treated with praziquantel. It's been noted that another possible treatment is with fenbendazole. Control and prevention Alaria infections can be prevented by keeping canines from scavenging or eating infected prey. ¬Ñ Preventing predation when feasible. In humans, you can prevent this by not eating undercooked meat of infected hosts. Cases of infection There have been cases reported of fatal disease with systematic infection with Alaria larvae ingestion of undercooked frog legs and waterfowl. One of the first cases reported was a single worm in the eye of a woman from Ontario, Canada. It is believed that she contracted the parasite from rubbing her eyes while preparing frogs legs.

Accessed 23 February 2013.  Background  Air pollution is of concern in Europe because it may impair health and damage the environment.\\"Air pollution.\\" European Environment Agency. Accessed 20 February 2014. Long term exposure to air polluted with fine particles in Europe, especially that from proximity to traffic, is associated with deaths from natural causes and low birth weight (but not necessarily with non-malignant respiratory deaths). In the EU, it is estimated to cost the healthcare system 1 million euros per year (nine percent of the EU Gross Domestic Product (GDP). and 2.2 million disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) are lost due to poor indoor air quality; it is estimated that 30% of those who spend a majority of their time within EU buildings suffer from Sick Building Syndrome (SBS). Although, from a global perspective, harmful indoor air pollution is caused by cooking and heating with solid fuels on open fires or traditional stoves, especially in poorly ventilated rooms,\\"Indoor air pollution.\\" WHO website 2014. indoor air pollutants may also come from heating and cooling equipment, electronic appliances, cleaning products, air fresheners, insecticides, and construction materials. Accurately determining risk associated with exposure to indoor air pollution and controlling indoor air quality with regulatory instruments is difficult. Audits of Indoor Air Quality (IAQ) may assist in lessening risk to the health of people, help to improve productivity and support the use energy efficiency equipment and methods in buildings. To meet these goals, the European Commission's (EC) Scientific Committee on Health and Environmental Risks (SCHER) ruled that the EU should conduct a comprehensive review of existing data on pollutants of indoor air and begin recording data in a database.  Difficulties in the IAQ audit process  AIRLOG proposed to make a web-based audit management platform that would make audits less expensive, more accurate and easier to understand. The platform would include a Decision Support System that would use previously entered data to determine actions in improving IAQ that would eventually become best practice. The platform would also take into consideration the need for sustainable building design, efficient use of energy and other green elements. An audit of IAQ is not a simple process for a number of reasons. The assessment must include measures of factors such as inefficient heating and air conditioning, growth of mould in moist areas, and the presence of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from cleaning agents and objects such as new furniture. The IAQ audit may encounter unknown variables that influence its cost, time, and accuracy. In addition, each building is different in size, configuration, and exposure to air pollutants. The creation of an accurate IAQ audit must come from the combined efforts of engineers, chemists, health professionals, architects, building managers, maintenance personnel, building owners and consumers. IAQ auditors need to be trained and accredited in order to give a building an official certification.  Elements of an IAQ audit  An IAC audit can be divided into two parts. One part is about the level of comfort experienced in a building and the other is about measures of IAQ. Levels of comfort in a building are determined by factors such as temperature, humidity, air velocity, air renewal, and ventilation pressure. The second part, the IAQ, is determined by factors such as inorganic toxic gases, VOCs, particulate matter (PM10), electromagnetic fields and radiation, and microbiological contaminants (fungi and bacteria such as Legionella). The audit is taken in steps. An initial assessment involves the collecting of information about the building and its ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC); its critical points; and its possible sources of contamination. This is done through visual inspection. Then, there is the standardised measurement and analysis of factors such as certain chemicals and microbes. This is done by collecting samples for laboratory analysis. A third step is researching possible corrective actions.  Problems to overcome  AIRLOG aimed to create software to assist field engineers in audits of IAQ in buildings in the EU. It also aimed to develop an integrated management platform that could become more effective as data was entered. Thus, testing of IAQ in an individual building would be aligned with the monitoring of IAQ across the EU. The problems in IAQ auditing that were to be overcome included: inefficient planning of audits, overdue reports, incompleteness, lack of transparency in reporting audit progress and slow accumulation of results for monitoring. They also included: risk of errors due to manual data entry, the generation of unreliable alerts, bulk data loss from Excel files and paper-based documents, delay or failure to implement the necessary corrective actions, and non-standardized auditing practices by building type, use and state. In addition, AIRLOG was challenged with considering the efficient use of energy \\"THADE report.\\" Efanet website. and the training of IAQ experts in standard methodologies.  Sources and use of data  AIRLOG aimed to integrate a number of data sources. These included: measurements from sensors; laboratory analysis; maintenance reports from building managers; and governmental and legislative decisions. AIRLOG planned to manage these sources of data using a platform based on Web 3.0. The platform would use artificial intelligence to automatically learn and propose actions for mitigation and control through the use of a risk simulation tool.  Legal framework  In its resolution of 4 September 2008, relating to the mid-term review of the European Agency for Health and Action Plan 2004‚Äì2010 (2007/2252 (INI)), the European parliament called on the EC to propose directives to address the following: :\\"Special attention to those vulnerable groups most susceptible to pollutants, by introducing measures to reduce exposure to indoor environmental contaminants in schools and health centres through the adoption of good practices to manage the quality of indoor air; specific measures on indoor air quality, to establish a high level of health protection and internal security, in particular...regarding construction products, to propose measures to increase energy efficiency of buildings and for the security and safety of chemicals used in equipment and furnishings; and minimum requirements for newly constructed buildings, to ensure adequate indoor air quality.\\" The resolution recommended that the EC encourage member states to improve IAQ through tax and other financial concessions and to reduce exposure to electromagnetic radiation in official buildings. Action 12 of the EU Environment and Health Action Plan 2004‚Äì2012 called for the development of ways to address factors affecting IAQ such as moisture, mould, building materials, consumer products, and indoor activities. Special focus would be placed on the IAQ of buildings used by people most at risk, the young, the sick and the elderly, for example schools and health centres.  Economic impact  In June 2010, an EU conference, \\"Product Policy and Indoor Air Quality\\", concluded that attention to IAQ would improve work performance, reduce absenteeism and reduce need for medical care and therefore have economic impact. Furthermore, the standardised testing, certification and labelling of indoor products that gave VOC emissions would facilitate international trade and reduce trade barriers within the 28 EU member states.
